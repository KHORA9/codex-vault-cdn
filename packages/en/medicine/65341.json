He has\r\nendeavoured to take advantage of the numerous investigations which have\r\nbeen carried on during the interval into the several departments of\r\nToxicology in the leading countries of Europe; and has in consequence\r\nbeen led to enlarge the work materially.\r\n\r\nHe trusts it may be allowed him to express his satisfaction at finding,\r\nthat the rapid progress made by Toxicological science during the last\r\neight years, while it has been productive of many important additions to\r\nour knowledge, has nevertheless not rendered any important alterations\r\nnecessary either in the general principles formerly laid down in this\r\nwork, or in what had been there stated as well ascertained general\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n EDINBURGH COLLEGE,\r\n   _November, 1844_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PART FIRST.—OF GENERAL POISONING.\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n CHAP.

Hence the\r\naction of poisons may be naturally considered as _local_ and _remote_.\r\n\r\nThe local effects of poisons are of three kinds. Some decompose\r\nchemically or corrode the part to which they are applied. Others,\r\nwithout immediately injuring its organization, inflame or irritate it.\r\nOthers neither corrode nor irritate, but make a peculiar impression on\r\nthe sentient extremities of the nerves, unaccompanied by any visible\r\nchange of structure.\r\n\r\nWe have examples of local _corrosion_ or chemical decomposition in the\r\neffects of the concentrated mineral acids or alkalis on the skin, and in\r\nthe effects of strong oxalic acid, lunar caustic, or corrosive sublimate\r\non the stomach. In all of these instances the part to which the poison\r\nis applied undergoes chemical changes, and the poison itself sometimes\r\nundergoes chemical changes also. Thus oxalic acid dissolves the gelatin\r\nof the animal textures; and in the instance of corrosive sublimate, the\r\nelements of the poison unite with the albumen, fibrin, and other\r\nprinciples of the tissues.\r\n\r\nOf local _irritation_ and its various consequences we have many\r\nexamples, from redness, its slightest, to ulceration and gangrene, its\r\nmost severe effect. Thus externally, alcohol reddens the skin;\r\ncantharides irritates the surface of the true skin and causes\r\nvesication; tartar-emetic causes deep-seated inflammation of the true\r\nskin and a pustular eruption; the juice of manchineel[1] spreading\r\ninflammation of the subcutaneous cellular tissue; arsenic inflammation\r\nof all these textures, and also death of the part and subsequent\r\nsloughing. Internally, alcohol reddens the stomach, as it does the\r\nskin,—but more permanently; while other substances, such as the diluted\r\nmineral acids, arsenic, cantharides, euphorbium, and the like, may cause\r\nall the phenomena of inflammation in the stomach and intestines, namely,\r\nextravasation of blood, effusion of lymph, ulcers, gangrene. Many of\r\nthese irritants, such as arsenic, are in common speech called\r\ncorrosives; but they have not any power of causing chemical\r\ndecomposition: if they produce a breach in the texture of an organ, it\r\nis merely through the medium of inflammation and its effects.\r\n\r\nOf _nervous impressions_, without any visible organic change, few well\r\nauthenticated and unequivocal instances are known. A good example has\r\nbeen mentioned by Sir B. Brodie in the effect of monkshood on the lips\r\nwhen chewed,[2] an effect which I have also often experienced: it causes\r\na sense of numbness and tingling in the lips and tongue, lasting for\r\nsome hours, and quite unconnected with any affection of the general\r\nnervous system. Another instance, first mentioned to me by M. Robiquet,\r\nand which I have verified, occurs in the effects of the strong\r\nhydrocyanic acid: when this acid is confined in a glass tube with a\r\nfinger on its open end, the point of the finger becomes benumbed,\r\nexactly as from the local action of great cold. These are undoubted\r\ninstances of a purely nervous local impression on the external surface\r\nof the body. The most unequivocal instance I know of a similar\r\nimpression on internal parts is a fact related by Dr. W. Philip with\r\nregard to opium.[3] When this poison was applied to the inner coat of\r\nthe intestines of a rabbit during life, the muscular contractions of the\r\ngut were immediately paralyzed, without the general system being for\r\nsome time affected. The same effect has been observed by Messrs. Morgan\r\nand Addison to follow the application of ticunas to the intestine:[4] an\r\ninstant and complete suspension of the peristaltic movement took place\r\nas soon as it touched the gut. A parallel fact has also been described\r\nby Dr. Monro, _secundus_:[5] when an infusion of opium was injected\r\nbetween the skin and muscles of the leg of a frog, that leg soon became\r\npalsied, while the animal was able to leap briskly on the other three.\r\nAnalogous results have farther been obtained with the prussic acid by M.\r\nCoullon.[6] He remarked, that when one hind-leg of a frog was plunged in\r\nthe acid, it became palsied in thirty-five minutes, while the other\r\nhind-leg continued perfectly sensible and irritable. Acetate of lead\r\nprobably possesses the same property.\r\n\r\nThese facts are important, because some physiologists have doubted\r\nwhether any local impressions of a purely nervous nature, unconnected\r\nwith appreciable organic change, may arise from the action of poisons.\r\nYet the existence of impressions of the kind is essential to the\r\nstability of the doctrine of the sympathetic operation of poisons,—that\r\nis, of the transmission of their influence from organ to organ along the\r\nnerves. Nay, in the instance of many poisons supposed to act in that\r\nmanner, we must still farther believe in the existence of primary\r\nnervous impressions, which are not only unconnected with organic change,\r\nbut likewise undistinguishable by any local sign whatsoever.\r\n\r\nOf the three varieties in the local effects of poisons—corrosion,\r\nirritation, and nervous impressions,—the first two may take place in any\r\ntissue or organ; for example, they have been observed on the skin, on\r\nthe mucous membrane of the stomach, intestines, windpipe, air tubes,\r\nbladder, and vagina, in the cellular tissue, in the serous membranes of\r\nthe chest and abdomen, in the muscular fibre. We are not so well\r\nacquainted with the nature of local nervous impressions on different\r\ntissues; but it is probable that in some textures of the body they are\r\nvery indistinct.\r\n\r\nSo much for the local effects of poisons.\r\n\r\nOn tracing the phenomena which follow more remotely, we observe that the\r\naffected part sometimes recovers without any visible change, sometimes\r\nundergoes the usual processes consequent on inflammation, sometimes\r\nperishes at once and is thrown off; and if the organ is one whose\r\nfunction is necessary to life, death may gradually ensue, in consequence\r\nof that function being irrecoverably injured. The purest example of the\r\nlast train of phenomena is to be seen in the occasional effects of the\r\nmineral acids or alkalis: death may take place simply from starvation,\r\nbecause the inner surface of the stomach and intestines is so much\r\ninjured that a sufficient quantity of nutriment cannot be assimilated.\r\n\r\nBut death and its antecedents can seldom be accounted for in this way.\r\nFor symptoms are often witnessed, which bear no direct relation to the\r\nlocal injury: death is generally too rapid to have arisen from the\r\nfunction of the part having been annihilated: and the rapidity of the\r\npoisoning is not proportional in different cases to the local injury\r\nproduced. Even the mineral acids and alkalis seldom kill by impeding or\r\nannihilating digestion, because they often prove fatal in a few hours;\r\nand among other poisons there are few which ever cause death simply by\r\ndisturbing the function of the part primarily acted on. Death and the\r\nsymptoms preceding it arise from an injury of some other organ, to which\r\nthey are not and cannot be directly applied. We are thus led to consider\r\ntheir remote action.\r\n\r\nThe term _remote_ is here used in preference to the common phrase\r\n_general_ action, because the latter implies an action on the general\r\nsystem or whole body; whereas it appears that an action of such a kind\r\nis rare, and that most poisons which have an indirect action exert it on\r\none or more of the important organs only, and not on the general system.\r\n\r\nThere is not a better instance of the remote action of poisons than\r\noxalic acid. It has been already mentioned that concentrated oxalic acid\r\nis a corrosive: yet it never kills by destroying the function of the\r\nstomach. Man, as well as the lower animals, will live several days or\r\nweeks without nutriment. Now this poison has been known to kill a man in\r\nten minutes, and a dog in three minutes only. Neither does it always\r\ninduce, when swallowed, symptoms of an injury of the stomach; for death\r\nis often preceded by tetanus, or apoplexy, or mortal faintness. Nor is\r\nthe violence of the poisoning proportional to the extent of the local\r\ninjury: in fact, death is most rapid under circumstances in which the\r\nstomach is least injured, namely, when the acid is considerably\r\ndiluted.[7]\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to enquire, then, in what way the influence of a\r\npoison is conveyed from one organ to another.\r\n\r\nHere it will at once be perceived that the conveyance can be\r\naccomplished in one of two ways only. Either the local impression passes\r\nalong the nerves to the organ secondarily affected; or the poison enters\r\nthe bibulous vessels, mingles with the blood, and passes through the\r\nmedium of the circulation. In the former way poisons are said to act\r\nthrough _sympathy_, in the latter, through _absorption_.\r\n\r\n1. _On the Action of Poisons through Sympathy._ In the infancy of\r\ntoxicology all poisons were believed to act through sympathy. Since\r\nMagendie’s discoveries on venous absorption in 1809, the favourite\r\ndoctrine has on the other hand been, that most, if not all, act through\r\nthe medium of the blood. And a recent theory, combining both views,\r\nrepresents that, although many poisons do enter the blood, the operation\r\neven of these nevertheless consists of an impression made on the\r\nsentient extremities of the nerves of the blood-vessels and conveyed\r\nthence along their filaments to the brain or other organs.\r\n\r\nThe nerves certainly possess the power of conveying from one organ to\r\nanother various impressions besides those of the external senses. This\r\nis shown by many familiar phenomena; and in reference to the present\r\nsubject, is aptly illustrated by the remote or sympathetic effects of\r\nmere mechanical injury and natural disease of the stomach. Acute\r\ninflammation of the stomach generally proves fatal long before death can\r\narise from digestion being stopped; and it is accompanied with\r\nconstitutional symptoms, neither attributable to injury of that\r\nfunction, nor developed in so marked a degree during inflammation in\r\nother organs. These symptoms and the rapid death which succeeds them are\r\nvaguely imputed to the general system sympathizing with the affected\r\npart; but it is more probable that one organ only is thus, at least in\r\nthe first instance, acted on sympathetically, namely, the heart. The\r\neffects of mechanical injuries are still more in point. Wounds of the\r\nstomach may prove fatal before inflammation can begin; rupture from\r\nover-distension may cause instant death; and in either case without\r\nmaterial hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nThese observations being held in view, it is impossible to doubt, that\r\nsome organs sympathize with certain impressions made on others at a\r\ndistance; nor can we imagine any other mode of conveyance for these\r\nimpressions except along the nerves. The question, then, comes to be\r\nwhat are the impressions that may be so transmitted?\r\n\r\nThe statements already made will prepare us to expect a sympathetic\r\naction in the case of poisons that manifestly injure the structure of\r\nthe organ to which they are applied. In the instance of the pure\r\ncorrosives its existence may be presumed from the identity of the\r\nphenomena of their remote action with those of natural disease or\r\nmechanical injury. It was stated above that the mineral acids when\r\nswallowed often prove fatal in a very short space of time; and here, as\r\nin mere injury from disease or violence, the symptoms are an\r\nimperceptible pulse, fainting, and mortal weakness. Remote organs\r\ntherefore must be injured; and from the identity of the phenomena with\r\nthose of idiopathic affections of the stomach, even if there were no\r\nother proof, it might be presumed that the primary impression is\r\nconveyed along the nerves. We are not restricted, however, to such an\r\nargument: The presumptive inference is turned to certainty by the effect\r\nof dilution on the activity of these poisons. Dilution materially\r\nlessens or even takes away altogether the remote action of the mineral\r\nacids. Now dilution facilitates, instead of impeding their absorption:\r\nconsequently they do not act on remote organs through that channel.\r\nThere is no other way left by which we can conceive them to act, except\r\nby conveyance of the local impression along the nerves.—As to the\r\nirritants that are not corrosive, it can hardly be doubted, since they\r\ninflame the stomach, that the usual remote effects of inflammation will\r\nensue, namely, a sympathetic injury of distant organs.\r\n\r\nBut it remains to be considered, whether distant organs may sympathize\r\nalso with the peculiar local impressions called nervous,—which are not\r\naccompanied by any visible derangement of structure. This variety of\r\naction by sympathy is the one which has chiefly engaged the attention of\r\ntoxicologists; and it has been freely resorted to for explaining the\r\neffects of many poisons. Nevertheless its existence is doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe only important arguments in support of the sympathetic action of\r\npoisons are, that unequivocal instances exist of local nervous\r\nimpressions being conveyed to a limited extent along the nerves,—and\r\nthat the rapidity of the effects of some poisons is so great as to be\r\nincompatible with any other medium of action except the nervous system.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is maintained, that a limited nervous\r\ntransmission, that is, the conveyance of a local impression, purely\r\nfunctional in its nature, to parts at a short distance from the texture\r\nacted on directly, must occur in some instances,—as, for example, in the\r\naction of belladonna in dilating the pupil when applied to the\r\nconjunctiva of the eye, and in the effect of opium in allaying\r\ndeep-seated pain when applied to the integuments over the affected part.\r\nIt is by no means clear, however, that nervous transmission is in such\r\ncircumstances the only possible medium of action; and that the phenomena\r\nmay not as well be owing to the agent being conveyed in substance, by\r\nimbibition or absorption, to the parts ultimately acted on. It is not\r\nunworthy of remark too, that in the case of hydrocyanic acid,—a poison,\r\nwhich, more perhaps than any other, has been held to act by sympathy,\r\nand which produces on the integuments a direct local impression of a\r\npeculiar and unequivocal kind,—there is positive evidence of the direct\r\nimpression not being conveyed along the nerves, even to the most limited\r\ndistance; for I have not been able to observe the slightest effect\r\nbeyond the abrupt line on the skin which defines the spot with which the\r\nacid had been in contact.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is thought that certain poisons, such as hydrocyanic acid,\r\nstrychnia, alcohol, conia, and some others, produce their remote effects\r\nwith a velocity, which is incompatible with any conceivable mode of\r\naction except the transmission of a primary local impulse along the\r\nnerves, and more especially incompatible with the poison having followed\r\nthe circuitous route of the circulation to the organs which are affected\r\nby it remotely. Thus in regard to the hydrocyanic acid, Sir B. Brodie\r\nhas stated,[8] that a drop of the essential oil of bitter almonds, which\r\nowes its power to this acid, caused convulsions instantly when applied\r\nto the tongue of a cat; and that happening once to taste it himself, he\r\nhad scarcely applied it to his tongue, when he felt a sudden momentary\r\nfeebleness of his limbs, so that he could scarcely stand. Magendie,[9]\r\nspeaking of the pure hydrocyanic acid, compares it in point of swiftness\r\nof action to the cannon ball or thunderbolt. In the course of certain\r\nexperiments made not long ago with the diluted acid by Dr. Freer, Mr.\r\nMacaulay and others,[10] to decide the true rapidity of this poison,\r\nseveral dogs were brought under its influence in ten, eight, five, and\r\neven three seconds; during an experimental inquiry I afterwards\r\nundertook for the same purpose,[11] I remarked on one occasion that a\r\nrabbit was killed outright in four seconds; and Mr. Taylor has more\r\nrecently stated, that he has seen the effects induced so quickly in\r\ncats, that there was no sensible interval of time between the\r\napplication of the poison to the tongue and the first signs of\r\npoisoning.[12] Strychnia, the active principle of nux-vomica, acts\r\nsometimes with a speed little inferior to that of hydrocyanic acid; for\r\nPelletier and Caventou have seen its effects begin in fifteen\r\nseconds.[13] Alcohol, according to Sir B. Brodie,[14] also acts on\r\nanimals with equal celerity; for when he introduced it into the stomach\r\nof a rabbit, its effects began when the injection was hardly completed.\r\nConia, the active principle of hemlock, is not less prompt in its\r\noperation: when it was injected in the form of muriate into the femoral\r\nvein of a dog, I was unable, with my watch in my hand, to observe an\r\nappreciable interval between the moment it was injected and that in\r\nwhich the animal died;[15] certainly the interval did not exceed three\r\nor at most four seconds.\r\n\r\nFacts such as these have been long held adequate to prove that some\r\npoisons must act on remote organs by sympathy or transmission of a local\r\nimpulse along the nerves; and in the last edition of this work they were\r\nacknowledged to warrant such a conclusion. It was thought difficult to\r\naccount for the phenomena on the supposition that the poison was\r\nconveyed in substance with the blood to the organ remotely affected by\r\nit; for it appeared impossible that, in so short a space of time as\r\nelapsed in some of the instances now referred to, the poison could enter\r\nthe veins of the texture to which it was applied, pass into the right\r\nside of the heart, follow the circle of the pulmonary circulation into\r\nthe left side of the heart, and thence be transmitted by the arterial\r\nsystem to the capillaries of the organ ultimately affected. But the\r\nprogress of physiological discovery has lately brought the soundness of\r\nthese views into question. Some years ago Dr. Hering of Stuttgardt\r\nshowed that the round of the circulation may be accomplished by the\r\nblood much more speedily than had been conceived before; for the\r\nferro-cyanide of potassium, injected into the jugular vein of a horse,\r\nwas discovered by him throughout the venous system at large in the short\r\nspace of twenty or thirty seconds, and consequently must have passed in\r\nthat period throughout the whole double circle of the pulmonary and\r\nsystemic circulation.[16] This discovery at once shook the validity of\r\nmany, though not all, of the facts which had been previously referred to\r\nthe agency of nervous transmission on the ground of the celerity with\r\nwhich the effects of poisons are manifested. More recently an attempt\r\nhas been made by Mr. Blake to prove, that the circulation is so rapid as\r\nto admit even of the swiftest cases of poisoning being referred to the\r\nagency of absorption. Mr. Blake, who is altogether opposed to the\r\noccurrence of nervous transmission in the instance of any poison, has\r\nfound that ammonia, injected into the jugular vein of a dog, was\r\nindicated in its breath in four seconds; and that chloride of barium or\r\nnitrate of baryta, introduced into the same vessel, could be detected in\r\nthe blood of the carotid artery in about sixteen seconds in the horse,\r\nin less than seven seconds in the dog, in six seconds in the fowl, and\r\nin four seconds in the rabbit.[17] These interesting discoveries,\r\nhowever, will not absolutely destroy the conclusiveness of all the facts\r\nquoted above in support of the existence of a sympathetic action. For\r\nexample they do not shake the validity of those observations, in which\r\nit appeared that an interval inappreciable, or barely appreciable,\r\nelapsed between the application and action of hydrocyanic acid and of\r\nconia. Mr. Blake indeed denies the accuracy of these observations,\r\ninsisting that, in those he made himself with the most potent poisons,\r\nhe never failed to witness, before the poison began to act, an interval\r\nconsiderably longer than what had been observed by others, and longer\r\nalso than what he had found sufficient for the blood to complete the\r\nround of the circulation; that, for example, the wourali poison injected\r\ninto the femoral or jugular vein did not begin to act for twenty\r\nseconds, conia and tobacco for fifteen seconds, and extract of nux\r\nvomica for twelve seconds; and that hydrocyanic acid dropped on the\r\ntongue did not act for eleven seconds if the animal was allowed to\r\ninhale its vapour, and not for sixteen seconds, if direct access to the\r\nlungs was prevented by making the animal breathe through a tube in the\r\nwindpipe. But Mr. Blake cannot rid himself thus summarily of the\r\npositive facts which stand in his way. Duly weighed, the balance of\r\ntestimony is in favour of those whose accuracy he impugns. For in the\r\nfirst place, they had not, like him, a theory to build up with their\r\nresults, but were observing, most of them at least, the simple fact of\r\nthe celerity of action. Then, their result is an affirmation or positive\r\nstatement, and his merely a negative one: They may perfectly well have\r\nobserved what he was not so fortunate as to witness. And lastly, it is\r\nnot unreasonable to claim for Sir B. Brodie, Dr. Freer, Mr. Macaulay,\r\nand Mr. Taylor, all of them practitioners of experience, the faculty of\r\nnoting time as accurately as Mr. Blake himself. As for my own\r\nobservations, I feel confident they could not have been made more\r\ncarefully, and that I had at the moment no preconceived views which the\r\nresults upheld, but, if anything, rather the reverse.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible therefore to concede, that Mr. Blake’s inquiries,\r\nmerely because they are at variance with prior results, apparently not\r\nless precise and exact than his own, put an end to the argument which\r\nhas been drawn, in favour of the existence of a sympathetic action, from\r\nthe extreme swiftness of the operation of some poisons. At the same\r\ntime, on a dispassionate view of the whole investigation, it must be\r\ngranted to be doubtful, whether this argument can be now appealed to in\r\nits present shape with the confidence which is desirable. And on the\r\nwhole, the velocity of the circulation on the one hand, and the celerity\r\nof the action of certain poisons on the other, are both of them so very\r\ngreat, and the comparative observation of the time occupied by the two\r\nphenomena respectively becomes in consequence so difficult and\r\nprecarious, that it seems unsafe to found upon such an inquiry a\r\nconfident deduction on either side of so important a physiological\r\nquestion as the existence or non-existence of an action of poisons by\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nIn concluding these statements it is necessary to notice certain\r\npositive arguments which have been brought against the doctrine of\r\nnervous transmission.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged to be contrary to nature’s rule to adopt two ways of\r\nattaining the same end; and therefore, that, since many poisons\r\nundoubtedly act through absorption, it is unphilosophical to hold that\r\nothers act by sympathy. There seems no sound reason, however, for thus\r\nimposing arbitrary limits on the functional powers conferred by nature\r\non the organs of the animal body. And besides, the presumption thus\r\nderived is counterbalanced by the equally plausible supposition,\r\nthat,—since nature has clearly established an action on remote organs\r\nthrough the medium of the nerves in the case of poisons which cause\r\ndestruction or inflammation of the tissues to which they are\r\napplied,—the same medium of action may also exist in the instance of\r\npoisons which produce merely a peculiar nervous impression where they\r\nare applied.\r\n\r\nBut it is farther alleged, that poisons of the most energetic action\r\nhave no effect, when they are applied to a part, the connection of which\r\nwith the general system is maintained by nerves only. It is true that\r\npoisons seem to have no effect whatever when the circulation of the part\r\nto which they are applied has been arrested, or when every connecting\r\ntissue has been severed except the nerves. Thus Emmert found that the\r\nwourali poison does not act on an animal when introduced into a limb\r\nconnected with the body by nerves alone.[18] And I have ascertained that\r\nin the same circumstances no effect is produced on the dog by pure\r\nhydrocyanic acid dropped into the cellular tissue of the paw. But it\r\ncannot be inferred absolutely from these facts, that the wourali poison\r\nand hydrocyanic acid do not act through sympathy; because it has been\r\nurged that the integrity of the functions of the sentient extremities of\r\nthe nerves, more especially their capability of receiving those nervous\r\nimpressions which are held to be communicated backwards along their\r\ncourse, may be interrupted by arresting the circulation of the part.\r\nStill, as the function of sensation is maintained for some time in a\r\nsevered limb connected with the trunk by nerves only, there is a\r\nprobability, that all other functions of the nerves must be retained for\r\na time also. And the presumption thus arising is strengthened by an\r\nimperfect experiment performed by Mr. Blake, which tends to show,\r\nalthough it does not absolutely prove, that a poison, introduced into\r\nthe severed limb whose nervous connection with the trunk is entire, will\r\nnot act, even if the blood be allowed to enter the limb by its artery\r\nand to escape from a wound in its vein, so that local circulation is in\r\nsome measure maintained, without the blood returning to the trunk and\r\ngeneral system.[19]\r\n\r\nOn considering impartially all the facts that have been adduced in this\r\ninquiry, an impression must be felt that the doctrine of the sympathetic\r\naction of those poisons which produce merely a nervous local impression\r\nis insecurely founded. But an _experimentum crucis_ is still wanted to\r\ndecide the question.\r\n\r\n2. _Of the Action of Poisons through Absorption._—If doubts may be\r\nentertained whether poisons ever act by the transmission of local\r\nimpulses, from the part to which they are applied, along the nerves to\r\nthe organ upon which they act, no reasonable doubt can be entertained\r\nthat many poisons act through the medium of absorption into the blood.\r\n\r\nPoisons are believed to act through the blood for the following reasons.\r\nFirst, they disappear during life from the shut cavities or other\r\nsituations into which they have been introduced; that is, they are\r\nabsorbed. Several clear examples to this effect have been related by Dr.\r\nCoindet and myself in our paper on oxalic acid. In one experiment four\r\nounces of a solution of oxalic acid were injected into the peritoneal\r\nsac of a cat, and killed it in fourteen minutes; yet, on opening the\r\nanimal, although none of the fluid had escaped by the wound, we found\r\nscarcely a drachm remaining.[20] In recent times Professor Orfila has\r\nproved that various poisons, such as arsenic, tartar-emetic, and acetate\r\nof lead, disappear in part or wholly from wounds into which they had\r\nbeen introduced.[21] Next, many poisons act with unimpaired rapidity,\r\nwhen the nerves supplying the part to which they are applied have been\r\npreviously divided, or even when the part is attached to the body by\r\narteries and veins only. Dr. Monro, _secundus_, proved this in regard to\r\nopium;[22] and the same fact has been since extended by Sir B. Brodie\r\nand Professor Emmert to wourali,[23] by Magendie to nux vomica,[24] by\r\nCoullon to hydrocyanic acid,[25] by Charret to opium,[26] and by Dr.\r\nCoindet and myself to diluted oxalic acid.[27] Magendie’s experiment was\r\nthe most precise of all: for, besides the communication with the\r\npoisoned part being kept up by a vein and an artery only, these vessels\r\nwere also severed and reconnected by two quills. Farther, many poisons\r\nwill not act when they are applied to a part of which the circulation\r\nhas been arrested, even although all its other connections with the body\r\nhave been left entire. This has been shown distinctly by Emmert in\r\nregard to the hydrocyanic acid; which, when introduced into the hind-leg\r\nof an animal after the abdominal aorta has been tied, produces no effect\r\ntill the ligature be removed, but then acts with rapidity.[28] An\r\nexperiment of a similar nature performed by Mr. Blake with the wourali\r\npoison yielded the same result.[29] Again, many poisons act with a force\r\nproportional to the absorbing power of the texture with which they are\r\nplaced in contact. This is the criterion which has been commonly\r\nresorted to for discovering whether a poison acts through the medium of\r\nthe blood. It is applicable, however, only when the poison acts sensibly\r\nin small doses; for those which act but in large doses cannot be applied\r\nin the same space of time over equal surfaces of different textures. The\r\ndifference in the absorbing power of the different tissues has been well\r\nascertained in respect to a few of them only. The most rapid channel of\r\nabsorption is by a wound, or by immediate injection into a vein; the\r\nsurface of the serous membranes is a less rapid medium, and the mucous\r\nmembrane of the alimentary canal is still less rapid. Now it is proved\r\nof many poisons that, when applied in similar circumstances to these\r\nseveral parts or tissues, their activity is proportional to the order\r\nnow laid down. Lastly, it has been proved of nux-vomica, that if the\r\nextract be thrust into the paw of an animal after a ligature has been\r\ntightened round the leg so as to stop the venous, but not the arterial\r\ncirculation of the limb, blood drawn from an orifice in a vein between\r\nthe wound and the ligature, and transfused into the vein of another\r\nanimal, will excite in the latter the usual effects of the poison, so as\r\neven to cause death; while, on the contrary, the animal from which the\r\nblood has been taken will not be affected at all, if a sufficient\r\nquantity be withdrawn before the removal of the ligature. These\r\ninteresting facts, which are capable of important practical\r\napplications, were ascertained by M. Vernière.[30]\r\n\r\nOn weighing attentively the arguments here brought forward, it seems\r\nimpossible to doubt, that some poisons are absorbed into the blood\r\nbefore they act, and that their entrance into the blood is not a mere\r\nfortuitous antecedent, but a condition essential to their action.\r\n\r\nBut it is farther held that poisons which act through absorption, do so\r\nby being conveyed in substance along with the blood to the part where\r\ntheir action is developed,—that their action eventually depends on the\r\norgan, whose functions are thrown into disorder, becoming impregnated\r\nwith poisoned blood. Now, the arguments detailed above do not absolutely\r\nprove this conveyance and impregnation. They show that poisons enter the\r\nblood, and act somehow in consequence of entering it; but they do not\r\nprove in what manner the action subsequently takes place.\r\n\r\nIt was at one time indeed supposed that the same facts, which prove\r\ntheir admission into the blood, proved also their transmission in\r\nsubstance to the organs acted on by them. But Dr. Addison and Mr. Morgan\r\nhave shown that this is not a legitimate conclusion, and that a\r\ndifferent theoretical view may be taken of the facts,—namely, that the\r\naction may really take place by the poison producing on the sentient\r\nextremities of the nerves of the inner membrane of the blood-vessels a\r\npeculiar impression which is conveyed through the nerves to the part\r\nultimately affected.[31] They have endeavoured to found this theory upon\r\nevidence, that the poison is not carried beyond the venous system; or\r\nthat, if conveyed farther, it is carried incidentally, and not for the\r\npurpose of impregnating the textures of the organ which suffers. The\r\nevidence they have brought forward on this head is chiefly the\r\nfollowing. 1. Poisons which act on a particular organ at a distance do\r\nnot act more quickly when introduced into the artery which supplies it,\r\nthan when introduced into its vein, or even into the principal artery of\r\na distant part of the body.[32] 2. If a poison be introduced into a\r\ngreat vein with a provision for preventing its passage towards the\r\nheart, it will act with as great rapidity, as if no obstacle of the kind\r\nexisted. Thus, if the jugular vein, secured by two temporary ligatures,\r\nbe divided between them and reconnected by a tube containing wourali,\r\nthe animal will not be affected more quickly on the removal of both\r\nligatures, than on removing only the ligature farthest from the\r\nheart.[33] 3. The arterial blood of a poisoned animal is incapable of\r\naffecting another animal. Thus, if the carotid artery and jugular vein\r\nof one dog be divided, and both ends of each reciprocally connected by\r\ntubes with the divided ends of the corresponding vessels of another dog,\r\nand extract of nux-vomica be introduced into a wound in the face of one\r\nof them,—the animal directly poisoned alone perishes, and the other\r\nremains unharmed to the last.[34]\r\n\r\nThese are at first view strong arguments against the transmission of\r\npoisons with the blood to the organs remotely acted on; and the facts on\r\nwhich they are founded are on the other hand easily explained under the\r\nnew theory advanced by the authors, that the medium of action is the\r\nnerves which supply the inner membrane of the blood-vessels. But their\r\ninquiries, however ingenious and plausible, have not stood the test of\r\nphysiological scrutiny. Their first experimental fact has been\r\ncontradicted by Mr. Blake; who has found that the wourali poison, which\r\ndoes not begin to act for twenty seconds when injected into a vein, will\r\nproduce obvious effects in seven seconds only if injected into the aorta\r\nthrough the axillary artery.[35] The second experiment, showing that\r\npoison confined in a vein will act although prevented by a ligature from\r\nreaching the heart, is held by the opponents of Dr. Addison and Mr.\r\nMorgan to be fallacious, in as much as the blood behind the ligature may\r\nbe carried backwards till it meets with an anastomosing vein and is so\r\ncarried by a collateral vessel to the heart. To the third experiment it\r\nmay be objected, that there was, in the mode in which they conducted it,\r\nno satisfactory evidence that the reciprocal circulation was kept up by\r\nthe carotid artery and jugular vein. And this will appear an important\r\nobjection to every one practically acquainted with experiments of\r\ntransfusion. For on the one hand it is exceedingly difficult, in such\r\ncomplicated experiments, to prevent coagulation of the blood in one\r\nvessel or another, before the connection of all the arteries and veins\r\nis established; and on the other, it may be urged, as Mr. Blake has\r\ndone, that the pressure of the blood in the distal end of the carotid\r\nartery in the animal not directly poisoned may be equal, or even\r\nsuperior, to the pressure in the proximal end of the same vessel in the\r\nother animal,—so that the blood may not pass from the latter into the\r\nformer, although it should continue fluid.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the theory of Dr. Addison and Mr. Morgan, and in\r\nsupport of the doctrine, that poisons act by being carried in substance\r\nwith the blood into the tissues of the remote organs on which they act,\r\na variety of important experimental evidence has been brought forward\r\nsince the publications of the Essay of these gentlemen. In the first\r\nplace, the concurrent testimony of a great number of recent chemical\r\ninquirers establishes undeniably, that poisons absorbed into the veins\r\nof the part to which they are applied are to be detected throughout many\r\nof the tissues of distant organs. This fact will be enlarged on and\r\nillustrated presently. Secondly, on the authority of Mr. Blake, and in\r\ncontradiction of the experiments of Dr. Addison and Mr. Morgan, it\r\nappears that, as already stated, poisons act more quickly when injected\r\ninto the aorta than into the venous system; a fact which is easily\r\nunderstood, on considering that when injected into the aorta they reach\r\ntheir destination directly, whereas, if injected into a vein they must\r\nfirst arrive at the right side of the heart, and then be transmitted\r\nthrough the circle of the pulmonary circulation before reaching even the\r\naorta. Thirdly, the relative rapidity with which poisons act on\r\ndifferent animals follows the ratio of the velocity of the circulation\r\nin each. Thus, Mr. Blake found, that in the horse nitrate of baryta is\r\nconveyed by the circulation from the jugular vein to the carotid artery\r\nin sixteen seconds, and that strychnia injected into the jugular vein\r\nbegins to act on the nervous system after exactly the same interval:\r\nThat in the dog chloride of barium passes from the vein to the artery in\r\nseven seconds, and extract of nux-vomica begins to act as a poison in\r\ntwelve seconds: That in the fowl the passage of the blood seems to take\r\nplace in six seconds, and the nitrate of strychnia to act in six seconds\r\nand a half: And that in the rabbit the passage of the blood is effected\r\nin four seconds only, and the first signs of the action of strychnia\r\noccur in four seconds and a half.[36]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, it may be considered as well established, that\r\nprobably all, but certainly some, poisons,—of the kind whose topical\r\naction does not consist in causing destruction or inflammation of the\r\ntextures to which they are applied,—produce their remote effects solely\r\nby entering the blood, and through its means impregnating the organs\r\nwhich are acted on at a distance. And farther, if this doctrine be\r\nadmitted as established, it may also be allowed, that many poisons which\r\ndo cause topically destruction or inflammation, and remotely the usual\r\nsympathetic effects of these changes of structure, also possess the\r\npower of affecting distant organs through the medium of the blood.\r\n\r\n_Of the discovery of Poisons in the Blood._—Such being the case, it\r\nbecomes an object of paramount interest, with reference both to the\r\npractice of medical jurisprudence, to inquire whether poisons can be\r\ndetected in the circulating fluids, or generally in parts of the body\r\nremote from the place where they are introduced.\r\n\r\nA variety of circumstances long rendered it impossible to determine\r\nsatisfactorily the question, whether poisons could be detected in the\r\nblood, the secretions, and the soft textures of the body. In the first\r\nplace, we now know that the quantity of the more active poisons, which\r\nis required to occasion death, is so small, that, considering the\r\ncrude methods of analysis formerly trusted to, and the obstacles\r\nopposed to the successful application of them by the presence of\r\norganic matter, there can be no wonder that chemists, even but a few\r\nyears ago, could not satisfy themselves whether the objects they were\r\nin search of had been detected or not. Then, it was partly known\r\nbefore, and is now fully established, that various poisons are removed\r\nbeyond the reach of analysis before death, in consequence of passing\r\noff with the secretions, particularly the urine. Farther, it seems\r\nprobable that, of the poisons which act through absorption, several do\r\nnot remain or at least do not accumulate, in the blood; and that they\r\nare not distributed with it throughout the textures indifferently, but\r\nare deposited, as absorption goes on, in particular organs, such as\r\nthe liver,—which it was not much the practice to examine in former\r\ninvestigations. And lastly, some poisons are speedily decomposed on\r\nentering the blood: They either cause obvious changes in the\r\nconstitution of the blood, and themselves undergo alteration likewise;\r\nor without the blood becoming appreciably different in its properties\r\nfrom the healthy state, the poison undergoes a rapid change in the\r\nmolecular affinities of its elements, and so disappears. Of the former\r\ncourse of things distinct illustrations are furnished by nitric oxide\r\ngas and sulphuretted-hydrogen gas when injected into a vein in a\r\nliving animal: of the latter an equally unequivocal example occurs in\r\noxalic acid, which Dr. Coindet and I found to be undiscoverable in the\r\nblood of the vena cava of a dog killed in thirty seconds by the\r\ninjection of eight grains and a half of it into the femoral vein.\r\n\r\nBut the improvements that have been lately made in the methods of\r\nanalysis for the detection of poisons in a state of complex mixture with\r\norganic substances have done away with a great part of the obstacles\r\nwhich prevented a thorough inquiry as to the existence of poisons in the\r\nblood and textures of the body. Some important researches of this kind\r\nwere referred to in the last edition of the present work; and since then\r\nmany additional facts, of equal variety and precision, have been\r\ncommunicated by different observers, but especially by Professor Orfila.\r\nUnder the head of each poison an account will be given hereafter of the\r\nevidence in support of the discovery of it by chemical analysis in the\r\nblood, textures, and excretions. In the present place it is sufficient\r\nto state in general terms that the evidence is quite satisfactory in the\r\ninstances of iodine, sal-ammoniac, oxalic acid, nitre, sulphuret of\r\npotassium, arsenic, mercury, copper, antimony, tin, silver, zinc,\r\nbismuth, lead, hydrocyanic acid, cyanide of potassium, carbazotic acid,\r\nsulphuretted-hydrogen, camphor, and alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Of the Organs affected by the remote action of Poisons._—Having now\r\ntaken a general view of the mode in which poisons act on distant parts,\r\nI shall next consider what organs are thus brought under their\r\noperation. Poisons have been often, but erroneously, said to affect\r\nremotely the general system. A few of them, such as arsenic and mercury,\r\ndo indeed appear to affect very many organs of the body. But by much the\r\nlarger proportion seem on the contrary to act on one or more organs\r\nonly, not on the general system.\r\n\r\nOf the poisons which act remotely through a sympathy of distant parts\r\nwith an organic injury of the textures directly acted on, many appear to\r\nact sympathetically on the heart alone. Taking the mineral acids as the\r\npurest examples of poisons that act independently of absorption into the\r\nblood-vessels, it will be seen on inquiry that all the symptoms they\r\nproduce, in addition to the direct effects of the local injury, are\r\nthose of depressed action of the heart,—great feebleness, fainting,\r\nimperceptible pulse, cold extremities. Even the less prominent of the\r\nsecondary symptoms are almost all referrible to a depressed state of the\r\ncirculation. In particular, they are not necessarily, and indeed are\r\nseldom actually, blended with any material symptom of disorder in the\r\nbrain; which certainly could not be the case if the general or whole\r\nsystem suffered.\r\n\r\nWith respect to that more numerous class, which act remotely either\r\nthrough the medium of the blood or by the transmission along the nerves\r\nof an undiscernible impression made on their sentient extremities, some\r\ncertainly possess a very extended influence over the great organs of the\r\nbody; but the greater number are much more limited in their sphere of\r\naction. Some act chiefly by enfeebling or paralyzing the heart, others\r\nprincipally by obstructing the pulmonary capillaries, others by\r\nobstructing the capillaries of the general system, others by stimulating\r\nor depressing the functions of the brain or of the spinal cord, others\r\nby irritating the alimentary canal, others by stimulating one or another\r\nof the glandular organs, such as the salivary glands, the liver, the\r\nkidneys, or the lymphatic glands.\r\n\r\nSome poisons of this kind act chiefly, if not solely, on the _heart_.\r\nThe best examples are infusion of tobacco, and upas antiar. Sir B.\r\nBrodie observed, that when the infusion of tobacco was injected into any\r\npart of the body, it speedily caused great faintness and sinking of the\r\npulse; and on examining the body instantly after death, he found the\r\nheart distended and paralyzed, not excitable even by galvanism, and its\r\naortal cavities filled not with black, but with florid blood, while the\r\nvoluntary muscles were as irritable as after other kinds of death.[37]\r\nThe upas antiar he found to be similarly circumstanced.[38] Arsenic and\r\noxalic acid are also of this kind. In an animal killed by arsenic, and\r\nin which the gullet and voluntary muscles continued long contractile,\r\nDr. Campbell found the heart immediately after death containing arterial\r\nblood in its aortal cavities, and insensible to galvanism.[39] Dr.\r\nCoindet and I frequently witnessed the same facts in animals killed with\r\noxalic acid: When the heart at the moment of death was completely\r\npalsied and deprived of irritability, we saw the intestines moving, and\r\nthe voluntary muscles contracting long and vigorously from the mere\r\ncontact of the air.[40]\r\n\r\nAn interesting series of investigations has been lately made by Mr.\r\nBlake, relative to the influence of poisons on the heart, when they are\r\ndirectly introduced into the great veins. It does not absolutely follow\r\nthat an action on the heart manifested in this way proves the occurrence\r\nof a similar action when the substance is admitted into the body through\r\nmore ordinary channels, such as the stomach, intestines or cellular\r\ntissue. For on the one hand, some of the substances used by this\r\nphysiologist cannot be admitted into the blood through ordinary channels\r\nin the quantity necessary for developing that action on the heart, which\r\nis excited when they are injected at once into the blood-vessels. And on\r\nthe other hand, the results at which he thus arrives are not always in\r\nconformity with what have been obtained by prior observers, who resorted\r\nto the ordinary channels for introducing poisons into the body. It is\r\npossible, therefore, that Mr. Blake’s researches may not have the\r\nextensive bearings, which might at first sight appear, on the physiology\r\nof poisons and remedies. Nevertheless they are in themselves full of\r\ninterest. They show that the salts of magnesia, zinc, copper, lime,\r\nstrontia, baryta, lead, silver, ammonia, and potash, also oxalic acid,\r\nand digitalis, if injected into the jugular vein, produce a powerful and\r\npermanent depression of the heart’s action; which is evinced by the\r\nhæmadynamometer,[41] indicating diminution of pressure in the great\r\narteries, by the heart becoming motionless or nearly so before the\r\nbreathing ceases, by its muscular structure presenting little or no\r\nirritability when stimulated immediately after death, and by the left\r\ncavities being found full of florid arterial blood.[41]\r\n\r\nOther poisons act on the _lungs_; but probably few, perhaps none, act on\r\nthem alone. Magendie found that in poisoning with tartar-emetic the\r\nlungs are commonly inflamed and sometimes even hepatized.[42] Mr. Smith\r\nand M. Orfila both remarked similar signs of pulmonary inflammation in\r\nanimals poisoned with corrosive sublimate.[43] But these poisons produce\r\nimportant effects on other organs likewise.\r\n\r\nA set of novel and important facts setting forth the frequent operation\r\nof poisons on the lungs when they are admitted directly into the blood,\r\nhas been recently brought to light by the researches of Mr. Blake. Many\r\nof the poisons mentioned above as acting powerfully on the heart were\r\nfound by him not to exert any influence upon the lungs, such as oxalic\r\nacid and the salts of magnesia, lime, zinc, copper, ammonia, potash, and\r\nstrychnia. Others, however, such as the salts of strontia, baryta, lead,\r\nand silver, as well as digitalis, all of which powerfully affect the\r\nheart, and, in addition to these, the salts of soda, which have no\r\naction at all on the heart, and hydrocyanic acid, tobacco, and\r\neuphorbium, which influence it feebly, or even dubiously,—produce, when\r\ninjected into the jugular vein, obstruction of the capillaries of the\r\npulmonary circulation, and consequently asphyxia. This is proved by the\r\nhæmadynamometer introduced into a vein indicating great increase of\r\npressure in the venous circulation a few seconds after the introduction\r\nof the poison; by this instrument introduced into the femoral artery\r\nindicating great diminution of arterial pressure, although the heart\r\ncontinues to beat vigorously; by the breathing becoming at the same time\r\nlaborious, without the heart suffering; by these symptoms preceding any\r\nsigns of action on the nervous system; by the heart pulsating for some\r\ntime after death; and in many instances by frothy mucus having\r\naccumulated in the air-passages, and congestion and extravasation having\r\ntaken place in the lungs themselves.[44]\r\n\r\nA great number of the poisons whose action is remote, operate on the\r\n_brain_. The most decided proof of such an action is the nature of the\r\nsymptoms; which are, giddiness, delirium, insensibility, convulsions,\r\npalsy, coma. Some physiologists have also sought for evidence in the\r\nbody after death, and have imagined they found it in congestion of the\r\nvessels in the brain, and even extravasation of blood there; but it will\r\nbe seen under the head of Narcotic Poisons that such appearances are far\r\nfrom being essential, and indeed are seldom witnessed. All narcotic\r\npoisons act on the brain, and most narcotico-acrids too; but very\r\nfrequently other organs are affected at the same time, and in particular\r\nthe spine and heart.\r\n\r\nThe influence of poisons on the brain seems to be sometimes induced, not\r\nimmediately, but indirectly through the intervention of a more direct\r\ninfluence on the pulmonary circulation. Thus Mr. Blake appears to have\r\nsucceeded in proving that the insensibility and tetanic convulsions\r\nwhich immediately precede death, when certain substances, such as the\r\nsalts of soda, are injected into the veins, depend simply on the\r\nobstruction directly produced in the pulmonary circulation causing\r\nincreased pressure in the systemic veins, and consequently upon the\r\nbrain and nervous centre generally. For when the jugular vein was opened\r\nafter the development of tetanic convulsions, and blood was allowed to\r\nflow out, the nervous symptoms ceased, and the animal continued for two\r\nhours sensible and without any return of convulsions, dying eventually\r\nof hemorrhage.[45] But more generally the effect produced on the brain\r\nis direct and specific. Thus opium and its active principle morphia\r\nsuspend the functions of external relation, which are peculiarly\r\ndependent on the brain; while for a long time the respiration and\r\ncirculation are little affected. Even when the poison is admitted\r\ndirectly into the veins, the pulmonary capillaries are not obstructed,\r\nand the heart is only somewhat enfeebled in its contractions;[46] and in\r\nordinary cases of poisoning with these substances the heart continues to\r\npulsate, and the lungs also discharge their office, long after\r\nsensibility is extinguished and voluntary motion arrested,—until at\r\nlength the circulation and respiration become affected consecutively by\r\nthe depressed state of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nSome poisons act specifically on the _spinal cord_. Those which are best\r\nknown to possess such an action are nux-vomica, the other species of\r\nplants which, like it, contain strychnia, and also conia and the wourali\r\npoison. The tribe of poisons of which nux-vomica may be taken as the\r\ntype excite violent fits of tetanus, during the intervals of which the\r\nmind and external senses are quite entire; and death takes place during\r\na paroxysm, apparently from suffocation caused by spasmodic fixing of\r\nthe chest. Their action on the spine is quite independent of any action\r\non the brain; if indeed such action exist at all. For when the spinal\r\ncord is separated from the brain by dividing the medulla oblongata, the\r\neffects on the muscles supplied by the spinal cord are produced as\r\nusual.[47] Conia, the active principle of hemlock, according to my own\r\nresearches, produces in the lower animals, howsoever introduced,\r\ngradually increasing paralysis, without insensibility or delirium, and\r\nwithout the circulation or respiration being for some time affected,\r\ntill at length death takes place from stoppage of the breathing by palsy\r\nof the respiratory muscles; and after death the heart continues beating\r\nvigorously, the muscles contract when irritated, and arterialization of\r\nthe blood in the lungs may be kept up long by maintaining artificial\r\nrespiration. In this instance it would appear, that the first effect is\r\narrestment of the functions of the spinal cord; that the paralysis does\r\nnot depend upon a direct action on the muscles; and that neither the\r\nbrain, heart, nor lungs can be influenced, except secondarily through\r\nthe consequences of general muscular paralysis.[48] Many poisons which\r\nact on the brain also act on the spinal cord.\r\n\r\nOther poisons apparently possess the singular property of impeding or\r\narresting the _general capillary circulation_, and produce their\r\ntangible effects more or less through the medium of this operation. Such\r\nat least are the inferences which seem to flow from the researches of\r\nMr. Blake; who found that many substances, soon after they are injected\r\nbackwards by the axillary artery into the aorta, produce increased\r\npressure in the arterial system indicated by the hæmadynamometer during\r\nlife, and frequently congestion of the membranous textures as observed\r\nafter death. Some substances have no effect of this kind. Others act on\r\nthe general capillaries in concurrence with a similar action on the\r\ncapillaries of the pulmonary circulation, such as the salts of strontia,\r\nbaryta, lead, silver, and soda, euphorbium, tobacco and digitalis. But a\r\nfew, such as potash and ammonia, with their salts, seem to influence the\r\ncapillaries of the general circulation only.[49] These are important\r\nconclusions, if legitimate; but it cannot be denied, that the facts on\r\nwhich they are based must be very difficult to isolate and observe with\r\naccuracy and without bias.\r\n\r\nThe organs not immediately necessary to life may be likewise all acted\r\non by poisons indirectly. On this subject details are not called for at\r\npresent. It may be sufficient to remark that there is hardly a\r\nconsiderable organ in the body, except perhaps the spleen and pancreas,\r\nwhich is not acted on by one poison or another. Arsenic inflames the\r\nalimentary mucous membrane, mercury the salivary organs and mouth,\r\ncantharides the urinary organs, chromate of potass the conjunctiva of\r\nthe eyes, manganese the liver; iodine acts on the lymphatic glands; lead\r\non the muscles; and spurred rye causes gangrene of the limbs.\r\n\r\nSome poisons, as was already mentioned, may act on one important organ\r\nonly, every other being left undisturbed: thus nux-vomica in general\r\nacts only on the spine. But much more commonly they act on several\r\norgans at once; and the action of some of them is complicated in an\r\nextreme degree. I may instance oxalic acid and arsenic. Oxalic acid when\r\nswallowed irritates and inflames the stomach directly, and acts\r\nindirectly on the brain, the spine, and the heart. A large dose causes\r\nsudden death by paralyzing the heart; if the dose is somewhat less, the\r\nleading symptom is violent tetanic spasm, indicating an action on the\r\nspine, and death takes place during a paroxysm, the heart continuing to\r\ncontract for some time after; if the dose is still less, the spasms, at\r\nfirst distinct, become by degrees fainter and fainter, while the\r\nsensibility in the intervals, at first unimpaired, becomes gradually\r\nclouded, till at length pure coma is formed without convulsions,—thus\r\nindicating an action on the brain. As for arsenic, coupling together the\r\nsymptoms during life and the appearances in the dead body, it will be\r\nseen afterwards to have the power of acting on the brain, heart, and\r\nlungs,—the throat, gullet, stomach, and intestines,—the lining membrane\r\nof the nostrils and eyelids,—the kidneys, bladder, and vagina; and, what\r\nis remarkable, proofs of an action on all these parts may be witnessed\r\nin the course of a single case. The effects of mercury are hardly less\r\nmultifarious.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SECTION II.—_On the Causes which modify the Actions of Poisons._\r\n\r\nBy a variety of causes the action of poisons may be modified both in\r\ndegree and in kind. The most important of them are—quantity; state of\r\naggregation; state of chemical combination; mixture; difference in\r\ntissue; difference in organ; habit; idiosyncrasy; and lastly, certain\r\nstates of disease.\r\n\r\n1. _Quantity_ affects their action materially. Not only do they produce\r\ntheir effects more rapidly in large doses; it is sometimes even quite\r\naltered in kind. A striking example has just been related in the case of\r\noxalic acid; which, according to the dose, may corrode the stomach, or\r\nact on the heart, or on the spine, or on the brain. In like manner\r\narsenic in a small dose may cause gastritis of several days’ duration;\r\nwhile a large dose may prove fatal in two or three hours by affecting\r\nthe action of the heart. White hellebore in small doses excites\r\ninflammation in the stomach and bowels, in larger doses giddiness,\r\nconvulsions, coma; and in either way it may prove fatal.\r\n\r\n2. _As to state of aggregation_,—poisons act the more energetically the\r\nmore minutely they are divided, and hence most energetically when in\r\nsolution. Some which are very energetic in the fluid state, hardly act\r\nat all when undissolved. Morphia, the alkaloid of opium, may be given in\r\npowder to a dog without injury in a dose, which, if dissolved in oil or\r\nalcohol, would soon kill several. Previously dissolving poisons favours\r\ntheir action in two ways,—by diffusing them quickly over a large\r\nsurface, and by fitting them for entering the bibulous vessels. Poisons,\r\nbefore being absorbed, must be dissolved; and hence, those which act\r\nthough solid and insoluble in water, must, as a preliminary step, be\r\ndissolved by the animal fluids at the mouths of the vessels. In this way\r\nthe poisonous effects of carbonate of baryta and arsenite of copper are\r\nexplained; for though insoluble in water, they are soluble in the juices\r\nof the stomach.\r\n\r\nDifferences in aggregation, like differences in quantity, may affect the\r\nkind as well as the degree of action. Camphor in fragments commonly\r\ncauses inflammation of the stomach; dissolved in spirit or olive oil, it\r\ncauses delirium or tetanus and coma.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of certain poisons to the state of vapour serves the same\r\nend as dissolving them. When poisons are to be introduced by the skin,\r\nno previous operation is more effectual than that of converting them\r\ninto vapour.\r\n\r\n3. The next modifying cause is _chemical combination_. This is sometimes\r\nnothing more than a variety of the last. If a poison, in combining with\r\nanother substance, acquire greater solubility, it also generally\r\nacquires greater activity, and _vice versa_: Morphia, itself almost\r\ninert, because insoluble, becomes active by uniting with acids, for they\r\nrender it very soluble: Baryta as a very active poison, becomes quite\r\ninert by uniting with sulphuric acid, for the sulphate of baryta is\r\naltogether insoluble.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the influence of chemical combination two general laws may\r\nbe laid down. One is, that _poisons which only act locally, have their\r\naction much impaired or even neutralized, in their chemical\r\ncombinations_. Sulphuric acid and muriatic acid on the one hand, and the\r\ntwo fixed alkalis on the other, possess a violent local action; but if\r\nthey are united so as to form sulphates or muriates, although still very\r\nsoluble, they become merely gentle laxatives. But the case is altered if\r\neither of the combining poisons also act by entering the blood. For the\r\nsecond general law is, that _the action of poisons which operate by\r\nentering the blood, although it may be somewhat lessened, cannot be\r\ndestroyed or altered in their chemical combinations_. Morphia acts like\r\nopium if dissolved in alcohol or fixed oil; if an acid be substituted as\r\nthe solvent, a salt is formed which is endowed with the same properties:\r\nThe sulphate, muriate, nitrate, acetate of morphia all act like opium.\r\nStrychnia, arsenic, hydrocyanic acid, oxalic acid, and many more come\r\nunder the same denomination: Each produces its peculiar effects, with\r\nwhatever substance it is combined, provided it do not become insoluble.\r\n\r\nMr. Blake has recently laid down what may be considered a branch or\r\ncorollary of the second of these general propositions, and has confirmed\r\nit by many appropriate experimental facts,—namely, that _the salts of\r\nthe same base produce the same actions, independently of the acids with\r\nwhich they are combined_.[50] The law, however, is a more general one,\r\nas given above, and was stated in former editions of the present work.\r\nIt applies not only to bases, but likewise to acids, such as the\r\nhydrocyanic, oxalic, arsenious, and arsenic acids, and also to neutral\r\norganic principles which act through the blood, such as picrotoxin,\r\ncolocynthin, elaterin, and narcotin.\r\n\r\nThe same author considers it to be also a probable conclusion from a\r\nvariety of experiments on the salts of various bases, that _those salts\r\nwhich are isomorphous, or possess the same crystalline form, are closely\r\nallied in action_.[51]\r\n\r\n4. The effect of _mixture_ depends partly on the poisons being diluted.\r\nDilution, by prolonging the time necessary for their being absorbed,\r\ncommonly lessens their activity; yet not always; for if a poison which\r\nacts through the blood is also a powerful irritant, moderate dilution\r\nwill enable it to enter the vessels more easily: a small dose of\r\nconcentrated oxalic acid acts feebly as an irritant or corrosive;\r\nmoderately diluted, it quickly enters the blood and causes speedy\r\ndeath.[52] The effect of mixture may depend also in part on the mere\r\nmechanical impediment interposed between the poison and the animal\r\nmembranes. This is particularly obvious when the mass containing the\r\npoison is solid or pulpy; for then the first portions of the poison that\r\ntouch the membrane may cause an effort of the organ to discharge the\r\nrest beyond the sphere of action,—if, for example, it is the stomach,—by\r\nvomiting. The effect of mixture in interposing a mechanical impediment\r\nis also well illustrated where the substance mixed with the poison is a\r\nfine, insoluble powder, capable of enveloping its several particles.\r\nThus it is that small, yet poisonous doses of arsenic may be swallowed\r\nand retained with impunity, if mixed with finely powdered charcoal,\r\nmagnesia, and probably cinchona-bark, or the like. Besides diluting and\r\nmechanically obstructing their application, the admixture of other\r\nsubstances may alter the chemical nature of poisons, and so change their\r\naction.\r\n\r\nIt is important to keep in view, that the influence of mixture may be\r\nexerted in consequence of the cavity into which a poison is introduced\r\nbeing at the time filled with contents. Some of the most powerful and\r\nunerring poisons may in such circumstances altogether fail to produce\r\ntheir usual effect, if speedily vomited. Thus Wibmer notices the case of\r\na man, who swallowed an ounce and a half of arsenic after a very hearty\r\nmeal, had merely a severe attack of vomiting with subsequent colic, and\r\ngot quite well in four days.[53] And a still more pointed instance has\r\nbeen briefly mentioned by Dr. Booth of Birmingham, where an ounce of\r\ncorrosive sublimate was swallowed after a full meal without any material\r\nill consequence, vomiting having been speedily induced.[54]\r\n\r\n5. _Difference of tissue_ is an interesting modifying power in a\r\nphysiological point of view, but does not bear so directly on\r\nmedico-legal practice as the rest, and may therefore be passed over\r\ncursorily.\r\n\r\nOn the corrosives and irritants a difference of tissue acts but\r\nindirectly: their effects vary not so much with the tissue as with the\r\norgan of which it forms part. But as to poisons which act through the\r\nblood, their energy must evidently depend on the activity of absorption\r\nin each texture.\r\n\r\nThe cutaneous absorption is slow, on account of the obstacle presented\r\nby the cuticle, and by the intricate capillaries of the true skin.\r\nAccordingly many active poisons are quite inert when applied to the\r\nunbroken skin, or even to the skin deprived of the cuticle. Hydrocyanic\r\nacid, perhaps the most subtle of all poisons, was found by Coullon to\r\nhave no effect when dropped on the skin of a dog.[55] Some authors have\r\neven gone so far as to deny that poisons can be absorbed at all through\r\nthe skin, unless they are pressed by friction through the cuticle. But\r\nthis is an error; most gaseous poisons, such as carbonic acid and\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, and some solid poisons when volatilized, such as\r\nthe vapours of cinnabar, will act though simply placed in contact with\r\nthe skin; and there is distinct evidence that corrosive sublimate will\r\nbring on mercurial action in the form of a warm bath, or when used as a\r\nliniment.\r\n\r\nOn the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines, poisons act much\r\nmore energetically than on the skin; which clearly depends in a great\r\nmeasure on the superior rapidity of absorption there,—or, according to\r\nsome, on the facility with which poisons come in contact with the\r\nsentient extremities of nerves.\r\n\r\nThe serous membranes possess an activity of absorption which hardly any\r\nother unbroken texture can equal. Accordingly many poisons act much more\r\nrapidly through the peritonæum than through the stomach. When oxalic\r\nacid is introduced under the same collateral circumstances into the\r\nstomach of one dog and the peritonæum of another, the dose may be so\r\napportioned, that the same quantity, which does not prove fatal to the\r\nformer, kills the latter in fourteen minutes.[56]\r\n\r\nWhile the preceding modes in which poisons enter the blood are indirect,\r\nthey may be introduced directly by a wound in the vein. There is no way\r\nin which poisons, that act through the blood, prove more rapidly fatal.\r\nSome which act very slowly through the stomach cause instant death when\r\ninjected into a vein. A peculiar variety of this mode of introducing\r\npoisons deserves to be distinguished, namely, the application of them to\r\na wound. If the surface bleeds freely, they may not act at all, because\r\nthey are washed away. But if they adhere, they soon enter the divided\r\nveins. Hence, if they act in small doses, this mode of applying them is\r\nhardly less direct than if they were at once injected into a vein.\r\n\r\nSo far the effect of difference in tissue has been determined. Poisons\r\nthat act through the blood act least energetically on the skin, more\r\nactively on the alimentary mucous membrane, still more so on serous\r\nmembranes, and most powerfully of all when introduced directly into a\r\nvessel. There are other textures, however, which merit notice, although\r\ntheir place in the scale of activity has not been exactly settled.\r\n\r\nOn the mucous membrane of the pulmonary air-cells and tubes, poisons act\r\nwith a rapidity which is scarcely surpassed by their direct introduction\r\ninto a vein. This is plainly owing to the exceeding delicacy and wide\r\nsurface of the membrane. Hence three or four inspirations of carbonic\r\noxide gas will cause instant coma. A single inspiration of the noxious\r\ngas of privies has caused instant extinction of sense and motion. Nay,\r\nliquid poisons have been known to act through the same channel with\r\nalmost equal swiftness. For M. Ségalas found that a solution of extract\r\nof nux-vomica caused death in a few seconds when injected in sufficient\r\nquantity into the windpipe; and that half a grain will thus kill a dog\r\nin two minutes, while two grains will rarely prove fatal when injected\r\ninto the stomach, peritonæum, or chest.[57]\r\n\r\nAs to the nervous tissue, it is a fact worthy of mention, that the\r\npoisons which appear to act on the sentient extremities of the nerves,\r\ndo not act at all on the cut surface of the brain and nerves, or upon\r\nany part of the course of the latter. This has been proved with respect\r\nto most active narcotics.\r\n\r\nThe power of the cellular tissue as a medium of absorption, has not\r\nbeen, and cannot easily be, ascertained. On the one hand it is difficult\r\nto apply poisons to it, without also applying them to the mouths of\r\ndivided vessels; and, on the other hand, it is difficult to make a set\r\nof experiments for comparison with others on the stomach, pleura, or\r\nperitonæum, as the cellular tissue does not form an expanded cavity, and\r\nconsequently, the extent of surface to which a poison is applied cannot\r\nbe made the same in each experiment of a series. It is a ready medium,\r\nhowever, for admitting poisons into the blood, especially if an\r\nartificial cavity be made where the tissue is loose, as, for example, by\r\nseparating the skin from the muscles of the back with the finger\r\nintroduced through a small incision in the integuments.\r\n\r\nThe variations caused by difference of tissue in the activity of poisons\r\nhave been viewed in the previous remarks as depending chiefly on the\r\nrelative quickness with which absorption goes on. But in this way it is\r\nimpossible to explain the whole amount of the differences sometimes\r\nobserved. Some poisons cause death when applied to a wound in the\r\nminutest quantity, but are quite harmless when swallowed in large doses:\r\nOthers are diminished a little in activity, but still remain powerful\r\nand fatal poisons. There is not much difference in the power of arsenic\r\nwhen it is applied to different textures, the skin excepted. But oxalic\r\nacid injected into the peritonæum will act eight or ten times more\r\nrapidly than when swallowed and the poison of the viper may prove fatal\r\nto a man through a wound in almost invisible doses, while the whole\r\npoison of six vipers may be swallowed by so small a creature as a\r\nblackbird, with complete impunity.[58] Differences in the absorbing\r\npower of the tissues cannot explain these facts.\r\n\r\nThe only rational way of accounting for them is by supposing that a part\r\nof the poison is decomposed,—the change being greatest where absorption\r\nis slowest and the power of assimilation strongest, namely, in the\r\nstomach,—and least where absorption is quickest and assimilation almost\r\nwanting, namely, in a wound. This explanation derives support from the\r\ndifferent effects of change of tissue on poisons of the different\r\nkingdoms. Mineral poisons are least, and animal poisons are most,\r\naffected in their action by differences of tissue, while vegetable\r\npoisons hold the middle place:—an arrangement which coincides with the\r\nrespective difficulty of decomposition among mineral, vegetable, and\r\nanimal substances generally, whether under physical or under vital\r\nprocesses.[59]\r\n\r\n6. With respect to differences arising from _difference of organ_, these\r\nwill, of course, be partly attributable to differences in tissue, but\r\nnot altogether. For example, in the case of the pure corrosives or\r\nirritants, the injury caused will depend for its danger on the\r\nimportance of the organ to the general economy of the body: Inflammation\r\ncaused by a local poison in the stomach will be more quickly fatal than\r\nthat excited in the intestines only; and such a poison may act violently\r\non the external parts without materially impairing the general health.\r\n\r\n7. _Habit and Idiosyncrasy._—The remarks to be made under the present\r\nhead are important in a medico-legal point of view: for they show how\r\none man may be poisoned by a substance generally harmless, and another\r\nnot harmed by a substance usually poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of _idiosyncrasy_ is generally to increase the activity of\r\npoisons, or even to render some substances deleterious which are\r\ncommonly harmless.\r\n\r\nThe effect of opium in medicinal doses is commonly pleasant and\r\nsalutary; but in some individuals it produces disagreeable and even\r\ndangerous effects. Calomel, which in moderate doses is for the most part\r\na mild laxative or sialagogue, will cause in some people, even in the\r\ndose of a few grains, violent salivation, ulceration of the mouth, nay,\r\nfatal gangrene. On the other hand, a few substances, which to most\r\npeople are actively poisonous, have on some individuals comparatively\r\nlittle effect. There are extremely few poisons, however, in regard to\r\nwhich this kind of idiosyncrasy is well established and prominent.\r\nMercury and alcohol are examples. The compounds of mercury, which in\r\nmoderate quantity are mildly laxative or sialagogue to most people, but\r\nto some persons dangerously poisonous in very small doses, would, on the\r\ncontrary, appear in other constitutions to be extremely inactive; for it\r\nhas occasionally been found impossible to bring on the peculiar\r\nconstitutional action of mercury by continuing the use of its\r\npreparations for months together. In general children are not easily\r\naffected by calomel as a sialagogue, but easily by its laxative action.\r\nAs to alcohol, it is a familiar fact, that independently of the effects\r\nof habit, there are some constitutions which cannot be brought under the\r\ninfluence of intoxicating liquors without an extraordinary quantity of\r\nthem and a long-continued debauch, while others are overpowered in a\r\nshort space of time, and by very moderate excess; and there is no reason\r\nto doubt that very great constitutional differences also prevail in\r\nregard to the operation of a single large dose. A rarer idiosyncrasy is\r\nunusual insensibility to the action of opium. I am acquainted with a\r\ngentleman unaccustomed to the use of opium who has taken without injury\r\nnearly an ounce of good laudanum,—a dose which would certainly prove\r\nfatal to most people.\r\n\r\nBut not only does idiosyncrasy modify the action of poisons: Through its\r\nmeans, too, some substances are actually poisonous to certain\r\nindividuals, which to mankind in general are unhurtful, nay, even\r\nnutritive.\r\n\r\nWith some people all kinds of red fish, trout, salmon, and even the\r\nricher white fish, herring, mackerel, turbot, or holibut, disagree as it\r\nis called—that is, act after the manner of poisons: They produce\r\nfainting, sickness, pain of the stomach; and if they were not speedily\r\nevacuated by vomiting, dangerous consequences might ensue. The same is\r\noften the case with mushrooms. The esculent mushrooms act on some people\r\nnearly in the same way as the poisonous varieties. Bitter almonds and\r\nother vegetable substances that contain hydrocyanic acid, sometimes\r\nproduce stupor or nettle-rash in the small quantities used for seasoning\r\nfood. In like manner many flowers, which to most persons are agreeable\r\nand not injurious, cannot be kept in the same room with some people on\r\naccount of the severe nervous affections that are developed.\r\n\r\nThis idiosyncrasy may even be acquired. One of my relations, who was for\r\nmany years violently affected by very small quantities of the richer\r\nkinds of fish, used at a previous period to eat them, and can now again\r\ndo so, with impunity. Many people have acquired a similar idiosyncrasy\r\nwith respect to eggs; instances of the same kind will be afterwards\r\nmentioned in respect to shell-fish, particularly muscles; indeed there\r\nare probably few articles of food in regard to which such idiosyncrasies\r\nmay not in a few rare instances be met with, if we except the grains and\r\ncommon kinds of butcher-meat. I may add, that from facts which have come\r\nunder my notice, I have sometimes suspected that a similar idiosyncrasy\r\nmay be acquired in a slight degree, and for a short time only, in regard\r\neven to some kinds of butcher-meat, especially the flesh of young\r\nanimals and pork. On this subject some illustrations will be found at\r\nthe close of the chapter on diseased and decayed animal matter.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear well ascertained, that the effect of idiosyncrasy is\r\never to impair materially the energy of poisons, except in the instances\r\nof mercury, alcohol, and opium.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the tendency of _habit_ when it does affect their\r\nenergy, is, with a few exceptions, to lessen it. By the force of habit a\r\nperson may take without immediate harm such enormous quantities of some\r\npoisons as would infallibly kill an unpractised person or himself when\r\nhe began. There have been opium-eaters in this country who took for days\r\ntogether ten or even seventeen ounces of laudanum daily.\r\n\r\nThe influence of habit has been ascertained precisely in the case of a\r\nfew common poisons only. On the whole, it would appear that more change\r\nis effected by habit in the action of the organic than in that of the\r\ninorganic poisons; and that of the former, those which act on the brain\r\nand nervous system, and produce _narcotism_, are altered in the most\r\neminent degree. The best examples of the influence of habit are opium\r\nand vinous spirits. The action of such poisons is not always, however,\r\nentirely thrown away; they still produce some immediate effect; and\r\nfarther, by being frequently taken, they may slowly bring on certain\r\ndisease, or engender a predisposition to disease. A very singular\r\nexception to this rule prevails in the instance of tobacco; which, under\r\nthe influence of habit, may be smoked daily to a considerable amount,\r\nand, so far as yet appears, without any cumulative effect on the\r\nconstitution, like that of opium-eating or drinking spirits.\r\n\r\nThe inorganic poisons are most of them little impaired in activity by\r\nthe force of habit. The pure irritants, indeed, do lose a little of\r\ntheir energy: for it seems that persons have acquired the power of\r\nswallowing with impunity considerable doses of the mineral acids. But as\r\nto inorganic poisons that enter the blood, habit certainly does not\r\ndiminish, probably rather increases, their power. There is no\r\nsatisfactory evidence, that a person by taking gradually-increasing\r\ndoses of arsenic may acquire the power of enduring a considerably larger\r\ndose than when he began: On the contrary, the stomach rather becomes\r\nmore tender to the subsequent dose by each repetition. I have little\r\nhesitation in avowing my disbelief of the alleged cases of\r\narsenic-eaters and corrosive-sublimate-eaters, who could swallow whole\r\ndrachms at once with impunity. Some have expressed surprise at this\r\nstatement having been made in former editions of the present work, when\r\nthere is such authority as Byron, Pouqueville, &c., for the hackneyed\r\nstory of Soleyman, the sublimate-eater of Constantinople, who lived to\r\nthe age of a hundred, eating a drachm of corrosive sublimate daily. I\r\nmust avow, however, that such reporters of a feat so very extraordinary,\r\nand where deception was so highly probable, are to me no authority at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIn the relative influence of habit on poisons of the three kingdoms of\r\nnature, a new argument will be discovered for the opinion given above\r\nrespecting the partial decomposition of organic poisons in some of the\r\ntissues. In fact this partial decomposition accounts very well for the\r\neffect of habit: The effect of habit is probably nothing more than an\r\nincreased power acquired by the stomach of decomposing the poison,—just\r\nas it gradually acquires an increased facility in digesting some\r\nalimentary substances which are at first very indigestible.\r\n\r\n8. The last modifying cause to be mentioned comprehends certain\r\n_diseased states of the body_. The effect of disease, like that of\r\nhabit, is in general to impair the activity of poisons. But it is only\r\nin the instance of a few diseases that this diminution is so strongly\r\nmarked as to be important in relation to medical jurisprudence.—In the\r\ncontinued fever of this country there is a diminished susceptibility of\r\nthe constitutional action of mercury; and this peculiarity is very\r\nstrongly marked in the yellow fever, as well as in the bilious fevers\r\ngenerally of tropical climates. In some varieties of typhoid fever there\r\nis obviously a diminished sensibility to the action of wine and other\r\nspirituous liquors; but this diminution in a great majority of cases is\r\nmuch inferior to what some physicians have represented.—In severe\r\ndysentery the susceptibility of the narcotic action of opium is so much\r\nimpaired, that a person unaccustomed to the use of that drug, may\r\ncontinue to take daily, for several days together, a quantity which\r\nmight prove fatal to him in a state of health. In the severe form which\r\ndysentery occasionally puts on in this country I have known a patient\r\ntake from twenty-four to thirty grains of opium daily, and retain it\r\nall, without experiencing more than a mild narcotic action.—In epidemic\r\ncholera the same insensibility has been remarked to the operation of\r\nopium.—It also occurs in the instance of excessive hemorrhagy.—According\r\nto the doctrines and practice of the present dominant school in Italy,\r\nthere is an unusual insensibility during inflammatory dropsy to the\r\nirritant action of gamboge, so that sixty or eighty grains may be taken\r\nwithout harm.—There is no disease, however, in which the power of\r\nmitigating the action of poisons is more remarkably exhibited, than in\r\ntetanus: It is often scarcely possible to bring on the narcotic action\r\nof opium by any doses which can be administered; calomel, too, acts with\r\nmuch less energy than usual; and even common purgatives must be\r\nadministered in doses considerably larger than those required in most\r\nother disorders.—Mania is similarly circumstanced: almost all remedies\r\nmust be given in increased doses, narcotic remedies in particular. But\r\nthere is good reason for believing that the impaired susceptibility of\r\nthe action of poisons remarked in this disorder is far from being always\r\nso great as some have alleged.—Another disease allied to the last, where\r\nthe diminution of susceptibility is often great, is delirium tremens. It\r\nhas in particular been often found, that to produce sleep in this\r\ndisease opium must be given in frequent large doses,—so large indeed,\r\nthat they would undoubtedly prove fatal to a person in health. At the\r\nsame time it is worthy of remark, that in some cases of delirium\r\ntremens, even violent in degree, the peculiarity now specified, as I\r\nhave myself several times witnessed, is far from being strongly\r\nmarked.—Hydrophobia always, and hysteria sometimes, impair the activity\r\nof poisons. I have seen cases of hysteria, more particularly those\r\nassuming the form of tetanus, where very large doses of opium were\r\nrequired to produce a calmative effect and sleep; and in hydrophobia it\r\nis well shown that the narcotic action of opium is not produced even by\r\nlarge doses often repeated.—The same state occurs in excessive\r\nhemorrhage.\r\n\r\nIn the operation of this class of modifying agents it is a general law,\r\nto which there are probably few exceptions, that they chiefly affect\r\npoisons of the organic kingdoms, and the narcotics above all. At least\r\nin the instance of most mineral poisons their influence is very\r\ninferior. Their operation may be accounted for in various ways.\r\nSometimes, as in dysentery and cholera, the poison is carried with\r\nunusual rapidity through the alimentary canal. Sometimes again it\r\nremains comparatively inert, because on account of the impaired activity\r\nof absorption, it is not taken up with the usual quickness by the\r\nabsorbent vessels. And sometimes, as in the instance of tetanus, mania,\r\nand rabies, the nervous system is in a state of peculiar excitement, by\r\nwhich the customary action of the poison is in a great measure, if not\r\nentirely, counteracted.\r\n\r\nIn a few diseased states of the system there is an increased\r\nsusceptibility of the action of poisons: and it is important that the\r\nmedical jurist should attend to this circumstance. When a poison has a\r\ntendency to bring on a peculiar pathological state of the system, or of\r\na particular organ, which state is also produced by a disease existing\r\nat the time or impending, violent and even fatal consequences may ensue\r\nfrom doses of poisons which in ordinary circumstances are innocuous or\r\nbeneficial. Thus in persons affected with apoplexy an ordinary dose of\r\nopium may accelerate death; and in people even with a mere tendency to\r\napoplexy, if it is strongly marked, or appears from what are called\r\nwarning symptoms to be on the point of developing itself, a common dose\r\nof such narcotics as occasion determination to the brain may excite the\r\napoplectic attack. Thus, too, in cases of inflammatory disorders of the\r\nalimentary canal, irritating substances, in doses not otherwise\r\ninjurious, may produce dangerous impressions on the tender membrane with\r\nwhich they come in contact. But in respect to this last example, it must\r\nbe remarked, that the improvements or the caprice of medical practice\r\nhave gone directly in face of the rule, by suggesting that some internal\r\ninflammations of the alimentary canal may be successfully treated with\r\nirritating remedies.\r\n\r\nI might here perhaps have added among the causes which modify the action\r\nof poisons, sleep, and the administration of other poisons. The latter\r\nsubject, however, will be better considered at the end of the Individual\r\nPoisons, under the title of Compound Poisoning. The former agent is of\r\ndoubtful effect. Some observations on its influence will be found in the\r\nchapter on the Evidence of General Poisoning, p. 41.\r\n\r\n_Application of the preceding remarks to the Treatment of Poisoning._ As\r\nan appendix to what has been said respecting the physiological action of\r\npoisons, and the causes by which it is liable to be modified, I shall\r\nhere state shortly certain applications to the treatment of poisoning.\r\n\r\nIn the instance of internal poisoning, the great object of the physician\r\nis to administer an antidote or counter-poison. Antidotes are of two\r\nkinds. One kind takes away the deleterious qualities of the poison\r\nbefore it comes within its sphere of action, by altering its chemical\r\nnature. The other controls the poisonous action after it has begun, by\r\nexciting a contrary action in the system. In the early ages of medicine\r\nalmost all antidotes were believed to be of the latter description, but\r\nin fact very few antidotes of the kind are known.\r\n\r\nChemical antidotes operate in several ways, according to the mode of\r\naction of the poison for which they are given. If the poison is a pure\r\ncorrosive, such as a mineral acid, it will be sufficient that the\r\nantidote destroy its corrosive quality: Thus the addition of an alkali\r\nor earth will neutralize sulphuric acid, and destroy or at least\r\nprodigiously lessen its poisonous properties. In applying this rule care\r\nmust be taken to choose an antidote which is either inert in itself, or,\r\nif poisonous, is, like the poison for which it is given, a pure\r\ncorrosive or local irritant, and one whose properties are reciprocally\r\nneutralized.\r\n\r\nIf the poison, on the other hand, besides possessing a local action,\r\nlikewise acts remotely through absorption, or by an impression on the\r\ninner coat of the vessels, mere neutralization of its chemical\r\nproperties is not sufficient; for we have seen above that such poisons\r\nact throughout all their chemical combinations which are soluble. Here,\r\ntherefore, it is necessary that the chemical antidote render the poison\r\ninsoluble or nearly so; and insoluble not only in water, but likewise in\r\nthe animal fluids, more particularly the juices of the stomach. The same\r\nquality is desirable even in the antidotes for the pure corrosives; for\r\nit often happens that in their soluble combinations these substances\r\nretain some irritating, though not any corrosive power. When we try by\r\nthe foregoing criterions many of the antidotes which have been proposed\r\nfor various poisons, they will be found defective; and precise\r\nexperiments have in recent times actually proved them to be so.\r\n\r\nThe other kind of antidote operates not by altering the form of the\r\npoison, but by exciting in the system an action contrary to that\r\nestablished by the poison. On considering attentively, however, the\r\nphenomena of the action of individual poisons, it will be found\r\nexceedingly difficult to say what is the essence of a contrary action,\r\nand still more how that counter-action is to be brought about.\r\nAccordingly, few antidotes of the kind are known. Physiology or\r\nexperience has not yet brought to light any mode of inducing an action\r\ncounter to that caused by arsenic and most of the irritant class of\r\npoisons. It appears probable that the remote operation of lead may be\r\nsometimes corrected by mercury given to salivation, and that the violent\r\nsalivation caused by mercury may be occasionally corrected by nauseating\r\ndoses of antimony. But these are the only instances which occur to me at\r\npresent of antidotes for irritant poisoning which operate by\r\ncounter-action, unless we choose to designate by the name of antidote\r\nthe conjunction of remedial means which constitute the antiphlogistic\r\nmethod of cure. In the class of narcotics we are acquainted with equally\r\nfew constitutional antidotes, although the nature of the action of these\r\npoisons seems better to admit of them. Ammonia is to a certain extent an\r\nantidote for hydrocyanic acid, but by no means so powerful as some\r\npersons believe; and I am not sure that in this class of poisons we can\r\nwith any propriety mention another antidote of the constitutional kind.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, it is chiefly among the changes induced by chemical\r\naffinities that the practitioner must look for counter-poisons; and the\r\ningenuity of the toxicologists has thence supplied the materia medica\r\nwith many of singular efficacy. When given in time, magnesia or chalk is\r\nan antidote for the mineral acids and oxalic acid, albumen for corrosive\r\nsublimate and verdigris, bark for tartar-emetic, common salt for lunar\r\ncaustic, sulphate of soda or magnesia for sugar of lead and muriate of\r\nbaryta, chloride of lime or soda for liver of sulphur, vinegar or oil\r\nfor the fixed alkalis; and these substances act either by neutralizing\r\nthe corrosive power of the poison, or by forming with it an insoluble\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\nIn recent times a new object in the treatment of poisoning has been\r\npointed out by the discoveries made in its physiology. As it has been\r\nproved that many of the most deadly poisons enter the blood, and in all\r\nprobability act by circulating with that fluid, so it has been inferred\r\nthat an important object in the treatment is to promote their discharge\r\nby the natural secretions. In support of this reasonable inference it\r\nhas been lately rendered probable by Orfila, as will be seen under the\r\nhead of the treatment of the effects of arsenic, that it is of great\r\nadvantage in some forms of poisoning to increase the discharge of urine.\r\n\r\nIn the instance of external poisoning the main object of the treatment\r\nis to prevent the poison from entering the blood, or to remove it from\r\nthe local vessels which it has entered.\r\n\r\nOne mode, which has been known to the profession from early times, and\r\nafter being long in disuse was lately revived by Sir D. Barry, and\r\napplied with success to man, is the application of cupping-glasses to\r\nthe part where the poison has been introduced.[60] This method may act\r\nin various ways. It certainly prevents the farther absorption of the\r\npoison by suspending for a time the absorbing power of the vessels of\r\nthe part covered by the cup. It also sucks the blood out of the wound,\r\nand may consequently wash the poison away with it. Possibly it likewise\r\ncompresses the nerves around, and prevents the impression made by the\r\npoison on their sentient extremities from being transmitted along their\r\nfilaments.\r\n\r\nAnother mode is by the application of a ligature between the injured\r\npart and the trunk, so as to check the circulation. This is a very\r\nancient practice in the case of poisoned wounds, and is known even to\r\nsavages. But as usually practised it is only a temporary cure: As soon\r\nas the ligature is removed the effects of the poison begin. It may be\r\nemployed, however, for many kinds of poisoning through wounds, so as to\r\neffect a radical cure. We have seen that most poisons of the organic\r\nkingdom are in no long time either thrown off by the system or\r\ndecomposed in the blood. Hence if the quantity given has not been too\r\nlarge, recovery will take place. Now, by means of a ligature, which is\r\nremoved for a short time at moderately distant intervals, a poison,\r\nwhich has been introduced into a wound beyond the reach of extraction,\r\nmay be gradually admitted into the system in successive quantities, each\r\ntoo small to cause death or serious mischief, and be thus in the end\r\nentirely removed and destroyed. Such is a practical application which\r\nmay be made of some ingenious experiments performed not long ago by M.\r\nBouillaud with strychnia, the poisonous principle of nux-vomica.[61]\r\n\r\nThe last mode to be mentioned is by a combination of the ligature with\r\nvenesection, deduced by M. Vernière from his experimental researches\r\nformerly noticed (p. 19). Suppose a fatal dose of extract of nux-vomica\r\nhas been thrust into the paw of a dog; M. Vernière applies a tight\r\nligature round the limb, next injects slowly as much warm water into the\r\njugular vein as the animal can safely bear, and then slackens the\r\nligature. The state of venous _plethora_ thus induced completely\r\nsuspends absorption. The ligature is next tied so as to compress the\r\nveins without compressing the arteries of the limb, and a vein is opened\r\nbetween the wound and the ligature in such a situation, that the blood\r\nwhich flows out must previously pass through, or at least near the\r\npoisoned wound. When a moderate quantity has been withdrawn, the\r\nligature may be removed with safety; and the extraction of the poison\r\nmay be farther proved by the blood that has been drawn being injected\r\ninto the veins of another animal; for rapid death by tetanus will be the\r\nresult.[62] It is not improbable that in this plan the preliminary\r\nproduction of venous plethora may be dispensed with; and then the\r\ntreatment may be easily and safely applied to the human subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                 ON THE EVIDENCE OF GENERAL POISONING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subject is purely medico-legal. It comprehends an account of the\r\nvarious kinds of evidence by which the medical jurist is enabled to\r\npronounce whether poisoning in a general sense (that is, without\r\nreference to a particular poison), is impossible, improbable, possible,\r\nprobable, or certain. It likewise comprises an appreciation of the\r\ncircumstances which usually lead the unprofessional, as well as the\r\nprofessional, to infer correctly or erroneously a suspicion of such\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\nUnder the present head might likewise be included the history of\r\npoisoning, the art of secret poisoning, and some other topics of the\r\nlike kind. But the want of proper documents, and the unmeasured\r\ncredulity which has prevailed on the subject of poisoning throughout all\r\nages down to very recent times, has entangled these subjects in so\r\nintricate a maze of fable, that a notice of them, sufficiently detailed\r\nto interest the reader, would be quite misplaced in this work.\r\n\r\nOn the art of secret poisoning, however, as having been once an\r\nimportant object of medical jurisprudence, it might be expected that\r\nsome comments should here be offered. But really I do not see any good\r\nreason for wading through the mass of credulous conjectures and\r\nquestionable facts, which have been collected on the subject, and which\r\nhave been copied into one modern work after another, for no other cause\r\nthan that they are of classic origin, or feed our appetite for the\r\nmysterious. No one now seriously believes that Henry the Sixth was\r\nkilled by a pair of poisoned gloves, or Pope Clement the Seventh by a\r\npoisoned torch carried before him in a procession, or Hercules by a\r\npoisoned robe, or that the operation of poisons can be so predetermined\r\nas to commence or prove fatal on a fixed day, and after the lapse of a\r\ndefinite and remote interval. With regard to the noted instances of\r\nsecret poisoning, which occurred towards the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury in Italy and France, it is plain to every modern toxicologist,\r\nfrom the only certain knowledge handed down to us of these events, that\r\nthe actors in them owed their success rather to the ignorance of the\r\nage, than to their own dexterity. And as to the refined secrets believed\r\nto have been possessed by them, it is sufficient here to say, that\r\nalthough we are now acquainted with ten times as many and ten times as\r\nsubtle poisons as were known in those days, yet none exist which are\r\nendowed with the hidden qualities once so universally dreaded.\r\n\r\nThe crime of poisoning, from its nature, must always be a secret one.\r\nBut little apprehension need be entertained of the art of secret\r\npoisoning as understood by Toffana or Brinvilliers,[63] or as it might\r\nbe improved by a modern imitator. It seems to have escaped the attention\r\nof those who have written on the subject, that the practice of such an\r\nart requires the knowledge not only of a dexterous toxicologist, but\r\nalso of a skilful physician; for success must depend on the exact\r\nimitation of some natural disease. It is only among medical men,\r\ntherefore, and among the higher orders of them, that a Saint-Croix can\r\narise now-a days. How little is to be dreaded on that head is apparent\r\nfrom the domestic history of the European kingdoms for the last half\r\ncentury, compared with their history some centuries ago. Few medical men\r\nhave even been suspected, and those few only upon visionary grounds, and\r\nunder the impulse of violent political feeling.[64] In one late instance\r\nonly, so far as I am aware, has it been proved that the physician’s art\r\nwas actually prostituted to so fearful a purpose; and the detection of\r\nthe crime in that case shows how difficult concealment will always be\r\nwherever justice is administered rigorously, and medico-legal\r\ninvestigations skilfully conducted.[65]\r\n\r\nTwo extraordinary incidents which happened lately in Germany may appear\r\nat first sight at variance with these views. I allude to the cases of\r\nAnna Margaretha Zwanziger and Margaretha Gottfried, which justly excited\r\nmuch interest where they occurred, and are notorious to continental\r\ntoxicologists. Zwanziger, while serving as housekeeper in various\r\nfamilies in the territory of Bayreuth in Bavaria during the years 1808\r\nand 1809, contrived to administer poison,—sometimes under the\r\ninstigation of mere revenge or spite, sometimes for the purpose of\r\nclearing the way for her schemes of marriage with her masters,—to no\r\nfewer than seventeen individuals in the course of nine months; and of\r\nthese three died.[66] Gottfried, a woman in affluent circumstances and\r\ntolerable station in the town of Bremen, was even more successful. For\r\nshe pursued her criminal career undiscovered for fifteen years; and when\r\ndetected in 1828 had murdered actually fourteen persons, and\r\nadministered poison unsuccessfully to several others. Her motive, as in\r\nthe case of Zwanziger, was the mere gratification of a malevolent\r\ntemper, or the removal of supposed obstacles to her matrimonial dreams.\r\nIn neither of these instances, however, did the criminal possess any\r\nparticular skill, or observe much measure in her proceedings. The cases\r\nof poisoning were of the common kind,—produced by arsenic,—proving in\r\ngeneral quickly fatal,—and presenting the ordinary phenomena. I cannot\r\nhelp thinking, therefore, that the events now alluded to prove rather\r\nthe ineffectiveness of the police where they happened, than the\r\nadroitness of the actors by whom they were brought about; and that they\r\nconstitute no sound objection to the statement, that the art of secret\r\npoisoning is now unknown, and is not likely to be again revived.\r\n\r\nIt must be granted, indeed, that the late discoveries in chemistry and\r\ntoxicology have made poisons known which might be employed in such a way\r\nas to render suspicion unlikely, and to baffle inquiry. But the methods\r\nnow alluded to are hitherto very little known; they cannot easily be\r\nattempted on account of the rarity and difficult preparation of the\r\npoisons; they can never be practised except by a person conversant with\r\nthe minute phenomena of natural disease; and it is no part of the object\r\nof this work to make them public.\r\n\r\nThe evidence, by which the medical jurist is enabled to pronounce on the\r\nexistence or non-existence of poisoning in general, and to determine the\r\nsubordinate questions that relate to it, is derived from five\r\nsources,—1, the symptoms during life; 2, the appearances in the dead\r\nbody; 3, the chemical analysis; 4, experiments and observations on\r\nanimals; and 5, certain moral circumstances, which are either\r\ninseparably interwoven with the medical proof, or cannot be accurately\r\nappreciated without medical knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n              SECTION I.—_Of the Evidence from Symptoms._\r\n\r\nNot many years ago it was the custom to decide questions of poisoning\r\nfrom the symptoms only. Till the close of last century, indeed, no other\r\nevidence was accounted so infallible: and for the simple reason, that in\r\nreality the other branches of evidence were even more imperfectly\r\nunderstood. So lately as 1763, and even in Germany, the solemn opinions\r\nof whole colleges were sometimes grounded almost exclusively on the\r\nsymptoms.[67] About that time, however, doubts began to be entertained\r\nof the infallibility of such evidence; these doubts have since assumed\r\ngradually a more substantial form; and it is now laid down by every\r\nesteemed author in Medical Jurisprudence, that the symptoms, however\r\nexquisitely developed, can never justify an opinion in favour of more\r\nthan high probability.[68] In laying down this doctrine medical jurists\r\nappear to me to have injudiciously confounded together actual symptoms\r\nwith their general characteristics. If the doctrine is to be held as\r\napplying to the evidence from symptoms, only so far as they are viewed\r\nin questions of general poisoning,—that is, as applying to the general\r\ncharacters merely of the symptoms,—it is deduced from accurate\r\nprinciples. But if it is likewise to be applied, as recent authors have\r\ndone, to the actual symptoms produced by particular poisons, and in all\r\ncases whatever of their action, then it is a rule clearly liable to\r\nseveral important exceptions. These exceptions will be noticed under the\r\nheads of the mineral acids, oxalic acid, arsenic, corrosive sublimate,\r\nnux vomica, &c. At present it is only the general characters of the\r\nsymptoms, and the points in which they differ from the general\r\ncharacters of the symptoms of natural disease, that I propose to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristics usually ascribed to the symptoms of poisoning\r\nconsidered generally, are, that they commence suddenly and prove rapidly\r\nfatal,—that they increase steadily,—that they are uniform in nature\r\nthroughout their course,—that they begin soon after a meal,—and that\r\nthey appear while the body is in a state of perfect health.\r\n\r\n1. The first characteristic is the _suddenness of their appearance and\r\nthe rapidity of their progress_ towards a fatal termination. Some of\r\nthem act instantaneously, and the effects of most of them are in general\r\nfully developed within an hour or little more. But this character is by\r\nno means uniform. The most violent may be made to act, so as to bring on\r\ntheir peculiar symptoms slowly, or even by imperceptible degrees. Thus\r\narsenic, which usually causes violent symptoms from the very beginning,\r\nmay be so administered as to occasion at first nothing more than slight\r\nnausea and general feebleness; and afterwards in slow succession its\r\nmore customary effects. In like manner corrosive sublimate may be given\r\nin such a way as to cause at first mild salivation, and finally gangrene\r\nof the mouth. Even many vegetable poisons might be administered in the\r\nsame way. The well-known consequences of digitalis in medicinal doses\r\nwill serve as a familiar instance. A still better illustration is\r\nsupplied by the medicinal effects of the alkaloid of nux-vomica, whose\r\naction in other circumstances is most rapid and violent: Strychnia in a\r\nmoderate dose will cause death by violent tetanus in two or three\r\nminutes; but when given in frequent small doses as a remedy in palsy, it\r\nhas been known to bring on first starting of the limbs, then stiffness\r\nof the jaw, afterwards pain and rigidity of the neck; and these effects\r\nmight be increased so gradually, that the patient would seem to die\r\nunder ordinary tetanus. Nevertheless, the foregoing considerations being\r\nkept always in mind, it still remains true, that the effects of poisons\r\nfor the most part begin suddenly, when the dose is large. This is an\r\nimportant circumstance in regard to certain active poisons, such as the\r\nmineral acids, oxalic acid, arsenic, strychnia, &c. For when it is\r\nconsidered that in criminal cases they are given for the most part in\r\nunnecessarily large doses, it follows that if the effect ascribed to\r\nthese poisons in such doses have not begun suddenly, the suspicion is\r\nprobably incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks may be applied to the sudden termination of the\r\nsymptoms. Poison is for the most part given criminally in doses so large\r\nthat it proves rapidly fatal. Yet this is not always the case; the\r\ndiseased state occasioned by poisons has often been prolonged, as will\r\nbe seen hereafter, for several weeks, sometimes for several months; nay,\r\na person may be carried off by a malady, the seeds of which have been\r\nsown by the operation of poison years before.\r\n\r\nThe present would be the proper place for noticing the important\r\nquestion regarding the interval of time, after which, if death\r\nsupervenes, it cannot be laid to the charge of the person who\r\nadministered the poison. It is unnecessary, however, to say much on the\r\nsubject. According to the English law, death must take place within a\r\nyear. As to the Scottish law, it may be inferred from what has been said\r\nby the late Baron Hume on the subject of homicide generally, that a\r\ncharge of poisoning is relevant although the person should die at a\r\nperiod indefinitely remote, and that it will infer the pains of law,\r\nprovided the operation of the poison can be distinctly traced,\r\nunmodified by extraneous circumstances, from the commencement of the\r\nsymptoms to the fatal termination.[69] Of course the influence of these\r\nmodifying circumstances in lessening the criminal’s responsibility will\r\nincrease with the interval. The question for the medical jurist to\r\ndetermine in such a case would therefore be, the distance of time to\r\nwhich death may be delayed in the case of poisoning generally, and in\r\nthat of the particular poison. This question cannot be answered even\r\nwith an approach to precision, except in the instance of a few common\r\npoisons. Most vegetable and animal poisons prove fatal either in a few\r\ndays or not at all; but some mineral poisons may cause death after an\r\ninterval of many days. It appears probable that arsenic may cause death\r\nafter an interval of several months, and it is well ascertained that the\r\nsymptoms of poisoning with the mineral acids have continued\r\nuninterruptedly and without modification for eight months, and then\r\nterminated fatally.\r\n\r\n2. The next general characteristic of the symptoms of poisoning is\r\n_regularity in their increase_. It is clear, however, that even this\r\ncharacter cannot be universal. For in all cases of slow poisoning by\r\nrepeated small doses there must be remissions and exacerbations, just as\r\nin natural diseases. Besides, as we can seldom watch the symptoms\r\nadvancing in their simple form, but must endeavour to remove them by\r\nremedies, remissions may thus be produced and their tendency to increase\r\nsteadily counteracted. Farther, some poisons admit of exacerbations and\r\nremissions, even when given in one large dose; and there are others, the\r\nvery essence of whose action is to produce violent symptoms in frequent\r\nparoxysms. Of the latter kind are nux vomica, and the other substances\r\nthat contain strychnia. Of the former kind is arsenic: in cases of\r\npoisoning with arsenic it often happens, that after the first five or\r\nsix hours have been passed in great agony, the symptoms undergo a\r\nstriking remission for as many hours, and then return with equal or\r\nincreased violence. Still it is true that on the whole the symptoms of\r\npoisoning are steady in their progress; so that this should always be\r\nattended to as one of the general characters. In the case of slow\r\npoisoning, too, when the most remarkable deviations from it are\r\nobserved, the very occurrence of exacerbations and remissions, combined\r\nwith certain points of moral proof, may furnish the strongest evidence\r\npossible. Thus, on the trial of Miss Blandy at Oxford in 1752, for the\r\nmurder of her father, one of the strongest circumstances in proof was,\r\nthat repeatedly after she gave the deceased a bowl of gruel, suspected\r\nto be poisoned, his illness was much increased in violence.[70]\r\n\r\nAs connected with the present subject, a question might here be noticed\r\nthat has been discussed on the occasion of various trials, namely,\r\nwhether the symptoms of poisoning are susceptible of a complete\r\nintermission. It cannot be answered satisfactorily, however, except with\r\nreference to particular poisons. The property alluded to has been\r\nascribed to several poisons, even to mercury, arsenic, and opium; but\r\noftener, I believe, in consequence of an improper desire on the part of\r\nthe witness to prove or to perfect their view of the case, than through\r\nlegitimate induction from facts.\r\n\r\n3. Another characteristic is _uniformity in the nature of the symptoms_\r\nthroughout their whole progress. This character is the least invariable\r\nof them all; for many poisons cause very different symptoms towards the\r\nclose from those which they cause at the beginning. Arsenic may induce\r\nat first inflammation of the alimentary canal, and afterwards palsy or\r\nepilepsy; nux-vomica may excite at first violent tetanus, and afterwards\r\ninflammation of the stomach and bowels; and corrosive sublimate, after\r\nexciting in the first instance inflammation, may prove eventually fatal\r\nby inducing excessive ptyalism. In truth, certain changes of this kind\r\nin the nature of the symptoms will, in special cases, afford strong\r\npresumption, perhaps absolute proof, not only of general poisoning, but\r\neven also of the particular poison given. The reason for mentioning so\r\nuncertain a character as uniformity in the nature of the symptoms among\r\ntheir characteristics will appear presently.—[pp. 47 & 50.]\r\n\r\n4. The fourth characteristic is, that _the symptoms begin soon after a\r\nmeal_, or rather, soon after food, drink, or medicine has been taken.\r\nThe occasions on which we eat and drink are so numerous and so near one\r\nanother, that unless the poison suspected is one which acts with\r\nrapidity, it may be difficult to attach any weight to this circumstance.\r\nSome poisons rarely produce their effects till a considerable time after\r\nthey are swallowed; the poisonous mushrooms, for example, may remain in\r\nthe alimentary canal for several hours or even an entire day and more,\r\nbefore their effects begin; poisonous cheese in like manner may not act\r\nfor five or six hours,[71] or even a whole day;[72] and that kind of\r\ncholera, which is caused in some people by putrid, diseased, and\r\nnew-killed meat, seldom begins, so far as I have observed, till twelve\r\nhours or more after the noxious meal. With regard to the commoner\r\npoisons, such as arsenic, corrosive sublimate, the mineral acids, oxalic\r\nacid, nux-vomica, and the like, it is a good general rule, that the\r\nsymptoms, if violent from the beginning, must have begun soon after\r\nfood, drink, or medicine has been taken.\r\n\r\nIn making inquiries respecting this point, however, care must be taken\r\nnot to lose sight of certain circumstances which may cause a deviation\r\nfrom the general rule.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it should be remembered that poisons may be\r\nadministered in many other ways besides mixing them with articles of\r\nfood or drink, or substituting them for medicines. They may be\r\nintroduced into the anus; they have been introduced into the vagina;\r\nthey have also been introduced by inhalation in the form of vapour; and\r\nthere can be no difficulty in introducing some of them through wounds.\r\n\r\nSecondly, another circumstance which may be kept in view is, that, if a\r\nperson falls asleep very soon after swallowing a poison, especially one\r\nof the irritants, the commencement of the symptoms may be considerably\r\nretarded, provided it be not one of the powerful corrosives. This\r\nstatement is not so fully supported by facts as to admit of its being\r\nlaid down with confidence as a general rule. But from various incidents\r\nwhich have come under my notice it appears not improbable, that sleep\r\ndoes possess the power of putting off for a while the action of some\r\npoisons. In particular some instances have occurred to me where arsenic\r\ntaken at night did not begin to act for several hours, the individual\r\nhaving in the meantime been asleep.[73] The occurrence of so long an\r\ninterval between its administration and the first appearance of the\r\nsymptoms is so contrary to what generally happens, that some cause or\r\nanother must be in activity; and the insensibility of the system during\r\nsleep to most sources of excitement seems to supply a sufficient\r\nexplanation. The slow operation of laxatives during sleep compared with\r\ntheir effects during one’s waking hours, is an analogical fact.\r\n\r\nA third consideration to be attended to is, that poison may be secretly\r\nadministered during sleep to a person who lies habitually with his mouth\r\nopen. This is fully proved by an interesting case which will be noticed\r\nunder the head of the moral evidence of poisoning. In that particular\r\ncase the individual immediately awoke, because the poison was\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid; but it may admit of question whether a\r\nsound sleeper might not swallow less irritating poisons without being\r\nawakened. In such circumstances no connexion of course could be traced\r\nbetween the taking of a suspected article and the first appearance of\r\nthe symptoms.\r\n\r\n5. Lastly, _the symptoms appear during a state of perfect health_. This\r\nis an important character, yet not universal; for it cannot be expected\r\nto apply to cases of slow poisoning, and poisons may be given while the\r\nperson is actually labouring under natural disease. Cases of the last\r\ndescription are generally very embarrassing; for if, instead of\r\nmedicine, a poison be administered, whose symptoms resemble the natural\r\ndisease, suspicion may not arise till it is too late to collect\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nIt must be apparent from the preceding observations, that the characters\r\ncommon to the symptoms of general poisoning are by no means universally\r\napplicable. Yet on reviewing them attentively it will also appear, that,\r\nconsidering the little knowledge possessed by the vulgar of the action\r\nof poisons, and consequently the rude nature of their attempts to commit\r\nmurder by poisoning, the exceptions to the general statements made above\r\nwill not be numerous.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to be seen how far these characters distinguish the\r\nsymptoms of poisoning from those of natural disease; and\r\n\r\n1. As to the _suddenness of their invasion and rapidity of their\r\nprogress_, it is almost needless to observe, that many natural diseases\r\ncommence with a suddenness and prove fatal with a rapidity, which few or\r\nno poisons can surpass. The plague may prove instantaneously fatal; and\r\neven the continued fever of this country may be fully formed in an hour,\r\nand may terminate fatally, as I have once witnessed, at the beginning of\r\nthe second day. Inflammation of the stomach also begins suddenly and\r\nterminates soon. Cholera likewise answers this description: I have known\r\nthe characters of ordinary cholera fully developed within an hour after\r\nthe first warning symptom, and frequently in hot climates, nay, in some\r\nrare instances even in Britain, it proves fatal in a few hours.\r\nMalignant cholera frequently proves fatal in a few hours. Inflammation\r\nof the intestines, too, may begin, or at least seem to begin, suddenly\r\nand end fatally in a day: One variety of it, now well known to affect\r\nthe mucous membrane, may remain quite latent till the gut is perforated\r\nby ulceration, and then the patient is attacked with acute pain,\r\nvomiting, and mortal faintness, and frequently perishes within\r\ntwenty-four hours.[74] But in particular many organic diseases of the\r\nheart prove suddenly fatal, without any previous warning; and this is\r\nalso true to a certain extent even of apoplexy; for, as will afterwards\r\nbe seen, it is an error to suppose that apoplexy is always, or even\r\ngenerally, preceded by warning symptoms. The first characteristic,\r\ntherefore, as applied to the symptoms of poisoning generally, contrasted\r\nwith those of general disease, must appear by no means distinctive. But\r\nopportunities will occur afterwards for showing, that it is sometimes a\r\ngood diagnostic in the case of particular poisons.[75]\r\n\r\n2. As to the uniformity or _uninterrupted increase of the symptoms_, it\r\nis equally the attribute of many common diseases. I am not aware, that\r\nin speedily fatal cases of the internal _phlegmasiæ_ a considerable\r\nremission is often observed. Apoplexy, too, very frequently continues\r\nits course without interruption; and the same may be said of cholera,\r\nand indeed of most acute diseases, when they prove rapidly fatal.\r\n\r\n3. It was stated above, that the third character, _uniformity in kind_\r\nthroughout their progress, is by no means an invariable circumstance.\r\nStill less is it distinctive; for many diseases are marked by great\r\nuniformity of symptoms. It has been enumerated nevertheless among the\r\ngeneral characters of poisoning, because, although its presence can\r\nhardly ever add any weight to the evidence in favour of death by poison,\r\nits absence may sometimes afford even positive proof in favour of\r\nnatural death. That is, changes of a certain kind occurring in the\r\nsymptoms during their progress may be incompatible with the known\r\neffects of a particular poison or of all poisons, and capable of being\r\naccounted for only on the supposition of natural disease having been at\r\nleast the ultimate cause of death. This statement, which is one of some\r\nimportance, is illustrated by a pointed case, that of Charles Munn,\r\nmentioned at the close of the present section.\r\n\r\n4. In the next place, it was observed that some reliance may be placed\r\non the fact, that the symptoms of poisoning _appear very soon after a\r\nmeal_. But we also know this to be the most frequent occasion on which\r\nsome natural disorders begin. An attack of apoplexy after a hearty meal\r\nis a common occurrence. That kind of cholera which follows the\r\nimmoderate use of acid fruit likewise comes on soon after eating.\r\nSometimes mere excessive distension of the stomach after a meal proves\r\nsuddenly or instantaneously fatal. Drinking cold water when the body is\r\nover-heated likewise causes at times immediate death. It appears that\r\nperforation of the stomach, the result of an insidious ulcer of its\r\ncoats, and likewise rupture of the stomach from mechanical causes, are\r\nmost apt to occur during the digestion, and therefore soon after the\r\ntaking of a meal.\r\n\r\nThese few observations will make it evident that the appearing of\r\nviolent symptoms soon after eating may arise from other causes besides\r\nthe administration of poison. At the same time, as the diseases which\r\nare apt to commence suddenly at that particular time are few in number,\r\nand none of them by any means frequent, it is always justly reckoned a\r\nvery suspicious circumstance; and when combined with certain points of\r\nmoral proof, such as that several people, who have eaten together, were\r\nseized about the same time with the same kind of symptoms, the evidence\r\nof general poisoning becomes very strong indeed. Sometimes the evidence\r\nfrom the date of their commencement after a meal may singly supply\r\nstrong evidence, as in the case of the mineral acids and alkalis, or\r\ncorrosive sublimate, which begin to act in a few seconds or minutes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the symptoms do not begin soon after food, drink,\r\nor medicine has been taken (the circumstances being such as to exclude\r\nthe possibility of poison being introduced by a wound, by the lungs, or\r\nby any other channel but the stomach), the presumption on the whole is\r\nagainst poisoning; and sometimes the evidence to this effect may be\r\ndecisive. The principle now propounded may be often a very important one\r\nin the practice of medical jurisprudence; for when united with a little\r\nknowledge of the symptoms antecedent to death, it may be sufficient to\r\ndecide the nature of the case. Thus it is sufficient, in my opinion, to\r\ndecide the celebrated case of the Crown Prince of Sweden. The prince,\r\nwhile in the act of reviewing a body of troops on the 28th May, 1810,\r\nwas observed suddenly to waver on his horse; and soon afterwards he fell\r\noff while at the gallop, was immediately found insensible by his staff,\r\nand expired in half an hour. As he was much beloved by the whole nation,\r\na rumour arose that he had been poisoned; and the report took such firm\r\nroot in the minds of all ranks, that a party of military, while\r\nescorting the body to Stockholm, were attacked near the city by the\r\npopulace, and their commander, Marshal Fersen, murdered; and Dr. Rossi,\r\nthe prince’s physician, after narrowly escaping the same fate, was in\r\nthe end obliged to quit his native country. Now, no other poison but one\r\nof the most active narcotics could have caused such symptoms, and none\r\nof them could have proved so quickly fatal unless given in a large dose.\r\nIt was proved, however, that on the day of his death the prince had not\r\ntaken any thing after he breakfasted; and an interval of nearly four\r\nhours elapsed after that till he fell from his horse. This fact alone,\r\nindependently of the marks of apoplexy found in the head after death,\r\nand the warning symptoms he repeatedly had, was quite enough to show\r\nthat he could not have died of poison, as it was incompatible with the\r\nknown action of the only poisons which could cause the symptoms. This is\r\nvery properly one of the arguments used by the Medical Faculty of\r\nStockholm, which was consulted on the occasion.[76]\r\n\r\nThe same circumstances will often enable us to decide at once a set of\r\ncases of frequent occurrence, particularly in towns,—where the sudden\r\ndeath of a person in a family, the members of which are on bad terms\r\nwith one another, is rashly and ignorantly imputed to poison, without\r\nany particular poison being pointed at; and where, consequently, unless\r\nthe morbid appearances clearly indicate the cause of death, a very\r\ntroublesome analysis might be necessary. In several cases of this kind,\r\nwhich have been submitted to me, I have been induced to dispense with an\r\nanalysis by resting on the criterion now under consideration. The\r\nfollowing is a good example.\r\n\r\nA middle-aged man, who had long enjoyed excellent health, one afternoon\r\nabout two o’clock returned home tired, and after having been severely\r\nbeaten by his wife went to bed. At a quarter past two one of his workmen\r\nfound him gasping, rolling his eyes, and quite insensible; and he died\r\nin a few minutes. As his wife had often maltreated and threatened him, a\r\nsuspicion arose that he had died of poison, and the body was in\r\nconsequence examined judiciously by Sir W. Newbigging and myself. The\r\nonly appearance of disease we could detect was a considerable\r\ntuberculation of the septum cordis and anterior parietes of both\r\nventricles. This disease might have been the cause of death; for there\r\nis no disease of the heart which may not remain long latent, and prove\r\nfatal suddenly. But, as the man never had a symptom referrible to\r\ndisease of the heart, it was impossible to infer, in face of a suspicion\r\nof poisoning, that it must have been the cause of death; since the man\r\nmight very well have died of poison, the disease of the heart continuing\r\nlatent. Poisoning, however, was out of the question. The man had taken\r\nnothing whatever after breakfasting about nine. Now no poison but one of\r\nthe most active narcotics in a large dose could cause death so rapidly\r\nas in this case; and the operation of such a poison in such a dose could\r\nnot be suspended so long as from nine till two. An analysis was\r\ntherefore unnecessary.\r\n\r\n5. Little need be said with regard to _the symptoms beginning, while the\r\nbody is in a state of perfect health_; because in truth almost all acute\r\ndiseases begin under the same circumstances. Connected with this\r\nsubject, however, a point of difference should be noticed which may be\r\nof use for distinguishing poisoning by the irritants from acute diseases\r\nof the inflammatory kind:—the latter rarely begin without some adequate\r\nand obvious natural cause.\r\n\r\nOn considering all that has now been said regarding the characteristics\r\nof the symptoms of general poisoning, as contrasted with those of\r\nnatural disease, no one can hesitate to allow, that from them alone a\r\nmedical jurist can never be entitled to pronounce that poisoning is\r\ncertain. At the same time he must not on that account neglect them. For,\r\nin the first place, they are of great value as generally giving him the\r\nfirst hints of the cause of mischief, and so leading him to search in\r\ntime for better evidence. Next, they will often enable him to say that\r\npoisoning was possible, probable, or highly probable; which, when the\r\nmoral evidence is very strong, may be quite enough to decide the case.\r\nThirdly, although they can never entitle him to say that poisoning was\r\ncertain, they will sometimes enable him to say, on the contrary, that it\r\nwas impossible. And to conclude, when the chemical or moral evidence\r\nproves that poison was given, the characters of the symptoms may be\r\nnecessary to determine whether it was the cause of death.\r\n\r\nAs the last statement is one of consequence, and yet has been overlooked\r\nby some authors on medical jurisprudence in this country, it may be\r\nillustrated by one or two comments. It does not follow, because a poison\r\nhas been given, that it is the cause of death; and therefore in every\r\nmedico-legal inquiry the cause of the first symptoms and the cause of\r\ndeath should be made two distinct questions. The question, whether a\r\npoison, proved to have been administered, was the cause of death, is to\r\nbe answered by attending to the second and third characteristics\r\nmentioned above, and considering whether the symptoms went on\r\nprogressively increasing, or altered their nature during the course of\r\nthe patient’s illness, and whether the alteration, if any, was such as\r\nmay occur in the case of poisoning generally, or of the special poison\r\ngiven. These remarks are very well exemplified by a case, of which I\r\nhave related the particulars elsewhere,[77] that, namely, of Charles\r\nMunn, tried at the Inverary Spring Circuit of 1824 for the double crime\r\nof procuring abortion, and of murder by poisoning. The moral evidence\r\nand symptoms together left no doubt that arsenic had been given, and\r\nthat the deceased, a girl with whom the prisoner cohabited, laboured\r\nunder the effects of that poison in a very aggravated and complex form\r\nfor twelve days. After that she began to recover rapidly, and in the\r\ncourse of a fortnight more was free of every symptom except weakness and\r\npains in the hands and feet: In short, all things considered, she was\r\nthought to be out of danger. But she then became affected with headache\r\nand sleeplessness, and died in nineteen days more under symptoms of\r\nobscure general fever, without any local inflammation. Dr. Duncan,\r\njunior, and I, who were consulted by the Crown in this case, were of\r\nopinion,—that granting the girl’s first illness, as appeared from moral\r\nand medical evidence, was owing to arsenic, her death could not be\r\nascribed to it with any certainty. It is true that in a few instances\r\nthe primary irritant symptoms caused by arsenic have been known to pass\r\ninto an obscure general fever, which has ended fatally; and that this\r\nmode of termination coincides with the effects ascribed to arsenic as\r\nthe chief ingredient in the celebrated _Aqua Toffana_. But the latter\r\nphenomena, at best of doubtful authenticity, are not represented to have\r\nbeen preceded by the ordinary symptoms of violent irritation, or to have\r\nbeen developed except under the use of continuous small doses; and as\r\nfor the more recent and less ambiguous cases of fever succeeding the\r\nusual primary effects of a large dose, in no instance yet recorded was\r\nthere an intermission between the two stages.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for the force of the evidence drawn from the characters\r\nof the symptoms of general poisoning. According to the example of\r\nothers, I might consider in the present place the force of evidence\r\nderived from the symptoms themselves, which distinguish the three\r\nclasses of poisons. But this subject, together with the special natural\r\ndiseases which imitate the symptoms of poisoning, will be treated of\r\nmore conveniently as an introduction to each of the classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n         SECTION II.—_Of the Evidence from Morbid Appearances._\r\n\r\nThe appearances left in the dead body after death by poison used\r\nformerly to be relied on as strongly as the symptoms during life; and\r\nwith even less reason. Except in the instance of a very few poisons, the\r\nmorbid appearances alone can never distinguish death by poison from the\r\neffects of natural disease, or from some other kinds of violent death.\r\nThere is not much room, therefore, for general remarks under the present\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nIt was at one time thought by the profession, and is still very\r\ngenerally imagined by the vulgar, that unusual blackness or lividity of\r\nthe skin, indicates death by poison generally. But every experienced\r\nphysician is now well aware, that excessive lividity is by no means\r\nuniversally produced by poison, and that it is likewise produced by so\r\nmany natural diseases as not even to form, in any circumstances\r\nwhatever, the slightest ground of suspicion. Neither is there any\r\ndifference in kind, as some imagine, between the lividity which succeeds\r\ndeath by poison, and that which follows natural death. Yet it is right\r\nfor the medical jurist to be aware that lividity as a supposed\r\nconsequence of poison ought to be strictly attended to by medical\r\ninspectors and law officers while investigating charges of poisoning,\r\nbecause the vulgar belief on the subject sometimes leads to such conduct\r\nor language on the part of the poisoner as betrays his secret at the\r\ntime, and constitutes evidence of his guilt afterwards.\r\n\r\nAnother appearance equally unimportant is early putrefaction of the\r\nbody. Early putrefaction, at one time much insisted on as a criterion of\r\npoisoning,[78] cannot even justify suspicion. It is by no means\r\ninvariably, or even generally caused by poisons; nay, sometimes a state\r\nprecisely the reverse appears to be induced;[79] and it is seen quite as\r\nfrequently after natural death.\r\n\r\nSome other appearances, not more conclusive, might also be mentioned\r\nhere; but they belong properly to the effects of individual poisons, or\r\nof classes of poisons, not to those of poisoning generally. It may\r\nmerely be remarked at present, therefore, that the appearances after\r\ndeath, which are really morbid, and which may be produced by poisons,\r\nare, in one great class, the signs of inflammation of the alimentary\r\ncanal in its progressive stages,—in another class, the signs of\r\ncongestion within the head,—and in a third, a combination of the effects\r\nof the two preceding classes; that neither set of appearances is\r\ninvariably caused by the poisons which usually cause them; that\r\ncongestion within the head is really seldom produced by those which are\r\ncurrently imagined to produce it; and that most of the appearances of\r\nboth kinds are exactly similar to those left by many natural diseases.\r\n\r\nBut although, on the whole, the appearances after death, when considered\r\nsingly, can seldom supply evidence of poisoning even to the amount of\r\nprobability, they may nevertheless prove very important under other\r\npoints of view. Thus, in connection with the symptoms and the general\r\nevidence, the appearances after death may furnish decisive proof; and\r\neven should the history of the symptoms be unknown, or have been\r\nunskilfully collected, the appearances after death, by pointing out the\r\nnature of the previous illness, may furnish evidence enough to decide\r\nthe case, when the moral proof is strong. Again, in cases of alleged\r\n_imputation of poisoning_ they are necessary to determine whether a\r\npoison actually found in the body was introduced during life or after\r\ndeath. Besides, the very absence of morbid appearances may afford\r\npresumptive proof in some circumstances,—when, for example, the question\r\nis, whether a person has died of apoplexy or of poisoning with\r\nnarcotics? Farther, a few poisons, as was formerly stated, occasionally\r\nproduce appearances so characteristic, as not to be capable of being\r\nconfounded with the effects of any other agent whatsoever: It will be\r\nfound hereafter, for example, that the mineral acids have at times left\r\nbehind them in the dead body unequivocal evidence of their operation.\r\nAnd finally, in cases where no doubt can be entertained that poison was\r\ntaken, the evidence from morbid appearances may be useful or necessary\r\nfor settling whether or not it was the cause of death. Two pointed\r\nexamples of this kind will be noticed under the next section.\r\n\r\nWhen signs of the action of poison are not found in the dead body, and\r\non the contrary marks are found of the operation of natural disease, the\r\npresumption of course is that the person died a natural death. But here\r\na few words of caution must be added with regard to the drawing of that\r\ninference in cases where the history of the symptoms is not known. It\r\ndoes not follow merely because certain appearances of natural disease\r\nare found, that their cause was the cause of death. For death may have\r\narisen from a totally different cause, such as poisoning. This remark is\r\nnot, as some may imagine, the offspring of hypothetical refinement, but\r\na necessary caution, drawn from actual and not unfrequent occurrences.\r\nThus, for example, the following cases will show, that there may be\r\nfound in the dead body diseased appearances, arising from pleurisy,\r\nhydrothorax, or peripneumony, sufficient to cause death, or to account\r\nfor death in ordinary circumstances; and that nevertheless the disease\r\nmay have been completely latent, and death have arisen from poison. In\r\nRust’s Magazin is related the case of a German apothecary, who poisoned\r\nhimself with prussic acid, and in whose body the lower lobe of the left\r\nlung was found consolidated and partly cartilaginous.[80] In Corvisart’s\r\nJournal an army-surgeon has described the case of a soldier, who died of\r\na few hours’ illness, and whose right lung was found after death forming\r\none entire abscess; yet to the very last day of his existence he daily\r\nunderwent all the fatigues of a military life; and in fact he died of\r\npoisoning with hemlock.[81] In Pyl’s Memoirs and Observations, there is\r\na similar account of a woman who enjoyed tolerable health, and died\r\nduring a fit of excessive drinking, and in whose body the whole left\r\nlung was found one mass of suppuration.[82] Under the next section will\r\nbe mentioned other equally pointed cases of death by poison, where the\r\napparent cause of death was external violence.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions to be drawn from these facts are that, at all events,\r\nthe medical inspector in a question of poisoning, must take care not to\r\nbe hurried away by the first striking appearances of natural disease\r\nwhich he may observe, and so be induced to conduct the rest of the\r\ninspection superficially; and likewise, that he should not so frame his\r\nopinion on the case, as to exclude the possibility of a different cause\r\nfrom the apparent one, unless the appearances are such as must\r\nnecessarily have been the cause of death. It may be said, that in\r\nrequiring this condition for an unqualified opinion, a rigour of\r\ndemonstration is exacted, which can rarely be attained in practice. But,\r\non the one hand, it must not be forgotten, that an unqualified opinion\r\nis not always necessary; and on the other hand, although it were, I\r\nthink it might be shown, if the subject did not lead to disproportionate\r\ndetails, that we may often approach very near the rigour of\r\ndemonstration required. At present no more need be said, than that the\r\ninspector should be particularly on his guard in those cases, in which\r\nthe appearances, though belonging to the effects of a deadly disease,\r\nare trifling; and still more in those in which the appearances, though\r\ngreat, belong to the effects of a disease, whose whole course may be\r\nlatent. And I may add, that, from what I have observed of medico-legal\r\nopinions, the caution now given is strongly called for.\r\n\r\nIt may be right to allude here also to another purpose which may be\r\nserved by a careful consideration of the morbid appearances. In cases in\r\nwhich the history of the symptoms is unknown or imperfect the extent and\r\nstate of progress of the appearances will sometimes supply strong\r\npresumptive evidence of the duration of the poisoning. This is an\r\nobvious and important application of the knowledge of the pathology of\r\npoisoning; but the simple mention of it is all which can be here\r\nattempted, as special rules can hardly be laid down on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n            SECTION III.—_Evidence from Chemical Analysis._\r\n\r\nThe chemical evidence in charges of poisoning is generally, and with\r\njustice, considered the most decisive of all the branches of proof. It\r\nis accounted most valid, when it detects the poison in the general\r\ntextures of the body, or in the blood, or in the stomach, intestines or\r\ngullet, then in the matter vomited, next in articles of food, drink or\r\nmedicine of which the sufferer has partaken, and lastly, in any articles\r\nfound in the prisoner’s possession, and for which he cannot account\r\nsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\nWhen poison is detected in any of these quarters, more especially in the\r\nstomach or intestines, it is seldom that any farther proof is needed to\r\nestablish the fact of poisoning. In two circumstances, however, some\r\ncorroboration is necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, in cases where a defence is attempted by a charge of\r\nimputation of poisoning it may be necessary to determine by an accurate\r\naccount of the symptoms, or by the morbid appearances, or by both\r\ntogether, whether the poison was introduced into the body before or\r\nafter death. For it is said, that attempts have been made to impute\r\ncrime by introducing poison into the stomach or anus of a dead body; and\r\nalthough I have not been able to find any authentic instance of so\r\nhorrible an act of ingenuity having been perpetrated, it must\r\nnevertheless be allowed to be quite possible.\r\n\r\nSecondly, an account of the symptoms and morbid appearances is still\r\nmore necessary, when the question at issue is, not so much whether\r\npoison has been given, as whether it was the cause of death, granting it\r\nhad been taken. Some remarks have been already made on this question in\r\nthe two former sections. In the present place some farther illustrations\r\nwill be added from two very striking cases. They are interesting in many\r\nrespects, and particularly as showing the importance of strict\r\nmedico-legal investigation: I am almost certain that but a few years ago\r\ntheir real nature would not have been discovered in this country. The\r\nfirst to be noticed occurred to Dr. Wildberg of Rostock. Wildberg was\r\nrequired to examine the body of a girl, who died while her father was in\r\nthe act of chastising her severely for stealing, and who was believed by\r\nall the bye-standers, and by the father himself, to have died of the\r\nbeating. Accordingly, Wildberg found the marks of many stripes on the\r\narms, shoulders and back, and under some of the marks blood was\r\nextravasated in considerable quantity. But these injuries, though\r\nsevere, did not appear to him adequate to account for death. He\r\ntherefore proceeded to examine the cavities; and on opening the stomach,\r\nhe found it very much inflamed, and lined with a white powder which\r\nproved on analysis to be arsenic. It turned out, that on the theft being\r\ndetected the girl had taken arsenic for fear of her father’s anger, that\r\nshe vomited during the flogging, and died in slight convulsions.\r\nConsequently, Wildberg very properly imputed death to the arsenic. In\r\nthis case the chemical evidence proved that poison had been taken; but\r\nan account of the symptoms and appearances was necessary to prove that\r\nshe died of it.[83] The other case occurred to Pyl in 1783. A woman at\r\nBerlin, who lived on bad terms with her husband, went to bed in perfect\r\nhealth; but soon afterwards her mother found her breathing very hard,\r\nand on inquiring into the cause discovered a wound in the left side of\r\nthe breast. A surgeon being immediately sent for, the hemorrhage which\r\nhad never been great, was checked without difficulty; but she died\r\nnevertheless towards morning. On opening the chest it appeared that the\r\nwound pierced into it, and penetrated the pericardium, but did not wound\r\nthe heart; and although the fifth intercostal artery had been divided,\r\nhardly any blood was effused into the cavity of the chest. Coupling\r\nthese circumstances with the trifling hemorrhage during life, and the\r\nfact that she had much vomiting, and some convulsions immediately before\r\ndeath, Pyl satisfied himself that she had not died of the wound: and\r\naccordingly the signs of corrosion in the mouth and throat, and of\r\nirritation in the stomach, with the subsequent discovery of the remains\r\nof some nitric acid in a glass in her room, proved that she had died of\r\npoison.[84]\r\n\r\n_Causes of the disappearance of poison from the body._—Chemical evidence\r\nis not always attainable in cases of poisoning. Various causes may\r\nremove the poison beyond reach. Hence although poison be not detected in\r\nthe body,—the experimenter being supposed skilful and the poison of a\r\nkind which is easily discovered,—still it must not be concluded from\r\nthat fact alone that poison has not been the cause of death. For that\r\nwhich was taken into the stomach may have been all discharged by\r\nvomiting and purging, or may have been all absorbed, or decomposed; and\r\nthat which has been absorbed into the system may have been all\r\ndischarged by the excretions.\r\n\r\n1. It may have been discharged by vomiting and purging. Thus on the\r\ntrial of George Thom for poisoning the Mitchells, held at Aberdeen at\r\nthe Autumn Circuit of 1821, it was clearly proved, that the deceased had\r\ndied of poisoning by arsenic; yet by a careful analysis none could be\r\ndetected in the stomach or its contents; for the man lived seven days,\r\nand during all that time laboured under frequent vomiting.[85] In a\r\nremarkable case related by Dr. Roget, arsenic could not be found in the\r\nmatter vomited twenty-four hours after it had been swallowed;[86] in\r\nanother related by Professor Wagner of Berlin, that of an infant who\r\ndied in twelve hours under incessant vomiting after receiving a small\r\nquantity of arsenic, none could be detected in the stomach;[87] in\r\nanother which I have described in a paper on arsenic, although the\r\nperson lived only five hours, the whole arsenic which could be detected\r\nin the tissues and contents of the stomach did not exceed a fifteenth\r\npart of a grain;[88] in an American Journal there is a striking case of\r\na grocer, who died eight hours after swallowing an ounce of arsenic, and\r\nin whose body none could be found chemically,—at a period however\r\nantecedent to the late improvements in analysis;[89] and in a case\r\ncommunicated to me not long ago by Mr. Hewson of Lincoln, where arsenic\r\nwas given in solution, and death ensued in five hours, none of the\r\npoison could be detected either in the contents or tissues of the\r\nstomach by a careful analysis conducted according to the most modern\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is singular how ineffectual vomiting proves in\r\nexpelling some poisons from the stomach. Those which are not easily\r\nsoluble, and have been taken in a state of minute division, may remain\r\nadhering to the villous coat, notwithstanding repeated and violent\r\nefforts to dislodge them by vomiting. Many instances to this effect have\r\noccurred in the instance of arsenic. Metzger has related a case, where,\r\nafter six hours of incessant vomiting, three drachms were found in the\r\nstomach.[90] Mr. Sidey, a surgeon of this city, has mentioned to me an\r\ninstance of poisoning with king’s yellow, in which he found the stomach\r\nlined with the poison, although the patient had vomited for thirty\r\nhours. In three cases which I have investigated arsenic was detected,\r\nalthough the people lived and vomited much for nearly two days;[91] and\r\nProfessor Orfila has noticed a similar instance in which that poison was\r\nfound in the contents of the stomach, although the person had vomited\r\nincessantly for two entire days.[92]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to specify the period after which a poison that has\r\nexcited vomiting need not be looked for in the stomach. It must vary\r\nwith a variety of circumstances whose combined effect it is almost\r\nimpossible to appreciate, such as the solubility and state of division\r\nof the poison, the frequency of vomiting, the substances taken as\r\nremedies, and the like. When the poison is in solution and the patient\r\nvomits much, an analysis may be expected to prove frequently abortive,\r\neven though the individual survives but a few hours, as in Mr. Hewson’s\r\ncase already noticed. In other circumstances, however, as various facts\r\nquoted above will show, poisons may frequently be found after two days\r\nincessant vomiting; and on the whole it may be stated, that the recent\r\nimprovements in analysis render the period much longer than it has\r\ngenerally been, and would naturally be imagined. Metzger has related the\r\ncase of a woman poisoned with arsenic mixed with currants, in whose\r\nbody, after eight days of frequent vomiting, he found ten or twelve\r\ncurrants, which gave out an odour of garlic when burnt;[93] but here the\r\ndose, if there was really arsenic, must have been repeated recently\r\nbefore death, for it is not possible to conceive how currants could\r\nremain in the stomach so long, whatever may be thought of the\r\npossibility of arsenic remaining. It is farther proper to add, that\r\nProfessor Henke of Erlangen, one of the highest living authorities in\r\nGermany, once found grains of arsenic in the gullet, although he found\r\nnone in any other part of the body, of a person who survived the taking\r\nof the poison four days.[94] Allowing to this fact all the weight\r\nderived from the high name of its author, I must nevertheless express\r\ngreat doubt whether the arsenic was not repeated more recently before\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n2. The poison may have disappeared, because it has been all absorbed. It\r\nhas several times happened that in the bodies of those poisoned with\r\nlaudanum, or even with solid opium, none of the drug could be detected\r\nafter death. Sometimes indeed it is found, even though the individual\r\nsurvived the taking of the poison many hours. Thus a case related by\r\nMeyer of Berlin, in which the person lived ten hours after taking the\r\nsaffron-tincture of opium; and nevertheless it was detected in the\r\nstomach by a mixed smell of saffron and opium.[95] But more commonly it\r\nall disappears, unless the dose has been very large. In a case of\r\npoisoning with laudanum, which I examined here along with Sir W.\r\nNewbigging in 1823, none could be detected, although strong moral\r\ncircumstances left no doubt that laudanum had been swallowed seven or\r\neight hours before death. An instance of the same kind has been minutely\r\nrelated by Pyl. It was that of an infant who was poisoned with a mixture\r\nof opium and hyoscyamus, and in whose stomach and intestines none could\r\nbe detected by the smell.[96] Similar observations have been often made\r\non animals; and several additional cases of the same purport, occurring\r\nin man, will be related under the head of opium.\r\n\r\nIt might be of use to quote some of the numerous errors committed by\r\nmedical witnesses, in consequence of having overlooked the effect of\r\nabsorption in removing poisons beyond the reach of chemical analysis.\r\nBut not to be too prolix, I shall be content with mentioning a single\r\nvery distinct case in point, which happened at a Coroner’s Inquest in\r\nLondon, in 1823. A young man one evening called his fellow-lodger to his\r\nbedside; assured him he had taken laudanum, and should be dead by the\r\nmorrow; and desired him to carry his last farewell to his mother and his\r\nmistress. His companion thought he was shamming; but next morning the\r\nunfortunate youth was found in the agonies of death. The moral evidence\r\nwas not very satisfactory; but that is of little consequence to my\r\npresent object. The point in the case I would particularly refer to is\r\nthe declaration of the medical inspector, that laudanum could not have\r\nbeen taken, because he did not find any by the smell or by chemical\r\nanalysis in the contents of the stomach.[97]\r\n\r\n3. Poisons may not be found, because the excess has been decomposed.\r\n\r\nVegetable and animal poisons may be altogether destroyed by the process\r\nof digestion. This observation will explain why sometimes no poison\r\ncould be found in cases of poisoning with crude opium or other vegetable\r\nsolids. A French physician, M. Desruelles, has related the case of a\r\nsoldier, who died six hours and a half after swallowing two drachms of\r\nsolid opium, and in whose stomach nothing was found but a yellowish\r\nfluid, quite destitute of the smell of the drug.[98]\r\n\r\nSome mineral poisons, such as corrosive sublimate, lunar caustic, and\r\nhydrochlorate of tin, are also decomposed in the stomach. But they are\r\nnot removed beyond the reach of chemical analysis. The decomposition is\r\nthe result of a chemical, not of a vital process; and the basis of the\r\npoison may be found in the solid contents of the stomach under some\r\nother compound form. Other poisons again may be apt to elude detection\r\nby altering their form, by combining with other substances, without\r\nthemselves undergoing decomposition. Thus it appears from a case related\r\nby Mertzdorff of Berlin, that, in poisoning with sulphuric acid, after\r\nthe greater part of the poison is discharged by vomiting, the remainder\r\nmay escape discovery by being neutralized: For, although he could not\r\nfind any free acid in the contents of the stomach, he discovered 4½\r\ngrains in union with ammonia by precipitation with muriate of\r\nbaryta.[99]\r\n\r\nIt may be also right to mention another kind of decomposition which may\r\nrender it impossible to detect a poison that has been really\r\nswallowed—namely, that arising from decay of the body. In several recent\r\ncases bodies have been disinterred and examined for poison months or\r\neven years after death. In these and similar cases it would be\r\nunreasonable to expect always to find the poison, even though it existed\r\nin the stomach immediately after death. Some poisons, such as oxalic\r\nacid, might be dissolved and then exude; others, such as the vegetable\r\nnarcotics, will undergo putrefaction; and others, such as prussic acid,\r\nare partly volatilized, partly decomposed, so as to be undistinguishable\r\nin the course of a few days only. The mineral poisons, those at least\r\nwhich are solid, are not liable to be so dissipated or destroyed. Some\r\nauthors, indeed, have said that arsenic may disappear in consequence of\r\nits uniting with hydrogen disengaged during the progress of\r\nputrefaction, and so escaping in the form of arseniuretted-hydrogen gas;\r\nand they have endeavoured to account in this way for the non-discovery\r\nof it in the bodies of the people who had been killed by arsenic, and\r\ndisinterred for examination many months afterwards.[100] But the\r\nsupposition is by no means probable: at least arsenic has been detected\r\nin the body fourteen months, nay, even seven years, after interment. For\r\nfarther details, on this curious topic, the reader may turn to the\r\narticle Arsenic.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the result of the most recent researches is that the\r\neffect of the spontaneous decay of dead animal matter in involving\r\npoisons in the general decomposition appears to be much less\r\nconsiderable than might be anticipated. For this most important\r\nmedico-legal fact, the toxicologist is indebted to the experimental\r\ninquiries of MM. Orfila and Lesueur.[101] The poisons tried by them\r\nwere—sulphuric and nitric acids, arsenic, corrosive sublimate,\r\ntartar-emetic, sugar of lead, protomuriate of tin, blue vitriol,\r\nverdigris, lunar caustic, muriate of gold, acetate of morphia, muriate\r\nof brucia, acetate of strychnia, hydrocyanic acid, opium, and\r\ncantharides. They found that after a time the acids become neutralized\r\nby the ammonia disengaged during the decay of animal matter;—that by the\r\naction of the animal matter the salts of mercury, antimony, copper, tin,\r\ngold, silver, and likewise the salts of the vegetable alkaloids, undergo\r\nchemical decomposition, in consequence of which the bases become less\r\nsoluble in water, or altogether insoluble;—that acids may be detected\r\nafter several years’ interment, not always, however, in the free\r\nstate;—that the bases of the decomposed metallic salts may also be found\r\nafter interment for several years;—that arsenic, opium, and cantharides\r\nundergo little change after a long interval of time, and are scarcely\r\nmore difficult to discover in decayed, than in recent animal\r\nmixtures;—but that hydrocyanic acid disappears very soon, so as to be\r\nundistinguishable in the course of a few days.\r\n\r\n4. Lastly, the poison which has been absorbed into the system, and may\r\nconsequently be detected in certain circumstances in the textures of the\r\nbody at a distance from the alimentary canal, may also be removed beyond\r\nthe reach of analysis, by being gradually discharged along with the\r\nexcretions. It has been fully proved in recent times, that in poisoning\r\nwith arsenic the poison may be found in ordinary cases, for some days\r\nafter being swallowed, in the liver especially, but also in the other\r\ntextures, in the blood, and in the urine; but that if a flow of urine be\r\nestablished and kept up, in nine or ten days, and sometimes much sooner,\r\nit can no longer be discovered anywhere by the nicest analysis.[102]\r\n\r\n_Is the discovery of poison in the body or the evacuations essential to\r\nestablish a charge of poisoning?_ It was mentioned at the commencement\r\nof the present section, that the chemical evidence is generally, and\r\ncorrectly, considered the most decisive of all the branches of proof in\r\ncases of poisoning. But some toxicologists have even gone so far as to\r\nmaintain that without chemical evidence, or rather, in more general\r\nterms, without the discovery of poison either in the body itself or in\r\nthe evacuations,—no charge of poisoning ought to be held as proved.\r\nThis, however, is a doctrine to which I cannot assent. In the preceding\r\nobservations on the evidence of general poisoning it has been several\r\ntimes alluded to as unsound; and repeated opportunities of establishing\r\nexceptions will occur in the course of this work, under the head of\r\nindividual poisons. At present it may be well to illustrate its\r\nunsoundness in reference to those charges of poisoning, where no\r\nparticular poison is pointed at by the medical evidence, but where a\r\nwhole class of poisons must be kept more or less in view. Even here I\r\napprehend there may be sufficient evidence in the symptoms and morbid\r\nappearances, without any chemical facts,—to render poisoning so highly\r\nprobable, that in conjunction with strong moral evidence, no sensible\r\nman can entertain any doubt on the subject. Several illustrations might\r\nbe here given; and some will be found scattered throughout the work. In\r\nthe present place a few instances will be mentioned which cannot be\r\nconveniently arranged any where else, and which are well worthy of\r\nnotice, as being striking examples of the decision of questions of\r\npoisoning without chemical evidence.\r\n\r\nA man of doubtful character and morals, well acquainted with chemistry\r\nand medical jurisprudence, and of disordered finances, was known to\r\nharbour a design on a friend’s wife, who possessed a considerable\r\nfortune. At last he one morning invited the husband to breakfast with\r\nhim at a tavern; and they breakfasted, in a private apartment, on\r\nbeef-steaks, fried potatoes, eels, claret, and rum. They had scarcely\r\ncommenced the meal when his guest complained of feeling unwell; and soon\r\nafterwards he vomited violently. This symptom continued, along with\r\nexcruciating pain in the belly, for a long time before the prisoner sent\r\nfor medical aid; indeed he did not procure a physician till the sufferer\r\nhad been also attacked with very frequent and involuntary purging. The\r\nphysician, who, before seeing his patient, had received the prisoner’s\r\nexplanation of the apparent cause of the illness, was led at first to\r\nimpute the whole to cholera caught by exposure to cold; but on returning\r\nat seven in the evening, and finding the gentleman had been dead for an\r\nhour, he at once exclaimed that he had been poisoned. On the body being\r\ninspected much external lividity was found, contraction of the fingers,\r\nand great inflammation of the stomach and intestines, presenting an\r\nappearance like that of gangrene.[103] On analyzing some fluid left in\r\nthe stomach, no arsenic or other poison could be detected. The attention\r\nof the inspectors was turned specially to arsenic, because the prisoner\r\nwas proved to have bought that poison, and to have made a solution of\r\nsome white powder in his kitchen not long before the deceased died. The\r\nprisoner in his defence stated, that the deceased had been for some time\r\nmuch weakened by the use of mercury, and while in this state was seized\r\nwith cholera; and he likewise attempted to make it probable that the\r\nman, in despair at his not recovering from a venereal disease, might\r\nhave committed suicide. The council of physicians who were required to\r\ngive their opinion on the case state on the contrary, that the diseased\r\nwas a healthy man, without any apparent disposition to disease; that\r\nthere was no pretext whatever for supposing suicide; that the\r\ninflammatory state of the stomach and bowels supplied strong probability\r\nof poisoning with arsenic, but not certain evidence; that acute\r\ngastritis from natural causes is always attended with constipation; that\r\nthe deceased presented symptoms of stupor and other signs of derangement\r\nof the nervous system remarked in rapid cases of poisoning with arsenic;\r\nthat cholera is very rare at the end of November, the season when this\r\nincident occurred; and that the poison might well be discharged by\r\nvomiting. Although all the prisoner’s statements in defence were\r\ncontradicted by satisfactory proof, and the medical evidence of\r\npoisoning was supported by a chain of the strongest general\r\ncircumstances, the crime was considered by the court as not fully\r\nproved, because the prisoner could not be induced to confess, and\r\nbecause poison was not actually detected in the body. But on account of\r\nthe very strong probability of his guilt, he was, in conformity with the\r\nstrange practice of German courts in the like cases, condemned to\r\nfifteen years’ imprisonment.[104] In this instance—considering the kind\r\nof symptoms, their commencement during a meal, the rapidity of death,\r\nthe signs of violent inflammation in the stomach after so short an\r\nillness, and the facility with which the absence of poison in the\r\ncontents of the stomach may be accounted for, more especially if it be\r\nsupposed that the poison was administered in solution,—I consider the\r\nmedical evidence of death by poisoning so very strong, that, the general\r\nevidence being also extremely strong, the prisoner’s guilt was fully\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nA case of the same kind, but of still greater interest, is that of Mary\r\nAnne M’Conkey, who was tried at the Monaghan Assizes in 1841 for the\r\nmurder of her husband. I am indebted for the particulars to Dr.\r\nGeoghegan, one of the principal Crown witnesses. The prisoner who had\r\nbeen too intimate with another man, and had been heard to express her\r\nintention of getting rid of her husband, was observed one day before\r\ndinner to separate some greens for him from the plateful intended for\r\nthe rest of the family. None of the latter suffered at all. But her\r\nhusband was taken violently ill immediately after dinner, and died; and\r\na neighbour accidentally present, who partook, though sparingly, of the\r\nsame dish with him, was also similarly and violently affected but\r\nrecovered. The deceased before finishing the greens said they had a\r\ndisagreeable sharp taste, and was seized soon after with burning at the\r\nheart, tenderness at the pit of the stomach, vomiting, coldness, a sense\r\nof biting in the tongue and tingling through the whole flesh, excessive\r\nrestlessness, occasional incoherence, locked-jaw, clenching of the\r\nhands, and frothing at the mouth; and he expired three hours after the\r\nmeal. His neighbour, two minutes after finishing his greens, experienced\r\na sense of pricking in the mouth and burning in the throat, gullet, and\r\nstomach; then salivation, a feeling of swelling in the face without\r\nactual fulness, general numbness and creeping in the skin; next\r\nexcessive restlessness, coldness of the integuments, dimness of sight,\r\nand stupor; about an hour after the meal he became speechless,\r\nrepeatedly fainted, frothed at the mouth, and clenched his hands;\r\nvomiting ensued, with considerable relief, and subsequently he had\r\nfrequent attacks of it, with purging, tenderness of the epigastrium,\r\ncramps, and tingling in the flesh; and from these symptoms he recovered\r\nso slowly as to be unable to work for five weeks. The only morbid\r\nappearance of any note in the body of the deceased was a number of\r\nirregular brownish-black patches on the inside of the stomach. No poison\r\ncould be detected in the contents or tissues of the stomach; none could\r\nbe discovered in the house except a corrosive-sublimate solution which\r\nthe prisoner used for a gargle; and none could be traced into her\r\npossession. A variety of circumstances of a general nature, which are\r\npassed over here for brevity, as not strictly appertaining to the\r\npresent view of the case, threw very great suspicion over the prisoner.\r\nThe medical witnesses deposed, that poisoning could alone explain the\r\nmedical circumstances; and Dr. Geoghegan was of opinion that death was\r\nowing to some vegetable poison, although he could not specify the\r\nparticular substance. He suspected, however, that it was monkshood. In\r\nthese views, when consulted by him before the trial, I entirely\r\nconcurred. Considering the taste observed by the deceased at the time he\r\nate the greens, the rapidity with which he was taken ill afterwards, and\r\nthe very peculiar symptoms, unlike those of any natural disease with\r\nwhich physicians are acquainted, and agreeing with those which are\r\nproduced by monkshood,—considering also that another individual, who\r\npartook of the same dish with him, was similarly and simultaneously\r\nattacked, and with a severity proportioned to the quantity he took,\r\nwhile other persons who ate the same food from a different dish, did not\r\nsuffer at all,—it appears to me that poisoning was clearly established;\r\nand I also think that the general evidence brought home the charge of\r\nadministering the poison to the prisoner. She was condemned and\r\nexecuted, and confessed before execution, that she did poison her\r\nhusband, and that the substance she used was the powdered root of\r\nmonkshood, which is well known as a poison to the peasantry of Monaghan\r\nunder the name of Blue Rocket.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to add, that great caution must be observed in\r\napplying the general principle here inculcated. But the opposite\r\ndoctrine, that no charge of poisoning can be established without the\r\ndiscovery of poison in the body or in the evacuations, appears to me a\r\ngreat error, though upheld by no mean authority. Under that doctrine few\r\ncriminals would be brought to justice, were they to resort to a variety\r\nof vegetable poisons, which in certain seasons are within the reach of\r\nevery one.\r\n\r\n\r\n          SECTION IV.—_Evidence from Experiments on Animals._\r\n\r\nEvidence from experiments on animals with articles supposed to contain\r\npoison is more equivocal than was once imagined. But it may be doubted\r\nwhether some medical jurists have not overstepped the proper limits,\r\nwhen they hold it to constitute little or no proof at all.\r\n\r\nEvidence from express experiments should rarely form part of a regular\r\nmedical inquiry into a charge of poisoning. For in the first place, to\r\nmake sure of performing an experiment well requires more experimental\r\nskill than the generality of practitioners can be expected to possess;\r\nthen, as will seen in the sequel, evidence procured from this source can\r\nvery rarely be more than presumptive; and lastly, if the quantity of\r\npoison in the suspected substance is great enough to affect one of the\r\nperfect animals, it may generally be recognized to a certainty by its\r\nphysical or chemical properties.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons it is not likely, that, in an inquiry undertaken by a\r\nskilful toxicologist, he will put himself in the way of delivering an\r\nopinion on the force of such evidence. But it is nevertheless necessary\r\nfor me to consider it in detail, because he may have to give his opinion\r\nregarding experiments made inconsiderately by others, or accidents\r\ncaused by domestic animals eating the remains of substances suspected to\r\nbe poisoned.\r\n\r\nThe matter subjected to trial may be either suspected food, drink, or\r\nmedicine; or it may be the stuff vomited during life, or found in the\r\nstomach after death; or it may be the flesh of poisoned animals.\r\n\r\n1. The evidence derived from _the effects of suspected food, drink, or\r\nmedicine_ is better than that drawn from the effects of the vomited\r\nmatter or contents of the stomach. But an important objection has been\r\nmade to both, namely, that what is poison to man is not always poison to\r\nthe lower animals, and that, on the other hand, some of the lower\r\nanimals are poisoned by substances not hurtful to man.\r\n\r\nA good deal of obscurity still hangs over the relative effects of\r\npoisons on man and the lower animals. There are two species, however,\r\nwhose mode of life in respect to food closely resembles our own, and\r\nwhich, according to innumerable experiments by Orfila, are affected by\r\nalmost all poisons exactly in the same way as ourselves, namely, the cat\r\nand dog, but particularly the latter.\r\n\r\nIn general poisons act less violently on these animals; thus two drachms\r\nof opium are required to kill a middle-sized dog,[105] while twenty\r\ngrains have killed a man, and undoubtedly less would be sufficient. It\r\nappears that one poison, alcohol, acts more powerfully on them than on\r\nman. There are also some poisons, such as opium, which, although\r\ndeleterious to them as well as to man, nevertheless produce in general\r\ndifferent symptoms. Yet the differences alluded to are probably not\r\ngreater than exist between man and man in regard to the same substances;\r\nand therefore it may be assumed, that, on the whole, the effects of\r\npoisons on man differ little from those produced on the dog and cat.\r\n\r\nThe present objection is generally and perhaps justly considered a\r\nstronger one, when it is applied to other species of animals. But it\r\nmust be confessed after all, that our knowledge of the diversities in\r\nthe action of poisons on different animals is exceedingly vague, and\r\nfounded on inaccurate research; and there is much reason to suspect,\r\nthat, if the subject is studied more deeply, the greater number of the\r\nalleged diversities will prove rather apparent than real. Both reasoning\r\nand experiment, indeed, render it probable, that some orders, even of\r\nthe perfect animals, such as the _Ruminantia_, are much less sensible\r\nthan man to many poisons, and especially to poisons of the vegetable\r\nkingdom. But so far as maybe inferred from the only accurate inquires on\r\nthe subject, their effects differ in degree more than in kind. Some\r\nexceptions will without doubt be found to this statement. For example,\r\noxalic acid, besides inflaming the stomach, causes violent convulsions\r\nin animals, but in man it for the most part excites merely excessive\r\nprostration; and opium most generally excites in man pure sopor, in\r\nanimals convulsions also. Other exceptions, too, exist by reason of\r\nfunctional peculiarities in certain animals. Thus irritant poisons do\r\nnot cause vomiting in rabbits or horses, because these animals cannot\r\nvomit; neither do they appear to cause much pain to rabbits, because\r\nrabbits have not the power of expressing pain with energy. But\r\nexceptions like these, and particularly such as are unconnected with\r\nfunctional peculiarities, will probably prove fewer in number, and less\r\nstriking than is currently imagined. For it is, on the other hand, well\r\nascertained, that many, indeed most of the active poisons whose effects\r\nhave been examined by a connected train of experiments, produce nearly\r\nthe same effects on all animals whatever from the highest to the lowest\r\nin the scale of perfection. It has been fully proved, that arsenic,\r\ncopper, mercury, the mineral acids, opium, strychnia, conia, white\r\nhellebore, hydrocyanic acid, cyanogen gas, sulphuretted hydrogen, and\r\nmany others, produce nearly the same effects on man, quadrupeds, birds,\r\namphibious animals, and even on fishes and insects.[106]\r\n\r\nAccordingly there are cases, in which the evidence from experiments on\r\nanimals with suspected articles of food is unequivocal. For example;—a\r\nsexton and his wife, who had got a bad name in their village in\r\nconsequence of informing against the bailiff for smuggling, and who were\r\non that account shunned by all the neighbours, accused the bailiff and\r\nhis wife of having tried to poison them by mixing poison with their\r\nbread. Immediately after eating they were attacked, they said, with\r\nsickness, griping, swelling, and dizziness; and they added, that a cat\r\nwas seized with convulsions after eating a part of it, had sprung away,\r\nand never returned. A large portion of the loaf was therefore sent to\r\nthe Medical Inspector of the district; who reported, that it seemed\r\nexactly similar to another unsuspected loaf;—that, although he was not\r\nable to detect any poison, it might after all contain one,—vegetable\r\npoison particularly;—but that he could hardly believe it did, for he fed\r\na dog, a cat, and a fowl several days with it, and they not only did not\r\nsuffer any harm, but even appeared very fond of it.[107] In this case it\r\nwas clear that poisoning was out of the question. On the other hand, the\r\neffects of some poisons on man may be developed so characteristically in\r\nanimals as to supply pointed evidence. Thus, in the case of Mary\r\nBateman, an infamous fortune-teller and charm-worker, who after cheating\r\na poor family for a series of years, at last tried to avoid detection by\r\npoisoning them, it was justly accounted good evidence, that a portion of\r\nthe pudding and the honey, supposed to have been poisoned, caused\r\nviolent vomiting in a cat, killed three fowls, and proved fatal to a dog\r\nin four days, under symptoms of irritation of the stomach such as were\r\nobserved in the people who died.[108]\r\n\r\nIt has been farther objected to experiments on animals with suspected\r\narticles of food, drink, or medicine, that it is difficult to administer\r\npoison to them in a state of concentration, and to prevent it from being\r\ndischarged by vomiting. This objection, however, may be obviated by\r\nperforming the experiment in the way recommended by Professor Orfila. A\r\nsmall opening is made into the gullet, previously detached from its\r\nsurrounding connexions, the liquid part is introduced by a funnel thrust\r\ninto the opening, and the solid portion previously made into little\r\npellets is then squeezed down. Lastly, the gullet is tied under the\r\naperture. The immediate effect of the operation is merely an appearance\r\nof languor; and no very serious symptom is observable till four or five\r\ndays at soonest after the tying of the gullet. Hence if signs of\r\npoisoning commence within twenty-four hours, they are independent of the\r\ninjury done by the operation.[109] This process requires some adroitness\r\nto execute it well. It cannot be tried successfully but by a practised\r\noperator, who, for reasons already given, would hardly ever try\r\nexperiments of the kind with suspected articles. Mention is here made of\r\nit, therefore, chiefly because it is the best mode of experimenting in\r\nthose cases in which it is necessary, as will presently be seen, to\r\ndetermine disputed points in the physiology of poisons.\r\n\r\nI may here shortly notice a method which has been lately proposed for\r\ndetecting poisons that enter the blood, and which is founded on their\r\neffects on animals. M. Vernière suggests that advantage may be taken of\r\nthe extreme sensibility of the medicinal leech to procure at least\r\npresumptive evidence, when no evidence can be procured in any other\r\nmanner. He has related some experiments to prove that the leech, when\r\nplaced in the blood of dogs killed by nux-vomica, is affected even when\r\nthe quantity of the poison is exceedingly small.[110] It is extremely\r\ndoubtful whether any importance can be attached to this criterion, as\r\nevery one knows that the leech is apt to suffer from a variety of\r\nobscure causes, and among the rest from some diseased states of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n2. In the case of _the vomited matter_ or _contents of the stomach_\r\nthere are other and weightier objections to experiments on animals.—In\r\nthe first place, the poison which has caused death may have been either\r\nin part or wholly vomited before-hand, or absorbed, or transmitted into\r\nthe intestines, or decomposed by the process of digestion. Secondly,\r\nthough abounding in the matter vomited or which remains in the stomach,\r\nit may be so much diluted, as not to have any effect on an animal. And,\r\nthirdly, the animal fluids secreted during disease are believed to act\r\noccasionally as poisons.\r\n\r\nThe first two objections are so plainly conclusive as scarcely to\r\nrequire any illustration. It may be well, however, to mention as a\r\npointed practical lesson, that Professor Orfila once detected a\r\nconsiderable quantity of arsenic in the contents of the stomach, where a\r\nprior investigation had shown that the same article produced no effect\r\non two animals, and where the reporters from this and other\r\ncircumstances declared, that in their opinion death was not owing to\r\npoison.[111]\r\n\r\nThe last objection is a very important one; but there is reason for\r\nsuspecting that it has been a good deal exaggerated by medical\r\njurists.—Animal fluids are certainly poisonous when putrid. The repeated\r\nand fatal experience of anatomists, together with the precise\r\nexperiments of M. Gaspard and M. Magendie,[112] leave no doubt that\r\nputrid animal fluids, when introduced into an external wound, cause\r\nspreading inflammation of the cellular tissue; and although Magendie\r\nsays he has found such fluids harmless when introduced into the stomach\r\nof dogs,[113] it is probable, from their effects on man, that they will\r\nact as irritants on animals not habituated to their use. I believe, too,\r\nthat independently of putrefaction, vomited matter or the contents of\r\nthe stomach may be apt to make dogs vomit on account of their nauseous\r\ntaste; and perhaps we may infer, that they will also cause some of the\r\nother symptoms of poisoning with the irritants, particularly if not\r\nvomited soon after being administered.—As to the influence of disease in\r\nrendering the contents of the stomach deleterious, it is to be observed\r\nthat the effects just mentioned are probably owing to the influence of\r\ndisease on the secretions, but that beyond this we know very little of\r\nthe subject. In authors I have hitherto found only one fact to prove\r\nthat disease can render the contents of the stomach decidedly poisonous;\r\nand on the negative side of the question there exists no facts at all.\r\nMorgagni describes the case of a child who died of tertian ague, amidst\r\nconvulsions, and in whose stomach a greenish bile was found, which\r\nproved so deleterious, that a little of it given with bread to a cock\r\ncaused convulsions and death in a few minutes, and a scalpel stained\r\nwith it, when thrust into the flesh of two pigeons, killed them in the\r\nsame manner.[114] It is not easy to say what to think of this\r\nexperiment; which, if admitted to the full extent of the conclusions\r\ndeducible from it, would lead to the admission, that disease may impart\r\nto the secretions the properties of the most active narcotics. Farther\r\nresearches are certainly required before this admission can be made\r\nunreservedly.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it appears that in the present state of our knowledge,\r\nexperiments or accidental observations on the effects of the contents of\r\nthe stomach, or of vomited matter, on animals are equivocal in their\r\nimport. At the same time it may be observed, as with regard to articles\r\nof food, drink, or medicine, that the effects of some poisons on man may\r\nbe developed so characteristically on animals by the contents of the\r\nstomach, as to supply very pointed evidence indeed. Of the force of this\r\nstatement the following example is a striking illustration. In the case\r\nof a girl, who was proved to have died of accidental poisoning with\r\nlaudanum, the inspector evaporated the contents of the stomach to\r\ndryness, made an alcoholic extract from the residue, and giving this to\r\nseveral dogs, chickens, and frogs, found that they were all made\r\nlethargic by it, some of them oftener than once, and that a few died\r\ncomatose.[115] Facts such as these, agreeing so pointedly with the known\r\neffects of the poison suspected, appear to me to yield evidence almost\r\nunimpeachable.\r\n\r\n3. The effects of _the flesh of poisoned animals_, eaten by other\r\nanimals, constitute the least conclusive of all the varieties of the\r\npresent branch of evidence. For the flesh of animals that have died of\r\npoisoning is not always deleterious; while on the other hand flesh is\r\nsometimes rendered so by natural causes, as will be seen in the Chapter\r\non Diseased and Decayed Animal Matter.\r\n\r\nThis subject stands much in need of careful and methodic investigation.\r\nAnd it is of more practical importance than might be imagined at first\r\nsight. For the question has actually occurred in a legal inquiry in this\r\ncountry,—Whether poisoning in the human subject may be caused by the\r\nflesh of a poisoned animal?\r\n\r\nIn regard to some poisons it is well established, that animals killed by\r\nthem may be eaten with impunity, such as game killed with the wourali\r\npoison, or fish by cocculis-indicus. This seems the general rule. But it\r\nis not clear that all poisons are similarly circumstanced.\r\n\r\nThe only systematic researches hitherto undertaken on this question are\r\nsome recently made at Lucca by Professor Gianelli; of which however I\r\nhave only seen an abstract. He found that the blood, urine, and lungs of\r\nanimals poisoned with arsenic acted as a poison on small birds, such as\r\nsparrows, whether the parts were taken from the body while the animal\r\nwas alive, or after death; but that alcohol, cherry-laurel water,\r\ncorrosive sublimate, sulphate of copper, tartar-emetic, acetate of lead,\r\nnitrate of silver, trisnitrate of bismuth, chloride of tin, sulphate of\r\nzinc, laudanum, acetate of morphia, strychnia, and cantharides, had no\r\nsuch effect.[116] Orfila has since shown some reason for doubting the\r\nconclusiveness of Gianelli’s investigations; and on repeating them,\r\nobtained such results as render it doubtful whether any reliance can be\r\nput upon experiments made upon small birds.[117] Guérard however has\r\nascertained, that dogs, fed on the flesh and entrails of sheep which had\r\ntaken arsenic, were attacked with vomiting and purging, became reduced\r\nin flesh, and at length would not eat what was put before them; but none\r\nof them perished, or seem to have been seriously ill. Arsenic was\r\ndetected in their urine.[118]\r\n\r\nThe importance of the inquiry, which the preceding experiments are\r\nintended to elucidate, will appear from the following singular case, for\r\nthe particulars of which I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Jamieson\r\nof Aberdeen, who was employed by the authorities to investigate it. An\r\nelderly woman, who kept fowls which occasionally trespassed on a\r\nneighbour’s fields, one morning observed four of them very sickly; and\r\nin the course of the day they became so ill that she killed them. She\r\ncleaned and prepared two of them for cooking, buried another, and gave\r\naway the fourth to a beggar, who was afterwards lost sight of. Next day\r\nsoup made with the half of one of the fowls was given to a little girl,\r\nwho suffered severely from sickness and vomiting, and also to a cat,\r\nwhich was similarly affected for the whole evening. On the day\r\nafterwards the woman herself and a female lodger, took broth made with\r\nwhat remained of the fowls, and also ate the gizzards; but the remainder\r\nwas thrown with the offal upon the dunghill. In the course of five or\r\nsix hours both women were attacked with severe illness. One had\r\nsickness, vomiting and great coldness; but after encouraging the\r\nvomiting with hot water and then taking some spirits, she got better in\r\nthe night-time, and next morning was pretty well. The other, who was the\r\nowner of the fowls, was seized somewhat later than her friend with great\r\nthirst and shivering, and next day with pains in the stomach, severe\r\nsickness, and fruitless efforts to vomit. On the sixth day, when a\r\nmedical man first saw her, she had great pain throughout the abdomen,\r\nmuch thirst, difficult breathing, a red, dry tongue, and a very\r\nfrequent, small pulse. Next day the pain and difficult breathing became\r\nworse; and in the evening, after an attack of sneezing, she became\r\ngradually insensible and motionless, in which state she remained till\r\nthe tenth day, when she expired. The stomach and intestines did not\r\npresent any distinct morbid appearance; but the vessels of the brain\r\nwere turgid, there were about two ounces of serosity in the lateral\r\nventricles, both corpora striata were softened anteriorly, and a clot of\r\nblood as big as an almond was contained in the right anterior lobe of\r\nthe brain.—A judicial investigation being ordered, it was ascertained\r\nthat the fowl which the woman buried as well as the remains of the other\r\nfowls which were thrown upon the dunghill, had been carried off. But on\r\nsearching the dunghill more carefully afterwards, the contents of one of\r\nthe crops, which had been taken out and examined by the lodger, were\r\ndiscovered in the rubbish; and in the mass Mr. Jamieson detected a\r\nconsiderable quantity of arsenic.\r\n\r\nThis incident happened in 1836. More lately the same gentleman met with\r\nanother extraordinary attempt of the same kind. A farmer, about to be\r\nmarried, gave directions for killing in the evening some fowls which\r\nwere to be sent to the house of his bride where the ceremony was to take\r\nplace. The killing of them however was accidentally delayed; and next\r\nmorning, on the hen-house door being opened, the fowls ran furiously to\r\nthe well, drank water incessantly, and died in an hour. On examining the\r\nbodies, Mr. Jamieson found arsenic in large quantity in their crops and\r\ngizzards.\r\n\r\nOn each of these occasions a particular individual came under suspicion;\r\nbut the evidence against them was too slight to justify the authorities\r\nin bringing a formal charge; and consequently the proceedings did not go\r\nfarther. In the former instance the evidence in favour of the flesh of\r\npoisoned animals being sometimes poisonous is strong; and the history of\r\nthe woman’s case, although death seems to have been caused directly by\r\napoplexy, renders it probable that even dangerous results might accrue.\r\n\r\nThe preceding remarks will enable the medical witness to know under what\r\ncircumstances accidental observations or intentional experiments on\r\nanimals furnish satisfactory proof.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the subject, however, I have to add, that there is\r\nanother purpose, besides procuring direct evidence, to which experiments\r\nwith animals may be applied with great propriety;—namely, the settling\r\ndisputed questions regarding the physiological and pathological\r\nproperties of a particular poison. The science of toxicology is not yet\r\nby any means so perfect, but in particular cases topics may arise, which\r\nhave not hitherto been investigated, and which it may be necessary to\r\ndetermine by experiment. Experiments on animals instituted for such\r\npurposes by a skilful toxicologist are not liable to any important\r\nobjection. On the trial of Charles Angus at Liverpool in 1808, for\r\nprocuring abortion and murder by poison, a trial of great interest,\r\nwhich will be referred to more particularly afterwards, it appeared from\r\nthe evidence of the crown witnesses, that the poison suspected,\r\ncorrosive sublimate, could not be discovered in the stomach by certain\r\nmethods of analysis; and that, although corrosive sublimate is a\r\npowerful irritant, the villous coat of the stomach was not inflamed. But\r\nthen it was proved by experiments made by one of their number, Dr.\r\nBostock, that animals might be killed with corrosive sublimate without\r\nthe stomach being inflamed, and without the poison being discoverable\r\nafter death by the tests he used in the case.[119] An attempt was made\r\non the side of the prisoner to throw out this line of evidence as\r\nincompetent, on the ground of the discrepant effects of poisons on man\r\nand on the lower animals. But it was admitted by the judge, on the plea\r\nthat it was only to illustrate a general physiological fact, and not to\r\ninfer proof of poisoning. The importance of experiments on animals to\r\nsettle incidental physiological questions has lately been again\r\nacknowledged in a very pointed manner in an English court of law: for a\r\nset of experiments, to settle the question of the rapidity with which\r\nhydrocyanic acid acts, was instituted before the trial by the medical\r\nwitnesses, at the request of the judge who was to try the case.[120]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SECTION V.—_Of the Moral Evidence._\r\n\r\nIt is not my object to treat under this head of the moral evidence\r\ngenerally, which is required to establish a charge of poisoning. But as\r\nit is well known that in criminal trials medical witnesses have for the\r\nmost part nothing to do with the moral proof, while at the same time in\r\ncases of poisoning the medical and moral circumstances are always\r\nintimately interwoven and apt to be confounded together, it is necessary\r\nfor me to specify those particulars of the moral evidence, which either\r\nrequire some medical skill to appreciate them, or fall naturally under\r\nthe cognizance of the physician in his quality of practitioner. I shall\r\nenter into greater details under this section than may perhaps appear to\r\nthe medical reader necessary, chiefly that I may redeem the pledge given\r\nin the introduction to the lawyer and general reader, and endeavour to\r\nshow how powerful an instrument a medico-legal investigation may become\r\nin skilful hands, for throwing light on almost every branch of the\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThe moral or general proof in charges of poisoning is almost always\r\ncircumstantial only. The circumstances of which it usually consists\r\nrelate, 1. To suspicious conduct on the part of the prisoner before the\r\nevent, such as dabbling with poisons when he has nothing to do with them\r\nin the way of his profession, or conversing about them, or otherwise\r\nshowing a knowledge of their properties not usual in his sphere of\r\nlife:—2. To the purchase or possession of poison recently before the\r\ndate of the alleged crime, and the procuring it in a secret manner, or\r\nunder false pretences, such as for poisoning rats when there are none on\r\nhis premises, or for purposes to which it is never applied:—3. To the\r\nadministration of poison either in food, drink, medicine, or\r\notherwise:—4. To the intent of the prisoner, such as the impossibility\r\nof his having administered the poison ignorantly, or by accident, or for\r\nbeneficial purposes, alleged or not alleged:—5. To the fact of other\r\nmembers of the family besides the deceased having been similarly and\r\nsimultaneously affected:—6. To suspicious conduct on the part of the\r\nprisoner during the illness of the person poisoned,—such as directly or\r\nindirectly preventing medical advice being obtained, or the relations of\r\nthe dying man being sent for, or showing an over-anxiety not to leave\r\nhim alone with any other person, or attempting to remove or destroy\r\narticles of food or drink, or vomiting matter which may have contained\r\nthe poison, or expressing a foreknowledge of the probability of speedy\r\ndeath:—7. To suspicious conduct after the person’s death, such as\r\nhastening the funeral, preventing or impeding the inspection of the\r\nbody, giving a false account of the previous illness, showing an\r\nacquaintance with the real or supposed effects of poison on the dead\r\nbody:—8. To the personal circumstances and state of mind of the\r\ndeceased, his death-bed declaration, and other particulars, especially\r\nsuch as tend to prove the impossibility or improbability of suicide:—9.\r\nTo the existence of a motive or inducement on the part of the prisoner,\r\nsuch as his having a personal quarrel with the deceased, or a hatred of\r\nhim,—his succeeding to property by his death, or being relieved of a\r\nburthen by it,—his knowing that the deceased was with child by him.\r\n\r\nUpon many of the particulars now enumerated, important evidence may be\r\nderived from the medical part of the investigation; and not unfrequently\r\nsuch evidence can be collected or appreciated only by means of a\r\nmedico-legal inquiry.\r\n\r\n1 and 2. On the first two articles, suspicious conduct or conversation\r\non the part of the prisoner before the crime, and the possession or\r\npurchase of poison by him, little or nothing need be said. The medical\r\nwitness may of course be asked whether the conduct or conversation\r\nproved betokens an unusual acquaintance with poisons and their effects.\r\nAnd his opinion may be referred to regarding the nature of suspected\r\narticles found in the prisoner’s possession. As to the purchase of\r\narsenic under the false pretence of poisoning rats, it may be observed,\r\nthat a great deal more stress is usually laid on such evidence than it\r\nseems to deserve; for there are few houses, in the country particularly,\r\nwhich are not more or less infected by them. On the other hand, too\r\nlittle weight is attached to the circumstance of the purchaser not\r\nhaving warned his household of poison being laid. Such conduct ought in\r\nmy opinion to be accounted extremely suspicious; for so far as I have\r\nremarked, the fear with which unprofessional persons regard the common\r\npoisons is such, that I can hardly believe any master of a house would\r\nactually lay poison without warning the servants and other inmates of\r\nhis having done so.\r\n\r\n3. The next article, which relates to the proof of the administration of\r\npoison, will require some details.\r\n\r\nDirect proof of the administration of poison by the actual giver is very\r\nrarely attainable, that part of the transaction being for the most part\r\neasily concealed. The proof of this point is justly accounted, however,\r\na very important part of the evidence; nay, on some recent trials in\r\nthis country the prosecution has failed apparently for want of such\r\nevidence, although the case was complete in every other particular. It\r\nis generally constituted by a chain of circumstances, and these are\r\noften strictly medical, as will now be shown by a few examples.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, pointed evidence as to the individual who gave the\r\npoison may be derived from the chemical investigation,—for example, from\r\nthe comparative results of the analysis of the poisoned dish, and of the\r\narticles of which it consisted. I am indebted to my colleague, Dr.\r\nAlison, for the following excellent illustration from the case of\r\nWilliam Muir, who was condemned at Glasgow in 1812 for poisoning his\r\nwife. In the course of the day on which she took ill she was visited by\r\na farmer of the neighbourhood, who had studied physic a little in his\r\nyouth. He learned from her that she had breakfasted on porridge a short\r\ntime before she felt herself ill, and that she suspected the porridge to\r\nhave been poisoned. He immediately procured the wooden bowl or _cap_ in\r\nwhich the cottagers of Scotland keep the portion of meal used each time\r\nfor making the porridge; and finding in it some meal, with shining\r\nparticles interspersed, he wrapped a sample in paper, and took the\r\nproper measures for preserving its identity. He then secured also a\r\nsample from the family store in a barrel. The two particles were\r\nproduced by him on the trial; and from experiments made in court the\r\nlate Dr. Cleghorn was enabled to declare, that the meal from the bowl\r\ncontained arsenic, and that the meal from the barrel did not. These\r\nfacts, besides proving that the woman had next to a certainty taken\r\narsenic in the porridge, likewise, in conjunction with other slight\r\nmoral circumstances, established that the poison had been mixed with the\r\nmeal in the house, and on the morning when the deceased took ill, before\r\nany stranger entered the house. The procedure of this farmer was\r\nprecisely that which ought to be followed by the medical practitioner in\r\na similar conjuncture.\r\n\r\nAn instance of an opposite description related by M. Barruel also\r\ndeserves notice, as showing how evidence of this kind may afford, in\r\notherwise suspicious circumstances, a strong presumption of accidental\r\npoisoning. Sixteen people near Bressières in France having been severely\r\naffected with vomiting and colic immediately after dinner, the bread,\r\nwhich was suspected, was examined by Barruel, and found to contain a\r\nlittle arsenic. The flour of which the bread was made had been taken\r\nfrom a large store of it, which, on being examined, was also found to be\r\nsimilarly impregnated. As it was extremely improbable that any one\r\neither could or would poison so large a mass of flour, to attain any\r\nmalicious object, it was inferred that the arsenic had been mixed with\r\nit accidentally, and that the accident might have arisen from grain\r\nhaving been taken by mistake to the flour-mill to be ground, which had\r\nbeen intended originally for seed, and sprinkled with arsenic to destroy\r\ninsects.[121]\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while observing, in the present place, that in the\r\ninstance of poisoned wine very important evidence may be obtained by\r\nexamining whether the wine with which the cork is impregnated contains\r\nany traces of the poison. This method of investigation occurred to me in\r\na very singular case of poisoning with arsenic in champagne, which\r\nhappened in a baronet’s family in Scotland. In this instance, however,\r\nsuch analysis was proved to be unnecessary; for the gentleman himself\r\nbrought the bottle from his cellar, broke the wires and drew the cork,\r\nimmediately before the wine was drunk.[122]\r\n\r\nAll evidence of the like nature, though it is at present often procured\r\nfrom other sources, should, for obvious reasons, be invariably\r\ncollected, if possible, with the aid of a medical person. If again a\r\nmedical man is called to a patient evidently affected with suspicious\r\nsymptoms, and finds himself obliged to declare such to be his opinion,\r\nhis thoughts, as soon as he has given directions for the treatment,\r\nshould be turned towards that part of the evidence, for the securing of\r\nwhich he is naturally looked to as the person best qualified by previous\r\neducation and his opportunities at the moment. With this view,\r\ntherefore, having ascertained in what articles it is possible for poison\r\nto have been administered, he should at once endeavour to secure the\r\nremains of the particular portion partaken of by his patient, as well of\r\nthe general dish, if it is an article of food, and of the ingredients of\r\nwhich the dish was ostensibly made, not forgetting the salt with which\r\nit was seasoned. A case occurred some years ago in the north of\r\nScotland, in which arsenic was administered in porridge by mixing it\r\nwith the salt.\r\n\r\nIt is of great consequence, before proceeding to analyze such articles,\r\nfor example suspected dishes,—to be particular in investigating every\r\nthing connected with the cooking, serving, and eating of them. By doing\r\nso, not only will the chemical analysis be facilitated, but likewise\r\nfacts in it will be accounted for, which might otherwise prove\r\nembarrassing, and even lead to the drawing of false conclusions from the\r\nresult of the analysis. This statement is very well exemplified by the\r\nfollowing incident which occurred to myself. In 1827 a family in\r\nPortobello were poisoned by the maid-servant; and it was believed, that,\r\nfor the sake of a trick, she had, while carrying to the oven the beef\r\nsubsequently used at dinner, maliciously mixed with it tartar-emetic or\r\nsome other poison. One-half of the beef having been preserved, and two\r\npersons of the family having been very severely affected, Dr. Turner and\r\nI, to whom the case was remitted, made little doubt that we should\r\ndiscover the poison by chemical analysis: but we did not. Being\r\nsubsequently employed by the sheriff to inquire into the particulars, I\r\nfound that the poison had been mixed with the gravy, which had been\r\nconsumed almost to the last drop,—that the gravy had been poured over\r\nthe beef,—that the upper half of the beef had been eaten,—and that the\r\nremainder which we analysed had been transferred upon a different plate\r\nfrom that on which it was served for dinner. These particulars accounted\r\nsufficiently for the poison not having been discovered.\r\n\r\nAnother mode in which the chemical part of the inquiry may contribute to\r\ndiscover the individual who administered the poison is by a comparative\r\nexamination of the persons of the deceased and the accused. The\r\nfollowing very pointed illustration has been published by MM. Ollivier\r\nand Chevallier of Paris.—A woman who lived on bad terms with her husband\r\nwas found dead on a roadside the morning after having been seen drunk in\r\nhis company in the neighbourhood. The mouth, throat, and gullet were\r\nproved by a careful analysis to be corroded with nitric acid, the stains\r\nand traces of which were also found on various parts of her dress, and\r\non the hair, neck, and arms, but not on her hands, and not lower down\r\nthe alimentary canal than the upper fourth of the gullet. Ollivier,\r\nsuspecting from these appearances, that she had not taken the acid\r\nvoluntarily, requested to see the husband; whereupon there were found on\r\nhis coat, trousers, and hands, a great number of stains, which, like\r\nthose on the deceased, were proved by chemical analysis to have been\r\nproduced by nitric acid. Here it was scarcely possible to avoid\r\ninferring, that the man got these stains while endeavouring to force his\r\nintoxicated wife to take the poison Marks of nail scratches were also\r\nobserved round the mouth and on the throat; whence it was reasonably\r\ninferred, that, having failed in his original plan, he had suffocated\r\nher with his hands.[123]\r\n\r\nWhile these illustrations are given of the conclusiveness of the\r\nchemical evidence in fixing the administration of poison on a particular\r\nindividual, it is essential likewise to observe that the same kind of\r\nevidence may be at times equally conclusive of the innocence of a person\r\nunjustly suspected. This obvious and important application of a chemical\r\ninquiry is forcibly suggested by the following particulars of an\r\nincident related by M. Chevallier:—An individual was accused by a woman\r\nof having tried to poison her; and she represented that he had put the\r\npoison into her soup, while it stood from one day to another in an iron\r\npot. On making a careful analysis of some of the soup which remained,\r\nChevallier found it so strongly impregnated with copper, that, supposing\r\nthe sulphate was the salt mixed with the soup, ten ounces must have\r\ncontained twenty-two grains. It then occurred to him, that it was\r\nimportant to examine the iron pot, in which the poisoned soup was\r\nrepresented to have been kept; for the probability was that a large\r\nquantity of the copper, if any salt of that metal had really been\r\ncontained in the soup, would have been thrown down by the superior\r\naffinity of the iron, and consequently that a coppery lining would be\r\nfound on the inside. He was led, however, to anticipate that no copper\r\nwould be found there, because there was no iron dissolved in the soup,\r\nas would have been the case if copper had been precipitated from it by\r\nthe iron of the pot. And accordingly he not only found no copper lining\r\nthe inside of the pot; but likewise, on following the process described\r\nby the accuser as the one pursued in cooking the soup and in\r\nsubsequently poisoning it, he satisfied himself by express trial that\r\nthere was nothing in the circumstances of the case which could have\r\nprevented the iron from exerting its usual action on the salts of\r\ncopper. These conclusions, coupled with certain facts of general\r\nevidence, proved substantially that the suspected person had nothing to\r\ndo with the crime charged against him; and he was therefore\r\ndischarged.[124] A case somewhat similar will be related under the head\r\nof Imputed Poisoning.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, evidence as to the person who administered the\r\npoison may be procured by considering the commencement of the symptoms,\r\nin relation to the time at which particular articles have been given in\r\na suspicious manner by a particular individual. The import of facts of\r\nthis nature can be properly appreciated only by the medical witness; for\r\nhe alone can be acknowledged as conversant with the symptoms which\r\npoisons produce, the intervals within which they begin to operate, and\r\nthe circumstances in which their operation may be put off or\r\naccelerated.\r\n\r\nFew cases will occur in which it is not possible to procure evidence of\r\nthe kind, when diligently sought for. It is often too very decisive in\r\nits operation on judicial proceedings. In the case of Margaret Wishart\r\ntried at the Perth Spring Circuit in 1827 for poisoning her blind\r\nsister, a man who lodged with the prisoner and cohabited both with her\r\nand with the deceased, appeared at first from general circumstances to\r\nbe implicated in the crime. He had left the house, however, on the\r\nmorning of the day before that on the evening of which the deceased took\r\nill; and he did not return till after her death. Now her illness\r\ncommenced suddenly and violently; and arsenic was the poison which\r\ncaused it.[125] It was quite clear, therefore, that the poison could not\r\nhave been administered, at least in a dangerous dose, so early as the\r\nday before she was taken ill; and such I stated to be my opinion, on a\r\nreference from the Lord Advocate. The evidence being also otherwise\r\ninsufficient, the man was set at liberty. In the case of Mrs. Smith\r\ntried here in February of the same year, this branch of the evidence was\r\nmade the subject of question under more doubtful circumstances. The\r\ndeceased certainly died of poisoning with arsenic, and the prisoner was\r\nstrongly suspected of being the poisoner for many reasons, and among\r\nothers because, on the evening before the morning on which the deceased\r\ntook ill, the prisoner gave her in a suspicious manner a white-coloured\r\ndraught. Here the possibility of the draught having been the cause of\r\nthe symptoms must be admitted. But as they did not appear for eight\r\nhours after the draught was taken, I stated in my evidence that it was\r\nimprobable the dose, if it contained arsenic at all, contained a\r\nquantity sufficient to cause the violent symptoms and death which\r\nfollowed.[126]\r\n\r\nThe correspondence in point of time between the appearance of symptoms\r\nof poisoning, and the administration of suspicious articles by an\r\nindividual, constitutes still more decisive proof in a set of cases, in\r\nwhich it is of great value, as the chemical evidence is generally\r\ndefective,—namely, where poisoning is attempted with repeated moderate\r\ndoses. If the several renewals or exacerbations of illness correspond\r\nwith the periods when suspicious articles have been given by the same\r\nindividual, the circumstantial evidence of the administration may be\r\neven tantamount to direct proof. Thus, on the trial of Miss Blandy for\r\nthe murder of her father, it was proved, that Mr. Blandy on several\r\noccasions, after the prisoner received certain suspicious powders from\r\nher lover, was taken ill with vomiting and purging; and that on two\r\noccasions recently before his death, when he got from his daughter a\r\nbowl of gruel which contained a gritty sediment, he was attacked after a\r\nvery short interval with pricking and heat in the throat, mouth,\r\nstomach, and bowels,—with sickness, vomiting, gripes, and bloody\r\ndiarrhœa.[127] Here the proof of administration by the prisoner was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThese examples will show how the evidence of a particular person’s\r\ncriminality may be affected by the relation subsisting in point of time\r\nbetween the commencement of the symptoms and the suspicious\r\nadministration of particular articles. But farther, the special period\r\nat which the symptoms begin may even at times supply strong evidence of\r\nhis instrumentality, although there may be no direct proof from general\r\nevidence of his having been concerned in administering anything whatever\r\nin a suspicious manner. This statement is well exemplified by the case\r\nof Mrs. Humphreys, who was convicted at the Aberdeen Autumn Circuit in\r\n1830 for poisoning her husband, by pouring sulphuric acid down his\r\nthroat while he was asleep. It was clearly proved, as will be seen under\r\nthe head of sulphuric acid, that the deceased died of this poison; and\r\nthe administration was brought home to the prisoner in the following\r\nsingular manner. The only inmates of the house were the deceased, the\r\nprisoner, and a maid-servant. The deceased got a little intoxicated one\r\nevening at a drinking party in his own house; and after his friends all\r\nleft the house, and the street-door was barred inside, he went to bed in\r\nperfect health, and soon fell fast asleep. But he had slept scarcely\r\ntwenty minutes, when he suddenly awoke with violent burning in his\r\nthroat and stomach; and he expired in great agony towards the close of\r\nthe second day. Now sulphuric acid, when it occasions the violent\r\nsymptoms observed in this instance, invariably excites them in a few\r\nseconds, or in the very act of swallowing. It was, therefore, impossible\r\nthat the man could have received the poison at the time he was drinking\r\nwith his friends; and as he knew he had not taken any thing else\r\nafterwards, and it was fully proved that he had been asleep before his\r\nillness suddenly began,—it followed that the acid must have been\r\nadministered after he fell asleep, the accomplishment of which was\r\nrendered easy by a practice he had of sleeping on his back with his\r\nmouth wide open. But, after he gave the alarm, the door was found barred\r\nas when he went to bed. Consequently no one could have administered the\r\npoison except his wife or servant; and it was satisfactorily proved,\r\nthat no suspicion could attach to the latter. Such was one of the\r\nprincipal train of circumstances, which, as it were by a process of\r\nelimination, led to the inference that the wife was undoubtedly the\r\nperson who administered the poison. Other circumstances of a similar\r\ntendency were also derived from the medical evidence; but these it is\r\nunnecessary to detail at present. I have related the particulars of the\r\nwhole case fully elsewhere.[128] The prisoner strenuously denied her\r\nguilt after being sentenced, but confessed before her execution.\r\n\r\n4. The next article in the moral evidence relates to the intent of the\r\nperson who is proved to have administered poison. When the\r\nadministration is proved, little evidence is in general required to\r\nestablish the intent. It is sufficient that the giver knew the substance\r\nadministered was of a deadly nature; and in regard to any of the common\r\npoisons this knowledge is sufficiently constituted by his simply knowing\r\nits name.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, however, the exact nature of the poison is not\r\nestablished with certainty; and then something else may be required to\r\nprove the prisoner’s knowledge, and through that knowledge his intent.\r\nIn the case of Charles Munn, formerly alluded to [p. 50], arsenic was\r\nthe poison presumed to have been taken by the deceased. But the purchase\r\nor possession of it by the prisoner was not for some time satisfactorily\r\nestablished; neither was there any chemical evidence, the deceased\r\nhaving lived forty days and upwards after taking the poison. It was\r\nproved, however, that whatever it was which had been administered, the\r\nprisoner knew very well that what he gave was deleterious; because he\r\npersuaded the deceased, who was pregnant by him, to take it by assigning\r\nto it properties which no drug either possesses, or is so much as\r\nthought by the vulgar to possess. On one occasion he persuaded her that\r\nit would show whether she was with child, and on another that it would\r\nprevent people from knowing she was with child. In such cases, then,\r\ngood evidence may be derived from the arguments used by the giver to\r\npersuade his victim to take the poison; and sometimes, as in the\r\ninstance now mentioned, it will lie with the medical witness to inform\r\nthe court whether or not the reasons assigned are false.\r\n\r\nSometimes it has been pleaded by the prisoner that he gave the poison by\r\nmistake. In all such cases, if he descends to particulars, which he\r\ncannot help doing, there is every likelihood that the falsehood of the\r\ndefence will be made evident by the particulars of the story not\r\nagreeing with other particulars of the moral or medical evidence. At\r\npresent it is only necessary to allude to inconsistencies in his story\r\nwith the medical facts. No general rules can be laid down on the method\r\nof investigating a case with a view to evidence of this kind: I must be\r\nsatisfied with an illustration from an actual occurrence. On the trial\r\nof Mr. Hodgson, a surgeon, at the Durham Autumn Assizes in 1824, for\r\nattempting to poison his wife, it was clearly proved, that pills\r\ncontaining corrosive sublimate, and compounded by the prisoner, were\r\ngiven by him to her in place of pills of calomel and opium, which had\r\nbeen ordered by her physician. But it was pleaded by him, that, being at\r\nthe time intoxicated, he had mistaken, for the shop-bottle which\r\ncontained opium, the corrosive-sublimate bottle which stood next it.\r\nThis was certainly an improbable error, considering the opium was in\r\npowder, and the sublimate in crystals. But it was not the only one which\r\nhe alleged he had committed. Not long after his wife took ill, the\r\nphysician sent the prisoner to the shop to prepare for her a laudanum\r\ndraught, with water for the menstruum. When the prisoner returned with\r\nit, the physician, in consequence of observing it to be muddy, was led\r\nto taste it, before he gave it to the sick lady: and finding it had the\r\ntaste of corrosive sublimate, he preserved it, analyzed it, and\r\ndiscovered that it did contain that poison. The prisoner stated in\r\ndefence, that he had a second time committed a mistake, and instead of\r\nwater had accidentally used for the menstruum a corrosive-sublimate\r\ninjection, which he had previously prepared for a sailor. This was\r\nproved to have been impossible; for the injection contained only five\r\ngrains to the ounce, while the draught, which did not exceed one ounce,\r\ncontained fourteen grains.[129]\r\n\r\nI believe it must be allowed, that, as the medical inquiries preparatory\r\nto trial are commonly conducted without the inspector being made\r\nacquainted with the moral circumstances in detail, it is rarely possible\r\nfor him to foresee what points should be attended to, with the view of\r\nillustrating the intent. But the case now related will show that it is\r\nimpossible for him to render his inquiries too minute or comprehensive;\r\nand more particularly, it shows the propriety of ascertaining, whenever\r\nit is possible, not only the nature but likewise the quantity of the\r\npoison.\r\n\r\n5. The next article among the moral circumstances,—the simultaneous\r\nillness of other members of the family besides the person chiefly\r\naffected,—depends for its conclusiveness almost entirely upon the\r\nresearches and opinion of the medical witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe fact, that several persons, who partook of the same dish or other\r\narticle, have been seized about the same time with the same symptoms,\r\nwill furnish very strong evidence of general poisoning. A few diseases,\r\nsuch as those which arise from infection or from atmospheric miasmata,\r\nmay affect several persons of a family about the same time; and\r\nhysteria, and epilepsy, have been communicated to several people in\r\nrapid succession.[130] But I am not aware, that, among the diseases\r\nwhich resemble well marked cases of poisoning either with irritants or\r\nwith narcotics, any one ever originates in such a way as to render it\r\npossible for several persons in a family to be attacked simultaneously,\r\nexcept through the merest and therefore most improbable accident.\r\nCholera perhaps is an exception. But when cholera attacks at one time\r\nseveral people living together, it arises from bad food, and is properly\r\na variety of poisoning. In such cases, too, the fallacy may in general\r\nbe easily got the better of, by finding that the store or stock, from\r\nwhich the various articles composing the injurious meal have been taken\r\nwas of wholesome quality.\r\n\r\nHence it may be laid down as a general rule, that, perhaps if two, but\r\ncertainly if three or more persons, after taking a suspected article of\r\nfood or drink, are each affected with symptoms, furnishing of themselves\r\npresumptive evidence of poisoning, and have been seized nearly about the\r\nsame time, and within the interval after eating within which poisons\r\nusually begin to act,—the proof of poisoning is decisive. Several late\r\ncases might, in my opinion, have been decided by this rule. Thus it\r\nmight have decided the important case of George Thom tried at Aberdeen\r\nin 1821 for poisoning the Mitchells, and likewise that of Eliza Fenning,\r\nabout whose condemnation some clamour was made in London in 1815. In\r\nboth instances, as will be mentioned under the head of arsenic, the\r\nsymptoms were developed so characteristically, that from them alone\r\npoisoning with arsenic might have been inferred almost to a certainty.\r\nBut even if the symptoms had been somewhat less characteristic, all\r\ndoubt of general poisoning was set aside by the fact, that four persons\r\nin the former case, and five in the latter, were similarly and\r\nsimultaneously affected, and all of them at an interval after eating,\r\nwhich corresponded with the interval within which arsenic usually begins\r\nto act.\r\n\r\nSometimes it happens, that while one or more of a party at a certain\r\nmeal suffer, others escape. Such an occurrence must not be hastily\r\nassumed as inconsistent with poison having been administered at that\r\nmeal. For the guilty person may have slipped the poison into the portion\r\ntaken by the individual or individuals affected.\r\n\r\nIf it be proved that all who ate of a particular dish have suffered, and\r\nall who did not have escaped, the kind of moral evidence now under\r\nreview becomes strongest of all. It is well for the medical jurist to\r\nremember also, that such evidence is very useful in directing him where\r\nchiefly he should look for poison.\r\n\r\nAt other times it happens that the several people affected, suffer in\r\nproportion to the quantity taken by each of a particular dish. Too much\r\nimportance ought not to be attached to the absence of that relation; for\r\nit has been already mentioned that habit, idiosyncrasy, and the state of\r\nfulness of the stomach at the time, will modify materially the action of\r\npoisons. But when present, it will often form strong evidence.—A good\r\nillustration of what is now said may be found in the case of Thomas\r\nLenargan, tried in Ireland for the murder of his master, Mr. O’Flaherty.\r\nHe had for some time carried on an amour with O’Flaherty’s wife; and\r\nafterwards, to get rid of the troublesome surveillance of the husband,\r\ncontrived to despatch him by poison. The crime was not suspected for two\r\nyears. Among the facts brought out on the trial the most pointed were,\r\nthat O’Flaherty’s daughter and two servants were affected at the same\r\ntime with the very same symptoms as himself; that they had partaken of\r\nthe same dish with him; that the severity of their several complaints\r\nwas in proportion to the quantity each had taken; and that others of the\r\nfamily, who did not eat it, were not affected.[131]\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable instance of this kind has been recorded by Morgagni.\r\nA clergyman, while travelling in company with another gentleman and two\r\nladies, was setting out one afternoon to resume his journey after dining\r\nat an inn, when he was suddenly taken ill with violent pain in the\r\nstomach and bowels, and soon after with vomiting and purging. One of the\r\nladies was similarly affected, but in a less degree; and likewise the\r\nother gentleman, though in a degree still less: but the other lady did\r\nnot suffer at all. Morgagni found, that this lady was the only one of\r\nthe party who had not tasted a dish of soup at the commencement of\r\ndinner. But he was puzzled on finding that the gentleman who suffered\r\nleast had taken the largest share of the soup, while the clergyman had\r\ntaken less than either of the two that were seized along with him. He\r\nthen remembered, however, that in the district where the accident\r\nhappened, it was the custom to use scraped cheese with the soup in\r\nquestion; and on inquiry he was informed that they had each added to the\r\nsoup a quantity of cheese proportioned to the severity of their illness.\r\nHere, therefore, Morgagni was led to suspect the presence of poison; and\r\naccordingly, after the whole party had fortunately recovered, the\r\ninnkeeper acknowledged, that in the hurry of preparation, he had served\r\nup to his guests cheese seasoned with arsenic to poison rats.[132] This\r\ninteresting anecdote shows, that the truth in such cases is not always\r\nto be discovered without minute inquiry and considerable adroitness. In\r\nthe case of poisoning with arsenic in wine formerly alluded to,—where\r\nall the individuals at table, to the amount of six, were severely\r\naffected during dinner,—the soup was the article suspected, because all\r\nhad partaken of it; and, accordingly, the soup and vomited matter were\r\nsent to me for analysis. On detecting a trace of arsenic in the vomited\r\nmatter, but none in the soup, I suggested that some other article might\r\nhave been used in common by the party, and mentioned the wine as a\r\nprobable article of the kind. It turned out that all had drunk a single\r\nglass of champagne from a particular bottle; and in the wine remaining\r\nin this bottle arsenic was found in the proportion of half a grain per\r\nounce.[133]\r\n\r\nCases of this nature are so instructive that no apology need be made for\r\nmentioning one example more which lately came under my own notice. In\r\nthe case of Mary Anne Alcorn, convicted here in the summer of 1827, of\r\nhaving administered poison to her master and mistress (a case already\r\nreferred to for another purpose, p. 75), it was proved that a white\r\npowder was introduced in a suspicious manner into the gravy of baked\r\nbeef, which gravy was subsequently poured over the beef. Now the master\r\nof the family dined heartily on beef, potatoes and rice-pudding, and\r\nmixed the greater part of the beef gravy with his pudding; the mistress\r\nate moderately of the first slices of the beef, took very little gravy,\r\neven to the beef, and none at all to the pudding; a little girl, their\r\nniece, dined on pudding alone, without gravy; and the prisoner dined\r\nafter the family on the beef and potatoes. Accordingly the master\r\nsuffered so severely as for two or three days to be in danger of his\r\nlife, the mistress was also severely, but by no means so violently\r\naffected, the little girl did not suffer at all, and the servant had\r\nmerely slight pain and sickness at stomach. The evidence thus procured\r\nwas exceedingly strong, more particularly when coupled with the fact,\r\nthat the beef used was half of a piece, the other half of which had been\r\nused by the family two days before, without any ill consequences.\r\n\r\n6. The next article of the moral evidence relates to suspicious conduct\r\non the part of the prisoner during the illness of the person poisoned.\r\nUnder this head it is necessary merely to state what I conceive to be,\r\nwith reference to the present branch of the proof, the duty of the\r\nmedical practitioner who happens to attend a case of poisoning.\r\n\r\nIn such a conjuncture he is undoubtedly placed in a situation of some\r\ndelicacy. But on considering the matter attentively, good reasons will\r\nappear why he should adopt the course, which, I believe, our courts of\r\njustice will expect of him, and keep some watch over the actions of any\r\nindividual who is suspected of having committed the crime. On the one\r\nhand, no one else is by education and opportunities so capable of\r\nremarking the motions of the different members of the family\r\ndispassionately, without officiousness, and without being observed. And\r\non the other hand, it is undoubtedly a part of his private duty as\r\npractitioner, to protect his patient against any farther criminal\r\nattempts, as well as part of his public duty to prevent the vomited\r\nmatter and other subjects of analysis from being secretly put away or\r\ndestroyed. No one can be so occupied without many accessary particulars\r\ncoming under his notice. And certain it is, that on several trials the\r\npractitioner has contributed, with great credit to himself, a\r\nconsiderable part of the pure moral proof. For an example of discreet\r\nand able conduct under these trying circumstances, the reader will do\r\nwell to refer to that of Dr. Addington, the chief crown witness, both as\r\nto medical and moral facts, in the case of Miss Blandy.[134] It is\r\nalmost unnecessary to add, that in acting as now recommended, the\r\nphysician must conduct himself with circumspection, in order to avoid\r\ngiving unnecessary offence, or alarming the guilty person.\r\n\r\n7, and 9. On the seventh article, which respects the conduct of the\r\nprisoner after the death of the deceased, and on the ninth, which\r\nrelates to the existence of a motive or inducement to the crime, nothing\r\nneed be said here. But on the\r\n\r\n8th article of the moral evidence,—comprehending the death-bed\r\ndeclaration of the deceased, his state of mind, his personal\r\ncircumstances and other points which prove the possibility or\r\nimpossibility of voluntary poisoning—a few remarks are required, because\r\nan important and little understood part of the practitioner’s duty is\r\nconnected with this branch of the proof.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the possibility of the poisoning being voluntary is\r\none upon which the medical attendant will be expected to throw some\r\nlight, and into which he will also naturally inquire for his own\r\nsatisfaction. In doing so his attention will be turned to circumstances\r\npurely moral, which may not only decide that question, but may also\r\ncriminate a particular individual. His inquiries must therefore be\r\nconducted with discretion, and for obvious reasons should be confined as\r\nmuch as possible to the patient himself. They are to be conducted not so\r\nmuch by putting questions, as by leading him to disburden his mind of\r\nhis own accord; and it is well to be aware, that there is no one of whom\r\na patient is so ready to make a confident on such an occasion as his\r\nmedical attendant.\r\n\r\nIf disclosures of consequence are made, and the attendant should feel it\r\nhis duty to look forward to the future judicial proceedings and to the\r\nprobability of his appearing as a witness, he ought to remember the\r\ngeneral rule is, that his account of what the patient told him is not\r\nevidence in the eye of the law, unless it was told under the\r\nconsciousness of the approach of death. Of late, however, the rigour of\r\nthis principle in law has been occasionally departed from in Scottish\r\npractice; and in regard to medical facts ascertained in the way here\r\nmentioned, many strong reasons might be assigned for such relaxation.\r\nEvidence of the kind is technically called the death-bed declaration of\r\nthe deceased, and is justly accounted very important.\r\n\r\nHere it is right to take notice of a part of the death-bed evidence,\r\nalthough it does not properly belong to the question of suicide, because\r\nit should always be collected if possible by the medical attendant, and\r\nwith much greater care than is generally bestowed on it even by him—I\r\nmean the history of the symptoms previously to his being called in. On\r\nthis part of the history, including particularly the time and manner in\r\nwhich the illness began, medical conclusions of extreme consequence are\r\noften subsequently founded: On a single fact or two may depend the fate\r\nof the prisoner. It is not enough, therefore, in my opinion, that such\r\nevidence formed a part of the death-bed declaration. If a fact derived\r\nat second hand from the deceased, and stated too by him from memory, is\r\na material element of any of the medical opinions on the trial, it is of\r\nmuch importance that the information be procured by a medical man; and\r\nthat the person who procured it, whether professional or not, was aware\r\nat the time of the probability of its becoming important. Such evidence,\r\nalthough not collected with these precautions, is admissible; but I have\r\nso often had occasion to witness the carelessness with which the\r\nprevious history of cases is inquired into both in medical and\r\nmedico-legal practice, that I do not see how it is possible to put trust\r\nin evidence of the kind, unless it bear marks of having been collected\r\nwith care, and under an impression of its probable consequence. These\r\nstatements are well illustrated by the following example:—On the trial\r\nof Mrs. Smith for poisoning her maid-servant with arsenic, it was proved\r\nthat some drug was administered by the prisoner in a suspicious manner\r\non a Tuesday evening. Now it appeared at the trial improbable that this\r\ndrug contained a fatal dose of arsenic, because to her fellow-servants,\r\nof whom one slept with her, and others frequently visited her, the\r\ndeceased did not appear to be ill at all for eight hours after, or\r\nseriously ill for nearly a day. On the contrary, however, a surgeon, who\r\nwas called to see her on the following Saturday, a few hours before her\r\ndeath, deposed that, according to information communicated by herself,\r\nshe had been ill with sickness, vomiting, purging, and pain in the\r\nstomach and bowels since the Tuesday evening. This evidence, if it could\r\nhave been relied on, would have altered materially the features of the\r\ncase, as it would have gone far to supply what all the medical witnesses\r\nconsidered defective, namely, proof of the administration. But at the\r\ntime the surgeon made his inquiries, he did not even suspect that the\r\ngirl laboured under the effects of poison. Neither he therefore nor his\r\npatient could have been impressed with that conviction of the importance\r\nof the information communicated, which was necessary to insure its\r\naccuracy, particularly as it related to a matter usually of so little\r\nconsequence in ordinary medical practice as the precise date of the\r\ncommencement of an illness; and it would consequently have been rash to\r\nadopt it in face of more direct and contrary evidence. Any one who\r\nexamines the details of this trial as I have reported them, will at once\r\nsee how much the case turned on the point now alluded to.[135]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n             OF IMAGINARY PRETENDED, AND IMPUTED POISONING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present seems the most convenient place for noticing the general\r\nmode of procedure by which the medical jurist may detect cases of\r\nimaginary, feigned, and imputed poisoning. It is by no means easy to lay\r\ndown rules for the investigation of cases suspected to be of such a\r\nkind. But an attempt will be made to state the leading points to be\r\nattended to, and to illustrate them by the circumstances of a few\r\nexamples of each variety.\r\n\r\n_Imaginary poisoning_ should rarely be the occasion of deception or\r\nembarrassment. The same wandering of the imagination which has led to a\r\nbelief of injury from poison, will commonly also lead to such\r\nextravagant notions relative to the mode of administration and the\r\nsymptoms, as will infallibly point out the true nature of the case to\r\none who is well acquainted with the real effects of poisons. It is easy,\r\nnevertheless, to conceive cases which may be embarrassing; and\r\ncertainly, in every instance, the physician should proceed in his\r\ninquiries with caution.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that in the first place, without seeming to take up at\r\nonce the conviction of his patient, he should scrupulously abstain from\r\ntreating it lightly, and should on the whole act rather as if he\r\nsuspected poison had been given. Allowing his patient therefore\r\napparently credit for the truth of his suspicions, the medical attendant\r\nshould request him to give a full history of existing symptoms, of their\r\norigin and progress, of their relation in point of time to various\r\nmeals, and of the mode and vehicle in which the supposed poison was\r\nadministered. No unprofessional person can possibly go through such a\r\nnarrative, without stating many circumstances which are wholly\r\nirreconcilable with the idea of poisoning generally, and still more of\r\nthe administration of a particular poison.\r\n\r\nI have met with two instances of imaginary poisoning, the nature of\r\nwhich was thus at once made obvious by a host of impossibilities in the\r\nnarrative of the patient. One of these may be here given as an example.\r\nAn elderly lady, who had certain expectancies of the death of a\r\nrelation, conceived that the family of her relative had resolved to\r\ndefraud her of her supposed rights. She afterwards imagined that an\r\nattempt was made to poison her, and camphor was the poison she fixed on\r\nas the article which had been administered. In its general or moral\r\nparticulars the narrative was all plausible and suspicious enough; but\r\nunluckily for its consistency, she stated that the poison could only\r\nhave been given in wine,—that she did not remark any particular taste in\r\nthe wine,—that her illness did not begin till the day after she took it;\r\nand although she alleged, without any leading question on my part, that\r\ncamphorous perspiration was exhaled on the subsequent day, the whole\r\ntrain of symptoms differed entirely in every other respect from a case\r\nof poisoning, and resembled closely in their origin and progress a case\r\nof slight general fever. The incompatibility of her story with the idea\r\nof poisoning with camphor will be readily understood by referring to\r\nwhat is afterwards said of the effects of that substance.\r\n\r\n_Feigned_ or _pretended poisoning_ is more apt to escape suspicion, and\r\nwhen suspected is commonly more difficult to develope satisfactorily;\r\nfor the actor has it in his power to lay his plans with care, and even\r\nto become acquainted with the properties of the poisons whose effects he\r\nintends to feign. Still he can rarely enact his part so well as to\r\ndeceive a skilful physician both by existing symptoms and by his history\r\nof their origin and progress; much less can he contrive his scheme so\r\nadroitly that it shall not be unfolded by the refinements of chemical\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of such a case will be directed of course in the first\r\ninstance to the state and progress of the symptoms. Here, as in\r\nimaginary poisoning, it is of moment to conceal from the individual the\r\nsuspicion entertained of his falsehood. For even if a person who has\r\nactually taken poison knows he is unjustly suspected of feigning, it is\r\nnot improbable that he might try to mend his story with impossibilities,\r\nand so lead the physician into error. In a case of feigned poisoning an\r\nexcellent mode of investigation is, after hearing out the individual’s\r\nown story, to put a number of questions involving an alternative answer,\r\none alternative being compatible and the other incompatible with the\r\nalleged nature of his illness. No unprofessional person can stand such a\r\nsystem of interrogation, if skilfully pursued. Not only will his answers\r\nbe often wrong; but likewise his manifest perplexity how to answer will\r\nof itself supply evidence of falsehood.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, great attention must be paid to the chemical\r\nanalysis. A person who feigns poisoning will commonly produce the\r\npoisoned remains of a dish, or some other article, which he represents\r\nhimself to have swallowed. Sometimes the substance contained in it will\r\nprove on analysis not to be poison at all, as in an instance I remember\r\nreading some years ago in a London newspaper of pretended poisoning with\r\narsenic, where the dregs of a bowl of gruel contained, not arsenic, but\r\nfinely pounded glass. Sometimes the quantity of a real poison contained\r\nin the remains of a dish may indicate, in what is said to have been\r\nswallowed, a portion wholly incompatible with the mildness or severity\r\nof the symptoms. Sometimes the vomited matter, even the matter first\r\nvomited, may not contain any of the alleged poison. Sometimes poison\r\nfound in matter alleged to have been vomited may yield compounds during\r\nanalysis which are not animalized, showing that it never was in the\r\nstomach. Sometimes the quantity of poison contained in such matter may\r\nbe greater than that alleged to have been taken. Sometimes the quantity\r\ncontained in the first matter vomited may be less than that contained in\r\nwhat is vomited or said to be vomited subsequently. By these and many\r\nother such inconsistencies the falsehood of the story may be\r\nunequivocally unfolded.\r\n\r\nThe following example will illustrate some of the rules now laid down. A\r\nyoung married female, in the seventh month of pregnancy, having been\r\ndiscovered by her friends to be secretly addicted to dram-drinking,\r\nappeared to be much annoyed in consequence of the discovery; and one\r\nevening was found apparently very ill by her husband on his return from\r\nwork. She represented that she had taken arsenic with a view to\r\nself-destruction, that she was in great torture, and that she was sure\r\nshe must soon die. It was accordingly found, on reference to a\r\nneighbouring apothecary, that she had the same forenoon purchased about\r\na drachm and a half of arsenic for the pretended purpose of poisoning\r\nrats; and in the bottom of a teacup, in which she said she mixed it,\r\nthere was left a small quantity of white powder, that proved on analysis\r\nto be pure oxide of arsenic. Notwithstanding these strong facts, the\r\nmildness of the symptoms and the composure with which she complained of\r\nher tortures led her friends to suspect she was feigning. On\r\ninvestigating her case I first ascertained, in farther corroboration of\r\nher story, that the powder was nowhere to be found. But she then stated\r\nin reply to questions involving an alternative answer, that the arsenic\r\nhad a sour taste, and that the pain began in the lower part of the\r\nbelly, and spread upwards. She likewise said that she vomited a mouthful\r\nor two into a chamber-pot twenty minutes after taking the poison; that\r\nshe vomited no more till the apothecary was sent for, who gave her\r\nemetics of sulphate of zinc, carefully preserving the discharges; and\r\nthat she only vomited when emetics were given. When I first saw her,\r\nfive hours after the alleged date of the taking of the arsenic, the skin\r\nwas warm and moist, the face full and flushed, the pulse frequent and\r\nfirm, the muscular strength natural. The chamber-pot contained only a\r\nsmall quantity of the fæces of a child and apparently a little water,\r\nbut no vomited matters, and no white powder. The fluid discharged in\r\npresence of the apothecary was found on careful analysis to contain a\r\nlarge quantity of zinc, but not an atom of arsenic. She gradually\r\nrecovered from the illness under which she laboured at the time I saw\r\nher, and in two days she admitted she was quite well, but continued to\r\ninsist that she had taken the poison.—M. Tartra has related a singular\r\ncase of the same kind, where a young woman feigned poisoning with nitric\r\nacid, and was not detected for several days.[136]\r\n\r\n_Imputed poisoning_ differs in general from feigned poisoning only in so\r\nfar as the symptoms which are feigned are imputed to the agency of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe imputation of the crime of poisoning by feigning or actually\r\nproducing the symptoms, and contriving that poison shall be detected in\r\nthe quarters where in actual cases it is usually sought for, has been\r\nnot unfrequently attempted. Two important continental cases have already\r\nbeen referred to for other purposes [pp. 66, 76]; and I may here relate\r\nthe heads of two English cases, which are of great interest, and will\r\nserve to illustrate the mode of procedure in such circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe first of these, which I have related elsewhere in detail,[137] is a\r\nstriking example of the power of science in eliciting the truth, and\r\nredounds highly to the credit of Mr. Thackrah, the medical gentleman who\r\nconducted the investigation.\r\n\r\nSamuel Whalley was indicted at York Spring Assizes in 1821, for\r\nmaliciously administering arsenic to Martha King, who was pregnant by\r\nhim. The woman King swore, that the prisoner, after twice trying, but in\r\nvain, to prevail on her to take drugs for the purpose of procuring\r\nabortion, sent her a present of tarts, of which she ate one and a\r\nhalf,—that in half an hour she was seized with symptoms of poisoning\r\nwith some irritant poison,—and that she continued ill for a long time\r\nafter. Mr. Thackrah found arsenic in the tarts that remained untouched,\r\nand likewise in some matter that was vomited in his presence after the\r\nadministration of an emetic, as well as in other vomited matters which\r\nwere preserved for him between his first and second visits. Her\r\nappearance, however, did not correspond with the complaint she made of\r\nher sufferings, her pulse and tongue were natural, and on careful\r\ninvestigation the following inconsistencies were farther detected. 1.\r\nShe said she felt a coppery taste in the act of eating the tarts, a\r\ntaste which arsenic certainly does not possess. 2. From the quantity of\r\narsenic in the tarts which remained she could not have taken above ten\r\ngrains, while even after repeated attacks of vomiting, the alleged\r\nmatter subsequently preserved contained nearly fifteen grains. 3. The\r\nmatter first vomited contained only one grain, while the matter alleged\r\nto have been vomited subsequently contained fifteen grains. 4. The time\r\nat which these fifteen grains were alleged to have been vomited was not\r\ntill between two and three hours after the symptoms began; in which case\r\nthe symptoms would before that time have been in all probability\r\nviolent. The prisoner was acquitted, and the prosecutor and another\r\nwoman who corroborated her deposition afterwards confessed that they had\r\nentered into a conspiracy to impute the crime to him, because he had\r\ndeserted her on finding she was too intimate with other men.\r\n\r\nAnother case not less interesting in its details was communicated to me\r\nby my colleague Dr. Traill, who was consulted by the medical attendant,\r\nMr. Parr of Liverpool. A man accused his sister-in-law of administering\r\npoison in his tea. He stated that he was seized with pain in the stomach\r\nand uneasiness in the head half an hour after taking the tea; and when\r\nvisited soon after, the countenance was anxious, the skin pallid, the\r\npulse frequent, the throat red; and while Mr. Parr was examining the\r\nthroat, a quantity of matter was vomited, containing a white, gritty,\r\ncrystalline substance, which was afterwards ascertained to be oxalic\r\nacid. The following circumstances, however, proved that the poison could\r\nnot have been given in the tea. The man alleged that he remarked in the\r\nvery first mouthful an acrid taste, followed by sweetness, which is not\r\nthe taste of oxalic acid. Notwithstanding this warning, he drank the\r\ngreater part of the tea. He stated that the poison was dissolved in the\r\ntea, yet he vomited some oxalic acid in the solid form. Granting he was\r\nmistaken in supposing the whole poison dissolved, the quantity swallowed\r\nmust in that case have been large; and nevertheless the symptoms were\r\nmild, though no vomiting took place for about an hour, and next day he\r\nwas almost well. Four other individuals had tea at the same time from\r\nthe same tea-pot, without sustaining any harm; and what remained of the\r\ninfusion did not contain any oxalic acid. Finally, his niece took what\r\nhe left of his tea in the cup, without remarking any unusual taste; and\r\nin the unwashed cup not a trace of oxalic acid could be detected. It was\r\nquite plain, therefore, that the man’s accusation was false; and certain\r\npoints of general evidence, coupled with the medical facts, afterwards\r\nproved that he must have taken the oxalic acid himself.\r\n\r\nIt has been alleged, that attempts have been made to impute the crime of\r\npoisoning by introducing poisonous substances into the body after death;\r\nand although I have not been able to find any actual instance of such\r\ningenious atrocity mentioned by authors, it must be acknowledged to be\r\nquite possible; and the medical jurist should therefore be prepared for\r\nthe requisite investigations. Every case may be clearly made out by\r\nattending to the relative effects of poisons on the dead and on the\r\nliving tissues;—a subject which will receive some notice under the head\r\nof the principal poisons in common use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PART SECOND.\r\n                         OF INDIVIDUAL POISONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n                   OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF POISONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the preliminary observations on General Poisoning, I proceed next\r\nto treat of Poisons Individually. The subsequent remarks will be\r\nconfined in a great measure to the most common poisons, which will be\r\nexamined minutely. The rest being mere objects of curiosity, and hardly\r\never taken by man either intentionally or by accident, it will be\r\nsufficient to point out their leading properties.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to point out in the first instance the poisons in most\r\ngeneral use. These will appear from the following Tables. The first is\r\ncompiled from a Parliamentary Return of the cases of fatal poisoning\r\nbrought before the coroners of England in two years ending with 1838.\r\n\r\n        1. _Arsenical_               White arsenic       185\r\n                                     Yellow arsenic        1\r\n                                                          —— 186\r\n        2. _Acids_                   Sulphuric acid       32\r\n                                     Nitric acid           3\r\n                                     Oxalic acid          19\r\n                                                          ——  54\r\n        3. _Mercurials_              Corrosive sublimate  12\r\n                                     White mercury         1\r\n                                     Turbith-mineral       1\r\n                                     Mercury (?)           1\r\n                                                          ——  15\r\n        4. _Other mineral irritants_ Tartar-emetic         2\r\n                                     Sulphate of iron      1\r\n                                     Chloride of tin       1\r\n                                     Subacetate of lead    1\r\n                                     Bichrom. of potash    1\r\n                                     Percussion powder     1\r\n                                     Carbonate of potash   1\r\n                                     Black-ash             1\r\n                                                          ——   9\r\n        5. _Veget. irritants_        Colchicum             3\r\n                                     Hellebore             1\r\n                                     Savin                 1\r\n                                     Cayenne               1\r\n                                     Castor seeds          1\r\n                                     Morison pills         1\r\n                                                          ——   8\r\n        6. _Anim. irrits._           Cantharides           2\r\n        7. _Opium_                   Opium or Laudan.    180\r\n                                     Opium & nitric acid   1\r\n                                     Poppy-syrup           4\r\n                                     Godfrey’s Cordial     6\r\n                                     Morphia               1\r\n                                     Acetate of morphia    1\r\n                                                          —— 193\r\n        8. _Hydrocyanic acid_        Med.

Only 5 cases, namely, 3 by arsenic and 2 by\r\nsulphuric acid, were cases of murder, or attempt to murder.[140]\r\n\r\nThe classification of poisons has hitherto defied the ingenuity of\r\ntoxicologists. Formerly it was thought sufficient to arrange them in\r\nthree great classes, according as they are derived from the mineral, the\r\nvegetable, or the animal kingdom. It is evident, however, that the only\r\nsound basis of arrangement is their action on the animal economy; for\r\nsuch a classification is the only one which can be useful in practice.\r\nNow, when we consider what has been said on their mode of action, or the\r\nsymptoms produced in consequence of that action, it must at once be\r\nperceived, that no system founded on either of these circumstances can\r\nbe logically correct. It would be very desirable, if their mode of\r\naction could be adopted as the basis of arrangement; but both reasoning\r\nand experience have proved this to be impracticable. One very distinct\r\nclass indeed might be formed of purely local poisons, comprehending the\r\nmineral acids, the fixed alkalies, and one or two of their chemical\r\ncompounds. But a vast proportion of the other poisons which act locally\r\nhave also a general or remote action; and on the other hand there are\r\nfew of the latter description which do not likewise act locally. Hence\r\nif all which possess this double action were arranged in one class, that\r\nclass would include nine-tenths at least of known poisons; so that, in\r\ntruth, the labour of classification would still remain to be overcome.\r\n\r\nIt would be even more fruitless to attempt an arrangement of poisons\r\naccording to their medium of action; for no sure criterion is known, by\r\nwhich a poison acting through direct transmission of an impulse along\r\nthe nerves can be distinguished from one that acts by entering the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nNeither is the embarrassment of the toxicologist materially less, if he\r\nattempts to classify poisons according to the symptoms they induce in\r\nman. This is the principle now generally followed, and which in common\r\nwith others I shall pursue. But the reader will be at no loss to\r\ndiscover that the partitions which separate the classes are exceedingly\r\nslight, and that very many poisons might be arranged without impropriety\r\nin either of two classes.\r\n\r\nThe preceding statements show the impossibility of founding a good\r\nsystem of arrangement on the only basis which can be acknowledged\r\nphilosophical and practical; and consequently, that, as the science of\r\ntoxicology now stands, we must altogether despair of forming one that\r\nshall be even moderately satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I see no reason for deviating from the classification\r\nadopted in the first edition of the present work, being a modification\r\nof that previously followed by Professor Orfila. In this classification\r\npoisons are divided into irritants, narcotics, and narcotic-acrids.\r\n\r\nThe class of irritants includes all poisons whose sole or predominating\r\nsymptoms are those of irritation or inflammation; the narcotics those\r\nwhich produce stupor, delirium, spasms, paralysis, and other affections\r\nof the brain and nervous system; and the narcotico-acrids those which\r\ncause sometimes irritation, sometimes narcotism, sometimes both\r\ntogether. Some writers still adopt a fourth class, called septics,\r\nbecause they give rise to putrefaction in the living body. But modern\r\nphysiology will scarcely sanction the continuance of such a class of\r\npoisons. For assuredly no substance can cause putrefaction in the living\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                              CLASS FIRST.\r\n                     ON IRRITANT POISONS GENERALLY.\r\n\r\nThe class of irritant poisons comprehends all whose sole or predominant\r\naction consists in exciting irritation or inflammation. That is, it\r\ncomprises both those which have a purely local, irritating action, and\r\nlikewise many which also act remotely, but whose most prominent feature\r\nof action still is the inflammation they excite wherever they are\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nThis subject will be introduced with an account of the general symptoms\r\nand morbid appearances caused by the irritants, and a comparison of\r\nthese with the symptoms and morbid appearances of the natural diseases\r\nwhich are chiefly liable to be confounded with irritant poisoning, or\r\nmistaken for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.—_Of the Symptoms of the Irritant Poisons, compared with those\r\n                         of natural diseases._\r\n\r\nThe symptoms caused by the irritating poisons, taken internally, are\r\nchiefly those of violent irritation and inflammation of one or more\r\ndivisions of the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\nThe mouth is frequently affected, especially when the poison is easily\r\nsoluble, and possesses a corrosive as well as irritating power. The\r\nsymptoms referrible to the mouth are pricking or burning of the tongue,\r\nand redness, swelling and ulceration of the tongue, palate, and inside\r\nof the cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe throat and gullet are still more frequently affected; and the\r\naffection is commonly burning pain, sometimes accompanied with\r\nconstriction and difficulty in swallowing, and always with redness of\r\nthe visible part of the throat and gullet.\r\n\r\nThe affection of the throat and mouth precedes every other symptom when\r\nthe poison is an active corrosive, and more particularly when it is\r\neither a fluid poison or is easily dissolved. Nay, sometimes burning\r\npain of the mouth, throat, and gullet occurs during the very act of\r\nswallowing.—On the contrary if the poison is soluble with difficulty,\r\nand is only an irritant, not a corrosive, and still more if it is only\r\none of the feebler irritants, the throat is frequently not affected\r\nsooner than the stomach, occasionally not at all.\r\n\r\nThe stomach is the organ which suffers most invariably from the\r\noperation of irritant poisons. The symptoms referrible to their\r\noperation on it are acute and general burning pain, sometimes\r\nlancinating or pricking pain,—sickness, vomiting, tenderness on\r\npressure, tension in the upper part of the belly, and occasionally\r\nswelling. Of these symptoms the sickness is generally the first to\r\ndevelope itself. In the instance of corrosive irritants pain commonly\r\ncommences along with it. The matter vomited is at first the contents of\r\nthe stomach, afterwards tough mucus, streaked often with blood and\r\nmingled with bile, frequently clots of purer blood. The powerful\r\ncorrosives affect the stomach the moment they are swallowed; irritants\r\nwhich are either liquid or very soluble also affect it very soon; but\r\nthe more insoluble irritants, such as arsenic, generally do not begin to\r\nact till half an hour or even more than a whole hour has elapsed.—The\r\nstomach may be affected without any other part of the alimentary canal\r\nparticipating in the injury; but much more frequently other parts suffer\r\nalso, and in particular the intestines.\r\n\r\nThe action of irritant poisons on the intestines is marked by pain\r\nextending over the whole belly, sometimes even to the anus. This pain,\r\nlike that of the stomach, is often a sense of burning; but it is also\r\nfrequently a pricking or tearing pain, and still more frequently a\r\ntwisting, intermitting pain like that of colic. It is seldom attended\r\nwith much swelling, but often with tension, and tenderness of the whole\r\nbelly; and at times the inflammatory state of the mucous coat of the\r\nintestines is clearly indicated by excoriation of the anus and prolapsus\r\nof the rectum, which is of a bright red colour. The pain of the bowels\r\nis most generally attended by purging, rarely with constipation,\r\nfrequently with tenesmus. The matter discharged, after the alimentary\r\nand feculent contents have passed, is chiefly a mucous fluid, often\r\nabundant, often also streaked with blood or mixed with considerable\r\nquantities of blood. In some cases the intestines are affected when no\r\nother part of the alimentary canal suffers, not even the stomach. But\r\nmuch more generally the stomach and intestines are affected together.\r\n\r\nIn a few very aggravated cases of poisoning with the irritants the whole\r\ncourse of the alimentary canal, from the throat to the anus, is affected\r\nat one and the same time.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms now briefly enumerated are accompanied in almost every\r\ninstance with great disturbance of the circulation—quick, feeble\r\npulse—excessive prostration of strength,—coldness, and clammy moisture\r\nof the skin.\r\n\r\nThe other symptoms, which are often united with the preceding, do not\r\nbelong to the irritants as a class. Perhaps, however, among the symptoms\r\nof the class may be mentioned those of irritation and inflammation of\r\nthe windpipe and lungs, and those of irritation in the urinary organs. A\r\ngreat number of the irritant poisons cause hoarseness, wheezing\r\nrespiration, and other signs which indicate the spreading of the\r\ninflammation of the throat to the windpipe: some likewise cause darting\r\npains throughout the chest: and not a few are very apt to cause\r\nstrangury and other signs of inflammation of the urinary passages.\r\n\r\nOf the effects of the irritants when applied externally little need be\r\nsaid at present. Their most striking external symptoms will be noticed\r\nunder the head of one of the orders of this class, the vegetable acrids.\r\nIn the chapter on the local action of poisons some account was given of\r\nthe several effects which are produced by the application of poisons to\r\nthe skin. It is there stated that some produce merely redness, that\r\nothers cause blistering, that others bring out a crop of deep-seated\r\npustules, that others corrode the tissues chemically, and so give origin\r\nto a deep slough, and that others excite spreading inflammation of the\r\ncellular tissue under the skin and between the muscles.\r\n\r\nSuch is a general view of the symptoms caused by the irritant poisons.\r\nThis topic will be afterwards taken up in detail under the head of the\r\nseveral species. At present an important subject remains for\r\nconsideration, namely, the natural diseases whose effects are apt to be\r\nmistaken for the effects of poison. The remarks now to be made might be\r\nextended to many diseases. In fact, they might be extended to all which\r\nprove fatal suddenly, for all such diseases are apt in peculiar\r\ncircumstances to give rise to a suspicion of poisoning. But those only\r\nwill be here noticed which occasion the greatest embarrassment to the\r\nmedical jurist, and which are most likely to come under his review in\r\ncourts of law. They are the following:—Distension and rupture of the\r\nstomach; rupture of the duodenum, biliary ducts, uterus, or other organs\r\nin the belly; the effects of drinking cold water; bilious vomiting and\r\ncommon cholera; malignant cholera; inflammation of the stomach;\r\ninflammation and perforation of the intestines; inflammation of the\r\nperitonæum; spontaneous perforation of the stomach; melæna and\r\nhæmatemesis: colic, iliac passion and obstructed intestine.\r\n\r\n1. _Distension of the Stomach._—Mere distension of the stomach from\r\nexcessive gluttony may cause sudden death. Generally indeed the symptoms\r\nand appearances in the dead body show that death is the consequence of\r\napoplexy; but sometimes not. In order to preserve the continuity of the\r\nsucceeding remarks on the diseases of the stomach which imitate\r\npoisoning, it may be useful to consider in the present place all the\r\nvarieties of the effects of distension.\r\n\r\nExcessive distension of the stomach, then, sometimes causes sudden death\r\nby inducing apoplexy, which is commonly of the congestive kind,—that is,\r\nwithout rupture of vessels. Mérat has related an instructive case of\r\nthis kind. A man in good health, while greedily devouring an excellent\r\ndinner, became suddenly blue and bloated in the face; a clammy sweat\r\nbroke out over his body; and he died almost immediately. On dissection\r\nthe stomach was found enormously distended with food, and the vessels of\r\nthe brain were so gorged, that the brain appeared too large to be\r\ncontained within the skull.[141]\r\n\r\nThere is reason, however, to suppose that death from distension is the\r\nconsequence not always of apoplexy,—but sometimes of an impression on\r\nthe stomach itself. Sir Everard Home relates the case of a child, who,\r\nbeing left by its nurse beside an apple-pie, was found dead a few\r\nminutes afterwards, and in whose body no appearance of note could be\r\ndiscovered, except enormous distension of the stomach with the pie.—A\r\nstill more distinct case in point forms the subject of a medico-legal\r\nreport by Wildberg. A corpulent gentleman died suddenly fifteen minutes\r\nafter dinner; and as he lived on bad terms with his wife, a suspicion\r\narose that he had been poisoned. His wife said that he fell asleep\r\nimmediately after dinner; but had not slept many seconds, when he\r\nsuddenly awoke in great anguish, called out for fresh air, exclaimed he\r\nwas dying, and actually expired before his physician, who was instantly\r\nsent for, could arrive. Wildberg found the stomach so enormously\r\ndistended with ham, pickles, and cabbage-soup, that, when the belly was\r\nlaid open, nothing could be seen at first but the stomach and colon.\r\nSome white powder, found on the villous coat of the stomach, was at\r\nfirst suspected to be arsenic; but it proved on analysis to be merely\r\nmagnesia, which the gentleman had been in the habit of taking\r\nfrequently. The diaphragm was pushed high into the chest by the\r\ndistended stomach. There was not any particular congestion in the brain.\r\nWildberg very properly ascribed death to simple over-distension of the\r\nstomach.[142]—In all such cases the symptoms may be suspicious; but when\r\ncarefully considered they can scarce be said to resemble closely the\r\neffects of irritant poisoning; and at all events the appearances in the\r\ndead body will at once distinguish them.\r\n\r\n2. _Rupture of the Stomach_ is not a common occurrence; but it sometimes\r\nimitates in its symptoms the effects of the irritant poisons.\r\n\r\nIt is generally the consequence of over-distension, combined with\r\nefforts to vomit. The cause of it seems to be, that the abrupt turn\r\nwhich the gullet makes in entering an excessively distended stomach acts\r\nas a valve, so that the contents cannot be discharged by vomiting. A\r\ncase of this kind is related by M. Lallemand in his Inaugural\r\nDissertation at Paris in 1818.[143] A woman convalescent from a tedious\r\nattack of dyspepsia, being desirous to make amends for her long\r\nprivations as to diet, ate one day to satiety. Ere long she was seized\r\nwith a sense of weight in the stomach, nausea, and fruitless efforts to\r\nvomit. Then she all at once uttered a piercing shriek, and exclaimed\r\nthat she felt her stomach tearing open; afterwards she ceased to make\r\nefforts to vomit, soon became insensible, and in the course of the night\r\nshe expired. In the fore part of the stomach there was a laceration five\r\ninches long; and a great deal of half-digested food had escaped into the\r\ncavity of the abdomen. The coats of the body of the stomach were\r\nhealthy; but the pylorus or opening into the intestines was indurated;\r\nwhich had been the cause of her dyspepsia.\r\n\r\nIn other cases of death from rupture the laceration is caused not by the\r\naccumulation of food, but by the accumulation of gases arising from\r\ndepraved digestion, constituting a disease almost the same as that which\r\nattacks cattle that have fed on wet clover. A singular example of this\r\nrare affection, in which death was preceded by the symptoms of irritant\r\npoisoning, has been noticed by Professor Barzelotii.[144]—Another case,\r\nwhich appears to have been of the same kind, is mentioned in a late\r\nFrench journal. A child, a twelvemonth old, after eating cabbage-soup,\r\ndied during the night unperceived by its mother. On the body being\r\nexamined, a great quantity of fetid gas escaped from the abdomen, and a\r\nsmooth laceration like an incised wound, three inches in length, was\r\nfound in the lesser arch of the stomach.[145]\r\n\r\nIn other cases, however, it is not easy to say what occasions the\r\ninjury. An instance, for example, has been related, where the accident\r\nfollowed the drinking of a little shrub and water. The individual, a man\r\nof middle age, who had been long liable to fits of severe pain in the\r\nstomach, going off with vomiting, was suddenly seized the day after one\r\nof his fits with violent pain in the epigastrium, extreme tenderness and\r\ntension of the muscles, and for a short time with violent vomiting. In\r\nseventeen hours he expired. On dissection a dark-brown fluid was found\r\nin the cavity of the belly, and the fore part of the stomach presented a\r\nlaceration four inches long. There were likewise several lacerations,\r\none of them three inches long, which intersected the peritonæal coat\r\nalone.[146] A case probably similar in nature has been described by Dr.\r\nRoberts of London, that of a man who died of convulsions in five hours,\r\nand presented after death a long rent in the stomach, with escape of its\r\ncontents into the general cavity of the belly.[147]\r\n\r\nAnother rare variety of rupture of the stomach must also be particularly\r\nnoticed, because the course of the symptoms imitates very closely a case\r\nof poisoning with the irritants. It is _partial rupture_,—or laceration\r\nof the inner coat only. A very interesting case of that description has\r\nbeen related by Mr. Chevallier. A youth of fourteen, on the evening\r\nafter a Christmas feast, at which he ate and drank heartily, was\r\nattacked with violent and frequent vomiting. Next morning he said he\r\nfelt as if the blood in his heart was boiling, he was unable to swallow,\r\nthe pulse became irregular, and pressure on the heart or stomach gave\r\nhim excruciating agony. These symptoms continued till the following day,\r\nwhen he vomited two pounds of blood at successive intervals, and soon\r\nafterwards expired. The inner coat of the stomach was torn in many\r\nplaces, and that of the duodenum was lacerated almost completely round.\r\nNo other disease existed in the bowels or elsewhere.[148]\r\n\r\nSome of the cases now mentioned could hardly be distinguished from the\r\neffects of certain irritant poisons by the symptoms only. But the morbid\r\nappearances in the stomach will at once determine their real nature.\r\n\r\nRupture of the stomach, it may be observed, does not always occasion the\r\nsymptoms hitherto related. Sometimes it causes instant death. Thus a\r\nhealthy coal-heaver in London, while attempting to raise a heavy weight,\r\nsuddenly cried out, clapped his hand over his stomach, drew two deep\r\nsighs, and died on the spot. On dissection a lacerated hole was found in\r\nthe stomach, big enough to admit the thumb; and the stomach did not\r\ncontain any food.[149] This case, along with those of Dr. Roberts and\r\nMr. Weekes, will show that rupture may take place without previous\r\ndistension.\r\n\r\n3. _Rupture of the Duodenum_ is a very rare accident from internal\r\ncauses. The following instance resembles considerably the symptoms of\r\nirritant poisoning. A gentleman, 48 years old, quarrelled violently with\r\nanother while playing billiards immediately after dinner. Soon\r\nafterwards he was seized suddenly with violent pain in the stomach,\r\nvomiting, cold extremities, and a failing pulse; and he died very soon.\r\nThe mucous coat of the duodenum was found much inflamed, and four inches\r\nand a half from the pylorus there was a lacerated hole involving a third\r\nof the circumference of the gut.[150]\r\n\r\n4. Under the next head may be classed rupture of the other organs of the\r\nbelly. _Rupture of the Biliary Ducts_ for example, an extremely rare\r\naccident, has been known to imitate the symptoms of irritant poisoning,\r\nas the following case will show.—An elderly lady, after a slight attack\r\nof jaundice, was seized with violent pain in the stomach, and vomiting\r\nrecurring in frequent fits, and in seventeen hours with extreme\r\ntenderness, tension of the muscles, coldness of the skin, and failure of\r\nthe pulse. She expired in twenty-four hours; and after death the hepatic\r\nduct was found torn across, a gall-stone lay at the opening of the\r\ncystic duct, the peritonæum was here and there inflamed, and three\r\npounds of blood and bile were effused into the cavity of the\r\nabdomen.[151]—The nature of such cases will be always apparent on\r\ndissection, but by no means always from the symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn like manner _rupture of the uterus or its appendages_ may in certain\r\ncircumstances occasion similar symptoms, and so be mistaken for the\r\noperation of poison. A striking example of the kind once came under my\r\nnotice. A middle-aged woman much addicted to drinking, and on that\r\naccount living on indifferent terms with her husband, was suddenly\r\nseized at two in the afternoon with pain in the belly, afterwards with\r\nvomiting and purging, then with extreme exhaustion and coldness of the\r\nextremities; and at ten in the evening she expired. A suspicion of\r\npoisoning having arisen in the neighbourhood, a judicial inspection was\r\nordered by the sheriff of Linlithgowshire, where the case happened; and\r\nthe examination was entrusted to her medical attendant, Mr. Robertson,\r\nand myself. On inquiry, it was found that she had taken nothing whatever\r\nafter breakfasting at eight in the morning, six hours before; and\r\nfarther, that the pain had begun violently in the lower part of the\r\nbelly. These two circumstances alone were almost, if not altogether,\r\nincompatible with the idea of irritant poisoning having been the\r\noccasion of death. But all doubt was completely removed by the\r\ninspection of the body; for the lower part of the belly was filled with\r\na great quantity of clotted blood, which had proceeded from the rupture\r\nof a Fallopian conception.\r\n\r\n5. The next accident which may be noticed on account of its being liable\r\nto be mistaken for the effects of poison is _sudden death from drinking\r\ncold water_.\r\n\r\nIn Britain the most common form of death from this cause appears to have\r\nbeen instant death, arising from the impression on the stomach. It is\r\nnot an uncommon thing for people to drop down instantaneously and die on\r\nthe spot, in consequence of drinking freely of cold water or other\r\nfluids while over-heated.[152] There is an interesting report on a case\r\nof this kind by Pyl in his Memoirs and Observations. The individual had\r\nbeen quarrelling with a companion, and in the height of a fit of violent\r\npassion swallowed a glass of beer; when he dropped down senseless and\r\nmotionless, and died immediately. His wife suspecting the administration\r\nof poison, demanded a judicial inquiry; but nothing was found in the\r\nbody to account for death. Pyl therefore came to the conclusion that the\r\nman died from the sudden impression caused by the cold beer.[153] Dr.\r\nCurrie, after quoting several instances of the like kind, relates the\r\nfollowing remarkable case which occurred to himself. A young man, having\r\njust sat down, panting and bathed in sweat, after a severe match at\r\ntennis, drank greedily from a pitcher of water fresh drawn from a\r\nneighbouring pump. Suddenly he laid his hand on his stomach, bent\r\nforward, became pale, breathed laboriously, and in a few minutes\r\nexpired.[154]\r\n\r\nBut when combined with exposure to a burning sun, as in hot climates,\r\ndrinking cold water when the body is over-heated seems often to excite\r\nalong with irritation in the stomach congestive apoplexy. Dr. Watts has\r\ngiven a good account of these effects as they occurred in the\r\nneighbourhood of New York during the hot season of 1818. During the\r\nsummer of that year the thermometer often stood in the shade so high as\r\n92°; and the labourers in consequence could not be restrained from\r\ndrinking frequently and excessively of cold water. Many were attacked\r\nwith pain in the stomach, sickness, giddiness, and fainting; next with\r\ndifficult breathing, and rattling in the throat; then with apoplexy; and\r\nnot a few perished.[155] These symptoms are very like the effects of\r\nsome narcotico-acrid poisons.\r\n\r\nLastly, drinking cold water sometimes causes symptoms more nearly allied\r\nto those of the pure irritants. Thus some persons, on eating ices, or\r\ndrinking iced-water, or cold ginger-beer in the hot days of summer, are\r\nattacked with violent colic. Others in the like circumstances are\r\nattacked with violent fits of vomiting.[156] Haller has even mentioned\r\nan instance of a man, who after swallowing a large draught of cold water\r\nwhile over-heated, was seized with symptoms of acute gastritis, and died\r\nin fifteen days: and in the dead body the stomach was found gangrenous\r\nand ulcerated at its fundus.[157] M. Guérard relates a similar case,\r\nthat of a quarter-master who, swallowing iced-beer after a hurried\r\njourney in a hot day, was attacked in six hours with shivering, then\r\nwith heat and tightness in the pit of the stomach, vomiting of every\r\nthing he took, anxiety, thirst and frequency of the pulse; next with\r\nextreme prostration, cessation of pain, hiccup, and lividity of the\r\nface; and he expired in five days. Signs of inflammation were found in\r\nthe stomach, such as great redness internally, with spots of\r\nextravasation, and a blackish matter like what he vomited.[158] Cholera\r\nhas also been sometimes referred to the same cause. In the hot summer of\r\n1825 it was remarked that a great number of persons who used to frequent\r\na particular coffee-house in the Palais-Royal at Paris, and the owner\r\namong the rest, were severely affected with cholera. Poison being\r\nsuspected to be the cause, a judicial inquiry was instituted. It was\r\nproved, however, that similar accidents had been observed at other\r\ncoffee-houses, in other cities, and likewise in former hot seasons; and\r\nwhen the whole medical evidence was referred to a commission of\r\nphysicians and chemists, they gave their opinion, that the disease was\r\nowing to the incautious use of ices and iced-water in an unusually hot\r\nsummer.[159] Perhaps cholera arising thus may prove fatal. The following\r\nextraordinary case, which appears to have been of this nature, was\r\ncommunicated to me by the late Dr. Duncan, junior. A bookbinder in this\r\ncity, previously in excellent health, rose one morning at six to kindle\r\nhis fire, and took a large draught of cold water from a pitcher used in\r\ncommon by the whole family. He went immediately to bed again,\r\ncomplaining of pain in the pit of the stomach, and extreme anxiety, and\r\naffected with incessant vomiting. In twelve hours he died without any\r\nmaterial change in the symptoms, and no disease whatever could be\r\ndetected in the dead body. Dr. Duncan satisfied himself from general\r\ncircumstances, that poisoning was quite out of the question; so that,\r\nhowever extraordinary it may appear, his death could be accounted for in\r\nno other way than by ascribing it to the cold water.—Hoffmann says he\r\nwas acquainted with instances where fatal inflammatory fever was induced\r\nby drinking too freely of cold water, and a suspicion of poisoning in\r\nconsequence excited.[160]\r\n\r\n6. _Of Bilious Vomiting and Simple Cholera._—Of all the diseases which\r\nare apt to be confounded with the effects of the irritant poisons, there\r\nis none which it is of so much importance that the medical jurist should\r\nbe able to distinguish as cholera. A trial for poisoning with the common\r\npoisons hardly ever occurs, but an attempt is made to ascribe death to\r\nthat disease; for it is very frequent, and its symptoms bear a close\r\nresemblance to those of the principal poisons of the class we are now\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to give here a detailed account of the symptoms of\r\nsimple cholera. There is the same burning pain in the stomach and bowels\r\nas in irritant poisoning, the same incessant vomiting and frequent\r\npurging, the same tension and tenderness of the belly, the same sense of\r\nacridity in the throat, and irritation in the anus, the same depression\r\nand anxiety, the same state of the pulse.\r\n\r\nIt would be wrong, however, to infer from these resemblances that the\r\ntwo affections are always undistinguishable. Some cases of irritant\r\npoisoning certainly cannot be distinguished by their symptoms from\r\ncholera. Many other cases are similarly circumstanced, because their\r\nparticulars cannot be accurately collected. But there is no doubt that\r\nin others the distinction between poisoning and cholera may be drawn by\r\nthe physician who has been able to ascertain the symptoms in detail. At\r\npresent those points of difference only will be noticed which relate to\r\nthe irritants as a class; others will be mentioned under the head of\r\npoisons individually.\r\n\r\nThe first difference is, that in cholera the sense of acridity in the\r\nthroat does not precede the vomiting, as it sometimes does in poisoning.\r\nIn cholera this sensation is caused by the vomited matter irritating the\r\nthroat, or perhaps by the irritation in the stomach being propagated\r\nupwards by continuity of surface. But, whatever may be its cause, it is\r\ncertain that the sense of acridity or burning sometimes remarked in\r\ncholera never begins before the vomiting. In many cases of poisoning,\r\nthough certainly not in all, it is the first symptom.—The next\r\ndifference is, that in cholera the vomiting is never bloody. I have been\r\nat some pains to investigate this point: and I have been unable to find\r\nany instance of the cholera of this country, which has been accompanied\r\nwith sanguinolent vomiting; neither is such a symptom mentioned in any\r\naccounts I have read of malignant cholera. This article of diagnosis\r\nwill, of course, be open to correction from the experience of other\r\npractitioners. Lastly, a material difference is, that the simple cholera\r\nof this country very seldom proves fatal so rapidly as poisoning with\r\nthe irritants usually does. Death from irritant poisoning is on the\r\nwhole seldom delayed beyond two days and a half, and frequently happens\r\nwithin thirty-six hours, sometimes within six hours, or even less.\r\nMalignant cholera frequently proves fatal in as short a time; but with\r\nregard to the cholera of this country, I believe it may be laid down as\r\na rule hitherto unshaken by all the controversy to which the subject has\r\ngiven rise,—that death is not often caused by it at all, and that death\r\nwithin three days is very rare indeed. A few cases of death within that\r\nperiod, nay, even within twelve hours, have certainly occurred; but\r\ntheir great rarity is obvious from the fact, that many practitioners of\r\nexperience have not met with a single instance, and others with only one\r\ncase in the course of a long practice. Dr. Duncan, senior, mentioned to\r\nme a case, the only one of the kind he had met with, which commenced\r\nsoon after the individual ate a sour orange in the Edinburgh theatre,\r\nand which proved fatal in twelve hours. Dr. Duncan, junior, also met\r\nwith a single case, which was the instance already noticed of cholera\r\nproduced by drinking cold water. Dr. Abercrombie also once, and once\r\nonly, met with a case fatal within two days.[161] Mr. Tatham, a late\r\nwriter on this subject, met with an instance which proved fatal in\r\ntwelve hours.[162] Dr. Burne of London has likewise related an instance\r\nof death within fifteen hours occurring in a child.[163] And I was\r\ninformed in 1831 of a case at Leith which ended fatally in twenty-six\r\nhours, and was at first supposed by the unprofessional inhabitants of\r\nthe place to be an instance of epidemic or malignant cholera. My\r\ncolleagues, Drs. Home, Alison, and Graham, never met with an instance\r\nfatal in so short a time as two or three days; at a meeting of the\r\nMedico-Chirurgical Society of this city, none of the members present\r\ncould remember to have seen such a case;[164] and of the witnesses who\r\nwere brought to swear to this point on a well-known trial, all of them\r\nphysicians of extensive practice, not one could depose that such a case\r\nhad ever come within his personal observation.[165] It has been stated\r\nhowever in a controversial publication written by the late Dr.\r\nMackintosh of this place, that the author had seen many cases fatal\r\nwithin the period now mentioned.[166] This is incomprehensible. For my\r\nown part, I cannot help repeating, as the result of the whole inquiry,\r\nthat simple cholera rarely causes death in this country, in the period\r\nwithin which irritant poisoning commonly proves fatal,—that,\r\nconsequently, every case of the kind will naturally be apt to lead, in\r\npeculiar circumstances, to suspicion of poisoning,—and that in charges\r\nof poisoning, rapid death under symptoms of violent irritation in the\r\nalimentary canal, like those of cholera, must always be considered an\r\nimportant article of a chain of circumstantial or presumptive evidence.\r\n\r\n7. _Of Malignant Cholera._—The history of this disease affords a fair\r\npromise that, in so far as British practitioners are concerned, it may\r\nere long be excluded from the list of those which imitate irritant\r\npoisoning. Meanwhile, however, malignant cholera must be allowed to\r\nbear, in its essential symptoms and their course, a marked resemblance\r\nto poisoning with the irritants. So much indeed is this the case that\r\nsome authors have actually compared its phenomena to the effects of\r\narsenic, tartar-emetic, and other powerful acrids. In many cases the two\r\naffections are undoubtedly not so distinguishable by symptoms as to\r\nwarrant a physician to rely on the diagnosis in a medico-legal inquiry.\r\nBut in many other instances the distinction may be drawn satisfactorily.\r\nThus the uneasiness in the throat which sometimes attends cholera never\r\nprecedes the vomiting. The vomiting in cholera is never bloody. The\r\ncolour and expression of the countenance and whole body are peculiar. In\r\nfrequent instances the early signs which resemble poisoning are followed\r\nby a secondary stage, sometimes of simple coma, sometimes of typhoid\r\nfever, which a practised person may easily distinguish from the\r\nsecondary phenomena produced by some irritants. Lastly, no mistake can\r\narise where the patient, before presenting the symptoms common to both\r\naffections, experiences violent burning pain or certain tastes, during\r\nor immediately after the swallowing of food, drink, or some other\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n8. _Of Inflammation of the Stomach._—Chronic inflammation of the stomach\r\nis a common disease; which, however, on account of the slowness of its\r\ncourse, is not liable to be confounded with the ordinary effects of\r\nirritant poisons. Acute inflammation, on the contrary, follows precisely\r\nthe same course as that of irritant poisoning. But great doubts may be\r\nentertained whether true acute gastritis ever exists in this country as\r\na natural disease. Several of my acquaintances, long in extensive\r\npractice, have stated to me, that their experience coincides entirely\r\nwith that of Dr. Abercrombie, who observes he has “never seen a case\r\nwhich he could consider as being of that nature.”[167] An important\r\nobservation of the same purport has been made by M. Louis, one of the\r\nmost experienced and accurate pathologists of the present time. He says,\r\nthat during six years’ service at the hospital of La Charité, during\r\nwhich he noticed the particulars of 3000 cases and 500 dissections, he\r\ndid not meet with a single instance of fatal primary gastritis. The\r\ndisease only occurred as a secondary affection or complicating some\r\nother disease which was the cause of death.[168] So far as I have\r\nhitherto been able to inquire among systematic authors, the descriptions\r\nof idiopathic acute gastritis appear to have been taken from the\r\nvarieties caused by poison.\r\n\r\nThe following are the only specific accounts I have hitherto met with of\r\nan affection of the nature of idiopathic acute gastritis; and the reader\r\nwill be at no loss to perceive that in each of them it admits of being\r\nviewed differently. The first two are the cases of inflammation referred\r\nby Haller and Guérard to drinking cold water incautiously [p. 100]. The\r\nnext is a remarkable incident related by Lecat, and occurring in 1763. A\r\ngirl, nineteen years old, was attacked while in good health with\r\nshivering, faintness, acute pain in the belly, cold extremities and\r\nimperceptible pulse; and she died in sixteen hours. The stomach was\r\nfound red, and checkered with brownish patches and gangrenous pustules\r\n(probably warty black extravasation): yet it was supposed to have been\r\nascertained that she had not taken any thing deleterious.[169] This\r\nnarrative is certainly to appearance pointed. But when it is added, that\r\nthe girl’s mother was attacked about the same time with precisely the\r\nsame symptoms and died in four hours, I think the reader, when he also\r\nconsiders the imperfect mode in which chemical inquiries were then\r\nconducted, will by no means rest satisfied with Lecat’s assurance that\r\nnothing deleterious was swallowed. The last is an equally singular case\r\ngiven by Dr. Hastings, of Worcester, where poisoning with cantharides\r\nwas suspected. A young lady, liable to indigestion, but at the moment in\r\nbetter health than usual, was attacked with sickness before breakfast\r\nand after it with vomiting. Three days elapsed before she was seen by\r\nher medical attendant, who found her sinking under incessant vomiting,\r\nsevere pain in the loins, strangury, bloody urine, and swelling of the\r\nclitoris, attended with red extravasation of the eyes, and a red\r\nefflorescence on the skin. Death followed next day amidst convulsions;\r\nand there was found in the dead body extravasation of blood between the\r\nkidneys and their outer membrane, into the pelvis of each kidney, and\r\ninto the bladder,—redness of the bronchial membrane, and gorging of the\r\nair-cells with blood,—and general redness of the inside of the stomach,\r\nwith numerous extravasated spots in the submucous coat.[170] It seems to\r\nhave been clearly proved at the coroner’s inquest that poisoning was\r\nhere out of the question. But the case appears rather to have been one\r\nof renal irritation or inflammation than of gastritis, and the affection\r\nof the stomach secondarily merely.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the possibility of acute gastritis being produced by\r\nnatural causes is one of very great interest to the medical jurist. For\r\nits possible occurrence is the only obstacle in the way of a decision in\r\nfavour of poisoning, from symptoms and morbid appearances only, in\r\ncertain cases by no means uncommon, which are characterised by signs of\r\nviolent irritation during life, early death, and unequivocal marks of\r\ngreat irritation in the dead body, namely, bright redness, ulcers, and\r\nblack, granular, warty extravasation. In regard to these effects, it may\r\nwith perfect safety be said, that they can very rarely indeed all arise\r\nfrom natural causes; and for my own part, the more the subject is\r\ninvestigated, the more am I led to doubt whether they ever arise in this\r\ncountry from any other cause than poison. The possible occurrence of a\r\ncase of the kind from natural causes must be granted. But this\r\nconcession ought not to take away from the importance of the contrary\r\nfact as one of the particulars of a chain of circumstantial proof.\r\n\r\nIn whatever way the fact as to the existence of idiopathic acute\r\ngastritis may eventually be proved to stand, an important criterion of\r\nthis disease, as of cholera, will be that the sense of burning in the\r\nthroat, if present at all, does not precede the vomiting.\r\n\r\n9. _Inflammation of the Intestines_ in its acute form is more common\r\nthan inflammation of the stomach, as a natural disease. It is generally\r\naccompanied, however, with constipation of the bowels. Acute enteritis,\r\nunless we choose with some pathologists to consider cholera as of that\r\nnature, is very rarely attended with purging.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of intestinal inflammation, observed only of late by\r\npathologists,[171] but now well known, which bears a close resemblance\r\nto the effects of the irritants. It is a particular variety of\r\nulceration commonly situated near the end of the small intestines,\r\naccompanied at first with trifling or insidious symptoms, and\r\nterminating suddenly in perforation of the gut. It begins with\r\ntubercular deposition under the mucous membrane in roundish patches.\r\nThen an ulcer appears on the middle of one or more of these patches,\r\ngradually spreads over them, and at the same time penetrates the other\r\ncoats. At last when the peritoneal coat alone is left, some trifling\r\naccident ruptures it, the fæcal matters escape into the sac of the\r\nperitonæum, and the patient dies in great agony in the course of one or\r\ntwo days, or in a few hours. Such cases, if not distinguished by the\r\nsymptoms, will be at once recognized by the morbid appearances.\r\nPerforation of the intestines, with similar symptoms, also takes place\r\nwithout the previous tubercular deposit, by simple ulceration of the\r\ncoats.[172]\r\n\r\nAnother form of intestinal inflammation may also be here particularized,\r\nbecause it imitates the effects of the irritants in the cases in which\r\nthey prove slowly fatal. It is a form of aphthous ulceration of the\r\nmucous membrane of the alimentary canal, which appears to affect almost\r\nevery part of it from the throat downwards, and begins commonly in the\r\nthroat. I once met with a remarkable case in which it appeared in the\r\nform of little white ulcers in the back of the throat, and gradually\r\ntravelled downwards to the stomach and from that to the\r\nintestines,—being characterized by burning pain in every one of its\r\nseats, and successively by difficulty of swallowing, by sickness,\r\nvomiting, and tenderness of the stomach, and finally by purging. Such\r\ncases resemble the slow forms of poisoning with arsenic. But they differ\r\nin attacking the several divisions of the alimentary canal in turn,\r\nwhile in the examples of poisoning with arsenic now alluded to, the\r\nwhole canal from the mouth to the anus is affected simultaneously. Dr.\r\nAbercrombie has described a similar disorder, which he appears to have\r\noccasionally seen affecting both the stomach and intestines at the same\r\ntime; but he seems to doubt whether it ever occurs as an idiopathic\r\ndisease, or independently of some co-existing or preceding fever or\r\nlocal inflammation.[173]\r\n\r\n10. _Inflammation of the Peritonæum_, or lining membrane of the belly,\r\nwill not require many remarks. When acute, it is rarely attended in its\r\nearly stage by vomiting; rarely also by irregular action of the\r\nintestines, and never by diarrhœa; and it is at once distinguished in\r\nthe dead body by unequivocal marks of peritonæal inflammation, which are\r\nvery seldom caused by irritant poisons.[174]\r\n\r\n11. The subject of _Spontaneous Perforation of the Stomach_ is an\r\nimportant topic for the medical jurist, because both the symptoms before\r\ndeath and the appearances in the dead body are occasionally very like\r\nthe effects of some of the most active irritant poisons. The following\r\nis a statement of the most material facts hitherto ascertained on this\r\nsubject; but it must be premised that a good deal of obscurity still\r\nhangs over some parts of it.\r\n\r\nSpontaneous perforation of the stomach is of three kinds. One is the\r\nlast stage of some varieties of scirrhus. The indurated membrane\r\nulcerates, the ulcer penetrates first the villous, then the muscular,\r\nand at last the outer or peritoneal coat, so that the contents of the\r\nstomach escape into the belly. The symptoms of the perforation are a\r\nsense of something giving way in the pit of the stomach, acute pain\r\ngradually extending over the whole abdomen, great tenderness and\r\ntension, excessive prostration, and death commonly within twenty-four\r\nhours. The symptoms which precede the perforation in general clearly\r\nindicate organic derangement of the stomach, namely, aggravated\r\ndyspepsia of long standing. Several cases of this description may be\r\nseen in a thesis by M. Laisné,[175] a pupil of Professor Chaussier. Two\r\ncharacteristic cases have been published by Dr. Crampton;[176] and Mr.\r\nAlfred Taylor has referred to several others, the stomachs of which are\r\npreserved in Guy’s Hospital Museum, and gives the particulars of some\r\nwhich had occurred in the practice of that institution or to his\r\nfriends.[177] Occasionally no symptom exists prior to the perforation,\r\nas in an instance related by Dr. Kelly of a stout healthy servant, who\r\nwas suddenly seized with excruciating pain in the stomach and expired in\r\neighteen hours, and in whose body the stomach was found perforated in\r\nthe middle of an extensive thickening and induration of the villous\r\ncoat.[178]\r\n\r\nThe second variety of perforation takes place by simple ulceration\r\nwithout previous scirrhus. In one of Dr. Crampton’s papers will be found\r\nsome remarks by Mr. Travers, along with a case of this kind. The subject\r\nof it was a man of a strumous habit, who enjoyed good health, till one\r\nday at dinner he was suddenly attacked with acute pain in the pit of the\r\nstomach, and died in thirteen hours. The stomach was found perforated in\r\nthe centre of a superficial ulcer of the mucous coat, occupying\r\ntwo-thirds of the ring of the pylorus.[179] This case shows that the\r\npresent variety of perforation may take place without the preliminary\r\norganic disease being indicated by any symptom. The circumstances under\r\nwhich it commenced are peculiarly important in relation to the medical\r\njurisprudence of poisoning. Another case which has been lately described\r\nwith great exactness by M. Duparcque, was preceded only by very trivial\r\ndyspeptic symptoms. Here the whole mischief arose from a small ulcer\r\neight lines long and five in breadth on the inside of the stomach, and\r\nnot more than a line and a half in diameter at the perforation through\r\nthe peritonæum.[180] Several excellent examples of the same disease have\r\nbeen related by Dr. Abercrombie.[181] In one of these the ulcer in the\r\ncentre of which the perforation had been formed, was not bigger than a\r\nshilling, and the rest of the stomach quite healthy. A very instructive\r\ncase of a similar nature, but of unusual duration, has been related by\r\nMr. Alfred Taylor. A young woman, after suffering for some time from\r\nnausea and constant craving for food, but inability to indulge it, and\r\noccasionally from pain in the stomach, was attacked suddenly with the\r\nusual symptoms of perforation, and died forty-two hours afterwards. The\r\nvillous coat of the stomach, though generally healthy, presented at the\r\nlesser curvature several small elevated points, and in the middle of two\r\nof these a sharply-defined ulcer, one affecting the mucous coat only,\r\nwhile the other, which was half an inch in diameter where it affected\r\nthe mucous coat, perforated the muscular and peritonæal coats by a hole\r\nno bigger than a crow-quill.[182] A case still more remarkable has been\r\nalso related by the same author, where the circumstances naturally gave\r\nrise to a strong suspicion of poisoning. A young female in a noble\r\nfamily, subject to slight dyspepsia, was suddenly attacked, three hours\r\nafter a meal, with violent vomiting and pain in the belly. Collapse soon\r\nensued, and in fifteen hours she died, under so strong suspicions of\r\npoisoning that various antidotes were administered. This suspicion was\r\nin some measure borne out by proofs of an intrigue having been carried\r\non between her and a male person in the house, and by the discovery\r\nafter death of the signs of recent sexual intercourse. On examining the\r\ncavity of the abdomen, however, there was found, at the upper and back\r\npart of the stomach near the pylorus, an oval perforation, half an inch\r\nwide, surrounded by a firm, smooth, almost cartilaginous margin, without\r\nany inflammation near it. Mr. Taylor properly points out, that the\r\nsudden occurrence of such violent symptoms so long after a meal is\r\nincompatible with the action of any poison which could cause perforation\r\nin fifteen hours; and that the characters of the perforation were those\r\nof a natural disease long latent. He could not detect a trace of any\r\npoison in the stomach.[183]—In some cases, as in that of M. Duparcque,\r\nthe pain at the moment the perforation is completed is not at first\r\nviolent, because the close proximity of some adjoining organ, such as\r\nthe liver, prevents the contents of the stomach from escaping for a\r\ntime, so that inflammation of the peritonæum is but gradually developed.\r\n\r\nThe third variety of spontaneous perforation is of a much more singular\r\nkind. It is produced not by ordinary ulceration, but by a jelly-like\r\nsoftening of the coats. The gelatinization sometimes extends over a\r\ngreat extent of surface, affecting chiefly the villous coat, so that the\r\naperture through the other membranes is surrounded by extensive\r\npulpiness of the internal membrane. It is seldom accompanied by\r\nvascularity. Its symptoms are exceedingly obscure. In adults there is\r\nvery rarely any symptom at all till the perforation is complete;[184] in\r\nchildren, as appears from a paper by Dr. J. Gairdner of this city, and\r\nanother by Dr. Pitschaft, a German author,[185] the early symptoms\r\nindicate an obscure chronic gastritis. The nature of this singular\r\ndisease will be discussed in the section on the morbid appearances. At\r\npresent it may merely be observed, that the injury caused to the coats\r\nof the stomach seems to be precisely the same with the gelatinization,\r\nwhich is sometimes found after death in persons who had no symptoms of\r\nan affection of the stomach, and which is ascribed by John Hunter,[186]\r\nand most British pathologists, to the solvent action of the gastric\r\njuice in the dead body. This disease is well described by Laisné in his\r\nthesis formerly quoted. The following is a good example: a young lady,\r\npreviously in good health, was awakened at three one morning with\r\nexcruciating pain in the stomach, which nothing could alleviate. She\r\nexpired seven hours after; and on dissection two holes were found in the\r\nback part of the stomach, surrounded with much softening of the villous\r\ncoat.[187] Another case will be mentioned in page 118.—The appearances\r\nproduced by this disease have been mistaken for the effects of corrosive\r\npoisons.\r\n\r\n12. The _gullet_ may be perforated in a similar manner either with or\r\nwithout symptoms. Under the head of the morbid appearances (119) two\r\ninstances will be mentioned in which there were no corresponding\r\nsymptoms. In the following case symptoms did pre-exist. A man, six weeks\r\nafter being bit by a dog, which was killed without its state of health\r\nhaving been ascertained, was attacked with a sense of strangling,\r\nimpossibility of swallowing, delirium, excessive irritability, glairy\r\nvomiting; and he died within twenty-four hours. The gullet, a little\r\nabove the diaphragm, was perforated by a hole two-thirds of an inch in\r\ndiameter, with thin edges; and effusion had taken place into the\r\nposterior mediastinum.[188]\r\n\r\n13. _Perforation of the alimentary canal by worms_ may here also be\r\nnoticed shortly as a disease liable in careless hands to be confounded\r\nwith irritant poisoning. This is far from being a common accident, and\r\nvery rarely takes place during life. In most of the cases in which it\r\nhas been witnessed the symptoms antecedent to death were those not of\r\nirritant, but of narcotic poisoning, and were then owing simply to the\r\ngreat accumulation of worms in the alimentary canal. On this subject the\r\nreader is referred to the article Epilepsy in the introductory remarks\r\non the effects of the narcotic class of poisons. But at times the\r\nsymptoms have been like those of irritant poisoning. Thus the following\r\nis a case of perforation by worms during life giving rise to all the\r\nphenomena and symptoms of peritonæal inflammation. A soldier at\r\nMauritius was seized with slight general fever and severe pain, at first\r\nin the pit of the stomach, and afterwards over the whole belly, which on\r\nthe third day began to enlarge. A tendency to suppression of urine and\r\ncostiveness ensued, then bilious vomiting; and he died on the fourth\r\nday, the belly having continued to increase to the end. On dissection,\r\nseveral quarts of muddy fluid were found in the sac of the peritonæum,\r\nthe viscera were agglutinated by lymph, a round worm was discovered\r\namong the intestines between the navel and pubes, and the ileum was\r\nperforated six inches from the colon by a hole corresponding in size\r\nwith the worm.[189]—A singular case, not however fatal, but which\r\nconfirms the fact, that worms may make their way through the intestines\r\nand other textures during life, is mentioned in Rust’s journal. A woman\r\nafter a tedious illness first vomited several lumbrici, and was then\r\nseized with a painful swelling in the left side, which in the process of\r\ntime suppurated, and discharged along with the purulent matter three\r\nother worms of the same species.[190] Another instance of the same kind,\r\nwhere the perforation of the gut succeeded strangulated hernia, and was\r\nfollowed by the discharge of two lumbrici and ultimate recovery, is\r\ndetailed in the Revue Médicale.[191]\r\n\r\nSymptoms like those of narcotico-acrid poisoning may be caused by worms\r\nwithout perforation. A girl, eight years old and in excellent health,\r\nwas suddenly seized with violent colic pains, vomiting, bloody stools,\r\ntenderness and swelling of the belly, followed by convulsions and coma,\r\nand proving fatal in seven hours. No other explanation of the case could\r\nbe discovered on dissection except the presence of several hundred\r\nascarides in the intestines and thirteen in the stomach.[192]\r\n\r\n14. The next diseases to be mentioned are melæna and hæmatemesis, or\r\npurging and vomiting of pure or of altered blood.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible to mistake them for poisoning, as the pain which\r\naccompanies them is seldom acute, and the discharge of blood generally\r\nprofuse.\r\n\r\n15. The last are _colic_, _iliac passion_, and _obstructed intestine_.\r\nAs the symptoms of some poisons are the same with those of colic, it is\r\nof course sometimes impossible to distinguish the natural disease from\r\nthe effects of poison by attending to the abdominal symptoms only. But\r\nthe distinction in severe cases of poisoning may almost always be drawn\r\nfrom collateral symptoms and extraneous circumstances.—The iliac passion\r\nis distinguished by a complete reversion of the vermicular motion of the\r\nintestines in consequence of which the fæces are often discharged by\r\nvomiting. I am not aware that stercoraceous vomiting is ever caused by\r\npoisoning.—A case has been recorded in Corvisart’s journal, in which\r\niliac passion, originating in obstruction of the ileum by hardened\r\nfæces, and proving fatal in twenty-six hours, gave rise to a judicial\r\ninquiry into the possibility of poisoning.[193] Another instance, that\r\nled to a strong suspicion of poisoning, has been lately published by M.\r\nRostan, in which there was continued vomiting and pain of abdomen,\r\nproving fatal in two days, and arising from the small intestines being\r\nobstructed by an adventitious band.[194] In this case the first\r\ninspectors failed to observe the true cause of the symptoms; but Rostan\r\nand Orfila, who were appointed to examine the body a second time,\r\ndiscovered the constriction, and were unable to find any poison in the\r\nstomach by analysis. Stercoraceous vomiting occurred during life; which\r\nmight have been held sufficient to settle the real nature of the\r\ncase.—Obstruction of the intestines arising from twisting of the gut,\r\nintussusception, foreign bodies, or strangulated hernia, is easily known\r\nby the seat where the pain begins, by the obstinate constipation, and\r\nalso by the excessive enlargement of the belly,—which last, however, is\r\nrather an equivocal symptom.\r\n\r\nThe preceding observations will enable the medical jurist to determine,\r\nhow far a diagnosis may be drawn from the symptoms between poisoning\r\nwith the irritant and the diseases which resemble it. It will be\r\nremarked that the most embarrassing disease, on account of its\r\nfrequency, and peculiar symptoms, is cholera. Cholera, however, may be\r\nrecognised in some instances even considered in regard to the irritants\r\nas a class; and we shall presently find that it may be distinguished\r\nstill better from the effects of some individual poisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n   SECTION II.—_Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Irritant Poisons,\r\n           compared with those of certain natural diseases._\r\n\r\nThe next subject for consideration is the morbid appearances produced by\r\nthe irritants as a class, together with those of a similar nature, which\r\narise from natural causes.\r\n\r\nThe powerful irritants, which are not corrosives, produce simply the\r\nappearances characteristic of inflammation of the alimentary canal in\r\nits various stages,—in the mouth, throat, and gullet vascularity, and\r\nalso, if the case has lasted long enough, ulceration;—in the stomach,\r\nvascularity, extravasation of blood under and in the substance of the\r\nvillous coat and likewise into the cavity of the organ, abundant\r\nsecretion of tough mucus, deposition of coagulable lymph in a fine\r\nnetwork, ulceration of the membranes, occasionally perforation,\r\npreternatural softness of the whole or of part of the villous coat, and\r\non the other hand sometimes uncommon hardness and shrivelling of that\r\ncoat; in the intestines vascularity, extravasation, and\r\nulceration.—Sometimes several of these appearances are to be seen in the\r\nwhole alimentary canal at once. In poisoning with arsenic or corrosive\r\nsublimate it is no unusual thing to meet with redness or ulceration of\r\nthe throat, great disease in the stomach, vascularity of the small\r\nintestines, ulcers in the great intestines, and excoriation of the\r\nanus.—When the poison is an active corrosive much more extensive ravages\r\nare sometimes caused, particularly in the stomach. After poisoning by\r\nthe mineral acids, for example, the whole mucous membrane of the stomach\r\nis at times found wanting; nay, large patches of the whole coats may be\r\nwanting, and the deficiency supplied by the adhesion of the margin of\r\nthe aperture to the adjoining viscera, and the conversion of the outer\r\nmembrane of these viscera into an inner membrane for the stomach.\r\n\r\nOf the appearances here briefly enumerated the particulars will be\r\nrelated partly under what is now to be said of the appearances arising\r\nfrom natural causes, which are liable to be confounded with the effects\r\nof poisons, partly under the head of individual poisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Of redness of the stomach and intestines from natural causes, and its\r\n            distinction from the redness caused by poisons._\r\n\r\nSimple redness of the alimentary mucous membrane in all its forms,\r\nwhether of mere vascularity, or actual extravasation, not only does not\r\ndistinguish poisoning from inflammatory disorders of natural origin, but\r\nwill even seldom distinguish the effects of poison from those of\r\nprocesses that occur independently of disease, and subsequent to death.\r\nOn the subject of real inflammation, as distinguished from redness\r\noriginating after death, or pseudo-morbid redness, as it is commonly\r\ntermed,—a subject of great consequence to the medical jurist,—the reader\r\nmay consult with advantage a paper by Dr. Yelloly,[195] an essay by MM.\r\nRigot and Trousseau,[196] or that of M. Billard.[197] The former authors\r\nproved by experiment, that various kinds of pseudo-morbid redness may be\r\nformed, which cannot be distinguished from the parallel varieties caused\r\nby inflammation; that these appearances are formed after death, and not\r\ntill three, five, or eight hours after it; that they are to be found\r\nchiefly in the most depending turns of intestines, and in the most\r\ndepending parts of each turn, or of the stomach; and that after they\r\nhave been formed, they may be made to shift their place, and appear\r\nwhere the membrane was previously healthy, by simply altering the\r\nposition of the gut. M. Billard, on the other hand, has laid down their\r\ncharacters, and made a minute arrangement of the several kinds. He has\r\ndivided them into ramiform, capilliform, punctated, striated, laminated,\r\nand diffuse redness,—terms which need hardly be explained. I must be\r\ncontent with merely referring to these sources of information for a\r\nparticular account of the appearances in question. But it may be right\r\nat the same time to quote an instance of the most aggravated form of\r\npseudo-morbid redness, in order to convince the reader that all forms\r\nmay equally arise from the same causes. Among other example, then, which\r\nhave been related of laminated redness, or redness in patches from\r\nextravasation, M. Billard mentions the case of a man who hanged himself,\r\nand in whose body was found, on the mucous membrane of the small\r\nintestine where it lay in the right flank, “a large, amaranth-red patch,\r\nsix finger-breadths wide, covered with bloody exudation, and not\r\nremovable by washing:” and in the lower pelvis there was a similar patch\r\nof even larger dimensions.[198]\r\n\r\nAlthough morbid and pseudo-morbid redness of the inner coat of the\r\nalimentary canal cannot be distinguished from one another by any\r\nintrinsic character, M. Billard thinks this may be done by attending to\r\ncollateral circumstances. According to his researches, redness is to be\r\naccounted inflammatory only when it occurs in parts not depending in\r\nposition, or is not limited to such parts: when the mesenteric veins\r\nsupplying the parts are not distended, nor the great abdominal veins\r\nobstructed at the time of death; when the reddened membrane is covered\r\nwith much mucus, particularly if thick, tenacious, and adhering; when\r\nthe mucous membrane itself is opaque, so that when dissected off and\r\nstretched over the finger, the finger is not visible; when the cellular\r\ntissue which connects that membrane with the subjacent coat is brittle,\r\nso that the former is easily scratched off with the nail.\r\n\r\nSome observations may be here also made on another appearance, allied to\r\nthe present group, but which there is strong reason to believe always\r\nindicates some violent irritation at least, if not even irritation from\r\npoison only, in the organ where it is found. It is an effusion under the\r\nvillous coat of the stomach, and incorporation with its substance, of\r\ndark brownish-black, or as it were charred, blood; which is thus altered\r\neither by the chemical action of the poison, or by a vital process. In\r\nmany cases of poisoning with the mineral acids, oxalic acid, arsenic,\r\ncorrosive sublimate, and the like, there are found on the villous coat\r\nof the stomach little knots and larger irregular patches and streaks,\r\nnot of a reddish-brown, reddish-black, or violaceous hue, like\r\npseudo-morbid redness, but dark-grayish-black, or brownish-black, like\r\nthe colour of coal or melanosis,—accompanied too with elevation of the\r\nmembrane, frequently with abrasion on the middle of the patches, and\r\nsurrounded by vascularity. This conjunction of appearances I have never\r\nseen in the stomach, unless it had been violently irritated; and several\r\nexperienced pathologists of my acquaintance agree with me in this\r\nstatement. It bears a pretty close resemblance to melanosis of the\r\nstomach;[199] but is distinguished by melanotic blackness being arranged\r\nin regular abruptly-defined spots, and still better by melanosis not\r\nbeing preceded by symptoms of irritation in the stomach.\r\n\r\nReferring to what was already said under the head of the symptoms of\r\ngastritis [p. 102], I must again express my doubts whether the\r\nappearances now described ever arise in this country from natural\r\ndisease. In the intestines they are sufficiently familiar to the\r\nphysician, as arising from idiopathic enteritis, and from dysentery. But\r\nin the stomach their existence as the effect of natural disease is very\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of coloration of the inner membrane of the stomach, which\r\nmay be shortly alluded to, because it has actually been mistaken for the\r\neffect of irritation from poison, although by no means like it,—is\r\nstaining of the membrane with a reddish, brownish, yellowish, or\r\ngreenish tint, observed in bodies that have been kept some time, and\r\nproduced by the proximity of the liver, spleen, or colon if it contains\r\nfæces. No unprejudiced and skilful inspector could possibly mistake this\r\nappearance for inflammation. But under the impulse of prejudice it has\r\nbeen considered such, and imputed to poison. On the occurrence of such\r\nstains an attempt was made by the French to ascribe to poison the death\r\nof the republican general Hoche. He died rather suddenly on his way from\r\nFrankfort to join his troops; and as poisoning was suspected, the body\r\nwas opened in the presence of three French army-surgeons, and a French\r\nand two German physicians. The only appearance of note in the alimentary\r\ncanal was two darkish spots on the villous coat of the stomach. The\r\nsurgeons drew up a report which imputed his death to poison; but the\r\nphysicians refused to sign it; and other medical people who were\r\nsubsequently added to the commission decided with the latter.[200] The\r\nsurgeons probably would not have been so hasty, if they had not known\r\nthat the result of their complaisance would have been the levying of a\r\nheavy fine on the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe last kind of discoloration of the inner coat which requires mention\r\nis dyeing from the presence of coloured fluids in the contents. A\r\nremarkable instance has been recorded where redness of this nature was\r\nmistaken for inflammation, and the death of the individual in\r\nconsequence ascribed at first to poison. A person long in delicate\r\nhealth died suddenly after taking a laxative draught; and the stomach,\r\nas well as the gullet, being found on dissection red and livid in\r\nvarious places, it was hastily inferred by his medical attendants, that\r\nthese appearances were the effect of poison, and that the apothecary had\r\ncommitted some fatal error in compounding the draught. But another\r\nphysician, who was acquainted with the deceased, although he did not\r\nattend him professionally, strongly suspected he had died a natural\r\ndeath; and happening to know he was in the practice of taking a strong\r\ninfusion of corn-poppy, inferred that the supposed signs of inflammation\r\nwere merely stains arising from the habitual use of this substance.\r\nAccordingly, on making the experiment, he found that in dogs to which a\r\nsimilar infusion was given, appearances were produced identically the\r\nsame.[201]\r\n\r\n_Of the effusion of mucus and lymph from natural causes._—The abundant\r\nsecretion of tough mucus in the stomach is a sign of that organ having\r\nbeen irritated. But the effusion of lymph is more characteristic. This\r\nmay be produced by natural inflammation as well as by irritating\r\npoisons. As arising from either cause, however, it is rare; and\r\ncertainly by no means so common as would be supposed from what is said\r\nin systematic works; for tough mucus has been often mistaken for it.\r\nReticulated lymph adhering to the villous coat, and accompanied with\r\ncorresponding reticulated redness of that coat, such as I have seen in\r\nanimals poisoned with arsenic or oxalic acid, is an unequivocal sign of\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\n_Of idiopathic ulcers and perforation of the stomach and intestines, and\r\ntheir distinction from those caused by poison._—Both ulceration and\r\nperforation may be produced by natural disease. In the ulceration\r\nproduced by poisons there is generally speaking nothing to distinguish\r\nit from natural ulcers; but that caused by some poisons, such as iodine,\r\nis said to differ by the surrounding coloration of the membrane; and\r\nwhen the ulcer is caused by a sparingly soluble poison in a state of\r\npowder, such as arsenic, the cavity of the ulcer is sometimes filled\r\nwith the powder. Perforation is a rare effect of the simple irritant\r\npoisons; but it is often caused by corrosives. It is imitated by two of\r\nthe varieties of perforation from natural disease.\r\n\r\nThe form of natural perforation caused by a common ulcer is precisely\r\nthe same as that caused by the simple irritants, and is incapable of\r\nbeing distinguished, except when it is attended with scirrhus.\r\n\r\nBy far the most remarkable variety, however, of spontaneous perforation\r\nis that which takes place, without proper inflammatory action, from\r\nsimple gelatinizing of the coats. It is very apt to be mistaken, and in\r\na celebrated trial, which will be immediately noticed, was actually\r\nmistaken for the effect of corrosive poison.\r\n\r\nIt may be situated on any part of the stomach, but is oftenest seen on\r\nthe posterior surface. It is sometimes small, more often as big as a\r\nhalf-crown, frequently of the size of the palm, and occasionally so\r\ngreat as to involve an entire half of the stomach. Sometimes there is\r\nmore than one aperture. The margin is of all shapes, commonly fringed,\r\nand almost always formed of the peritoneum, the other coats being more\r\nextensively dissolved. In one instance, however, the peritonæal surface\r\nwas on the contrary the most extensively destroyed;[202] and in a case\r\nwhich occurred in the infirmary here, and was pointed out to me by the\r\nlate Dr. W. Cullen, the peritonæum alone was extensively softened, and\r\npartly dissolved, so as to lay the muscular coat bare on its outer\r\nsurface. The gelatinization therefore sometimes, though very rarely,\r\nbegins on the outside of the stomach. Internally the whole is surrounded\r\nby pulpiness of the mucous coat, generally white, occasionally bluish or\r\nblackish, never granulated like an ulcer, very rarely vascular; and when\r\nvascular, the blood may be squeezed out of the loaded and open vessels.\r\nThe organs in contact with the hole are also frequently softened. Thus\r\nan excavation is sometimes found in the liver or spleen; or the\r\ndiaphragm is pierced through and through. The margins of the latter\r\nholes are without any sign of vascular action, but are generally\r\nbesmeared with a dark pulpy mass, the remains of the softened tissue.\r\nThe pulp never smells of gangrene; with which, indeed, this species of\r\nsoftening is wholly unconnected. The edge of the hole in the stomach\r\nnever adheres to the adjoining organ; yet, even when the hole is very\r\nlarge, the contents of the stomach have not always made their escape.\r\nOften the dissolution of the coats is incomplete. John Hunter and\r\nothers, indeed, have said that a stomach is rarely seen without more or\r\nless solution of the mucous coat.[203] The best account of the\r\nappearances in this state is given by Jaeger of Stuttgardt.[204]\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which this extraordinary appearance occurs are\r\nsingularly various. Professor Chaussier and the French pathologists\r\nconceive it to be always a morbid process constituting a peculiar\r\ndisease; and doubtless cases have occurred in which death appears to\r\nhave arisen from the stomach being perforated during life by\r\ngelatinization.[205] But it has been found much more frequently, when\r\ndeath was clearly the consequence of a different disease, and when there\r\ndid not exist during life a single sign of disorder in the stomach. Thus\r\nit has been found in women who died of convulsions after delivery,—in\r\nchildren who died convulsed or of hydrocephalus,—after death from\r\nsuppuration of the brain, both natural and the result of violence,—from\r\ncoma following an old ulcer of the back, which communicated with the\r\nspinal canal,—from diseased mesenteric glands,—from phthisis,—from\r\nnervous fever,—and after sudden death from fracture of the skull or\r\nhanging:[206] and in all of these circumstances it has occurred without\r\nany previous symptom referrible to a disorder in the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of pathologists are divided as to its nature. The French\r\nconceive it arises from a morbid corrosive action, which, however, may\r\nextend after death, in consequence of the fluids acquiring a solvent\r\npower. Hunter ascribed it entirely to the solvent power of the gastric\r\njuice after death. There are difficulties in the way of both doctrines.\r\nA full examination of the whole inquiry, which is one of much interest\r\nand considerable complexity, would be misplaced in this work; but some\r\nremarks are called for, by reason of the important medico-legal\r\nrelations of the subject, and the uncertainty in which it is at present\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, it appears difficult, if not impossible, to\r\ncomprehend how a vital erosive action can account for the perforations\r\nobserved after death from diseases wholly unconnected with the stomach,\r\nand unattended during life by any symptom of disorder in that organ.\r\nFor, not to dwell on other less weighty arguments,—on the one hand,\r\nthere is during life no symptom of perforation, an accident which if\r\ndeep stupor be not present at the same time is always attended with\r\nviolent symptoms when it arises from any cause but gelatinization,—and\r\non the other hand, there is frequently no escape of the contents of the\r\nstomach into the cavity of the abdomen, though the hole is of enormous\r\nsize, and its edge not adherent to the adjoining organs.—All such\r\nperforations, however, are perfectly well accounted for, on the other\r\ntheory, by what is now known of the properties of the gastric juice.\r\nThis will appear from the following exposition.\r\n\r\nThe power of the gastric juice to dissolve the stomach and other soft\r\nanimal textures was long thought to be fully proved by the well-known\r\nresearches of Spallanzani,[207] Stevens,[208] and Gosse.[209] In later\r\ntimes doubts were entertained on the subject in consequence of negative\r\nresults having been obtained by other experimentalists, more especially\r\nby Montégre.[210] But these apparently discrepant facts and opinions\r\nhave been reconciled by the ulterior experiments of Tiedemann and Gmelin\r\non digestion;[211] who found that the nature and quality of the fluid\r\nsecreted by the stomach vary much in different circumstances,—that, when\r\nits villous coat is not subjected to some stimulus, the fluid which\r\nlines it is not acid, and does not possess any particular solvent\r\naction,—but that when the membrane is stimulated by the presence of food\r\nor other sources of excitement, the quality of the secretion is\r\nmaterially changed, for it becomes strongly acid and is capable of\r\ndissolving alimentary substances both in and out of the body. And still\r\nmore lately the solvent power of the proper gastric juice over the\r\nstomach, and its capability of producing perforation in animals after\r\ndeath, have been established in the most satisfactory manner by Dr.\r\nCarswell,[212] who has shown by a series of incontrovertible facts,—that\r\nin the rabbit when killed during the digestion of a meal, and left for\r\nsome hours afterwards in particular positions, all the phenomena of\r\nspontaneous gelatinized perforations observed at times in man, may be\r\neasily produced at will,—that acidity of the gastric juice is an\r\ninvariable circumstance when such perforations are remarked,—and that\r\nthe appearances in question as they occur in the rabbit are the result\r\nof chemical action alone, and occur only after death. Thus, then, the\r\nphysiological experiments of Tiedemann and Gmelin, together with the\r\ninvestigations of Carswell, not merely establish positively the fact,\r\nthat the stomach may be perforated after death by the gastric juice, but\r\nlikewise account clearly for the negative results obtained by other\r\nexperimentalists. For example, passing over earlier experiments, they\r\nexplain sufficiently the negative results obtained by Dr. Pommer of\r\nHeilbronn,[213] an experimentalist of some reputation in Germany; for,\r\nfalling into the error of some of the less recent experimentalists on\r\nthis subject, he made his observations on animals killed slowly by\r\nstarving,—in which circumstance there is no proper gastric juice in the\r\nstomach, and consequently no solvent action can exist.\r\n\r\nThese statements relative to the causes and phenomena of gelatinized\r\nperforation in the stomach supply the strongest possible presumption\r\nwhich analogy can furnish, that a great proportion of spontaneous\r\ngelatinized perforations in the human subject are owing to the action of\r\nthe gastric juice after death. And this presumption is increased to\r\nsomething not far removed from demonstration by the circumstance, that\r\nin man the process of softening has actually been traced extending in\r\nthe dead body. This interesting fact was first noticed by Mr. Allan\r\nBurns.[214] In the body of a girl who died of diseased mesenteric glands\r\nhe found an aperture in the fore part of the stomach with the usual\r\npulpy margin, and the liver in contact with the hole uninjured. In two\r\ndays more the liver opposite the hole had become pulpy, and its\r\nperitonæal coat quite dissolved; and the back part of the stomach\r\nopposite the hole was also dissolved, so that only its peritonæal coat\r\nremained. Dr. Sharpey has communicated to me a similar observation. On\r\nfinding in the body of a child the stomach perforated and gelatinized,\r\nbut the adjoining organs uninjured, he sewed up the body, to show the\r\nappearances to some of his friends next day. By that time the peritonæal\r\nsurfaces of the spleen and left kidney were found much softened and\r\npulpy where they lay in contact with the hole in the stomach. I have\r\nsince met with a similar occurrence where the perforation affected the\r\nduodenum (p. 120).\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, then, that the action of the gastric juice after\r\ndeath is quite sufficient to account for the greater number of\r\ngelatiniform perforations in the human stomach.\r\n\r\nBut in the second place, it seems scarcely possible to explain every\r\nperforation of the kind in this way. The solvent action of the gastric\r\njuice for example, affords no explanation of a singular case related by\r\nM. Récamier,[215] where, after death in the secondary stage of\r\nsmall-pox, the stomach was transparent and brittle, and perforated in\r\nthe splenic region by a gelatinized hole large enough to admit the\r\nfist,—although the fluid in the stomach was subsequently found incapable\r\nof dissolving another stomach, and almost destitute of free acid. And\r\nstill less will the solvent action of the gastric juice account for such\r\ncases as those of Laisné and Gastellier, quoted in pp. 107–8, or the\r\nFrench medico-legal case to be mentioned in p. 118,—where death is\r\npreceded by a short illness, indicating a violent disorder of the\r\nstomach, and sometimes even characterized by all the marked symptoms of\r\nperforation. In the last description of cases, which are comparatively\r\nvery rare, it seems necessary to admit that the gelatinization takes\r\nplace during life; unless, indeed, it be supposed that the stomach is\r\nfirst perforated during life by ordinary ulcerative absorption, and then\r\ngelatinized after death, in consequence of the irritation existing\r\nbefore death having given rise to an unusual secretion of gastric juice.\r\n\r\nPassing now to the differences between these gelatinized perforations,\r\nand the perforations caused by corrosive poisons, it may in the first\r\ninstance be observed, that the margin of a corroded aperture is\r\nsometimes of a peculiar colour,—for example, yellow with nitric acid,\r\nbrown with sulphuric acid or the alkalis, orange with iodine. But a much\r\nbetter, perhaps indeed an infallible criterion, and one of universal\r\napplication, is the following. Either the person dies very soon after\r\nthe poison is introduced, in which case vital action may not be excited\r\nin the stomach: or he lives long enough for the ordinary consequences of\r\nviolent irritation to ensue. In the former case, as a large quantity of\r\npoison must have been taken, and much vomiting cannot have occurred,\r\npart of the poison will be found in the stomach: In the latter case, the\r\npoison may have been all ejected; but in consequence of the longer\r\nduration of life, deep vascularity, or black extravasation must be\r\nproduced round the hole, and sometimes too in other parts of the\r\nstomach; changes which will at once distinguish the appearance from a\r\ngelatinized aperture. There is no doubt that the stomach may be\r\nperforated by the strong corrosives, and yet hardly any of the poison be\r\nfound in the stomach after death. Thus in a case related by Mertzdorff\r\nof poisoning with sulphuric acid, where life was prolonged for twelve\r\nhours, he could detect by minute analysis only 4½ grains of the acid in\r\nthe contents and tissue of the stomach. But then the hole was surrounded\r\nby signs of vital reaction, and so was the spleen upon which the\r\naperture opened.[216] Judging from what I have often seen in animals\r\nkilled with oxalic acid, which is the most rapidly fatal of all\r\ncorrosives, so that little time is allowed for vital action, and also\r\nseveral times in persons who had died quickly from the action of\r\nsulphuric acid, I believe no poison can dissolve the stomach, without\r\nsuch unequivocal signs of violent irritation of the undissolved parts of\r\nthe villous coat, as will secure an attentive observer from the mistake\r\nof confounding with these appearances the effects of spontaneous\r\nerosion. Spontaneous erosion is very generally united with unusual\r\nwhiteness of the stomach, and there is never any material vascularity.\r\n\r\nResting on the description now given of the spontaneous and poisonous\r\nvarieties of corrosion, it is an easy matter to decide a controversy,\r\nwhich at the time it occurred made a great deal of noise, and upon which\r\nthe opinions of toxicologists have been unnecessarily divided. It is the\r\nquestion regarding death by poison which occurred in the trial of Mr.\r\nAngus at Liverpool in 1808 for the murder of his housekeeper Miss Burns.\r\nThe poison suspected was corrosive sublimate. The symptoms were those of\r\nirritation in the alimentary canal,—vomiting, purging, and pain. In the\r\ndead body there was not any particular redness either of the intestines\r\nor of the stomach. But on the fore part of the stomach an aperture was\r\nfound between the size of a crown piece and the palm of the hand; it had\r\na ragged, pulpy margin; and the dissolution of the inner coat extended\r\ntwo inches from it all round the hole. No mention is made of adhesion or\r\ncoloration of the margin. This description, it will be remarked, answers\r\nexactly that given above of spontaneous gelatinized perforation; and the\r\nabsence of the signs of vital action around the hole and in the rest of\r\nthe stomach is incompatible with the effects of a strong corrosive\r\npoison, unless death had occurred very soon after it was swallowed.\r\nThis, however, was out of the question; for then the poison would have\r\nbeen found in the stomach,—which it was not.[217]\r\n\r\nThe case of Angus is not the only instance in recent times of\r\nspontaneous perforation having given rise to an opinion by medical men\r\nin favour of poisoning, and consequently to a criminal trial. Six years\r\nafterwards a similar incident occurred in France. A young woman near\r\nMontargis having died of a short illness, and a large erosion having\r\nbeen found in the stomach after death, six practitioners, on a view of\r\nthe parts, and without referring to the antecedent symptoms or\r\nattempting an analysis of the contents of the stomach, declared that she\r\ndied of the effects of some corrosive poison. The husband and\r\nmother-in-law, against whom there does not appear to have been a shadow\r\nof general evidence, were therefore imprisoned and subsequently tried\r\nfor their lives. Luckily, however, an intelligent physician of the town\r\nsaw the error of the reporters, and after vainly endeavouring to\r\npersuade them to revise their opinion, was the means of the case being\r\nremitted to the medical faculty of Paris. That distinguished body, with\r\nProfessor Chaussier at its head, gave a unanimous and decided opinion,\r\nnot only that there was not any proof of poisoning, but likewise that\r\nthe woman could have died of nothing else than spontaneous perforation.\r\nThe leading features of the medical evidence will at once show how\r\nindefensible the conduct and opinion of the original reporters were. The\r\nlast meal taken by the woman before she became ill, and the only one at\r\nwhich poison could have been administered by the prisoners, was her\r\nsupper; her illness did not begin till past six next morning; the\r\nsymptoms were mortal coldness, fainting, general pains, headache, pain\r\nin the stomach, purging and colic, without vomiting, and she died after\r\ntwenty-four hours’ illness; the morbid appearances were general redness\r\nof the stomach, softening and pulpy destruction of a third part of its\r\nposterior parietes, and nevertheless the presence in the stomach of a\r\npint and a half of fluid matter, containing evidently the remains of\r\nsoup taken by the woman after she felt unwell. On the decision of the\r\nParisian faculty the prisoners were discharged; and the original\r\nreporters were deservedly handled with great severity in several\r\npublications that appeared not long after.[218]\r\n\r\n_Of perforations of the Gullet and Intestines from natural causes, and\r\ntheir distinctions from those produced by poisons._—The intestines, and\r\nsometimes even the gullet, may be perforated by the same erosive or\r\nsolvent process as the stomach. Thus Mr. Allan Burns observes, that in\r\nfour plump children, whose previous history he could not learn, he found\r\nevery part of the alimentary canal, from the termination of the gullet\r\ndown to the beginning of the rectum, reduced to a gluey, transparent\r\npulp, like thick starch. The bodies were quite free from putrefaction;\r\nbut the abdomen exhaled a very sour smell when opened. No other organic\r\nderangement could be detected.[219] The particulars of a similar case,\r\nwith an account of the symptoms, have been lately published by Mr.\r\nSmith, a London surgeon. In the body of a child who died of protracted\r\ndiarrhœa subsequent to weaning, the whole intestines, from the duodenum\r\nto the sigmoid flexure of the colon, were found fourteen hours after\r\ndeath gelatinous, semitransparent, and so soft and brittle that they\r\ncould not bear their own weight, but tore when lifted between the\r\nfingers. The stomach and rectum were healthy.[220] I lately met with the\r\nfollowing instance, where the erosion clearly took place after death. In\r\nthe body of a girl who died within twelve hours of poisoning with\r\nred-precipitate, the stomach and duodenum were found much inflamed, but\r\nquite entire and firm three days after death. Eighteen days afterwards,\r\nwhen I had an opportunity of examining these organs, their textures\r\nremained firm everywhere, except a few inches below the pylorus, where I\r\nfound two apertures in the duodenum, each as big as a crown, and\r\nsurrounded by extensive jelly-like softening.\r\n\r\nThe following case from Laisné’s treatise shows that the gullet may be\r\nalso dissolved in the same way. A woman three days after delivery was\r\nattacked with puerperal peritonitis, and died in four days. In the belly\r\nwere found the usual morbid appearances of peritonitis: but in addition\r\nthere was in the lower part of the gullet a large oval aperture two\r\ninches long, which penetrated through the posterior mediastinum into the\r\nlungs.[221] Another singular instance of the same kind has already been\r\nmentioned under the head of the symptoms (see p. 107). Another has been\r\ndescribed by Dr. Marshall Hall. In a child who died of bronchitis, an\r\nopening was found in the gullet about the size of a pea, so that the\r\ncanal of the gullet communicated with the sac of the pleura; and several\r\nveins appeared also to have been opened.[222] The stomach was likewise\r\nperforated.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to draw the distinction between these perforations\r\nand the effects of poison. The throat and gullet may be partially\r\ndisorganized or corroded by the strong corrosives; but they are very\r\nrarely penetrated, since the greater part of the poison must pass into\r\nthe stomach or be rejected by vomiting. Destruction of the mucous coat\r\nis a common consequence, and stricture occasionally follows; but I have\r\nhitherto met with only one instance among the innumerable published\r\ncases of poisoning with the mineral acids, alkalis, and other\r\ncorrosives, where the gullet was perforated. In that case the\r\nperforation was the result of slow ulceration from poisoning with\r\nsulphuric acid, where life was prolonged for two months.[223]\r\nPerforation from simple corrosion never occurs. The intestines are never\r\nperforated by chemical corrosion from within, for either the poison is\r\nin a great measure expelled from the stomach by vomiting, or the pylorus\r\ncontracts and prevents the passage of every poison that is sufficiently\r\nconcentrated to corrode. Both the small and great intestines might be\r\ncorroded from without, in consequence of the poison escaping through a\r\nhole in the stomach. I am not acquainted, however, with any case of the\r\nkind where, intestinal perforation has occurred.\r\n\r\nWhen the intestines are pierced by true ulceration, it is impossible to\r\ntell whether it arose from natural disease or an irritant poison.\r\n\r\nThe mode of forming a diagnosis between the symptoms and appearances of\r\nirritant poisoning and those of natural disease being thus explained,\r\nthe different species of poisons which have been arranged in the class\r\nof irritants will now be considered in their order.\r\n\r\nThe irritant class of poisons may be divided into five orders: the acids\r\nand their bases; the alkalies and their salts; the metallic compounds;\r\nthe vegetable and animal irritants; the mechanical irritants. In a short\r\nappendix some substances will be mentioned which are not usually\r\nconsidered poisonous, but are capable of causing violent symptoms when\r\ntaken in large doses.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of poisons included in the first order have a very\r\npowerful local action. Most of them possess true corrosive properties\r\nwhen they are sufficiently concentrated. Most of them likewise act\r\nremotely. One of them, oxalic acid, is evidently not so much an irritant\r\nas a narcotico-acrid; but since its most frequent action as seen in man\r\nis irritation, it seems inexpedient to break the natural arrangement for\r\nthe sake of logical accuracy. This is far from being the only instance\r\nwhere the toxicologist is compelled to violate the principles of\r\nphilosophical classification.\r\n\r\nIn the present Order are included four of the mineral acids, the\r\nsulphuric, nitric, muriatic and phosphoric, with their bases,\r\nphosphorus, sulphur, and chlorine: To these may be added iodine and\r\nbromine, with their compounds, and also oxalic and acetic acid, two of\r\nthe vegetable acids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                  OF POISONING WITH THE MINERAL ACIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the mineral acids, the most important, because the most common, are\r\n_sulphuric_, _hydrochloric_, and _nitric_ acids. They are remarkably\r\nsimilar in their effects on the animal economy. Phosphoric acid is of\r\nmuch less consequence, and will be noticed cursorily.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid (_vitriolic acid_, _vitriol_—_oil of vitriol_),\r\nhydrochloric acid (_muriatic acid_,—_spirit of salt_) and nitric acid\r\n(_aqua-fortis_), have been long known to be possessed of very energetic\r\nproperties; and consequently cases of poisoning with them have often\r\nbeen observed. The instances of the kind hitherto published have been\r\nchiefly the result of suicide; a considerable number have originated in\r\naccident; and, however extraordinary it may appear, a few have been\r\ncases of murder. Tartra, in an excellent memoir on the subject of\r\npoisoning with nitric acid, quotes an instance of a woman having been\r\npoisoned while in a state of intoxication by that acid being mixed with\r\nwine and poured down her throat.[224] Valentini has related the case of\r\na woman who was killed by frequent doses of sulphuric acid given under\r\nthe pretence of administering medicines.[225] In 1829 an hospital\r\nservant was condemned at Strasbourg for trying to murder his wife in\r\nlike manner, by first making her ill with tartar-emetic and then giving\r\nher sulphuric acid in syrup, under the pretence of curing her.[226] At\r\nthe Aberdeen autumn circuit in 1830 a woman Humphrey was convicted of\r\nmurdering her husband by pouring the same acid down his throat while he\r\nlay asleep with his mouth open.[227] On the whole, considering the\r\npowerful taste and excessively acrid properties of these poisons, it is\r\nprobable that they will seldom be resorted to for the purpose of making\r\naway with another person, who is an adult, and in a state of\r\nconsciousness. Of late, however, there have been several instances in\r\nour country of murder committed on infants in this barbarous manner. A\r\nwoman Malcolm was executed here in 1808 for murdering her own child, an\r\ninfant of eighteen months, by pouring sulphuric acid down its\r\nthroat;[228] another woman Clark was tried for the same crime at Exeter\r\nin 1822; a man was executed lately at Manchester for murdering in the\r\nsame way his son, a child four years and a half old;[229] and the\r\nparticulars of an interesting trial will be presently noticed, that of\r\nOverfield, who was executed at Shrewsbury in 1824, for poisoning his\r\nchild in the like manner.[230]\r\n\r\nIn a medico-legal point of view, the mineral acids are interesting on\r\nanother account. Of late a new crime has arisen in Britain, the\r\ndisfiguring of the countenance by squirting oil of vitriol on it. It\r\noriginated in Glasgow, during the quarrels in 1820, between masters and\r\nworkmen regarding the rate of wages,[231] and became at last so\r\nfrequent, that the Lord Advocate, in applying for an act of Parliament\r\nto extend the English Stabbing and Maiming act to Scotland, added a\r\nclause which renders the offence now alluded to capital. In 1828 a woman\r\nMacmillan was tried here and condemned under that act.[232] The crime\r\nafterwards became common in England. Three cases were noticed in the\r\nnewspapers as having occurred in London, in November, 1828; and two\r\nothers near Manchester in the spring of 1829. It is now much less\r\nfrequent.\r\n\r\nThe mineral acids are also very interesting on scientific grounds. They\r\nafford the purest examples of true corrosive poisons, their poisonous\r\neffects depending entirely on the organic injury they occasion in the\r\ntextures to which they are applied. It is of use to set out, in\r\ninvestigating the effects of poisons, by determining the phenomena\r\npresented under such circumstances. When made aware of the rapidity with\r\nwhich other irritating poisons prove fatal, and the slight signs they\r\ncommonly leave of their operation, one cannot fail to be struck with\r\ndiscovering what the animal frame will sometimes endure from these the\r\nmost violent of all irritants, and nevertheless recover.\r\n\r\nIn laying down the mode of determining by chemical evidence a case of\r\nsupposed poisoning with any of the three mineral acids mentioned above,\r\nit will be unnecessary to notice any of their chemical properties,\r\nexcept those from which their medico-legal tests are derived.\r\n\r\nThe only common properties that require notice are, their power of\r\nreddening the vegetable blue colours, for showing which litmus-paper is\r\ncommonly used, and is most convenient: and their power of staining and\r\ncorroding all articles of dress, especially such as are made of wool,\r\nhair, and leather. This last property is specified, though a familiar\r\none, because it always forms important evidence in criminal cases. In\r\norder to give precision to such evidence, it is necessary to remember,\r\nthat if the article of dress is a coloured one, it is generally rendered\r\nred by the mineral acids; but that the vegetable acids also will redden\r\nmost articles of dress, although they do not corrode them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  I.—OF POISONING WITH SULPHURIC ACID.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid is extensively employed in very many trades, is used even\r\nfor some domestic purposes, and is consequently familiar to every one.\r\nHence it is the mineral acid which has been most commonly used as a\r\npoison, especially for committing suicide. Of 35 cases of poisoning with\r\nthe mineral acids which occurred in England in the years 1837 and 1838,\r\n32 were caused by this acid (p. 90).\r\n\r\n\r\n             SECTION I.—_Of the Tests for Sulphuric Acid._\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid is known as a poison chiefly in the form of the\r\nconcentrated commercial acid. But a few cases of poisoning have also\r\nbeen produced by blue-liquor or the solution of indigo in strong\r\nsulphuric acid; and one instance[233] has been recorded of poisoning\r\nwith the aromatic sulphuric acid of the Pharmacopœias, which is an\r\ninfusion of aromatics in a mixture of sulphuric acid, ether and alcohol.\r\nIn the following remarks on its tests, it will be sufficient to consider\r\nit _first_ in the concentrated form,—_secondly_, in a state of simple\r\ndilution,—and _thirdly_, when mixed with various impurities, more\r\nespecially with vegetable and animal matter. The acid solution of indigo\r\nmay be known by the tests for the concentrated acid, and its blue\r\ncolour, removable by a solution of chlorine; and the aromatic sulphuric\r\nacid may be distinguished by its odour and the tests for the diluted\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n1. _When concentrated_ it is oily-looking, colourless, or brownish from\r\nhaving acted on organic particles, without odour, much heavier than\r\nwater, and capable of quickly corroding animal substances. If from these\r\nproperties, and its effect in reddening litmus, its exact nature be not\r\nconsidered obvious, it may be heated with a few chips of copper; when\r\nsulphurous acid is disengaged and may be readily recognised by its\r\nodour.\r\n\r\n2. _When diluted_, it may be distinguished from all ordinary acids by\r\nsolution of nitrate of baryta occasioning a heavy white precipitate of\r\nsulphate of baryta, which is insoluble in nitric acid. Selenic and\r\nsulphurous acids, however, and also, as Mr. Alfred Taylor informs me he\r\nhas lately found, the fluo-silicic acid, are similarly acted on in all\r\nrespects. But selenic and fluo-silicic acids in all forms, and\r\nsulphurous acid in a state of solution, are so seldom met with, being\r\nknown only in the laboratory of the scientific chemist, that they can\r\nscarcely be considered sources of fallacy. Sulphuric acid may at once be\r\ndistinguished from sulphurous acid, by the latter possessing a peculiar\r\npungent odour. From the two other acids it may be distinguished by\r\ncollecting and drying the barytic precipitate, mixing this with\r\ncharcoal, converting it into sulphuret of barium by heating it in a\r\nplatinum spoon before the blowpipe, and then adding diluted muriatic\r\nacid to the sulphuret, so as to disengage sulphuretted hydrogen\r\ngas,—which again is easily known by its odour, or its property of\r\nblackening paper dipped in solution of acetate of lead. A much more\r\nimportant source of fallacy than these is the possible presence of a\r\nbisulphate in solution, or a neutral sulphate along with any other free\r\nacid; for these substances will present the same reactions with litmus\r\nand barytic salts as free sulphuric acid itself. Much has been published\r\nlately upon this point; but the difficulty has not yet been\r\nsatisfactorily overcome. It may be got rid of indeed by proving, that no\r\nbisulphate or neutral sulphate is present. Their absence may be shown by\r\nno solid residuum being left on evaporating the suspected fluid, or at\r\nleast no more than a mere haziness, owing to the sulphate of lead which\r\ncommercial sulphuric acid always contains in small quantity. Or as\r\nOrfila suggests, we may establish their absence still better by\r\nconcentrating the fluid, and finding that neither carbonate of soda,\r\nwhich would cause a precipitate with earthy or metallic bases, nor\r\nchloride of platinum, which would do so with potash or ammonia in\r\ncombination, nor fluo-silicic acid, which precipitates soda salts, has\r\nany effect when applied to separate portions of the subject of inquiry.\r\nBut suppose it appears in the course of these trials that one or more\r\nbases are actually present, how is it to be settled whether the\r\nsulphuric acid, indicated by litmus and a salt of baryta, is really free\r\nor not? To this question I must reply, that no method has yet been\r\nproposed, which is at once satisfactory and easily available. Mr. Alfred\r\nTaylor proposes to concentrate the fluid, and agitate it with alcohol,\r\nin the hope that the alcohol will remove sulphuric acid, and not a\r\nsulphate, from the water.[234] But it removes sulphuric acid from a\r\nbisulphate even when dry, and still more when a little water is present.\r\nOrfila[235] proposes, in the case of sulphuric acid in vinegar,—where\r\nthere is both a vegetable acid and a neutral sulphate of lime,—to\r\nconcentrate to a sixth, and agitate the residuum with four times its\r\nvolume of sulphuric ether, in the expectation that this fluid will\r\nremove the free acid alone, and separate it from sulphates. But\r\nnotwithstanding the authority of his name for the fact, pure ether will\r\nnot remove sulphuric acid from a watery fluid; and etherized alcohol,\r\nwhich does remove it, takes it away also, like alcohol itself, from\r\nbisulphates. These results I have observed in some careful trials made\r\nalong with Dr. Douglas Maclagan. I suspect, therefore, that where\r\nsulphates or bisulphates do exist, there is no absolutely satisfactory\r\nway of determining whether free sulphuric acid also co-exists, except by\r\na quantitative analysis, for ascertaining whether the amount of acid and\r\nof bases corresponds with this supposition or not. And it is scarcely\r\nnecessary to add, that so operose a method is scarcely applicable to\r\nordinary medico-legal investigations.\r\n\r\n3. It is seldom that the medical jurist is called on to search for\r\nsulphuric acid in either of the states already mentioned. Much more\r\ngenerally it has mingled with and acted on various organic substances.\r\nThe circumstances in which it has usually to be sought for in the\r\npractice of medical jurisprudence are twofold,—on the one hand, in\r\nstains on clothes,—and on the other, in vomited matter, the contents of\r\nthe stomach, or organic mixtures generally.\r\n\r\n_Process for analyzing stains on clothes._—When sulphuric acid is thrown\r\nupon your clothes, it produces a permanent red, reddish-brown, or\r\nyellowish stain, destroys the cloth entirely or renders it brittle, and\r\nin consequence of its strong attraction for water keeps the stain long\r\nin a moist state. In the course of the decomposition of the cloth a part\r\nof the acid is itself decomposed, sulphurous acid being disengaged. But\r\nit is an important medico-legal fact, that after a time the change\r\neither goes on very slowly, or is arrested altogether, possibly by the\r\ndilution of the acid with moisture from the atmosphere; and that\r\nconsequently it may be discovered in a free state in stains after a much\r\nlonger interval than would _à priori_ be expected. In the case of\r\nMacmillan formerly alluded to, Dr. Turner and I, who were employed by\r\nthe crown to examine the different injured articles of dress, found on a\r\nman’s hat, stock, shirt-collar and coat many discoloured and corroded\r\nspots, which were sour to the taste fourteen days after the crime was\r\ncommitted; in the subsequent case of Mrs. Humphrey I discovered\r\nsix-tenths of a grain of free sulphuric acid in two small spots on a\r\nblanket seven weeks after the crime; and from an express experiment on\r\nthe same blanket with two drops of acid of known strength, it appeared\r\nthat only one-half of the acid disappeared in seven weeks. It may\r\ntherefore be inferred, that, in every instance where stains have been\r\nproduced by concentrated sulphuric acid on clothes, at least on woollen\r\nclothes, and no attempt has been made to remove the remaining acid by\r\nwashing or neutralization, a sufficient quantity will be present even\r\nafter several weeks to admit of being satisfactorily detected by\r\nchemical analysis.\r\n\r\nThe following are the steps of the process which appear to me the most\r\ndelicate and equivocal. Cut away the stained spots; boil them for a\r\nminute or two in several successive small portions of distilled water;\r\nand filter if necessary. Next prove the acidity of the fluid by litmus,\r\nand likewise by the taste if the quantity of solution is large enough to\r\nallow of so coarse a test being used; and with a few drops ascertain the\r\nexistence of sulphuric acid in one form or another by nitrate of baryta\r\nand nitric acid, as mentioned in the process for the pure diluted acid.\r\nIf no precipitate appears, the search for sulphuric acid is at an end.\r\nBut if a precipitate is produced, ascertain the absence of bisulphates\r\nand sulphates by proving the absence of bases, according to the method\r\ndescribed in the process for the simple diluted acid. If, however, bases\r\nbe found in material proportion to the acid, the analysis is subject to\r\nall the difficulties mentioned above in speaking of the detection of the\r\ndiluted acid in similar circumstances.\r\n\r\n_Process for the contents of the stomach and other complex\r\nmixtures._—When sulphuric acid has been mixed with various mineral and\r\norganic substances, it may in no long time cease to exist in the free\r\nstate. Part may be decomposed by organic matter in the way formerly\r\nmentioned. Or the whole may be neutralized at once by earthy or alkaline\r\ncarbonates, administered purposely as antidotes. Or it may also be\r\nneutralized more slowly by the gradual development of ammonia in\r\nconsequence of the decay of the animal matter co-existing in the\r\nmixture. Thus in a case mentioned by Mertzdorff of a child killed in\r\ntwelve hours with sulphuric acid, the contents of the stomach did not\r\nredden litmus, but on the contrary had an ammoniacal odour; and they\r\ncontained a considerable quantity of a soluble sulphate, probably the\r\nsulphate of ammonia.[236] In like manner MM. Orfila and Lesueur found\r\nthat when this acid was left some months in a mixture which contained\r\nputrefying azotized matter, it was gradually neutralized by\r\nammonia.[237] It appears from Orfila’s latest researches,[238] that in\r\nmost cases of acute poisoning with this substance some free acid will be\r\nfound in the contents or tissues of the stomach, provided alkalis or\r\nearths were not given as antidotes, and the examination of the body be\r\nmade before decay sets in.\r\n\r\nThe detection of sulphuric acid in complex organic mixtures, simple\r\nthough it appears at first sight, is one of the most difficult problems\r\nin medico-legal chemistry. The difficulty arises from a variety of\r\nsources,—from the probable presence of neutral sulphates along with free\r\nhydrochloric, acetic, or some other acid,—the possible presence of a\r\nbisulphate,—the occasional neutralization of the sulphuric acid by\r\nantidotes given during life, or ammonia evolved during decay after\r\ndeath,—or its neutralization, together with the development of a\r\ndifferent free acid, by its having displaced this acid from a salt\r\nexisting in the mixture.\r\n\r\nThe subject was investigated in most of its relations in the last\r\nedition of the present work, and a process proposed which overcame some\r\ndifficulties, but left others untouched. The inquiry has been since\r\nundertaken also by M. Devergie and Professor Orfila, but with most\r\nsuccess in Germany by Dr. Simon.[239] The result of all these researches\r\nis, that a satisfactory process for detecting sulphuric acid in organic\r\nmixtures still remains to be discovered. Meanwhile the most eligible\r\nmethod appears to me to be the following.\r\n\r\na. _If the mixture be acid_, add distilled water, if necessary, boil,\r\nfilter, and test a few drops of the fluid with nitrate of baryta,\r\nfollowed by nitric acid. If there be no precipitate, the search for\r\nsulphuric acid is at an end. If a precipitate form, distil the fluid\r\nfrom a muriate of lime or oil bath, at a temperature not above 240°,\r\ntill the residuum acquire a thick syrupy consistence; and preserve apart\r\nthe last sixth of the distilled liquor. In this liquor test for\r\nhydrochloric acid by litmus-paper and nitrate of silver, and for acetic\r\nacid by litmus-paper, and the odour and taste of the liquid. If these\r\nacids be not in the distilled fluid, they are not in the residuum. In a\r\nportion of this residuum search for nitric acid, and in another portion\r\nfor oxalic acid, by the processes for these poisons in complex mixtures.\r\nIf all these acids be thus proved to be absent, it is most unlikely that\r\nthe acidity of the mixture is owing to any other but sulphuric acid,\r\nespecially in the case of the contents or textures of the stomach.\r\n\r\nDilute now what remains of the syrupy extract, and add nitrate of baryta\r\nwith nitric acid. If a precipitate arise, there is a strong presumption\r\nthat the acidity of the mixture was owing either to a bisulphate or to\r\nfree sulphuric acid. And between these the question may be almost\r\nsettled, first by the probability or improbability of a bisulphate\r\nhaving come in the way, and secondly, by the symptoms and morbid\r\nappearances. The result however cannot justify more than a presumptive\r\nopinion.—But if hydrochloric, acetic or nitric acid be indicated in the\r\nsubject of analysis, or an acid sulphate, the whole process is vitiated,\r\nand it is scarcely possible to arrive at any trustworthy conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties adverted to above have been made the ground-work of\r\nvarious processes; which however seem to me all imperfect.—It has been\r\nproposed to divide the mixture into two equal parts, to precipitate one\r\ndirectly by a barytic salt, to do the same with the other after drying\r\nand incinerating it, to compare the weight of the precipitates, and to\r\ninfer the presence of free sulphuric acid if the former is more than\r\ndouble the latter. Various objections however may be brought against\r\nthis check, not the least serious being its difficulty in ordinary\r\nhands, whenever the precipitates are none of them considerable.—Simon\r\nproposes to exhaust the residuum of evaporation with absolute alcohol,\r\nin the hope that free sulphuric acid will alone be taken up;[240] but he\r\nhimself found that neutral sulphates are dissolved partially; and\r\nbesides, alcohol removes sulphuric acid from bisulphates.—Orfila\r\nproposes to remove free sulphuric acid by agitating the concentrated\r\nliquor with sulphuric ether, and separating and evaporating off the\r\nether; for he holds that all neutral and acid salts of sulphuric acid\r\nare insoluble in ether.[241] This proposal is unaccountable. Simon\r\nstated in his paper three years before, that ether does not remove\r\nsulphuric acid from watery fluids containing it. And Dr. Douglas\r\nMaclagan and I, on inquiring into the matter, found that we could not,\r\nby means of ether, separate a particle of sulphuric acid from an ounce\r\nof rice soup and mucilage to which ten drops of the acid had been added.\r\nThe process of Orfila for establishing the absence of bases in a simple\r\nwatery solution is applicable to organic mixtures also, after\r\nincineration. But if bases be present in material quantity, all the\r\ndifficulties now in question remain in full force.\r\n\r\nb. _When the mixture is neutral_, sulphuric acid may be detected in it\r\nby the first steps of the preceding process. But the inference, that it\r\nonce existed free can only be drawn when the subject of examination is\r\nnot in a state of decay, when the quantity of sulphate of baryta\r\nobtained is considerable, when the administration of an antidote is\r\nproved, and when the ashes after incineration contain the antacid base\r\nwhich is said to have been administered. Even then the inference is only\r\npresumptive.\r\n\r\n\r\n SECTION II.—_Of the Mode of Action of Sulphuric Acid, and the Symptoms\r\n                         caused by it in Man._\r\n\r\nIt was formerly observed that the action of the strong mineral acids is\r\nindependent of the function of absorption. They act by the conveyance\r\nalong the nerves of an impression produced by the irritation or\r\ndestruction of the part to which they are applied. There is very little\r\ndifference between the three acids in the symptoms they excite or the\r\naction they exert.\r\n\r\nWhen sulphuric acid is introduced directly into a vein it causes death\r\nby coagulating the blood. Thus, when Professor Orfila injected in the\r\njugular vein of a dog half a drachm diluted with an equal weight of\r\nwater, he observed that the animal at once struggled violently,\r\nstretched out its limbs, and expired; and on opening the chest\r\nimmediately, he found the heart and great vessels filled with coagulated\r\nblood.[242]—Nitric acid and hydrochloric acid act in the same way.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, they are introduced into the stomach, the blood\r\nas usual remains fluid for some time after death; the symptoms are\r\nreferrible almost solely to the abdomen; and in the dead body the\r\nstomach is found extensively disorganised, and the other abdominal\r\nviscera sometimes inflamed. If the dose be large, and the animal\r\nfasting, death may take place in so short a time as three hours: but in\r\ngeneral it lives much longer.[243]\r\n\r\nWhen the strong mineral acids are applied outwardly, they irritate,\r\ninflame, or corrode the skin. The most rapid in producing these effects\r\nis the nitric, or rather the nitrous acid. The strong, fuming nitrous\r\nacid even causes effervescence when dropped on the skin.\r\n\r\nOrfila has proved that sulphuric acid, as well as the two other mineral\r\nacids, is absorbed; for they may be detected in the urine, when they are\r\nintroduced either into the stomach or through a wound.[244] He could not\r\nsucceed, however, in detecting any of them in the liver or spleen; in\r\nwhich organs it will be seen, hereafter, that various other poisons may\r\nbe discovered by chemical analysis. But Mr. Scoffern seems to have found\r\nsulphuric acid in the kidney, even although the individual survived the\r\ntaking of the poison nearly two days.[245] It is also worthy of remark,\r\nthat, as will be proved presently, these acids may pass through the\r\ncoats of the stomach by transudation, and so be found on the surface of\r\nthe other organs in the belly.\r\n\r\nToxicology is indebted to M. Tartra for the first methodic information\r\npublished respecting the symptoms caused in man by sulphuric acid and\r\nthe other mineral acids:[246] but many important additional facts have\r\nbeen made known by numberless cases of poisoning which have since\r\nappeared, chiefly in the periodic journals.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms caused by all the three acids are so nearly the same, that\r\nafter a detailed account of those occasioned by sulphuric acid, it will\r\nnot be necessary to add much on the subject under the head of nitric and\r\nmuriatic acid.\r\n\r\nM. Tartra considers that four varieties may be observed in the effects\r\nof the mineral acids. 1. Speedy death from violent corrosion and\r\ninflammation; 2. Slow death from a peculiar organic disease of the\r\nstomach and intestines; 3. Imperfect recovery, the person remaining\r\nliable ever after to irritability of the stomach; 4. Perfect recovery.\r\n\r\n1. The most ordinary symptoms are those of the first variety,—namely,\r\nall the symptoms that characterise the most violent gastritis,\r\naccompanied likewise with burning in the throat, which is increased by\r\npressure, swallowing, or coughing;[247]—eructations proceeding from the\r\ngases evolved in the stomach by its chemical decomposition;—and an\r\nexcruciating pain in the stomach, such as no natural inflammation can\r\nexcite. The lips are commonly shrivelled, at first whitish, but\r\nafterwards brownish in the case of sulphuric acid. Occasionally there\r\nare also excoriations, more rarely little blisters. Similar marks appear\r\non other parts of the skin with which the acid may have come in contact,\r\nsuch as the cheeks, neck, breast, or fingers; and these marks undergo\r\nthe same change of colour as the marks on the lips. I had an opportunity\r\nof witnessing this in the case of the man who was disfigured by the\r\nMacmillans (p. 122) with sulphuric acid. He was cruelly burnt on the\r\nface as well as on the hands, which he had raised to protect his face;\r\nand the marks were at first white, but in sixteen hours became brownish.\r\nThe inside of the mouth is also generally shrivelled, white, and often\r\nmore or less corroded; and as the poisoning advances, the teeth become\r\nloose and yellowish-brown about the coronæ. The teeth sometimes become\r\nbrown in so short a time as three hours.[248] Occasionally the tongue,\r\ngums, and inside of the cheeks are white, and as it were polished, like\r\nivory.[249] There is almost always great difficulty, and sometimes\r\ncomplete impossibility, of swallowing. In the case of a child related by\r\nDr. Sinclair, of Manchester, fluids taken by the mouth were returned by\r\nthe nose; and the reason was obvious after death; for even then the\r\npharynx was so much contracted as to admit a probe with difficulty.[250]\r\nOn the same account substances taken by the mouth have been discharged\r\nby an opening in the larynx which had been made to relieve impending\r\nsuffocation. The matter vomited, if no fluids be swallowed, is generally\r\nbrownish or black, and at first causes effervescence, if it falls on a\r\npavement containing any lime. Afterwards this matter is mixed with\r\nshreds of membrane, which resemble the coats of the stomach, and\r\nsometimes actually consists of the disorganised coats, but are generally\r\nnothing more than coagulated mucus. The bowels are obstinately costive,\r\nthe urine scanty or suppressed; and the patient is frequently harassed\r\nby distressing tenesmus and desire to pass water. The pulse all along is\r\nvery weak, sometimes intermitting, and towards the close imperceptible.\r\nIt is not always frequent; on the contrary, it has been observed of\r\nnatural frequency, small and feeble in a patient who survived fifteen\r\ndays.[251] The countenance becomes at an early period glazed and\r\nghastly, and the extremities cold and clammy. The breathing is often\r\nlaborious, owing to the movements of the chest increasing the pain in\r\nthe stomach,—or because pulmonary inflammation is also at times\r\npresent,—or because the admission of air into the lungs is impeded by\r\nthe injury done to the epiglottis and entrance of the larynx. To these\r\nsymptoms are added occasional fits of suffocation from shreds of thick\r\nmucus sticking in the throat, and sometimes croupy respiration, with\r\nsense of impending choking.\r\n\r\nSuch is the ordinary train of symptoms in cases of the first variety.\r\nBut sometimes, especially when a large dose has been swallowed, instead\r\nof these excruciating tortures, there is a deceitful tranquillity and\r\nabsence of all uneasiness. Thus, in the case of a woman who was poisoned\r\nby her companions making her swallow while intoxicated aqua-fortis mixed\r\nwith wine, although she had at first a good deal of pain and vomiting,\r\nthere were subsequently none of the usual violent symptoms; and she died\r\nwithin twenty hours, complaining chiefly of tenesmus and excessive\r\ndebility.[252] Occasionally eruptions break out over the body:[253] but\r\ntheir nature has not been described.\r\n\r\nDeath is seldom owing to the mere local mischief, more generally to\r\nsympathy of the circulation and nervous system with that injury.\r\nAccording to Bouchardat death arises from the acid entering the blood in\r\nsufficient quantity to cause coagulation.[254] But although this\r\ncertainly happens sometimes to the blood in the vessels of the stomach\r\nand adjacent organs, as will be proved under the head of the morbid\r\nappearances, there is no evidence that the same takes place throughout\r\nthe blood-vessels generally, or in the great veins and heart in\r\nparticular. Bouchardat’s proofs of the detection of sulphuric acid in\r\nthe blood are not satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe duration of this variety of poisoning with the acids is commonly\r\nbetween twelve hours and three days. But sometimes life is prolonged for\r\na week[255] or a fortnight;[256] and sometimes too death takes place in\r\na very few hours. The shortest duration among the numerous cases of\r\nadults mentioned by Tartra is six hours;[257] but Dr. Sinclair, of\r\nManchester, has related a case which lasted only four hours and a\r\nhalf;[258] a man lately died in the Edinburgh Infirmary within four\r\nhours; and Professor Remer of Breslau once met with a case fatal in two\r\nhours.[259]\r\n\r\nThe quantity required to produce these effects has not been ascertained,\r\nand must be liable to the same uncertainty here as in other kinds of\r\npoisoning. The smallest fatal dose of sulphuric acid I have hitherto\r\nfound recorded was one drachm. It was taken with sugar by mistake for\r\nstomachic drops by a stout young man, and killed him in seven days.[260]\r\nAn infant of twelve months has been killed in twenty-four hours by half\r\na tea-spoonful, or about thirty minims.[261] A man has recovered after\r\ntaking six drachms.[262]\r\n\r\n2. The second variety of symptoms belong to a peculiar modification of\r\ndisease, which is described by Tartra in rather strong language. It\r\nbegins with the symptoms already noticed; but these gradually abate. The\r\npatient then becomes affected with general fever, dry skin, spasms and\r\npains of the limbs, difficult breathing, tension of the belly,\r\nsalivation, and occasional vomiting, particularly of food and drink.\r\nAfterwards membranous flakes are discharged by vomiting, and the\r\nsalivation is accompanied with fœtor. These flakes are often very like\r\nthe mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines; and such they have\r\noften been described to be. More probably, however, they are of\r\nadventitious formation; for the mere mucous coat of the alimentary canal\r\ncannot supply the vast quantity that is evacuated. There is no doubt,\r\nhowever, that the lining membrane of the alimentary canal is\r\noccasionally discharged. Dr. Wilson has mentioned an instance of the\r\nejection by coughing of about nine inches of the cylindrical lining of\r\nthe pharynx and gullet six days after sulphuric acid was taken.[263]\r\nSometimes worms are discharged dead, and evidently corroded by the\r\npoison.[264] Digestion is at the same time deranged, the whole functions\r\nof the body are languid, and the patient falls into a state of marasmus,\r\nwhich reduces him to a mere skeleton, and in the end brings him to the\r\ngrave. Death may take place in a fortnight, or not for months. In one of\r\nTartra’s cases the patient lived eight months. The vomiting of\r\nmembranous flakes continues to the last.\r\n\r\n3. The third variety includes cases of imperfect recovery. These are\r\ncharacterized by nothing but the greater mildness of the primary\r\nsymptoms, and by the patient continuing for life liable to attacks of\r\npain in the stomach, vomiting of food and general disorder of the\r\ndigestive function.\r\n\r\n4. The last variety comprehends cases of perfect recovery, which are\r\nsufficiently numerous even under unpromising appearances. From the\r\naverage of 55 cases recorded by Tartra it appears that the chances of\r\ndeath and recovery are nearly equal. Twenty-six died, 19 of the primary,\r\n7 of the secondary disorder. Twenty-nine recovered, and of these\r\ntwenty-one perfectly. Suicidal are for obvious reasons more frequently\r\nfatal than accidental cases.\r\n\r\nTartra has not taken notice in his treatise of another form of poisoning\r\nwith the strong acids,—in which the injury is confined to the gullet and\r\nneighbouring parts. In Corvisart’s Journal there is the case of a man,\r\nwho began to drink sulphuric acid for water while intoxicated, but\r\nsuddenly found out his error before he had swallowed above a few drops;\r\nand consequently the chief symptoms were confined to the throat. After\r\nhis physician saw him he was able to take one dose of a chalk mixture;\r\nbut from that time he was unable to swallow at all for a fortnight.[265]\r\nMartini likewise met with a similar instance of complete dysphagia from\r\nstricture in the gullet caused by sulphuric acid.[266] His patient\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nIt also appears exceedingly probable, that the strong acids may cause\r\ndeath, without reaching the stomach or even the gullet, by exciting\r\ninflammation and spasm of the glottis and larynx. Such an effect may\r\nvery well be anticipated from an attempt to commit murder with these\r\npoisons; as the person, if he retains consciousness at the time, may\r\nbecome aware of their nature before he has swallowed enough to injure\r\nthe stomach.\r\n\r\nThus, Dr. A. T. Thomson says in 1837, that he once met with the case of\r\na child, who, while attempting to swallow strong sulphuric acid by\r\nmistake for water, died almost immediately, to all appearance from\r\nsuffocation caused by contraction of the glottis; and it was ascertained\r\nafter death that none of the poison had reached the stomach.[267]\r\nProfessor Quain describes a similar case, occurring also in a child,\r\nwhere impending death was prevented by artificial respiration, and acute\r\nbronchitis ensued, which proved fatal in three days. In this instance\r\nthickening of the epiglottis and great contraction of the upper opening\r\nof the larynx showed the violent local injury inflicted there,\r\ninflammation could be traced down the trachea into the bronchial tubes,\r\nbut no trace of injury could be detected in the gullet and stomach.[268]\r\nIn a very interesting and carefully detailed case by Mr. Arnott, where\r\nthe poison taken was the nitric acid, the injury was confined in a great\r\nmeasure to the gullet and larynx,—the stomach, which was distended with\r\nfood at the time, being very little affected. The chief symptoms at\r\nfirst, besides great general depression, were croupy respiration and\r\nmuch dyspnœa, which became so urgent, that laryngotomy was performed,\r\nand with complete relief to the breathing. But the patient nevertheless\r\nrapidly sunk under the symptoms of general exhaustion, and died in\r\nthirty-six hours without presenting any particular signs of the\r\noperation of the poison on the stomach; and the traces of action found\r\nthere after death were trifling.[269]\r\n\r\nThe importance of the fact established by these cases will appear from\r\nthe following medico-legal inquiries. A Prussian medical college was\r\nconsulted in the case of a new-born child, in which the stomach and\r\nintestines were healthy, and did not contain poison, but in which the\r\ncuticle of the lips was easily scraped off, the gums, tongue, and mouth\r\nyellowish-green, as if burnt, the velum and uvula in the same state, the\r\nrima glottidis contracted, and the epiglottis, larynx, and fauces\r\nviolently inflamed. The College declared, that a concentrated acid had\r\nbeen given, and that death had been occasioned by suffocation. Sulphuric\r\nacid was found in the house; and the mother subsequently confessed the\r\ncrime.[270] A case was formerly quoted (p. 75), where MM. Ollivier and\r\nChevallier found traces of the action of nitric acid on the lips, mouth,\r\nthroat and upper fourth of the gullet, but not lower. In this instance\r\nthe reporters came to the opinion from the absence of injury in the more\r\nimportant parts of the alimentary canal, as well as from the marks of\r\nnail scratches on the neck, and the gorged state of the lungs, that\r\ndeath had been produced by strangling, after an unsuccessful attempt by\r\nthe forcible administration of nitric acid. It is quite possible,\r\nhowever, that death might quickly ensue from the effects of the poison\r\non the throat and gullet. In the course of the judicial inquiries M.\r\nAlibert stated that he had known repeated instances of death from\r\nswallowing nitric acid, although none of it reached lower down than the\r\npharynx. Ollivier in his paper doubts the accuracy of this statement;\r\nbut the cases quoted above show clearly that such injury may be done to\r\nthe glottis as will be adequate of itself to occasion death.[271]\r\n\r\nIt seems farther not improbable that, among the terminations of\r\npoisoning with the strong mineral acids, scirrhous pylorus must also be\r\nenumerated. This is a very rare effect of the action of corrosive\r\npoisons. But M. Bouillaud has related an instance of death from\r\nscirrhous pylorus in its most aggravated shape, which supervened on the\r\nchronic form of the effects of nitric acid, and which proved fatal in\r\nthree months.[272]\r\n\r\nIn some circumstances the stomach seems to acquire a degree of\r\ninsensibility to the action of the strong acids. Tartra, in alluding to\r\nwhat is said of certain whisky-drinkers acquiring the power of\r\nswallowing with impunity small quantities of the concentrated acids, has\r\nrelated the case of a woman at Paris, who, after passing successively\r\nfrom wine to brandy and from that to alcohol, at last found nothing\r\ncould titillate her stomach except aqua-fortis, of which she was seen to\r\npartake by several druggists of veracity.[273] The fire-eating\r\nmountebanks too are said to acquire the same power of endurance; but\r\nmuch of their apparent capability is really legerdemain. On the other\r\nhand, a very extraordinary sensibility to the action of the diluted\r\nmineral acids has been supposed to exist in the case of infants at the\r\nbreast,—so great a sensibility, that serious symptoms and even death\r\nitself have been ascribed to the nurse’s milk becoming impregnated with\r\nsulphuric acid, in consequence of her having taken it in medicinal\r\ndoses. By two writers in the London Medical Repository griping pains,\r\ntremors and spasms have been imputed to this cause;[274] and a writer in\r\nthe Medical Gazette says he has seen continued griping, green diarrhœa\r\nand fatal marasmus ensue,—apparently, he thinks, from ulceration of the\r\ngastro-intestinal mucous membrane.[275] Without questioning the great\r\ndelicacy and tenderness of that membrane in infants, I must nevertheless\r\nexpress my doubts whether so small a quantity taken by a nurse,\r\namounting in the cases in question only to four or six drops a day,\r\ncould really produce fatal or even severe effects on her child.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid is not less deadly when admitted into the body through\r\nother channels besides the mouth. Thus, it may prove fatal when\r\nintroduced into the rectum. A woman at Bruges in Belgium had an\r\ninjection administered, in which, being prepared hastily in the middle\r\nof the night, sulphuric acid had been substituted by mistake for\r\nlinseed-oil. The patient immediately uttered piercing cries, and passed\r\nthe remainder of the night in excessive torture. In the morning the\r\nbed-clothes were found corroded, and a portion of intestine had\r\napparently come away; and she expired not long afterwards.[276]\r\n\r\nDeath may also be occasioned by the introduction of this acid into the\r\near. Dr. Morrison relates a case of the kind, where nitric acid, which\r\nis analogous in action, was poured by a man into his wife’s ear, while\r\nshe lay insensible from intoxication. She awoke in great pain, which\r\ncontinued for two or three days. In six days an eschar detached itself\r\nfrom the external passage of the ear; and this was followed by profuse\r\nhemorrhage, which recurred daily more or less for a month. On the day\r\nafter the eschar came away, and without any precursory symptom\r\nreferrible to the head, she was attacked with complete palsy of the\r\nright arm, and in eight days more with tremors and incomplete palsy of\r\nthe rest of that side of the body. These symptoms subsequently abated;\r\nbut they again increased after an imprudent exertion, and she died in a\r\nstate of exhaustion seven weeks after the injury. The whole petrous\r\nportion of the temporal bone was found carious, but without any distinct\r\ndisease of the brain or its membranes.[277]\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid and the other mineral acids are equally poisonous when\r\ninhaled in the form of gas or vapour; and they then act chiefly by\r\nirritating or inflaming the mucous membrane of the air-passages and\r\nlungs. For some observations on their effects in this form both on\r\nplants and animals the reader may refer to the Chapter on Poisonous\r\nGases.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid belongs to the poisons alluded to under the head of\r\nGeneral Poisoning,—of whose operation satisfactory evidence may be\r\noccasionally drawn from symptoms only. If immediately after swallowing a\r\nliquid which causes a sense of burning in the throat, gullet, and\r\nstomach, violent vomiting ensues, particularly if the vomited matter is\r\nmixed with blood; if the mouth becomes white, and stripped of its lining\r\nmembrane, and the cheeks, neck, or neighbouring parts show vesications,\r\nor white, and subsequently brown excoriated spots;—if the clothes show\r\nred spots and are moist and disintegrated there,—I cannot see any\r\nobjection to the inference, that either sulphuric or muriatic acid has\r\nbeen taken. In this opinion I am supported by a good authority, Dr.\r\nMertzdorff, late medical inspector at Berlin.[278]\r\n\r\n\r\n   SECTION III.—_Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Sulphuric Acid._\r\n\r\nThe outward appearance of the body in cases of Tartra’s first variety in\r\nthe action of the acids is remarkably healthy; every limb is round,\r\nfirm, and fresh-looking.\r\n\r\nOn the lips, fingers, or other parts of the skin, spots and streaks are\r\nfound where sulphuric acid has disorganized the cuticle. These marks are\r\nbrownish or yellowish-brown, and present after death the appearance of\r\nold parchment or of a burn; sometimes there are little blisters.[279]\r\n\r\nThe lining membrane of the mouth is more or less disorganized, generally\r\nhardened, and whitish or slightly yellowish. The pharynx is either in\r\nthe same state, or very red or even swelled. The rima glottidis, as in\r\nthe case described by Dr. Sinclair and in that of Mr. Arnott, is\r\nsometimes contracted, the epiglottis swelled, or on the contrary\r\nshrivelled, and the commencement of the larynx inflamed.[280] The gullet\r\nis often lined with a dense membrane, adhering firmly, resembling the\r\ninner coat, but probably in general a morbid formation; and the\r\nsubjacent tissue is brown or red. Sometimes, however, the inner coat or\r\nepithelian of the gullet loses its vitality, and is detached in part or\r\naltogether. In Mr. Arnott’s case the pharynx and upper gullet were lined\r\nby a pale lemon-coloured membrane, which in the lower two-thirds of the\r\ncanal was completely detached and was plainly the œsophageal membrane;\r\nin the case related by Mertzdorff, the whole inner coat of the gullet,\r\nas well as that of the throat, epiglottis, and mouth, was stripped from\r\nthe muscular coat;[281] and in Dr. Wilson’s case (p. 131), which proved\r\nfatal in ten months, the upper third of the gullet shone like an old\r\ncicatrix, and the lower two-thirds were narrowed, vascular, and softened\r\non the surface.[282] In a few rare cases of chronic poisoning with the\r\nmineral acids the gullet is found perforated by an ulcerative\r\nprocess;[283] but it is never perforated by their corrosive action in\r\nquickly fatal cases. Occasionally the gullet is not affected at all,\r\nthough both the mouth and the stomach are severely injured; and an\r\ninstance has even been published where the acid, in this instance the\r\nnitric, left no trace of its passage downwards till near the\r\npylorus.[284]\r\n\r\nThe outer surface of the abdominal viscera is commonly either very\r\nvascular or livid, or bears even more unequivocal signs of inflammation,\r\nnamely, effusion of fibrin and adhesions among the different turns of\r\nintestine; and these appearances may take place although the stomach is\r\nnot perforated.[285] The cause of this appearance, which is seldom\r\nobserved in poisoning with other irritants, more especially with the\r\nmetallic irritants, is that the acid passes through the membranes of the\r\nstomach by transudation during life,—as will be proved immediately. It\r\nmust be observed, that the peritonæum is sometimes quite natural after\r\ndeath from sulphuric acid, even although the stomach was perforated. I\r\nhave seen this in a case which proved fatal in twelve hours. An\r\nimportant appearance in the abdomen, to which less attention has been\r\nhitherto paid than it deserves, is gorging of the vessels beneath the\r\nperitonæal membrane of the stomach and adjoining organs with dark,\r\nfirmly coagulated blood, arising from the acid having transuded through\r\nthe membranes and acted on the blood chemically. My attention was first\r\nturned to this appearance by an interesting case, which I saw in 1840 in\r\nthe Royal Infirmary of this city, and of which an able account has been\r\npublished by Dr. Craigie.[286] The whole vessels of the stomach were\r\nseen externally to be most minutely injected and gorged, and the blood\r\nin them was coagulated into firmly-cohering cylindrical masses, as if\r\nthe vessels had been successfully filled with the matter of an\r\nanatomical injection. This appearance was also observed in the superior\r\nmesenteric arteries, in the omental vessels, and over the greater part\r\nof the mesentery. It was occasioned by the chemical action of the acid\r\ncoagulating the colouring matter and albumen; for the clotted blood was\r\nstrongly acid to litmus-paper. So too was the peritoneal surface of the\r\nstomach, omentum and intestines. And the acid had transuded through the\r\nstomach and into the omentum and tissues of the intestines during life;\r\nfor in the first place, there was no perforation of the stomach, and\r\nsecondly, I ascertained that there was no free acid either in the matter\r\ndischarged from the stomach before death after the free administration\r\nof antacids, or in the contents of the stomach obtained at the\r\nexamination of the dead body.\r\n\r\nThe stomach, if not perforated, is commonly distended with gases. It\r\ncontains a quantity of yellowish-brown or black matter, and is sometimes\r\nlined with a thick paste composed of disorganized tissue, blood and\r\nmucus. The pylorus is contracted.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane is not always corroded. If the acid was taken\r\ndiluted, the coats may escape corrosion; but there is excessive\r\ninjection, gorging, and blackness of the vessels, general blackness of\r\nthe membrane, sometimes even without softening, as in a case related by\r\nPyl of a woman who first took aqua-fortis and then stabbed herself.[287]\r\nMore commonly, however, along with the blackness there is softening of\r\nthe rugæ or actual removal of the villous coat, and occasionally regular\r\ngranulated ulceration with puriform matter on it.[288] The stomach is\r\nnot always perforated. But if it is, the holes are commonly roundish,\r\nand the coats thin at the margin, coloured, disintegrated, and\r\nsurrounded by vascularity and black extravasation. In some rare cases\r\nthere is no mark of vital reaction except in the neighbourhood of the\r\naperture. A case of this kind is related by Mertzdorff: The margin of\r\nthe hole was surrounded to the distance of half an inch with apparent\r\ncharring of the coats, and this areola was surrounded by redness; but\r\nthe rest of the stomach was grayish-white.[289] I examined with the late\r\nDr. Latta of Leith a similar case, where the limitation of the injury\r\nwas evidently owing to the stomach having been at the time filled with\r\nporridge. The patient, a child two years old, died in twelve hours; and\r\non the posterior surface of the fundus of the stomach, towards the\r\npylorus, there was a hole as big as a half-crown, which was surrounded\r\nto the distance of an inch with a black mass formed of the disorganized\r\ncoats, and of incorporated charred blood. But the rest of the stomach\r\nwas quite healthy. The most remarkable instance of chemical destruction\r\nof the coats yet known to me is a case mentioned by Mr. Watson of this\r\ncity, where suicide was effected by cutting the throat about half an\r\nhour after two ounces of sulphuric acid had been swallowed. The\r\nindividual was at first thought to have died simply of the wound of the\r\nthroat. But on dissection the usual signs of acid poisoning were found;\r\nand among other effects, it was observed that nearly three-fourths of\r\nthe stomach had been entirely destroyed.[290] The perforation, if the\r\npatient lives long enough, is generally accompanied with a copious\r\neffusion into the belly of the usual muddy liquor of peritonitis; and\r\nthe outer surface of the viscera feels unctuous, as if from a slight\r\nchemical action of the acid on them. The acid has actually been found in\r\nthe contents poured out from the stomach into the sac of the\r\nperitonæum.[291]\r\n\r\nOne would expect to find the acid always in the stomach when it is\r\nperforated. Nevertheless it is sometimes almost all discharged. In\r\nMertzdorff’s case, that of an infant who was killed in twelve hours, a\r\nhole was found in the stomach ¾ths of an inch in diameter, and the\r\ncontents of the stomach were effused into the belly: yet by a careful\r\nanalysis the whole acid he could procure from the contents and tissues\r\ntogether was only 4½ grains. Sometimes of course the disappearance of\r\nthe acid may be owing, as in Dr. Craigie’s case, to the effectual\r\nadministration of antacids during life.\r\n\r\nThe inner coat of the duodenum often presents appearances closely\r\nresembling those of the stomach. Sometimes, however, as in the case just\r\nrelated from Mertzdorff, and in the infant I examined, the inner coat of\r\nthe small intestines is not affected at all, probably because in such\r\nrapid cases the pylorus retains a state of spasmodic contraction till\r\ndeath or even after it.\r\n\r\nThe urinary bladder is commonly empty. The thoracic surface of the\r\ndiaphragm is sometimes lined with lymph, indicating inflammation of the\r\nchest. In the case which was fatal in two hours [p. 131], Professor\r\nRemer found the surface of the lungs, as well as that of the liver and\r\nspleen, brown and of a leathern consistence, and the tissue beneath\r\nscarlet;—appearances which he thinks arose from the acid penetrating in\r\nvapour and acting chemically. I have not found this appearance mentioned\r\nby any other writer; but I have seen it in animals poisoned with oxalic\r\nacid. The blood in the heart and great vessels has been several times\r\nseen forming a firm black clot. Kerkring[292] relates an instance of the\r\nkind; in Dr. Latta’s case the appearance was very distinct; and it is\r\ndwelt on strongly in a recent paper by M. Bouchardat.[293] Bouchardat\r\nthinks this state of the blood is simply the effect of the absorbed\r\nacid; but coagulation of the blood in the heart and great vessels,—a\r\nstriking appearance in contradiction to what is observed after death\r\nfrom most other poisons,—is more probably the healthy state of the\r\nblood, and not the effect of the particular poison.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of the body of those who have died of the second\r\nor chronic variety of poisoning with the acids, is that of extreme\r\nemaciation. The stomach and intestines are excessively contracted: The\r\nformer has been found so small as to measure only two inches and a half\r\nfrom the cardia to the pylorus, and two inches from the lesser to the\r\ngreater curvature.[294] Tartra says the intestines are sometimes no\r\nthicker than a writing quill. They are in other respects sound\r\noutwardly, except that they sometimes adhere together.\r\n\r\nInternally the pylorus is contracted. In a case of slow poisoning, fatal\r\nin three months, which has been described by Dr. Braun of Fürth, the\r\nchief appearance besides excessive emaciation was a thickening of the\r\ncoats round and behind the pylorus to such a degree that the opening of\r\nthe pylorus was formed of an almost cartilaginous ring several lines\r\nbroad, and only wide enough to pass a quill.[295] There are spots over\r\nthe stomach apparently of regenerated villous tissue, smoother and\r\nredder than the natural membrane. At the points where the stomach\r\nadheres to the neighbouring organs, its coats are sometimes wanting\r\naltogether, so that when its connections are torn away, perforations are\r\nproduced. The other parts of the body are natural.\r\n\r\nIt may in some circumstances be necessary to determine from the\r\nappearances in the dead body whether sulphuric acid has been the\r\noccasion of death or has been introduced into the body after death. This\r\nmay always be easily done. If a few drachms of sulphuric acid be\r\ninjected into the anus immediately after death, and the parts be\r\nexamined in twenty-four hours, it will be found, that wherever the acid\r\ntouches the gut, its mucous coat is yellowish and brittle, its muscular\r\nand peritonæal coats white, as if blanched, and the blood in the vessels\r\ncharred; the injury is confined strictly to the parts actually touched,\r\nis surrounded by an abrupt line of demarcation, and shows no sign of\r\ninflammatory redness. Nitric acid produces nearly the same effects. The\r\nwhole tunics are yellow, and the disorganization is greater. For these\r\nfacts we are indebted to Orfila.[296]\r\n\r\nIn closing this account of the morbid appearances, some observations\r\nwill be required on the force of evidence derived from them; because\r\ncircumstances may exclude all other branches of medical proof. In many\r\ninstances both of acute and of chronic poisoning with the strong acids,\r\nI conceive, contrary to the general statements of most systematic\r\nwriters on modern medical jurisprudence, that distinct evidence might be\r\nderived from morbid appearances only. Thus, what fallacy can intervene\r\nto render the following opinion doubtful? In a case several times\r\nalluded to as described by Mertzdorff, there were vesicles and brown\r\nstreaks on the lips, neck, and shoulders, similar to the effects of\r\nburning,—almost total separation of the lining membrane of the mouth,\r\nthroat, epiglottis, and gullet,—perforation of the stomach, with a\r\nmargin half an inch wide, which was extensively charred, and surrounded\r\nby a red areola. From the appearances alone Mertzdorff declared that the\r\nchild must have been poisoned with sulphuric acid. Perhaps he should\r\nhave said sulphuric or muriatic acid.\r\n\r\nOr take the case of Richard Overfield, who was condemned at Shrewsbury\r\nAssizes in 1824 for murdering his own child, a babe three months old, by\r\npouring sulphuric acid down its throat. In the dead body the following\r\nappearances were found: The lips were blistered internally and of a dark\r\ncolour externally; the gullet was contracted and its inner coat\r\ncorroded; the lining membrane of the mouth and tongue of a dull white\r\ncolour; the great curvature of the stomach corroded and converted into a\r\nsubstance like wet brown paper; the stomach perforated and a\r\nbloody-coloured fluid in the sac of the peritonæum.[297] If to these\r\nappearances be added the fact that the child’s dress was reddened, what\r\nis there to prevent the medical jurist from declaring, without reference\r\nto chemical evidence, that this case must have been one of poisoning by\r\nsulphuric acid or some other mineral acids?\r\n\r\nIn like manner in the case of Mrs. Humphrey, who was condemned at\r\nAberdeen in 1830 for murdering her husband by pouring sulphuric acid\r\ndown his throat while he was asleep, there was found, on examining the\r\ndead body, two brown spots on the outside of the lips,—whiteness of the\r\ninside of the lips and of the gums,—glazing of the palate,—redness, with\r\nhere and there ash-coloured discoloration, of the uvula, posterior part\r\nof the throat, pharynx and epiglottis,—abrasion of most of the inner\r\ncoat of the gullet,—erosion and dark-red ulceration of the inner coat of\r\nthe stomach in winding furrows. When to these appearances it is added,\r\nthat the man was in good health only forty-seven hours before death, and\r\nwas taken ill instantaneously and violently with burning pain in the\r\nthroat and stomach,[298] it is not easy to see what other opinion could\r\nbe formed of the case, unless that he died of poisoning with a mineral\r\nacid, and probably with sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nAmong the appearances justifying an opinion where chemical evidence\r\nhappens to be wanting, not the least important seems to me to be the\r\npeculiar turgescence and induration of vessels under the peritonæum of\r\nthe stomach and neighbouring organs, occasioned by the chemical\r\ncoagulation of blood in them. It is an appearance, which, when once\r\nseen, cannot be confounded with any natural morbid phenomenon I have\r\never witnessed.\r\n\r\nI am far from desiring to encourage rashness of decision, or to revive\r\nthe loose criterions of poisoning relied on in former times. But there\r\ncannot, in my opinion, be a rational doubt that in the instance of\r\nsulphuric acid there may often be distinct exceptions to the general law\r\nregarding the feebleness of the evidence from morbid appearances; and\r\nthat a witness would certainly be guilty of thwarting the administration\r\nof justice, if, relying on general rules, he refused to admit such\r\nexceptions. What natural disease could produce appearances like those\r\ndescribed above? Assuredly no form of spontaneous perforation bears any\r\nresemblance to that caused in most cases of death from sulphuric acid;\r\nnor is it easy to mention any combination of natural diseases which\r\ncould produce the peculiar conjunction of appearances remarked in the\r\ncase of the man Humphrey.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SECTION IV.—_Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Sulphuric Acid._\r\n\r\nSince this acid and the other mineral acids act entirely as local\r\nirritants, it may be inferred that their poisonous action will be\r\nprevented by neutralizing them. But in applying that principle to the\r\ntreatment it is necessary to bear in mind their extremely rapid\r\noperation; for if much time is lost in seeking for an antidote,\r\nirreparable mischief may be caused before the remedy is taken. Should it\r\nbe possible then to administer chalk or magnesia without delay, these\r\nare the antidotes which ought to be preferred; but it may be well for\r\nthe physician to remember, that in the absence of both he may at once\r\nprocure a substitute in the plaster of the apartment beat down and made\r\ninto thin paste with water. M. Chevallier, in a paper on the antidotes\r\nfor the mineral acids, quotes five cases of poisoning with sulphuric\r\nacid and two with nitric acid, where life seems to have been saved by\r\nthe speedy and free administration of magnesia, although in some cases\r\nso large a quantity as two ounces of the poison had been\r\nswallowed.[299]—A solution of soap is another antidote of no small\r\nvalue. While the antidote is in preparation, the acid should be diluted\r\nby the free use of any mild fluid, such as milk or oleaginous\r\nmatters.—The alkaline bicarbonates are also excellent antidotes; but\r\ntheir carbonates are ineligible, being themselves possessed of corrosive\r\nproperties. In a paper on poisoning with the mineral acids by Dr.\r\nLunding of Copenhagen, the author is disposed to ascribe the large\r\nproportion of deaths in his practice to the system pursued in the\r\nCopenhagen hospital of administering carbonate of potass as an antidote\r\ndaily for weeks together.[300] On the other hand however it may be\r\nmentioned, that in a late memoir, on this description of poisoning Dr.\r\nEbers of Breslau endeavours to show, that there is no reason to dread\r\nthe administration of the alkaline carbonates, even the carbonate of\r\npotash, provided they be given with mucilaginous fluids and syrup in a\r\nrather concentrated form; and he gives three cases illustrative of the\r\ngood effects of this mode of treatment, which he maintains to be free of\r\nall danger, and preferable to every other antidotal method, because the\r\nremedy may be administered in small volume,—an advantage possessed by it\r\nespecially over chalk or magnesia.[301]\r\n\r\nAfter the proper antidote has been given to a sufficient extent, the use\r\nof diluents ought to be continued, as they render the vomiting more\r\neasy.—Some have recommended the stomach-pump for administering antidotes\r\nand diluents; but this is unnecessary. When it is wished to evacuate the\r\nstomach, there is an advantage in allowing it to do so by its own\r\nefforts, if possible; because the evacuation is accomplished in this way\r\nmore completely than by the stomach-pump. Besides, if the patient cannot\r\nswallow fluids, still less can he suffer the tube of the stomach-pump to\r\nbe introduced. On several occasions, indeed, it has been found\r\nimpracticable to introduce it.[302]\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the surpervening inflammation does not differ from that\r\nof inflammation of the stomach. Where there is great difficulty of\r\nbreathing, evidently from obstruction of the larynx, and where the\r\nabsence of abdominal pain, tension or vomiting affords a presumption\r\nthat little injury has been done to the stomach, laryngotomy appears an\r\nadvisable remedy, and has been known to give very great relief.[303] But\r\nthe patient may nevertheless die soon of the sympathetic disorder of the\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   II.—OF POISONING WITH NITRIC ACID.\r\n\r\nNitric acid is more frequently used as a poison abroad than in this\r\ncountry. But even in Britain it is not an uncommon cause of severe\r\naccidents and death.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Of the Tests for Nitric Acid._\r\n\r\n1. _When concentrated_, nitric acid is easily known by the odour of its\r\nvapour, which is peculiar. When pure, the acid as well as its vapour is\r\ncolourless; when mixed with nitrous acid it is of various tints, and\r\ngenerally yellow. The acid of commerce is at times rendered impure by\r\nsulphuric acid, a circumstance which must be attended to in applying the\r\nsubsequent tests.—The simplest test for nitric or nitrous acid is the\r\naction of copper, lead, or tin. If any of these metals in small\r\nfragments, or powder, be thrown into either acid previously diluted with\r\nan equal volume of water, an effervescence takes place, which in the\r\ncase of lead or copper is much accelerated by heat; nitric oxide gas is\r\ndisengaged; and ruddy fumes of nitrous acid gas are formed when the gas\r\ncomes in contact with the oxygen of the air. Another characteristic\r\ntest, which has the advantage of being applicable on an extremely small\r\nscale, is morphia, the alkaloid of opium. This substance is turned in a\r\nfew seconds to a beautiful orange-red colour by nitric acid, and after\r\nlonger contact forms with it a bright yellow solution. No other acid has\r\nthis effect. Muriatic acid, as Dr. O’Shaughnessey has remarked,[304]\r\ndoes not act at all on morphia, and sulphuric acid chars and blackens\r\nit. When nitric acid is added to a solution of narcotin in sulphuric\r\nacid, the colour of the solution is changed from yellow to\r\nblood-red.[305] When it is added to a solution of proto-sulphate of\r\niron, the solution becomes brown, and the addition of sulphuric acid\r\nthen alters the colour to violet.[306] When it is added even in the most\r\nminute proportion to sulphuric acid, the addition of a few particles of\r\nthe alkaloid brucia will render the whole fluid red, passing gradually\r\nto yellow.[307]—Many other characteristic tests might be mentioned; but\r\nthose now specified are more than enough.\r\n\r\n2. _In a diluted state_ this acid is not so easily recognised as the\r\nother mineral acids, for it does not form any insoluble salt or\r\nprecipitate with bases.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient process consists in first ascertaining the acidity\r\nof the fluid, then neutralizing it with potass, evaporating to dryness,\r\nand heating the residue in a tube with sulphuric acid. The vapour\r\ndisengaged, if abundant, may be known by its orange colour in the tube\r\nand its odour. But if small in quantity it is best to distil over the\r\nvapour in a proper apparatus, and to subject the condensed product to\r\nthe tests of morphia, narcotin dissolved in sulphuric acid, and\r\nproto-sulphate of iron dissolved in water. A convenient tube for the\r\npurpose is that represented in Fig. 3; into which the materials are\r\nintroduced by the funnel, Fig. 4. The wide part of the tube may then be\r\ndrawn out in the spirit-lamp flame to any length or fineness that may be\r\nnecessary, so as to conduct the vapour into another tube as a condenser,\r\nor directly into the substances to be used as tests.\r\n\r\n3. _When in a state of compound mixture_, nitric acid, like sulphuric\r\nacid in similar circumstances, may be after a time partly decomposed and\r\npartly neutralized; and when the matter with which it is mixed belongs\r\nto either of the organic kingdoms, more particularly to the animal\r\nworld, its decomposition is more rapid than that of sulphuric acid.\r\nStill it is an important fact, that some of the acid may be discovered\r\nafter a considerable interval. M. Ollivier detected it in various stains\r\non the skin at least a day after it had been applied;[308] Dr.\r\nO’Shaughnessey detected it in a stain on cloth sent to him from Ireland\r\nto Edinburgh;[309] and I have found it in stains made on broad-cloth\r\nwith detached drops seven weeks before.\r\n\r\n_Process for Stains._ Nitric acid produces on the skin a yellow stain,\r\nwhich gradually becomes dirty orange, and finally of a dirty\r\nyellowish-brown; but in all of these states it is at once rendered for a\r\ntime lively yellow by the action of ammonia. I am not aware that any\r\nother yellow stain is similarly affected. Stains on cloth are generally\r\nyellow, reddish-yellow, or brownish-yellow, and are attended with more\r\nor less disintegration of the texture of the cloth. The method of\r\nanalyzing all these stains is as follows:—The stained parts is to be\r\nboiled in a few drachms of pure water several times in succession; and\r\nthe liquid is then filtered, and may be subjected to litmus-paper for\r\nthe purpose of ascertaining its acidity. It is then to be rendered\r\nneutral, or for the sake of greater facility, feebly alkaline, by adding\r\na few drops of a diluted solution of caustic potass, after which the\r\nwhole is evaporated to dryness, and in a vapour-bath, if practicable.\r\nThe residuum is then to be decomposed by sulphuric acid in the same way\r\nas recommended above for the simple diluted acid.—Orfila thinks it\r\nadvantageous to let the stains macerate for some hours in a solution of\r\nbicarbonate of soda rather than to boil them in water. In that case,\r\nhowever, it is necessary to ascertain the acidity of the stains with\r\nlitmus-paper before proceeding to macerate them.\r\n\r\n_Process for Mixtures._ The detection of nitric acid in compound\r\nmixtures, such as the contents of the stomach, is not so easy a matter\r\nas its detection in stains; and indeed a sure and delicate process is\r\nstill a desideratum in medico-legal chemistry. The process varies, as in\r\nthe case of sulphuric acid, according as the subject of analysis is acid\r\nor neutral.\r\n\r\na. _If the mixture be acid_, and the proportion of the acid\r\nconsiderable, it maybe detected without difficulty. It is merely\r\nnecessary to ascertain the acidity of the mixture by litmus-paper, to\r\nneutralize with potass, water being added if necessary, and then to\r\nfilter and evaporate to a convenient degree of concentration. Crystals\r\nwill form on cooling, which may be decomposed by sulphuric acid in the\r\nusual way. But the medical jurist ought not to flatter himself with the\r\nexpectation of meeting often with a proportion large enough to admit of\r\nbeing discovered by so coarse a method of analysis. In general the\r\ncrystallization of the nitrate of potass is prevented by co-existing\r\nanimal or vegetable matter. When the proportion appears inconsiderable,\r\ntherefore, a different process must be pursued. In preparing the former\r\nedition of this work, the present topic was investigated with some care,\r\nand a method suggested which appeared to me at that time more effectual,\r\ndelicate, and conclusive than any previously made public. Since then\r\nProfessor Orfila has also investigated the subject attentively, and\r\nafter trying various methods, has ended in adopting one which is\r\nsubstantially the same as that now referred to, but without a\r\nprecaution, which seems to me essential for success in certain probable\r\nenough circumstances.[310] I am therefore disposed to retain my former\r\nprocess, with some variations and additions in the details.\r\n\r\nMacerate the subject of analysis for a few hours in distilled water,\r\nif it be not already liquid enough; and then boil for a few minutes,\r\nand filter it. Ascertain now whether the fluid be acid to litmus; and\r\nif it be so, neutralize it with solution of potash, or as Orfila\r\nsuggests, with a solution of the purer salt, the bicarbonate of soda.\r\nEvaporate gently, to obtain crystals if possible; and if these do not\r\ntend to the cubical form, distil them with sulphuric acid, and proceed\r\nas directed for nitric acid simply diluted. If crystals do not appear,\r\nor their form tend to the cube,—in which case chloride of sodium is\r\npresent,—redissolve the whole residue of evaporation in distilled\r\nwater; add a slight excess of a warm solution of acetate of silver, to\r\nthrow down organic matter and the chlorine of any chlorides that may\r\nbe present; filter and evaporate to dryness, and distil the residuum\r\nwith sulphuric acid, applying as usual to the vapour the tests of\r\nlitmus-paper and morphia,—also, as Orfila proposes, the solution of\r\nnarcotin in sulphuric acid, and proto-sulphate of iron in water,—and\r\nif the quantity of vapour be great enough, the sense of smell and the\r\naction of copper with the condensed vapour.\r\n\r\nb. _If the mixture be neutral_, proceed exactly as above, except that it\r\nbecomes unnecessary to neutralize the liquid with potash or bicarbonate\r\nof soda. This variety in the process will be principally required, where\r\nearths or alkalis have been administered as antidotes.\r\n\r\nThe process now detailed requires a word or two of commentary.—Organic\r\nmatter is inconvenient because it prevents the nitrate of potash or soda\r\nin the mixture from crystallizing. But it will not prevent the evolution\r\nof nitric acid vapour by distillation with sulphuric acid, even although\r\nthe material be a simple extract without crystals. At the same time it\r\nis better to get rid of as much organic matter as possible, if distinct\r\ncrystals be not obtained by evaporation. A more serious difficulty,\r\nhowever, to which Orfila does not advert, arises from the co-existence\r\nof a chloride. For, in that case, distillation with sulphuric acid may\r\ndisengage not nitric acid, but chlorine, in consequence of the reaction\r\nwhich takes place between the nitric and hydrochloric acids in the act\r\nof being liberated. This is a more important reason for purifying the\r\nliquid by acetate of silver before subjecting it to concentration; but\r\nin addition, by removing organic matter, this precaution increases the\r\nchance of crystals of nitrate of potash or soda being obtained. Its\r\nnecessity, where a chloride co-exists, will appear from the following\r\nexperiment. Four drops of nitric acid neutralized with potass were mixed\r\nwith six ounces of strong barley-broth; from which half an ounce of\r\nlimpid fluid was procured by filtration. One-half of this evaporated to\r\ndryness gave a crystalline residue, which, heated with sulphuric acid in\r\na tube, emitted a strong odour of chlorine; and the moisture which\r\nbedewed the tube scarcely affected morphia. The residuum of the other\r\nhalf of the filtered fluid was redissolved, treated with acetate of\r\nsilver, again filtered, and evaporated to dryness; and the residue was\r\ngently heated in a tube with sulphuric acid. An odour of nitric acid was\r\nnow disengaged, and the moisture on the tube close to the mixture turned\r\na fragment of morphia to bright orange-red.\r\n\r\nAcetate of silver is prepared by mixing strong solutions of acetate of\r\npotass and nitrate of silver, draining and compressing between folds of\r\nbibulous paper the crystalline precipitate which forms, dissolving this\r\nprecipitate by agitating it in boiling water, and finally crystallizing\r\nthe salt again by refrigeration. The crystals, which are sparingly\r\nsoluble in cold water, should be then separated, slightly washed with a\r\nlittle water, and again dried by compression. When put to use, a\r\nsolution should be made by agitating the salt in boiling water, because\r\nat low temperatures water retains very little of the salt; but actual\r\nebullition should be avoided, because acetate of silver is thus quickly\r\ndecomposed.\r\n\r\nIn all medico-legal analyses for nitric acid, care must be taken that\r\nthe different reagents used are free of this acid, and also of nitrates.\r\nSulphuric acid often contains a little nitric, or rather nitrous acid;\r\nwhich may be discovered by the sulphuric acid becoming brown or dark-red\r\nwhen a solution of proto-sulphate of iron is gently poured over it in a\r\ntest-tube; and which may be removed either by boiling the acid with a\r\nfew grains of sugar, according to the formula of the Edinburgh\r\nPharmacopœia, or, as Orfila directs, by boiling it with sulphate of\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTIONS II. III. IV.—_Of the Action, Symptoms, Morbid Appearances, and\r\n               Treatment of Poisoning with Nitric Acid._\r\n\r\nAll the observations made on these topics under the head of sulphuric\r\nacid apply, with few exceptions, to the nitric acid also. A few\r\nstatements therefore on the peculiarities ascertained to exist in the\r\nlatter case are all that will be required in the present sections.\r\n\r\nNitric acid is not less powerful as a corrosive and irritant than\r\nsulphuric acid. It will act with energy as an irritant even when\r\nconsiderably diluted, for example with six or eight parts of water or\r\neven more.—The lips which are rendered at first whitish by all the\r\nacids, and eventually brownish by sulphuric acid, becomes soon yellow\r\nwith nitric acid. The tongue too sometimes acquires a yellow colour\r\ninstead of a white glazed appearance; but this character is not\r\ninvariable.—All spots caused by it on the skin become speedily yellow,\r\nand long retain this hue; or if the tint become dull, which generally\r\nhappens in a few days, it is enlivened and the yellow colour restored\r\nfor a time, by ammonia, potash, soda, or soap.—An important fact, for\r\nwhich toxicology is indebted to Professor Orfila, is that the acid may\r\nbe often found in the urine, both when it had been swallowed, and when\r\nit had been introduced through the medium of the cellular tissue.[311]\r\nIt is to be discovered by the process for compound mixtures. Orfila adds\r\nthat he has hitherto been unable to find it in the liver or spleen.\r\n\r\nA difference of tint in the lining membrane of the mouth and gullet is\r\nthe only difference observed in the morbid appearances caused by nitric\r\nand sulphuric acid. The former sometimes renders these parts yellow; but\r\nthis appearance is far from being invariable.\r\n\r\nThe treatment in both instances is the same in every respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n               III.—OF POISONING WITH HYDROCHLORIC ACID.\r\n\r\nThis acid occurs more rarely than any of the other mineral acids in\r\nmedico-legal cases; a fact which appears singular enough on considering,\r\nthat it is a powerful corrosive, and more perhaps in the hands of the\r\nworking-classes than any other.\r\n\r\n\r\n            SECTION I.—_Of the Tests for Hydrochloric Acid._\r\n\r\nLike the other acids, hydrochloric acid occurs in the concentrated\r\nshape, in a state of simple dilution, and mixed with various matters,\r\nespecially from organic kingdoms.\r\n\r\n1. Hydrochloric acid, _in its concentrated state_, is colourless, if\r\npure, but yellowish as usually sold; and it is easily known by the\r\npeculiar appearance and odour of its fumes. A convenient additional\r\ntest, which, however, is not absolutely distinctive, is the formation of\r\nwhite vapour when a rod dipped in it is brought near another dipped in\r\nammonia. If any farther evidence be desired, the strong acid must be\r\ndiluted with water, and examined by the tests for it in a diluted state.\r\n\r\n2. _When diluted_, it is recognised with facility, first by\r\nlitmus-paper, and then by the nitrate of silver, which forms with it a\r\ndense, white precipitate, the chloride of silver. This is soluble in\r\nammonia, reappears on neutralizing the ammonia by nitric acid, and is\r\nnot redissolved by a large excess of nitric acid, even aided by heat.\r\nIts permanence under an excess of nitric acid distinguishes it from\r\nevery other silver salt, but the cyanide; which again is known by\r\ndisappearing when boiled with a large excess of the acid.\r\n\r\n3. In the last edition of this work I proposed for the detection of\r\nhydrochloric acid in _compound organic mixtures_ a process, to which\r\nProfessor Orfila has since made an important addition,[312] and which\r\nthe investigations of that toxicologist, as well as my own, lead me to\r\nsuppose superior to any other yet suggested, although it is not entirely\r\nfree from objection. This process divides itself into two, according as\r\nthe subject of analysis is acid or neutral; but in the latter case its\r\nindications are of dubious import.\r\n\r\na. If the matter to be examined be acid, boil it with water if\r\nnecessary, filter, and distil it with a gentle heat till the residue\r\nacquire the consistence of a very thin syrup. Subject the distilled\r\nliquor to the tests for diluted hydrochloric acid. It will seldom be\r\nfound there, however, because it is apt to be retained by the\r\nco-existence of organic matter. If it be not found, add to the thin\r\nextract in the retort a slight excess of a strong solution of tannin,\r\nfilter, and distil the filtered liquid by means of a hot bath of\r\nsolution of hydrochlorate of lime (consisting of two parts of\r\ncrystallized salt and one of water,)—taking care that the temperature of\r\nthe bath never exceeds 240°; and stop the distillation just before the\r\nresiduum becomes dry. Examine now the distilled liquor with the tests\r\nfor diluted hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nHydrochloric acid has a tendency to adhere with obstinacy to organic\r\nmatters, especially when these are abundant; and therefore Orfila\r\nproperly proposes to remove organic principles as far as possible by\r\nprecipitating them with solution of tannin. I have found, as he did,\r\nthat the acid may be obtained by distillation after this measure, when\r\nit could not be obtained previously.—Orfila objects to the process\r\nhowever that hydrochlorate of ammonia will pass over in the\r\ndistillation. But I have not found this to be the fact, when the\r\ntemperature did not rise above 240°; which in his experiments seem to\r\nhave been considerably exceeded.—A more important fallacy is, that\r\nhydrochloric acid will be indicated by the process in a mixture which\r\ncontains both a neutral chloride, such as common salt, and sulphuric\r\nacid. This fallacy can only be obviated by ascertaining that sulphuric\r\nacid is not present.—But the most important fallacy of all is, that free\r\nhydrochloric acid constitutes an essential part of the gastric juice,\r\nand an ingredient of the secretions of the stomach in various states of\r\ndisordered digestion.[313] It is not easy to see how this fallacy can be\r\nobviated, unless the acid be obtained in large quantity; nor am I\r\nprepared to say what quantity would justify the conclusion, that the\r\nacid had been derived from an external source. Dr. Prout once found\r\nbetween four and five grains of pure acid in sixteen ounces of the fluid\r\nof water-brash.[314] The quantity of hydrochloric acid is to be known by\r\ndrying, heating and weighing the chloride of silver thrown down in the\r\ndistilled fluid by nitrate of silver, and allowing 100 parts of\r\nconcentrated commercial acid for 145 of chloride.\r\n\r\nb. When the mixture is neutral, hydrochloric acid can be no longer\r\ndetected in it without the aid of sulphuric acid to decompose the\r\nchloride that has been formed. This should be added to the filtered\r\nfluid obtained after organic matter has been separated by solution of\r\ntannin. Hydrochloric acid will then distil over.—It is seldom however\r\nthat the discovery of the acid in this way will warrant the conclusion,\r\nthat it had ever existed free in the mixture whence it is obtained. For\r\nit may have proceeded from chlorides contained in the subject of\r\nanalysis from the first, more especially chloride of sodium, which\r\nexists in small quantity in all animal fluids and solids, and more\r\nlargely in many articles of food and drink. The only circumstance indeed\r\nin which the detection of hydrochloric acid by decomposition with\r\nsulphuric acid will yield any evidence,—and even then the evidence will\r\nonly be presumptive,—is when it is known that an earth or alkali was\r\ngiven as an antidote, and when the alkali or earth which was used is\r\nfound in the suspected substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—_Of the Action and Symptoms produced by Hydrochloric Acid._\r\n\r\nHydrochloric acid has been found by Professor Orfila to exert the same\r\naction as sulphuric and nitric acids; but it is a less powerful\r\ncorrosive and irritant.—In the gaseous state, it is a most destructive\r\npoison to vegetables, as will be shown in the article on the Poisonous\r\nGases.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms it occasions in man are very like those produced by\r\nsulphuric acid. As few cases however of poisoning with this substance\r\nhave yet been published, its effects are not so well known as those of\r\nthe other powerful acids; and it may therefore be right to mention the\r\nleading particulars of some of the cases which are met with in\r\nauthors.—Mr. Quekett has related the case of a man, who, on arriving at\r\nhome one day, told the woman he lodged with that he had poisoned himself\r\nwith spirit of salt, but presented at the moment so little sign of\r\nuneasiness, that she at first scarcely believed him. In a short time\r\nhowever he suddenly became faint and fell down. On being removed to the\r\nLondon Hospital, magnesia and milk were given, about three hours after\r\nthe acid had been taken; but no relief was experienced. He suffered\r\nintense thirst, complained of excessive pain in the stomach and throat,\r\nand expired in about fifteen hours.[315]—Mr. J. F. Crawfurd of Newcastle\r\nhas related a still more rapid case which was occasioned by two ounces\r\nof an equal mixture of hydrochloric acid and “tincture of steel,”\r\nprobably the tincture of chloride of iron. Vomiting occurred soon\r\nafterwards, but subsequently ceased; there was no complaint made either\r\nof pain or heat anywhere, or of thirst; and questions were answered\r\nintelligently. But the pulse was imperceptible, and the muscles of the\r\nextremities contracted; and death took place in five hours and a\r\nhalf.[316]—Orfila mentions that an hospital patient, affected with\r\ninflammation of the brain after a fall on the head, having got by\r\nmistake from his nurse 45 grammes, or two fluid ounces, of hydrochloric\r\nacid, was attacked with acute pain in the stomach, efforts to vomit,\r\nhiccup, extreme restlessness, a small pulse, a fiery red tongue,\r\nblackness of the lips, and a burning skin; and next day he died in a\r\nstate of constant delirium, and covered with a cold clammy sweat.[317]\r\n\r\nThese cases present nearly the same violence and variety of action with\r\nthat which results from the two other acids.\r\n\r\n\r\n SECTION III.—_Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Hydrochloric Acid._\r\n\r\nThe morbid appearances are on the whole similar to what are caused by\r\nsulphuric acid. In Mr. Quekett’s case the stomach outwardly was\r\nleaden-coloured and its vessels gorged with black blood; the intestinal\r\nperitonæum injected and speckled with fibrinous effusion; the villous\r\ncoat of the stomach lined with yellow, curdled milk, and itself\r\nirregularly black here and there, as if charred, and in some places\r\nsoftened and corroded, so that a rent was made in handling it; the inner\r\nmembrane of the duodenum similarly affected, and also even the jejunum,\r\nthough more irregularly. The contents of the stomach were not acid, and\r\ndid not contain any chloride.—In Mr. Crawfurd’s case the villous coat\r\npresented black elevated ridges, as if charred, and the furrows between\r\nwere scarlet-red; black granular extravasation had taken place at many\r\npoints into the submucous tissue; similar appearances were seen in the\r\nduodenum and jejunum; and the lower part of the gullet looked as if it\r\nhad been cauterized.—In the case related by Orfila the gullet and\r\npharynx were red, and at one or two places excoriated; the stomach\r\ninflamed externally, and its inner membrane spotted with gangrenous (?)\r\npatches, and very brittle; the duodenum thickened, and the jejunum\r\nperforated by a round worm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n ON POISONING WITH PHOSPHORUS AND THE OTHER BASES OF THE MINERAL ACIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Phosphorus_.—The only other mineral acid that\r\ndeserves mention is the phosphoric. It possesses properties nearly\r\nanalogous, and hardly inferior to those of the three acids already\r\nmentioned. On its own account, however, it does not merit any notice\r\nhere, since it is much too rare to be within reach of a person who\r\nintends to give or take poison. But it must be attended to, because it\r\nis formed in the course of the action of a more common poison,\r\nphosphorus. An attempt has actually been made to perpetrate murder by\r\nmeans of this substance. A woman at Mengshausen tried to poison her\r\nhusband by putting into his soup a mixture of phosphorus, flour, and\r\nsugar, used for poisoning rats. But the soup having been kept warm on\r\nthe stove, the man’s suspicions were excited by its phosphorescence, and\r\nphosphorus was detected in it.[318]\r\n\r\nOrfila found that two drachms of phosphorus given to dogs in fragments\r\ncaused death in twenty-one hours, that the whole stomach and intestines\r\nwere more or less inflamed, and that the phosphorus had lost much of its\r\nweight, though vomiting had been prevented by a ligature on the gullet;\r\nin fact the poison was partly oxidated. In a state of minute division,\r\nas when dissolved in oil, twenty-four grains caused death in less than\r\nfive hours with all the symptoms of the most acute irritant poisoning;\r\nand after death the stomach was found extensively corroded, and\r\nperforated by two holes.[319] Other experimentalists have found that\r\nhalf a grain melted in hot water could kill a dog;[320] and that water,\r\nin which phosphorus had been simply received in the process for\r\npreparing it, proved in small quantities fatal to poultry.[321]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, therefore, that phosphorus is a dangerous poison to\r\nanimals. Its effects on man have not been often witnessed; but the\r\nobservations hitherto made will show that it is not less injurious to\r\nhim than to the lower animals. A grain and a half have actually proved\r\nfatal to man, as appears from a case mentioned by M. Worbe.[322] The\r\nsubject of the case was a stout young man who took a grain and a half in\r\nhot water, after having previously taken half a grain without sustaining\r\ninjury. In seven hours, and not till then, he was attacked with pain in\r\nthe stomach and bowels, then with incessant vomiting and diarrhœa,\r\nexcessive tenderness and tension of the belly,—all the symptoms in short\r\nof irritant poisoning; and he died exhausted in twelve days. Another\r\nfatal case somewhat similar in its circumstances has been related by M.\r\nJulia-Fontenelle.[323] An apothecary, after taking in one day first a\r\nsingle grain and then two grains of phosphorus without experiencing any\r\nparticular effects, swallowed next day three grains at once in syrup. In\r\nthe evening he felt generally uneasy, from a sense of pressure in the\r\nbelly, which continued for three days; and then he was also seized with\r\nviolent, continual vomiting of a matter which had an alliaceous odour.\r\nOn the seventh day he had also spasms, delirium, and palsy of the left\r\nhand; and death speedily ensued.—Dr. Maier of Ulm relates a singular\r\ncase occasioned by a portion of lucifer-match composition having been\r\nswallowed intentionally. Vomiting and pain in the belly ensued, then\r\nanxiety, restlessness, and excessive thirst, and death in about fifteen\r\nhours.[324]—M. Martin-Solon relates the case of a patient, affected with\r\nlead palsy, who having taken considerably less than a grain in the form\r\nof emulsion, was attacked with burning along the gullet and in the\r\nstomach, mucous vomiting, tenderness of the belly, general coldness and\r\nfeebleness of the pulse. Afterwards the pulse became imperceptible, the\r\nlimbs neuralgic, the intellect clouded, and the breathing stertorous;\r\nand he died in little more than two days.[325]—In the only other case I\r\nhave hitherto found recorded death took place in forty hours, and the\r\nsymptoms were violent pain in the stomach and continual vomiting,\r\ntogether with the discharge by clysters of small fragments of\r\nphosphorus, which were discovered by their shining in the dark, and\r\nsubsequently by the appearance of burnt spots on the bed-linen. In this\r\ncase, which is described by Dr. Flachsland of Carlsruhe,[326] the\r\nquantity of the poison taken was not ascertained. The patient, a young\r\nman, took it on bread and butter at the recommendation of a quack, to\r\ncure constipation, general debility, and impotence.\r\n\r\nAt one time it was the custom to give small doses of phosphorus in\r\nmedical practice; but the uncertainty and occasional severity of its\r\noperation have perhaps properly expelled it from most modern\r\npharmacopœias. Among other properties ascribed to it in medicinal doses,\r\nit is said to be a powerful aphrodisiac: No such symptom occurred in the\r\nfirst of the fatal cases just related, or is mentioned in any of the\r\nothers; but there is no doubt that medicinal doses sometimes produce it.\r\n\r\nAs to the morbid appearances, the same changes of structure may be\r\nexpected as in the instance of the mineral acids generally. In Worbe’s\r\ncase quoted above, the skin was generally yellow, and here and there\r\nlivid; the lungs gorged with blood; the muscular coat of the stomach\r\ninflamed, but the other coats not, except near the two extremities of\r\nthe organ, where they were black. In Flachsland’s case much fluid blood\r\nwas discharged from the first incisions through the skin of the belly;\r\nthe omentum and outside of the stomach and intestines were red; the\r\nvillous coat of the stomach presented an appearance of gangrenous\r\ninflammation (probably black extravasation only); the inner membrane of\r\nthe duodenum was similarly affected; the great intestines were\r\ncontracted to the size of the little finger; the mesenteric glands\r\nenlarged; and the kidneys and spleen inflamed. In Maier’s case the\r\nperitonæum and omentum were dry and vascular, the stomach and small\r\nintestines pale, the great intestines contracted, almost empty,\r\nbrownish-red, and here and there inflamed, the liver large, and the\r\nblood everywhere liquid. The contents of the caput cœcum had an odour of\r\nphosphorus, and here were found two yellowish lumps weighing eight\r\ngrains, which shone when rubbed, exhaled a phosphoric odour, and\r\ncontained 0·6 of a grain of phosphorus. In Martin-Solon’s case the\r\ngullet was cherry-red and its epithelian brittle, the villous coat of\r\nthe stomach grayish and brittle, the solid viscera in the abdomen soft,\r\nand the cerebral membranes congested.\r\n\r\n_Phosphorous acid_, the effects of which have been examined\r\nexperimentally by Professor Hünefeld of Greifswalde, differs in its\r\noperation from phosphoric acid. Twenty-five grains had no effect on a\r\nrabbit; but a drachm caused difficult breathing, restlessness, bloody\r\nvomiting, slight convulsions, and death in twelve hours; and the stomach\r\nwas found not much injured. The urine contained phosphoric acid.[327]\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Sulphur._—It does not appear that sulphur, which\r\nresembles phosphorus in many particulars, bears any resemblance to it in\r\nphysiological properties;—which may be ascribed to its not being\r\nsusceptible of spontaneous acidification. It certainly possesses,\r\nhowever, slight irritating properties. It is often given as a purgative,\r\nwhich is sufficient to prove that it is not altogether inert; and the\r\nveterinary school at Lyons found that a pound killed horses by producing\r\nviolent inflammation, recognizable during life by the symptoms, and\r\nafter death by the morbid appearances.[328]\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Chlorine._—Chlorine in its gaseous state acts\r\npowerfully as an irritant on the windpipe and lungs, and on that account\r\nwill be noticed under the head of the poisonous gases. But even in\r\nsolution it retains to a certain degree its poisonous qualities. Orfila\r\nsays that five ounces of a strong solution of chlorine will kill a dog\r\nin twenty-four hours, if it is kept in the stomach by a ligature, and\r\nthat two ounces diluted with twice its volume of water will prove fatal\r\nin four days;—that the symptoms are those of irritation of the\r\nstomach;—and that in the former case he found general redness and\r\nblackness—in the latter ulceration of its villous coat.[329]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       OF POISONING WITH IODINE.\r\n\r\nIodine is a poison of more consequence than chlorine, both because it is\r\nbecoming a more common article, and because it is more violent in its\r\neffects on the animal economy.\r\n\r\n_Tests of Iodine._—Iodine when pure is a solid substance easily known by\r\nits scaly form, its resemblance in colour and resplendence to polished\r\niron, its peculiar odour, the violet fumes it forms when heated, and the\r\nfine blue colour it produces with a solution of starch. It is very\r\nsparingly soluble in water, but readily so in rectified spirit and in\r\naqueous solutions of certain salts, more especially the iodide of\r\npotassium. Its ordinary forms in the shops are iodine itself, the\r\ntincture, and the compound solution, where the solvent is a solution of\r\niodide of potassium in water. It stains the skin brownish-yellow; but\r\nthe stain is not permanent. Its fumes are intensely irritating to the\r\nnostrils, throat, and lungs.\r\n\r\nWhen dissolved in water or in solutions of neutral salts, it\r\ncommunicates to the fluid a yellowish-brown or reddish-brown colour,\r\nwhich is destroyed by sulphuretted hydrogen, because the iodine is\r\nconverted into hydriodic acid. In the colourless fluid thus formed, if\r\ntreated with chlorine,—or in the original brown fluid without\r\nchlorine,—a solution of starch, obtained by ebullition and subsequently\r\ncooled, produces a fine blue colour and precipitate; and these, if the\r\nsolution be sufficiently diluted, disappear on boiling, reappear on\r\nsudden cooling, and are removed permanently by a stream of sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen. This is a very delicate and characteristic system of tests.\r\nThe best mode of using chlorine for decomposing hydriodic acid is to let\r\nit descend in the gaseous form from the mouth of a bottle of\r\nnitro-hydrochloric acid upon the fluid to be examined; In this way an\r\nexcess is easily avoided, which bleaches out the blue colour. Sulphuric\r\nacid, though often recommended for the purpose, does not act unless it\r\ncontains nitrous acid,—from which however the sulphuric acid of commerce\r\nis seldom quite free.\r\n\r\nWhen mingled with organic substances, the discovery of it is a matter of\r\nsome nicety; because many substances of this nature, especially in the\r\nliving body, quickly convert it into hydriodic acid.[330] Hence few\r\ncases can occur in medico-legal practice, where iodine will be\r\ndiscoverable in its free state. The following method of analysis will\r\nmeet all possible cases.\r\n\r\n_Process for Compound Mixtures._—Add water if necessary, and filter. If\r\neither the fluid or solid part is little or not at all coloured, test it\r\nwith cold solution of starch, assisting the action of the test on the\r\nsolid part by trituration in a mortar. If a blue colour be struck, which\r\ndisappears under ebullition, and reappears under refrigeration alone, or\r\non subsequently allowing chlorine gas to descend on the surface of the\r\nfluid, there can be no doubt of the existence of iodine.—If the colour\r\nof the suspected mixture after filtration is so deep that the action of\r\nthe starch cannot be expected to yield characteristic appearances, then\r\nboth the solid and fluid parts should be agitated with a third of their\r\nvolume of ether; and after the ethereal solution has arisen to the\r\nsurface, it is to be removed and tested with solution of starch. The\r\nblue colour will be now perhaps struck, because the ether, in carrying\r\noff the iodine from the mixture, leaves many coloured organic principles\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nShould free iodine not be thus detected, strong presumptive evidence may\r\nstill be procured of its actual presence, or of its having been at one\r\ntime present, by continuing the examination with the view to detect\r\nhydriodic acid. This is described in p. 159.\r\n\r\nBy following this method of analysis, I have found that one grain of\r\niodine of potassium, which is equivalent to three-quarters of a grain of\r\niodine, may be easily discovered in six ounces of urine,—a fluid as\r\ncomplicated as can well be conceived.\r\n\r\nThe process adopted by Professor Orfila is so nearly the same with this,\r\nas scarcely to require being detailed. He uses nitric acid instead of\r\nchlorine for decomposing the hydriodic acid. Chlorine, however, is the\r\nmost delicate reagent for the purpose, if it be used in the way\r\ndescribed above.\r\n\r\n_Action of Iodine and Symptoms in Man._—Iodide has a twofold action, one\r\nlocal and irritating, the other general, and produced only when it has\r\nbeen administered long in frequent small doses.\r\n\r\nOrfila remarked that in doses of two drachms it excited in dogs symptoms\r\nof irritation in the stomach; that death slowly ensued in seven days,\r\nwithout the symptoms having ever become very violent; and that the\r\nvillous coat of the stomach was here and there yellow, had also patches\r\nof yellow mucus lining it, and exhibited numerous little ulcers of a\r\nyellow colour. He could not observe much injury from iodine introduced\r\ninto the cellular tissue; and more lately, Dr. Cogswell remarked that in\r\nthis way it merely induces phlegmonous inflammation and the usual\r\nconsequences.[331]\r\n\r\nAn important circumstance in regard to the physiology and medical\r\njurisprudence of this poison and its compounds is, that it may\r\nundoubtedly be detected in the blood, both when a single large dose has\r\nbeen taken, and in those persons who have used it for some time\r\nmedicinally. Cantu, an Italian experimentalist, discovered iodine in\r\nsuch circumstances in the blood, sweat, urine, saliva and milk;[332] and\r\nBennerscheidt, a German chemist, also found it in the blood, when it had\r\nbeen employed outwardly.[333] In the latter instance it could not be\r\ndetected in the serum, but it was detected in the crassamentum by means\r\nof starch. Some interesting facts of the same nature have also been\r\nascertained by Dr. O’Shaughnessey, from which it appears that even in\r\nacute poisoning with this substance, satisfactory proof of its\r\nadministration may be procured several days afterwards by analysing\r\ncertain secretions. In a dog poisoned with iodine, he detected the\r\npoison in forty minutes in the urine, and occasionally in the same\r\nsecretion so late as the fifth day, when it died. It is singular,\r\nhowever, that he could not find it in the same quarter on the third day,\r\nalthough it existed at that time abundantly in the saliva.[334] In these\r\nexperiments the iodine was always found in the form of hydriodic acid,\r\nhaving been converted into that compound in the alimentary canal. This\r\nchange takes place with such rapidity, that on one occasion, in the\r\nvomited matter discharged by a dog fifteen minutes only after the\r\nadministration of iodine, Dr. O’Shaughnessey could find no iodine, but a\r\nlarge quantity of hydriodic acid.[335] Orfila has found it not only in\r\nthe urine, but likewise in the liver of animals.[336]\r\n\r\nConsiderable uncertainty prevails as to the circumstances in which we\r\nmay expect iodine to be detected in the organs or secretions of persons\r\nwho have taken it. Thus it has been stated by an Italian physician, Dr.\r\nCristin, that in many individuals affected with dropsy, struma,\r\nepilepsy, and other diseases, he had sought for iodine to no purpose in\r\nthe urine, bronchial mucus, and other excretory fluids.[337]\r\n\r\nWith regard to its operation on man, Orfila says, he has tried the\r\neffects of four or six grains on himself, and that he found this dose\r\nproduce a sense of constriction in the throat, sickness, pain in the\r\nstomach, and at length vomiting and colic. There is no doubt, therefore,\r\nthat in larger doses it will prove a dangerous irritant to man as well\r\nas to dogs. Accordingly, Dr. Gairdner has noticed the case of a child\r\nfour years old, who died in a few hours after taking about a scruple in\r\nthe form of tincture;[338] but he has not mentioned the symptoms. Dr.\r\nJahn of Meiningen mentions a case where an over-dose produced violent\r\npain in the belly, vomiting, profuse bloody diarrhœa, coldness and\r\nblanching of the skin, rigors, quivering of the sight and rapid\r\npulse.[339] Two similar cases are related in a recent French journal; in\r\none, which was produced by a drachm and a half of the ioduretted\r\nsolution of hydriodate of potass, nausea, with acute pain and sense of\r\nburning in the pit of the stomach, followed immediately; in an hour\r\nthere was vomiting of a yellowish matter which had the taste of iodine;\r\nexcessive restlessness ensued, with headache, giddiness and paleness of\r\nthe countenance; and these symptoms were not entirely dissipated for\r\nfive days.[340] In the other case two drachms and a half of iodine were\r\nswallowed for the purpose of self-destruction. A sense of dryness and\r\nburning from the throat down to the stomach was immediately produced;\r\nlacerating pain in the stomach and fruitless efforts to vomit succeeded;\r\nand in an hour, when the relater of the case first saw the patient,\r\nthere was suffusion of the eyes, excessive pain and tenderness of the\r\nepigastrium, and sinking of the pulse. Vomiting, however, was then\r\nbrought on by warm water; copious yellow discharges, possessing the\r\nsmell and taste of iodine, took place; and in nine hours the patient was\r\nwell.[341]\r\n\r\nThere is a singular uncertainty, however, in the action of one or more\r\nlarge doses. Magendie says he has taken two drachms of the tincture,\r\ncontaining about ten grains of iodine, without injury;[342] Dr. Gully,\r\nthat he has given three times as much daily for some time; Dr. Kennedy,\r\nthat he gave an average of twelve grains daily in the form of tincture\r\nfor eighty days without observing any effect at all; and Mr. Delisser,\r\nthat he has given a patient thirty grains in a day without injury.[343]\r\nDr. Samuel Wright met with the case of an infant, not more than three\r\nyears old, who took three drachms of the tincture at once, and suffered\r\nonly from attempts to cough, some retching and much thirst.[344]\r\n\r\nIt further appears that in medicinal doses, such as a quarter of a\r\ngrain, frequently repeated, it is a dangerous poison, unless its effects\r\nare carefully watched. For in consequence of accumulation in the system,\r\nor gradually increasing action, it produces when long used some very\r\nsingular and hazardous symptoms; and like mercury, foxglove, and some\r\nother poisons, it may be taken long without effect, and at length begin\r\nto operate suddenly. The symptoms which it then occasions are sometimes\r\nthose of irritation; namely, incessant vomiting and purging, acute pain\r\nin the stomach, loaded tongue, rapid and extreme emaciation, violent\r\ncramps and small frequent pulse. These symptoms may continue many days,\r\nand even when subdued to a certain extent, vomiting and cramps are apt\r\nto recur for months after.[345] A fatal case of this form of affection\r\nhas been related by M. Zink, a Swiss physician. His patient, after\r\ntaking too large doses of iodine for about a month, was seized with\r\nrestlessness, burning heat of skin, tremors, palpitation, syncope,\r\nexcessive thirst, a sense of burning along the gullet, frequent purging\r\nof bilious and black stools, priapism, and tremulous pulse. The symptoms\r\nof local inflammation went off in a few days; but those of general fever\r\ncontinued; and he died after six weeks’ illness.[346] Another fatal case\r\nhas been described in Rust’s Journal. The leading symptoms were pain in\r\nthe region of the liver, loss of appetite, emaciation, quartan fever,\r\ndiarrhœa, excessive weakness; and after the emaciation was far advanced\r\na hardened liver could be felt. The patient appears to have died of\r\nexhaustion.[347] From this case, and another of which the appearances\r\nafter death will be presently noticed, it is not improbable that iodine\r\npossesses the power of inflaming the liver.\r\n\r\nIn another and more common affection, the patient is attacked with\r\ntremors, at first slight and confined to the fingers, afterwards violent\r\nand extending to the whole muscles of the arms and even of the trunk. At\r\nthe same time there is excessive and rapidly increasing weakness, a\r\nsense of anxiety and sinking, a total suspension of the function of\r\ndigestion, rapid and extreme muscular emaciation, tendency to fainting,\r\nand violent continued palpitation,[348] accompanied sometimes with\r\nabsorption of the testicles in man, and of the mammæ in females. In the\r\nmidst of these phenomena the curative powers of the poison over the\r\ndisease for which it has chiefly been used, namely, goître, are\r\ndeveloped. It has been remarked in particular, that the diminution of\r\nthe goître keeps pace with the diminution of the breasts, though at\r\ntimes either effect has been developed without the other. An instance is\r\nrelated in Rust’s Journal of a female, whose breasts began to sink after\r\nshe had used iodine for four months; and in four weeks hardly a vestige\r\nof them remained; but her goître was not affected.[349] An American\r\nphysician, Dr. Rivers, has twice noticed barrenness apparently induced\r\nby the prolonged use of iodine; and as in these instances the females\r\nwere young and previously very prolific, but ceased to bear children\r\nfrom the time the iodine was used, his observations seem worthy of\r\nattention.[350] Dr. Jahn[351] specifies among the leading effects of the\r\npoison when slowly accumulated in the body,—absorption of the\r\nfat,—increase of all the excretions,—dinginess of the skin, with\r\nfrequent clammy sweat,—hurried anxious breathing,—diuresis and an\r\nappearance of oil floating in the urine,—increased discharge of fæces,\r\nwhich are unusually bilious, but free of mucus,—increased secretion of\r\nsemen,—increased menstrual discharge,—swelling of the subcutaneous veins\r\nand lividity of the lips,—feebleness of the pulse, with superabundance\r\nof serosity in the blood,—impaired digestion and diminished secretion of\r\nsaliva and mucus. This affection, which, in conformity with the name he\r\nhas given it, may be termed Iodism [_Iodkrankheit_], he contrasts with\r\nmercurialism, the constitutional effect of the accumulation of mercury\r\nin the body; and he considers the former not more unmanageable than the\r\nlatter. The dose required to produce these effects are very various.\r\nSome people appear almost insensible to its action; in one instance,\r\nnine hundred and fifty-three grains were taken in daily portions varying\r\nfrom two to eighteen grains, without any bad effect;[352] and I have\r\nknown an average of four grains daily taken for fifteen months, with the\r\neffect only of increasing the appetite. On the other hand, Dr. Gairdner\r\nhas seen severe symptoms commence when half a grain was taken three\r\ntimes a day for a single week;[353] and Coindet has seen bad effects\r\nfrom thirty drops of the solution of ioduretted hydriodate taken daily\r\nfor five days.[354]\r\n\r\nIodine and iodide of potassium in medicinal doses have been supposed by\r\nDr. Lawrie to be capable of exciting in certain constitutions an\r\naffection resembling _cynanche laryngea_ in its symptoms, consisting of\r\ninflammation of the salivary glands, glottis, and other adjacent parts,\r\nand proving sometimes fatal.[355] This property is doubtful; but several\r\ninstances have been published of profuse salivation and soreness of the\r\nmouth during a course of iodine; it is apt to cause chronic irritation\r\nof the Schneiderian membrane; and some think that it may affect in like\r\nmanner the bronchial membrane in the lungs.[356]\r\n\r\n_Morbid Appearances from Iodine._—The only account I have seen of the\r\nappearances left in the body after death from slow poisoning with iodine\r\nis contained in the essay of Dr. Zink. In a second fatal case which came\r\nunder his notice he found enlarged abdomen from distension of the\r\nintestines with gases, enlargement of the other viscera and serous\r\neffusion into the peritonæum; adhesion of the viscera to one another;\r\nredness of the intestines, in some places approaching to gangrenous\r\ndiscoloration; redness and excoriation of the peritonæal coat of the\r\nstomach, and also of its villous coat; enlargement and pale rose-red\r\ncoloration of the liver. In the chest serum was found in the sac of the\r\npleura. The gullet was contracted in diameter, and red internally.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 ON POISONING WITH IODIDE OF POTASSIUM.\r\n\r\nTo these remarks on iodine a few observations may be added on the iodide\r\nof potassium, one of its compounds, which is now generally substituted\r\nin medicine for the simple substance. The tests and actions of this\r\npoison have been examined by M. Devergie; and more lately its\r\nmedico-legal chemistry has been investigated by Dr. O’Shaughnessey and\r\nProfessor Orfila.\r\n\r\nIt is sold in the shops of various degrees of purity. Pure iodide of\r\npotassium is in white crystals, tending to the cubical form, permanent\r\nin the air, possessing a faint peculiar odour, and easily soluble in\r\nboth water and rectified spirit. Another variety has the same form, but\r\npossesses an odour of iodine, is often yellowish in colour, and\r\ndeliquesces slightly in moist air. This contains an excess of iodine,\r\nbut may be otherwise pure. A third variety is impure. It presents less\r\ntendency to assume a crystalline form, is more or less deliquescent,\r\ndissolves but partially in alcohol, and when dissolved effervesces with\r\nacids. The principal ingredient in this article is carbonate of potass;\r\nand sometimes the proportion of iodide is inconsiderable. In one\r\nspecimen I procured 74·5 per cent. of carbonate of potass, 16 of water,\r\nand only 9·5 of iodide of potassium.\r\n\r\nIn the solid state the iodide of potassium may be known by the effect of\r\nstrong sulphuric or nitric acid, which turns it brown with\r\neffervescence, and when aided by heat disengages violet fumes of iodine.\r\n\r\nIn solution many tests will detect it, such as chlorine, nitric acid,\r\ncorrosive sublimate, acetate of lead, protonitrate of mercury, muriate\r\nof platinum, and starch with chlorine or nitric acid. Chlorine or nitric\r\nacid forms a brown or orange-coloured solution by disengaging iodine.\r\nCorrosive sublimate forms a fine carmine-red precipitate, the biniodide\r\nof mercury; acetate of lead a fine yellow precipitate, the iodide of\r\nlead; protonitrate of mercury a yellow protiodide of mercury, which\r\ngradually fades into a dirty brown. Solution of starch, followed by\r\nchlorine in solution or in vapour, strikes a deep blue colour, which, if\r\nthe fluid is sufficiently diluted, disappears on boiling, reappears on\r\nsudden cooling, and is permanently removed by a stream of sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen gases. Of these tests the most characteristic is starch with\r\nchlorine; and it is also extremely delicate. Too much chlorine however\r\nbleaches the blue colour away.\r\n\r\nIn compound mixtures most and sometimes all of these tests are useless.\r\nIf the mixture is deeply coloured, none will act characteristically. If\r\ncarbonate of potass be present in such proportion as is often met with\r\nin the shops, the tests cannot be trusted to.\r\n\r\n_Process for Compound Mixtures._—The following method of analysis is\r\napplicable to all mixtures, organic and inorganic. Add water, if\r\nnecessary, and filter; and if the fluid which passes through is\r\ntolerably free from colour, test a little of it with solution of starch\r\nand chlorine. If the colour is too deep to admit of this trial, or the\r\ntest on trial does not act, unite the fluid and solid parts and transmit\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen to convert any free iodine into hydriodic acid.\r\nDrive off the excess of gas, supersaturate with a considerable excess of\r\npotass, filter, and evaporate to dryness. Char the residue at a low red\r\nheat in a covered crucible; pulverize the charcoaly mass, and exhaust\r\nwith water. This solution will probably act characteristically with\r\nstarch and chlorine; but on the whole it is better in the first instance\r\nto remove some of the salts by evaporating to dryness, and exhausting\r\nthe residuum with alcohol. The alcoholic solution contains the\r\nhydriodate of potass, with some other salts; and on being evaporated to\r\ndryness, a residuum is left, on which, when dissolved in water, the\r\nstarch and chlorine will act characteristically. No other test is\r\nnecessary; and frequently no other test will act, on account of\r\nco-existing salts.\r\n\r\nI have found that a grain of iodide of potassium may thus be easily\r\ndetected in six ounces of urine, which must be considered a very\r\ncomplicated fluid. In the solution ultimately procured nitrous acid\r\nstruck a pale brown tint, and on the addition of solution of starch a\r\ndark-blue precipitate was formed; which, after being sufficiently\r\ndiluted, disappeared under ebullition, leaving a colourless fluid. On\r\ncooling, no change took place; but on the subsequent addition of a drop\r\nof sulphuric acid, the blue colour and precipitation were immediately\r\nrestored. No other reagent acted characteristically, although there was\r\na sufficient quantity of solution to try the starch test ten times at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nDr. O’Shaughnessey has proposed a more complex method by precipitation\r\nwith chloride of platinum.[357] Professor Orfila says it is sufficient\r\nto boil and filter the suspected matter, and to heat first the liquid\r\nand then the solid part with solution of chloride, when violet vapours\r\nof iodine are disengaged, which may be condensed and subjected to\r\nvarious tests.[358] I have not compared this method with the one I have\r\nbeen in the practice of using; but, notwithstanding the strong\r\nassurances of its proposer, its superiority in point of delicacy seems\r\ndubious, although no one can deny its simplicity.[359]\r\n\r\n_Action and Symptoms in Man._—From the experiments of Devergie on\r\nanimals, iodide of potassium seems to be in large doses an irritant,\r\nthough not a powerful one. Two drachms in an ounce of water killed a dog\r\nin three days with violent vomiting, and signs of irritation were found\r\nin the stomach, namely, black extravasated spots and ulcers in the\r\nmiddle of them. A solution injected into the cellular tissue caused only\r\nlocal inflammation. Injected into the jugular vein in the dose of four\r\ngrains, it produced tetanus and death in a minute and a half.[360] The\r\nlatter investigations of Dr. Cogswell confirm essentially these results.\r\n\r\nDiscrepant accounts have been given of the effects of iodide of\r\npotassium on man. When first introduced into medicine, it was conceived\r\nto be an active poison, not much inferior to iodine itself. Many however\r\nhave since had an opportunity of observing that it is in general by no\r\nmeans so energetic. Its medicinal doses were gradually raised from one\r\ngrain to five, ten, twenty grains; and at last Dr. Elliotson gave to not\r\na few patients so much as two, four, or even six drachms daily in\r\ndivided doses, without observing any remarkable effect.[361] These and\r\nother similar observations however were made at a period when the salt\r\nused in British practice was much adulterated, often indeed containing\r\neighty or ninety per cent. of impurity; at the same time it does appear\r\nthat large doses of a pure salt have been occasionally taken with\r\nimpunity. On the other hand it has evidently in some instances acted\r\nwith great force. Mr. Alfred Taylor mentions a case, on the authority of\r\nMr. Ericksen, where five grains produced alarming dyspnœa, attended with\r\ninflammation of the nostrils and conjunctiva of the eyes.[362] An\r\ninstance has been published where twelve grains in four doses occasioned\r\nshivering, vomiting, purging, general fever, and extreme prostration;\r\nand the purging continued for some days.[363] Dr. Moore Neligan informs\r\nme he met with the case of an elderly lady in 1841, who, on taking three\r\nfive-grain doses for two days, while labouring under irregular gout, was\r\nseized with severe headache, thirst, and swelling of the face; which\r\nsymptoms were succeeded in two days by swelling of the tongue,\r\nulceration of the gums, and profuse salivation for a week. Dr. Lawrie\r\nsays he has known two grains and a half given thrice in one day,\r\nfollowed by great dyspnœa and irritation in the throat; and is even\r\ninclined to think that death resulted on two occasions from repeated\r\nmedicinal doses.[364] It would farther appear from some important\r\nresearches made in France, that the protracted use of iodide of\r\npotassium in small doses with the food may produce serious derangement\r\nof the health,—swelling of the face, headache, urgent thirst,\r\ninflammation of the throat, violent colic pains, and frequently bloody\r\ndiarrhœa. A disease characterized by the symptoms now described appeared\r\nrepeatedly as an epidemic a few years ago in various parts of France,\r\nand spread so widely in one parish, that not less than a sixth of the\r\nwhole population were attacked. After several careful investigations, it\r\nseems to have been fully proved that the affection was owing to the use\r\nof salt fraudulently adulterated with an impure salt, obtained from kelp\r\nafter the separation of carbonate of soda, and consequently impregnated\r\nwith an appreciable proportion of hydriodate of potass.[365]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to arrive at any satisfactory conclusions from these\r\nstatements as to the nature and energy of the action of this salt as a\r\npoison. But on the whole it appears to be not in general very active;\r\nand the few instances of unusual activity which have occurred may\r\nprobably be put to the account of idiosyncrasy. The most remarkable of\r\nits idiosyncratic effects from medicinal doses are salivation, and a\r\nseries of symptoms which imitate sometimes catarrh, and sometimes a cold\r\nin the head. I do not know any facts to warrant the general statement of\r\nM. Devergie that 18 or 30 grains may constitute a fatal dose.[366] The\r\npresent question is far from being unimportant in a medico-legal point\r\nof view. Mr. A. Taylor mentions the heads of a case, very dubious\r\nhowever in its nature, where it was suspected that a single dose of six\r\ngrains of iodide of potassium had been the occasion of death.[367]\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember in medico-legal researches, that iodide of\r\npotassium may be detected in the blood, liver, spleen, muscles, urine,\r\nand other textures and secretions; and especially that it may be found\r\nin the urine, when it may no longer exist in the alimentary canal or in\r\nvomited matters. These interesting facts have been clearly proved by the\r\nresearches of Wöhler,[368] Stehberger,[369] O’Shaughnessey,[370] and Dr.\r\nCogswell.[371]\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Bromine._—This singular substance is not an object of\r\nmuch interest in relation to medical jurisprudence, because it is rare,\r\nand only to be met with in the laboratory of the chemist. Hence,\r\nalthough it appears to be a poison of some activity, it scarcely\r\nrequires to be dwelt on particularly.\r\n\r\nIt is easily known from all other substances by its fluidity, its great\r\ndensity, which is thrice as great as that of water, its reddish-brown\r\ncolour by reflected, and blood-red colour by transmitted light, the\r\norange fumes which occupy the upper part of a bottle partly filled with\r\nit, and its intensely acrid suffocating vapour, which is so irritating\r\nthat an incautious inhalation is followed by all the phenomena of severe\r\ncoryza and catarrh. Its odour, however, apart from its acridity, is very\r\nfar from being so disagreeable as its discoverer in naming it seems to\r\nhave imagined. In its properties it bears a close resemblance to\r\nchlorine and iodine.\r\n\r\nThe toxicological effects and medico-legal relations of bromine have\r\nbeen examined by M. Barthez,[372] Dr. Butske,[373] Dr. Dieffenbach,[374]\r\nand Dr. M. Glover.[375]\r\n\r\nM. Barthez has given the following process for detecting bromine in\r\ncompound mixtures, such as the contents of the stomach or vomited\r\nmatter. First separate the fluid matter by filtration, and subject it to\r\nthe action of chlorine, which will produce a fine orange colour. Should\r\nthis effect not result, or the change of colour be observed by the deep\r\ntint of the fluid, treat the solid matter with solution of caustic\r\npotass; filter and add what passes through to the former fluid;\r\nevaporate to dryness and char by a red heat; act on the residue with\r\ndistilled water. The solution contains the bromide of potassium, and is\r\ntherefore turned orange-red by chlorine. The orange tint, whether struck\r\nat once in the fluid part of the mixture, or after carbonization and\r\nsolution of the residue, is removed by agitation with ether; and the\r\netherial solution of bromine in its turn loses colour when treated with\r\nsolution of caustic potass, hydro-bromate of potass being again formed.\r\n\r\nM. Barthez found, that a solution of twelve grains injected into the\r\njugular vein of a dog, sometimes occasioned immediate tetanus and death;\r\nand that the heart was gorged with clotted blood. Sometimes however even\r\nseventeen drops did not prove fatal, but produced merely restlessness,\r\ndifficult breathing, dilated pupil, frequency of the pulse, and\r\nsneezing. Dieffenbach remarked similar effects in the rabbit: The animal\r\neither died immediately, or soon recovered altogether. In a cat, after\r\nthe injection of twelve drops of a concentrated solution into its\r\njugular vein, death took place in fifteen minutes; but in another from\r\nwhich a little blood was drawn after the symptoms were fully formed,\r\ncomplete recovery gradually ensued. Butske found a horse suffer so much\r\nfrom mortal prostration immediately after five grains dissolved in two\r\nounces of water were injected into its jugular vein, that he supposed it\r\nwas about to die; but it quickly revived, and ultimately got quite well.\r\nDr. Glover obtained similar results. When recovery took place, the\r\nleading symptoms were panting, sneezing, discharge from the nostrils,\r\nrigors and debility.\r\n\r\nWhen introduced into the stomach of dogs, M. Barthez found that twenty\r\ndrops on a full stomach had no particular effect; that thirty drops\r\noccasioned vomiting, and temporary acceleration of the pulse and\r\nbreathing; and that from forty to sixty drops on an empty stomach\r\nbrought on violent vomiting, sneezing, cough, dilated pupil and\r\nprostration, succeeded in a few hours by languor without any other\r\nsymptom, and by death in four or five days. In the dead body he remarked\r\nnumerous little ulcers of the villous coat, some of which had an\r\nash-gray appearance at the bottom, while others were covered with a\r\nblack slough, easily removed by friction. When the gullet was tied to\r\nprevent vomiting, less doses proved more quickly fatal. He likewise\r\nobserved that the matter vomited in these experiments, even a few\r\nminutes after the administration of the poison, had no appearance or\r\nodour of bromine; whence it is reasonable to conclude, that, as in the\r\ninstance of iodine, a chemical change takes place with the aid of\r\ncertain vital operations, so that the bromine becomes hydrobromic\r\nacid.—The experiments of Dr. Butske assign to it more activity as a\r\npoison than those now related. For he found that a dog died in a day\r\nfrom taking only five grains dissolved in two ounces of water; and the\r\nsymptoms were laborious breathing, loud cries, and convulsions. In the\r\ndead body he found the stomach internally chequered with bloody\r\nextravasation, and filled with bloody mucus, the duodenal mucous\r\nmembrane universally injected, but the rest of the alimentary canal in a\r\nhealthy state.—Dr. Glover remarked in such cases, besides the usual\r\nsymptoms of an irritant action on the stomach, coryza, sneezing,\r\nsalivation and difficult breathing. Sixty minims killed a cat in\r\nseventeen minutes, two fluid drachms a dog in five hours and a half, ten\r\ngrains a rabbit in five minutes. A dog twice got twenty grains in\r\nsolution and recovered, but died after a third dose of the same amount.\r\nAnother got twenty grains in solution every two or three days for a\r\nmonth without injury. In some of these experiments hydrobromic acid was\r\ndetected in the blood and urine.\r\n\r\nLittle is yet known of the effects of bromine on man. Butske found that\r\na drop and a half in half an ounce of water produced a sense of heat in\r\nthe mouth, gullet, and stomach, and subsequently colic pains; and that\r\ntwo drops and a half in an ounce of mucilage excited, in addition to the\r\npreceding symptoms, great nausea, hiccup, and increased secretion of\r\nmucus. On the other hand M. Fournet, who gave doses gradually increasing\r\nfrom two to sixty drops daily for many weeks, observed that the lowest\r\ndoses excited itching in the hands and feet, and sometimes colic; that\r\nan increase in the quantity caused heat in the chest and nausea; and\r\nthat forty-five drops occasioned also severe burning and sense of\r\nacidity in the stomach, which however were temporary. The appetite was\r\nin general rather improved, and the body became more plump.[376]—Bromine\r\nappears on the whole to be a pure local irritant. It acts most\r\nenergetically when most thoroughly dissolved in water.\r\n\r\n_Hydrobromic acid_ seems from the experiments of Dr. Glover to be a pure\r\nirritant and corrosive, allied in action and energy to hydrochloric\r\nacid. The same experimentalist found that _bromine of potassium_ in the\r\ndose of forty grains had sometimes little or no effect on dogs when\r\ninjected into the blood-vessels, while in other instances less doses\r\ncause speedy death by paralysing the heart. Barthez observed that half a\r\ndrachm in solution produced dulness and depression in dogs, but no other\r\nbad effect; and that two drachms retained in the stomach by tying the\r\ngullet occasioned death in three days with symptoms of irritant\r\npoisoning. M. Maillet observed that two ounces of this salt in the form\r\nof ointment, administered to a dog by rubbing it over his nose, and\r\nletting him lick it off and swallow it, had no effect whatever.[377]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n                     OF POISONING WITH ACETIC ACID.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcetic acid, although in its ordinary state undoubtedly possessed of\r\nlittle activity as a poison, has nevertheless proved in some\r\ncircumstances deleterious, and capable of occasioning death even in the\r\nhuman subject. It exists in various forms. The most common is ordinary\r\nvinegar, in which it is much diluted. Another common form is the\r\npyroligneous vinegar, pyroligneous acid, or pyroligneous acetic acid, as\r\nit is variously called, which when impure has a reddish-brown colour,\r\nbut when pure is almost or altogether colourless, and the strength of\r\nwhich is much greater than that of common vinegar. What is called proof\r\nvinegar has a density about 1005, and contains about four per cent. of\r\nconcentrated acid. The pyroligneous acid sold in the shops of this town\r\nhas a density about 1035, and contains about 25 per cent.; but the\r\npyroligneous acid of the London Pharmacopœia is stronger, for its\r\ndensity is 1050, and 100 parts contain about 50 of the strong acid. A\r\nthird form is the concentrated or pure acetic acid of the apothecary,\r\nwhich is familiarly known as the chief ingredient and menstruum of a\r\ncommon perfume, aromatic vinegar.\r\n\r\n\r\n               SECTION I.—_Of the Tests for Acetic Acid._\r\n\r\nIn all its forms acetic acid is easily known by its very peculiar odour,\r\ntogether with its acid reaction on litmus. But if farther evidence of\r\nits nature be required, it will be requisite to neutralise the fluid\r\nsuspected to contain it with carbonate of potass, and then to procure\r\nthe acetate of potass by evaporation. This salt is known by its extreme\r\ntendency to deliquesce, and by a concentrated solution in water,\r\nyielding, when distilled with sulphuric acid, a fluid possessing the\r\npeculiar odour and pungency of concentrated acetic acid.\r\n\r\nWhen in a state of compound admixture with organic substances, such as\r\nthe contents of the stomach, it has been proved by late researches of\r\nOrfila,[378] that this acid may be present in considerable proportion\r\nwithout distinctly reddening litmus. For such mixtures the following\r\nprocess of analysis, devised by the Parisian professor, will be found\r\nconvenient and effectual. The fluid being put into a retort with a\r\nreceiver attached, the retort is to be heated in a muriate of lime bath\r\ntill the residuum be dry. The distilled fluid may then be tested\r\ntentatively for sulphuric and muriatic acids; and these being proved to\r\nbe absent, the acidity and peculiar smell of the liquid will supply\r\nstrong presumption of the presence of acetic acid. This presumption may\r\nbe turned to certainty by forming acetate of potass, as already directed\r\nfor the pure diluted acetic acid.\r\n\r\nOrfila has omitted in his paper a serious fallacy to which this, as well\r\nas every process for the detection of acetic acid in the contents of the\r\nstomach is exposed,—namely, that the natural secretions of the stomach,\r\naccording to the researches of many physiologists, but more especially\r\nin recent times those of Tiedemann and Gmelin in Germany, and those of\r\nLeuret and Lassaigne in Paris, frequently contain a small proportion of\r\nacetic acid. Hence, the inference in favour of the introduction of\r\nacetic acid into the stomach from without, founded on the process\r\nrelated above, is only legitimate when the quantity discovered is\r\nconsiderable.—The medical jurist ought also to keep in mind that vinegar\r\nis a common remedy with the vulgar for many diseases, and especially for\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SECTION II.—_Of the Effects of Acetic Acid on Man and Animals._\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of this work, it was stated that acetic acid could\r\nscarcely be considered a poison. And in illustration, a case was\r\nmentioned which fell under my own notice,—that of a gentleman, who\r\nduring dinner swallowed at a draught about eight ounces of vinegar by\r\nmistake for beer, and who nevertheless sustained no harm although he\r\nretained it all, and as the only measure of precaution, swallowed after\r\nit an equal quantity of port wine. In farther confirmation of what is\r\nhere mentioned, it may be added, that an ounce of acid equal in strength\r\nto the pyroligneous vinegar, has been found by Schubarth of Berlin to\r\nproduce very little effect when administered to a dog. The animal merely\r\nfrothed a little at the mouth; cried and became restless for a time;\r\nthen had one or two attacks of vomiting; and in an hour appeared quite\r\nwell again.[379] Nay, it has even been found by Pommer of Heilbronn,\r\nthat a considerable quantity of diluted acetic acid may be injected into\r\nthe blood without causing any mischief. He injected six drachms of\r\ndistilled vinegar into the femoral vein of one dog, and an ounce into\r\nthe jugular vein of another, but observed no effect whatever, except a\r\nslight labour of respiration for a short time afterwards.[380]\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, from some experiments performed by Professor Orfila\r\non occasion of a judicial case to be mentioned presently, that all the\r\nforms of acetic acid will prove injurious and even fatal to dogs, if\r\ngiven in sufficient quantity and prevented from being discharged by\r\nvomiting. An ounce of pyroligneous vinegar, administered to dogs of\r\nmiddle size, and retained in the stomach by a ligature on the gullet,\r\nproduces efforts to vomit, evident suffering, prostration of strength,\r\nand death in five, seven, or nine hours. An ounce of concentrated acetic\r\nacid occasioned death in one hour and a quarter; and four or five ounces\r\nof common vinegar proved fatal in ten or fifteen hours. These\r\nexperiments would make it appear that acetic acid is scarcely less\r\nactive as an irritant poison than even the mineral acids.[381] They are\r\nin some measure confirmed by the prior experiments of Schubarth; who\r\noperated, however, with an impure reddish-brown pyroligneous acid, and\r\nwas led to ascribe its energy to the presence of some empyreumatic oil,\r\nbecause he found, as was already remarked, that a pure acid of equal\r\nstrength appeared almost inert. From half an ounce to an ounce of the\r\nimpure acid given to dogs, caused fruitless efforts to vomit, sometimes\r\nfree vomiting, occasionally great flow of tears, always weakness in the\r\nhind-legs, and feeble, irregular pulse, and death either in two days\r\nwithout any new symptom of consequence, or more rapid death in four or\r\nfive hours, with previous convulsions, and sometimes insensibility.[382]\r\nThese experiments were made with an acid which neutralized 50 grains of\r\ncarbonate of lime per ounce, consequently contained at least 50 grains\r\nof concentrated acid, or about a tenth of its weight.\r\n\r\nTo these observations it may be added, that according to the experiments\r\nof Hébréart, a small quantity of acetic acid dropped into the windpipe,\r\nproduces hissing respiration, rattling in the throat, and death in three\r\ndays from true croup.[383]\r\n\r\nIn all the preceding experiments distinct evidence was obtained in the\r\ndead body of the irritant action of the poison. The stomach contained\r\nbrownish-black blood, the villous coat was blackish, and the subjacent\r\ncellular tissue injected with black blood; sometimes there was an\r\nappearance of erosion on the surface of the villous coat; and in the\r\ninstance of the concentrated acid perforations were found. In the\r\nexperiments of Hébréart the lining membrane of the windpipe was covered\r\nwith a fibrinous pseudo-membrane, exactly as after croup.\r\n\r\nAlthough acetic acid in its various forms is daily in the hands of every\r\nbody, one case only of poisoning with it in the human subject has\r\nhitherto been made public. It is described by MM. Orfila and\r\nBarruel.[384] A girl was seen in a village near Paris at eleven at night\r\napparently intoxicated. Five hours afterwards she was found lying on the\r\nground in great agony; and after complaining of pain in the stomach and\r\nexperiencing several attacks of convulsions, she expired. On the\r\nsubsequent examination of the body considerable lividity was observed on\r\nthe skin of the depending parts. The back of the tongue was brownish and\r\nleathery, and the inner membrane of the gullet blackish-brown,\r\nintersected by a fine network of vessels. The stomach presented\r\ninternally several large, black, firm elevations, owing to the injection\r\nof coagulated blood into the submucous cellular tissue; and elsewhere it\r\nhad a grayish-white tint, with here and there a reddish colour; but the\r\nmucous membrane was perfectly entire. The cavity contained above eight\r\nounces of a thick, blackish fluid; and a thicker pulpy matter of the\r\nsame colour adhered firmly to the villous coat. The intestines were\r\nhealthy, and so also were the other organs in the belly and chest. The\r\nuterus contained a fœtus two months and a half old. The contents of the\r\nstomach were subjected to a careful analysis by MM. Orfila and Barruel,\r\nwho found that they did not contain any appreciable quantity of free\r\nsulphuric or muriatic acid, or of any of the common metallic poisons;\r\nand by the process of analysis formerly described, they succeeded in\r\nseparating from the impure mass three drachms of a pure, and tolerably\r\nconcentrated acetic acid, besides two drachms more from the contents of\r\nthe intestines. As the residue of the distillation left behind in the\r\nretort did not yield any bitter principle to boiling alcohol, so as to\r\ncountenance the idea of a vegetable alkaloid having been given along\r\nwith the acetic acid, they inferred that this acid had been swallowed\r\nalone; and the experiments of Orfila on dogs, performed for the\r\noccasion, induced them to conclude that it was the cause of death.\r\n\r\nTo these observations it is only farther necessary to add, that the\r\nconcentrated acid is a powerful irritant and even corrosive when applied\r\nexternally; which properties are owing to its power of dissolving many\r\nof the soft animal solids.[385]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                     OF POISONING WITH OXALIC ACID.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last poison of this order is oxalic acid. It is a substance of very\r\ngreat interest; for it is a poison of great energy, and in this country\r\nis in common use for committing suicide, and has been often taken by\r\naccident for Epsom salt.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly ill adapted for the purposes of the murderer; for\r\nalthough it might be easily given to a sick person instead of a laxative\r\nsalt, yet its real nature would betray itself too soon and too\r\nunequivocally for the chief object of the prisoner,—secrecy.\r\nNevertheless, attempts of the kind have been made. At the trial of James\r\nBrown for assaulting his wife, held at the Middlesex Autumn Assizes\r\n1827, it was brought out in evidence that he had previously tried to\r\npoison her by giving her oxalic acid in gin;[386] and Mr. Alfred Taylor\r\nsays he is acquainted with two similar cases, where an attempt was made\r\nto administer it in tea.[387]\r\n\r\nIt was first made known as a poison by Mr. Royston in 1814.[388] Its\r\nproperties have been examined by Dr. A. T. Thomson of London,[389] and\r\nDr. Perey of Lausanne;[390] in 1823, the whole subject of poisoning with\r\noxalic acid in its medico-legal relations was examined by Dr. Coindet of\r\nGeneva and myself;[391] and in 1828, another experimental inquiry, which\r\nconfirms most of the results we obtained, was published by Dr. Pommer of\r\nHeilbronn.[392]\r\n\r\n\r\n               SECTION I.—_Of the Tests for Oxalic Acid._\r\n\r\nOxalic acid is commonly in small crystals of the form of flattened\r\nsix-sided striated prisms, transparent, colourless, free of odour, very\r\nacid to the taste, and permanent in the air. Two other common vegetable\r\nacids, the citric and tartaric acids, present a totally different\r\ncrystalline form. In general appearance it greatly resembles the\r\nsulphate of magnesia, for which it has been so often and so fatally\r\nmistaken. So close, indeed, is the resemblance, that repeatedly, on\r\ndesiring several persons to point out which was the poison and which the\r\nlaxative, I have found as many fix on the wrong as on the right parcel.\r\nThe sulphate of magnesia has of course a very different taste, being\r\nstrongly bitter. Various plans have been devised for preventing the\r\naccident to which this unlucky resemblance has given rise. The best of\r\nthem imply the use of a safeguard by the patient before he takes his\r\nlaxative draught. It seems to have escaped the notice of those who have\r\nproposed the plans in question, that, if accidents are to be prevented\r\nin this manner, by far the simplest and most effectual security will be\r\nto let the public know, that a laxative salt ought always to be tasted\r\nbefore being swallowed. Its solubility has been much overrated by some\r\nchemists. It does not appear to me soluble in less than eleven parts of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn determining the medico-legal tests for oxalic acid, it will be\r\nsufficient to consider it in two states,—dissolved in water,—and mixed\r\nwith the contents of the stomach and intestines or vomited matter. If\r\nthe substance submitted to examination is in the solid state, the first\r\nstep is to convert it into a solution.\r\n\r\n1. In the form of a pure solution, its nature may be satisfactorily\r\ndetermined by the following process.\r\n\r\nThe acidity of the fluid is first to be established by its effect on\r\nlitmus-paper.—A small portion is next to be tested with ammonia, which,\r\nif the solution of the acid be sufficiently concentrated, will produce a\r\nradiated crystallization, as the oxalate of ammonia formed is much less\r\nsoluble than oxalic acid itself. This property, according to Dr.\r\nO’Shaughnessey, distinguishes it from every other acid.[393] The\r\nremainder of the fluid is next to be subjected to the following\r\nreagents.\r\n\r\n_Hydrochlorate of lime_ causes a white precipitate, the oxalate of lime;\r\nwhich is dissolved on the addition of a drop or two of nitric acid,—and\r\nis not dissolved when similarly treated with hydrochloric acid, unless\r\nthe acid is added in very large proportion.\r\n\r\nThe easy solubility of the oxalate of lime in nitric acid distinguishes\r\nthe precipitate from the sulphate of lime, which the present test might\r\nthrow down from solutions of the sulphates, and which is not soluble in\r\na moderate quantity of nitric acid without the aid of heat. The\r\ninsolubility of the oxalate of lime in hydrochloric acid on the other\r\nhand distinguishes the precipitate from the tartrate, citrate, carbonate\r\nand phosphate of lime, which the test might throw down from any solution\r\ncontaining a salt of these acids. The last four precipitates are\r\nredissolved by a drop or two of hydrochloric acid; but the oxalate is\r\nnot taken up till a large quantity of that acid is added.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of lime_ in solution causes a white precipitate with oxalic\r\nacid, and not with any other.[394]\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of copper_ causes a faint bluish-white, or greenish-white\r\nprecipitate, which is not redissolved on the addition of a few drops of\r\nhydrochloric acid. The precipitate is the oxalate of copper. It is\r\nredissolved by a large proportion of hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nThis test does not precipitate the sulphates, hydrochlorates, nitrates,\r\ntartrates, citrates. But with the carbonates and phosphates it forms\r\nprecipitates resembling the oxalate of copper. The oxalate, however, is\r\ndistinguished from the carbonate and phosphate of copper by not being\r\nredissolved on the addition of a few drops of hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n_Nitrate of silver_ causes a dense, white precipitate, the oxalate of\r\nsilver; which, when collected on a filter, dried and heated, becomes\r\nbrown on the edge, then fulminates faintly and is dispersed.\r\n\r\nThe object of the supplementary test of fulmination is to distinguish\r\nthe oxalate of silver from the numberless other white precipitates which\r\nare thrown down by the nitrate of silver from solutions of other salts.\r\nThe property of fulmination, which is very characteristic, requires, for\r\nsecurity’s sake, a word or two of explanation, in consequence of the\r\neffect of heat on the tartrate and citrate of silver. The citrate when\r\nheated becomes altogether brown, froths up, and then deflagrates,\r\ndischarging white fumes and leaving an abundant, ash-gray, coarsely\r\nfibrous, crumbly residue, which on the farther application of heat\r\nbecomes pure white, being then pure silver. The tartrate also becomes\r\nbrown and froths up, but does not even deflagrate, white fumes are\r\ndischarged, and there is left behind a botryoidal mass, which, like the\r\nresidue from the citrate, becomes pure silver when heated to redness.\r\nAnother distinction between the oxalate and tartrate is that the former\r\ncontinues permanent at the temperature of ebullition, while the latter\r\nbecomes brown. The preceding process or combination of tests will be\r\namply sufficient for proving the presence of oxalic acid, free or\r\ncombined, in any fluid, which does not contain animal or vegetable\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n2. The only important modifications in the analysis rendered necessary\r\nby the admixture of organic principles, occur in the case of the\r\ncontents of the alimentary canal or vomited matters.\r\n\r\nDr. Coindet and I proved, that oxalic acid has not any chemical action\r\nwith any of the common animal principles except gelatin, which it\r\nrapidly dissolves;—and that this solution is of a peculiar kind, not\r\nbeing accompanied with any decomposition, either of the acid or of the\r\ngelatin.[395] Consequently oxalic acid, so far as concerns the tissues\r\nof the stomach or its ordinary contents, is not altered in chemical\r\nform, and remains soluble in water.\r\n\r\nIn such a solution, however, a variety of soluble principles are\r\ncontained, which would cause abundant precipitates with two of the tests\r\nof the process,—sulphate of copper and nitrate of silver; so that the\r\noxalates of these metals could not possibly be detached in their\r\ncharacteristic forms. The process for a pure solution, therefore, is\r\ninapplicable to the mixtures under consideration.\r\n\r\nBut changes of still greater consequence are effected on the poison by\r\nexhibiting antidotes during life. It is now generally known, that the\r\nproper antidotes for oxalic acid are magnesia and chalk. Each of these\r\nforms an insoluble oxalate; so that if either had been given in\r\nsufficient quantity, no oxalic acid will remain in solution, and the\r\nproofs of the presence of the poison must be sought for in the solid\r\ncontents of the stomach or solid matter vomited.\r\n\r\nThe following process for detecting the poison will apply to all the\r\nalterations which it may thus have undergone.\r\n\r\n_Process for Compound Mixtures._—If chalk or magnesia has not been given\r\nas an antidote, the suspected mixture is to be macerated if necessary\r\nfor a few hours in a little distilled water, then filtered, and the\r\nfiltered fluid neutralized with carbonate of potass. If on the other\r\nhand chalk or magnesia has been given, the mixture is to be left at rest\r\nfor some time, and the supernatant fluid then removed. This fluid, if\r\nnot acid, may be thrown away; but if acid, it may be treated as already\r\ndirected for a suspected mixture, where chalk or magnesia has not\r\nobtained entrance. After the removal of the supernatant liquid, pick out\r\nas many solid fragments of animal or vegetable matter as possible; and\r\nadd as much pure water to the insoluble residue as will give the mass a\r\nsufficiently thin consistence. Add now to the mixture about a twentieth\r\nof its weight of carbonate of potass, and boil gently for two hours, or\r\ntill the organic matter is all dissolved. While dissolution thus takes\r\nplace, a double interchange is effected between the elements of the\r\ncarbonate of potass on the one hand, and those of the earthy oxalate on\r\nthe other, so that an oxalate of potass will at length exist in\r\nsolution. The fluid when cold is next to be filtered, then rendered very\r\nfaintly acidulous with nitric acid, then filtered and rendered very\r\nfaintly alkaline with carbonate of potass, and filtered a third time. At\r\neach of these steps some animal matter will be thrown down.\r\n\r\nFrom this point onwards the process proceeds in the same way, whatever\r\nmay have been the original form in which the acid existed in the\r\nmixture; for the oxalate of lime or magnesia in the second case is\r\nconverted into oxalate of potass.\r\n\r\nAdd now the solution of acetate of lead to the fluid as long as any\r\nprecipitate is formed. Collect the precipitate on a filter, wash it\r\nwell, and dry it by compression between folds of bibulous paper. Remove\r\nthis precipitate, which consists of oxalate of lead and organic matter\r\nin union with oxide of lead, and rub it up very carefully while damp\r\nwith a little water in a mortar. Transmit sulphuretted hydrogen gas\r\nbriskly for an hour, so that the whole white precipitate shall be\r\nthoroughly blackened; filter and boil. In this manner is formed a\r\nsulphuret of lead, which retains a great deal of animal matter; and the\r\noxalic acid being set free, is found in the solution tolerably pure.\r\nFiltration before boiling is an essential point in this step, to prevent\r\nanimal matter being dissolved by the water from the sulphuret of lead.\r\nMore animal matter may still be separated by evaporating the liquid to\r\ndryness at 212°, keeping it at that temperature for a few minutes, and\r\nredissolving and filtering. The solution will now exhibit the properties\r\nof oxalic acid.\r\n\r\nI have found that when this process was applied to a decoction of an\r\nounce of beef in six ounces of water, with which one grain of anhydrous\r\noxalic acid had been mixed, all the tests acted characteristically on\r\nthe solution ultimately procured. I have farther found, that when two\r\ngrains of oxalate of lime, which correspond with one grain of oxalic\r\nacid, were mixed with a similar decoction in which some fragments of\r\nbeef were purposely left to complicate the process, a solution was\r\neventually obtained, which gave with muriate of lime a white precipitate\r\ninsoluble in a little muriatic acid, with sulphate of copper a\r\ngreenish-white precipitate also insoluble in a little muriatic acid, and\r\nwith nitrate of silver a white precipitate which fulminated and was\r\nalmost all dispersed, but left a little charcoal, owing to its\r\ncontaining a small proportion of animal matter. In a case which lately\r\nhappened in London, every test acted as here described, except that the\r\noxalate of lime did not fulminate, owing to the presence of organic\r\nimpurities.[396] In order to try the test of fulmination in such\r\ncircumstances, it is essential to dry the precipitated oxalate of silver\r\nthoroughly before raising the temperature to the point at which\r\nfulmination usually occurs.\r\n\r\nThe process now recommended is both delicate and accurate. An objection\r\nhas been advanced against it,—that acetate of lead will throw down\r\nchloride of lead as well as the oxalate of lead; that both will\r\nsubsequently be decomposed by the sulphuretted-hydrogen? and that the\r\nhydrochloric acid thus brought into the solution with the oxalic acid\r\nwill be precipitated by the nitrate of silver, and form a mixture of\r\nsalts which will not fulminate characteristically.[397] This objection\r\nis not well founded. Chloride of lead being soluble in thirty parts of\r\ntemperate water, it will seldom be thrown down from such fluids as occur\r\nin medico-legal inquiries; and besides it is easily removed, as I have\r\nascertained, by washing the precipitate with moderate care on the\r\nfilter.\r\n\r\nProfessor Orfila has advanced another objection,—that the process will\r\nyield all the indications mentioned above, if binoxalate of potash be\r\npresent, or sorrel-soup, which contains a little of that salt.[398] The\r\nobjection is valid, were these substances apt to come in the way. But\r\nthe binoxalate of potash is not put to any medicinal use in Britain, and\r\nEnglish cookery does not acknowledge the “soupe à l’oseille.” The\r\nprocess he recommends to meet the difficulty, an important one in\r\nFrance, is the following: 1. Having made a watery solution as above,\r\nevaporate nearly to dryness, agitate the residue with cold pure alcohol,\r\nrepeatedly during a period of several hours; decant the tincture, and\r\nrepeat this step with more alcohol; evaporate to obtain crystals, if\r\npossible; dissolve these again in cold pure alcohol, and crystallize a\r\nsecond time by evaporation. If crystals do not form on first\r\nconcentrating the alcoholic solution, evaporate it till a pellicle\r\nbegins to form, agitate the residue with cold pure alcohol, and\r\nconcentrate again to obtain crystals. Lastly, examine the crystals by\r\nthe tests for pure oxalic acid. The object of these steps in the process\r\nis to separate binoxalate of potass, oxalate of magnesia and oxalate of\r\nlime, which, he says, are all either not soluble, or very sparingly so,\r\nin absolute alcohol. 2. More oxalic acid may be got by acting with\r\ndistilled water on the matter left by the action of alcohol, evaporating\r\nthis watery solution nearly to dryness, agitating the residuum with cold\r\nalcohol as before, and so on. 3. The preceding operations may have left\r\noxalate of magnesia and oxalate of lime unacted on by the water among\r\nthe solids remaining on the filter. The former compound may be dissolved\r\nout by cold hydrochloric acid diluted with four times its volume of\r\nwater; and by an excess of pure carbonate of potass, the oxalate of\r\nmagnesia in the solution is converted into insoluble carbonate of\r\nmagnesia and soluble oxalate of potass, from which oxalic acid is to be\r\nobtained by a salt of lead and sulphuretted-hydrogen, as explained in my\r\nown process. 4. Oxalate of lime, which may still remain, is to be sought\r\nfor by boiling the residuum of the action of hydrochloric acid with\r\nsolution of bicarbonate of potash, so as to obtain here also an oxalate\r\nof potass in solution. I have not had an opportunity of trying this\r\nmethod. But I find, that, contrary to Orfila’s statement, binoxolate of\r\npotass, though sparingly soluble in cold alcohol of the density of 800,\r\nis sufficiently so to vitiate the principle on which the process is\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nCaustic potass must not be used for decomposing oxalate of lime or\r\nmagnesia, because the pure alkali, as Gay-Lussac has shown, produces\r\noxalic acid in acting on animal substances at a boiling temperature.\r\nCarbonate of potass has no such effect.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of oxalic acid in the form of oxalate of lime in the\r\nstomach or vomited matter is exposed to a singular fallacy, if a\r\nmaterial quantity of rhubarb has been taken recently before death, or\r\nbefore the discharge of the vomited matter. For according to the\r\nresearches of M. Henry of Paris, rhubarb root always contains some\r\noxalate of lime, and some samples yield so much as 30 and even 33 per\r\ncent.[399]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—_On the Action of Oxalic Acid and the Symptoms it causes in\r\n                                 Man._\r\n\r\nThe action of oxalic acid on the animal economy is very peculiar.\r\n\r\nWhen injected in a state of concentration into the stomach of a dog or\r\ncat, it causes exquisite pain, expressed by cries and struggling. In a\r\nfew minutes this is succeeded by violent efforts to vomit; then by\r\nsudden dulness, languor, and great debility; and death soon takes place\r\nwithout a struggle. The period which elapses before death varies from\r\ntwo to twenty minutes, when the dose is considerable,—half an ounce, for\r\nexample. After death the stomach is found to contain black extravasated\r\nblood, exactly like blood acted on by oxalic acid out of the body; the\r\ninner coat of the stomach is of a cherry-red colour, with streaks of\r\nblack granular warty extravasation; and in some places the surface of\r\nthe coat is very brittle and the subjacent stratum gelatinized,\r\nevidently by the chemical action of the poison.[400] If the stomach is\r\nexamined immediately after death, little corrosion will be found,\r\ncompared with what is seen if the inspection be delayed a day or\r\ntwo.[401]\r\n\r\nSuch are the effects of the concentrated acid. When considerably\r\ndiluted, the phenomena are totally different. When dissolved in twenty\r\nparts of water, oxalic acid, like the mineral acids in the same\r\ncircumstances, cease to corrode; nay it hardly even irritates. But,\r\nunlike them, it continues a deadly poison; for it causes death by acting\r\nindirectly on the brain, spine, and heart. The symptoms then induced\r\nvary with the dose. When the quantity is large, the most prominent\r\nsymptoms are those of palsy of the heart; and immediately after death\r\nthat organ is found to have lost its contractility, and to contain\r\narterial blood in its left cavities. When the dose is less the animal\r\nperishes after several fits of violent tetanus, which affects the\r\nrespiratory muscles of the chest in particular, causing spasmodic fixing\r\nof the chest and consequent suffocation. When the dose is still less,\r\nthe spasms are slight or altogether wanting, and death occurs under\r\nsymptoms of pure narcotism like those caused by opium: the animal\r\nappears to sleep away.\r\n\r\nThis poison acts with violence, and produces nearly the same effects to\r\nwhatever texture of the body it is applied. It causes death with great\r\nrapidity when injected into the sac of the peritonæum, or into that of\r\nthe pleura; it acts with still greater quickness when injected into a\r\nvein; and it also acts when injected into the cellular tissue beneath\r\nthe skin, but with much less celerity than through any other channel.\r\nEight grains injected into the jugular vein of a dog occasioned almost\r\nimmediate death: Thirty-three grains injected into the pleura killed\r\nanother in twelve minutes. The same quantity did not prove fatal, though\r\nit caused violent effects, when retained in the stomach by a ligature on\r\nthe gullet. One hundred and sixty grains injected under the skin of the\r\nthigh and belly did not prove fatal for about ten hours. The symptoms\r\nwere nearly the same in every case.[402]\r\n\r\nIt is probable from the facts now stated, that oxalic acid, when not\r\nsufficiently concentrated to occasion death by the local injury\r\nproduced, acts on the nervous system through the medium of the blood.\r\nNevertheless it is a remarkable circumstance that it cannot be detected\r\nin that fluid. Mention has already been made of an experiment performed\r\nby Dr. Coindet and myself (p. 22), where even after the injection of\r\neight grains of oxalic acid into the femoral vein, and the consequent\r\ndeath of the animal in thirty seconds, none of the poison could be\r\ndetected in the blood of the iliac vein or vena cava. Similar results\r\nhave been more lately obtained by Dr. Pommer. In dogs killed by the\r\ngradual injection of from five to thirty grains into the femoral vein,\r\nhe never could detect the poison in the blood of the right side of the\r\nheart or great veins, except in the instance of the largest doses, where\r\na little could be detected near the opening in the vein. Dr. Pommer’s\r\nexperiments likewise agree with those of Dr. Coindet and myself as to\r\nthe absence of any change in the physical qualities of the blood.[403]\r\nWhen to these circumstances it is added that very small quantities of\r\noxalic acid may be detected in blood, into which it has been introduced\r\nimmediately after removal from the body by venesection, it appears\r\nreasonable to conclude that the poison is quickly decomposed in the\r\nblood by vital operations.\r\n\r\nAccording to Orfila, however, it may be detected in the urine, in which\r\ncrystals of oxalate of lime form on cooling, and more may be obtained on\r\nthe addition of hydrochlorate of lime. Yet he could not detect any\r\noxalic acid in the liver or spleen.[404]\r\n\r\nIn man the most prominent symptoms hitherto observed have been those of\r\nexcessive irritation, because it has been almost always swallowed in a\r\nlarge dose and much concentrated.\r\n\r\nIt is the most rapid and unerring of all the common poisons. The London\r\nCourier contains an inquest on the body of a young man who appears to\r\nhave survived hardly ten minutes;[405] an equally rapid case of a young\r\nlady, who poisoned herself with an ounce, is mentioned in the St.\r\nJames’s Chronicle;[406] and few of those who have died survived above an\r\nhour. This rule, however, is by no means without exception. Mr. Hebb has\r\ndescribed a case which did not prove fatal for thirteen hours;[407] Dr.\r\nArrowsmith of Coventry has favoured me with the particulars of a very\r\ninteresting case which lasted for the same period: and Mr. Frazer has\r\naccurately described another, in which, after the patient seemed to be\r\ndoing tolerably well, an exhausting fever, with dyspepsia and singultus,\r\ncarried him off in twenty-three days.[408]\r\n\r\nAmong the fatal cases the smallest dose has been half an ounce; but\r\nthere can be little doubt that less would be sufficient to cause death.\r\nDr. Babington of Coleraine has published a case where very severe\r\neffects were produced by only two scruples.[409]\r\n\r\nVery few persons have recovered where the quantity was considerable.\r\n\r\nIn every instance in which the dose was considerable, and the solution\r\nconcentrated, the first symptoms have been immediate burning pain in the\r\nstomach, and generally also in the throat. But when the dose was small,\r\nmore particularly if the solution was also rather diluted, the pain has\r\nsometimes been slight, or slow in commencing. Mr. Hebb’s patient, who\r\ntook only half an ounce dissolved in ten parts of water, and diluted it\r\nimmediately after with copious draughts of water, had not any pain in\r\nthe belly for six hours.\r\n\r\nIn general, violent vomiting follows the accession of pain, either\r\nimmediately, or in a few minutes; and it commonly continues till near\r\ndeath. Some, however, have not vomited at all, even when the acid was\r\nstrong and in a large dose; and this is still more apt to happen when\r\nthe poison has been taken much diluted. The man last mentioned did not\r\nvomit at all for seven hours, except when emetics were administered. The\r\nvomited matter, as in this man’s case, and in that of Mr. Frazer’s\r\npatient, is sometimes bloody. Instant discharge of the poison by\r\nvomiting does not always save the patient’s life: A woman who swallowed\r\ntwo ounces died in twenty minutes, although she vomited almost\r\nimmediately after taking the poison.[410]\r\n\r\nThe tongue and mouth occasionally become inflamed if the case lasts long\r\nenough. In an instance of recovery, which happened not long ago in St.\r\nThomas’s Hospital, London, the tongue was red, swollen, tense and\r\ntender, the day after the acid was swallowed.[411]\r\n\r\nDeath commonly takes place so soon, that the bowels are seldom much\r\naffected. But when life is prolonged a few hours, they are evidently\r\nmuch irritated. Dr. Arrowsmith’s patient, who lived thirteen hours, had\r\nsevere pain in the bowels and frequent inclination to go to stool, and\r\nMr. Hebb’s patient, who also lived thirteen hours, had a constant,\r\ninvoluntary discharge of fluid fæces, occasionally mixed with blood.\r\nBloody diarrhœa is very common in dogs.\r\n\r\nThe signs of depressed circulation are always very striking. In general\r\nthe pulse fails altogether, it is always very feeble, and the skin is\r\ncold and clammy. Contrary to the general fact, however, I once remarked\r\nin a dog the pulsation of the heart so strong as to be audible at a\r\ndistance of several yards.\r\n\r\nIn some cases nervous symptoms have occurred, but in none so distinctly\r\nas in animals that have taken the diluted acid. It should be remarked,\r\nhowever, that few published cases contain good histories of the\r\nsymptoms; since they commonly come to an end before being seen by the\r\nphysician. Convulsions appear to have occurred in some instances either\r\nat the time of death or soon before it. In the slower cases various\r\nnervous affections have been observed. A girl, who swallowed by mistake\r\nabout two drachms, and did not vomit till emetics were given, complained\r\nmuch at first of pain, but afterwards chiefly of great lassitude and\r\nweakness of the limbs, and next morning of numbness and weakness there\r\nas well as in the back. This affection was at first so severe that she\r\ncould hardly walk up stairs; but in a few days she recovered\r\nentirely.[412] Analogous effects took place in Mr. Hebb’s patient and in\r\nDr. Arrowsmith’s case. The first thing the former complained of was\r\nacute pain in the back, gradually extending down the thighs, occasioning\r\nere long great torture, and continuing almost till the moment of death.\r\nDr. Arrowsmith’s patient had the same symptoms, complained more of the\r\npain shooting down from the loins to the limbs than of the pain in the\r\nbelly, and was constantly seeking relief in a fresh change of posture.\r\nMr. Frazer’s patient had from an early period a peculiar general\r\nnumbness, approaching to palsy. Dr. Babington’s patient, who took two\r\nscruples by mistake for tartaric acid in an effervescing draught,\r\nsuffered, after the first twenty-four hours, chiefly from headache,\r\nextreme feebleness of the pulse, and a sense of numbness and tingling or\r\npricking in the back and thighs. In a recent case described by Mr.\r\nTapson, which occurred in London, and where it was supposed, but on\r\ninsufficient grounds,[413] that so much as two ounces had been taken,\r\nviolent symptoms of irritation in the alimentary canal came on as usual,\r\nbut soon afterwards a sense as if the hands were dead, loss of\r\nconsciousness for eight hours, and then lividity, coldness, and almost\r\ncomplete loss of the power of motion in the legs; which symptoms were\r\nnot entirely removed for fifteen days. In a case related by Mr. Alfred\r\nTaylor, where death was caused by seven drachms in fifteen or twenty\r\nminutes, there was first violent vomiting, then severe pain in the\r\nstomach, and finally clammy perspiration and convulsions, with two or\r\nthree deep inspirations before death.[414] The effects in this case came\r\nvery near those generally observed in animals.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Arrowsmith’s case two symptoms occurred, which I have not seen\r\nmentioned in any other. The first was an eruption or mottled appearance\r\nof the skin in circular patches, not unlike the roundish red marks on\r\nthe arms of stout healthy children, but of a deeper tint. The second was\r\nthe poisoning and death of leeches applied to the stomach. “They were\r\nhealthy,” says Dr. Arrowsmith in the notes with which he obligingly\r\nfurnished me, “small, and fastened immediately. On looking at them in a\r\nfew minutes I remarked that they did not seem to fill, and on touching\r\none it felt hard and immediately fell off, motionless and dead. The\r\nothers were all in the same state. They had all bitten and the marks\r\nwere conspicuous; but they had drawn scarcely any blood. They were\r\napplied about six hours after the acid was taken.” This curious fact\r\nillustrates the observations formerly quoted from Vernière’s experiments\r\n[p. 67]. It will be observed that the leeches were applied several hours\r\nafter the poison was swallowed, and in a case in which the acid was\r\nlargely diluted in the stomach;—so that it might have entered the blood\r\nand been diffused throughout the body before the observation was made.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SECTION III.—_Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Oxalic Acid._\r\n\r\nThe external appearance of the body is commonly natural. In one instance\r\nthe cellular tissue was distended with gases ten hours after death.[415]\r\nViolent marks of irritation have been commonly found in the stomach; and\r\nsometimes that organ has been even perforated.[416] It is probable that\r\nthe extensive destruction of the coats noticed by some authors has taken\r\nplace in part after death from the action of the acid on the dead\r\ntissues.—The usual conjunction of morbid appearances is well described\r\nby Mr. Hebb. The mucous coat of the throat and gullet looked as if it\r\nhad been scalded, and that of the gullet could be easily scratched off.\r\nThe stomach contained a pint of thick fluid. This is commonly dark, like\r\ncoffee-grounds, as it contains a good deal of blood. The inner coat of\r\nthe stomach was pulpy, in many points black, in others red. The inner\r\nmembrane of the intestines was similarly but less violently affected.\r\nThe outer coat of both stomach and intestines was inflamed. The lining\r\nmembrane of the windpipe was also very red.—The appearances have also\r\nbeen excellently described in the case published by Mr. Alfred Taylor.\r\nThe inside of the gullet was pale, as if boiled, strongly corrugated and\r\nbrittle, and covering a ramification of vessels filled with consolidated\r\nblood. The stomach presented externally numerous vessels in the same\r\nstate; and its villous coat was pale, soft, brittle, but here and there\r\ninjected with vessels. The duodenum and part of the jejunum were red,\r\nthe other intestines natural, the liver, spleen, and kidneys congested.\r\nThe stomach contained a brownish jelly, in which gelatin was detected,\r\nas well as oxalic acid. The blood was fluid every where except in the\r\nvessels of the gullet and stomach.[417] The consolidated condition of\r\nthe blood there was evidently owing to the local action of a strong\r\nacid, and is the same with what has been observed in poisoning with the\r\nmineral acids.—In Mr. Frazer’s patient the whole villous coat of the\r\nstomach was either softened or removed, as well as the inner membrane of\r\nthe gullet, so that the muscular coat was exposed; and this coat\r\npresented a dark gangrenous-like appearance, being much thickened and\r\nhighly injected.\r\n\r\nAlthough these signs of violent irritation are commonly present, it must\r\nat the same time be observed, that some cases have occurred where the\r\nstomach and intestines were quite healthy. In a girl who died about\r\nthirty minutes after swallowing an ounce of the acid, no morbid\r\nappearance whatsoever was to be seen in any part of the alimentary\r\ncanal.[418] In the case of a girl, described by Mr. Anderson, where\r\ndeath took place in twenty minutes, there was no appearance but\r\ncontraction of the rugæ of the gullet and stomach, one spot of\r\nextravasation in the latter and doubtful softening of its villous\r\ncoat.[419]\r\n\r\nThe state of the other organs of the body has not been taken notice of\r\nin published cases. In several instances, as in Mr. Taylor’s case, the\r\nblood in the veins of the stomach is described as having been black and\r\nas it were charred; probably by the chemical action of the acid after\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SECTION IV.—_Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Oxalic Acid._\r\n\r\nThe chief part of the treatment of this kind of poisoning is obvious. On\r\naccount of its dreadful rapidity, remedies cannot be of material use\r\nunless they are resorted to immediately after the acid has been\r\nswallowed. Emetics may be given, if vomiting is not already free; but\r\ntime should never be lost in administering them if an antidote is at\r\nhand. In particular it is necessary to avoid giving warm water with a\r\nview to accelerate vomiting, unless it is given very largely; for\r\nmoderate dilution will promote the entrance of the poison into the\r\nblood, if it has not the effect of immediately expelling it.\r\n\r\nThe principal object of the practitioner should be to administer as\r\nspeedily as possible large doses of magnesia or chalk suspended in\r\nwater. Chalk has been given with great advantage in several cases,[420]\r\nand magnesia has also been of service.[421] As no time should be lost,\r\nthe plaster of the apartment may be resorted to, when chalk or magnesia\r\nis not at hand. These substances not only neutralize the acid so as to\r\ntake away its corrosive power, but likewise render it insoluble, so as\r\nto prevent it from entering the blood. There appears no particular\r\nreason for using the stomach-pump when antidotes are at hand. But\r\nfashion seems to have authorised the employment of this instrument for\r\nevery kind of poison.[422] Alkalis are inadmissible. As might be\r\ninferred from the general statements formerly made on the effect of\r\nchemical changes on poisons [p. 28], the alkalis, as they form only\r\nsoluble salts, will not deprive oxalic acid of its remote or indirect\r\naction; and instances are not wanting of their inutility in actual\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nOxalic acid is one of the poisons alluded to under the head of General\r\nPoisoning,—of whose operation distinct evidence may sometimes (though\r\ncertainly not always) be found in the symptoms. If a person, immediately\r\nafter swallowing a solution of a crystalline salt, which tasted purely\r\nand strongly acid, is attacked with burning in the throat, then with\r\nburning in the stomach, vomiting particularly of bloody matter,\r\nimperceptible pulse and excessive languor, and dies in half an hour, or\r\nstill more in twenty, fifteen, or ten minutes, I do not know any fallacy\r\nwhich can interfere with the conclusion, that oxalic acid was the cause\r\nof death. No parallel disease begins so abruptly and terminates so soon;\r\nand no other crystalline poison has the same effects.\r\n\r\n_Poisoning with the Oxalates._—Oxalic acid is one of the best examples\r\nof a poison that acts through all its soluble chemical combinations. Dr.\r\nCoindet and I found that the oxalates of potash and ammonia are little\r\ninferior in energy to the acid. They do not corrode, indeed, and\r\nscarcely ever irritate; but they produce tetanus and coma, like the\r\ndiluted acid. Half a drachm of oxalic acid neutralized with potass will\r\nkill a rabbit in seventeen minutes; ninety grains of neutral oxalate of\r\nammonia will kill a strong cat in nine minutes.[423] The binoxalate of\r\npotash, the most familiar of the salts of oxalic acid, was not tried by\r\nus. But the preceding facts would leave little doubt of its being a\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nSince the last edition of this work was published several cases have\r\noccurred which amply confirm the results of experimental inquiry. In Dr.\r\nBabington’s case alluded to above, the greater part of the oxalic acid\r\nhad been neutralized by bicarbonate of soda [p. 176].—Mr. Tripier has\r\ncommunicated the particulars of a case in which half an ounce of the\r\nbinoxalate of potash was taken by mistake for bitartrate of potash in\r\nhot water, and caused death in eight minutes, after an attack of violent\r\npain and convulsions.[424]—A young woman at Bordeaux was attacked with\r\nfrequent vomiting after a dose of a drachm and a half of the same salt\r\ndissolved in a ptisane. Next morning a similar dose caused bloody\r\nvomiting and acute pain at the pit of the stomach; and a third dose the\r\nfollowing day excited delirium, more violent vomiting, and death in the\r\ncourse of an hour.[425]—A girl in London swallowed about an ounce of the\r\nsame salt dissolved in hot water. Sickness and faintness ensued, with\r\nimperceptible pulse, cold, clammy skin, rigors, scalding of the mouth\r\nand throat, pain in the back, soreness of the eyes, redness of the\r\nconjunctivæ, and dilatation of the pupils. Afterwards there was\r\nreaction, with a full frequent pulse, hot skin, flushed countenance,\r\nheadache, thirst, and tenderness of the abdomen. She recovered under the\r\nuse of chalk, external heat, ether and opium draughts, leeches and\r\nsinapisms to the belly, and carbonate of ammonia.[426]\r\n\r\nNo account has yet been published of the morbid appearances in man.\r\n\r\nThe proper antidote is sulphate of magnesia. Failing this, weak milk of\r\nlime may be given with advantage.\r\n\r\n_Appendix on Tartaric and Citric Acid._—These two acids may be taken in\r\nconsiderable quantities without injury. Dr. Coindet and I gave a drachm\r\nof each in solution to cats, without observing that the animals suffered\r\nany inconvenience.[427] Dr. Sibbald, a surgeon of this place, has\r\ninformed me of an instance in which a patient of his took in twenty-four\r\nhours six drachms of tartaric acid, having by mistake omitted the\r\ncarbonate of potass sent along with the acid to make effervescing\r\ndraughts; and yet he did not suffer any more inconvenience then the cats\r\non which Dr. Coindet and I experimented.\r\n\r\nPommer, however, found that tartaric acid is scarcely less active than\r\noxalic acid when injected into the blood. When fifteen grains\r\ndissolved in half an ounce of water were injected into the femoral\r\nvein of a dog in four doses, difficult breathing and discharge of\r\nfæces and urine were produced after each operation, and death speedily\r\nensued without any other particular symptom. As in the instance of\r\noxalic acid, the blood in the great veins was not apparently changed\r\nin any of its physical qualities. The heart continued contractile long\r\nafter death, while in the case of oxalic acid its contractility was\r\nsuddenly extinguished.[428]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                   OF THE ALKALIS AND ALKALINE SALTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second order of the class of irritants comprehends the alkalis, some\r\nof the alkaline salts, and lime. The species which it includes are\r\nlittle allied to one another except in chemical composition; and in\r\nparticular they are little allied in physiological properties. It\r\nappears impossible, however, to make a better arrangement than that\r\nproposed by Orfila, which will therefore be here followed.\r\n\r\nMost of the poisons of the second order are powerful local irritants.\r\nSome of them likewise act indirectly on distant organs; and a few are\r\nmore distinguished by their remote than by their local effects. This\r\norder may be conveniently divided into two groups,—the one embracing the\r\ntwo fixed alkalis with their carbonates, nitrates, and chlorides, and\r\nalso lime,—the other ammonia, with its salts, and likewise the alkaline\r\nsulphurets.\r\n\r\nThe action of the first group is purely irritant and strictly local.\r\nWhen concentrated, the fixed alkalis and their carbonates produce\r\nchemical decomposition, softening the animal tissues, and reducing them\r\neventually to a pulpy mass; which change depends on their possessing the\r\npower, as chemical agents, of dissolving almost all the soft solids of\r\nthe body. When much diluted, they produce inflammation, without\r\ncorroding the textures; and it does not appear that they are even then\r\nabsorbed in such quantity as to prove injurious to any remote organ. The\r\naction of the alkaline nitrates and of lime is that of irritants only;\r\nat least their chemical action is obscure and feeble.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _Of the Fixed Alkalis and their Carbonates._\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Section_ I.—_Of their Tests._\r\n\r\n_Potass_ in its caustic state, as usually met with in the shops, forms\r\nlittle gray-coloured cylinders or cakes which have a radiated,\r\ncrystalline fracture, and an excessively acrid caustic taste, and feel\r\nsoapy if touched with the wet finger. It deliquesces rapidly in moist\r\nair, and then attracts carbonic acid from the atmosphere. It is easily\r\nfused by heat, and is exceedingly soluble in water. The solution has a\r\nstrong alkaline reaction on vegetable colours, restoring reddened litmus\r\nto blue, turning syrup of violets or infusion or red cabbage to green,\r\nand rendering infusion of turmeric brown. It is distinguished from the\r\nalkaline earths when in solution, by not precipitating with carbonic or\r\nsulphuric acid, and from soda by the tests to be presently mentioned for\r\nits carbonate.\r\n\r\n_Carbonate of potash_ [subcarbonate, salt of tartar], is usually sold,\r\nwhen pure, in small white grains, formed by melting the salt and\r\nstirring it rapidly as it cools. In its impure state it is called in\r\nthis country potashes, and when somewhat purified, pearl ash. It has\r\nthen a mixed grayish, yellowish, or bluish colour, and is sold in\r\ncrumbly lumps of various sizes. In every state it is deliquescent and\r\nvery caustic. It cannot be crystallized. It gives out carbonic acid gas\r\nwith the addition of any stronger acid, such as sulphuric, muriatic, or\r\nacetic acid. Its solution precipitates yellow with the chloride of\r\nplatinum, gives a crystalline precipitate with perchloric acid, when the\r\nsalt forms not less than a fortieth or fiftieth part,—is similarly acted\r\non by a considerable excess of tartaric acid, if the salt constitute\r\nabout a thirtieth of the fluid,—and yields with the soluble salts of\r\nbaryta a white precipitate soluble in nitric acid.\r\n\r\n_Soda_ resembles potass closely in chemical as well as physiological\r\nproperties; and the _carbonate_ bears the same resemblance to the\r\ncarbonate of potass. The chief differences are the following. The\r\ncarbonate of soda is easily crystallized, and effloresces on exposure to\r\nthe air. A solution in twenty parts of water yields no precipitate with\r\neither perchloric acid or an excess of tartaric acid, because there is\r\nno sparingly soluble perchlorate or bitartrate, as in the case of\r\npotash. Its solution is precipitated by antimoniate of potash, because\r\nthe antimoniate of soda is very sparingly soluble. All its salts remain\r\nunaffected by the chloride of platinum, because their base cannot form\r\nlike potass an insoluble triple salt with the reagent. The acetate of\r\nsoda is permanent in the air, while the acetate of potass is one of the\r\nmost deliquescent salts known. In trying this last test, which is very\r\ncharacteristic, care must be taken to avoid an excess of acid in the\r\nacetate of soda by expelling it at a temperature of 212°, otherwise the\r\nsalt is as deliquescent as the acetate of potass.—Another difference is,\r\nthat the chloride of sodium, being nearly as soluble in temperate as in\r\nboiling water, crystallizes with difficulty and but sparingly by cooling\r\na concentrated boiling solution; while the chloride of potassium is much\r\nmore soluble in hot than in cold water, and crystallizes easily and\r\nabundantly when a concentrated boiling solution is cooled down.\r\n\r\n_Process for Potash and its Carbonate in Organic Mixtures._—The\r\nfollowing method has been lately recommended for the detection of potash\r\nand its carbonate in complex organic mixtures. Ascertain that the\r\nmixture is alkaline in its action on litmus-paper and turmeric-paper,\r\nand that it is not ammoniacal in odour. Distil to one-third; ascertain\r\nthat it has still an alkaline reaction, and evaporate to dryness in a\r\nporcelain basin. Agitate the residue, when cold, with absolute alcohol;\r\nboil, pour off the liquor, and filter it while hot. Repeat this with the\r\nresiduum and more alcohol. Distil off most of the alcohol, and evaporate\r\nto dryness. Raise the heat to char the residuum, continue the heat as\r\nlong as vapours come off, remove the charcoaly matter, and incinerate it\r\nfor forty-five minutes in a silver crucible. Try to separate potash from\r\nwhat remains by means of absolute alcohol; and if this do not succeed,\r\nremove carbonate of potash by boiling water. In either case search for\r\npotash by litmus-paper, turmeric-paper, chloride of platinum, and\r\nperchloric acid.[429]\r\n\r\nThe conclusiveness of this process depends upon the fact, that absolute\r\nalcohol cannot dissolve from solid organic substances such a proportion\r\nof lactate, tartrate, acetate, sulphate, or phosphate of potash, or\r\nchloride of potassium, as to be acted on by chloride of platinum or\r\nperchloric acid.[430]—It is to be observed that carbonate of potash\r\nsingly is insoluble in absolute alcohol; but it becomes soluble in that\r\nfluid, when it is conjoined with various organic matters. Hence it is\r\nthat this process, intended fundamentally for caustic potash alone, is\r\napplicable to carbonate of potash also.\r\n\r\n_Process for Soda and its Carbonate in Organic Mixtures._—These\r\nsubstances may be separated by the method just described for potash. If\r\nthe alcoholic solution of the extract of the suspected matter be\r\nalkaline in its action on litmus, and be afterwards found to contain\r\nsoda or its carbonate, the evidence of these substances having been\r\nderived from without is satisfactory, because the carbonate of soda\r\ncontained in many animal matters cannot be so detached. But if no\r\nindications of the presence of soda be thus obtained, it is not enough\r\nthat soda be found in the alcoholic solution of the incinerated\r\nalcoholic extract, because the natural carbonate of soda of animal\r\nmatter may be separated in that manner.[431]\r\n\r\n\r\n SECTION II.—_Of the Action of the fixed Alkalis, and the Symptoms they\r\n                             cause in Man._\r\n\r\nThe action of the two fixed alkalis and their carbonates on the animal\r\nsystem is so nearly the same, that the facts which have been ascertained\r\nin respect to one of them will apply to all the rest. The operation of\r\npotass and its carbonate has been carefully investigated by Professor\r\nOrfila,[432] and by M. Bretonneau of Tours.[433]\r\n\r\nWhen caustic potass is injected in minute portions into the veins, it\r\ninstantly coagulates the blood. Five grains, according to Orfila, will\r\nin this way kill a dog in two minutes. But when small doses either of\r\npotash itself, or its carbonate, or indeed any of its salts are used,\r\nMr. Blake found, that without coagulating the blood, they arrested the\r\naction of the heart in ten seconds, if injected into the jugular vein;\r\nand that when they were injected into the carotid artery, they\r\noccasioned in four seconds signs of great obstruction in the capillary\r\ncirculation, and arrestment of the heart’s action in thirty-five\r\nminutes, through means of this effect. Next to the salts of baryta he\r\nthought the potash salts the most powerful on the heart’s action of all\r\nthose he tried.[434] When introduced into the stomach potash acts\r\npowerfully as an irritant, and generally corrodes the coats of that\r\norgan. Thirty-two grains given by Orfila to a dog caused pain in the\r\ngullet, violent vomiting, much anguish, restlessness, and death on the\r\nthird day. On dissection he found the inner coat of the gullet and\r\nstomach black and red; and near the pylorus there was a perforation\r\nthree-quarters of an inch wide, and surrounded by a hard, elevated\r\nmargin. The observations of Bretonneau are in some respects different.\r\nWhen potass was swallowed by dogs in the dose of 40 grains, he found\r\nthat the animals, after suffering for some time from violent vomiting,\r\nalways died sooner or later of wasting and exhaustion; and that the\r\naction of the poison was confined chiefly to the gullet, which was\r\nextensively destroyed and ulcerated on its inner surface. But when the\r\ngullet was defended by the potass being passed at once into the stomach\r\nin a caustic holder, larger doses, even several times repeated, did not\r\nprove fatal. The usual violent symptoms of irritation prevailed for two\r\nor three days; but on these subsiding, the animals rapidly recovered\r\ntheir appetite and playfulness, appearing in fact to be restored to\r\nperfect health. Yet there could be no doubt that the stomach all the\r\nwhile was severely injured; for in some of the animals, which were\r\nstrangled for the sake of examination several weeks after they took the\r\npoison, the villous coat was found extensively removed, and even the\r\nmuscular and peritonæal coats were here and there destroyed and\r\ncicatrized. Bretonneau farther adds, that ten or fifteen grains\r\nintroduced into the rectum caused death sooner than three times as much\r\ngiven by the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe carbonate of potass possesses properties similar in kind, but\r\ninferior in degree to those of the caustic alkali. Two drachms given by\r\nOrfila to a dog killed it in twenty-five minutes, violent vomiting and\r\ngreat agony having preceded death. The stomach was universally of a\r\ndeep-red colour on its inner surface.\r\n\r\nPotash and its carbonate are absorbed in the course of their action, and\r\nmay be detected by Orfila’s process in the liver, kidneys, and\r\nurine.[435]\r\n\r\nThe actions of soda and its carbonate seem on the whole the same with\r\nthose of potash; but they are not so energetic. In one respect however\r\nsoda and its salts differ most materially from those of potash. For\r\nwhile the latter, when admitted directly into a vein, act by arresting\r\nthe action of the heart, soda and its salts, according to the inquiries\r\nof Mr. Blake, have no such effect, but cause death by obstructing the\r\ncirculation of the pulmonary capillaries, and preventing the return of\r\nblood from the lungs to the left side of the heart. This conclusion\r\nseems to flow from the following facts. The respiration becomes in a few\r\nseconds laborious and soon ceases, whilst the heart continues to beat\r\nvigorously: arterial pressure is greatly reduced, while venous pressure\r\nis much increased owing to accumulation of blood in the right side of\r\nthe heart: after death the lungs are found congested and often full of\r\nfroth: and the heart continues contractile, very turgid in the right\r\nside, but quite empty of blood in its left cavities.[436]\r\n\r\nPoisoning with the caustic alkalis is rare. In 1842, a lady suffering\r\nfrom inflammation of the bowels took an ounce of solution of potass by\r\nmistake for kali-water, or a solution of bicarbonate of potash\r\nsurcharged with carbonic acid. She suffered severely at the time, and\r\ndied in a fortnight, probably of the conjunct effects of her disease and\r\nthe poison.[437] This is the only case I have found in print of\r\npoisoning with a caustic alkali. But the effects of their carbonates\r\nhave been several times witnessed, and appear to resemble closely those\r\nof the concentrated mineral acids.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are in the first instance an acrid burning taste, and rapid\r\ndestruction of the lining membrane of the mouth; then burning and often\r\nconstriction in the throat and gullet, with difficult and painful\r\ndeglutition; violent vomiting, often sanguinolent, and tinging vegetable\r\nblues green; next acute pain in the stomach and tenderness of the whole\r\nbelly; subsequently cold sweats, excessive weakness, hiccup, tremors and\r\ntwitches of the extremities; and ere long violent colic pains, with\r\npurging of bloody stools and dark membranous flakes. So far the symptoms\r\nare nearly the same in all cases; but in their subsequent course several\r\nvarieties may be noticed.\r\n\r\nIn the worst form of poisoning death ensues at an early period, for\r\nexample within twenty-four hours, nay even before time enough has\r\nelapsed for diarrhœa to begin. A case of this kind, which has been very\r\nwell described by Mr. Dewar of Dunfermline, and which arose from the\r\npatient, a boy, having accidentally swallowed about three ounces of a\r\nstrong solution of carbonate of potass, proved fatal in twelve hours\r\nonly.[438] Here death was owing to the general system or some vital\r\norgan being affected through sympathy by the injury sustained by the\r\nalimentary canal.\r\n\r\nIn the mildest form, as in a case related by Plenck[439] of a man who\r\nswallowed an ounce of the carbonate of potass, the symptoms represent\r\npretty nearly an attack of acute gastritis when followed by\r\nrecovery,—the effects on man being then analogous to those observed by\r\nBretonneau in animals, when the poison was introduced into the stomach\r\nwithout touching the gullet.\r\n\r\nBut a more common form than either of the preceding is one, similar to\r\nthe chronic form of poisoning with the mineral acids, in which constant\r\nvomiting of food and drink, incessant discharge of fluid, sanguinolent\r\nstools, difficulty of swallowing, burning pain from the mouth to the\r\nanus, and rapid emaciation, continue for weeks or even months before the\r\npatient’s strength is exhausted; and where death is evidently owing to\r\nstarvation, the alimentary canal being no longer capable of assimilating\r\nfood. Two characteristic examples of this singular affection have been\r\nrecorded in the Medical Repository,[440] and a third, of which the event\r\nhas not been mentioned, but which would in all likelihood end fatally,\r\nhas been communicated by M. Jules Cloquet to Orfila.[441] Of the two\r\nfirst cases, which were caused by half an ounce of carbonate of potass\r\nhaving been taken in solution by mistake for a laxative salt, one proved\r\nfatal in little more than a month, the other three weeks afterwards. In\r\nCloquet’s case, at the end of the sixth week the membrane of the mouth\r\nwas regenerated; but the gullet continued to discharge pus, and the\r\nstools were purulent and bloody.\r\n\r\nAnother form perhaps equally common with that just described, and not\r\nless certainly fatal, commences like the rest with violent symptoms of\r\nirritation in the mouth, gullet, and stomach; but the bowels are not\r\naffected, and by and by it becomes apparent that the stomach is little\r\ninjured; dysphagia or even complete inability to swallow, burning pain\r\nand constriction in the gullet, hawking and coughing of tough, leathery\r\nflakes, are then the leading symptoms; at length the case becomes one of\r\nstricture of the œsophagus with or without ulceration; the bougie gives\r\nonly temporary relief, and the patient eventually expires either of mere\r\nstarvation, or of that combined with an exhausting fever. Mr. Dewar has\r\nrelated a very striking example of this form of poisoning with the\r\nalkalis.[442] His patient, after the first violent symptoms had\r\nexhausted themselves, which took place in sixteen or eighteen hours,\r\nsuffered little for four or five days till the sloughs began to separate\r\nfrom the lining membrane of the mouth, throat, and gullet. The affection\r\nof the gullet then became gradually predominant, and terminated in\r\nstricture, of which she appears to have been several times so much\r\nrelieved as to have been thought in a fair way of recovery. After\r\nrepeatedly disappointing Mr. Dewar’s hopes of a successful issue by her\r\nintemperance in the use of spirituous liquors, she died of starvation\r\nabout four months after swallowing the poison. Sir Charles Bell has\r\nnoticed three parallel cases, and has given delineations of the\r\nappearance in the gullet of two of them.[443] One of his patients did\r\nnot die till twenty years after swallowing the poison, which in this\r\ninstance was soap-less; yet he does not hesitate to ascribe the\r\nstricture to that cause, and says death arose purely from starvation.\r\n\r\nThe carbonate of soda, though a salt in very common use, has not\r\nhitherto been the cause of accident, which has found its way into print.\r\nIt is plainly much less actively corrosive than carbonate of potass, and\r\nis therefore probably in every sense less energetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n SECTION III.—_Of the Morbid Appearances caused by the fixed Alkalis._\r\n\r\nThe morbid appearances caused by potass, soda, and their carbonates\r\ndiffer with the nature of the case.\r\n\r\nIn the boy who died in twelve hours Mr. Dewar found the inner membrane\r\nof the throat and gullet almost entirely disorganized and reduced to a\r\npulp, with blood extravasated between it and the muscular coat. The\r\ninner coat of the stomach was red, in two round patches destroyed, and\r\nthe patches covered with a clot of blood;—its outer coat, as well as all\r\nthe other abdominal viscera, was sound.\r\n\r\nIn the two chronic cases mentioned in the Medical Repository the\r\nmischief was much more general, the whole peritonæum being condensed,\r\nthe omentum dark and turgid, the intestines glued together by lymph, the\r\nexternal coats of the stomach thick, the villous coat almost all\r\ndestroyed, what remained of it red and near the pylorus ulcerated, and\r\nthe pyloric orifice of the stomach plugged up with lymph so as barely to\r\nadmit a small probe.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Dewar’s patient who died of stricture of the gullet the\r\nintestines were sound, the inner surface of the stomach red especially\r\ntowards the cardia, the inner and muscular coats of the gullet thickened\r\nand firmly incorporated together by effused lymph, the inner coat here\r\nand there wanting, the passage of the gullet every where contracted, and\r\nto such a degree about two inches above the cardia as hardly to pass a\r\ncommon probe. In Sir C. Bell’s cases the appearances were similar.\r\n\r\nOrfila says he is led to conclude from a great number of facts that of\r\nall corrosive poisons potass is the one which most frequently perforates\r\nthe stomach.[444] This appearance, however, has not been mentioned in\r\nany case of poisoning in the human subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SECTION IV.—_Of the Treatment of Poisoning with the fixed Alkalis._\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of poisoning with the alkalis the first object is\r\nevidently to neutralize the poison. This may be done either with a weak\r\nacid, or with oil. Of the acids the acetic in the form of vinegar is\r\nmost generally recommended, as it is not itself injurious. A successful\r\ncase in very unpromising circumstances, where two ounces and a half of\r\ncarbonate of potash had been taken by mistake for cream of tartar, and\r\nwhere the antidote was not administered for half an hour, has been\r\nrelated by M. Liégard of Caen. Great relief was experienced to the\r\nburning in the throat and stomach, the chilliness, difficult breathing,\r\nand frequent efforts to vomit, which were the first symptoms; and after\r\nrepeated alternations of collapse and reaction, convalescence was\r\nestablished in eight days.[445]—M. Chereau thinks that for the mineral\r\nalkalis and their carbonates fixed oil is a preferable antidote to\r\nvinegar; and he has given the heads of two cases of poisoning with large\r\ndoses of carbonate of potass, in which the free employment of almond oil\r\nprevented the usual fatal consequences. It appears to act partly by\r\nrendering the vomiting free and easy, partly by converting the alkali\r\ninto a soap. It must be given in large quantity, several pounds being\r\ncommonly required.[446] For the subsequent treatment the reader may\r\nconsult the paper of Mr. Dewar, which contains many useful hints on the\r\nmanagement of the most complex description of cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n                  OF POISONING WITH NITRATE OF POTASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _nitrate of potass_ [nitre, saltpetre, sal-prunelle], is a dangerous\r\npoison. It has been often mistaken for the saline laxatives, especially\r\nthe sulphate of soda, and has thus been the source of fatal accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n       SECTION I.—_Of the Chemical Tests for Nitrate of Potass._\r\n\r\nIt exists in commerce and the arts in two forms, fused and crystallized.\r\nThe fused nitre [sal-prunelle] is sold in little button-shaped masses,\r\nspheres of the size of musket-balls, or larger circular cakes, of a\r\nsnow-white tint. The crystallized salt [sal-petre] is sold in whitish,\r\nsulcated crystals, which are often regular and large. They are six-sided\r\nprisms, more or lest flattened, and terminated by two converging planes.\r\nIn both forms nitre has a peculiar, cool, but sharp taste.\r\n\r\nIts chemical properties are characteristic. In the solid form, it\r\nanimates the combustion of burning fuel, and yields nitrous fumes when\r\nheated with strong sulphuric acid. In solution it is precipitated yellow\r\nby the chloride of platinum, and yields, when not greatly diluted, a\r\ncrystalline precipitate with perchloric acid. The crude salt of commerce\r\ncontains chloride of sodium; and hence the odour disengaged by sulphuric\r\nacid may be mixed with that of chlorine or hydrochloric acid gas. When\r\nmixed with any vegetable or animal infusion by which it is coloured,\r\ncrystals may sometimes be easily procured in a state of sufficient\r\npurity by filtration and evaporation. But if not, then the same process\r\nmust be resorted to with that formerly recommended for nitric acid (p.\r\n143), the first step of neutralization with potass being of course\r\ndispensed with.—A process nearly the same with this has been suggested\r\nby M. Kramer of Milan. He proposes to free the liquid in part of animal\r\nmatter by adding acetate of lead, transmitting sulphuretted-hydrogen\r\nthrough the filtered fluid to remove any excess of lead, boiling the\r\nfluid after another filtration, and then proceeding with acetate of\r\nsilver to remove chlorides, as in the process I have adopted. In this\r\nway he found nitre even in the blood.[447]\r\n\r\n\r\n  SECTION II.—_Of the Action of Nitrate of Potass and its Symptoms in\r\n                                 Man._\r\n\r\nThis substance forms an exception to the general law formerly laid down\r\nwith regard to the effect of chemical neutralization on the local\r\nirritants. Both its acid and its alkali are simple irritants; yet the\r\ncompound salt, though certainly much inferior in power, is still\r\nenergetic. Nay, the experiment of Orfila and the particulars of some\r\nrecently published cases tend even to prove, that the action of its\r\nalkali and acid is materially altered in kind by their combination with\r\none another; for, besides inflaming the part to which it is applied,\r\nnitre has at times produced symptoms of a secondary disorder of the\r\nbrain and nerves.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Orfila upon dogs show that on these animals it has a\r\ntwofold action, the one irritating, the other narcotic. He found that an\r\nounce and a half killed a dog in ninety minutes when the gullet was\r\ntied, and a drachm another in twenty-nine hours: that death was preceded\r\nby giddiness, slight convulsions, dilated pupil, insensibility and\r\npalsy; that after death the stomach was externally livid, internally\r\nreddish-black, and the heart filled in its left cavities with florid\r\nblood; that when the gullet was not tied the animals recovered after\r\nseveral attacks of vomiting, and general indisposition for twenty-four\r\nhours; and that when the salt was applied externally to a wound it\r\nexcited violent inflammation, passing on to gangrene, but without any\r\nsymptom which indicated a remote or indirect operation.[448] Mr. Blake\r\nfound that this salt, when injected into the veins of a dog in the dose\r\nof fifteen grains dissolved in twenty-four parts of water, causes sudden\r\ndepression and arrestment of the action of the heart, and death in less\r\nthan a minute; but that, like other salts of potash, it has no influence\r\non the capillaries of the lungs, though a powerful effect in obstructing\r\nthe systemic capillary system.[449]—When taken in the ordinary way, it\r\nis absorbed in the course of its action, and has been detected both in\r\nthe blood and the urine by Kramer of Milan.[450]\r\n\r\nAs to its effects on man, it must first be observed, that considerable\r\ndoses are necessary to cause serious mischief. In the quantity of one,\r\ntwo, or three scruples, it is given medicinally several times a day\r\nwithout injury; and Dr. Alexander found by experiments on himself, that\r\nan ounce and a half, if largely diluted, might thus be safely\r\nadministered in the course of twenty-four hours.[451] Sometimes, too,\r\neven large single doses have been swallowed with impunity. A gentleman\r\nof my acquaintance once took nearly an ounce by mistake for Glauber’s\r\nsalt, and retained it above a quarter of an hour: nevertheless, except\r\nseveral attacks of vomiting, no unpleasant symptom was induced. M.\r\nTourtelle has even related an instance where two ounces were retained\r\naltogether and caused only moderate griping, with considerable purging\r\nand flow of urine.[452] Resting on such facts as these Tourtelle, with\r\nsome physicians in more recent times,[453] has maintained that nitre is\r\nnot a worse poison than other saline laxatives; and some practitioners\r\nof the present day have consequently ventured to administer it for the\r\ncure of diseases, in the quantity of half an ounce in one dose.[454] It\r\nis not easy to say, why these large doses are at times borne by the\r\nstomach without injury,—whether the cause is idiosyncrasy, or a\r\nconstitutional insensibility engendered by disease, or some difference\r\nin the mode of administering the salt. But at all events, the facts\r\nwhich follow will leave no doubt that in general it is a dangerous and\r\nrapid poison in the dose of an ounce.\r\n\r\nDr. Alexander found that, in the quantity of a drachm or a drachm and a\r\nhalf, recently dissolved in four ounces of water, and repeated every\r\nninety minutes, the third or fourth dose caused chilliness and stinging\r\npains in the stomach and over the whole body; and these sensations\r\nbecame so severe with the fourth dose, that he considered it unsafe to\r\nattempt a fifth.[455]\r\n\r\nTwo cases which were actually fatal have been described in the Journal\r\nde Médecine for 1787, the one caused by one ounce, the other by an ounce\r\nand a half. In the latter the symptoms were those of the most violent\r\ncholera, and the patient died in two days and a half;[456] in the former\r\ndeath took place in three hours only, and in addition to the symptoms\r\nremarked in the other there were convulsions and twisting of the\r\nmouth.[457] In both the pulse failed at the wrist, and a great tendency\r\nto fainting prevailed for some time before death. Dr. Geoghegan has\r\ncommunicated to Mr. Taylor a case where an ounce and a half taken by\r\nmistake caused severe pain in the stomach, vomiting, and death in two\r\nhours.[458]\r\n\r\nSimilar effects have been remarked in several cases which have been\r\nfollowed by recovery. A woman in the second month of pregnancy,\r\nimmediately after taking a handful of nitre in solution, was attacked\r\nwith pain in the stomach, swelling of the whole body and general pains;\r\nshe then miscarried, and afterwards had the usual symptoms of gastritis\r\nand dysentery, united with great giddiness, ringing in the ears, general\r\ntremors and excessive chilliness. She seems to have made a narrow\r\nescape, as for three days the discharges by stool were profuse, and\r\ncomposed chiefly of blood and membranous flakes.[459] Dr. Falconer has\r\nrelated another instance, where also the patient’s life seems to have\r\nbeen in great danger. The quantity taken was two ounces, and it was\r\nswallowed in half a pint of warm water by mistake instead of a laxative\r\nsalt. Violent pain in the belly was immediately produced, in half an\r\nhour frequent vomiting, and in three hours a discharge of about a quart\r\nof blood from the stomach. After the administration of gruel and butter\r\nthe symptoms began to subside; but they receded slowly; and even six\r\nmonths afterwards the man, though otherwise in good health, had frequent\r\npain in the stomach and flatulence.[460] In the case of a female in the\r\nsecond month of pregnancy, described by Dr. Butter, miscarriage did not\r\ntake place, although the symptoms were very violent and lasting. The\r\nquantity taken was two ounces. The symptoms were first bloody vomiting,\r\nafterwards dysentery, which continued seven days; and on the tenth day a\r\nnervous affection supervened exactly like chorea, and of two months’\r\nduration.[461] The effects of the poison in the latter period of this\r\nwoman’s illness tend to establish the existence of a secondary operation\r\non the nervous system. But this kind of action is more strongly pointed\r\nout by the following cases. Three puerperal women in the Obstetric\r\nHospital of Pavia got each an ounce of nitre by mistake for sulphate of\r\nmagnesia. Two, who vomited immediately, did not suffer. The third, who\r\nretained the salt fifteen minutes, had pain in the stomach and vomiting,\r\nfollowed by paleness of the countenance, stiffness of the jaw, some\r\nstupor, and convulsive movements of the limbs; which symptoms continued\r\ntill next day, when she gradually recovered.[462] A German physician,\r\nDr. Geiseler, met with an instance, in which the only disorder produced\r\nappeared to depend on derangement of the cerebral functions. A woman,\r\nafter swallowing an ounce of nitre instead of Glauber’s salt, lost the\r\nuse of speech and the power of voluntary motion, then became insensible,\r\nand was attacked with tetanic spasms. This state lasted till next day,\r\nwhen some amelioration was brought about by copious sweating. It was\r\nnot, however, till eight days after, that she recovered her speech, or\r\nthe entire use of her mental faculties; and the palsy of the limbs\r\ncontinued two months.[463] Her case resembles the account given by\r\nOrfila of the effects of nitre on animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n SECTION III.—_Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Nitrate of Potass._\r\n\r\nThe morbid appearances observed in man are solely those of violent\r\ninflammation of the stomach and intestines. In Laflize’s case, which\r\nproved fatal in three hours, the stomach was distended, and the contents\r\ndeeply tinged with blood; its peritonæal coat of a dark-red colour\r\nmottled with black spots; its villous coat very much inflamed and\r\ndetached in several places. The liquid contents gave satisfactory\r\nevidence of nitre having been swallowed; for a portion evaporated to\r\ndryness deflagrated with burning charcoal. In Souville’s patient, who\r\nlived sixty hours, the stomach was every where red, in many places\r\ncheckered with black spots, and at the centre of one of these spots the\r\nstomach was perforated by a small aperture. The whole intestinal canal\r\nwas also red. In Dr. Geoghegan’s case, the stomach contained bloody\r\nmucus, and its villous coat was brownish-red, and here and there\r\ndetached. He could not detect any nitre in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n          OF POISONING WITH THE ALKALINE AND EARTHY CHLORIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the _chlorides_ of _soda_, _potass_, and\r\n_lime_ are active poisons; but the first two have alone been hitherto\r\ncarefully investigated by physiological experiments.\r\n\r\nThe two alkaline chlorides are usually seen in the form of colourless\r\nsolutions. That of potass is little known in this country; but that of\r\nsoda is familiar to all in the shape of Fincham’s chloride of soda or\r\nbleaching liquid. The chloride of lime, which is best known of them all,\r\nis usually in the form of a dry powder, deliquescent, and acrid,\r\ncommonly termed bleaching powder. All these substances are easily known\r\nby their peculiar odour of chlorine, and the copious disengagement of\r\nthat gas on the addition of sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nThe action of chloride of soda on the animal body has been examined by\r\nSegalas, who infers that it is an irritant poison, which, however, at\r\ntimes occasions symptoms of an affection of the nervous system. He\r\nremarked that three ounces of the solution, commonly sold in Paris under\r\nthe name of Labarraque’s disinfecting liquid, caused immediate death by\r\ncoagulating the blood in the heart, when injected into a vein in a dog.\r\nTwo ounces introduced into the peritonæum excited palpitation, oppressed\r\nbreathing, constant restlessness, and death in ten minutes; and three\r\ndrachms did not prove fatal for some hours, tetanic spasms being\r\nproduced in the first instance, and peritonæal inflammation being found\r\nafter death. One ounce introduced into the stomach of a dog excited\r\nimmediate vomiting, and no farther inconvenience; and two ounces\r\nretained by a ligature on the gullet brought on violent efforts to\r\nvomit, from which the animal was gradually recovering, when it was\r\nkilled in twenty-four hours for the sake of observing the appearances.\r\nThe stomach was found generally inflamed and interspersed with dark,\r\ngangrenous-like spots.[464]\r\n\r\nI am not acquainted with any case of poisoning with these substances in\r\nthe human subject. But it is probable that symptoms of pure irritation\r\nand inflammation will occur, and that moderate doses may prove fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n                        OF POISONING WITH LIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nLime, the last poison of the present group, is a substance of little\r\ninterest to the toxicologist, as its activity is not great.\r\n\r\nIts physical and chemical properties need not be minutely described. It\r\nis soluble, though sparingly, in water; and the solution turns the\r\nvegetable blues green, restores the purple of reddened litmus, gives a\r\nwhite precipitate with a stream of carbonic acid gas, and with oxalic\r\nacid a very insoluble precipitate, which is not redissolved by an excess\r\nof the test.\r\n\r\nIts action is purely irritant. Orfila has found that a drachm and a half\r\nof unslaked lime, given to a little dog, caused vomiting and slight\r\nsuffering for a day only, but that three drachms killed the same animal\r\nin five days, vomiting, languor, and whining being the only symptoms,\r\nand redness of the throat, gullet, and stomach, the only morbid\r\nappearances.[465]\r\n\r\nThough a feeble poison, it has nevertheless proved fatal in the human\r\nsubject. Gmelin takes notice of the case of a boy who swallowed some\r\nlime in an apple-pie, and died in nine days, affected with thirst,\r\nburning in the mouth, burning pain in the belly, and obstinate\r\nconstipation.[466] A short account of a case of this kind of poisoning\r\nis also given by Balthazar Timæus. A young woman, afflicted with pica or\r\ndepraved appetite, took to the eating of quicklime; and in consequence\r\nshe was attacked with pain and gnawing in the belly, sore throat,\r\ndryness of the mouth, insatiable thirst, difficult breathing and cough;\r\nbut she recovered.[467] It is well known that quicklime also inflames\r\nthe skin or even destroys its texture, apparently by withdrawing the\r\nwater which forms a component part of all soft animal tissues. When\r\nthrown into the eyes it causes acute and obstinate ophthalmia, which may\r\nend in loss of sight. On this account it will belong, I presume, to the\r\npoisons included in the Scottish act against disfiguring or maiming with\r\ncorrosives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n                OF POISONING WITH AMMONIA AND ITS SALTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second group of the order of alkaline poisons, including ammonia\r\nwith its salts, and the sulphuret of potass, have a double action on the\r\nsystem, analogous to that possessed by many metallic poisons. They are\r\npowerful irritants; but they produce besides, through the medium of the\r\nblood, a disorder of some part of the nervous system; and their remote\r\nis sometimes more dangerous than their local action. The nervous\r\naffection produced by ammonia and the sulphuret of potass closely\r\nresembles tetanus, and therefore depends probably on irritation of the\r\nspinal column.\r\n\r\n_Of the Chemical tests for the Ammoniacal Salts._—Ammonia is when pure a\r\ngaseous body; but as commonly seen, it exists in solution in water,\r\nwhich dissolves it in large quantity. The solution has the usual effects\r\nof alkalis on vegetable colours, with the difference, however,—that the\r\nchanges of colour are not permanent under the action of heat. It forms a\r\nyellow precipitate, as potass does, with chloride of platinum. It may at\r\nonce be distinguished from other fluids by its peculiar pungent odour,\r\nwhich is possessed by no other substance except its carbonate.\r\n\r\nVarious _carbonates_ are known in chemistry, but the only one known in\r\ncommerce or met with in the shops is the sesqui-carbonate\r\n(subcarbonate—smelling salt—volatile salt—hartshorn). It is solid,\r\nwhite, fibrous, and has the same odour as pure ammonia. Its solution\r\ndiffers little in physical properties from the pure liquid ammonia; but,\r\nunlike it, is precipitated by the salts of lime.\r\n\r\nThe _hydrochlorate_ (muriate of ammonia—sal-ammoniac)—is known by its\r\nsolid, white, crystalline appearance; its ductility; its volatility; and\r\nby the effect of caustic potass and nitrate of silver, the former of\r\nwhich disengages an ammoniacal odour, while the latter causes in a\r\nsolution of the salt a white precipitate, the chloride of silver.\r\n\r\n_Of the action of the Ammoniacal Salts, and their effects on man._—To\r\ndetermine the action of ammonia on the animal system, Professor Orfila\r\ninjected sixty grains of the pure solution into the jugular vein of a\r\ndog. Immediately the whole legs were spasmodically extended; at times\r\nconvulsions occurred; and in ten minutes it died. The chest being laid\r\nopen instantly, coagulated florid blood was seen in the left ventricle,\r\nand black fluid blood in the right ventricle of the heart. No unusual\r\nappearance was discernible any where else except complete exhaustion of\r\nmuscular irritability.[468] The experiments of Mr. Blake also show that\r\nammonia introduced in large doses into the veins acts by suddenly\r\nextinguishing the irritability of the heart. Small doses first lower\r\narterial pressure from debility of the heart’s action, and then increase\r\nit by obstructing the systemic capillaries. When injected into the aorta\r\nfrom the axillary artery, it causes great increase of arterial pressure,\r\nowing to the latter cause; and then arrests the heart, while the\r\nrespiration goes on. Four seconds are sufficient for the ammonia to pass\r\nfrom the jugular vein into the heart, so as to be discovered there by\r\nmuriatic acid causing white fumes.[469] Half a drachm of a strong\r\nsolution, introduced by Orfila into the stomach of a dog and secured by\r\na ligature on the gullet, caused at first much agitation. But in five\r\nminutes the animal became still and soporose; after five hours it\r\ncontinued able to walk; in twenty hours it was found quite comatose; and\r\ndeath ensued in four hours more. The only morbid appearance was slight\r\nmottled redness of the villous coat of the stomach. A third dog, to\r\nwhich two drachms and a half of the common carbonate were given in fine\r\npowder, died in twelve minutes. First it vomited; next it became\r\nslightly convulsed; and the convulsions gradually increased in strength\r\nand frequency till the whole body was agitated by dreadful spasms; then\r\nthe limbs became rigid, the body and head were bent backwards, and in\r\nthis state it expired, apparently suffocated in a fit of tetanus.[470]\r\n\r\nSeveral cases of poisoning with ammonia or its carbonate have occurred\r\nin the human subject. Plenck has noticed shortly a case which proved\r\nfatal in four minutes, and which was caused by a little bottleful of\r\nammonia having been poured into the mouth of a man who had been bitten\r\nby a mad-dog.[471] The symptoms are not mentioned, but it is probable,\r\nfrom the rapidity of the poisoning, that a nervous affection must have\r\nbeen induced. More generally, however, the effects are simply irritant;\r\nand the seat of the irritation will vary with the mode in which the\r\npoison is given. If it is swallowed, the stomach and intestines will\r\nsuffer; if it is imprudently inhaled in too great quantity, inflammation\r\nof the lining membrane of the nostrils and air-passages will ensue.\r\nHuxham has related a very interesting example of the former affection,\r\nas it occurred in a young man, who had acquired a strange habit of\r\nchewing the solid carbonate of the shops. He was seized with great\r\nhemorrhage from the nose, gums, and intestines; his teeth dropt out;\r\nwasting and hectic fever ensued; and, although he was at length\r\nprevailed on to abandon his pernicious habit, he died of extreme\r\nexhaustion, after lingering several months.[472] But the most frequent\r\ncases of poisoning with ammonia have arisen from its being inhaled, and\r\nthus exciting bronchial inflammation. An instructive instance of the\r\nkind has been related by M. Nysten. A medical man, liable to epilepsy,\r\nwas found in a fit by his servant, who ignorantly tried to rouse him by\r\nholding assiduously to his nostrils a handkerchief dipped in ammonia. In\r\nthis way about two drachms appear to have been consumed. On recovering\r\nhis senses, the gentleman complained of burning pain from the mouth\r\ndownwards to the stomach, great difficulty in swallowing, difficult\r\nbreathing, hard cough, and copious expectoration, profuse mucous\r\ndischarge from the nostrils, and excoriation of the tongue. The\r\nbronchitis increased steadily, and carried him off in the course of the\r\nthird day, without convulsions or any mental disorder having\r\nsupervened.[473] A case precisely similar is related in the Edinburgh\r\nMedical and Surgical Journal. A lad, while convalescent from an attack\r\nof fever, was seized with epilepsy, for which his attendant applied\r\nammonia under his nose “with such unwearied, but destructive\r\nbenevolence, that suffocation had almost resulted. As it was, dyspnœa\r\nwith severe pain of the throat and breast, immediately succeeded; and\r\ndeath took place forty-eight hours afterwards.”[474] A third instance\r\nhas been recorded of analogous effects produced by the incautious use of\r\nammonia as an antidote for prussic acid. The patient had all the\r\nsymptoms of a violent bronchitis, accompanied with redness and scattered\r\nulceration of the mouth and throat; but he recovered in thirteen\r\ndays.[475] A fourth case, similar to the preceding, has been related by\r\nM. Souchard of Batignolles. A druggist, who inhaled while asleep the\r\nfumes of ammonia from a broken carboy, awoke in three-quarters of an\r\nhour, with the mucous membrane of the mouth and nostrils corroded, and a\r\nbloody discharge from the nose. A severe attack of bronchitis followed,\r\nduring which he could not speak for six days; but being actively treated\r\nwith antiphlogistic remedies, he recovered.[476]—An extraordinary case\r\nhas been published by Mr. Paget of death from injecting ammonia into the\r\nblood-vessels. A solution weak enough to allow of the nose being held\r\nover it was injected into a nævis in a child two years old. An attack of\r\nconvulsions immediately followed, and in a minute the child\r\nexpired.[477]\r\n\r\nNysten’s case is the only one in the human subject in which the _morbid\r\nappearances_ were ascertained. The nostrils were blocked up with an\r\nalbuminous membrane. The whole mucous coat of the larynx, trachea,\r\nbronchi, and even of some of the bronchial ramifications, was mottled\r\nwith patches of lymph. The gullet and stomach showed red streaks here\r\nand there; and there was a black eschar on the tongue, and another on\r\nthe lower lip.\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Hydrochlorate of Ammonia._—The effects of the\r\nhydrochlorate of ammonia on animals have been examined by Professor\r\nOrfila and Dr. Arnold; but I have not yet met with any instance of its\r\noperation as a poison on man. When given to dogs it irritates and\r\ninflames the parts it touches, and causes the ordinary symptoms of local\r\nirritation. But it also acts remotely. For, first, like arsenic, and\r\nother poisons of the third order of irritants, it produces inflammation\r\nof the stomach, in whatever way it is applied to the body,—Orfila having\r\nfound that organ affected when the salt was applied to the subcutaneous\r\ncellular tissue;[478] and, secondly, according to the experiments of\r\nArnold, it causes, when swallowed, excessive muscular weakness, slow\r\nbreathing, violent action of the heart, and tetanic spasms,—effects\r\nwhich cannot arise from mere injury of the stomach. Half a drachm will\r\nthus kill a rabbit in eight or ten minutes;[479] and two drachms a small\r\ndog in an hour.[480]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n               OF POISONING WITH THE ALKALINE SULPHURETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe liver of sulphur, or sulphuret of potass of the pharmacopœias, the\r\nlast poison of this order to be mentioned, is allied to the ammoniacal\r\nsalts in action. It is of no great consequence in a toxicological point\r\nof view in this country, being put to little use; but several accidents\r\nhave been caused by it in France, where it is employed for manufacturing\r\nartificial sulphureous waters; and farther, its properties should be\r\naccurately ascertained, because till lately it was erroneously resorted\r\nto as an antidote for some metallic poisons.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Tests._—It has a grayish, greenish, or yellowish colour when\r\nsolid; its dust smells of sulphuretted hydrogen, which is also\r\ncopiously disengaged from it by the mineral acids: and it forms with\r\nwater a yellow solution of the same odour.—In composite fluids it may\r\nbe detected by heating it with acetic acid, and passing the disengaged\r\ngases through solution of acetate of lead, in which a black\r\nprecipitate of sulphuret of lead is produced, from the action of\r\nsulphuretted-hydrogen.[481]\r\n\r\n_Action and Symptoms._—Orfila found that a solution of six drachms and a\r\nhalf, secured in the stomach of a dog by a ligature on the gullet,\r\ncaused death by tetanus in seven minutes, without leaving any morbid\r\nappearance in the body; that inferior doses caused death in the same\r\nmanner, but at a later period, and with symptoms of irritation in the\r\nalimentary canal, which also was seen red, black, or even ulcerated\r\nafter death; that a solution of twenty-two grains injected into the\r\njugular vein killed a dog in two minutes, convulsions having preceded\r\ndeath, and the heart being found paralysed immediately after it; and\r\nthat a drachm and a half thrust in small fragments under the skin\r\noccasioned death in thirteen hours with coma and extensive inflammation\r\nof the cellular tissue.[482] There can be no doubt, therefore, that\r\nliver of sulphur is a true narcotic acrid poison.—It is absorbed, and\r\nmay be detected in the blood, liver, kidneys, and urine by Orfila’s\r\nprocess.[483]\r\n\r\nOrfila has collected three cases of poisoning in the human subject with\r\nthis substance;[484] and a fourth has been related by M. Cayol.[485] Of\r\nthese cases two proved fatal in less than fifteen minutes; and the\r\nsymptoms were acrid taste, slight vomiting, mortal faintness, and\r\nconvulsions, with an important chemical sign, the tainting of the air\r\nwith the odour of sulphuretted-hydrogen. The dose in one case was about\r\nthree drachms. The two other patients, who recovered, were for some days\r\ndangerously ill. The symptoms were burning pain and constriction in the\r\nthroat, gullet, and stomach; frequent vomiting, at first sulphureous,\r\nafterwards sanguinolent; purging, at first sulphureous; sulphureous\r\nexhalations from the mouth; pulse at first quick and strong, afterwards\r\nfeeble, fluttering, and almost imperceptible; in one case sopor; finally\r\nsevere inflammation of the gullet, stomach and intestines, which abated\r\nin three days. One of these patients took four drachms of sulphuret of\r\nsoda, the other two ounces of sulphuret of potass; but it is probable,\r\nthat the latter dose was partly decomposed by long keeping.\r\n\r\n_Morbid Appearances._—The morbid appearances in the two fatal cases were\r\ngreat lividity of the face and extremities, and exhaustion of muscular\r\ncontractility immediately after death; the stomach was red internally,\r\nand lined with sulphur; the duodenum also red; the lungs soft, gorged\r\nwith black fluid blood, and not crepitant.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The most appropriate treatment consists in the instant\r\nadministration of any diluent, then of frequent doses of the chloride of\r\nsoda, and lastly the antiphlogistic mode of subduing inflammation. The\r\nchloride of soda or lime decomposes sulphuretted hydrogen, the\r\ndisengagement of which is the probable cause of death in the quickly\r\nfatal cases.[486]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n                       OF POISONING WITH ARSENIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third order of the irritant class of poisons includes the compounds\r\nof the metals. These are of great importance to the medical jurist. They\r\nare frequently used for criminal purposes; they give rise to the\r\ngreatest variety of symptoms; and the medical evidence on trials\r\nrespecting them, while much skill is required on the part of the witness\r\nto collect it, is also the most conclusive.\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred from their being arranged in the class of\r\nirritants that their action is merely local. In fact this is the case\r\nwith a very few of them only, which produce chemical corrosion. The\r\ngreater number likewise act indirectly on organs at a distance from the\r\npart to which they are applied. Nevertheless the most prominent symptoms\r\ngenerally produced by them are those of violent local irritation; so\r\nthat they may be justly considered in the place which has been assigned\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe poisons included in this order are the oxides and salts of arsenic,\r\nmercury, copper, antimony, tin, silver, gold, bismuth, iron, chrome,\r\nzinc, barium, lead. Many other metals also form poisonous compounds with\r\nvarious acids and other bodies; but these are so rare as to be merely\r\nobjects of physiological curiosity.\r\n\r\nOf all the varieties of death by poison, none is so important to the\r\nmedical jurist as poisoning with arsenic. On account of the shameful\r\nfacility with which it may be procured in this country, even by the\r\nlowest of the vulgar, and the ease with which it may be secretly\r\nadministered, it is the poison most frequently chosen for the purpose of\r\ncommitting both suicide and murder. In 1837 and 1838 no fewer than 186\r\ncases of fatal poisoning with arsenic were known to have occurred in\r\nEngland alone (see p. 90). Of 221 cases of murder by poison in France\r\nduring ten years subsequent to 1829, in which the poison given was\r\nascertained, there were 149 where the substance administered was\r\narsenic.[487] It is fortunate, therefore, that there are few substances\r\nin nature, and perhaps hardly any other poison, whose presence can be\r\ndetected in such minute quantities and with so great certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SECTION I.—_Of the Chemical Tests for the Compounds of Arsenic._\r\n\r\nMetallic arsenic has an iron-gray colour, a specific gravity of 8·308,\r\nand a crystalline fracture. It is very brittle. It has a strong tendency\r\nto oxidate, so that it undergoes this change in air, in water, and even\r\nin alcohol. In air, particularly when moist, it becomes rapidly\r\ntarnished, a black powder being formed, which some have regarded as a\r\nregular protoxide.[488]—When exposed to heat, metallic arsenic is\r\nusually said to sublime at the temperature of 356° F.; but according to\r\nsome late experiments by Dr. Mitchell of Philadelphia this does not\r\nhappen under a low red heat, luminous in the dark.[489] In close vessels\r\nit condenses unchanged; but when heated in the open air, it passes to\r\nthe state of white oxide, and rises in white fumes. This substance is a\r\nsesquioxide, consisting of two equivalents of metal and three of oxygen.\r\nAnother oxide likewise exists, which contains two equivalents of metal\r\nand five of oxygen, and, possessing strong acid properties, is\r\ndenominated arsenic acid. The sesquioxide and arsenic acid unite with\r\nbases, and produce compounds which, with the exception of those they\r\nform with the alkalis, are mostly insoluble. Metallic arsenic unites\r\nwith sulphur in two proportions, forming an orange-red and a\r\nsulphur-yellow compound. The compounds of arsenic have very little\r\nchemical action with vegetable and animal principles.\r\n\r\nOf the compounds which arsenic thus forms, those which it will be\r\nnecessary to particularize are the following:—1. The protoxide of\r\nBerzelius, or _fly-powder_. 2. The arsenious acid, or _white arsenic_.\r\n3. The arsenite of copper, or _mineral green_. 4. The arsenite of potass\r\nas contained in _Fowler’s solution_. 5. The arsenite of potass; 6. The\r\nvarious sulphurets, pure and impure, namely, _realgar_, _orpiment_, and\r\n_king’s yellow_; and 7. Arseniuretted-hydrogen gas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Of the Tests for Fly-powder._\r\n\r\nThis substance is rarely known as a poison in Britain, but is a familiar\r\npoison in France and Germany, under the names of _Poudre à mouches_, and\r\n_Fliegenstein_. Of late it has been occasionally used in Scotland for\r\npoisoning rats.\r\n\r\nIt is a fine grayish-black powder, formed by exposing powdered arsenic\r\nfor a long time to the air; but it also frequently contains fragments of\r\nthe metal. It is usually considered by chemists to be a mixture of\r\nmetallic arsenic and its white oxide.\r\n\r\nIt is acted on by water, the white oxide being found ere long in\r\nsolution by its proper tests. Oxidation and solution, however, are also\r\neffected upon pure metallic arsenic in the same manner. A thousand\r\ngrains of water take up a grain in the course of half an hour when\r\nboiled on the metal.[490]\r\n\r\nA very simple and decisive test for fly-powder is derived from the\r\neffect of heat. If it is heated in a tube two substances are sublimed,\r\nfirst a white crystalline powder, and then a bright metallic crust, the\r\nformer being the white oxide, the latter the metal. The metallic crust\r\nthus formed possesses physical properties, which distinguish arsenic\r\nfrom all other substances, capable of being sublimed by a low heat: The\r\nsurface next the tube is very like polished steel, being a little darker\r\nin colour, but equal in brilliancy and polish; and the inner surface is\r\neither brilliantly crystalline to the naked eye, like the fracture of\r\ncast-iron, or has a dull grayish-white colour, but appears crystalline\r\nbefore a common magnifying lens of four or five powers. If these\r\ncharacters be attended to, particularly the appearance of the inner\r\nsurface, it appears to me scarcely possible to mistake for an arsenical\r\ncrust any other substance which can be sublimed by any of the methods\r\nfor subliming arsenic.\r\n\r\nIf a farther test should be desired, it is only necessary, as was first\r\nproposed by Dr. Turner of London,[491] to chase the crust up and down\r\nthe tube with the spirit-lamp flame till it is all oxidated, when little\r\noctaedral crystals of adamantine lustre are formed, on which, either\r\nwith the naked eye or with the aid of a common lens, triangular facettes\r\nmay be distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe niceties to be attended to in applying the preceding tests will be\r\nconsidered presently under the head of the next compound, the\r\nsesquioxide.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 2. _Of the Tests for Arsenious Acid._\r\n\r\nArsenious acid, the sesquioxide, or white oxide of arsenic, usually\r\ncalled white arsenic, or simply arsenic, is the most common and\r\nimportant of all the arsenical preparations.\r\n\r\nIt is met with in the shops in two forms,—as a snow-white gritty powder,\r\nand in solid masses generally opaque, but sometimes translucent. When\r\nnewly sublimed it is in translucent or even almost transparent masses of\r\na vitreous lustre, conchoidal fracture and sharp-edged. By keeping it\r\nbecomes opaque and white. The nature of the change has not been\r\ndetermined; but some alteration is certainly effected, for Guibourt, who\r\nhas examined both varieties with care, found that the opaque variety is\r\nmore soluble in water than the other. He adds that the former is\r\nalkaline, the latter acid, in its action on litmus paper; but I have\r\nalways found the opaque variety acid.[492] The powder soon becomes\r\nanalogous to the opaque variety of the oxide in mass.\r\n\r\nThe oxide of arsenic has a specific gravity of 3·729, according to the\r\nexperiments of Dr. Ure,—of 3·529 when opaque, according to Mr. Alfred\r\nTaylor, and 3·798, when translucent. Very incorrect notions prevail as\r\nto its taste. It was long universally believed to be acrid,[493] and is\r\ndescribed to be so in many systematic works and express treatises; but\r\nin reality it has little or no taste at all. The reader will find some\r\ndetails on this point in a paper I published in the Edinburgh Medical\r\nand Surgical Journal.[494] In the present work it is sufficient to\r\nobserve, that I have repeatedly made the trial, and seen it made at my\r\nrequest by several scientific friends, and that, after continuing the\r\nexperiment as long, and extending the poison along the tongue as far\r\nback, as we thought safe, all agreed that it had scarcely any taste at\r\nall,—perhaps towards the close a very faint sweetish taste. It appears\r\nto me that the experiments made on that occasion might have set at rest\r\nthe question as to the taste of arsenic, and corrected an important\r\nerror long committed by systematic authors in chemistry as well as\r\nmedical jurisprudence. And accordingly in this country the truth is\r\ngenerally known.[495] Professor Orfila, however, continues to repeat the\r\nerror; for even in the last edition of his Toxicologie he says it has “a\r\nrough, not corrosive, slightly styptic taste, perceptible not for a few\r\nseconds, but persistent, and attended with salivation.”[496] These\r\nsensations must be either imaginary or the indications of an organ\r\npeculiarly constituted. It is impossible to make satisfactory\r\nexperiments with safety on its impressions on the back of the palate.\r\nBut we may rest assured that in general it makes no impression there at\r\nall; for it has been often swallowed unknowingly with articles of food.\r\nNot a few have in such circumstances noticed merely its grittiness, and\r\nthought there was sand in their food. Two instances only am I hitherto\r\nacquainted with, where an acrid sensation would seem really to have been\r\nexperienced in the act of eating or swallowing. In one of these, noticed\r\nin Rust’s Journal, the individual who was poisoned, could not finish the\r\npoisoned dish on account of its unpleasant, very peppery taste.[497] In\r\nthe other case, which was lately communicated to me by Mr. Hewson of\r\nLincoln, the individual, who was poisoned by arsenic dissolved in his\r\ntea-kettle,—happening in the first instance to wash his mouth with the\r\nwater,—observed at the time to his daughter, that it had a very odd\r\ntaste; which subsequently was called a burning taste. These facts,\r\nhowever, are evidently not altogether satisfactory. It is not improbable\r\nthat, in an _ex post facto_ description, the reporters, as others in the\r\nsame circumstances have clearly done[498], confounded the subsequent\r\ninflammation with mere taste in the act of chewing or swallowing. At all\r\nevents it is absolutely certain that the great majority of people who\r\nhave been poisoned with arsenic remarked in taking it either no taste at\r\nall, or merely a roughness owing to the gritty condition of its powder.\r\n\r\nThe oxide of arsenic when subjected to heat is sublimed at 380°, or,\r\naccording to Dr. Mitchell, 425° F.[499] and condenses in the form of a\r\ncrystalline powder, which, if the operation is performed slowly and on a\r\nsmall quantity proportioned to the size of the tube, evidently consists\r\nof little, adamantine octaedres.—When it is mixed with carbonaceous\r\nmatter and heated, it is reduced, and the metal is sublimed. This\r\nconstitutes the test of reduction, which, when conducted with due care,\r\nmay be rendered singly a certain proof of the presence of arsenic.\r\n\r\nWater dissolves it. Its solubility is a point of some medico-legal\r\nimportance; for a doubt may arise whether the quantity of a solution\r\nthat has been swallowed contained a sufficient dose to cause severe\r\nsymptoms or death. Different statements have gone forth on this head.\r\nKlaproth found, that a thousand parts of temperate water take up only\r\ntwo parts and a half,—and that a thousand parts of boiling water take up\r\n77·75 parts or a thirteenth, and retain on cooling 30 parts or a\r\nthirty-third of their weight.[500] Guibourt found a difference between\r\nthe transparent and opaque varieties; for a thousand parts of temperate\r\nwater dissolved in thirty-six hours 9·6 of the transparent, 12·5 of the\r\nopaque variety; and the same quantity of boiling water dissolved of the\r\ntransparent variety 97 parts, retaining 18 when cooled, but of the\r\nopaque variety took up 115 and retained on cooling 29.[501] More lately\r\nMr. Alfred Taylor observed that temperate water, simply poured on the\r\nopaque oxide and left for seventy-two hours, contained one grain in a\r\nthousand, but if often agitated, 8·5 grains; that boiling water,\r\noccasionally agitated for the same period, contained 9·27 or 9·54\r\ngrains; that water, boiling gently for an hour dissolved 31·5, and on\r\ncooling and resting for three days retained 17; that with violent\r\nebullition for an hour, it took up 46·3, and retained 24·7 grains on\r\ncooling and resting for three days; that a saturated boiling solution\r\nafter six months contained 24 or 26 grains; and that a saturated boiling\r\nsolution of the transparent oxide contained 46 or 47·5 grains, and on\r\ncooling and resting for two days retained 18·7 or 13·4 grains.[502] It\r\nis impossible to account for these discrepancies; for all the\r\nexperimentalists conducted their investigations with care, and with a\r\nview to the medico-legal question stated above. Hahnemann farther\r\nremarked, that at the temperature of the blood a thousand parts of water\r\ndissolve ten parts with the aid of ten minutes’ agitation;[503] and\r\nNavier, that boiling water kept for an hour on it, and decanted off in\r\nthe way an infusion is usually made, dissolves 12·5 grains in every\r\nthousand.[504]\r\n\r\nIts solubility is impaired by the presence of organic principles. When\r\nmixed with mucus or milk it dissolves, according to Hahnemann, with\r\ngreat difficulty; and I have found that a cup of tea, left beside the\r\nfire at a temperature of 200° for half an hour upon two grains of the\r\noxide, does not take up entirely even that small quantity. An important\r\nconsequence of the fact now mentioned is, that when swallowed in the\r\nsolid state, little or no arsenic may be found in the fluid contents of\r\nthe stomach. In a case which occurred to Scheele three grains of solid\r\narsenic were found in the contents, but hardly a trace in solution.[505]\r\nIt would be wrong, however, to suppose that it is never found in the\r\nfluid contents. For, not to mention the observations of others, I have\r\nmyself often detected it in the fluid part of the stomach in persons\r\npoisoned by arsenic.\r\n\r\nThe solution of oxide of arsenic in boiling water yields minute crystals\r\non cooling, which, when their form is defined, are octaedres. In this\r\nstate, on account of its whiteness and brilliancy, it exceedingly\r\nresembles pounded sugar. By spontaneous evaporation I have procured in\r\ntwelve months fine octaedres nearly as large as peas. These do not\r\nbecome opaque by keeping, like the sublimed masses.\r\n\r\nA difference of opinion prevails as to the action of the oxide on\r\nvegetable colours. This is a matter of no great consequence to the\r\nmedical jurist; but it is right not to leave a disputed point without\r\nsome notice. Guibourt says the transparent variety faintly reddens\r\nlitmus, while the opaque variety faintly restores to blue litmus\r\npreviously reddened.[506] My own experiments are at variance with these\r\nstatements: I have always found that the solution of the powder, which\r\nis of the opaque variety, faintly reddens litmus, and does not alter\r\nreddened litmus.\r\n\r\nThe remaining chemical properties of the oxide, which it is necessary\r\nfor the medical jurist to know, will be mentioned under what is now to\r\nbe said of the principal test by which its presence may be ascertained.\r\nUnder this head will be noticed, first the tests for the solid oxide,\r\nsecondly, those for its solution, and lastly, the method of detecting it\r\nwhen mingled with vegetable or animal solids and fluids, such as the\r\ncontents and tissues of the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Of the Tests for Arsenic in the solid state._\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic and simple test for oxide of arsenic in its\r\nsolid state, either pure or mixed or combined with inorganic substances,\r\nis its reduction to the metallic state.\r\n\r\nVarious methods have been at different times proposed for employing the\r\ntest of reduction. In the ruder periods of analytic chemistry we find\r\nHahnemann recommending a retort as the fittest instrument, and stating\r\nten grains as the least quantity he could detect.[507] Afterwards Dr.\r\nBlack substituted a small glass tube, coated with clay and heated in a\r\nchoffer; and in this way he could discover a single grain.[508] In a\r\npaper published in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, I showed\r\nhow to detect a sixteenth of a grain; and afterwards even so minute a\r\nquantity as a hundreth part of a grain.[509]\r\n\r\nThe process is performed in a glass tube; which, when the quantity of\r\nthe oxide is very small, should not exceed an eighth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, and may be conveniently used of the form first recommended by\r\nBerzelius, and represented in Fig. 3.—The best material for reducing the\r\noxide is recently ignited charcoal, if the quantity of suspected\r\nsubstance be very small. For when any of the ordinary alkaline fluxes is\r\nused, more than half of the arsenic is retained, probably in the form of\r\nan arseniuret of the alkaline metalloid. But when the quantity of matter\r\nfor analysis is considerable, charcoal is inconvenient, as it is apt to\r\nbe projected up the tube on the application of heat; and an alkaline\r\nflux is on that account preferable. For this purpose soda-flux,—made by\r\ngrinding crystals of carbonate of soda with an eighth of their weight of\r\ncharcoal, and then heating the mixture gradually to redness, so as to\r\ndrive off all water,—is better than the more familiar black flux, which\r\ncontains carbonate of potash; because the latter attracts much moisture\r\nwhen kept for some time.—If the quantity operated on is large it should\r\nbe mixed with the flux before being introduced into the tube; if it is\r\nsmall, it may be dropped into the tube and covered with charcoal. The\r\nmaterials are to be introduced along a little triangular gutter of stiff\r\npaper, if the tube is large; but with a small tube it is preferable to\r\nuse the little glass funnel represented in Fig. 2, to which a wire is\r\npreviously fitted, for pushing the matter down when it adheres. The\r\nmaterial should not be closely impacted. Heat is best applied with the\r\nspirit-lamp, first to the upper part of the material, with a small\r\nflame, and then to the bottom of the tube, the flame being previously\r\nenlarged. A little water, disengaged in the first instance, should be\r\nremoved with a roll of filtering paper, before a sufficient heat is\r\napplied to sublime the metal. As soon as the dark crust begins to form,\r\nthe tube should be held steady in the same part of the flame. With these\r\nprecautions a well defined crust will be procured with facility.\r\n\r\nThe characters of the crust have been mentioned already under the head\r\nof fly-powder (p. 199). They are distinct even in crusts weighing only a\r\n300th of a grain. A crust of this weight, a tenth of an inch broad and\r\nfour times as long, may show characteristically all the physical\r\ncharacters of an arsenical sublimate a hundred times larger.\r\n\r\nThe fallacies to which the test has been supposed to be liable\r\n(excluding at present that part of it which consists in the oxidation of\r\nthe metal, and which renders it quite unimpeachable), are the\r\nfollowing.— Dr. Paris says he has known an instance where a person, “by\r\nno means deficient in chemical address, mistook for it a deposit of\r\ncharcoal,”[510] and I have known the same mistake happen in the hands of\r\none of my pupils, a beginner in the study of medico-legal chemistry. The\r\nouter surface of a charcoal crust may be mistaken for arsenic by a\r\ncareless person; but with ordinary care it is quite impossible to err if\r\nthe inner surface be examined, for that of charcoal is brown, powdery,\r\nand perfectly dull.—It has been suggested to me and has been stated in\r\nprint,[511] that the preparations of antimony yield by reduction a\r\nsublimate resembling closely an arsenical crust. But in consequence of\r\nrepeated trials I am certain that no preparation of antimony, reduced\r\neither by charcoal or the black flux with the fullest red heat of the\r\nblowpipe will yield any metallic sublimate; and the same facts were\r\nobserved by the late Dr. Turner.—It has even been said by Mr. Donovan\r\nthat the action of the flux on glass which contains lead causes a stain\r\nsimilar to an arsenical crust.[512] If it be meant by this observation,\r\nthat the lead contained in the glass usually gives that part of the tube\r\nwhich contains the flux a glimmering appearance and impairs its\r\ntransparency, the author is correct: but it is impossible that a\r\nsublimate can be so formed.—Dr. Mitchell of Philadelphia in an elaborate\r\npaper on the process of reduction seems to consider the crust\r\nundistinguishable from that formed in similar circumstances by\r\ncinnabar.[513] Crusts of cinnabar, however, do not present the peculiar\r\ncharacter possessed by the internal surface of arsenic.—Zinc, it is\r\nsaid, may be sublimed in its metallic state; but the sublimation of zinc\r\nrequires a full white heat; which in the process for arsenic cannot be\r\ngenerated.—Tellurium, cadmium, and potassium sublime at a lower heat;\r\nbut these metals are so exceedingly rare, that it is quite unnecessary\r\nto particularize the characters of their sublimates.—Lastly, it is said\r\nthat a crust may be produced from arsenic contained in the glass of the\r\ntube. A few years ago MM. Ozanam and Idt of Lyons detected arsenic in\r\nthe remains of a body which had been seven years interred; but\r\nsubsequently M. Idt imagined he had discovered that the glass used in\r\nthe analysis contained arsenic, and yielded it by the process of\r\nreduction. He accordingly retracted his original opinion; and the person\r\naccused of administering the poison was acquitted. An extended inquiry,\r\nhowever, was in consequence undertaken by the Parisian Academy of\r\nMedicine at the request of the French government. And the result was\r\nthat no arsenic could be detected in the glass tubes used by MM. Ozanam\r\nand Idt; and that although arsenic is sometimes used in glass-making,\r\nand a trace of it may be retained in some opaque glasses or enamels, it\r\ncannot be detected by any process of analysis in any of the clear glass\r\nmet with in commerce,[514] the whole arsenic being volatilized during\r\nthe manufacture of the glass.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be safely laid down that the appearances exhibited by a\r\nwell-formed arsenical crust, even in the minute quantity of a 300th part\r\nof a grain, are imitated by no substance in nature which can be sublimed\r\nby the process for the reduction of arsenic.\r\n\r\nBut should farther evidence be required as to the nature of the crust,\r\nthis may be obtained by subjecting it to oxidation by heat.\r\n\r\nThe best method of doing so is to heat the ball containing the flux\r\ndeprived of arsenic, to attach a bit of glass tube to its end, and to\r\ndraw this gently off in the spirit-flame, taking care to prevent the\r\nflux being driven forward on the crust. This being done, the whole\r\ncrust, or, if it is large, a portion of it, is to be chased up and down\r\nthe tube with a small spirit-lamp flame till it is all converted into a\r\nwhite powder. In order to show the crystalline form of the powder\r\ndistinctly, let the flame be reduced to the volume of a pea by drawing\r\nin the wick, and let the part of the tube containing the oxide be held\r\nhalf an inch or an inch above it. By repeated trials sparkling crystals\r\nwill at length be formed, which are octaedres,—the crystalline form of\r\narsenious acid. The triangular facettes of the octaedres may be\r\nsometimes seen with the naked eye, though the original crust was only a\r\nfiftieth of a grain or even less; and they may be always seen with a\r\nlens of four powers, the tube being held between the eye and a lighted\r\ncandle or a ray of sunshine, either of which is preferable to diffuse\r\ndaylight for making this observation.—For the success of the oxidation\r\ntest it is indispensable that the inside of the tube be not soiled with\r\nan alkaline flux: because the alkali would unite with the oxide. It is\r\nalso requisite not to heat the tube suddenly to redness before the oxide\r\nis sublimed; because then the oxide is apt to unite with the glass,\r\nforming a white, opaque enamel. The physical characters of the sublimed\r\noxide are so delicate and precise, that they may be accurately\r\ndistinguished, even when those of the metallic crust are obscure, owing\r\nto its minuteness. Sometimes too, the metal may be so scanty that it is\r\noxidated at once in the act of subliming, and never presents the\r\nappearance of a metallic crust. Although the characters of the\r\ncrystalline oxide in either of these cases are very precise and\r\ndistinctive, it may be right to subject it to a farther test when the\r\nmetal is not previously exhibited with its characteristic properties.\r\nFor this purpose it is sufficient to cut away with a file the portion of\r\nthe tube which contains the sublimate, to boil it in another tube with a\r\nfew drops of distilled water till the sublimate disappear, and then to\r\ntest the solution with one of the fluid tests to be presently described,\r\nthe ammoniacal nitrate of silver.\r\n\r\nAfter all that has been recently written as to the old and newer\r\nprocesses for detecting arsenic, I must nevertheless avow my conviction,\r\nthat for solid arsenic no test is, for medico-legal purposes, at once so\r\nsatisfactory, convenient, and delicate as the test of reduction,\r\nespecially with the addition of the supplementary test of oxidation.\r\nThat other methods are still more delicate may be readily granted. But\r\nwhere the suspected substance is in the solid form, what possible\r\noccasion can there be for a method more delicate than one which will\r\ndetect a 300th part of a grain? A method ten times less so would meet\r\nevery case in actual practice.—A variety of supplementary tests have\r\nbeen proposed. But they are all greatly inferior in facility, or\r\nconclusiveness, or both, to the process of oxidation, and ought\r\ntherefore to be expelled from medico-legal practice,—not even excepting\r\nthe alliaceous odour of metallic arsenic in the act of subliming, a\r\ncharacter, the fallaciousness of which was long ago pointed out by\r\nmyself as well as others, and to which a preposterous importance has\r\nbeen attached in some late inquiries. The reader will find in the last\r\nedition of this work an attempt to estimate the value of various tests\r\nsupplementary to that of reduction. This disquisition is now omitted, as\r\nit seems no longer necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Of the Tests for Oxide of Arsenic in Solution._\r\n\r\nOxide of arsenic in a state of solution may be detected in one of four\r\nways; by what are called the liquid tests; by precipitating it with one\r\nof these, and subliming metallic arsenic from the precipitate, which\r\nmethod is usually termed the reduction process; by Marsh’s method, which\r\nconsists in disengaging it in the form of arseniuretted-hydrogen gas,\r\nand decomposing the gas by combustion; or by the method of Reinsch, in\r\nwhich metallic arsenic is deposited on the surface of copper, and then\r\nseparated by heat for farther examination.\r\n\r\n_Process by Liquid Reagents._—The first method is by the employment of\r\nseveral liquid tests, which cause in the solution peculiar precipitates.\r\nMany such tests have been proposed; but the most characteristic and\r\nprecise are _hydrosulphuric acid_, _ammoniacal nitrate of silver_, and\r\n_ammoniacal sulphate of copper_. The indications of each of the three\r\ntests must concur, otherwise, in a medico-legal case, no one can be\r\nentitled to speak with certainty to the existence of arsenic. But when\r\nthey do concur, the evidence is unimpeachable. When this method of\r\nanalysis is followed, corresponding experiments ought always to be made\r\nwith the water that is used for diluting or otherwise preparing the\r\nsubject of examination, or with distilled water, if the article be\r\nalready sufficiently aqueous. This precaution is necessary on account of\r\nthe risk of accidental impregnation of the water or other reagents with\r\narsenic.[515]\r\n\r\n_Hydrosulphuric acid_ [sulphuretted-hydrogen] is obtained by decomposing\r\nproto-sulphuret of iron with diluted sulphuric acid in such an apparatus\r\nas is represented at Fig. 5. And the gas may be either applied directly\r\nto the suspected fluid, or condensed in distilled water, and thus kept\r\nin store for occasional use in the liquid shape. Before applying this\r\ntest, the suspected fluid must be acidulated with acetic or hydrochloric\r\nacid; because an excess of alkali prevents the action. And if an acid be\r\nindicated by litmus in the fluid, neutralization, or slight\r\nsupersaturation, with potash must be effected, before adding acetic or\r\nhydrochloric acid; for if the acidity should happen to be owing to an\r\nexcess of sulphuric or nitric acid, the test is decomposed, and\r\nyellowish-white sulphur deposited.—These precautions being taken,\r\nhydrosulphuric acid occasions a sulphur-yellow or lemon-yellow\r\nprecipitate. If the arsenical solution, however, be very weak, a yellow\r\ncolour merely is struck, because the precipitate, which is\r\nsesqui-sulphuret of arsenic, is dissolved by the excess of the test; but\r\nit separates after ebullition, or a few hours’ exposure to the air.\r\nCo-existing animal and vegetable principles sometimes enable the fluid\r\nto retain a minute portion even after ebullition, so as to acquire a\r\nyellow milkiness; but they do not in any case prevent the test from\r\nproducing the yellow colour. Acidulation with acetic or hydrochloric\r\nacid favours its subsidence in all cases; and according to Mr. Boutigny,\r\nalkaline sulphates, muriates and nitrates have the same effect.[516]\r\nHydrosulphuric acid is so delicate as to act on the oxide in a hundred\r\nthousand parts of water. The proper colour of the precipitate is lemon\r\nor sulphur-yellow; which, when vegetable or animal matter is present,\r\nacquires a shade of white or brown.\r\n\r\nIt is not liable to any material fallacy. The salts of cadmium yield\r\nwith it precipitates nearly of the same colour: but they are exceedingly\r\nrare; and the precipitate, unlike sulphuret of arsenic, is insoluble in\r\nammonia.—The salts formed by selenic acid, if decomposed by another\r\nacid, also yield yellow precipitates; but these salts are extremely\r\nrare.—The salts of peroxide of tin give a dirty grayish-yellow\r\nprecipitate; which however ammonia turns brown.—A lead solution\r\nacidulated with hydrochloric acid gives at first a yellow precipitate;\r\nbut this becomes brownish-black when more gas is transmitted.[517] The\r\ncontents of the human intestines sometimes yield a yellowish precipitate\r\nthough no arsenic be present; and it is dissolved, like sulphuret of\r\narsenic, by ammonia.[518] The tartrate of antimony and potash\r\n(tartar-emetic) does not form, as was once thought, any source of\r\nfallacy, the antimonial precipitate having always a tint of orange-red;\r\nbesides it is not, like sulphuret of arsenic, soluble in carbonate of\r\nammonia.—Other fallacies exist, unless the test be used with the\r\nprecautions mentioned above. But these need not enumeration here.\r\n\r\n_Ammoniacal nitrate of silver_ is prepared by precipitating the oxide of\r\nsilver by means of ammonia, from a solution of nitrate of silver or\r\nlunar caustic in ten parts of water, and then redissolving the\r\nprecipitate nearly, but not entirely, by adding gradually an excess of\r\nammonia. When thus prepared, it causes, even in a very diluted solution\r\nof the oxide of arsenic, a lively lemon-yellow precipitate of arsenite\r\nof silver; which passes to dark brown under exposure to the light.—The\r\naction of this test is prevented by nitric, acetic, citric, or tartaric\r\nacid in excess, particularly by the first and last. It is also prevented\r\nby an excess of ammonia; and in very diluted solutions by the nitrate of\r\nammonia. These facts will suggest the necessity of certain obvious\r\nprecautions. Its action is obscured by the co-existence of various\r\nsalts, which singly cause a white precipitate with nitrate of silver;\r\nfor the yellow colour is then much lessened in intensity. The only one\r\nof these requiring special notice, because it occurs in very many of the\r\nfluids which are likely to be subjected to the researches of the medical\r\njurist, is common sea-salt, the chloride of sodium. The best way of\r\ngetting rid of the difficulty is to use in the first instance, not the\r\nammoniacal nitrate, but the simple nitrate of silver, as long as any\r\nwhite precipitate falls down, to add a slight excess of that test, and\r\nthen, after subsidence, to drop in ammonia. No arsenic is thrown down by\r\nthe first steps of this process; but if any be present, it is\r\nsubsequently thrown down in the form of the yellow arsenite of silver,\r\non the addition of ammonia. This simple mode of getting rid of chloride\r\nof sodium was first proposed by Dr. Marcet.[519]—Ammoniacal nitrate of\r\nsilver is of no use as a test for a moderately diluted solution of the\r\noxide of arsenic, if vegetable or animal matter be present; either the\r\ncolour of the precipitate is essentially altered, or no precipitate is\r\nformed at all.[520]\r\n\r\nIf the presence of arsenic is to be inferred only when the full\r\nlemon-yellow colour of the precipitate is developed, this test is not\r\nliable to any material fallacy. The presence of a phosphate, a serious\r\nobstacle according to an old way of using the silver test, is not a\r\nsource of fallacy in the instance of the ammoniacal nitrate; for the\r\nyellow phosphate of silver is so soluble in the ammonia of the test,\r\nthat it is not thrown down unless the phosphatic solution is very\r\nstrong.—The silver test, which is extremely delicate, was proposed by\r\nMr. Hume, a chemist of London; and in its improved state was suggested\r\nby the late Dr. Marcet. Various foreign authors have fallen into the\r\nerror of supposing that nitrate of silver without an alkali precipitates\r\noxide of arsenic: without an alkali, pure nitrate of silver gives no\r\nprecipitate, or at most a bluish-white or yellowish-white haze when both\r\nsolutions are strong.\r\n\r\n_Ammoniacal sulphate of copper_ is prepared by the same process with the\r\nlast test, sulphate of copper being substituted for nitrate of silver.\r\nIt is a test of very great delicacy. It causes in solutions of the oxide\r\nof arsenic an apple-green or grass-green precipitate of the arsenite of\r\ncopper. The particular tint is altered apparently by trifling\r\ncircumstances; but after the precipitate has stood some hours it always\r\nassumes a tint intermediate between apple-green and grass-green. The\r\noperation of this test is prevented by hydrochloric, nitric, sulphuric,\r\nacetic, citric, and tartaric acids in excess; and also by an excess of\r\nammonia. These difficulties are obviated by manifest precautions. It is\r\nalso prevented, according to Hünefeld, by muriate, nitrate, and sulphate\r\nof ammonia;[521] and by almost all vegetable infusions and animal\r\nfluids, when the oxide of arsenic is not abundant: these difficulties\r\ncannot be obviated. Even when not prevented by such fluids, its\r\noperation is often obscured, the precipitate not possessing its\r\ncharacteristic colour.\r\n\r\nAmmoniacal sulphate of copper is more open to fallacies than the silver\r\ntest. Of these the most important is that in some organic fluids it\r\nstrikes a green precipitate, like the arsenite of copper, though arsenic\r\nbe not present.[522] The solution of bichromate of potass is turned\r\ngreen but not precipitated by it.\r\n\r\nOn reviewing all that has now been stated regarding the liquid tests for\r\narsenic, it will appear that there is no single test on which absolute\r\nreliance can be placed; but that the fallacies to which they are liable\r\nare generally remote, and each of them applicable to one test only.\r\nHence if each of the three reagents, applied with due care, gives a\r\nprecipitate of the characteristic tint, the proof of the presence of\r\narsenic is decisive.\r\n\r\nThis particular view of the indications of the liquid tests, however\r\nobvious it may seem, has been often overlooked by the numerous chemists\r\nand medical jurists who have written for and against them. The\r\nantagonists of the tests have been content with proving how so many\r\nfallacies lie in the way of each, that no dependence can be put in any\r\none of them: They have not considered that the fallacies attached to one\r\nare obviated by the conjunct indications of the others.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion therefore that the analysis for arsenic by liquid\r\nreagents has been unjustly neglected in the present day. It is an\r\nexceedingly convenient method, and one of extreme delicacy, because by\r\nusing small tubes it is easy to operate with precision on very minute\r\nportions of a suspected fluid. It is also perfectly conclusive, so far\r\nas chemical knowledge now goes. On a remarkable trial a few years ago in\r\nthis country, a distinguished chemist, who, as witness for the prisoner,\r\nwas made by counsel to throw discredit on the liquid tests individually,\r\nnevertheless admitted to the counsel for the prosecution, that no other\r\nsubstance in nature but arsenic could produce the same effects as it\r\nwith the whole three tests in succession.\r\n\r\n_Reduction process._—The process by reduction of arsenic to the metallic\r\nstate, as applied to the poison in a state of solution, consists in\r\nseparating the whole arsenic by a liquid test in such a state as to\r\nadmit of the precipitated compound being subjected to the process of\r\nreduction and sublimation. The best method of the kind is a modification\r\nof one described by me in 1824.[523] This consists in throwing down the\r\nwhole arsenic in the form of sulphuret by means of hydrosulphuric acid,\r\nconverting the sulphuret by the process of reduction to the metallic\r\nstate, and oxidating the metal thus procured. The hydrosulphuric acid is\r\npreferred to other liquid reagents, because the precipitate it forms,\r\nwhile possessing a very characteristic colour, is also more bulky than\r\nthose caused by the other tests, and is therefore more easily\r\ncollected,—and because its action is not liable to be prevented or\r\nobscured by so many disturbing causes. The steps of the process are the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\nThe fluid to be examined must be acidulated with acetic or hydrochloric\r\nacid. If the fluid be neutral or alkaline, the acid may be added at\r\nonce. If on the other hand the fluid redden litmus, and the acid be\r\neither unknown or a mineral acid, potash must first be added in a slight\r\nexcess, and then the alkali must be supersaturated with acetic or\r\nhydrochloric acid. The reasons for these precautions are stated under\r\nhydrosulphuric acid as a liquid reagent. The fluid being thus prepared,\r\nit is subjected to a stream of hydrosulphuric acid gas for ten or\r\nfifteen minutes. The first portions of the gas turn the arsenical\r\nsolution to a bright lemon-yellow colour, and the subsequent portions\r\nthrow down a yellow flocculent sulphuret of arsenic. If the proportion\r\nof oxide in solution is small, a yellowness or yellow milkiness only is\r\ncaused, owing to the sulphuret being soluble in an excess of\r\nhydrosulphuric acid. But on expelling that excess by boiling, a distinct\r\nprecipitate and colourless fluid are produced. The precipitate is then\r\nto be collected thus. The precipitate is allowed to subside, and the\r\nsupernatant fluid being withdrawn, the remainder is poured into a\r\nfilter. When all the fluid has passed through, the portions of\r\nprecipitate on the upper part of the filter are washed down to the\r\nbottom. The filter is then gently compressed between folds of bibulous\r\npaper, and the sulphuret removed with the point of a knife before it\r\ndries, and dried in little masses on a watch-glass by the side of a\r\nchamber-fire, or still better in a vapour-bath. In this way it is very\r\neasy to collect a twenty-fifth part of a grain of the sulphuret. Another\r\nmethod which takes more time, but will enable the least skilful person\r\nto collect extremely small quantities, is to allow the sulphuret to\r\nsubside in the original fluid in which it is formed, to pour off the\r\nsupernatant liquid, and pour the remainder into a small glass tube, Fig.\r\n7. After the precipitate has thoroughly subsided, the supernatant liquid\r\nis to be withdrawn, and its place filled up with boiling water. The\r\noperation of alternate subsidence and affusion being repeated a\r\nsufficient number of times, the last portions of water should be gently\r\ndriven off by heat, and wiped off the inside of the tube as the drops\r\ncondense on it. Finally, the bottom of the tube, with the precipitate\r\nattached, is to be cut away with the file, and broken into small\r\nfragments with the view of preserving the whole sulphuret for the\r\nprocess of reduction. The sulphuret having been collected in either of\r\nthese ways, it is now to be dropt into the tube, Fig. 3, and covered by\r\nmeans of the funnel, Fig. 4, with soda-flux. The process in other\r\nparticulars is the same with that for reducing solid oxide of arsenic.\r\n\r\nThis method of investigation gives extremely precise results, because it\r\npresents the poison successively in three distinct forms, as sulphuret,\r\nmetal, and crystallized oxide, all of which possess very prominent and\r\ncharacteristic external properties. It is also a method which is capable\r\nof detecting very minute quantities of oxide of arsenic. And it has the\r\nadvantage over the process by liquid reagents of being applicable to\r\norganic fluids. It was accordingly followed in most medico-legal\r\nresearches until the recent discovery of the methods of Marsh and\r\nReinsch.\r\n\r\nIn order to render it quite satisfactory, it is necessary to go through\r\nthe steps of the analysis at the same time with distilled water, lest\r\nany of the reagents used should accidentally contain arsenic.\r\n\r\n_Process of Marsh._—This method consists in disengaging arsenic from the\r\nsolution in the form of arseniuretted-hydrogen gas, burning the gas in\r\nsuch way as to obtain either metallic arsenic or oxide of arsenic, and\r\nsubjecting the product to various tests.\r\n\r\nI have called this beautiful method of analysis Marsh’s process, because\r\nit appears to me that injustice has been done its discoverer both by\r\nhimself and those who have since investigated the subject, when they\r\ndenominated it merely a test. Medico-legal analysis stood in no need of\r\na new test for arsenic, but very much of an easy and infallible method\r\nof detaching minute quantities of it in a state of purity from simple\r\nand compound fluids, so as to admit of its being accurately examined. It\r\nis this important object, and not strictly speaking a new test, that has\r\nbeen attained through means of the discovery of Mr. Marsh.\r\n\r\nHis discovery consists in the observation, that, if hydrogen gas be\r\ndisengaged by the action of sulphuric acid or zinc in a fluid containing\r\narsenic dissolved in any form, arseniuretted-hydrogen gas is disengaged\r\nalong with the hydrogen; and that if the two gases be burnt together in\r\na fine flame, metallic arsenic is deposited on a white porcelain surface\r\nheld in the flame, and oxide of arsenic if the porcelain be held\r\nimmediately above it.[524] The production of a brilliant mirror-like\r\ncrust in the former case, and of a white powdery one in the other,\r\nconstituted Marsh’s test as originally proposed; and it was at first\r\nconceived to furnish unimpeachable evidence of the detection of arsenic.\r\nAfterwards many inquirers, and among them the discoverer himself, became\r\nsatisfied that certain fallacies stand in the way of a conclusion based\r\non such simple premises. Various supplementary tests were in consequence\r\nproposed. And at length it seems to be agreed, that the proper mode of\r\napplying Marsh’s discovery is to employ a succession of tests, of which\r\nthat originally pointed out by him is the first. A vast variety of\r\nmethods of analysis founded on this principle have been proposed by\r\nBritish and continental chemists. It would be tedious and unprofitable\r\nto discuss or even to state them here. The reader will probably be\r\nsatisfied with a reference to the most important of them[525] and with a\r\ndescription of that process, which appears to me, from repeated trials\r\nin medico-legal practice, to be at once most convenient, delicate, and\r\nconclusive.\r\n\r\nLet the liquid to be examined be introduced into a Döbereiner’s lamp\r\n[Fig. 10], or an apparatus constructed with a bottle and a funnel upon\r\nthe same principle [Fig. 11]; and dilute the liquid with distilled\r\nwater, until the lower cavity of the apparatus be nearly full, leaving\r\nspace however for the tube of the funnel, a fragment of zinc, and some\r\nsulphuric acid. Put in a cylinder or rod of zinc, _a_; and then add\r\nsulphuric acid until a moderate effervescence ensue. Close the junction\r\nof the two vessels, and then, allowing a little gas to escape at _c_,\r\nshut the stop-cock, and let the gas fill the vessel A, by driving the\r\nliquid up into B. Having meanwhile fitted by a cork to the exit-tube,\r\n_c_, the glass tube, _d e_, which is loosely stuffed with raw cotton at\r\nthe end _d g_, and has a bent plate of copper or tinned iron hung over\r\nit at _f_,—open the stop-cock, allow a little gas to escape so as to\r\nexpel the air in _d e_, and then kindle the gas at _e_, which must be\r\ncontracted to a capillary opening. Keep the flame low, and hold the\r\nsurface of a white porcelain vessel across the middle of it for a few\r\nseconds. If no stain be produced on the porcelain, there is no arsenic\r\nin the fluid. If a stain be formed, regulate the escape of gas by the\r\nstop-cock so that the fluid may not rise above the middle of the lower\r\nvessel of the apparatus, and apply the heat of a spirit-lamp flame to\r\nthe tube _d e_ on the left hand of the plate _f_, the purpose of which\r\nis to prevent the heat being communicated beyond that point. By and by,\r\nif there be arsenic in the fluid, a brilliant metallic ring will appear\r\nbeyond _f_, owing to decomposition of arseniuretted-hydrogen gas. As\r\nsoon as the crust is thick enough to present its properties\r\ncharacteristically, withdraw the spirit-lamp; place the tube _e h_ so\r\nthat the flame at _e_ shall be completely within the ball, _i_; let the\r\ntube incline very slightly in the direction from _k_ to _l_; and allow a\r\nstream of cold water to trickle down upon the portion _k l_, which\r\nshould be wrapped in a single layer of calico. Oxide of arsenic will\r\ngradually condense, partly in white powder or minute sparkling crystals\r\nin the ball and between _i_ and _k_, and partly between _k_ and _l_ in\r\nthe form of a solution, which collects at the bend _l_. The solution\r\nwhich may be increased in quantity by boiling a little distilled water\r\nupon the powder in the ball and bend _i k_, is then to be subjected in\r\nsmall portions to the three liquid reagents, ammoniacal nitrate of\r\nsilver, ammoniacal sulphate of copper, and hydrosulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nSome experience is required to apply this process successfully. But with\r\ndue attention it furnishes conclusive evidence with great delicacy and\r\nprecision. A solution containing only a millionth part of oxide of\r\narsenic will part with it readily in the form of arseniuretted-hydrogen;\r\nand the slightest trace of that gas in the hydrogen is indicated by the\r\nmethod recommended above.—The process is compounded of Mr. Marsh’s\r\noriginal discovery, the supplementary test of reduction in the exit-tube\r\nrecommended by Berzelius,[526] and the formation and examination of the\r\noxide proposed by myself.[527]—With certain precautions and modes of\r\nmanipulating, it is applicable to the most complex organic fluids, as\r\nwell as to simple solutions.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Mr. Marsh had not been long made before the test in its\r\noriginal simple form was found liable to divers important fallacies. It\r\nappeared, for example, that antimony yields very nearly the same\r\nappearance of metallic crust and of white powder, according to the\r\nposition of the porcelain in the flame; that some porcelains glazed with\r\noxide of zinc are similarly stained by a flame of simple hydrogen gas;\r\nthat a great variety of metallic salts, if spirted up into the\r\nexit-tube, undergo reduction in the flame, and cause imitative stains on\r\nthe porcelain; that iron-salts seems to form stains from the same\r\nchemical action as what occurs in the case of arsenic; and that certain\r\ncompounds of phosphorous acid with ammonia and animal matter, or even\r\nmere animal matters themselves, will in some circumstances produce a\r\nstain more or less similar to that which is occasioned by arsenic.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, that the resemblance of most of these spurious stains\r\nto an arsenical crust has been much exaggerated. But still the\r\nsimilarity is sufficient to satisfy every impartial judge, that the mere\r\nproduction of a brilliant metallic, or white powdery stain, or both,\r\nupon porcelain, is not conclusive evidence of the detection of arsenic\r\nin medico-legal inquiries. It is strong presumptive evidence; and the\r\nnon-production of such stains is absolute proof that arsenic is not\r\npresent. But in order to obtain irrefragable proof of its presence, the\r\nsubstance which forms the crusts and stains must be subjected to farther\r\nexamination. And such is the object of the supplementary methods in the\r\nprocess detailed above. That process is perfectly free of fallacy. No\r\nsubstance yet known but arsenic can yield the succession of phenomena\r\nwhich have been detailed. My opinion farther is, that the process may be\r\nsafely simplified by withdrawing Berzelius’s supplementary test of\r\nreduction in the exit-tube, and retaining the test of oxidation only,\r\nwith the examination of the oxide by liquid reagents. I have retained\r\nthe former in deference to the opinion expressed by a committee\r\nappointed by the French Institute, who examined the whole subject with\r\nunwearied zeal, but who, it may be observed, seem never to have had in\r\ntheir view the check-test of oxidation; which, with the consecutive\r\ntests, is superior in conclusiveness to the check of reduction only.\r\n\r\n_Reinsch’s process_, like the former, has been inconveniently called a\r\nnew test for arsenic. The fact discovered by Dr. Reinsch is valueless as\r\nsupplying a mere test; but it forms the ground-work of the best process\r\nof all yet proposed for the detection of arsenic in solution. The\r\ndiscovery is, that arsenic in solution is deposited in the metallic\r\nstate upon copper-leaf, when the fluid is acidulated with hydrochloric\r\nacid, and heated till it boils gently or is about to do so; and that by\r\nheating the copper gently in a glass tube the arsenic is sublimed from\r\nit in the form of oxide or metal according to the quantity present.[528]\r\n\r\nThis method is so simple and easy as scarcely to require any detailed\r\nexplanation. The fluid should contain about a tenth of its volume of\r\nhydrochloric acid. It must be heated near ebullition before the copper\r\nis introduced, otherwise the copper becomes tarnished, though arsenic be\r\nnot present. Copper-leaf, or copper-plate worn thin by the action of\r\ndiluted nitric acid, or fine copper gauze, is the best form for use. In\r\nthe feeblest solutions ten or fifteen minutes elapse before arsenic is\r\nvisibly deposited, and forty minutes should be allowed for strong\r\ndeposition; but in strong solutions, the action takes place in a few\r\nseconds. The result is a thin, brittle brilliant, steel like coating of\r\nmetallic arsenic. As soon as the deposit is formed, the copper is to be\r\nremoved, dried with a gentle heat, cut into small shreds, and heated\r\nwith a spirit-lamp in the smallest glass tube that will conveniently\r\ncontain the whole; upon which a metallic ring of arsenic is sometimes\r\nsublimed, but more generally a ring of small sparkling crystals. These\r\nare first to be examined as to their form with a common pocket lens; and\r\nthen dissolved in boiling distilled water, after shaking out the copper,\r\nso that a solution may be obtained and subjected to the liquid reagents,\r\nespecially the ammoniacal nitrate of silver as being the readiest and\r\nmost delicate. In all medico-legal inquiries it is necessary to perform\r\na preliminary experiment with distilled water and the hydrochloric acid\r\nused, lest the acid contain arsenic.\r\n\r\nThe process here described is one which I have followed with great\r\nfacility, certainty and despatch in several medico-legal cases.[529] It\r\nis extremely delicate; for it will detect at least a 250,000th part of\r\narsenic in solution; and it removes from the fluid every particle of\r\narsenic, because none can be afterwards discovered by means even of\r\nMarsh’s method. It is not subject to any fallacy. The mere formation of\r\na brilliant coating on the copper is not evidence of arsenic being\r\npresent; for as Reinsch himself ascertained, solutions of bismuth, tin,\r\nzinc, and antimony produce a coating more or less similar to an\r\narsenical one. But the farther steps of the process entirely put aside\r\nall these sources of error. The non-formation of a metallic tarnish of\r\ncopper, however, is perhaps not absolute proof of the absence of\r\narsenic. For, according to a late statement by Drs. Fresenius and Von\r\nBabo,[530] “all nitrates, and various salts of mercury and other metals,\r\nrender the separation of arsenic by copper difficult or even\r\nimpossible.” The authors of this objection, although the paper is\r\notherwise elaborate and detailed, have not given any particulars in\r\nillustration of so important a criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Of the Tests for Oxide of Arsenic in Organic Mixtures._\r\n\r\nThe present is by far the most important of the conditions under which\r\nit may be necessary to search for arsenic in medico-legal cases; for in\r\nnine cases out of ten the subject of analysis is either some article of\r\nfood or drink, the contents or tissues of the stomach, or the textures\r\nof other organs of the body into which the poison has been carried by\r\nabsorption.\r\n\r\nAccordingly much attention has been paid to this subject for some years\r\npast, and many valuable methods of analysis have been suggested, more\r\nespecially since the recent discovery that arsenic, like many other\r\npoisons, undergo absorption, and is diffused by the circulation\r\nthroughout the body generally. It was proved by me in 1824,[531] that\r\nthe tests for arsenic, at that time in general use, are so fallacious\r\nwhen applied to complex organic mixtures as to be unfit for medico-legal\r\ninvestigations except merely as trial-tests; and a process was proposed,\r\nwhich has since undergone various modifications from others as well as\r\nmyself. This process, in the form in which it was adopted in the last\r\nedition of the present work, is still applicable to a great proportion\r\nof cases; and indeed a recent modification of it has been thought by\r\nDrs. Fresenius and von Babo to be superior even yet to every other in\r\nall circumstances.[532] But two new methods are at present generally\r\npreferred, and probably not without reason. At least they have been much\r\nemployed and with great success in numerous medico-legal researches,\r\nwhere the quantity of arsenic was to all appearance extremely small, and\r\nthe subject of examination most complex and troublesome to bring within\r\nthe sphere of analysis. And in particular they have been successfully\r\nemployed to detect arsenic in those organs of the human body into which\r\nit can obtain admission only through the medium of absorption.\r\n\r\nIn the following statement I shall describe four processes only, that of\r\nReinsch, by which the arsenic is first separated as a crust on\r\ncopper,—that of Marsh, who first detaches it in the form of\r\narseniuretted-hydrogen,—my own method, which consists in obtaining in\r\nthe first instance a sulphuret of arsenic,—and that of Drs. Fresenius\r\nand von Babo, which has the same foundation.\r\n\r\n_Process of Reinsch._—This is the simplest and easiest of all. Remove in\r\nthe first place any white or gray powder which can be detached from the\r\nmixture; and either subject it to the process of reduction by charcoal\r\nor soda-flux, as described at p. 203, or dissolve it in boiling\r\ndistilled water and subject the solution to the three liquid reagents,\r\np. 207, or if there be enough, examine it in both ways. If arsenic be\r\nthus obtained, it is seldom necessary to proceed any farther. But if\r\nnot, cut all soft solids into small fragments, add distilled water if\r\nnecessary, then add hydrochloric acid to the amount of a tenth of the\r\nwhole mixture, and more if the subject of analysis be decayed and\r\nammoniacal, so that there may be a decided excess of acid. Boil gently\r\nfor an hour, or until all soft solids be either dissolved or broken down\r\ninto fine flakes and grains. Filter through calico; bring the filtered\r\nfluid again to the boiling point; and then proceed as described for\r\nReinsch’s method in simple arsenical solutions [p. 214].\r\n\r\nThe only important precaution to be attended to in employing this\r\nprocess is to take care that the water, hydrochloric acid, and calico\r\nare free of accidental impregnation with arsenic. This is guarded\r\nagainst by applying the process to them in the first instance. I have\r\nlately employed this method of analysis with success in two medico-legal\r\ncases where the bodies had been buried for several months, and where the\r\nquantity of arsenic must have been very minute. Satisfactory evidence\r\nwas obtained from a sixth part of the stomach, and also from the same\r\nproportion of the liver.\r\n\r\n_Process of Marsh._—The chief difficulties in applying the process of\r\nMarsh to complex organic mixtures arise from the tendency of oxide of\r\narsenic to adhere with obstinacy to some organic principles in the solid\r\nstate, and from the liability of the gas disengaged in the apparatus to\r\nraise organic fluids in a fine froth, which breaks up slowly, and is\r\ntherefore apt to pass over into the exit-tube. Many contrivances have\r\nbeen devised, to meet these difficulties, especially by the French\r\nchemists and toxicologists, whose attention was turned earnestly to the\r\nsubject by the investigations carried on in certain late criminal trials\r\nof great interest and importance. The various devices now alluded to\r\nwere subjected to trial in 1841 by a Committee of the French Institute;\r\nwho came to the opinion that the following method suggested by MM.\r\nFlandin and Danger is the most convenient and comprehensive.[533]\r\n\r\nHeat the organic matter with a sixth of its weight of strong sulphuric\r\nacid; when complete solution has taken place, concentrate the fluid to a\r\nfriable almost dry charcoal; add a little concentrated nitric acid\r\ngradually to this when cold, and again evaporate to dryness; then act on\r\nthe residue with boiling distilled water, and a solution of a\r\nreddish-brown colour is obtained, which may be used in such an apparatus\r\nas that of Döbereiner without risk of obstruction from froth.—The\r\narseniuretted-hydrogen, thus disengaged along with the hydrogen gas, is\r\nto be submitted to the succession of tests described in speaking of\r\nMarsh’s process for detecting arsenic in a state of simple solution [p.\r\n212].\r\n\r\nThis method of investigation is exceedingly precise and conclusive. The\r\nsulphuric acid aided by heat destroys organic matter sufficiently to\r\nprevent frothing in the apparatus and dissolves out arsenic from a state\r\nof combination with organic principles; and nitric acid afterwards\r\nconverts any arsenic in the half-charred mass into the soluble arsenic\r\nacid. It has been employed with success in various medico-legal\r\nproceedings in France. It answers well for detecting oxide of arsenic in\r\nthe viscera, muscles, and other parts of the body into which the poison\r\nhas been conveyed through absorption.\r\n\r\n_Process by Hydrosulphuric Acid._—This method may be employed in two\r\nways, according as the object is merely to prove the presence of oxide\r\nof arsenic, or to ascertain also its quantity.\r\n\r\na. If proof of its presence be all that is wanted, cut any soft solids\r\ninto small pieces, add distilled water if necessary, boil for half an\r\nhour, let the decoction cool, and filter it. Add a little acetic acid to\r\nthe filtered fluid, and if any precipitate form, filter again. Evaporate\r\nto dryness, first by ebullition, afterwards over the vapour-bath.\r\nDissolve the residuum again in repeated portions of boiling distilled\r\nwater, and filter the solution. If it be not acid to litmus-paper add\r\nmore acetic acid, and transmit hydrosulphuric acid gas through the fluid\r\nuntil an excess be indicated by the sense of smell after agitation, Then\r\nexpel the excess of gas by boiling; and if the precipitate of sulphuret\r\nof arsenic do not subside readily add a little of a strong solution of\r\nhydrochlorate of ammonia, which will facilitate subsidence. When the\r\nprecipitate has fallen to the bottom, withdraw the supernatant fluid\r\nwith the pipette, Fig. 8; and replace it with a little boiling distilled\r\nwater. Lastly, collect the precipitate on a filter, and proceed as by\r\nthe reduction process with soda-flux for oxide of arsenic, in a state of\r\nsimple solution.\r\n\r\nThis method answers very well for ordinary cases where the quantity of\r\narsenic is not extremely minute. But I have met with instances in\r\nmedico-legal practice where the process of Reinsch, as well as that of\r\nMarsh, succeeded in detecting the poison in sources to which the method\r\nby hydrosulphuric acid had been applied without avail; because\r\napparently the organic matter existing in solution prevented the action\r\nof the gas, or, as Orfila thinks, because boiling water will not in all\r\ncircumstances remove oxide of arsenic from the textures of the animal\r\nbody which are impregnated with it. In particular I doubt whether this\r\nmethod is sufficiently delicate to detect arsenic in those organs and\r\ntextures into which it has been conveyed in cases of poisoning through\r\nabsorption into the blood.—Another objection is its tediousness. The\r\nfirst filtration, if the substance to be examined be the stomach or its\r\ncontents, may take two days; and one way or another the analysis can\r\nseldom be completed within four days. Reinsch’s process may be brought\r\nto a conclusion in two hours or less, even in the most difficult\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nb. The last process to be mentioned, is one based, like the previous\r\none, upon the precipitation of arsenic in the form of sulphuret, but\r\nwith very material modifications, the purpose of which is to enable the\r\nanalyst to separate the whole arsenic in a state of purity, so as to\r\nascertain the exact amount of the poison in the mixture. This method has\r\nbeen recently proposed by Drs. Fresenius and von Babo.[534]\r\n\r\nCut any soft solids into small pieces, put the whole into a porcelain\r\nbasin, add as much hydrochloric acid as equals the probable weight of\r\nthe dry matter in the mixture, and then water enough to form a thin\r\npulp. Heat the basin over the vapour-bath, adding every five minutes\r\nabout half a drachm of chlorate of potass, and stirring frequently,\r\nuntil the liquid become clear-yellow, homogeneous, and thin. Add now two\r\ndrachms more of the chlorate; filter through linen, washing the residuum\r\non the filter with boiling water; concentrate to a pound; add a strong\r\nsolution of sulphurous acid till its odour predominates, and expel the\r\nexcess of it by heat. The liquid is now ready for the transmission of\r\nhydrosulphuric acid gas, which should be transmitted in a slow stream\r\nfor twelve hours. Wash away any sulphuret adhering to the tube by means\r\nof ammonia, and add the solution to the principal liquid; which is next\r\nto be left at a gentle heat about 80° F., in a vessel covered with\r\npaper, till the sulphureous smell entirely disappear. The precipitate,\r\nwhich contains organic matter as well as sulphuret, is then to be\r\ncollected on a paper filter, washed, and dried with the filter over the\r\nvapour-bath. The animal matter is next destroyed, and the sulphuret\r\nconverted into arsenic acid, by dropping on it fuming nitrous acid till\r\nthe whole is moistened, drying the product thoroughly over the\r\nvapour-bath, moistening the residuum with concentrated sulphuric acid,\r\nheating the mixture again in the vapour-bath for two or three hours, and\r\nraising the heat afterwards gradually in a sand-bath to 300° F., till a\r\ncharred brittle mass be obtained. This is to be heated over the\r\nvapour-bath with twenty parts of distilled water, filtered, and washed\r\nwith boiling water on the filter till what passes through ceases to\r\nredden litmus. The solution, which ought to be colourless, is next\r\nacidulated with hydrochloric acid, and treated as formerly with\r\nhydrosulphuric acid gas. When the sulphuret has been collected on a\r\nsmall filter, diluted ammonia is to be sent through the filter as long\r\nas it dissolves any sulphuret, and is to be received in a weighed\r\nporcelain basin, in which the ammonia and water are to be driven off at\r\na temperature not exceeding 212°. The sulphuret which is alone left may\r\nnow be weighed by again weighing the basin; and one grain of sulphuret\r\nis equivalent to 0·803 of a grain of oxide of arsenic.—The authors add\r\nan elaborate process for obtaining from this the whole arsenic by\r\nreduction. But such a proceeding is unnecessary. It is sufficient in\r\nmedico-legal inquiries to ascertain by the simpler method given above\r\n[p. 204], that it does yield by reduction with soda-flux a true\r\narsenical crust, and that this yields by oxidation white, sparkling\r\ncrystals with triangular facettes.\r\n\r\nAfter a comparative trial of the most esteemed process, Drs. Fresenius\r\nand von Babo state that they found the one now described as delicate as\r\nany other, and the only method by which the quantity of oxide of arsenic\r\ncan be ascertained with accuracy.—The hydrochloric acid used at the\r\ncommencement enables the water to dissolve compounds of arsenic which\r\nwater alone will not act on; and it farther facilitates solution by\r\nbreaking up or dissolving organic textures. The addition of chlorate of\r\npotash prevents the escape of oxide of arsenic during the subsequent\r\nevaporation; which is apt to happen when hydrochloric acid is present.\r\nThe subsequent addition of sulphuric acid converts arsenic acid into\r\narsenious acid, in which shape the sulphuret of arsenic is more readily\r\nformed by the action of hydrosulphuric acid gas, when organic matter\r\nco-exists in the solution. The steps for destroying organic matter\r\nthrown down with the sulphuret at its first formation require no further\r\ncommentary: They are the most important particulars in the process for\r\nits main object,—the determination of the quantity of pure\r\nsesqui-sulphuret, and, through it, of the sesquioxide originally in the\r\nsubject of analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of certain alleged Fallacies in the case of Organic Mixtures._\r\n\r\nBefore taking leave of the detection of arsenic in organic mixtures, it\r\nis necessary to notice certain alleged fallacies in the way of every\r\nprocess, arising from arsenic obtaining admission into the subject of\r\nanalysis through other means than its intentional addition or its\r\nintroduction as a poison into the body. This topic, one of paramount\r\nimportance in medico-legal chemistry, has lately undergone careful\r\ninvestigation during and since the notorious trial of Madame Lafarge.\r\nThe results are the following:—\r\n\r\nIt has been alleged that arsenic may obtain accidental admission into\r\nthe subject of analysis, 1, because the reagents used in the processes\r\nmay be adulterated with arsenic; 2, because the material of the\r\napparatus may contain it; 3, because it may have existed in antidotes\r\nadministered during life; 4, because it sometimes forms a constituent\r\npart of the human body in the natural state; and 5, because it exists in\r\nthe soil of some churchyards.\r\n\r\n1. _Arsenic may exist as an adulteration in some reagents._—It must be\r\napt to occur in _sulphuric acid_, when that substance is prepared with\r\npyritic sulphur, which commonly contains some sulphuret of arsenic; and\r\nit has actually been found in abundance in the acid by various\r\nexperimentalists, and in England for the first time by Dr. Rees.[535] It\r\nmay be detected by transmitting hydrosulphuric acid gas through the\r\ndiluted acid; and it may be effectually removed in the same way,[536]\r\nthe acid being afterwards filtered in a funnel whose throat is\r\nfilled with asbestus, and the excess of gas being expelled by\r\nheat.—_Hydrochloric acid_ may contain arsenic, because it may have been\r\nprepared with an arsenicated sulphuric acid. The impurity may be\r\ndetected and removed in the same way as in that substance. Nitric acid\r\nseems not apt to be similarly adulterated;[537] but it may be tested by\r\nMarsh’s process, after neutralizing the acid with potash, and adding\r\nmore sulphuric acid than is required to decompose the nitre thus formed.\r\n_Zinc_ occasionally contains a little arsenic, which will be evolved in\r\nMarsh’s process. Dr. Clark of Aberdeen says zinc is scarcely ever free\r\nof a trace of arsenic; and it has been occasionally detected by others.\r\nOrfila, however, very seldom found so much as to be discoverable by\r\nMarsh’s test applied continuously for a great length of time.[538] A\r\ncommittee of the French Institute came to the same conclusion.[539] M.\r\nJaquelain, acting under the directions of Professor Dumas, could not\r\ndetect an atom in any French specimen of zinc, or its carbonate or\r\nsilicated oxide, as met with in commerce.[540] Lastly, Mr. Brett\r\nsatisfied himself that no British or foreign zinc he could obtain\r\nindicated the presence of arsenic by a process capable of detecting a\r\n5000th of that metal in zinc.[541] It is an obvious inference from all\r\nthese inquiries that no difficulty can be experienced in obtaining zinc\r\nso pure as to exhibit not a trace of arsenic by Marsh’s method. Neither\r\nis there any difficulty in obtaining sulphuric, muriatic, and nitric\r\nacid free of that adulteration.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time it is equally obvious, that in medico-legal\r\nanalyses, unless the reagents used be previously known to be free of\r\narsenic, they ought invariably to be subjected in the first instance to\r\nthe process, whatever it may be, which the analyst proposes to employ\r\nfor detecting arsenic in a suspected substance.\r\n\r\n2. _Arsenic may be present in some articles of chemical\r\napparatus._—Arsenic has been detected in the metal of cast-iron\r\npots,[542] which Orfila and others have proposed to employ in certain\r\nanalyses on the large scale, as, for example, when the poison is sought\r\nfor in the whole soft solids of the human body. It is denied, however,\r\nthat any of that arsenic can be dissolved out of cast-iron by the\r\nprocess which has been followed in such circumstances.[543]\r\n\r\nThe primary fact, and the qualification of it, are in my opinion of\r\nequally little medico-legal importance. It is not likely that such\r\nenormous masses of material will ever be operated on again, as those\r\nwhich were made use of in some late, French trials, and for which great\r\niron pots were found indispensable;—because it has been proved that\r\nabsorbed arsenic is chiefly to be met with in particular organs or\r\nsecretions, such as the liver and urine. Besides, a false importance has\r\nbeen attached to the enthusiastic analyses of the whole human carcase,\r\nwith which some French chemists have been astounding the minds of the\r\nscientific world, as well as the vulgar, on the occasion of certain late\r\ntrials for poisoning. I confess I could not find fault with a jury, who\r\nmight decline to put faith in the evidence of poisoning with arsenic,\r\nwhen the analyst, after boiling an entire body, with many gallons of\r\nwater, in a huge iron cauldron, making use of whole pounds of sulphuric\r\nacid, nitric acid, and nitre, and toiling for days and weeks at the\r\nprocess, could do no more than produce minute traces of the poison. What\r\nman of common sense will believe, that, with such bulky materials and\r\ncrude apparatus, it is possible to guard to a certainty against the\r\naccidental admission of a little arsenic? At all events I am much\r\nmistaken if any British jury would condemn a prisoner on such\r\nevidence,—or any British chemist find fault with them for declining to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n3. _Arsenic may have existed in antidotes administered during life._—It\r\nis now generally known, that the only chemical antidote for arsenic is\r\nthe hydrated sesquioxide of iron. But this substance appears\r\noccasionally to contain a little arsenic, obviously derived from the\r\ncompound of iron whence the oxide is prepared.[544] Such an adulteration\r\nmust be rare in what is prepared by the ordinary processes, according to\r\nwhich the oxide of arsenic ought to remain in solution. The only\r\neffectual mode, however, of guarding against this source of error, when\r\nthe antidote has been administered, is to examine a portion of the stock\r\nwhence the patient was supplied, by dissolving it in an excess of\r\nsulphuric acid, and subjecting it to Marsh’s test.\r\n\r\n4. _Arsenic sometimes exists naturally in the human body._—This\r\nstartling proposition was first advanced by M. Couerbe, and by Professor\r\nOrfila soon afterwards.[545] The latter subsequently stated, that it\r\nexists only in the bones, and not in any of the soft solids.[546] It is\r\nnow clear, however, that both of these experimentalists must have\r\ncommitted an error. Orfila himself admits that his early researches are\r\nvitiated by the subsequent discovery of arsenic in some kinds of\r\nsulphuric acid;[547] and all recent attempts by others to obtain his\r\nresults have failed. Thus MM. Flandin and Danger could not detect\r\narsenic in any part of the human body, when it had not been\r\nadministered:[548] Pfaff was unable to detect an atom of it in the bones\r\nof man or the lower animals by Orfila’s own process:[549] Dr. Rees was\r\nequally unsuccessful:[550] and in 1841 a committee of the French\r\nInstitute, who superintended the performance of an analysis in three\r\ncases by Orfila, reported that he failed in every instance to find a\r\ntrace of arsenic, by a process which could detect a 65th part of a grain\r\nintentionally mixed with an avoirdupois pound of bones.[551]\r\n\r\nThere is the strongest possible presumption, therefore, that human bones\r\nnever contain any arsenic. And besides, supposing they did, the source\r\nof fallacy would be utterly insignificant; for, when it becomes\r\nnecessary to search for arsenic absorbed into the textures of the body,\r\nit is never necessary to have recourse to the bones.\r\n\r\n5. _Arsenic may exist in the soil of churchyards._—This proposition too\r\nwas first announced by Professor Orfila, who found a little in the\r\nchurchyard of Villey-sur-Tille, near Dijon, and of the Bicêtre,\r\nMont-Parnasse, and New Botanic Garden at Paris.[552] And although MM.\r\nFlandin and Danger afterwards denied they could ever find any,[553] a\r\ncommittee of the Parisian Academy of Medicine reported that Orfila\r\nproved before them the accuracy of his statement.[554] But the arsenic\r\nexists in a state in which it cannot be dissolved out by boiling water:\r\nIt has been hitherto separable only by boiling the churchyard mould with\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid. Hence it cannot pass by percolation through\r\na coffin into a body; and consequently it becomes a source of fallacy\r\nonly when the coffin has been broken up in the course of time, and the\r\nmould lies in actual contact with the organs to be analysed.[555]\r\n\r\nIt plainly appears, then, that most of the fallacies alleged against the\r\nvalidity of the evidence derived from the discovery of arsenic within\r\nthe human body in cases of poisoning have no real existence; and that\r\nthose which are real can easily be provided against by simple and\r\nobvious precautions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        3. _Arsenite of Copper_.\r\n\r\nThe arsenite of copper [Scheele’s-green, Mineral-green] deserves notice,\r\nbecause it is in use as a pigment, and has actually been used as a\r\npoison. Dr. Duncan once detected it in pills, given to a pregnant female\r\nwith the view of procuring abortion; in Paris it has been detected in\r\nsweetmeats, having been used to give them a fine green colour;[556] and\r\nMr. Ainley of Bingley in Yorkshire informs me he found it to constitute\r\na pigment sold by London pastry-cooks under the name of emerald-green\r\nfor colouring preserves, and which in his practice had proved poisonous\r\nto children who had eaten apple-tarts coloured with it.\r\n\r\nIt is a compound of arsenious acid and deutoxide of copper, is sold in\r\npowder or pulverulent cakes, and has a pale grass-green colour. Its\r\nnature may be ascertained by heating it in a glass tube. Crystals of\r\noxide of arsenic sublime, and oxide of copper remains, which, on being\r\ndissolved in nitric acid, yields a fine violet-blue solution with\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\nThe mineral-green of the shops, however, is seldom arsenite of copper.\r\nThe substance sold in Edinburgh under that name, although believed by\r\ncolourmen to be a preparation of arsenic, is not the arsenite of copper,\r\nbut a mixture of hydrated oxide of copper and carbonate of lime; which\r\nwill be mentioned more particularly under the head of the poisons of\r\ncopper.\r\n\r\n_Process for Organic Mixtures._—The suspected mixture is to be heated\r\nwith a little hydrochloric acid and well stirred. The arsenite being\r\nthus dissolved, the solution is to be allowed to cool and then filtered.\r\nA stream of hydrosulphuric-acid gas will now cause a dark-brown or\r\nyellowish-brown muddiness or precipitate, which is a mixture of\r\nsulphuret of copper and sulphuret of arsenic. The precipitate being\r\nseparated after boiling, and properly cleansed by the process of\r\nsubsidence and affusion, or if it is large, by washing on a filter, the\r\ntwo sulphurets are to be separated by ammonia, which dissolves sulphuret\r\nof arsenic but leaves the sulphuret of copper; and the sulphuret of\r\narsenic may be recovered from the filtered fluid by expelling the\r\nammonia with heat. The sulphuret of arsenic is next to be reduced as\r\ndirected at page 211; and the sulphuret of copper examined as\r\nrecommended under the head of copper.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        4. _Arsenite of Potass_.\r\n\r\nThis salt is an object of some importance to the medical jurist, as it\r\nforms the basis of a common medicine, Fowler’s Solution, or the\r\nTasteless Ague Drop. This preparation contains in every ounce four\r\ngrains of arsenious acid. It has a brownish-red colour, and an odour of\r\nlavender. It is strongly alkaline to litmus. When acidulated with\r\nhydrochloric acid, hydrosulphuric-acid gas causes in it a dirty\r\nbrownish-yellow precipitate; and Reinsch’s process will detach arsenic\r\nfrom it upon copper in a state capable of being subjected to the usual\r\ntests [see p. 214].\r\n\r\n\r\n                       5. _Arseniate of Potass._\r\n\r\nThis substance is so rarely met with as to be an object of little\r\nconsequence to the medical jurist: nevertheless I have found in the\r\ncourse of reading two instances of poisoning with it. A very dangerous\r\nand tedious case has been related by Professor Bernt, which arose from\r\ntoo great a quantity having been given medicinally by an ignorant\r\ndruggist;[557] and a case of accidental poisoning with it has been\r\nrelated in the London Medical Repository.[558] A singular account too\r\nhas been published of the accidental poisoning of seven horses with it\r\nat Paris. They all died, most of them with the symptoms and morbid\r\nappearances of well-marked inflammation of the alimentary canal.[559]\r\n\r\nWhen solid it forms tetraedral prismatic crystals, acuminated by four\r\nplanes. It is very soluble in water, fuses at a red heat, and on cooling\r\nconcretes into a crumbly, foliaceous mass, having a pearly lustre. It is\r\neasily known by the effect of the process of reduction—of the nitrate of\r\nsilver, the salts of copper, and sulphuretted-hydrogen. Heated with\r\ncharcoal in a tube it gives off metallic arsenic in the usual manner;\r\nbut a stronger heat is required than for the reduction of the arsenious\r\nacid. Dissolved in water and treated with nitrate of silver it yields a\r\nbrick-red precipitate, the arseniate of silver. With the salts of copper\r\nits solution gives a pale bluish-white precipitate, the arseniate of\r\ncopper. With sulphuretted-hydrogen gas, preceded by acidulation with\r\nmuriatic acid, and transmitted for a considerable length of time, it\r\nyields the yellow sulphuret of arsenic. When in solution it yields\r\narsenic both by Reinsch’s process and the method of Marsh.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    6. _The Sulphurets of Arsenic._\r\n\r\nIn the arts various substances are known which contain a compound of\r\nsulphur and arsenic. In the first place, two pure sulphurets are known\r\nin chemistry and in painting, the one of a fine orange colour, and known\r\nby the name of realgar, the other of a rich sulphur-yellow, and termed\r\norpiment. Secondly, the name of orpiment is familiarly given to a\r\npigment in more general use than either of the former, which has a less\r\nlively colour, and consists of pure orpiment with a large admixture of\r\narsenious acid. Lastly, orpiment also forms a great proportion of\r\nanother common pigment, King’s yellow.\r\n\r\nThe orange-red sulphuret (realgar, risigallum, Σανδαραχη, sandaracha),\r\nis chiefly a natural production. It is solid, of a bright orange-red\r\ncolour, and composed of small shining scales, so soft as to be scratched\r\nwith the nail. It is composed of one equivalent of metal and one of\r\nsulphur. Its best chemical characters are the disengagement of metallic\r\narsenic when it is heated in a tube with potass or the black flux; and\r\nits undergoing sublimation unchanged when heated alone in a tube.\r\n\r\nThe yellow sulphuret (orpiment, auripigmentum, αρσενικον), is both a\r\nnatural production, and the result of many chemical operations. The\r\nsulphuret thrown down from solutions of arsenic by sulphuretted-hydrogen\r\nis quite conformable in physical and chemical characters with the\r\nnatural orpiment. Natural orpiment, when in mass, consists of broad\r\nscales of much brilliancy and of a rich yellow colour. It is composed of\r\ntwo equivalents of metal and three of sulphur. Its most striking\r\nchemical characters are the same with those of realgar, from which it is\r\ndistinguished chiefly by its colour.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated by Hahnemann in his elaborate work on Arsenic, that\r\nthe pure sulphurets are somewhat soluble in water,—that native orpiment\r\nis soluble in 5000 parts of water with the aid of ebullition, and that\r\nartificial orpiment by precipitation is soluble in 600 parts.[560]\r\nHahnemann, however, was mistaken in supposing that the water dissolved\r\nthese sulphurets. It does not dissolve, but decomposes them. Very lately\r\nM. Decourdemanche has found that, by slow action in cold water, and much\r\nmore quickly with the aid of heat, the arsenical sulphuret is decomposed\r\nby virtue of a simultaneous decomposition of the water, hydrosulphuric\r\nacid being evolved and an oxide of arsenic remaining in solution. And he\r\nhas farther remarked, that this change is promoted by the presence of\r\nanimal and vegetable principles dissolved in water.[561] These facts are\r\ninteresting, as they explain certain apparent anomalies to be noticed\r\npresently in the physiological properties of the sulphurets.\r\n\r\nThe common orpiment of the shops is not a pure sulphuret like the\r\nnatural orpiment, but a much more active substance, a mixture of\r\norpiment and arsenious acid. It is made by subliming in close vessels a\r\nmixture of sulphur and oxide of arsenic. It is met with in the shops in\r\ntwo forms, in that of a fine powder possessing a yellow colour with a\r\nfaint tint of orange, and in that of concave masses composed of layers\r\nof various tints of white, yellow and orange, commonly also lined\r\ninternally with tetraedral white pyramidal crystals. Till lately it was\r\naccounted a variety of sulphuret, and some ingenious conjectures were\r\nmade as to the cause of its superior energy over the other sulphurets as\r\na poison. But M. Guibourt has proved that it always contains oxide of\r\narsenic, and is commonly impregnated with it to a very large amount,\r\nsome parcels containing so much as 96 per cent.[562] The inner surface I\r\nhave often seen lined with large crystals of pure oxide. In a very\r\ninteresting account by Dr. Symonds of Bristol, describing the case of\r\nMrs. Smith, for whose murder a woman Burdock was executed in that city a\r\nfew years ago, it is stated that artificial orpiment was the poison\r\ngiven, that death took place in a very few hours, and that a sample from\r\nthe druggist’s shop where the poison was bought contained on an average\r\n79 per cent. of oxide of arsenic.[563]\r\n\r\nAnother impure sulphuret, a good deal used in painting, and a favourite\r\npoison in this country for killing flies, is King’s yellow. It is sold\r\nin the form of a light powder or in loose conical cakes. It has an\r\nintense sulphur-yellow colour. This substance is soluble, though not\r\nentirely, in water, both cold and warm, and forms a colourless solution,\r\nfrom which, on cooling, or by evaporation, a yellow powder separates. In\r\nthis respect it differs essentially from the pure sulphurets. The\r\nsolution is not acted on by reagents in the same way as the solution of\r\narsenious acid. Lime-water and hydrosulphuric acid have no effect on it,\r\nthe ammoniacal nitrate of silver causes a copious dirty brown, and the\r\nammoniacal sulphate of copper a scanty, dirty lemon-yellow precipitate.\r\nI have not seen any account of the mode of preparing it or an analysis\r\nof its composition. But according to my own experiments it contains a\r\nlarge proportion of sulphuret of arsenic, a considerable proportion of\r\nlime, and about 16 per cent. of sulphur. Its nature is best shown by the\r\nfollowing method of analysis. Let the powder be agitated in diluted\r\nammonia till the colour becomes white. The filtered fluid contains the\r\nsulphuret of arsenic, which, on addition of an acid, falls down, and may\r\nbe separated and reduced in a tube with the black flux. The remaining\r\nwhite powder, well freed from adhering sulphuret by washing, is next to\r\nbe agitated in diluted acetate or hydrochloric acid and again filtered.\r\nThe solution on being neutralized precipitates abundantly with oxalate\r\nof ammonia and the alkaline carbonates, showing that lime was taken up\r\nby the acid: and, as the acid operates without effervescence, the lime\r\nmust have been in the caustic state. The powder which remains after the\r\naction of the acid will be found to fuse with a gentle heat and to burn\r\nalmost entirely away with a blue flame, emitting sulphureous vapours.\r\nThese experiments make it obvious that King’s yellow contains sulphuret\r\nof arsenic, caustic lime, and free sulphur; and in all probability the\r\nlime exists in the form of a triple sulphuret of lime and arsenic.\r\n\r\nAll the preparations containing the sulphuret of arsenic are interesting\r\nto the medical jurist, but particularly the two impure sulphurets last\r\nmentioned. The King’s yellow above all should be carefully studied,\r\nbecause on account of its frequent employment as a fly-poison it has\r\nbeen the source of fatal accidents. It was likewise taken intentionally\r\na few years ago in this city, and proved fatal in thirty-six hours. Dr.\r\nDuncan also, while he was Professor of Medical Jurisprudence, met with\r\nan instance of an attempt to poison by mixing King’s yellow with tea;\r\nand at the Glasgow Spring Circuit of 1822 a woman was tried for\r\npoisoning her child with it.\r\n\r\n_Process for Organic Mixtures._—If sulphuret of arsenic be present in\r\nsuch mixtures in appreciable quantity, the particles, owing to their\r\nintense yellow colour, will be visible in any mass which has not the\r\nsame tint. From this state of admixture they may be removed by adding\r\ncaustic ammonia which dissolves sulphuret of arsenic; and the solution,\r\non being acidulated with muriatic acid, will deposit the sulphuret\r\nsufficiently pure for undergoing the process of reduction.\r\n\r\nSulphuret of arsenic sometimes exists in small quantity in the stomach,\r\nalthough the poison was given in the form of oxide; for a portion of the\r\noxide is subject to be converted into the sulphuret by hydrosulphuric\r\nacid gas evolved in the stomach after death.[564] In every instance of\r\nthe kind yet carefully examined a large proportion of the oxide has\r\nremained unacted on, although the intense colour of the mixed sulphuret\r\nmakes it appear as if that were the only compound present.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      7. _Arseniuretted-Hydrogen._\r\n\r\nThis compound presents the form of a colourless gas, possessing a fetid\r\ngarlicky odour, a density of nearly 2·7, and great virulence as a\r\npoison. It is mentioned here, because accidental poisoning with it has\r\nhappened occasionally within a few years, chiefly owing to the\r\noccasional adulteration of sulphuric acid with arsenic, and the\r\nliability of the arsenic to form arseniuretted-hydrogen when such\r\nsulphuric acid is used to prepare hydrogen gas. Dr. O’Reilly has\r\nmentioned a melancholy instance of a young chemist losing his life in\r\nthis way.[565] Dr. Schlinder of Greifenberg has related another, which\r\ndid not prove fatal.[566] And it is well known that the German chemist\r\nGehlen lost his life by accidentally breathing arseniuretted-hydrogen\r\nwhile engaged in examining its chemical properties.[567] It is an\r\ninflammable body; and its presence in any other gas is easily detected\r\nby burning it according to the method of Marsh.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SECTION II.—_Of the Action of Arsenic and the Symptoms it excites in\r\n                                 Man._\r\n\r\nIt is now generally admitted that arsenic produces in the living body\r\ntwo classes of phenomena,—or that, like the narcotico-acrids, it has a\r\ntwofold action. One action is purely irritant, by virtue of which it\r\ninduces inflammation in the alimentary canal and elsewhere. The other,\r\nalthough it seldom occasions symptoms of narcotism properly so called,\r\nyet obviously consists in a disorder of parts or organs remote from the\r\nseat of its application.\r\n\r\nIt is also the general opinion of toxicologists, that arsenic occasions\r\ndeath more frequently through means of its remote effects than in\r\nconsequence of the local inflammation it excites. In some cases indeed\r\nno symptoms of inflammation occur at all; and in many, although\r\ninflammation is obviously produced, death takes place long before it has\r\nhad time to cause material organic injury. Nevertheless in some, though\r\ncertainly in comparatively few instances, the local action, it must be\r\nadmitted, predominates so much, that the morbid changes of the part\r\nprimarily acted on are alone adequate to account for death.\r\n\r\nIts chief operation being on organs remote from the part to which it is\r\napplied, a natural object of inquiry is, whether this action results\r\nfrom the poison entering the blood, and so passing to the remote organs\r\nacted on, or simply arises from the organ remotely affected sympathizing\r\nthrough the medium of the nerves with the impression made on the organ\r\nwhich is affected primarily. On this question precise experiments are\r\nstill wanted. The general opinion has for some time been that it acts\r\nthrough the blood. And this view has of late been strengthened by\r\nindisputable evidence, that the poison does enter the blood, and is\r\ndiffused by it throughout the body.\r\n\r\nFor a long period chemists sought in vain for arsenic in the animal\r\ntissues and secretions at a distance from the alimentary canal. Such was\r\nthe position of matters at the date of the last edition of this work; in\r\nwhich the failure was ascribed to the methods of analysis then known not\r\nbeing delicate enough to discover the small quantity of arsenic which\r\ndisappears by absorption in cases of poisoning.[568] That statement is\r\nnow referred to, because in a late controversy in France an attempt was\r\nmade, by an erroneous quotation of this work, to deprive Professor\r\nOrfila of the honour, which is due to him alone, of having recently been\r\nthe first to demonstrate the possibility of detecting arsenic throughout\r\nthe organs and secretions generally of the bodies of men and animals\r\npoisoned with it.\r\n\r\nThis most important discovery, pregnant alike with interesting\r\nphysiological deductions and valuable medico-legal applications, was\r\nfirst announced by him to the Parisian Academy of Medicine in January,\r\n1839; when he stated that arsenic is absorbed in such quantity in cases\r\nof poisoning as to admit of being discovered by an improved process of\r\nanalysis in various organs and fluids of the body, such as the liver,\r\nspleen, kidneys, muscles, blood, and urine.[569] In November, 1840, he\r\nproved these facts to the satisfaction of a committee of the\r\nacademy.[570] And since then they have been confirmed by others, not\r\nmerely in express experiments, but likewise in the familiar experience\r\nof medico-legal practice. The situations where arsenic is met with in\r\nlargest quantity are the liver, the spleen, and the urine, but above all\r\nthe liver. The precise circumstances in which it may be found in one or\r\nanother of these quarters have not yet been determined. But in most\r\ncases of acute arsenical poisoning where the search has been made at\r\nall, it has proved successful in the liver. In two late instances I have\r\nreadily found arsenic by the process of Marsh or Reinsch in the liver\r\nafter four months’ interment.\r\n\r\nSince arsenic then is clearly absorbed into the blood, it becomes an\r\ninteresting question whether the organization of the blood is thereby\r\nchanged. This question cannot be answered with confidence. But in all\r\nprobability the blood does undergo some change in its _crasis_; for in\r\nmost cases of acute poisoning that fluid is found after death in a\r\nremarkable state of fluidity [see Section on the Morbid Appearances];\r\nand Mr. James observed that if venous or arterial blood be received into\r\na solution of arsenic, instead of coagulating in the usual way, a\r\nviscous jelly first forms, and lumpy clots separate afterwards.[571]\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the affection induced by the remote action of arsenic\r\nis in some respects vague. Toxicologists have for the most part been\r\nsatisfied with calling it a disorder of the general nervous system. When\r\nemployed to designate the state of collapse which accompanies or forms\r\nthe chief feature of acute cases of poisoning with arsenic, this term is\r\nmisapplied. The whole train of symptoms is that not of a general nervous\r\ndisorder, but simply of depressed action of the heart. That this is the\r\nchief organ remotely acted on in such cases farther appears probable\r\nfrom certain physiological experiments, in which it has been remarked,\r\nthat immediately after rapid death from arsenic the irritability of the\r\nheart was exhausted or nearly so, while that of the intestines, gullet,\r\nand voluntary muscles continued as usual.[572] As to the singular\r\nsymptoms which often arise in the advanced stage of lingering cases, the\r\nterm, disorder of the general nervous system, is more appropriately\r\napplied to them. They clearly indicate a deranged state sometimes of the\r\nbrain, sometimes of particular nerves.\r\n\r\nArsenic belongs to those poisons which act with nearly the same energy\r\nwhatever be the organ or texture to which they are applied. The\r\nexperiments of Sproegel,[573] repeated by Jaeger,[574] and by Sir\r\nBenjamin Brodie,[575] leave no doubt, that when applied to a fresh wound\r\nit acts with at least equal rapidity as when swallowed. Although in such\r\ncircumstances the signs of irritation are often distinct, yet the\r\nsymptoms are on the other hand sometimes more purely narcotic than by\r\nany other mode of administering it,—Sir B. Brodie in particular having\r\nobserved loss of sense and motion to be induced, along with occasional\r\nconvulsions. Arsenic likewise acts with energy when applied to the\r\nconjunctiva of the eye, as was proved by Dr. Campbell. It acts too with\r\ngreat energy when inhaled in the state of vapour into the lungs, or in\r\nthe form of arseniuretted-hydrogen. It farther acts with violence\r\nthrough the mucous membrane of the vagina, producing local inflammation,\r\nand the usual constitutional collapse. These facts were determined\r\nexperimentally by the Medical Inspectors of Copenhagen on the occasion\r\nof a singular trial which will be noticed afterwards. Arsenic also acts,\r\nas may easily be conceived, when injected into the rectum. And farther,\r\nit acts as a poison, when it is applied to the surface of ulcers, yet\r\ncertainly not under all circumstances. Its power of acting through the\r\nunbroken skin has been questioned. Jaeger found that, when it was merely\r\napplied and not rubbed on the skin of animals, it had no effect.[576]\r\nBut some cases will be afterwards mentioned which tend to show that the\r\nreverse probably holds in regard to man. According to the last-mentioned\r\nauthor, who is the only experimentalist that has hitherto examined the\r\nsubject consecutively, arsenic is most active when injected into a vein,\r\nor applied to a fresh wound, or introduced into the sac of the\r\nperitonæum; it is less powerful when taken into the stomach; it is still\r\nless energetic when introduced into the rectum; and it is quite inert\r\nwhen applied to the nerves.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking fact in the action of that poison that, whatever be the\r\ntexture in the body to which it is applied, provided death do not ensue\r\nquickly, it almost always produces symptoms of inflammation in the\r\nstomach; and on inspection after death traces of inflammation are found\r\nin that organ. In some instances of death caused by its outward\r\napplication, the inflamed appearance of the stomach has been greater\r\nthan in many cases where it had been swallowed. Sproegel met with a good\r\nexample of this in a dog killed by a drachm applied to wounds. The whole\r\nstomach and intestines, outwardly and inwardly, were of a deep-red\r\ncolour, blood was extravasated between the membranes, and clots were\r\neven found in the stomach.[577]\r\n\r\nOf the different preparations of arsenic, it may be said in general\r\nterms, that those are most active which are most soluble. In conformity\r\nwith what appears to be a general law in toxicology, the metal itself is\r\ninert. It is difficult to put this fairly to the test, because it is not\r\neasy to pulverize the metal without a sufficient quantity being oxidated\r\nto cause poisonous effects. Bayen and Deyeux, however, found that a\r\ndrachm carefully prepared might be given in fragments to dogs without\r\ninjuring them; and they once gave a cat half an ounce without any other\r\nconsequence than temporary loss of flesh.[578] Its alloys are also\r\ninert. The same experimentalists found it inactive when combined with\r\ntin; and Renault likewise found it inactive when united with sulphur and\r\niron in the ore mispickel, or arsenical pyrites.[579]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that all the other preparations of arsenic are more or\r\nless deleterious.\r\n\r\nA difference of opinion prevails as to the power of the sulphurets.\r\nVarious statements have been published on the subject. But it may be\r\nsufficient to observe, that in consequence of the poisonous properties\r\nof the sulphurets having been imputed to the oxide, with which they are\r\noften adulterated,—Professor Orfila made some experiments with native\r\norpiment and realgar, and with the sulphuret procured by\r\nsulphuretted-hydrogen gas (which are all pure sulphurets); and he found\r\nthat in doses varying from 40 to 70 grains they all caused death in two,\r\nthree, or six days, whether they were applied to a wound, or introduced\r\ninto the stomach.[580] It may appear at first view singular that the\r\nsulphurets, being insoluble, should be poisonous; but the apparent\r\nanomaly vanishes on considering the experiments of M. Decourdemanche\r\nformerly noticed; which prove that in animal fluids the sulphurets are\r\nrapidly changed into the oxide (see p. 225). The sulphurets, however,\r\nare much less active than the preparations in which the metal exists\r\nalready oxidated. Yet in sufficient doses they will prove rapidly fatal.\r\nIn the Acta Germanica there is the case of a woman who was killed in a\r\nfew hours by realgar, mixed by her step-daughter in red cabbage\r\nsoup.[581] The common artificial orpiment procured by sublimation is\r\nvery active, in consequence of the oxide mixed with it. Renault found\r\nthree grains killed a dog in nine hours.[582]\r\n\r\nAmong the less active preparations of arsenic may also be enumerated\r\nsuch of the arsenites and arseniates as are not soluble in water. They\r\nhave not indeed been actually tried. But there can be little doubt that\r\nthey will prove poisonous; because, though insoluble in water, they are\r\nprobably somewhat soluble in the animal juices. We may infer from their\r\nsparing solubility, even in these menstrua, that they will be less\r\nactive than the preparations now to be mentioned, which are more\r\nsoluble.\r\n\r\nThese are the alkaline arsenites and arseniates, arsenic acid, arsenious\r\nacid, the black oxide or fly-powder, and arseniuretted-hydrogen. With\r\nregard to arsenic acid, and the alkaline arseniates and arsenites, it is\r\nprobable, from their effects in medicinal doses, that they are as active\r\nas the white oxide, if not more so. But they have not been particularly\r\nexamined, as they are not objects of great interest to the medical\r\njurist.\r\n\r\nThe fly-powder or black oxide is very active. Renault found that four\r\ngrains killed a middle-sized dog in ten hours.[583] It has been likewise\r\nknown to prove quickly fatal to man. In a French journal there is a case\r\nrelated which ended fatally in sixteen hours;[584] and in the Acta\r\nGermanica is an account of four persons, who died in consequence of\r\neating a dish of stewed pears poisoned with it, and of whom three died\r\nwithin eighteen hours.[585] The dose is not mentioned; but it is\r\nprobable from the collateral circumstances that it was not considerable.\r\n\r\nArseniuretted-hydrogen is probably the most active of all arsenical\r\ncompounds. The celebrated German chemist Gehlen, having accidentally\r\ninhaled a small portion of it, died in nine days with the usual symptoms\r\nof arsenical poisoning. In Dr. O’Reilly’s case, which proved fatal in\r\nseven days, it was computed that the equivalent of twelve grains of\r\noxide had been inhaled. And Dr. Schlinder’s patient had inhaled a\r\nquantity of gas corresponding with only an eighth of a grain of\r\nsesquioxide; yet he appears to have made a narrow escape.[586]\r\n\r\nIt is of some consequence to settle with precision the power of the\r\nwhite oxide. Witnesses are often asked on trials how small a quantity\r\nwill occasion death? It is obvious that this question admits only of a\r\nvague answer: It can be answered at all only in reference to concomitant\r\ncircumstances, and even then but presumptively. Nevertheless, it is\r\nright to be aware what facts are known on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated by various systematic authors that the white oxide\r\nwill prove fatal to man in the dose of two grains. Hahnemann says in\r\nmore special terms, that in circumstances favourable to its action four\r\ngrains may cause death within twenty-four hours, and one or two grains\r\nin a few days.[587] But neither he nor any of the other authors alluded\r\nto have referred to actual cases. Foderé knew half a grain cause colic\r\npains in the stomach and dysenteric flux, which continued obstinately\r\nfor eight days;[588] and I have related an instance where six persons,\r\nafter taking each a grain in wine during dinner, were seriously and\r\nviolently affected for twelve hours.[589] Mr. Alfred Taylor mentions\r\nthree similar cases occasioned by arsenic accidentally taken in port\r\nwine after dinner,—one, an infant of sixteen months who got about a\r\nthird of a grain, another, a lady who took a grain and a half, and the\r\nthird, a gentleman, who had two grains and a half,—in all of whom\r\nviolent vomiting, and prostration, without pain, occurred for three or\r\nfour hours; and the gentleman of the party did not recover for several\r\ndays.[590] M. Lachèse mentions his having met with a number of cases of\r\npoisoning from small doses taken in bread or soup; whence he concludes,\r\nthat an eighth of a grain taken in food may cause vomiting;—that a\r\nquarter of a grain or twice as much taken once only causes vomiting,\r\ncolic, and prostration,—that the same quantity repeated next day renews\r\nthese symptoms in such force as to render the individual unfit for work\r\ntill three or four days afterwards,—and that four such doses, taken at\r\nintervals during two days, that is between one and a half and two grains\r\nin all, excite acute gastro-enteritis and may prove fatal, since two\r\nindividuals who had taken this much died, one in seven weeks, the other\r\nthree weeks later.[591] The smallest fatal dose I have found recorded\r\nelsewhere is four grains and a half; and death ensued in six hours\r\nonly.[592] But the subject was a child, four years old, and the poison\r\nwas taken in solution. Alberti mentions the case of a man who died from\r\ntaking six grains; but I am unacquainted with the particulars, not\r\nhaving seen the original account.[593] Two children, whose cases are\r\nalluded to in the Proceedings of the Academy of Medicine of Paris, died,\r\nthe one in two days, the other a day later, after taking rather less\r\nthan sixteen grains. The former was four years and a half old, the\r\nlatter seven years.[594] Valentini alludes to a case where thirty grains\r\nof the oxide in powder killed an adult in six days.[595] The effects of\r\nmedicinal doses, which seldom exceed a quarter of a grain without\r\ncausing irritation of the stomach, and the fatal effects of somewhat\r\nlarger doses on animals, Renault having found that a single grain in\r\nsolution killed a large dog in four hours,[596] must convince every one\r\nthat the general statement of Hahnemann cannot be very wide of the\r\ntruth. Mr. Taylor thinks his own cases mentioned above throw doubt over\r\nthis inference. But it must be remembered, that his patients had dined\r\njust before taking the poison.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that the activity of oxide of arsenic is impaired\r\nby admixture with other insoluble powders. M. Bertrand, conceiving from\r\nsome experiments on animals that he had found an antidote for arsenic in\r\ncharcoal powder, took no less than five grains of the oxide mixed with\r\nthat substance, and he did not suffer any injury, although his stomach\r\nwas empty at the time, and he did not vomit.[597] But Orfila afterwards\r\nshowed, that other insoluble powders, such as clay, have the same\r\neffect; that no such powder can be of any use if not introduced into the\r\nstomach till after the arsenic is swallowed; and that they appear to act\r\nsolely by enveloping the arsenical powder and preventing it from\r\ntouching the membrane of the alimentary canal.[598] Although M.\r\nBertrand’s discovery will not supply the physician with an antidote, the\r\nmedical jurist will not lose sight of the interesting fact, that, by\r\ncertain mechanical admixtures, arsenic in moderate doses may be entirely\r\ndeprived of its poisonous quality. A singular case of recovery from no\r\nless a dose than sixty grains, which happened in the case of an American\r\nphysician, probably comes under the same head with the experiments of\r\nBertrand,—a large quantity of powder of cinchona-bark having been\r\nswallowed along with the arsenic. In this case, however, the symptoms\r\nwere severe for three days.[599]\r\n\r\nThe tendency of habit to modify the action of arsenic is questionable.\r\nSo far as authentic facts go, habit has no power of familiarizing the\r\nconstitution to its use. One no doubt may hear now and then of\r\nmountebanks who swallow without injury entire scruples or drachms of\r\narsenic, and vague accounts have reached me of patients who took\r\nunusually large doses for medicinal purposes. But as to facts of the\r\nformer kind, it is clear that no importance can be attached to them; for\r\nit is impossible to know how much of the feat is genuine, and how much\r\nlegerdemain. With respect to the latter facts, I have never been able to\r\nascertain any precise instance of the kind; and so far as my own\r\nexperience goes, the habit of taking arsenic in medicinal doses has\r\nquite an opposite effect from familiarizing the stomach to it.\r\n\r\nOxide of arsenic being sparingly soluble, its operation is often much\r\ninfluenced by the condition of the stomach as to food at the time it is\r\nswallowed. If the stomach be empty, it adheres with tenacity to the\r\nvillous coat and acts with energy. If the stomach be full at the time,\r\nthe first portions that come in contact with the inner membrane may\r\ncause vomiting before it can be diffused, so that the whole or greater\r\npart is discharged. One remarkable case of this nature has been quoted\r\nin page 29. In another, where severe symptoms did supervene, and\r\nrecovery was ascribed to the use of magnesia as an antidote, the\r\nfavourable result seems to have been really owing to the circumstance,\r\nthat the patient had supped heartily not long before taking the\r\narsenic.[600] An extraordinary case related by Mr. Kerr, in which nearly\r\nthree-quarters of an ounce were retained for two hours without causing\r\nany serious mischief, probably comes under the same category; for the\r\narsenic was taken immediately after a meal, and the stomach was cleared\r\nout by emetics.[601]\r\n\r\nIn the following detail of the symptoms caused by arsenic in man, its\r\neffects when swallowed will be first noticed; and then some remarks will\r\nbe added on the phenomena observed when it is introduced through other\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of poisoning with arsenic may be advantageously considered\r\nunder three heads. In one set of cases there are signs of violent\r\nirritation of the alimentary canal and sometimes of the other mucous\r\nmembranes also, accompanied with excessive general depression, but not\r\nwith distinct disorder of the nervous system. When such cases prove\r\nfatal, which they generally do, they terminate for the most part in from\r\ntwenty-four hours to three days. In a second and very singular set of\r\ncases there is little sign of irritation in any part of the alimentary\r\ncanal; perhaps trivial vomiting or slight pain in the stomach, but\r\nsometimes neither; the patient is chiefly or solely affected with\r\nexcessive prostration of strength and frequent fainting; and death is\r\nseldom delayed beyond the fifth or sixth hour. In a third set of cases\r\nlife is commonly prolonged at least six days, sometimes much longer, or\r\nrecovery may even take place after a tedious illness; and the signs of\r\ninflammation in the alimentary canal are succeeded or become\r\naccompanied, about the second or fourth day or later, by symptoms of\r\nirritation in the other mucous passages, and more particularly by\r\nsymptoms indicating a derangement of the nervous system, such as palsy\r\nor epilepsy. The distinctions now laid down will be found in practice to\r\nbe well defined, and useful for estimating in criminal cases the weight\r\nof the evidence from symptoms.\r\n\r\n1. In one order of cases, then, arsenic produces symptoms of irritation\r\nor inflammation along the course of the alimentary canal. Such cases are\r\nthe most frequent of all. The person commonly survives twenty-four\r\nhours, seldom more than three days; but instances of the kind have\r\nsometimes proved fatal in a few hours, and others have lasted for weeks.\r\nOn the whole, however, if the case is much shorter than twenty-four\r\nhours, or longer than three days, its complexion is apt to be altered.\r\nIn the mildest examples of the present variety recovery takes place\r\nafter a few attacks of vomiting, and slight general indisposition for a\r\nday or two.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the ordinary progress of the symptoms, the first of a\r\ndecisive character are sickness and faintness. It is generally thought\r\nindeed that the first symptom is an acrid taste; but this notion has\r\nbeen already shown to be erroneous. For some account of the sensations\r\nfelt in the act of swallowing the poison, the reader may refer to what\r\nhas been stated in p. 200. There is no doubt, that in the way in which\r\narsenic is usually given with a criminal intent, namely, mixed with\r\narticles of food, it seldom makes any impression at all upon the senses\r\nduring the act of swallowing.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the sickness and faintness, particularly when the\r\npoison was taken in solution, have begun a few minutes after it was\r\nswallowed. Thus in a case mentioned by Bernt, in which a solution of\r\narseniate of potass was taken, the symptoms began violently in fifteen\r\nminutes;[602] in one related by Wildberg, where the oxide was given in\r\ncoffee, the person was affected immediately on taking the second\r\ncup;[603] in one related by Mr. Edwards, the patient was taken ill in\r\neight minutes,[604] in one mentioned by M. Lachèse of Angers, violent\r\nsymptoms commenced within ten minutes after the poison was swallowed\r\nwith prunes;[605] in a case communicated to me by Mr. J. H. Stallard of\r\nLeicester, the symptoms set in with violence ten minutes after it was\r\ntaken dissolved in tea; nay, in a case of poisoning with orpiment in\r\nsoup, mentioned by Valentini, the man felt unwell before he had finished\r\nhis soup, and set it aside as disagreeable.[606] It is a mistake\r\ntherefore to suppose, as I have known some do, that arsenic never begins\r\nto operate for at least half an hour. Nevertheless it must be admitted,\r\nthat in general arsenic does not act for half an hour after it is\r\nswallowed.—On the other hand, its operation is seldom delayed beyond an\r\nhour. The following, however, are exceptions to this rule. Lachèse in\r\nthe paper quoted above mentions an instance where the interval was two\r\nhours, and where the issue was eventually fatal. The arsenic had been in\r\nvery coarse powder. Mr. Macaulay of Leicester has communicated to me a\r\ncase where the individual took the poison at eight in the evening, went\r\nto bed at half-past nine, and slept till eleven, when he awoke with\r\nslight pain in the stomach, vomiting, and cold sweats. In this instance\r\nthe dose was seven drachms, and death took place in nine hours. M.\r\nDevergie has related a similar case of poisoning with the sulphuret,\r\nwhere the symptoms did not begin for three hours; and here too the\r\npatient fell asleep immediately after swallowing the poison.[607]\r\nProfessor Orfila has noticed an instance, to be quoted afterwards, where\r\nthere appears to have been scarcely any symptom at all for five\r\nhours[608] (p. 243). I suspect we must also consider as an instance of\r\nthe same kind the case which gave occasion to the trial of Mrs. Smith\r\nhere in 1827. A white draught was administered in a suspicious manner at\r\nten in the evening; the girl immediately went to bed; and no symptoms\r\nappeared till six next morning, from which time her illness went on\r\nuninterruptedly.[609] In three of the preceding cases it will be\r\nremarked that sleep intervened between the taking of the poison and the\r\ninvasion of the symptoms; and it is therefore not improbable that the\r\nreason of the retardation is the comparative inactivity of the animal\r\nsystem during sleep.—In voluntary poisoning, as in a case related by Dr.\r\nRoget, a slight attack of sickness or vomiting occasionally ensues\r\nimmediately after solid arsenic is swallowed, and some time before the\r\nsymptoms commence regularly.[610]\r\n\r\nThe observations now made will often prove important for deciding\r\naccusations of poisoning; for pointed evidence may be derived from the\r\ncommencement of the symptoms, after a suspected meal, corresponding or\r\nnot corresponding with the interval which is known to elapse in\r\nascertained cases. The reader will see the effect of such evidence in\r\nattaching guilt to the prisoner in the case of Margaret Wishart, which I\r\nhave detailed elsewhere.[611] In the trial of Mrs. Smith, the want of\r\nthe correspondence just mentioned contributed greatly to her acquittal;\r\nfor the symptoms of poisoning did not begin till more than eight hours\r\nafter the only occasion on which the prisoner was proved to have\r\nadministered any thing in a suspicious manner. As I was not at the time\r\nacquainted with any parallel case except that recorded by Orfila, I\r\nhesitated to ascribe the symptoms to the draught; and consequently, as\r\nthe other medical witnesses felt the same hesitation on the same\r\naccount, the proof of administration was considered to have failed. I am\r\nnot sure that I should have now felt the same difficulty. The\r\nintervening state of sleep probably affords an explanation of the long\r\ninterval; and the cases noticed by Mr. Macaulay and M. Devergie are\r\nparallel, though the interval in them was certainly not so great.—There\r\nis a limit, however, to the possible interval in such cases. It seems\r\nimpossible that the action of the poison shall be suspended for three\r\nentire days. Yet death has been ascribed to arsenic in such\r\ncircumstances. A child 3½ years old having swallowed eight grains with\r\nbread and butter, but being soon made to vomit forcibly by emetics,\r\npresented no decided symptom at the time, or for three days more; but on\r\nthe fourth day difficult breathing ensued, with anxiety of expression,\r\nfrequency of the pulse, and heat of the skin; and next day death took\r\nplace. There was no morbid appearance found in the body.[612] I do not\r\nknow of any parallel instance of death from arsenic, and cannot admit\r\nthat the poison was the cause of the symptoms and fatal event.\r\n\r\nSoon after the sickness begins, or about the same time, the region of\r\nthe stomach feels painful, the pain being commonly of a burning kind,\r\nand much aggravated by pressure. Violent fits of vomiting and retching\r\nthen speedily ensue, especially when drink is taken. There is often also\r\na sense of dryness, heat, and tightness in the throat, creating an\r\nincessant desire for drink; and this affection often precedes the\r\nvomiting. Occasionally it is wanting, at other times so severe as to be\r\nattended with suffocation and convulsive vomiting at the sight of\r\nfluids.[613] Hoarseness and difficulty of speech are commonly combined\r\nwith it. The matter vomited is greenish or yellowish; but sometimes\r\nstreaked or mixed with blood, particularly when the case lasts longer\r\nthan a day.\r\n\r\nIn no long time after the first illness diarrhœa generally makes its\r\nappearance, but not always. In some cases, instead of it, the patient is\r\ntormented by frequent, ineffectual calls: in others the great intestines\r\nare scarcely affected. About this time the pain in the stomach is\r\nexcruciating, and is often likened by the sufferer to a fire burning\r\nwithin him. It likewise extends more or less downwards, particularly\r\nwhen the diarrhœa or tenesmus is severe; and the belly is commonly tense\r\nand tender, sometimes also swollen, though not frequently,—sometimes\r\neven on the contrary drawn in at the navel.[614] When the diarrhœa is\r\nsevere, the anus is commonly excoriated and affected with burning\r\npain.[615] In such cases the burning pain may extend along the whole\r\ncourse of the alimentary canal from the throat to the anus. Nay at times\r\nthe mouth and lips are also inflamed, presenting dark specks or\r\nblisters.[616]\r\n\r\nSometimes there are likewise present signs of irritation of the lungs\r\nand air-passages,—almost always shortness of breath (which, however, is\r\nchiefly owing to the tenderness of the belly),—often a sense of\r\ntightness across the bottom of the chest, and more rarely decided pain\r\nin the same quarter, darting also through the upper part of the chest.\r\nSometimes pneumonia has appeared a prominent affection during life, and\r\nbeen distinctly traced in the dead body.[617]\r\n\r\nIn many instances, too, the urinary passages are affected, the patient\r\nbeing harassed with frequent, painful and difficult micturition,\r\nswelling of the penis, and pain in the region of the bladder, or, if a\r\nfemale, with burning pain of the vagina and excoriation of the\r\nlabia.[618] Sometimes the irritation of the urinary organs is so great\r\nas to be attended with total suppression of urine, as in a case related\r\nby Guilbert of Montpellier, in which this symptom continued several\r\ndays.[619] During the late contentions among chemists, physiologists,\r\nand physicians, occasioned by the case of Madame Lafarge, it was alleged\r\nby Flandin and Danger that in animals the urine is always suppressed, by\r\nOrfila that it is always secreted, by Professor Delafond of the Alfort\r\nVeterinary School, that it is never suppressed, but always diminished,\r\nand sometimes even to a sixth of the natural quantity.[620] There is,\r\nhowever, no invariable rule in the matter. And in fact, urinary symptoms\r\nare seldom present unless the lower bowels are likewise strongly\r\nirritated; but are then seldom altogether wanting. They are rarely well\r\nmarked in cases of the present variety, unless life is prolonged three\r\ndays or more.\r\n\r\nWhen symptoms of irritation of the alimentary canal have subsisted a few\r\nhours, convulsive motions often occur. They commence on the trunk,\r\nafterwards extend over the whole body, are seldom violent, and generally\r\nconsist of nothing else than tremors and twitches. Cramps of the legs\r\nand arms, a possible concomitant of every kind of diarrhœa, is\r\npeculiarly severe and frequent in that caused by arsenic.\r\n\r\nThe general system always sympathizes acutely with the local\r\nderangement. The pulse commonly becomes very small, feeble and rapid\r\nsoon after the vomiting sets in; and in no long time it is often\r\nimperceptible. This state is naturally attended with great coldness,\r\nclammy sweats, and lividity of the feet and hands. Another symptom\r\nreferrible to the circulation which has been observed, though, very\r\nrarely, is palpitation.[621]\r\n\r\nThe countenance is commonly collapsed from an early period, and almost\r\nalways expressive of great torture and extreme anxiety or despair; the\r\neyes are red and sparkling; the conjunctiva often so injected as to seem\r\ninflamed; the tongue and mouth parched; and the velum and palate\r\nsometimes covered with little white ulcers.\r\n\r\nDelirium sometimes accompanies the advanced stage, and stupor also is\r\nnot unfrequent. Coma occasionally precedes death, as in Mr. Stallard’s\r\ncase (p. 235), in which the symptoms of irritation, at first very\r\nviolent, gradually gave place in two hours to complete insensibility,\r\nproving fatal in two hours more. Very often, however, the patient\r\nremains quite sensible to the last. Death in general comes on calmly,\r\nbut is sometimes preceded by a paroxysm of convulsions.[622] In some\r\ncases it takes place quite unexpectedly, as if from sudden deliquium, as\r\nin a case mentioned by Dr. Dymock of this city. The patient, a girl who\r\nhad taken two ounces intentionally, rose from her bed without help two\r\nhours and a half afterwards, went to a chair at the fireside, and had\r\nscarce sat down when she expired.[623]\r\n\r\nVarious eruptions have at times been observed, especially in those who\r\nsurvive several days; but they are more frequent in the kind of cases to\r\nbe considered afterwards, in which life is prolonged for a week or more.\r\nThe eruptions have been variously described as resembling petechiæ, or\r\nmeasles, or red miliaria, or small-pox. In the case already quoted from\r\nGuilbert a copious eruption of miliary vesicles appeared on the fifth\r\nday, and for fifteen days afterwards. They were attended with\r\nperspiration and abatement of the other symptoms, and followed with\r\ndesquamation of the cuticle. Another external affection which may be\r\nnoticed is general swelling of the body. Several cases of this nature\r\nhave been described by Dr. Schlegel of Meiningen; and in one of them the\r\nswelling, particularly round the eyes, appears to have been\r\nconsiderable.[624]\r\n\r\nIn some cases of the kind now under consideration a short remission or\r\neven a total intermission of all the distressing symptoms has been\r\nwitnessed, particularly when death is retarded till the close of the\r\nsecond or third day.[625] This remission, which is accompanied with\r\ndozing stupor, is most generally observed about the beginning of the\r\nsecond day. It is merely temporary, the symptoms speedily returning with\r\nequal or increased violence. Sometimes the remission occurs oftener than\r\nonce, as in a case related in the London Medical and Physical Journal.\r\nThe patient, a child seven years old, lived thirty-six hours in a state\r\nof alternate calm and excitement; and during the state of calm no pulse\r\nwas to be felt at the wrists.[626]—So far as at present appears a long\r\nintermission is impossible.\r\n\r\nIn cases such as those now described death often occurs about\r\ntwenty-four hours after the poison is swallowed, and generally before\r\nthe close of the third day. But on the one hand life has been sometimes\r\nprolonged, without the supervention of the symptoms belonging to a\r\ndifferent variety of cases, for five or six days,[627] nay perhaps even\r\nfor several weeks. And, on the other hand, the symptoms of irritation of\r\nthe alimentary canal are sometimes distinct, although death takes place\r\nin a much shorter period than twenty-four hours. Metzger has related a\r\nstriking case, fatal in six hours, in which the symptoms were acute\r\ncolic pain, violent vomiting, and profuse diarrhœa;[628] and Wildberg\r\nhas related a similar case fatal in the same time.[629] Hohnbaum\r\ndescribes another fatal in five hours;[630] and I met with as brief a\r\ncase in this city in 1843, where all the usual symptoms of irritation in\r\nthe stomach and bowels were violent. These symptoms were also present at\r\nfirst in Mr. Stallard’s case, which was fatal in four hours; Pyl has\r\nrecorded one, where all the signs of irritation in the stomach and\r\nintestines were present, except vomiting, and which proved fatal in\r\nthree hours;[631] and Dr. Dymock met here with a similar instance which\r\nlasted only two hours and a half.[632] This is one of the shortest\r\nundoubted cases of poisoning from arsenic I have hitherto found in\r\nauthentic records. Dr. Male mentions one, which was fatal in four\r\nhours;[633] Wepfer another equally short;[634] Johnston another fatal in\r\nthree hours and a half;[635] and I shall presently mention others\r\nwithout symptoms of irritation which ended fatally in two, five, or six\r\nhours [p. 242].[636] Wibmer has even quoted a case fatal in half an\r\nhour; but there seems to have been some doubt whether the poison taken\r\nwas arsenic.[637]\r\n\r\nSuch is an account of the symptoms of poisoning by arsenic in their most\r\nfrequent form. It will of course be understood, that they are liable to\r\na great variety as to violence, as well as their mode of combination in\r\nactual cases;—and that they are by no means all present in every\r\ninstance. The most remarkable and least variable of them all, pain and\r\nvomiting, are sometimes wanting. A case, in which pain was not felt in\r\nthe stomach, even on pressure, although the other symptoms of\r\ninflammation were present, has been briefly described in the Medical\r\nRepository.[638] A similar case fatal in fourteen hours and a half,\r\nwhere there was much vomiting and some heat in the stomach, but no pain\r\nor tenderness, has been related by Dr. E. Gairdner.[639] Another very\r\nstriking example of this anomalous deficiency has been detailed by Dr.\r\nYellowly. A lad sixteen years old died twenty-one hours after swallowing\r\nhalf an ounce of the white oxide; and the presence of inflammation was\r\ndenoted all along by sickness, vomiting, purging, and heat in the\r\ntongue; yet he never complained of pain, neither did he ever seem to his\r\nfriends to suffer any. Another anomaly in the case was, that the pulse,\r\ncontrary to what is usual, was very slow: twelve hours after he took the\r\npoison, the pulse was 40, and two hours before death it was so slow as\r\n30.[640] These deviations from the ordinary course of the symptoms are\r\ntaken notice of merely to put the practitioner on his guard, and prevent\r\nthe medical jurist from drawing hasty conclusions. Upon the whole, they\r\nare rare; and the symptoms of poisoning by arsenic are in general very\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\n2. The second variety of poisoning with arsenic includes a few cases in\r\nwhich the signs of inflammation are far from violent or even altogether\r\nwanting, and in which death ensues in five or six hours or a little\r\nmore,—at a period too early for inflammation to be always properly\r\ndeveloped. The symptoms are then generally obscure, and are referrible\r\nchiefly to the mode of action, which is probably the cause of death in\r\nmost cases,—a powerful debilitating influence on the circulation, or on\r\nthe nervous system.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms occasionally amount to absolute narcotism, as in some of\r\nthe animals on which Sir B. Brodie experimented. Thus, when he injected\r\na solution of the oxide into the stomach of a dog, the pulse was\r\nrendered slow and intermitting; the animal became palsied in the\r\nhind-legs, lethargic, and in no long time insensible, with dilated\r\npupils; and soon afterwards it was seized with convulsions, amidst which\r\nit died, fifty minutes after the poison was administered.[641] In man\r\nthe symptoms very seldom resembled so closely those of the narcotic\r\npoisons. In Mr. Stallard’s case, however, formerly mentioned, the\r\nsymptoms of irritation which appeared at first speedily gave place to\r\ncomplete insensibility for two hours before death (pp. 235, 238), a\r\nsimilar instance has been related in Henke’s Journal. A young man who\r\ngot an arsenical solution from an old woman to cure ague, was attacked\r\nafter taking it with vomiting and loud cries, afterwards with incoherent\r\ntalking, then fell into a deep sleep, and finally perished in\r\nconvulsions in five hours.[642]\r\n\r\nIn some cases of the kind now under consideration, one or two attacks of\r\nvomiting occur at the usual interval after the taking of the poison; but\r\nit seldom continues. The most uniform and remarkable affection is\r\nextreme faintness, amounting at times to deliquium. Occasionally there\r\nis some stupor, or rather oppression, and often slight convulsions. Pain\r\nin the stomach is generally present; but it is slight, and seldom\r\naccompanied with other signs of internal inflammation. Death commonly\r\ntakes place in a few hours. Yet, even when it is retarded till the\r\nbeginning of the second day, the faintness and stupor are sometimes more\r\nstriking features in the case than the symptoms of inflammation in the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nThis variety of poisoning has been hitherto observed only under the\r\nthree following circumstances,—when the dose of poison was large,—when\r\nit was in little masses,—or when it was in a state of solution. The mode\r\nin which the first and last circumstances operate is evident; they\r\nfacilitate the absorption of a large quantity of arsenic in a short\r\nspace of time, so that its remote action begins before local\r\ninflammation is fully developed. But it is not easy to see how any such\r\neffect can flow from the arsenic being in little masses. It is also to\r\nbe observed that none of the circumstances here mentioned is invariable\r\nin its operation. An instance is related in Rust’s Magazine, of the\r\ncustomary signs of irritation having been produced even by the\r\nsolution.[643]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the present variety of poisoning is rather uncommon, and\r\nindeed, although the attention of the profession was pointedly called to\r\nit even in the first edition of the present work, its existence does not\r\nseem to be so generally known as it ought to be.[644] It may be right\r\ntherefore to specify the cases which have been published.\r\n\r\nIn the Medical and Philosophical Journal of New York,[645] is related\r\nthe case of a druggist, who swallowed an ounce of powdered arsenic at\r\nonce, and died in eight hours, after two or three fits of vomiting,\r\nwith slight pain and heat in the stomach.—A similar case has been\r\nrelated by Metzger. A young woman died in a few hours, after suffering\r\nfrom trivial diarrhœa, pain in the stomach and strangury; her death\r\nwas immediately preceded by slight convulsions and fits of\r\nsuffocation; and on dissection the stomach and intestines were found\r\nquite healthy. Half an ounce of arsenic was found in the\r\nstomach.[646]—A third case similar in its particulars to the two\r\npreceding was submitted to me for investigation by the sheriff of this\r\ncounty in 1825. The subject, a girl fourteen years of age, took about\r\nninety grains, and died in five hours, having vomited once or twice,\r\ncomplained of some little pain in the belly, and been affected towards\r\nthe close with great faintness and weakness. The stomach and\r\nintestines were healthy.[647]—A fourth case allied to these is\r\nsuccinctly told in the Medical and Physical Journal. The person\r\nexpired in five hours; and vomiting never occurred, even though\r\nemetics were given.[648]—A fifth has been related by M. Gérard of\r\nBeauvais. The subject was a man so addicted to drinking, that his\r\ndaily allowance was a pint of brandy. When first seen, there was so\r\nmuch tranquillity, that doubts were entertained whether arsenic had\r\nreally been swallowed; but at length he was discovered actually\r\nchewing it. This state continued for nearly five hours, when some\r\nvomiting ensued: coldness of the extremities and spasmodic flexion of\r\nthe legs soon followed; and in a few minutes more he expired.[649]—A\r\nsixth and very singular case of the same kind has been described by\r\nOrfila. The individual having swallowed three drachms at eight in the\r\nmorning, went about for two hours bidding adieu to his friends and\r\ntelling what he had done. He was then prevailed on to take emetics and\r\ndiluents, which caused free, easy vomiting. He suffered very little\r\ntill one, when he became affected with constricting pain and burning\r\nin the stomach, feeble pulse, cold sweats, and cadaverous expression,\r\nunder which symptoms he died four hours later.[650] Orfila justly\r\ndesignates this case as the most extraordinary instance of poisoning\r\nwith arsenic that has come under his notice.—A seventh is related by\r\nMr. Holland of Manchester where death took place in the course of\r\neight or nine hours, and the symptoms were at first some vomiting,\r\nafterwards little else but faintness, sickness, a sullen expression,\r\nand a general appearance which led those around to suppose the\r\nindividual intoxicated.[651]—Professor Chaussier has described a still\r\nmore striking case than any yet mentioned. A stout middle-aged man\r\nswallowed a large quantity of arsenic in fragments and died in a few\r\nhours. He experienced nothing but great feebleness and frequent\r\ntendency to fainting. The stomach and intestines were not in the\r\nslightest degree affected during life; and no morbid appearance could\r\nbe discovered in them after death,[652]—A similar instance not less\r\nremarkable has been communicated to me by Mr. Macauley of Leicester,\r\nwhere the individual died with narcotic symptoms only within two hours\r\nafter taking nearly a quarter of a pound of arsenic.—Another fatal in\r\nfour hours has been described by Mr. Wright, where the symptoms were\r\nvomiting under the use of emetics, great exhaustion, feeble hurried\r\npulse, cold sweating, drowsiness and finally stupor. In this case the\r\nquantity of arsenic taken was about an ounce.[653]—Another of the same\r\nnature is recorded by Morgagni. An old woman stole and ate a cake,\r\nwhich had been poisoned with arsenic for rats. She died in twelve\r\nhours, suffering, says Morgagni, rather from excessive prostration of\r\nstrength than from pain or convulsions.[654]—The following case\r\nrelated by M. Laborde is most remarkable in its circumstances. A young\r\nwoman was caught in the act of swallowing little fragments of arsenic,\r\nand it afterwards appeared that she had been employed most of the day\r\nin literally cracking and chewing lumps of it. When the physician\r\nfirst saw her the countenance expressed chagrin and melancholy, but\r\nnot suffering. After being forced to drink she vomited a good deal,\r\nbut without uneasiness. Two hours afterwards her countenance was\r\nanxious; but she did not make any complaint, and very soon resumed her\r\ntranquillity. Five hours after the last portions of the poison were\r\ntaken she became drowsy, then remained perfectly calm for four hours\r\nmore, and at length on trying to sit up in bed, complained of slight\r\npain in the stomach, and expired without agony. A clot of blood was\r\nfound in the stomach.[655]—Dr. Platner of Pavia describes a case,\r\nfatal probably in five hours, where the symptoms were a tranquil,\r\nmelancholic expression, great coldness, paleness of the features, slow\r\nlanguid pulse, retarded respiration, and suppression of urine, but no\r\npain or swelling of the belly, and no diarrhœa till near death, when\r\nthere was one copious fluid evacuation.[656]—Lastly, Dr. Choulant has\r\nrelated the case of an elderly female who got a thimbleful of arsenic\r\nin soup, and died in eleven hours, affected with occasional, easy\r\nvomiting, uneasiness, thirst, and undefinable uneasiness in the chest,\r\nbut without pain of any kind, or any other complaint.[657]\r\n\r\nThe cases of which an abstract has here been given, will, it is\r\napprehended, be sufficient to correct the erroneous impression of\r\nmany,—that arsenic, when it proves fatal, always produces violent and\r\nwell-marked symptoms. It will of course be understood that cases of the\r\npresent kind pass by insensible shades into those of the first\r\nclass,—the following, for example, being intermediate between the two. A\r\nyoung man had frequent vomiting and diarrhœa, which were supposed to\r\ndepend on indigestion merely, as the countenance was calm, without any\r\nappearance of suffering, the appetite tolerable, and the abdomen quite\r\nfree of tenderness. The pulse, however, quickly sunk, the voice failed,\r\nand death took place in eleven hours; and on dissection about twenty\r\ngrains of arsenic were found in the stomach with strong signs of\r\ninflammation.[658]—In a case communicated to me by a former pupil, Mr.\r\nAdams of Glasgow, that of a woman who died five hours after taking six\r\ndrachms of arsenic, there was some vomiting not long after she swallowed\r\nit; but subsequently she presented no prominent symptoms except a\r\nghastly expression, redness of the eyes, a fluttering pulse and extreme\r\nprostration, until within half an hour before death, when the action of\r\nan emetic and the stomach-pump was followed by severe burning pain.\r\n\r\n3. The third variety of poisoning with arsenic places in a clear point\r\nof view its occasional action on the nervous system. This occurs chiefly\r\nin persons who, from having taken but a small quantity, or from having\r\nvomited soon after, are eventually rescued from destruction; but it has\r\nalso been met with in some cases where death ensued after a protracted\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nIn such cases the progress of the poisoning may be divided into two\r\nstages. The first train of symptoms is exactly that of the first or\r\ninflammatory variety, and is commonly developed in a very perfect and\r\nviolent form. In the second stage the symptoms are referrible to nervous\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\nThese generally come on when the former begin to recede; yet sometimes\r\nthey make their appearance earlier, while the signs of inflammation in\r\nthe alimentary canal continue violent; and more rarely both classes of\r\nsymptoms begin about the same period. The nervous affection varies in\r\ndifferent individuals. The most formidable is coma; the slightest, a\r\npeculiar, imperfect palsy of the arms or legs, resembling what is\r\noccasioned by the poison of lead; and between these extremes have been\r\nobserved epileptic fits, or tetanus, or an affection resembling\r\nhysteria, or mania. As these affections are of much interest, in respect\r\nto the evidence of poisoning from symptoms, it may be well to relate in\r\nabstract a few characteristic examples of each.\r\n\r\nA good example of epilepsy supervening on the ordinary symptoms of\r\ninflammation has been minutely related by Dr. Roget. A girl swallowed a\r\ndrachm of arsenic, and was in consequence attacked violently with the\r\nusual symptoms of irritation in the whole alimentary canal. After being\r\nill about twenty-four hours, she experienced several distinct remissions\r\nand had some repose, attended with fainting. In twelve hours more she\r\nbegan to improve rapidly; the pain subsided, her strength and spirits\r\nreturned, and the stomach became capable of retaining liquids. So far\r\nthis patient laboured under the common effects of arsenic. But a new\r\ntrain of symptoms then gradually approached. Towards the close of the\r\nsecond day she was harassed with frightful dreams, starting from sleep,\r\nand tendency to faint; next morning with coldness along the spine,\r\ngiddiness, and intolerance of light; and on the fourth day with aching\r\nof the extremities and tingling of the whole skin. These symptoms\r\ncontinued till the close of the sixth day, when she was suddenly seized\r\nwith convulsions of the left side, foaming at the mouth, and total\r\ninsensibility. The convulsions endured two hours, the insensibility\r\nthroughout the whole night. Next evening she had another and a similar\r\nfit. A third, but slighter fit occurred on the morning of the tenth;\r\nanother next day at noon; and they continued to return occasionally till\r\nthe nineteenth day. For some time longer she was affected with tightness\r\nacross the chest and stomach complaints; but she was eventually restored\r\nto perfect health.[659]\r\n\r\nA characteristic set of similar cases, which occurred in London in 1815,\r\nhas been related in a treatise on arsenic by Mr. Marshall.[660] They\r\nwere the subject of investigation on the trial of Eliza Fenning, a\r\nmaid-servant, who attempted to poison the whole of her master’s family\r\nby mixing arsenic with a dumpling, and whose condemnation excited an\r\nextraordinary sensation at the time, as many persons believed her to be\r\ninnocent. Five individuals partook of the poisoned dish, and they were\r\nall violently seized with the usual inflammatory symptoms. But farther,\r\none had an epileptic fit on the first day, which returned on the second,\r\nand he had besides frequent twitches of the muscles of the trunk, a\r\nfeeling of numbness in one side, and heat and tingling of the feet and\r\nhands. Another had tremors of the right arm and leg on the first day,\r\nand several epileptic fits in the course of the night. During the next\r\nfifteen days he had a paroxysm every evening about the same hour; which\r\nreturned after an intermission of eight days, and frequently for several\r\nmonths afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn the following set of cases the nervous symptoms exhibited a singular\r\ncombination of delirium, convulsions, tetanus, and coma, such as is\r\nfrequently met with in paroxysms of hysteria; but the cases are probably\r\nnot pure examples of poisoning with arsenic, for liver of sulphur was\r\nadministered as a remedy to a considerable amount. Three servant girls\r\nin one of the Hebrides ate a mixture of lard, sugar, and arsenic, which\r\nhad been laid for destroying rats. The ordinary signs of irritation in\r\nthe stomach ensued, but on the following morning were greatly mitigated.\r\nThey were then ordered twelve grains of liver of sulphur every other\r\nhour. Soon afterwards the inflammatory symptoms became more severe, the\r\nroot of the tongue swelled and inflamed, and in the afternoon two of\r\nthem lost the power of speech and swallowing, and were attacked with\r\nlocked-jaw and general convulsions. The third had not locked-jaw, but\r\nwas otherwise similarly, affected. On the morning of the third day one\r\nof the two former was found comatose, with continuance of the locked-jaw\r\nand occasional return of convulsions; and on being roused by venesection\r\nand the cold affusion, she complained of headache and heat in the\r\nthroat. The sulphuret of potass, which had been discontinued on account\r\nof the locked-jaw, was then resumed. On the evening of the fourth day\r\nthe headache increased, and the patient became delirious and\r\nunmanageable. The cold affusion, however, soon restored her again to her\r\nsenses, and from that time her recovery was progressive. In the other\r\npatients the symptoms were similar, but less violent. In these instances\r\nthe evidence of an injury of the nervous system was decisive; but it may\r\nbe doubted whether the symptoms were not, in part at least, owing to the\r\nsulphuret of potass, which has been already described as an active\r\npoison, capable of inducing convulsions and tetanus. Its properties were\r\nnot generally known in this country at the time the cases in question\r\nhappened.[661]\r\n\r\nSometimes the convulsions caused by arsenic assume the form of pure\r\ntetanus. At least a case of this affection is noticed by Portal.[662] He\r\nhas given only a mere announcement of it; and I have not hitherto met\r\nwith a parallel instance in authors.\r\n\r\nA common nervous affection in the advanced stage of the more tedious\r\ncases of poisoning with arsenic is partial palsy. Palsy in the form of\r\nincomplete paraplegia is a very common symptom even of the early stage\r\nin animals, and has been also sometimes observed during that stage in\r\nman. The paralytic affection, however, is more frequent in the advanced\r\nstage; and in those persons who recover, an incomplete paralysis of one\r\nor more of the extremities, resembling lead palsy, is often the last\r\nsymptom which continues.\r\n\r\nDehaen relates a distinct example of this disorder occurring in a female\r\nwho took a small quantity of arsenic by mistake. The ordinary signs of\r\ninflammation were soon subdued, and for three days she did well; but on\r\nthe fourth she was attacked with cramps, tenderness, and weakness of the\r\nfeet, legs and arms, increasing gradually till the whole extremities\r\nbecame at length almost completely palsied. At the same time the cuticle\r\ndesquamated. But the other functions continued entire. The power of\r\nmotion returned first in the hands, then in the arms, and she eventually\r\nrecovered; but eleven months passed before she could quit the hospital\r\nwhere Dehaen treated her.[663]\r\n\r\nAn excellent account of a set of similar cases has been given by Dr.\r\nMurray of Aberdeen. They became the subject of judicial inquiry on the\r\ntrial of George Thom, who was condemned in 1821 at the Aberdeen autumn\r\ncircuit for poisoning his brother-in-law. Four persons were\r\nsimultaneously affected about an hour after breakfast with the primary\r\nsymptoms of poisoning with arsenic, and some in a very violent degree.\r\nBut besides these symptoms, in all of them the muscular debility was\r\ngreat; and in two it amounted to true partial palsy. One of them lost\r\naltogether the power of the left arm, and six months after, when the\r\naccount of the cases was published, he was unable to bend the arm at the\r\nelbow-joint. The other had also great general debility and\r\nlong-continued numbness and pains of the legs.[664]\r\n\r\nAn interesting case of the same nature with these was lately submitted\r\nto me on the part of the crown. A man after taking arsenic was attacked\r\nwith vomiting, purging, and other symptoms of abdominal irritation,\r\nwhich were mistaken for dysentery. Five days afterwards he began to\r\nsuffer also from feebleness of the limbs; amounting almost to palsy.\r\nSubsequently an improvement slowly took place; but he continued to\r\nsuffer under irritative fever, diarrhœa, and faintness. Several weeks\r\nlater the diarrhœa abated, but he had great stiffness, numbness, and\r\nloss of power in the joints of the hands and feet. Two months after he\r\nfirst took ill, and while he was slowly recovering from this paralytic\r\naffection, arsenic was again administered and proved fatal in eighteen\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nAnother, somewhat similar to the preceding, has been related by M.\r\nLachèse of Angers. Two people took about half a grain in soup twice a\r\nday for two days, and were attacked with the usual primary symptoms. One\r\nof them died in ten weeks, gradually worn out, but without any\r\nparticular nervous affection. The other was seized with convulsions, and\r\nafterwards with almost complete palsy of the limbs.[665]—A well-marked\r\ncase of the same nature has been noticed by Professor Bernt. It was the\r\ncase formerly alluded to as arising from an over-dose of the arseniate\r\nof potass. The paralytic affection consisted in the loss of sensation\r\nand of the power of motion in the hands, and of the loss of motion in\r\nthe feet, with contraction of the knee-joints. The issue of the case is\r\nnot mentioned.[666]—Dr. Falconer observes in his essay on Palsy, that he\r\nhad repeatedly witnessed local palsy after poisoning with arsenic, and\r\nalludes to one instance in which the hands only were paralysed, and to\r\ntwo others in which the palsy spread gradually from the fingers upwards\r\ntill the whole arms were affected.[667]—On the whole, then, local palsy\r\nis the most frequent of the secondary effects of arsenic.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes very obstinate, as the cases related by Dehaen and\r\nMurray will show. But it even appears to be sometimes incurable. For in\r\nthe German Ephemerides there is related the case of a cook, who after\r\nsuffering from the usual inflammatory symptoms, was attacked with\r\nperfect palsy of the limbs, and had not any use of them during the rest\r\nof her life, which was not a short one.[668]\r\n\r\nOccasionally, instead of being palsied, the limbs are rigidly bent and\r\ncannot be extended.[669] They were contracted, as well as palsied in the\r\ncase noticed by Bernt.\r\n\r\nThe last nervous affection to be mentioned is mania. The only instance I\r\nhave hitherto found of that disease arising from arsenic is related by\r\nAmatus Lusitanus. He has not recorded the particulars of the case, but\r\nmerely observes that the individual became so outrageously mad as to\r\nburst his fetters and jump out of the window of his apartment.[670]\r\nAccording to Zacchias, Amatus was not very scrupulous in his adherence\r\nto fact in recording cases.\r\n\r\nThe preceding remarks contain all that is known with certainty of the\r\neffect of arsenic on man when it is swallowed. Independently of the\r\nobvious nervous disorders which succeed the acute symptoms, other morbid\r\naffections of a more obscure character and chronic in their nature have\r\nbeen sometimes observed or supposed to arise from this poison.—Among\r\nthese the most unequivocal is dyspepsia. Irritability of the stomach,\r\nattended with constant vomiting of food, has been occasionally noticed\r\nfor a long time after. Wepfer has described two cases in which the\r\nprimary symptoms were followed, in one by dyspepsia of three years’\r\nstanding, in the other by emaciation and an anomalous fever, which ended\r\nfatally in three years.[671]—Hahnemann farther adds, that in the\r\nadvanced stage the hair sometimes drops out, and the cuticle\r\ndesquamates, accompanied occasionally with great tenderness of the\r\nskin;[672] and Wibmer mentions a case of the kind, where not the cuticle\r\nand hair only, but likewise even the nails, fell off.[673] Desquamation\r\nof the cuticle and dropping of the nails are at times produced by the\r\ncontinued use of arsenic in medicinal doses.—Other effects have likewise\r\nbeen ascribed to its employment medicinally. Thus passing over what was\r\nstated by its opponents at the time when its introduction into the\r\nmateria medica was made the subject of controversy over Europe,\r\nBroussais maintained that it causes chronic inflammation of the stomach\r\nor intestines;[674] and Dr. Astbury inferred, from an instance which\r\nfell under his notice, that it may bring on dropsy.[675] Neither of\r\nthese ideas is supported by the general experience of the profession;\r\nand although some persons even of late have alleged that those, who take\r\nit medicinally to any material amount, invariably die soon after of some\r\nchronic disease,[676] there cannot be a doubt, that, under proper\r\nrestriction, it is both an effectual and a safe remedy.—A case where\r\nsalivation, with fetor and superficial ulceration of the gums, seemed to\r\nhave been produced by arsenic, was lately published in an English\r\nJournal.[677]\r\n\r\nIn the present place may also be considered the supposed effects of the\r\ncelebrated _Aqua Toffana_ or _Acquetta di Napoli_, a slow poison, which\r\nin the sixteenth century, was believed to possess the property of\r\ncausing death at any determinate period, after months for example, or\r\neven years, of ill health, according to the will of the poisoner.\r\n\r\nThe most authentic description of the aqua Toffana ascribes its\r\nproperties to arsenic. According to a letter addressed to Hoffman by\r\nGarelli, physician to Charles the Sixth of Austria, that Emperor told\r\nGarelli, that, being governor of Naples at the time the aqua Toffana was\r\nthe dread of every noble family in the city, and when the subject was\r\ninvestigated legally, he had an opportunity of examining all the\r\ndocuments,—and that he found the poison was a solution of arsenic in\r\n_aqua cymbalariæ_.[678] The dose was said to be from four to six drops.\r\nIt was colourless, transparent, and tasteless, like water.\r\n\r\nIts alleged effects are thus eloquently described by Behrends, a writer\r\nin Uden and Pyl’s Magazin. “A certain indescribable change is felt in\r\nthe whole body, which leads the person to complain to his physician. The\r\nphysician examines and reflects, but finds no symptom, either external\r\nor internal,—no constipation, no vomiting, no inflammation, no fever. In\r\nshort, he can advise only patience, strict regimen, and laxatives. The\r\nmalady, however, creeps on; and the physician is again sent for. Still\r\nhe cannot detect any symptom of note. He infers that there is some\r\nstagnation or corruption of the humours, and again advises laxatives.\r\nMeanwhile the poison takes firmer hold of the system; languor,\r\nwearisomeness and loathing of food continue; the nobler organs gradually\r\nbecome torpid, and the lungs in particular at length begin to suffer. In\r\na word, the malady is from the first incurable; the unhappy victim pines\r\naway insensibly, even in the hands of his physician; and thus is he\r\nbrought to a miserable end through months or years, according to his\r\nenemy’s desire.”[679] An equally vigorous and somewhat clearer account\r\nof the symptoms is given by Hahnemann. “They are,” says he, “a gradual\r\nsinking of the powers of life, without any violent symptom,—a nameless\r\nfeeling of illness, failure of the strength, slight feverishness, want\r\nof sleep, lividity of the countenance, and an aversion to food and drink\r\nand all the other enjoyments of life. Dropsy closes the scene, along\r\nwith black miliary eruptions, and convulsions, or colliquative\r\nperspiration and purging.”[680]\r\n\r\nWhatever were its real effects, there appears no doubt it was long used\r\nsecretly in Italy to a fearful extent, the monster who has given her\r\nname to it having confessed that she was instrumental in the death of no\r\nless than six hundred persons. It has been already stated, however [p.\r\n40], that she owed her success rather to the ignorance of the age than\r\nto her own dexterity. At all events, the art of secret poisoning cannot\r\nnow be easily practised. Indeed even the vulgar dread of it is almost\r\nextinct. Partly on account of the improvement in general knowledge and\r\nchiefly in consequence of the subtility and precision, which the\r\nrefinement of modern physic and chemistry have introduced into\r\nmedico-legal inquiries, it is rare that the suspicious scrutiny of the\r\nworld now “recognizes in the accounts of the last illness of popes and\r\nprinces the effects of poison insidiously introduced into the\r\nbody.”[681]\r\n\r\nI may add in conclusion, that I was consulted a few years ago on the\r\npart of the crown in a case which considerably resembled the effects\r\nascribed in former times to the aqua Toffana, except that it was more\r\nacute in its character and swifter in its progress. As this case will\r\nprobably be found to represent pretty nearly the usual effects of\r\nmoderate doses frequently repeated, it is here given in some detail.\r\n\r\nA woman of indifferent character married a young man in circumstances\r\nwhich led to a breach between him and his relatives; but the pair\r\nappeared to live on good terms with one another. Eighteen months after\r\nthe marriage she was attacked with sickness and faintness; and on the\r\nfourth day of this illness, while she was recovering, the symptoms\r\nunexpectedly increased, and she seemed very unwell. On the fifth day she\r\nbecame extremely weak, and suffered much from yellow vomiting. On the\r\nseventh, when she was first visited by a medical man, she had frequent\r\nvomiting, burning in the stomach, a yellow tongue, flushed countenance,\r\nhot skin, and hurried pulse. On the ninth the throat was sore and red,\r\nand the expression anxious; and next day the soreness was greater,\r\naffected the nose and mouth also, and was attended with excoriation of\r\nthe lips and nostrils, swelling of the glands of the throat, dimness of\r\nsight, and great exhaustion. On the eleventh day, while previously again\r\ngetting better, she became much worse, and suffered greatly from\r\nexcessive vomiting, pain in the stomach, and an increase of the other\r\nsymptoms. On the thirteenth she was very hoarse, and despaired of\r\nrecovery. Next day she was occasionally incoherent, and had twitches of\r\nthe facial muscles; the hands and face were swelled, the eyelids dingy,\r\nthe conjunctivæ injected, and the nails blue. On the morning of the\r\nfifteenth there was for two hours violent delirium and fierce maniacal\r\nexcitement, which were succeeded by coma, and this by death in the\r\ncourse of the evening. There was no diarrhœa, or urinary complaint, and\r\nno paralysis or eruption on the skin. A variety of circumstances of a\r\ngeneral nature, which it would be out of place to enumerate here,—the\r\ndetection of arsenic in various articles of which the woman had\r\npartaken, and in which the arsenic had been dissolved sometimes simply,\r\nsometimes with the aid of an alkali,—together with the fact, that the\r\nbody five months after death was found preserved from decay, as it is\r\nnow well known to be in most cases of arsenical poisoning,—left little\r\ndoubt that the woman died of the effects of arsenic taken in several\r\nsmall doses at distant intervals, although none could be detected in the\r\nstomach or intestines. The case did not go to trial, owing to the death\r\nof an essential witness.\r\n\r\nThe effects of arsenic on man, when introduced into the living body\r\nthrough other channels besides the stomach, will now require some\r\nobservations. It is necessary for the medical jurist to be well\r\nacquainted with them, because there is hardly an accessible part of the\r\nhuman body to which this poison has not been applied either accidentally\r\nor by design. When some account was given of its comparative action on\r\nthe different tissues of animals, it was observed that arsenic acts when\r\napplied to a wound or ulcer, to the peritonæal membrane, to the eye, and\r\nto the vagina. On man it has been known to act through an ulcer or\r\nwound, the inner membrane of the rectum, the membrane of the vagina, the\r\nmembrane of the air-tubes, the membrane of the nose, and even the sound\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nMany persons have been poisoned by the application of arsenic to\r\nsurfaces deprived of the cuticle, such as blistered surfaces, eruptions,\r\nulcers, or wounds. When applied in this manner it commonly induces both\r\nlocal inflammation and constitutional symptoms. Amatus Lusitanus relates\r\nthe case of a young man, who, against the advice of his physician,\r\nanointed an itchy eruption of the skin with an arsenical ointment, and\r\nnext day was found dead in bed.[682] A similar case, not so rapidly\r\nfatal, has been recorded by Wepfer. A girl, affected with psoriasis of\r\nthe scalp, had it rubbed with a liniment of butter and arsenic. In a\r\nshort time she was seized with acute pain and swelling of the whole\r\nhead, fainting-fits, restlessness, fever, delirium, and she died in six\r\ndays.[683] Zitmann has noticed the cases of two children, eight and ten\r\nyears of age, who were killed by the application of an arsenical\r\nsolution to a similar eruption of the head.[684] And Belloc relates the\r\ncase of a woman who, trying to cure an inveterate itch with an arsenical\r\nlotion, was attacked in consequence with severe erysipelas of the whole\r\nbody, succeeded by tremors and gradual exhaustion of the vital powers,\r\nending fatally in two years.[685] M. Errard of Injurieux in France\r\nlately met with two cases, where, in consequence of a freshly blistered\r\nsurface being dressed with a cerate made with the stearine of\r\narsenicated candles (see p. 256), local pain, nausea, pain in the\r\nstomach, urgent thirst, redness of the tongue, involuntary contractions\r\nof the muscles of the extremities, and weakness and irregularity of the\r\npulse came on; and one person died within twenty-four hours, while the\r\nother recovered, chiefly because the dressing caused so much pain that\r\nthe patient could not keep it on long.[686]\r\n\r\nNext as to ulcers; M. Roux has noticed the case of a girl, who was\r\nkilled by the application of the arsenical paste to an ulcer of the\r\nbreast, and in whom the constitutional symptoms were strongly marked,\r\nalthough the quantity of the poison must have been very small. The\r\npreparation used, which contains only a twenty-fourth of its weight of\r\narsenic, was applied for a single night on a surface not exceeding an\r\ninch and a half in diameter. Yet she complained next day of violent\r\ncolic and vomited frequently, the countenance soon became collapsed, and\r\nshe died two days afterwards in great anguish.[687] Another instance of\r\nthe like kind is related in the Annales d’Hygiène, where death arose\r\nfrom an arsenical ointment ignorantly applied for scirrhous breast over\r\na large surface of the skin stripped of the cuticle by a blister. The\r\nparticular symptoms and their duration are not stated; but there was\r\nviolent irritation of the stomach.[688] Another fatal case, related by\r\nDr. Küchler, arose from the application of Frêre Cosme’s powder to a\r\nsoft fungoid tumour on the temple, which discharged serum usually and\r\nblood upon slight pressure. About a drachm and a half of arsenic mixed\r\nwith fifteen grains of other powders was applied. Severe inflammation\r\nspread round the tumour next day; and soon afterwards, the patient was\r\nattacked with great difficulty of breathing, thirst, pains in the belly,\r\nand purging, then with difficulty in swallowing from swelling of the\r\nbase of the tongue, delirium, cold sweating, and extreme debility; and\r\ndeath ensued in four days.[689]\r\n\r\nThere is a singular uncertainty in the effects of arsenic when applied\r\nto ulcerated surfaces. Some persons, like Roux’s patient, are obviously\r\naffected by a single application; while others have had it applied for a\r\nlong time without experiencing any other consequences than the formation\r\nof an eschar at the part. Two causes have been assigned for these\r\ndifferences, and probably both are founded on fact. One, which has been\r\nassigned by Mr. Blackadder, is the relative quantity of arsenic applied.\r\nHe says he never witnessed but one instance of its acting\r\nconstitutionally, although he often applied it to sores; and he imputes\r\nthis success to his having always used a large quantity. For he\r\nconsiders that by so doing the organization of the part is quickly\r\ndestroyed, and absorption prevented,—but that if the quantity be small,\r\nas in the mode practised by Roux, it will cause little local injury and\r\nreadily enter the absorbing vessels.[690] Another unequivocal cause is\r\npointed out by Harles in his treatise on arsenic. While treating of its\r\ntherapeutic properties, and noticing the controversy that prevailed last\r\ncentury throughout Europe respecting the propriety of its outward\r\napplication, he remarks that it may be applied with safety to the\r\nabraded skin, to common ulcers, to wounded surfaces, and to malignant\r\nglandular ulcers, even when highly irritable, provided the part be not\r\nrecently wounded, so as to pour out blood.[691] The reason of this is\r\nobvious; the application of the poison to open-mouthed vessels is the\r\nnext thing to its direct introduction into a vein. It is some\r\nconfirmation of Harles’s opinion, that Roux, whose patient was so easily\r\naffected, recommends that before arsenic is applied to an ulcer, a fresh\r\nsurface be made by paring away the granulations; and that Küchler’s\r\npatient had an ulcer which did not discharge pus, but serum, and was\r\neasily made to bleed.\r\n\r\nIn the cases related above it will be remarked that the symptoms vary in\r\ntheir nature. Sometimes the chief disorder is inflammation, spreading\r\nover and around the eruption or ulcer, sometimes inflammation of the\r\nalimentary canal, sometimes an affection of the nervous system. In\r\ngeneral the sufferings of the patient both from the local inflammation\r\nand constitutional symptoms are very severe. But this rule has its\r\nexceptions. In Pyl’s Memoirs there is the history of a child who died\r\nfour days after an itchy eruption of the whole body had been washed with\r\nan arsenical solution, and signs of vivid inflammation were found after\r\ndeath in many parts; yet she appears to have complained only of\r\nheadache.[692] Occasionally too, without exciting either inflammation of\r\nthe part, or disorder of the stomach, or a general injury of the nervous\r\nsystem, it seems to give rise to partial palsy of the muscles adjoining\r\nthe seat of its application. An extraordinary case is noticed in an\r\nAmerican Journal, in which the prolonged use of an arsenical preparation\r\nfor destroying a tumour on the right side of the neck, was followed by\r\ncomplete palsy of the muscles of the neck and arm of that side.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, poisoning has been perpetrated by introducing arsenic\r\ninto the fundament with an injection.[693] Foderé has noticed a case of\r\nthis kind, which happened in France, and was communicated to him by a\r\nphysician of Thoulouse. A lady under medical treatment for some trifling\r\nillness, died unexpectedly under symptoms of poisoning; and it was\r\ndiscovered that her servant, after unsuccessfully attempting to despatch\r\nher by dissolving arsenic in her soup, had ultimately succeeded by\r\nadministering it repeatedly in injections.[694] There is no doubt that\r\nby this mode all the usual effects of arsenic may be induced; and on\r\naccount of the facility with which the colon and rectum may be\r\nevacuated, it is not likely that the poison will be found in the gut\r\nafter death, if the individual did not die in a few hours after its\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, women have also died of poisoning by arsenic\r\nintroduced into the vagina. Two examples of this revolting crime are on\r\nrecord. One of them occurred in 1799, in the Department of the Ourthe in\r\nFrance. A middle-aged female was seized with vomiting, diarrhœa,\r\nswelling of the genitals and uterine discharge; and she expired not long\r\nafter. Before her death she told two of her neighbours, that her husband\r\nhad some time before tried to poison her by putting arsenic in her\r\ncoffee, and had at length succeeded by introducing a powder into her\r\nvagina while in the act of enjoying his nuptial rights. The vulva and\r\nvagina were gangrenous, the belly distended with gases, and the\r\nintestines inflamed.[695]\r\n\r\nThe other case, which happened in Finland in 1786, gave rise to an\r\nexcellent dissertation on the subject by Dr. Mangor, at that time\r\nmedical inspector for Copenhagen. A farmer near Copenhagen lost his wife\r\nsuddenly under suspicious circumstances, and six weeks afterwards\r\nmarried his maid-servant. In a few years he transferred his affections\r\nto another maid-servant, with whose aid he endeavoured to poison his\r\nsecond wife. For some time his attempts proved abortive; till at last\r\none morning, after coïtion, he introduced a mixture of arsenic and flour\r\non the point of his finger into the vagina. She took ill at mid-day and\r\nexpired next morning; and the murderer soon after married his guilty\r\nparamour. But a few years had not elapsed before he got tired of her\r\nalso; and one morning, after the conjugal embrace, he administered\r\narsenic to her in the same way as to her predecessor. About three in the\r\nafternoon, while enjoying good health, she was suddenly seized with\r\nshivering and heat in the vagina. The remembrance of her former\r\nwickedness soon awoke the suspicions of the unhappy woman, and she wrung\r\nfrom her husband a confession of his crime. Means were resorted to for\r\nsaving her life, but in vain: She was attacked with acute pain in her\r\nstomach and incessant vomiting, then became delirious, and died in\r\ntwenty-one hours. After death grains of arsenic were found in the\r\nvagina, although frequent lotions had been used in the treatment. The\r\nlabia were swollen and red, the vagina gaping and flaccid, the os uteri\r\ngangrenous, the duodenum inflamed, the stomach natural. In the course of\r\nthe judicial proceedings which arose out of these two cases, Dr. Mangor\r\nmade experiments on mares, with the view of settling the doubts which\r\nwere entertained as to the likelihood of arsenic proving fatal in the\r\nmanner alleged; and the results clearly showed that, when applied to the\r\nvagina of these animals, it produces violent local inflammation and\r\nfatal constitutional derangement.[696]\r\n\r\nIn the fourth place, poisoning by arsenic through the bronchial membrane\r\nor membrane of the air-passages is a comparatively rare accident, which\r\ncan take place only in consequence of arsenical gases or vapours being\r\nincautiously breathed. The effects of oxide of arsenic when introduced\r\nin this way are described from personal experience by Otto Tachenius, a\r\nchemist of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n“Once,” said he, “when I happened to breathe incautiously the fumes of\r\narsenic, I was surprised to find my palate impressed with a sweet, mild,\r\ngrateful taste, such as I never experienced before. But in half an hour\r\nI was attacked with pain and tightness in the stomach, then with general\r\nconvulsions, difficult breathing, an unspeakable sense of heat, bloody\r\nand painful micturition, and finally with such an acute colic as\r\ncontracted my whole body for half an hour.” By the use of oleaginous\r\ndrinks he recovered from these alarming symptoms; but during all the\r\nsucceeding winter he had a low hectic fever.[697]\r\n\r\nBalthazar Timæus relates a similar case which came under his notice. An\r\napothecary of Colberg, while subliming arsenic, had not been careful\r\nenough to avoid the fumes; and was soon after seized with frequent\r\nfainting, tightness in the præcordia, difficult breathing,\r\ninextinguishable thirst, parched throat, great restlessness, watching,\r\nand pains in the feet. He had afterwards profuse daily perspiration and\r\npalsy of the legs; and several months elapsed before he got entirely\r\nwell.[698] The same author says that the famous Paracelsus, being one\r\nday put out of temper by an acquaintance, made him hold his nose over an\r\nalembic in which arsenic was subliming; and that the object of this\r\nsevere joke nearly lost his life in consequence. Wibmer quotes the heads\r\nof several cases where swelling of the tongue, headache and giddiness,\r\nnausea, and an oppressive sense of constriction in the throat, were\r\noccasioned by the incautious inhalation of arsenical fumes.[699] The\r\nfollowing extraordinary case, closely allied to malignant cholera in its\r\nearly stage, has been ascribed by the reporter Dr. Welper of Berlin to\r\nthe inspiration of arsenical fumes,—with what probability I am not\r\nprepared to say. A stout healthy man, who in the forenoon had freely and\r\nfor some time exposed himself to the steam from a vessel where he was\r\nboiling several ounces of orpiment in water, was attacked at night with\r\nsickness, and next morning with extreme weakness and some difficulty of\r\nbreathing. These symptoms were greatly relieved by an emetic. But\r\ntowards evening the extremities became ice-cold and very stiff, the\r\nbreathing much oppressed, the pulse very hurried, and imperceptible\r\nexcept in the neck, the mouth and throat dry, and the tongue rigid; but\r\nthe mind remained clear, though anxious and afraid of impending\r\ndissolution. His state of collapse was removed in twelve hours by\r\nfomentations, and in no long time he recovered entirely except from the\r\ndyspnœa, which continued more or less till a few years afterwards, when\r\nhe died of hydrothorax.[700]\r\n\r\nThe slighter effects of arsenic are said to have been repeatedly\r\nobserved of late in this country from inhaling the products of the\r\ncombustion of arsenicated candles,—an article of recent invention, in\r\nwhich arsenic, to the extent of three or four grains and a half in each\r\ncandle, is introduced for the purpose of hardening the stearine chiefly\r\nused in manufacturing them. It is unnecessary to say, that such candles\r\nare prejudicial and ought to be prohibited. In a set of experiments made\r\nto try their effects by Messrs. Everitt, Bird, and Phillips in 1838,\r\nbirds were killed in no long time, and small quadrupeds were severely\r\naffected, when kept in an apartment lighted with them.[701]\r\n\r\nAnalogous to the effects of inhaling oxide of arsenic are those lately\r\nobserved from the incautious inhalation of arseniuretted-hydrogen gas.\r\nGehlen the chemist died of this accident, but no particular account has\r\nbeen published of the symptoms he suffered. Two cases, however, have\r\nbeen detailed within a few years. In one of these, which has been\r\nrelated by Dr. Schlinder, of Greifenberg, the individual inhaled in\r\nforty minutes about half a cubic inch of the gas, which is equivalent to\r\nabout an eighth of a grain of arsenic. In three hours he became affected\r\nwith giddiness, and soon afterwards with an uneasy sense of pressure in\r\nthe region of the kidney, passing gradually into acute pain there and\r\nupwards along the back. General shivering ensued, with coldness of the\r\nextremities, and gouty-like pains in the knees, shoulders, and elbows.\r\nThe hands and lower half of the fore-arms, the feet and legs nearly to\r\nthe knees, the nose and region of the eyebrows, felt as if quite dead,\r\nbut without any diminution of muscular power. There was also acute pain\r\nin the stomach and belly generally, painful eructation of gas, and\r\noccasional vomiting of bitter, greenish-yellow mucus. The most\r\ntormenting symptom, however, was the pain in the kidneys, which soon\r\nbecame attended with constant desire to pass water, and the discharge of\r\ndeep reddish-brown urine, mixed with clots of blood. The whole\r\nexpression of the countenance was altered, the skin becoming dark brown,\r\nand the eyeballs sunk, yellow, and surrounded by a broad livid ring.\r\nWarm drink brought out a copious sweat and removed the sense of\r\nnumbness; but next day there was little change otherwise in the\r\nsymptoms, except that the urine was no longer mixed with clots, and that\r\nthe hair on the benumbed parts had become white. On the third day the\r\npains had abated, and the urine became clear; but there was hiccup, an\r\nexcited state of the mind, and a feeling as if a great stone lay in the\r\nlower belly. In seven days he was much better. In the third week the\r\nwhole glans and prepuce became covered with little pustules which were\r\nfollowed by small ulcers. It was not till the close of the seventh week\r\nthat he recovered completely.[702] Dr. O’Reilly has related the\r\nfollowing case, which arose from the inhalation of hydrogen gas\r\nimpregnated with arseniuretted-hydrogen in consequence of the sulphuric\r\nacid used for dissolving zinc having contained arsenic. Mr. Brittan, a\r\nDublin chemist, wishing to ascertain the effects of hydrogen on the\r\nbody, proceeded to inhale 150 cubic inches of it. Immediately after the\r\nsecond inhalation, he was seized with confusion, faintness, giddiness\r\nand shivering, and passed a stool, as well as two ounces of bloody\r\nurine, but without any pain. Pain in the limbs followed, and in two\r\nhours frequent vomiting and dull pain in the stomach. The pulse at this\r\ntime was 90, the skin cold, and the voice feeble. Ammonia, laudanum, and\r\nemollient clysters gave him little relief. During the subsequent night\r\nthere was frequent vomiting and no urine; the face became\r\ncopper-coloured, and the rest of the body greenish; there was tenderness\r\nof the epigastrium and hiccup; but he was free of fever. On the third\r\nday there was diarrhœa and still no urine; but the jaundice had\r\ndisappeared. On the fourth the breath was ammoniacal, and somnolency had\r\nset in. On the fifth the skin became again deeply jaundiced, and the\r\nface was œdematous; no urine had yet been discharged, and the bladder,\r\nexamined with the catheter, was found empty. On the evening of the\r\nseventh day he expired. On examination of the body, two pints of red\r\nserum were found in the pleural cavities; the lungs were sound, the\r\nheart pale and flaccid, the liver indigo-blue, the gall-bladder\r\ndistended with bile, the kidneys also indigo-blue, the stomach empty,\r\nand its villous coat brittle, with here and there inflamed-like spots on\r\nit, the bladder empty, the brain bloodless, the cellular tissue\r\ngenerally anasarcous. Arsenic was detected in the pleural serum. By an\r\napproximate calculation it was supposed that the hydrogen this gentleman\r\ninhaled had contained the equivalent arsenic of twelve grains of the\r\noxide.[703]\r\n\r\nIt would appear that arsenic acts with great rapidity and force when\r\nrespired in any form.\r\n\r\nPoisoning through the lining membrane of the nostrils is a still rarer\r\naccident than that last mentioned. There is a distinct example of it in\r\nthe German Ephemerides, which arose from an arsenical solution having\r\nbeen used by mistake as a lotion for a chronic discharge from the\r\nnostrils. The individual was attacked with a profuse discharge from the\r\nnostrils, and then with stupor approaching to coma. Weakness of sight\r\nand of memory continued after sensibility returned; and he died two\r\nyears afterwards, death having been preceded for some time by\r\nconvulsions.[704]\r\n\r\nArsenic when applied to the sound skin of animals does not easily affect\r\nthem. The experiments of Jaeger formerly noticed prove that no effect is\r\nproduced, if the poison is simply placed in contact with the skin. Nay\r\neven when rubbed into it with fatty matters it does not operate with\r\nenergy; for in that case, according to the experiments of Renault, it\r\ncauses sometimes a pustular eruption, sometimes an eschar, but never any\r\nconstitutional disorder.[705] It is more energetic, however, when\r\napplied to the more delicate skin of the human subject. Some experiments\r\nwere made by Mr. Sherwen on himself with the view of proving this;[706]\r\nbut they are not satisfactory. The following facts, however, will show\r\nthat it may produce through the sound skin all the ordinary signs of\r\npoisoning. Desgranges, a good authority, relates the case of a woman who\r\nanointed her head with an arsenical ointment to kill lice, and, after\r\nusing it several days, was attacked with erysipelas of the head and\r\nface, attended with ulceration of the scalp, swelling of the salivary\r\nand cervical glands, and inflammation of the eyes. There were likewise\r\nviolent constitutional symptoms,—much fever, fainting, giddiness,\r\nvomiting and pain in the stomach, tenesmus, and ardor urinæ, tremors of\r\nthe limbs, and even occasional delirium. Afterwards the whole body\r\nbecame covered with an eruption of white papulæ, which dried and dropt\r\noff in forty-eight hours. She recovered gradually; but appears to have\r\nmade a narrow escape. Her hair fell out during convalescence.[707] A\r\nsimilar instance is recorded in the Acta Germanica for 1730. A schoolboy\r\nhaving found in the street a parcel of arsenic, his mother mistook it\r\nfor hair powder; and as he had to deliver a valedictory speech at school\r\nnext day, she advised him to powder himself well with it in the morning.\r\nThis he accordingly did. In the middle of his speech he was attacked\r\nwith acute pain of the face; and a fertile crop of pustules soon broke\r\nout upon it. The head afterwards swelled much, and the pustules spread\r\nall around it; he was tormented with intolerable heat in the scalp; and\r\nthe hair became matted with the discharge into a thick scabby crust.\r\nThis crust separated in a few weeks, and he soon recovered\r\ncompletely.[708] Schulze, a German physician, has related no fewer than\r\nfive cases of the same description, all arising from arsenic having been\r\nmistaken for hair powder; and one of them proved fatal. Two of the cases\r\nwere slight. The other persons had the same violent inflammation of the\r\nhead as Desgranges’s patient and the German schoolboy. In the fatal case\r\ndeath took place in twenty-one days; and on dissection, besides other\r\nmorbid appearances, the scalp was found gangrenous and infiltered with\r\nfluid blood, and the stomach much inflamed.[709] The two survivors, who\r\nwere severely ill, it is well to add, were not attacked with the\r\nerysipelas of the scalp till six days after they powdered themselves.\r\nSproegel mentions a fatal case from fly-powder having been applied in\r\nlike manner to the head; and Wibmer quotes another, but not fatal, where\r\nfrom the same cause great swelling of the head and face arose, followed\r\nby erysipelas of the face, neck, and belly, and a papular eruption on\r\nthe hands which continued five days.[710]\r\n\r\nFrom the statements now made, it is evident that arsenic applied to\r\nvarious parts of the external surface and natural apertures of the body,\r\nwill prove poisonous, and will often act with a certainty and rapidity\r\nnot surpassed by its effects when taken internally. Many of the cases\r\nfurnish a striking confirmation of a circumstance formerly noticed with\r\nrespect to its action,—namely, that it produces signs of irritation in\r\nthe stomach, in whatever manner it is introduced into the body. In some\r\ninstances, indeed, the signs of inflammation in the stomach were quite\r\nas distinct as in the cases previously described, where the poison was\r\ntaken internally.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the symptoms caused by arsenic will now be concluded with\r\na few remarks on the strength of the evidence which they supply.\r\n\r\nThe present doctrine of toxicologists and medical jurists seems\r\ngenerally to be, that symptoms alone can never supply decisive proof of\r\nthe administration of arsenic. This opinion is certainly quite correct\r\nwhen applied to what may be called a common case of poisoning with\r\narsenic, the symptoms of which are little else than burning pain in the\r\nstomach and bowels, vomiting and purging, feeble circulation, excessive\r\ndebility, and speedy death. All these symptoms may be caused by natural\r\ndisease, more particularly by cholera; and consequently every sound\r\nmedical jurist will join in condemning unreservedly the practice which\r\nprevailed last century of deciding questions of poisoning in such\r\ncircumstances from symptoms alone. But modern authors appear to have\r\noverstepped the mark, when they hold that the rule against deciding from\r\nsymptoms does not admit of any exceptions. For there are cases of\r\npoisoning with arsenic, not numerous certainly, yet not very uncommon\r\nneither, which can hardly be confounded with natural disease; and, what\r\nis of some consequence, they are precisely those in which the power of\r\ndeciding from symptoms alone is most required, because chemical evidence\r\nis almost always wanting. Either the peculiar combination of the\r\nsymptoms is such as cannot arise from natural causes, so far at least as\r\nphysicians are acquainted with them: or these symptoms occur under\r\ncollateral circumstances, which put natural causes almost or altogether\r\nout of the question.\r\n\r\nThus, let the medical jurist consider in the first place, the symptoms\r\noccasionally observed in those who survive five, six or ten days; let\r\nhim exclude for the present the secondary nervous affections; and\r\ninstead of a compounded description, which may be objected to as apt to\r\nconvey a false and exaggerated idea of the facts, let him take an actual\r\nexample. In a paper by Dr. Bachmann on some cases of poisoning with\r\narsenic, there is a minute account of the case of a lady who was\r\npoisoned by her maid with fly-powder and white arsenic, and whose\r\nsymptoms were those of universal inflammation of the mucous membranes.\r\nAfter suffering two days from retching and vomiting, colic pains and\r\npurging, these symptoms suddenly became more violent, and attended with\r\noppressed breathing and hoarseness so that she could hardly make herself\r\nbe heard,—with vesicles on the palate, burning pain in the throat, and\r\nexcessive difficulty in swallowing,—with spasm and pain of the bladder\r\nin passing water,—and with extreme feebleness of the pulse. Three days\r\nafterwards the symptoms increased still more. She complained of\r\nintolerable burning and spasms of the throat, which, as well as the\r\nmouth, was excessively inflamed,—of violent burning pain in the stomach\r\nand bowels,—of burning in the fundament and genitals, both of which were\r\ninflamed even to gangrene,—of indescribable anxiety and anguish about\r\nthe heart; and she died the following day, death being preceded by\r\nsubsultus, delirium, and insensibility.[711] Or take the case in the\r\ntrial of Miss Blandy. On two successive evenings, immediately after\r\ntaking some gruel which had been prepared by the prisoner, Mr. Blandy\r\nwas attacked with pricking and burning of the tongue, throat, stomach,\r\nand bowels, and with vomiting and purging. Five days after, when the\r\nsymptoms were fully formed, he had inflamed pimples round the lips, and\r\na sense of burning in the mouth; the nostrils were similarly affected;\r\nthe eyes were bloodshot and affected with burning pain; the tongue was\r\nswollen, the throat red and excoriated, and in both there was a\r\ntormenting sense of burning; he had likewise swelling, with pricking and\r\nburning pain of the belly; excoriations and ulcers around the anus and\r\nintolerable burning there; vomiting and bloody diarrhœa; a low,\r\ntremulous pulse, laborious respiration, and great difficulty in speaking\r\nand swallowing. In this state he lingered several days, death\r\nsupervening nine days after the first suspected basin of gruel was\r\ntaken.[712] Can the symptoms, in these two cases, attacking, as they\r\ndid, at one and the same time, the whole mucous membranes, be imitated\r\nby any natural combination of symptoms? Viewing the endless variety and\r\nwonderful complexity of the phenomena of disease, the practitioner will\r\nprobably, and with justice, reply that a natural combination of the kind\r\nis possible. But if his attention is confined, as in strictures it ought\r\nto real occurrences,—if he is required to speak only from actual\r\nexperience, personal or derived, it is exceedingly questionable whether\r\nany one could say he had ever seen or read of such a case. At all\r\nevents, if a medical witness had to give his opinion from symptoms only\r\nin such a case as that of Mr. Blandy, or that described by Bachmann, he\r\nwould certainly be justified in declaring that poisoning was highly\r\nprobable; and, admitting general poisoning to be proved, he would, it is\r\nlikely, fix on arsenic as the substance which could most easily produce\r\nthe effects.\r\n\r\nLet him next, however, take also into consideration the nervous\r\naffections that sometimes either immediately follow the inflammation of\r\nthe mucous membranes, or become united with it when it has existed a few\r\ndays; and confining his attention still to actual occurrences, let him\r\nreflect on the symptoms in Dr. Roget’s case, in which there was first\r\nviolent inflammation of the whole alimentary canal, and then regular and\r\nobstinate epilepsy (p. 245), or on those in Dehaen’s patient, in whom\r\nthe nervous disorder was partial palsy (p. 247). On reconsidering these\r\nnarratives, still greater reason will appear for doubting whether such a\r\ncombination of simultaneous, and in the present instance also\r\nconsecutive symptoms, ever arise from natural causes. It is difficult to\r\nconceive a fortuitous concurrence of natural diseases producing at the\r\nsame moment that variety and complexity of disorder which occur in the\r\nprimary stage of the cases alluded to; and it would surely be a still\r\nmore extraordinary combination which should farther add the supervention\r\nof epilepsy or partial palsy from a natural cause, at the exact period\r\nat which it appears as the secondary stage of poisoning with arsenic.\r\nAll that any practitioner could say is, that a concurrence of the kind\r\nis within the bounds of possibility. He must be compelled to admit that\r\nit is in the highest degree improbable, and likewise that it could\r\nhardly take place from natural causes without the real causes of the\r\nsymptoms being clearly indicated.\r\n\r\nBut to conclude, there are likewise collateral circumstances connected\r\nwith the symptoms, which, taken along with the symptoms themselves, will\r\nsometimes place the fact of poisoning with arsenic beyond the reach of a\r\ndoubt. Thus, if a person were taken several times ill with symptoms of\r\ngeneral inflammation of the mucous membranes, after partaking each time\r\nof a suspected article of food or drink, the proof of the administration\r\nof arsenic would be very strong indeed; and it would be unimpeachable if\r\nat length a nervous affection succeeded at the usual period. Or above\r\nall, suppose several persons, who have partaken of the same dish, are\r\nseized about the same time with nearly the same symptoms of irritation\r\nof the mucous membranes. The proof of general poisoning would then be\r\nunequivocal. And if one or more of them should afterwards suffer from a\r\nnervous disorder, little hesitation ought to be felt in declaring that\r\narsenic is the only poison which could have caused their complaints.\r\n\r\nThese views are of more practical consequence than may at first sight be\r\nthought. The doctrine which has been here espoused might have been\r\napplied to decide two criminal cases which at the time made a great\r\nnoise in this country. One was the case of Eliza Fenning (p. 245). Here\r\nfive persons were simultaneously attacked with symptoms, more or less\r\nviolent, of inflammation of the whole alimentary canal; and in two of\r\nthem epileptic convulsions appeared before the inflammatory symptoms\r\ndeparted. The other was the case of George Thom (p. 247). Here four\r\npersons were at one and the same time seized with the primary symptoms\r\nin an aggravated form; and in two of them, as these symptoms abated,\r\nobstinate partial palsy came on. On both trials, then, it might have\r\nbeen stated from the symptoms alone that poison had been given, and that\r\narsenic was the only poison hitherto known to be capable of producing\r\nsuch effects.\r\n\r\nIn applying this doctrine to parallel instances two precautions must be\r\nattended to. On the one hand, care must be taken to ascertain, as may\r\nalways be done, that the simultaneous symptoms of general irritation in\r\nthe alimentary canal, arising soon after a meal, are not owing to\r\nunsound meat having been used in preparing it. And on the other hand,\r\nwhich is of more consequence, the symptoms on which so important an\r\nopinion is founded, must be strongly marked and well ascertained by a\r\ncompetent person. The signs of irritation in the mucous membranes must\r\nbe really general and unequivocal; and those of a disorder of the\r\nnervous system must be likewise developed characteristically. Care must\r\nbe taken in particular to distinguish symptoms of the latter class from\r\nothers which approach to them in nature, and are the ordinary sequels of\r\nnatural disease: for example, the true palsy caused by arsenic must not\r\nbe confounded with the numbness and racking pains in the limbs, which\r\noccasionally succeed cholera.\r\n\r\nWith these precautions the evidence from symptoms may in certain cases\r\nbe decisive of the question of poisoning with arsenic. And it is of\r\nmoment to observe, as has been already hinted, that, although such cases\r\nare numerous, they are precisely of the kind in which it is most\r\nessential to the ends of justice that the symptoms should, if possible,\r\nsupply evidence enough to direct the judgment; for the characteristic\r\nsymptoms referred to occur chiefly when the patient either recovers or\r\nsurvives many days, and where consequently the chemical evidence,\r\nusually procured from the examination of the contents of the stomach, is\r\nalmost always wanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n      SECTION III.—_Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Arsenic._\r\n\r\nThe morbid appearances caused by arsenic will next require some details.\r\nIn treating of them the same plan will be pursued as in the preceding\r\nsection: the various morbid appearances left by it will first be\r\nmentioned in their order; and the subject will then be wound up with\r\nsome remarks on the force of the evidence from these appearances, as\r\nthey are usually combined in actual cases.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, there are some cases in which little or no morbid\r\nappearance is to be seen at all. These all belong to the second variety\r\nof poisoning, which is characterized by the absence of local\r\ninflammation, and the presence of symptoms indicating an action on the\r\nheart, or some other remote organ. In such circumstances death takes\r\nplace before a sufficient interval has elapsed for inflammation to be\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nSeveral examples of the absence of diseased appearances in the dead body\r\nare to be found in authors. Thus in Chaussier’s case formerly quoted (p.\r\n243), in that related by Metzger (p. 242), in another related by\r\nEtmuller, which was fatal in twelve hours,[713] and in a fourth related\r\nby Professor Wagner of Berlin, where life was also prolonged for twelve\r\nhours under incessant vomiting,[714] there was positively no morbid\r\nalteration at all. Such was also the state of the whole alimentary canal\r\nin the extraordinary case related by Orfila (p. 243). In the case quoted\r\nfrom the Medical and Physical Journal (p. 242), there was merely a\r\nslight redness at the pyloric end of the stomach. In the case of the\r\nAmerican grocer too, there was only a little redness. In Mr. Wright’s\r\ncase (p. 243), there was scarcely any morbid appearance,—nothing more\r\nthan two small vascular spots and a minute ecchymosis. In that which\r\nfell under my own notice (p. 242), the villous coat of the stomach was\r\nof natural firmness, and had an exceedingly faint mottled-cherry-red\r\ntint, barely perceptible in a strong light; and the rest of the\r\nalimentary canal, as well as the body generally, was quite healthy.\r\n\r\nAlthough in these examples the morbid appearances were trifling or\r\nundistinguishable, it must not be supposed that the same happens in all\r\ncases of rapid death from arsenic. In Gérard’s case, where the usual\r\nirritant symptoms were wanting, and which proved fatal in five hours,\r\nthere was dark redness of the whole villous coat of the stomach. In Mr.\r\nHolland’s case, fatal in eight or nine hours (p. 243), the stomach was\r\nof an intense purple colour at its pyloric end, and contained bloody\r\nmucus; and the mucous coat of the cœcum presented extensive softening\r\nand congestion. Mr. Alfred Taylor refers to three cases observed by Mr.\r\nForster of Huntingdon, in which the mucous coat of the stomach was\r\nhighly inflamed, though death took place in 6½, 3½, and 2 hours\r\nonly:[715] in Mr. Hewson’s case, fatal in five hours, the whole stomach\r\nwas exceedingly vascular, and presented both spots of extravasation, and\r\nseveral small erosions (p. 201). In a case alluded to at p. 239 as\r\nhaving fallen under my own observation, and which was also fatal in five\r\nhours, the whole villous coat of the stomach was intensely red, except\r\nwhere the folds of the rugæ protected it from contact with the poison;\r\nand the prominences of the rugæ presented corroded spots of ecchymosis.\r\nIn Dr. Dymock’s case, fatal in two hours and a half, the stomach, which\r\nI had an opportunity of examining, presented on its mucous coat many\r\nscarlet patches, and here and there a purplish appearance (p. 240).\r\nLastly, an instance is related by Pyl of this poison proving fatal in\r\nthree hours, and leaving nevertheless in the dead body distinct signs of\r\ninflammation in the stomach.[716]\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary cases in which death is delayed till the second day or\r\nlater, a considerable variety of diseased appearances has been observed.\r\nThey are the different changes of structure arising from inflammation in\r\nthe alimentary canal, in the organs of the chest, and in the organs of\r\ngeneration—together with certain alterations in the state of the blood\r\nand condition of the body generally.\r\n\r\nThe first set of appearances to be mentioned are those indicating\r\ninflammation of the alimentary canal, viz., redness of the throat and\r\ngullet,—redness of the villous and peritonæal coats of the stomach,\r\nblackness of its villous coat from extravasation of blood into it,\r\nsoftening of the villous coat, ulceration of that as well as of the\r\nother coats, effusion of coagulable lymph on the inner surface of the\r\nstomach, extravasation of blood among its contents,—finally, redness and\r\nulceration of the duodenum and other parts of the intestinal canal, and\r\nmore particularly of the rectum; to which may also be added, though not\r\nproperly a morbid phenomenon, certain appearances put on by the arsenic\r\nwhich remains undischarged.\r\n\r\nRedness of the throat and gullet is not common, at least it does not\r\noften occur in the descriptions of cases. Jaeger, however, says that in\r\nhis experiments he usually found redness at the upper and purplish\r\nstripes at the lower end of the gullet:[717] and Dr. Campbell likewise\r\nfound the gullet red in animals,[718] Similar appearances have also been\r\nremarked in man. In the case of a man who lived eight days, Dr. Murray\r\nfound the gullet very red;[719] in that of a woman who lived scarce\r\nseven hours, Dr. Booth observed the gullet inflamed downwards very\r\nnearly to the cardia;[720] and Wildberg has reported two cases of the\r\nsame nature, in one of which it is worthy of remark that the poisoning\r\nlasted only six hours.[721] On the whole, it appears probable that\r\ninflammation of the throat and gullet would be found more frequently in\r\nthe reports of cases, if it was more carefully looked for.\r\n\r\nRedness of the inner coat of the stomach is a pretty constant effect of\r\narsenic, when the case is not very rapid. All the varieties of redness,\r\nformerly mentioned among the effects of the irritant poisons generally,\r\nmay be produced by arsenic. There is nothing, however, in the redness\r\ncaused by this poison, any more than in the redness of inflammation\r\ngenerally, by which it is to be distinguished from the pseudo-morbid\r\nvarieties. (See p. 110.)\r\n\r\nIt is singular, that, however severe the inflammation of the inner\r\nmembrane of the stomach may be, inflammatory redness of the peritonæal\r\ncoat is seldom found. Yet inflammatory vascularity does occur sometimes\r\non the peritonæal coat. Sproegel found it in animals;[722] and it was\r\npresent in the case of the girl Warden, whose death gave rise to the\r\ntrial of Mrs. Smith.[723] Dr. Nissen, a Danish physician, has related\r\nanother case in which the external coat of the stomach appeared as if\r\nminutely injected with wax. But the patient had been attacked with\r\nincarcerated hernia during the progress of his illness, and the whole\r\nperitonæal membrane was in consequence inflamed.[724] A common\r\nappearance when the internal inflammation is well marked, and one often\r\nunwarily put down as inflammation of the peritonæum, is turgescence of\r\nthe external veins, sometimes so great as to make the stomach look\r\nlivid.\r\n\r\nBlackness of the villous coat from effusion of altered blood into its\r\ntexture is sometimes met with. When the colour is brownish-black, or\r\ngrayish-black, not merely reddish-black, when the inner membrane is\r\nelevated into firm knots or ridges by the effusion, and the black spots\r\nare surrounded by vascularity or other signs of reaction, the\r\nappearances strongly indicate violent irritation. I have already said\r\nthat such appearances are never imitated by any pseudo-morbid\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable appearances occasionally observed in the\r\nstomach in those instances where the body has been buried for at least\r\nsome weeks before examination, is the presence of bright yellow patches,\r\nof various sizes, which appear as if painted with gamboge, and obviously\r\narise from the oxide of arsenic diffused throughout the tissues having\r\nbeen decomposed and converted into sulphuret of arsenic by the\r\nsulphuretted-hydrogen disengaged during putrefaction. I have witnessed\r\nthis appearance in several cases. In the case mentioned at p. 247, where\r\nthe body had been buried twenty days, numerous brilliant yellow patches\r\nwere visible on the villous coat of the stomach. In the case of a female\r\nwho was poisoned about the same time with that man, and, as was\r\nsuspected, by the same individual, the body was not examined till three\r\nmonths after interment; and here broad, bright, yellow patches,\r\ndisappearing under the action of ammonia, were found under the\r\nperitonæal coat of the left end of the stomach, the adjoining great\r\nintestine, and also the muscular parietes of the abdomen. In the case of\r\nMr. Gilmour, for whose murder his wife was tried a few months ago in\r\nthis city, but acquitted,—and who undoubtedly died of poisoning with\r\narsenic, howsoever administered,—there were found fourteen weeks after\r\ndeath numerous yellow streaks and patches both on the inner surface of\r\nthe stomach, on its outer surface under the peritonæum, on the adjoining\r\ntransverse colon, and on the small intestines in contact with the\r\nstomach. From these and other parallel facts which have been\r\noccasionally noticed by the periodical press, it seems probable that the\r\nappearance in question is common in bodies which have been some time\r\nburied. It is an extremely important part of the pathological evidence.\r\nI doubt whether natural causes can occasion any appearance similar to\r\nit. And indeed, what is it but the effect of a chemical test applied to\r\nthe poison by nature?\r\n\r\nThe next appearance which may be mentioned is unnatural softness of the\r\nvillous coat of the stomach. This coat has certainly been often found,\r\nafter death from arsenic, unusually soft, brittle, and easily separable\r\nwith the nail.[725] But the same state occurs in dead bodies so often\r\nand so unconnected with previous symptoms of irritation in the stomach,\r\nthat it cannot with any certainty be assumed as the effect of irritation\r\nwhen it is found subsequently to such symptoms. So far from softening\r\nand brittleness being a necessary effect of the irritation produced by\r\narsenic, it is a fact that a condition precisely the reverse has been\r\nalso noticed. In a case which I examined, the villous coat, except where\r\nit had been disintegrated by effused blood and ulceration, was strong\r\nand firm; and the rugæ were thickened, raised and corrugated, as if\r\nseared with a hot iron.[726] Metzger once found the mucous membrane\r\ndense, thickened, and the rugæ like thick cords.[727] Pyl too once met\r\nwith the same appearance, and ascribes the thickening to gorging of\r\nvessels;[728] and in a case related by Dr. Wood of Dumfries, where I had\r\nan opportunity of examining the stomach, this appearance was present in\r\na remarkable degree, and it clearly arose from elevation of the villous\r\ncoat by effusion of blood under it.[729] Remer, in his edition of\r\nMetzger’s Medical Jurisprudence, says he once met with an instance where\r\nthe stomach was shrivelled like a bladder subjected to boiling\r\nwater.[730]\r\n\r\nSometimes the villous and also more rarely the other coats of the\r\nstomach are found actually destroyed and removed in scattered spots and\r\npatches. This loss of substance is occasionally owing to the same action\r\nwhich causes softening and brittleness of the villous coat,—the action,\r\nhowever, having been so intense as to cause gelatinization. That such is\r\nthe nature of the process appears from the breach in the membrane being\r\nsurrounded by gelatinized tissue, and not by an areola of inflammatory\r\nredness. Of this species of destruction of the coats I have seen a\r\ncharacteristic example.[731] But in other cases the loss of substance is\r\nowing to a process of ordinary ulceration, as is proved by the little\r\ncavities having a notched irregular shape, and being surrounded both by\r\na red areola and a margin of firm tissue. This was the character of the\r\nulcers in the case of Warden, which I have described elsewhere.[732]\r\nDestruction of the coats of the stomach by ulceration is not a very\r\ncommon consequence of poisoning with arsenic, as death frequently takes\r\nplace before that process can be established. It does not often occur,\r\nunless the patient survive nearly two days. Mr. Alfred Taylor, however,\r\nmentions a case fatal in seventeen hours where he found ulceration of\r\nthe stomach, and another fatal in ten hours where several small ulcers\r\nwere seen on the lesser curvature, and two nearly circular ones as big\r\nas a sixpence.[733] Mr. Hewson too informs me he found many eroded spots\r\neven in his case which proved fatal in five hours (p. 56). I suspect,\r\nhowever, that spots of healthy membrane surrounded by vascular redness\r\nare sometimes mistaken for ulcers in such cases; for indeed nothing can\r\nmore exactly resemble them. In many general works on Medical\r\nJurisprudence, and in some express treatises on arsenic, it is stated\r\nthat this poison may cause complete perforation of the stomach.[734] But\r\nthis effect is exceedingly rare. I have related one distinct example of\r\nit;[735] Professor Foderé has briefly alluded to a case he witnessed\r\nwhich proved fatal in two days and a half;[736] I have likewise found in\r\nan account of a trial in North America, an instance in which the stomach\r\nwas perforated by numerous small holes, so that when held before the\r\nlight it appeared as if riddled like a sieve;[737] but I have not been\r\nable to find in medical authors any farther authority for the general\r\nstatement. Destruction of the coats of the stomach as produced by\r\narsenic has been variously described by authors under the terms erosion,\r\ncorrosion, dissolution, ulceration. But the correct mode of describing\r\nit appears to be by the terms gelatinization, or ulceration, according\r\nto the nature of the diseased action by which it is induced. At all\r\nevents it is necessary to beware of being misled by the terms erosion,\r\ncorrosion, and the like, which all convey the idea of a chemical action;\r\nwhile it is well ascertained that a chemical action either does not\r\nexist at all between arsenic and the animal tissues, or, if it has\r\nexistence, tends to harden and condense rather than to dissolve or\r\ncorrode them. Arsenic is not a corrosive.\r\n\r\nAnother species of destruction of the coats of the stomach, which will\r\nrequire a little notice, is sloughing or gangrene. This appearance\r\noccurs frequently in the narratives of the older writers; but it has not\r\nbeen enumerated in the list of morbid appearances at the commencement of\r\nthis section, because its existence as one of the effects of arsenic is\r\nproblematical. It has not been witnessed so far as I know by any recent\r\ngood authority. Those who have mentioned it have probably been misled by\r\nthe appearance put on by the black extravasated patches, when they are\r\naccompanied by disintegration of the villous coat and effusion of clots\r\nof black blood on its surface—an appearance which resembles gangrene\r\nclosely in everything but the fetor. Sir B. Brodie has stated that Mr.\r\nJohn Hunter has preserved in his museum, as an example of a slough of\r\nthe villous coat caused by arsenic, which turned out on examination to\r\nbe nothing else than an adhering clot.[738] It is clear too, that, when\r\nMr. James speaks of having found “several gangrenous patches” on the\r\nvillous coat of the stomach, and “patches of sphacelus” in the\r\nintestines, on examining the body of a notorious French criminal,\r\nSoufflard, who poisoned himself with arsenic in prison in 1839, he\r\nmistook for gangrene what was merely extravasation; for the man lived\r\nonly twelve hours.[739]\r\n\r\nVarious secretions have been found on the inner surface of the stomach.\r\nThe mucous secretion of the inner membrane is generally increased in\r\nquantity. Frequently it is thin, but viscid, as in its natural state;\r\nbut sometimes it is both abundant and solid, as if coagulated; and then\r\nit forms either a uniform attached pellicle, or loose shreds floating\r\namong the contents.[740] In both forms it has been mistaken for the\r\nmucous membrane itself. I believe this increased secretion and\r\npreternatural firmness of the gastric mucus cannot take place without\r\nsome irritating agent being applied to the stomach. Both may occur\r\nwithout any other sign of inflammation in the mucous membrane. In a case\r\nof suicide after seduction which came under my notice in this city in\r\n1843, and which proved fatal in five hours [p. 239], the mucus in the\r\nstomach, which was very abundant, put on the appearance of curdled milk,\r\nowing to its being rendered opaque and white by the large quantity of\r\nfinely powdered arsenic diffused through it; and it was actually\r\nmistaken for curdled milk by several medical men.—Sometimes the matter\r\neffused is true coagulable lymph. This is rarely seen as the effect of\r\narsenic. I have remarked it, however, very distinctly in dogs, and Dr.\r\nBaillie saw it once in the human subject.[741] It is of course quite\r\ndecisive of the presence of inflammation. It is known from tough mucus,\r\nto which it bears some resemblance, by its reticulated disposition, and\r\nby the threads of the reticulation corresponding with inflamed lines on\r\nthe stomach beneath.\r\n\r\nAnother very common appearance is the presence of a sanguinolent fluid,\r\nor even actual blood in the cavity of the stomach. In several of the\r\ncases which have come under my own notice, the subject of analysis was a\r\nthick, dirty brownish-red fluid, evidently containing a large proportion\r\nof blood; and many other examples of the same nature are on record.[742]\r\nIn Laborde’s case formerly mentioned actual clots were found among the\r\ncontents; in the instance of a woman who died in five days, as related\r\nby Zittmann, half a pound of coagulated blood was found in the\r\nstomach;[743] and in another case mentioned by Professor Bernt, the\r\nstomach contained no less than three pounds of black ichor mixed with\r\nclots of blood.[744] A good deal of reliance has been placed on bloody\r\neffusion in proof of the administration of arsenic or some other active\r\nirritant. It is of some importance, as it appears not to be an effect of\r\nthat irritation which causes cholera.\r\n\r\nAmong the appearances observed in the stomach the presence of arsenic\r\nmay be included, though not properly speaking a morbid appearance. Under\r\nthe head of the medical evidence of poisoning generally it was stated,\r\nthat many causes conspire to remove from the stomach during life poisons\r\nwhich have actually caused death. In addition to the illustrative cases\r\nthere alluded to, I may here also refer to an interesting case\r\ncommunicated to me by Mr. J. H. Stallard, and already noticed for a\r\ndifferent purpose [p. 235]. Arsenic in no large quantity had been\r\nswallowed in tea, and death took place in four hours only. Here none of\r\nthe poison could be detected by Marsh’s process, either in the contents\r\nof the stomach, or in its tissues, or in the liver.—In the instance of\r\narsenic, however, the operation of the causes which tend to remove the\r\npoison is prevented by various circumstances, in particular by its\r\ninsolubility and firm adhesion to the stomach. Hence it happens, that\r\neven after long-continued vomiting a portion still generally remains\r\nbehind, either in the contents of the stomach or in its tissues.\r\nSometimes the arsenic exists dissolved in the contents; more commonly it\r\nis present there in the solid form; and is then either in loose\r\nparticles, or enveloped in coagulated mucus,[745] or in little clots of\r\nblood,[746] or is wrapped up in the more solid parts of the\r\ncontents.[747] Frequently it adheres to the coats of the stomach, and is\r\nthen either scattered in the form of fine dust or collected in little\r\nknots. The adhering particles are always covered by mucus; they are\r\noften surrounded by redness of the membrane or by effused blood; and\r\nsometimes they are imbedded in little ulcers.—A remarkable appearance\r\nwhich the arsenic sometimes puts on is a brilliant yellowness of its\r\nsurface, owing to its conversion into the sulphuret. This appearance\r\nexisted in six cases which have come under my own notice, first in one\r\nrelated in the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Transactions,[748] next in\r\nthe instance of Margaret Warden,[749] again in the case of a young woman\r\nwhose death gave rise to the trial of John Lovie held at Aberdeen in the\r\nAutumn Circuit of 1827, again in a case described by Dr. Wood, which I\r\nhad an opportunity of examining;[750] and lastly, in two others which I\r\nhad occasion to examine in 1842 and 1843. In one of these, the case of\r\nMr. Gilmour, adverted to at p. 265, Drs. Wylie and M’Kinlay, who\r\nexamined the body in the country, found the inner surface of the stomach\r\nthickly sprinkled with small yellow particles, some of which were very\r\nbright. In all of these cases oxide was found, as well as the sulphuret\r\nof arsenic. In the case related by Dr. Nissen [p. 264], a similar yellow\r\nappearance, observed on the surface of the arsenic, was ascribed with\r\njustice to the action of sulphuretted hydrogen-water, which had been\r\ngiven as an antidote during life.[751] In a very important case examined\r\nhere a few years ago by my colleague Dr. Traill, and which will be\r\nnoticed more particularly for a different purpose afterwards, this\r\nconversion of the oxide into sulphuret had taken place to a great extent\r\n[p. 277]. In every instance of the kind yet examined, however, the\r\nconversion has been only partial, so that a large proportion of oxide\r\ncould easily be detected by the usual process.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken not hastily to consider as arsenic every white powder\r\nwhich may be found lining the inside of the stomach. Many other white\r\npowders may obtain entrance from without; and besides, small, white,\r\nshining, pulverulent scales, not unlike finely powdered arsenic, but\r\nrarely composed of animal matter, sometimes form naturally on the mucous\r\ncoat of the stomach and intestines. In a medico-legal report published a\r\nfew years ago, Professor Orfila has noticed two instances in which these\r\nscales were mistaken for arsenic;[752] in another published not long\r\nafter he mentions that he found white particles which crackled when\r\nbruised, and appeared brilliant before the microscope, and which\r\nnevertheless were not arsenic.[753] Buchner too says he is acquainted\r\nwith an instance where, in a medical inspection on account of a\r\nsuspicion of poisoning, the villous coat of the stomach was found lined\r\nwith a white granular substance which presented the properties of a fat\r\nand contained no mineral admixture;[754] and in the case of Warden I\r\nremarked a similar appearance, which, as arsenic was found in the\r\nstomach, I was disposed to consider a sprinkling of that poison, until\r\nthe contrary was ascertained by analysis. The present caution,\r\ntherefore, is not superfluous.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases the stomach is the only situation where morbid\r\nappearances are visible, even though life has been prolonged for so much\r\nas two days. This state of matters is well exemplified by a French case\r\nof death in forty-three hours, where the stomach presented much redness\r\nand extravasated patches, but where the intestines, the larynx and the\r\ncontents of the head and chest were in a natural condition.[755] Such\r\nlimitation, however, of the diseased appearances are rare.\r\n\r\nRedness of the mucous membrane of the intestines is often present when\r\nthe stomach is much inflamed. Dissolution of the mucous coat is much\r\nless frequent in the intestines than in the stomach. Ulceration\r\noccasionally occurs in lingering cases. In the case of Mitchell, which\r\nhas been several times alluded to, the inner coat of the duodenum was\r\ndark-red, pulpy, thickened, easily separable; and on a spot as big as a\r\ncrown piece, both the inner and the muscular coats were wanting.[756]\r\nPerforation of the small intestine was found in a case communicated to\r\nme by Mr. Sandell, and detailed at page 277. But as the person survived\r\nonly eight hours, and had laboured under symptoms of disease in the\r\nbowels for some days before taking the arsenic, it is unlikely that this\r\nappearance, which has not been observed, to my knowledge, in any other\r\ninstance, arose from the action of the poison.\r\n\r\nThe signs of inflammation are seldom distinct in the small intestines\r\nmuch lower down than the extremity of the duodenum; and they do not\r\noften affect the colon. But the rectum is sometimes much inflamed,\r\nthough the colon, and more particularly the small intestines, are not.\r\nDr. Male mentions, that in man he has found the rectum abraded,\r\nulcerated, and even redder than the stomach itself;[757] and Dr. Baillie\r\nalso notices two cases in which the lower end of the rectum was\r\nulcerated.[758] A common appearance in lingering cases is excoriation of\r\nthe anus,[759] and it is said that even gangrene has been produced.[760]\r\n\r\nA late writer draws attention to the fact that in the only two fatal\r\ncases he had seen the whole colon was contracted to an extraordinary\r\ndegree;[761] and this state is mentioned in other cases. The appearance\r\ndeserves notice; but of course whatever empties the colon thoroughly\r\nwill have the same effect.\r\n\r\nThe chief appearances in the alimentary canal have now been mentioned.\r\nThe next quarter in which deceased appearances are to be met with is the\r\ncavity of the chest. Here are sometimes seen redness of the pleura,\r\nredness and congestion of the lungs, redness of the inner surface of the\r\nheart, and redness of the lining membrane of the windpipe.\r\n\r\nRedness of the diaphragmatic part of the pleura, or even of the whole of\r\nthat membrane, has been at times observed; as one would expect, indeed,\r\nfrom the pectoral symptoms which occasionally prevail during life.\r\nInflammation of the lungs themselves has also been noticed. Dr. Campbell\r\ntwice found great congestion of blood in the lungs of animals poisoned\r\nby the application of arsenic outwardly.[762] Sproegel likewise found\r\nthe pleura, pericardium, and whole lungs deeply inflamed in\r\nanimals.[763] Dr. Venables found the pleura of a bright crimson colour\r\nin some poultry maliciously poisoned with arsenic,—more redness there\r\nindeed than in the stomach.[764] Mr. James says that in his experiments\r\non animals he constantly found the lungs much gorged with blood, unless\r\nwhen death occurred quickly; but that he could see no evidence of the\r\ncongestion being inflammatory.[765] A distinct example of advanced\r\npneumonia in man is related in Pyl’s Magazine: the patient died after\r\nvomiting and purging incessantly for eight days; and on dissection the\r\nlungs were found “in the highest state of inflammation; and so congested\r\nas to resemble a lump of clotted blood.”[766] A distinct case of the\r\nsame nature is related in Henke’s Journal; this patient had obvious\r\npneumonic symptoms during life; and in the dead body the lungs were\r\nfound so gorged, that, on being cut into, nothing could be seen but\r\nclotted blood in their cellular structure.[767] In a case formerly\r\nadverted to [p. 252] of death from arsenic applied externally for\r\nscirrhus, excessive congestion was found in the lungs, “both lungs being\r\ncompletely gorged with blood, and presenting all the characters of\r\npulmonary apoplexy.”[768] In another described by Dr. Booth of\r\nBirmingham, where death occurred in seven hours only, the lungs\r\npresented sufficient congestion to have completely impeded\r\nrespiration.[769]\r\n\r\nIt has been alleged that the inner surface of the heart has been found\r\nred from inflammation. In a case examined judicially at Paris by Orfila,\r\nthe left cavities of the heart were of a mottled red hue, and in the\r\nventricle were seen many small crimson specks which penetrated into the\r\nmuscular part of the parietes. The right cavities had a deep\r\nreddish-black tint, and the ventricle of that side contained specks like\r\nthose in the other, but more faint. Orfila adds, that he had previously\r\nseen the same appearance in animals.[770] These observations are not\r\nsatisfactory. There is no evidence that the observer drew the\r\ndistinction between the redness of inflammation, and that produced by\r\nthe dyeing of the membrane with blood after death. The subject was\r\nafterwards brought before the Royal Academy of Medicine at Paris by M.\r\nGodard, who had also observed the appearance in question in a person\r\nkilled by arsenic, and who dwelt strongly on it as characteristic of\r\nthis species of poisoning. It was distinctly proved, however, by many\r\nmembers present that the appearance arises from various other\r\ncauses.[771]\r\n\r\nThe inner membrane of the windpipe is said to be sometimes affected with\r\ninflammatory redness. Jaeger found it so in animals;[772] and the\r\nsymptoms referrible to the windpipe during life would lead us to expect\r\nthe same thing in man.\r\n\r\nThe organs of generation are occasionally affected. The penis in the\r\nmale and the labia in the female have been found distended and black; in\r\nan interesting case related by Bachmann the external parts of generation\r\n(in a female) were surrounded by gangrene;[773] and in a case related in\r\nPyl’s collection the inside of the uterus and Fallopian tubes was\r\ninflamed.[774] It is probable that signs of inflammation in the internal\r\norgans of generation will be found if there have been corresponding\r\nsymptoms during life. But in truth this part of the pathology of\r\npoisoning with arsenic has not been particularly attended to.\r\n\r\nTo complete this account of the morbid appearances of the mucous\r\nmembranes, it may be added that the conjunctiva of the eyes frequently\r\npresents vascularity and spots of extravasation.[775]\r\n\r\nIt now only remains, under the head of the morbid appearances produced\r\nby arsenic, to mention certain alterations that are said to take place\r\nin the state of the blood and general condition of the body.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the state of the blood Sir B. Brodie observes in general\r\nterms, that in animals killed by arsenic it is commonly fluid.[776]\r\nHarles, on the authority of Wepfer, Sproegel, and Jaeger, says it is\r\nblack, semi-gelatinous, and sometimes pultaceous.[777] Novati alleges\r\nthat the blood after death is without exception black and liquid as\r\nafter cholera, of a blackish-purple tint that colours linen\r\nreddish-brown, viscid, opaque, and without any trace of\r\ncoagulation.[778] In a fatal case related by Wildberg the blood was\r\neverywhere fluid.[779] This condition, however, is not uniform; for Dr.\r\nCampbell found the blood coagulated in the heart of a rabbit;[780] and\r\nWepfer found it also coagulated in the dog.[781]\r\n\r\nIt has been stated by some authors in medical jurisprudence that the\r\ndead body occasionally exhales an aliaceous odour, resembling that of\r\nsublimed arsenic. This is a very questionable statement. The only fact\r\nof the kind worth mentioning is one brought forward by Dr. Klanck, as\r\noccurring in the course of certain experiments, which will presently be\r\nnoticed, on the antiseptic virtues of arsenic. Several animals which had\r\nbeen killed with arsenic are said to have exhaled an odour like that of\r\nsublimed arsenic from three to eight weeks after death.[782]\r\n\r\nA great discordance of opinion at one time prevailed among authors, as\r\nto the influence of arsenic on the putrefactive process in the bodies of\r\nthose poisoned with it. The vulgar idea, borrowed probably from the\r\nancient classics, that the bodies of those who have been poisoned decay\r\nrapidly, was till lately the prevalent doctrine of medical men, and even\r\nof medical jurists; and it was applied to arsenic as well as other\r\npoisons. Even so lately as 1776 we find Gmelin stating in his History of\r\nMineral Poisons, that the bodies of those who have died of arsenic pass\r\nrapidly into putrefaction, that the nails and hair often fall off the\r\nday after death, and that almost the whole body quickly liquefies into a\r\npulp.[783] A similar statement has been made in 1795 by a respectable\r\nauthor, Dr. John Johnstone.[784] It appears that this rapid or premature\r\ndecay does really occur in some instances. Thus in a case related by\r\nPlattner of death from arsenic administered as a seasoning for\r\nmushrooms, the body had a very putrid odour the day after death.[785]\r\nLoebel also asserts he found by experiments on animals, that after death\r\nfrom arsenic putrefaction took place rapidly, even in very cold\r\nweather.[786]\r\n\r\nIn other instances the body probably decays in the usual manner. For\r\nexample, in Rust’s Magazin is related the case of a child who died in\r\nsix hours of poisoning with arsenic, and in whose body, fourteen days\r\nafter death, the integuments were found considerably advanced in\r\nputrefaction, and the liver and kidneys beginning to soften.[787] In the\r\ncase of a man who died in two days, and in whose body arsenic was found\r\nby MM. Chapeau and Parisel throughout many of the tissues, “putrefaction\r\nwas so far advanced eight days after death as to render the examination\r\nof parts obscure.”[788] And in the course of some experiments on dogs\r\npoisoned with the oxide Dr. Seeman found the usual changes after five\r\nmonths’ interment.[789]\r\n\r\nBut it has been proved in recent times that in general arsenic has\r\nrather the contrary tendency—that, besides the antiseptic virtues which\r\nit has been long known to exert when directly applied in moderate\r\nquantity to animal substances, it also possesses the singular property\r\nof enabling the bodies of men and animals poisoned with it both to\r\nresist decay unusually long, and to decay in an unusual manner. The\r\nobservations and inquiries which have been made abroad on this subject\r\nwere little known any where else than in Germany before the publication\r\nof the earlier editions of the present work; but parallel examples have\r\nbeen since met with both in Britain and France; and in this country the\r\nimportance of the subject is generally appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe first occasion on which the antiseptic property of arsenic was\r\nbrought under public notice was about the beginning of the present\r\ncentury, in the course of the trial of the widow of a certain\r\nstate-councillor, Ursinus of Berlin. Some time before that Dr. Welper,\r\nthen medical inspector in the Prussian capital, having remarked that the\r\nbody of a person poisoned with arsenic remained quite fresh for a whole\r\nweek in summer, he attended carefully to the subject at every\r\nopportunity, and invariably, he says, found that the body resisted\r\nputrefaction. Not long after making this remark, he was concerned in\r\n1803, by virtue of his office, in the investigations in the case of the\r\nwidow Ursinus. This lady having been discovered in an attempt to poison\r\nher servant, suspicions arose regarding the previous sudden death of\r\nthree persons in her family, her husband, a young officer who had\r\ncarried on an amour with her, and an aunt from whom she derived an\r\ninheritance. They had all died in mysterious circumstances, and the lady\r\nhad been their only nurse. Dr. Welper disinterred the bodies of the\r\nhusband and aunt, which had been buried, the former two years and a half\r\nbefore at Berlin, the latter half a year afterwards at Charlottenberg;\r\nand he found them not putrid, but dried up; and specks of an appearance,\r\nwhich is described as being gangrene, but which was probably warty\r\nextravasation, were visible in the stomach. Arsenic could not be\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nHe afterwards got Dr. Klanck, his acquaintance, to make some express\r\nexperiments on animals; and the results were strikingly conformable. In\r\ndogs poisoned with arsenic and left for two months sometimes buried in a\r\ndamp cellar, sometimes exposed to the air of the cellar, the flesh and\r\nalimentary canal were red and fresh, as if pickled; and though the place\r\nwhere the carcases were subsequently buried again was flooded for eight\r\nmonths after, the intestines were eventually found entire and red, the\r\nfat converted into adipocire, and most of the muscles unaltered,—those\r\nonly being soft and greasy which were directly acted on by the water.\r\nFrom a set of comparative experiments which were made on dogs killed by\r\nblows, or poisoned by corrosive sublimate, or by opium, Klanck found,\r\nthat, after being buried in the same place, and for the same space of\r\ntime the whole soft parts of the carcases were converted into a greasy\r\nmass. In a subsequent year he repeated his experiments, the bodies,\r\nhowever, being this time left exposed to the air of the cellar. The\r\nexperiments were commenced in the month of August. In ten days there\r\nappeared slight signs of incipient putrefaction; a faint putrid smell\r\nwas exhaled, and all flies that settled on the carcase died. This state\r\ncontinued for eight or ten weeks without increasing. After that the soft\r\nparts began to grow firmer and drier, and at the same time the putrid\r\nodour was succeeded by a smell like that of garlic, which became\r\ninsupportably strong when the carcases were removed into warm air. The\r\nbodies, three years afterwards, still continued dry and undecayed.[790]\r\n\r\nA similar set of facts was again brought before the public between 1809\r\nand 1811, during the criminal proceedings in a case like that of the\r\nwidow Ursinus, tried first at Bayreuth and afterwards by appeal at\r\nMunich. A lady near Bayreuth died of five days’ illness, under symptoms\r\nof violent general irritation of the alimentary canal. Some months\r\nafterwards a variety of circumstances having raised a suspicion that she\r\nhad been poisoned by her maid, Margaretha Zwanziger, a judicial\r\ninvestigation was set on foot; the consequence of which was, that the\r\nsame woman came under suspicion of having also previously poisoned\r\nanother lady and a gentleman with whom she had been successively in\r\nservice. The bodies of the three people were accordingly disinterred,\r\none of them five months, another six months, and the third fourteen\r\nmonths after death. In all of them the external parts were not properly\r\nspeaking putrid, but hard, cheesy, or adipocirous; in the last two the\r\nstomach and intestines were so entire as to allow of their being tied,\r\ntaken out, cut up, and handled; and in one a sloughy spot was found in\r\nthe region of the pylorus. Arsenic was detected in two of the bodies by\r\nRose’s process of analysis.[791]\r\n\r\nThe next example to the same effect which will be mentioned is perhaps\r\nthe most satisfactory of all, because it was the result of an express\r\nexperiment on the human subject. Dr. Kelch of Königsberg buried the\r\ninternal organs of a man who had died of arsenic, and whose body had\r\nremained without burial till the external parts had begun to decay; and\r\non examining the stomach and intestines five months after, he found that\r\nthe hamper in which they were contained was very rotten; but that “they\r\nhad a peculiar smell, quite different from that of putrid bowels, were\r\nnot yet acted on by putrefaction, but as fresh as when first taken from\r\nthe body, and might have served to make preparations. They had lost\r\nnothing of their colour, glimmer, or firmness. The inflamed spots on the\r\nstomach had not disappeared, and the small intestines also showed in\r\nsome places the inflammatory redness unaltered.”[792]\r\n\r\nIn a recent French case, although the degree of preservation was less\r\nremarkable, the other circumstances are so striking as to render it well\r\nworthy of notice. In this instance the body was disinterred after having\r\nbeen seven years in the ground, in a high situation and sandy soil. The\r\ncoffin, which was of oak, had become dry and brittle, and no moisture\r\nappeared on the inside. The body was entire: the head, trunk, and limbs\r\nretained their situation; but the organs of the chest and belly were\r\nconverted into a brown soft mass of the consistence of plaster, which\r\nlay on each side of the spine. In this mass MM. Ozanam and Idt, the\r\nmedical inspectors, succeeded in discovering by chemical analysis a\r\nconsiderable quantity of arsenic.[793]\r\n\r\nM. Ollivier describes another French case, where the body had been\r\nburied for three years, and was found so completely dried up that the\r\ntrunk weighed only two pounds. The integuments were entire, dark-brown,\r\nand of a faint odour like decayed wood. The organs of the chest and\r\nbelly were confounded together in a foliaceous membranous mass, in which\r\nthe liver only could be distinguished, but in an exceedingly shrivelled\r\nstate. Arsenic was detected in the membranous matter by MM. Barruel and\r\nHenri. The preservative power of the arsenic was promoted in this case\r\nby the sandy nature of the soil.[794]\r\n\r\nIn the case of the girl Warden, which has been several times alluded to,\r\nthe internal organs were also preserved somewhat in the same manner as\r\nin the German cases. The body had been buried three weeks; yet the\r\nmucous coat of the stomach and intestines, except on its mere surface,\r\nwas very firm, and all the morbid appearances were consequently quite\r\ndistinct. Nay, three weeks after disinterment, except that the\r\nvascularity had disappeared, the membranes and the appearances in them\r\nremained in the same state.[795] A similar case has been recorded by\r\nMetzger. It is that of an old man who died of six hours’ illness, and in\r\nwhose stomach three drachms of arsenic were found. The body had been\r\nkept ten days in February before burial, and was disinterred eight days\r\nafter that; yet there was not the slightest sign of putrefaction any\r\nwhere.[796] A parallel case was described by myself in the Edinburgh\r\nMedico-Chirurgical Transactions;[797] and I have met with three others\r\nof the same kind since.\r\n\r\nIn a very important case, that of Mrs. Smith, which was made the subject\r\nof investigation at Bristol in December, 1834, the body was also found\r\nin a state of great preservation, modified, however, by adipocirous\r\ndecomposition, owing to the presence of water in the coffin. The body\r\nhad been fourteen months interred. The internal parts, especially of the\r\nhead and neck, were here and there decayed somewhat or converted into\r\nadipocire, the muscles and internal organs entire, though more or less\r\nshrivelled, the alimentary tube remarkably preserved, “every part being\r\nalmost as distinct as if the inspection had been made at a very short\r\nperiod after death,” “the mucous membrane sufficiently tenacious to be\r\nlifted by the forceps in as large flakes as usual;” and the reporters,\r\nDrs. Riley and Symonds, Messrs. Herapath and Kelson, seem to have had no\r\ndifficulty in ascertaining the absence of vascularity, extravasation, or\r\neven abrasion of the inner membrane. Artificial orpiment, the\r\npreparation proved to have been given [see p. 225], was found in the\r\nstomach by Mr. Herapath, and the quantity appeared to be about half a\r\ndrachm.[798]\r\n\r\nA similar instance, very remarkable in all its circumstances, was\r\ninvestigated here in 1834 by my colleague Dr. Traill to whom I am\r\nindebted for the particulars. The master of a foreign vessel died in\r\nabout twenty-four hours, apparently of malignant cholera, at a small\r\nport in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh: and the body was forthwith\r\nburied. A suspicion, however, having arisen in his native country that\r\nhe had been poisoned by his mate, an inquiry was instituted at the\r\nrequest of the foreign government; and the body was disinterred five\r\nmonths after death. The face and neck was swollen, black, and decayed;\r\nbut the rest of the body was quite free of the usual signs of\r\nputrefaction. The skin was white and firm, the muscles fresh, the lungs\r\ncrepitating, the liver and spleen much shrivelled, the stomach and\r\nintestines entire throughout their whole tissues, and capable of being\r\nhandled freely without injury. On the mucous coat of the stomach several\r\ndark patches of extravasation were found, likewise several spots and\r\nlarge patches which presented on their surface a firmly adhering bright\r\nyellow crust; and the contents of the stomach consisted of a\r\nconsiderable quantity of yellow sandy matter of the consistence of\r\npaste. The contents and adhering crusts were found to consist chiefly of\r\noxide of arsenic partially converted into sulphuret. In this instance,\r\nas in that last described, the coffin contained water, owing to its\r\nhaving laid in a sandy soil resting on clay.\r\n\r\nAn important case of the same nature was communicated to me in 1843 by\r\nMr. Sandell of Potton, Bedfordshire, and afterwards published by Mr.\r\nHedly of Bedford. A man Dazley at Wrestlingford, affected with symptoms\r\nof gastro-enteric irritation for five or six days, was seized with\r\nsickness, vomiting, heat and constriction in the throat, and great\r\nweakness, about an hour after getting a white powder from his wife; and\r\nin eight hours he expired, without any suspicion of unfair usage arising\r\nat the time. Suspicions, however, being entertained afterwards, the body\r\nwhich had not been examined at first, was disinterred in five months,\r\nduring the month of March. The countenance was so entire as to be\r\nrecognisable. Adipocire had been formed in many places. The stomach and\r\nintestines were “in a most perfect state of preservation,” as if death\r\nhad taken place only a few days previously. The stomach presented yellow\r\npatches on its outer and inner surface,—was generally red over its\r\nvillous coat, which had also been abraded near the cardiac end,—and,\r\ntogether with the small intestines, was lined with white powder and\r\ncontained more of it enveloped in much red mucus. This powder proved to\r\nbe arsenic. About the middle of the small intestines a small ulcerated\r\nopening was found, through which some arsenic had escaped.[799]\r\n\r\nThe following cases which have come under my own notice during the last\r\nfive years are also worthy of observation. In a case submitted to me on\r\nthe part of the crown in 1841, which has been adverted to above for\r\nanother purpose [p. 265], the body after being three months interred was\r\nfound with the head and face decayed and putrid; but the muscular\r\nsubstance was little changed; and the inspectors were particularly\r\nstruck with the state of preservation of the body, and also with the\r\nvery distinct state of inflammation seen over almost the whole external\r\nand internal surfaces of the alimentary canal,—a description, the\r\naccuracy of which I had afterwards an opportunity of verifying. In the\r\ncase of Mr. Gilmour (p. 265), whose body had been buried 101 days, the\r\nexternal parts were more decayed; but the alimentary canal appeared\r\nequally entire both to the original inspectors, Drs. M’Kinlay and Wylie,\r\nand likewise to myself three weeks later. But the following instance, in\r\nwhich I was consulted in 1839, is the most remarkable one of the kind\r\nthat has hitherto occurred to me; because the observations then made\r\nwere the result of an express experiment in a medico-legal\r\ninvestigation. The history of this case, which arose from small doses of\r\narsenic frequently administered, has been already given above in some\r\ndetail [p. 250]. Arsenic not having been detected in the contents or\r\ntissues of the stomach, and the trial of the individual suspected of\r\ngiving the poison being necessarily postponed for some months, I\r\nrecommended that a third examination of the body,—for it had been twice\r\ndisinterred for inspection within ten days after death,—should be made\r\nat as distant an interval as possible, in order to ascertain whether it\r\nunderwent preservation from decay. It was accordingly disinterred again,\r\nfive months after death. It had an ammoniacal, but not a putrid odour.\r\nThe skin was here and there covered with a thin sebaceous matter, at one\r\nor two places stripped of the epidermis, but for the most part natural\r\nin appearance, firm, and elastic. The nails were loose. The muscles of\r\nthe head and near the tops of the scapulæ were adipocirous, on the chest\r\nand abdomen obscurely fibrous in texture and hardened, but elsewhere\r\nunaltered, and “in the lower extremities so perfect that they might have\r\nbeen used for an anatomical demonstration.” The liver and lungs were\r\nalso in a state of good preservation, and the latter crepitated when\r\ncut. The other viscera had been removed at the previous examinations.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the experiments of Klanck on dogs adverted to above\r\nhave been more recently repeated by Hünefeld on rabbits and mice, with\r\nprecisely the same results. The animals were sometimes left in the air,\r\nat other times buried, and generally in a moist place. In every instance\r\nputrefaction made more or less progress at first; but in a few days a\r\npeculiar garlicky odour arose, from which time the progress of decay\r\nseemed to be arrested; and the bodies underwent a process of hardening\r\nand desiccation which completely preserved them.[800]\r\n\r\nOn considering attentively the illustrations now given, the toxicologist\r\ncan hardly doubt that in some cases arsenic has appeared both to retard\r\nand to modify putrefaction in the bodies of persons poisoned with it.\r\n\r\nAssuming arsenic to have been the cause of the preservation of the\r\nbodies, it becomes a point of consequence to account for its effect, and\r\nmore particularly to reconcile that effect with what has certainly been\r\nnoticed in other cases of poisoning with the same substance, namely,\r\nordinary rapidity of decay, if not actually an increased tendency to\r\nputrefaction.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of this part of the inquiry some light may be thrown upon\r\nit by separating the local from the general operation of arsenic.\r\n\r\nArsenic is a good preservative of animal textures when it is directly\r\napplied to them in sufficient quantity. This is well known to stuffers\r\nof birds and beasts, was experimentally ascertained by Guyton\r\nMorveau,[801] and has come also under my observation.[802] It is now\r\nlikewise known to be an excellent substance for preserving bodies, when\r\ninjected in the form of solution into the blood-vessels.\r\n\r\nHence, if in a case of poisoning the arsenic be not discharged by\r\nvomiting, and the patient die soon, it will act as an antiseptic on the\r\nstomach at least, perhaps on the intestines also; while the rest of the\r\nbody may decay in the usual manner. This is very well shown in a case\r\nexamined by Dr. Borges, medical inspector at Minden, fourteen weeks\r\nafter death. The stomach and intestines were firm, of a grayish-white\r\ncolour, and contained crumbs of bread, while all the other organs in the\r\nbelly were pulpy, and the external parts adipocirous.[803] It is also\r\nequally well exemplified in a case that happened at Chemnitz so early as\r\n1726, and which was examined five weeks after burial. The skin was every\r\nwhere very putrid, but the stomach and intestines were perfectly\r\nfresh.[804] In the case of Warden the appearances were precisely the\r\nsame. Three weeks after burial the Dundee inspectors found the external\r\nparts much decayed, yet three weeks later the stomach and intestines\r\nwere found by myself in a state of almost perfect preservation. A\r\nstriking experiment performed by Dr. Borges on a rabbit will likewise\r\nillustrate clearly the fact now under consideration. The rabbit was\r\nkilled in less than a day with ten grains of arsenic, and its body was\r\nburied for thirteen months in a moist place under the eaves of a house.\r\nAt the end of this period it was found, that “the skin, muscles,\r\ncellular tissue, ligaments and all the viscera, except the alimentary\r\ncanal, had disappeared, without leaving a trace; but the alimentary\r\ncanal from the throat to the anus, along with the hair and the bare\r\nbones, was quite entire.”[805]\r\n\r\nIn all of these cases arsenic was found in the body. In the rabbit\r\nexperimented on by Dr. Borges, above five grains of arsenic were\r\nseparated in the form of a metallic sublimate.\r\n\r\nBut, on the contrary, if the arsenic is all or nearly all discharged by\r\nvomiting, not only the body generally, but likewise even the stomach and\r\nintestines, may follow the usual course of decay. Accordingly, in the\r\ncase of the child formerly quoted (273), where the body putrified in the\r\nusual manner, only four grains and a half of arsenic had been taken; and\r\nas it was swallowed in a state of solution and caused violent vomiting,\r\nit must have been almost all ejected. Nay, in such circumstances, the\r\nalimentary canal, in consequence of its unnatural supply of moisture and\r\nincipient disorganization, may decay somewhat faster than other parts.\r\nThus Dr. Murray observed in the case of a man formerly mentioned (264),\r\nwho lived under violent gastritic symptoms for seven days, and vomited\r\nmuch, that the stomach, which was removed for more minute examination,\r\ndecayed so rapidly that in twenty-four hours an examination was\r\nimpracticable, while the body in general rather resisted\r\nputrefaction.[806]\r\n\r\nThe preceding statements on the differences in the state of preservation\r\nof the body after poisoning with arsenic are not then incapable of some\r\nexplanation. Nevertheless, it must be granted that the reasons assigned\r\nwill not account for all the apparent cases of the preservative powers\r\nof arsenic. And especially they will not explain how the whole body has\r\nsometimes resisted decay altogether, and become as it were mummified. It\r\nis impossible to ascribe this preservation to the spelling power of the\r\narsenic diffused throughout the body in the blood; the quantity there\r\nbeing extremely small. Consequently if the preservation of the bodies is\r\nnot occasioned by some accidental collateral cause (a mode of accounting\r\nfor the phenomena which seems inadmissible), this property of arsenic\r\nmust depend on its causing, by some operation on the living body, a\r\ndifferent disposition and affinity among the ultimate elements of\r\norganized matter, and so altering the operation of physical laws on it.\r\nThere appears no sound reason for rejecting this supposition, especially\r\nas it is necessary to admit an analogous change of affinities as the\r\nonly mode of accounting for a still more incomprehensible violation of\r\nthe ordinary laws of nature,—the spontaneous combustion, or\r\npreternatural combustibility, of the human body.\r\n\r\nThe following judicious observations by Harles on this subject are\r\nworthy of attention:—“In regard,” says he, “to this singular property of\r\narsenic, now no longer doubtful, it should be remembered that certain\r\ncircumstances will limit or impair it, while others will favour or\r\nincrease it;—circumstances, for example, connected with the soil of the\r\nburying-ground, or the air of the vaults where the bodies are deposited.\r\nDifferent soils and different conditions of the air will materially\r\naffect the decomposition of all bodies indiscriminately, and will\r\ntherefore affect likewise the antiseptic properties of arsenic. For it\r\nwould be absurd to ascribe to arsenic the power of preventing\r\nputrefaction in all circumstances whatsoever,—a power which those who\r\nmake use of it for preserving skins know very well it does not possess,\r\nand a power possessed by no antiseptic whatever, not even by\r\nalcohol.”[807]\r\n\r\nAn important consequence of the preservative tendency of arsenic is,\r\nthat in many instances the body in this kind of poisoning may be found\r\nlong after death in so perfect a state as to admit of an accurate\r\nmedico-legal inspection and a successful chemical analysis. In one of\r\nhis cases Dr. Bachmann detected arsenic in the stomach fourteen months\r\nafter interment; Dr. Borges had no difficulty in detecting it in an\r\nanimal after thirteen months; Mr. Herapath discovered it after\r\nfourteen months in the human body; M. Henry detected it after three\r\nyears and a half, and obtained no less than seven grains of metallic\r\narsenic from the shrivelled viscera;[808] and MM. Ozanam and Idt found\r\nit after the long interval of seven years.—The late experiments of\r\nOrfila and Lesueur confirm the fact that arsenic may remain long in\r\ncontact with decaying animal matter, and yet continue in such a state\r\nas to be easily detected.[809] It might be supposed that the poison\r\nwould pass off partly in the gaseous state by being converted into\r\narseniuretted-hydrogen, partly in the liquid state by becoming\r\narsenite of ammonia, a very soluble compound. But the fact\r\nnevertheless is, that, notwithstanding these reasons for its\r\ndisappearance, it may be detected after the lapse of several years.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of the diseased appearances left by arsenic in the dead\r\nbody, every change of structure has now been described which has been\r\nmentioned by authors and supported by trustworthy statements. Another\r\nset of appearances may still be noticed; but they are here separated\r\nfrom the rest, because the author who first notices them has not been\r\nsupported in the statement by any special observations of his own, or by\r\nan adequate number of facts observed by others. In an elaborate essay on\r\na case of poisoning by Professor Seiler of Wittemberg, it is said in\r\ngeneral terms that arsenic may cause gorging of the vessels of the\r\nbrain, effusion of serum into the ventricles, inflammation of the brain,\r\nand even extravasation of blood.[810] Turgescence of vessels is\r\nmentioned in several published cases, and I have myself met with it. But\r\nit is seldom so considerable as to attract attention. In the following\r\ninstance, however, which has been related by Dr. Hofer of Biberach the\r\nevidence of cerebral congestion was unequivocal. A man addicted to\r\nintoxication, but enjoying good health otherwise, was attacked after\r\nsupper with sickness, vomiting, and pain in the belly. On going to bed\r\nhe fell soon quiet; and six hours after he took ill, he was found dead.\r\nArsenic was detected in the stomach, and in what he vomited; and\r\nconsiderable redness was seen on the villous coat of the stomach. But\r\nthe most remarkable appearances were gorging of the cerebral vessels,\r\nadhesion of the dura mater to the membranes beneath, and the effusion of\r\neight ounces of serosity into the lateral ventricles.[811] The only\r\ninstance I am acquainted with to justify the opinion that extravasation\r\nof blood into the brain may occur from poisoning with arsenic, is the\r\nremarkable case of apparent death from eating poultry poisoned with\r\narsenic, which was communicated to me by Mr. Jamieson of Aberdeen. The\r\nindividual, after suffering under the usual primary symptoms, became\r\napoplectic after a fit of sneezing, and died three days afterwards; and\r\nin the dead body, besides other signs of disease in the brain, a recent\r\nclot of blood was found in the right anterior lobe. (See p. 69.)\r\n\r\nIt is quite unnecessary to notice lividity of the skin among the signs\r\nof poisoning with arsenic, except for the mere purpose of reminding the\r\nmedical jurist that, although it has been sometimes much relied on as a\r\nsign of death from arsenic, it is not of the slightest importance as a\r\nsign either of that or of any other kind of poisoning. (See p. 51.)\r\n\r\nThe action of arsenic on the alimentary canal after death will now\r\nrequire a few remarks; the purpose of which is to prepare the medical\r\ninspector for investigating attempts to impute the crime of poisoning to\r\ninnocent persons, by introducing arsenic into the dead body. Such\r\nattempts, according to Orfila, have been made; but I am not acquainted\r\nwith any actual instance.\r\n\r\nThe action of arsenic on dead intestine has been fully examined by the\r\nlast mentioned author. If it is introduced into the anus immediately\r\nafter death, and allowed to remain there twenty-four hours, the mucous\r\nmembrane in contact with it becomes of a lively red colour, with darker\r\ninterspersed patches as if from extravasation. The other coats are\r\nnatural; and so is the mucous membrane itself wherever the poison does\r\nnot actually touch it. Consequently the margin of the coloration is\r\nabrupt and well defined. When the arsenic is not introduced till\r\ntwenty-four hours after death, the part to which it is actually applied\r\npresents dark patches, while the rest of the membrane is quite\r\nhealthy.[812]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of redness in the former case is probably the result of\r\nlingering vitality. The cause of the dark appearance in the latter it is\r\nnot easy to comprehend.\r\n\r\nWhen arsenic has been applied, during life, the redness, if it has had\r\ntime to begin at all, extends to some distance from the points with\r\nwhich the poison has been in contact, and passes by degrees into the\r\nhealthy colour of the surrounding membrane.\r\n\r\nOn reviewing what has been said of the pathological appearances caused\r\nby arsenic, it must appear that the medical jurist can never be supplied\r\nfrom this source alone with satisfactory evidence of the cause of death.\r\nBut in some circumstances the evidence may amount to a strong\r\nprobability of one variety or another of irritant poisoning. Mere\r\nredness, conjoined or not with softening of the mucous membrane, may\r\njustify suspicion only. But if there should be found in the body of a\r\nperson who has died of a few days’ illness, redness, black warty\r\nextravasation, and circumscribed ulcers of the villous coat of the\r\nstomach,—effusion of blood or bloody clots among the contents of that\r\norgan,—also redness of the intestines, more especially redness and\r\nulceration of the colon and rectum,—and redness of the pharynx, or of\r\nthis along with the gullet,—the proof of poisoning with some irritant\r\nwill amount to a strong presumption. At least it is difficult to mention\r\nany natural disease which could produce in so short a time such a\r\nconjunction of appearances as this; which arsenic and other analogous\r\npoisons sometimes occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n       SECTION IV.—_On the Treatment of Poisoning with Arsenic._\r\n\r\nIt was formerly proved that arsenic acts in all its forms of chemical\r\ncombination, which have been hitherto tried, and nearly in the ratio of\r\ntheir solubility. This general fact is conformable with the law laid\r\ndown as to the influence of chemical changes on the energy of poisons\r\nwhich enter the blood [p. 37]. Hence every supposed chemical antidote\r\nmust be useless, which does not render the arsenic insoluble not only in\r\nwater, but likewise in the contents and secretions of the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe antidotes chiefly trusted to until recent times, such as vinegar,\r\nsugar, butter and other oily substances, lime-water, bitter decoctions,\r\nand the like, have now justly fallen into disuse. The liver of sulphur\r\nor sulphuret of potassium, which maintained its character for some time\r\nlonger on account of its chemical action with oxide of arsenic in\r\nsolution, is not more efficacious. The experiments of Renault on the\r\ncounter-poisons for arsenic, confirmed by the subsequent researches of\r\nOrfila, have proved that the arsenical sulphuret formed by solutions of\r\nthe liver of sulphur is scarcely less active than the oxide itself.[813]\r\n\r\nIt appears that fine impalpable powders, though inert as physiological\r\nagents, and destitute of any true chemical action with oxide of arsenic,\r\nmay nevertheless prove useful in certain limited circumstances. Thus Mr.\r\nHume of London and others have apparently found some advantage in the\r\nadministration of large doses of magnesia.[814] If this substance be of\r\nany use at all, which is doubtful, it can act only by covering the\r\narsenical particles with its fine insoluble powder, and so preventing\r\nthem from coming in contact with the surface of the stomach; for in its\r\nstate of magnesia it has no chemical action with oxide of arsenic.\r\nAnother remedy of the same nature is charcoal powder, which was proposed\r\nin 1813 with much confidence by M. Bertrand.[815] That it has some\r\nefficacy when swallowed along with the poison seems to admit of no\r\ndoubt; for the proposer of it himself swallowed five grains of arsenic\r\nin one dose along with charcoal in a state of emulsion, and sustained\r\nlittle inconvenience of any kind. In all probability it acts merely by\r\nenveloping the particles of arsenic. But it may possibly be also of\r\nservice, if recently exposed to heat, by the superficial attraction it\r\nexerts over substances in solution; through means of which property it\r\nwill remove many soluble substances from a fluid, and render them\r\ninsoluble. Charcoal, however, has been proved to be destitute of all\r\nefficacy when not administered till after the arsenic is swallowed. The\r\none must be given along with the other, otherwise it is useless.[816]\r\n\r\nFor some time past the formation of an insoluble arsenite has been aimed\r\nat by most experimentalists who have endeavoured to discover an antidote\r\nfor arsenic. But in general the arsenites, though very insoluble in\r\nwater, are sufficiently so in weak acids or in organic fluids, so that\r\nthey are soluble enough in the juices of the stomach to enter the blood\r\nin such quantity as to prove fatal. The only exception now admitted to\r\nexist is the arsenite produced when a solution of oxide of arsenic is\r\nbrought in contact with the hydrated sesquioxide of iron. The compound\r\nthus formed is held to be insoluble in the secretions of the stomach;\r\nand consequently the hydrated sesquioxide of iron is usually regarded as\r\na true antidote.\r\n\r\nThe substance, the Ferrugo of the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia,—a compound\r\nwhich differs little from the older preparation, the rust of iron, when\r\nnot deprived of its combined water,—was announced in 1834 by Drs. Bunsen\r\nand Berthold as an effectual remedy even when given some time after the\r\narsenic is swallowed.[817] Their experiments were repeated with variable\r\nsuccess. Similar results were obtained by MM. Soubeiran and Miquel, as\r\nwell as MM. Orfila and Lesueur, in some experiments on dogs, and by M.\r\nBoullay on the horse.[818] The last experimentalist found that the\r\neffects of a dose adequate ta occasion death are almost entirely\r\nprevented in the horse by giving the oxide of iron either immediately\r\nafter the poison, or within four hours. Results of the same nature were\r\nobtained in this country by Mr. Donald Mackenzie.[819] Others, however,\r\nsuch as Mr. Brett[820] and Mr. Orton,[821] have failed to observe any\r\nantidotal virtues, and even deny that the sesquioxide of iron can remove\r\noxide of arsenic from a state of solution. But in 1840 the causes of\r\nthese discrepant statements were explained by Dr. Douglas Maclagan,[822]\r\nwho found, in corroboration of the remarks of Drs. Bunsen and Berthold,\r\nas well as various French authorities, that the oxide must be given in\r\nlarge quantity, and that the failures of some were owing to the quantity\r\nused having been too small. He ascertained, that, in order to remove one\r\npart of arsenic from a state of solution, twelve parts of oxide of iron\r\nin the moist state are necessary, and sixty parts if it be previously\r\ndried; that the arsenic so appropriated is with difficulty removed from\r\nthe insoluble matter even by boiling; and that, as the discoverers of\r\nthis antidote first stated, the preparation made by precipitating the\r\nsesquioxide of iron by means of ammonia, is a more active form than any\r\nother. As the oxide prepared in this way always contains ammonia, and\r\nthe proportion necessary for removing the arsenic is far greater than\r\nwhat is required to constitute a simple arsenite of iron, it is\r\nreasonable to infer that the ammonia forms a part of the insoluble\r\ncompound actually produced. At all events the action of the antidote\r\nwould appear to be chemical, and not mechanical, as has been thought by\r\nmany, and as was stated to be probable in the last edition of this work.\r\nIn confirmation of these views, and as a fact worthy of farther\r\ninvestigation on its own account, it is worthy of notice, that,\r\naccording to Dr. Duflos, the acetate of sesquioxide of iron answers\r\nequally well as an antidote with the sesquioxide itself. It precipitates\r\nboth arsenious and arsenic acid from every state of solution, and always\r\nthe more quickly the more the solution is diluted; and the co-existence\r\nof acetic acid is no obstacle to this action taking place.[823]—More\r\nrecently Professor Orfila has called in question the absolute efficacy\r\ngenerally ascribed to the sesquioxide of iron. He alleges that the\r\narsenical compound formed, though insoluble in water, is soluble to some\r\nextent in the gastric juices, and is consequently a poison to animals;\r\nthat the sesquioxide is therefore only partial in its operation as a\r\nremedy; but yet that the influence of the animal fluids in the stomach\r\nin counteracting it may be overcome by giving it in excess, so that, as\r\nfast as the compound is dissolved, it is thrown down again.[824]\r\n\r\nThe cases of the successful employment of this antidote in the human\r\nsubject, which have appeared in the periodical press during the last\r\neight years, are so numerous, that its utility can scarcely be called in\r\nquestion, whatsoever may be its precise mode of action. The hydrated\r\nsesquioxide of iron ought therefore to be kept in readiness in every\r\ndruggist’s establishment; for it cannot be prepared when wanted without\r\ngreat loss of time. The quickest way to make it is to dissolve the\r\ncommon anhydrous sesquioxide, formerly miscalled carbonate of iron, in\r\ndiluted sulphuric acid aided with a gentle heat; to decompose the hot\r\nsolution with an excess of strong ammonia; to filter off the fluid by\r\nmeans of a cloth filter and wash the precipitate well with warm water;\r\nand then to let it drain thoroughly and to squeeze out more of the water\r\nby expression. It should be kept in this state, and not allowed to dry.\r\n\r\nIn regard to all antidotes for arsenic, it must be observed, that they\r\ncan seldom be otherwise employed than in unfavourable circumstances. If,\r\nas most generally happens, the poison has been taken some time before\r\nmedical aid is obtained, its powder is diffused over the surface of the\r\nstomach, adheres with tenacity to the villous coat, and excites the\r\nsecretion of tough mucus, through which it is with difficulty reached by\r\nany antidote possessing a chemical action with it. In all cases,\r\ntherefore, it is advisable to promote vomiting occasionally, if not\r\nalready full and free, so as to aid the stomach in clearing itself of\r\nthe secreted mucus.\r\n\r\nIf the existence of a chemical antidote for arsenic be doubtful, much\r\nless is there any one known of that rarer denomination which operates by\r\nexciting in the system an action contrary to that established by the\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nA good deal, however, may be done by general medical treatment to\r\nimprove the chance of recovery. If vomiting should be delayed, as often\r\nhappens, for half an hour or more, advantage ought to be taken of the\r\nopportunity to administer an emetic of the sulphate of zinc, with the\r\nview of withdrawing the powder in mass before it is diffused over the\r\nstomach; and for the same purpose milk should be drunk both before and\r\nafter vomiting has begun, as it appears to be the best substance for\r\nenveloping the powder, and so procuring its discharge. The patient\r\nshould never be allowed to exhaust his strength in retching without a\r\nlittle milk or other fluid in his stomach to act on. At the same time,\r\nthere is probably some justice in the opinion expressed by a late writer\r\non this subject, that large draughts of diluents are injurious; and\r\nthat, unless the stomach is allowed to contract fully and frequently on\r\nitself, it cannot discharge from its surface the mucous secretion, in\r\nwhich the powder of arsenic is in general closely enveloped.[825] The\r\nstomach-pump, although it has been applied to cases of poisoning with\r\narsenic, does not possess any advantage whatever over emetics or the\r\nnatural efforts of nature, and is less effectual in expelling the mucus\r\nwhich envelopes the poison. Even emetics are unnecessary, when full\r\nvomiting is caused by the poison itself. If milk in sufficient quantity\r\ncannot be procured, strong farinaceous decoctions will probably prove\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nSupposing the poison to have been removed from the stomach, or that the\r\npatient has been put on the course which appears best fitted to\r\naccomplish that end,—two objects remain to be accomplished, namely, to\r\nallay the inflammation of the alimentary canal, and to support the\r\nsystem under that extraordinary depression which it undergoes in the\r\ngenerality of cases. Were it not for the latter of these objects, the\r\ntreatment would be both obvious and frequently successful. But it is\r\nhighly probable that the active remedies, to which the physician trusts\r\nin internal inflammations generally, and which are urgently called for\r\nby the inflammation caused by arsenic, cannot be enforced with the\r\nrequisite vigour, on account of the remote depressing effects also\r\nproduced by this poison on the body.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is certain that in a few even very aggravated cases the\r\npurest and most vigorous antiphlogistic treatment has been resorted to\r\nwith success. Dr. Roget’s patient, whose case was formerly referred to\r\nfor another purpose, seems to have been saved by venesection; and at all\r\nevents, the amelioration effected was unequivocal. In the Medical\r\nRepository there is another good example of the beneficial effects of\r\nblood-letting carried even to a greater extent than in Roget’s\r\ncase;[826] and in the Medical and Physical Journal[827] a third instance\r\nwill be found, which after the first twenty-four hours assumed the form\r\nof pure gastritis, and was treated as such with success. Blood-letting\r\nought not to be practised till the poison is nearly all discharged from\r\nthe stomach, because it promotes absorption by causing emptiness of the\r\nblood-vessels.\r\n\r\nOrfila has lately advocated the use of blood-letting, on the ground that\r\nit tends to remove from the system a portion of the poison which\r\ncirculates with the blood, and is the main source of danger to life. He\r\nhas endeavoured to show by experiments on animals, that doses adequate\r\nto cause death may be given without this result following, if depletion\r\nbe vigorously enforced along with other treatment. And he has related a\r\ncase of recovery in the human subject under unfavourable circumstances,\r\nwhere blood-letting was practised five times, and on every occasion with\r\nmarked relief.[828]\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that any material advantage will be derived from\r\ntopical blood-letting, at least in the early stage, because if depletion\r\nis to be of use at all, it must be carried at once to a far greater\r\nextent than it is possible to attain by local evacuants. Blisters on the\r\nabdomen will prove useful auxiliaries in the advanced stage.\r\n\r\nWhile many have advocated the employment of blood-letting and other\r\nantiphlogistics, and have used them with apparent advantage, Rasori was\r\nof opinion, and more recently Giacomini has strenuously maintained that\r\nthe proper treatment in all cases of arsenical poisoning is the purely\r\nstimulant method. The remedy recommended by the latter is a mixture of\r\neight ounces of beef-tea and two ounces of wine. These notions are\r\nevidently dictated by the prevailing pathological delusions of the\r\nItalian school. Although upheld in some measure by a Report of the\r\nParisian Academy of Medicine upon some experiments by M. Rognetta on\r\nthis subject,[829] Professor Orfila subsequently proved, that the\r\npractice recommended is utterly useless, if not even hurtful.[830] At\r\nthe same time no one who has ever seen a case of poisoning by arsenic\r\ncan doubt that it is often necessary to counteract the overwhelming\r\nlanguor of the circulation by the moderate use of stimulants.\r\n\r\nOpium in repeated doses will prove useful, when the poison has been\r\nremoved, and the inflammation subdued by blood-letting. And I conceive\r\nthat to the form of gastritis, caused by arsenic, may be applied a\r\nmethod of treatment by anodynes, which has been successfully used in\r\nacute inflammation generally,—the free administration of opium\r\nimmediately after copious depletion. For the safe employment of this\r\nmethod, however, it is essential that the arsenic be completely removed\r\nfrom the stomach and intestines. And from the results of many cases\r\nthere must always be great reason to apprehend, that, before the\r\ntreatment can be with propriety resorted to, the patient’s strength will\r\nbe exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe harassing fits of vomiting which often continue long after the\r\npoison has been discharged from the stomach are best removed by opium in\r\nthe form of clyster, or rubbed over the inside of the rectum in the form\r\nof ointment with the finger.\r\n\r\nThe use of laxatives is particularly required in all cases in which\r\nthere is tenesmus instead of diarrhœa, or where, in the latter stages,\r\ndiarrhœa is succeeded by constipation; and castor oil is the laxative\r\ngenerally preferred. While diarrhœa is present, and the evacuations are\r\nprofuse or the intestines have been thoroughly emptied, laxatives are\r\nunnecessary or even hurtful; but emollient clysters are advisable, and\r\nopium in the form of enema or suppository. In short, so far as regards\r\nthe intestinal affection, the treatment of the acute stage of dysentery\r\nis to be enforced.\r\n\r\nProfessor Orfila lays great stress on the employment of diuretics after\r\nthe stomach has been cleared out, and founds this practice on his\r\nobservations which show that arsenic is absorbed into the blood, and\r\ngradually discharged by the secretions, especially the urine. Experience\r\nseems to confirm theory. Dogs, after receiving a small dose, adequate to\r\noccasion death, recovered under the active administration of diuretics.\r\nHaving ascertained that this animal was constantly killed in a period\r\nvarying from thirty to forty-eight hours by two grains applied to a\r\nwound, provided no remedies were employed, he tried the diuretic method\r\nwith six which had been thus poisoned; and all of them recovered.[831]\r\nThe diuretic he recommends is a mixture of ten pounds of water, five of\r\nwhite [French] wine, a bottle of Selzer water, and three ounces of\r\nnitre; the dose of which is two wine-glassfuls frequently.[832] This\r\nmethod has been followed with success in the human subject. M. Augouard\r\nrelates a case where 230 grains produced in half an hour all the usual\r\nsymptoms, which he immediately proceeded to treat by administering a\r\ngrain and a half of tartar-emetic, to excite full vomiting. Having\r\naccomplished this object, he gave frequent doses of decoction of mallow\r\n“strongly salpetred,” which in seven hours excited so profuse a diuresis\r\nthat in the ensuing ten hours no less than eighteen imperial pints was\r\ndischarged. At the close of this period a material amendment took place,\r\nand recovery was complete in fifteen days.[833] It may be observed,\r\nhowever, that it is sometimes impossible to excite diuresis.[834]\r\n\r\nLittle need be said of the practice to be pursued in the advanced stages\r\nof poisoning with arsenic, when convalescence has begun. The principal\r\nobject is to support the system by mild nourishment, avoiding at the\r\nsame time stimulant diet of every kind, but especially spirituous and\r\nvinous liquors. Whatever may be the difference of results obtained with\r\nthe antiphlogistic mode of cure, the opposite system has been invariably\r\ndetrimental in the advanced stage.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the nervous and dyspeptic affections, which may\r\nsupervene after the symptoms of local inflammation have ceased, is not a\r\nfit object of review in this work, as it would lead to great details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n                       OF POISONING WITH MERCURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next genus of the metallic poisons includes the preparations of\r\nmercury. Some of these are hardly less important than the arsenical\r\ncompounds. They act with equal energy, produce the same violent\r\nsymptoms, and cause death with the same rapidity. They have therefore\r\nbeen often given with a criminal intent; and have thus become the\r\nsubject of inquiry upon trials. In another respect, too, they claim the\r\nregard of the medical jurist: their effects on the body, when\r\ninsidiously introduced in the practice of the arts in which mercury is\r\nused, form a branch of that department of medical police, which treats\r\nof the influence of trades on the health.\r\n\r\n\r\n SECTION I.—_Of the Chemical History and Tests for the preparations of\r\n                               Mercury._\r\n\r\nMercury is a fluid metal, exceedingly brilliant, of a silver-white\r\ncolour, and of the specific gravity 13·568.\r\n\r\nWhen heated to about 660° F. it sublimes, and on cooling it condenses\r\nunchanged. If this experiment is made in a small glass tube, the metal\r\nforms a white ring of brilliant globules, which may be made to coalesce\r\ninto a single large one. In this way its physical properties may be\r\nrecognised, though the quantity is exceedingly minute.\r\n\r\nTwo oxides of this metal, a protoxide and peroxide, exist in combination\r\nwith acids. A bluish-gray or grayish-black protoxide is separated from\r\nthe salts of the protoxide by the fixed alkalis. The peroxide has an\r\norange-red colour, and is the common red precipitate of the apothecary.\r\nMercury unites with sulphur in two proportions. The proto-sulphuret,\r\nwhich is black, is formed from the salts of the protoxide by the action\r\nof sulphuretted-hydrogen: the bisulphuret is the well known pigment,\r\ncinnabar or vermilion. Mercury likewise unites with chlorine in two\r\nproportions, forming an insoluble protochloride and a soluble\r\nbichloride, the former calomel, the latter corrosive sublimate. It\r\nlikewise unites with cyanogen. Mercury also unites in the state of\r\nprotoxide and peroxide with the acids. Several compound salts are known\r\nto the chemist, but few occur in commerce or the arts.\r\n\r\nAmong the compounds resulting from the action of this metal with other\r\nsubstances, those which require notice in a toxicological treatise are\r\nthe following:—1. The binoxide or _red precipitate_; 2. The bisulphuret\r\nor _vermilion_; 3. The protochloride or _calomel_; 4. The bichloride or\r\n_corrosive sublimate_; 5. The sulphate or _Turbith mineral_; 6. The\r\n_bicyanide_ or prussiate of mercury; and 7. The _nitrates_ of mercury.\r\nIts other compounds are of little consequence to the toxicologist.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        1. _Of Red Precipitate._\r\n\r\nRed precipitate, when well prepared, is in the form of fine powder or\r\nsmall, brilliant, heavy scales of a scarlet or orange colour. It\r\nconsists of 101 mercury and 8 oxygen. It is insoluble in water.\r\n\r\nIt is easily distinguished from all other substances by the action of\r\nheat. If a little of it is heated in a small glass tube, it becomes dark\r\nbrown, and on cooling recovers its original colour. But if the heat be\r\nraised higher, metallic globules are sublimed, and oxygen gas is\r\ndisengaged. The escape of oxygen may be ascertained by plunging to the\r\nbottom a small bit of burning wood, when the combustion will be observed\r\nto be enlivened.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           2. _Of Cinnabar._\r\n\r\nCinnabar or vermilion, the bisulphuret of mercury, usually exists in the\r\narts in the form of a fine, heavy, red powder, of a peculiar tint, which\r\nis termed from this substance vermilion-red. In mass its structure is\r\ncoarsely-fibrous, and its colour reddish-brown; and it has some lustre.\r\nWhen thrown down from a solution of corrosive sublimate by\r\nsulphuretted-hydrogen, or the alkaline hydrosulphates, it forms a black\r\npowder, which acquires a red tint by being sublimed. It is composed of\r\n101 metal and 16 sulphur.\r\n\r\nIt is distinguished from other substances by the operation of heat, and\r\nby the effects of reduction with iron filings. Heated alone in a tube it\r\nsublimes without change. Its colour, indeed, which is fugacious under\r\nheat unless particular manipulations are used, becomes darker and dingy;\r\nbut its lustre and crystalline texture are retained. Heated with iron\r\nfilings in a tube, it gives off globules of mercury; and the existence\r\nof sulphuret of iron in what remains may be proved by the escape of\r\nsulphuretted-hydrogen on the addition of diluted sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        3. _Of Turbith Mineral._\r\n\r\nThe Turbith mineral, or subsulphate of the binoxide of mercury, exists\r\nin the form of a bright lemon-yellow, heavy powder. It is soluble in\r\n2000 parts of water, and has an acrid taste.\r\n\r\nIt may be known by the effects of heat. When heated in a tube, globules\r\nof mercury are sublimed, and at the same time sulphurous acid gas is\r\ndisengaged, as may be ascertained by the smell. But a better method of\r\nproving the existence of sulphuric acid in it is to expose it to the\r\naction of a solution of caustic potass: The potass separates from it the\r\nbrownish-yellow peroxide, and appropriates the sulphuric acid, which may\r\nbe found in the solution by acidulating with nitric acid, and then\r\nadding hydrochlorate of baryta, when a heavy, snow-white precipitate of\r\nsulphate of baryta will form. The nitric acid used in this process must\r\nbe quite pure, and free of sulphuric acid, which the acid of commerce\r\noften contains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            4. _Of Calomel._\r\n\r\nCalomel (muriate, mild muriate, chloride, protochloride of mercury), is\r\ncommonly met with in the shops in the form of a heavy powder, having a\r\nfaint yellowish-white colour, and no taste or smell. In mass it forms\r\ncompact, fibrous, translucent, shining cakes of great density. It is\r\ninsoluble in water.\r\n\r\nIt is distinguished by the effects of heat, and those of the solution of\r\ncaustic potass. Heated in a tube it sublimes unchanged, and condenses in\r\na crystalline or crumbly mass. The solution of caustic potass or soda\r\nturns it at once black, disengaging protoxide of mercury and acquiring\r\nhydrochloric acid, the presence of which is proved by neutralizing the\r\nsolution with nitric acid, and adding nitrate of silver, when a heavy\r\nwhite precipitate is formed, the chloride of silver. In applying this\r\nprocess, care must be taken to employ potass quite free of muriates, and\r\nnitric acid free of muriatic acid. Ammonia also renders calomel powder\r\nblack, but the action and product are much more complex in their nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      5. _Of Corrosive Sublimate._\r\n\r\nCorrosive sublimate (oxymuriate, corrosive muriate, bichloride of\r\nmercury), is by far the most important of the mercurial poisons, as it\r\nis both the most active of them, and the one most frequently used for\r\ncriminal purposes. It is commonly met with in the form of a heavy,\r\nsnow-white powder, or of small, broken crystals, or in white, compact,\r\nconcave, crystalline cakes. It is permanent in the air; but in the\r\nsunshine is slowly decomposed, a gray insoluble powder being formed. It\r\nreadily crystallizes, and the common form of the crystals is the\r\nquadrangular prism. Its specific gravity is 5·2. Its taste is strongly\r\nstyptic, metallic, acrid, and persistent; and its dust powerfully\r\nirritates the nostrils. It is soluble, according to Thenard, in 20,\r\naccording to Orfila, in 11 parts of temperate water, and in thrice its\r\nweight of boiling water. Its solution faintly reddens litmus. It is more\r\nsoluble in alcohol than in water, boiling alcohol dissolving its own\r\nweight, and retaining when it cools, a fourth part. It is also very\r\nsoluble in ether, so that ether will remove it from its aqueous\r\nsolution. Corrosive sublimate may become the subject of a medico-legal\r\nanalysis in three states. It may be in the solid form; it may be\r\ndissolved in water along with other mineral substances; and it may be\r\nmixed with vegetable and animal fluids or solids.\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Of the Tests for Corrosive Sublimate in the solid state._\r\n\r\nCorrosive sublimate in the solid state is distinguished from other\r\nsubstances by the action of the heat, and the effects of solution of\r\ncaustic potass. Subjected to heat alone it sublimes in white acrid\r\nfumes; and if the experiment is made in a little tube, it condenses\r\nagain unaltered in a crystalline cake. Treated with solution of caustic\r\npotass, it becomes yellow, the binoxide being disengaged, and\r\nhydrochloric acid uniting with the potass, as may be proved by nitrate\r\nof silver, after filtration and neutralization with nitric acid. The\r\nyellow colour of the binoxide which is separated in this process\r\ndistinguishes corrosive sublimate from calomel, which is also decomposed\r\nby the potass solution, but yields a black protoxide. Caustic soda has\r\nthe same effect. Not so caustic ammonia: Ammonia blackens calomel, but\r\ndoes not change the colour of corrosive sublimate, as it forms with it a\r\nwhite triple salt, commonly called white precipitate.\r\n\r\nThe process here described is the best and simplest method of\r\ndetermining chemically the nature of corrosive sublimate in its solid\r\nstate. But two other tests may also be mentioned, as they have been a\r\ngood deal used. A very good test is the process of reduction with\r\npotass, by which globules of mercury are sublimed, and a chloride of\r\npotassium left in the flux, as may be proved by the action of nitrate of\r\nsilver on the solution of the flux previously neutralized with nitric\r\nacid. This test alone will not distinguish corrosive sublimate from\r\ncalomel: The solubility of the former must be taken into\r\naccount.—Another satisfactory test is the solution of protochloride of\r\ntin. Corrosive sublimate, when left for some time in this solution,\r\nfirst becomes grayish-black, and ere long its place is supplied by\r\nglobules of mercury,—the chlorine being entirely abstracted by the\r\nprotochloride of tin, which consequently passes to the state of a\r\nbichloride. Calomel is similarly affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Of the Tests for Corrosive Sublimate in a state of Solution._\r\n\r\nTwo processes may be mentioned for the detection of corrosive sublimate\r\nin mineral solutions,—a process by reduction, and a process by liquid\r\ntests.\r\n\r\n_Reduction process._—In order to procure mercury in its characteristic\r\nmetallic state from a solution of corrosive sublimate, the following\r\nplan of procedure will be found the most delicate and convenient. Add to\r\nthe solution, previously acidulated with hydrochloric acid if very weak,\r\na little of the protochloride of tin, which will be seen presently to be\r\na liquid reagent of great delicacy. If the solution is not darkened\r\nthere is not present an appreciable quantity of mercury. If mercury is\r\npresent a bluish-gray or grayish-black precipitate falls down, owing to\r\nthe chemical action already particularized. After ebullition, this\r\nprecipitate is to be allowed to subside, first in a tall glass vessel\r\nsuited to the quantity of the solution, and afterwards in the small\r\nglass tube, Fig. 7, the superincumbent fluid being previously decanted\r\noff as far as possible. After it has subsided in the tube, the remaining\r\nfluid is withdrawn with the pipette, Fig. 8; water is poured over it;\r\nand this is withdrawn again after the precipitate has subsided a third\r\ntime. The bottom of the tube is then cut off with a file, and the\r\nmoisture which remains is driven off with a gentle heat. When this is\r\naccomplished, the powder, which is nothing else than metallic mercury,\r\nsometimes runs into globules. Should it not do so, the bit of tube is to\r\nbe broken in pieces and heated in the tube, Fig. 1, when a brilliant\r\nring of fine globules will be formed. If the globules are too minute to\r\nbe visible to the naked eye, the tube is to be cut off with the file\r\nclose to the ring; and the globules may then be easily made to coalesce\r\ninto one or more of visible magnitude by scraping the inside of the tube\r\nwith the point of a penknife.\r\n\r\nThis process is not recommended as preferable to the plan by liquid\r\nreagents which is next to be mentioned, and which is both more easily\r\nput in practice, and at the same time quite as satisfactory. It is\r\nrelated chiefly because it forms the ground-work of a process for\r\ndetecting mercury in mixed animal or vegetable fluids. It will be\r\nremarked that the process does not prove with what acid the mercury was\r\ncombined in the solution. But this is a defect of little consequence;\r\nfor the only other soluble salts of mercury ever met with in the arts,\r\nnamely, the nitrate, acetate, and cyanide, are too rare to be the source\r\nof any material fallacy; and are besides all equally poisonous with\r\ncorrosive sublimate.\r\n\r\n_Process by Liquid Tests._—The process by liquid reagents consists in\r\nthe application of several tests to separate portions of the solution.\r\nThe tests which appear to me the most satisfactory are hydrosulphuric\r\nacid gas, hydriodate of potass, protochloride of tin, and nitrate of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n1. _Hydrosulphuric acid gas_ transmitted in a stream through a solution\r\nof corrosive sublimate causes a dark, brownish-black precipitate, the\r\nbisulphuret of mercury. When the solution is not very diluted, the gas\r\nforms a whitish or yellowish precipitate before the blackening\r\ncommences,—an effect which, according to Pfaff, distinguishes the salts\r\nof the peroxide of mercury from all other metals that are thrown down\r\nblack from their solutions by sulphuretted-hydrogen.[835] The cause of\r\nthis is that the particles of sulphuret first formed acquire a thin\r\ncovering of corrosive sublimate by that property which chemists of late\r\nhave termed superficial attraction. Hydrosulphuric acid is a very\r\ndelicate test of the presence of mercury. It will detect corrosive\r\nsublimate, where its proportion is only a 35000th of the solution.[836]\r\n\r\nThis test is not alone sufficient, unless reliance be placed on Pfaff’s\r\ncriterion, which is rather a trivial one; for hydrosulphuric acid\r\noccasions a black precipitate in other metallic solutions, for example,\r\nin solutions of lead, copper, bismuth and silver. In mixed organic\r\nfluids its action is not liable to be prevented; but the precipitate\r\nformed is often kept intimately suspended, as in the instance of milk.\r\nIt may be conveniently used in the form of hydrosulphate of ammonia.\r\nThis test produces a dark-brown precipitate, which is said to pass\r\nslowly to a bright cinnabar red; but I have not been able to observe any\r\ntransformation of the kind.\r\n\r\n_Hydriodate of Potass_ causes in solutions of corrosive sublimate a\r\nbeautiful pale scarlet precipitate, which rapidly deepens in tint. The\r\nprecipitate is the biniodide of mercury. This is a test of great\r\ndelicacy when skilfully used, as it acts where the salt forms only a\r\n7000th of the solution (Devergie). Care must be taken, however, not to\r\nadd too much of the test, because the precipitate is soluble in an\r\nexcess of the hydriodate, or too little, because the precipitate is also\r\nsoluble in a considerable excess of corrosive sublimate.\r\n\r\nThe action of hydriodate of potass is not liable to any important\r\nambiguity: no other iodide resembles in colour the biniodide of mercury.\r\nIt is not a certain test, however, when other salts exist in solution\r\nalong with corrosive sublimate. Chloride of sodium, nitrate of potass,\r\nand probably also other neutral salts possess the power of dissolving\r\nthe precipitate. Sulphuric and nitric acids, even considerably diluted,\r\noxidate and dissolve the mercury, and disengage iodine, which colours\r\nthe fluid reddish-brown. When corrosive sublimate is dissolved in\r\ncoloured vegetable infusions or animal fluids, the hydriodate of potass\r\ncannot be relied on, the colour of the precipitate being altered, as in\r\ninfusion of galls, or the action of the test being suspended altogether,\r\nas by milk.\r\n\r\n_Protochloride of Tin_ causes first a white precipitate, which, when\r\nmore of the test is added, gives place to a grayish-black one. In very\r\ndiluted solutions the colour struck is grayish or grayish-black from the\r\nbeginning. In such solutions Devergie has found it useful to acidulate\r\nwith hydrochloric acid before adding the test. The chemical action here\r\nis peculiar. The white powder thrown down at first is protochloride of\r\nmercury; a part of the chlorine of the bichloride of mercury having been\r\nabstracted by the protochloride of tin, which becomes in consequence the\r\nbichloride. On more of the test being added these changes are repeated,\r\nthe chlorine is removed from the protochloride of mercury, and metallic\r\nmercury falls down. This test is one of extreme delicacy, affecting\r\nsolutions which contain only an 80,000th of salt. It is prepared by\r\nacting on tin powder or tinfoil with strong hydrochloric acid aided by a\r\ngentle heat. The solution must be kept carefully excluded from the air;\r\notherwise bichloride of tin is formed, which does not act at all on the\r\nsolution of corrosive sublimate.\r\n\r\nThe protochloride of tin is not liable to any fallacy. Neither is it\r\nliable to be suspended in its action by the co-existence of other saline\r\nsubstances. It causes precipitates with almost all animal and most\r\nvegetable fluids. But when corrosive sublimate is present, even in very\r\nsmall proportion, the precipitate is always darker than when no\r\nmercurial salt exists in solution, and frequently has its proper\r\ngrayish-black tint. This property, as will presently be seen, is the\r\nfoundation of a process for the detection of mercury in all states of\r\nadmixture with organic matters.\r\n\r\n_Nitrate of Silver_ causes a heavy white precipitate, the chloride of\r\nsilver, which darkens under exposure to light. This is a test for the\r\nchlorine of the corrosive sublimate, but not for the mercury, and is a\r\nnecessary addition to the three former tests in order to determine how\r\nthe mercury is kept in solution. It acts with very great delicacy.\r\n\r\nIt is of no use, however, when chlorine or hydrochloric acid is present\r\neither free or combined with other bases. It is not of use, therefore,\r\nin animal fluids and vegetable infusions, because very many of them,\r\nbesides organic principles which form white precipitates with this test,\r\ncontain a sensible proportion of hydrochlorate of soda.\r\n\r\nAlthough the preceding liquid reagents when employed conjunctly are\r\namply sufficient for determining the presence of corrosive sublimate in\r\na fluid, many other tests hardly less characteristic and delicate have\r\nbeen used by medical jurists. These will now be shortly mentioned.\r\n\r\n1. _Lime-Water_ throws down the binoxide of mercury in the form of a\r\nheavy yellow powder. The precipitate first thrown down is lemon-yellow,\r\nan additional quantity of the test gives it a reddish-yellow tint, and a\r\nstill larger quantity restores the lemon-yellow. This test is\r\ncharacteristic, but not so delicate as those already mentioned.—2.\r\n_Caustic Potass_ has precisely the same effect as lime-water, except\r\nthat the tint of the precipitate is always yellow—3. _Caustic Ammonia_\r\ncauses a fine, white, flocculent precipitate of intricate composition,\r\ncommonly called precipitate. It is a very delicate test; but ammonia\r\nlikewise causes a white precipitate in other metallic solutions.—4.\r\n_Carbonate of Potass_ causes a brisk-red precipitate, by virtue of a\r\ndouble decomposition, the precipitate being carbonate of mercury.—5. The\r\n_Ferro-cyanate of Potass_ causes at first a white precipitate, the\r\nferro-cyanide of mercury. The precipitate becomes slowly yellowish, and\r\nat length pale-blue, owing, it is believed, to the admixture of a small\r\nquantity of iron with the corrosive sublimate.—6. _A polished plate of\r\nCopper_ immersed in a solution of corrosive sublimate becomes in a few\r\nseconds tarnished and brownish; and in the course of half an hour a\r\ngrayish-white powder is formed on its surface. This powder, according to\r\nOrfila,[837] is a mixture of calomel, mercury, and a copper amalgam. If\r\nit is wiped off, and the plate then rubbed briskly where tarnished, it\r\nassumes a white argentine appearance.—7. _A little Mercury_ put into a\r\nsolution of corrosive sublimate is instantly tarnished on the surface;\r\nthe solution in a few seconds becomes turbid, a heavy grayish\r\nprecipitate is formed, and in no long time with the aid of agitation the\r\nwhole corrosive sublimate is removed from the solution. The powdery\r\nprecipitate is a mixture of finely divided mercury and calomel; the\r\nformer being derived from the surface of the mercury, and the latter\r\nproduced by the corrosive sublimate uniting with a larger proportion of\r\nthe metal to form the protochloride.—8. _A solution of Albumen_ causes a\r\nwhite precipitate, which is soluble in a considerable excess of the\r\nreagent. The nature of this precipitate will be discussed presently.—A\r\n_slip of Gold_ aided by galvanism, becomes silver-white in the solution,\r\nin consequence of the formation of an amalgam. When the solution is\r\nconcentrated, it may be thus tested by simply putting a few drops on a\r\nbit of gold, and touching the gold through the solution with an iron\r\npoint, as recommended by Mr. Sylvester and Dr. Paris.[838] When the\r\nsolution is very weak, a different method is necessary, and a process\r\nfor the purpose has been proposed by M. Devergie, which appears so\r\ndelicate, accurate, and at the same time simple, a mode of detecting\r\ntraces of mercury in very weak solutions, as to deserve detailed notice.\r\nA thin plate of gold, and another of tin, a few lines broad, and two or\r\nthree inches long, being closely applied to one another by silk threads\r\nat the ends, and then twisted spirally, this galvanic pile is left for\r\ntwenty-four or thirty-six hours in the solution previously acidulated\r\nwith muriatic acid; upon which the gold is found whitened, and mercury\r\nmay be obtained in globules by heating the gold in a tube. Distinct\r\nindications may be obtained by this method, where the corrosive\r\nsublimate forms but an 80,000th of the water.[839] For facility of\r\napplication, an important condition is, that the quantity of fluid\r\nshould not exceed three or four ounces, because in a larger quantity the\r\npile of the size stated above cannot remove the whole mercury. Somewhat\r\nsimilar to this is the galvanic method of Mr. Davy of Dublin. He\r\nproposes to place the suspected solution in a platinum crucible with\r\nhydrochloric acid, diluted with its own weight of water, to excite\r\ngalvanic action by immersing in the fluid a plate of zinc, and to\r\nsublime and collect the reduced mercury, by washing the crucible,\r\nheating it over a spirit-lamp, and condensing the mercurial vapours on a\r\nplate of glass placed over the mouth of the crucible.[840]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Tests for Corrosive Sublimate when mixed with Organic Fluids and\r\n                                Solids._\r\n\r\nThe process for detecting corrosive sublimate in mixtures of organic\r\nfluids and solids, such as the contents of the stomach, is now to be\r\ndescribed. But some remarks are previously required on the chemical\r\nrelations subsisting between this poison and various principles of the\r\nvegetable and animal kingdoms.\r\n\r\nThese relations are important in a medico-legal point of view on several\r\ngrounds. On the one hand, the chemical changes which corrosive sublimate\r\nundergoes often alter so much the action of its tests, as to render\r\nnecessary a process of analysis materially different from any hitherto\r\ndescribed. And on the other hand, these chemical changes, of which some\r\ntake place rapidly, others slowly, will hinder the corrosive sublimate,\r\nmore or less completely, from exerting its usual operation on the animal\r\nsystem; so that it may thus either accidentally fail to act as intended,\r\nor be checked in its operation by antidotes administered for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the researches of M. Boullay, confirmed by those of\r\nProfessor Orfila, that various vegetable fluids, extracts, fixed oils,\r\nvolatile oils and resins, possess the power of decomposing corrosive\r\nsublimate. According to M. Boullay, a part of the chlorine is gradually\r\ndisengaged in the form of hydrochloric acid, and the salt is\r\nconsequently converted into calomel, which is deposited in a state of\r\nmixture or combination with vegetable matter.[841] Some vegetable fluids\r\nproduce this change at once, others not for some hours, others not for\r\ndays, and only when aided by a temperature approaching ebullition. For\r\nexample, a strong infusion of tea, mixed with a solution of a few grains\r\nof corrosive sublimate, becomes immediately muddy, and an insoluble\r\ncloud separates in half an hour. But the remaining fluid slowly becomes\r\nmuddy again, and in eight days a considerable precipitate is formed.\r\nBoth precipitates contain mercury; the former, I find, contains 31 per\r\ncent. On the other hand, an infusion of galls in like circumstances does\r\nnot become muddy for six or seven hours. A solution of sugar does not\r\nundergo any change after being mixed with a solution of corrosive\r\nsublimate for months at the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere; but\r\nat the temperature of ebullition Boullay has found that the usual\r\nchanges ensue, though to no great extent.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Professor Taddei of Florence have farther shown, that\r\nthe property of decomposing corrosive sublimate is possessed in an\r\neminent degree by one of the vegetable solids, gluten. If the salt in\r\nsolution is properly mixed with a due proportion of gluten of wheat,\r\nthat is, about four times its weight, the water will be found no longer\r\nto contain any mercury, while the gluten becomes whitish, brittle, hard,\r\nand not prone to putrefaction. A ternary compound is formed, the\r\nprotochloride of mercury and gluten.[842] This change is effected with\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Berthollet,[843] repeated and extended by Professor\r\nOrfila,[844] have also shown that the same property is possessed by most\r\nanimal fluids and solids. Among the soluble animal principles, albumen,\r\ncaesin, osmazôme, and gelatin possess it in a high degree, but above all\r\nalbumen, the action of which has been examined with some care, as it\r\nsupplies the physician with the most convenient and effectual antidote\r\nagainst the effects of the poison.\r\n\r\nIf a solution of albumen, for example that procured by beating white of\r\neggs in water, is dropped by degrees into a solution of corrosive\r\nsublimate, a white flaky precipitate is immediately thrown down, which\r\nwhen separated and dried forms horny masses, hard, brittle, and\r\npulverizable. The precipitate is soluble in a considerable excess of\r\nalbumen; so that wherever albumen abounds in any fluid, to which\r\ncorrosive sublimate has been added, a portion of the mercury will always\r\nbe found in solution. The precipitate is also soluble in a considerable\r\nexcess of corrosive sublimate. The dry precipitate I have found to\r\ncontain 6 per cent. of metallic mercury.\r\n\r\nThe action of casein as it exists in milk is precisely the same. A\r\nsolution of corrosive sublimate, poured into a large quantity of milk,\r\ncauses no change; but if the proportion of salt be considerable, a flaky\r\ncoagulum is formed, and the milk becomes clear. The principles, osmazôme\r\nand gelatin, are similar in their effects, though not quite so powerful.\r\nUrea has no chemical action with corrosive sublimate. Of the compound\r\nanimal fluids, blood and serum have the same effects as albumen.\r\n\r\nMany insoluble animal principles, as well as all the soft solids of the\r\nanimal body, act in the same manner with vegetable gluten. Fibrin, for\r\nexample, coagulated albumen, or coagulated casein, acts precisely in the\r\nsame way. Muscular fibre, the mucous and serous membranes, the fibrous\r\ntextures, and the brain, have all the same effect: they become firmer,\r\nbrittle, white, and a white powder detaches itself from their surface,\r\nwhich contains mercury and animal matter. This chemical action, which\r\nTaddei has proved to take place in the living[845] as well as in the\r\ndead body, is the source of the corrosive property of the poison, as was\r\nfirst pointed out by Berthollet in his essay formerly quoted.\r\n\r\nIn all of the compounds thus formed by vegetable and animal substances,\r\nthe presence of mercury is easily proved by boiling the powder in a\r\nsolution of caustic potass. The organized matter is dissolved; a heavy,\r\ngrayish-black powder is formed, which is protoxide of mercury; and if\r\nthis be collected in the way formerly described, it forms running\r\nquicksilver when heated.\r\n\r\nA difference of opinion prevails as to the nature of the changes\r\neffected by the mutual action of corrosive sublimate and organic matter.\r\nFor example, in the instance of the action of albumen, which has been\r\nmost carefully examined, Berzelius and Lassaigne[846] regard the\r\nprecipitate as a compound of bichloride of mercury with albumen.\r\nProfessor Rose and Dr. Geoghegan[847] have proved it, in their opinion,\r\nto be a compound of binoxide of mercury and albumen without any\r\nchlorine. And according to Boullay it is composed of albumen in union\r\nwith calomel.[848] Lassaigne says he has found it to be a compound of\r\nten equivalents of albumen with one of mercury, or 93·33 per cent. of\r\nthe former, and 6·67 of the latter.[849] The compound with fibrin he\r\nconsiders to be analogous in composition.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the changes induced by these effects of organized matter\r\non the operation of the liquid tests for corrosive sublimate, it will in\r\nthe first place be manifest that the poison may thus be wholly removed\r\nfrom their sphere of action: it may be thrown down as an insoluble\r\nsubstance, on which any process by liquid tests hitherto mentioned will\r\nof course fail to act. But secondly, even when a moderate quantity does\r\nremain in solution, the operation of the liquid tests, as formerly\r\nnoticed under the head of each, will be materially modified. It is of\r\nsome moment for the medical jurist to remember, that by reason of the\r\nslowness with which the changes in question sometimes takes place, the\r\npoison may exist abundantly in solution at one time, and yet be present\r\nonly in small quantity after an interval of some hours or days.\r\n\r\n_Process for Organic Mixtures._—Various processes have been proposed for\r\ndetecting corrosive sublimate in organic mixtures. The first I shall\r\nmention is one proposed by myself in former editions of this work. It is\r\na double one; of which sometimes the first part, sometimes the second,\r\nsometimes both may be required. The first removes the corrosive\r\nsublimate undecomposed from the mixture, which may be accomplished when\r\nits proportion is considerable; the second, when the proportion of\r\ncorrosive sublimate is too small to admit of being so removed, separates\r\nfrom the mixture metallic mercury; and the analyst will know which of\r\nthe two to employ by using the protochloride of tin as a trial-test in\r\nthe following manner.\r\n\r\nA fluid mixture being in the first instance made, if necessary, by\r\ndividing and bruising all soft solids into very small fragments, and\r\nboiling the mass in distilled water, a small portion is to be filtered\r\nfor the trial. If the protochloride of tin causes a pretty deep ash-gray\r\nor grayish-black colour, the first process may prove successful; if the\r\nshade acquired is not deep, that process may be neglected, and the\r\nsecond put in practice at once.\r\n\r\n_First branch of the Process._—In order to remove the corrosive\r\nsublimate undecomposed, the mixture, without filtration, is to be\r\nagitated for a few minutes with about a fourth part of its volume of\r\nsulphuric ether; which possesses the property of abstracting the salt\r\nfrom its aqueous solution. On remaining at rest for half a minute or a\r\nlittle more, the etherial solution rises to the surface, and may then be\r\nremoved by suction with the pipette (Fig. 8). It is next to be filtered\r\nif requisite, evaporated to dryness, and the residue treated with\r\nboiling water; upon which a solution is procured that will present the\r\nproperties formerly mentioned as belonging to corrosive sublimate in its\r\ndissolved state. This branch of the process is derived from one of\r\nOrfila’s methods.\r\n\r\n_Second branch of the Process._—If the preceding method should fail, or\r\nshall have been judged inapplicable, as will very generally be the case,\r\nthe mixture is to be treated in the following manner. In the first\r\nplace, all particles of seeds, leaves, and other fibrous matter of a\r\nvegetable nature, are to be removed as carefully as possible. This being\r\ndone, the mixture, without undergoing filtration, is to be treated with\r\nprotochloride of tin as long as any precipitate or coagulum is formed.\r\nIf there were solid animal matters in the mixture, besides being cut and\r\ncarefully bruised as directed above, they should also be brought\r\nthoroughly in contact with the salt of tin by trituration. The mixture,\r\neven if it contains but a very minute proportion of mercury, will\r\nacquire a slate-gray tint, and become easily separable into a liquid and\r\ncoagulum. The coagulum is to be collected, washed and drained on a\r\nfilter; from which it is then to be removed without being dried; and\r\ncare should be taken not to tear away with it any fibres of the paper,\r\nas these would obstruct the succeeding operations. The mercury exists in\r\nit in the metallic state for reasons formerly mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe precipitate is next to be boiled in a moderately strong solution of\r\ncaustic potass contained in a glass flask, or still better in a smooth\r\nporcelain vessel glazed with porcelain; and the ebullition is to be\r\ncontinued till all the lumps disappear. The animal and vegetable matter,\r\nand oxide of tin united with them, will thus be dissolved; and on the\r\nsolution being allowed to remain at rest, a heavy grayish-black powder\r\nwill begin to fall down in a few seconds. This is chiefly metallic\r\nmercury, of which, indeed, globules may sometimes be discerned with the\r\nnaked eye or with a small magnifier.\r\n\r\nIn order to separate it, leave the solution at rest under a temperature\r\na little short of ebullition for fifteen or twenty minutes, or longer,\r\nif necessary. Fill up the vessel gently with hot water without\r\ndisturbing the precipitate, so that a fatty matter, which rises to the\r\nsurface in the case of most animal mixtures, may be skimmed off first\r\nwith a spoon, and afterwards with filtering paper. Then withdraw the\r\nwhole supernatant fluid, which is easily done on account of the great\r\ndensity of the black powder. Transfer the powder into a small glass\r\ntube, and wash it by the process of affusion and subsidence till the\r\nwashings do not taste alkaline. Any fibrous matter which may have\r\nescaped notice at the commencement of the process, and any lumpy matter\r\nwhich may have escaped solution by the potass, should now be picked out.\r\nThe black powder is the only part which should be preserved. If the\r\nquantity of powder is very minute, an interval of twelve hours should be\r\nallowed for each subsidence, and the tube represented in Fig. 7 should\r\nbe used.\r\n\r\nLastly, the powder is to be removed, heated, and sublimed, as in the\r\nlast stage of the process described in page 293, for detecting corrosive\r\nsublimate in a pure solution.\r\n\r\nThe second branch of this process is very delicate. I have detected by\r\nit a quarter of a grain of corrosive sublimate mixed with two ounces of\r\nbeef, or with five ounces of new milk, or porter, or tea made with a\r\nliberal allowance of cream and sugar. I have also detected a tenth part\r\nof a grain in four ounces of the last mixture, that is in 19,200 times\r\nits weight.\r\n\r\nIt may be applied successfully and without difficulty to a very large\r\nmajority of medico-legal cases. The only difficulty in the way of\r\napplying it to all organic mixtures whatever arises from the occasional\r\npresence of some vegetable matters, such as seeds, leaves, ligneous\r\nfibre and the like, which are insoluble in caustic potass, and which may\r\ntherefore be left behind with the mercurial precipitate, and obstruct\r\nthe subsequent sublimation of the metal. This difficulty may be\r\nsometimes got rid of, as recommended above, by picking such matters out\r\nof the mixture before the protochloride of tin is added. No mercury is\r\nlost by so doing, for none of it is united with these vegetable matters:\r\ncorrosive sublimate does not form any chemical compound with them as it\r\ndoes with other vegetable matters soluble in caustic potass, and with\r\nthe soft animal solids. When the particles are too small to admit of\r\nbeing thus removed, or cannot be afterwards removed during the process\r\nof washing the black powder, which is left after the action of\r\npotass—the analyst must be content with the increased facility of\r\nsublimation derived from the abstraction of other vegetable and animal\r\nadmixtures, and take care to use a tube of greater length and with a\r\nlarger ball than usual. If the sublimate is too much obscured by\r\nempyreumatized matter to exhibit distinctly its metallic, globular\r\nappearance, the portion of the tube is to be broken off, and scraped,\r\nwashed, and boiled with a little rectified spirit in a tube. If the\r\nglobules do not then become visible, a second sublimation will render\r\nthem distinct. This supplemental operation, however, will be very seldom\r\nrequired; and the process given above will be found to apply to a great\r\nmajority of instances.\r\n\r\nVarious objections brought against this process by reviewers and others\r\nwere noticed in previous editions of this work. The result of the\r\ninvestigation is, that, though not by any means a perfect process, it is\r\none of the most convenient and certain, and least fallacious of all yet\r\nproposed. The first step for separating corrosive sublimate by ether in\r\nthe undecomposed state,—which is borrowed from a suggestion of Professor\r\nOrfila, will seldom succeed; for the poison is seldom present in\r\nsufficient quantity.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed that this as well as every other method yet proposed\r\nfor discovering corrosive sublimate in compound mixtures merely\r\nindicates the presence of mercury, and does not point out its state of\r\ncombination. More especially, in the case of the contents of the\r\nstomach, if mercury be not obtained from the filtered fluid, it is\r\nimpossible to know whether what is detected in the solid matter only may\r\nnot have proceeded from calomel given medicinally. This objection can be\r\nobviated solely by sufficient evidence that calomel was not\r\nadministered; at least the different criterions laid down by Professor\r\nOrfila for distinguishing calomel in the alimentary canal from the\r\nproducts of the decomposition of corrosive sublimate do not appear\r\nsufficiently precise, or commonly applicable.[850]\r\n\r\nVarious processes for detecting corrosive sublimate in organic mixtures\r\nhave been proposed by others. But none of these seem to me preferable to\r\nthe method detailed above, with the exception of one which has been\r\nlately proposed by Professor Orfila, and which is particularly deserving\r\nof notice, because, although complex, he has found it sufficiently\r\nmanageable and delicate for detecting mercury in the animal textures and\r\nsecretions, into which it has obtained admission through the medium of\r\nabsorption in cases of poisoning with the compounds of mercury. Like the\r\nprevious process, however, it merely detects mercury, and cannot point\r\nout the state of combination in which mercury was administered, or mixed\r\nwith the substance examined.\r\n\r\nIf the suspected matter be sufficiently liquid, boil for a few minutes\r\nand filter; acidulate the product with a few drops of hydrochloric acid;\r\nand immerse some slips of copper-leaf in it for a few hours. Should they\r\nbe tarnished, dissolve oxide and chloride of copper from the surface by\r\nmeans of ammonia; wash them and press them between folds of filtering\r\npaper; cut them in pieces, and heat these in a glass tube. Globules of\r\nmercury may be obtained or not. In either case, let the liquid, in which\r\nthe plates were first immersed, be evaporated to dryness over the\r\nvapour-bath; add to the residue a sixth of sulphuric acid in a retort\r\nwith a receiver; and heat gently till a nearly dry carbonaceous mass be\r\nobtained. Boil this with an ounce and a half of nitro-hydrochloric acid\r\n[Edin. Pharm.], until the charcoal be again nearly dry. Heat what\r\nremains with boiling distilled water, filter, apply to a small part of\r\nthe liquid the copper test as just described, and try whether corrosive\r\nsublimate can be detached from the remainder by means of sulphuric ether\r\n(p. 299). The distilled fluid in the receiver may contain corrosive\r\nsublimate in considerable proportion, relatively to what existed in the\r\nsubject of analysis. In order to discover it, boil the liquid for\r\nfifteen minutes with nitro-hydrochloric acid; transmit chlorine gas for\r\nan hour, filter, and evaporate to dryness over the vapour-bath; dissolve\r\nthe residue in water, and search for corrosive sublimate both by copper\r\nplates, and by agitation with ether.\r\n\r\nIf mercury be not thus detected, proceed to the solid matter left on the\r\nfilter, by which the subject of analysis was in the first instance\r\nseparated into a liquid and solid part. Examine this by evaporation to\r\ndryness over the vapour-bath, and charring with sulphuric acid in a\r\nretort with a receiver attached; and then subject the product to the\r\nsame steps as those detailed above for the dried residuum of the liquid\r\npart.\r\n\r\nIf the materials for analysis be soft solids, especially the stomach,\r\nintestines, liver, and the like, commence at once with the process of\r\ncharring with sulphuric acid. In the case of the urine, examine both the\r\nliquid and sediment. Filter the liquid, transmit chlorine to excess, let\r\nthe product rest twenty-four hours, filter, evaporate to dryness,\r\ndissolve the residue in water acidulated with hydrochloric acid, and\r\ntest the solution both with copper-leaf and by agitation with ether.\r\nHeat the sediment with nitro-hydrochloric acid as directed above, and\r\nthen proceed as with the liquid portion of the urine.[851]\r\n\r\nSome other processes, but probably inferior to that of Professor Orfila,\r\nwill be found in the last edition of this work. It seems unnecessary to\r\nreproduce them here.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     6. _Of Bicyanide of Mercury._\r\n\r\nThe bicyanide of mercury is a compound of mercury and cyanogen. It is\r\nusually sold in the form of white, opaque, heavy, crystals, which are\r\nrhomboidal prisms. It has a disagreeable, corrosive, metallic taste. It\r\nis easily known from every other substance by the effects of heat. If a\r\nsmall quantity of it, previously well dried, be introduced into a glass\r\nphial to which a small tube is fitted by means of a cork, on the\r\napplication of heat the salt becomes black; mercury is sublimed, and\r\ncondenses in globules on the upper part of the phial; and a gas escapes,\r\nwhich has the odour of prussic acid, and burns with a beautiful rose-red\r\nflame.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    7. _Of the Nitrates of Mercury._\r\n\r\nThe nitrates of mercury are used in some of the arts, but have so rarely\r\nbeen the cause of injury to man that they are of little medico-legal\r\nimportance. I am acquainted with only one case of poisoning with\r\nthem.[852]\r\n\r\nThere are two nitrates, the protonitrate and pernitrate. 1. The\r\nprotonitrate is in transparent colourless crystals, entirely soluble in\r\nwater with the aid of a slight excess of nitric acid; and the solution\r\nis precipitated black by the alkalis, black by sulphuretted-hydrogen,\r\nwhite by muriatic acid, and yellow by hydriodate of potass. The crystals\r\nwhen heated discharge fumes of nitrous acid, and when the whole acid is\r\ndriven off the red oxide is left, which by farther heat is converted\r\ninto metallic mercury. 2. The pernitrate is similarly affected by heat.\r\nIts crystals form white or yellowish needles. Water decomposes them,\r\nseparating an insoluble yellowish subnitrate, and dissolving a\r\nsupernitrate, which is precipitated yellow by the alkalis, black by\r\nsulphuretted-hydrogen, carmine-red by the hydriodate of potass. Copper\r\nseparates mercury from both nitrates; and so does gold or platinum when\r\naided by a galvanic current.\r\n\r\n\r\n   SECTION II.—_Of the mode of Action of Mercury and the Symptoms it\r\n                            excites in Man._\r\n\r\nThe effects of mercury on the animal body are more diversified than\r\nthose of any other poison. It acts on a great number of important\r\norgans, and in consequence the phenomena of its action are\r\nproportionately various. It is not surprising, therefore, that some\r\nambiguity still prevails as to its mode of action and the circumstances\r\nby which the action is regulated.\r\n\r\nThe attention of toxicologists in their physiological researches has\r\nbeen chiefly turned to the more active preparations of mercury, and\r\nespecially to corrosive sublimate, when given in such quantity as to\r\nprove fatal in a few days at farthest. The more immediate and prominent\r\nproperties of corrosive sublimate have consequently received some\r\nelucidation. But its qualities as a slow poison, as well as the\r\nanalogous operation of the less active compounds of mercury, have not\r\nbeen experimentally examined with the same care: indeed it is\r\nquestionable whether the phenomena of the latter description as they\r\noccur in man can be studied with much advantage by means of experiments\r\non animals.—In treating of the mode in which the compounds of mercury\r\nact, the most convenient method will be to consider at present its\r\naction in the form of corrosive sublimate in large doses as ascertained\r\nby late experiments, and to reserve the consideration of the general\r\naction of mercurial poisons at large till their effects on man have been\r\nfully described.\r\n\r\nThe mode of action of corrosive sublimate has been examined particularly\r\nby Sir B. Brodie in 1812;[853] by Dr. Campbell in 1813,[854] by M. Smith\r\nin 1815,[855] by M. Gaspard in 1821,[856] and more lately by Professor\r\nOrfila.[857] The following is a short analysis of their experiments and\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe leading phenomena remarked by Sir B. Brodie, on large doses being\r\nintroduced into the stomach, were very rapid death, corrosion of the\r\nstomach, and paralysis of the heart. In rabbits and cats, from six to\r\ntwenty grains, injected in a state of solution into the stomach,\r\nproduced in a few minutes insensibility and laborious breathing, then\r\nconvulsions, and death immediately afterwards,—the whole duration of the\r\npoisoning varying from five to twenty-five minutes. After death the\r\ninner membrane of the stomach was gray, brittle, and here and there\r\npulpy,—changes precisely the same with those produced by corrosive\r\nsublimate on the dead stomach. When the chest was opened immediately\r\nafter death, the heart was found either motionless or contracting\r\nfeebly; and in both circumstances the blood in its left cavities was\r\narterial.\r\n\r\nThese experiments make it evident that the brain was acted on as well as\r\nthe heart, and that the immediate cause of death was stoppage of the\r\nheart’s action. But they do not show whether the action takes place\r\nthrough absorption, or by a primary nervous impression transmitted along\r\nthe nerves.\r\n\r\nI am not acquainted with any other experiments of consequence on the\r\noperation of corrosive sublimate when introduced into the alimentary\r\ncanal. But some interesting observations have been made by Campbell,\r\nSmith, Gaspard, and Orfila severally as to its effects when applied to\r\nthe cellular tissue or injected at once into the blood of a vein. It\r\nfollows from their researches, taken along with those of Sir B. Brodie,\r\nthat, like arsenic, corrosive sublimate is an active poison, to whatever\r\npart or tissue in the body it is applied.\r\n\r\nCampbell, Smith, and Orfila all agree in assigning to it dangerous\r\nproperties, when it is applied to a wound or the cellular tissue of\r\nanimals. Even in the solid state, and in the dose of three, four, or\r\nfive grains only, it causes death in the course of the second, third,\r\nfourth, or fifth day. The symptoms antecedent to death are generally\r\nthose of dysentery; and corresponding appearances are found after death,\r\nnamely, redness, blackness, or even ulceration of the villous coat of\r\nthe stomach and rectum, the intermediate part of the alimentary canal\r\nbeing sound. This poison, therefore, has, like arsenic, the singular\r\npower of inflaming the stomach and intestines, even when it is\r\nintroduced into the system through a wound.\r\n\r\nBut this is not its only property in such circumstances. According to\r\nSmith and Orfila, it also possesses the power of inflaming both the\r\nlungs and the heart. Orfila found the lungs unusually compact and\r\nœdematous in some parts; and Smith observed on their anterior surface\r\nblack spots, elevated in the centre, evidently the consequence of\r\neffusion of blood. As to the heart, in one of Smith’s experiments black\r\nspots were found in its substance, immediately beneath the lining\r\nmembrane of the ventricles; and Orfila invariably found in one part or\r\nanother of the lining membrane, most commonly on the valves, little\r\nspots of a cherry-red or almost black colour; nay, on one occasion he\r\nobserved these spots so soft that slight friction made little cavities.\r\nThe production of pneumonia by corrosive sublimate when applied to a\r\nwound appears well established; but the appearances assumed as\r\nindications of carditis are equivocal, since they may have arisen simply\r\nfrom dyeing of the membrane of the heart in the fluid part of the blood\r\nafter death.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Gaspard were confined to the effects of the poison\r\nwhen injected at once into the blood. They show still more clearly its\r\ntendency to cause inflammation of the lungs; and they prove that through\r\nthe channel of the blood, as through the cellular tissue, it is apt to\r\ncause inflammation of the stomach and rectum. The symptoms were\r\nvomiting, bloody diarrhœa, difficult breathing, apparent pain of chest,\r\nand bloody sputa; and death took place in a few seconds or in three or\r\nfour days, according to the dose, which varied from one to five grains.\r\nThe appearances in the dead body were principally redness in the mucous\r\nmembrane of the intestines; and in the lungs, according to the length of\r\ntime the animal survived, either black ecchymosed spots, or black\r\ntubercular masses, some inflamed, others gangrenous, others suppurated,\r\nor finally, regular abscesses separated from one another by healthy\r\npulmonary tissue.[858]\r\n\r\nBesides the effects mentioned in the preceding abstract, two of the\r\nexperimentalists referred to have likewise observed in animals the same\r\nremarkable operation on the salivary organs which forms so conspicuous a\r\nfeature in the action of the compounds of mercury on man. Dr. Campbell\r\nobserved mercurial fetor, and M. Gaspard mercurial salivation. Another\r\nwriter, Zeller, found that dogs might be made to salivate, but not\r\ngraminivorous animals.[859] Schubarth, however, remarked profuse\r\nsalivation in a horse, to which twenty-four ounces of strong mercurial\r\nointment were administered in the way of friction in sixteen days:[860]\r\nand I observed the same symptoms in a rabbit on the sixth day after the\r\ncommencement of daily mercurial inunction.\r\n\r\nThe result of the preceding inquiry is, that corrosive sublimate causes,\r\nwhen swallowed, corrosion of the stomach, and in whatever way it obtains\r\nentrance into the body, irritation of that organ and of the rectum,\r\ninflammation of the lungs, depressed action and perhaps also\r\ninflammation of the heart, oppression of the functions of the brain,\r\ninflammation of the salivary glands. These phenomena are diversified\r\nenough. But it will presently be found that other organs still are\r\nimplicated in its effects on man.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding, however, to its effects on man, some notice may be\r\ntaken of a question, connected with its mode of action, which has long\r\nbeen the subject of controversy. The experiments already quoted render\r\nit probable that corrosive sublimate, before it can exert its remote\r\naction, must enter the blood; and the facts to be enumerated under the\r\nnext head of the present section will render it probable that the milder\r\ncompounds of mercury used in medicine also act in a similar manner.\r\nPhysicians and chemists, therefore, long sought to discover this metal\r\nin the solids and fluids of the body while under its influence; and the\r\nfailure of some attempts to detect it has naturally led to its presence\r\nthroughout the system being called in question by many. This inquiry,\r\nbesides its interest in a physiological point of view, is highly\r\nimportant in respect to medico-legal practice, since it forms a material\r\nbranch of the general questions which at present occupy the attention of\r\nmedical jurists,—whether poisons that act through the blood should be\r\nsought for by chemical analysis in other parts of the body besides the\r\nstomach, intestines, or other organ to which they have been directly\r\napplied—and in what particular quarters the search should be principally\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nIn the case of mercury, the evidence of the absorption of the poison,\r\nand of its entering the tissues and secretions of the body, is now\r\nunimpeachable. This is chiefly derived from observations and experiments\r\nmade on man and animals after the long-continued use of the milder\r\npreparations of mercury; it being imagined that if the poison enters the\r\nblood at all, the greatest quantity will be found under these\r\ncircumstances. The facts may be arranged under three heads. Some relate\r\nto the discharge of metallic mercury from the living body during a\r\nmercurial course for medicinal purposes; others to the discovery of\r\nmetallic mercury in the dead body after a mercurial course, and others\r\nto the detection of mercury by a careful chemical analysis in the fluids\r\nand solids during life or after death.\r\n\r\nMany stories are related by the older authors of the discharge of\r\nrunning quicksilver from the living body during a mercurial course. Some\r\nof the most authentic of them have been collected by Zeller. In his list\r\nof cases it is stated that Schenkius met with an instance of the\r\ndischarge of a spoonful of quicksilver by vomiting; that Rhodius twice\r\nremarked quicksilver pass with the urine; and that Hochstetter once saw\r\nit exhaled with the sweat.[861] Fallopius likewise states, that in\r\npeople who had used mercurial inunction for three years, and who had the\r\nbones of the leg laid bare by suppurating nodes, he had seen quicksilver\r\ncollected in globules on the tibia; and he speaks of its being the\r\npractice in his day to draw the mercury from the body, when overloaded\r\nwith it, by successively amalgamating a bit of gold in the mouth and\r\nheating the amalgam to expel the mercury.[862] With regard to these\r\nstatements of the older authors it may be observed that, although their\r\nsingularity renders them questionable, they ought not to be rejected at\r\nonce, as some have done, merely because corresponding facts have not\r\nbeen witnessed in modern times; for no one can now-a days have such\r\nopportunities for observation as were enjoyed by Fallopius and his\r\ncontemporaries. The experiment of amalgamating gold in the mouth of a\r\nperson under a course of mercury has always failed in modern times. But\r\nwho can now have an opportunity of making the experiment during a\r\nmercurial course of three years? Besides, the statements quoted above\r\nare not all destitute of modern confirmation. Thus Fourcroy has noticed\r\nthe case of a gilder attacked with an eruption of little boils, in each\r\nof which was contained a globule of quicksilver. Bruckmann mentions the\r\ncase of a lady who subsequently to a course of mercury remarked after a\r\ndance many small black stains on her breast, and minute globules of\r\nquicksilver in the folds of her shift.[863] And Dr. Jourda has described\r\nin a late French periodical a case where fluid mercury was passed by the\r\nurine. The last fact appears satisfactory in all its circumstances. A\r\npatient had been taking corrosive sublimate for a month in the dose of a\r\ngrain, besides using for the first sixteen days a gargle containing\r\nmetallic mercury finely divided. Towards the close of the month he\r\nobserved on the sill of the window, on which he used to turn up his\r\nchamber-pot after using it, many little globules of mercury, amounting\r\nin all to four grains. Dr. Jourda on learning this observation of his\r\npatient collected some of the urine with care, and after it had stood\r\nsome time found in it a black, powdery sediment, which, when separated\r\nand dried, formed little globules of mercury.[864]\r\n\r\nThe next class of facts in favour of the entrance of mercury into the\r\nblood are derived from the discovery of the metal in the bodies of\r\npersons who had undergone a long mercurial course recently before death.\r\nIn the German Ephemerides it is said that no less than a pound of it was\r\nfound in the brain and two ounces in the skull-cap of one who had been\r\nlong salivated.[865] This is certainly too marvellous a story. But\r\nanalogous observations have been made lately. In Hufeland’s Journal it\r\nis mentioned that a skull found in a churchyard contained running\r\nquicksilver in the texture of its bones, and that there is preserved in\r\nthe Lubben cabinet of midwifery a pelvis infiltered with mercury, and\r\ntaken from a young woman who died of syphilis.[866] An unequivocal fact\r\nof the same nature has been related by Mr. Rigby Brodbelt. In a body of\r\nwhich he could not learn the history he found mercurial globules as big\r\nas a pin-head lying on the os hyoides, laryngeal cartilages, frontal\r\nbone, sternum, and tibia.[867] Another equally unquestionable fact of\r\nthe kind has been supplied by Dr. Otto. On scraping the periosteum of\r\nseveral of the bones of a man who had laboured under syphilis, he\r\nremarked minute globules issuing from the osseous substance: in some\r\nplaces globules were deposited between the bone and periosteum, where\r\nthe latter had been detached in the progress of putrefaction; and in\r\nother places, when the bones were struck, a shower of fine globules fell\r\nfrom them.[868] Wibmer observes that Fricke, surgeon to the Hamburg\r\nInfirmary, has obtained mercury by boiling the bones of persons who had\r\nbeen long under a course of mercurial inunction.[869]\r\n\r\nThe third and most satisfactory class of facts are the result of actual\r\nchemical analysis. These results were long variable. On the one hand,\r\nMayer, Marabelli,[870] and Devergie,[871] failed to detect mercury in\r\nthe fluids of people under a mercurial course; and I myself,[872] as\r\nwell as Dr. Samuel Wright,[873] had no better success in some\r\nexperiments on animals. On the other hand, Zeller detected it after\r\ndeath in the blood and bile, Cantu procured it from the urine, Buchner\r\nfound it in the blood, saliva, and urine, and Schubarth extracted it\r\nfrom the blood. The first experimentalist found that in the blood and\r\nbile of animals killed by mercurial inunction, mercury could be detected\r\nby destructive distillation, but not by any fluid tests.[874] Cantu, by\r\noperating on sixty pounds of urine, taken from persons under the action\r\nof mercury, procured no less than twenty grains of the metal from the\r\nsediment.[875] The experiments of Buchner are very satisfactory. By\r\ndestructive distillation of the crassamentum of seven ounces of blood\r\ntaken from a patient who was salivated by mercury, he obtained rather\r\nmore than a quarter of a grain of globules; two pounds of saliva yielded\r\nin the same way a 200th of a grain; and the urine contained so much that\r\nit became brownish-black with sulphuretted-hydrogen.[876] Buchner\r\nlikewise adds, that Professor Pickel of Würzburg procured mercury by\r\ndestructive distillation from the brain of a venereal patient who had\r\nlong taken corrosive sublimate.[877] Not less satisfactory are the\r\nexperiments of Dr. Schubarth. A horse after being rubbed for twenty-nine\r\ndays with mercurial ointment to the total amount of eighty ounces, died\r\nof fever, emaciation, diarrhœa, and ptyalism. On the sixteenth day, when\r\nptyalism had set in, a quart of blood was drawn from the jugular vein,\r\nand after death another quart was collected from the heart, great\r\nvessels and lungs,—extreme care being taken to collect it perfectly\r\npure. In each specimen there was procured by destructive distillation a\r\nliquor, in which minute metallic globules were visible. A copper coin\r\nagitated in the liquor was whitened; and when the oily matter was\r\nseparated by filtration and boiling in alcohol, the residue gave with\r\nnitric acid a solution, which produced an orange precipitate with\r\nhydriodate of potass.\r\n\r\nThese researches were considered adequate to prove the strong\r\nprobability of the absorption of mercurial preparations when introduced\r\ninto the animal. But the frequency with which negative results were\r\nobtained by competent inquirers, and in circumstances apparently\r\nfavourable, threw an air of doubt over the positive facts, however clear\r\nthey seem to be in themselves,—till at length Professor Orfila proved by\r\na series of careful experiments that the cause of failure must generally\r\nhave been the want of a process sufficiently delicate: for in all\r\nordinary circumstances, by using his process described above, he\r\nsucceeded in obtaining mercury in the urine and liver of animals\r\npoisoned with corrosive sublimate, as well as in the urine of patients\r\nwho were taking that salt in medicinal doses. He could not detect it,\r\nhowever, in the blood.[878] Since these investigations, Professor\r\nLanderer of Athens detected mercury in the brain, liver, lungs and\r\nspinal cord of a man who poisoned himself with two ounces and a half of\r\ncorrosive sublimate;[879] and M. Audouard has twice found it in the\r\nurine and once in the saliva of persons salivated with mercury, by\r\nsimply transmitting chlorine, exposing the liquid to the air for a day,\r\nevaporating it nearly to dryness, dissolving the residue in water\r\nslightly acidulated with hydrochloric acid, immersing copper-leaf for\r\ntwenty-four hours, and heating the stained portions in a tube.[880]\r\n\r\nThe cases of poisoning with the preparations of mercury, which have been\r\nobserved in the human subject, may be conveniently arranged under three\r\nvarieties. In one variety the sole or leading symptoms are those of\r\nviolent irritation of the alimentary canal. In another the symptoms are\r\nat first the same as in the former, but subsequently become united with\r\nsalivation and inflammation of the mouth, or some of the other disorders\r\nincident to mercurial erethysm, as it is called. In a third variety the\r\npreliminary stage of irritation in the alimentary canal is wanting, and\r\nthe symptoms are from beginning to end those of mercurial erethysm in\r\none or another of its multifarious forms.\r\n\r\nThe first variety of poisoning with mercury is remarked only in those\r\nwho have taken considerable doses of its soluble salts, particularly\r\ncorrosive sublimate. The second is produced by the same preparations.\r\nThe third may be caused by any mercurial compound.\r\n\r\n1. The symptoms in the first variety are very like what occur in the\r\nordinary cases of poisoning with arsenic,—namely, vomiting, especially\r\nwhen any thing is swallowed, violent pain in the pit of the stomach, as\r\nwell as over the whole belly, and profuse diarrhœa. But there exist\r\nbetween the effects of the two poisons some shades of difference which\r\nit is necessary to attend to.\r\n\r\nIn the first place,—taking corrosive sublimate as the best example of\r\nthe preparations which cause this variety of poisoning with mercury,—the\r\nsymptoms generally begin much sooner than those caused by arsenic. The\r\nsymptoms of irritation in the throat may begin immediately, nay, even\r\nduring the very act of swallowing;[881] and those in the stomach may\r\nappear either immediately,[882] or within five minutes.[883]\r\n\r\nSecondly, the taste is much more unequivocal and strong. Even a small\r\nquantity of corrosive sublimate, either in the solid or fluid state, and\r\nconsiderably diluted, has so strong and so horrible a taste, that no one\r\ncould swallow it in a form capable of causing much irritation in the\r\nstomach, without being at once made sensible by the taste that he had\r\ntaken something unusual and injurious. Occasionally, indeed, persons\r\nthus warned of their danger while in the act of swallowing the poison,\r\nhave stopped in time to escape fatal consequences.[884]\r\n\r\nThirdly, the sense of acridity which it excites in the gullet during the\r\nact of deglutition, and throughout the whole course of the subsequent\r\ninflammation of the alimentary canal, is usually much stronger. If the\r\ndose be not small, or largely diluted, or in the solid form, the sense\r\nof tightness, acridity, or burning in the throat and gullet during\r\ndeglutition is often far greater than ever occurs at any stage in the\r\ninstance of arsenic; and sometimes it is very severe even when corrosive\r\nsublimate is taken in the solid form.[885] The tightness and burning in\r\nthe throat often continue throughout the whole duration of the\r\npoisoning; and may be so excessive as to cause complete inability to\r\nswallow,[886] or even to speak.[887] Occasionally the affection of the\r\nthroat is the only material injury inflicted by the poison, as in a case\r\nrelated by Dr. J. Johnstone of a young woman, who tried to swallow two\r\ndrachms of corrosive sublimate in the solid state, but was unable to\r\nforce it down on account of the constriction it caused in the gullet.\r\nShe died in six days of mortification of the throat.[888] The greater\r\nviolence of the action of corrosive sublimate on the throat, compared\r\nwith that of arsenic, is evidently owing to its greater solubility and\r\npowerful chemical operation on the animal textures.\r\n\r\nFourthly, instead of the contracted ghastly countenance observed in\r\ncases of poisoning with arsenic (but which, it will be remembered, is\r\nnot invariable in that kind of poisoning), those who are suffering under\r\nthe primary effects of corrosive sublimate have frequently the\r\ncountenance much flushed, and even swelled.[889]\r\n\r\nCorrosive sublimate seems to occasion more frequently than arsenic the\r\ndischarge of blood by vomiting and purging,—obviously because it is a\r\nmore powerful local irritant.\r\n\r\nIt likewise gives rise more frequently to irritation of the urinary\r\npassages. This irritation generally consists in frequent, painful\r\nmicturition; but the secretion of urine is often suppressed altogether.\r\nInstances of this kind have been related by Mr. Valentine,[890] by my\r\ncolleague, Professor Syme,[891] by an anonymous writer in the Medical\r\nand Physical Journal,[892] by Dr. Venables,[893] by Mr. Blacklock,[894]\r\nand by M. Ollivier, in whose case, however, the poison was the bicyanide\r\nof mercury.[895] In the last three cases the suppression was total, and\r\ncontinued till death; which did not ensue, in one till eight, in the\r\nnext till five, and in the last till nine days after the poison was\r\ntaken. Sometimes, as in Ollivier’s case, the urinary irritation is\r\nattended with symptoms of excitement of the external parts, such as\r\nswelling and blackness of the scrotum and erection of the penis.\r\n\r\nAnother distinction seems to be that corrosive sublimate is more apt\r\nthan arsenic to cause nervous affections during the first inflammatory\r\nstage. The tendency to doze, which sometimes interrupts the inflammatory\r\nsymptoms caused by arsenic, has been more frequently observed in cases\r\nof poisoning with corrosive sublimate.[896] The same may be said of\r\ntremors and twitches of the extremities. Sometimes the stupor approaches\r\neven to absolute coma;[897] and the twitches occasionally amount to\r\ndistinct, nay violent convulsions.[898] In other instances paraplegia\r\nhas been witnessed.[899]\r\n\r\nAnother difference is, that the effects of mercurial irritants are fully\r\nmore curable than those of arsenic. Recovery has taken place even after\r\nhalf an ounce was swallowed, with the effect of inducing both bloody\r\nvomiting and purging.[900] This may depend in part on the greater\r\nsolubility of mercurial preparations, so that they are more easily\r\ndischarged than arsenic, which often remains in the stomach after days\r\nof continual vomiting,—and in part on corrosive sublimate and other\r\nsoluble salts of mercury being converted, in no long time and much more\r\neasily, into comparatively innocuous compounds, either by antidotes\r\nintentionally given for the purpose, or by animal principles in the\r\nsecretions and accidental contents of the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\nLastly, deviations from the ordinary course and combination of the\r\nsymptoms appear to be more rare in the instance of corrosive sublimate\r\nthan in that of arsenic.\r\n\r\nTo these general statements, it may be right to add the heads of\r\none or two actual cases, lest an exaggerated idea be conveyed of\r\nthe combination of the symptoms as they usually occur. For this\r\npurpose it will be sufficient to refer to a fatal case related by\r\nM. Devergie, to an instance of recovery, without salivation having\r\nsupervened, which is contained in Orfila’s Toxicology, and to\r\nanother by Dr. Vautier, presenting the mildest possible symptoms\r\nof this variety. In Devergie’s case, the patient, a female,\r\nswallowed three drachms of corrosive sublimate in solution, and\r\nwas soon after seized with vomiting, purging, and pain in the\r\nbelly. In five hours, when she was first seen by Devergie, the\r\nskin was cold and damp, the limbs relaxed, the face pale, the eyes\r\ndull, and the expression that of horror and anxiety. The lips and\r\ntongue were white and shrivelled; and she had dreadful fits of\r\npain and spasm in the throat whenever she attempted to swallow\r\nliquids, also burning and pricking along the course of the gullet,\r\nand increase of pain in these parts on pressure. There was\r\nlikewise frequent vomiting of mucous and bilious matter, with\r\nburning pain in the stomach and tenderness of the epigastrium on\r\nthe slightest pressure. She had farther profuse diarrhœa, with\r\npricking pain and tenesmus. The pulsation of the heart was deep\r\nand slow, the pulse at the wrist almost imperceptible, and the\r\nbreathing much retarded. In eighteen hours these symptoms\r\ncontinued without any material change; but the limbs were also\r\nthen insensible. In twenty-three hours she died in a fit of\r\nfainting, the mind having been entire to the last.[901]—Orfila’s\r\ncase was that of a gentleman who drank by mistake an alcoholic\r\nsolution of corrosive sublimate, but fortunately was so much\r\nalarmed by its taste while drinking it, that he did not finish the\r\npoisonous draught. Nevertheless, he was instantly attacked with a\r\nsense of tightness in the throat and burning in the stomach, and\r\nthen with vomiting and purging. Two hours after the accident\r\nOrfila found him with the face very full and red, the eyes\r\nsparkling and restless, the pupils contracted, and the lips dry\r\nand cracked. There was also acute pain along the whole course of\r\nthe alimentary canal, particularly in the throat. The belly was\r\nswelled, and so tender that he could not bear the weight of\r\nfomentation-cloths. The pulse was 112, small and sharp; the skin\r\nintensely hot and pungent; micturition scanty, frequent, and\r\ndifficult; the breathing very much oppressed; the purging bilious.\r\nThe patient had likewise a tendency to doze, and was affected with\r\noccasional convulsive twitches of the face and extremities, and\r\nwith constant cramps in the limbs. Next morning all the symptoms\r\nwere sensibly mitigated; and they went on decreasing till\r\nconvalescence was established in eight days. In the course of a\r\nfew weeks he recovered his usual health, without suffering\r\nsalivation.[902]—In Vautier’s case, where sixteen grains had been\r\nswallowed, the patient was immediately attacked with pain in the\r\nthroat and stomach, cold extremities, trembling of the arms and\r\nlegs, vomiting, paleness of the features, and great feebleness of\r\nthe pulse. Vomiting being promoted by frequent draughts of warm\r\nwater, and white of egg given subsequently, no further symptoms\r\nensued, those first excited slowly subsided, and in a few days\r\nrecovery took place, without any salivation. Yet it was upwards of\r\nhalf an hour before any measures could be taken for his\r\nrelief.[903]\r\n\r\nThe only material and common symptom which was wanting in the case now\r\nrelated was blood in the stools and in the matter vomited. In other\r\nrespects they are good examples of the ordinary train of symptoms in\r\ncases of the present variety. For other examples of the same nature the\r\nreader may refer particularly to the paper of Mr. Valentine, who has\r\ndescribed five cases that happened at one time in the same family, the\r\nmother having attempted to poison herself and four children.[904]\r\n\r\nIt may sometimes be necessary to know the usual duration of this variety\r\nof mercurial poisoning, and also the extremes of its duration. On these\r\npoints I have not hitherto had opportunities of consulting a sufficient\r\nnumber of cases to be able to lay down the general rule with precision.\r\nBut, so far as my inquiries go, the ordinary duration in fatal cases is\r\nfrom twenty-four to thirty-six hours. It is probable that a few may last\r\nthree days,[905] but only one instance has come under my notice where\r\nthe duration was greater; and in that instance, which is described by\r\nDr. Venables, life was prolonged under great agony from pain of the\r\nbelly, bloody vomiting, diarrhœa and suppression of urine, but without\r\nsalivation, for no less than eight days.[906] In cases of recovery the\r\nsymptoms of irritation may continue very long, and nevertheless not pass\r\ninto the second variety of this kind of poisoning,—a transition,\r\nhowever, which on the whole is uncommon. In the case of which an\r\nanalysis has been given from Orfila’s narrative, and likewise in one of\r\nMr. Valentine’s patients who recovered, the symptoms all along were\r\nthose of irritation in the alimentary canal; there was not any ptyalism,\r\nor other symptom of proper mercurial erethysm.—The shortest duration yet\r\nrecorded is two hours and a half. This was in a case related by Dr.\r\nBigsby of Newark-on-Trent, where a tea-spoonful of a concentrated\r\nsolution of nitrate of mercury was swallowed by a lad sixteen years old,\r\nand where the chief symptoms were burning pain from the mouth to the\r\nstomach, tenderness of the whole belly, mucous vomiting, and feculent\r\npurging.[907] In a case which occurred in London, and which has been\r\npublished succinctly by Mr. Illingworth, death must have occurred either\r\nas soon, or very shortly afterwards. The dose of corrosive sublimate,\r\nthough not positively ascertained, was large.[908] Next to this the\r\nshortest case recorded proved fatal in eleven hours.[909]\r\n\r\n2. The second variety of poisoning with mercury comprehends the cases,\r\nwhich begin, like the former, with irritation in the alimentary canal,\r\nbut in which the symptoms of what is called mercurial erethysm gradually\r\nsupervene. In fatal cases of this description death sometimes arises\r\nfrom the primary action of the poison, exactly as in the previous\r\nvariety; but in other instances it is owing to general disturbance of\r\nthe constitution, or the local devastation, brought on by the secondary\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to describe here the several forms of mercurial\r\nerethysm which may thus be developed, because they will immediately be\r\nconsidered under the third variety of mercurial poisoning. It is\r\nsufficient to state in passing that the leading affection is\r\ninflammation of the organs in and adjoining the mouth, and more\r\nparticularly of the salivary glands.\r\n\r\nBut it may be right to endeavour in the present place to fix the period\r\nof the poisoning at which these secondary affections may and usually do\r\ncommence. This cannot be done so satisfactorily as might be wished,\r\nbecause the cases already published which I have been able to examine do\r\nnot form a large enough induction. Among the recorded cases I have\r\nhitherto seen, salivation has never been retarded beyond the third\r\nday;[910] but in an instance of suicide by corrosive sublimate which\r\nhappened in the Castle of Edinburgh in 1826, and which was communicated\r\nto me by the late Dr. Shortt, the salivation did not begin till the\r\nfourth. Salivation seldom comes on sooner than the beginning of the\r\nsecond;[911] and the most usual date of its commencement is towards the\r\nclose of the second day. There is little doubt that it may be retarded\r\ntill a period considerably later than I have yet found recorded. It is\r\ndoubtful whether true mercurial salivation ever begins much sooner than\r\nafter the first twenty-four hours. Occasionally, however, corrosive\r\nsublimate produces salivation of a different kind, which has been\r\nmistaken for the specific variety caused by mercury. Thus in a paper on\r\nthe cure of gonorrhœa by corrosive sublimate in single large doses,\r\ncommunicated by Mr. Addington of West Bromwich to Dr. Beddoes, it is\r\nstated that a grain and a half, taken at once in half an ounce of\r\nrectified spirit, causes immediately “a great burning in the throat and\r\nstomach, and quickly afterwards a copious salivation, lasting between an\r\nhour and a half and two hours, and amounting frequently to more than a\r\nquart.”[912] These facts have been appealed to by authors in medical\r\njurisprudence as proving the rapid production of mercurial salivation.\r\nBut the effect produced is not the specific ptyalism of mercury; for its\r\nbrief duration is scarcely consistent with this supposition. And\r\nfarther, the author goes on to observe, that, if the dose be taken on\r\ngoing to bed, the latter part of the night is passed quietly, and no\r\ninconvenience is felt afterwards, even when the dose is taken five or\r\nsix times at intervals of three or four days. The effects here observed\r\nis a sympathetic phenomenon depending on the topical action of the\r\npoison. And such, I have no doubt, has been the nature of the salivation\r\nin several cases of poisoning with corrosive sublimate, which have been\r\nsupposed to be at variance with the general rule, that this affection\r\ndoes not begin till about twenty-four hours have elapsed. Such seems to\r\nhave been the nature of the salivation in a case published by Dr.\r\nPerry,[913] that of a girl who was attacked with swelling of the cheeks\r\nand lower lip, burning in the throat, flushed face, feeble pulse, and\r\ncold, clammy extremities after swallowing corrosive sublimate, and who\r\nhad a copious flow of saliva in an hour and a half; for there is no\r\nmention made of fetor, and the girl was well enough to leave the\r\nhospital in a few days,—which could scarcely happen if she had been\r\naffected with ptyalism from the constitutional action of mercury.—In\r\nlike manner Dr. Alexander Wood has related a case, fatal in fourteen\r\ndays, in which the patient said salivation came on in seven hours.[914]\r\nBut, notwithstanding Dr. Wood’s argument in support of the patient’s\r\nstatement,—for he did not see him till nine days after the poison was\r\ntaken,—there is no satisfactory evidence that the salivation was the\r\ntrue constitutional salivation of mercury, and not simply the result of\r\nits topical action, which seems to have been very severe.—Farther, in an\r\ninstance related by Dr. H. Anderson of Belfast, where salivation\r\nappeared to him to begin in nineteen hours, it seems not improbable that\r\nhe mistook for mercurial ptyalism the common salivation arising from\r\ninability to swallow on account of sore throat; for this patient too was\r\nquite convalescent in three days.[915]—Mr. Alfred Taylor alludes to a\r\ncase in Guy’s Hospital of salivation occurring in four hours; but so\r\nbriefly, that its true influence on the present question cannot be\r\njudged of.[916]—On the whole, then, although it is clear that ptyalism\r\nof one kind or another may occur very soon after corrosive sublimate is\r\nswallowed, it remains a matter of doubt, whether the true, specific\r\nptyalism, depending on the constitutional action of the poison begins\r\nsooner than after an interval of above twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nAs to the total duration of this variety in fatal cases, I have found an\r\ninstance fatal on the fourth day, salivation having begun on the\r\nsecond;[917] and Orfila quotes a case from Degner, in which the\r\ngastro-enteritic symptoms were succeeded by ptyalism about the same\r\nperiod, and which proved fatal in fifteen days.[918] These periods,\r\nhowever, probably do not form the extremes; for in such cases as the\r\nformer death is the consequence of the primary affection, and may\r\ntherefore ensue immediately after the secondary stage has begun to\r\ndevelope itself; and when death arises from profuse salivation, as in\r\nDegner’s patient, or from the ravages committed by ulceration and\r\ngangrene, it may be delayed almost as long as in cases of the third\r\nvariety of mercurial poisoning, in which there is no precursory stage of\r\ninflammation in the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\nDeath may arise, not only from the primary action of the poison, or from\r\nthe exhaustion caused by mercurial erethysm, but likewise from\r\nincidental occurrences. Thus, in Dr. Alexander Wood’s case, referred to\r\nabove, death arose directly from sudden profuse hemorrhage from the\r\nbowels, to the amount of six pounds.\r\n\r\nThe present variety of poisoning with corrosive sublimate may be\r\nconcluded with the heads of an excellent example related in the Medical\r\nand Physical Journal. The patient, a stout young girl, swallowed soon\r\nafter supper a drachm of corrosive sublimate dissolved in beer, and in a\r\nfew minutes she was found on her knees in great torture. All the primary\r\nsymptoms of this kind of poisoning were present in their most violent\r\nform,—burning in the stomach, extending towards the throat and mouth,\r\nfollowed in no long time by violent vomiting of a matter at first\r\nmucous, afterwards bilious and bloody; by purging of a brownish, fetid\r\nfluid; suppression of urine and much tenderness of the urethra and\r\nbladder; small, contracted, frequent pulse, anxious countenance, and\r\nconsiderable stupor, interrupted frequently by fits of increased pain.\r\nAll these symptoms were developed in four hours. Subsequently the pain\r\nin the stomach became much easier, but that in the throat much worse. At\r\nlength in the course of the second day, the teeth became loose, the gums\r\ntender, the saliva more abundant than natural; profuse ptyalism and\r\ngreat fetor of the breath ensued, and the patient expired towards the\r\nclose of the fourth day.[919]\r\n\r\n3. The third variety of poisoning with mercury comprehends all the forms\r\nof what is called mercurial erethysm. Without endeavouring to settle the\r\nprecise meaning of this term, which is now used in rather a vague sense,\r\nI shall consider under the present head all the secondary and chronic\r\neffects of mercury. These may be caused by any of its preparations, but\r\nare most frequently seen as the consequence of its milder compounds,\r\neither given medicinally in frequent small doses, or applied\r\ncontinuously to the bodies of workmen who are exposed by their trade to\r\nits fumes.\r\n\r\nThe secondary and chronic effects of mercury are multifarious enough in\r\nreality; but if credit were given to all that has been written, and is\r\nstill sometimes maintained on this subject, almost every disease in the\r\nnosology might be enumerated under the present head; for there is\r\nscarcely a disease of common occurrence, which has not been imputed by\r\none author or another to the direct or indirect operation of mercury.\r\nThe present remarks, however, will be confined as much as possible to\r\nwhat is well ascertained, and bears on the medical evidence of poisoning\r\nwith mercury, or is important in regard to medical police. With this\r\nview, salivation and its concomitants, the most usual of the secondary\r\neffects of mercury, will first be treated of. Some observations will\r\nthen be made on the shaking palsy, or mercurial tremor, which is caused\r\nin those who work with mercury. And in conclusion, a short view will be\r\ntaken of the other diseases which are more indirectly induced by this\r\npoison, as well as some which have been ascribed to it on insufficient\r\ngrounds. This being done, the mode of action of mercurial poisons will\r\nbe resumed, and a description given of their relative effects when\r\nintroduced by different channels and in different chemical forms.\r\n\r\n_Of Mercurial Salivation._—Mercurial salivation may be caused by any of\r\nthe preparations of mercury, and either by a single dose or by\r\nfrequently repeated small doses. It may be caused by corrosive sublimate\r\nas the secondary stage of a case which commenced with inflammation in\r\nthe alimentary canal; or it may be the first sign of mercurial action,\r\nas in the medicinal mode of administering calomel and blue pill. Even in\r\nthe latter case a single dose, and that not large, may be sufficient to\r\ninduce ptyalism of the most violent kind. When induced by a single dose\r\nit usually commences between the beginning of the second and end of the\r\nthird day, rarely within twenty-four hours. But an extraordinary case is\r\nmentioned by Dr. Bright, where five grains, put on the tongue in\r\napoplexy and not washed over, excited in three hours most violent\r\nsalivation, with such swelling of the tongue that scarifications became\r\nnecessary.[920] It commences with a brassy taste and tenderness of the\r\nmouth, swelling, redness, and subsequently ulceration of the gums;\r\npeculiar fetor of the breath; and at last an augmentation is observed in\r\nthe flow of the saliva, commonly accompanied with fulness around the\r\nlower jaw. These symptoms increase more or less rapidly. Sometimes they\r\nare very mild; nay, this form of the secondary effects of mercury may\r\nconsist in nothing else than brassy taste, tenderness of the mouth,\r\nredness of the gums, and fetor. On the other hand, the symptoms are\r\noften very violent, the salivation being profuse, the face swelled so as\r\nto close the eyes, and almost fill up the space between the jaw and\r\nclavicles, the tongue swollen so as to threaten suffocation, the inside\r\nof the mouth ulcerated, nay gangrenous, and at times the gangrene\r\nextends over the face. It is not uncommon to observe severe and\r\nextensive ulceration without particular increase of the saliva.\r\n\r\nThese local affections are almost always accompanied with more or less\r\nconstitutional disorder. If severe, they are attended with the\r\nsymptomatic fever proper to inflammation and gangrene, from whatever\r\ncause they spring. But independently of that, mercurial salivation is\r\naccompanied, and indeed commonly preceded, by a constitutional disorder\r\nor symptomatic fever of its own, which occasionally exhibits some\r\npeculiarities. The mildest affection of the mouth and salivary glands is\r\nvery generally preceded by some exaltation of the pulse and temperature,\r\nand other symptoms of fever. But when the local disorder begins\r\nviolently, and above all when this takes place by idiosyncrasy from\r\nsmall doses of mild preparations, there is often great rapidity of the\r\npulse, irregular action of the heart, and various nervous disorders\r\npossessing the hysteric character,—all of which, except the quick pulse,\r\nwill sometimes gradually abate or even disappear, when the salivation is\r\nfairly established.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of ordinary mercurial salivation being familiar to every\r\npractitioner, it is unnecessary to quote here any illustrative example;\r\nbut the following instance may be given to exemplify its most malignant\r\nforms. A patient of Mr. Potter of Chipping-Ongar, in Essex, after taking\r\neighteen grains of blue pill in divided doses during three days, was\r\nseized with excessive salivation and great constitutional disturbance,\r\nindicated by offensive evacuations, copious sweating, bleeding from the\r\nnose, purple spots on the skin, dilated pupils, and such severe local\r\ndisease that the teeth dropped out, and he expired six days after\r\nmercurial action set in.[921]\r\n\r\nAs the phenomena of mercurial salivation have been often known to lead\r\nto important evidence and much contrariety of opinion upon trials, it\r\nwill be necessary to dwell at some length on some parts of the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, then, the dose which is required to bring on\r\nsalivation may be noticed. It is needless to mention the ordinary\r\nquantity required in mercurial courses. A more useful object of\r\nconsideration is the departure from the ordinary rule. One of the most\r\ncommon and important of these deviations is excessive sensibility to the\r\naction of mercury, in consequence of which the individuals who have this\r\nidiosyncrasy may be profusely salivated by one or two small doses even\r\nof the mildest preparations. Three grains of corrosive sublimate divided\r\ninto three doses have caused violent ptyalism.[922] Fifteen grains of\r\nblue pill, taken in three doses, one every night, have excited fatal\r\nsalivation.[923] Nay, two grains of calomel have caused ptyalism,\r\nextensive ulceration of the throat, exfoliation of the lower jaw, and\r\ndeath.[924] Three drachms of mercurial ointment applied externally have\r\ncaused violent ptyalism and death in eight days. On the other hand, it\r\nis well known that some constitutions resist the action of mercurials\r\nvery obstinately, so as even sometimes to appear incapable of being\r\nsalivated at all. I have more than once met with cases of the last\r\ndescription, where mercurial courses had been continued for three months\r\nand upwards without avail. It may be added, that, except in\r\nconstitutions naturally predisposed to suffer from a few small doses, a\r\nfew large doses do not appear apt to excite severe salivation, or even\r\nto cause any at all. This has been clearly shown in the course of the\r\npractice lately introduced of administering calomel in doses of a\r\nscruple. On that subject more will be said by and by. At present I may\r\nmention, that, in conformity with the practice alluded to, I have\r\nseveral times, in various diseases, given eight or ten grains of calomel\r\nfive or six times a day for two or three days together, without\r\nobserving that ptyalism was apt to ensue.\r\n\r\nThe next point to be considered is, whether mercurial salivation can be\r\nconfounded with any other affection. In a very difficult case of\r\npoisoning which was tried here in 1817, that of William Patterson for\r\nmurdering his wife,[925] it appeared probable that he had given her\r\nrepeatedly large doses of calomel. But the proof of this was\r\ncircumstantial only, and an important circumstance in the chain of\r\nevidence was a deposition to the occurrence of salivation during the\r\nwoman’s illness. This fact, however, rested on the skill and testimony\r\nof a quack doctor only; and the admissibility of such a person to decide\r\non a point of this nature, will depend on the facility with which the\r\ntrue mercurial form of salivation can be recognised. This statement will\r\nshow the practical object of what is to follow.\r\n\r\nMany other causes may excite a preternatural flow of saliva. Several\r\nother poisons may have that effect, for example, preparations of gold,\r\npreparations of copper, antimony, croton-oil, and foxglove: foxglove has\r\nbeen known to cause violent salivation for three weeks.[926] Opium too\r\nhas occasionally excited salivation,[927] and also hydrocyanic acid and\r\niodide of potassium.\r\n\r\nEven a common sore throat, if the swelling and pain are so great as to\r\nrender swallowing very difficult and distressing, may be accompanied, as\r\nevery physician must have remarked, with a profuse flow of saliva; and\r\nin the ulcerative stage there is also often a fetor that is hardly\r\ndistinguishable from the mercurial kind. In the ulceration of the mouth\r\ncalled _cancrum oris_ there is some salivation with great fetor of the\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nSalivation likewise forms an idiopathic disease, and may then be both\r\nprofuse and obstinate. Mr. Davies has described a case of spontaneous\r\nptyalism which had lasted for a fortnight before he was called to see\r\nthe patient; and during all that time the quantity of saliva discharged\r\nwas two or three pints daily. How long it endured afterwards he does not\r\nmention; but it must have continued for some time, because during his\r\nattendance first one physician and then another were called into\r\nconsultation with him. Laxatives slowly removed it. Mr. Davies has not\r\ndescribed the state of the mouth; but the first physician mistook the\r\nsalivation for a mercurial one.[928] In the same journal which contains\r\nthis case another has been related which lasted four months.[929]\r\nAnother very remarkable case has been recorded by Mr. Power. The\r\npatient, a young lady, discharged for more than two years from sixteen\r\nto forty ounces of saliva daily. In the last two cases the mouth was not\r\naffected.[930] Two other instances have been related by M. Bayle, in one\r\nof which the patient was cured after spitting five pounds daily for nine\r\nyears and a half; while the other continued to be affected after\r\nspitting profusely for three years. In neither was there any ulceration\r\nof the mouth.[931] An instance has been related by an Italian physician,\r\nDr. Petrunti, where, in the course of various nervous affections of the\r\nhysteric character, the patient became affected with heat and tightness\r\nin the throat, and so profuse a salivation for two months, that between\r\nthree and four pounds were discharged daily.[932] A case somewhat\r\nsimilar is related in Rust’s Magazin of a man who suffered upwards of\r\ntwo years from a daily salivation alternating occasionally with a mucous\r\ndischarge from the bowels or lungs.[933] M. Guibourt describes the case\r\nof a lady who had an attack of profuse salivation every thirty, forty,\r\nor fifty days, lasting between twenty-four and forty-eight hours, and\r\nunaccompanied with any other affection of the mouth or adjoining parts\r\nexcept a sense of tightness in the throat.[934] M. Gorham relates an\r\ninteresting case of a lady who in three successive pregnancies was\r\nattacked soon after impregnation with excessive ptyalism, which\r\ncontinued to the extent of between two and four quarts daily until the\r\nperiod of quickening on two occasions, and on the third till her\r\ndelivery; but there was never any fetor or any affection of the\r\ngums.[935] I have likewise met with a singular case where spontaneous\r\nptyalism accompanied an ulcerated sore throat of the mercurio-syphilitic\r\nkind. The patient had taken mercury to salivation about six months\r\nbefore coming under my care, and got completely rid of both the sore\r\nthroat and salivation. But the sore throat returned, together with the\r\nsalivation, two months before I saw him, and the salivation continued\r\nfor two months longer to the extent of twenty or even thirty ounces\r\ndaily,—the ulcer of the throat during that interval being sometimes\r\nhealed up, and again returning as severely as ever. In three weeks more\r\nthe discharge rapidly diminished, and ceased. During all the time he was\r\nunder my care there was no fetor of the breath, and no redness,\r\nulceration, or sponginess of the gums. A singular account of an epidemic\r\nsalivation which occurred in connection with a continued tertian fever,\r\nhas been given in an inaugural dissertation contained in one of Haller’s\r\nCollections. The author, Quelmalz, says that the ptyalism sometimes\r\ncontinued for three weeks, that it was in one instance as great in\r\nextent as the most violent mercurial salivation, and that it was\r\naccompanied by fetor, superficial ulceration of the mouth, pustules on\r\nthe tongue, relaxation of the gums, and looseness of the teeth.[936]\r\n\r\nSalivation may likewise be produced by the influence of the imagination.\r\nI have seen a singular example of this. A woman who had a great aversion\r\nto calomel was taking it with digitalis for a dropsical complaint. Some\r\none having told her what she was using, she immediately began to\r\ncomplain of soreness of the mouth, salivated profusely, and even put on\r\nthe expression of countenance of a salivating person, although she had\r\ntaken only two grains. On being persuaded, however, that she had been\r\nmisinformed, the discharge ceased gradually in the course of one night.\r\nTwo days afterwards she was again told on good authority that calomel\r\nwas contained in her medicines, upon which the salivation began again\r\nand was profuse. It did not last above twenty-four hours; but the\r\nsymptoms during that period resembled a commencing mercurial salivation\r\nin every thing but the want of fetor and redness of the gums.\r\n\r\nIn general, mercurial salivation may be easily distinguished from all\r\nthe preceding varieties by an experienced practitioner. If its progress\r\nhas been traced from the first appearance of brassy taste and fetor to\r\nthe formation of ulcers and supervention of ptyalism, no attentive\r\nperson can run any risk of mistaking it. Its characters are also quite\r\ndistinct at the time salivation just begins. The fetor of the breath and\r\nsponginess and ulceration of the gums at this stage distinguish it from\r\nevery other affection. But if the state of the mouth is not examined\r\ntill the ulcers have existed several days, the characters of the\r\nmercurial disorder are much more equivocal. They cannot be\r\ndistinguished, for example, from some forms of idiopathic ulceration of\r\nthe mouth connected with unsoundness of the constitution, and\r\ncharacterized by extensive sloughing, ptyalism, and gangrenous\r\nfetor.[937] In particular they cannot be distinguished from the effects\r\nof the disease called _cancrum oris_. A few years ago indeed a London\r\nphysician was charged, in consequence of this resemblance, with having\r\nkilled, by mercurial salivation, a patient to whom it was proved that he\r\nhad not given a particle of mercury, and who clearly died of the disease\r\nin question;[938] and a similar case, where fatal mercurial salivation\r\nwas suspected, but which was clearly proved on a Coroner’s Inquest to\r\nhave been also a case of cancrum oris, has been more lately published by\r\nMr. Dunn.[939]\r\n\r\nFor distinguishing these and such other affections from mercurial\r\nsalivation Dr. Davidson of Glasgow has lately proposed a character, the\r\nexact scope of which cannot yet be appreciated,—namely, that in true\r\nmercurial salivation there is never any sulpho-cyanic acid in the\r\nsaliva; so that sesquichloride of iron does not render it red. The\r\npresence of sulpho-cyanic acid may possibly prove that salivation is not\r\nmercurial; but the converse does not hold good, because other causes\r\ntend to deprive human saliva of its sulpho-cyanic acid.[940]\r\n\r\nThe next point to be noticed regarding mercurial salivation is, that a\r\nlong interval may elapse after the administration of the mercury has\r\nbeen abandoned, before the effect on the salivary glands and mouth\r\nbegins,—mercury in small doses being what is called a cumulative poison,\r\nor a poison whose influence accumulates silently for some time in the\r\nbody before its symptoms break forth. Swédiaur has met with instances\r\nwhere the interval was several months,[941] Cullerier with a case in\r\nwhich it was three months.[942] It will at once be seen how strongly\r\nsuch facts may bear on the evidence in a criminal case, where the\r\nadministration of mercury in medicinal doses, which have been long\r\nabandoned, is brought forward to account for salivation, appearing weeks\r\nor months after, and giving rise, in conjunction with other\r\ncircumstances, to a suspicion of mercurial poisoning of more recent\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nAnother question which has been made the subject of discussion is the\r\nduration of mercurial ptyalism. The medical witness may be required to\r\ngive his opinion how long this affection may last after the\r\nadministration of mercury has been abandoned. The present question may\r\nbe cut short by stating, that there appears to be hardly any limit to\r\nits possible duration. Linnæus met with an instance of its continuing\r\ninveterately for a whole year;[943] Swédiaur says he has known persons\r\nlanguish for months and years from its effects;[944] and M. Colson knew\r\nan individual who had been salivated for six years.[945] These, however,\r\nare very rare incidents. After an ordinary mercurial course the mouth\r\nand salivary glands generally return to the healthy state in the course\r\nof a fortnight or three weeks.\r\n\r\nA fifth question, whether the ptyalism, or, speaking in general terms,\r\nthe erethysm of mercury, is susceptible of a complete intermission,\r\nformed a material subject of inquiry, and the cause of much\r\ncontradictory statement on a noted criminal trial, that of Miss\r\nButterfield in 1775 for the murder of her master, Mr. Scawen. She was\r\naccused of administering corrosive sublimate; and it was alleged in her\r\ndefence, that the salivation and consequent sloughing of which he died\r\nmight have arisen, without the fresh administration of mercury, from the\r\nrenewal of a previous ptyalism, which had been brought on by a common\r\nmercurial course, and had ceased two months before the second salivation\r\nbegan. It appeared that Mr. Scawen was salivated with a quack medicine\r\nfrom the beginning till the middle of April; and that about the middle\r\nof June he was again seized with violent salivation, of which he died.\r\nIt was rendered very improbable, that during the interval between the\r\ntwo salivations any more mercury had been taken medicinally. The\r\nquestion then was, whether the original ptyalism could have reappeared\r\nafter so long an interval, without the fresh administration of mercury?\r\nThe witnesses for the prosecution, gentlemen in extensive practice, said\r\nit could not. But one of the prisoner’s witnesses, Mr. Bloomfield of the\r\nLondon Lock Hospital, said he had repeatedly known salivation reappear\r\nafter a long intermission; that it was quite common for hospital\r\npatients to have a second salivation, when thought well enough to go out\r\nthe next dismissal day;[946] that in one case the interval was three\r\nmonths; and that one of his patients was attacked periodically with\r\nsalivation at intervals of six weeks or a month for a whole year. Mr.\r\nHoward, another surgeon of the Lock Hospital, deposed to the same\r\neffect; and the prisoner was acquitted, apparently upon their\r\nevidence.[947]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding what was said by these gentlemen, I believe the\r\nrecurrence of mercurial salivation after so long an interval, without\r\nthe repetition of mercury, is exceedingly rare. Dr. Gordon Smith, in\r\nalluding to the trial of Miss Butterfield, has mentioned a case which\r\noccurred to the late Dr. Hamilton of this University, and used to be\r\nrelated by him in his lectures. The interval was so great as four\r\nmonths.[948] Mr. Green of Bristol has lately described another\r\nunequivocal case, where the interval was six weeks.[949] Dr. Mead says\r\nhe met with an instance where the interval was six months;[950] and Dr.\r\nMale mentions another where mercury brought on moderate salivation in\r\nMarch, and after a long interval excited a fresh salivation in October,\r\nof which his patient died in a few weeks.[951] M. Louyer-Villermé met\r\nwith a case, where, in consequence of exposure to cold, a sudden attack\r\nof salivation was caused a twelvemonth after the removal of syphilis by\r\nmercury.[952] Some other cases not less wonderful have been recorded by\r\nM. Colson in his paper on the effects of mercury. He quotes Dr. Fordyce\r\nfor the case of a man who had repeated attacks of salivation, with\r\nmetallic taste, which lasted for three weeks, although mercury had not\r\nbeen taken for twelve years; and Colson himself knew a surgeon who had a\r\nregular and violent attack of all the symptoms of mercurialism eight\r\nyears after he had ceased to take mercury.[953] It is impossible to\r\nattach credit to such marvellous stories as the last two. Granting the\r\nptyalism to be really mercurial, it would require much better evidence\r\nthan any practitioner could procure, to determine the fact that mercury\r\nhad not been given again during the supposed interval. This objection\r\nindeed will apply more or less even to the instances where the alleged\r\ninterval did not exceed a few months.\r\n\r\nThe last point to be noticed regarding mercurial salivation is the\r\nmanner in which it proves fatal. Death may ensue from the mildest\r\npreparations, and from the smallest doses, in consequence of severe\r\nsalivation being produced by them in peculiar habits. Two instances have\r\nbeen already mentioned which illustrate both of these statements, and\r\nothers might easily be referred to were the fact not familiar.\r\n\r\nDeath may be owing to a variety of causes. Some of those which have been\r\nassigned are direct and unquestionable in their operation; others\r\nindirect and more doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe most direct and obvious manner is by extensive spreading gangrene of\r\nthe throat, mouth, face, and neck. The late happy changes, introduced\r\ninto the treatment of syphilis and other diseases which are benefited by\r\nmercury, render this mode of death rare in the present day. Yet I may\r\nmention that I have seen an example of it in a woman who was salivated\r\nto death, because her medical attendant, a firm believer in the powers\r\nof mercury as an antidote, forgot that the antidote is itself a poison,\r\nif not given in moderation. In general, when gangrene is the cause of\r\ndeath, it begins within the mouth or in the throat, and spreads from\r\nthat till it even reaches the face. But sometimes it begins at once on\r\nthe external surface, at a distance from the primary ulcers. An example\r\nof such a progress of the symptoms has been related by Dr. Grattan. A\r\nchild ten years old was violently salivated by twenty grains of calomel\r\ngiven in six days. On the fifth day of the salivation, a little vesicle\r\nappeared on the skin near the mouth on each side, and was the\r\ncommencement of a gangrenous ulcer, which spread over the whole cheek,\r\nand proved fatal eight days after its appearance.[954]\r\n\r\nAnother cause of death appears to be exhaustion from profuse and\r\nprotracted discharge of saliva, without material injury of the mouth or\r\nadjoining organs.\r\n\r\nA third manner of death which I have witnessed is exhaustion from\r\nlaryngeal phthisis; and from the circumstances of the case, I have\r\nlittle doubt but, in the state to which patients are then sometimes\r\nreduced, death may also take place suddenly from suffocation. My patient\r\nhad undergone before I saw him five long salivations for a venereal\r\ncomplaint, and had latterly been attacked with symptoms of ulceration of\r\nthe glottis. This affection went on slowly increasing, and he died of\r\nexhaustion after many weeks of suffering. During this period he was\r\nrepeatedly attacked with alarming fits of suffocation, which were\r\nrelieved by the hawking of mucous flakes. The symptoms were explained on\r\ndissection by the appearance of extensive ulceration and thickening of\r\nthe glottis, and almost total destruction of the epiglottis.\r\n\r\nThe other causes of death are more indirect, and will be mentioned\r\npresently. They depend on the pre-existence of other diseases, on which\r\nmercury acts deleteriously during the state of erethysm excited by it in\r\nthe constitution.\r\n\r\n_Of Mercurial Tremor._—The second division of the secondary effects of\r\nmercury comprehends the palsy or tremor, with the collateral disorders\r\ninduced in miners, gilders, and other workmen, whose trade exposes them\r\nto the operation of this poison. Under the present head, which might be\r\ntreated at considerable length as an important branch of medical police,\r\nI shall confine myself chiefly to an analysis of an interesting essay by\r\nMérat on the _Tremblement Metallique_, and to some remarks by Jussieu on\r\nthe health of the quicksilver miners of Almaden in Spain.\r\n\r\nMérat’s account of the shaking palsy induced by mercury is very\r\ninteresting.[955] The disease, he states, may sometimes begin suddenly;\r\nbut in general it makes its approaches by slow steps. The first symptom\r\nis unsteadiness of the arms, then quivering, finally tremors, the\r\nseveral movements of which become more and more extensive till they\r\nresemble convulsions, and render it difficult or impossible for the\r\npatient to walk, to speak, or even to chew. All voluntary motions, such\r\nas carrying a morsel to the mouth, are effected by several violent\r\nstarts. The arms are generally attacked first and also most severely. If\r\nthe man does not now quit work, loss of memory, sleeplessness, delirium,\r\nand death ensue. But as the nature of the disease soon renders working\r\nalmost impossible, he cannot well continue; and in that case death is\r\nrare. The concomitant symptoms of the trembling are a peculiar brown\r\ntint of the whole body, dry skin, flatus, but no colic, no disorder of\r\nrespiration, and, except in very old cases, no wasting or impaired\r\ndigestion. The pulse is almost always slow.—This description agrees with\r\na somewhat later account of the disease by Dr. Bateman, as he observed\r\nit in mirror-silverers;[956] and also with some interesting cases\r\nrecently published by Dr. Bright.[957]\r\n\r\nIn general the tremors are cured easily, though slowly, several months\r\nbeing commonly required. One of Dr. Bright’s patients got almost well in\r\nlittle more than a fortnight under the use of sulphate of zinc.\r\nSometimes, however, the trembling is incurable.[958] I have said the\r\ndisease is rarely fatal. Mérat quotes three cases only, in one of which\r\ndeath was owing to profuse salivation and gangrene, in the others to\r\nmarasmus. On the whole, those who are liable to the shaking palsy do not\r\nappear liable to salivation. Yet the two affections are sometimes\r\nconjoined, as in three of the cases described by Dr. Bright, and in some\r\nnoticed by Mr. Mitchell among the mirror-silverers of London.[959]\r\nGilders, miners, and barometer-makers are all subject to the disease.\r\nEven those who undergo mercurial frictions may have it, according to\r\nMérat; and M. Colson, who confirms this statement, quotes Swédiaur as\r\nanother authority for it.[960] It is not merely long-continued exposure\r\nto mercurial preparations that causes the shaking palsy: a single strong\r\nexposure may be sufficient; and the same exposure may cause tremor in\r\none and salivation in another. Professor Haidinger of Vienna some time\r\nago mentioned to me an accident a barometer-maker of his acquaintance\r\nmet with, which illustrates both of these statements. This man and one\r\nof his workmen were exposed one night during sleep to the vapours of\r\nmercury from a pot on a stove, in which a fire had been accidentally\r\nkindled. They were both most severely affected, the latter with\r\nsalivation, which caused the loss of all his teeth, the former with\r\nshaking palsy, which lasted his whole life.\r\n\r\nIn regard to all such workmen, it is exceedingly probable that with\r\nproper care the evils of their trade may be materially diminished. This\r\nappears at least to be the result of the observations made long ago by\r\nJussieu on the miners of Almaden in La Mancha. Most quicksilver mines\r\nare noted for great mortality among the workmen. But Jussieu maintains\r\nthat the trade is not by any means so necessarily or so dreadfully\r\nunhealthy as is represented, or as it really is in some places. The free\r\nworkmen at Almaden, he says, by taking care on leaving the mine to\r\nchange their whole dress, particularly their shoes, preserved their\r\nhealth, and lived as long as other people; but the poor slaves, who\r\ncould not afford a change of raiment, and who took their meals in the\r\nmine, generally without even washing their hands, were subject to\r\nswelling of the parotids, aphthous sore throat, salivation, pustular\r\neruptions, and tremors.[961]\r\n\r\n_Of the indirect effects of mercurial erethysm._—The last division of\r\nthe secondary effects of mercury relates to its indirect action when\r\nconcurring with other diseases or predispositions to disease.\r\n\r\nOf these effects there are some of which the poison appears to be the\r\nchief, if not even the sole cause. Thus, during the symptomatic fever\r\nwhich precedes salivation there are sometimes remarked imitative\r\ninflammations, or coma, or affections of the heart, which go off as\r\nsalivation is established.\r\n\r\nOther effects require the distinct co-operation of collateral causes.\r\nMany inflammatory diseases, not easily excited in ordinary\r\ncircumstances, arise readily from improper exposures during salivation,\r\nfor example dropsy, pneumonia, phrenitis, iritis, erysipelas, and\r\nvarious chronic eruptions.\r\n\r\nOther effects again require the co-operation of disease, such as\r\nsloughing gangrene supervening on ordinary ulcers during the action of\r\nmercury,—a not uncommon accident. This appears most likely to happen\r\nwhen the ulcers are constitutional.\r\n\r\nLastly, in conjunction with other diseased morbid actions, either going\r\non at the same time, or immediately preceding mercurial erethysm, this\r\npoison is apt to occasion some modifications of disease which are rarely\r\notherwise witnessed. Modifications of the kind have already been traced\r\nin the instances of lues venerea and scrofula; but there is reason to\r\nbelieve that the same singular property may also exist in relation to\r\nother constitutional disorders.\r\n\r\nThese observations conclude the inquiry into the symptoms caused in man\r\nby mercurial poisons generally. Returning now to its mode of action, we\r\nhave to examine its relative effects through the different animal\r\ntextures, and in its various chemical forms.\r\n\r\nThe result of the previous remarks as to its action on animals, it will\r\nbe remembered, was, that its soluble preparations cause when swallowed\r\ncorrosion of the stomach, and in whatever way it enters the body\r\nirritation of the stomach and rectum, inflammation of the lungs,\r\ndepressed action and perhaps inflammation of the heart, oppression of\r\nthe functions of the brain, and inflammation of the salivary glands. All\r\nof these effects have likewise been mentioned in the preceding sketch,\r\nas occurring in a greater or less degree in consequence of its operation\r\non man.\r\n\r\nMercury acts as a poison on man in whatever way it is introduced into\r\nthe body,—whether it be swallowed, or inhaled in the form of vapour, or\r\napplied to a wound, or even simply rubbed or placed on the sound skin.\r\nBut the kind of action excited differs according to the channel by which\r\nit is introduced.\r\n\r\nThe most ordinary and dangerous cases of poisoning arise from the\r\nintroduction of corrosive sublimate into the stomach. The poison then\r\nkills by corroding or inflaming the alimentary canal, or by causing\r\nsalivation and its concomitants.\r\n\r\nWhen applied to a wound or ulcer corrosive sublimate does not often\r\noccasion dangerous symptoms. Yet it is sometimes a hazardous remedy. It\r\nis not a convenient escharotic even in a concentrated state; for its\r\nescharotic action is not incompatible with its absorption; at all events\r\nit certainly sometimes acts constitutionally through the surface of\r\nwounds and ulcers, and the symptoms brought on in this way are generally\r\nviolent. They are the symptoms of mercurial salivation, accompanied at\r\ntimes with well-marked inflammation of the alimentary canal. When\r\napplied to sores in a diluted state it has also been known to cause\r\ndangerous effects if too long persevered in. A case of the kind has been\r\nrelated by Mr. Robertson, an army-surgeon. After anointing an itchy\r\neruption of the arms for seven days with a solution of corrosive\r\nsublimate containing five grains to the ounce, his patient was attacked\r\nwith fever, inflammation of the stomach and bowels, and in two days more\r\nwith violent salivation.[962] A case of the same nature has been related\r\nby Mr. Sutleffe.[963] His patient, a child, in consequence of having an\r\neruption of the head washed with a solution of corrosive sublimate, was\r\nattacked with violent salivation, which proved fatal in a few days.\r\nPibrac has recorded three fatal cases from the free application of\r\ncorrosive sublimate to ulcerated surfaces. One of these proved fatal in\r\nfive days, another in twenty-four hours, and a third during the night\r\nafter the poison was applied. The symptoms generally indicated violent\r\naction on the alimentary canal.[964] In an instance mentioned by Degner,\r\nfatal in twenty-five days, there was also violent irritation of the\r\nstomach; but the chief affection was excessive swelling of the face and\r\nthroat, together with profuse ptyalism.[965]\r\n\r\nOne of the readiest modes of bringing the system under the poisonous\r\naction of mercury is by introducing its preparations into the lungs. It\r\nappears from some experiments by Schlöpfer that the fluid preparations\r\nact rapidly through the lining membrane of the air-passages. Six grains\r\nof corrosive sublimate in solution will thus kill a rabbit in five\r\nminutes.[966] But the effects of mercury through this channel are much\r\nbetter exemplified when its preparations are inhaled in the form of\r\nvapour. Corrosive sublimate when incautiously sublimed in chemical\r\nexperiments has been known to cause serious effects. Dr. Coldstream of\r\nLeith informs me, that while subliming about twenty-four grains of it\r\nwith the blowpipe when a student, he and several of his\r\nfellow-apprentices were seized with painful constriction of the throat,\r\nseveral had headache, and one had sickness and vomiting. The phenomena\r\nproduced by the various preparations of mercury in more violent cases,\r\nare sometimes protracted tremors,[967] sometimes severe ptyalism and\r\ntedious dysentery,[968] sometimes salivation and gangrene of the mouth\r\nending fatally.[969] This last form was produced remarkably in a\r\nchimney-sweeper, after cleaning a gilder’s chimney, during which\r\noperation he felt a disagreeable sense of tightness in the throat.\r\n\r\nSeveral extraordinary instances have happened of poisoning from\r\nlong-continued inhalation of the vapours which arise from metallic\r\nmercury. That vapours do arise from metallic mercury of the ordinary\r\ntemperature of the atmosphere has been fully proved by Mr. Faraday; who\r\nfound, that when a bit of gold was suspended from the top of a phial,\r\nthe bottom being covered with a little mercury, the gold soon became\r\namalgamated.[970] The vapours thus discharged may produce the worst\r\nspecies of mercurialism, if they are diffused through an apartment\r\ninsufficiently ventilated. One of the most striking examples known of\r\nthe baneful effects of mercury thus gradually insinuated into the\r\nsystem, occurred in a well-known accident which befel the ships Triumph\r\nand Phipps. These vessels were carrying home in 1810 a large quantity of\r\nquicksilver saved from the wreck of a ship near Cadiz, when by some\r\naccident several of the bags were burst and the mercury spilled. On the\r\nvoyage home the whole crews of both vessels were more or less severely\r\nsalivated, two died, many were dangerously ill, all the copper articles\r\non board became amalgamated, all the rats, mice, cockroaches, and other\r\ninsects, as well as a canary-bird and several fowls, and all larger\r\nanimals, such as cats, dogs, goats, and sheep were destroyed.[971]\r\n\r\nThe action of mercury is often violently excited when it is applied to\r\nthe skin even not deprived of the cuticle. The effects of mercurial\r\ninunction form a well-known and satisfactory proof of this. Even without\r\nthe aid of infriction, the soluble preparations of mercury will excite\r\nmercurial action by being put simply in contact with the skin. Thus it\r\nhas been shown by a German physician, Dr. Guérard, that ptyalism may be\r\ninduced by a warm bath of corrosive sublimate in the proportion of an\r\nounce to 48 quarts of water, and that the effect commonly begins after\r\nthe third bath with an interval of three days between them.[972] It is\r\nnot so generally known that the more active preparations, such as\r\ncorrosive sublimate or nitrate of mercury, may, like arsenic, cause\r\nthrough the sound skin effects almost as violent as through the\r\nalimentary canal. The following pointed illustration is related by Dr.\r\nAnderson. A gentleman affected with rheumatism, was persuaded by a\r\nfriend to use a nostrum, which was nothing else than a solution of half\r\na drachm of corrosive sublimate in an ounce of rum. This was rubbed on\r\nthe affected part for several minutes before going to bed. Ere the\r\nfriction was ended, he felt a sensation of heat in the part, to which,\r\nhowever, he paid little attention. But during the night he was attacked\r\nwith pain in the stomach, sickness, and vomiting, and soon after with\r\npurging and tenesmus. In the morning Dr. Anderson found him very weak\r\nand vomiting incessantly. The arm up to the shoulder was prodigiously\r\nswelled, red, and blistered. Next day he complained of brassy taste and\r\ntenderness of the gums, and regular salivation soon succeeded.[973]\r\nAnother case of much interest has been described by my colleague,\r\nProfessor Syme, where a solution of the nitrate was rubbed by mistake\r\nupon the hip and thigh instead of camphorated oil. Intense pain\r\nimmediately followed, and afterwards shivering; the urine was suppressed\r\nfor five days, without any insensibility, and during its suppression\r\nurea was detected in the blood; ptyalism appeared on the third day,\r\nbecame very profuse, and was followed by exfoliation of the alveolar\r\nportion of the lower jaw, but recovery nevertheless slowly took\r\nplace.[974]\r\n\r\nThe mere carrying of mercurial preparations for a length of time near\r\nthe skin, though not in direct contact with it, may be sufficient to\r\ninduce the peculiar effects of the poison, as the following example will\r\nshow. A man applied to a German physician, Dr. Scheel, affected with\r\nviolent salivation evidently mercurial which proved fatal, but which it\r\nwas impossible to trace to its real cause till after death, when a\r\nlittle leathern bag containing a few drachms of mercury was found\r\nhanging at his breast; and it was then discovered that he had been in\r\nthe practice of carrying this bag for six years as a protection against\r\nitch and vermin, and during that period had frequent occasion to renew\r\nthe mercury.[975]\r\n\r\nThe effects of mercury as a poison differ with the chemical form in\r\nwhich it is introduced into the system.\r\n\r\nIn its metallic state it is probably inactive. This fact is a material\r\none for the medical jurist to determine precisely; for running\r\nquicksilver has been given with a criminal intent. A case of the kind\r\nforms the subject of a medico-legal report in Pyl’s Repertory;[976] and\r\nanother is mentioned in Klein’s Annals.[977]\r\n\r\nIt is well ascertained that large quantities of fluid mercury have been\r\nrepeatedly swallowed, without any injury or peculiar effect having\r\nfollowed. In neither of the German cases now referred to was any bad\r\neffect produced; and it has proved equally harmless when given\r\nmedicinally to remove obstruction in the intestines. Farther, M. Gaspard\r\nmentions in his paper quoted in a former page, that he has left large\r\nquantities shut up for many hours in the various cavities of the body in\r\nanimals, without observing any other result than at times inflammation,\r\nwhich was evidently owing to the mere presence of a foreign body, and\r\nnot to the action of an irritant poison.[978]\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated, however, that the vapours of metallic\r\nmercury, even at the temperature of the air, produce mercurialism when\r\ninhaled. But then, in all likelihood, some of the metal is oxidated\r\nbefore being inhaled. At least the chemist knows that the surface of a\r\nmercurial trough soon tarnishes, especially when the mercury is not\r\npure.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said that the blue ointment, which is made with running\r\nquicksilver, will not act as a mercurial when rubbed upon the skin. Here\r\ntoo, however, some oxidation takes place in the making of the ointment.\r\nMr. Donovan endeavoured to prove that some of the mercury is always\r\noxidated;[979] and I have generally found a sufficient quantity of oxide\r\nto account for the effects.[980]\r\n\r\nIt has been farther said, in proof of the poisonous action of\r\nquicksilver in its metallic state,—that patients, who have taken it for\r\nobstructed bowels, have sometimes been salivated. This accident has, I\r\nbelieve, happened in a few instances where the mercury was retained long\r\nin the body. But such cases are undoubtedly very rare. Zwinger mentions\r\nthe case of a man, who took four ounces for colic, and was seized in\r\nseven days with salivation.[981] Laborde relates the particulars of\r\nanother instance where seven ounces taken in fourteen days excited\r\nptyalism, ulceration of the mouth, and great feebleness of the\r\nlimbs.[982] In the days of Dr. Dover, when the administration of large\r\ndoses of fluid mercury was a fashionable practice for a variety of\r\npurposes, it was alleged to have even sometimes proved fatal; and the\r\ncase of an actor is specially mentioned, to whom, when convalescent from\r\nague, Dover gave mercury to the amount of two pounds in five days, and\r\nwho at the close of that period was seized with headache, colic,\r\nrestlessness, and costiveness, proving fatal in two days; and the whole\r\nlower intestines were found black and lined with minute metallic\r\nglobules.[983] Perhaps then it must be admitted that fluid mercury is\r\nnot altogether inactive, speaking medicolegally. But this admission is\r\nno argument in favour of the metal being physiologically a poison;\r\nbecause in the course of the cases referred to, a part is in all\r\nlikelihood oxidated by the oxygen in the intestinal gases. It is said to\r\nhave been taken in the dose of an ounce daily for nine months, without\r\neither good or harm resulting.[984]\r\n\r\nThe question regarding the poisonous qualities of running quicksilver\r\nwas carefully investigated some years ago by the Berlin College of\r\nPhysicians in a report on the case in Pyl’s Repertory.[985] They observe\r\nthat the opinion of Pliny, Galen, Hippocrates, Dioscorides, and many of\r\nthe earlier moderns, including even Zacchias, had led to the popular\r\nbelief in the deadly properties of fluid mercury; but that this belief\r\nis erroneous; for many surgeons, and among the rest Ambrose Paré, had\r\ngiven without injury to their patients several pounds of it to cure\r\nobstructed bowels; and in 1515 the Margrave of Brandenburg, over-heated\r\non his marriage night with love and wine, and rising to quench his\r\nthirst, drank by mistake a large draught of quicksilver without\r\nsuffering any harm. Fallopius mentions that he had known instances of\r\nwomen swallowing pounds of mercury, for the purpose of procuring\r\nmiscarriage, and who did not suffer any injury.[986]\r\n\r\nThe sulphurets of mercury, like the metal, are not possessed of any\r\ndeleterious action on the animal body. Orfila found that half an ounce\r\nof the sulphuret, formed in a solution of corrosive sublimate by\r\nsulphuretted-hydrogen, and half an ounce or six drachms of cinnabar, had\r\nno effect whatever on dogs.[987] The sulphurets which have appeared\r\ninjurious in the hands of Smith[988] and other previous experimentalists\r\nmust therefore have been impure.\r\n\r\nOf the compounds of mercury, the red-precipitate and Turbith-mineral act\r\nas irritants, besides possessing the property common to all mercurial\r\ncompounds, of causing mercurial erethysm. But they are not escharotics,\r\nthough generally termed such. That is, they do not chemically corrode\r\nthe animal textures. The effects of red-precipitate have been variable.\r\nMr. Allison relates the case of a girl who in a fit of jealousy\r\nswallowed thirty grains of it. Being immediately detected, an emetic was\r\ngiven, which operated freely, and subsequently the stomach-pump was\r\nused; but on neither occasion was any red powder brought away. She was\r\nattacked with burning pain in the stomach, which was removed by opium,\r\nand for a week she had a distaste for food, but no other symptom of\r\nconsequence.[989] Mr. Brett has described a case, in which the symptoms\r\nwere occasional vomiting, stupor, languid pulse, cold clamminess of the\r\nskin, afterwards severe cramps of the legs, tenderness of the abdomen,\r\ndysuria, and some purging, and on the third day ptyalism; but the\r\npatient recovered.[990] M. Devergie has given a case somewhat similar,\r\nbut without any ptyalism having followed the irritant effects of the\r\npoison.[991] In 1840 I was consulted on the part of the Crown in the\r\ncase of a girl, who, there was every reason to suppose, had been killed\r\nin twelve hours by red-precipitate. The symptoms towards the close were\r\npain in the throat, inability to swallow, vomiting, and excessive\r\nprostration; extensive red patches were found on the villous coat of the\r\nstomach after death; and I detected mercury in the solid contents and\r\nlikewise in the inner coat of the stomach. The case did not go to trial,\r\nbecause, although a man by whom she was pregnant came under some\r\nsuspicion, it rather appeared that the deceased had herself swallowed\r\nthe poison with the view of inducing miscarriage. Dr. Sobernheim has\r\ngiven the particulars of the case of a young man who died from\r\nswallowing an ounce of red-precipitate. He suffered for some hours from\r\nvomiting, diarrhœa, pain in the stomach, tenderness of the belly, and\r\ncolic; next day he had no pain, but coldness, lividity, stiffness, and\r\nan imperceptible pulse; and he expired in thirty-three hours. The poison\r\nwas found abundantly in the stomach and duodenum after death, and some\r\ngrains of it rested upon little ulcers.[992] As to Turbith-mineral, two\r\nscruples will kill a cat in four hours and a half; and several instances\r\nof violent and even fatal poisoning with it are mentioned by the older\r\nmodern authors.[993]\r\n\r\nThe white precipitate or chloride of mercury and ammonia is probably\r\nalso irritant, though inferior in power to the preparations just\r\nmentioned. Two scruples given to a dog occasion vomiting, pain, and some\r\ndiarrhœa; and cases are recorded of death in the human subject from less\r\ndoses.[994] But there are no recent facts as to the activity of this\r\ncompound, and the older cases, which would assign to it very great\r\nenergy, are open to the objection that this preparation was in former\r\ntimes often impure.\r\n\r\nThe bichloride or corrosive sublimate is a powerful corrosive or\r\nirritant, according to the dose and state of concentration; and it also\r\nexcites mercurial erethysm in a violent degree. The nitrates too are\r\ncorrosive, and not inferior in activity to the bichloride, as may be\r\ninferred from Dr. Bigsby’s case, noticed at page 314.\r\n\r\nThe bicyanide or prussiate of mercury, from the researches of Ollivier,\r\nand an interesting case he has published of poisoning with it in the\r\nhuman subject, appears to resemble corrosive sublimate closely in all\r\nits effects, except that it does not corrode chemically. Twenty-three\r\ngrains and a half proved fatal in nine days.[995] M. Thibert has\r\ndescribed a case in which ten grains caused death in the same period of\r\ntime.[996] The symptoms in both instances were those of severe\r\nirritation of the stomach, extensive inflammation of the organs in the\r\nmouth, and suppression of urine; and in Thibert’s case a small quantity\r\nof albuminous fluid was discharged from the bladder instead of urine.\r\n\r\nThe protochloride or calomel, and probably also the protoxide, are the\r\nmost manageable of the preparations of mercury for inducing ptyalism.\r\nCalomel is also an irritant; that is, it causes irritation and\r\ninflammation in the alimentary canal when swallowed. This part of its\r\nproperties as a poison will require a word or two of explanation.\r\n\r\nCalomel is universally employed as a laxative, but to secure this effect\r\nbeing produced it is commonly combined with other purgatives. When given\r\nalone a few grains will in some constitutions induce a violent\r\nhypercatharsis; and larger, but still moderate, doses have with most\r\npeople such a tendency to cause severe griping and diarrhœa as to have\r\nled to the practice of combining it with opium when the object is to\r\nsalivate. These considerations clearly establish that calomel, in a\r\nmoderate dose of five or ten grains, is an irritant.\r\n\r\nIt farther appears that in larger doses it is said to have occasionally\r\nproduced very violent effects, nay, even death itself, by its irritant\r\noperation. Hoffmann has mentioned two instances where fifteen grains of\r\ncalomel proved fatal to boys between the ages of twelve and fifteen. One\r\nof them had vomiting, tremors of the hands and feet, restlessness and\r\nanxiety, and died on the sixth day. The other, he merely mentions, died\r\nafter suffering from extreme anxiety and black vomiting.[997] Another\r\nfatal case has been related by Ledelius in the German Ephemerides, which\r\nwas caused by a dose of half an ounce taken accidentally. Vomiting soon\r\nensued, and a sense of acridity in the throat; then profuse diarrhœa to\r\nthe extent of twenty evacuations in the day; next excessive prostration\r\nof strength and torpor of the external senses; and death followed in\r\nlittle more than twenty-four hours.[998] Wibmer quotes Vigetius, an\r\nauthor of the beginning of last century, for a similar case, likewise\r\nfatal, which was occasioned by half an ounce,—also Hellweg, a writer of\r\nthe previous century, for the case of a physician, who took an ordinary\r\nmedicinal dose by way of experiment, and died in five hours under all\r\nthe symptoms of violent irritant poisoning.[999]\r\n\r\nThese observations being kept in view, what explanation will the\r\ntoxicologist give of the effects which in modern times have been\r\nascribed to large doses of calomel? It was stated not many years ago by\r\nseveral East India surgeons, apparently with the universal assent of\r\ntheir brethren in later times, that this drug in the dose of a scruple\r\nadministered even several times a day, is not only not an irritant, but\r\neven on the contrary a sedative;[1000] and that in some diseases, for\r\nexample yellow fever, it has been given in the dose of five, ten, or\r\ntwenty grains, four or six times a day, till several hundred grains were\r\naccumulated in the body, yet without causing hypercatharsis, nay, with\r\nthe effect of checking the irritation which gives rise to black vomit in\r\nyellow fever, and to the vomiting and diarrhœa observed in the cholera\r\nof the East. It is quite impossible for a European physician to doubt\r\nthese statements; for all practitioners in hot climates concur in them,\r\nand now that analogous practices have been transferred to Britain,\r\nrepeated opportunities have occurred for establishing the fidelity of\r\nthe original reporters. Some American physicians, advancing beyond the\r\nHindostan treatment, have since given calomel in bilious fever in the\r\ndose of forty grains, one drachm, two drachms, and even three drachms,\r\nrepeatedly in the course of twenty-four hours for several days\r\ntogether,—and with similar phenomena. In one instance 840 grains were\r\ngiven in the course of eight days in these enormous doses. The largest\r\ndose was three drachms; and it was followed by only one copious\r\nevacuation, and that not till after the use of an injection.[1001] This\r\npractice appears not to have been altogether unknown in former times.\r\nLedelius, the author formerly quoted, states, that he had been\r\naccustomed to give doses of a scruple, and that Zwölffer even gave a\r\ndrachm in one dose.[1002]\r\n\r\nIt must be also added, that while the facts quoted above from Hoffmann,\r\nLedelius, and others assign to single large doses a powerful and\r\ndangerous irritant action, very different results have been occasionally\r\nobserved in recent times where even so large a quantity as one or two\r\nounces had been taken. Thus, in the case of a lady mentioned by Wibmer,\r\nwho took by mistake the enormous quantity of fourteen drachms, although\r\nacute pain in the belly ensued, together with vomiting and purging,\r\nthese symptoms were speedily subdued by oleaginous demulcents; and after\r\na smart salivation, she recovered entirely in six weeks.[1003] Another\r\ncase has been related by Mr. H. P. Robarts, where an ounce was swallowed\r\nby a young lady by mistake for magnesia, with no other effect than\r\nnausea at first, rather severe griping and slight tenderness of the\r\nbelly afterwards, and subsequently languor, headache and indigestion;\r\nyet the powder was retained two hours.[1004]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in the present place to enter into the physiological\r\naction of calomel as a remedy; but every one must be satisfied that,\r\nwith all which has been already written, much still remains to be done\r\nbefore the facts now mentioned can be explained satisfactorily. Can the\r\nviolent effects described by Hoffmann, Ledelius and Hellweg have arisen\r\nfrom the calomel having been imperfectly prepared and adulterated with a\r\nlittle corrosive sublimate? Or may they be explained by reference to the\r\nfact, that the presence of hydrochlorates in solution, particularly\r\nhydrochlorate of ammonia, tends to convert calomel into corrosive\r\nsublimate.[1005] Mr. Alfred Taylor has made some experiments, to show\r\nthat the latter explanation will not suffice.[1006]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, taking the facts as they stand, it is plain that great\r\ncaution must be used in ascribing violent irritant properties generally,\r\nor even symptoms of irritant poisoning in a particular case, to large\r\ndoses of calomel.\r\n\r\nWith the view of illustrating the importance of the preceding\r\nobservations, it may be useful to mention here the heads of a case\r\nalready briefly alluded to for another purpose, the trial of William\r\nPaterson for murder (319).[1007] His wife during the month previous to\r\nher death had two attacks of diarrhœa, with an interval of a fortnight\r\nbetween them. On the second occasion it became profuse and exhausting,\r\nbut without any material pain or considerable vomiting; looseness of the\r\nteeth and salivation ensued, and she died in nine days. On examination\r\nof the body, the anus was found excoriated, the whole intestines\r\ncheckered with dark patches, and the stomach red, ulcerated, and spotted\r\nwith black, warty excrescences; but the late Dr. Cleghorn of Glasgow\r\ncould not detect any poison by chemical analysis. It was proved that the\r\nprisoner, besides procuring, a few months before his wife’s death, a\r\nvariety of poisons, such as hydrochloric acid, cantharides, and arsenic,\r\nhad also on different occasions during her last illness purchased in a\r\nsuspicious manner four doses of calomel varying from 30 to 60 grains\r\neach. Among the various ways in which he was charged with having\r\npoisoned the deceased, that which was best borne out by the general as\r\nwell as medical facts consisted in his taking advantage of an existing\r\ninflammation of the mucous membrane of the bowels,—whether arising from\r\na natural cause or from poison it was in this view of the case\r\nimmaterial to inquire,—and keeping up and aggravating the inflammation\r\nby purposely administering at intervals large doses of calomel. On the\r\ntrial Dr. Cleghorn and other witnesses gave their opinion that the doses\r\npurchased by the prisoner, if administered, would cause the symptoms and\r\nmorbid appearances observed in the case. On the other hand, the late Dr.\r\nGordon deposed to the effect, that all the symptoms of the case might\r\narise under the operation of natural disease, and that such doses of\r\ncalomel were by no means necessarily injurious; the late Mr. John Bell\r\ndeposed, that it had even been given in much larger doses without\r\ninjury; and the profession are now well aware, though not at the time of\r\nthis trial, that in the very malady alleged by the prisoner to have\r\ncarried off the deceased, namely dysentery, the administration of\r\ncalomel in repeated large doses is accounted by many a proper method of\r\ncure. The doses purchased by the prisoner were considerably larger, it\r\nis true. But there was not any evidence of his having administered his\r\npurchases in single doses as he got them; and even though there had been\r\nevidence to that effect, it would not remove altogether the difficulty\r\nof deciding the question, as to the irritating action of calomel, on\r\nwhich the issue of the trial in one view of the case chiefly depended.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that all the compounds formed by corrosive sublimate with\r\nanimal and vegetable substances are feebly poisonous, or at least very\r\nmuch inferior in activity to corrosive sublimate itself. This has been\r\nshown by Orfila to be the case with the compound formed by albumen.\r\nSixty grains of this compound, being equivalent to nearly five grains of\r\ncorrosive sublimate, produced no bad effect whatever on a dog or a\r\nrabbit.[1008] The same has been satisfactorily proved by Taddei as to\r\nthe compound formed by gluten. Twelve grains of corrosive sublimate\r\ndecomposed by his emulsion of gluten had no effect whatever on a\r\ndog.[1009] It is important to remark, however, that if there be an\r\nexcess of the decomposing principle, so that the precipitate is party\r\nredissolved, the irritant action of the corrosive sublimate is not so\r\nmuch reduced, though it is still certainly diminished. Orfila has\r\nsettled this point in regard to albumen.[1010] The power of producing\r\nmercurial erethysm is possessed by all mercurial compounds whatever, and\r\namong the rest by the compounds now under consideration.[1011]\r\n\r\nThe present section may now be concluded with a few remarks on the\r\nstrength of the evidence derived from the symptoms which are produced by\r\nthe compounds of mercury.\r\n\r\nIf the medical jurist should meet with a case of sudden death like that\r\nof the animals experimented on by Sir B. Brodie, the symptoms alone\r\ncould not constitute any evidence of poisoning with corrosive sublimate.\r\nAll he could say would be that this variety of poisoning was possible,\r\nbut that various natural diseases might have the same effect. This\r\nfeebleness in the evidence from symptoms, however, is of little moment;\r\nbecause the dose must be great to cause such symptoms, and little can be\r\nvomited before death; so that the poison will be certainly found in the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nShould the patient die under symptoms of general irritation in the\r\nalimentary canal, poisoning may be suspected. But it would be impossible\r\nto derive from them more than presumptive evidence. The suspicion must\r\nbecome strong, however, if the ordinary signs of irritation in the\r\nalimentary canal are attended with the discharge of blood upwards and\r\ndownwards. And the presumption will, I apprehend, approach very near to\r\ncertainty,—at least of the administration of some active irritant\r\npoison,—if, at the moment of swallowing a suspected article, and but a\r\nshort time before the symptoms of irritation began in the stomach and\r\nbowels, the patient should have remarked a strong, acrid, metallic\r\ntaste, and constriction or burning in the throat.\r\n\r\nWhen upon all these symptoms salivation is superinduced, the evidence of\r\npoisoning with corrosive sublimate or some other soluble salt of mercury\r\nis almost unequivocal. That is, if, after something has been taken which\r\ntasted acrid, and caused an immediate sense of heat, pricking, or\r\ntightness in the throat, the characteristic signs of poisoning with the\r\nirritants make their appearance in the usual time, and are soon after\r\naccompanied or followed by true mercurial salivation,—it may be safely\r\ninferred that some soluble compound of mercury has been taken. Before\r\ndrawing this inference, however, it will be necessary to determine with\r\nprecision all the classes of symptoms, more particularly the nature of\r\nthe salivation. It should also be remembered that salivation may\r\naccompany or follow the symptoms of inflammation in the stomach, in\r\nconsequence of calomel having been used as a remedy. But if proper\r\nattention be paid to the fallacies in the way of judgment, I conceive\r\nthat an opinion on the question of poisoning with corrosive sublimate\r\nmay be sometimes rested on the symptoms alone. This is another exception\r\nto the rule laid down by most modern toxicologists and medical jurists\r\nrespecting the validity of the evidence of poisoning from symptoms.\r\n\r\nFor a good example of the practical application of these precepts, the\r\nreader may consult the trial of Mr. Hodgson, for attempting to poison\r\nhis wife. In the instance which gave rise to the trial in question, a\r\nviolent burning sensation in the throat was felt during the act of\r\nswallowing some pills; in the course of ten minutes violent vomiting\r\nensued, afterwards severe burning pain along the whole course of the\r\ngullet down to the stomach, next morning diarrhœa, and on the third day\r\nptyalism. There were many other points of medical evidence which left no\r\ndoubt that corrosive sublimate was swallowed in the pills. But even the\r\nhistory of the symptoms alone would have led to that inference.[1012]\r\n\r\n\r\n      SECTION III.—_Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Mercury._\r\n\r\nThe morbid appearances observed in the bodies of persons killed by\r\ncorrosive sublimate will not require many details; since most of the\r\nremarks formerly made under the head of the pathology of the irritants\r\ngenerally, and of arsenic in particular, apply with equal force to the\r\npresent species of poisoning. Still there are some peculiarities\r\ndeserving of notice, which arise from the greater solubility or stronger\r\nirritant action of corrosive sublimate.\r\n\r\nThe mouth and throat are more frequently affected than by arsenic; and a\r\nremarkable appearance sometimes observed, and not excited, so far as I\r\nknow, by arsenic, is shrivelling of the tongue, with great enlargement\r\nof the papillæ at its root.[1013]\r\n\r\nThe disorder of the alimentary canal is also usually more general, and\r\nreaches a greater height before death takes place. Sometimes the\r\nirritation and organic injury are confined to the stomach;[1014] but\r\nmore commonly the throat, stomach, gullet, rectum, nay, even also the\r\ncolon, are affected. The black or melanotic extravasation into the\r\nmucous membrane of the stomach, which has been already several times\r\ndescribed as a common effect of the more violent irritants, is also\r\nproduced by corrosive sublimate. In Devergie’s case and in that of Dr.\r\nVenables it was present in a very great degree.[1015]\r\n\r\nThe coats of the stomach, and also those of the intestines, more\r\nparticularly the colon and rectum, have frequently been found destroyed.\r\nSo far as I have been able to ascertain, two kinds of destruction of the\r\ncoats may be met with,—corrosion and ulceration.\r\n\r\nThe first is the result of chemical decomposition of the tissues. This\r\nkind is evidently to be looked for only when the quantity has been\r\nconsiderable and the dose concentrated. Nay even then it is rare. For on\r\naccount of the solubility of corrosive sublimate, the facility with\r\nwhich it is decomposed by the secretions or accidental contents of the\r\nstomach, and the violence and frequency of the vomiting, this poison is\r\npeculiarly liable to be prevented from exerting its corrosive action on\r\nthe membranes. Hence it is that proper chemical corrosion of the coats\r\nof the stomach is seldom witnessed in man.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this corrosion differs according to the rapidity of\r\nthe poisoning. In very rapid cases, for example in animals which have\r\nsurvived only twenty-five minutes, the villous coat has a dark gray\r\nappearance, without any sign of vital reaction.[1016] But this variety\r\nhas never been witnessed in man, in whom the action has been hitherto\r\nmuch less rapid. In the most rapid cases, such as that of Dr. Bigsby,\r\nwhich terminated in two hours and a half (314), or those related by Mr.\r\nValentine, of which one ended fatally in eleven and another in\r\ntwenty-four hours, the corrosion was black, like the charring of\r\n“leather with a red-hot coal, and the rest of the stomach scarlet-red or\r\ndeep rose-red;—showing that inflammation had set in.” In the former of\r\nthese two cases the corrosion was as big as a half-crown, in the latter\r\nthree inches in diameter. In a third case, where the patient lived\r\nthirty-one hours, the stomach was perforated.[1017] In the case\r\ndescribed by Dr. Venables, and formerly alluded to, where life was\r\nprolonged for eight days, there was a patch on the under surface of the\r\nstomach as large as two crown-pieces, hard, elevated, and of a very dark\r\nolive or almost black colour, besides very general erosion of the\r\nvillous coat.[1018] In all these cases the disintegrated spot was\r\nprobably situated where the poison first chiefly lodged.\r\n\r\nThe corrosion caused by mercury, if examined before the slough is thrown\r\noff, will be found to possess an important peculiarity: the disorganized\r\ntissue yields mercury by chemical analysis. Professor Taddei repeatedly\r\nobtained the metal from the membranes of animals which he had poisoned\r\nwith corrosive sublimate.[1019] It is probable that mercury may be thus\r\ndetected although death may not have taken place for some time after the\r\npoison was swallowed. For the slough was found adhering in one of Mr.\r\nValentine’s cases, where life was prolonged for seventy hours; and it\r\nwas not entirely removed even in eight days in one of the cases\r\ndescribed by Dr. Venables.\r\n\r\nAlthough, however, it is sometimes possible to find the poison in the\r\nstomach, the medical jurist must not perhaps expect to find it so often\r\nin the present instance as in that of poisoning with arsenic. For on\r\naccount of its greater solubility corrosive sublimate cannot adhere with\r\nsuch obstinacy to the villous coat, and is therefore more subject to be\r\ndischarged by vomiting. Nevertheless, the insoluble compound formed by\r\nantidotes may adhere to the coats like arsenic, and so resist the\r\ntendency of vomiting to displace them. In Devergie’s case,\r\nnotwithstanding twenty-three hours of incessant vomiting, although no\r\npoison could be detected in the fluid contents of the stomach, it was\r\ndistinctly found in small whitish masses that lay between the folds of\r\nthe rugæ.[1020]\r\n\r\nIt may be here farther observed that corrosive sublimate, as well as\r\nother salts of mercury, may undergo in the alimentary canal after death\r\nthe same change which is produced in arsenic from the gradual action of\r\nhydrosulphuric acid gas. It may be converted into the sulphuret. I am\r\nnot acquainted indeed with any actual instance of such conversion; but\r\nthat it may occur we can scarcely doubt, not merely from theoretical\r\nconsiderations, but likewise because Orfila met with an instance where\r\ncalomel taken daily in a case of gastro-cephalitis was discharged by\r\nstool in the form of a black sulphuret.[1021]\r\n\r\nAnother important consideration is, that corrosive sublimate may be\r\ndecomposed and reduced to the metallic state by the admixture of various\r\nsubstances either given at the same time or subsequently, and the longer\r\nthe inspection is delayed, the more complete will be the decomposition\r\nwhich is accomplished. Iron, zinc, and other metals are the most active\r\nof these substances.[1022]\r\n\r\nThe other forms of destruction of the coats of the alimentary canal is\r\ncommon ulceration, either such from the beginning, or what was\r\noriginally corrosion converted into an ulcer in consequence of the\r\ndisorganized spot being thrown off by sloughing.\r\n\r\nI have seen this appearance to an enormous extent in the great\r\nintestines of a man who survived nine days. Numerous large, black,\r\ngangrenous ulcers, just like those observed in bad cases of dysentery,\r\nwere scattered over the whole colon and rectum. In this instance, which\r\noccurred to the late Dr. Shortt, the stomach was also ulcerated, but the\r\nsmall intestines were not.\r\n\r\nSometimes the ulceration seems to be a variety of softening of the\r\nmucous tissue, as in a case described by Dr. Alexander Wood of this\r\ncity, which proved fatal in fourteen days, and in which the stomach,\r\ncæcum, and ascending colon presented round, softened, greenish spots\r\nabout the size of a sixpence, and accompanied in the stomach with a\r\ntendency to detaching of the membrane in the form of a slough.[1023]\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the villous coat of the stomach occasioned by\r\ncorrosive sublimate and other soluble salts of mercury may be\r\ndistinguished from spontaneous gelatinization by one of two characters.\r\nIf the slough remains attached, mercury will be detected in it: if\r\nseparation has taken place, the ulcer exposed presents surrounding\r\nredness and other signs of reaction.[1024]\r\n\r\nAll the other effects of inflammation may be produced by corrosive\r\nsublimate, as by arsenic and other irritants. More frequently here than\r\nin the case of arsenic peritonæal inflammation is met with. In\r\nDevergie’s case the external surface of the stomach along both its\r\ncurvatures presented the appearance of red points on a violet ground. In\r\nMr. Valentine’s cases there was much minute vascularity, not only of the\r\noutside of the stomach but also of the whole peritonæum lining the\r\nviscera and inside of the abdomen; and there was even some serous\r\neffusion into the cavity. In Dr. Venables’s case the peritonæal coat of\r\nthe stomach was highly vascular and inflamed, and the omentum also\r\ninjected.\r\n\r\nThe urinary organs, and particularly the kidneys, are often much\r\ninflamed by poisoning with corrosive sublimate. Dr. Henry has related a\r\ncase in which this poison proved fatal on the ninth day, and where the\r\nleft kidney was found to contain an abscess.[1025] In all of Mr.\r\nValentine’s cases the kidneys were inflamed, and the bladder excessively\r\ncontracted, so as not to exceed the size of a walnut. In Ollivier’s\r\ncase, caused by the cyanide of mercury, the scrotum was gorged and\r\nblack, the penis erected, and the kidneys a third larger than natural.\r\nIn the case described by Dr. Venables both kidneys, but especially the\r\nleft, were large, flaccid, and vascular, the ureters turgid and purple,\r\nand the bladder contracted, empty, and red internally.\r\n\r\nOrfila has observed that the internal membrane of the heart is sometimes\r\ninflamed and checkered with brownish-black spots. Some remarks have been\r\nalready made on the light in which this appearance ought to be viewed by\r\nthe pathologist (p. 271).\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the real state of the fact as to the alleged power of\r\narsenic to preserve from decay the bodies of those poisoned with it, all\r\nauthors agree that corrosive sublimate possesses no such property. Yet\r\nit is well known to be a good antiseptic, when applied topically. The\r\nexperiments of Klanck, noticed under the head of Arsenic, prove that\r\ncorrosive sublimate at all events does not retard putrefaction in the\r\nbodies of those poisoned with it; and Augustin in his analysis of\r\nKlanck’s researches infers that it even promotes decay.[1026] I have met\r\nwith one example in the human subject which seems to confirm Augustin’s\r\nopinion. In the case formerly quoted from the Medical and Physical\r\nJournal, which was fatal in four days, the relater found the body\r\nforty-two hours after death so putrid, though in the month of January,\r\nthat the examination of it was very unpleasant, the belly being black,\r\nand a very offensive odour being exhaled.[1027] Little importance,\r\nhowever, can be attached to a solitary case; for on the contrary Sallin\r\nrelates a case where the body of a man supposed to have been poisoned\r\nwith corrosive sublimate was found not decayed, but imperfectly\r\nmummified, after sixty-seven days.[1028]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to detail the proofs to be found in the dead body of\r\nmercurial salivation having existed during life. They are of course to\r\nbe looked for in the mouth, and in the adjoining organs. We must not,\r\nhowever, expect to see much appearance of disease in the salivary\r\nglands; for according to Cruveilhier, in persons who die of mercurial\r\nsalivation these glands do not present any trace of inflammation\r\nthemselves, but merely serous effusion into the cellular tissue around\r\nthem.[1029]\r\n\r\nProfessor Orfila has made some useful experiments as to the effects of\r\ncorrosive sublimate on dead intestine, which it may be proper to notice\r\nin a few words. When applied in the form of powder to the rectum of an\r\nanimal newly killed, the part with which it is in contact becomes\r\nwrinkled, and as it were granulated, harder than natural, and of\r\nalabaster whiteness, intermingled with rose-red streaks, apparently the\r\nramifications of vessels. When the membrane is stretched upon the\r\nfinger, the wrinkling disappears. The muscular coat is of a snow-white\r\ncolour, and even the serous coat is white, opaque, and thickened. The\r\nparts not in contact with the powder retain their natural appearance,\r\nand the line of demarcation between the affected and unaffected portions\r\nis abrupt. If the powder is not applied till twenty-four hours after\r\ndeath, the parts it touches become thick, white, and hard; but no red\r\nlines are visible. It is easy to draw the distinction between these\r\nappearances and the effects of corrosive sublimate during life.\r\n\r\nLittle need be said of the force of the evidence of poisoning with\r\ncorrosive sublimate, derived from the morbid appearances. If the gullet,\r\nstomach, and colon be all inflamed and ulcerated, and these injuries\r\nhave taken place during a short illness, the presumption in favour of\r\nsome form of irritant poisoning will be strong. And the presumption of\r\npoisoning with corrosive sublimate will be strong, if the usual marks of\r\nsalivation are also found in the mouth and throat. But such evidence can\r\nnever amount to more than a strong presumption or probability.\r\n\r\n\r\n       SECTION IV.—_Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Mercury._\r\n\r\nThe treatment of poisoning by the compounds of mercury may be referred\r\nto two heads,—that which is required when irritation of the alimentary\r\ncanal is the prominent disorder, and that which is designed to remove\r\nmercurial salivation.\r\n\r\nIrritation and inflammation of the alimentary canal are to be treated\r\nnearly in the same way as when arsenic has been the poison swallowed. In\r\nthe instance of corrosive sublimate we also possess a convenient and\r\neffectual antidote.\r\n\r\nSeveral substances may be used as antidotes; but those which have\r\nhitherto been most employed are albumen and gluten.\r\n\r\nIt has been already hinted that albumen, in the form of white of eggs\r\nbeat up with water, impairs or destroys the corrosive properties of\r\nbichloride of mercury, by decomposing it and producing an insoluble\r\nmercurial compound. For this discovery and the establishment of albumen\r\nas an antidote, medicine is indebted to Professor Orfila. He has related\r\nmany satisfactory experiments in proof of its virtues. The following\r\nwill serve as an example of the whole. Twelve grains of corrosive\r\nsublimate were given to a little dog, and allowed to act for eight\r\nminutes, so that its usual effects might fairly begin before the\r\nantidote was administered. White of eight eggs was then given; after\r\nseveral fits of vomiting the animal became apparently free from pain;\r\nand in five days it was quite well.[1030] According to Peschier the\r\nwhite of one egg is required to render four grains of the poison\r\ninnocuous.[1031] The experiments of the Parisian toxicologist have been\r\nrepeated and confirmed by others and particularly by Schloepfer; who\r\nfound that when a dose was given to a rabbit sufficient to kill it in\r\nseven minutes if allowed to act uncontrolled, the administration of\r\nalbumen, just as the signs of uneasiness appeared, prevented every\r\nserious symptom.[1032] Dr. Samuel Wright has found that if the\r\nadministration of albumen is followed up by giving some astringent\r\ndecoction or infusion, the beneficial effects are more complete, because\r\nthe compound formed is less soluble in an excess of albumen.[1033]\r\n\r\nThe virtues of albumen have also been tried in the human subject with\r\nequally favourable results. The recovery of the patient, whose case was\r\nquoted formerly (p. 312), from Orfila’s Toxicology, seems to have been\r\nowing in great measure to this remedy. In the Medical Repository another\r\ncase is related, in which it Was also very serviceable.[1034] A third\r\nvery apposite example of its good effects is related by Dr. Lendrick.\r\nHis patient had taken about half a drachm of corrosive sublimate, and\r\nwas attacked with most of the usual symptoms, except vomiting. White of\r\neggs was administered a considerable time afterwards, the beneficial\r\neffects of which were instantaneous and well-marked; and the patient\r\nrecovered.[1035] A few years ago Orfila’s discovery was the means of\r\nsaving the life of M. Thenard the chemist. While at lecture, this\r\ngentleman inadvertently swallowed, instead of water, a mouthful of a\r\nconcentrated solution of corrosive sublimate; but having immediately\r\nperceived the fatal error, he sent for white of eggs, which he was\r\nfortunate enough to procure in five minutes. Although at this time he\r\nhad not vomited, he suffered no material harm. Without the prompt use of\r\nthe albumen, he would almost infallibly have perished.[1036]\r\n\r\nAlbumen is chiefly useful in the early stage of poisoning with corrosive\r\nsublimate, and is particularly called for when vomiting does not take\r\nplace. But it farther appears to be an excellent demulcent in the\r\nadvanced stages.\r\n\r\nOn a previous occasion, mention was made of a few of the facts brought\r\nforward by Professor Taddei to prove the virtues of the gluten of wheat\r\nas an antidote for poisoning with corrosive sublimate [297, 336], so\r\nthat nothing more need be said on the subject in the present place. As\r\nit is difficult to bring the whole of a fluid containing corrosive\r\nsublimate into speedy contact with pulverized gluten, which when put\r\ninto water becomes agglutinated into a mass, the discoverer of this\r\nantidote proposes to give it in the form of emulsion with soft soap.\r\nThis is made by mixing, partly in a mortar and partly with the hand,\r\nfive or six parts of fresh gluten with fifty parts of a solution of soft\r\nsoap. And in order to have a store always at hand, this emulsion, after\r\nstanding and being frequently stirred for twenty-four hours, is to be\r\nevaporated to dryness in shallow vessels, and reduced to powder. The\r\npowder may be converted into a frothy emulsion in a few minutes.[1037]\r\nTaddei made use of this powder with complete success in the case of a\r\nman who had swallowed seven grains of corrosive sublimate by mistake for\r\ncalomel. Violent symptoms followed the taking of the poison; but they\r\nwere immediately assuaged by the administration of the antidote; and the\r\nperson soon got quite well.[1038] It is probable that wheat flour will\r\nprove an effectual antidote by reason of the gluten it contains. On\r\nagitating for a few seconds a solution of twelve grains of corrosive\r\nsublimate along with three ounces of a strong emulsion of flour, and\r\nimmediately filtering,—I find that ammonia and carbonate of potass have\r\nlittle or no effect, that hydriodate of potass occasions a yellow\r\nprecipitate, and that the acrid, astringent taste of the solution is\r\nremoved; whence it may be inferred, that the corrosive sublimate is all\r\ndecomposed, that little mercury remains in solution, and that what does\r\nremain is in the form of a chloride of mercury and gluten.\r\n\r\nWhen neither albumen nor gluten is at hand, milk is a convenient\r\nantidote of the same kind.\r\n\r\nIron filings would appear to be also a good antidote. MM. Milne-Edwards\r\nand Dumas have found that when they were administered in the dose of an\r\nounce to animals after twelve or eighteen grains of corrosive sublimate\r\nhad remained long enough in the stomach for the symptoms to begin, the\r\nanimals recovered from the effects of the poison, and died only some\r\ndays afterwards of the effects of tying the gullet, which operation was\r\nnecessary to prevent them vomiting. The iron obviously acts by reducing\r\nthe corrosive sublimate to the metallic state.[1039]\r\n\r\nMeconic acid, the peculiar acid of opium, which will be described under\r\nthe head of that poison, is also probably a good antidote. Pettenkoffer\r\ncorrectly remarks that this acid has a great tendency to form very\r\ninsoluble salts with the metallic oxides, particularly with the\r\ndeutoxides, and above all when the acid is previously in union with a\r\nbase which constitutes a soluble salt.[1040] On this account it must be\r\na good antidote. Pettenkoffer adds, that the precipitating action of the\r\nmeconates is the reason why “the operation of corrosive sublimate on the\r\nanimal body is almost entirely prevented by opium.” Opium, however,\r\ncannot be safely used in such quantity as to decompose all the corrosive\r\nsublimate in a case of poisoning; for I find that an infusion of\r\nthirty-three grains is required to precipitate all which can be thrown\r\ndown from a solution of five grains of the mercurial salt. I am not\r\naware of any instances on record where poisoning with corrosive\r\nsublimate has been prevented or cured by opium given so as to decompose\r\nthe salt; but a very remarkable case will be related under the head of\r\nCompound Poisoning, where the phenomena of its action were masked and\r\naltered in a singular manner. There is little doubt that the alkaline\r\nmeconates must prove valuable antidotes for corrosive sublimate. At\r\npresent an effectual barrier to their employment is their rarity; but\r\nthey might be rendered more accessible, as a great quantity of meconate\r\nof lime, which is at present put to no use, is formed in the manufacture\r\nof muriate of morphia; and meconate of potass may easily be prepared in\r\nsufficient quantity from the meconate of lime.\r\n\r\nIt has been alleged by Dr. Buckler of Baltimore, that a mixture of\r\ngold-dust and iron filings is an effectual antidote; but Orfila denies\r\nthis statement; and the fact if true would be unimportant, on account of\r\nthe improbability of the materials being ever at hand in practice.[1041]\r\n\r\nM. Mialhe suggested not long ago as an antidote the proto-sulphuret of\r\niron prepared by decomposing sulphate of protoxide of iron by\r\nhydrosulphate of ammonia; and Orfila found that it is a perfect chemical\r\nantidote, which altogether prevents the poisonous action of corrosive\r\nsublimate, if administered to animals either before or immediately after\r\nthe poison; but he further ascertained that the lapse of ten minutes was\r\nsufficient to render it of no use.[1042] It is difficult, however, to\r\nperceive why in this respect it should differ from white of egg or any\r\nother chemical antidote.\r\n\r\nAs to the old antidotes for poisoning with corrosive sublimate, such as\r\nthe alkaline carbonates, the alkaline hydrosulphates, cinchona, mercury,\r\ncharcoal,—Orfila has given them all a fair trial, and found them all\r\ninefficacious. It would appear, however, from a case related in a late\r\nAmerican journal, that frequent doses of charcoal powder have much\r\neffect in soothing the bowels and allaying the inflammation after the\r\npoison is evacuated.[1043]\r\n\r\nThe treatment of mercurial salivation consists in exposure to a cool\r\npure air, nourishing diet, and purgatives, if the intestinal canal is\r\nnot already irritated. In some of the inflammatory affections it\r\ninduces, venesection is required; in others it is hurtful. In some\r\ncomplaints induced by mercury, as in iritis, the poison appears to be\r\nits own antidote; for nothing checks the inflammation so soon and so\r\ncertainly as mercurial salivation.\r\n\r\nDr. Finlay of the United States proposed to check mercurial salivation\r\nby small doses of tartar emetic frequently repeated, so as to act on the\r\nskin;[1044] and Mr. Daniell has recommended large doses of the acetate\r\nof lead as an effectual antidote for the same purpose.[1045] I have\r\ntried both of these plans several times with apparent success. In one\r\ninstance particularly, where a severe salivation was threatened by the\r\nadministration of six grains of calomel in three doses, and where\r\nprofuse salivation, ulceration of the tongue and swelling of the face\r\nactually did commence with violence, the mercurial affection after a few\r\ndays rapidly receded under the use of large doses of acetate of\r\nlead.—Dr. Klose, a German physician, says he has found iodine to possess\r\nthe property of arresting the effects of mercury on the mouth.[1046] The\r\niodide of potassium is generally acknowledged to be one of the best\r\nremedies for eradicating the constitutional infirmities left in many by\r\nsevere courses of mercury.\r\n\r\nA great deal might be said on the treatment of the secondary effects of\r\npoisoning with mercury. But a thorough investigation of the subject\r\nwould lead to such details as would be inconsistent with the other\r\nobjects of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n                        OF POISONING WITH COPPER\r\n\r\n\r\nPoisoning with the salts of copper was not long ago a common accident,\r\nin consequence of the metal being much used in the fabrication of\r\nvessels for culinary and other domestic purposes, or ignorantly resorted\r\nto by confectioners and others to impart a good colour to sweetmeats and\r\npreserves. Such accidents have been materially diminished in frequency\r\nsince the poisonous qualities of the metal, and the circumstances under\r\nwhich it is acted on by articles of food, have become known.\r\nNevertheless they are still frequent enough. The diffusion among the\r\ncommon people of the knowledge of the properties of copper has also\r\nnaturally led some persons to have recourse to its preparations for the\r\npurpose of self-destruction. Poisoning with copper has seldom been\r\ncaused by the wilful act of another person; for the deep colour of its\r\ncompounds and their strong disagreeable taste render it a difficult\r\nmatter to administer them secretly. This, however, though difficult, is\r\nnot impossible: whatever may be swallowed accidentally, may be also\r\nadministered secretly. In 1795 a woman Inglis was tried at Aberdeen for\r\nadministering sulphate of copper with intent to poison; but the charge\r\nwas not proved.[1047] In 1842 an attempt was made at Béziers in France\r\nto poison a young woman by dissolving this salt in her coffee; but the\r\nfirst mouthful caused such a sense of constriction in the throat as to\r\napprize her of something deleterious being present, and she escaped\r\nafter suffering from soreness of the mouth, vomiting and cramps.[1048] A\r\ncase of imputed poisoning with sulphate of copper has been related at\r\npage 76.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SECTION I.—_Of the Chemical History and Tests of the Preparations of\r\n                                Copper._\r\n\r\nMetallic copper has a special red colour, to which it gives its own\r\nname. Its specific gravity is nearly 9, its hardness considerable, its\r\ntenacity great, its point of fusion about 27° W. or at a full white\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nIt unites with oxygen in two proportions, forming a yellowish-red\r\nprotoxide, and a peroxide, which, when dry, is brownish-black—when\r\nhydrated, azure-blue. It unites also with sulphur in two corresponding\r\nproportions, forming a gold-yellow proto-sulphuret, the natural\r\ncopper-pyrites, and a black bisulphuret, which is formed by\r\nsulphuretted-hydrogen in all the solutions of this metal. The peroxide\r\nunites with ammonia. The acids all unite with the oxide and form blue or\r\ngreen salts, some of which are soluble, some insoluble. The oxide is\r\nfrequently mixed with other matters to form various pigments; but in\r\nsuch compounds the union is generally mechanical, not chemical. Of the\r\nsubstances thus formed and existing in nature and the arts the following\r\nonly require notice here. 1. _Mineral green_, and other pigments formed\r\nwith the hydrated oxide. 2. _Natural verdigris_, or the carbonate. 3.\r\n_Blue vitriol_, or the sulphate. 4. _Artificial verdigris_, or the mixed\r\nacetates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          1. _Mineral Green._\r\n\r\nThe description of this substance and its chemical properties must be\r\nintroduced with a short account of the tests for the unmixed _peroxide_.\r\nWhen free of water the peroxide is a brownish-black powder or granular\r\nmass, which is usually procured by decomposing nitrate of copper at a\r\nlow red heat. It is easily known by the solvent power of nitric acid,\r\nthe blue colour of the filtered solution, and the beautiful deep violet\r\ntint communicated to the solution by an excess of ammonia. The last\r\nproperty is considered by chemists the most satisfactory proof of the\r\npresence of oxide of copper in a fluid. It is alone quite free of\r\nfallacy, and may be applied to all the soluble and also many insoluble\r\ncompounds of copper, provided they are not mixed with a large proportion\r\nof vegetable or animal fluids, in which case the colour is often\r\ngreenish.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the peroxide and of copper poisons generally, the process\r\nof reduction, which has been applied with such delicacy and precision to\r\narsenical and mercurial poisons, loses all its advantages. The metal\r\nremains in the flux, and intimately diffused; so that of its physical\r\nqualities the colour only can be estimated, and even that but\r\ninaccurately, except in the instance of one compound, verdigris.\r\n\r\nThe _hydrated peroxide of copper_, when newly formed and well prepared,\r\nhas a fine azure-blue colour; but on exposure to a gentle heat, it parts\r\nwith its water, and becomes the anhydrous peroxide. It is procured by\r\nprecipitating any of the soluble salts of copper by means of caustic\r\npotass. It is at once known by the action of ammonia, which immediately\r\nforms with it a deep violet-blue solution.\r\n\r\n_Mineral green_, as already mentioned under the head of Arsenic (p.\r\n223), was originally an arsenical pigment introduced into the art of\r\ncolour-making by Scheele, and now sometimes sold in this country by the\r\nname of emerald-green. But the mineral green of the colourist now\r\ncontains no arsenic, being a hydrate of peroxide of copper intimately\r\nmixed with a little lime, which is generally carbonated. This variety of\r\nmineral-green probably varies a little in composition. Some parcels I\r\nhave found to contain the lime in the state of carbonate; in others the\r\nlime was chiefly caustic.\r\n\r\nThe best method of determining its nature is to dissolve it in diluted\r\nhydrochloric acid, which leaves only a slight cloudiness from accidental\r\nimpurities; and then to transmit through the filtered solution a stream\r\nof sulphuretted hydrogen gas. The copper on boiling is all thrown down\r\nin the form of a black bisulphuret, and hydrochlorate of lime remains in\r\nsolution. The lime is then to be detected by its proper tests, after the\r\nsolution has been filtered and neutralized (see p. 192). In general this\r\nlong process is unnecessary, as the medical jurist may be simply\r\nrequired to say whether the suspected substance contains copper. In that\r\ncase it is only requisite to subject the substance to the action of\r\nammonia, as if it was hydrated peroxide.\r\n\r\n_Verditer_, another green pigment, the basis of which is always oxide of\r\ncopper, does not appear to differ essentially in composition from\r\nmineral green. The samples I have examined consist of a large proportion\r\nof hydrated oxide of copper, and a small proportion of carbonate of\r\nlime.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        2. _Natural Verdigris._\r\n\r\nThis is a compound of no great importance in a medico-legal point of\r\nview. Nevertheless an instance has been lately published in which it was\r\ntaken for the purpose of committing suicide, and was found abundantly in\r\nthe stomach.[1049] The carbonate of copper exists naturally in two\r\nstates. In one form it constitutes the rust of copper, or natural\r\nverdigris, and is produced as a powdery crust on metallic copper by long\r\nexposure to moist air. It is insipid and insoluble, so that pure water\r\nleft in vessels incrusted with it does not become poisonous. It\r\ndissolves with effervescence in sulphuric acid, and without\r\neffervescence in ammonia, forming the usual violet solution. In another\r\nform it exists in the mineral kingdom, constituting the chief part of a\r\nbeautiful ore, malachite, and also a considerable proportion of some\r\nblue-copper ores.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           3. _Blue Vitriol._\r\n\r\nBlue vitriol, blue copperas, blue stone, vitriol of copper, as it is\r\nvariously called in common speech, is the sulphate of copper. In the\r\nsolid form it constitutes large crystals of a deep blue colour, and an\r\nacrid, astringent, metallic taste, efflorescent in dry air, and very\r\nsoluble in water. Under the action of heat it first loses its water of\r\ncrystallization without undergoing the watery effusion; then its\r\nsulphuric acid is driven off partly unchanged, partly decomposed; and at\r\nlast the brown peroxide is left behind in a state of considerable\r\npurity. If carbonaceous matter be previously mixed with the sulphate,\r\nthe oxide is decomposed at a low red heat, so that the process of\r\nreduction may be performed in a glass tube. For the reasons formerly\r\nstated, this process does not constitute a convenient or characteristic\r\ntest for sulphate of copper. The best mode of ascertaining its nature is\r\nto dissolve it, and then to apply the tests for the solution.\r\n\r\nThere are many excellent tests for copper in solution. But the four\r\nfollowing are the most delicate and characteristic,—ammonia,\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, ferro-cyanate of potass, and metallic iron.\r\n\r\n1. _Ammonia_ causes a pale azure precipitate, which is redissolved by an\r\nexcess of the test, forming a deep violet-blue transparent fluid. If the\r\nsolution is very diluted, there is no previous precipitation; the fluid\r\nbecomes violet without its transparency being disturbed. This is a\r\nperfectly characteristic test of copper, and one of great delicacy.\r\n\r\n2. _Sulphuretted hydrogen gas_ causes a dark brownish-black precipitate,\r\nthe sulphuret of copper. This test is one of very great delicacy; but it\r\nis not alone decisive of the presence of copper, since lead, bismuth,\r\nmercury, and silver, are similarly affected by it. A method, however,\r\nwill be presently described, by which the precise nature of the\r\nsulphuret may be determined.\r\n\r\nThe alkaline hydrosulphates, for example the hydrosulphate of ammonia,\r\nanswer equally well with sulphuretted-hydrogen. The solution of the\r\ncommon liver of sulphur throws down, not a black, but a chestnut\r\nprecipitate.\r\n\r\n3. _Ferro-cyanate of potass_ causes a fine hair-brown precipitate, the\r\nferro-cyanide of copper. This test is also exceedingly delicate and\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\n4. A polished rod or plate of _metallic iron_, held in a solution of\r\nsulphate of copper, soon becomes covered with a red powdery crust, which\r\nis metallic copper; and ere long the solution is changed in colour from\r\nblue to greenish-yellow. The action is simple; the iron merely displaces\r\nthe copper in the solution, in which a sulphate of iron is consequently\r\nformed. This test is characteristic, and even of considerable delicacy.\r\nAt the same time other substances may cause a reddish encrustation on\r\niron by simply rusting it, so that the test cannot be relied on alone.\r\n\r\nThe four preceding reagents taken together are amply sufficient to prove\r\nthe existence of copper in a solution. Three other tests, however, may\r\nbe here briefly alluded to.\r\n\r\nCaustic potass in a solution not too diluted causes a fine azure-blue\r\nprecipitate, the hydrated peroxide of copper.\r\n\r\nOxide of arsenic, with the previous addition of a few drops of ammonia,\r\ncauses a fine apple-green or grass-green precipitate, the arsenite of\r\ncopper. This test, which is both delicate and characteristic, has been\r\nalready fully considered under the head of Arsenic.\r\n\r\nThe process by fluid reagents, as hitherto laid down, merely proves the\r\npresence of copper, but does not indicate the acid with which the oxide\r\nis combined. In order to determine whether it is sulphuric acid, the\r\nfluid must also be tested with nitrate of baryta followed by nitric\r\nacid: a heavy white precipitate is thus produced, which the excess of\r\nnitric acid does not redissolve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       4. _Artificial Verdigris._\r\n\r\n_Artificial verdigris_ is a common pigment, which is met with in the\r\nform either of earth-like masses, or of a light powder of a\r\ngreenish-blue colour and peculiar disagreeable smell, approaching that\r\nof vinegar. Like blue vitriol it has a strong metallic, astringent\r\ntaste. The effect of heat is peculiar. Some acetic acid is in the first\r\nplace distilled over; a portion of the acid, however, is decomposed and\r\nreduces the oxide; and a low red heat is sufficient to make the outer\r\ncrust of the verdigris distinctly copper-red, when the material is\r\ncontained in a glass tube.\r\n\r\nArtificial verdigris varies somewhat in composition. Foreign verdigris\r\ncontains chiefly the hydrated diacetate, with a little carbonate, oxide,\r\nand even metallic copper, along with particles of the fruit and\r\nfruit-stalks of the grape. British verdigris consists of little else\r\nthan the hydrated diacetate. It is known by the following characters.\r\nAmmonia dissolves it almost entirely, forming a deep violet solution.\r\nDiluted sulphuric acid dissolves it, evolving an odour of acetic acid,\r\nand forming a solution of sulphate of copper, which may be known by the\r\ntests for that salt. Boiling water converts it partly into an insoluble\r\nbrown powder, which is oxide of copper in union with a small proportion\r\nof acetic acid, and partly into a greenish-blue neutral acetate, which\r\nis dissolved, and may be known by the four tests for sulphate of copper,\r\nand the want of action of nitrate of baryta.\r\n\r\nIt may be right to notice shortly three other salts of copper, the\r\nnitrate, the ammoniacal sulphate, and the muriate. The _nitrate_ forms a\r\nviolet solution, which is acted on by reagents in the same way as the\r\ndissolved acetate, but has not any odour of vinegar. The _ammoniacal\r\nsulphate_ [ammoniated copper—ammoniuret of copper], has been\r\noccasionally used in medicine. It forms, when solid, small scaly\r\ncrystals, of an intense violet colour and strong ammoniacal odour; and\r\nwhen dissolved it retains its peculiar colour even though very much\r\ndiluted.—The _muriate_ of copper has a lively grass-green colour, and is\r\nacted on by reagents in the same way as the solution of verdigris.\r\n\r\n_Of the corrosion of copper by articles of food and drink._—To these\r\nobservations on the chemical history of copper a few remarks must be\r\nadded relative to the action of various articles of food or drink upon\r\nthe metal. Unpleasant accidents have often happened from the use of\r\ncopper vessels in the preparation of food; and it is therefore necessary\r\nfor the medical jurist to know the circumstances, so far as they have\r\nbeen investigated, under which the poison may be dissolved.\r\n\r\nDr. Falconer found, that distilled water kept several weeks on a\r\npolished plate of copper, neither injured its lustre, nor acquired any\r\ntaste, nor become coloured with ammonia;[1050] and Drouard afterwards\r\nobserved, that distilled water, kept for a month on copper filings, did\r\nnot contain any of the metal.[1051] Eller of Berlin, however, remarked,\r\nthat water, if it contain a considerable quantity of common salt, as\r\nfour ounces in five pounds, or a twentieth part, will give slight traces\r\nof copper after being boiled in a brass pan; and that if the pan be made\r\nof copper, a powder is procured by evaporation, which when treated with\r\nacetic acid yields so much as 20 grains of acetate of copper.[1052] But\r\nit is a singular circumstance, also observed by the same\r\nexperimentalist, that if beef of fish be boiled with the usual allowance\r\nof salt, and with the addition also of various vegetable substances, the\r\nliquid does not yield any copper. This observation has been lately\r\ndenied by Professor Orfila; who says he found copper deposited on a\r\nplate of iron in salt water in which beef had been boiled, and that he\r\nalso obtained copper from the beef itself.[1053] The quantity thus\r\ndissolved, however, must be exceedingly small, if the copper be kept\r\nclean and free of oxide; for copper vessels, although they have often\r\nbeen the source of fatal accidents, if carelessly used in the\r\npreparation of food, have appeared under careful management to be quite\r\nharmless. An excellent practical confirmation of this will be found in\r\nMichaelis’s Commentaries. He states, that in the Orphan Hospital of\r\nHallé, the food was in his time prepared in large copper vessels, which\r\nwere kept remarkably clean; and that out of a population of eight or\r\nnine hundred he never heard of any one having suffered from symptoms of\r\npoisoning with copper.[1054] Several other saline matters promote the\r\nsolution of copper in water. Thus Dr. Falconer found that alum has this\r\neffect when aided by heat; and probably nitre and Epsom salt possess the\r\nsame quality.[1055] Their mode of action is not very well known.\r\n\r\nIt is a common though erroneous idea, that milk, heated or allowed to\r\nstand in a copper vessel, becomes impregnated with the metal. Eller has\r\nshown, that, on the contrary, if the vessel be well cleaned, milk, tea,\r\ncoffee, beer, and rain-water, kept in a state of ebullition for two\r\nhours, do not contract the slightest impurity from copper;[1056] and the\r\nsame remark has been also made by Dr. Falconer with respect to cabbage,\r\npotatoes, turnips, carrots, onions, rice, and barley.[1057]\r\n\r\nBut Eller farther remarked, that, if the vessel is not thoroughly clean,\r\nthen all acid substances dissolve the carbonate that encrusts it,\r\nespecially if left in it for some time. Nay, it appears that some acid\r\nmatters, though they do not dissolve clean copper by being merely boiled\r\nin it a few minutes, nevertheless, if allowed to cool and stand some\r\ntime in it, will acquire a sensible impregnation.[1058] Dr. Falconer\r\nalso observed that syrup of lemons, boiled fifteen minutes in copper or\r\nbrass pans, did not acquire a sensible impregnation; but if it was\r\nallowed to cool and remain in the pans for twenty-four hours, the\r\nimpregnation was perceptible even to the taste, and was discovered by\r\nthe test of metallic iron.[1059] This fact has been farther confirmed by\r\nthe researches of Proust,[1060] who states, that, in preparing food or\r\npreserves in copper, it is not till the fluid ceases to cover the metal,\r\nand is reduced in temperature, that solution of the metal begins.\r\nInattention to this difference has been the cause of fatal accidents, of\r\nwhich the following case from Wildberg’s Practical Manual will serve as\r\na good example. A servant left some sour-krout for only a couple of\r\nhours in a copper pan which had lost the tinning. Her mistress and a\r\ndaughter, who took the cabbage to dinner, died after twelve hours\r\nillness; and Wildberg found the cabbage so strongly impregnated with\r\ncopper, that it was detected by the test of metallic iron.[1061]\r\n\r\nSome wines have the same power, by reason of the acid they contain.\r\nHence Eller found twenty-one grains of the acetate in five pounds of\r\nFrench white wine, after being boiled in a copper vessel. An epidemic\r\ndisease, mentioned by Fabricius, which broke out in 1592 among the\r\nsenators of Bern, and a number of their guests who had been invited to a\r\ngreat entertainment, was supposed to have arisen from a poisonous\r\nimpregnation of this kind. The wine used at the feast had been kept cool\r\nin copper vessels immersed in a very cold well. Many of the company were\r\nattacked with dysenteric symptoms, and some died.[1062]\r\n\r\nVinegar also dissolves metallic copper. Dupuytren observed that the\r\nvinegar sold by hawkers in the streets of Paris generally contained\r\ncopper from the action of the acetic acid on the stop-cocks of the\r\nlittle vessels used in retailing it.[1063] Others in like manner have\r\nfound copper in vinegar pickles prepared in copper vessels. Thus Dr.\r\nPercival found a strong impregnation of copper in pickled samphire, of\r\nwhich a young lady ate one morning two breakfast platefuls, and which\r\nproved fatal to her in nine days.[1064] And Dr. Falconer once detected\r\nso large a quantity in some pickled cucumbers bought at a great London\r\ngrocer’s, that it was deposited on a plate of iron, and imparted its\r\npeculiar taste and smell to the pickles.[1065] It seems indeed to have\r\nbeen at one time the custom to make a point of adulterating pickles with\r\ncopper; for in many old cookery-books the cook is told to make her\r\npickles in a copper pan, or to put some halfpence among the pickles to\r\ngive them a fine green colour.[1066]\r\n\r\nThe action of the vegetable acids, and more particularly of vinegar on\r\ncopper, depends on the co-operation of the atmospheric air held in\r\nsolution by the fluid, and in contact with its surface. Without such\r\nco-operation the copper cannot be oxidated. This fact, which was\r\ndetermined experimentally by Proust,[1067] will explain the observations\r\nof Eller and Falconer,—that it is not dangerous to boil acidulous\r\nliquids in copper vessels, while it is very unsafe to keep these fluids\r\ncold in the same vessels. In the latter instance the liquid is\r\nimpregnated with atmospheric air, while in the former the usual aëriform\r\ncontents are driven off by the heat. I must observe, however, in\r\nlimitation of Proust’s statement, that strong vinegar, such as the\r\npyroligneous acetic acid, will become impregnated to a certain extent if\r\nboiled in copper vessels. The action which takes place is the same as\r\nthat remarked by him in the case of cold vinegar:[1067] the copper where\r\nit is always covered remains quite bright; but at the edge of the fluid\r\nit becomes oxidated, and the oxide is dissolved by the occasional\r\nbubbling up of the acid.\r\n\r\nIn the last place, the property of oxidating and uniting with copper is\r\nlikewise possessed by fatty matters and oils. According to Falconer,\r\nfatty substances do not act on metallic copper unless they are\r\nrancid.[1068] But Proust is probably more correct when he states, that\r\nthey will act, though fresh, provided they are aided by the co-operation\r\nof atmospheric air.[1069] I have found, that, if a plate of copper be\r\nthrust into a mass of fresh butter, its surface becomes dark in\r\ntwenty-four hours, and the butter becomes green wherever it is in\r\ncontact both with the copper and the air, but not where it covers the\r\nmetal closely. In fresh hog’s lard, however, I have found that the whole\r\nlard in contact with the copper becomes blue even at a depth to which\r\nthe air can scarcely reach. The action of oils is similar. It is even\r\nprobable that they act when hot; for Mr. Travis found that hot oil\r\nbecame green when kept for only four or five minutes in a copper\r\nvessel.[1070] Dr. Falconer mentions that the property of acting on\r\ncopper is possessed in an eminent degree by volatile oils, and\r\nespecially by oil of cloves and oil of cinnamon.[1071]\r\n\r\nThe general result of the preceding observations is, that there is\r\nhardly any article of food or drink which may not become impregnated\r\nwith copper if kept in copper vessels, as there are few articles which\r\ndo not contain either an acid or some fatty matter; and it farther\r\nappears, that the impregnation will scarcely ever take place during the\r\nboiling of such articles, but only during the preservation of them in a\r\ncold state. It must also be considered, that, independently of these\r\nchemical impregnations, articles of food may be mixed mechanically with\r\ncopper, in consequence of the vessels being allowed, through the\r\ncarelessness of the cook, to become covered with rust or carbonate,\r\nwhich is subsequently removed by the friction of the solid parts of any\r\narticle that is boiled in them.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent accidental impregnations, copper vessels are usually\r\ntinned. The tinning consists of an alloy of tin and lead, which is much\r\nless easily attacked than the copper, and the safety of which is farther\r\ninsured by the circumstance, that the substances endowed with the\r\nproperty of dissolving lead, cannot attack that metal before the whole\r\ntin of the alloy is oxidated.[1072] The tinning of copper, however, has\r\nbeen found to be but a partial protection, as the tinning is apt to be\r\nworn away without attracting the attention of servants. Hence the use of\r\ncopper in the fabrication of kitchen utensils is becoming every day more\r\nand more limited, especially since the manufacture of cast-iron vessels\r\nwas brought to perfection in this country.\r\n\r\nMany instances might be adduced of the ignorance and carelessness which\r\nprevailed, even not far back in the last century, as to the employment\r\nof copper vessels for culinary purposes. In addition to the instances\r\nalready quoted, the following are well deserving of notice. Gmelin was\r\nconsulted by the abbot of a monastery, on account of a violent disease\r\nwhich prevailed throughout the whole brotherhood of monks. The symptoms\r\nwere obstinate and severe colic, retching and bilious vomiting,\r\ncostiveness, flatus, burning pain in the pit of the stomach, under the\r\nsternum, in the kidneys and extremities, and paralytic weakness in the\r\narms. On inquiring into the cause of this singular combination of\r\nsymptoms, Gmelin found that every vessel in the kitchen, the pots and\r\npans, and even the milk pails and butter dishes for storing the butter,\r\nwere made of copper.[1073] In 1781 an establishment of Jacobin monks at\r\nParis were all violently affected from a similar error. The cook on a\r\nFriday and the subsequent Saturday, after boiling fish for the dinner of\r\nthe monks in a copper pan, and drawing off the water, poured vinegar\r\nover the fish, and left it thus in the pan for a considerable time. On\r\nthe evening of Friday several of them were taken severely ill with\r\nheadache, acute pain in the stomach and bowels, precordial anxiety,\r\npurging, great feebleness, and cramps in the legs. The rest of them, to\r\nthe number of twenty-one in all, were similarly attacked next morning;\r\nand the symptoms continued in most of them for five or six days.[1074]\r\n\r\nA singular variety of adulteration with copper was brought not long ago\r\ninto public notice on the continent,—namely, the impregnation of bread\r\nwith the sulphate of copper, which was used in small quantity for\r\npromoting the fermentation of the dough. This practice was first\r\ndetected in some of the towns of Flanders, but was afterwards found to\r\nprevail in France.[1075] Some chemists of reputation have indeed doubted\r\naltogether the existence of the practice; and M. Barruel in particular,\r\nwho was consulted on the subject by the Prefecture of Paris, publicly\r\ndeclared his disbelief, because he remarked that, instead of favouring\r\nthe panary fermentation, a very small proportion of sulphate of copper\r\nactually impeded it, and besides gave the bread a greenish colour of\r\nsuch depth that no customer would take it for a wholesome article.[1076]\r\nSubsequent inquiries, however, have shown that Barruel must have allowed\r\nhimself to be misled, probably by using too much of the sulphate of\r\ncopper. For the bakers of St. Omer admitted that they practised this\r\nulceration for the sake of saving their yeast, the proportion required\r\nbeing an ounce of the salt in two pints of water, for every hundred\r\nweight (_quintal_) of dough, or about an 1800th part.[1077] And it\r\nappears from an interesting set of experiments by M. Meylink, a chemist\r\nof Deventer, that, contrary to the statements of Barruel, sulphate of\r\ncopper not only possesses the property of promoting the panary\r\nfermentation, but likewise constitutes in several important respects a\r\nsource of adulteration, which ought to be prohibited and strictly looked\r\nafter. He found that when he added to half a Flemish pound of dough from\r\none grain to eight grains of sulphate of copper, fermentation took place\r\nmore quickly than in the same dough without such addition, and nearly in\r\nproportion to the quantity of the salt used;—that the adulterated loaves\r\nwhen taken out of the oven were much better raised, and the loaf with\r\nonly one grain of the salt likewise much whiter, than those which were\r\nnot adulterated;—that a slight increase, however, in the proportion\r\nrendered the loaf greenish, and gave it a peculiar taste; but especially\r\nthat the employment of the salt of copper even in the small proportion\r\nof one grain had the singular effect of bringing about the complete\r\nfermentation of the dough with considerably less loss of weight than\r\noccurs in the common process of baking, the loss in the sound and in the\r\nadulterated loaves being in the proportion of 116 to 100.[1078] It\r\ncertainly seems fully proved, then, that the adulteration of bread with\r\nsulphate of copper is an important fraud in more ways than one. Some\r\ndoubt may be entertained whether any injury can result to the human body\r\nfrom even the habitual use of so small a quantity as that employed by\r\nthe bakers; and at all events, we may be satisfied that if any bad\r\neffects do result, this can only happen from the continual use of the\r\nadulterated bread for a great length of time. But there can be no doubt\r\nthat the practice is a fraud on the public, by enabling the baker to\r\nmake his loaves of the standard weight with a less allowance of\r\nnutritive material.\r\n\r\nAnother important adulteration also indicated by foreign chemists, is\r\nthat of syrup made with the coarsest kinds of sugar, and decolorized by\r\nmeans of sulphate of copper. The colour is removed by adding a solution\r\nof the sulphate to the syrup boiling hot, and decomposing the salt by\r\nlime; but a portion of the salt is often left behind, and in consequence\r\naccidents have arisen from such syrups being used in making various\r\nmedicinal preparations.[1079]\r\n\r\n_Of the detection of copper in organic mixtures._—As in the instance of\r\narsenic and mercury, so in that of copper the presence of vegetable and\r\nanimal principles interposes material obstacles in the application of\r\nthe ordinary tests and methods of analysis. Some substances, such as\r\nalbumen, milk, tea, coffee, and the like, decompose the solutions of the\r\nsalts of copper, throwing down the oxide of copper in union with various\r\nproximate principles. Others, such as red wine, bile, vomited matter,\r\nand the tissues composing the stomach, although they do not decompose\r\nthe soluble copper salts, alter materially the action of reagents on\r\nthem. These facts were established long ago by Professor Orfila;[1080]\r\nand various processes were suggested by him, by myself in former\r\neditions of this work, and by various other authors, with the view of\r\novercoming the difficulties in question.\r\n\r\nMore lately a fresh difficulty has been started, which has been thought\r\nto render every prior process fallacious, including that which I have\r\nproposed. For it is alleged that copper exists naturally as a\r\nconstituent part of many vegetable and animal substances, and more\r\nespecially in the organs of the human body. This statement is so\r\nimportant as to deserve attentive consideration before fixing on a\r\nmethod of analysis for medico-legal cases.\r\n\r\nSome time ago Meissner pointed out the existence of a trace of copper in\r\nsome vegetable substances;[1081] and more recently M. Sarzeau alleged\r\nthat a minute quantity of this metal, sometimes not above a 1,500,000th\r\nand never exceeding a 120,000th part, may be detected not only in all\r\nvegetable substances, but likewise in the blood, as well as other fluids\r\nand solids of the animal body. Among vegetable substances he examined\r\nwith great care cinchona-bark, madder, coffee, wheat and flour; and he\r\nsucceeded in separating metallic copper from them all.[1082]\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of these researches was called in question. By some\r\nchemists the discoveries of Meissner and Sarzeau were confirmed so far\r\nas they relate to vegetable substances. By others the confirmation was\r\nextended to the animal body, and more especially to the human organs and\r\nsecretions. Thus M. Devergie says, that, having been struck with the\r\nsingular circumstance of two cases occurring to him in a single year,\r\nwhere analysis indicated copper in the tissues of the alimentary canal\r\nof persons suspected of having died of poison, he was led to inquire,\r\nalong with M. O. Henry, whether the metal was contained naturally in the\r\ntextures of the human body; and that in the course of many experiments,\r\nalthough unable to detect any in a solution made by means of weak acetic\r\nacid, he could always find it by the process of incineration.[1083]\r\nOrfila has also repeatedly detected traces of copper in the bodies of\r\nanimals not poisoned with the preparations of that metal.[1084]\r\n\r\nBy other experimentalists opposite results have been obtained, more\r\nespecially in regard to animal solids and fluids. In the course of an\r\ninquiry relative to the question, whether poisons pass into the blood, I\r\nfailed to detect copper in the blood, muscles, or spinal marrow of\r\nanimals, although the method of analysis must have enabled me to\r\ndiscover extremely minute quantities of that metal. Afterwards M.\r\nChevreul was unable to detect the slightest trace of copper in beef,\r\nveal, or mutton; nor was he more successful in the case of wheat,\r\nprovided care was taken to keep the sample clean.[1085] And more\r\nrecently MM. Flandin and Danger have denied that there is any copper\r\never found naturally in the body.[1086]\r\n\r\nThese discrepant results appear to be in a great measure reconciled in\r\nan extensive inquiry into the subject by M. Boutigny; who found that\r\nwheat, wine, cider, and some other substances of a vegetable nature, do\r\nfrequently present minute traces of copper, but only when copper is\r\ncontained in the manure used in raising the grain, apples, and the like;\r\nthat manure from the streets of great towns always contains copper, and\r\nintroduces it into vegetable articles grown where such manure is used;\r\nand that the occasional presence of the same metal in animal substances\r\nmay be traced either to copper vessels having been employed in preparing\r\nor preserving them, or to the animals producing them having been fed on\r\nvegetables presenting from the causes mentioned above a faint cupreous\r\nimpregnation.[1087]—Another fallacy, which may account for the alleged\r\ninvariable success of some chemists, has been pointed out by M.\r\nHiers-Reynaert of Bruges. Having once obtained copper in a specimen of\r\nsuspected bread, when he used paper for a filter, but none when he used\r\nlinen, he was led to examine various filtering papers, and found that\r\nsome kinds contain an appreciable trace of copper.[1088] This important\r\nfact must be attended to in all medico-legal investigations.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, whatever may be thought of the physiological question,\r\nwhether copper forms a constituent of the textures and fluids of\r\nvegetables and animals, it seems well established that this metal is\r\noften present there in minute proportion; and consequently its possible\r\npresence must not be overlooked in medico-legal researches. Fortunately\r\nmethods of analysis are known which this source of fallacy does not\r\naffect.\r\n\r\n_Process._ The following method embraces all possible cases; and it is\r\nexempt, so far as yet appears, from every source of error.\r\n\r\n1. Should the subject of analysis not be a liquid, render it such by\r\ndividing it into small fragments, and boiling it gently for an hour in\r\ndistilled water acidulated with acetic acid, which must previously be\r\nascertained not to contain any copper. If the liquid be not viscid,\r\nfilter it at once; but if it be too viscid for filtration, pass it\r\nthrough a muslin sieve, add two volumes of rectified spirit to it when\r\ncool, and then filter it. Transmit through a small portion of it a\r\nstream of hydrosulphuric acid gas; and if a brownish-black precipitate\r\nor cloud form, subject the whole liquid to the gas. A brown precipitate,\r\nwhich is sulphuret of copper, will separate either immediately, or after\r\nebullition and repose for an hour. Collect the precipitate, if abundant,\r\nby filtration, if scanty, by repeated subsidence and affusion. Dry it,\r\nsubject it to a low red heat, and then heat it with a little strong\r\nnitric acid, which will convert the sulphuret into the sulphate of\r\ncopper. This salt, dissolved out by boiling distilled water, may be\r\nsubjected to the tests described above, and especially to ammonia.\r\n\r\n2. If the copper be extremely minute in quantity, sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nwill not act upon it in a fluid much charged with organic matter. To\r\nmeet this possible case, which may occur when the subject of analysis is\r\nan organ of the human body into which the poison has been conveyed by\r\nabsorption,—let the liquid be evaporated to dryness, and charred in the\r\nfollowing manner. Heat in a porcelain basin a quantity of nitric acid\r\nequal in weight to the residuum, together with a fifteenth of chlorate\r\nof potash. Add the dry residuum in successive portions of such magnitude\r\nas not to occasion too great effervescence. When it has been all added,\r\nheat the product till it become dark-red and thick. It will then, or\r\nsoon afterwards, begin suddenly to char, and at length a thick vapour\r\nwill arise in dense clouds; upon which, the charring being complete, the\r\nheat must be withdrawn. Pulverise the carbonaceous mass; boil it with\r\nnitric acid diluted with its own volume of water; and evaporate the\r\nfiltered fluid to dryness, so as to expel any excess of acid. Dissolve\r\nthe saline residuum, and test the solution with the usual reagents.\r\n\r\nThe first branch of this process is nearly the same with the one adopted\r\nin the last edition of the present work. The second is derived from a\r\nprocess lately proposed by Orfila.[1089]\r\n\r\nThe principles on which it is founded are these. 1. Of the numerous\r\norganic compounds formed by vegetable and animal principles with the\r\nsalts of copper, all either dissolve in very weak acetic acid, or part\r\nwith their oxide of copper to it. This was pointed out by me in my last\r\nedition. 2, Weak acetic acid, as already mentioned (p. 356), has been\r\nshown by M. Devergie to be incapable of dissolving that copper which is\r\ncontained naturally in the tissues, at least so as to render it\r\ndiscoverable by the subsequent steps of the process. 3, According to\r\nOrfila, copper naturally present in organic substances, is never\r\nindicated by the second branch of the process, provided the charred\r\nproduct of the action of nitric acid and chlorate of potash be not\r\nheated to incineration. It does not appear why the charring process,\r\nwhen so conducted, should separate adventitious copper, and not that\r\nwhich is present naturally. But the empirical fact may be accepted in\r\nthe mean time, as it rests on apparently careful experiments.\r\n\r\nOrfila does not use acetic acid in the first branch of his process, but\r\nmerely infuses the suspected matter in cold water, and if copper be not\r\nthus found, he has recourse to boiling water. But this method introduces\r\nneedless complexity; and besides neither maceration, nor boiling with\r\nmere water, will dissolve out the whole oxide of copper. Acidulation\r\nwith acetic acid dissolves it all; and Devergie has shown that this\r\nadvantage is gained without any additional fallacy arising from the\r\npossible presence of copper as a natural ingredient of the substance\r\nunder examination (p. 356).\r\n\r\n\r\n  SECTION II.—_Of the Action of Copper, and the Symptoms it excites in\r\n                                 Man._\r\n\r\nThe symptoms caused by copper have at least two varieties in their\r\ncharacter. One class arises from its local action on the alimentary\r\ncanal; the other from its operation on distant organs.\r\n\r\nThis double influence is proved by the experiments of Drouard on\r\nanimals, published in his inaugural dissertation at Paris in 1802; and\r\nby those of Orfila in his Toxicology.\r\n\r\nWhen Drouard gave twelve grains of verdigris to a strong dog fasting, he\r\nobserved that it caused aversion to food, efforts to vomit, diarrhœa,\r\nlistlessness, and death in twenty-two hours; and that the stomach was\r\nbut little inflamed. When two grains dissolved in water were injected\r\ninto the jugular vein of another dog, it caused vomiting and discharge\r\nof fæces in seven minutes, then rattling in the throat, and death in\r\nhalf an hour; and there was no particular morbid appearance in the\r\nbody.—Half a grain killed another in four days; and in addition to the\r\npreceding symptoms, there was palsy of the hind legs for a day before\r\ndeath. Six grains of the sulphate introduced into the stomach killed a\r\ndog in half an hour, without producing any appearance of\r\ninflammation.[1090]\r\n\r\nThese experiments prove that it is not by causing local irritation that\r\nthis poison proves fatal. But its mode of action is more distinctly\r\nshown in the later and more accurate experiments of Orfila. He found\r\nthat twelve or fifteen grains of the neutral acetate generally killed\r\ndogs within an hour; and that besides the usual symptoms of irritation\r\nin the stomach, they often had insensibility, almost always convulsions,\r\nand immediately before death rigidity, or even absolute tetanus. He\r\nlikewise remarked violent convulsions and insensibility when a grain of\r\nthis salt was injected into the veins; and death was then seldom delayed\r\nbeyond ten minutes. In no case was there any particular morbid\r\nappearance, except loss of contractility in the voluntary muscles.[1091]\r\nMore recently results nearly the same have been obtained by\r\nMitscherlich; and when doses of two drachms of sulphate of copper were\r\ngiven, he observed after death pale blueness of the villous coat of the\r\nstomach, mingled with brownness,—the apparent effect of chemical\r\naction.[1092]\r\n\r\nAllied to these results are those obtained by my late colleague, Dr.\r\nDuncan, and by Mitscherlich, when the sulphate was applied to a wound.\r\nDr. Duncan observed that death took place in twenty-two hours, and the\r\nbody was every where in a healthy state. Mitscherlich found that a\r\ndrachm of either sulphate or acetate proved fatal in four hours, with\r\nsymptoms of extreme prostration. The experiments of M. Smith, repeated\r\nby Orfila, are at variance with these; for one or two drachms of the\r\nacetate applied to a wound in the thigh of a dog caused only local\r\ninflammation, and no constitutional symptoms.[1093]\r\n\r\nIt follows from the researches now detailed, that the salts of copper\r\nact in whatever way they are introduced into the system, and the more\r\nenergetically, the more directly they enter the blood. The inquiries\r\nof Mr. Blake farther show, that when injected into the blood-vessels,\r\nthey act with peculiar force in exhausting muscular irritability, and\r\noccasion death by paralysing the heart if they are injected into a\r\nvein. Six grains of the sulphate injected into the jugular vein of a\r\ndog reduced the force of the heart’s contractions, and fifteen grains\r\narrested them in twelve seconds, leaving in the dead body distension\r\nof the heart, loss of contractility, and florid blood in the left\r\ncavities. Ten grains injected into the aorta through the axillary\r\nartery caused no sign of obstruction in the capillary system; and\r\nsmall doses of three or four grains occasioned vomiting, dyspnœa, and\r\nstiffness of the limbs; and immediately after death the muscles had\r\nlost their irritability.[1094]\r\n\r\nCopper has been sought for, with variable success, in the blood of\r\nanimals poisoned with its salts. Drouard was unable to detect it in the\r\nblood. But this need not excite surprise, because the same physiologist\r\ncould not detect it, even when he had injected it into a\r\nvein.—Lebküchner, who published a thesis at Tübingen in 1819, on the\r\npermeability of the living membranes, succeeded in discovering it. He\r\nintroduced four grains of the ammoniacal sulphate into the bronchial\r\ntubes of a cat, and five minutes afterwards, when the animal was under\r\nthe action of the poison, he drew some blood from the carotid artery and\r\njugular vein; and he detected copper in the serum of the former, but not\r\nin the latter, by sulphuretted-hydrogen and hydrosulphate of\r\nammonia.[1095]—Afterwards Dr. Wibmer of Munich also succeeded in\r\ndiscovering it. In a dog which had taken from four to twenty grains of\r\nthe neutral acetate daily for several weeks, he found the metal in the\r\nsubstance of the liver, but not anywhere else. In the charcoally matter\r\nleft by incinerating the liver, nitric acid formed a solution, which\r\nwhen neutralized gave the characteristic action of the salts of copper\r\nwith sulphuretted-hydrogen, ferro-cyanate of potash, and ammonia.[1096]\r\nFischer also found copper in the blood of a dog which in forty-three\r\ndays had got gradually-increasing doses of acetate of copper, till at\r\nlength twelve grains were taken daily.[1097] Orfila has recently often\r\ndetected copper in the liver, spleen, heart, kidneys, and lungs of\r\nanimals poisoned with its salts.[1098] These facts are not all\r\ninvalidated by the late discovery of the presence of copper in the\r\nanimal tissues of men and animals not poisoned with its preparations.\r\nFor in the experiments of Wibmer and of Orfila the quantity found in\r\ncases of poisoning was much larger than in the ordinary state of things;\r\nand the poison was accumulated in particular organs, especially the\r\nliver. The absorption of copper may therefore be considered as fully\r\nsubstantiated; and it is equally important whether it be regarded as a\r\nphysiological or medico-legal fact.\r\n\r\nDr. Duncan’s experiment on its effect when applied to a wound shows that\r\nit may prove fatal when applied externally. Yet in small quantities, the\r\nsulphate is daily used with safety for dressing ulcers.\r\n\r\nAs to the preparations of copper which are poisonous, it is pretty\r\ncertain that, like all other metals, it is not deleterious unless\r\noxidated, and that its soluble salts are by far the most energetic.\r\nPortal, indeed, has related the case of a woman who, while taking from a\r\nhalf a grain to four grains of copper filings daily, was seized with\r\nsymptoms of poisoning.[1099] But it is probable the filings were\r\noxidated; for Drouard gave an ounce to dogs without injuring them at\r\nall,[1100] and Lefortier more lately observed that two drachms had no\r\neffect.[1101] The same explanation must be given of the injury sustained\r\nby those artisans who prepare and use what is called “bronze dust” in\r\nprinting and paper-staining. If the substance employed be nothing else\r\nthan an alloy of copper and zinc, as is alleged, the injurious effects\r\nto be mentioned presently can only be explained on the supposition that\r\nthe copper becomes oxidated either before or after coming in contact\r\nwith the body. It deserves to be added, that many persons have swallowed\r\ncopper coins and retained them for weeks without having any symptoms of\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\nThe sulphuret is equally innocuous with the metal if pure; but it\r\nappears probable that it becomes oxidated by long exposure to the air,\r\nand passes into the state of sulphate. Orfila found that an ounce of\r\nrecently prepared sulphuret had no effect on a dog; but half an ounce of\r\na parcel which had been long kept caused vomiting, and yielded a little\r\nsulphate to water.[1102] The power of the oxides has not been\r\nascertained. They are certainly poisonous; and Lefortier found that both\r\nthe red dioxide and black protoxide undergo solution in no long time in\r\nthe stomachs of dogs.[1103] The hydrated protoxide is probably more\r\nactive. From some experiments made at the hospital of St. Louis in\r\nParis, it appears that twelve grains will cause nausea, pain in the\r\nstomach and bowels, vomiting and diarrhœa.[1104] There is no doubt that\r\nthe carbonate or natural verdigris, the phosphate, and even the\r\nsubphosphate, though quite insoluble in water, are capable of acting as\r\npoisons, because Lefortier found that they are soon dissolved in the\r\nstomachs of dogs, and in small doses cause severe vomiting in the course\r\nof fifteen minutes.[1105] But it is chiefly in the soluble salts that we\r\nare to look for the full development of the action of this poison. A\r\nvery small quantity of the sulphate will prove fatal; for, as already\r\nnoticed, Drouard found that six grains killed a dog in half an hour.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms caused by the soluble salts of copper in man are, in a\r\ngeneral point of view, the same with those caused by arsenic and\r\ncorrosive sublimate. But there are likewise some peculiarities.\r\nAccording to the cases related by Orfila in his Toxicology, the first\r\nsymptom is violent headache, then vomiting and cutting pains in the\r\nbowels, and afterwards cramps in the legs and pains in the thighs.\r\nSometimes throughout the whole course of the symptoms there is a\r\npeculiar coppery taste in the mouth, and a singular aversion to the\r\nsmell of copper. Drouard notices this in his thesis; and says, that,\r\nhaving himself been once poisoned with verdigris, the smell of copper\r\nused to excite nausea for a long time after.[1106] Another symptom,\r\nwhich occasionally occurs in this kind of poisoning, and never, so far\r\nas I know, in poisoning with arsenic or corrosive sublimate, is\r\njaundice. It likewise appears that, when the case ends fatally,\r\nconvulsions and insensibility generally precede death.\r\n\r\nA set of cases illustrating the slighter forms of poisoning with copper\r\nhas been published by M. Bonjean of Chambéry. The cause was the\r\npreparation of an acid confection in a copper vessel. Two women suffered\r\nfrom severe headache, constriction of the throat, nausea, colic, and\r\nextreme weakness. Two young men, who had eaten the confection more\r\nfreely, had for some hours excruciating colic, severe pain in the mouth\r\nand throat, impeded breathing, and hurried irregular pulse; and for\r\ntwenty-four hours they suffered severely from headache and prostration\r\nof strength.[1107]\r\n\r\nThe following case communicated to Professor Orfila by one of his\r\nfriends will convey a good idea of the symptoms in severe cases, which\r\ndo not prove fatal. A jeweller’s workman swallowed intentionally half an\r\nounce of verdigris, suspended in water. In fifteen minutes he was\r\nattacked with colic pains and profuse vomiting and purging. When seen by\r\nthe physician eight hours afterwards there was not much vomiting, but\r\nfrequent eructation of a matter containing verdigris, some salivation, a\r\nsmall pulse, and blueness about the eyes. In sixteen hours jaundice\r\nbegan to appear. In the course of the night he was a good deal relieved\r\nfrom the colic pains by three alvine discharges; and next morning he had\r\nceased to vomit, and the pain had disappeared. But he complained of a\r\ntaste of copper in his mouth, and the jaundice had increased. From this\r\ntime he recovered rapidly, and on the fourth day convalescence was\r\nconfirmed.[1108]\r\n\r\nWhen the poisoning ends fatally, convulsions, palsy, and insensibility,\r\nthe signs in short of some injury done to the brain, are very generally\r\npresent. This is illustrated by a good example in Pyl’s Essays and\r\nObservations. It was the case of a confectioner’s daughter, who took two\r\nounces of verdigris, and died on the third day under incessant vomiting\r\nand diarrhœa, attended towards the close with convulsions, and then with\r\npalsy of the limbs. This case, however, is chiefly valuable for the\r\ndissection, which will be noticed presently.[1109] But two cases of the\r\nsame description are related in greater detail by Wildberg in his\r\nPractical Manual, which clearly show the action of this poison on the\r\nbrain. They are the cases formerly alluded to of a lady and her daughter\r\nwho were poisoned by sour-krout kept in a copper pan. Soon after dinner\r\nthey were attacked first with pain in the stomach, then with nausea and\r\nanxiety, and next with eructation and vomiting of a green, bitter, sour,\r\nastringent matter. The pain afterwards shot downwards throughout the\r\nbelly, and was then followed by diarrhœa; afterwards by convulsions, at\r\nfirst transient, then continued; and finally by insensibility. The\r\ndaughter died in twelve hours, the mother an hour later.[1110] In these\r\nthree cases, although there was not any jaundice noticed during life,\r\nthe skin was very yellow after death.—In some instances it would appear\r\nthat narcotic symptoms form the commencement and irritant symptoms the\r\ntermination of the poisoning. This unusual relation occurs in a case of\r\nrecovery related by M. Julia-Fontenelle, and also, though less\r\nremarkably, in a fatal case mentioned by Wibmer. The subject of the\r\nformer was a man who intentionally took a solution of copper in vinegar,\r\nprepared by keeping several sous-pieces seven days in that fluid. In\r\nthree hours he was found in a state of insensibility, with the jaws\r\nlocked, the muscles rigid and frequently convulsed, the breathing\r\ninterrupted, and the pulse small and slow. In half an hour he was so far\r\nroused that he could tell what he had done; and soon after taking white\r\nof eggs the convulsions ceased: but next day the belly was hard and\r\ntender, and the repeated application of leeches was required to subdue\r\nthe abdominal irritation that ensued.[1111] In the fatal case by Wibmer,\r\nthat of a girl of 18, who was poisoned by a dish of beans having been\r\ncooked in a copper vessel, sickness, pain of the belly and vomiting\r\nspeedily arose, but were soon followed by convulsions and loss of\r\nconsciousness. Next day there was little pain, but extraordinary\r\nparalytic weakness of the arms and legs: the abdomen afterwards became\r\ndistended and painful; and death took place in seventy-eight\r\nhours.[1112]—A case where convulsions were produced by two drachms of\r\nblue vitriol is mentioned by Dr. Percival.[1113]—In other instances it\r\nwould appear that no nervous affection occurs at all, as in the case of\r\na young lady related by Percival, who, when poisoned with pickled\r\nsamphire containing copper, suffered chiefly from pains in the stomach,\r\nan eruption over the breast, general shooting pains, thirst, a frequent\r\nsmall pulse, vomiting, hiccup, and purging. Death occurred on the ninth\r\nday, without stupor or convulsions.[1114]\r\n\r\nBesides these effects when introduced in considerable doses and in the\r\nform of soluble salts, copper is said to produce other disorders when\r\napplied to the body for a long time in minute quantities and in its\r\nmetallic or oxidized state. Among those artisans who work much with\r\ncopper various affections are thought to be gradually engendered by\r\nmerely handling the metal. Patissier in his treatise on the diseases of\r\nartisans says, that copper-workers have a peculiar appearance which\r\ndistinguishes them from other tradesmen,—that they have a greenish\r\ncomplexion,—that the same colour tinges their eyes, tongue, and hair,\r\ntheir excretions, and even their clothes through the medium of the\r\nperspiration,—that they are spare, short in stature, bent, their\r\noffspring ricketty, and they themselves old and even decrepit at their\r\nfortieth or fiftieth year.[1115] Mérat also asserts that they are liable\r\nto the painters’ colic, that peculiar disease soon to be noticed as a\r\ncommon effect of the long-continued application of lead.[1116]\r\n\r\nBut these notions must be received with some limitation. At least the\r\nalleged effects on copper-workers are by no means invariable. For\r\ncopper-workers now-a days in this country and elsewhere are by no means\r\nthe unhealthy persons Patissier represents them to be. As to colica\r\npictonum, it is very rare among them; and possibly the cases noticed by\r\nMérat might have been produced by the secret introduction of lead into\r\nthe body, if indeed they were not cases of common colic.\r\n\r\nA very singular set of cases was lately brought under notice by Mr.\r\nGurney Turner, where poisoning seemed to have been occasioned by the\r\nexternal application or inhalation of the fine dust used for imitating\r\ngilding by painters, paper-stainers, and porcelain-painters, and which\r\nis said to be essentially brass in a state of fine division. The workmen\r\nwho use it, are very apt to be attacked with irritation about the\r\nprivate parts, and a vesicular eruption about the hairs on the\r\npubes,—with loss of appetite, tendency to vomiting, and other symptoms\r\nof irritation in the stomach,—with obstinate constipation,—with soreness\r\nand dryness of the throat and irritation in the nose,—and with want of\r\nsleep, and a remarkable greenness of the hair over the whole body.[1117]\r\n\r\n\r\n       SECTION III.—_Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Copper._\r\n\r\nThe appearances found in the body after death by poisoning with copper\r\nare chiefly the signs of inflammation.\r\n\r\nWhere death takes place very rapidly, however, it is probable, that no\r\ndiseased appearance whatever will be perceptible. At least this was the\r\ncase in the animals experimented on by Drouard and Orfila; and little\r\ndoubt can therefore be entertained that the result would be the same\r\nwith man also in similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen death ensues more slowly, as in the only fatal cases yet on record\r\nof its action on man, the marks of inflammation coincide with the signs\r\nof irritation during life. The best account I have seen of the morbid\r\nappearances under such circumstances is in the cases related by Pyl, by\r\nWildberg, by Wibmer, and by Dégrange.\r\n\r\nIn Pyl’s case the whole skin was yellow. The intestines, particularly\r\nthe lesser intestines, were of an unusual green colour, inflamed, and\r\nhere and there gangrenous. The stomach was also green; its inner coat\r\nwas excessively inflamed; and near the pylorus there was a spot as big\r\nas a crown, where the villous coat was thick, hard, and covered with\r\nfirmly adhering verdigris. The lungs are likewise said to have been\r\ninflamed. The blood was firmly coagulated.\r\n\r\nIn the cases related by Wildberg, which are very like each other, the\r\nskin on various parts, and particularly on the face, was yellow, but on\r\nthe depending parts livid. The outer coat of the stomach and intestines\r\nwas here and there inflamed; and the inner coat of the former was very\r\nmuch inflamed, and even gangrenous[1118] near the pylorus and cardia.\r\nThe duodenum and jejunum, and likewise the gullet, were in a similar\r\nstate. The blood in the heart and great vessels was black and fluid.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the girl referred to by Wibmer, the skin was\r\nochre-yellow, the stomach green, much inflamed, especially near the\r\npylorus, the gullet and intestines also inflamed, the diaphragm red, the\r\nbrain healthy, the lungs and heart “gorged with thick blood.”\r\n\r\nIn the case of poisoning with carbonate of copper described by Dégrange\r\n[p. 348], in which, however, it is probable that death was accelerated\r\nby a fall, there was found congestion of the surface of the brain,\r\narborescent redness of the gullet and a green sand over its surface,\r\ngeneral greenness of the villous coat of the stomach, with vascularity\r\nof the fundus and points of superficial ulceration, greenness of the\r\nwhole intestines, with black vascular ecchymosed spots and softening,\r\nexcept in the ileum, and redness of the inner surface of the heart.\r\nCopper was detected in the contents of the stomach and intestines.\r\n\r\nThe intestines have been found perforated by ulceration, and their\r\ncontents thrown out into the sac of the peritonæum. Portal has related\r\none case where the small intestines were perforated, and several where\r\nthe perforation was in the rectum, which portion of the intestines, as\r\nwell as the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, was also extensively\r\nulcerated.[1119]\r\n\r\nThe existence of verdigris in the form of powder lining the inside of\r\nthe stomach after incessant vomiting for three days, is of course an\r\nimportant circumstance in the inspection of the body. But too much\r\nreliance ought not to be placed on mere bluish or greenish colouring of\r\nthe membranes. For Orfila[1120] and Guersent[1121] have both observed,\r\nthat the inside of the stomach as well as its contents may acquire these\r\ntints in a remarkable degree in consequence of natural disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n        SECTION IV.—_Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Copper._\r\n\r\nThe treatment of poisoning with the salts of copper has been examined in\r\nrelation to the antidotes by M. Drouard, M. Marcelin-Duval, Professor\r\nOrfila, and M. Postel.\r\n\r\nThe alkaline sulphurets were at one time thought to be antidotes for the\r\npoisons of copper, but without any reason. Drouard found that fifteen\r\ngrains of verdigris killed a dog in thirty hours, notwithstanding the\r\nfree use of the liver of sulphur.[1122]\r\n\r\nAfterwards M. Marcelin-Duval was led from his experiments to infer that\r\nsugar was an antidote,[1123] and in the first editions of his Toxicology\r\nProfessor Orfila agreed with him, and related some experiments of his\r\nown, which, along with those of Duval, seemed to place the fact beyond\r\nall doubt. Later and more careful experiments, however, satisfied\r\nOrfila, that it only acts as an emollient after the poison has been\r\nremoved from the stomach, and that it has no effect at all if the poison\r\nis retained by a ligature in the gullet.[1124] Sugar being thus rejected\r\nas well as the sulphurets, he was led to try the effects of albumen; and\r\nhis experiments induced him to recommend that substance as an antidote\r\nin preference to every thing else. He found that the white of six eggs\r\ncompletely neutralized the activity of between 25 and 36 grains of\r\nverdigris; so that even when the mixture was retained in the stomach by\r\na ligature on the gullet no effect ensued which could be ascribed to the\r\npoison. He infers that white of egg is the best antidote for poisoning\r\nwith copper.[1125] He likewise found the ferro-cyanate of potass not\r\ninferior.[1126]\r\n\r\nSince the publication of these inquires the subject has been again\r\nexamined by M. Postel, who reverts to the original proposition of Duval,\r\nthat sugar is really a good antidote; and he rests this conclusion\r\npartly on direct comparative experiments, showing that it is at least\r\nequally effective with white of egg, and partly on the singular fact\r\nascertained by him, that sugar, which was believed to decompose the\r\nsalts of copper only at the temperature of 212°, does actually\r\naccomplish this decomposition at the temperature of the human body, and\r\nthrows down the copper in the form of oxide.[1127]\r\n\r\nAccording to the experiments of MM. Milne-Edwards and Dumas, metallic\r\niron is likewise a good antidote: they found that when fifteen, twenty,\r\nand even fifty grains of sulphate of copper, acetate of copper, or\r\nverdigris, were given to animals, and an ounce of iron filings\r\nadministered either immediately before, or immediately afterwards,—the\r\ngullet being tied to prevent the discharge of the poison,—death did not\r\nensue for five, six, or even eight days, and consequently proceeded from\r\nthe operation on the gullet; and that in one experiment, on the ligature\r\nbeing removed from the gullet, the opening healed up, and complete\r\nrecovery took place.[1128]\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the subject of the treatment, it is necessary to caution\r\nthe practitioner particularly against the employment of vinegar,—a\r\nsubstance often ignorantly used for this, in common with many other,\r\nspecies of poisoning. On account of its solvent power over the insoluble\r\ncompounds formed by the salts of copper with animal and vegetable\r\nmatters, it must be injurious rather than useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n                      OF POISONING WITH ANTIMONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth genus of the metallic irritants includes the preparations of\r\nantimony. Poisoning with antimonial preparations is not common. They are\r\nemployed extensively in medicine, however, and consequently accidents\r\nhave sometimes occurred with them. One of them is also often foolishly\r\nused, in the way of amusement, to cause sickness and purging, and\r\nlikewise to detect servants who are suspected of making free with their\r\nmistress’s tea-box or whisky-bottle; and in both of these ways alarming\r\neffects have sometimes been produced. In 1837 a woman was tried in\r\nEngland for attempting to poison a child with tartar-emetic; but the\r\npoison appeared to have been given through ignorance.[1129] In large\r\ndoses some of the antimonial compounds may cause death; and one of them,\r\nthe chloride of antimony, now very little used in this country, is a\r\nviolent corrosive.\r\n\r\n\r\n SECTION I.—_Of the Chemical History and Tests for the preparations of\r\n                               Antimony._\r\n\r\nMetallic antimony has a bluish-white colour, not liable to tarnish. Its\r\nspecific gravity is 6·7. It is easily fused, but is not very volatile.\r\nIn certain circumstances, however, it easily undergoes a spurious\r\nsublimation, by being carried along with gases disengaged while it is in\r\nthe act of being reduced.\r\n\r\nA great number of preparations of antimony were at one time to be found\r\nin the shop of the apothecary; but they are now reduced to a few. Those\r\nwhich require notice here are the oxide, chloride, and tartar-emetic.\r\n\r\nThe _oxide_ [sesquioxide] is a white heavy powder, which is best known\r\nby its solubility in tartaric acid, and the effects of the tests for\r\ntartar-emetic on the solution.\r\n\r\nThe _chloride_ [sesquichloride], as usually seen, is a yellow or reddish\r\nliquid, but when pure is colourless. It is highly corrosive. It is\r\nreadily known by the effect of water in decomposing it,—an insoluble\r\nwhite subchloride being thrown down, and hydrochloric acid remaining in\r\nsolution. The latter is detected by nitrate of silver; and the\r\nprecipitate is known by being soluble in a solution of tartaric acid,\r\nand then presenting the reactions of tartar-emetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Tartar-Emetic._\r\n\r\nIn its solid state tartar-emetic forms regular tetraedral or more\r\ngenerally octaedral crystals, which are colourless when pure,\r\nefflorescent, and of a slightly metallic taste. As commonly seen in the\r\nshops it is in the form of a white, or pale yellowish-white powder.\r\n\r\nWhen heated it decrepitates and then chars; and if the heat be increased\r\nthe oxide of antimony is reduced by the carbonaceous matter, and little\r\nglobules appear, like those of quicksilver in point of colour. The best\r\nway of reducing tartar-emetic is to char it in a porcelain vessel or\r\nwatch-glass, and then to increase the heat till the charred mass takes\r\nfire. Or the charred mass may be introduced into a tube and heated\r\nstrongly with the blowpipe, after which globules of antimony will be\r\nfound lining the bottom of the glass where the material has been. None\r\nof it is ever sublimed. It is not easy to procure distinct globules by\r\nheating tartar-emetic at once in a small tube.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Duncan, tartar-emetic is soluble in three parts of\r\nboiling and fifteen of temperate water. The solution presents the\r\nfollowing characters with reagents.\r\n\r\n1. _Caustic potass_ precipitates a white sesquioxide, but only if the\r\nsolution is tolerably concentrated. The first portions of the test have\r\nno effect. The precipitate is redissolved by an excess of potass.\r\n\r\n2. _Nitric acid_ throws down a white precipitate, and takes it up again\r\nwhen added in excess.\r\n\r\n3. The _Infusion of Galls_ causes a dirty, yellowish-white precipitate;\r\nbut it will not act on a solution which contains much less than two\r\ngrains per ounce.\r\n\r\n4. The best liquid reagent is _Hydrosulphuric acid_. In a solution\r\ncontaining only an eighth part of a grain per ounce, it strikes an\r\norange-red colour, which, when the excess of gas is expelled by heat,\r\nbecomes an orange-red precipitate; and if the proportion of salt is\r\ngreater, the precipitate is thrown down at once.—The colour of the\r\nprecipitate is so peculiar as to distinguish it from every other\r\nsulphuret; but if any doubt regarding its nature should occur, it may be\r\nknown by collecting it, dissolving it with the aid of gentle heat in\r\nhydrochloric acid, and adding water to the solution; which will then\r\nyield a white precipitate, the sesquioxide of antimony in union with a\r\nlittle chlorine.\r\n\r\n5. When the solution is put into Marsh’s apparatus for detecting arsenic\r\n[p. 211], the flame yields a dark brownish-black, obscurely shining\r\ncrust on a surface of porcelain held across it, and a white crystalline\r\npowder if the porcelain be held just above the flame. The dark crust is\r\nantimony, the white one its oxide. The former has only a distant\r\nresemblance to the brilliant stain of arsenic, notwithstanding all that\r\nhas been said of their similarity. It is well, however, to use some\r\nother test for distinguishing the two metals besides their appearance;\r\nand the most convenient is a solution of chloride of lime, which\r\ninstantly makes an arsenical crust disappear, but does not affect an\r\nantimonial one.\r\n\r\nTartar-emetic, like the soluble salts of mercury and copper, is\r\ndecomposed by various organic principles. All vegetable substances that\r\ncontain a considerable quantity of tannin have this effect; of which an\r\nexample has been already mentioned in the action of infusion of galls.\r\nDecoctions of cinchona-bark decompose it still more effectually. The\r\nanimal principles do not act on tartar-emetic, with the exception of\r\nmilk, which is slightly coagulated by a concentrated solution. Many\r\nvegetable and animal substances, though they do not decompose it, alter\r\nthe operation of the fluid tests. Thus tea, though it does not effect\r\nany distinct decomposition of the salt, will prevent the action of\r\ngall-infusion; and French wine gives a violet tint to the precipitates\r\nwith that test and with acids.[1130] Hydrosulphuric acid, however, acts\r\nunder all circumstances, and always characteristically, whatever the\r\ncolour of the fluid may be. Dr. Turner found that when transmitted\r\nthrough a diluted solution in tea, porter, broth, and milk, with certain\r\nprecautions to be mentioned presently, he procured a precipitate which\r\neither showed its proper colour at once, or did so at the margin of the\r\nfilter on which it was collected.[1131]\r\n\r\nThe circumstances now referred to render it necessary to resort to other\r\nmeans, besides the simple application of liquid reagents, for the\r\npurpose of detecting tartar-emetic in complex organic mixtures. This\r\nsubject has been ably investigated, first by Dr. Turner,[1132] and\r\nafterwards by Professor Orfila.[1133] The result of the researches of\r\nboth seems to me to be that the most convenient method yet proposed is\r\nthe following.\r\n\r\n_Process for Tartar-emetic in Organic Mixtures._—If the subject of\r\nanalysis be not already liquid enough, add distilled water. Then\r\nacidulate with a little hydrochloric and tartaric acids; the former of\r\nwhich throws down some animal principles, while the latter dissolves\r\nreadily all precipitates formed with tartar-emetic by reagents or\r\norganic principles except the sulphuret. Filter the product.\r\n\r\n1. Subject a small portion of the liquid to a stream of hydrosulphuric\r\nacid gas, and if it be perceptibly coloured orange-red, treat the whole\r\nliquid in the same way; boil to expel the excess of gas, collect the\r\nprecipitate, dry it, and reduce it by hydrogen gas in the following\r\nmanner. Put the sulphuret in a little horizontal tube, transmit hydrogen\r\nthrough the tube by means of the apparatus represented in Figure 9, and\r\nwhen all the air of the apparatus is expelled, apply heat to the\r\nsulphuret with a spirit-lamp. Hydrosulphuric acid gas is evolved, and\r\nmetallic antimony is left, if the current of hydrogen be gentle, or it\r\nis sublimed if the current be rapid.—When there is much animal or\r\nvegetable matter present in the sulphuret, the metal is not always\r\ndistinctly visible. In that case, dissolve the antimony by the action of\r\nnitric acid on the mixed material and broken fragments of the tube, and\r\nthrow down the orange sulphuret again from the neutralized solution by\r\nhydrosulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n2. If hydrosulphuric acid do not distinctly affect the liquid, or if no\r\nprecipitate be separated after boiling, or so small a quantity as cannot\r\nwell be collected,—evaporate the liquid to dryness, char it by means of\r\nnitric acid and chlorate of potash, as directed for copper (p. 357),\r\nboil the carbonaceous mass for half an hour in a mixture of eight parts\r\nof hydrochloric acid and one of nitric acid, and introduce the filtered\r\nsolution into the modification of Marsh’s apparatus for detecting\r\narsenic described in page 204, but without the tube _e h_. Kindle the\r\ngas at _e_, and try whether a black, dull stain, not removable by\r\nsolution of chloride of lime, be produced on a surface of porcelain held\r\nacross the flame. If no stain be produced, there was no antimony in the\r\nliquid under examination. If the porcelain be stained, apply the heat of\r\na spirit-lamp flame to the tube _d e_. Antimony will be deposited within\r\nthe tube where the heat is applied. In order to ascertain its nature,\r\nbreak the tube, heat the portion containing the crust with\r\nnitro-hydrochloric acid, evaporate to dryness, dissolve the residue in\r\nhydrochloric acid, decompose a part of this solution with water, and\r\nsubject the rest to a stream of hydrosulphuric acid gas, which will\r\nproduce the usual orange sulphuret of antimony.\r\n\r\n3. If antimony be not indicated in either of these ways in the fluid\r\npart of the subject of analysis, the solid portion may next be subjected\r\nto the second process; but success will very seldom attend the search\r\nwhen the previous steps have failed.\r\n\r\nThe first branch of this process,—a slight modification of Dr.\r\nTurner’s,—is a very delicate and satisfactory method of detecting\r\nantimony in organic mixtures. Some practice is required to transmit the\r\nhydrogen gas with the proper rapidity. The gas ought to be allowed to\r\npass for some time before the spirit-lamp flame is applied, otherwise\r\nthe oxygen remaining in the apparatus may cause an explosion, or will\r\noxidate the metallic antimony, formed by the reduction of the sulphuret.\r\nAs soon as the reduction of the sulphuret begins, the tube is blackened\r\non account of the action of the sulphuretted-hydrogen on the lead\r\ncontained in the glass. This obscures the operations within the tube;\r\nbut on subsequently breaking it, a metallic button or a sublimate will\r\nbe easily seen. When the sulphuret is considerable in quantity and the\r\ngaseous current slow, the metal remains where the sulphuret was; but if\r\nthe mass of sulphuret is small and the current rapid, then the metal is\r\nsublimed and condensed in minute scaly brilliant crystals.\r\n\r\nThe second branch of the process is a modification of the method lately\r\nemployed by Professor Orfila for detecting antimony in the textures and\r\nsecretions of animals poisoned with tartar-emetic. It is probably more\r\ndelicate than the other, but not more satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe method of analysis here recommended, as well as every other yet\r\nproposed for organic mixtures, merely detects the presence of antimony.\r\nIt does not indicate the state in which the metal was combined. It is a\r\nprocess in short for antimony in every state of combination.\r\n\r\nIt is almost unnecessary to observe that when the contents of the\r\nstomach or vomited matters are the subject of analysis, care must be\r\ntaken to ascertain that tartar-emetic was not administered as a remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—_Of the Action of Tartar-Emetic, and the Symptoms it excites\r\n                                in Man._\r\n\r\nThere is little peculiarity in what is hitherto known of the symptoms of\r\npoisoning with tartar-emetic in man. Cases in which it has been taken to\r\nthe requisite extent are rarely met with; and it has seldom remained\r\nlong enough in the stomach to act deleteriously. But its action on\r\nanimals would appear from the experiments of Magendie to be in some\r\nrespects peculiar.\r\n\r\nHe found that dogs, like man, may take a large dose with impunity, for\r\nexample half an ounce, if they are allowed to vomit; but that if the\r\ngullet is tied, from four to eight grains will kill them in a few hours.\r\nHis subsequent experiments go to prove that death is owing to the poison\r\nexciting inflammation in the lungs. When six or eight grains dissolved\r\nin water were injected into a vein, the animal was attacked with\r\nvomiting and purging, and death ensued commonly within an hour. In the\r\ndead body he found not only redness of the whole villous coat of the\r\nstomach and intestines, but also that the lungs were of an orange-red or\r\nviolet colour throughout, destitute of crepitation, gorged with blood,\r\ndense like the spleen, and here and there even hepatized. A larger\r\nquantity caused death more rapidly without affecting the alimentary\r\ncanal; a smaller quantity caused intense inflammation there and death in\r\ntwenty-four hours; but the lungs were always more or less\r\naffected.[1134]\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, too, worthy of notice, that in whatever way this poison\r\nenters the body its effects are nearly the same. This is shown not only\r\nby the researches of Magendie already mentioned, but likewise by the\r\nexperiments of Schloepfer, who found that a scruple dissolved in twelve\r\nparts of water and injected into the windpipe, caused violent vomiting,\r\ndifficult breathing, and death in three days; and in the dead body the\r\nlungs and stomach were much inflamed, particularly the former.[1135] It\r\nfarther appears from an experiment related by Dr. Campbell, that, when\r\napplied to a wound, it acts with almost equal energy as when injected\r\ninto a vein. Five grains killed a cat in this way in three hours,\r\ncausing inflammation of the wound, and vivid redness of the\r\nstomach.[1136] He did not find the lungs inflamed.\r\n\r\nMagendie infers from his own researches that tartar-emetic occasions\r\ndeath when swallowed, not by inflaming the stomach, but through means of\r\na general inflammatory state of the whole system subsequent to its\r\nabsorption,—of which disorder the affection of the stomach and\r\nintestines and even that of the lungs are merely parts or symptoms. The\r\nlater experiments of Rayer tend in some measure to confirm these views,\r\nby showing that death may occur without inflammation being excited any\r\nwhere. In animals killed in twenty-five minutes by tartar-emetic applied\r\nto a wound, he, like Dr. Campbell, could see no trace of inflammation in\r\nany organ of the great cavities.[1137]\r\n\r\nOrfila has proved by analysis the important fact that tartar-emetic is\r\nabsorbed in the course of its action, and may be detected in the animal\r\ntissues and secretions. He found that, when it is applied to the\r\ncellular tissue of small dogs, two grains disappear before death: That\r\nantimony may be detected by his process given above throughout the soft\r\ntextures generally, but especially in the liver and kidneys: but that it\r\nis quickly discharged from these quarters through the medium of the\r\nurine. Hence in an animal that died in four hours he found it abundantly\r\nin the liver and still more in the urine; in one that survived seventeen\r\nhours, the liver presented mere traces of the poison, but the urine\r\ncontained it in abundance; and in one that lived thirty-six hours, there\r\nwas a large quantity in the urine, but none at all in the liver. He also\r\nascertained that antimony is generally to be found in the urine of\r\npersons who are taking tartar-emetic continuously in large doses for\r\npneumonia according to Rasori’s mode of administering it.[1138] These\r\nresults have been confirmed by the conjoined researches of Panizza and\r\nKramer, who found antimony in the urine and blood of a man during a\r\ncourse of tartar-emetic.[1139] And Flandin and Danger also satisfied\r\nthemselves that in animals it may be generally detected in the\r\nliver.[1140]\r\n\r\n_Effects on Man._—When tartar-emetic is swallowed by man, it generally\r\ncauses vomiting very soon and is all discharged; and then no other\r\neffect follows. But if it remains long in the stomach before it excites\r\nvomiting, or if the dose be large, more permanent symptoms are sometimes\r\ninduced. The vomiting recurs frequently, and is attended with burning\r\npain in the pit of the stomach, and followed by purging and colic pains.\r\nThere is sometimes a sense of tightness in the throat, which may be so\r\ngreat as to prevent swallowing. The patient is likewise tormented with\r\nviolent cramps. Among the cases hitherto recorded no notice is taken of\r\npulmonary symptoms; which might be expected to occur if Magendie’s\r\nexperiments are free of fallacy.\r\n\r\nThe late introduction of large doses of tartar-emetic into medical\r\npractice having excited some doubt as to its poisonous properties, it\r\nbecomes a matter of some moment to possess positive facts on the\r\nsubject. The following cases may therefore be quoted, which will satisfy\r\nevery one that this substance is sometimes an active irritant.\r\n\r\nThe first is particularly interesting from its close resemblance to\r\ncholera. It occurred in consequence of an apothecary having sold\r\ntartar-emetic by mistake for cream of tartar. The quantity taken was\r\nabout a scruple. A few moments afterwards the patient complained of pain\r\nin the stomach, then of a tendency to faint, and at last he was seized\r\nwith violent bilious vomiting. Soon after that he felt colic pains\r\nextending throughout the whole bowels, and accompanied ere long with\r\nprofuse and unceasing diarrhœa. The pulse at the same time was small and\r\ncontracted, and his strength failed completely; but the symptom which\r\ndistressed him most was frequent rending cramp in the legs. He remained\r\nin this state for about six hours, and then recovered gradually under\r\nthe use of cinchona and opium; but for some time afterwards he was\r\nliable to weakness of digestion.[1141]\r\n\r\nThe next case to be mentioned, where the dose was forty grains, proved\r\nfatal, although the person vomited soon after taking it. The symptoms\r\nillustrate well the compound narcotico-acrid action often observed in\r\nanimals. The poison was taken voluntarily. Before the person was seen by\r\nM. Récamier, who relates the case, he had been nearly two days ill with\r\nvomiting, excessive purging, and convulsions. On the third day he had\r\ngreat pain and tension in the region of the stomach, and appeared like a\r\nman in a state of intoxication. In the course of the day the whole belly\r\nbecame swelled, and at night delirium supervened. Next day all the\r\nsymptoms were aggravated; towards evening the delirium became furious;\r\nconvulsions followed; and he died during the night, not quite five days\r\nafter taking the poison.[1142]\r\n\r\nSevere effects have also been caused by so small a dose as six grains. A\r\nwoman, who swallowed this quantity, wrapped in paper, was seized in half\r\nan hour with violent vomiting, which soon became bloody. In two hours\r\nthe decoction of cinchona was administered with much relief. But she had\r\nsevere colic, diarrhœa, pain in the stomach, and some fever; of which\r\nsymptoms she was not completely cured for five days.[1143] A case has\r\nbeen published, where a dose of only four grains caused pain in the\r\nbelly, vomiting, and purging, followed by convulsions, failure of the\r\npulse, and loss of speech; and recovery took place very slowly.[1144]\r\nUnder the head of the treatment another case will be noticed where half\r\na drachm excited severe symptoms, and was probably prevented from\r\nproving fatal only by the timely use of antidotes.\r\n\r\nWhile these examples prove that tartar-emetic is occasionally an active\r\nirritant in the dose of a scruple or less, it must at the same time be\r\nadmitted to be uncertain in its action as a poison. This appears from\r\nthe late employment of it in large doses as a remedy for inflammation of\r\nthe lungs. The administration of tartar-emetic in large doses was a\r\ncommon enough practice so early as the seventeenth century, and was also\r\noccasionally resorted to by physicians between that and the present\r\ntime. But it is only in late years that, by the recommendations of\r\nProfessor Rasori of Milan,[1145] and M. Laennec of Paris, it has again\r\nbecome a general method of treatment. According to this method,\r\ntartar-emetic is given to the extent of twelve, twenty, or even thirty\r\ngrains a day in divided doses; and not only without producing any\r\ndangerous irritation of the alimentary canal, but even also not\r\nunfrequently without any physiological effect whatever. Doubts were at\r\none time entertained of the accuracy of the statements to this effect\r\npublished by foreign physicians; but these doubts are now dissipated, as\r\nthe same practice has been tried, with the same results, by many in\r\nBritain. Rasori ascribes the power the body possesses of enduring large\r\ndoses of tartar-emetic without injury, to a peculiar diathesis which\r\naccompanies the disease and ceases along with it. And it is said, that\r\nthe same patients, who, while the disorder continues, may take large\r\ndoses with impunity, are affected in the usual manner, if the doses are\r\nnot rapidly lessened after the disease has begun to give way. The\r\ntestimony of Laennec on the subject is impartial and decisive. He\r\nobserves he has given as much as two grains and a half every two hours\r\ntill twenty grains were taken daily, and once gave forty grains in\r\ntwenty-four hours by mistake; that he never saw any harm result; and\r\nthat vomiting or diarrhœa was seldom produced, and never after the first\r\nday. The power of endurance he found to diminish, but not, as Rasori\r\nalleges, to cease altogether, when the fever ceases; for some of his\r\npatients took six, twelve, or eighteen grains daily when in full\r\nconvalescence.[1146] My own observations correspond with Laennec’s,\r\nexcept as to the effects of large doses during convalescence, of which\r\neffects I have had no experience. I have seen from six to twenty grains,\r\ngiven daily in several doses of one or two grains, check bad cases of\r\npneumonia and bronchitis, without causing vomiting or diarrhœa after the\r\nfirst day, and also without increasing the perspiration. At the same\r\ntime I have twice seen the first two or three doses excite so violent a\r\npurging and pain in the stomach and whole bowels, that I was deterred\r\nfrom persevering with the remedy. In continued fever too I have\r\nrepeatedly found that the doses mentioned above did not cause any\r\nsymptoms of irritation in the stomach or intestines.\r\n\r\nThe large quantities now mentioned have even been sometimes given in a\r\nsingle dose with nearly the same results. Dr. Christie mentions in his\r\nTreatise on Cholera that he sometimes gave a scruple in one dose with\r\nthe effect of exciting merely some vomiting and several watery stools.\r\nBut he admits that in one instance symptoms were induced like those of a\r\ncase of violent cholera.[1147]\r\n\r\nThe same large doses have been given by some in delirium tremens without\r\nany poisonous effect being produced. A correspondent of the Lancet has\r\neven mentioned that on one occasion, after gradually increasing the\r\ndose, he at last wound up the treatment, successfully as regarded the\r\ndisease, and without any injury to the patient, by giving four doses of\r\ntwenty grains each, in the course of twenty minutes.[1148]\r\n\r\nThese facts are sufficiently perplexing, when viewed along with what\r\nwere previously quoted in support of the poisonous effects of\r\ntartar-emetic. On a full consideration of the whole circumstances,\r\nhowever, I conceive the conclusion which will be drawn is, that this\r\nsubstance is not so active a poison as was till lately supposed;—that in\r\nthe dose of four, six, or ten grains, it may cause severe symptoms, but\r\nis uncertain in its action,—and that although there appears to be some\r\nuncertainty in the effects of even much larger doses, such as a scruple,\r\nyet in general violent irritation will then be induced, and sometimes\r\ndeath itself.\r\n\r\nAn instance is related in the Journal Universel of a man who, while in a\r\nstate of health, swallowed seventeen grains, and then tried to suffocate\r\nhimself with the fumes of burning charcoal. He recovered, though not\r\nwithout suffering severely from the charcoal fumes; but he could hardly\r\nbe said to have been affected at all by the tartar-emetic.[1149] Here\r\nthe inactivity of the poison was probably owing to the narcotic effects\r\nof the fumes.\r\n\r\nThe effects of tartar-emetic on the skin are worthy of notice; but they\r\nhave not yet been carefully studied. Some facts tend to show that even\r\nits constitutional action may be developed through the sound skin. Mr.\r\nSherwen attempted to prove by experiments on himself and two pupils,\r\nthat five or seven grains in solution will, when rubbed on the palms,\r\nproduce in a few hours nausea and copious perspiration.[1150] His\r\nobservations have been confirmed by Mr. Hutchinson.[1151] But Savary, a\r\nFrench physician, on repeating these experiments, could remark nothing\r\nmore than a faint flat taste and slight salivation;[1152] and Mr.\r\nGaitskell could not remark any constitutional effect at all.[1153]\r\nSometimes it has appeared to cause severe symptoms of irritant poisoning\r\nwhen used in the form of ointment to excite a pustular eruption. An\r\ninstance of this has been described in a late French Journal.[1154] Nay,\r\nin the Medical Repository there is a case, in which the external use of\r\ntartar-emetic ointment is supposed to have been the cause of death. The\r\nsubject was an infant, two years old, who, soon after having the spine\r\nrubbed with this ointment, was seized with great sickness and frequent\r\nfainting, which in forty-eight hours proved fatal.[1155] Considering the\r\nnumerous opportunities which medical men have had of witnessing the\r\neffects of tartar-emetic applied in the same manner, and that these are\r\nsolitary cases, doubts may be entertained whether the irritant symptoms\r\nin the one case, or the child’s death in the other, were occasioned in\r\nthe way supposed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the constitutional action of tartar-emetic is not easily\r\ndeveloped through the sound skin, its local effects are severe and\r\nunequivocal. When applied to the skin it does not corrode, but excites\r\ninflammation, on which account it is much used instead of cantharides.\r\nIt does not blister; but after being a few days applied, it brings out a\r\nnumber of painful pustules; if it be persevered in, the skin ulcerates;\r\nand if it be applied to an ulcerated surface it causes profuse\r\nsuppuration, or sometimes even sloughing.\r\n\r\nTartar-emetic is one of the substances which appear to possess the\r\nproperty of acting on the infant through the medium of its nurse’s milk.\r\nI do not know, indeed, what may be the general experience on this point;\r\nbut a French physician, M. Minaret, has published a clear case of the\r\nkind, in the instance of a young woman who was taking tartar-emetic for\r\npleurisy, and whose infant was attacked with a fit of vomiting\r\nimmediately after every attempt to suck the breast.[1156]\r\n\r\nThere is some reason to suppose, that the vapours of antimony may prove\r\ninjurious when inhaled. Four persons, constantly exposed in preparing\r\nantimonial compounds to the vapour of antimonious acid and chloride of\r\nantimony, were attacked with headache, difficult breathing, stitches in\r\nthe back and sides, difficult expectoration of viscid mucus, want of\r\nsleep and appetite, mucous discharge from the urethra, loss of sexual\r\npropensity, atrophy of the testicles, and a pustular eruption on various\r\nparts, but especially on the scrotum. They all recovered.[1157]\r\n\r\n\r\n  SECTION III.—_Of the Morbid Appearances produced by Tartar-emetic._\r\n\r\nThe morbid appearances caused by tartar-emetic have not been often\r\nwitnessed in man.\r\n\r\nIn M. Récamier’s case there were some equivocal signs of reaction in the\r\nbrain. The organs in the chest were healthy. The villous coat of the\r\nstomach, except near the gullet, where it was healthy, was everywhere\r\nred, thickened, and covered with tough mucus. The whole intestines were\r\ncompletely empty. The duodenum was in the same state as the stomach; but\r\nthe other intestines were in their natural condition.\r\n\r\nM. Jules Cloquet observed in the body of a man who died of apoplexy, and\r\nwho in the course of five days had taken forty grains of tartar-emetic,\r\nwithout vomiting or purging,—that the villous coat of the stomach had a\r\ndeep reddish-violet colour, with cherry-red spots interspersed; and that\r\nthe whole small intestines were of a rose-red tint spotted with\r\ncherry-red.[1158]\r\n\r\nThe only other dissection I have seen noticed is one by Hoffmann. He\r\nsays that in a woman poisoned by tartar-emetic he found the stomach\r\ngangrenous, and the lungs, diaphragm, and spleen as it were in a state\r\nof putrefaction.[1159] Little credit can be given to this description.\r\n\r\nIn animals Schloepfer found the blood always fluid.[1160]\r\n\r\n\r\n       SECTION IV.—_Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Antimony._\r\n\r\nThe treatment of poisoning with tartar-emetic is simple. If the poison\r\nbe not already discharged, large draughts of warm water should be given\r\nand the throat tickled, to bring on vomiting. At the same time some\r\nvegetable decoction should be prepared, which possesses the power of\r\ndecomposing the poison; and none is better or more likely to be at hand\r\nthan a decoction of cinchona-bark, particularly yellow-bark. The\r\ntincture is also a good form for giving this antidote. The\r\nadministration of bark has been found useful even after vomiting had\r\ncontinued for some length of time, probably because a part of the poison\r\nnevertheless remained undischarged. Before the decoction is ready, it is\r\nuseful to administer the bark in powder. It is alleged, however, by M.\r\nToulmouche that decoction of cinchona is not nearly so serviceable as\r\ninfusion of galls, and that powder of galls is better still.[1161] When\r\nthere is reason to believe that the patient has vomited enough, and that\r\na sufficient quantity of the antidote has been taken, opium is evidently\r\nindicated and has been found useful; but venesection may be previously\r\nnecessary if the signs of inflammation in the stomach are obstinate.\r\n\r\nThe following case related by M. Serres was probably cured by cinchona.\r\nAt all events, the effect of the antidote was striking. A man purchased\r\nhalf a drachm in divided doses at different shops, and swallowed the\r\nwhole in a cup of coffee. Very soon afterwards he was attacked with\r\nburning pain in the stomach, convulsive tremors, and impaired\r\nsensibility,—afterwards with cold clamminess of the skin, hiccup, and\r\nsome swelling of the epigastrium, but not with vomiting. Decoction of\r\ncinchona was given freely. From the first moment almost of its\r\nadministration he felt relief, and began to sweat and purge. Next\r\nmorning, however, he vomited, and for some days there were evident signs\r\nof slight inflammation in the stomach; nay, for a month afterwards he\r\nhad occasional pricking pains in that region; but he eventually\r\nrecovered.[1162] Another and more pointed case has been related by Dr.\r\nSauveton of Lyons. A lady swallowed by mistake for whey a solution of\r\nsixty grains of tartar emetic. In ten minutes she was seen by her\r\nphysician, and at this time vomiting had not commenced. Tincture of bark\r\nwas immediately given in large doses. No unpleasant symptom occurred\r\nexcept nausea and slight colic.[1163]\r\n\r\nOrfila considers that the diuretic plan of treatment recommended by him\r\nfor arsenic [p. 288] is equally applicable in the case of antimony.\r\nHaving ascertained that a grain and a half of tartar-emetic applied to a\r\nwound constantly killed dogs in a period varying from seventeen to\r\nthirty-six hours, if no treatment was employed,—he administered to them\r\nin this way a dose varying from a grain and a half to three grains, and\r\nby then giving diuretics effected a cure in four out of five\r\ninstances.[1164]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Chloride of Antimony._\r\n\r\nThe chloride of antimony [sesquichloride, muriate, or butter of\r\nantimony] being now put to little use and seldom seen except as an\r\nintermediate product obtained in the preparation of other compounds of\r\nantimony, it is rarely met with as the cause of poisoning, and therefore\r\nscarcely deserves notice here, were it not that its effects differ\r\nwidely from those of tartar-emetic and other antimonials.\r\n\r\nIt is easily known by the characters mentioned above. It has not yet\r\nbeen made the subject of investigation by experiments on the lower\r\nanimals. Mr. Taylor has collected three cases of poisoning with it,\r\nwhich show that it is a powerful corrosive and irritant, and that its\r\neffects, as hitherto witnessed, seem to depend entirely on this action.\r\nIn one instance, that of a boy, twelve years old, who swallowed four or\r\nfive drachms of the solution by mistake for ginger-beer, the symptoms\r\nwere vomiting in half an hour, then faintness and extreme feebleness,\r\nand next day heat in the mouth and throat, difficulty in swallowing,\r\nslight abrasions of the lining membrane of the mouth, and general fever;\r\nbut he got quite well in eight days. In the case of another boy, ten\r\nyears old, who got about the same quantity by mistake for antimonial\r\nwine, there was an immediate sense of choking and inability to speak,\r\nthen vomiting and pain in the throat, next a general state of collapse,\r\nwith dilated pupils and a tendency to stupor, and on the subsequent day\r\nbright scarlet patches on the throat, with difficulty of swallowing.\r\nThis patient also recovered completely in a few days. The third was the\r\ncase of a surgeon who took intentionally between two and three fluid\r\nounces, and was found in an hour by his medical attendant in a state of\r\ngreat prostration, and affected with severe efforts to vomit, violent\r\ngriping, and urgent tenesmus. Reaction soon ensued, the pain abated, and\r\nthe pulse rose to 120; a strong tendency to doze succeeded; and in ten\r\nhours and a half he expired. The whole inside of the alimentary canal,\r\nfrom the mouth to the jejunum, was black as if charred; the mucous\r\nmembrane seemed to have been removed along the whole of this extent of\r\nthe canal; and the submucous and peritoneal coats were so soft as to be\r\neasily torn with the finger.[1165]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n OF POISONING WITH TIN, SILVER, GOLD, BISMUTH, CHROME, ZINC, AND IRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral other metallic compounds produce effects analogous to those of\r\nthe preparations of arsenic, copper, mercury, and antimony. But they may\r\nbe passed over shortly; because they are little known as poisons, and it\r\nis therefore only necessary that their leading properties be mentioned.\r\nThey are the compounds of tin, silver, gold, bismuth, chrome, zinc, and\r\niron.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Of Poisoning with Tin._\r\n\r\nThe chlorides of _tin_ are used in the arts of colour-making and dyeing,\r\nand the oxide of tin forms part of the putty-powder used for staining\r\nglass and polishing silver plate.\r\n\r\nThere are two chlorides, the protochloride and bichloride. They both\r\nform acicular crystals, which are very soluble. It is needless to notice\r\ntheir tests or chemical history; but in order that the following account\r\nof their effects on man and animals may be understood, it is necessary\r\nto mention, that they are decomposed by almost all vegetable infusions\r\nand animal fluids.\r\n\r\nOrfila found, that a solution of six grains of the protochloride\r\ninjected into the jugular vein of a dog killed it in one minute,—that\r\ntwo grains caused death by tetanus in fifteen minutes,—and that so small\r\na quantity as half a grain caused death in twelve hours, the only\r\nsymptoms being somnolency and catalepsy or fixedness of position.\r\n\r\nTo these dreadful effects when introduced into the blood, its effects\r\nwhen swallowed are not nearly proportionate. From eighteen to forty-four\r\ngrains killed dogs in one, two, or three days, efforts to vomit and\r\ngreat depression being the only symptoms; and after death the stomach\r\nwas found excessively inflamed, and sometimes ulcerated. Its effects\r\nwhen applied externally are still less violent. Two drachms applied to a\r\nwound merely caused violent inflammation and sloughing of the part, and\r\ndeath in twelve days, without any internal symptom during life or\r\nappearance after death.[1166]\r\n\r\nThese phenomena, considered along with the violent symptoms excited when\r\nthe poison is injected into the veins, show that, when swallowed or\r\napplied outwardly, it acts only as a local irritant.\r\n\r\nTin is absorbed in the course of its action, and may be detected in the\r\nliver, spleen, and urine, by boiling them in water acidulated with\r\nhydrochloric acid, evaporating the decoction to dryness, charring the\r\nresidue by means of nitric acid as directed for copper, treating the\r\ncarbonaceous mass with a mixture of twenty parts of hydrochloric acid\r\nand one of nitric acid, evaporating the solution to dryness so as to\r\nexpel any excess of acid, dissolving what is left in hydrochloric acid\r\ndiluted with twice its volume of water, and then transmitting\r\nhydrosulphuric acid gas. If the precipitated sulphuret of tin has not a\r\nfine yellow colour, it must be heated with a little strong nitric acid;\r\nafter which, if the residuum be again dissolved in diluted hydrochloric\r\nacid, a characteristic yellow bisulphuret will be thrown down by\r\nhydrosulphuric acid gas. This process may be applied to all organic\r\nmixtures containing tin.[1167]\r\n\r\nThe oxide of tin, according to Schubarth, is quite inactive; for he gave\r\nan entire drachm to a dog without being able to observe any effect from\r\nit whatever.[1168] This is what would be expected from its extreme\r\ninsolubility. Yet Orfila has stated in the early editions of his\r\nToxicology, and repeats in that of 1843, but without noticing the\r\ncontradictory observations of Schubarth, that one or two drachms of the\r\noxide occasion in dogs all the phenomena of irritant poisoning, and\r\nprove invariably fatal.[1169]\r\n\r\nThe metal has been proved by Bayen and Charlard to be inactive.[1170] It\r\nhas been given expressly to dogs without any effect being observed; and\r\nit is given in large doses to man for worms, without detriment. No\r\nimportance therefore can be attached to some alleged cases of poisoning\r\nwith this metal.[1171]\r\n\r\nCases of poisoning with the preparations of tin are rare. Orfila briefly\r\nnotices a set of cases which occurred to M. Guersent. Several persons in\r\na family took the protochloride, in consequence of the cook having\r\nmistaken a packet of it for salt and dressed their dinner with it. They\r\nhad all colic, some of them diarrhœa; none vomited; and all recovered in\r\na few days.[1172] A case is related in the Medical Times of death\r\napparently caused by so small a quantity as half a tea-spoonful of a\r\nsolution of protochloride. The effects were vomiting, acute pain in the\r\nstomach, anxiety, restlessness, thirst, and a frequent, hard, small\r\npulse. These symptoms increased next day; and on the third day death\r\ntook place, preceded by delirium.[1173] As this was a case of suicide,\r\nit is probable that some other poison, or a larger dose of the chloride\r\nof tin was taken.\r\n\r\nLittle need be said of the morbid appearances. Besides the signs of\r\nviolent irritation caused by the poisons of tin in common with other\r\nirritants, Orfila always found in dogs a peculiar tanned appearance of\r\nthe villous coat of the stomach. In the case from the Medical Times the\r\ngullet was red, the stomach inflamed externally, and internally\r\nthickened, vascular, and pulpy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Of Poisoning with Silver._\r\n\r\nOf the preparations of _silver_, the only one which requires notice is\r\nthe nitrate or lunar caustic.\r\n\r\nIt exists in two forms,—crystallized in broad, transparent, colourless\r\ntables,—and fused into cylindrical, crystalline, grayish pencils. Both\r\nforms are essentially the same in chemical nature.—The most convenient\r\ntests are, 1, _Hydrochloric acid_, or any hydrochlorate, which even in a\r\nstate of extreme dilution causes with it a dense white precipitate,\r\npassing, under exposure to light, into dark brown; and 2, _Ammonia_,\r\nfollowed by the solution of oxide of arsenic; if the nitrate of silver\r\nis not too much diluted it gives a dark brown precipitate with ammonia,\r\nsoluble, however, in an excess of that alkali; and when the solution has\r\nthus been restored, arsenic throws down a lively yellow precipitate,\r\npassing rapidly to brown, if left exposed to the light.\r\n\r\nMost organic substances, but in particular all animal fluids, with the\r\nexception of gelatin, decompose nitrate of silver.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the experiments of Orfila, that, like the chlorides of\r\ntin, the nitrate of silver is a deadly poison when introduced into the\r\nveins; but that, by reason of its facility of decomposition, it cannot\r\nenter the blood through ordinary channels in a quantity sufficient to\r\ndevelope any remote action. When two grains in solution were injected\r\ninto the jugular vein of a dog it died in six minutes, difficult\r\nrespiration being the chief symptom; the third part of a grain caused\r\ndeath in four hours and a half, violent tetanus having preceded death;\r\nand in both animals the blood in the heart was found very black and the\r\nlungs gorged, or vivid red. According to Mr. Blake, the salts of silver\r\nwhen directly introduced into the blood, do not act on the heart, but\r\noperate by causing obstruction of the capillary system. If they are\r\ninjected into the aorta, the systemic capillaries are obstructed, the\r\nnervous system is consequently oppressed, respiration is arrested\r\nthrough the medium of this nervous oppression, and death takes place by\r\nasphyxia, the heart continuing to beat vigorously. If again they are\r\ninjected into a great vein, immediate obstruction of the pulmonary\r\ncapillaries takes place, so that the blood ceases to be transmitted to\r\nthe left side of the heart.[1174]\r\n\r\nTo the violent action exerted by nitrate of silver when directly\r\nadmitted into the blood, its effects through the medium of the stomach\r\nbear no proportion or resemblance. Thus, when twelve grains of the salt\r\nwere introduced into the stomach in the solid state, its effects were so\r\nslight as not to be distinguishable from those of the ligature on the\r\ngullet practised to prevent its discharge by vomiting. When introduced\r\nin a state of solution, however, and in a larger dose, in the dose of 36\r\ngrains, for example, it is more energetic. Death ensued in thirty-six\r\nhours, but without any particular symptoms; and in the dead body the\r\nvillous coat of the stomach was found generally softened, and corroded\r\nnear the pylorus by little grayish eschars like those formed by this\r\npoison on the skin.[1175]\r\n\r\nHence it appears that nitrate of silver does not act remotely, but\r\nsimply as a local irritant and corrosive. The corrosion it produces is\r\nincompatible with its absorption in large quantity. This inference is\r\nconfirmed by the experiments of Schloepfer, on its effects when\r\nintroduced into the trachea. He found that it caused inflammation of the\r\nwindpipe, and pneumonia passing on to hepatization of the lungs, but no\r\nsymptom referrible to a remote action.[1176] Its pure corrosive\r\nproperties have long pointed it out to the surgeon as the most\r\nconvenient of all escharotics.\r\n\r\nNitrate of silver is absorbed, however, in the course of its action. It\r\nwould seem to be absorbed when it is taken medicinally in frequent small\r\ndoses. It is not easy to account otherwise for the singular blueness of\r\nthe skin, sometimes observed after the protracted use of lunar caustic\r\nas a remedy for epilepsy and other diseases.[1177] The effects of the\r\npoison on the constitution in such cases are not very well known. It\r\nappears, however, that considerable doses may be taken for a great\r\nlength of time without injury, and that the first and only unpleasant\r\neffects produced by its too free administration are such as indicate\r\nsimply an injury of the stomach. The only exception to this general\r\nstatement I have met with is a case by Wedemeyer, where, after the\r\nremedy had been taken for six months on account of epilepsy, that\r\ndisease disappeared, and dropsy, with diseased liver at the same time\r\ncommenced, and soon proved fatal. It is probable, however, that the\r\nnitrate of silver had no share in the ultimate event. In this instance\r\nthe whole internal organs were more or less blue; and metallic silver,\r\nit is said, was found in the pancreas, and in the choroid plexus of the\r\nbrain.[1178] Silver has been found in the urine of persons who were\r\ntaking it medicinally. A young man who had used the nitrate for some\r\ntime observed that his urine became muddy soon after being passed, and\r\nthat the sediment became black if exposed to the light; and when the\r\nsediment was digested in ammonia, chloride of silver was detached by\r\nneutralizing the ammoniacal liquor.[1179]\r\n\r\nBut it also appears that some nitrate of silver is absorbed when it is\r\ngiven in a single large dose. For in animals poisoned with it Orfila\r\nfound that silver may be detected in the liver and spleen by charring\r\nthese organs with nitric acid as in the instance of poisoning with\r\ncopper, and then treating the residue with boiling diluted nitric acid,\r\nand adding hydrochloric acid to the solution. He also found silver in\r\nthe urine by charring the extract with heat, acting on the charcoal with\r\nammonia, and saturating the filtered ammoniacal solution,—chloride of\r\nsilver being then detached.[1180] These results have been confirmed by\r\nthe experiments of Drs. Panizza and Kramer of Milan,[1181] who found\r\nsilver in the blood after the administration both of the nitrate and\r\nchloride.\r\n\r\nBoerhaave has noticed a case of poisoning with this substance, but in\r\nvery brief terms. He says it caused gangrene. Schloepfer in his thesis\r\nnotices a case by Dr. Albers of Bremen in which croup was brought on by\r\na bit of lunar caustic dropping into the windpipe. M. Poumarede has\r\nrelated an instance of poisoning with an ounce of nitrate of silver in\r\nsolution. A few hours afterwards the individual was found insensible,\r\nwith the eyes turned up, the pupils dilated, the jaws locked, and the\r\narms and face agitated with convulsions. A solution of common salt was\r\nimmediately given as an antidote. In two hours there was some return of\r\nconsciousness, and abatement of the convulsions, but still complete\r\ninsensibility of the limbs, with redness of the features, and pain in\r\nthe stomach. In eleven hours he could articulate. For thirty-six hours\r\nhe continued subject to fits of protracted coma; but he eventually\r\nrecovered. Sixteen hours after taking the poison he vomited a large\r\nquantity of chloride of silver.[1182]\r\n\r\nThe treatment of poisoning with the nitrate of silver is obvious. The\r\nmuriate of soda by decomposing it will act as an antidote; and any signs\r\nof irritation left will be subdued by opium.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Of Poisoning with Gold._\r\n\r\n_Gold_ in various states of combination was at one time much used in\r\nmedicine, and an attempt has been lately made to revive its employment.\r\n\r\nIts poisonous properties are powerful, and closely allied to those of\r\nthe chlorides of tin and nitrate of silver. In the state of chloride it\r\noccasions death in three or four minutes when injected into the veins,\r\neven in very minute doses; and the lungs are found after death so turgid\r\nas to sink in water. But if swallowed, corrosion takes place; the salt\r\nis so rapidly decomposed, that none is taken up by the absorbents; and\r\ndeath ensues simply from the local injury.[1183] It has been of late\r\nused in medicine in France as an antisyphilitic; but even doses so small\r\nas a tenth of a grain have been known to produce an unpleasant degree of\r\nirritation in the stomach.[1184]\r\n\r\nIn the state of fulminating gold, this metal has given rise to alarming\r\npoisoning in former times, when it was used medicinally. Plenck in his\r\nToxicologia says it excites griping, diarrhœa, vomiting, convulsions,\r\nfainting, salivation; and sometimes has proved fatal.[1185] Hoffmann\r\nlikewise repeatedly saw it prove fatal, and the most remarkable symptoms\r\nwere vomiting, great anxiety and fainting. In one of his cases the dose\r\nwas only six grains.[1186] These compounds are now so little met with\r\nthat they need not be noticed in greater detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Of Poisoning with Bismuth._\r\n\r\n_Bismuth_, in its saline combinations, is also an active poison. One of\r\nits compounds, the trisnitrate, white bismuth, or magistery of bismuth,\r\nis a good deal used in medicine and the arts; and pearl white, one of\r\nthe paints used in the cosmetic art, is the tartrate of this metal.\r\n\r\nThe former substance is an active poison. It is got by dissolving\r\nbismuth in nitric acid, and pouring hot water over the crystals; a\r\nsupernitrate being left in solution, and the trisnitrate thrown down in\r\nthe form of a white powder.\r\n\r\nOrfila found that the soluble part of fifteen grains of the nitrate,\r\nwhen injected into the jugular vein of a dog, caused immediate giddiness\r\nand staggering, and death in eight minutes. He also remarked that forty\r\ngrains mixed with water and introduced into the stomach, caused all the\r\ncustomary signs of irritation, and death in twenty-four hours; and that\r\na great part of the villous coat of the stomach was reduced to a pulpy\r\nmass, and likewise exhibited several ulcers.[1187]\r\n\r\nSimilar effects were produced by the trisnitrate; but a larger dose was\r\nrequired. Two drachms and a half killed a dog in twenty-four hours; and\r\nredness and eroded spots were found in the stomach.\r\n\r\nIn some more recent researches Orfila found that the poison is absorbed,\r\nand may be detected, like other metallic poisons, in the liver, spleen,\r\nand urine. The process for this purpose, applicable also to all organic\r\nmixtures, consists in boiling the solids in water acidulated with a\r\ntwentieth of nitric acid, evaporating the solution to dryness, charring\r\nthe residue with nitric acid, as directed for copper, boiling the\r\ncharcoal in diluted nitric acid, and thus obtaining an acid solution of\r\nnitrate of bismuth, which may be known by the effects of water and of\r\nhydrosulphuric acid.[1188]\r\n\r\nOrfila remarks, that Camerarius of Tübingen once detected the\r\nadulteration of wine with the oxide of bismuth, and that the bakers in\r\nsome parts of England used to render their bread white and heavy by\r\nmixing the trisnitrate with flour; but he has not stated his authority\r\nfor this accusation. It may be discovered in any such mixture by\r\ncalcining the suspected substance in a crucible, and then separating the\r\nmetallic bismuth by means of nitric acid. But the adulteration of bread\r\nwith bismuth is very questionable, as there are many cheaper methods for\r\neffecting the purpose, without adding any thing positively deleterious.\r\n\r\nThe following is the only case with which I am acquainted of poisoning\r\nwith the preparations of bismuth in the human subject. A man subject to\r\nwater-brash took two drachms of the trisnitrate with a little cream of\r\ntartar by mistake for a mixture of chalk and magnesia. He was\r\nimmediately attacked with burning in the throat, brown vomiting, watery\r\npurging, cramps, and coldness of the limbs, and intermitting pulse, and\r\nthen with inflammation of the throat, difficult swallowing, dryness of\r\nthe membrane of the nose, and a constant nauseous metallic taste. On the\r\nthird day he had hiccup, laborious breathing, and swelling of the hands\r\nand face; and suppression of urine was then discovered to have existed\r\nfrom the first. On the fourth day swelling and tension of the belly were\r\nadded to the pre-existing symptoms, on the fifth day salivation, on the\r\nsixth delirium, on the seventh, swelling of the tongue and enormous\r\nenlargement of the belly; and on the ninth he expired. The urine\r\ncontinued suppressed till the eighth day.—On inspection of the body it\r\nwas found that from the back of the mouth to the rectum there were but\r\nfew points of the alimentary canal free of disease. The tonsils, uvula,\r\npharynx, and epiglottis, were gangrenous, the larynx spotted black, the\r\ngullet livid, the stomach very red, with numerous purple pimples, the\r\nwhole intestinal canal red, and here and there gangrenous, especially at\r\nthe rectum. The inner surface of the heart was bright red. The kidneys\r\nand brain were healthy.[1189]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Of Poisoning with Chrome._\r\n\r\nThe next metal whose properties deserve notice is _chrome_. As it is now\r\nextensively used in the art of dyeing it is necessary to mention its\r\neffects, more especially as they are singular. They have been\r\nascertained experimentally with great care by Professor Gmelin of\r\nTübingen. He found that in the dose of a grain the _chromate of potass_\r\nhad no effect when injected into the jugular vein of a dog,—that four\r\ngrains produced constant vomiting, and death in six days without any\r\nother striking symptom,—and that ten grains caused instant death by\r\nparalysing the heart. Its effects, when introduced under the skin, are\r\nstill more remarkable. It seems to cause general inflammation of the\r\nlining membrane of the air-passages. When a drachm was thrust in the\r\nstate of powder under the skin of the neck of a dog, the first symptoms\r\nwere weariness and a disinclination to eat. But on the second day the\r\nanimal vomited, and a purulent matter was discharged from the eyes. On\r\nthe third day it became palsied in the hind legs; on the fourth it could\r\nnot breathe or swallow but with great difficulty; and on the sixth it\r\ndied. The wound was not much inflamed; but the larynx, bronchi, and\r\nminute ramifications of the air tubes contained fragments of fibrinous\r\neffusion, the nostrils were full of similar matter, and the conjunctiva\r\nof the eyes was covered with mucus. In another dog, an eruption appeared\r\non the back, and the hair fell off.[1190]\r\n\r\nThe effects of the salts of chrome on man have not been well\r\nascertained, but seem to be peculiar. Dr. Schindler of Greifenberg\r\nrelates the following case of fatal poisoning with bichromate of potash.\r\nA colourman having swallowed a solution of it, vomiting was brought on\r\nby warm water, soap and oil, and kept up until the discharges ceased to\r\nbe yellow. The man got apparently well and passed a quiet night; but\r\nnext morning he felt excessively weary, had stitches in his back and\r\nkidneys, passed no urine, and was affected with purging. A restless\r\nnight followed. On the subsequent morning, he lay motionless and like\r\none fatigued to the extremest degree; in which state he died, fifty-four\r\nhours after swallowing the poison. The stomach was healthy, the\r\nintestines reddish, the kidneys gorged with blood and marbled internally\r\nwith dark-red patches, and the bladder empty.[1191]—Mr. Wilson of Leeds\r\nhas described the case of an elderly man who took the poison in the\r\nevening, and was found dead about twelve hours afterwards, without any\r\nsign of vomiting, purging, or convulsions; and no morbid appearance was\r\nfound but redness of the villous coat of the stomach, and an inky-like\r\nfluid in it, containing a large quantity of bichromate of potash.[1192]\r\n\r\nTo these facts may be added another not less singular, which my late\r\ncolleague Dr. Duncan informed me has been observed by the workmen in\r\nGlasgow, who use the bichromate of potass in dyeing. When this salt was\r\nfirst introduced into the art of dyeing, the workmen who had their hands\r\noften immersed in its solution were attacked with troublesome sores on\r\nthe parts touched by it; and the sores gradually extended deeper and\r\ndeeper, without spreading, till they sometimes actually made their way\r\nthrough the arm or hand altogether.[1193]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Of Poisoning with Zinc._\r\n\r\nThe compounds of _zinc_, which have been long used in considerable doses\r\nin medicine, have sometimes occasioned serious and even fatal effects.\r\nPartly on this account, and partly because one of them, the sulphate of\r\nzinc, being the emetic most commonly used in the treatment of poisoning,\r\nis apt to complicate various medico-legal analyses, it will be proper to\r\nnotice both its physiological properties and the mode of detecting it by\r\nchemical means.\r\n\r\nThe only important compound of this metal is the sulphate or _white\r\nvitriol_. As usually sold in the shops, it forms small, prismatic\r\ncrystals, transparent, colourless, of a very styptic metallic taste, and\r\nexceedingly soluble in water. That which is kept by the apothecary is\r\ntolerably pure; but there is a salt sometimes met with in commerce which\r\ncontains an admixture of sulphate of iron, and with which the natural\r\naction of the tests for zinc is materially modified.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the pure salt is precipitated white by the _caustic\r\nalkalis_, an oxide being thrown down, which is soluble in an excess of\r\nammonia. The _alkaline carbonates_ also precipitate it white, the\r\ncarbonate of ammonia being the most delicate of these reagents. The\r\nprecipitate is soluble in an excess of carbonate of ammonia, and is not\r\nthrown down again by boiling. The precipitate produced both by the\r\nalkalis and by their carbonates becomes yellow, when heated nearly to\r\nredness; and on cooling it becomes again white. This is a characteristic\r\nproperty, by which the oxide of zinc may be known from most white\r\npowders. But oxide of antimony is similarly affected. The _ferro-cyanate\r\nof potass_ also causes a white precipitate. A stream of\r\n_sulphuretted-hydrogen_ likewise causes a white precipitate, the\r\nsulphuret of zinc, the colour of which distinguishes the present genus\r\nof poisons from all those previously mentioned, as well as from the\r\npoisons of lead. The precipitate is apt to be suspended till the excess\r\nof gas is expelled by ebullition. The action of this test will not\r\ndistinguish sulphate of zinc from the salts of peroxide of iron, by\r\nwhich white sulphur is disengaged from the gas in consequence of the\r\nperoxide of iron being reduced to the state of protoxide. The same\r\ndecomposition takes place wherever there is free chlorine, as in impure\r\nsamples of muriatic or nitric acid.\r\n\r\nWhen the sulphate of zinc contains iron, the alkalis throw down a\r\ngreenish-white precipitate, the alkaline carbonates a grayish or\r\nreddish-white, the ferro-cyanate of potass a light-blue, but\r\nsulphuretted-hydrogen the usual white precipitate. Tincture of galls,\r\nwhich merely renders the pure salt hazy, causes a deep violet coagulum\r\nif there is any ferruginous impurity.\r\n\r\nThe sulphate of zinc is acted on by albumen and milk precisely in the\r\nsame manner as the sulphate of copper. The salt is decomposed, and the\r\nmetallic oxide forms an insoluble compound with the animal matter.\r\n\r\nWhen the sulphate of zinc has been mixed with vegetable and animal\r\nsubstances, the action of the tests mentioned above is modified. In such\r\ncircumstances I have found the following process convenient.\r\n\r\nThe mixture being strained through gauze, it is to be acidulated with\r\nacetic acid, and filtered through paper. The acetic acid dissolves any\r\noxide of zinc that may have been thrown down in union with animal\r\nmatter. The filtered fluid is then to be evaporated to a convenient\r\nextent, and treated when cool with sulphuretted-hydrogen gas,—upon which\r\na grayish or white milkiness or precipitate will be formed. The excess\r\nof gas must now be expelled by boiling, and the precipitate washed by\r\nthe process of subsidence and affusion, and collected on a filter. It is\r\nthen to be dried and heated to redness in a tube. When it has cooled, it\r\nis to be acted on by strong nitric acid, which dissolves the zinc and\r\nleaves the sulphur. The nitrous solution should next be diluted, and\r\nneutralized with carbonate of ammonia; after which the liquid tests\r\nformerly mentioned will act characteristically. The effect of carbonate\r\nof ammonia, and that of heat on the carbonate of zinc which is thrown\r\ndown, ought to be particularly relied on.\r\n\r\nI have tried this process with the matter vomited after the\r\nadministration of sulphate of zinc, in a case of pretended poisoning,\r\nand found it to answer exceedingly well.\r\n\r\nOrfila has lately suggested the following method. Boil the suspected\r\nsubstance in water, evaporate the filtered decoction to dryness, char\r\nthe residuum with nitric acid as directed for copper in similar\r\ncircumstances, digest the charcoal in diluted muriatic acid, and subject\r\nthe filtered solution to hydrosulphuric acid. If the sulphuret be not\r\nwhite, but yellowish from iron, heat it with strong nitric acid, dry the\r\nproduct, and heat it to redness; dissolve it in weak nitric acid; throw\r\ndown the oxide of iron by an excess of ammonia, which retains the oxide\r\nof zinc; and then having filtered the fluid, separate the oxide of zinc\r\nby neutralizing the ammonia.[1194]\r\n\r\nOrfila has furnished the only accurate information hitherto possessed\r\nregarding the effects of sulphate of zinc on the animal system.[1195] He\r\nfound that dogs might be made to swallow 7½ drachms without any\r\npermanent harm being sustained, provided they were allowed to vomit; for\r\nin a few seconds the whole poison was invariably discharged, and the\r\nanimals, after appearing to suffer for four or five hours, gradually\r\nrecovered their usual liveliness. But the result is different if the\r\ngullet be tied: violent efforts to vomit ensue, and death follows in\r\nthree days, the intermediate phenomena being those of local irritation\r\nchiefly, and the appearances in the dead body those of incipient\r\ninflammation of the stomach, without corrosion.—When injected into the\r\nveins, the effect of sulphate of zinc is much more violent, in an\r\ninferior dose. Forty-eight grains occasioned almost instant death; and\r\nhalf the quantity proved fatal in three minutes. Orfila does not appear\r\nto have ascertained the cause of death in the last two experiments. But\r\nMr. Blake found that when this salt is injected into the veins in the\r\ndose of three grains, it causes some depression of the heart; that\r\nthirty grains arrest the action of the heart in eight seconds, leaving\r\nthat organ exhausted of irritability and full of florid blood in its\r\nleft cavities; and that when injected into the arterial system in the\r\ndose of sixteen grains, it seemed not to cause any obstruction of the\r\ncapillaries, but to act on the nervous system, producing extreme\r\nprostration, without insensibility or convulsions.[1196] These\r\nexperiments, when taken together, show that sulphate of zinc, though a\r\nmoderately active irritant, is more indebted for its activity to a\r\nremote operation on some vital organ.\r\n\r\nSulphate of zinc is absorbed in the course of its action; for Orfila has\r\nlately found it by his process for complex mixtures in the spleen,\r\nliver, and urine of animals.[1197]\r\n\r\nThe effects of the preparations of zinc on man in large doses have not\r\nbeen particularly studied. In the dose of a scruple or a drachm, the\r\nsulphate is the most immediate emetic known; and it is to be inferred,\r\nthat if larger doses are rejected, as is the fact, with equal rapidity,\r\nthey will in general cause no more harm than the medicinal dose.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, some people have suffered severely from over-doses of\r\nsulphate of zinc, and a few have even perished. Instead of presenting\r\nhere a general view of the symptoms, it will be preferable to relate the\r\nheads of such cases as have been published.\r\n\r\nThe first to be mentioned is related by Foderé, who, in consequence of\r\nthe violent symptoms produced, assigns to the present poison very active\r\nproperties. “A patient of mine,” says he, “a custom-house officer,\r\nhaving got from a druggist six grains of sulphate of zinc to cure a\r\ngonorrhœa, was attacked with inflammation in the lower belly, attended\r\nby retraction of the navel and severe colic, which yielded only to\r\nrepeated blood-letting, general as well as local, oleaginous emollients,\r\nopiates, and the warm bath.”[1198] This case is noticed here chiefly to\r\nprevent any one from being misled by it, as it has been quoted by other\r\nmedico-legal authors. For assuredly some other cause must have\r\nco-operated before such symptoms could arise; since I have in many cases\r\ngiven the same dose thrice daily for several days, without ever\r\nobserving more than slight sickness; and Dr. Babington once gave\r\nthirty-six grains thrice a day for some weeks with as little\r\neffect.[1199]\r\n\r\nParmentier, the chemist, met with an instance, in which about two ounces\r\nof white vitriol in solution were swallowed by mistake. The countenance\r\nbecame immediately pale, the extremities cold, the eyes dull, and the\r\npulse fluttering. The patient, a young lady, then complained of a\r\nburning pain in the stomach, and vomited violently. But potass being now\r\nadministered in syrup, the pain ceased, the vomiting gradually abated,\r\nand the lady soon recovered completely.[1200]\r\n\r\nIn the Journal de Médecine, another instance is related by M. Schueler,\r\nin which a very large dose did not produce material injury. The symptoms\r\nwere pain in the stomach and bowels, with vomiting and diarrhœa. They\r\nwere dispelled in a few hours by the administration of cream, butter,\r\nand chalk.[1201]\r\n\r\nThe following is a fatal case recorded by Metzger, but it is not a pure\r\nexample of poisoning with zinc, though accounted such by the relater;\r\nfor a small quantity of sulphate of copper was mixed with the sulphate\r\nof zinc. Three persons in a family took this mixture, which had been\r\ngiven them by a grocer in mistake for pounded sugar. They were all\r\nseized with violent vomiting; and a boy twelve years of age died in less\r\nthan twelve hours.[1202]\r\n\r\nAnother and an unequivocal case has been lately recorded in Horn’s\r\nArchiv from Mertzdorff’s experience. No part of the history of the\r\nsymptoms is mentioned, except that there had been vomiting. But\r\nMertzdorff has described carefully the morbid appearances, which are\r\ninteresting; and he detected the poison in the stomach by a satisfactory\r\nanalysis.[1203]\r\n\r\nTwo other cases, which are presumed to have arisen from the commercial\r\nsulphate of zinc, and which proved fatal, have been recently published\r\nby Dr. Sartorius of Aachen; but they do not appear to me to have been\r\nsatisfactorily traced to this poison, and it is therefore unnecessary to\r\nquote them.[1204]\r\n\r\nDr. Werres of Cologne has related the particulars of three cases of\r\npoisoning with some preparation of zinc in milk-porridge. One of the\r\npersons, a child four years old, was seized with vomiting in three\r\nminutes, and, after frequent violent returns of it, died in convulsions\r\nwithin eight hours. The others also suffered severely from vomiting, but\r\nrecovered.[1205]\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that workmen who are exposed to the fumes of zinc\r\never suffer materially. But there is a case in Rust’s Magazin, which\r\nshows that these fumes are not quite harmless. An apothecary’s\r\nassistant, while preparing philosopher’s wool, incautiously filled the\r\nwhole laboratory with it. The same day he was seized with tightness in\r\nthe chest, headache and giddiness; next morning with violent cough,\r\nvomiting, and stillness of the limbs; on the third day with a coppery\r\ntaste in the mouth, some salivation, gripes, and such an increase of\r\ngiddiness that he could not stand. He was then freely purged, after\r\nwhich a fever set in, ending in perspiration; and he got well in three\r\nweeks.[1206]\r\n\r\nFrom these cases, and the experimental researches of Orfila, it is clear\r\nthat the preparations of zinc, though not very active poisons, are\r\nnevertheless far from being innocuous. We are not acquainted with their\r\neffects when long and habitually introduced into the body in small\r\nquantities. About the time when physicians began to study with care the\r\ndangerous consequences of employing lead and copper in the manufacture\r\nof culinary vessels, it was conceived by some that zinc might prove a\r\nsafe substitute. It was farther imagined by some military economists in\r\nFrance, that zinc might be profitably used instead of tinned iron in the\r\nmanufacture of canteens and other articles of camp equipage, because the\r\nworn and damaged vessels would sell as old metal at little short of\r\ntheir original price, while tinned iron as old metal bears no value at\r\nall. But from the experiments of Deyeux and Vauquelin it subsequently\r\nappeared, that in the course of many culinary operations zinc is more\r\nliable to be attacked than either copper or lead;—that water left for\r\nsome time in zinc vessels oxidates them, and acquires a metallic\r\ntaste;—that if water acidulated with vinegar or lemon-juice is boiled in\r\nzinc, a solution is formed, in which the metal may be detected by its\r\ntests;—and that sea-salt, sal-ammoniac, and even butter, have the power\r\nof dissolving it also.[1207] Some singular inquiries were afterwards\r\nprosecuted by Devaux and Dejaer among the Spanish prisoners at Liége,\r\nwith the view of proving, that frequent small quantities of zinc\r\ndissolved in the manner mentioned, and habitually taken with the food,\r\nhave no injurious tendency; that even in large doses it can hardly be\r\naccounted poisonous, as it merely gives rise to vomiting and slight\r\ndiarrhœa; and that an adulteration to such an amount would always betray\r\nitself by its strong disagreeable taste.[1208] These are certainly\r\nvaluable facts, though not quite satisfactory. But it is unnecessary to\r\ninquire minutely into their validity; for, independently of all other\r\nconsiderations, vessels constructed of zinc are too brittle for domestic\r\npurposes. With regard to the effects of frequent small doses of sulphate\r\nof zinc, the only positive information I can communicate is, that I have\r\noften given medicinally from three to six grains thrice a day for two or\r\nthree weeks, without observing any particular effect except in some\r\npersons sickness when the largest doses were taken; and others have\r\nfrequently made the same observation.[1209] On the other hand, Dr. Nasse\r\nof Berlin says a patient of his, who had taken twenty grains of oxide of\r\nzinc daily till 3247 grains were swallowed, was attacked with paleness,\r\nemaciation, weakness of intellect, obstinate constipation, coldness and\r\nœdema of the limbs, extreme dryness of the skin, and a thready scarcely\r\nperceptible pulse. But he quickly recovered under the use of laxatives\r\nand tonics.[1210]\r\n\r\nSulphate of zinc is said to have proved fatal when applied externally.\r\nIn Pyl’s memoirs there is a case of this nature, which was attributed to\r\nsulphate of zinc having been used as a lotion for a scabby eruption on\r\nthe head. The subject was a child, six years old, and otherwise healthy.\r\nThe wash, which was a vinous solution, had not been long applied before\r\nthe child complained of acute burning pain of the head, which was\r\nfollowed by vomiting, purging, convulsions, and death in five hours. The\r\ncause of these symptoms, though the particulars of the case were\r\nascertained judicially by an able medical jurist, Dr. Opitz of Minden,\r\nis nevertheless very doubtful, as daily use is made of the salt for\r\nsimilar purposes without any such effect. Appearances of congestive\r\napoplexy were found within the skull; and the reporter ascribes death to\r\nthe wash having produced repulsion of the cutaneous disease, and\r\ndetermination of blood to the head.[1211]\r\n\r\nThe only opportunities which have occurred of observing the morbid\r\nappearances after poisoning with sulphate of zinc taken internally, are\r\nthe cases by Metzger, Mertzdorff, and Werres.\r\n\r\nIn the first, which was a mixed case, the only appearances of note were\r\nslight inflammation in the stomach, and excessive gorging of the lungs\r\nwith fluid blood; from which Metzger oddly enough concludes that the\r\nchild was suffocated by the vomiting. In the second case, Mertzdorff\r\nfound the stomach and intestines, but particularly the latter,\r\ncontracted,—their outer surface healthy—the inner membrane of the\r\nstomach grayish-green, with several spots of effused blood, and\r\ngreenish, fluid contents,—the inner membrane of the small intestines\r\nsimilarly spotted,—the rest of the body quite natural. It has been\r\nalready mentioned that Mertzdorff detected the poison in the body. He\r\nfound it not only in the contents, but likewise in the coats of the\r\nstomach and intestines. In the third, Werres found a reddish-brown patch\r\nand some vascularity in the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Of Poisoning with Iron._\r\n\r\nIn previous editions of this work the preparations of iron were arranged\r\namong those substances which are not usually considered poisonous, but\r\nwhich may nevertheless prove injurious when taken in large quantity. But\r\nthe soluble salts of iron, although not very active, seem sufficiently\r\nso to entitle them to a regular place among poisons; and one of them,\r\nthe sulphate, has actually been used, as will presently appear, for the\r\npurpose of committing murder. There are many soluble salts of iron which\r\nin all probability may prove hurtful; but the only ones which have been\r\nbrought under notice in medico-legal researches are the sulphate of the\r\nprotoxide, and the mixed chlorides.\r\n\r\nThe sulphate of the protoxide of iron, commonly called green vitriol or\r\ncopperas, occurs in commerce in crystals or crystalline masses of\r\nvarious shades of bluish-green. It is easily known by its colour and its\r\nstrong styptic inky taste. When in solution, the iron may be detected by\r\nferro-cyanate of potash, sulphuretted-hydrogen, and tincture of galls.\r\nFerro-cyanate of potash causes a blue precipitate, at first pale, but\r\ngradually passing to deep Prussian blue. Sulphuretted-hydrogen has no\r\neffect, but if an alkali, such as ammonia, be added to disengage the\r\noxide of iron, a black precipitate of sulphuret of iron is immediately\r\nproduced. Tincture of galls occasions a deep purplish-black precipitate,\r\nthe tannate of iron, and it acts with greater delicacy in very diluted\r\nsolutions, if the oxide of iron be disengaged by carbonate of soda.\r\nThese tests prove the presence of iron in solution. A white precipitate\r\nunder the action of nitrate of baryta will indicate that the oxide is\r\ndissolved by sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nThe most familiar form of chloride of iron is the tincture of the\r\nchloride, which sometimes contains only the sesquichloride, sometimes\r\nconsists of a mixture of this with the protochloride. It is known by the\r\nthree tests for oxide of iron described above, and by nitrate of silver\r\noccasioning a heavy white precipitate, insoluble in nitric acid.\r\n\r\nFor detecting iron in organic mixtures, where the liquid reagents do not\r\nact satisfactorily, the simplest process is to digest the mixture, if\r\nthere be any solid matter, in water acidulated with acetic acid, to\r\nevaporate the filtered liquid to dryness, to incinerate the extract in a\r\nporcelain crucible, to act on the product with diluted sulphuric acid,\r\nand then to treat the solution with the three liquid reagents.\r\n\r\nProfessor Gmelin found that sulphate of iron merely caused vomiting in\r\ndogs who were made to swallow two drachms of it, that rabbits might take\r\nforty grains without any apparent injury, and that twenty grains in a\r\nstate of solution might even be injected into the veins of a dog without\r\nproducing any particular symptom.[1212] From these and some other facts\r\nof the like kind it was generally held, that sulphate of iron is not a\r\npoison. But Smith ascertained that a dose of two drachms will prove\r\nfatal to dogs in little more than twenty-tour hours, when it is\r\nintroduced into the stomach, and in half that time if applied to a\r\nwound; and that it occasions some redness of the alimentary mucous\r\nmembrane, and the effusion of a thick layer of tough mucus. It is\r\nremarkable, however, that, like Gmelin, he found no effect to flow from\r\nthe transfusion of a solution of seven grains into the veins, except\r\ntransient vomiting and expressions of pain.[1213]\r\n\r\nThe effects which have been observed in the human subject are\r\nconformable with those witnessed in experiments on the lower animals,\r\nthe symptoms being those of pure irritant poisoning. Few illustrative\r\ncases, however, have as yet been made public. In Rust’s Journal there is\r\nthe case of a girl, who took as an emmenagogue, an ounce of green\r\nvitriol dissolved in beer, and suffered in consequence from colic pains,\r\nconstant vomiting and purging for seven hours, but eventually recovered\r\nunder the use of mucilaginous and oily drinks.[1214] A fatal case of\r\npoisoning with this substance occurs in the Parliamentary Returns of\r\ndeath from poison in England during the years 1837–38 [see p. 90].—Dr.\r\nCombe of Leith has communicated to me an instructive case of fatal\r\npoisoning with the tincture of the chloride of iron, which was taken to\r\nthe extent of an ounce and a half by a gardener accidentally instead of\r\nwhisky. Violent pain in the throat and stomach, tension and contraction\r\nof the epigastrium, and nausea immediately ensued; afterwards coldness\r\nof the skin and feebleness of the pulse were remarked; and then vomiting\r\nof an inky fluid, with subsequently profuse vomiting of mucus and blood,\r\nand also bloody stools under the use of laxatives. He remained for some\r\ndays in a very precarious state, but then began to rally, and in three\r\nweeks resumed his occupation. But in two weeks more Dr. Combe found him\r\nemaciated, cadaverous in appearance, and affected with pains in the\r\nstomach, costiveness, and thirst; in which state he lingered for five\r\ndays more, and then died. In the dead body there was found great\r\nthickening towards the pylorus, a cicatrized patch there three inches\r\nlong and two inches broad, and another large patch of inflammatory\r\nredness surrounded by a white border. The preparation taken in this\r\ninstance contained a third of its volume of hydrochloric acid and a\r\ntenth of its weight of oxide of iron; and consequently some of the acid\r\nwas free.\r\n\r\nThe following remarkable case, in which I was lately consulted on the\r\npart of the Crown, will show that sulphate of iron is a more important\r\npoison than has been commonly thought. Suspicions having arisen in\r\nDecember, 1840, respecting the death of a child in the county of Fife\r\nabout four months before, an investigation was made by the law\r\nauthorities; and the body was disinterred and inspected by Mr. Dewar and\r\nDr. James Dewar of Dunfermline. It was ascertained that the child, a\r\ngirl four years of age, and previously in good health, was attacked with\r\nviolent vomiting and purging immediately after breakfasting on porridge,\r\nand died in the course of the afternoon of the same day. A boy two years\r\nolder, having seen a blue solution put into the porridge, and observing\r\nthat the porridge had a bad taste, took only three spoonfuls of it, but\r\nbecame for a time very sick. The girl, being fed by a woman in the\r\nhouse, was made to take all her share; and in the course of the day the\r\nsame person was seen by two children of the family to give a blue\r\nsolution to the sick girl for drink. The woman was proved to have\r\npurchased sulphate of copper, and admitted having bought about this time\r\nboth that salt and sulphate of iron, for the alleged purpose of dyeing\r\nsome clothes. Poisoning with sulphate of copper was therefore suspected.\r\nOn examining the body, which had been buried four months, the Messrs.\r\nDewar found the external parts considerably decayed,—the stomach soft,\r\ngelatinous, and of a uniform intense black colour through the whole\r\nthickness of its parietes,—the gullet and duodenum similarly affected,\r\nbut not so deeply on their outer surface,—the spleen, kidneys, and lower\r\nparts of the liver similarly stained with a black pulp, which could be\r\nwiped off,—and the whole alimentary canal lined with a thick layer of\r\njet-black mucus, from the pharynx down to the very anus. Inferring that\r\nthe cause of this extraordinary blackness was decomposition of sulphate\r\nof copper by hydrosulphuric acid gas disengaged during the decay of the\r\nbody, they proceeded to search for that metal in the form of sulphuret\r\nboth in the contents and texture of the stomach, but without success:\r\nthere was not a trace of copper to be found. Being then led from some\r\ncircumstances in the analysis to suspect that the black matter might be\r\nsulphuret of iron, they proceeded to search for that substance, and\r\nascertained that a large quantity existed both in the textures of the\r\nstomach and in the black mucus which lined it. They further ascertained\r\nthat there was no iron in a state capable of being dissolved by water,\r\nbut that a much larger quantity of sulphuric acid was associated with\r\nthe black matter than could have proceeded from the sulphates naturally\r\ncontained in the animal textures or in the mucous secretions. They had\r\nalso an opportunity of examining several large buff-coloured stains on\r\nvarious articles of dress, worn by the child and by the woman at the\r\ntime the poisoning was supposed to have happened; and they detected a\r\nlarge quantity of oxide of iron in all of them. The whole case was\r\nsubsequently submitted to me for my opinion, together with a portion of\r\nthe stomach, the entire intestines, and several stained articles of\r\ndress. The results of the analysis of the tissues of the stomach, the\r\nblack intestinal mucus, and the stains on the cloth were the same in my\r\nhands.—It is not easy to see how any other conclusion could be drawn\r\nfrom the whole circumstances, than that a soluble preparation of iron\r\nhad been administered a short time before death, and that it had been\r\nentirely decomposed and converted into sulphuret of iron by the\r\nevolution of hydrosulphate of ammonia during the decay of the body. In\r\nconsequence of important defects in the evidence criminating a\r\nparticular individual, and especially because all the essential facts\r\ndepended on the testimony of children, who, after the lapse of some\r\ntime, did not adhere to their original statement, it was judged improper\r\nto bring this case to a trial.\r\n\r\nA few years afterwards another case somewhat similar was submitted by\r\nthe law authorities to the same gentlemen, to whom I am indebted for the\r\nparticulars. A woman far advanced in pregnancy, and enjoying excellent\r\nhealth, was suddenly seized about midnight with vomiting and purging,\r\nand died in fourteen hours. Various circumstances having raised\r\nsuspicions as to the cause of death, the body was disinterred a few days\r\nafter burial, and carefully examined by Mr. Dewar and Dr. Dewar. The\r\norgans were in general healthy. There were some dark-red patches on the\r\nvillous coat of the stomach, and a general blush pervaded the whole\r\nalimentary canal, which was empty of every thing but a reddish-brown\r\nmucus. The intestines were in several places irregularly contracted and\r\nhard. The stomach, small intestines, and rectum contained iron in large\r\nquantity, dissolved either by sulphuric or hydrochloric acid. Sulphate\r\nof iron was found in the house.—No trial took place in this instance\r\neither, because there was a want of evidence to attach guilt to any\r\nparticular individual, although it was highly improbable that the woman\r\nhad taken the poison herself.[1215]\r\n\r\nA short notice may here be added of the toxicological effects of the\r\nrarer metals, which have been examined chiefly by Professor Gmelin of\r\nTübingen.[1216]—Oxide of _osmium_ is nearly as active as arsenic, for a\r\ngrain and a half will kill a dog in a few hours by the stomach, and in\r\none hour through a vein. Twelve grains of hydrochlorate of _platinum_\r\nwill kill a dog within a day through the stomach, with symptoms of pure\r\nirritation; and so will half that quantity through a vein.—The\r\nhydrochlorates of _iridium_ and _rhodium_ are rather less active.—The\r\nhydrochlorate of _palladium_ is equally powerful when introduced into\r\nthe stomach, and much more so through a vein, for two-thirds of a grain\r\nwill kill dogs in a minute.\r\n\r\nThe salts of other metals appear less active.—_Molybdenum_, in the form\r\nof molybdate of ammonia, seems a feeble poison; thirty grains killed a\r\nrabbit in two hours, but produced in dogs merely some vomiting and\r\npurging; and ten grains injected into the jugular vein did not prove\r\nfatal.—_Manganese_, according to Gmelin, is likewise a feeble poison,\r\nbut has peculiar effects. A drachm of the sulphate killed a rabbit in an\r\nhour. Thirty grains swallowed by a dog had no effect. Two drachms thrust\r\ninto the cellular tissue had no effect. Twelve grains injected into a\r\nvein occasioned death in five days: and in the dead body, the stomach,\r\nduodenum, and liver were found much inflamed. Manganesic acid, according\r\nto Professor Hünefeld, appears also to act on the liver, but is a feeble\r\npoison. A rabbit received two drachms in three days in doses of ten or\r\nfifteen grains, without presenting any symptom except increased flow of\r\nurine. Being then killed, the liver was found soft, at one part bright\r\nred, elsewhere dark-brownish-red, and it yielded manganese by\r\nincineration.[1217] Some singular observations have been lately\r\npublished by Dr. Couper of Glasgow, the purport of which is, that\r\nmanganese belongs to the class of insidious, cumulative poisons, and\r\nthat it has the property of slowly bringing on, in those who breathe or\r\nhandle the oxide, a paraplegic affection which is incurable unless taken\r\nunder treatment early. Five cases of the kind occurred subsequently to\r\n1828, in the great chemical manufactory of Tennant and Company, among\r\nthe workmen employed in grinding the black oxide of manganese.[1218] On\r\nthe other hand, Dr. Thomson of Glasgow has recently stated that an ounce\r\nof sulphate of manganese is an effectual and safe laxative.[1219]\r\n_Uranium_ is an active poison when injected into a vein, for three\r\ngrains of the muriate proves fatal instantly; but dogs may swallow\r\nfifteen, or from that to sixty grains without any other effect except\r\nslight vomiting [Gmelin]. _Cobalt_ is more active. Thirty grains of the\r\noxide occasion death in a few hours through the stomach. Twenty-four\r\ngrains of the muriate applied to the cellular tissue excite vomiting.\r\nThree grains of sulphate injected into a vein prove fatal in four\r\ndays.—_Tungsten_, _cerium_, _cadmium_, _nickel_, and _titanium_ can\r\nscarcely be considered poisons. _Tungstate_ of ammonia in the dose of a\r\ndrachm had no effect when swallowed by a dog; forty grains of tungstate\r\nof soda, which is more soluble, operated as an emetic; but this dose\r\nwill prove fatal to rabbits in a few hours. A drachm of the muriate of\r\n_cerium_ had little or no effect on a dog, and half that dose had no\r\neffect on a rabbit. The oxide of _cadmium_ in the dose of twenty grains,\r\nmade a dog vomit; and ten grains had no effect at all.[1220] Twenty\r\ngrains of sulphate of _nickel_ made a dog vomit; forty grains applied to\r\nthe cellular tissue had no effect at all on the general constitution;\r\nbut ten grains injected into the jugular vein occasioned immediate death\r\n[Gmelin]. A drachm of _titanic_ acid had no effect on a dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n                        OF POISONING WITH LEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoisoning with lead is a subject of great consequence in Medical Police,\r\nas well as Medical Jurisprudence. Its preparations have been used for\r\nthe purpose of intentional poisoning. At the Taunton Assizes in March,\r\n1827, a servant-girl was tried for attempting to administer sugar of\r\nlead to her mistress in an arrow-root pudding: and although the charge\r\nwas not made out, it appeared from the prisoner’s confession that she\r\nreally had made the attempt. Sugar of lead has also been often taken by\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nIn relation to medical police lead is a subject of great importance.\r\nThis metal is used in so many forms, and in so many of the arts, and its\r\neffects when gradually introduced into the body are so slow and\r\ninsidious, that instances of its deleterious operation are frequently\r\nmet with. Such accidents, indeed, are less common now, than they used to\r\nbe before the late improvements in chemistry. But they are still\r\nsufficiently frequent to render it necessary for the toxicologist to\r\ninvestigate the properties of lead attentively.\r\n\r\n\r\n SECTION I.—_Of the Chemical History and Tests for the Preparations of\r\n                                 Lead._\r\n\r\nThe physical characters of lead in its metallic state are familiar to\r\nevery one. It is easily known by the dull bluish-gray colour it assumes\r\nwhen exposed some time to the air, by the brilliant bluish-gray colour\r\nof a fresh surface, and by the facility with which it may be cut. The\r\ncompounds which require particular notice are four in number, litharge,\r\nred lead, white lead, sugar of lead, and Goulard’s extract. The first\r\nthree are very much used by house-painters and glaziers, the last two\r\nare extensively employed in surgery, and the sugar of lead is also used\r\nin many of the arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     1. _Of Litharge and Red Lead._\r\n\r\n_Litharge_ is the protoxide of lead in a state of semivitrification.\r\n_Red lead_ is a compound of two equivalents of protoxide and one of\r\ndeutoxide. The former is generally in the form of a grayish-red heavy\r\npowder, sometimes partly crystalline; the latter in the form of a bright\r\nred powder approaching in colour to vermilion. They may be known by\r\ntheir colour;—by their becoming black when suspended in water and\r\ntreated with a stream of sulphuretted-hydrogen gas;—and by litharge\r\nbeing entirely, and red lead partly, soluble in nitric acid, and forming\r\na solution which possesses the properties to be mentioned presently for\r\nsolutions of the acetate. The chemical actions concerned in these\r\nchanges are obvious, except in the instance of nitric acid on red lead.\r\nHere the acid dissolves the protoxide only, and the deutoxide, which\r\nseems to act the part of an acid in the pigment, is separated in the\r\nform of a brown powder.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          2. _Of White Lead._\r\n\r\n_White lead_, which is the carbonate of the metal, is in the form of a\r\nheavy snow-white powder, or in white chalk-like masses. It consists of\r\nvariable proportions of the hydrated oxide and neutral carbonate; those\r\nspecimens are the whitest which contain most carbonate; and the best\r\nEnglish white lead I find to contain four equivalents of carbonate and\r\none of hydrated protoxide. The grayer variety, formed by the action of\r\ndistilled water on metallic lead, consists of only two of the former to\r\none of the latter.[1221] It may be known by its being blackened like the\r\ntwo former compounds by sulphuretted-hydrogen,—by being soluble with\r\neffervescence in nitric acid,—and by becoming permanently yellow when\r\nheated to redness, in consequence of the expulsion of its carbonic acid,\r\nand its conversion into protoxide. These tests, however, apply with\r\nexactness only to the pure carbonate, in which state white lead is not\r\noften met with in the shops. It is generally adulterated with sulphates,\r\nin consequence of which it is only partially acted on by nitric acid,\r\nand does not become distinctly yellow under a strong red heat. Dutch\r\nwhite-lead contains no less than between 78·5 and 25 per cent. of\r\nimpurities insoluble in nitric acid, Venetian white-lead from 11 to 14·5\r\nper cent., Munich white-lead between 1 and 7·5 per cent.[1222] I have\r\nmet, however, with perfectly pure specimens in the shops of this city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         3. _Of Sugar of Lead._\r\n\r\n_Sugar of lead_ is the acetate of this metal. It is sold in the form\r\neither of a white heavy powder, or of aggregated masses of long\r\nfour-sided prismatic crystals. It has a sweetish astringent taste, and a\r\nslight acetous odour. It is very soluble.\r\n\r\nWhen in the solid state, it may be known by its solubility in water, and\r\nby the effects of heat. It first undergoes the aqueous fusion, then\r\nabandons a part of its acid empyreumatized, as may be perceived by the\r\nsmell, next becomes charred, and finally presents globules of lead\r\nreduced by the charcoal of the acid. The best way of effecting its\r\nreduction on the small scale is to char it, and then direct on the mass\r\nthe point of a blowpipe-flame: in an instant globules are developed. It\r\nis not easily reduced in a tube; at least I have never been able to\r\nsucceed in that way.\r\n\r\nIn the fluid state the acetate of lead, as well as all its\r\nsoluble salts, may be detected by the following system of\r\nreagents,—hydrosulphuric acid, bichromate of potass, hydriodate of\r\npotass, and metallic zinc,—which are the best of the numerous reagents\r\nyet proposed.\r\n\r\n1. _Hydrosulphuric acid_ causes a black precipitate, the sulphuret of\r\nlead. This is a test of extreme delicacy; and it acts in whatever state\r\nof combination the lead exists, whether fluid or solid.\r\n\r\nIt is preferable to the hydrosulphate of ammonia as a medico-legal test;\r\nfor, as Fourcroy observed, the hydrosulphate of ammonia acts on many\r\nsound wines as if they contained lead,[1223] while hydrosulphuric acid\r\nnever causes with them a black precipitate, unless they contain either\r\nlead or some other metallic impregnation. It must be remembered that\r\nmany other metallic solutions, such as those of mercury, copper, silver\r\nand bismuth, yield a black precipitate with this test.\r\n\r\n2. _Chromate of potass_, both in the state of proto-chromate and\r\nbichromate, causes a fine gamboge-yellow precipitate, the chromate of\r\nlead. For the characteristic action of this reagent, it is desirable\r\nthat the suspected liquid be neutral. It forms with solutions of the\r\nsulphate of copper a precipitate nearly of the same colour as the\r\nchromate of lead.\r\n\r\n3. _Hydriodate of potass_ causes also a lively gamboge-yellow\r\nprecipitate, the iodide of lead. The action of this test is impaired in\r\ndelicacy by a considerable excess of nitric acid, or acetic acid. These\r\nacids cause a yellow coloration with the test, though no lead be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n4. _A rod of zinc_ held for some time in the solution displaces the\r\nlead, taking its place, and throwing down the lead in the form of a\r\ncrystalline arborescence. This is a very characteristic test; and also\r\none of much delicacy; for I have found a small thread of zinc will very\r\neasily detect a twentieth part of a grain of lead dissolved in the form\r\nof acetate in 20,000 parts of water. It acts also on the nitrate of\r\nlead. Its action is impaired or prevented by an excess of acetic or\r\nnitric acid.\r\n\r\nThese tests are amply sufficient for determining the presence of lead in\r\na solution, provided they act characteristically. Others have been also\r\nused, however; and it is therefore right to notice them cursorily.\r\n\r\nThe _alkaline carbonates_ throw down a white precipitate in a very\r\ndiluted solution of lead. This test is ineligible, because the alkaline\r\ncarbonates cause a white precipitate with many other salts. It might be\r\nrendered decisive, however, by washing the precipitate thoroughly,\r\nsuspending it in pure water and transmitting sulphuretted-hydrogen,\r\nwhich blackens it. No other white carbonate is similarly altered except\r\nthose of bismuth and silver, which are rare.\r\n\r\nThe _soluble sulphates_ likewise cause with solutions of lead a white\r\nprecipitate, the sulphate of lead. To this test the same objections\r\napply as to the carbonates of the alkalis.\r\n\r\nThe _ferro-cyanate of potash_ causes a white precipitate, the\r\nferro-cyanate of lead. This is an objectionable test, as many other\r\nsubstances besides lead are similarly acted on by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        4. _Goulard’s Extract._\r\n\r\nGoulard’s extract, the diacetate of lead, is easily distinguished from\r\nthe acetate or sugar of lead by the effect of a stream of carbonic acid,\r\nwhich throws down a copious precipitate of carbonate of lead. The proper\r\nmethod of analyzing it is to transmit this gas till it ceases to act any\r\nlonger, and then to subject the precipitate and solution to the tests\r\nfor carbonate of lead, and acetate of lead. Solutions of the common\r\nacetate usually give a scanty white precipitate with carbonic acid, in\r\nconsequence of containing a faint excess of oxide.\r\n\r\nThe presence of vegetable or animal matters may either decompose the\r\nsalts of lead, or materially alter the action of the preceding reagents.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the experiments of Orfila, that most vegetable infusions\r\npossess the power of decomposing them more or less. The acetate\r\nfurnishes, for example, an abundant precipitate with infusion of galls,\r\nor with infusion of tea. Almost all animal fluids, with the exception of\r\ngelatin, possess the same property; albumen, milk, bile, beef-tea, all\r\ngive with it a copious precipitate. In fluids which do not decompose it\r\naltogether, the colour of the precipitate formed by the tests is so\r\nmaterially altered, that they cannot be relied on for the detection of\r\nlead. The test, however, which undergoes least alteration is\r\nhydrosulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to the detection of lead in complex organic mixtures,\r\nsome remarks will be required on its relations to medical police. Here\r\nthe various ways in which it is apt to be insidiously introduced into\r\nthe body, chiefly by the action of chemical agents on metallic lead\r\nitself, will come under consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Of the Action of Air and Pure Water on Lead._\r\n\r\nWhen lead is exposed to the air it becomes tarnished. This arises from a\r\nthin crust of carbonate of lead being formed; for the crust dissolves\r\nwith brisk effervescence in acetic acid. The formation of carbonate is\r\naccelerated by moisture and probably by the presence of an unusual\r\nproportion of carbonic acid in the air.\r\n\r\nThe action of water on lead, which is of much greater consequence, has\r\nbeen made the subject of observation by the curious for many ages. The\r\nRoman architect, Vitruvius, who, it is believed, nourished in the time\r\nof Cæsar and Augustus, forbids the use of this metal for conducting\r\nwater, because cerusse, he says, is formed on it, which is hurtful to\r\nthe human body.[1224] Galen also condemns the use of lead pipes, because\r\nhe was aware, that water transmitted through them contracted a muddiness\r\nfrom the lead, and those who drank such water were subject to\r\ndysentery.[1225] If we trace the sciences of architecture, chemistry,\r\nand medicine downwards from these periods, nothing more will be found\r\nthan a repetition of the statements of Vitruvius and Galen, with but a\r\nfew particular facts in support of them, till we arrive at the close of\r\nthe last and beginning of the present century.\r\n\r\nThe first person that examined the subject minutely, was Dr. Lambe of\r\nWarwick; who inferred from his researches, that most, if not all, spring\r\nwaters possess the power of corroding and dissolving lead to such an\r\nextent as to be rendered unfit for the use of man, and that this solvent\r\npower is imparted to them by some of their saline ingredients.[1226] The\r\ninquiry was afterwards undertaken more scientifically by Guyton-Morveau;\r\nwho, in opposition to Dr. Lambe, arrived at the conclusion, that\r\ndistilled water, the purest of all waters, acts rapidly on lead by\r\nconverting it into a hydrated oxide, and that some natural waters, which\r\nhardly attack lead at all, are prevented doing so by the salts they hold\r\nin solution.[1227] A few years later Dr. Thomson of Glasgow also\r\nexamined the subject, and, assenting to Dr. Lambe’s proposition, that\r\nmost spring waters attack lead, maintains nevertheless that the lead is\r\nonly held in suspension, not in solution; and that the quantity\r\nsuspended in such waters, after they have passed through lead pipes,\r\npumps, and cisterns, is too minute to prove injurious to those who make\r\nhabitual use of them.[1228] In the first edition of this work an\r\nextended account was given of an investigation I made into the whole\r\nsubject of the action of different waters on lead.[1229] Additional\r\nobservations were afterwards published on the same point by Captain\r\nYorke,[1230] and by Mr. Taylor.[1231] And I have added some new facts in\r\na late paper.[1232]\r\n\r\nThe inquiry is of so great practical consequence, that I need not offer\r\nany apology for reproducing it here in detail, with such additions as\r\nulterior experience and the researches of others enable me to make.\r\nProfessor Orfila takes no notice of this important subject, except in a\r\nfew lines containing several inaccurate statements.[1233]\r\n\r\nDistilled water, deprived of its gases by ebullition, and excluded from\r\ncontact with the air, has no action whatever on lead. If the water\r\ncontains the customary gases in solution, the surface of the metal,\r\nfreshly polished, becomes quickly dull and white. But if the surface of\r\nthe water be not at the same time exposed to the air, the action soon\r\ncomes to a close.—When the air, on the other hand, is allowed free\r\naccess to the water, a white powder appears in a few minutes on and\r\naround the lead; and this goes on increasing till in the course of a few\r\ndays there is formed a large quantity of white matter which partly\r\nfloats in the water or adheres to the lead, but is chiefly deposited on\r\nthe bottom of the vessel. If this experiment be made with atmospheric\r\nair deprived of carbonic acid, the white substance puts on the form of a\r\nfine powder, which I find to be a hydrated oxide; for when dried at\r\n180°F. it gives off water on being heated to redness, and dissolves\r\nwithout effervescence in weak nitric acid.—But if the surface of the\r\nwater be exposed to the open air, the substance formed consists of\r\nminute brilliant pearly scales, which with the aid of a powerful\r\nmicroscope are seen to be thin equilateral triangular tables, often\r\ngrouped into hexaedral tables, or worn at the edges into the form of\r\nrosettes. This substance, which has a pale grayish hue when dried, I\r\nhave ascertained to be a carbonate of lead, consisting of two\r\nequivalents of neutral carbonate and one of hydrated protoxide.[1234]\r\nThe formation of carbonate takes place with considerable rapidity. In\r\ntwelve ounces of distilled water, contained in a shallow glass basin\r\nloosely covered to exclude the dust, twelve brightly polished lead rods\r\nweighing 340 grains, will lose two grains and a half in eight days; and\r\nthe lead will then show evident marks of corrosion. The process of\r\ncorrosion goes on so long as atmospheric air is allowed to play freely\r\non the surface of the water. In twenty months I have obtained 120 grains\r\nfrom an ounce of lead rods kept in 24 ounces of distilled water.\r\n\r\nDuring these changes, a minute quantity of lead is dissolved. This is\r\nbest proved by carefully filtering the water, then acidulating with a\r\ndrop or two of nitric acid, and evaporating to dryness. I have never\r\nfailed to detect lead in the residue by expelling the excess of nitric\r\nacid by heat, dissolving it in distilled water, and applying\r\nhydrosulphuric acid, hydriodate of potass, and chromate of potass to the\r\nsolution. The lead is first dissolved in the form of hydrated oxide.\r\nFor, if the air admitted to the water be deprived of carbonic acid, a\r\nclear liquid is obtained by filtration, and this is turned brown by\r\nhydrosulphuric acid. But a great part of the hydrate is speedily\r\nseparated in the form of carbonate. For the filtered liquid speedily\r\nbecomes turbid if exposed to the air; and on evaporating it, the\r\nresiduum dissolves in weak nitric acid with brisk effervescence. Captain\r\nYorke estimates the quantity dissolved when the water is saturated at a\r\n10,000th part.[1235]\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest part of the lead, however, which disappears, will be\r\nfound in the white pearly crystals. This crystalline powder is not,—as\r\nalleged by Guyton-Morveau, and after him by some systematic writers, a\r\nhydrated oxide of lead, but, as stated above, a particular variety of\r\ncarbonate, containing more hydrated oxide than exists in common white\r\nlead. At first I thought it was neutral carbonate. Captain Yorke was led\r\nto suppose it hydrated oxide. In 1842 I found that, if it be exposed for\r\nsome time to the action of aërated water after the lead has been\r\nremoved, it invariably consists of two equivalents of neutral carbonate\r\nand one of hydrated oxide.\r\n\r\nIt will be inferred from the preceding facts, that distilled water for\r\neconomical use should never be preserved in leaden vessels or otherwise\r\nin contact with lead. Even the distilled water of aromatic plants should\r\nnot be so preserved, because the essential oil which communicates to\r\nthem their fragrance does not take away the power which pure distilled\r\nwater possesses of acting on lead. This fact was first announced in the\r\nsecond edition of the present work. A druggist in Edinburgh requested me\r\nto examine a reddish-gray crystalline, pearly sediment formed copiously\r\nin a sample of orange-flower water. I found this to be carbonate of lead\r\ncoloured by the colouring matter of the water, and obviously produced by\r\nthe action of the water on lead solder used instead of tin solder, and\r\ncoarsely and liberally applied to the seams of the copper vessel in\r\nwhich the water had been imported from France. The filtered fluid did\r\nnot contain a particle of lead. The same observation has been since made\r\nby a French pharmaceutic chemist, M. Barateau, who seems at a loss,\r\nhowever, to account for the formation of the carbonate of lead.[1236] It\r\nappears from an inquiry of MM. Labarraque and Pelletier, conducted at\r\nthe request of the Prefecture of Paris, that the orange-flower water,\r\nwhich is extensively used there, is often adulterated with lead in\r\nsolution. They impute this to careless distillation; for then some of\r\nthe decoction is driven over with the distilled liquid, and consequently\r\nproduces a fluid which becomes acetous by keeping and dissolves the lead\r\nsolder of the _estagnons_ or copper vessels. Pure orange-flower water\r\ndoes not acidify by keeping.[1237] M. Chevallier in a more recent\r\ninvestigation arrived at the same results, and found that few specimens\r\nof the orange-flower water of Paris were altogether free of lead.[1238]\r\nIn none of these inquiries have the authors adverted to the action of\r\npure water in forming carbonate of lead.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Of the Action of Solutions of Neutral Salts on Lead._\r\n\r\nThe property which pure aërated water possesses of corroding lead is\r\nvariously affected by foreign ingredients which it may hold in solution.\r\n\r\nOf these modifying substances none are more remarkable in their action\r\nthan the neutral salts, which all impair the corrosive power of the\r\nwater. Important practical consequences flow from that action; for it\r\ninvolves no less than the possibility of employing lead for most of the\r\neconomical purposes to which the ingenuity of man has applied that\r\nuseful metal. The first experimentalist who made it an object of\r\nattention was Guyton-Morveau; whose experiments are imperfect and in\r\nsome respects erroneous. Having found that distilled water corrodes\r\nlead, he proceeded to inquire why no change of the kind takes place in\r\nsome natural waters; and being aware that most spring and river waters\r\ndiffer from that which has been distilled, chiefly in containing\r\nsulphate of lime and muriate of soda, he tried a solution of each of\r\nthese salts, and discovered that the addition of a certain quantity of\r\neither to distilled water takes away from it the power of attacking\r\nlead,—that this preservative power is possessed by so small a proportion\r\nas a 500th part of sulphate of lime in the water,—and that the nitrates\r\nare also probably endowed with the same singular property.[1239] Here\r\nhis researches terminated.\r\n\r\nExtending Guyton-Morveau’s inquiries to other proportions of the same\r\nsalts, and likewise to many other neutral salts, I was led to the\r\nconclusion, that all of them without exception possess the power of\r\nimpairing the action of distilled water on lead. At least I found this\r\npower to exist in the case of sulphates, muriates, carbonates,\r\nhydriodates, phosphates, nitrates, acetates, tartrates, and arseniates.\r\n\r\nThe degree of this preservative power differs much in different salts.\r\nThe acetate of soda is but an imperfect preventive when dissolved in the\r\nproportion of a hundredth part of the water: white crystals are formed,\r\nand the lead loses about a fourth of what is lost in distilled water in\r\nthe same time. On the contrary, arseniate of soda is a complete\r\npreservative when dissolved in the proportion of a 12,000th; and\r\nphosphate of soda and hydriodate of potass are almost effectual\r\npreservatives in the proportion of a 30,000th part only of the\r\nwater.[1240] Muriate of soda and sulphate of lime hold a middle place\r\nbetween these extremes, and are both of them much more powerful than\r\nGuyton-Morveau imagined: the former preserves in the proportion of a\r\n2000th to the water, the latter in the proportion of nearly a 4000th.\r\nNitrate of potass is little superior to the acetate of soda: in the\r\nproportion of a hundredth it prevents the action of the water almost\r\nentirely; but if the proportion be diminished to a 160th, the loss\r\nsustained by the lead is fully a third of the loss in distilled water.\r\n\r\nWhen lead has been exposed for a few weeks to a solution of a protecting\r\nsalt and has acquired a thin film over its surface, it not only is not\r\nacted on by the solution, but is even also rendered incapable of being\r\nacted on by distilled water.\r\n\r\nThe preservative power depends on the acid, not on the base of the salt.\r\nThe acetate, muriate, arseniate, and phosphate of soda differ\r\nexceedingly in power. On the other hand, the sulphates of soda,\r\nmagnesia, and lime, as well as the triple sulphate of alumina and\r\npotass, preserve as nearly as can be determined in the same proportion.\r\n\r\nWhen we attempt to ascertain the relative preserving power of the\r\nneutral salts, it will appear that those whose acid forms with the lead\r\na soluble salt of lead are the least energetic; while those whose acid\r\nforms an insoluble salt of lead are most energetic. The protecting\r\npowers of acetate of soda, nitrate of potass, muriate of soda, sulphate\r\nof lime, arseniate of soda, and phosphate of soda, are inversely as the\r\nsolubility of the acetate, nitrate, muriate, sulphate, arseniate, and\r\nphosphate of lead. The existence of this ratio might naturally lead to\r\nthe inference that the protecting power depends simply on the salt in\r\nsolution being decomposed, so that there is formed on the surface of the\r\nlead a thin crust consisting of the oxide of the metal in union with the\r\nacid of the decomposed salt, and constituting an insoluble film which is\r\nimpermeable to aërated water: for example, that phosphate of soda acts\r\nin the small proportion of a 30,000th part by forming on the surface of\r\nthe metal an impermeable film of phosphate of lead, which is known to be\r\none of the most insoluble of all the neutral salts. But this is not\r\naltogether a correct statement of the fact.\r\n\r\nWhen the protection afforded is complete, as for example by a 27,000th\r\nof phosphate of soda, a 12,000th of arseniate of soda, or a 4000th of\r\nsulphate of soda, the lead undergoes no change in appearance or in\r\nweight for several hours, or even days. At length the surface becomes\r\ndull, then white, and gradually a uniform film is formed over it. This\r\nfilm, examined at an early period, is found to consist of carbonate of\r\nlead,—being entirely soluble in diluted acetic acid, although the salts\r\nin solution is a sulphate or phosphate. But after a few weeks the\r\ncarbonate is mixed with a salt of lead, containing the acid of a part of\r\nthe neutral salt dissolved in the water: if, after five or six weeks’\r\nimmersion in a preservative solution of phosphate or sulphate of soda,\r\nthe film on the lead be scraped off and immersed in diluted acetic acid,\r\neffervescence and solution take place, but a part of the powder remains\r\nundissolved; and if the protecting salt has been the muriate of soda,\r\nthe whole powder is dissolved, but muriatic acid will be found in\r\nsolution by its proper test, the nitrate of silver.—In all such\r\nprotecting solutions the lead gains weight for some weeks; but at length\r\nit ceases to undergo farther change, and is not acted on even if removed\r\ninto distilled water. The crust, when formed thus slowly, adheres with\r\ngreat firmness. The most careful analysis cannot detect any lead, either\r\ndissolved in the water, or floating in it, or united with the insoluble\r\nmatter left on the side of the glass by evaporation. In short, the\r\npreservation of the lead from corrosion, and of the water from\r\nimpregnation with lead, is complete.[1241]\r\n\r\nWhen the protection afforded is not quite complete,—for example in\r\ndistilled water containing a 4000th of muriate of soda, a 6000th of\r\nsulphate of soda, a 15,000th of arseniate of soda, or a 35,000th of\r\nphosphate of soda,—besides a powdery crust, small crystals, with several\r\nfacettes, are sometimes formed on the lead, while, at the same time, a\r\nminute white film will very slowly appear on the bottom of the glass, on\r\nits side where it is left dry by the evaporation of the water, and\r\nlikewise on the surface of the water itself. These detached films are\r\ncomposed of carbonate of lead, with a little of the muriate, sulphate,\r\narseniate, or phosphate of lead, according to the nature of the acid in\r\nthe alkaline salt which is dissolved in the water. In the course of the\r\nchanges now described, the lead in general no longer gains, but loses\r\nweight. The loss, however, is exceedingly small.—No lead can be\r\ndiscovered in solution, if the water before evaporation is carefully\r\nfiltered.\r\n\r\nOn progressively trying solutions of weaker and weaker preservative\r\npower, it will be remarked, that the quantity of the detached powder,\r\nand the proportion of carbonate in it, progressively increase; and\r\nlikewise, that what is formed on the lead adheres more and more loosely.\r\nIn distilled water and weak solutions of acetate of soda, or nitrate of\r\npotass, the lead never becomes so firmly encrusted, but that gentle\r\nagitation of the water will shake off the powder.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that, although a small quantity of lead is\r\ndissolved by distilled water after it has remained some time in contact\r\nwith the metal, yet not a trace is found in solution where a protecting\r\nsalt is present. In solutions even weakly preservative I never could\r\ndetect any lead dissolved. Thus, in distilled water containing a 4000th\r\nof muriate of soda, or a 160th of nitre, the lead lost weight, and loose\r\ncrystals of carbonate were formed; yet even after thirty days no lead\r\ncould be found in solution by the process with which I have always\r\ndetected it in pure distilled water. Free exposure to the air is\r\nprobably in part the cause of this. For it will be seen afterwards that\r\nsome natural waters in passing through a long course of lead pipes,\r\nwithin which the action goes on without direct access of the atmosphere,\r\ncontract an impregnation, which is invisible when the water is newly\r\ndrawn, but after a few hours’ exposure to the air shows itself in the\r\nform of a white film and milkiness.\r\n\r\nThe general result of these experiments appears to be, that neutral\r\nsalts in various, and for the most part minute, proportions, retard or\r\nprevent the corrosive action of water on lead,—allowing the carbonate to\r\ndeposit itself slowly, and to adhere with such firmness to the lead as\r\nnot to be afterwards removable by moderate agitation, adding\r\nsubsequently to this crust other insoluble salts of lead, the acids of\r\nwhich are derived from the neutral salts in solution,—and thus at length\r\nforming a permanent impermeable skreen, through which the action of the\r\nwater cannot any longer be carried on.\r\n\r\nAn important subject of inquiry regards the natural causes by which the\r\npreservative power of the neutral salts is impaired. This topic I have\r\nnot hitherto been able to examine with all the care which is desirable.\r\n\r\nFrom the effect of the water of Edinburgh when highly charged with\r\ncarbonic acid, I was led to infer in former editions of this work that\r\nan unusual quantity of carbonic acid is a counteracting agent. For if\r\nEdinburgh water charged with it be corked up with some lead rods in a\r\nphial half-filled with water, and half with atmospheric air, the lead,\r\nwhich in common Edinburgh water, as will presently be mentioned, hardly\r\nloses any of its brilliancy for six or seven days, becomes quite white\r\nin twelve or sixteen hours. Subsequent experiments by Captain Yorke\r\nseemed to him to render this conclusion doubtful; nor do I attach much\r\nconsequence to the observation just quoted. On the other hand it is said\r\nProfessor Daniell has found all waters dissolve lead, if they contain an\r\nexcess of carbonic acid.[1242] The point would be best settled by the\r\neffect of a natural carbonated water passing through a long lead pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _On the Action of Natural Waters on Lead._\r\n\r\nThe preceding observations on the action of water on lead may be\r\nresorted to for explaining many interesting facts, and correcting some\r\nerroneous statements, which have been published by authors as to the\r\ncorrosion of lead by natural processes.\r\n\r\n_Rain and Snow-Water._—It has been stated by Dr. Lambe that rain-water\r\ndoes not corrode lead, that “its effect is so slight as not to be\r\ndiscernible within a moderate compass of time.”[1243] But this\r\nobservation is far from being correct. Rain or snow-water, collected in\r\nthe country at a distance from houses, and before it touches the earth,\r\nbeing nearly as pure as distilled water, ought to act with equal\r\nrapidity on lead. I have accordingly found by a comparative experiment\r\nwith that mentioned in p. 401, that in twelve ounces of snow-water,\r\ncollected ten miles west from Edinburgh, and at some distance from any\r\nhouse, twelve lead rods weighing 340 grains lost two grains in eight\r\ndays, and the usual crystals began to form in less than an hour. But\r\nwhen collected in a great city, rain or snow-water is much impaired in\r\nactivity. Thus in an experiment made with eaves’-droppings collected\r\nfrom the roof of my house in Edinburgh, after half an hour of gentle\r\nrain from the south-east,—the first rain which had fallen for several\r\nweeks,—there was no action at all. Yet even when collected in a great\r\ncity, and in circumstances which at first sight would appear not very\r\nfavourable to its action,—for example from eaves’-droppings a few hours\r\nafter the beginning of a shower,—it retains a little of its corroding\r\nproperty; and when collected in like manner after twelve or twenty-four\r\nhours’ rain, it corrodes almost as rapidly as distilled water. Thus with\r\nfour ounces of eaves’-droppings collected after the shower last alluded\r\nto had continued four hours, the crystalline powder began to cover the\r\nbottom of the glass in five hours, and in nine days three lead rods\r\nweighing fifty-seven grains lost a fifth of a grain. And in another\r\nexperiment made with eaves’-droppings after a day’s steady rain from the\r\nnorth-east, the powder began to form in half an hour, and the loss\r\nsustained by the lead in thirty-three days was a grain and a third,\r\nbeing very nearly what is lost in distilled water during the same time.\r\n\r\nWe must obviously be prepared to look for an explanation of these\r\ndifferences in the relative purity of the different waters. Accordingly,\r\nin the eaves’-droppings at the beginning of the shower the nitrates of\r\nbaryta and silver caused, the former a distinct, the latter a faint\r\nprecipitation, which, as oxalate of ammonia had no effect, arose from\r\nthe presence of alkaline sulphates and muriates: but after a four hours’\r\nshower nitrate of baryta alone acted, and caused merely a faint haze:\r\nand after a twenty-four hours’ shower, as well as in snow-water from the\r\ncountry, none of the three tests had any effect whatever.\r\n\r\nHence, perhaps even in a town, but at all events certainly in the\r\ncountry, it would be wrong to use for culinary purposes rain or\r\nsnow-water which has run from lead roofs or spouts recently erected.\r\nWhen the roof or spout has been exposed for some time to the weather the\r\ndanger is of course much lessened, if not entirely removed; because\r\nexposure to the weather encrusts it with a firmly adhering coat of\r\ncarbonate, through which, as already observed, even distilled water will\r\nnot act. But I believe it would be right to condemn the turning even old\r\nleaden roofs to the purpose of collecting water for the kitchen.\r\nAlthough the purest rain-water cannot act on them when it is once fairly\r\nat repose, we do not know what may be the effect of the impetus of the\r\nfalling rain on the crust of carbonate; and if the crust should happen\r\nto be thus worn considerably, or detached by more obvious accidents, the\r\ncorrosion would then go on with rapidity as long as the shower lasted.\r\nAcid emanations too disengaged in the neighbourhood, and other more\r\nobscure causes may enable rain-water actually to dissolve even the crust\r\nof carbonate.\r\n\r\nThese remarks on the effect of rain-water on lead are pointedly\r\nillustrated by what Tronchin has recorded of the circumstances connected\r\nwith the spreading of the lead colic at Amsterdam, about the time he\r\nwrote his valuable essay on that disease. Till that period lead colic\r\nwas seldom met with in the Dutch capital. But soon after the citizens\r\nbegan to substitute lead for tiles on the roofs of their\r\ndwelling-houses, the disease broke out with violence and committed great\r\nravages. Tronchin very properly ascribed its increase to lead entering\r\nthe body insidiously along with the water, which for culinary purposes\r\nwas chiefly collected from the roofs during rain. He farther attempts to\r\naccount for the rain-water having acquired the power of corroding the\r\nlead, by supposing that it was rendered acid in consequence of the roofs\r\nhaving been covered with decaying leaves from trees which abounded in\r\nthe city; and without a doubt this explanation accords with the season\r\nat which the lead colic was observed to be most frequent,—namely, the\r\nautumn. But he does not seem to have been aware that rain-water itself\r\npossesses the corroding property, independently of any extrinsic\r\ningredient except the gases it receives in its passage through the\r\natmosphere.[1244]—Mérat has referred to a Dutch author, Wanstroostwyk,\r\nfor an account of a similar incident which happened at Haarlem.[1245]\r\n\r\nThe co-operating effect of acid emanations in the atmosphere is well\r\nexemplified by an interesting incident which occurred this year in\r\nManchester, as detailed in some documents put into my hands by Dr.\r\nHibbert Ware. A gentleman being seized with symptoms, which in the\r\nopinion of his medical adviser were owing to the insidious introduction\r\nof lead into the body, it was found by Mr. Davies that the rain-water\r\nfrom a leaden roof, which had been used in the family for nine years,\r\ncontained a considerable impregnation of lead. At first this excited\r\nsome surprise, because the roof was an old one. But on farther inquiry\r\nit was found, that the rain in descending contracted an impregnation of\r\nhydrochloric acid from the vapours which escaped from an adjoining\r\nmanufactory. A portion of the water which was sent to me contained so\r\nmuch lead dissolved that it became dark-brown on the addition of\r\nhydrosulphuric acid, and a considerable black precipitate was slowly\r\ndeposited.\r\n\r\n_Spring Water._—Most spring waters, unlike rain or snow-water, have\r\nlittle or no action on lead, because they generally contain a\r\nconsiderable proportion of muriates and sulphates.\r\n\r\nAs an example of a spring water which does not act on lead at all, the\r\nmineral water of Airthrey, near Stirling, may be mentioned. In four\r\nounces of water from the strongest spring at Airthrey, I kept for\r\nthirty-five days three bright rods of lead weighing 47·007 grains; and\r\nat the end of that period the rods were very nearly as brilliant as when\r\nthey were first put in, and weighed 47·004 grains. This result is easily\r\nexplained on considering the nature of the water. It contains no less\r\nthan a seventy-seventh part of its weight of saline matters, which are\r\nchiefly muriates, and partly sulphates.\r\n\r\nAnother good illustration occurred to me lately, which contrasts well\r\nwith some instances of an opposite description to be mentioned\r\npresently. The house of Phantassie in East-Lothian was supplied with\r\nwater by a lead pipe from a distance of a mile. About a year afterwards,\r\nwhen I had an opportunity of examining into the circumstances, I found\r\nthe cistern singularly clean and free of incrustation, and the water\r\nquite free of lead. The composition of the water explained these facts.\r\nIt contains a 4,900th of salts, a large proportion of which consists of\r\ncarbonates of lime and magnesia.\r\n\r\nThe water of Edinburgh is another example of spring water nearly\r\ndestitute of action on lead. But it is not so completely inactive as the\r\nwater of Airthrey. In four ounces of water three bright rods weighing\r\nfifty-seven grains lost in seven days a 250th of a grain, in twenty-one\r\ndays a 100th, in thirty-five days a 66th, and in sixty-three days a 59th\r\nof a grain. In seven days the lead was hardly tarnished at all, and not\r\na speck of powder could be seen in the water, or on the glass. In\r\ntwenty-one days, but still more in thirty-five or sixty-three days, the\r\nlead was uniformly dull; and on the surface of the water, as well as on\r\nthe bottom of the glass, and on the side where left dry by the\r\nevaporation of the water, there were many white, filmy specks, which\r\nbecame black with the hydrosulphate of ammonia. In another experiment\r\n145 grains of lead kept for six months in six ounces of Edinburgh water,\r\nwhich was filled up as it evaporated, lost a fifteenth of a grain; and\r\nthe white incrustation on the bottom and sides of the glass gave a large\r\nproportion of black precipitate when scraped together and treated with\r\nhydrosulphate of ammonia. These experiments are of some practical\r\nimportance. For they show that the impregnation which the water of\r\nEdinburgh can receive in a few days from being kept in lead is so small\r\nas to be barely perceptible by the nicest analysis; but that the\r\nimpregnation may be material if the same portion of water is kept in\r\nlead for a considerable length of time. Hence the perfect safety of the\r\nleaden cisterns and service-pipes used in this city. The same portion of\r\nwater rarely remains in them above a single day, and therefore cannot\r\nbecome impregnated in a degree that is appreciable by the nicest\r\nexamination. Dr. Thomson of Glasgow, in an interesting inquiry made in\r\n1815 into the purity of the water which supplies Tunbridge, has stated\r\nthat, when he lived in Edinburgh some years before, he could always\r\ndetect a minute trace of lead suspended in the water, which at that time\r\nwas brought six miles in leaden pipes.[1246] I presume it is owing to\r\nthe main pipes being now made of iron that this impregnation no longer\r\nexists. For I have found that the residue of two gallons of water, very\r\ncarefully collected by gentle evaporation of successive portions in a\r\nsmall vessel, did not furnish the slightest trace of lead, when strongly\r\nheated with black flux and then acted on by nitric acid.[1247] The\r\nfeeble action of the Edinburgh water on lead arises from the salts it\r\nholds in solution. It contains about a 12,000th part of its weight of\r\nsolid matter, of which about two-thirds are carbonate of lime, and\r\none-third consists of the sulphates and muriates of soda, lime, and\r\nmagnesia.\r\n\r\nMany instances might be quoted of spring waters which act with\r\ninconvenient or dangerous rapidity on lead. But it is hardly worth while\r\nmentioning more than one or two of these, because the nature of the\r\nwaters has been seldom described.\r\n\r\nA striking example was related by Dr. Wall of Worcester. A family in\r\nthat town, consisting of the parents and twenty-one children, were\r\nconstantly liable to stomach and bowel complaints; and eight of the\r\nchildren and both parents died in consequence. Their house being sold\r\nafter their death, the purchaser found it necessary to repair the pump;\r\nbecause the cylinder and cistern were riddled with holes and as thin as\r\na sieve. The plumber who renewed it informed Dr. Wall that he had\r\nrepaired it several times before, and in particular had done so not four\r\nyears before the former occupant died.[1248] The nature of the water was\r\nnot determined. Most of the water around Worcester is very hard; but\r\nthis will not account for its operation in the instance now described.\r\n\r\nAnother incident of the same kind, but hardly so unequivocal in its\r\ncircumstances, was related in 1823 by Dr. Yeats of Tunbridge. A plumber\r\nundertook to supply that town with water for domestic purposes, and in\r\n1814 laid a course of leaden pipes for a quarter of a mile. In the\r\nsubsequent year many cases of lead colic occurred among the inhabitants\r\nwho were supplied by those pipes; and one lady particularly, who was a\r\ngreat water-drinker, lost the use of her limbs for some months. The\r\ninhabitants naturally became alarmed; iron pipes were substituted; and\r\nno case of colic appeared afterwards. Mr. Brande analyzed the water\r\nwhich had passed through the pipes and detected lead in it, while at the\r\nsame time none could be detected at the source.[1249] Some uncertainty\r\nwas supposed to have been thrown over these statements by the analytic\r\nresearches of Drs. Thomson, Scudamore, and Prout, and Mr.\r\nChildren.[1250] But water like that in question can scarce fail to act\r\npowerfully on lead in favourable circumstances; for according to the\r\nanalysis of Dr. Thomson it is extremely pure, as it contains only a\r\n38,000th part of saline matter, three-fourths of which are a feebly\r\nprotecting salt, the muriate of soda.[1251] I am satisfied, therefore,\r\nfrom my experiments, and the facts which follow, that no such water\r\ncould be safely conveyed through new lead pipes; and that it would be\r\ndangerous even to keep it long in a lead cistern. It is difficult to\r\naccount for the failure of the gentlemen above mentioned to find lead in\r\nthe water, except by supposing that they had analyzed what had been\r\nexposed for some time to the air, and deposited its oxide of lead in the\r\nform of carbonate.\r\n\r\nSince my attention was first turned to this subject, the three following\r\nincidents have occurred to me, which show the danger of conveying very\r\npure water in long lead pipes. 1. A gentleman in Dumfries-shire resolved\r\nto bring to his house in leaden pipes the water of a fine spring on his\r\nestate, from a distance of three-quarters of a mile. As I happened to\r\nvisit him at the time, I took the opportunity of examining the action of\r\na tumbler of the water on fresh cut lead, and could not remark any\r\nperceptible effect in fourteen days. It appeared to me, therefore, that\r\nthe water might be safely conveyed in lead pipes; and they were laid\r\naccordingly. No sooner, however, did the water come into use in the\r\nfamily, than it was observed to present a general white haze, and the\r\nglass decanters in daily use acquired a manifest white, pearly\r\nincrustation. On examining the cistern, the surface of the water, as\r\nwell as that of the cistern itself, where in contact with it, was found\r\ncompletely white, as if coated with paint; and the water taken directly\r\nfrom the pipe, though transparent at first, became hazy and white when\r\nheated or left some hours exposed to the air. On afterwards analyzing\r\nthe water direct from the spring, I found it of very unusual purity; as\r\nit contained scarcely a 22,000th of solid ingredients, which were\r\nsulphates, muriates, and carbonates. The reader can be at no loss to\r\nperceive why the experiment with a few sticks of lead in a tumbler was\r\nnot a correct representation of what was subsequently to go on in the\r\npipes: in fact, as the pipes were 4000 feet long, and three-fourths of\r\nan inch in diameter, each portion of water may be considered as passing\r\nsuccessively over no less than 784 square feet of lead before being\r\ndischarged. The remedy employed in this case will be mentioned presently\r\n[p. 415]. 2. A gentleman in Banffshire introduced a fine spring into his\r\nhouse from a distance of three-quarters of a mile by means of a lead\r\npipe. Two years and a half afterwards he was attacked with stomach\r\ncomplaints, obstinate constipation, and severe colic, for which he was\r\nunder medical treatment for three months, with only partial and\r\ntemporary relief. At last on leaving home and repairing to Edinburgh, he\r\nsoon got quite well. Two other members of his family were similarly, but\r\nmore slightly affected. On returning home some time afterwards, the same\r\nsymptoms began to show themselves; but he had not been many weeks there,\r\nwhen his attention was accidentally drawn to a notice of my experiments,\r\nand of the last case, in Chambers’s Journal. He then saw that a white\r\nfilm lined the inside of the water-bottle in his dressing-room; and the\r\nwater was declared by a chemist to contain lead. I lately had an\r\nopportunity of analyzing the water, and found it to contain only a\r\n16,500th of solid matter, the principal salt being chloride of sodium,\r\nand the others being sulphates of magnesia and lime, with very little\r\ncarbonate. This, therefore, was exactly a case in which action upon lead\r\nmight have been anticipated, as the principal proportion of the very\r\nsmall quantity of saline matter present was a feebly protective salt. 3.\r\nThe third instance occurred at a country residence of Lord Aberdeen. Mr.\r\nJohnston, surgeon at Peterhead, being called to visit the housekeeper,\r\nfound her affected with vomiting, constipation, acute pain at the pit of\r\nthe stomach, retraction of the navel, and great feebleness. Little\r\nimprovement was effected in three days, when Mr. Johnston, astonished at\r\nthis, and reflecting on the cause, suddenly was attracted by the\r\nappearance of a silvery film on the inside of his patient’s\r\nwater-bottle, and recollected at the same time my narrative of the\r\nDumfries-shire case. He then perceived that the disease was lead-colic,\r\ntreated it accordingly, and slowly accomplished a cure. The\r\nhousekeeper’s niece, a young girl who had resided only a few weeks with\r\nher, and who was the only other individual that had lived in the house\r\nabove a few days together for more than a year before, had begun also to\r\nsuffer from the premonitory symptoms. About twelve months before this\r\nincident happened, a spring of water, which had been analyzed and\r\npronounced extremely pure, was brought to the house in a lead pipe; and\r\nthe housekeeper had used this water for eight months before she took\r\nill. Mr. Johnston found that the water issued from the pipe was quite\r\nclear, but that a white silvery film formed on its surface under\r\nexposure to the air; and he ascertained that the first-drawn water\r\ncontained lead in solution, and that the film was carbonate of lead. I\r\nhad an opportunity of analyzing the water, which proved to be by no\r\nmeans very pure, as it contained a 4460th of solids. But as the solid\r\nmatter consisted almost entirely of chlorides, namely, in a great\r\nmeasure of chloride of sodium and a very little of the chlorides of\r\nmagnesium and calcium, as there was no carbonate present, and the\r\nsulphates constituted only a 32,000th of the water,—it is plain from the\r\nprinciples formerly laid down that the action which took place was to be\r\nanticipated from the nature of the spring.[1252]\r\n\r\nFor other instances of the corrosive action of spring water on lead the\r\nreader may refer to Dr. Lambe’s treatise. Dr. Lambe was led by his\r\nresearches to imagine that no spring water whatever was destitute of\r\nthis property in a dangerous degree. This wide conclusion is not\r\nsupported by valid facts. Yet his work contains several accurative and\r\ninstructive examples of the action in question. Thus among other\r\ninstances he mentions that he had found the water of Warwick to act on\r\nlead with great rapidity, and once saw holes and furrows in a cistern\r\nthere, which was the second that had been used in the course of ten\r\nyears.[1253] Sir G. Baker, in a letter to Dr. Heberden, has related\r\nanother striking instance of the same kind. Lord Ashburnham’s house in\r\nSussex was supplied from some distance with water, which was conveyed in\r\nleaden pipes. The servants being often affected with colic, which had\r\neven proved fatal to some of them, the water was carefully examined, and\r\nfound to contain lead. The solvent power of the water was ascribed to\r\nits containing an unusual quantity of carbonic acid gas.[1254] This may\r\nbe doubted.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the preceding remarks, allusion has been made to the\r\ndanger of keeping the same portion of water for a length of time in\r\nleaden cisterns, if it has the power of acting on lead even in a\r\ntrifling degree. The following illustrations deserve particular notice.\r\n\r\nIt was mentioned in p. 409, as the result of experiments on the small\r\nscale, that although the water of Edinburgh does not contract a sensible\r\nimpregnation of lead on remaining a few days in contact with it, yet a\r\nsufficient action ensues in the course of a few months, to show that it\r\nmight be dangerous to keep that water long in a lead cistern. After\r\ncoming to this conclusion, I had an opportunity of verifying it on a\r\nlarge scale. A cistern in my laboratory in the University having been\r\nleft undisturbed for four or five months with about six inches of water\r\nin it, I found so large a quantity of pearly crystals lying loose on the\r\ncistern and diffused through the water, that when the whole was shaken\r\nup and transferred to a glass vessel, the water appeared quite opaque.\r\nMérat observes that at the laboratory of the Medical Faculty of Paris\r\nthere was procured by evaporating six loads, or probably about 1000\r\npounds of water, which had been kept two months in a leaden pneumatic\r\ntrough, no less than two ounces of finely crystallized carbonate of\r\nlead.[1255] Water in such circumstances has proved eminently poisonous.\r\nThus, the crew of an East India packet having been put on short\r\nallowance of water, in consequence of being delayed by contrary winds,\r\nthe men got their share each in a bottle; but the officers united their\r\nshares and kept it all in a lead cistern. In three weeks all the\r\nofficers began to suffer from stomach and bowel complaints, and had the\r\nlead colic for six weeks; while the men continued to enjoy good health.\r\nThe surgeon detected lead in a tumbler of water without the process of\r\nconcentration, by adding to it the sulphuret of potass.[1256] A similar\r\naccident has been briefly alluded to by Van Swieten. He mentions, that\r\nhe was acquainted with a family who were all attacked with colica\r\npictonum in consequence of using for culinary purposes water collected\r\nin a large leaden cistern and kept there for a long time.[1257] The\r\ncomposition of the water has not been mentioned in any of these\r\ninstances; but the water of Paris is so strongly impregnated with\r\ncalcareous salts, that in ordinary circumstances its action on lead must\r\nbe trifling.\r\n\r\nIt was probably from confounding the consequences of keeping the same\r\nwater long in a lead cistern with the action in ordinary circumstances,\r\nthat Dr. Lambe was led into the error of supposing that all spring\r\nwaters whatever act on lead so powerfully, as to render it in his\r\nopinion advisable to abandon the use of this metal in the fabrication of\r\npipes and cisterns. It must be admitted, however, that in all likelihood\r\nmany waters will contain a trace of lead, without being kept more than\r\nthe usual time in the pipe or cistern. For Dr. Lambe’s results\r\ncorrespond to a certain extent with the more recent and accurate\r\nresearches of Dr. Thomson, who mentions many instances where a faint\r\ntrace of lead was found in the residue of the evaporation of a large\r\nquantity of spring water by himself, as well as by Dr. Dalton, Dr.\r\nWollaston, and Mr. Children.[1258] But, as Dr. Thomson properly adds,\r\nwhen the quantity does not exceed a 600,000th or a millionth part of the\r\nwater, as in these instances, it is ridiculous to imagine that any harm\r\ncan result to man from the constant use of it for domestic purposes.\r\n\r\nAnother fact of some practical consequence, which flows from the\r\nexperimental conclusions stated above is, that although it may be\r\nperfectly safe to keep some waters in leaden cisterns, it may be very\r\nunsafe to use covers of this metal, because the water which condenses on\r\nthe covers must be considered as pure as distilled water. It has been\r\nfound that white lead forms in much larger quantity on the inside of the\r\ncovers of cisterns than on the cisterns themselves, where both are\r\nconstructed of lead. A remarkable illustration of this is mentioned in a\r\npaper read before the Academy of Sciences at Paris in 1788 by the Comte\r\nde Milly. About a year after getting two leaden cisterns erected in his\r\nhouse, to keep the water of the Seine for general domestic purposes, he\r\nwas attacked with severe and obstinate colic; which led him to examine\r\nhis cisterns. He found that the sides, where they were occasionally left\r\nexposed by the subsidence of the water, and more especially the leaden\r\ncover, were lined with a white liquid, which was constantly dropping\r\nfrom the lid into the cistern, like the drops in caverns where\r\nstalactites are formed. The water was in consequence so strongly\r\nimpregnated with lead as to give a dark precipitate with liver of\r\nsulphur.[1259] The reason of this occurrence is, that the water in the\r\ncistern is a solution of preventive salts, but what reaches the lid is\r\nin a manner distilled. In Edinburgh the lids of the cisterns are\r\ninvariably made of wood, whether on account of its superior cheapness\r\nmerely, or because a leaden cover had been found perishable, I have not\r\nbeen able to discover.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to conclude these remarks on the action of spring waters\r\non lead with a general summary of the chief circumstances to be adverted\r\nto in using lead for keeping or conveying water; to which may be added a\r\nfew hints for preventing action where it is found to have taken place.\r\n\r\nThe general results of the preceding inquiries are that rain or\r\nsnow-water for culinary use should not be collected from leaden roofs,\r\nnor preserved nor conveyed in lead;—that the same rule applies to spring\r\nwaters of unusual purity, where for example the saline impregnation does\r\nnot exceed a 15,000th of the water;—that spring water which contains a\r\n10,000th or 12,000th of salts may be safely conveyed in lead pipes, if\r\nthe salts in the water be chiefly carbonates and sulphates;—that lead\r\npipes cannot be safely used, even where the water contains a 4000th of\r\nsaline matter, if this consist chiefly of muriates;—that spring water,\r\neven though it contain a large proportion of salts, should not be kept\r\nfor a long period in contact with lead;—and that cisterns should not be\r\ncovered with lids of this metal.\r\n\r\nWhere action is observed to take place in the instance of particular\r\nwaters, it may in some cases be impossible to prevent it by any\r\nattainable means. But the inquiries detailed above suggest two modes by\r\nwhich a remedy may be generally found. It appears that, where a crust of\r\ncarbonate is allowed to form slowly and quietly on the surface of lead,\r\neven distilled water ceases to have any material action; and that the\r\naction is reduced almost to nothing if a crust be thus formed in a\r\nsolution containing a minute quantity of some powerfully protecting\r\nsalt, such as phosphate of soda. It appears to me then that a remedy may\r\nbe often found in the instance of unusually pure spring waters—either by\r\nleaving the new pipes filled with the water for a few months, care being\r\ntaken not draw any water from them in the interval,—or perhaps even more\r\neffectually by filling the pipes for a similar period with a solution\r\ncontaining about a 25,000th of phosphate of soda. I had determined to\r\ntry the latter plan with the pipes in the Dumfries-shire case mentioned\r\nabove, but recommended that in the first instance the pipes should be\r\nleft for a few months full of the water of the spring, and the\r\nstop-cocks kept carefully shut; and on this being done for three or four\r\nmonths, it was found that the water afterwards passed with scarcely any\r\nimpregnation of lead, and what little was contracted at first gradually\r\ndiminished in the course of time.—Probably neither of these methods will\r\nbe of more than temporary use, when the chief or only salt present is\r\nchloride of sodium, even though the proportion be considerable. Both\r\nplans seemed to answer for a time in the instance which occurred at Lord\r\nAberdeen’s (p. 411); but after a while the action recommenced, probably\r\nowing to the deposited carbonate being slowly dissolved. At the time of\r\npublication of my paper in the Transactions of the Royal Society of\r\nEdinburgh, the cure appeared complete, and was there represented to be\r\nso.\r\n\r\nI should add that an effectual remedy has been lately introduced by a\r\npatent invention for covering lead pipes both externally and internally\r\nwith a thin coating of tin.\r\n\r\nIn the remarks now made on the action of water on lead no account has\r\nbeen taken of the effect of the galvanic fluid in promoting it. This,\r\nhowever, is a most important co-operating agent, or rather perhaps it\r\nought to be considered a distinct power; for it acts with energy where\r\nwater alone acts least, namely, when there is saline matter in solution,\r\nbecause then a galvanic current of greater force is excited. In general\r\nit is necessary that two different metals be present in the water before\r\ngalvanic action be excited; but a very slight difference may be\r\nsufficient. For example, it seems enough that the lead contain here and\r\nthere impurities, constituting alloys slightly different from the\r\ngeneral mass of the pipe or cistern. It is probable that galvanic action\r\nmay be thus excited by the joinings being soldered with the usual\r\nmixture of lead and the more fusible metals. At least I have seen pipes\r\ndeeply corroded externally, when made of sheets of lead rolled and\r\nsoldered; and the action was deepest on each side of the solder, which\r\nhad itself entirely escaped corrosion. Even inequalities in the\r\ncomposition of the lead may have the same effect. Sheet lead long\r\nexposed to air or water is sometimes observed to be corroded in\r\nparticular spots; and these will always be found in the neighbourhood of\r\nparts of the metal differing in colour, hardness or texture from the\r\ngeneral mass. I have not analyzed such spots; but I conceive the\r\nsupposition now made is exceedingly probable, and supplies a ready\r\nexplanation of the corrosion. Similar effects may arise simply from\r\nfragments of other metals lying long in contact with the lead. They may\r\nalso arise from portions of mortar being allowed to lie on the lead; but\r\nthe action here is not galvanic.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that many of the instances of unusually rapid corrosion\r\nof lead by water, such as that mentioned by Dr. Wall [p. 410] are really\r\nowing, not to the simple action of water, but to an action excited\r\nobscurely in one or other of the ways now mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Of the Action of Acidulous Fluids on Lead and its Oxide._\r\n\r\nWater acidulated with various acids acts on lead with different degrees\r\nof rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe effect of acidulation with _carbonic acid_ has not yet been\r\naccurately ascertained. The effect of _sulphuric acid_ is peculiar.\r\nDistilled water feebly acidulated with that acid acts much less rapidly\r\non lead than when quite pure. Thus I have found that, if it contained a\r\n4000th or even only a 7000th of sulphuric acid, fifty grains of lead\r\nkept in it for thirty-two days gained a seventh or a twelfth of a grain\r\nin weight, and were covered with beautiful crystals of sulphate of lead.\r\nA minute trace of lead could be detected in the water. _Hydrochloric\r\nacid_ is somewhat more active as a solvent. Distilled water containing a\r\n3000th of that acid acquired in thirty-two days a sweetish taste, and\r\nyielded by evaporation a considerable quantity of muriate of lead, while\r\nthe lead rods lost weight, and were covered with acicular crystals of\r\nthe same salt.\r\n\r\nIt is much more important, however, to consider the effects of the\r\nvegetable acids on lead and its oxide, because their solvent power is a\r\nfruitful source of the accidental as well as intentional adulteration of\r\nmany articles of food and drink.\r\n\r\n_Acetic acid_ in the form of common vinegar, even when much diluted,\r\nattacks and dissolves metallic lead, if by exposing the surface of the\r\nfluid to the air, a constant supply of oxygen be maintained to produce\r\noxidation. The _citric acid_ will attack it under the same\r\ncircumstances, but acts more slowly. In a solution of five grains of\r\ncitric acid in twenty-four parts or two drachms of water, three lead\r\nrods lost two grains in weight in nine weeks. The greater part of the\r\ncitrate of lead separated slowly in white powdery crystals; but a small\r\nportion was dissolved by the excess of acid, and imparted to the fluid a\r\npleasant sweetness. _Tartaric acid_ acts much less energetically. In a\r\ncomparative experiment with the last, the lead gained nearly half a\r\ngrain in weight by acquiring a crystalline coat of tartrate of lead. But\r\nI could not detect any lead in solution; and there was no loose powder.\r\nThe tartrate of lead is very sparingly soluble in an excess of its acid,\r\nso that a sweet taste cannot be communicated by it to a fluid acidulated\r\nwith tartaric acid. _Malic acid_, according to MM. Chevallier and\r\nOllivier, acts so quickly as a solvent, that if a solution be kept in a\r\nlead vessel for three hours, the metal may be detected in the fluid by\r\nany of its ordinary tests.[1260]\r\n\r\nThe acids act with greater rapidity on the protoxide of lead than on the\r\nmetal; and the presence of air is of course not required to enable them\r\nto effect its solution.\r\n\r\nThe solvent power of the acids is liable to be counteracted by various\r\nsubstances; the operation of which, however, has not been well\r\nascertained. It appears that substances containing gallic acid or tannin\r\nthrow down the lead; and on this account various adulterations which\r\nwould otherwise take place are either prevented or corrected. It has\r\nbeen also ascertained by Proust, that the vegetable acids do not attack\r\nlead when it is alloyed with tin. For as the latter metal has a stronger\r\nattraction than the former for acids, no lead can be oxidated before the\r\ntin undergoes that change.[1261]\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said of the action of the vegetable acids, it follows\r\nthat the preparation or preservation of articles of food and drink in\r\nleaden vessels is fraught with danger. For, if they contain a vegetable\r\nacid, more particularly the acetic, as many of them do, and if they are\r\nallowed to remain in the vessel for a moderate length of time, they will\r\nbe apt to be impregnated with the metal. In this way lead has been often\r\ninsidiously introduced into the food of man.\r\n\r\nThus milk has been poisoned by being kept in leaden troughs. An instance\r\nof the kind has been related by Dr. Darwin. A farmer’s daughter used to\r\nwipe the cream from the edge of the milk which was kept in leaden\r\ncisterns, and being fond of cream, had a habit of licking it from her\r\nfinger. She was seized in consequence with the symptoms of lead colic,\r\nafterwards with paralytic weakness of the hands, and she died of general\r\nexhaustion.[1262] The circumstances under which the lead is acted on\r\nhave not been carefully examined. It appears to be sometimes used with\r\nsafety. It will of course be dissolved, if the milk should become sour.\r\n\r\nRum has been also supposed to be sometimes adulterated with lead by\r\nbeing left in contact with the metal. The dry belly-ache of the West\r\nIndies, which appears to be the same disease with the lead colic, has\r\nbeen ascribed by some to the same cause. But on this subject precise\r\ninformation is still wanted. Dr. J. Hunter has stated, that an epidemic\r\ncolic, which attacked three of our regiments in Jamaica during the years\r\n1781 and 1782, and which seized almost every man of them, was traced by\r\nhim to the presence of lead in the rum; and he endeavours to show that\r\nthe spirit might dissolve the lead in passing through the leaden worms\r\nof the distilling apparatus.[1263] He adds in another work, that,\r\naccording to information communicated by Dr. Franklin, the legislature\r\nof Massachusetts passed an act in 1723, prohibiting the use of leaden\r\nstill-heads and worms in the distillation of spirituous liquors.[1264]\r\nIt is certain that rum has been often impregnated with lead; but it is\r\nby no means clear that Dr. Hunter has successfully accounted for the\r\nmode in which the adulteration is effected.\r\n\r\nWine has been accidentally impregnated in like manner, in consequence of\r\nthe bottles having been rinsed with shot, and some of the shot left\r\nbehind. An interesting example of this has been related in the\r\nPhilosophical Magazine. Severe abdominal symptoms were caused by a\r\nbottle of wine; and the cause was discovered to be the action of the\r\nwine on some shot in the bottom of the bottle. The shot had been so\r\ncompletely dissolved, that it crumbled when squeezed between the\r\nfingers.[1265] The illness in this instance must have been owing to the\r\narsenic contained in the shot, because the quantity of lead was hardly\r\nsufficient to excite violent symptoms.—At one time home-made British\r\nwines must have been frequently adulterated with lead, from the makers\r\nbeing ignorant of the dangerous nature of the adulteration. Sir G. Baker\r\nquotes the following receipt in a popular cookery book of his time: “_To\r\nhinder wine from turning._—Put a pound of melted lead in fair water into\r\nyour cask, pretty warm, and stop it close.”[1266]\r\n\r\nBut by far the most remarkable adulteration of the kind now under review\r\nis that of cider. At one time a disease in every respect the same as the\r\nlead colic used to prevail in some of the south-west counties of England\r\nat the cider season; and it was generally ascribed, in consequence\r\napparently of the opinion of Huxham, to the working people indulging too\r\nfreely in their favourite beverage during the season of plenty. The\r\nsubject, however, was carefully investigated in 1767 by Sir George\r\nBaker, who succeeded in proving, that the disease arose from the cider\r\nbeing impregnated with lead, sometimes designedly for the purpose of\r\ncorrecting its acescency when spoiled, but chiefly by accident, in\r\nconsequence of the metal being used for various purposes in the\r\nconstruction of the cider-house apparatus. The substance of his\r\nresearches is,—that a disease in all respects the same with the lead\r\ncolic was in his time so prevalent in Devonshire as to have supplied 289\r\ncases to the Exeter Hospital in five years, and 80 to the Bath Infirmary\r\nin a single season (1766); while, on the contrary, it was little, if at\r\nall, known in the adjoining counties of Gloucester, Worcester, and\r\nHereford, although cider is there an equally common drink among all\r\nranks:—that in the latter counties lead was seldom or never used in\r\nconstructing the apparatus of the cider-houses, while in Devonshire it\r\nwas used sometimes for lining the presses, but more commonly for\r\nfastening the iron cramps, and filling up the stone joinings of the\r\ngrinding troughs, and for conveying the liquor from vessel to\r\nvessel:—that lead did not exist in the cider of Herefordshire, but might\r\nbe detected both in the ripe cider, and more especially in the must, of\r\nDevonshire:—that from eighteen bottles of cider, a year in bottle, 4½\r\ngrains of metallic lead were procured.[1267] The accuracy of these\r\nfacts, and the soundness of the conclusions which Sir George Baker drew\r\nfrom them have been universally admitted; and lead is now, I believe,\r\ncompletely excluded from the cider apparatus.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the notoriety of these facts, accidents from adulterated\r\ncider seem still to occur occasionally in France. So recently as 1841 a\r\nset of cases which presented the incipient symptoms of lead colic were\r\ntraced by MM. Chevallier and Ollivier to cider having been adulterated\r\nwith lead to the amount of nearly two grains and a half per quart, in\r\nconsequence of a publican having kept his cider for two days in a vessel\r\nlined with lead.[1268]\r\n\r\nIf lead is previously oxidated, the presence of vegetable acids in\r\narticles kept in contact with it is still more likely to give rise to a\r\npoisonous impregnation, than in the case of lead itself.\r\n\r\nOf accidental adulterations of this kind the most important is that\r\nwhich arises from the action of vegetable acids on the glazing of\r\nearthenware. This glaze is well known to contain generally a\r\nconsiderable quantity of oxide of lead, and in consequence is more or\r\nless easily dissolved by vegetable acids. A good example has been\r\nnoticed by Dr. Beck.[1269] A family in Massachusetts, consisting of\r\neight persons, were all seized with spasmodic colic, obstinate\r\ncostiveness, and vomiting; and the disease was satisfactorily traced to\r\na store of stewed apples, which had been kept some months in an\r\nearthenware vessel and had corroded the lead glazing. Another\r\ninteresting example has been described by Dr. Hohnbaum of\r\nHildburghausen. A family of five persons were all violently affected for\r\na long time with spasmodic colic, and some with partial palsy. After\r\nexamining many articles of food, Dr. Hohnbaum at last found that the\r\nvinegar for dressing their salads was kept in a large earthenware vessel\r\ncapable of holding eight or ten quarts, and glazed with lead; that an\r\nounce of vinegar remaining in the vessel contained no less than nine\r\ngrains of lead; and that the whole glazing of the vessel was completely\r\ndissolved.[1270] Accidents like this appear from the statements of the\r\nsame author to have been common in Germany not long ago. Luzuriaga\r\nattributes the great prevalence of colic in Madrid and the neighbourhood\r\nto the general use in the kitchen of earthenware glazed with lead.[1271]\r\nJacob imputes it to the same cause.[1272] But others have doubted the\r\naccuracy of this explanation.\r\n\r\nThe effect of acids on lead glazing appears to be variable. Sometimes\r\nthey hardly act on it at all.[1273] The difference probably depends on\r\ndifferences in the composition of the glaze. Gmelin says, that if there\r\nis little oxide of lead present, acids and fat do not corrode it; but\r\nthat potters often use too much, to render the glaze more fusible; and\r\nthat then it is easily corroded.[1274] Westrumb states, that, if the\r\nlead glaze is thoroughly vitrified and not cracked, the strongest acids\r\ndo not attack it.[1275] Farther experiments are still required to\r\nelucidate this subject.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, by accident only that the food or drink of man is\r\nsubject to be poisoned with lead. Many articles are adulterated with it\r\ndesignedly for a variety of purposes. These adulterations it is\r\nnecessary for the medical jurist to study.\r\n\r\nNo kind of adulteration with lead is more common than that of wine;\r\nwhich, when too acid and harsh from the first, or rendered acescent by\r\ndecay, may be materially improved in taste by the addition of litharge.\r\n\r\nThe practice of correcting unsound wines in this way seems to have been\r\nwell known at an early period. Betwixt the years 1498 and 1577, various\r\ndecrees were passed against it by the German emperors; and in some\r\nprovinces the crime was even punished capitally.[1276] For some time\r\nafterwards the dangerous effects of the practice appear to have been\r\nlost sight of in Germany. But towards the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, the attention of physicians and legislators in that country was\r\npointedly directed to the subject by various writers in the _Acta\r\nGermanica_.[1277] The same practice has been long prevalent in France.\r\nThe famous endemic colic of Poitou, which appeared in 1572, and raged\r\nfor sixty or seventy years, has been with justice ascribed in modern\r\ntimes to the adulteration of wine with lead, and has given to the lead\r\ncolic its scientific name of _colica pictonum_. More recently, the\r\npractice became exceedingly prevalent in Paris. About the year 1750, the\r\nfarmers-general found that for some years before that, 30,000 hogsheads\r\nof sour wine were annually brought into Paris for the alleged purpose of\r\nmaking vinegar, while the previous yearly imports did not exceed 1200.\r\nAn inquiry was accordingly set on foot; which led to the discovery, that\r\nthe vinegar merchants corrected the sour wines with litharge, and thus\r\nmade them marketable.[1278] Notwithstanding the active system of medical\r\npolice in the French capital, the crime is not yet eradicated. Indeed\r\nthe small tart wines used so abundantly there by all ranks, hold out\r\ngreat encouragement and facilities to its perpetration.\r\n\r\nThe process employed for correcting the acescency of wine is not\r\nprecisely known. Some wines are easily corrected; Mérat found that a\r\nbottle of harsh wine, which had a sharp, bitterish, rather acrid taste,\r\ntook up in forty-eight hours twelve grains of litharge, and became\r\npalatable.[1279] With other wines this simple method will not answer,\r\nbecause the colour is destroyed, and a taste is substituted which has no\r\nresemblance to that of the genuine wine. Thus Orfila remarked, that\r\nBurgundy, neutralized with litharge, acquired a saccharine taste and\r\nbecame pale-red, because the insoluble salts of lead which were formed,\r\ncombined with and removed the colouring matter.[1280] On the whole, it\r\nis probable that the adulteration of wine with lead can only be\r\npractised with success on the common tart kinds, such as those used by\r\nthe lower orders on the continent.\r\n\r\nSome excellent observations have been published on this subject by\r\nFourcroy. In order to render what he has said intelligible, it is\r\nnecessary to premise, that in the course of the fermentation of wine,\r\nthe bitartrate of potass, which accelerates the conversion of the sugar\r\nof the fruit into alcohol, is itself partly converted into malic acid;\r\nthat in sound wine, therefore, there is a mixture of tartaric and malic\r\nacids; but that if the malic acid originally existed in the fruit in too\r\ngreat abundance, the fermentation of the sugar is imperfect, and the\r\nwine is consequently both too acid and too weak; and lastly, that all\r\nwines, if neglected, are apt to ferment too much, in consequence of\r\nwhich they pass the vinous stage of fermentation, and become impregnated\r\nwith acetic acid.[1281]\r\n\r\nNow Fourcroy found that the oxide and other preparations of lead correct\r\nacescency and harshness in wines, not so much by throwing down the\r\nacids, as by combining with them in solution, and imparting to the\r\nliquor the peculiar sweetness of lead. Hence tart wines, which owe their\r\nacidity to too great a proportion of tartaric acid or bitartrate of\r\npotass, cannot be improved by adulteration with oxide of lead. For the\r\nbitartrate of potass cannot act at all as a solvent on the oxides or\r\ncarbonate of lead, and even pure tartaric acid takes up so little, that\r\nwine containing it, could not acquire the sweet taste which is the\r\npurpose of the adulteration. This statement I have confirmed. But the\r\ncase is very different when the wine contains acetic acid, the presence\r\nof which is the general cause of spoiling or acidity. For Fourcroy\r\nremarked, that acetic acid dissolves not only oxide and carbonate of\r\nlead, but likewise the tartrate, notwithstanding its great insolubility\r\nin water or in its own acid. Hence the presence of tartaric acid in a\r\nwine spoiled by co-existence of the acetic, will not prevent the liquor\r\nfrom taking up oxide of lead in sufficient quantity to acquire an\r\nimproved taste and flavour. Nay, an obvious mode of correcting excessive\r\nacidity, produced by too much tartaric acid, is to add tartaric acid,\r\nand then to treat the mixture with oxide of lead. Fourcroy farther\r\nthinks, that the malic acid possesses the same solvent power as the\r\nacetic over tartrate of lead, and that its presence may therefore be the\r\nreason why some tart wines, which do not contain the acetic acid, become\r\nnevertheless impregnated with the poison. The solvent power of acetic\r\nacid is increased by the presence of other vegetable principles in the\r\nwine.[1282] I may add, that I have found the citric acid to possess the\r\nsame property with the acetic and malic acids. It dissolves so much of\r\nthe tartrate of lead as to acquire a pleasant sweetness, unmixed with\r\nmetallic astringency.\r\n\r\nThe practice of adulterating wine with lead does not seem to have been\r\never pursued to any material extent in Britain. Home-made wines may be\r\nadulterated in this way, as may be inferred from the receipt formerly\r\nquoted for preventing acescency. But I have never heard that any such\r\nadulteration has been suspected in the foreign wines usually drunk in\r\nthis country. Considering, indeed, the nature of these wines, and the\r\nclass of people who alone make use of them, it is not likely that\r\nadulteration with lead could be practised with success. If the foreign\r\nwines used in Britain should become acescent, lead could hardly restore\r\ntheir taste so thoroughly as to impose on the consumer.\r\n\r\nSometimes spirituous liquors and preserves have been adulterated with\r\nlead, in consequence of sugar of lead having been used to clarify them,\r\nor to render them colourless. Cadet de Gassicourt says it is a common\r\npractice in France to clarify honey and sugar of grapes, and to make\r\nbrandy pale in this way; and M. Boudet has detected lead in many samples\r\nof these articles in Paris.[1283] Hollands has likewise been poisoned in\r\nthe same manner. Dr. Shearman mentions his having detected an extensive\r\nadulteration of smuggled Geneva by an excise officer, which had been\r\nsold and dispersed over an extensive tract of country, and which\r\ncommitted great ravages among the inhabitants.[1284]\r\n\r\nThe adulterations hitherto noticed take place through means of the\r\nchemical action of the adulterated articles on lead or its oxide. Some\r\nother substances are occasionally contaminated by its compounds being\r\nmerely mechanically mixed with them. There is no end to the number and\r\nvariety of adulterations of this kind. But the following will serve as\r\nexamples. Gaubius once detected an adulteration of butter with white\r\nlead at a time when it was very scarce in Flanders, owing to a dreadful\r\nmortality among cattle.[1285] An instance of poisoning with lead, in\r\nconsequence of cheese having been mixed with red lead, is mentioned in\r\nthe Repertory of Arts.[1286] This variety deserves to be remembered. Red\r\nlead was at one time a good deal used to communicate the peculiar\r\nreddish-yellow colour, which is supposed to characterize the finer\r\nqualities of certain kinds of English cheese. In the Transactions of the\r\nMedical Society of London, a singular instance has been related by Mr.\r\nDeering, of lead colic attacking a whole family, and proving fatal to\r\ntwo of them, in consequence of the insidious introduction of white lead\r\ninto the body. Although the nature of the symptoms in the several cases\r\nleft no doubt that lead was the cause of them, it was long before the\r\nsource of the poison was discovered. Every vessel and article used in\r\nthe kitchen was in vain examined; when at length it was discovered that\r\nthe sugar used by the family had been taken from a barrel which had\r\nformerly contained white lead, and that, as the sugar from the centre of\r\nthe barrel had been dug out, and given away to various friends, the\r\nouter part of it next the white lead was chiefly used by the family\r\nthemselves.[1287]\r\n\r\n\r\n           _Process for detecting Lead in Organic Mixtures._\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a little nitric acid should be added to the\r\nsuspected matter before filtration; for nitric acid redissolves any\r\ninsoluble compound formed by the salts of lead with albumen and other\r\nanimal principles, as well as some of those formed with vegetable\r\nprinciples; and consequently renders it more probable, that the poison\r\nwill be detected in the first part of the analysis, if present at\r\nall.[1288] This being done, sulphuretted-hydrogen gas is to be\r\ntransmitted through the fluid part of the mixture; and if a\r\ndark-coloured precipitate is formed, the whole is to be boiled and\r\nfiltered to collect the precipitate.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain that the precipitate positively contains lead,\r\nthose who are accustomed to use the blowpipe may put the sulphuret into\r\na little hole in a bit of charcoal, and reduce it by the fine point of a\r\nblowpipe-flame; when a single globule is procured, which is easily\r\ndistinguished by its lustre and softness. A better process, for those\r\nnot accustomed to the blowpipe, and perhaps a better test of the\r\nexistence of lead in all circumstances, is to heat the sulphuret to\r\nredness in a tube, and to treat it with strong nitric acid, without heat\r\nor with the aid of a gentle heat only. The lead is thus dissolved\r\nwithout the sulphur being acted on. The solution is then to be diluted\r\nwith water, filtered, evaporated to dryness, and gently heated to expel\r\nthe excess of nitric acid. If the residue be dissolved in water, it will\r\npresent the usual characters of a lead solution when subjected to the\r\nproper liquid tests. Of these the hydriodate of potass is to be\r\npreferred when the quantity is too small for trying more of them. But\r\nfor this purpose care must be taken to expel all the excess of nitric\r\nacid, because an excess will strike a yellow colour with the test though\r\nlead be not present.\r\n\r\nIf the preceding process should not detect lead in the filtered part of\r\nthe mixed fluid, then the insoluble matter left on the filter is to be\r\nincinerated, and the residuum dissolved in nitric acid, and tested as\r\nabove. This branch, however, will be rarely required, if lead be\r\npresent, because the precaution of adding nitric acid, previous to\r\nfiltration, dissolves the lead from most of its compounds which are\r\ninsoluble in water. The process of incineration in medico-legal analysis\r\ngenerally should be avoided if possible, as it is not easily managed by\r\nunpractised persons.—The present branch of the process of analysis will\r\nbe particularly required for the contents of the stomach or vomited\r\nmatter, when any sulphate or phosphate has been given as an antidote.\r\n\r\nA process different from the preceding, and analogous to those for\r\ndetecting copper and antimony in complex organic mixtures, has lately\r\nbeen proposed by Professor Orfila, especially for those cases in which\r\nlead is to be sought for in the textures of the body, where death is\r\nsupposed to have been occasioned by it. The subject of analysis, such as\r\nthe liver, spleen, or kidneys, being cut into small pieces, and boiled\r\nin distilled water, and the filtered decoction being evaporated to\r\ndryness, the extract is to be carbonized with nitric acid as directed\r\nunder the head of copper (p. 357); and care must be taken that the heat\r\nbe not raised to redness, so as to inflame the mass. The residuum is\r\nthen to be boiled with nitric acid; the solution being evaporated to\r\ndryness to expel the excess of acid, the saline matter left is to be\r\nredissolved and acted on by hydrosulphuric acid gas; and the sulphuret\r\nthus formed may be recognized by the means mentioned above.[1289]\r\n\r\nA question has been recently started, whether all the processes for\r\ndetecting lead in the tissues of the human body are not rendered\r\nfallacious by the alleged existence of lead in the healthy animal\r\ntextures. In the first place, however, it is doubtful, as will be seen\r\npresently, whether lead ever exists naturally in the animal organs. But\r\nbesides, the fallacy, if a real one, is obviated by the process of\r\nOrfila; who states that lead, naturally combined in the animal tissues,\r\ncannot be indicated by his method, if the animal matter be charred by\r\nnitric acid without deflagration. And farther, in regard to the tissues\r\nof the stomach in cases of acute poisoning with the preparations of\r\nlead, it appears that in most instances there may be seen on the villous\r\ncoat little white points, which are blackened by hydrosulphuric acid, a\r\nphenomenon never occasioned by lead naturally contained in the substance\r\nof the membrane. [See p. 439.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—_Of the Action of Lead and the Symptoms it excites in Man._\r\n\r\nThe effects of the preparations of lead on the body are very striking.\r\nThey differ according to the rapidity with which it enters the system.\r\nLarge doses of its soluble salts cause symptoms of irritant poisoning.\r\nThe gradual introduction of any of its oxidated preparations in minute\r\nquantities brings on a peculiar and now well-known variety of colic,\r\nwhich is often followed by partial palsy, and in violent cases by\r\napoplexy.\r\n\r\nThe physiological effects and mode of action of the soluble salts in\r\nirritating doses have been examined experimentally by Professor Orfila,\r\nM. Gaspard, Dr. Schloepfer, and Dr. Campbell. Their experiments agree in\r\nshowing that these poisons have a direct irritating action, and a remote\r\noperation of an unknown kind; but the results obtained by different\r\nexperimentalists differ as to some of the details. The acetate may be\r\ntaken as a type of the whole genus.\r\n\r\nOrfila found that it was hardly possible to bring dogs under the action\r\nof the acetate if swallowed in solution, because they speedily\r\ndischarged it all by vomiting. But if the salt was given in powder in\r\nthe dose of half an ounce, or if the solution was retained in the\r\nstomach by a ligature on the gullet, the symptoms produced were those of\r\nviolent irritation in the first instance, succeeded by extreme weakness\r\nand death, sometimes in nine hours, more generally not till the second\r\nday or later. The appearances in the body were unnatural whiteness of\r\nthe villous coat when death was rapid, and vascular redness when death\r\nwas slower. The whiteness in the former case Orfila ascribes to chemical\r\naction. But as neither this appearance nor the redness in the latter\r\ncase was considerable, while at the same time the symptoms were not\r\nthose of continuous irritation, he was led to doubt whether the poison\r\ncauses death in consequence of its irritant properties. And the\r\nphenomena observed by him when acetate of lead was injected into the\r\njugular vein prove that death is owing to certain remote effects.\r\nIntroduced through this channel thirteen grains killed a dog almost\r\nimmediately, death being preceded by no other symptom except convulsive\r\nrespiration; five grains killed another in five days, and the leading\r\nsymptoms were weariness, languor, staggering, and slight convulsions,\r\nnone of which symptoms appeared till the third day; and it is remarkable\r\nthat in neither animal could he find any morbid appearance on\r\ndissection.[1290] Mr. Blake states that large doses, such as a drachm,\r\nsuddenly arrest the heart’s action; but that small doses of three\r\ngrains, injected into the jugular vein, cause diminished action of that\r\norgan, and afterwards gorging and hepatization of the lungs; and that\r\nwhen injected backwards into the aorta from the axillary artery, this\r\nsalt occasions obstruction of the capillary circulation, indicated by\r\nincreased arterial pressure,—and then an action on the nervous system,\r\nproducing insensibility, violent movements of the tail, and at last\r\narrestment of the respiration. It may be inferred from Mr. Blake’s\r\nresearches that lead obstructs both the systemic and pulmonary\r\ncapillaries, that it acts powerfully on the nervous centre, and that it\r\nlikewise depresses the heart’s action when the dose is large.[1291]\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Gaspard coincide with those of Orfila in assigning\r\nconsiderable activity to the acetate of lead when it is directly\r\nintroduced into the blood,—the quantity of two or four grains generally\r\ncausing death in three or five days.[1292] The experiments of Campbell\r\nfarther show that death may be induced by applying it to a wound, and\r\nthat the symptoms antecedent to death resemble those remarked by Orfila\r\nwhen it is injected into a vein.[1293] But the two last experimentalists\r\ndiffer from Orfila in assigning to sugar of lead a property like that\r\npossessed by arsenic, of acting on the alimentary canal, even when\r\napplied to a wound, or directly introduced into the blood. For Campbell\r\nfound the stomach corrugated and red, and the small intestines also\r\nvascular; while Gaspard not only observed analogous appearances after\r\ndeath, but even also witnessed all the symptoms of violent dysentery\r\nduring life. In farther proof of the local irritating power of this\r\npoison, it may be added, that when sugar of lead was injected into the\r\nrectum Campbell found it to cause purging, tenesmus, itching of the\r\nanus, and great debility.\r\n\r\nI have found that the nitrate of lead is powerfully irritant and\r\ncorrosive in the dose of 400 grains. This quantity dissolved in four\r\nounces of water killed a strong dog in sixteen hours, producing violent\r\nefforts to vomit and diarrhœa. And after death the whole inner membrane\r\nof the gullet and stomach, and the villi of the upper half of the small\r\nintestines, were uniformly white, brittle, and evidently disintegrated;\r\nand the mucous coat of the great intestines was bright red in parallel\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThe only inquiries I have hitherto met with, which assign to lead in\r\ncontinued small doses the power of producing in animals the peculiar\r\ncolic and palsy often produced by it in man are those of Schloepfer,\r\nrelated in his thesis on the effects of poisons when injected into the\r\nwindpipe. He found that the acetate, introduced through this channel in\r\nsuccessive doses of ten grains, brought on all the symptoms of _colica\r\npictonum_, preceded by oppressed breathing, and ending fatally with\r\npalsy and convulsions in the course of three weeks.[1294] More recently\r\nDr. Wibmer, in the course of some experiments on the long-continued use\r\nof acetate and carbonate of lead, remarked weakness and stiffness of the\r\nlimbs in dogs; and in the rabbit I have observed in the like\r\ncircumstances gradually increasing weakness, ending in complete palsy of\r\nthe fore-legs.\r\n\r\nThe compounds of lead seem to produce their effects on the animal body\r\nthrough the medium of absorption. At all events they are absorbed in the\r\ncourse of their action, and are diffused throughout the animal textures.\r\nLead was long sought for with variable and dubious success in the fluids\r\nand solids of men and animals killed by it or labouring under its\r\neffects. But the late improvements in physiological science and chemical\r\nanalysis have demonstrated, that it may always be detected in favourable\r\ncircumstances in the liver and kidneys, often in the spleen and in the\r\nurine, and sometimes even in the muscles. Wibmer was the first who\r\nsatisfactorily proved its presence. In dogs poisoned slowly by the\r\nacetate or carbonate of lead in frequent small doses, and dying with\r\nsymptoms of lead-colic and palsy, he found the metal distinctly in the\r\nliver, muscles, and spinal cord, and more obscurely in the blood, by\r\ndrying and deflagrating the animal matter with nitre, acting on the\r\nresidue with nitric acid, neutralizing the solution, and testing it with\r\nhydrosulphuric acid, carbonate of potash, and iodide of potassium.[1295]\r\nOn repeating these experiments, I succeeded in detecting lead in very\r\nminute quantity in the lumbar and dorsal muscles of rabbits, but not any\r\nwhere else.[1296] Professor Orfila has since frequently found lead, by\r\nmeans of his method of analysis described at page 424, in the kidneys,\r\nliver, and urine of animals which had taken large doses of acetate of\r\nlead, and once in the urine of a girl who had swallowed above an ounce\r\nof the acetate twenty-five hours before the urine was passed.[1297]\r\nAbout the same time M. Ausset, under the directions of Lassaigne,\r\ndetected lead largely in the blood and urine of a horse during life, and\r\nin the liver and kidneys after death.[1298] Mr. Alfred Taylor found\r\ntraces of it in the milk of a cow accidentally poisoned by carbonate of\r\nlead.[1299] M. Tanquerel Desplanches says it has been detected by M.\r\nDevergie and himself in the palsied parts of persons who had died of\r\ncolica pictonum;[1300] and Dr. Budd observes, that Mr. Miller found lead\r\nin abundance in the paralysed extensors of the hand in a man who died in\r\na London Hospital of the epileptic form of the effects of this\r\npoison.[1301]\r\n\r\nThese facts seem to outweigh the negative results obtained by others.\r\nNor are they invalidated by the alleged existence of lead in the healthy\r\nanimal textures. For in the first place,—although M. Devergie says he\r\nhas always found traces of lead in the substance of the stomach and\r\nintestines of men and women, who had not used preparations of lead or\r\nbeen in any way exposed to it,[1302] and Professor Orfila confirmed\r\nthese observations by also finding traces of lead in the alimentary\r\ncanal under similar circumstances,[1303]—the conclusion flowing from\r\ntheir researches is after all doubtful; for in a later inquiry MM.\r\nDanger and Flandin could not find any lead, unless it had been purposely\r\nintroduced into the body.[1304] And secondly,—Devergie adds to his\r\nremarks, that the quantity of lead he found in the textures and\r\nsecretions of those who had died of lead-colic was far greater than in\r\nthose who had not been exposed to lead preparations before death; and\r\nOrfila ascertained that the process by which he detects adventitious\r\nlead is incapable of indicating that which may be present naturally in\r\nthe body.[1305]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that all the preparations of lead are poisonous except\r\nthe metal, and perhaps also the sulphuret. The experimentalists at the\r\nVeterinary School of Lyons found that nearly four ounces of the metal\r\nmight be given to a dog without even vomiting being excited; and Orfila\r\nremarked that an ounce of carefully prepared sulphuret had as little\r\neffect.[1306] The effects, which have been occasionally ascribed to\r\nlead-shot, and which will be mentioned by and by [_see_ p. 435], seem at\r\nvariance with these experiments, but cannot outweigh such precise\r\nnegative results. It is probable that irritant poisoning can be produced\r\nonly by those compounds which are soluble, such as the acetate,\r\nsubacetate, and nitrate. It appears indeed from the experiments of\r\nOrfila with the acetate and my own with the nitrate, that these\r\ncompounds are true corrosives, and of no mean energy when given in large\r\ndoses moderately diluted.\r\n\r\nThe insoluble compounds, such as the carbonate, red oxide and protoxide,\r\npossess little irritant power. The experimentalists of Lyons found\r\nlitharge to be irritant in large doses of half an ounce.[1307] Orfila\r\ngave dogs large doses of the red oxide and carbonate without observing\r\nany signs of irritation in the stomach. A case has been published of a\r\nyoung woman who swallowed accidentally an ounce and a half of the\r\ncarbonate without any bad effect whatever either at the time or\r\nafterwards;[1308] and Dr. Ogston of Aberdeen has informed me he met with\r\na similar case, that of a girl who took an ounce with the view of\r\ndestroying herself, but without sustaining any harm whatever. In a\r\nremarkable case, published by Mr. Cross of London, in which six drachms\r\nwere taken accidentally by a pregnant female instead of magnesia,\r\nvomiting and violent colic were produced, and afterwards fainting,\r\nparalysis of the extensor muscles, and contraction of the flexors; all\r\nof which symptoms, however, after enduring without abatement till eight\r\nhours after the poison was swallowed, gradually disappeared under\r\nantidotes and laxatives. But such a case bears no great resemblance\r\neither to the acute or chronic form of poisoning with lead, and was\r\nprobably hysterical.[1309] Orfila has found that an ounce and a quarter\r\nof sulphate of lead had no effect whatever on a dog.[1310] Mr. Taylor\r\nmentions a case where the chloride of lead caused vomiting, but no other\r\nill consequence.[1311] Dr. Cogswell found that three drachms of iodide\r\nof lead caused in a dog merely depression and weakness for a few days;\r\nbut forty grains killed a rabbit in twelve days, with symptoms of\r\nexhaustion and constipation; and doses frequently repeated, to the\r\namount of eleven drachms in eighteen days, killed a dog under symptoms\r\nnearly the same.[1312]\r\n\r\nIt may be presumed that all the compounds of lead which are soluble in\r\nwater or in the animal fluids may produce in favourable circumstances\r\nthe lead colic and palsy. Dr. A. T. Thomson, indeed,[1313] has\r\nendeavoured to show by some experiments, that the carbonate is the only\r\ncompound of lead which possesses this singular power; and that if the\r\nacetate of lead produces similar effects, it is only because that salt\r\nusually contains an excess of oxide which becomes carbonate from the\r\naction of free carbonic acid in the stomach and other parts of animals,\r\nor because the salt is decomposed by double decomposition from the\r\naccidental presence of alkaline carbonates. It does not appear to me,\r\nhowever, that the researches of Dr. Thomson, taken along with the prior\r\ninquiries of other physiologists, will bear out this conclusion. The\r\nexperiments of Wibmer in particular would seem to show that the\r\ncarbonate is at least not more active than the acetate; nor does it\r\nappear probable that the small doses of acetate given by him, seldom\r\nexceeding two or three grains at a time, could yield any carbonate in\r\nthe alimentary canal of a dog, where there is commonly much free\r\nmuriatic acid. Farther, in many of the instances of lead colic related\r\nabove as produced by cider, wine, and other acid substances acting on\r\nlead or its oxide, the acid must have been so greatly in excess, that it\r\nwas scarcely possible that carbonate of lead could have been formed\r\nafterwards by any ordinary accident. And even supposing the carbonate to\r\nbe more active than other compounds in occasioning colic and palsy, as\r\nDr. Thomson’s inquiries would tend to show, the fact may be admitted\r\nwithout necessarily leading to the inference, that it is the only active\r\ncompound of lead, or that other preparations must be converted into the\r\ncarbonate before they can act as slow poisons. For the superior activity\r\nof the carbonate may be owing to the great obstinacy with which its\r\nimpalpable powder adheres to moist membranous surfaces, and the\r\nconsequent greater certainty of its ultimate absorption. It certainly\r\nappears at least but consistent with a general law, to which hitherto no\r\nundoubted exception has been found, that the carbonate must be dissolved\r\nbefore it can act constitutionally.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms observed in man from the preparations of lead are of three\r\nkinds. One class of symptoms indicate inflammation of the alimentary\r\ncanal: another spasm of its muscles: and a third injury of the nervous\r\nsystem, sometimes apoplexy, more commonly palsy, and that almost always\r\npartial and incomplete. Each of these classes of symptoms may exist\r\nindependently of the other two; but the last two are more commonly\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\nThe irritant effects of large doses of the soluble salts of lead come\r\nfirst under consideration. Of these the acetate, or sugar of lead may be\r\ntaken as an example.\r\n\r\nHere it will, in the first instance, be observed that, according to the\r\nexperiments mentioned above, the acetate of lead, though certainly an\r\nirritant poison, is not very energetic,—being much less so than the\r\nvulgar generally believe, and far inferior to most of the metallic\r\npoisons hitherto treated of. This farther appears from the experience of\r\nphysicians as to its effects in medicinal doses. The acetate has been\r\noften given in pretty large doses in medical practice; and although it\r\nhas sometimes excited colic when continued too long, ordinary irritation\r\nof the stomach seems to have been rarely observed. Mr. Daniell, in a\r\npaper on its effects as a remedy for mercurial salivation, states that\r\nhe gave it in doses of ten grains three times a day, and that he never\r\nobserved it to excite any other unpleasant symptom except slight colic,\r\nwhich seldom came on till after the fourth dose.[1314] I have often\r\ngiven it in divided doses to the amount of eighteen grains daily for\r\neight or ten days, without remarking any unpleasant symptom whatever,\r\nexcept once or twice slight colic. Van Swieten even mentions a case in\r\nwhich it was given to the amount of a drachm daily for ten days before\r\nit caused any material symptom.[1315]\r\n\r\nYet facts are not wanting to prove that acetate of lead in an improper\r\ndose will produce violent and immediate effects. The symptoms are then\r\neither those of simple irritation, or more commonly those of\r\ninflammation united with the peculiar spasmodic colic of lead, and\r\nsometimes followed by convulsions and coma, or by local palsy.\r\n\r\nIn one of Sir George Baker’s essays there is an instance of immediate\r\nand violent symptoms having been caused by a drachm taken twice with a\r\nshort interval between the doses. The subject was a soldier who took it\r\nin milk to cure a diarrhœa. Five hours after the first dose he was\r\nseized with pain in the bowels and a feeling of distension round the\r\nnavel. After the second these symptoms became much more acute; and he\r\nwas soon after seized with bilious vomiting, loss of speech, delirium,\r\nand profuse sweating, while the pulse fell down to 40. He recovered,\r\nhowever, with the aid of diluents and cathartics.[1316]\r\n\r\nA case which proved rapidly fatal has been related in a French journal.\r\nA drummer in a French regiment, who was much given to drinking, stole\r\nsome Goulard’s extract, and drank it for wine. Neither the first\r\nsymptoms nor the dose could be ascertained. On the second day he was\r\naffected with loss of appetite, paleness, costiveness, and excessive\r\ndebility; on the third day he had severe and excessive colic, drawing in\r\nof the belly, loss of voice, cold sweats, locked jaw, and violent\r\nconvulsions; and he expired before the evening of the same day. The\r\nmorbid appearances will be mentioned in their proper place. Sugar of\r\nlead was detected in the stomach.[1317]\r\n\r\nIn both these instances the disorder excited partook very much of the\r\ncharacter of the spasmodic colic which is caused by the gradual\r\nintroduction of lead into the body; and in the last the whole course of\r\nthe man’s illness was very like that of the worst or most acute form of\r\n_colica pictonum_. But in another example which came under my own\r\nnotice, the symptoms were more nearly those of ordinary\r\nirritation,—namely, vomiting, burning, and pricking pain in the throat,\r\ngullet, and stomach, with trifling colic subsequently; but the patient\r\nrecovered in two or three days. The quantity taken was supposed to\r\nexceed a quarter of an ounce. So, too, in a case which occurred to M.\r\nVilleneuve of Paris, the symptoms were chiefly vomiting and purging,\r\nwith faintness and some convulsions. His patient swallowed intentionally\r\nabove an ounce of acetate of lead in solution. Sulphate of soda and\r\nsulphate of magnesia were given promptly as antidotes; in an hour the\r\nsymptoms had abated materially; and next day she was well.[1318] This\r\nwas the case in which Orfila found lead in the urine. Of the same\r\nnature, also, are two cases briefly alluded to by Mr. Taylor, as having\r\nbeen caused in London in 1840 by Goulard’s extract. The subjects, who\r\nwere children, were seized with vomiting, purging, and other symptoms\r\nlike those of Asiatic cholera; and both died within thirty-six\r\nhours.[1319]\r\n\r\nIn another instance, related by Mr. Iliff of London, where an ounce of\r\nthe acetate was accidentally swallowed in solution, the symptoms were at\r\nfirst colic pains and vomiting, in the course of a few hours vomiting\r\nand tenderness, and, after these symptoms receded, a peculiar state of\r\nrigidity and numbness, which was not entirely removed for several days.\r\nIn this case no remedies were used for three hours; and even two hours\r\nlater, when the stomach-pump was resorted to on account of the\r\nslightness of the vomiting, lead was found in the first fluid\r\nwithdrawn,—a new proof of the feeble action of acetate of lead, compared\r\nwith some other metallic poisons.[1320]\r\n\r\nSo much for the operation of the acetate of lead in large doses.\r\nPhysicians, however, are much better acquainted with the effects of lead\r\nwhen introduced in the body continuously and insidiously in minute\r\nquantities. For all tradesmen who work much with its preparations are\r\napt to suffer in this way, and many other persons have been brought\r\nunder its action in consequence of articles of food and drink being\r\nimpregnated with it. The disease which is thus induced may be divided\r\ninto two distinct stages.\r\n\r\nThe first stage is an affection of the alimentary canal, the leading\r\nfeature of which is violent and obstinate colic. This symptom at times\r\nbegins abruptly during a state of sound health; but much more commonly\r\nit is ushered in by a deranged state of the stomach, not unlike common\r\ndyspepsia, seldom so severe as to excite alarm, and commonly imputed at\r\nfirst to a wrong cause. There is general uneasiness and depression, a\r\ndingy yellowish complexion, weakness and numbness in the limbs, a\r\nsweetish styptic taste and fetid breath, a slaty tint of the teeth and\r\ngums, with a blue line along the margin of the gums where they touch the\r\nteeth, a slow hard pulse, great emaciation, loss of appetite and\r\ntendency to indigestion. This state, which was first well characterized\r\nby Mr. Wilson[1321] of Leadhills, and has lately been more fully\r\ndescribed by M. Tanquerel,[1322] is of great moment as apprizing the\r\nworkman of the necessity of taking active measures for preventing the\r\nmore formidable effects, which otherwise are sure to follow. Of the\r\nwarning symptoms none is so invariable or so characteristic as the blue\r\nline along the edge of the gums, an appearance which was first noticed\r\nby Dr. Burton of St. George’s, London,[1323] and has been since observed\r\nin every case of lead colic, whether impending or present.—If alarm be\r\nnot taken in time, the obscure complaints hitherto mentioned become\r\nattended by and by with uneasy sensations in the stomach, stretching ere\r\nlong throughout the whole belly. At the same time the stomach becomes\r\nirritable, and the food is rejected by vomiting. Cramps in the pit of\r\nthe stomach then arise, and extend to the rest of the belly, till at\r\nlength the complete colic paroxysm is formed. The pain is sometimes\r\npretty constant; sometimes it ceases at intervals altogether; but much\r\nmore commonly there are remissions rather than intermissions; and it is\r\nremarked that both the remissions and exacerbations are much longer than\r\nthose of common colic. The pain is very generally, yet not invariably,\r\nrelieved by pressure; even strong pressure seldom causes any uneasiness,\r\nprovided it be not made on the epigastrium; nay, some patients have been\r\nknown to bear, with relief to the paroxysms, the weight of two or three\r\npeople standing on the belly.[1324] The belly is almost always hard, the\r\nabdominal muscles being contracted: sometimes it is rather full, more\r\ncommonly the reverse, and the navel is often drawn in so as almost to\r\ntouch the spine. The bowels all the while are obstinately costive.\r\nEither there is no discharge from them at all; or scanty, knotty fæces\r\nare passed with much straining and pain. This state, long supposed to\r\ndepend on spasm, is now known to arise on the contrary from paralysis,\r\nof the intestinal muscular coat. In a few instances diarrhœa takes the\r\nplace of the opposite affection. The urine is commonly diminished. The\r\nsaliva has been described as greater than natural in quantity and bluish\r\nin colour; but Dr. Burton says he did not observe a single instance of\r\nthis in forty cases which he carefully examined. From the beginning, or\r\nmore generally after a few hours or days, the limbs are racked with\r\ndiffuse cutting pains; which, according to Tanquerel, affect chiefly the\r\nlimbs, especially near the joints, are worst at night, are often\r\nattended with cramps, and are relieved by pressure. The aspect of the\r\ncountenance is dull, anxious, and gloomy: in advanced cases the\r\nexpression of gloomy anxiety exceeds that of almost all other diseases.\r\nIt appears from the latest works on this disease published in France,\r\nand particularly from the able treatise of Mérat, that the pulse is\r\nrarely accelerated, but on the contrary often retarded.[1325] This does\r\nnot accord with the experience of some earlier writers;[1326] and in the\r\nfew cases I have seen in this city the pulse has been always frequent.\r\nIt cannot be questioned, however, that, as Mérat states, fever is not\r\nessential. The skin has a dull, dirty, cadaverous appearance, is often,\r\nthough not always hot, and in either case is bedewed with irregular,\r\nclammy, cold perspiration.\r\n\r\nThis, the first stage of colica pictonum, may end in three ways. In the\r\nfirst place, the patient may recover at once from it as from an ordinary\r\ncolic; and it is consolatory to know, that a first attack, taken under\r\ntimely management, is for the most part easily made to terminate in that\r\nfavourable manner. In such circumstances it rarely endures beyond eight\r\ndays. But it is exceedingly apt to recur, if, for example, the patient\r\nexpose himself to what in ordinary circumstances would cause merely a\r\ncommon colic or diarrhœa; and if he returns to a trade which exposes him\r\nagain to the poison of lead, the disease is sure to recur sooner or\r\nlater, and repeatedly, unless he observes the greatest precautions. In\r\none or other of these returns, sometimes even in the first attack, the\r\ncolic is not succeeded by complete recovery, but gives place to another\r\nmore obstinate and more alarming disease. This secondary affection is of\r\ntwo sorts. One, which occurs chiefly in fatal cases, is a species of\r\napoplexy. The other, which does not of itself prove fatal, is partial\r\npalsy.\r\n\r\nIn violent and neglected cases of colica pictonum, the colic becomes\r\nattended in a few days with giddiness, great debility, torpor, and\r\nsometimes delirium; as the torpor advances the pains in the belly and\r\nlimbs abate; at length the patient becomes convulsed and comatose, from\r\nwhich state very few recover. Tanquerel, who is unnecessarily minute in\r\nsubdividing the various affections produced by the poison of lead,\r\ndistinguishes four kinds of affections of the head, coma, epilepsy,\r\ndelirium, and a combination of all these.[1327] A very rare termination\r\nallied to that now described is sudden death during the colic stage,\r\nwithout any symptom which would lead one to suspect its approach. A case\r\nof this kind has been related by M. Louis. His patient, five minutes\r\nafter talking to the attendant of his ward, was found at his bedside in\r\nthe agony of death; and no cause for so sudden a death could be found on\r\ndissection.[1328] Somewhat similar was a case which occurred in 1838 at\r\nthe hospital of La Charité at Paris. A man labouring for three days\r\nseverely under the colic stage of the disease, began to breathe\r\nstertorously soon after straining at stool, and died in three\r\nhours.[1329] In a case which occurred to Dr. Elliotson death was owing\r\nto concomitant perforation of the stomach, a concurrence which was\r\nprobably accidental, but which was also once observed by Dr.\r\nCopland.[1330]\r\n\r\nIn cases, on the other hand, which have not been neglected, and\r\nparticularly when the attack is not the first, the departure of the\r\ncolic often leaves the patient in a state of extreme debility, which by\r\nand by is found to be a true partial palsy, more or less complete. This\r\naffection is sometimes present before the colic departs, but is apt to\r\nescape notice till the pain abates. Occasionally it supervenes on a\r\nsudden, but more generally it is preceded by a sense of weariness,\r\nnumbness and tremor of the parts. The palsy is of a peculiar kind. It\r\naffects chiefly the upper extremities, and is attended with excessive\r\nmuscular emaciation. The loss of power and substance is most remarkable\r\nin the muscles which supply the thumb and fingers; and in every case\r\nwhich I have seen the extensors suffered more than the flexors. The\r\nparalysis is hardly ever complete, except perhaps in the extensors of\r\nthe fingers. When it is considerable, the position of the hands is\r\nalmost characteristic of the disease. The hands are constantly bent,\r\nexcept when the arms hang straight down by the side; they dangle loosely\r\nwhen the patient moves; he cannot extend them, and raises one arm with\r\nthe aid of the other. The palsy is attended, according to Tanquerel,\r\nwith diminished heat in the parts, and feeble pulsation in the arteries\r\nwhich supply them. There is seldom any loss of sensation in the affected\r\nparts. But the paralysis sometimes affects the nerves of the other\r\nsenses. Thus two cases of paralysis of the nerves of vision have been\r\nrelated by Dr. Alderson of Hull;[1331] and Tanquerel says this affection\r\nis not uncommon in Paris, and is attended with dilated and immovable\r\npupils. The latter author also once met with deafness in the same\r\ncircumstances.—Patients affected with lead palsy usually complain of\r\nracking pains in the limbs and arms, digestion is feeble, and trivial\r\ncauses renew the colic. From this deplorable condition it is still\r\npossible to restore the sufferer to health, chiefly by rigorous\r\nattention to regimen. But he too often dies in consequence of a fresh\r\nattack of colic as soon as he returns to his fatal trade.\r\n\r\nThe lead palsy, however, does not always come on in this regular manner.\r\nSometimes the primary stage of colic is wanting, so that the wasting of\r\nthe muscles and loss of power are the first symptoms. I have seen a\r\ncharacteristic example of the kind in a sailor who had been employed for\r\na month in painting a vessel. He had great weakness and wasting of the\r\narms and hands, particularly of the ball of the thumb; but except a\r\ntendency to indigestion, costiveness, and transient slight pain of the\r\nbelly, he had suffered no previous disorder of the intestines. I have\r\nseen the paralytic affection confined to the extensors of one hand in a\r\ncompositor, and Dr. Chowne met with a similar affection of both hands in\r\na gas-fitter.[1332] Dr. Bright observed palsy without colic in the case\r\nof a painter three times in the course of seven years.[1333]—In like\r\nmanner, according to Tanquerel, the neuralgic affection may occur\r\nseverely without any precursory colic; and the same author has witnessed\r\nboth coma and convulsions in the same circumstances.\r\n\r\nColica pictonum, with the collateral disorders specified above, is the\r\nonly disease which has been distinctly traced to the operation of lead\r\ninsidiously introduced into the body. But many other disorders have been\r\nascribed to its agency. Boerhaave seems to have imagined that\r\nconsumption might be so induced; and Dr. Lambe thought that to this\r\ncause may be traced the increased prevalence of “scrofula, phthisis,\r\ndropsy, chronic rheumatism, stomach complaints, hypochondriasis, and the\r\nhost of nervous complaints which infest modern life.”[1334] These\r\nconjectures are wholly destitute of foundation in fact.\r\n\r\nIn whatever form lead is habitually applied to the body, it is apt to\r\nbring on the train of symptoms mentioned above;—the inhalation of its\r\nfumes, the habitual contact of any of its compounds with the skin, the\r\nprolonged use of them internally as medicines, or externally as unguents\r\nand lotions, and the accidental introduction of them for a length of\r\ntime with the food, may sooner or later equally induce colica pictonum.\r\n\r\nInstances have occurred of colic being produced by the prolonged\r\nemployment of the compounds of lead inwardly in medical practice. Such\r\ncases are so uncommon that it is evident some strong constitutional\r\ntendency must co-operate. But it is in vain to deny, as some do, that\r\nthe medicinal employment of preparations of lead internally is\r\nunattended with any risk whatever of slow poisoning. Dr. Billing of\r\nMulhausen relates a case of death, apparently from the comatose\r\naffection succeeding the colic stage of poisoning with lead, in the\r\ninstance of a boy of fifteen, to whom he gave acetate of lead in\r\ngradually increasing doses for six weeks, till he took two grains\r\ndaily.[1335] Tanquerel met with a case of colic produced by 130 grains\r\ntaken in fourteen days, and another occasioned by 149 grains in sixteen\r\ndays.[1336] Sir George Baker has mentioned similar instances.[1337] It\r\nwould even appear that metallic lead may have the same effect when taken\r\ninwardly. Thus Dr. Ruva of Cilavegno has related the case of a man who\r\nwas violently attacked with the colic form of the effects of lead after\r\ntaking six ounces of shot by direction of a quack for the cure of\r\ndyspepsia, and was seized again with the same symptoms six days\r\nafterwards on taking four ounces more. On the second occasion he had\r\nviolent colic, great feebleness of the limbs, constant vomiting of any\r\nthing he swallowed, severe headache, and other analogous symptoms, of\r\nwhich he was not effectually cured for seven weeks.[1338] A case\r\nsomewhat similar, but less severe, has been described by Dr.\r\nBruce.[1339]—With regard to lead colic being excited by unguents and\r\nlotions applied to the surface of the body, Sir George Baker mentions a\r\ncase of violent colic brought on by litharge ointment applied to the\r\nvagina; he adds that children have been thrown into convulsions by the\r\nsame substance sprinkled on sores: and he quotes Zeller for a case where\r\nsymptoms of poisoning were occasioned by sprinkling the axilla with it,\r\nas a cure for redness of the face.[1340] Dr. Wall, in a letter to the\r\npreceding author, mentions his having seen the bowels affected by\r\nGoulard’s extract applied to ulcers; in another paper he has given two\r\nunequivocal cases, in one of which colic was brought on by saturnine\r\nlotions applied to a pustular disease, and in the other by immersing the\r\nlegs twice a day for ten days in a bath of the solution of acetate of\r\nlead:[1341] and lately Dr. Taufflieb of Barr observed lead colic to\r\narise from the continued use of diachylon plaster during eleven weeks\r\nfor dressing an extensive ulcer.[1342] Such accidents are exceedingly\r\nrare, and some auxiliary cause must have favoured the operation of the\r\npoison in the cases now noticed; for every one knows that free use is\r\nmade of lead unguents and lotions, yet we seldom hear of any bad\r\nconsequences.—These cases, however, will probably remove the doubts\r\nwhich some entertain of the possibility of lead colic being induced by\r\nthe application of the compounds of lead to the sound skin in those\r\ntrades which compel the workmen to be constantly handling them. At the\r\nsame time it must be admitted, that in all these trades there exists a\r\nmore obvious and ready channel for the introduction of the poison;\r\nbecause the workmen are either exposed to breathe its fumes, or are apt\r\nto transfer its particles from the fingers into the stomach with their\r\nfood.—Of all exposures none is more rapid and certain than breathing the\r\nvapours or dust of the preparations of lead. But for that very reason\r\nworkmen who are so exposed seldom suffer; because the greatness of the\r\nrisk has led to the discovery of means to avert it, and the openness of\r\nthe danger renders it easy for the workmen to apply them. Tanquerel\r\nmentions a singular case of a woman who was attacked in consequence of\r\nthe fine dust of white lead ascending through chinks in the floor from a\r\nroom below, where a perfumer was in the practice of grinding and sifting\r\nthat substance.[1343]—It may be added that Dr. Otto of Copenhagen has\r\npublished an extraordinary instance of fatal lead-colic, originating in\r\nthe habitual use of Macuba snuff adulterated with twenty per cent. of\r\nred lead.[1344]\r\n\r\nTo these observations on the various ways in which lead insidiously\r\nenters the system a few remarks may be added on the trades which expose\r\nworkmen to its influence. The most accurate information on this subject\r\nis contained in the work of Mérat.\r\n\r\nHe places foremost in the list miners of lead. In this country miners\r\nare now rarely affected, because the frequency of colica pictonum among\r\nthem formerly led their masters to study the subject, and to employ\r\nproper precautions for removing the danger. It has been stated by Dr.\r\nPercival, and is generally thought, that the whole workmen in lead mines\r\nare apt to be attacked with the colic,—those who dig the sulphuret as\r\nwell as those who roast the ore.[1345] If this idea were correct, it\r\nwould be in contradiction with the general principle in toxicology, that\r\nthe metals are not poisonous unless oxidated. But the opinion is in all\r\nprobability founded on error; for, according to information communicated\r\nto me by Mr. Braid, and confirmed since by personal investigation, the\r\nworkmen at Leadhills who dig and pulverize the ore, although liable to\r\nvarious diseases connected with their profession, and particularly to\r\npectoral complaints, never have lead colic till they also work at the\r\nsmelting furnaces. Next to miners may be ranked manufacturers of\r\nlitharge, red-lead and white-lead. The workmen at these manufactories\r\nare exposed to inhale the fumes from the furnaces or the dust from the\r\npulverizing mills. It has been chiefly among the workmen of a former\r\nwhite-lead manufactory in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh that I have had\r\nan opportunity of witnessing the lead colic. By a simple change the\r\nproprietor made in the process, and which will be mentioned presently,\r\nthe disease was almost extirpated some years before the manufactory was\r\ngiven up.\r\n\r\nNext in order, perhaps in the same class with colour-makers, are\r\nhouse-painters. The causes of their liability is the great quantity of\r\nthe preparations of lead contained in the paints they use. It would\r\nappear that lead colic is most frequent among people of that trade in\r\ncities of the largest size. In Geneva, as I am informed by my friend Dr.\r\nC. Coindet of that place, colica pictonum is now almost unknown and\r\nnever occurs among painters. In Edinburgh it is also little known among\r\npainters. A journeyman painter, a patient of mine in the Infirmary, had\r\nbeen seventeen years in the trade, and yet did not know what the\r\npainters’ colic or lead palsy meant. In London, according to the\r\nDispensary reports, and in Paris, according to the tables of Mérat, many\r\nworkmen of that trade suffer. I have been informed by an intelligent\r\nworkman, once a patient of mine, who had been a journeyman painter both\r\nin London and Edinburgh, that the number of his acquaintances who had\r\nbeen affected with colic in the metropolis was incomparably greater than\r\nhere. This man ascribed the difference to the working hours being more\r\nin the former place, so that the men had not leisure enough to make it\r\nworth their while to clean themselves carefully in the intervals. This\r\nappears a rational explanation. I do not know how the great prevalence\r\nof colic among painters in Paris is to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nPlumbers, sheet-lead manufacturers, and lead-pipe makers, are also for\r\nobvious reasons apt to suffer; but as they are not necessarily exposed\r\nto the vapours of lead, and suffer only in consequence of handling it in\r\nthe metallic form, it ought to be an easy matter to protect them. They\r\nthemselves conceive that a very hazardous part of their occupation is\r\nthe removing the melted lead from the melting pot, to make the sheets or\r\npipes; but this operation cannot be dangerous if the melting pots are\r\nproperly constructed.\r\n\r\nA few cases of lead colic occur among glass-blowers, glaziers, and\r\npotters, who use the oxide of lead in their respective trades.\r\n\r\nThere are a few also among lapidaries and others, who use it for\r\ngrinding and polishing, and among grocers and colourmen who sell its\r\nvarious preparations. Printers seldom suffer from the colic, but are\r\ngenerally thought liable to partial palsy of the hands, which is\r\nascribed to frequent handling of the types. I have met with one case\r\napparently of this nature.\r\n\r\nLead is not the only metal to which the power of inducing colica\r\npictonum has been ascribed. Mérat has mentioned several instances of the\r\ndisease occurring among brass-founders and other artizans who work with\r\ncopper.[1346] Tronchin quotes Scheuchzer for a set of well-marked cases\r\nin a convent of monks, where the malady was supposed to have been traced\r\nto all the utensils for preparing and keeping their food having been\r\nmade of untinned copper.[1347] The same author mentions two cases, one\r\nof which came under his immediate notice, where the apparent cause was\r\nthe long-continued use of antimonial preparations internally.[1348]\r\nMérat likewise found a few iron-smiths and white-iron-smiths in the\r\nlists kept at one of the Parisian hospitals.[1349] Chevallier alleges\r\nthat colic occurs at times among money-changers at Paris, and others who\r\nconstantly handle silver.[1350] Cases have even been noticed by Mérat\r\namong varnishers, plasterers, quarrymen, stone-hewers, marble-workers,\r\nstatuaries, saltpetre-makers;[1351] and Tronchin enumerates among its\r\ncauses the immoderate use of acid wine or of cider, checked\r\nperspiration, sea-scurvy, and melancholy. But the only substance besides\r\nlead, whose operation in producing colica pictonum has been traced with\r\nany degree of probability, is copper; and even among artizans who work\r\nwith copper the disease is very rare. As to the other tradesmen\r\nmentioned by Mérat, it is so very uncommon among them, that we may\r\nsafely impute it, when it does occur, to some other agent besides what\r\nthe trade of the individual exposes him to; and in general the secret\r\nintroduction of lead into the body may be presumed to be the real cause.\r\nStill, however, the connection of colica pictonum with other causes\r\nbesides the poison of lead is upheld by so many facts, and is believed\r\nby so many authorities, that this disease cannot be safely assumed, even\r\nin its most characteristic form, as supplying undoubted evidence of the\r\nintroduction of lead into the system. Dr. Burton thinks it will when the\r\nblue line at the edge of the gums is seen.\r\n\r\nThe work of Mérat contains some interesting numerical documents,\r\nillustrative of the trades which expose artisans to colica pictonum.\r\nThey are derived from the lists kept at the hospital of La Charité in\r\nParis, during the years 1776 and 1811. The total number of cases of\r\ncolica pictonum in both years was 279. Of these, 241 were artisans whose\r\ntrades exposed them to the poison of lead, namely, 148 painters, 28\r\nplumbers, 16 potters, 15 porcelain-makers, 12 lapidaries, 9\r\ncolour-grinders, 3 glass-blowers, 2 glaziers, 2 toy-men, 2 shoemakers, a\r\nprinter, a lead-miner, a leaf-beater, a shot-manufacturer. Of the\r\nremainder, 17 belonged to trades in which they were exposed to copper,\r\nnamely, 7 button-makers, 5 brass-founders, 4 braziers, and a\r\ncopper-turner. The remaining twenty-one were tradesmen, who worked\r\nlittle, or not at all with either metal, namely, 4 varnishers, 2\r\ngilders, 2 locksmiths, a hatter, a saltpetre-maker, a winegrocer, a\r\nvine-dresser, a labourer, a distiller, a stone-cutter, a calciner,[1352]\r\na soldier, a house-servant, a waiter, and an attorney’s clerk.—Age or\r\nyouth seems not to afford any protection against the poison. Of the 279\r\ncases, 24 were under twenty, and among these were several painter-boys\r\nnot above fifteen years old; 113 were between nineteen and thirty; 66\r\nbetween twenty-nine and forty; 38 between thirty-nine and fifty; 28\r\nbetween forty-nine and sixty; and 10 older than sixty. These proportions\r\ncorrespond pretty nearly with the relative number of workmen of similar\r\nages.—Among the 279 cases fifteen died, or 5·4 per cent.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have lately been little or no diminution in the frequency\r\nof the disease in Paris. In 1833–4–5–6, there were treated in the\r\nhospitals 1541 cases, or 385 annually; of whom one in 39½ died. And in\r\n1839–40–41 there were 761 cases, or 252 annually; of whom one in 24½\r\ndied. Of 302 cases in 1841 no fewer then 266 were from white-lead\r\nmanufactories.[1353]\r\n\r\n\r\n        SECTION III.—_Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Lead._\r\n\r\nThe morbid appearances caused by poisoning with lead are in some\r\nrespects peculiar.\r\n\r\nIn acute poisoning, from the irritant action of its soluble salts, as in\r\nthe case of the drummer poisoned by Goulard’s extract, the lower end of\r\nthe gullet, the whole stomach and duodenum, part of the jejunum, and the\r\nascending and transverse colon, have been found much inflamed, and the\r\nvillous coat of the stomach as if macerated. In Mr. Taylor’s two cases\r\nDr. Bird found the villous coat of the stomach gray, but otherwise\r\nnatural; and the intestines were much contracted.\r\n\r\nThe stomach in the first of these cases contained a reddish-brown,\r\nsweetish, styptic fluid, in which lead was detected by chemical\r\nanalysis,[1354]—an important medico-legal fact, since the man survived\r\nnearly three days. Some valuable observations have been made by\r\nProfessor Orfila as to the presence of lead in the textures of the\r\nstomach in such instances. When small doses of acetate or nitrate of\r\nlead were administered to dogs and allowed to act for two hours only,\r\nthe villous coat presented numerous streaks of white points, which\r\ncontained lead, as hydrosulphuric acid blackened them. These points,\r\nthough less distinct, were still visible, when the animals were allowed\r\nto live four days after the excess of salt had been removed; and even\r\nafter seventeen days, although no such appearance remained, lead could\r\nstill be detected in the tissues of the stomach.[1355]\r\n\r\nThe blood in animals is sometimes altered. Dr. Campbell found it fluid.\r\nIn a dog poisoned with litharge, the experimentalists of the Veterinary\r\nSchool at Lyons found it of a vermilion colour in the veins, and\r\nbrighter than usual in the arteries.[1356] Mitscherlich also found it\r\nunusually red and firmly coagulated.[1357]\r\n\r\nThe appearances in the bodies of those who have died of the various\r\nforms of lead colic are different, and wholly unconnected with\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\nThe valuable work of Mérat contains four inspections after death from\r\nthe acute or comatose form of colica pictonum. The bodies were plump,\r\nmuscular and fat. The alimentary canal was quite empty, and the colon\r\nmuch contracted,—in one to an extraordinary degree. The mucous coat of\r\nthe alimentary canal was everywhere healthy. He therefore infers that\r\nthe disease is an affection of the muscular coat only. It is a striking\r\ncircumstance, and conformable with what will be afterwards established\r\nin regard to the true narcotics, that although both of the men died\r\nconvulsed and comatose, no morbid appearance was visible within the\r\nhead.[1358] Another case, which confirms the foregoing facts, has been\r\ndescribed by Mr. Deering. It was that of a lady who died convulsed after\r\nsuffering in the usual manner, and in whose body no trace of disease\r\ncould be detected any where.[1359] Senac informed Tronchin that he had\r\ndissected above fifty cases of colica pictonum, and found no morbid\r\nappearances.[1360] Schloepfer’s observations on animals are to the same\r\neffect. In rabbits which died of colica pictonum the great intestines\r\nwere excessively contracted, but all the other organs of the body were\r\nhealthy except the liver, which was dark and brittle.[1361] Mitscherlich\r\nobserved in his animals extravasation of blood into the intestines, also\r\nsometimes into the cavities of the pleura and peritoneum, and\r\noccasionally under the peritoneal covering of the kidneys.[1362] The\r\nonly instance I have met with where morbid appearances were found within\r\nthe head, was in a case mentioned by Sir G. Baker, of a gentleman who\r\ndied apoplectic after many attacks of colica pictonum, and in whom the\r\nbrain was found unusually soft, and blood extravasated on its surface to\r\nthe amount of an ounce.[1363]\r\n\r\nThe appearances in those who have been long affected with the paralytic\r\nform of colica pictonum have been rarely observed in modern times. I am\r\nindebted to my late colleague, Dr. Duncan, Junior, for an account of the\r\nappearances in the intestinal canal of a plumber, who had been long and\r\nfrequently afflicted with colica pictonum and its sequelæ. The\r\nintestines were dark, tender, and far advanced in putrefaction. The\r\ncardiac orifice of the stomach was so narrow that it would admit a\r\ngoose-quill. The mesenteric glands were enlarged and hardened. The\r\nthoracic duct was surrounded by many large bodies like diseased glands,\r\nexactly of the colour of lead, and composed of organized cysts\r\ncontaining apparently an inorganic matter. The analysis of this matter\r\nwas unfortunately neglected. The muscles in similar circumstances are\r\nmuch diseased. When the paralysis is not of long standing, it appears\r\nfrom the experiments of Schloepfer (whose animals survived about three\r\nweeks), that the whole muscular system becomes pale, bloodless, and\r\nflaccid. When the palsy is of long standing, this change increases so\r\nmuch, that the muscles in some parts, as in the arms and thumbs, acquire\r\nthe colour and general aspect of white fibrous tissue. Some observations\r\non the nature of these changes will be found in the essays of Sir G.\r\nBaker.[1364] The facts are communicated by Mr. John Hunter. On examining\r\nthe muscles of the arm and hand of a house-painter who was killed by an\r\naccident, Mr. Hunter found them all of a cream colour, and very opaque,\r\ntheir fibres distinct, and their texture unusually dry and tough. These\r\nalterations he at first imagined might have been the result merely of\r\nthe palsy and consequent inactivity of the muscles, but on finding the\r\nsame alterations produced by the direct action of sugar of lead on\r\nmuscle, he inferred that the poison gradually effected a change either\r\non the muscles directly, or on the blood which supplied them.\r\n\r\nIn a late elaborate inquiry into the pathology of lead-colic, M.\r\nTanquerel has arrived at the conclusion, that “the pathological\r\nphenomena are not caused by anatomical changes cognisable by the\r\nsenses,” and that such appearances as may be found are the effects, not\r\nthe cause, of the disease.[1365]\r\n\r\n\r\n         SECTION IV.—_Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Lead._\r\n\r\nThe treatment of poisoning with lead, and the mode of protecting workmen\r\nfrom its influence, will now require a few remarks.\r\n\r\nFor the irritant form of poisoning, a safe and effectual antidote exists\r\nin any of the soluble alkaline or earthy sulphates. If none of these be\r\nat hand, then the alkaline carbonates may be given, particularly the\r\nbicarbonates, which are not so irritating as the carbonates. The\r\nphosphate of soda is also an excellent antidote. If the patient does not\r\nvomit, it will be right also to give an emetic of the sulphate of zinc.\r\nIn other respects, the treatment does not differ from that of poisoning\r\nwith the irritants generally.\r\n\r\nColica pictonum is usually treated in this country with great success by\r\na practice much followed here in colic and diarrhœa of all kinds,—the\r\nconjunction of purgatives with anodynes. A full dose of a neutral\r\nlaxative salt is given, and an hour afterwards a full dose of opium.\r\nSometimes alvine discharges take place before the opium acts, more\r\ncommonly not till its action is past, and occasionally not for a\r\nconsiderable time afterwards. But the pain and vomiting subside, the\r\nrestlessness and irritability pass away, and the bowels return nearly or\r\nentirely to their natural condition. Sometimes it is necessary to repeat\r\nthe practice. It is almost always successful. I have seldom seen the\r\nsecond dose fail to remove the colic, leaving the bowels at worst in a\r\nstate of constipation. Dr. Alderson of Hull, who has had many\r\nopportunities of treating the workmen of a white-lead manufactory there,\r\nsays powerful purgatives, such as croton-oil, are highly serviceable in\r\nsevere cases, and are borne well notwithstanding the extreme debility\r\noften present.[1366] M. Tanquerel says he has found this treatment more\r\neffectual in Paris than any other means.[1367] When the pulse is full\r\nand strong, I have seen venesection premised with apparent advantage; in\r\nsome instances it appeared to me to be called for by the flushing of the\r\nface and the violence of the spasms; and I have never seen it otherwise\r\nthan a safe remedy, notwithstanding the fears expressed by Dr. Warren\r\nand others.[1368]\r\n\r\nThe hospital of La Charité in Paris has long enjoyed a high reputation\r\nfor the treatment of this disease. In the first place a decoction is\r\ngiven of half an ounce of senna in a pound of water, mixed with half an\r\nounce of sulphate of magnesia and four ounces of the wine of antimony.\r\nNext day an ounce of sulphate of magnesia and three grains of\r\ntartar-emetic are administered in two pounds of infusion of cassia, to\r\nkeep up the operation of the first laxative. In the evening a clyster is\r\ngiven, containing twelve ounces of wine and half as much oil. After this\r\nthe patient is made to vomit with tartar-emetic, then drenched with\r\n_ptisanes_ for several days, and the treatment is wound up with another\r\ndose of the first purgative succeeded by gentle anodynes. I am not aware\r\nof any particular advantage possessed by this complicated and tormenting\r\nmethod of cure, which is not equally possessed by the simpler plan\r\npursued in Britain.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 M. Gendrin announced to the French Institute that he had found\r\nsulphuric acid to be at once the most effectual remedy, and the most\r\ncertain preventive, for the injurious effects of lead; and he has\r\nsubsequently spoken in strong terms of the utility of this\r\ntreatment.[1369] But the experience of others does not bear out his\r\nconclusions.[1370]\r\n\r\nAmong the many other methods of cure that have been proposed for the\r\nprimary stage of this disease, salivation by mercury deserves to be\r\nparticularized. It appears to have been often used with success, the\r\ncolic yielding as soon as ptyalism sets in.[1371] If the case, however,\r\nis severe, there is no time to lose in waiting for the action of the\r\nmercury to commence.\r\n\r\nThe treatment in the advanced period of the disease, when palsy is the\r\nchief symptom remaining, depends almost entirely on regimen. The patient\r\nmust for a time at least quit altogether his unlucky trade. He should be\r\nallowed the most generous food he can digest. He ought to take frequent\r\ngentle exercise in the open air, but never to fatigue. The hands being\r\nthe most severely injured of the affected parts, and at the same time\r\nthe most important to the workman, the practitioner’s attention should\r\nbe directed peculiarly to the restoration of their muscular power. This\r\nappears to be most easily brought about by frictions, electricity, and\r\nregulated exercise, the hands being also supported in the intervals by\r\nsplints extending from the elbows to the fingers. The dragging of the\r\nemaciated muscles by the weight of the dangling hands certainly seems to\r\nretard recovery.—Strychnia has also been repeatedly found of service in\r\nrestoring muscular action. Tanquerel states that electricity and\r\nstrychnia, but especially the latter, have appeared to him by far the\r\nmost efficacious remedies both for muscular paralysis and for\r\namaurosis.—In the head affections the best treatment consists in relying\r\non nature and merely combating symptoms; and blood-letting is of no use,\r\nhowever much it may seem to be indicated by the coma and convulsions.\r\n\r\nWhen a person has been once attacked with colica pictonum, he is more\r\neasily attacked again. Hence if he is young enough, he should, if\r\npossible, change his profession for one in which he is not brought into\r\nproximity with lead. Few, however, have it in their power to do so. The\r\nprophylaxis, therefore, or mode of preventing the influence of the\r\npoison, becomes a subject of great importance; and more particularly\r\nwhen we consider the vast number of workmen in different trades, whose\r\nsafety it is intended to secure.\r\n\r\nOn this subject many useful instructions are laid down in the work of\r\nMérat. He very properly sets out with insisting on the utmost regard\r\nbeing paid to cleanliness,—a point too much neglected by most artizans,\r\nand particularly by those to whom it is most necessary, the artizans who\r\nwork with the metals. In proof of the importance of this rule, he\r\nobserves he knew a potter, who contracted the lead colic early in life\r\nwhen he was accustomed to go about very dirty, but for thirty years\r\nafter had not any return of it, in consequence simply of a scrupulous\r\nattention to cleanliness. In order to secure due cleanliness three\r\npoints should be attended to. In the first place, the face and hands\r\nshould be washed once a day at least, the mouth well rinsed, and the\r\nhair occasionally combed. Secondly, frequent bathing is of great\r\nconsequence, both with a view to cleanliness and as a general tonic; so\r\nthat masters should provide their workmen with sufficient means and\r\nopportunities for practising it. Lastly, the working clothes should be\r\nmade, not of woollen, but of strong, compact linen, should be changed\r\nand washed at least once and still better twice a week, and should be\r\nworn as little as possible out of the workshop. While at work a cap of\r\nsome light impervious material should always be worn.\r\n\r\nNext to cleanliness, the most important article of the prophylaxis\r\nrelates to the means for preventing the food being impregnated with\r\nlead. For this end it is essential that the workmen never take their\r\nmeals in the workshop, and that before eating they wash their lips and\r\nhands with soap and water, and brush out all particles of dirt from the\r\nnails. It is also of moment that they breakfast before going to work in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nDerangements of the digestive organs should be watched with great care.\r\nIf they appear to arise from the poison of lead, the individual should\r\nleave off work with the very first symptom, and take a laxative.\r\nHabitual constipation should be provided against.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the diet of the workmen is of some consequence. It should\r\nbe as far as possible of a nutritive and digestible kind. Mérat condemns\r\nin strong terms the small tart wines generally used by the lower ranks\r\nof his countrymen. They constitute a very poor drink for all artizans;\r\nand are peculiarly ill adapted for those who work with lead, because,\r\nbesides being at times themselves adulterated with that poison, they are\r\nalso apt to disorder the bowels by their acidity. Beer is infinitely\r\npreferable. Various articles of diet have been recommended as tending to\r\nimpede the operation of the poison. Hoffmann recommends brandy, the\r\nefficacy of which few workmen will dispute. There is some reason for\r\nbelieving that the free use of fat and fatty articles of food is a\r\npreservative. Dehaen was informed by the proprietor and the physician of\r\na lead mine in Styria, that the work-people were once very liable to\r\ncolic and palsy, but that, after being told by a quack doctor to eat a\r\ngood deal of fat, especially at breakfast, they were exempt for three\r\nyears.[1372] Another fact of the kind was communicated to Sir George\r\nBaker by a physician at Osterhoüt, near Breda. The village contained a\r\ngreat number of potters, among whom he did not witness a single case of\r\nlead colic in the course of fifteen years; and he attributes their\r\nimmunity to their having lived much on cheese, butter, bacon, and other\r\nfatty kinds of food.[1373] Mr. Wilson says, in his account of the colic\r\nat Leadhills in Lanarkshire, that English workmen, who live much on fat\r\nmeat, suffer less than Scotchmen, who do not.[1374]\r\n\r\nProfessor Liebig says that lead colic is unknown in all white-lead\r\nmanufactories, where the workmen use as a beverage lemonade or\r\nsugar-water acidulated with sulphuric acid; and it was stated above that\r\nthe same announcement has been made by Mr. Gendrin. This, however, is\r\ndoubtful. The prophylactic effects of sulphuric acid have been denied in\r\nFrance by M. Tanquerel,[1375] and M. Grisolle;[1376] the latter of whom\r\nin particular says that no advantage whatever was derived from it at the\r\nwhite-lead manufactory of Clichy near Paris.\r\n\r\nSome have likewise proposed as an additional preservative, that the\r\nexposed parts of the body should be anointed with oily or fatty matters.\r\nBut Mérat maintains with some reason, that the lead will be thereby\r\nenabled to penetrate the cuticle more easily by friction and pressure.\r\n\r\nThe observance of the preceding rules will depend of course in a great\r\nmeasure on the intelligence and docility of the workmen. It would appear\r\nthat particular care should be taken in hot weather, statistical facts\r\nhaving shown that three times as many workmen are attacked in Paris\r\nduring the month of January as in July.[1377]\r\n\r\nSome other objects of much consequence are to be attained by the\r\nhumanity and skill of the masters.\r\n\r\nThe workshop should be spacious, and both thoroughly and systematically\r\nventilated, the external air being freely admitted when the weather will\r\nallow, and particular currents being established, by which floating\r\nparticles are carried away in certain invariable and known courses.\r\nMiners and others who work at furnaces in which lead is smelted, fused,\r\nor oxidated, should be protected by a strong draught through the\r\nfurnaces. According to Mr. Braid, wherever furnaces of such a\r\nconstruction were built at Leadhills, the colic disappeared; while it\r\ncontinued to recur where the furnaces were of the old, low-chimneyed\r\nform. Manufacturers of litharge and red-lead used formerly to suffer\r\nmuch in consequence of the furnaces being so constructed as to compel\r\nthem to inhale the fine dust of the oxides. In drawing the furnaces the\r\nhot material is raked out upon the floor, which is two or three feet\r\nbelow the aperture in the furnace; and the finer particles are therefore\r\ndriven up and diffused through the apartment. But this obvious danger is\r\nnow completely averted by a subsidiary chimney, which rises in front of\r\nthe drawing aperture, and through which a strong current of air is\r\nattracted from the apartment, the hot material on the ground performing\r\nthe part of a fire.\r\n\r\nIn white-lead manufactories a very important and simple improvement has\r\nbeen effected of late in some places by abandoning the practice of\r\ndry-grinding. In all manufactories of the kind, the ultimate pulverizing\r\nof the white lead has been long performed under water. But in general\r\nthe preparatory process of rolling, by which the carbonate is separated\r\nfrom the sheets of lead on which it is formed, continues to be executed\r\ndry. This is a very dangerous operation, because the workmen must inhale\r\na great deal of the fine dust of the carbonate. In a white-lead\r\nmanufactory which formerly existed at Portobello, the process was\r\nentirely performed under water or with damping; and to this precaution\r\nin a great measure was imputed the improvement effected by the\r\nproprietor in the health of the workmen, and their superior immunity\r\nfrom disease over those of Hull and other places, where the same\r\nprecaution was not taken at that time. The only operation latterly\r\nconsidered dangerous at the Portobello works was the emptying of the\r\ndrying stove, and the packing of the white lead in barrels; and the dust\r\ndiffused in that process was kept down as much as possible by the floor\r\nbeing maintained constantly damp. By these precautions, by making the\r\nworkmen wash their hands and faces before leaving the works for their\r\nmeals, and by administering a brisk dose of castor oil on the first\r\nappearance of any complaint of the stomach or bowels, the manufacturer\r\nsucceeded in extirpating colica pictonum entirely for several\r\nyears.—This trade continues to be a very pernicious one in France; for\r\nno fewer than 266 cases of colic were admitted into the Parisian\r\nhospitals in 1841 from the white-lead manufactories in and near the\r\ncapital. Yet facts are not wanting there to prove that with proper care\r\nthe disease may be all but extirpated. A French manufacturer, whose\r\nworkmen at one time suffered severely, had no case of colic among them\r\nfor nine years after breaking them in to the observance of due\r\nprecautions.[1378] Another says, from his own experience and information\r\nobtained at other works, he is satisfied the risk is very much greater\r\namong the intemperate than among sober workmen.[1379]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n                       OF POISONING WITH BARYTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaryta and its salts, the last genus of the metallic irritants which\r\nrequires particular notice, are commonly arranged among earthy\r\nsubstances, but on account of their chemical and physiological\r\nproperties, may be correctly considered in the present place. These\r\npoisons are worthy of notice, because they are not only energetic, but\r\nlikewise easily procured, so that they may be more extensively used,\r\nwhen more generally known.\r\n\r\n\r\n   SECTION I.—_Of the Chemical Tests for the preparations of Baryta._\r\n\r\nThree compounds of this substance may be mentioned, the pure earth or\r\noxide, the muriate, or chloride of barium, and the carbonate. The pure\r\nearth, however, is so little seen, that it is unnecessary to describe\r\nits chemical or physiological properties.\r\n\r\nThe _Carbonate of Baryta_ is met with in two states. Sometimes it is\r\nnative, and then commonly occurs in radiated crystalline masses, of\r\ndifferent degrees of coarseness of fibre, nearly colourless, very heavy,\r\nand effervescing with diluted muriatic acid. It is also sold in the\r\nshops in the form of a fine powder of a white colour, prepared\r\nartificially by precipitating a soluble salt of baryta with an alkaline\r\ncarbonate. It is best known by its colour, insolubility in water,\r\nsolubility with effervescence in muriatic acid, and the properties of\r\nthe resulting muriate of baryta.\r\n\r\nThe _Muriate of Baryta_, or chloride of barium, is the most common of\r\nthe compounds of this earth, having been for some time used in medicine\r\nfor scrofulous and other constitutional disorders. It is procured either\r\nby evaporating the solution of the carbonate in hydrochloric acid, or by\r\ndecomposing a more common mineral, the sulphate, by means of charcoal\r\naided by heat, dissolving in boiling water the sulphuret so formed, and\r\ndecomposing this sulphuret by hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly met with in the shops irregularly crystallized in tables.\r\nIt has an acrid, irritating taste, is permanent in the air, and\r\ndissolves in two parts and a half of temperate water.\r\n\r\nThe solution is distinguished from other substances by the following\r\nchemical characters. From all other metallic poisons hitherto mentioned,\r\nit is easily distinguished by means of hydrosulphuric acid, which does\r\nnot cause any change in barytic solutions. From the alkaline and\r\nmagnesian salts it is distinguished by the effects of the alkaline\r\nsulphates, which have no visible action except on the barytic solution,\r\nand cause in it a heavy white precipitate, insoluble in nitric acid.\r\nFrom the chlorides of calcium and strontium, it is to be distinguished\r\nby evaporating the solution till it crystallizes. The crystals are known\r\nnot to be chloride of calcium, because they are not deliquescent. The\r\nchloride of strontium (which resembles that of barium in many\r\nproperties, but which must be carefully distinguished, as it is not\r\npoisonous), differs in the form of the crystals, which are delicate\r\nsix-sided prisms, while those of the barytic salt are four-sided tables,\r\noften truncated on two opposite angles, sometimes on all four,—by its\r\nsolubility in alcohol, which does not take up the chloride of\r\nbarium,—and by its effect on the flame of alcohol, which it colours\r\nrose-red, while the barytic salts colour it yellow. The chloride of\r\nbarium is known from other soluble barytic salts, by the action of\r\nnitrate of silver, which throws down a white precipitate.\r\n\r\nVegetable and animal fluids do not decompose the solution of chloride of\r\nbarium, except by reason of the sulphates and carbonates which most of\r\nthem contain in small quantities. But the action of its tests may be\r\ndistinguished, although the salt has not undergone decomposition. In\r\nthat case the most convenient method of analysis is to add a little\r\nnitric acid, which will dissolve any carbonate of baryta that may have\r\nbeen formed,—to filter and then throw down the whole baryta in the form\r\nof sulphate, by means of the sulphate of soda,—and to collect the\r\nprecipitate, and calcine it with charcoal for half an hour in a platinum\r\nspoon or earthen crucible, according to the quantity. A sulphuret of\r\nbaryta will thus be procured, which is to be dissolved out by boiling\r\nwater, and decomposed after filtration by muriatic acid. A pure solution\r\nis thus easily obtained. Orfila has lately proposed a process more\r\ncomplex in its details, but the same in principle.[1380]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—_Of the Action of the Salts of Baryta, and the Symptoms they\r\n                            excite in Man._\r\n\r\nThe action of the barytic salts on the body is energetic. Like most\r\nmetallic poisons, they seem to possess a twofold action,—one local and\r\nirritating, the other remote and indicated by narcotic symptoms. This\r\nnarcotic action is more decided and invariable than in the instance of\r\nany of the metallic poisons hitherto noticed. Such at least is the\r\nresult of the experiments of Sir B. Brodie,[1381] which have since been\r\namply confirmed by Professor Orfila[1382] and Professor Gmelin.[1383]\r\nOrfila found that when the chloride was injected into the veins of a dog\r\nin the dose of five grains only, death ensued in six minutes, and was\r\npreceded by convulsions, at first partial, but afterwards affecting the\r\nwhole body. Sir B. Brodie found the same effects follow in twenty\r\nminutes, when ten grains were applied to a wound in the back of a\r\nrabbit,—the convulsions being preceded by palsy, and ending in coma.\r\nHalf an ounce when injected into the stomach excited the same symptoms\r\nin a cat, and proved fatal in sixty-five minutes, though the animal\r\nvomited. Schloepfer observed, that when a scruple, dissolved in two\r\ndrachms of water, was injected into the windpipe of a rabbit, it fell\r\ndown immediately, threw back its head, was convulsed in the fore-legs,\r\nand died in twelve minutes.[1384] Gmelin observed in his experiments\r\nthat it caused slight inflammation of the stomach, and strong symptoms\r\nof an action on the brain, spine, and voluntary muscles. He found the\r\nvoluntary muscles destitute of contractility immediately after death;\r\nyet the heart continued to contract vigorously for some time, even\r\nwithout the application of any stimulus. From some experiments made on\r\nhorses by Huzard and Biron, by order of the Société de Santé of Paris,\r\nit appears that the hydrochlorate, when given to these animals in the\r\ndose of two drachms daily, produced sudden death about the fifteenth\r\nday, without previous symptoms of any consequence.[1385] In the\r\nexperiments now related, very little appearance of inflammation was\r\nfound in the parts to which the poison was directly applied. It is also\r\nworthy of remark that the heart does not seem to have been particularly\r\naffected; and yet according to the recent researches of Mr. Blake, the\r\nbarytic salts are the most powerful of all inorganic poisons in their\r\naction on the heart, when they are injected into the veins. A quarter of\r\na grain of the chloride appreciably depresses arterial action; two\r\ngrains completely arrest the heart’s contractions in twelve seconds; and\r\nwhen it is injected back into the aorta from the axillary artery, it\r\ncauses at first some obstruction to the capillary circulation, but soon\r\narrests the action of the heart, as when it is introduced into the\r\nveins.[1386]\r\n\r\nThe pure earth appears to produce nearly the same effects in an inferior\r\ndose. When swallowed, the symptoms of local irritation are more violent;\r\nbut death ensues in a very short space of time, and is preceded by\r\nconvulsions and insensibility. The stomach after death is found of a\r\nreddish-black colour, and frequently with spots of extravasated blood in\r\nits villous coat.\r\n\r\nThe carbonate in a state of minute division is scarcely less active than\r\nthe hydrochlorate, since it is dissolved by the acid juices of the\r\nstomach. A drachm killed a dog in six hours; vomiting, expressions of\r\npain, and an approach to insensibility preceded death; and marks of\r\ninflammation were found in the stomach.[1387] Pelletier made many\r\nexperiments on the poisonous properties of the carbonate. Fifteen grains\r\nof the native carbonate killed one dog in eight hours, and another in\r\nfifteen.[1388] Dr. Campbell found it to be a dangerous poison, even when\r\napplied externally. Twelve grains introduced into a wound in the neck of\r\na cat, excited on the third day languor, slow respiration, and feeble\r\npulse; towards evening the animal became affected with convulsions of\r\nthe hind-legs and with dilated pupils; and death followed not long\r\nafterwards.[1389] This substance, before its real nature was known, used\r\nat one time to be employed in some parts of England as a variety of\r\narsenic for poisoning rats.\r\n\r\nThe salts of baryta are absorbed in the course of their action. The\r\nchloride has been detected by Dr. Kramer both in the blood and urine by\r\nincineration with carbonate of potash, washing the ashes with weak\r\nsolution of carbonate of potash, dissolving the residue in diluted\r\nnitric acid, and testing the solution for baryta.[1390] Orfila has also\r\nobtained baryta, by his process alluded to above, in the liver, kidneys,\r\nand spleen of animals killed by the chloride.[1391]\r\n\r\nThe symptoms produced by the salts of baryta in man have seldom been\r\nparticularly described. An instance is shortly noticed in the Journal of\r\nScience, where an ounce of the hydrochlorate was taken by mistake for\r\nGlauber’s salt, and proved fatal. The patient immediately after\r\nswallowing it felt a sense of burning in the stomach; vomiting,\r\nconvulsions, headache, and deafness ensued; and death took place within\r\nan hour.[1392] A similar case, fatal in two hours, has been related by\r\nDr. Wach of Merseburg. A middle-aged woman who, though generally in good\r\nhealth, had suffered for a day or two from pains in the stomach, took\r\none morning a solution of half an ounce of chloride of barium by mistake\r\nfor sulphate of soda. She was soon seized with sickness, retching,\r\nconvulsive twitches of the hands and feet, vomiting of clear mucus,\r\ngreat anxiety, restlessness, and loss of voice; and she died under\r\nconstant efforts to vomit, and violent convulsive movements, but with\r\nher faculties entire.[1393]\r\n\r\nUnpleasant effects have been observed from too large doses of the\r\nchloride administered medicinally. A case is mentioned in the Medical\r\nCommentaries of a gentleman who was directed to take a solution as a\r\nstomachic, but swallowed one evening by accident so much as seventy or\r\neighty drops. He had soon after profuse purging without tormina, then\r\nvomiting, and half an hour after swallowing the salt excessive muscular\r\ndebility, amounting to absolute paraplegia of the limbs. This state\r\nlasted about twenty-four hours, and then gradually went off.[1394] I\r\nhave known violent vomiting, gripes, and diarrhœa produced in like\r\nmanner by a quantity not much exceeding the usual medicinal doses.\r\n\r\nDr. Wilson of London has lately described a distinct case of poisoning\r\nwith the carbonate. The quantity taken was half a tea-cupful; but\r\nemetics were given, and operated before any symptoms showed themselves.\r\nIn two hours the patient complained of dimness of sight, double vision,\r\nheadache, tinnitus, and a sense of distension in the stomach, and\r\nsubsequently of pains in the knees and cramps of the legs, with\r\noccasional vomiting and purging next day; for some days afterwards the\r\nhead symptoms continued, though more mildly, and she was much subject to\r\nsevere palpitations; but she was in the way of recovery when the account\r\nof her case was published.[1395] Mr. Parkes mentions that, according to\r\ninformation communicated to him by the proprietor of an estate in\r\nLancashire, where carbonate of baryta abounds, many domestic animals on\r\nhis estate died in consequence of licking the dust of the carbonate, and\r\nthat it once proved fatal to two persons, a woman and her child, who\r\ntook each about a drachm.[1396] Dr. Johnstone says he once swallowed ten\r\ngrains of this compound, without experiencing any bad effect.[1397]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.—_Of the Morbid Appearances caused by the Salts of Baryta._\r\n\r\nIn animals the mucous membrane of the stomach is usually found of a\r\ndeep-red colour, unless death take place with great rapidity, in which\r\ncase the alimentary canal is healthy. In all the animals, which in Dr.\r\nCampbell’s experiments were killed by the application of the muriate to\r\nwounds, the brain and its membranes were much injected with blood; and\r\nin one of them the appearances were precisely those of congestive\r\napoplexy.\r\n\r\nIn Wach’s case the stomach was dark brownish-red externally, and the\r\nsmall intestines brighter red. Internally the stomach presented uniform\r\ndeep redness, with clots of blood, and bloody mucus scattered over it;\r\nand near the cardiac end there was a perforation, above half an inch in\r\ndiameter within, and half as wide at the outside, and surrounded with\r\nswollen edges and extensive thickening of the villous coat. The small\r\nintestines were internally very red and lined with red mucus\r\ninterspersed with clots of blood. The great intestines were extremely\r\ncontracted. The lungs were gorged, the heart full of dark liquid blood,\r\nand the cerebral vessels distended. Chloride of barium was detected in\r\nthe stomach and intestines. The perforation in this case was evidently\r\nan accidental concurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION IV.—_Of the Treatment._\r\n\r\nThe treatment of this variety of poisoning consists chiefly in the\r\nspeedy administration of some alkaline or earthy sulphate, such as the\r\nsulphate of soda or sulphate of magnesia. The poison is thus immediately\r\nconverted into the insoluble sulphate of baryta, which is quite inert.\r\nTwo drachms of muriate of baryta were injected by Orfila into the\r\nstomach of a dog, and eight minutes afterwards two drachms of sulphate\r\nof soda. The gullet was then secured by a ligature. At first efforts\r\nwere made to vomit, and in an hour sulphate of baryta was discharged\r\nwith the alvine evacuations. There was neither insensibility nor\r\nconvulsions; and the next morning the animal evidently suffered only\r\nfrom the ligature on the gullet. This fact not only proves the efficacy\r\nof the sulphate, but likewise shows that in the kinds of poisoning where\r\ndiarrhœa occurs, the poison is very soon discharged, and ought therefore\r\nto be looked for in the evacuations from the bowels.[1398]\r\n\r\n\r\nA few observations may be here added on the effects of the salts of\r\n_strontia_ on the animal frame. These compounds bear a close resemblance\r\nto the salts of baryta, and the two earths were consequently long\r\nconfounded together till Dr. Hope pointed out their distinctions. One of\r\nthe most striking differences is, that the salts of the strontia are\r\nvery feebly poisonous. Some experiments of this purport were made by M.\r\nPelletier of Paris,[1399] and by Blumenbach; but the most accurate\r\nresearches are those of Professor Gmelin. He found that ten grains of\r\nthe chloride in solution had no effect when injected into the jugular\r\nvein of a dog,—that two drachms had no effect when introduced into the\r\nstomach of a rabbit,—that half an ounce was required to cause death in\r\nthat way,—that two drachms of the carbonate had no effect,—and that two\r\ndrachms of the nitrate, dissolved in six parts of water and given to a\r\nrabbit, merely caused increase of the frequency and hardness of the\r\npulse and a brisk diarrhœa.[1400] Mr. Blake also found that small doses\r\nof the salts of strontia have little effect when injected into the\r\nveins; but that forty grains arrest the action of the heart in fifteen\r\nseconds.[1401]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth order of the irritant poisons contains a great number of\r\ngenera derived from the vegetable kingdom, and at one time commonly\r\narranged in a class by themselves under the title of Acrid Poisons. The\r\norder includes many plants of the natural families _Ranunculaceæ_,\r\n_Cucurbitaceæ_, and _Euphorbiaceæ_, and other plants scattered\r\nthroughout the botanical system. It likewise comprehends a second group\r\nconsisting of some acrid poisons from the animal kingdom, namely,\r\ncantharides, poisonous fishes, poisonous serpents, and animal matters\r\nbecome poisonous by disease or putrefaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                OF POISONING WITH THE VEGETABLE ACRIDS.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable acrids are the most characteristic poisons of this order.\r\nThey will not require many details, as they are seldom resorted to for\r\ncriminal purposes, and their mode of action, their symptoms, and their\r\nmorbid appearances are nearly the same in all.\r\n\r\nWe are chiefly indebted to Professor Orfila for our knowledge of their\r\n_mode of action_. He has subjected them to two sets of experiments. In\r\nthe first place, he introduced the poison in various doses into the\r\nstomach, sometimes tying the gullet, sometimes not: and, secondly, he\r\napplied the poison to the subcutaneous cellular tissue by thrusting it\r\ninto a recent wound.\r\n\r\nIn the former way he found that, unless the gullet was tied, the animal\r\nsoon discharged the poison by vomiting, and generally recovered; but\r\nthat, if the gullet was tied, death might be caused in no long time by\r\nmoderate doses. The symptoms were seldom remarkable. Commonly efforts\r\nwere made to vomit; frequently diarrhœa followed; then languor and\r\nlistlessness; sometimes, though not always, expressions of pain; very\r\nrarely convulsions; and death generally took place during the first day,\r\noften within three, six, or eight hours. The appearances in the dead\r\nbody were redness over the whole mucous coat of the stomach, at times\r\nremarkably vivid, often barely perceptible, and occasionally attended\r\nwith ulcers; very often a similar state of the whole intestines, more\r\nespecially of the rectum; and in some instances a slight increase of\r\ndensity, with diminished crepitation, in patches of the lungs.\r\n\r\nWhen the poison, on the other hand, was applied to a recent wound of the\r\nleg, the animal commonly whined more or less; great languor soon\r\nfollowed; and death took place on the first or second day, without\r\nconvulsions or any other symptom of note. It was seldom that any morbid\r\nappearance could then be discovered in the bowels. But in every instance\r\nactive inflammation was found in the wound, extending to the limb above\r\nit and even upwards on the trunk. Every part affected was gorged with\r\nblood and serum; and an eschar was never formed. The appearances in\r\nshort were precisely those of diffuse inflammation of the cellular\r\ntissue, when it proves fatal in its early stage.[1402]\r\n\r\nSince these poisons do not appear to act more energetically through a\r\nwound than through the stomach, it has been generally inferred that they\r\ndo not enter the blood, and consequently that the local impression they\r\nproduce is conveyed to distant organs through the nerves. This inference\r\nis correct in regard to such species of the vegetable acrids as act in\r\nsmall doses. But the validity of the conclusion may be questioned when\r\nthe poison acts only in large doses, as in the case with many of those\r\nnow under consideration. For they cannot be applied to a wound over a\r\nsurface equal to that of the stomach, and may therefore be more slowly\r\nabsorbed in the former than in the latter situation. And, in point of\r\nfact, a few plants of the present order have been found to act through\r\nthe medium of absorption, as soon as chemistry discovered their active\r\nprinciples, and thus enabled the physiologist to get rid of fallacy by\r\nusing the poison in small quantity. This principle has been proved to be\r\nin some plants a peculiar resin, in others a peculiar extractive matter,\r\nin others an oil, in others an alkaloid, and in others a neutral\r\ncrystalline matter. But in all there exists some principle or other in\r\nwhich are concentrated the poisonous properties of the plant. Some of\r\nthese principles appear to act through the medium of the blood.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, however, but many plants of the present order, as\r\nwell as their active principles, have a totally different and very\r\npeculiar action. They produce violent spreading inflammation of the\r\nsubcutaneous cellular tissue, and acute inflammation of the stomach and\r\nintestines, without entering the blood; and death is the consequence of\r\na sympathy of remote organs with the parts directly injured.\r\n\r\nAs to their forming a natural order of poisons, it is evident, that if a\r\ngeneral view be taken of their properties, they are distinguished by\r\nobvious phenomena from the three orders hitherto noticed. But if their\r\neffects on man be alone taken into account, when of course their\r\ninfluence on the external surface of the body must be left out of view,\r\nnothing will be discovered to distinguish them from several of the\r\nmetallic irritants.\r\n\r\nThe _symptoms_ occasioned in man by the irritant poisons of the\r\nvegetable kingdom, are chiefly those indicating inflammation of the\r\nvillous coat of the stomach and intestines. When taken in large doses,\r\nthey excite vomiting soon after they are swallowed; by which means the\r\npatient’s life is often saved. But sometimes, like the mineral poisons\r\nthat possess emetic properties, the vegetable acrids present a singular\r\nuncertainty in this respect: they may be retained without much\r\ninconvenience for some length of time. If this should happen, or if the\r\ndose be less, in which case vomiting may not be produced at all, or if\r\nonly part of a large dose be discharged at an early period by\r\nvomiting,—the other phenomena they give rise to are sometimes fully\r\ndeveloped. The most conspicuous symptom then is diarrhœa, more or less\r\nprofuse. The diarrhœa and vomiting are commonly attended by twisting\r\npain of the belly, at first remittent, but gradually more constant, as\r\nthe inflammation becomes more and more strongly marked. Tension, fulness\r\nand tenderness of the belly, are then not unfrequent. The stools may\r\nassume all the characters of the discharges in natural inflammation of\r\nthe intestinal mucous membrane, but an additional character worthy of\r\nnotice is the appearance of fragments of leaves or flowers belonging to\r\nthe plant which has been swallowed. At the same time there is generally\r\nexcessive weakness. Sometimes, too, giddiness and a tendency to delirium\r\nhave been observed. But the latter symptoms are rare: if they occurred\r\nfrequently, it would be necessary to transfer any poison which produced\r\nthem to the class of narcotico-acrids.\r\n\r\nThe properties now mentioned have long ago attracted the attention of\r\nphysicians, and led them to introduce many vegetable irritants into the\r\nmateria medica. In fact they comprehended a great number of the most\r\nactive, or, as they are technically called, drastic purgatives. Among\r\nothers, elaterium, euphorbium, gamboge, colocynth, scammony, croton,\r\njalap, savin, stavesacre, are of this description. The effect of most of\r\nthem, however, is so violent and uncertain, that few are now much used\r\nexcept when combined with other milder laxatives.\r\n\r\nThe _morbid appearances_ they leave in the dead body are the same with\r\nthose noticed under the head of their mode of action,—more or less\r\nredness of the stomach, ulceration of its villous coat, redness of the\r\nintestines, and especially of the rectum and colon, which are often\r\ninflamed when the small intestines are not visibly affected.\r\n\r\nIn the following account of the particular poisons of this order, a very\r\ncursory view will be taken of their physical and chemical properties. A\r\nknowledge of these properties will be best acquired from any author on\r\nthe materia medica; and an account of them would be misplaced in a work\r\nwhich professes to describe only the leading objects of the medical\r\njurist’s attention.\r\n\r\nA great number of genera might be arranged under the present head. But\r\nthe following list comprehends all which require mention. _Euphorbia_,\r\nor spurge, the _ricinus_, or castor-oil tree, the _jatropha_, or\r\ncassava-plant, croton-oil, _elaterium_, or squirting cucumber,\r\n_colocynth_, or bitter-apple, _bryony_, or wild cucumber, _ranunculus_,\r\nor buttercup, _anemone_, _stavesacre_, _celandine_, _marsh marigold_,\r\n_mezereon_, _spurge-laurel_, _savine_, _daffodil_, _jalap_,\r\n_manchineel_, _cuckow-pint_.\r\n\r\nThe first plants to be noticed belong to the natural order\r\n_Euphorbiaceæ_, namely, the euphorbia, ricinus, jatropha, and croton.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Of Poisoning with Euphorbium._\r\n\r\n_Euphorbium_ is the inspissated juice of various plants of the genus\r\neuphorbia or spurge, but is principally procured from the _E.\r\nofficinarum_, a species that abounds in Northern Africa. It contains a\r\nvariety of principles; but its chief ingredient is a resin, in which its\r\nactive properties reside. It has been analysed by Braconnot, Pelletier,\r\nBrandes,[1403] and Drs. Buchner and Herberger. According to Brandes the\r\nresin forms above 44 per cent. of the crude drug, and is so very acrid,\r\nthat the eyelid is inflamed by rubbing it with the finger which has\r\ntouched the resin, even although it be subsequently washed with an\r\nalkali.[1404] According to the most recent analysis, that of Drs.\r\nBuchner and Herberger, this resin is a compound substance, which\r\nconsists of two resinous principles, one possessing in some degree the\r\nproperties of an acid, and the other the properties of a base. The\r\nlatter, which they have called euphorbin, is considered by them the true\r\nactive principle of euphorbium.[1405] It will be mentioned under the\r\nhead of Jalap, that they have taken the same view of the nature of other\r\nresinous poisons.\r\n\r\nOrfila found that a large dog was killed in twenty-six hours and a half\r\nby half an ounce of powder of euphorbium introduced into the stomach,\r\nand retained there by a ligature on the gullet.\r\n\r\nThe whole coats of the stomach, but especially the villous membrane,\r\nwere of a deep-red or almost black colour; the colon, and still more the\r\nrectum, were of a lively red internally, and their inner membrane was\r\ncheckered with little ulcers. Two drachms of the powder thrust into a\r\nwound in the thigh, and secured by covering it with the flaps of the\r\nincision, killed a dog in twenty-seven hours; and death was preceded by\r\nno remarkable symptom except great languor. The wounded limb was found\r\nafter death highly inflamed, and the redness and sanguinolent\r\ninfiltration, which were alluded to in the general observations on the\r\nvegetable acrids, extended from the knee as high up the trunk as the\r\nfifth rib,—a striking proof of the rapidity with which this variety of\r\ninflammation diffuses itself.[1406] Mr. Blake concludes from his\r\nexperiments, that euphorbium, when injected in a state of solution in\r\nthe jugular vein, acts by obstructing both the pulmonary and systemic\r\ncapillaries, and so preventing the passage of the blood into the left\r\nside of the heart; but that the heart is not primarily acted on.[1407]\r\n\r\nThe most common symptoms occasioned in man by euphorbium are violent\r\ngriping and purging, and excessive exhaustion; but it appears probable\r\nthat narcotic symptoms are also at times induced. A case of irritant\r\npoisoning with it has been related in the Philosophical Transactions;\r\nbut it is not a pure one, as a large quantity of camphor was taken at\r\nthe same time. Much irritation was produced in the alimentary canal; but\r\nby the prompt excitement of vomiting and the subsequent use of opium the\r\npatient soon recovered.[1408] Mr. Furnival has related a fatal case\r\nwhich arose from a farrier having given a man a tea-spoonful by mistake\r\nfor rhubarb. Burning heat in the throat and then in the stomach,\r\nvomiting, irregular hurried pulse, and cold perspiration were the\r\nleading symptoms; and the person died in three days. Several gangrenous\r\nspots were found in the stomach, and its coats tore with the slightest\r\ntouch.[1409] The operation of this substance is so violent and\r\nuncertain, that it has long ceased to be employed inwardly in the\r\nregular practice of medicine, and has been even excluded from some\r\nmodern Pharmacopœias. It is still used by farriers as an external\r\napplication; and in the Infirmary of this city I met with a fatal case\r\nof poisoning in the human subject, which was supposed to have been\r\nproduced by a mixture containing it, and intended to cure horses of the\r\ngrease. Pyl has related the proceedings in a prosecution against a man\r\nfor putting powder of euphorbium into his maid-servant’s bed; and from\r\nthis narrative it appears, that, when applied to the sound skin, it\r\ncauses violent heat, itching and smarting, succeeded by inflammation and\r\nblisters.[1410] Dr. Veitch denies that the powder has any such\r\npower;[1411] but the effects described by Pyl correspond with popular\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\nProbably all the species of euphorbium possess the same properties as\r\n_E. officinarum_. Orfila found that the juice of the leaves of E.\r\n_cyparissias_ and _lathyris_ produces precisely the effects described\r\nabove. Sproegel applied the juice of the latter to his face, and was\r\nattacked in consequence with an eruption like nettle-rash; and he found\r\nthat it caused warts and hair to drop out.[1412] Vicat mentions\r\nanalogous facts, and Lamotte notices the case of a patient who died in\r\nconsequence of a clyster having been prepared with this species instead\r\nof the mercurialis.[1413] The seeds and root of the _E. lathyris_ or\r\ncaper-spurge are used by the inhabitants of the northern Alps in the\r\ndose of fifteen grains as an emetic; and very lately the oil of the\r\nseeds has been employed in Italy as an active purgative, which in the\r\ndose of two or eight grains is said to possess all the efficacy of\r\ncroton oil.[1414] MM. Chevallier and Aubergier have also found the seeds\r\nof the _E. hybeua_ and their expressed oil to be very energetic. The\r\nseeds yield 44 per cent. of oil, which in the dose of ten drops produces\r\ncopious watery evacuations without pain, and resembles closely\r\ncroton-oil in its effects.[1415] The _E. esula_ appears to be a very\r\nactive species. Scopoli says that a woman who took thirty grains of the\r\nroot died in half an hour, and that he once knew it cause fatal gangrene\r\nwhen imprudently applied to the skin of the belly.[1416] Withering\r\nobserves that all the indigenous species blister and ulcerate the skin,\r\nand that many of them are used by country people for these\r\npurposes.[1417]\r\n\r\nI have no where seen any notice taken by authors of narcotic symptoms as\r\nthe effect of poisoning with euphorbium; and indeed this substance has\r\nalways been considered a pure irritant. I am informed, however, by the\r\nMessrs. Herring, wholesale druggists in London, that their workmen are\r\nsubject to headache, giddiness and stupor, if they do not carefully\r\navoid the dust thrown up while it is ground in the mill; and that the\r\nmen themselves are familiarly acquainted with this risk. An analogous\r\nfact has likewise been communicated to me by Dr. Hood of this city,\r\nrelative to the effects of the seeds of the _E. lathyris_. A child two\r\nyears of age ate some of the seeds, and soon after vomited severely,\r\nwhich is the usual effect. Drowsiness, however, succeeded; and after a\r\nfew returns of vomiting, which were promoted by an emetic, deep sleep\r\ngradually came on, broken by convulsions, stertorous breathing and\r\nsighs. Sensibility was somewhat restored by blood-letting and the warm\r\nbath; after which the tendency to sleep was interrupted by frequent\r\nagitation and exercise in the open air. The vomiting then recurred for a\r\ntime; but the child eventually got well.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Of Poisoning with the Seeds of the Castor-Oil Tree._\r\n\r\n_Castor-oil_ at present so extensively used as a mild and effectual\r\nlaxative, is nevertheless derived from a plant hardly inferior in\r\nactivity as a poison to that just considered. It is the expressed oil of\r\nthe seeds of the _Ricinus communis_ or Palma Christi. Much discussion\r\nhas taken place as to the source of the acrid properties of this seed,\r\nsome supposing that they reside in the embryo, others in the perisperm,\r\nothers in the cotyledon, others in a principle formed from the oil by\r\nheat; and the question is scarcely yet settled. It is certain, however,\r\nthat, although castor oil owes its occasional acridity to changes\r\neffected by the heat to which it is sometimes exposed in the process of\r\nseparation, nevertheless the cotyledons are in themselves acrid.[1418]\r\n\r\nTwo or three of the seeds will operate as a violent cathartic. Bergius,\r\nas quoted by Orfila, says he knew a stout man who was attacked with\r\nprofuse vomiting and purging after having masticated a single seed.\r\nLanzoni met with an instance where three grains of the fresh seeds,\r\ntaken by a young woman, caused so violent vomiting, hiccup, pain in the\r\nstomach, and faintness, that for some time her life was considered in\r\ngreat danger.[1419] Mr. Alfred Taylor met with three cases of poisoning\r\nwith castor-oil seeds. Two sisters, who took each from two to four\r\nseeds, suffered severely; and a third, who took twenty, died in five\r\ndays, with symptoms like those of malignant cholera.[1420] Climate\r\nprobably affects their activity; for I have known a person eat without\r\nany effect several seeds ripened in the open air in this neighbourhood.\r\nDogs vomit so easily that they may take thirty seeds without material\r\ninconvenience, if the gullet is not tied. But if the gullet is secured,\r\na much less quantity will occasion death in six hours. They produce\r\nviolent inflammation when applied to a wound.[1421]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Of Poisoning with the Physic-nut._\r\n\r\nThe plants of the genus _Jatropha_, belonging to the same natural\r\nfamily, have all of them the same acrid properties as the castor-oil\r\ntree. The seeds of the _J. curcas_, the physic-nut of the West Indies,\r\nwhen applied in the form of powder to a wound, produce violent spreading\r\ninflammation of the subcutaneous cellular tissue; and when introduced\r\ninto the stomach they inflame that organ and the intestines.[1422] Four\r\nseeds will act on man as a powerful cathartic.[1423] I have known\r\nviolent vomiting and purging occasioned by a few grains of the cake,\r\nleft after expression of the fixed oil from the bruised seeds; and in\r\nsome experiments performed a few years ago, I found that twelve or\r\nfifteen drops of the oil produced exactly the same effects as an ounce\r\nof castor-oil, though not with such certainty. In the last edition of\r\nthis work some observations were made, on the authority of MM. Pelletier\r\nand Caventou, respecting the properties of a pure oil and a volatile\r\nacid, supposed by them to exist in the physic-nut; but they analyzed the\r\ncroton seed by mistake for it.\r\n\r\nTwo other species have been also examined, but not with care, namely,\r\nthe _Jatropha multifida_, and the _Jatropha_ or _Janipha manihot_. It is\r\nprobable that the seeds of both are acrid, and also the oil which may be\r\nextracted from them by pressure. But a much more interesting part of the\r\nlatter species in a toxicological point of view is the root; the juice\r\nof which is a most energetic poison. The _Janipha manihot_, or\r\ncassava-plant, has two varieties, one of which produces a small,\r\nspindle-shaped, bland root, called, in the West Indies, sweet cassava,\r\nwhile the other has a much larger, bitter, poisonous root, called bitter\r\ncassava, and in universal use for obtaining the well-known amylaceous\r\nsubstance, tapioca. The juice of the bitter variety is watery, and so\r\npoisonous that, according to Dr. Clark of Dominica, negroes have been\r\nkilled in an hour by drinking half a pint of it.[1424] It has been\r\ncommonly, but erroneously, arranged among acrid poisons. It really\r\nbelongs to the narcotic class, for it occasions coma and convulsions.\r\nAnd we now know the cause of this extraordinary anomaly in the natural\r\nfamily to which the species belongs; because MM. Henry and Boutron\r\nascertained that the juice imported into France, as well as what they\r\nexpressed from fresh roots sent from the West Indies, contains\r\nhydrocyanic acid, produces in animals all the usual effects of that\r\npoison, and is rendered inert by such means as will remove the acid,—for\r\nexample, by the addition of nitrate of silver.[1425] I confirmed this\r\nsingular discovery in 1838 by examination of some well-preserved juice\r\nfrom Demerara. It is easy to see how tapioca, which is obtained from the\r\npoisonous root by careful elutriation, becomes quite bland during the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Of Poisoning with Manchineel._\r\n\r\nThe _manchineel_ [_Hippomane mancinella_], another plant of the same\r\nnatural family, contains a milky juice, which is possessed of very acrid\r\nproperties. Orfila and Ollivier have made some careful experiments with\r\nit on animals,[1426] and M. Ricord has since added some observations on\r\nits effects on man.[1427] From the former it appears that two drachms of\r\nthe juice applied to a wound in a dog will cause death in twenty-eight\r\nhours, by exciting diffuse cellular inflammation; and that half that\r\nquantity will prove fatal in nine hours when introduced into the\r\nstomach. From the observations of M. Ricord it follows that inflammation\r\nis excited wherever the juice is applied, even in the sound skin; but he\r\ndenies the generally received notion, that similar effects ensue from\r\nsleeping under the branches of the tree, or receiving drops of moisture\r\nfrom the leaves. This notion, however, it is right to add, has been\r\nadopted by other recent authors. Descourtils, for example, states that\r\nit is dangerous to sleep under the tree; that drops of rain from the\r\nleaves will blister any part of the skin on which they fall; and that on\r\nthese accounts the police of St. Domingo were in the practice of\r\ndestroying the trees wherever they grew.[1428] Other species of\r\nHippomane are equally poisonous. The _H. biglandulosa_ and _H. spinosa_\r\nare peculiarly so, especially the latter, which is known to the negroes\r\nof St. Domingo by the name of Zombi apple, and is familiarly used by\r\nthem as a potent poison.[1429]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Of Poisoning with Croton._\r\n\r\nThe oil of the _Croton Tiglium_ has been familiarly known for some years\r\nas a very powerful hydragogue cathartic in the dose of a few drops; and\r\ntherefore little doubt could exist that both the oil and the seed which\r\nyields it must be active irritant poisons in moderate doses. Accordingly\r\nit has been lately found by experiments in Germany that forty seeds will\r\nkill a horse in the course of seven hours;[1430] and Rumphius mentions\r\nthat it was a common poison in his time at Amboyna among the natives. I\r\nhave known most violent watery purging and great prostration caused by\r\nfour drops of the expressed oil. A fatal case of poisoning with it\r\noccurred not long ago in France. A young man who swallowed two drachms\r\nand a half of the oil by mistake, instead of using it as an embrocation,\r\nwas soon seized with tenderness of the belly, violent efforts to vomit,\r\ncold sweating, laborious respiration, blueness of the lips and fingers,\r\nand an almost imperceptible pulse,—then with profuse, involuntary\r\ndischarges by stool, burning along the throat and gullet, and\r\ninsensibility of the skin;—and in four hours he expired. The villous\r\ncoat of the stomach was soft, but not otherwise injured.[1431]\r\n\r\nThe activity of the seed and oil seems to depend on a peculiar volatile\r\nacid, which was discovered by MM. Pelletier and Caventou when they\r\nanalysed the croton seed by mistake as the seed of the _Jatropha\r\ncurcas_, or physic-nut. When the oil was saponified by potash and then\r\nfreed of the acid by distillation, it became inert. On the other hand,\r\nthe acid was found by them to excite inflammation of the stomach, and\r\nspreading inflammation of the cellular tissue, according as it was\r\nadministered internally or applied to a wound.[1432]\r\n\r\nThe next natural family in which plants are to be found that possess the\r\nproperties of the acrid poisons, is the _Cucurbitaceæ_, or gourds. This\r\nfamily, it should be remarked, does not in general possess poisonous\r\nproperties. On the contrary, they are, with a few exceptions, remarkably\r\nmild; and many of them supply articles of luxury for the table. The\r\nmelon, gourd, and cucumber belong to the order. The only poisons of the\r\norder which have been examined with any care are elaterium, bryony, and\r\ncolocynth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Of Poisoning with Bryony._\r\n\r\nThe roots of the _Bryonia alba_ and _Dioica_ possesses properties\r\nessentially the same with those of euphorbium. The _B. dioica_ is a\r\nnative of Britain, where it grows among hedges, and is usually known by\r\nthe name of wild vine, or bryony. The flowers are greenish, and are\r\nsucceeded by small, red berries. The root, which is the most active part\r\nof the plant, is spindle-shaped, and varies in size from that of a man’s\r\nthigh to that of a radish.\r\n\r\nOrfila found that half an ounce of the root introduced into the stomach\r\nof a dog, killed it in twenty-four hours, when the gullet was tied; and\r\nthat two drachms and a half applied to a wound brought on violent\r\ninflammation and suppuration of the part, ending fatally in sixty\r\nhours.[1433]\r\n\r\nBryony root owes its power to an extractive matter discovered in it by\r\nBrandes and Firnhaber, to which the name of Bryonine has been given.\r\nAccording to the experiments of Collard de Martigny, bryonine acts on\r\nthe stomach and on a wound exactly as the root itself, but more\r\nenergetically. When introduced into the cavity of the pleura it causes\r\nrapid death by true pleurisy, ending in the effusion of fibrin.[1434]\r\n\r\nBefore bryony-root was expelled from medical practice, it was often\r\nknown to produce violent vomiting, tormina, profuse watery evacuations,\r\nand fainting. Pyl mentions a fatal case of poisoning with it, which\r\nhappened at Cambray in France. The subject was a man who took two\r\nglasses of an infusion of the root to cure ague, and was soon after\r\nseized with violent tormina and purging, which nothing could arrest, and\r\nwhich soon terminated fatally.[1435] Orfila quotes a similar case from\r\nthe Gazette de Santé, which proved fatal within four hours, in\r\nconsequence of a strong decoction of an ounce of the root having been\r\nadministered, partly by the mouth and partly in a clyster, to repel the\r\nsecretion of milk.[1436]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Of Poisoning with Colocynth._\r\n\r\nColocynth, or bitter-apple, is another very active and more common acrid\r\nderived from a plant of the same family, the Cucumis colocynthis. It is\r\nimported into this country in the form of a roundish, dry, light fruit,\r\nas big as an orange, of a yellowish-white colour, and excessively bitter\r\ntaste. Its active principle is probably a resinoid matter discovered by\r\nVauquelin, which is very soluble in alcohol and sparingly so in water,\r\nbut which imparts even to the latter an intensely bitter taste.[1437] It\r\nis termed Colocynthin.\r\n\r\nAccording to the experiments of Orfila, colocynth powder or its\r\ndecoction produces the usual effects of the acrid vegetables on the\r\nstomach and on the subcutaneous cellular tissue. Three drachms proved\r\nfatal in fifteen hours to a dog through the former channel when the\r\ngullet was tied, and two drachms killed another when applied to a\r\nwound.[1438]\r\n\r\nA considerable number of severe cases of poisoning with this substance\r\nhave occurred in the human subject; and a few have proved fatal. Tulpius\r\nnotices the case of a man who was nearly carried off by profuse, bloody\r\ndiarrhœa, in consequence of taking a decoction of three colocynth\r\napples.[1439] Orfila relates that of a rag-picker, who, attempting to\r\ncure himself of a gonorrhœa by taking three ounces of colocynth, was\r\nseized with vomiting, acute pain in the stomach, profuse diarrhœa,\r\ndimness of sight, and slight delirium; but he recovered under the use of\r\ndiluents and local blood-letting.[1440] In 1823 a coroner’s inquest was\r\nheld at London on the body of a woman who died in twenty-four hours,\r\nwith incessant vomiting and purging, in consequence of having swallowed\r\nby mistake a tea-spoonful and a half of colocynth powder.[1441] M.\r\nCarron d’Annecy has communicated to Orfila the details of an instructive\r\ncase, which also proved fatal. The subject was a locksmith, who took\r\nfrom a quack two glasses of decoction of colocynth to cure hemorrhoids,\r\nand was soon after attacked with colic, purging, heat in the belly, and\r\ndryness of the throat. Afterwards the belly became tense and excessively\r\ntender, and the stools were suppressed altogether. Next morning he had\r\nalso retention of urine, retraction of the testicles and priapism. On\r\nthe third day the retention ceased, but the other symptoms continued,\r\nand the skin became covered with clammy sweat, which preceded his death\r\nonly a few hours. The intestines were red, studded with black spots, and\r\nmatted together by fibrinous matter; the usual fluid of peritonitis was\r\neffused into the belly; the villous coat of the stomach was here and\r\nthere ulcerated; and the liver, kidneys, and bladder also exhibited\r\ntraces of inflammation.[1442]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Of Poisoning with Elaterium._\r\n\r\nElaterium, which is procured from a third plant of the cucurbitaceæ, the\r\n_Momordica elaterium_ or squirting cucumber, possesses precisely the\r\nsame properties with the two preceding substances. It appears, however,\r\nto be more active; for a single grain has been known to act violently on\r\nman. There can be no doubt that small doses will prove fatal; but its\r\nstrength and consequently its effects are uncertain. British elaterium,\r\nwhich is the feculence that subsides in the juice of the fruit, is the\r\nmost powerful; French elaterium, which is the extract of the same juice,\r\nis much weaker; and a still weaker preparation sometimes made is an\r\nextract of the juice of the whole plant. The plant itself is probably\r\npoisonous. But the only case in point with which I am acquainted is a\r\nsingular instance of poisoning, apparently produced in consequence of\r\nthe plant having been carried for some time betwixt the hat and head. A\r\nmedical gentleman in Paris, after carrying a specimen to his lodgings in\r\nhis hat, was seized in half an hour with acute pain and sense of\r\ntightness in the head, succeeded by colic pains, fixed pain in the\r\nstomach, frequent watery purging, bilious vomiting, and some fever.\r\nThese symptoms continued upwards of twelve hours.[1443]\r\n\r\nThe active properties of this substance reside in a peculiar crystalline\r\nprinciple, discovered by Mr. Morries-Stirling, and named by him\r\n_Elaterine_. It is procured by evaporating the alcoholic infusion of\r\nelaterium to the consistence of thin oil, and throwing it into boiling\r\ndistilled water; upon which a white crystalline precipitate is formed,\r\nand more falls down as the water cools. This precipitate when purified\r\nby a second solution in alcohol and precipitation by water, is pure\r\nelaterine. In mass it has a silky appearance. The crystals are\r\nmicroscopic rhombic prisms, striated on the sides. It is intensely\r\nbitter. It does not dissolve in the alkalis, or in water, is sparingly\r\nsoluble in diluted acids, but easily soluble in alcohol, ether, and\r\nfixed oil. It has not any alkaline reaction on litmus.—It is a poison of\r\nvery great activity. A tenth of a grain, as I have myself witnessed,\r\nwill sometimes cause purging in man; and a fifth of a grain in two\r\ndoses, administered at an interval of twenty-four hours to a rabbit,\r\nkilled it seventeen hours after the second dose. The best British\r\nelaterium contains 26 per cent. of it, the worst 15 per cent.; but\r\nFrench elaterium does not contain above 5 or 6 per cent.[1444] These\r\nfacts account for the great irregularity in the effects of this drug as\r\na cathartic. The principle discovered by Mr. Morries-Stirling was also\r\ndiscovered about the same time by Mr. Hennell[1445] of London.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Of Poisoning with the Ranunculaceæ._\r\n\r\nThe natural family of the Ranunculaceæ abounds in acrid poisons. Indeed\r\nfew of the genera included in it are without more or less acrid\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Ranunculus_ is of some interest to the British toxicologist,\r\nbecause many species grow in this country, and unpleasant accidents have\r\nbeen occasioned by them. The most common are the _R. bulbosus_, _acris_,\r\n_sceleratus_, _Flammula_, _Lingua_, _aquatilis_, _repens_, _Ficaria_,\r\nwhich are all abundant in the neighbourhood of this city. The\r\n_Ranunculus acris_ is the only species that has been particularly\r\nexamined. Five ounces of juice, extracted by triturating the leaves with\r\ntwo ounces of water, killed a stout dog in twelve hours when taken\r\ninternally. Two drachms of the aqueous extract applied to a wound killed\r\nanother in twelve hours by inducing the usual inflammation.[1446]\r\n\r\nKrapf, as quoted in Orfila’s Toxicology, found by experiments on\r\nhimself, that two drops of the expressed juice of the _Ranunculus acris_\r\nproduced burning pain and spasms in the gullet and griping in the lower\r\nbelly. A single flower had the same effect. When he chewed the thickest\r\nand most succulent of the leaves, the salivary glands were strongly\r\nstimulated, his tongue was excoriated and cracked, his teeth smarted,\r\nand his gums became tender and bloody.[1447] Dr. Withering alleges that\r\nit will blister the skin. A man at Bevay in the north of France, after\r\nswallowing by mistake a glassful of the juice which had been kept for\r\nsome time as a remedy for vermin on the head, was seized in four hours\r\nwith violent vomiting and colic, and expired in two days.[1448] The\r\nacridity of the genus ranunculus is entirely lost by drying, either with\r\nor without artificial heat. The _R. acris_, however, is far from being\r\nthe most active species of the genus. The taste of the leaves of _R.\r\nbulbosus_, _alpestris_, _gramineus_, and _Flammula_, and also of the\r\nunripe germens of _R. sceleratus_, is much more pungent. The _R.\r\nrepens_, _Ficaria_, _auricomus_, _aquatilis_, and _Lingua_, I have found\r\nto be bland.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Anemone_ produces similar effects on the animal economy. The\r\nmost pungent species I have examined are the _A. pulsatilla_, _A.\r\nhortensis_, and _A. coronaria_; the _A. nemorosa_ and _A. patens_ are\r\nless active; and the _A. hepatica_, as well as the _A. alpestris_, are\r\nbland. The powder of the _A. pulsatilla_ causes itching of the eyes,\r\ncolic and vomiting, if in pulverizing it the operator do not avoid the\r\nfine dust which is driven up; and Bulliard relates the case of a man\r\nwho, in applying the bruised root to his calf for rheumatism, was\r\nattacked with inflammation and gangrene of the whole leg.[1449] The same\r\nauthor mentions an instance where violent convulsions were produced by\r\nan infusion of the _A. nemorosa_, and the person was for some time\r\nthought to be in great danger.[1450] The acridity of the anemone is\r\nretained under desiccation even in the vapour-bath; but is very slowly\r\nlost under exposure to the air, not entirely, however, in two months.\r\nThe ripe fruit of the _A. hortensis_ is bland. The activity of the\r\nanemones is owing to a volatile oil, which, when left for some time in\r\nthe water with which it passes over in distillation is converted into a\r\nneutral crystalline body called anemonine, and a peculiar acid termed\r\nanemonic acid.[1451]\r\n\r\nThe _Caltha palustris_, or marsh marigold, a plant closely allied in\r\nexternal characters to the ranunculus, is considered by toxicologists a\r\npowerful acrid poison. Wibmer observes that it has an acrid, burning\r\ntaste,[1452]—a remark which has been also made by Haller.[1453] On the\r\ncontinent the flower buds are said to be sometimes pickled and used for\r\ncapers on account of their pungency. The following set of cases which\r\nhappened in 1817 near Solingen will show that in some localities it\r\npossesses energetic and singular properties. The poison was taken\r\naccidentally by a family of five persons, in consequence of their having\r\nbeen compelled by the badness of the times to try to make food of\r\nvarious herbs. They were all seized half an hour after eating with\r\nsickness, pain in the abdomen, vomiting, headache, and ringing in the\r\nears, afterwards with dysuria and diarrhœa, next day with œdema of the\r\nwhole body, particularly of the face, and on the third day with an\r\neruption of pemphigous vesicles as large as almonds, which dried up in\r\nforty-eight hours. They all recovered.[1454]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these apparently pointed facts, however, I have no doubt\r\nthat the marsh marigold is in some circumstances bland, and is commonly\r\nso in this country, or at least but feebly poisonous. Haller, in\r\nspeaking of its acrid taste, adds that when young it is eaten with\r\nsafety by goats. For my own part I have never been able to remark any\r\ndistinct acridity in tasting it either before inflorescence, or in the\r\nyoung flower-buds, or in any part of the plant while in full flower. It\r\nproduces a peculiar, disagreeable impression on the back of the tongue,\r\nwhen collected in dry situations; but never occasions that pungent\r\nacridity which so remarkably characterizes many species of ranunculus,\r\nanemone, and clematis.\r\n\r\nThe _stavesacre_, or _Delphinium staphysagria_, another plant of the\r\nsame natural family, is interesting in a scientific point of view,\r\nbecause its properties have been distinctly traced to a peculiar\r\nalkaloid. The seeds, which alone have been hitherto examined, were\r\nanalyzed by MM. Lassaigne and Feneulle, who, besides a number of inert\r\nprinciples, discovered in them an alkaloid, possessing in an eminent\r\ndegree the poisonous qualities of the seeds. This alkaloid is solid,\r\nwhite, pulverulent but crystalline, fusible like wax, very bitter and\r\nacrid, almost insoluble in water, very soluble in ether and alcohol, and\r\ncapable of forming salts with most of the acids.[1455] It has been named\r\n_delphinia_. It was also discovered about the same time by\r\nBrandes.[1456]\r\n\r\nOrfila found that six grains of it diffused through water, introduced\r\ninto the stomach of a dog and retained there with a ligature on the\r\ngullet, brought on efforts to vomit, restlessness, giddiness,\r\nimmobility, slight convulsions, and death in two or three hours. The\r\nsame quantity, if previously dissolved in vinegar, will cause death in\r\nforty minutes. In the former case, but not in the latter, the inner coat\r\nof the stomach is found to be generally red.[1457]\r\n\r\nAn ounce of the bruised seeds themselves killed a dog in fifty-four\r\nhours when introduced into the stomach, and two drachms applied to a\r\nwound in the thigh killed another in two days. In the former animal a\r\npart of the stomach was crimson-red; in the latter there was extensive\r\nsubcutaneous inflammation reaching as high as the fourth rib.[1458]\r\n\r\nBesides these four genera of the ranunculaceæ many other genera of the\r\nsame natural order are equally energetic. The _Clematis vitalba_ or\r\ntraveller’s-joy is said to be acrid, but does not taste so: the _C.\r\nflammula_, however, is pungently acrid to the taste; it reddens and\r\nblisters the skin; and when swallowed excites inflammation in the\r\nstomach. The _trollius_ or globe flower is also considered acrid; and\r\nits root in appearance, smell, and taste, has been said to resemble\r\nclosely that of the black hellebore. The herb, however, in Scotland, has\r\ncertainly none of the peculiar acrid pungency of the ranunculus,\r\nanemone, or clematis, but is on the contrary bland. Some other genera of\r\nequal power have been usually arranged with the narcotico-acrid poisons\r\non account of their action on the nervous system; and probably some of\r\nthe present group of acrids might with equal propriety be removed to the\r\nsame class.\r\n\r\nOf plants possessing acrid properties and interspersed throughout other\r\nnatural families, the only species I shall particularly notice are the\r\nmezereon, cuckow-pint, gamboge, daffodil, jalap-plant, and savine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Of Poisoning with Mezereon._\r\n\r\nThe _mezereon_ and several other species of the genus Daphne to which it\r\nbelongs are powerfully acrid. They belong to the natural order Thymeleæ.\r\nThe active properties of the bark of mezereon have been traced to a very\r\nacrid resin; and those of the allied species, _Daphne alpina_, to a\r\nvolatile, acrid acid.[1459]\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Orfila have been confined to a foreign species, the\r\n_D. Gnidium_ or _garou_ of the French. Three drachms of the powder of\r\nits bark retained in the stomach of a dog killed it in twelve hours; and\r\ntwo drachms applied to a wound killed another in two days.[1460] The\r\naction of the other species has not been so scientifically investigated;\r\nbut fatal accidents have arisen from them when taken by the human\r\nspecies. Children have been tempted to eat the berries of the _D.\r\nmezereon_ by their singular beauty; and some have died in consequence.\r\nThree such cases, not fatal, have been related by Dr. Grieve of\r\nDumfries. Two of the children had violent vomiting and purging: in the\r\nthird narcotic symptoms came on in five hours, namely, great drowsiness,\r\ndilatation of the pupils, extreme slowness of the pulse, retarded\r\nrespiration, and freedom from pain.[1461] Vicat relates the case of a\r\nman who took the wood of it for dropsy, and was attacked with profuse\r\ndiarrhœa and obstinate vomiting, the last of which symptoms recurred\r\noccasionally for six weeks.[1462] A fatal case, in a child about eight\r\nyears of age, occurred a few years ago in this city. Linnæus in his\r\n_Flora Suecica_ says that six berries will kill a wolf, and that he once\r\nsaw a girl die of excessive vomiting and hæmoptysis, in consequence of\r\ntaking twelve of them to check an ague.[1463] The _D. laureola_ or\r\nspurge-laurel, a common indigenous species, abounding in low woods, is\r\nsaid by Withering to be very acrid, especially its root.[1464]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Of Poisoning with Cuckow-pint._\r\n\r\nThe _Arum maculatum_, or cuckow-pint, one of our earliest spring\r\nflowers, not uncommon in moist ground, under the shelter of woods, is\r\none of the most violent of all acrid vegetables inhabiting this country.\r\nI have known acute burning pain of the mouth and throat, pain of the\r\nstomach and vomiting, colic and some diarrhœa, occasioned by eating two\r\nleaves. The genus possesses the same properties in other climates, the\r\nseveral species being everywhere among the most potent acrid poisons in\r\ntheir respective regions. The _Arum seguinum_, or dumb cane of the West\r\nIndies, is so active that two drachms of the juice have been known to\r\nprove fatal in a few hours.[1465] It is not a little remarkable that the\r\nacridity of the arum is lost not merely by drying, but likewise by\r\ndistillation. I have observed that when the roots are distilled with a\r\nlittle water, neither the distilled water nor the residuum possesses\r\nacridity. Reinsch says he has eaten powder of arum root, which, though\r\nnot acrid to the taste, produced severe burning of the throat not long\r\nafter it was swallowed.[1466]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Of Poisoning with Gamboge._\r\n\r\nThe familiar pigment and purgative _gamboge_ is one of the pure acrids,\r\nand possesses considerable activity. It appears from the researches of\r\nOrfila,[1467] some experiments by Schubarth,[1468] and various earlier\r\ninquiries quoted by Wibmer,[1469] that two drachms will kill a sheep;\r\nthat a drachm and a half will kill a dog if retained by a ligature on\r\nthe gullet, while much larger doses have little effect without this\r\nprecaution, as the poison is soon vomited; that an ounce has little\r\neffect on the horse; that eighteen grains will prove fatal to the rabbit\r\nwithin twenty-four hours; and that the symptoms are such as chiefly\r\nindicate an irritant action. Orfila farther found that it produces\r\nintense spreading inflammation when applied to a recent wound, and in\r\nthis way may occasion death as quickly and with as great certainty as\r\nwhen administered internally.\r\n\r\nGamboge in its action on man is well known to be one of the most certain\r\nand active of the drastic cathartics, from three to seven grains being\r\nsufficient to cause copious watery diarrhœa, commonly with smart colic.\r\nLarger doses will induce hypercatharsis. A drachm has proved fatal, as\r\nis exemplified by a case in the German Ephemerides where the symptoms\r\nwere excessive vomiting, purging, and faintness.[1470]\r\n\r\nUnder this head are probably to be arranged the repeated cases, which\r\nhave lately occurred in this country, of fatal poisoning with a noted\r\nquack nostrum, Morison’s pills. Almost every physician in extensive\r\npractice has met with cases of violent hypercatharsis occasioned by the\r\nincautious use of these pills; and three instances are now on record\r\nwhere death was clearly occasioned by them.[1471] No toxicologist will\r\nfeel any surprise at such results, when he learns that one sort\r\ncontains, besides aloes and colocynth, half a grain of gamboge, and\r\nanother three times as much, in each pill; and that ten, fifteen, or\r\neven twenty pills are sometimes taken for a dose once or oftener in the\r\ncourse of the day.[1472] The symptoms in the cases alluded to were\r\nsickness, vomiting and watery purging, pain, tension, fulness,\r\ntenderness, and heat in the abdomen, with cold extremities and sinking\r\npulse; and in the dead body the appearances were great redness of the\r\nstomach with softening of its villous coat, in the intestines softening\r\nand slate-gray coloration of the same coat, and in one instance\r\nintestinal ulceration.\r\n\r\nGamboge is one of the poisons whose energy seems to be irregularly\r\nmodified by the co-existence of certain constitutional states in\r\ndisease. Physicians in Britain cannot but be startled to hear of the\r\npractice, prevailing among the followers of Rasori in Italy, of\r\nadministering this purgative in doses of a drachm and upwards in\r\ninflammatory diseases. But it is nevertheless undeniable, that it has\r\nbeen given to that extent in such circumstances, with no further\r\nconsequence than brisk purging. Professor Linoli mentions two cases of\r\ninflammatory dropsy, in which he gave gamboge-powder in gradually\r\nincreasing doses, till he reached in one instance an entire drachm, and\r\nin the other 86 grains. In the course of a month one of his patients got\r\n1044 grains, and the other took 850 grains in twelve days. Both\r\nrecovered from their dropsy, and the purging was never great.[1473]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Of Poisoning with Daffodil._\r\n\r\nThe common _daffodil_, the _Narcissus pseudo-narcissus_ of botanists,\r\nthough commonly arranged with the vegetable acrids, seems not entitled\r\nto a place among them. At least the experiments of Orfila rather tend to\r\nshow that it acts through absorption on the nervous system. Four drachms\r\nof the aqueous extract of this plant secured in the stomach in the usual\r\nway killed a dog in less than twenty-four hours; and one drachm applied\r\nto a wound killed another in six hours. In both cases vomiting or\r\nefforts to vomit seemed the only symptom of note; and in both the\r\nstomach was found here and there cherry-red. The wound was not much\r\ninflamed.[1474]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Of Poisoning with Jalap._\r\n\r\n_Jalap_, the powder of the root of the _Ipomæa purga_, and a common\r\npurgative, is an active poison in large doses; and this every one should\r\nknow, as severe and even dangerous effects have followed its incautious\r\nuse in the hands of the practical joker. Its active properties reside in\r\na particular resinous principle. It contains a tenth of its weight of\r\nmixed resin, which, like the resin of euphorbium, has been separated by\r\nDrs. Buchner and Herberger into two, one possessing some of the\r\nproperties of acids, the other some of the properties of bases; and the\r\nlatter they consider the active principle, and have accordingly named\r\nJalapine.[1475] Mr. Hume of London some time ago procured from the crude\r\ndrug a powdery substance, to which he gave the same name, and which he\r\nconceived to be the active principle. His analysis has not been\r\ngenerally relied on by chemists; but it is not improbable that his\r\nprinciple differs little from that of the German chemists.\r\n\r\nThe action of jalap has been examined scientifically by M. Felix Cadet\r\nde Gassicourt, who found that it produced no particular symptom when\r\ninjected into the jugular vein of a dog in the dose of twenty-four\r\ngrains, or when applied to the cellular tissue in the dose of a drachm.\r\nBut when rubbed daily into the skin of the belly and thighs it excited\r\nin a few days severe dysentery; when introduced into the pleura it\r\nexcited pleurisy, fatal in three days; when introduced into the\r\nperitonæum it caused peritonitis and violent dysentery, fatal in six\r\ndays; and when introduced into the stomach or the anus, the animals died\r\nof profuse purging in four or five days, and the stomach and intestines\r\nwere then found red and sometimes ulcerated. Two drachms administered by\r\nthe mouth proved fatal.[1476] _Scammony_, which is procured from another\r\nspecies of the same family, the _Convolvulus scammonea_, has been found\r\nby Orfila to be much less active. Four drachms given to dogs produced\r\nonly diarrhœa.[1477]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Of Poisoning with Savin._\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the _Juniperus sabina_, or savin, have been long known to\r\nbe poisonous. They have a peculiar heavy, rather disagreeable odour, and\r\na bitter, acrid, aromatic, somewhat resinous taste. They yield an\r\nessential oil, which possesses all their qualities in an eminent degree.\r\n\r\nA dog was killed by six drachms of the powdered leaves confined in the\r\nstomach. It appeared to suffer pain, died in sixteen hours, and\r\nexhibited on dissection only trivial redness of the stomach. Two drachms\r\nintroduced into a wound of the thigh caused death after the manner of\r\nthe other vegetable acrids in two days; and besides inflammation of the\r\nlimb there was found redness of the rectum.[1478]\r\n\r\nSavin is a good deal used in medicine for stimulating old ulcers and\r\nkeeping open blistered surfaces; which may be done without danger,\r\nalthough it cannot be applied to a fresh wound without risk of diffuse\r\ninflammation. Both the powder and the essential oil are of some\r\nconsequence in a medico-legal point of view, as they have been often\r\nused with the intent of procuring abortion. The oil is generally\r\nbelieved by the vulgar to possess this property in a peculiar degree.\r\nDoubts, however, may be entertained whether any such property exists\r\nindependently of its operation as a violent acrid on the bowels. It has\r\ncertainly been taken to a considerable amount without the intended\r\neffect; of which Foderé has noticed an unequivocal example. The woman\r\ntook daily for twenty days no less than a hundred drops of the oil, yet\r\ncarried her child to the full time.[1479] The powder has likewise been\r\ntaken to a large extent without avail. A female, whose case is noticed\r\nby Foderé, took without her knowledge so much of the powder that she was\r\nattacked with vomiting, hiccup, heat in the lower belly, and fever of a\r\nfortnight’s duration; nevertheless she was not delivered till the\r\nnatural time.[1480] There is no doubt, however, that if given in such\r\nquantity as to cause violent purging, abortion may ensue; but unless\r\nthere is naturally a predisposition to miscarriage, the constitutional\r\ninjury and intestinal irritation required to induce it are so great, as\r\nto be always attended with extreme danger, independent of the uterine\r\ndisorder. Of this train of effects the following case, for which I am\r\nindebted to Mr. Cockson of Macclesfield, is a good illustration. A\r\nfemale applied to a pedlar to supply her with the means of getting rid\r\nof her pregnancy: and under his direction appears to have taken a large\r\nquantity of a strong infusion of savin-leaves on a Friday morning and\r\nagain next morning. A very imperfect account was obtained of the\r\nsymptoms, as no medical man witnessed them; but it was ascertained that\r\nshe had violent pain in the belly and distressing strangury. On the\r\nSunday afternoon she miscarried; and on the ensuing Thursday she died.\r\nMr. Cockson, who examined the body next day, found extensive peritonæal\r\ninflammation unequivocally indicated by the effusion of fibrinous\r\nflakes,—the uterus presenting all the signs of recent delivery,—the\r\ninside of the stomach of a red tint, checkered with patches of florid\r\nextravasation,—and its contents of a greenish colour, owing evidently to\r\nthe presence of a vegetable powder, as was proved by separating and\r\nexamining it with the microscope. My colleague Dr. Traill has\r\ncommunicated to me the particulars of a similar case. A servant-girl,\r\nafter being for some time in low spirits, was seized with violent colic\r\npains, frequent vomiting, straining at stool, tenderness of the belly,\r\ndysuria and general fever; under which symptoms she died after several\r\ndays of suffering. The stomach was inflamed, in parts black, and at the\r\nlower curvature perforated. The uterus with its appendages was very red,\r\nand contained a fine _membrana decidua_, but no ovum. The lower\r\nintestines were inflamed. There was found in the stomach a greenish\r\npowder, which, when washed and dried, had the taste of savin.\r\n\r\nA singular case is quoted by Wibmer of a woman who died from taking an\r\ninfusion of the herb for the purpose of procuring miscarriage, and in\r\nwhom death seems to have been occasioned by the gall-bladder bursting in\r\nconsequence of the violent fits of vomiting.[1481]\r\n\r\nIn a charge of wilful abortion the mere possession of oil of savin would\r\nbe a suspicious circumstance, because the notion that it has the power\r\nof causing miscarriage is very general among the vulgar; while it is\r\nscarcely employed by them for any useful purpose. The leaves in the form\r\nof infusion are in some parts of England a popular remedy for worms; and\r\nthe oil is used in regular medicine as an emmenagogue.\r\n\r\nThe following list includes all the other plants which have been either\r\nascertained experimentally to belong to the present order, or are\r\nbelieved on good general evidence to possess the same or analogous\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nBy careful experiment Orfila has ascertained that the Gratiola\r\nofficinalis, Rhus radicans and Rhus toxicodendron, Chelidonium majus and\r\nSedum acre, possess them; and the following species are also generally\r\nconsidered acrid, namely, Rhododendron chrysanthum and ferrugineum,\r\nPedicularis palustris, Cyclamen Europæum, Plumbago Europæa, Pastinaca\r\nsativa, Lobelia syphilitica and longiflora, Hydrocotyle vulgaris. To\r\nthese may be added the common elder or Sambucus nigra, the leaves and\r\nflowers of which caused in a boy, once a patient of mine, dangerous\r\ninflammation of the mucous membrane of the bowels lasting for eight\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n                     OF POISONING WITH CANTHARIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second group of the present Order of poisons comprehends most of\r\nthose derived from the animal kingdom. In action they resemble\r\nconsiderably the vegetable acrids, their most characteristic effect\r\nbeing local inflammation; but several of them also induce symptoms of an\r\ninjury of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nThis group includes cantharides, poisonous fishes, venomous serpents,\r\nand decayed or diseased animal matter.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is familiarly known as a poison even to the common\r\npeople. I am not aware that it has ever been used for the purpose of\r\ncommitting murder. But on account of its powerful effect on the organs\r\nof generation it has often been given by way of joke, and sometimes\r\ntaken for the purpose of procuring abortion. Fatal accidents have been\r\nthe consequence.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the fly is well known. When in powder, as generally\r\nseen, it has a grayish-green colour, mingled with brilliant green\r\npoints. It has a nauseous odour and a very acrid burning taste. Alcohol\r\ndissolves its active principle. This principle appears from a careful\r\nanalysis by M. Robiquet to be a white, crystalline, scaly substance,\r\ninsoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol as well as in oils, and\r\ntermed cantharidin.[1482]\r\n\r\nIn compound mixtures cantharides may generally be detected by the green\r\ncolour and metallic brilliancy even of its finest powder, if examined in\r\nthe sunshine—and sometimes by making an etherial extract of the\r\nsuspected matter, and producing with this extract the usual effects of a\r\nblister on a tender part of the arm. By these two tests Barruel\r\ndiscovered cantharides in chocolate cakes, part of which had been\r\nwickedly administered to various individuals.\r\n\r\nFrom the late important researches of M. Poumet[1483] it appears, that\r\ncantharides cannot be detected by its chemical properties in the\r\ncontents, or on the inner surface, of the alimentary canal of animals\r\npoisoned with it; and that in such circumstances it is seldom to be\r\ndiscerned even by the shining green colour of its particles, unless the\r\nmatter to be examined be dried. The method he recommends for a\r\nmedico-legal investigation is to detach the stomach, small intestines,\r\nand great intestines, each separately from the body,—to wash out their\r\ncontents with rectified spirit, and dry the pulpy fluid on sheets of\r\nglass,—to dry the stomach and intestines by distending them, removing\r\ntheir mesentery, and hanging them up vertically with a weight attached\r\nto stretch them,—and then to examine both the surface of the glass, and\r\nthe inside of the stomach and intestines with the aid of sunshine or a\r\nbright artificial light. In this way cantharides may be detected, by the\r\npeculiar green hue of its powder, in most cases where this poison may\r\nhave proved fatal; for M. Poumet constantly found it in dogs. The same\r\nauthor ascertained that the green particles generally abound most in the\r\ncontents of the great intestine or on its inner membrane, next in the\r\nsmall intestines, and least of all in the stomach; and that they may be\r\nseen in the bodies of animals at least seven months after interment.\r\nOrfila had previously ascertained, that cantharides powder may be\r\nrecognized by its brilliancy in various organic mixtures after interment\r\nfor nine months.[1484] Poumet farther states that the green particles of\r\ncantharides may be confounded with the particles of other coleopterous\r\ninsects, and also somewhat resemble particles of copper and tin. But he\r\nwith reason asks, what possible accident could introduce the powder of\r\nany other coleopterous insect into the alimentary canal? And as to\r\nparticles of copper or tin, he ascertained, that, unlike cantharides,\r\nthese substances are visible in the contents, or on the tissues, of the\r\nstomach and intestines only before desiccation, and never after it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.—_Of the Action of Cantharides and the Symptoms it excites in\r\n                                 Man._\r\n\r\nCantharides, either in the form of powder, tincture, or oily solution,\r\nis an active poison both to man and animals. As to its action on\r\nanimals, Orfila found that a drachm and a half of a strong oleaginous\r\nsolution, injected into the jugular vein of a dog, killed it in four\r\nhours with symptoms of violent tetanus; that three drachms of the\r\ntincture with eight grains of powder suspended in it caused death in\r\ntwenty-four hours, if retained in the stomach by a ligature on the\r\ngullet,—insensibility being then the chief symptom; and that forty\r\ngrains of the powder killed another dog in four hours and a half,\r\nalthough he was allowed to vomit. In all the instances in which it was\r\nadministered by the stomach, that organ was found much inflamed after\r\ndeath; and generally fragments of the poison were discernible if it was\r\ngiven in the form of powder. When applied to a wound the powder excites\r\nsurrounding inflammation; and a drachm will in this way prove fatal in\r\nthirty-two hours without any particular constitutional symptom except\r\nlanguor.[1485] M. Poumet has since obtained results not materially\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nThese experiments do not furnish any satisfactory proof of the\r\nabsorption of the poison, but rather tend to show that it does not enter\r\nthe blood. Such a conclusion, however, must not be too hastily drawn;\r\nsince its well-known effects on man when used in the form of a blister\r\nlead to the conclusion that it is absorbed, and that it produces its\r\npeculiar effect on the urinary system through the medium of the\r\ncirculation. On account of the magnitude of the dose required to produce\r\nsevere effects on animals, Orfila’s experiments on the stomach and\r\nexternal surface of the body cannot, for reasons formerly assigned (452)\r\nbe properly compared together.\r\n\r\nThe effect of cantharides, when admitted directly into the blood, seems\r\nmuch less than might be expected. Mr. Blake found that an infusion of\r\ntwo drachms injected into the jugular vein of a dog, caused some\r\ndifficulty of breathing, irregularity of the pulse, and diminished\r\narterial pressure, but apparently no great inconvenience to the\r\nanimal.[1486] The greater effect observed in Orfila’s experiment was\r\nprobably owing to obstruction of the pulmonary capillaries by the oil.\r\n\r\nOrfila has examined with care not only the preparations of cantharides\r\nalready mentioned, but likewise the various principles procured by M.\r\nRobiquet during his analysis; and it appears to result, that the active\r\nproperties of the fly reside partly in the crystalline principle, and\r\npartly in a volatile oil, which is the source of its nauseous odour.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms produced by cantharides in man are more remarkable than\r\nthose observed in animals. A great number of cases are on record; but\r\nfew have been minutely related. Sometimes it has been swallowed for the\r\npurpose of self-destruction, sometimes for procuring miscarriage. But\r\nmost frequently, on account of a prevalent notion that it possesses\r\naphrodisiac properties, it has been both voluntarily swallowed and\r\nsecretly administered, to excite the venereal appetite. That it has this\r\neffect in many instances cannot be doubted. But the old stories, which\r\nhave been the cause of its being so frequently used for the purpose, are\r\nmany of them fabulous, and all exaggerated. Often no venereal appetite\r\nis excited, sometimes even no affection of the urinary or genital organs\r\nat all; and the kidneys and bladder may be powerfully affected without\r\nthe genital organs participating. It is established, too, by frequent\r\nobservation, that the excitement of the genital organs can never be\r\ninduced, without other violent constitutional symptoms being also\r\nbrought on, to the great hazard of life.\r\n\r\nThe following abstract of a case by M. Biett of Paris gives a rational\r\nand unexaggerated account of the symptoms as they commonly appear. A\r\nyoung man, in consequence of a trick of his companions, took a drachm of\r\nthe powder. Soon afterwards he was seized with a sense of burning in the\r\nthroat and stomach; and in about an hour with violent pain in the lower\r\nbelly. When M. Biett saw him, his voice was feeble, breathing laborious,\r\nand pulse contracted; and he had excessive thirst, but could not swallow\r\nany liquid without unutterable anguish. He was likewise affected with\r\npriapism. The pain then became more extensive and severe, tenesmus and\r\nstrangury were added to the symptoms, and after violent efforts he\r\nsucceeded in passing by the anus and urethra only a few drops of blood.\r\nBy the use of oily injections into the anus and bladder, together with a\r\nvariety of other remedies intended to allay the general irritation of\r\nthe mucous membranes, he was considerably relieved before the second\r\nday; but even then he continued to complain of great heat along the\r\nwhole course of the alimentary canal, occasionally priapism, and\r\ndifficult micturition. For some months he laboured under difficulty of\r\nswallowing.[1487]—Another case very similar in its circumstances has\r\nbeen related by M. Rouquayrol. In addition to the symptoms observed in\r\nBiett’s patient there was much salivation, and towards the close of the\r\nsecond day a large cylindrical mass, apparently the inner membrane of\r\nthe gullet, was discharged by vomiting.[1488]—A case of the same kind,\r\nbut less severe, is related in the Medical Gazette. A woman, who had\r\ntaken an ounce of the tincture, was observed throughout the day to be\r\napparently intoxicated. Next morning, when she for the first time told\r\nwhat she had done, she had excruciating pain, great tenderness and\r\ndistension of the belly, a flushed anxious countenance, a dry, pale\r\ntongue, a natural pulse, and urine loaded with sediment and fibrinous\r\nmatter. In the evening there was extreme weakness, cold extremities, a\r\nscarcely perceptible pulse, and retention of urine; and at night she was\r\ndelirious. After this she recovered progressively, the chief symptoms\r\nthen being pain in the kidneys and inability to pass urine.[1489]\r\n\r\nAmong the symptoms the affection of the throat, causing difficult\r\ndeglutition and even an aversion to liquids, appears to be pretty\r\nconstant. The sense of irritation along the gullet and in the stomach is\r\nalso generally considerable. Sometimes it is attended with bloody\r\nvomiting, as in four cases related by Dr. Graaf of Langenburg;[1490] and\r\nat other times, as in the instance of poisoning with the acids, there is\r\nvomiting of membranous flakes. These have been mistaken for the lining\r\nmembrane of the alimentary canal, but are really in general a morbid\r\nsecretion.[1491] At the same time there is reason to believe that a\r\nportion of the membrane of the gullet was discharged in Rouquayrol’s\r\ncase; for there were ramified vessels in it, and one so large that blood\r\nissued on pricking it. A prominent symptom in general is distressing\r\nstrangury, and it commonly concurs with suppression of urine and the\r\ndischarge of blood.[1492] It would appear that, when the genital organs\r\nare much affected, the inflammation may run on to gangrene of the\r\nexternal parts. Ambrose Paré notices a fatal instance of the kind, which\r\nwas caused by a young woman seasoning comfits for her lover with\r\ncantharides.[1493]\r\n\r\nThe preceding symptoms are occasionally united with signs of an\r\ninjury of the nervous system. Headache is common, and delirium is\r\nsometimes associated with it.[1494] In a case communicated to Orfila\r\nthe leading symptoms at first were strangury and bloody urine; but\r\nthese were soon followed by violent convulsions and occasional loss\r\nof recollection.[1495] The quantity in that instance was only eight\r\ngrains; and it was taken for the purpose of self-destruction. In one\r\nof Graaf’s four cases the patient was attacked during convalescence\r\nwith violent phrensy of three days’ continuance.[1496] An instance\r\nis also related in the Transactions of the Turin Academy, of tetanic\r\nconvulsions and hydrophobia appearing three days after a small\r\nover-dose of the tincture of cantharides was taken, and continuing\r\nfor several days with extreme violence.[1497] The cause of the\r\nsymptoms, however, is here doubtful.\r\n\r\nA rare occurrence is relapse after apparent convalescence. In a case\r\ncommunicated to me by Dr. Osborne of Dundee, which there was every\r\nreason to believe had arisen from cantharides administered to a girl by\r\nan unprincipled scoundrel, the usual symptoms of violent irritation in\r\nthe bladder and rectum prevailed for 36 hours; and an interval of quiet\r\nand apparent convalescence ensued for three days. But on the fifth day\r\nthe urinary symptoms returned, and were attended with great prostration,\r\na rapid feeble pulse, and severe diarrhœa for two days longer. She\r\neventually recovered. Another girl, poisoned at the same time, had most\r\ndistressing irritation in the bladder, and for some time passed nothing\r\nbut drops of blood; but she got well in two days, and had no relapse.\r\n\r\nThe following fatal cases deserve particular mention. Orfila quotes one\r\nfrom the _Gazette de Santé_ for May, 1819, which was caused by two doses\r\nof twenty-four grains taken with the interval of a day between them, for\r\nthe purpose of suicide. The ordinary symptoms of irritation in the\r\nbowels and urinary organs ensued, miscarriage then took place, and the\r\npatient died on the fourth day, with dilated pupils and convulsive\r\nmotions, but with unimpaired sensibility.[1498] Another instance related\r\nby Dr. Ives of the United States, presented two stages, like that\r\nrelated by Orfila, but with the remarkable difference that an interval\r\nof several days intervened between the irritant and narcotic effects. A\r\nman swallowed an ounce of the tincture and was seized in a short time\r\nwith hurried breathing, flushed face, redness of the eyes and\r\nlacrymation, convulsive twitches, pain in the stomach and bladder,\r\nsuppression of urine and priapism; in the evening delirium set in, and\r\nnext morning there was loss of consciousness; but from this time under\r\nthe use of blood-letting, emetics, blisters, sinapisms, and castor-oil,\r\nhe got well and continued so for fourteen days. But after that interval\r\nhe was suddenly attacked with headache and shivering, then with\r\nconvulsions, and subsequently with coma; which, however, was removed for\r\na time by outward counter-irritants. Next day the coma returned at\r\nintervals, and on the subsequent day the convulsions also, which\r\ngradually increased in severity for three days more, and then proved\r\nfatal.[1499] In this case it admits of question whether the affection\r\nwhich proved the immediate cause of death really arose from the\r\ncantharides, or was an independent disease.—A third case, fatal on the\r\nfourth day, occurred in April, 1830, near Uxbridge in the south of\r\nEngland. I have not been able to learn the particulars exactly; but it\r\nappears to have been produced by cantharides powder, which was mixed\r\nwith beer by two scoundrels at a dancing party for the purpose of\r\nexciting the venereal appetite of the females. A large party of young\r\nmen and women were in consequence taken severely ill; and one girl died,\r\nwho had been prevailed on to take the powder at the bottom of the\r\nvessel, on being assured that it was ginger.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of the powder or tincture requisite to prove fatal or\r\ndangerous has not been accurately settled. Indeed practitioners differ\r\nmuch even as to the proper medicinal doses. The smallest dose of the\r\npowder yet known was twenty-four grains (Orfila); and the smallest fatal\r\ndose of the tincture was one ounce, which is equivalent to six grains of\r\npowder.[1500] It is probable that this is one of the poisons whose\r\noperation is liable to be materially affected by idiosyncrasy. The\r\nmedicinal dose is from half a grain to two grains of the powder, and\r\nfrom ten drops to two drachms of the tincture. But Dr. Beck has quoted\r\nan instance where six ounces of the tincture were taken without\r\ninjury.[1501] On the other hand Werlhoff has mentioned the case of a lad\r\nwho used to be attacked with erection and involuntary emission on merely\r\nsmelling the powder.[1502] This statement, though extraordinary, is not\r\nwithout support from the parallel effects of other substances.\r\n\r\nThe familiar effects of cantharides on the external surface of the body\r\nare not unattended with danger, if extensive, or induced in particular\r\nstates of the constitution. An ordinary blistered surface often\r\nulcerates in febrile diseases; and in the typhoid state which\r\ncharacterizes certain fevers, this ulceration has been known to pass on\r\nto fatal sloughing, especially when the blister has been applied to\r\nparts on which the body rests. I have met with two such cases. On the\r\nother hand if the blistered surface be very extensive, death may take\r\nplace in the primary stage of the local affection, in consequence of the\r\ngreat constitutional disturbance excited. Thus in 1841 a girl, affected\r\nwith scabies, received cantharides ointment by mistake instead of\r\nsulphur ointment from an hospital-serjeant at Windsor Barracks; and\r\nhaving anointed nearly her whole body with it, was seized with violent\r\nburning pain of the integuments, followed by vesication, general fever,\r\nand the usual symptoms of the action of this poison on the urinary\r\norgans. These effects were so severe that she died in five days.[1503]\r\n\r\n\r\n     SECTION II.—_Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Cantharides._\r\n\r\nThe only precise account I have hitherto seen of the morbid appearances\r\ncaused by cantharides is contained in the history of the case from the\r\n_Gazette de Santé_. The brain was gorged with blood. The omentum,\r\nperitonæum, gullet, stomach, intestines, kidneys, ureters, and internal\r\nparts of generation were inflamed; and the mouth and tongue were\r\nstripped of their lining membrane.—In dogs Schubarth observed, besides\r\nthe usual signs of inflammation in the alimentary canal, great redness\r\nof the tubular part of the kidneys, redness and extravasated patches on\r\nthe inside of the bladder, and redness of the ureters as well as of the\r\nurethra.[1504] M. Poumet denies that any morbid appearance is ever found\r\nin any part of the genito-urinary organs of animals; but he sometimes\r\nfound blood effused into the stomach and intestines.[1505] In Dr. Ives’s\r\ncase the blood-vessels of the brain and cerebellum were gorged, the\r\ncerebellum spread over with lymph, the villous coat of the stomach\r\nsoftened and brittle, and the kidneys inflamed and presenting blood in\r\ntheir pelvis.\r\n\r\nWhen the case has been rapid, the remains of the powder may be found in\r\nthe stomach or intestines by Poumet’s process. From the researches of\r\nOrfila and Lesueur, confirmed by those of Poumet, it appears not to\r\nundergo decomposition for a long time when mixed with decaying animal\r\nmatters. After nine months’ interment the resplendent green points\r\ncontinue brilliant.[1506]\r\n\r\n\r\n     SECTION III.—_Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Cantharides._\r\n\r\nThe treatment of poisoning with cantharides is not well established. No\r\nantidote has yet been discovered. At one time fixed oil was believed to\r\nbe an excellent remedy. But the experiments of Robiquet on the active\r\nprinciple of the poison, and those of Orfila on the effects of its\r\noleaginous solution, rather prove that oil is the reverse of an\r\nantidote. The case mentioned in the Genoa Memoirs was evidently\r\nexacerbated by the use of oil. When the accident is discovered early\r\nenough, and vomiting has not already begun, emetics may be given; and if\r\nvomiting has begun, it is to be encouraged. Oleaginous and demulcent\r\ninjections into the bladder generally relieve the strangury. The warm\r\nbath is a useful auxiliary. Leeches and blood-letting are required,\r\naccording as the degree and stage of the inflammation may seem to\r\nindicate.\r\n\r\nMany other insects besides the _Cantharis vesicatoria_ possess similar\r\nacrid properties. Two of them, however, may be briefly alluded to,\r\nbecause they have caused fatal poisoning. The one is the _Meloë\r\nproscarabæus_, the _Maiwurm_ of the Germans, a native of most European\r\ncountries. In Rust’s Magazin there is an account of four persons who\r\ntook the powder of this insect from a quack for spasms in the stomach.\r\nThe principal symptoms were stifling and vomiting; and two of the people\r\ndied within twenty-four hours.[1507] The other is the _Bombyx_, of which\r\nat least two species are believed to possess powerful irritant\r\nproperties, the _B. pityocarpa_ and _B. processionea_. The following is\r\nan instance of their effects. A child ten years old had a common blister\r\napplied to the neck and spine as a remedy for deafness; and four days\r\nafterwards her mother dressed the abraded skin with the leaves of\r\nbeet-root, from which she had previously shaken a great number of\r\ncaterpillars. The child soon complained of insupportable itching and\r\nburning in the part, and endeavoured to tear off the dressings. The\r\nmother persevered, however; and her child died in two days of gangrene\r\nof the whole integuments of the back. The surgeon who saw the child on\r\nthe last day of her life, ascribed the gangrene to the insects mentioned\r\nabove, and states that they possess the power of exciting erysipelas\r\nwhen applied even to the sound skin.[1508] It is probable that many\r\nother insects in Europe have similar properties. The _Mylabris\r\ncichorii_, which is partially used in Italy,[1509] and is in common use\r\nin India and China for blistering, possesses active irritant properties.\r\nThe _Cantharis ruficollis_, another species used in the Nizam’s\r\nTerritories in India, is also energetic. Other species known to possess\r\nactivity are _Mylabris fusselini_, _Meloe majalis_, _M. trianthemum_,\r\n_Coccinella bipunctata_, _C. septem-punctata_, and _Cantharis vittata_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n             OF THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF POISONOUS FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe species of fish which act deleteriously, either always or in\r\nparticular circumstances, have also been commonly arranged in the\r\npresent order of poisons.\r\n\r\nThe subject of fish-poison is one of the most singular in the whole\r\nrange of toxicology, and none is at present veiled in so great\r\nobscurity. It is well ascertained that some species of fish,\r\nparticularly in hot climates, are always poisonous,—that some, though\r\ngenerally salubrious and nutritive, such as the oyster and still more\r\nthe muscle, will at times acquire properties which render them hurtful\r\nto all who eat them,—and that others, such as the shell-fish now\r\nmentioned, and even the richer sorts of vertebrated fishes, though\r\nactually eaten with perfect safety by mankind in general, are\r\nnevertheless poisonous, either at all times or only occasionally to\r\nparticular individuals. But hitherto the chemist and the physiologist\r\nhave in vain attempted to discover the cause of their deleterious\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nA good account of the poisonous fishes of the tropics has been given by\r\nDr. Chisholm[1510] and by Dr. Thomas;[1511] and some farther\r\nobservations on the same subject have been published by Dr.\r\nFergusson.[1512] These essays may be consulted with advantage. On the\r\neffects of poisonous muscles several interesting notices and essays have\r\nbeen written, among which may be particularized one by Dr. Burrows[1513]\r\nof London, another by Dr. Combe of Leith,[1514] and the observations of\r\nProfessor Orfila, including some cases from the Gazette de Santé, and\r\nfrom the private practice of Dr. Edwards.[1515] Of all the sources of\r\ninformation now mentioned, that which appears to me the most\r\ncomprehensive and precise, is the essay of Dr. Combe, who has collected\r\nmany facts previously known, added others equal in number and importance\r\nto all the rest put together, and weighed with impartiality the various\r\ninferences which have been or may be drawn from them. The succeeding\r\nremarks will be confined to a succinct statement of what appears well\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nIn this work, however, the poisonous fishes of the West Indies and other\r\ntropical countries may be laid aside, because we are still too little\r\nacquainted with the phenomena of their action to be entitled to\r\ninvestigate its cause, and they are objects of much less interest to the\r\nBritish medical jurist than the fish-poison of his own coast.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that some of the inhabitants of the sea on the\r\ncoast of Britain are always poisonous. Thus it is well known that some\r\nof the molluscous species irritate and inflame the skin wherever they\r\ntouch it,—a fact which is familiar to every experienced swimmer. The\r\nfishermen of the English coast are also aware that a small fish known by\r\nthe name of Weever (_Trachinus vipera_, Cuv.) possesses the power of\r\nstinging with its dorsal fin so violently as to produce immediate\r\nnumbness of the arm or leg, succeeded rapidly by considerable swelling\r\nand redness; and indeed an instance of this accident, which happened at\r\nPortobello on the Firth of Forth, has been mentioned to me by Mr. Stark,\r\nauthor of the Elements of Natural History, who witnessed the effects of\r\nthe poison. But our knowledge of the poisons of that class is too\r\nimperfect to require more particular notice.\r\n\r\nOf fishes which are commonly nutritive, but sometimes acquire poisonous\r\nproperties, by far the most remarkable is the common _Muscle_.\r\nOpportunities have often occurred for observing its effects,—so often,\r\nindeed, that its occasional poisonous qualities have become an important\r\ntopic of medical police, and in some parts, as in the neighbourhood of\r\nEdinburgh and Leith, it has of late been abandoned by many people as an\r\narticle of food, although generally relished, and in most circumstances\r\nundoubtedly safe. This result originated in an accident at Leith in\r\n1827, by which no fewer than thirty people were severely affected and\r\ntwo killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Of the Symptoms and Morbid Appearances caused by Poisonous Muscles._\r\n\r\nThe effects of poisonous muscles differ in different cases. Sometimes\r\nthey have produced symptoms of local irritation only. Thus Foderé\r\nmentions the case of a sailor in Marseilles, who, in consequence of\r\neating a large dish of them, died in two days, after suffering from\r\nvomiting, nausea, pain in the stomach, tenesmus, and quick contracted\r\npulse. The stomach and intestines were found after death red and lined\r\nwith an abundant tough mucus.[1516] One of the cases described by Dr.\r\nCombe, which, however, terminated favourably, is of the same nature. The\r\npatient had severe stomach symptoms from the commencement, attended with\r\ncramps and ending in peritonitis, which required the frequent use of the\r\nlancet.\r\n\r\nBut much more commonly the local effects have been trifling, and the\r\nprominent symptoms have been almost entirely indirect and chiefly\r\nnervous. Two affections of this kind have been noticed. One is an\r\neruptive disease resembling nettle-rash, and accompanied with violent\r\nasthma; the other a comatose or paralytic disorder of a peculiar\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nOf the former affection several good examples have been recorded in\r\ndifferent numbers of the Gazette de Santé.[1517] In these the number of\r\nmuscles eaten was generally small; in one instance ten, in another only\r\nsix. Nay, in a case related with several others by Möhring in the German\r\nEphemerides, the patient only chewed one muscle and swallowed the fluid\r\npart, having spit out the muscle itself.[1518] The symptoms have usually\r\ncommenced between one and two hours after eating, and rapidly attained\r\ntheir greatest intensity. In the patient who was affected by ten muscles\r\nthe first symptoms were like those of violent coryza; swelling and\r\nitching of the eyelids, and general nettle-rash followed; and the\r\neruption afterwards gave place to symptoms of urgent asthma, which were\r\nremoved by ether. In other cases the symptoms of asthma preceded the\r\neruption. In one instance the eruption did not appear at all. The\r\nswelling has not been always confined to the eyelids, but, on the\r\ncontrary, has usually extended over the whole face. All the patients\r\nwere quickly relieved by ether. The eruption, though generally called\r\nnettle-rash, is sometimes papular, sometimes vesicular, but always\r\nattended with tormenting heat and itchiness. Several cases of this kind\r\nhave been related by Möhring. The eruption was preceded by dyspnœa,\r\nlividity of the face, insensibility, and convulsive movements of the\r\nextremities. All recovered under the use of emetics.[1519] This\r\naffection, however, may prove fatal. In the cases of two children\r\nrelated by Dr. Burrows, the symptoms began, as in Möhring’s cases, with\r\ndyspnœa, nettle-rash, and swelling of the face, combined with vomiting\r\nand colic; but afterwards the leading symptoms were delirium,\r\nconvulsions, and coma; and death took place in three days.\r\n\r\nIn these children it is worthy of remark, that none of the symptoms\r\nbegan till twenty-four hours after eating. In Möhring’s cases, on the\r\ncontrary, the symptoms began in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe other affection is well exemplified in the correct delineations of\r\nDr. Combe. The following is his general summary of the cases, which,\r\nwith the exception of the instance of peritonitis already alluded to,\r\nwere all singularly alike in their leading features.—“None, so far as I\r\nknow, complained of anything peculiar in the smell or taste of the\r\nanimals, and none suffered immediately after taking them. In general, an\r\nhour or two elapsed, sometimes more; and then the bad effects consisted\r\nrather in uneasy feelings and debility, than in any distress referable\r\nto the stomach. Some children suffered from eating only two or three;\r\nand it will be remembered that Robertson, a young and healthy man, only\r\ntook five or six. In two or three hours they complained of a slight\r\ntension at the stomach. One or two had cardialgia, nausea, and vomiting;\r\nbut these were not general or lasting symptoms. They then complained of\r\na prickly feeling in their hands; heat and constriction of the mouth and\r\nthroat; difficulty of swallowing and speaking freely; numbness about the\r\nmouth, gradually extending to the arms, with great debility of the\r\nlimbs. The degree of muscular debility varied a good deal, but was an\r\ninvariable symptom. In some it merely prevented them from walking\r\nfirmly, but in most of them it amounted to perfect inability to stand.\r\nWhile in bed they could move their limbs with tolerable freedom; but on\r\nbeing raised to the perpendicular posture, they felt their limbs sink\r\nunder them. Some complained of a bad coppery taste in the mouth, but in\r\ngeneral this was an answer to what lawyers call a leading question.\r\nThere was slight pain of the abdomen, increased on pressure,\r\nparticularly in the region of the bladder, which suffered variously in\r\nits functions. In some the secretion of urine was suspended, in others\r\nit was free, but passed with pain and great effort. The action of the\r\nheart was feeble; the breathing unaffected; the face pale, expressive of\r\nmuch anxiety; the surface rather cold; the mental faculties unimpaired.\r\nUnluckily the two fatal cases were not seen by any medical person; and\r\nwe are therefore unable to state minutely the train of symptoms. We\r\nascertained that the woman, in whose house were five sufferers, went\r\naway as in a gentle sleep; and that a few minutes before death, she had\r\nspoken and swallowed.”[1520] She died in three hours. The other fatal\r\ncase was that of a dock-yard watchman, who was found dead in his box six\r\nor seven hours after he ate the muscles.\r\n\r\nThe inspection of the bodies threw no light on the nature of these\r\nsingular effects. No appearance was found which could be called\r\ndecidedly morbid. The stomach contained a considerable quantity of the\r\nfish half digested.\r\n\r\nDr. Combe’s narrative agrees with that of Vancouver, four of whose\r\nsailors were violently affected, and one killed in five hours and a\r\nhalf, after eating muscles which they had gathered on shore in the\r\ncourse of his voyage of discovery.[1521]\r\n\r\nIn closing this account, allusion may be briefly made to a case related\r\nby Dr. Edwards, which differs from all the preceding. The symptoms were\r\nuneasiness at stomach, followed by epileptic convulsions, which did not\r\nentirely cease for a fortnight. Dr. Edwards imputed the illness to\r\nmuscles; but it must be observed that this is a solitary instance of\r\nsimple convulsions arising from such a cause.[1522] The case deserves\r\nparticular attention, because a suspicion of intentional poison might\r\nhave been excited by the circumstances in which it occurred. The\r\nindividual, a young man, was attacked soon after eating in company with\r\nanother, who was about to marry his mother, and with whom on that\r\naccount he lived on bad terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Of the Source of Poison of Muscles._\r\n\r\nVarious opinions have been formed as to the cause or causes of the\r\npoisonous qualities of some muscles.\r\n\r\nThe vulgar idea that the poisonous principle is copper, with which the\r\nfish becomes impregnated from the copper bottoms of vessels, is quite\r\nuntenable. Copper does not cause the symptoms described above. I\r\nanalyzed some of the muscles taken from the stomach of one of Dr.\r\nCombe’s patients, without being able to detect a trace of copper. Others\r\nhave arrived at the same result in former cases. The only instance\r\nindeed to the contrary is a late analysis by M. Bouchardat; who does not\r\nmention the quantity of copper he detected, or what was the source of\r\nthe poisonous fish.[1523]\r\n\r\nThe theory which ascribes their effects to changes induced by decay is\r\nequally untenable. In Dr. Burrows’s two cases the muscles appear to have\r\nbeen decayed; yet he very properly refuses to admit this fact as\r\nexplanatory of their operation. And, indeed, it rather complicates than\r\nfacilitates the explanation; as it shows that the poison differs from\r\nanimal poison generally, in not being destroyed by putrefaction. Dr.\r\nCombe’s inquiries must satisfy every one, that in the Leith cases decay\r\nwas out of the question, and I may add my testimony to the statement:\r\nthe muscles taken from the stomach of one of his fatal cases, and\r\nlikewise others obtained in the shell, and brought to me for analysis,\r\nwere perfectly fresh.\r\n\r\nBy some physicians, and especially by Dr. Edwards, their poisonous\r\neffects have been referred to idiosyncrasy on the part of the persons\r\nwho suffer. It can hardly be doubted that this is the cause in some\r\ninstances. It was formerly mentioned that muscles, oysters, crabs, and\r\neven the richer sorts of vertebrated fishes, such as trout, salmon,\r\nturbot, holibut, herring, mackerel, are not only injurious to some\r\npeople, while salutary to mankind generally, but likewise that this\r\nsingular idiosyncrasy may be acquired. A relation of mine for many years\r\ncould not take a few mouthfuls of salmon, trout, herring, turbot,\r\nholibut, crab, or lobster, without being attacked in a few minutes or\r\nhours with violent vomiting; yet at an early period of life, he could\r\neat them all with impunity; and at all times he has eaten without injury\r\ncod, ling, haddock, whiting, flounder, oysters, and muscles. Among the\r\ncases which have come under Dr. Edwards’s notice in Paris, there is one\r\nevidently of the same nature. In two others, the idiosyncrasy existed in\r\nregard to the muscle, and although in both of these the affection\r\ninduced was slight, there is no doubt but idiosyncrasy will also account\r\neven for some instances of the severe disorders specified above. In\r\nparticular, it appears sometimes to operate in the production of\r\nnettle-rash and asthma; for in the instance quoted from the Gazette de\r\nSanté, as arising from ten muscles, it happened that the father of the\r\npatient partook very freely of the same dish without sustaining any harm\r\nwhatever; and in each of three distinct accidents mentioned by Möhring,\r\nit appeared that other individuals had eaten of the same dish with equal\r\nimpunity.[1524]\r\n\r\nBut idiosyncrasy will not account for all the cases of poisoning with\r\nmuscles, oysters, and other fish. For, passing over other less\r\nunequivocal objections, it appears that, when the accident related above\r\nhappened at Leith, every person who ate the muscles from a particular\r\nspot was more or less severely affected; and an important circumstance\r\nthen observed for the first time was, that animals suffered as severely\r\nas man, a cat and a dog having been killed by the suspected article.\r\n\r\nAnother theory ascribes the poisonous quality to disease in the fish;\r\nbut no one has hitherto pointed out what the disease is. The poisonous\r\nmuscles at Leith were large and plump, and seemed to have been chosen on\r\naccount of their size and good look. Dr. Coldstream, however, at the\r\ntime a pupil of this University, and a zealous naturalist, thought the\r\nliver was larger, darker, and more brittle than in the wholesome fish,\r\nand certainly satisfied me that there was a difference of the kind. But\r\nwhether this was really disease or merely a variety of natural\r\nstructure, our knowledge of the natural history of the fish hardly\r\nentitles us to pronounce.\r\n\r\nConsidering the failure of all other attempts to account for the\r\ninjurious properties acquired by muscles, it is extraordinary that no\r\nexperiments have been hitherto made with the view of discovering in the\r\npoisonous fish a peculiar animal principle. It certainly seems probable,\r\nthat the property resides in a particular part of the fish or in a\r\nparticular principle. In 1827, I made some experiments on those which\r\ncaused the fatal accident at Leith, but without success. My attention\r\nwas turned particularly to the liver; but neither there nor in the other\r\nparts of the fish could I detect any principle which did not equally\r\nexist in the wholesome muscle. This result, however, should not deter\r\nothers, any more than it would myself, from a fresh investigation; for\r\nthe want of a sufficient supply prevented me from making a thorough\r\nanalysis; and the reader will presently find an instance related, where\r\nanother singular poison, sometimes contained in sausages and in cheese,\r\nwas, after repeated failures, at length traced successfully to the real\r\ncause by the hand of the analytic chemist.\r\n\r\nM. Lamouroux, in a letter to Professor Orfila, conjectures that the\r\npoison may be a particular species of Medusa, and enters into some\r\ningenious explanations of his opinion. But it is not supported by any\r\nmaterial fact, and seems to be surrounded by insuperable\r\ndifficulties.[1525] It is not a new conjecture; for Möhring mentions in\r\nhis paper formerly quoted, that several writers before him had conceived\r\nsuch a cause might afford an explanation of the phenomena.[1526]\r\n\r\nLittle or no light is thrown on this singular subject by the nature of\r\nthe localities in which the poisonous muscle has been found. Even on\r\nthis point we possess little information. Both in Dr. Burrows’s and Dr.\r\nCombe’s cases the fish was attached to wood. At Leith they were taken\r\nfrom some Memel fir logs, which formed the bar of one of the wet-docks,\r\nand had lain there at least fifteen years. From the stone-walls of the\r\ndock in the immediate vicinity of this bar muscles were taken which\r\nproved quite wholesome. It is impossible, however, to attach any\r\nimportance to these facts; for Dr. Coldstream informs me, that he\r\nexamined muscles which were attached to the fir piles of the Newhaven\r\nChain-pier, about a mile from Leith, and found them wholesome. In the\r\nlatter animals the liver was not large, as in the poisonous muscles of\r\nLeith. Lamouroux states, but I know not on what authority, that muscles\r\nnever become poisonous unless they are exposed alternately to the air\r\nand the sea in their place of attachment, and unless the sea flows in\r\ngently over them without any surf,—these conditions being considered by\r\nhim requisite for the introduction of the poisonous Medusæ into the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Of Poisonous Oysters._\r\n\r\n_Oysters_ sometimes acquire deleterious properties analogous to those\r\nacquired by muscles. But fewer facts have been collected regarding them.\r\nM. Pasquier has mentioned some cases which occurred not long ago at\r\nHavre, in consequence apparently of an artificial oyster-bed having been\r\nestablished near the exit of the drain of a public necessary. But I have\r\nnot been able to consult his work.[1527] Another instance of their\r\ndeleterious operation occurred a few years ago at Dunkirk. At least an\r\nunusual prevalence of colic, diarrhœa, and cholera was believed to have\r\nbeen traced to an importation of unwholesome oysters from the Normandy\r\ncoast. Dr. Zandyk, the physician who was appointed to investigate the\r\nmatter, found that the suspected fish contained a slimy water, and that\r\nthe membranes were retracted from the shell towards the body of the\r\nanimal.[1528] Dr. Clarke believes that even wholesome oysters have a\r\ntendency to act deleteriously on women immediately after delivery. He\r\nasserts that he has repeatedly found them to induce apoplexy or\r\nconvulsions; that the symptoms generally came on the day after the\r\noysters were taken; and that two cases of the kind proved fatal.[1529] I\r\nam not aware that these statements have been since confirmed by any\r\nother observer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Of Poisonous Eels._\r\n\r\n_Eels_ have also been at times found in temperate climates to acquire\r\npoisonous properties. Virey mentions an instance where several\r\nindividuals were attacked with violent tormina and diarrhœa a few hours\r\nafter eating a paté made of eels from a stagnant castle-ditch near\r\nOrleans; and in alluding to similar accidents having previously happened\r\nin various parts of France, he adds that domestic animals have been\r\nkilled by eating the remains of the suspected dish.[1530]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n                    OF POISONING BY VENOMOUS SNAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother entire group of poisons allied to the acrid vegetables in their\r\naction, but infinitely more energetic, comprehends the poisons of the\r\nvenomous serpents. If we were to trust the impressions the vulgar\r\nentertain of the effects of the bite of serpents, the poisons now\r\nmentioned would be considered true septics or putrefiants; for they were\r\nonce universally believed, and are still thought by many, to cause\r\nputrefaction of the living body. This property has been assigned them\r\nprobably on no other grounds, except that they are apt to bring on\r\ndiffuse subcutaneous inflammation, which frequently runs on to gangrene.\r\nBut there are some serpents, especially among those of hot climates,\r\nwhich appear also to act remotely on the centre of the nervous system,\r\nand to occasion death through means of that action.\r\n\r\nThe present group of poisons is of little consequence to the British\r\nmedical jurist, as an opportunity of witnessing their effects in this\r\ncountry is seldom to be found. The viper is the only poisonous snake\r\nknown in Britain, where its poison is hardly ever so active as to\r\noccasion death.[1531]\r\n\r\nThis serpent, like all the other poisonous species, is provided with a\r\npeculiar apparatus by which the poison is secreted, preserved, and\r\nintroduced into the body of the animal it attacks. The apparatus\r\nconsists of a gland behind each eye, of a membranous sac at the lateral\r\nand anterior part of the upper jaw, and of a hollow curved tooth\r\nsurrounded and supported by the sac. The cavity of the tooth\r\ncommunicates with that of the sac, and terminates near the tip, in a\r\nsmall aperture, by which the poison is expelled into the wound made by\r\nthe tooth.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms caused by the bite of the viper are lancinating pain, which\r\nbegins between three minutes and forty minutes after the bite, and\r\nrapidly stretches up the limbs,—swelling, at first firm and pale,\r\nafterwards red, livid and hard,—tendency to fainting, bilious vomiting,\r\nsometimes convulsions, more rarely jaundice,—quick, small, irregular\r\npulse,—difficult breathing, cold perspiration, dimness of vision, and\r\ninjury of the mental faculties. Death may ensue. A case is related in\r\nRust’s Magazin of a child twelve years old, who died two days after\r\nbeing bitten in the foot;[1532] another instance is briefly noticed in\r\nthe French Bulletins of Medicine, of a person forty years old, dying\r\nalso in two days;[1533] Dr. Wagner of Schlieben mentions his having met\r\nwith two instances where persons bit on the toes died before assistance\r\ncould be procured;[1534] and notice has been taken in Hufeland’s Journal\r\nof a girl, eleven years old, having been killed in three hours at\r\nSchlawe in Prussia.[1535] In the last case burning in the foot, which\r\nwas the part bitten, then severe pain in the belly, inextinguishable\r\nthirst, and vomiting, preceded a fit of laborious breathing, which\r\nushered in death. The most remarkable instance, however, of death from\r\nthe bite of the European viper is one lately described by Dr. Braun, as\r\nhaving been occasioned in the Dutchy of Gotha by the Coluber Chersea\r\n[Kreuzotter of the Germans]. A man, who represented himself to be a\r\nsnake-charmer, insisted on showing his skill before Dr. Lenz, a\r\nnaturalist of Schnepfenthal; and putting the head of a viper belonging\r\nto this gentleman’s collection into his mouth, he pretended to be about\r\nto devour it. Suddenly he threw the snake from him, and it was found\r\nthat he had been bitten near the root of the tongue. In a few minutes he\r\nbecame so faint that he could not stand, the tongue swelled a little,\r\nthe eyes became dim, saliva issued from the mouth, rattling respiration\r\nsucceeded, and he died within fifty minutes after being bitten.[1536] A\r\nFrench writer observes that the common viper of France is not very\r\ndeadly; but that the bite of the red viper may occasion death in a few\r\nhours.[1537]\r\n\r\nThe activity of the poison of the viper depends on a variety of\r\ncircumstances. When kept long confined, the animal loses its energy; and\r\nafter it has bitten repeatedly in rapid succession, its bite ceases for\r\nsome time to be poisonous, as the supply of poison is exhausted. It\r\nappears also to be most active in hot and dry climates. Those cases are\r\nalways the most severe in which the symptoms begin soonest; and the\r\ndanger increases with the number of bites. An important observation made\r\nby Dr. Wagner is that danger need not be dreaded except when the bite is\r\ninflicted on small organs such as the fingers or toes, because larger\r\nparts cannot be fully included between the animal’s jaws, and fairly\r\npierced by its fangs, but can only be scratched. The properties of the\r\nfluid contained in the reservoir do not cease with the animal’s life;\r\nnay they continue even when the fluid is dried and preserved for a\r\nlength of time. It may be swallowed in considerable quantity without\r\ncausing any injury whatever. In the course of some experiments lately\r\nmade in Italy, a pupil of Professor Mangili swallowed at once the whole\r\npoison of four vipers without suffering any inconvenience; and that of\r\nsix vipers was given to a blackbird, that of ten to a pigeon, and that\r\nof sixteen to a raven, with no other effect beyond slight and transient\r\nstupor.[1538]\r\n\r\nFor the most recent account of the far more terrible effects of the\r\ncobra di capello and rattlesnake, the reader may refer to the\r\nauthorities below.[1539]\r\n\r\nIt was stated above that the poison of the viper retains its activity\r\nwhen dried. I have had an opportunity of observing this in regard to the\r\npoison of the cobra di capello, which is said to be preserved in India\r\nby simply squeezing out the contents of the poison-bag, and drying the\r\nliquid in a silver dish exposed to the sun. The specimen in my\r\npossession, for which I am indebted to Mr. Wardrop of London, has the\r\nappearance of small fragments of gum-arabic. It had been kept for\r\nfifteen years when I tried its effects on a strong rabbit. A grain and a\r\nhalf dissolved in ten drops of water, having been introduced between the\r\nskin and muscles of the back, the animal in eight minutes became very\r\nfeeble and averse to stir, so that it remained still even when placed in\r\nirksome postures; occasional slight twitches of the limbs supervened; at\r\nlength it became extremely torpid, and breathed slowly by means of the\r\nabdominal muscles and diaphragm alone; and in twenty-seven minutes it\r\ndied exhausted, without any precursory insensibility. The heart\r\ncontracted readily, when irritated nine minutes after death; so that the\r\npoison seemed to operate by causing muscular paralysis, and consequently\r\narresting the respiration.\r\n\r\nThere might also be arranged in an appendix to the present group of\r\npoisons those _insects_ whose sting is poisonous. The European insects\r\nknown to have a poisonous sting, are chiefly the scorpion, tarantula,\r\nbee and wasp; of which the last two only are natives of Britain.\r\n\r\nThe poison of these insects occasions diffuse cellular inflammation,\r\nwhich always ends in resolution. It is said, however,[1540] and it may\r\nbe readily believed, that death has been sometimes caused in consequence\r\nof a whole hive attacking an intruder and covering his body with their\r\nstings. In an old French journal is shortly noticed the case of a\r\npeasant who died soon after being stung over the eye by a single\r\nbee.[1541] A more probable story has been told in the Gazette de Santé\r\nof a gardener who died of inflammation of the throat, in consequence of\r\nbeing stung there by a wasp while he was eating an apple, in which it\r\nhad been concealed.[1542] But the same accident has often occurred\r\nwithout any material danger.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of poisoning by venomous serpents need not be detailed\r\nhere. The subject is introduced merely to mention that the treatment of\r\npoisoned wounds by the application of cupping-glasses has been lately\r\nresorted to with success for curing the bite of the viper. A patient of\r\nM. Piorry, two hours after being bitten, had all the constitutional\r\nsymptoms strongly developed, such as slow, very feeble pulse, nausea,\r\nvomiting, and swelling of the face. When a cupping-glass was applied for\r\nhalf an hour, the general symptoms ceased and did not return. Next day\r\ndiffuse inflammation began; but it was checked by leeches.[1543] An\r\nequally successful case is related in the Calcutta Transactions by Mr.\r\nClarke.[1544]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n          OF POISONING BY DISEASED AND DECAYED ANIMAL MATTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother and much more important group of poisons, that may be arranged\r\nin the present order, comprehends animal matter usually harmless or even\r\nwholesome, but rendered deleterious by disease or decay. These poisons\r\nare formed in three ways, by morbid action local or constitutional, by\r\nordinary putrefaction, and by modified putrefaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Of Animal Matter rendered Poisonous by Diseased Action._\r\n\r\nUnder the first variety might be included the latent poisons by means of\r\nwhich natural diseases are communicated by infection, contact, and\r\ninoculation. Such poisons, however, being usually excluded from a strict\r\ntoxicological system, the only varieties requiring notice are the animal\r\npoisons engendered by disease, and which do not produce peculiar\r\ndiseases, but merely inflammation. Several species of this kind may be\r\nmentioned, comprehending the solids and fluids in various unhealthy\r\nstates of the body.\r\n\r\nOne of these poisons, contained in the blood and perhaps in some of the\r\nsecretions of overdriven cattle, arises under circumstances in which the\r\nbody seems to deviate little from its natural condition. A good account\r\nof the effects thus induced has been given in an essay on the subject by\r\nMorand.[1545] From the cases he describes it follows, that the flesh of\r\nsuch animals is wholesome enough when cooked and eaten; but that if the\r\nblood or raw flesh be applied to a wound or scratch, nay even sometimes\r\nto the unbroken skin, a dangerous and often fatal inflammation is\r\nexcited, which at times differs little from diffuse cellular\r\ninflammation, and at other times consists of a general eruption of\r\ngangrenous boils, the _pustules malignes_ of the French. The deleterious\r\neffects occasionally observed to arise from offal are probably analogous\r\nin their nature and their cause. On this subject Sir B. Brodie has made\r\nsome remarks which tend to show that the application of various kinds of\r\noffal to wounds, and especially pricks of the fingers with spiculæ of\r\nbone from the hare, may cause an obstinate chronic erysipelas of the\r\nhand.[1546] I have met with a case of this nature, where the affection\r\nwas erratic erythema of the hand.\r\n\r\nAnother species of poison, allied to the preceding in its effects and\r\nequally obscure in its nature, includes certain fluids of the human body\r\nafter natural death, which are probably modified, if not even formed\r\naltogether, by morbid processes during life. Such poisons are the most\r\nfrequent source of the dreadful cellular inflammation, often witnessed\r\nas the consequence of pricks received during dissection by the\r\nanatomist. On this interesting but obscure subject, much minute\r\ninformation will be found in the works quoted below.[1547]\r\n\r\nIt is still a matter of question among pathologists what these poisons\r\nare, and in what circumstances they spring up. By some their baneful\r\nproperties have been suspected to arise from the operation of particular\r\ndiseases on natural or morbid secretions;[1548] and although the precise\r\ndiseases inducing these properties, and the precise fluids which acquire\r\nthem have by no means been satisfactorily ascertained, it appears well\r\nestablished that no fluid possesses them more frequently or in a higher\r\ndegree than the serum effused into the cavities of the chest and belly\r\nby recent inflammation of the serous membranes of these cavities. By\r\nothers the origin of the poison is suspected to be wholly independent of\r\ndiseased action in the living body and to lie merely in certain changes\r\neffected in healthy secretions by decay. And as the accidents produced\r\nby this poison have occurred chiefly during the dissection of bodies\r\nrecently dead, it is supposed to exist only for a short time at the\r\ncommencement of decay, and to disappear in the farther progress of\r\nputrefaction.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be its nature and origin, we are well enough acquainted\r\nwith its effects; which are diffuse inflammation and violent\r\nconstitutional excitement, quickly passing to a state resembling typhoid\r\nfever. Sometimes the inflammation spreads steadily towards the trunk\r\nfrom the part to which the poison was applied; sometimes the\r\ninflammation around the injury is trifling and limited, but a similar\r\ninflammation appears in or near the axilla, and subsequently on other\r\nparts of the body; and the latter form of disease is always attended\r\nwith the highest constitutional derangement and with the greatest\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nAnother singular poison, unequivocally the product of disease, and which\r\nacts as a local irritant, is the flesh or fluids of animals affected at\r\nthe time of their death with a carbuncular disorder, denominated in\r\nGermany _Milzbrand_, and analogous to the _pustule maligne_ of the\r\nFrench. The disease, so far as I know, has not received a vulgar name in\r\nthe English language, being fortunately rare in Britain. It is a\r\nconstitutional and epidemic malady, which sometimes prevails among\r\ncattle on the continent to an alarming extent, and is characterized by\r\nthe eruption of large gangrenous carbuncles on various parts of the\r\nbody. This distemper has the property of rendering the solids and fluids\r\npoisonous to so great a degree, that not only persons who handle the\r\nskin, entrails, blood, or other parts, but even also those who eat the\r\nflesh, are apt to suffer severely. The affection thus produced in man is\r\nsometimes ordinary inflammation of the alimentary canal, or\r\ncholera;[1549] more commonly a disorder precisely the same as the\r\npustule maligne;[1550] but most frequently of all an eruption of one or\r\nmore large carbuncles resembling those of the original disease of\r\ncattle.[1551] It is often fatal. The carbuncular form has been known to\r\ncause death in forty-eight hours.[1552] It is an interesting fact, for\r\nthe knowledge of which we are indebted to M. Dupuy, that the carbuncle\r\nof cattle may be caused by applying to a wound the blood or spleen of an\r\nanimal killed by gangrene of the lungs.[1553]\r\n\r\nA poison analogous to the former in its nature, which has sometimes\r\noccasioned severe and even fatal effects in man is the matter of\r\n_glanders_, a contagious disease to which the horse is peculiarly\r\nsubject, and which is communicated probably by means of a morbid\r\nsecretion from the nostrils. This disease has been propagated to man by\r\ninfection; at least instances have been related where grooms attending\r\nglandered horses, although they had no external injury through which\r\ninoculation could take place, were attacked with profuse fetid discharge\r\nfrom the nostrils, a pustular eruption on the face, and colliquative\r\ndiarrhœa, which has sometimes ended fatally in a few days.[1554] In\r\nother instances inoculation of the hand with the blood of the glandered\r\nhorse has produced alarming diffuse inflammation, and a carbuncular\r\neruption.[1555]\r\n\r\nIt appears probable, that some peculiar circumstances with which we are\r\nnot yet acquainted must concur with the operation of the poisons now\r\nunder review, before they can take effect. At least unequivocal facts\r\nhave been published which show, that the fluids and solids, as well as\r\nthe emanations of animals infected and even killed by glanders or the\r\n_pustule maligne_, may be often handled and breathed with impunity. Such\r\nis the result of a careful inquiry made under the direction of the\r\nParisian Board of Health into the nuisance occasioned by the great\r\nNackery of Montfaucon.[1556] Parent-Duchatelet, the author of an\r\nelaborate report on the subject, considers it clearly established that\r\nneither the workmen nor the horses connected with the establishment, nor\r\nthe tanners who are supplied with hides from it, have ever presented a\r\nsingle instance of disease referrible to the operation of diseased\r\nanimal matter. Yet upwards of twelve thousand horses are annually flayed\r\nthere, and among these it is calculated that at least three thousand six\r\nhundred are affected with carbuncle, glanders, or farcy.[1557]\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Of Animal Matter rendered Poisonous by common Putrefaction._\r\n\r\nThe second mode in which animal matters, naturally wholesome or\r\nharmless, may acquire the properties of irritant poisons, is by their\r\nundergoing ordinary putrefaction.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of putrefaction to impart deleterious qualities to animal\r\nmatters originally wholesome has been long known, and is quite\r\nunequivocal. To those who are not accustomed to the use of tainted meat,\r\nthe mere commencement of decay is sufficient to render meat\r\ninsupportable and noxious. Game, only decayed enough to please the\r\npalate of the epicure, has caused severe cholera in persons not\r\naccustomed to eat it in that state. The power of habit, however, in\r\nreconciling the stomach to the digestion of decayed meat is\r\ninconceivable. Some epicures in civilized countries prefer a slight\r\ntaint even in their beef and mutton; and there are tribes of savages\r\nstill farther advanced in the cultivation of this department of\r\ngastronomy, who eat with impunity rancid oil, putrid blubber, and\r\nstinking offal. How far putrefaction may be allowed to advance without\r\noverpowering the preservative tendency of habit, it is not easy to tell.\r\nBut with the present habits of this and other civilized nations, the\r\nlimit appears very confined.\r\n\r\nPutrid animal matter when injected into the veins of healthy animals\r\nproves quickly fatal; and from the experiments of Gaspard and\r\nMagendie,[1558] together with the more recent researches of MM. Leuret\r\nand Hamont,[1559] the disease induced seems to resemble closely the\r\ntyphoid fever of man.\r\n\r\nSimilar effects were observed by Magendie, when dogs were confined over\r\nvessels in which animal matter was decaying, so that they were obliged\r\nalways to breathe the exhalations.[1560] These discoveries throw some\r\nlight on the question regarding the tendency of putrid effluvia to\r\nengender fever in man; and notwithstanding many well ascertained facts\r\nof an opposite import, they show that, probably in peculiar\r\ncircumstances, decaying animal matter may excite epidemic fevers. A\r\ndetailed investigation of this important topic would be misplaced here,\r\nas it belongs more to medical police than to medical jurisprudence; but\r\nthe two works quoted below are referred to for examples, in my opinion,\r\nof the unequivocal origin of continued fever in the cause now alluded\r\nto;[1561] and other instances of the like kind will be found in the\r\nReport of the Parliamentary Commission on the Health of Towns.\r\n\r\nAnother affection sometimes brought on by putrid exhalations is violent\r\ndiarrhœa or dysentery, of which a remarkable instance lately occurred in\r\nthe person of a well-known French physician, M. Ollivier. While visiting\r\na cellar where old bones were stored, he was seized with giddiness,\r\nnausea, tendency to vomit and general uneasiness; and subsequently he\r\nsuffered from violent colic with profuse diarrhœa, which put on the\r\ndysenteric character and lasted for three days.[1562] Chevallier, in\r\nnoticing this accident, mentions his having been affected somewhat in\r\nthe same way when exposed to the emanations of dead bodies; and it is a\r\nfamiliar fact that medical men, who engage in anatomical researches\r\nafter long disuse, are apt to suffer at first from smart diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nThe same remark must be applied here as at the close of the observations\r\nin the last section. Without peculiar concurring circumstances no bad\r\neffect results. This will follow from many facts illustrative of the\r\ninnocuous nature of various trades where the workmen are perpetually\r\nexposed to the most noisome putrid effluvia. But no facts of the kind\r\nare so remarkable as those collected in regard to the establishment at\r\nMontfaucon by Parent-Duchatelet, who makes it appear that this most\r\nabominable concentration of the worst of all possible nuisances is not\r\nmerely not injurious to the health of the men and animals employed in\r\nand around it, but actually even preserves them from epidemic or\r\nepizootic diseases.[1563]\r\n\r\nThe effects of putrid animal matter when applied to wounds have been\r\ninvestigated experimentally by Professor Orfila; who found that putrid\r\nblood, bile, or brain, caused death in this way within twenty-four\r\nhours,—producing extensive local inflammation of the diffuse kind, and\r\ngreat constitutional fever. In man also several instances of diffuse\r\ncellular inflammation have been observed as the consequence of pricks\r\nreceived during the dissection of putrid bodies. The disease, as\r\nformerly observed, certainly arises in general from pricks received in\r\ndissecting recent bodies. At the same time, a few cases have been traced\r\nquite unequivocally to inoculation with putrid matter;[1564] and if any\r\ndoubts existed on this point, the experiments of Orfila would remove\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nM. Lassaigne has examined chemically the putrid matter formed by keeping\r\nflesh long in close vessels, and has found it to consist of carbonate of\r\nammonia, much caseate of ammonia, and a stinking volatile oil,—the last\r\nof which is probably the poisonous ingredient.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of Animal Matter rendered Poisonous by Modified Putrefaction._\r\n\r\nThe third way in which animal matters naturally wholesome may become\r\nirritant poisons, is by their undergoing a modified putrefaction.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that many common articles of food occasionally become\r\npoisonous in this way; but none are so liable to acquire injurious\r\nproperties as certain articles much used in Germany, namely, a\r\nparticular kind of sausage, a particular kind of cheese, and bacon. The\r\nlast two species of poison have been occasionally observed in France,\r\nand probably occur in Britain also. But the first has been hitherto met\r\nwith only in some districts of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe best account yet given of the _sausage-poison_ is contained in two\r\nessays published by Dr. Kerner,[1565] in a Thesis by Dr. Dann,[1566] and\r\nin a prize-essay by Dr. W. Horn.[1567] It has at various times committed\r\ngreat ravages in Germany, especially in the Würtemberg territories,\r\nwhere 234 cases of poisoning with it occurred between the years 1793 and\r\n1827; and of that number no less than 110 proved fatal.[1568]\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of poisoning seldom begin till twenty-four, or even\r\nforty-eight hours, after the noxious meal, and rather later than\r\nearlier. The tardiness of their approach seems owing to the great\r\nindigestibility of the fatty matter with which the active principle is\r\nmixed. The first symptoms are pain in the stomach, vomiting, purging,\r\nand dryness of the mouth and nose. The eyes, eyelids, and pupils then\r\nbecome fixed and motionless; the voice is rendered hoarse, or is lost\r\naltogether; the power of swallowing is much impaired; the pulse\r\ngradually fails, frequent swoonings ensue, and the skin becomes cold and\r\ninsensible. The secretions and excretions, with the exception of the\r\nurine, are then commonly suspended; but sometimes profuse diarrhœa\r\ncontinues throughout. The appetite is not impaired; fever is rarely\r\npresent; and the mind continues to the last unclouded. Fatal cases end\r\nwith convulsions and oppressed breathing between the third and eighth\r\nday. In cases of recovery the period of convalescence may be protracted\r\nto several years. The chief appearances in the dead body are signs of\r\ninflammation in the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal,—such as\r\nwhiteness and dryness of the throat, thickening of the gullet, redness\r\nof the stomach and intestines; also croupy deposition in the windpipe;\r\ngreat flaccidity of the heart; and a tendency in the whole body to\r\nresist putrefaction. In a set of cases which occurred so lately as 1841,\r\nthere was found after death abscesses in the tonsils, dark bluish\r\nredness of the membrane of the pharynx, windpipe and bronchial\r\nramifications, gorging of the pulmonary air-tubes and condensation of\r\nthe pulmonary tissue itself, dark redness of the fundus of the stomach,\r\nwith circumscribed softening, a dark gray, red, or black appearance of\r\nthe mucous coat of the intestines, accumulation of greenish-yellow fæces\r\nin the colon, brittleness of the liver, and enlargement of the\r\nspleen.[1569]\r\n\r\nThe article which is apt to occasion these baneful effects is of two\r\nsorts, the white and the bloody sausage (_leberwürste_, _blut-würste_).\r\nBoth are of large size, the material being put into swine’s stomachs;\r\nand they are cured by drying and smoking them in a chimney with\r\nwood-smoke. Those which have been found to act as poisons possess an\r\nacid reaction, are soft in consistence, have a nauseous, putrid taste,\r\nand an unpleasant sweetish-sour smell, like that of purulent matter.\r\nThey are met with principally about the beginning of spring, when they\r\nare liable to be often alternately frozen and thawed in the curing.\r\nThose sausages only become poisonous which have been boiled before being\r\nsalted and hung up. They are poisonous only at a particular stage of\r\ndecay, and cease to be so when putrefaction has advanced so far that\r\nsulphuretted-hydrogen is evolved. The central part is often poisonous\r\nwhen the surface is wholesome.\r\n\r\nVarious opinions have been entertained of the cause of the deleterious\r\nqualities thus contracted. In recent times the principle has been\r\nsupposed to be pyroligneous acetic acid, hydrocyanic acid, or cocculus\r\nindicus. Dr. Kerner, however, has shown that none of these notions will\r\naccount for the phenomena; and at first conceived he had proved the\r\npoisonous principle to be a fatty acid analogous to the sebacic acid of\r\nThenard, and originating in a modified process of putrefaction. From the\r\npoisonous sausage he procured by double decomposition an acid similar in\r\nchemical properties to that obtained from fat by destructive\r\ndistillation; and by experiments on animals he thought he observed, that\r\nthe acid procured in either way produced symptoms analogous to those of\r\npoisoning with the deleterious sausage. Subsequently, however, he\r\nchanged his views in some measure; and he now considers that the poison\r\nis a compound one, consisting of a fatty acid analogous to the sebacic,\r\nand of a volatile principle.[1570] The results obtained by Dr. Dann\r\ncoincide with the last opinion. Dann infers from his researches that the\r\npoisonous principle does not necessarily reside in an acid, but is an\r\nacrid empyreumatic oil, which when pure is not active, but is rendered\r\nso by uniting with various fatty acids.[1571]\r\n\r\nThe results lately obtained by Buchner after an elaborate and careful\r\nanalysis are somewhat different and probably nearer the truth. He first\r\nascertained that the product of the distillation of fat has no analogy\r\nwith the sausage-poison. He found it to consist of animalized acetic\r\nacid, and a fetid empyreumatic oil, the former of which has no injurious\r\neffect on animals, while the latter, though an active poison, is purely\r\nnarcotic in its operation. On next examining a sausage sent to him from\r\nWürtemberg, which had violently affected four individuals and killed one\r\nof them in six days, he remarked that the poisonous principle is not\r\nsoluble in water, or capable of being distilled over with it; and that\r\ncold alcohol removes a granular fatty matter, which, when purified by\r\ndistilled water, has a yellowish colour, a peculiar nauseous smell, and\r\na disagreeable oleaginous taste, followed by extraordinary dryness of\r\nthe throat for several hours. Although it does not possess an acid\r\nreaction on litmus, it forms a soap with alkalis, and is separated again\r\nby acids unchanged; and consequently it may be considered a fatty acid,\r\nto which Buchner proposes to give the name of Botulinic acid\r\n[Würst-fett-saüre]. It concentrates in itself the poisonous properties\r\nof the crude sausage. Thirty grains of it, which formed three-fourths of\r\nthe whole product of a single sausage, were given in two doses to a\r\npuppy with an interval of a day between them. For some hours after the\r\nsecond dose no apparent effect was produced. But gradually the animal\r\nbecame dull, lay in the same spot, wasted rapidly away notwithstanding a\r\nvigorous appetite, and died of exhaustion on the thirteenth day. Half a\r\ngrain causes insupportable dryness in the throat, which does not go off\r\nfor several hours.[1572] With these results the contemporaneous and\r\nunconnected researches of Dr. Schumann accord very remarkably. Alcohol\r\nboiled on the poison-sausage deposited on cooling a fatty matter, which,\r\nwhen washed with distilled water, possessed all the properties specified\r\nby Buchner, as characterizing his fatty acid, and acted on animals in\r\nthe same way as the sausage-poison.[1573]\r\n\r\nThe _poison of cheese_ has been for some time more generally known. Dr.\r\nHenneman has published an interesting essay on several cases which\r\nhappened at Schwerin in 1823.[1574] Another account of a similar\r\naccident which happened at Minden in 1825 has been published in Rust’s\r\nMagazin.[1575] But by far the best information on the subject is to be\r\nobtained from two papers in Horn’s Archiv,—the one by Professor Hünefeld\r\nof Greifswald, describing the phenomena as he witnessed them in that\r\ncity in 1827, and containing an elaborate chemical analysis and\r\nphysiological experiments, by means of which he conceives he has\r\ndiscovered the deleterious principles contained in the cheese,[1576]—the\r\nother by Dr. Westrumb of Hameln, who investigated the particulars of\r\nseven cases which came under his notice in 1826, and with the aid of\r\nSertürner, the chemist, traced the properties of the poison to almost\r\nthe same principles with those indicated by the researches of\r\nHünefeld.[1577] Besides the cases which have given origin to these\r\npapers, others have occurred throughout Germany in the same period; and\r\nduring the third quarter of last century this kind of poisoning was so\r\ncommon, that several of the German states investigated the subject, and\r\nlegislative enactments were passed in consequence.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the prevalent belief was that the cheese acquired an\r\nimpregnation from copper vessels used in the dairies; and accordingly\r\nthe Austrian, Wirtemberg and Ratesberg States prohibited the use of\r\ncopper for such purposes. This opinion, however, was proved by chemical\r\nanalysis to be untenable; and the inquiries of Hünefeld and Sertürner,\r\nhave now rendered it probable that the poisonous property of the cheese\r\nresides in two animal acids, analogous, if not identical, with the\r\ncaseïc and sebacic acids.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which the formation of these acids is accounted for is as\r\nfollows. According to the researches of Proust the sharp peculiar taste\r\nof old cheese is owing to the gradual conversion of the curd or casein\r\ninto the caseate of ammonia, which in sound cheeses is always united\r\nwith the excess of alkali. In the cheese in question (_barscher-käse_,\r\n_quark-käse_, _hand-käse_) the curd, before being salted, is left for\r\nsome time in a heap to ferment, in consequence of which it becomes sour\r\nand afterwards ripens faster. But if the milk has been curdled with\r\nvinegar,—if the acid liquor formed while it ferments is not carefully\r\ndrained off,—if the fermentation is allowed to go too far,—if too little\r\nsalt is used in preserving the curd,—or if flour has been mixed with the\r\ncurd, the subsequent ripening or decaying of the cheese follows a\r\npeculiar course, and a considerable excess of caseïc acid is formed, as\r\nwell as some sebacic acid.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous cheeses, according to Westrumb, present no peculiarity in\r\ntheir appearance, taste or smell. But Hünefeld says that they are\r\nyellowish-red, soft, and tough, with harder and darker lumps\r\ninterspersed, that they have a disagreeable taste, redden litmus, and\r\nbecomes flesh-red instead of yellow, under the action of nitric acid.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms they cause in man appear to be nearly the same with those\r\nproduced by the poisonous sausage, and usually commence, according to\r\nHünefeld, in five or six hours, according to Westrumb in half an hour.\r\nThey constitute various degrees and combinations of gastro-enteric\r\ninflammation. In the most severe of Hünefeld’s cases the quantity taken\r\ndid not exceed four ounces, and was sometimes only an ounce.\r\n\r\nThe same author found that a drachm and a half of the caseïc acid, which\r\nhe procured from the cheese, killed a cat in eight minutes, and the same\r\nquantity of the sebacic acid another in three hours. His experiments,\r\nhowever, are not quite conclusive of the fact that these acids are\r\nreally the poisonous principles, as he has not extended his experimental\r\nresearches to the caseïc and sebacic acids prepared in the ordinary way.\r\nHis views will probably be altered and simplified, if future experiments\r\nshould confirm the late inquiries of Braconnot, who has stated that\r\nProust’s caseïc acid is a modification of the acetic, combined with an\r\nacrid oil.[1578] Westrumb procured analogous results with those of\r\nHünefeld when he gave to animals the acid fat which he separated in the\r\ncourse of his analysis.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous cheese has been hitherto met with chiefly in some parts of\r\nGermany. From information communicated to me by Dr. Swanwick of\r\nMacclesfield, there is some reason to think that a parallel poison is\r\noccasionally met with in Cheshire, among the small hill-farms, where the\r\nlimited extent of the dairies obliges the farmer to keep the curd for\r\nseveral days before a sufficient quantity is accumulated for the larger\r\ncheeses.—I am indebted to Mr. Wilson of Lockerby for the particulars of\r\na set of cases, which seem to have been owing to some obscure poison in\r\ncheese. A gentleman, an hour after eating the suspected cheese, was\r\nseized with extreme weakness and severe vomiting for four hours, then\r\nwith general soreness and a mercurial taste in the mouth, and afterwards\r\nwith tenesmus, bloody stools, soreness of the gums, and cramps in the\r\nlimbs; from which symptoms he did not recover for four weeks. Five other\r\nmembers of his household suffered similarly, but less severely, and also\r\nthe shop-boy who ate a little while selling it. None of the ordinary\r\nmineral poisons could be detected in it.—It is hardly necessary to add,\r\nthat analogous properties may be imparted to cheese by the intentional\r\nor accidental addition of other poisons of a mineral nature. This\r\nsubject has been already alluded to in the section upon lead.\r\n\r\nAs connected, though indeed but remotely, with the cheese-poison, some\r\nnotice may be here taken of a peculiar mode in which it has been\r\nsupposed that _milk_ may acquire the properties of an acrid poison. It\r\nhas been several times remarked on the continent, that the milk even of\r\nthe cow, but more particularly that of the ewe and goat, may act like a\r\nviolent poison, although no mineral or other deleterious impregnation\r\ncould be detected in it; and these effects have been variously and\r\nvaguely ascribed to the animal having been diseased, or to its having\r\nfed on acrid vegetables, which pass into the milk without injury to its\r\nhealth, because though poisonous to most animals, they are not so to the\r\nRuminantia. This singular topic cannot be thoroughly investigated, as\r\nprecise facts are still wanting. But the two following examples of the\r\naccident alluded to may be mentioned. One occurred at Aurillac, a\r\nvillage in France. Fifteen or sixteen customers of a particular dealer\r\nin goats’ milk were at one and the same time attacked with all the\r\nsymptoms of violent cholera; and about twenty-four hours afterwards the\r\ngoat too was taken ill with the same affection, and died in three\r\ndays.[1579] The other instance occurred at Hereford in Westphalia. Six\r\npeople of a family, after partaking of goat’s butter-milk, were\r\nsimultaneously attacked with violent vomiting, tension of the\r\nepigastrium, and retraction of the lower belly; and several of them\r\nsuffered so severely as even to have been thought by their physician,\r\nDr. Bonorden, to be in danger.[1580] Dr. Westrumb has alluded to similar\r\ncases in his memoir on the poison of cheese, and has proved that the\r\nordinary explanations of them are far from satisfactory. Among other\r\njudicious observations he remarks, that the poison has been generally\r\nbelieved to arise sometimes from the cattle having fed on the _Euphorbia\r\nesula_, a species of spurge; that, according to Viridet in his\r\n_Tractatus de Prima Coctione_, l. i. c. 15, certain fields in the\r\nneighbourhood of Embrim were of necessity abandoned by the shepherds,\r\nbecause the milk of their cows was rendered useless by the abundance of\r\nthat plant among the herbage; but that he himself has found cattle will\r\nnot touch it so long as grass and other wholesome vegetables are to be\r\nfound in the pasturage.[1581] Professors Orfila and Marc, who were\r\nappointed by the Society of Medicine of Paris to report upon the\r\naccident at Aurillac, state, that in parallel cases which had been\r\nreferred to them by the police at Paris they had been unable to detect\r\nany mineral poison; that none of the received explanations are in their\r\nopinion satisfactory; and that they are disposed to ascribe the\r\npoisonous alteration of the milk to new principles formed by a vital\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nAnother common article of food, which has occasionally produced similar\r\neffects with the poisonous sausages and cheese, is bacon. Dr. Geiseler\r\nhas related an accident which occurred in a family of eight persons, and\r\nwhich he traced to this cause. The symptoms were almost exactly the same\r\nwith those described by Kerner, with the addition, however, of delirium\r\nand loss of recollection; and in two they were so violent as seriously\r\nto endanger life. The father of the family alone escaped, having stewed\r\nhis bacon, while the rest ate it raw.[1582] His escape might have arisen\r\nfrom the fatty acid having been decomposed, or the acrid oil expelled,\r\nby the heat. It is not improbable that other varieties of cured meat may\r\nalso become poisonous. Cadet de Gassicourt mentions, that he had been\r\nfrequently desired by the police to examine cured meat which had\r\nproduced symptoms of poisoning at Paris,[1583] and Orfila makes the same\r\nremark in his Lectures on Medical Jurisprudence.[1584] As the meat\r\nalways came from the shops of meat-curers, and did not contain any\r\nmineral poison, it probably owed its qualities to the same ingredient as\r\nthe bacon in Geiseler’s cases. A full and interesting account of an\r\naccident of the kind has also been given by M. Ollivier, of which the\r\nfollowing is an analysis. Three members of a family at Paris, on the day\r\nafter eating a ham-pie, were seized with shivering, cold sweats, violent\r\npain in the stomach, frequent vomiting, burning thirst, excessive\r\ntenderness of the belly, profuse purging, and colic; but they all\r\nrecovered under antiphlogistic treatment. On subsequent inquiry it\r\nappeared that about the same period other customers of the pastry-cook\r\nwho supplied the pie had been similarly affected; and consequently an\r\ninvestigation was made into the cause under the authority of the police.\r\nAfter a very careful analysis, however, by MM. Barruel and Ollivier, it\r\nwas clearly made out, that the pie did not contain a trace of any of the\r\ncommon mineral poisons; and therefore the only conclusion Ollivier\r\nconceived it possible to draw was, that the ham had acquired the\r\nproperties of the poisonous sausage or cheese of Germany.[1585] Two\r\nsimilar reports have been since published, one by MM. Lecanu,\r\nLabarraque, and Delamorlière, another by Chevallier; and both agree in\r\nascribing the poisonous effects to the decay of the meat, the ordinary\r\npoisons having been sought for in vain. In the cases examined by\r\nChevallier, the article was a sort of sausage, called in Paris “Italian\r\nCheese,” and made of scraps of various kinds of meat, especially\r\npork.[1586] M. Boutigny has published an account of a similar accident\r\nwhich befel a great number of people at a festival in France. He could\r\nnot find any of the ordinary poisons in the meat, which had been taken\r\nchiefly in the form of sausages; and being consequently persuaded that\r\nthe suspected articles were wholesome, he dined on stuffed turkey, sold\r\nby the dealer who had supplied them. But he was seized with chilliness,\r\ncontracted pulse, cold sweating, lividity of the countenance, great\r\nanxiety, and then with vomiting and purging; after which he slowly\r\nrecovered.[1587]\r\n\r\nOther articles of food have been occasionally observed to act\r\ninjuriously on the health. Thus M. Ollivier has given an account of a\r\nwhole family having been apparently poisoned with mutton under the\r\ninfluence of modified decay. Six individuals were attacked soon after\r\ndinner with vomiting, purging, colic, tenderness of the belly, extreme\r\nprostration, and a small hurried pulse. Four of them died within eight\r\ndays. General inflammatory redness, with some extravasation under the\r\nmucous coat, was found throughout the whole course of the small\r\nintestines. No trace could be detected of any of the ordinary poisons;\r\nand Ollivier was therefore led to ascribe the accident to some\r\npeculiar change produced in stewed mutton, which all the individuals\r\nhad partaken of at dinner.[1588] In 1839 a singular accident happened\r\nat Zurich, which was ascribed to decayed _veal_ and _ham_. On a\r\nfete-day 600 people, who had dined upon cold roast-veal and ham in a\r\nwooden erection, were all taken ill with shivering, giddiness,\r\nheadache, burning fever, diarrhœa and vomiting; some had delirium,\r\nothers a fœtid salivation and even ill-conditioned ulcers of the\r\nmouth; and in the worst cases collapse of the countenance, involuntary\r\nstools, and extreme prostration preceded death. On dissection the\r\nalimentary mucous membrane was found softened and the intestinal\r\nfollicles ulcerated. The cause was supposed to have been\r\nsatisfactorily traced to incipient putrefaction of the veal and ham,\r\nwhich constituted the fundamental part of the repast.[1589] Effects\r\nsomewhat similar have been observed from spoiled _goose-grease_, used\r\nin dressing food. Dr. Siedler has related four cases where violent\r\nsymptoms were thus induced. Two adults and two children, after eating\r\na dish seasoned with goose-grease, were seized with giddiness,\r\nprostration of strength, anxiety, sweating,—burning pain in the lower\r\nbelly, aggravated by pressure,—violent vomiting, in one case\r\nsanguinolent,—involuntary stools, and urine, and dilatation of the\r\npupil. In one of the adults there was also complete insensibility,\r\nwith imperceptible pulse for six minutes. No metallic poison could be\r\nfound. The grease was acid, and of a repulsive odour; and three ounces\r\ngiven to a dog acted violently and in the same manner.[1590] Another\r\narticle of food which has appeared occasionally to produce parallel\r\neffects is _smoked sprats_. An instance of their injurious operation\r\nis briefly described in the work quoted below;[1591] and Dr.\r\nO’Shaughnessey informed me some years ago, that, while in London, he\r\nmet with the case of a female, advanced in pregnancy, who after eating\r\nsmoked sprats, in which she remarked a disagreeable sharp taste, was\r\nattacked with severe colic, sickness, vomiting of food mixed with\r\nstreaks and clots of blood, and some diarrhœa. Putrid _pickled salmon_\r\nhas occasioned death in this country;[1592] and I may mention that I\r\nhave known most violent diarrhœa occasioned in two instances by a very\r\nsmall portion of the oily matter about the fins of _kipper_ or smoked\r\nsalmon, so that I have no doubt a moderate quantity would produce\r\nserious effects.\r\n\r\nAlthough these illustrations of the effects of modified putrefaction in\r\nrendering wholesome meat noxious have been taken in a great measure from\r\ncontinental experience, this has been done rather because the subject\r\nhas been more fully and accurately investigated there, than because\r\nsimilar poisons are unknown in Britain. The defective system of medical\r\npolice in this country would allow such accidents as those mentioned\r\nabove to pass sometimes without notice, and almost always without\r\nscientific examination; but it must not therefore be supposed that they\r\nare wholly unknown.\r\n\r\nThe following incident, which happened a few years ago on the Galloway\r\ncoast, is an instance of poisoning not less alarming than any of those\r\nwhich have occurred in Germany. In the autumn of 1826 four adults and\r\nten children ate at dinner a stew made with meat taken from a dead calf,\r\nwhich was found by one of them on the sea shore, and of which no history\r\ncould be procured. For three hours no ill effect followed. But they were\r\nthen all seized with pain in the stomach, efforts to vomit, purging, and\r\nlividity of the face, succeeded by a soporose state like the stupor\r\ncaused by opium, except that when roused the patient had a peculiar wild\r\nexpression. One person died comatose in the course of six hours. The\r\nrest, being freely purged and made to vomit, eventually got well; but\r\nfor some days they required the most powerful stimulants to counteract\r\nthe exhaustion and collapse which followed the sopor. The meat, they\r\nsaid, looked well enough at the time it was used. Yet the remains of the\r\nfish which formed the noxious meal had a black colour and nauseous\r\nsmell; and the uncooked flesh had a white, glistening appearance, and\r\nwas so far decayed that its odour excited vomiting and fainting.[1593]\r\nIt is much to be regretted that this accident was not properly inquired\r\ninto. The only conjecture which the facts will warrant as to the cause\r\nof the poisonous quality of the meat is, that in consequence of having\r\nlain long in the water, the flesh had begun to undergo the adipocirous\r\nputrefaction; and that in the course of the changes thus induced the\r\nmeat became impregnated with some poisonous principle, like that of the\r\nGerman sausages, or cheese.\r\n\r\nAn accident of a similar nature, for the particulars of which I am\r\nindebted to Dr. Swanwick of Macclesfield, occurred at Stockport in the\r\nsummer of 1830. A family of five persons took for dinner broth made of\r\nbeef, which, owing to its black colour, the master of the family had\r\npreviously said to his wife he thought bad and unfit for use. In the\r\ncourse of some hours two boys were attacked with sickness and vomiting,\r\nbut appear to have got soon well, probably owing to the early discharge\r\nof the poison. Next morning a washerwoman who had dined with the family\r\nwas seized with violent pain in the bowels, diarrhœa, racking pains and\r\nweakness in the limbs; and she did not recover for ten days. On the\r\nevening of the second day the master of the house was similarly\r\naffected, and was ill for a fortnight. And a day later his wife was also\r\nseized with a similar disorder, preceded by soreness of the throat and\r\ntongue and difficulty of swallowing, and ending fatally in fourteen\r\ndays. The last person was previously in delicate health, and subject to\r\ndisorder in the stomach and bowels. The investigation made by the police\r\nauthorities into the circumstances of this accident was extremely\r\nimperfect: but there seems little reason to doubt that unsound meat was\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\nI am not sure under what head to arrange the following observations,\r\ncommunicated to me by Dr. M’Divitt of Canterbury, and of which he has\r\nsince published a detailed account.[1594] But they may be mentioned,\r\nperhaps not inappropriately, in the present place; and at all events\r\nthey deserve careful attention, as referring to a description of cases\r\nwhich may be mistaken for other kinds of poisoning.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that pork in all forms, but especially when fresh, is\r\napt to cause indigestion in many persons who are not accustomed to it.\r\nBut Dr. M’Divitt has shown by a number of interesting cases, that even\r\nin those habituated to its use, it may, from unascertained causes,\r\nexcite symptoms closely allied to those of irritant poisoning. The\r\neffects sometimes begin within three hours, the symptoms being those of\r\nan affection of the stomach, such as sudden violent pain in the\r\nepigastrium, difficult breathing, irregularity of the pulse, great\r\nprostration and alarm, coldness of the extremities and vomiting. If a\r\nlonger period elapses,—and sometimes no injury accrues for many hours,\r\nor even a whole day,—the symptoms indicate an affection of the abdomen,\r\nnamely, pain in the region of the duodenum, or of the sigmoid flexure of\r\nthe colon, with the other symptoms just enumerated, but which ere long\r\nbecome attended with more pungent pain, tension and tenderness of the\r\nbelly, frequency of the pulse, and ineffectual straining to evacuate the\r\nbowels. In the less urgent and slower cases of this nature there is\r\nlittle or no vomiting. Sometimes nettle-rash appears. Stimulants,\r\nopiates, and blood-letting are of no avail; and the only useful remedies\r\nare emetics and cathartics, which speedily put an end to the symptoms by\r\nremoving their cause. In all the cases related by the author the pork\r\nwas either fresh or recently salted, fatter than usual, but not ill\r\npreserved or otherwise faulty in any appreciable respect. In every\r\ninstance the individuals had eaten pork often before without injury; and\r\non several occasions others ate without harm the same pork which seemed\r\ndeleterious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n                 OF POISONING BY MECHANICAL IRRITANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _fifth_ order of the irritant class of poisons includes mechanical\r\nirritants.\r\n\r\nThese substances have not properly speaking any poisonous quality; but\r\noccasion symptoms like those of poisoning, and even sometimes death\r\nitself, in consequence of their mechanical qualities only. They have\r\ntherefore been excluded from every toxicological system proposed in\r\nrecent times; but in a medico-legal work on poisoning it would be wrong\r\nto pass them without notice.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the mechanical irritants are those which cause\r\ninjury by reason of their roughness, sharpness, or size.\r\n\r\nMany instances have occurred of persons having swallowed fragments of\r\nsteel, copper, iron, broken glass, or entire prune-stones,\r\ncherry-stones, and the like,—who not long afterwards were attacked with\r\nsigns of inflammation, or some other abdominal disease, and were carried\r\noff by it as by the administration of poison. The disorders thus induced\r\nare almost always of a chronic or lingering kind, and commonly depend on\r\ngradual perforation of the intestines by the foreign body pressing on\r\nthe coats. In general the illness ends in inflammation of the\r\nperitonæum. Sometimes the irritating substance perforates the skin and\r\nmuscles as well as the intestines, and escapes outwardly; and a few\r\nindividuals have even recovered under these circumstances. An excellent\r\naccount of the ordinary course of such accidents is given in the London\r\nMedical and Physical Journal. The person swallowed a chocolate bean, and\r\nafter experiencing many uneasy sensations throughout the belly for\r\nseveral days, was attacked with peritonitis and died.[1595] Mr. Howship\r\nhas related the particulars of the case of a woman, died after two years\r\nof constant suffering, in consequence of having swallowed a large\r\nquantity of cherry-stones.[1596] Dr. Marcet has also described the case\r\nof a sailor who died in a similar way after swallowing several large\r\nclasp-knives.[1597] Thus too, although it is a familiar fact, that\r\nneedles and pins are in general swallowed with impunity, death\r\nnevertheless sometimes arises from this cause. Guersent mentions the\r\ncase of a child who died in the course of two months of frequent\r\nvomiting caused by swallowing a pin, which was found after death pinning\r\nthe stomach, as it were, to the liver.[1598] Dupuytren relates the case\r\nof a woman, who, after swallowing an incredible number of needles and\r\npins, became very lean and was confined to bed by the excruciating pain\r\nexcited on motion by the needles and pins escaping through the skin.\r\nThere were seldom less than fifty tumours or abscesses on various parts\r\nof the body; and Dupuytren, on opening about a hundred of these,\r\ninvariably found one or more needles or pins in each. She laboured under\r\ngeneral debility, irritative fever, and marasmus, and at length died\r\nhectic. After death many hundred pins and needles were found among the\r\nmuscles and viscera.[1599] Many other examples might be referred to, but\r\nthese will suffice for information on the ordinary effects of mechanical\r\nirritants of the kind under consideration.\r\n\r\nFrom the case of Dr. Marcet and other similar facts, it appears that\r\nlarge and even angular bodies do not always cause serious mischief, nay,\r\nthat they have been frequently swallowed without any material injury.\r\nDr. Marcet’s sailor in the course of his life had repeatedly swallowed\r\nseveral clasp-knives in quick succession: and nevertheless recovered\r\nperfectly after some days of slight illness. As to prune and\r\ncherry-stones, buttons, coins, needles, pins, and the like, they have\r\nbeen very often taken, and even sometimes in large quantities, without\r\nany harm. It is indeed extraordinary, and almost incredible, if the\r\nfacts were not authenticated beyond the possibility of a doubt, how much\r\nmechanical irritation the alimentary canal has been subjected to,\r\nwithout sustaining any injury. Mr. Wakefield mentions that a man, who\r\nwas committed to the House of Correction, swallowed seven half-crowns,\r\nto prevent the prison authorities from depriving him of them. He\r\nsuffered no inconvenience for twenty months; when, after an attack of\r\nsickness, slight bowel-complaint, and general tenderness of the belly,\r\nhe discharged them all at one evacuation.[1600] Many singular instances\r\nto the same effect have been related in the various medical journals of\r\nEurope. At the head of the list, however, may be placed the following,\r\nwhich is related by the late Professor Osiander of Göttingen, in his\r\nwork on Suicide.\r\n\r\nA young German nobleman tried to kill himself in a fit of insanity by\r\nswallowing different indigestible substances, but without success. He\r\nnever suffered any particular inconvenience except a single attack of\r\nvomiting daily, though in the course of seven months after being\r\ndetected he passed the following articles by stool—150 pieces of sharp,\r\nangular glass, some of them two inches long—102 brass pins—150 iron\r\nnails—three large hair pins, and seven large chair-nails—a pair of\r\nshirt-sleeve buttons—a collar-buckle, half of a shoe-buckle, and three\r\nbridle-buckles—half a dozen sixpenny pieces—three hooks, and a lump of\r\nlead—three large fragments of a currycomb, and fifteen bits of nameless\r\niron articles, many of them two inches in length.[1601]\r\n\r\nBefore such articles occasion serious harm, it is necessary that some\r\ncause coincide, by means of which the foreign bodies are detained long\r\nin the same part of the intestines; otherwise the irritation they\r\nproduce is too trivial to excite disease.\r\n\r\nThe only substance of this kind which it is necessary to particularize\r\nis _pounded glass_. A common notion prevails that pounded glass is an\r\nactive poison. There is no doubt, indeed, that it does possess some\r\nirritant properties even when finely pulverized; for it titillates and\r\nsmarts the nostrils, and inflames the eyes. There is also little doubt\r\nthat when swallowed in fragments of moderate size, especially if the\r\nstomach is empty, it may wound the viscera. But it is in this way only\r\nthat it has any action when swallowed, and even then its effects are by\r\nno means uniformly serious. It can have no chemical action on the\r\nstomach; it cannot act through absorption, as it is quite insoluble: and\r\nwhen finely pulverized, it cannot easily wound the villous coat of the\r\nalimentary canal, on account of the abundance and viscidity of the\r\nlubricating mucus.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, M. Lesauvage ascertained that 2½ drachms of the powder may\r\nbe given to a cat at once without hurting the animal,—that in the course\r\nof eight days seven ounces might be given to a dog without any bad\r\nconsequence, although the period chosen for administering it was always\r\nsome time before meals,—and that even when the glass was in fragments a\r\nline in length, no symptoms of irritation were induced. Relying indeed\r\non these results he himself swallowed a considerable number of similar\r\nfragments; and did not sustain any injury.[1602] Caldani likewise, an\r\nItalian physician, after some experiments on animals, gave a boy fifteen\r\nyears old several drachms of pounded glass, without observing any bad\r\neffects; and at his request Mandruzzato repeated his experiments on\r\nanimals, and himself swallowed on two successive days two drachms and a\r\nhalf each day without sustaining any injury.[1603]\r\n\r\nSimilar observations have been made by others also. Dr. Turner of\r\nSpanish Town, Jamaica, has informed me, that an attempt was made there\r\nby a negro to poison a whole family by administering pounded glass; but,\r\nalthough a large quantity was taken by seven persons, none of them\r\nsuffered any inconvenience. Not long ago the occurrence of a similar\r\ncase at Paris gave rise to a careful investigation of the whole subject\r\nby Baudelocque and Chaussier. A young man, Lavalley, married a girl who\r\nwas pregnant by him; but it was agreed that she should live with her\r\nfather till her delivery was over. A month after the marriage Lavalley\r\ninvited his wife and father-in-law to dinner; and his wife ate heartily\r\nboiled pork, bloody-sausages, and roast-veal, and subsequently drank\r\ncoffee with brandy in it. On returning home in the evening she became\r\nunwell, continued so all night, next morning was seized with violent\r\npain in the stomach and vomiting, and died in convulsions. The period of\r\nher death is not mentioned in the report I have seen. A suspicion of\r\npoisoning having arisen after burial, the body was disinterred in\r\nforty-two days; and, although it was much decayed, black points and\r\npatches could be distinguished in many parts of the bowels, together\r\nwith a quantity of broken down glass. The medical inspectors accordingly\r\ndeclared that she had died of poisoning with pounded glass; and the\r\nhusband was imprisoned. Baudelocque and Chaussier, who were consulted,\r\nascribed the black patches to putrefaction or venous congestion, and\r\ndeclared that in whatever way the glass had got into the bowels, she had\r\nnot died of poisoning with the substance, as pounded glass is not\r\ndeleterious.[1604] A similar opinion as to the properties of pounded\r\nglass was more lately given by Professor Marc, when consulted on a case\r\nof attempted poisoning, in which the person against whom the attempt was\r\nmade felt the rough particles in his mouth while taking the second\r\nspoonful of soup in which the glass was contained.[1605]\r\n\r\nThis opinion certainly appears to be in general true. At the same time\r\ninstances are not wanting to render it probable, that pounded or broken\r\nglass is occasionally hurtful. Thus, passing over the more doubtful\r\nexamples recorded by the older authors, we have the two following cases\r\nrelated by good authorities in the most modern times. One has been\r\npublished by Mr. Hebb of Worcester. A child, eleven months old, died of\r\na few days’ illness in very suspicious circumstances. On Mr. Hebb being\r\nrequested by the coroner to examine the body, he found the inside of the\r\nstomach lined with a tough layer of mucus streaked with blood; the\r\nvillous coat was highly vascular, and covered with numberless particles\r\nof glass of various sizes, some of which simply touched, while others\r\nlacerated it; and no other morbid appearance could be detected in the\r\nbody.[1606] The other case is described by Portal. A man undertook for a\r\nwager to eat his wine-glass, and actually swallowed a part of it. But he\r\nwas attacked with acute pain in the stomach, and subsequently with\r\nconvulsions. Portal made him eat a surfeit of cabbage; and having thus\r\nenveloped the fragments, administered an emetic, which brought away the\r\nglass and vegetables together.[1607] The same feat has undoubtedly been\r\nsometimes accomplished with impunity. For example, in the Edinburgh\r\nMedical and Surgical Journal, an instance is related of a man who\r\nchamped and swallowed three-fourths of a drinking-glass without\r\nsuffering any harm; and the person mentioned by Osiander swallowed many\r\npieces of glass, and sustained no inconvenience (p. 503). But these\r\nfacts will not altogether outweigh the equally pointed narratives of\r\nPortal and Mr. Hebb. And, on the whole, the medical jurist must come to\r\nthe conclusion, that broken and pounded glass, though generally\r\nharmless, may sometimes prove injurious or even fatal.[1608] Powdered\r\nglass, however, is probably inert.\r\n\r\nAnother variety of injury from the mechanical irritants is inflammation\r\nfrom hot liquids, such as _melted lead or boiling water_. These, when\r\nswallowed, may unquestionably cause serious mischief, and even death;\r\nand the symptoms they induce are exactly those of the irritant poisons\r\nproperly so called.\r\n\r\nThe effects of boiling water have been investigated experimentally by\r\nDr. Bretonneau of Tours; and the results illustrate forcibly the\r\nobservations which have been repeatedly made in the course of this work,\r\nrespecting the slight constitutional derangement caused by such poisons\r\nas have merely a local irritating power. He found that when boiling\r\nwater was injected in the quantity of eight ounces into the stomach of\r\ndogs, it excited inflammation, passing on to gangrene, both in the\r\nvillous and muscular coats. The symptoms, however, were trifling. For a\r\nday or two the animals appeared languid; but in three days they\r\ngenerally became lively and playful, one of them actually lined a bitch,\r\nand it was only on strangling them and examining the bodies, that the\r\nextent of the mischief was discovered.[1609]\r\n\r\nI am not aware that any such case have hitherto occurred in man. Death\r\nfrom drinking boiling water, indeed, is not an uncommon accident,\r\nparticularly in Ireland and some parts of England, where children, who\r\nare in the habit of drinking cold water from the tea-kettle, have\r\nswallowed boiling water by mistake. It appears, however, that in these\r\ninstances death is not owing to inflammation of the gullet and stomach,\r\nbut to inflammation of the upper part of the windpipe,—the water never\r\npassing lower than the pharynx. The best information on this subject is\r\ncontained in an interesting paper by Dr. Hall.[1610] He has there given\r\nthe particulars of four cases which came under his notice; from which it\r\nfollows that the disease induced is always _cynanche laryngea_, proving\r\nfatal by suffocation. Two of his patients died suffocated; another,\r\nwhile in imminent danger, was relieved by tracheotomy, but died\r\nafterwards of exhaustion; the fourth recovered suddenly during a fit of\r\nscreaming, when apparently about to be choked; and it was supposed that\r\nthe vesicles around the glottis had been burst by the cries.\r\n\r\nPouring melted lead down the throat was a frequent mode of despatching\r\ncriminals and prisoners in former ages. Only one authentic case is to be\r\nfound on record of death from this cause in modern times. It occurred at\r\nthe burning of the Eddistone light-house. A man, while gazing up at the\r\nfire with his mouth open, received a shower of melted lead from the\r\nbuilding, and expired after twelve days of suffering. Seven ounces and a\r\nhalf of lead had reached the stomach; and the stomach was severely\r\nburnt, and ulcerated.[1611]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn concluding the Irritant Poisons, and before proceeding to the next\r\nclass, the Narcotics, it is necessary to observe, that besides the\r\nsubstances which have been treated of, there are others not usually\r\nconsidered poisons, and some that are even used daily for seasoning\r\nfood, which, nevertheless, when taken in large quantities, will prove\r\ninjurious and even occasion all the chief symptoms of the active\r\nirritants. These substances connect the true poisons with substances\r\nwhich are inert in regard to the animal economy.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to particularize all the articles of the kind now\r\nalluded to. But in illustration, I may refer in a few words to six\r\ncommon substances, pepper, Epsom salt, alum, cream of tartar, sulphate\r\nof potash, and common salt.\r\n\r\n_Pepper_, which is daily used by all ranks with impunity, will\r\nnevertheless cause even dangerous symptoms when taken in large quantity.\r\nIn Rust’s Journal is noticed the case of a man affected with a tertian\r\nague, who after taking between an ounce and a half and two ounces of\r\npepper in brandy, was attacked with convulsions, burning in the throat\r\nand stomach, great thirst, and vomiting of every thing he swallowed. His\r\ncase was treated as one of simple gastritis, and he recovered.[1612]\r\n\r\nA very striking instance, which may be arranged under the present head,\r\nhas also been related to me, of apparent poisoning with Epsom salt. A\r\nboy ten years old took two ounces of this laxative partly dissolved,\r\npartly mixed in a tea-cupful of water; and had hardly swallowed it\r\nbefore he was observed to stagger and become unwell. When the surgeon\r\nsaw him half an hour after, the pulse was imperceptible, the breathing\r\nslow and difficult, the whole frame in a state of extreme debility, and\r\nin ten minutes more the child died without any other symptom of note,\r\nand in particular without any vomiting. The circumstances having been\r\ninvestigated judicially, it appeared that the substance taken was pure\r\nEpsom salt; that the father, who was doatingly fond of the child, gave\r\nthe laxative on account of a trifling illness which he supposed might\r\narise from worms; and that on the most careful inspection of the body,\r\nno morbid appearance whatever could be found in any part of it. For the\r\nparticulars of this singular case, I am indebted to Dr. Dewar of\r\nDunfermline, the medical inspector under the sheriff’s warrant. It shows\r\nthat in certain circumstances even the laxative neutral salts may be\r\nirritating enough to cause speedy death.\r\n\r\nOf the same nature probably are the cases which have lately led some to\r\nascribe poisonous properties to _sulphate of potash_, a purgative salt\r\nat one time in common use. About three years ago several instances of\r\napparent poisoning with this substance occurred in Paris; and one of\r\nthem proved fatal. This was the case of a woman, recently delivered, who\r\ngot 100 grains every fifteen minutes till she had taken six doses.\r\nImmediately after the first dose she was seized with severe pain in the\r\nstomach, nausea, vomiting, numbness, and cramps in the arms and legs,\r\nthen with dyspnœa and severe purging, and in two hours she expired. The\r\nstomach and intestines were emphysematous, but otherwise healthy; and\r\nthe stomach contained sulphate of potash, but not a trace of any of the\r\ncommon poisons. The stock of this salt in the shop where it had been\r\npurchased was found to be perfectly pure.[1613]—A remarkable case of the\r\nsame kind lately led to a criminal trial in London. A man Haynes was\r\ncharged with attempting to procure abortion by giving his wife sulphate\r\nof potash. It was proved that on two successive evenings he gave her a\r\ndose of two ounces of the salt; that she was seized after the first dose\r\nwith excessive and alarming sickness, from which, however, she soon\r\nrecovered without apparent harm; but that after the second dose she had\r\nviolent vomiting and profuse purging, of which she died in five hours,\r\nwithout any alteration in the symptoms, except that she became\r\ninsensible for five minutes before death. The whole gastro-intestinal\r\nmucous membrane was bright red, the vessels of the brain were much\r\ncongested, and between two and three ounces of blood had escaped from\r\nthe neighbourhood of the occipital sinus. The salt had been swallowed in\r\na single tumbler of water, so that part of it was undissolved. Mr.\r\nBrande, who analyzed the sample which had been used, found it free of\r\nall the ordinary irritant poisons. Mr. Coward of Hoxton, to whom I owe\r\nthe particulars of this singular case, was of opinion, along with other\r\nmedical gentlemen concerned in it, that death arose from apoplexy\r\nbrought on by the violent and unceasing vomiting.\r\n\r\nAnother cathartic, undoubtedly in general very mild in its action, the\r\n_bitartrate of potash_, has also proved fatal, when taken in immoderate\r\nquantity. Thus, a man, endeavouring to quench his thirst and cool his\r\nstomach the morning after he had been drunk, ate a quarter of a pound of\r\nthis salt in lumps at once, and a good deal more throughout the day\r\nafterwards. He was in consequence attacked with incessant vomiting,\r\nfrequent purging, and other signs of irritation in the alimentary canal.\r\nHe died on the third day; and the stomach and bowels were found much\r\ninflamed.[1614]\r\n\r\nEven _common salt_ has been known to act as a poison when taken in large\r\nquantity. A striking instance of the kind occurred in London in\r\nSeptember, 1828. A man, who had been in the custom of exhibiting various\r\nfeats of gluttony, proposed to some of his comrades one afternoon to sup\r\na pound of _common salt_ in a pint of ale, and actually finished his\r\nnauseous dish, but not without being warned of his imprudence by an\r\nattack of vomiting in the middle of it. He was soon after seized with\r\nall the symptoms of irritant poisoning, and died within twenty-four\r\nhours. The stomach and intestines were found after death excessively\r\ninflamed.[1615] This remarkable case is not without its parallel. In\r\n1839, a girl in the North of England died in consequence of taking\r\nupwards of half a pound of salt as a vermifuge.[1616] Not long ago I met\r\nwith an instance of somewhat similar, but less violent effects. A\r\nstudent having taken upwards of two ounces of salt as an emetic,\r\ndissolved in a small quantity of water, was seized with acute burning\r\npain in the stomach, tenderness in the epigastrium and great anxiety,\r\nwithout any vomiting until he drank a large quantity of warm water as a\r\nremedy. Before I saw him he had vomited freely, but still suffered\r\nsevere, intermitting pain, which was removed by a large dose of muriate\r\nof morphia.\r\n\r\nIn France, though not hitherto, so far as I know, in Britain, several\r\ninstances have occurred of extensive sickness in particular districts,\r\nwhich have been traced to the accidental adulteration of _common salt_\r\nwith certain deleterious articles. In an investigation conducted by M.\r\nGuibourt, in consequence of several severe accidents having been\r\nproduced apparently by salt in Paris and at Meaux, oxide of arsenic was\r\ndetected;[1617] and this discovery was subsequently confirmed by MM.\r\nLatour and Lefrançois, who ascertained that the proportion of arsenic\r\nwas sometimes a quarter of a grain per ounce.[1618] Another singular\r\nadulteration which appears fully more frequent is with hydriodate of\r\nsoda. At a meeting of the Parisian Academy of Medicine in December,\r\n1829, a report was read by MM. Boullay and Delens, subsequent to an\r\ninquiry by M. Sérullas, into the nature of a sample of salt which\r\nappears to have occasioned very extensive ravages. In 1829, various\r\nepidemic sicknesses in certain parishes were suspected to have arisen\r\nfrom salt of bad quality. In the month of July no less than 150 persons\r\nin two parishes were attacked, some with pain in the stomach, nausea,\r\nslimy and even bloody purging, others with tension of the belly,\r\npuffiness of the face, inflammation of the eyes and swelling of the\r\nlegs; and in several parishes in the Department of the Marne a sixth\r\npart of the population was similarly affected. The salt being suspected\r\nto be the source of the mischief, as it had an unusual smell which some\r\ncompared to the effluvia of marshy ground, M. Sérullas analyzed it, and\r\nafter him MM. Boullay and Delens; and both analyses indicated the\r\npresence of a hundredth of its weight of hydriodate of soda, besides a\r\nlittle free iodine.[1619] Subsequently, in reference to the discovery of\r\narsenic by other chemists in different samples of suspected salt, M.\r\nSérullas repeated his analysis, but could detect none of that\r\npoison.[1620] Still more lately the whole subject has been investigated\r\nwith great care by M. Chevallier.[1621] M. Barruel states that he\r\nobserved the occasional adulteration of salt with some hydriodate\r\naccidentally in 1824, while preparing experiments for Professor Orfila’s\r\nlectures. He found it in two samples from different grocers’ shops in\r\nParis.[1622] No satisfactory explanation has yet been given of the\r\nsource of the adulteration with arsenic; but the presence of hydriodate\r\nof soda has been traced to the fraudulent use of impure salt from kelp\r\n[see p. 160].\r\n\r\nSome difference of opinion prevails among toxicologists in regard to the\r\nalleged deleterious qualities of _alum_. On the whole it scarcely\r\nappears so active as to deserve the name of a poison; yet, like other\r\nsalts, it may in large doses do serious injury. It merits particular\r\nmention among the present description of substances, partly on account\r\nof a trial at Paris, where dangerous effects were alleged to have been\r\nproduced by it, and partly for the physiological inquiries made on that\r\noccasion. A druggist supplied a lady by mistake with powder of burnt\r\nalum instead of gum-arabic; and the lady, who had long laboured under\r\nchronic derangement of the stomach and bowels, took a single dose of a\r\nsolution containing between ten and twenty grains of the salt. She\r\nimmediately complained of acute pain in the stomach and gullet, burning\r\nin the mouth, and nausea; the symptoms of a severe attack of\r\ninflammation in the stomach and bowels ensued; and she was not\r\nconsidered out of danger for several days. The druggist was accordingly\r\nprosecuted, and heavy damages claimed. The attending physician ascribed\r\nthe symptoms to the alum. But Marc and Orfila, who were consulted,\r\ndeclared that this was impossible except on the supposition that the\r\nlady had a very unusual sensibility of the stomach to irritating\r\nsubstances;—that it was a common thing to give three, four, and even\r\nfive times the quantity in the treatment of diseases, without any such\r\nconsequences resulting;—and that at the very time of the inquiry a\r\nphysician in Paris was using it to the amount of six or eight drachms in\r\na day. From an experimental inquiry conducted by Professor Orfila it\r\nappears, that large doses of calcined alum, such as one or even two\r\nounces, excite in dogs little more than one or two attacks of vomiting,\r\neven although retained between ten and thirty minutes,—that one ounce\r\nwill not excite any marked symptoms though secured in the stomach by a\r\nligature,—but that two ounces given in the same way prove fatal in five\r\nhours, under symptoms of excessive exhaustion and insensibility.[1623] A\r\nsimilar inquiry was instituted about the same time by M. Devergie, who\r\nseems, however, to have remarked more activity in alum than is indicated\r\nby Orfila’s experiments. He infers that two ounces may sometimes kill\r\ndogs, even though they vomit freely; that half that quantity is fatal if\r\nthe gullet be tied; that calcined alum is more active than a solution of\r\nthe salt; that it is a corrosive or irritant; and that probably man is\r\nmore sensible to its operation than the lower animals.[1624] Whatever\r\nmay be thought of the effects of alum on the animal body when\r\nadministered in large doses, it is plain from its frequent medicinal use\r\nas an internal astringent that it is not poisonous when given in small\r\ndoses, like that taken by the patient in the trial alluded to. I may add\r\nthat it appears very doubtful whether any injury accrues from the\r\nlong-continued use of very small doses. Bakers, it is well known, are in\r\nthe practice of using it in minute proportion for improving the\r\nwhiteness of bread; and it has been imagined that chronic disorders of\r\nthe stomach and bowels may consequently originate, by reason of its\r\nconstipating tendency. These fears, however, are not borne out by facts.\r\nEither the quantity is insufficient to do harm in the way supposed; or\r\nthe constitution becomes accustomed to the continual operation of the\r\nsalt, and does not suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n                             CLASS SECOND.\r\n                     OF NARCOTIC POISONS GENERALLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term narcotism has been used by different writers with different\r\nsignifications, but is now generally understood to denote the effects of\r\nsuch poisons as bring on a state of the system like that caused by\r\napoplexy, epilepsy, tetanus, and other disorders commonly called\r\nnervous. Narcotic poisons, therefore, are such as produce chiefly or\r\nsolely symptoms of a disorder of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which most narcotic poisons act has been well ascertained:\r\nthey act on the brain or spine or both by entering the blood-vessels.\r\nHence they are most active when most directly introduced into the blood,\r\nthat is, when injected into the veins; and when they are applied to an\r\nentire membranous surface, their energy is in the ratio of its absorbing\r\npower. Thus, when injected into the chest, they act more rapidly than\r\nwhen swallowed. According to the generally received opinion, they are\r\nconveyed with the blood to the brain and spine on which they act. But,\r\naccording to the views of Messrs. Morgan and Addison, they produce on\r\nthe inner coats of the blood-vessels a peculiar impression, which is\r\nconveyed to the centre of the nervous system along the nerves.\r\n\r\nThe usual symptoms in man and the higher order of animals are giddiness,\r\nheadache, obscurity or deprivation of the sight, stupor or perfect\r\ninsensibility, palsy of the voluntary muscles or convulsions of various\r\nkinds, and towards the close complete coma. The symptoms of each poison\r\nare pretty uniform, when the dose is the same. But each has its own\r\npeculiarities, either in the individual symptoms, or in the mode in\r\nwhich they are combined together.\r\n\r\nThe morbid appearances they leave in the dead body are commonly\r\ninsignificant. In the brain, where chiefly the physician is led from the\r\nsymptoms to expect unnatural appearances, the organs are in general\r\nquite healthy. Sometimes, however, the veins are gorged with blood, and\r\nthe ventricles and membranes contain serosity. The blood appears to be\r\nsometimes altered in nature; but the alteration is by no means\r\ninvariable, and sometimes none is remarked at all. Many of the\r\nstatements to be found in authors on the morbid appearances caused by\r\nnarcotics are far from being accurate.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to notice the genera of this class in their order,\r\nsome remarks must be premised on the principal diseases which resemble\r\nthem in the symptoms and morbid appearances. Of these the only diseases\r\nof much consequence are _apoplexy, epilepsy, inflammation of the brain,\r\nhypertrophy of the brain, inflammation of the spinal cord, and syncopal\r\nasphyxia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Of the Distinction between Apoplexy and Narcotic Poisoning._\r\n\r\n_Of the Symptoms._—The symptoms of apoplexy are almost exactly the same\r\nas those of the narcotic poisons, namely, more or less complete\r\nabolition of sense and the power of motion, frequently combined with\r\nconvulsions. This disease commonly arises from congestion or effusion of\r\nblood within the skull; but one variety of it, the nervous apoplexy of\r\nolder authors, or simple apoplexy of the moderns, is believed to be an\r\naffection of the brain, unaccompanied by any recognizable derangement of\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nApoplexy and narcotic poisoning may be often distinguished by the\r\nfollowing criterions:\r\n\r\n1. Apoplexy is sometimes preceded at considerable intervals by warning\r\nsymptoms, such as giddiness, headache, ringing in the ears, depraved\r\nvision, or partial palsy. But it is an error to suppose that warning\r\nsymptoms always occur; nay, if we may trust the experience of M.\r\nRochoux, they are by no means common: of sixty-three cases which came\r\nunder his notice nine only had distinct precursory symptoms.[1625]\r\nPoisoning with narcotics of course has not any precursory symptom except\r\nby fortuitous combination. And consequently, if warning symptoms have\r\noccurred, the presumption is, that the cause of death is a natural one.\r\n\r\n2. Apoplexy attacks chiefly the old. It is not, however, confined to the\r\nold. On the trial of Captain Donnellan for poisoning Sir T. Boughton,\r\nMr. John Hunter mentioned that he had met with two instances of death\r\nfrom apoplexy in young women; my colleague Dr. Alison has related to me\r\na similar case; Professor Bernt has described another of a young girl\r\nwho died apoplectic from extravasation of blood over the whole brain and\r\nin the ventricles also;[1626] and Mr. Greenhow, a surgeon of London, has\r\neven noticed a case of apoplexy from effusion of blood over the surface\r\nof the brain in a child two years and a half old.[1627] On this subject\r\nthe treatise of Rochoux supplies excellent information: of his\r\nsixty-three cases sixty-one were above thirty years of age, two less\r\nthan thirty, none younger than twenty.[1628] It is plain, therefore,\r\nthat apoplexy in young people is rare. On the other hand, a great\r\nproportion of cases of poisoning with the narcotics when they have been\r\ntaken intentionally (and such cases are most likely to lead to\r\nmedico-legal questions), has occurred among the young, especially of the\r\nfemale sex.\r\n\r\n3. The next criterion is, that apoplexy occurs chiefly among fat people.\r\nBut it is here mentioned only that the medical jurist may be cautioned\r\nagainst the belief that it is in all circumstances a correct criterion.\r\nUpon this particular Rochoux has furnished some satisfactory data. Among\r\nhis sixty-three patients thirty were of an ordinary habit, twenty-three\r\nwere of a thin, meager habit, and ten only were large, plethoric and\r\nfat.[1629] In receiving this statement, however, it is necessary to\r\nconsider, that although the vulgar idea, that most apoplectic people are\r\nfat, does not apply to persons in the rank of Rochoux’s patients, who\r\nwere mostly hospital inmates, yet it may apply better to the upper\r\nranks. For the same circumstances which predispose to apoplexy, namely,\r\ngreat strength, vigorous constitution and good digestive powers,\r\nlikewise predispose to corpulency, so that whenever the condition of\r\nlife permits the disposition to corpulency to be developed, the\r\nconnexion of apoplexy with it will appear.\r\n\r\n4. A fourth criterion is drawn from the relation which the appearance of\r\nthe symptoms bears to the last article of food or drink that was taken.\r\nI believe that the effects of the common narcotics, in the cases where\r\nthey prove fatal, begin not later than an hour, or at the utmost two\r\nhours, after they are taken; and in a great majority of instances they\r\nbegin in a much shorter time, namely, in fifteen or thirty minutes.\r\nHence if it can be proved that the nervous symptoms, under which a\r\nperson died, did not begin till several hours after he took food, drink\r\nor medicine, it appears almost, if not absolutely certain, that a\r\nnarcotic poison cannot have been the cause of death. To some narcotic,\r\nor rather narcotico-acrid poisons this rule certainly will not apply,\r\nsuch as the poisonous fungi and spurred rye; which seldom begin to act\r\nfor several hours, sometimes for not less than a day and a half. Neither\r\nwill the rule apply to poisoning with the deleterious gases, as their\r\naction has no connexion at all with eating or drinking. But these facts\r\ndo not form a material objection to the rule laid down; because the\r\ncircumstances under which cases of the kind occur are generally so\r\napparent, as at once to point out their real nature to a careful\r\ninquirer.\r\n\r\nIn regard to apoplexy as the disease which resembles most closely the\r\neffects of the narcotics, it was formerly stated that this disease is\r\napt to occur soon or immediately after taking a meal (p. 95).[1630] In\r\nthe greater number of such cases, however, where the meal has been the\r\nexciting cause of the disease, the symptoms have begun _immediately_\r\nafter, or even during a meal. This is very rarely the case with the\r\nsymptoms of narcotic poisoning, and never happens in respect to those of\r\nthe commonest of the narcotics, opium: An interval of 10, 15, 20 or 30\r\nminutes always occurs. The deleterious gases and hydrocyanic acid, with\r\nits compounds, are the only familiar narcotic poisons which act more\r\nswiftly.\r\n\r\n5. Another criterion relates to the progress of the symptoms. The\r\nsymptoms of narcotic poisoning advance for the most part gradually: but\r\nthose of apoplexy in general begin abruptly. Sometimes apoplexy\r\ncommences at once with deep sopor. Narcotic poisoning never begins in\r\nthat way, except in the instances of hydrocyanic acid and the narcotic\r\ngases; the sopor is at first imperfect, and it increases gradually,\r\nthough sometimes very rapidly. Apoplexy, however, does not always begin\r\nwith deep sopor; occasionally the sopor begins and increases like that\r\nof narcotism.\r\n\r\n6. Although there is a great resemblance between the symptoms of\r\napoplexy and those of narcotism, so far as regards their general\r\nfeatures, there are particulars which are not indeed always present, but\r\nwhich when present will help to distinguish the one from the other. When\r\nthe sopor of apoplexy is completely formed, it is rarely possible to\r\nrouse the patient to consciousness, and never, I believe, where the risk\r\nof confounding apoplexy with poisoning is greatest,—in the cases where\r\ndeath happens neither instantly, nor after the interval of a day, but in\r\na few hours. On the other hand, in many cases of poisoning with the\r\nnarcotics, and particularly with the commonest variety, opium, the\r\nperson may be roused from the deepest lethargy, if he is spoken to in a\r\nloud voice, or forcibly shaken for some time, or if water is injected\r\ninto his ear. Even in cases of poisoning with opium, however, the coma\r\nmay have continued too long to admit of this temporary restoration to\r\nsense; the susceptibility of being roused is not so often remarked in\r\nother varieties of narcotic poisoning; and in some, such as poisoning\r\nwith prussic acid, I am not aware that it has ever been remarked, at\r\nleast in fatal cases.\r\n\r\nThere are some other symptoms which in special cases may help to\r\ndistinguish narcotic poisoning from apoplexy. Thus in poisoning with\r\nopium convulsions are rare; in apoplexy they are common enough. Bloating\r\nof the countenance is likewise much more common in apoplexy than in\r\npoisoning with opium. In apoplexy, too, the pupil is generally dilated,\r\nwhile in poisoning with opium the pupil is almost always contracted. But\r\nsuch distinctions do not apply either to the narcotics as a class, or to\r\nall cases of any one kind of narcotic poisoning.\r\n\r\n7. In the last place, a useful criterion may be derived from the\r\nduration of the symptoms in fatal cases. I believe few people die of\r\npure narcotic poisoning who outlive twelve hours; and the greater number\r\ndie much sooner,—in eight, or six hours. Apoplexy often lasts a whole\r\nday, or even longer. On the other hand, the narcotic poisons very rarely\r\nprove so rapidly fatal as apoplexy sometimes does. Apoplexy, according\r\nto the vulgar opinion, may prove fatal instantly or in a few minutes.\r\nThe only late author of repute who maintains that opinion is M.\r\nDevergie. He mentions the case of an elderly man subject to somnolency,\r\nwho, after complaining for a short time of headache, became suddenly\r\npale, hung down his head, and expired immediately, and in whose body no\r\nother morbid appearance was found, except great congestion of the\r\ncerebral membranes.[1631] The best modern pathologists, however, deny\r\nthat apoplexy proves immediately fatal, and maintain with much apparent\r\nreason that when death is so sudden, the cause is commonly disease of\r\nthe heart, and not apoplexy.[1632] However this may be, it is at all\r\nevents certain that apoplexy may occasion death in considerably less\r\nthan an hour. Now the only narcotics in common use which can prove fatal\r\nso soon are the narcotic gases, and prussic acid. As to opium, the most\r\ncommon of the narcotic poisons, and by far the most important to the\r\nmedical jurist, the shortest duration I have yet seen recorded is three\r\nhours. Apoplexy often proves fatal in a much shorter time.\r\n\r\nFrom this enumeration of the criterions between apoplexy and the\r\nsymptoms produced by narcotics, the toxicologist will conclude, that few\r\ncases can occur in which he will not be able to give a presumptive\r\nopinion of the real cause from the symptoms only,—that in many instances\r\na diagnosis may be drawn with an approach to certainty,—and that on all\r\noccasions it will be possible to say without risk of error, whether\r\nthere are materials for forming a diagnosis at all,—a point which is of\r\ngreat moment when the criterions are not universally applicable.\r\n\r\n_Of the Morbid Appearances._—The next subject of inquiry is the\r\ndistinction between apoplexy and narcotic poisoning, as to the\r\nappearances after death. It has been already stated, that the narcotic\r\npoisons rarely produce very distinct morbid appearances,—that the\r\ngreatest extent of unnatural appearance they cause in the brain is\r\ncongestion of vessels,—and that the physical qualities of the blood\r\nappear to be altered, though not invariably.\r\n\r\n_Of Simple Apoplexy._—Apoplexy may, in the first place, occasion death\r\nwithout leaving any sign at all in the dead body. Cases of this sort\r\nwere called nervous apoplexy by the older authors; but for the purpose\r\nof avoiding a name that involves a theory as to their nature, they have\r\nbeen more appropriately termed by Dr. Abercrombie simple apoplexy. At\r\none time they were believed to be common. The researches of modern\r\npathologists, however, have shown that they are rare, and that the\r\napparent absence of morbid appearances may be often with justice\r\nascribed to an insufficient examination; for it is not always easy to\r\ndetect, without minute attention, two disorders little known till in\r\nrecent times, and sometimes closely allied in their symptoms to\r\napoplexy,—hypertrophy of the brain, and inflammation of its substance.\r\nOn this account some have even gone so far as to deny altogether the\r\nexistence of simple or nervous apoplexy; and M. Rostan, who is of this\r\nopinion, has supported it by the fact, that in the course of his\r\npathological researches he had examined no less than 4000 heads, and\r\nnever met with an instance of it.[1633] But although this statement,\r\nmade by so eminent a pathologist, is sufficient to prove the rarity of\r\nthe disease, it does not establish its non-existence in the face of\r\npositive observations, made by others after the phenomena and effects of\r\ncerebral inflammation were well known.\r\n\r\nAmong the modern authorities to whom reference may here be made for\r\nexamples of simple apoplexy, Dr. Abercrombie, M. Louis, my colleague Dr.\r\nAlison, and M. Lobstein, may be particularized. Dr. Abercrombie has seen\r\nfour cases,[1634] M. Louis has recorded three,[1635] M. Lobstein\r\none,[1636] and Dr. Alison informs me, that he has seen one and got the\r\nparticulars of another from the late Dr. Gregory. In several of these\r\ncases the individuals were at the time of the apoplectic seizure\r\naffected with other diseases, such as asthma, anasarca, or slight\r\nfebrile symptoms; but in four of them the coma commenced during a state\r\nof perfect health. I have myself seen two of the former class, one\r\noccurring during convalescence from a slight pleurisy, the other\r\nterminating a complicated case of pulmonary emphysema and catarrh,\r\ndiseased kidneys and anasarca. Reference may be also made under this\r\nhead to several cases of apoplexy described in Corvisart’s Journal, as\r\nconnected with the enormous accumulation of worms in the intestines.\r\nSuch a connexion is said to be common on the coast of Brittany; and one\r\nstriking instance is related of a young man, who, after an attack of\r\nheadache, vomiting, and loss of speech, died comatose in two days, and\r\nin whose body no unnatural appearance could be seen except a prodigious\r\nmass of worms in the small intestines.[1637]\r\n\r\nIn none of all the cases of apoplexy now under consideration was there\r\nfound within the head any appearance corresponding with the symptoms,\r\nexcept occasionally a slight turgescence of vessels.\r\n\r\nThis form of apoplexy, then, is a very important affection in a\r\nmedico-legal point of view. The possibility of its occurrence is in fact\r\nthe chief obstacle, which, in many cases involving the question of\r\npoisoning with narcotics, prevents the physician from coming to a\r\npositive decision on a review merely of symptoms and appearances after\r\ndeath. Instances will occur where it is impossible to draw a diagnosis\r\nbetween the natural and the violent form of death. And indeed it might\r\neven be a fair subject of inquiry, whether death from at least some\r\nnarcotic poisons, such as opium, is any thing else than death from\r\nsimple apoplexy.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned,—although too much importance ought not to be\r\nattached to the fact, as forming the ground of a diagnosis in certain\r\nrapid cases of narcotic poisoning,—that of the instances of simple\r\napoplexy referred to above none proved fatal in less than five hours.\r\nThis was Dr. Gregory’s case. Dr. Alison’s proved fatal in seven hours;\r\nM. Louis’s cases in eight, nine, and ten hours; one of Dr. Abercrombie’s\r\nin eight hours; the three others in about twenty-four hours; and M.\r\nLobstein’s in five days.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is, that simple apoplexy is undoubtedly very rare,\r\nmore particularly in persons who enjoy perfect health. Hence, although\r\nit is impossible to distinguish the effects of narcotics from this\r\ndisease by the appearances in the body after death, yet, when the\r\ngeneral evidence of poisoning is strong, and none of the medical\r\ncircumstances are at variance with the supposition of narcotic\r\npoisoning, the evidence of poisoning, as judged of by the jury from the\r\nwhole facts, medical and general, will be commonly sufficient,—so far as\r\nregards the possibility of death from simple apoplexy. For such a\r\nconcurrence of circumstances as is here supposed can scarcely be\r\noutweighed by a mere possibility of death from so rare a natural\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, in reference to charges and suspicions of\r\npoisoning during a state of ill health, that simple apoplexy occurring\r\nin the course of a considerable period of indifferent health is far from\r\nuncommon. Such incidents, however, ought not to be confounded with\r\nnarcotic poisoning, because the coma comes on gradually. From what I\r\nhave myself frequently observed, cases of this nature are often\r\nconnected with the granular disintegration of the kidneys, which has\r\nbeen brought under the notice of physicians by the able researches of\r\nDr. Bright. I have related two instances of the kind,[1638] and several\r\nothers have been since published by Dr. James Arthur Wilson.[1639] In\r\nnone of these could there have been any risk of mistaking the phenomena\r\nfor narcotic poisoning. But it may be well to advert to the subject here\r\nfor the sake of turning the attention of the profession to the propriety\r\nof examining the state of the kidneys in all medico-legal cases of death\r\nin a state of coma.\r\n\r\n_Of Congestive Apoplexy._—Apoplexy may, in the second place, leave in\r\nthe dead body no other sign but congestion of vessels within the head.\r\nThis form or variety of apoplexy is so generally admitted, that it is\r\nhardly necessary to mention special instances. But, for the sake of\r\nthose who may prefer special facts to general propositions, the two\r\nfollowing cases by M. Rostan are referred to. One of his patients,\r\nwithout any precursory symptom, was suddenly deprived of sense, soon\r\nbecame delirious and comatose, and expired in a day and a half. The\r\nother, also without any previous symptom, became rapidly comatose, and\r\ndied in twenty-four hours. In both the whole membranes were minutely\r\ninjected with blood; and in one the whole brain had also a rose-red\r\ncolour.[1640] In regard to the diagnosis between such cases and\r\npoisoning with narcotics, it must be remembered, that congestion of the\r\ncerebral vessels is considered by many a common effect of such poisons,\r\nand that therefore the diagnosis cannot be rested on the appearances in\r\nthe dead body. I have not perused a sufficient number of fatal cases of\r\ncongestive apoplexy to enable me to attempt a diagnosis; but, so far as\r\nI have gone, it appears to me, that this form of the disease, which is\r\nnot often fatal without extravasation also being produced, does not\r\ncause death till after an interval of nearly a day at least. Should this\r\nprove a general fact, it would form the ground of a diagnosis between\r\ncongestive apoplexy and many forms of narcotic poisoning, which, if\r\ndeath ensues, prove fatal much sooner.\r\n\r\n_Of Serous Apoplexy._—Apoplexy may, in the third place, produce serous\r\neffusion on the external surface, and in the ventricles of the brain.\r\nThis form of the disease, which has been named serous apoplexy, although\r\nnot very uncommon as an insulated affection, is for the most part united\r\nwith inflammation of the cerebral substance. Serous effusion is more\r\nfrequently the termination of an inflammatory disorder of the brain,\r\nthan of that deranged state which constitutes the apoplectic attack. But\r\nnevertheless it does occur in connexion with pure apoplexy, as may be\r\nseen, for example, on referring to Dr. Abercrombie’s work,[1641] or to\r\nBernt’s Contributions to Medical Jurisprudence,[1642] or to the Hospital\r\nReports of Dr. Bright.[1643] In such cases the only appearances have\r\nbeen the effusion of an unusual quantity of serum on the surface of the\r\nbrain, in its ventricles, and in the base of the skull. Cases of this\r\nsort agree very exactly as to the signs in the dead body with some cases\r\nof narcotic poisoning. When serous effusion is preceded by decided\r\napoplectic symptoms, the disease, so far as I have been able to inquire,\r\nis always of several days’ duration. But sometimes the symptoms are to\r\nthe very last obscure and different from those of apoplexy, as in an\r\ninstance related by Dr. Abercrombie.[1644]\r\n\r\n_Of Apoplexy from extravasation._—The last variety of apoplexy is that\r\nwhich leaves in the dead body extravasation of blood within the head.\r\nThis, the most common of all its forms, is very rarely imitated by\r\nnarcotic poisoning. A case, however, will be afterwards mentioned of\r\nextravasation produced apparently by poisoning with opium, another of\r\nextravasation caused by carbonic acid, another by poisonous fungus, and\r\nseveral by spirits. The existence, therefore, of extravasated blood is\r\nnot absolutely certain proof, but supplies, in relation to most\r\nnarcotics, a strong presumption of natural death.\r\n\r\nHere it will be necessary to add a word or two of caution regarding what\r\nare called apoplectic cells or cavities, containing blood in the brain.\r\nIf an apoplectic cell be found, it must not be at once considered as the\r\ncause of death. When blood is extravasated in the brain, the patient may\r\ngradually recover altogether, and the cell nevertheless continue full.\r\nSuch persons often die of a subsequent attack of apoplexy, or of\r\ninflammation around the cell. We can say with certainty, that an\r\napoplectic cell has been the occasion of death only when the blood is\r\nrecent, or when it is surrounded by signs of recent inflammation.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, as to the criterions derived from morbid appearances\r\nwithin the skull, for distinguishing poisoning with narcotics from\r\napoplexy.\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed to derive other criterions from the state of the\r\nblood. But on considering the effects of the individual poisons of the\r\nclass, it will appear that the state of the blood is by no means\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful to conclude this view of the distinctions between\r\npoisoning and apoplexy with the particulars of an interesting case, in\r\nwhich the medical witnesses fell into an egregious error by disregarding\r\nthe most palpable criterions. In 1841, an elderly gentleman at Chambéry\r\nin France, subject to apoplexy, one day after having made a hearty\r\ndinner and afterwards supped on bread, cheese, and white wine, was\r\nsuddenly seized with staggering immediately after finishing his wine,\r\nand soon lost all consciousness. Emetics and stimulants restored his\r\nfaculties so far as to enable him to say he felt better and had no pain;\r\nbut the tongue and mouth were drawn to the left side, and there was\r\ngreat prostration. Four hours after his first seizure the countenance\r\nbecame livid; he again became unconscious and insensible; the twisting\r\nof the mouth increased; and the left arm presented spasmodic\r\ncontraction. Blood-letting and other remedies were resorted to without\r\navail; the pulse, previously strong and regular, became gradually\r\nfeeble; and in six hours after his first illness he expired, without\r\never having had convulsions of any kind. On the body being examined\r\nseven days after death, great congestion was found in the vessels on the\r\nsurface of the brain; on raising the brain, a dense dark clot of the\r\nsize of a large egg escaped from the lower part of the ventricles; and\r\nan abundant extravasation of the same nature was found under the\r\n_tentorium cerebelli_.\r\n\r\nIt appears scarcely possible to find a more characteristic case than\r\nthis of apoplexy from extravasation. The slight intermission in the\r\nsymptoms was the only unusual circumstance. Yet because the inspectors\r\nremarked in various parts of the body a peculiar odour, which they could\r\nnot at the time characterise, but which they afterwards thought was the\r\nodour of bitter almonds,—and misled by the sudden invasion of the\r\nsymptoms instantly after a meal,—they gave their opinion that death had\r\narisen from some narcotic poison; a chemical examination was made of\r\nvarious textures of the body (not, however, of the contents of the\r\nstomach), which yielded obscure and very doubtful indications of\r\nhydrocyanic acid; poisoning with hydrocyanic acid was accordingly\r\ndeclared to have been the cause of death; and, in defiance of an able\r\nreport by Professor Orfila, pointing out the error of the primary\r\nwitnesses, the nephew and heir of the deceased was condemned.[1645] It\r\nis almost unnecessary to point out the impossibility of death having\r\narisen in this case from hydrocyanic acid. The length of time the\r\ndeceased survived, the want of convulsions, the presence of deflexion of\r\nthe mouth and tongue, the intermission of the symptoms, and the morbid\r\nappearances, all clearly indicate that death in the way supposed was\r\nimpossible; and the chemical evidence, which it would require too much\r\nspace to analyze here, was proved by Orfila to be completely\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Of the Distinction between Epilepsy and Narcotic Poisoning._\r\n\r\n_Of the Symptoms._—Epilepsy is distinguished from other diseases by the\r\nabolition of sense and by convulsions. It resembles closely the symptoms\r\ncaused by prussic acid, and by some of the narcotic gases, such as\r\ncarbonic acid gas and the asphyxiating gas of privies. It also bears the\r\nsame resemblance to the effects of many narcotico-acrid poisons, such as\r\nbelladonna, stramonium, hemlock, and others of the first group of that\r\nclass, also camphor, cocculus indicus, and the poisonous fungi.\r\n\r\nEpilepsy is in general a chronic disease, and for the most part ends\r\nslowly in insanity. But sometimes it proves fatal during a paroxysm. The\r\ncircumstances by which an epileptic fit may be distinguished from\r\nnarcotic poisoning are the following:\r\n\r\n1. The epileptic fit _is sometimes preceded by certain warnings_, such\r\nas stupor, a sense of coldness, or creeping, or of a gentle breeze\r\nproceeding from a particular part of the body towards the head.\r\nWarnings, however, are by no means universal. M. Georget, indeed, has\r\neven stated that they do not occur in more than five cases in the\r\nhundred.[1646] But this estimate probably underrates their frequency.\r\n\r\n2. The symptoms of the epileptic fit _almost always begin violently and\r\nabruptly_. The individual is suddenly observed to cry out, often to\r\nvomit, and instantly falls down in convulsions. The effects of the\r\nnarcotic poisons, if we except some cases of poisoning with hydrocyanic\r\nacid, the narcotic gases, and a few rare alkaloids, never begin\r\notherwise than gradually, though their progress towards their extreme of\r\nviolence is often rapid. This distinction is generally an excellent one.\r\nBut it will not apply so well to some cases of epilepsy in which the\r\nconvulsions are trivial. Esquirol says an epileptic fit may consist of\r\nnothing more than coma, with convulsive movements of the eyes, or lips,\r\nor chest, or a single finger.[1647] Still even then the coma generally\r\nbegins abruptly, so that if the case is seen from the beginning, it can\r\nhardly be mistaken for narcotic poisoning. Some forms of epilepsy, in\r\nwhich the fit is constituted merely by giddiness, staring, wandering of\r\nthe mind, and imperfect loss of recollection,[1648] might be confounded\r\nwith the milder forms of narcotic poisoning. But collateral\r\ncircumstances will scarcely ever be wanting to distinguish such cases\r\nfrom one another.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of narcotic poisoning which, in the violence and\r\nabruptness of their commencement, bear the closest resemblance to an\r\nepileptic attack, are some cases of poisoning with hydrocyanic acid or\r\nwith the deleterious gases. Both of these varieties, however, when they\r\nbegin so abruptly, are distinguished from a fatal paroxysm of epilepsy\r\nby the fourth characteristic to be mentioned presently; and besides, in\r\nabrupt cases of poisoning with hydrocyanic acid, the poison under\r\ncertain conditions will be found in the body; while in sudden poisoning\r\nwith the narcotic gases, the nature of the accident is rendered obvious\r\nto a cautious inquirer by the collateral circumstances.\r\n\r\n3. As in apoplexy, so in epilepsy the patient _in general cannot be\r\nroused_ by external stimuli. This, as already observed, is often,\r\nalthough certainly not always, practicable in cases of poisoning with\r\nnarcotics. Sometimes, too, in the epileptic fit a partial restoration of\r\nconsciousness may be effected by loud speaking, so that in reply to\r\nquestions the patient will roll his eyes or move his lips. It is\r\ntherefore to be understood in applying the present criterion, that it is\r\nonly a safe guide when, as in many cases of poisoning with opium, the\r\nindividual can be roused to a state of tolerably perfect consciousness.\r\n\r\n4. When a person dies in a fit of epilepsy, _the paroxysm generally\r\nlasts long_, sometimes more than a day. So far as I have been able to\r\nascertain (though on this point it must be confessed authors are\r\nsingularly silent), it never proves fatal in a shorter time than several\r\nhours, unless there have been many previous fits; and even then it\r\nrarely proves fatal more rapidly. I have met with a case which, after\r\nmany previous fits, proved fatal in little more than an hour.[1649] In\r\nan instance mentioned by Mr. Clifton of irregularly recurring epilepsy,\r\nthe patient after being exempt for four months was attacked twice a day\r\nfor four days, and during an interval of ease fell down in the street\r\nand died. General congestion and excessive softening of the brain were\r\nfound.[1650] I have met with a case very like this, where death was\r\nowing to enormous extravasation of blood into the ventricles. So rapid a\r\ntermination never occurs except after several paroxysms; and probably\r\nnever without well-marked appearances in the dead body. The variety of\r\npoisoning with which epilepsy is most apt to be confounded, poisoning\r\nwith hydrocyanic acid, has hitherto always proved fatal within\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, and can probably never prove fatal so late as\r\na whole hour after the symptoms begin, unless the dose has been small\r\nand given repeatedly. Poisoning with the gas of privies,—another\r\nvariety, which sometimes imitates precisely a fit of epilepsy, appears\r\nnot to prove fatal in its convulsive form later than two hours after the\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\n5. M. Esquirol, a writer of high authority, says that epilepsy _very\r\nrarely proves fatal in the first paroxysm_. I suspect it may be said\r\nthat the first paroxysm never proves fatal. For the cases considered and\r\ndescribed as such have been either inflammation of the brain or its\r\nmembranes, or hypertrophy of the brain, or inflammation of the spinal\r\ncord, or effusion of serum or blood into the spinal canal, or worms in\r\nthe intestines,—all of which may be known by the morbid appearances. I\r\nhave also seen cases of continued fever with typhomania and convulsions,\r\nwhich might have been considered by a careless observer examples of\r\nepilepsy fatal in the first fit. On the present characteristic it would\r\nbe wrong to speak with confidence, as the question regarding the\r\npossible fatality of epilepsy in the first fit must depend greatly on\r\nthe degree of extension given to the term epilepsy. I can only say, that\r\nin the course of reading I have not hitherto met with an instance fatal\r\nin the first paroxysm, which might not have been referred by the morbid\r\nappearances to one or other of the diseases mentioned above.\r\n\r\n_Of the Morbid Appearances._—With regard to the morbid appearances found\r\nin the bodies of epileptics, much difference of opinion prevails among\r\npathologists. The most frequent are tumours within the cranium,\r\nexcrescences from the bone or dura mater, concretions in the brain\r\nitself, or abscesses there, and effusion into the ventricles or on the\r\nsurface of the brain. Other appearances which have also been remarked\r\nare probably little connected with the disease; and at all events have\r\nbeen often seen when epilepsy did not precede death.[1651]\r\n\r\nThe morbid appearances connected with epilepsy are not always to be\r\nlooked for within the head. The cause which produces the fit is often\r\nsome irritation in distant organs.—The presence of worms in the\r\nintestines of children may occasion fatal epilepsy. It is believed also\r\nthat they may cause fatal epilepsy even in adults; and whether their\r\npresence has been the cause of death or not, it is certain that they\r\nhave been found enormously accumulated in the stomach or intestines of\r\nadult epileptic subjects.[1652] The most recent information on this\r\nsubject is furnished by M. Gaultier de Claubry. In a girl seven years\r\nold, who died of convulsions in six days, he found eleven _lumbrici_ in\r\nthe general cavity of the belly, and the coats of the stomach perforated\r\nwith holes, in some of which other worms were sticking. In another child\r\nof the same age, who died in seven days of convulsions, he found\r\nthirty-six worms in the peritoneal sac, a great mass of them in the\r\nstomach, and twenty-seven making their way through holes in its\r\ncoats.[1653] In a singular case related by M. Lepelletier of a boy\r\ntwelve years old, who died of convulsions in four days, the only morbid\r\nappearance found was a perforation of the gullet six lines in diameter,\r\nthrough which two lumbrici had made their way into a cavity in the\r\nmiddle right lobe of the lungs, while another was sticking in the hole,\r\nsix more occupied the lower part of the gullet, and three lay in the\r\nstomach.[1654]—The irritation of teething may also excite epilepsy, and\r\nin cases where it has proved fatal may be recognized by the redness and\r\nswelling of the gum, by the tooth being on the point of piercing the\r\nalveolar process, and by the turgescence of vessels around.[1655]—A\r\nwell-known but rather rare cause is the presence of some hard substance\r\nin the course of a nerve. This variety, like those already mentioned,\r\nmay prove fatal in the fit, as appears from the following interesting\r\ncase. A stout young woman became suddenly liable to epilepsy, and, after\r\nsuffering repeated fits in the course of twenty months, died comatose in\r\na paroxysm of thirty-three hours’ duration. The fits having always begun\r\nwith acute pain in a particular part of the thigh, this part of the body\r\nwas carefully examined, and a bony tumour as big as a nut was found on a\r\nbranch of the sciatic nerve.[1656]—Other appearances might likewise be\r\nhere enumerated, which have been supposed the cause of symptomatic\r\nepilepsy.[1657] But few of these have been so thoroughly ascertained as\r\nto be allowed much influence on a medico-legal opinion.\r\n\r\nIt cannot, I apprehend, be denied, that in many cases of epilepsy no\r\ndecided morbid appearance is to be found in the body; and that in many\r\nothers the appearances are either so equivocal as not to be\r\nsatisfactorily recognized in any circumstances, or so hidden in their\r\nsituation that they may escape notice, unless the inspector’s attention\r\nbe drawn to the particular spot by a knowledge of the symptoms.\r\n\r\nHence in actual questions as to the occurrence of narcotic poisoning\r\nwhen the symptoms resemble epilepsy, it will be seldom possible to found\r\non the absence of morbid appearances more than a presumptive opinion\r\nthat death did not proceed from the natural cause. It is right to\r\nremember, however, that in considering the absence of morbid appearances\r\nin reference to the diagnosis of narcotic poisoning and epilepsy, the\r\nattention should be confined to cases of epilepsy which prove fatal\r\nduring the fit. Now I suspect no such case ever occurs, at least in\r\nadults, without an adequate cause being discoverable in the dead body,\r\neither in the head, or in the course of some nerve, or in the\r\naccumulation of worms in the intestines. This statement must not be\r\nconsidered as made with confidence; but it deserves investigation.\r\n\r\nFrom all that has now been said on the subject of epilepsy as a disease\r\nwhich imitates many varieties of narcotic poisoning, the medical jurist\r\nwill probably arrive at the conclusion, that, although a diagnosis\r\ncannot always be drawn with certainty, yet in numerous cases the\r\nconsideration of the symptoms and appearances after death will enable\r\nhim to say positively that poisoning is out of the question, and in many\r\nothers that poisoning is highly probable.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of the Distinction between Meningitis and Narcotic Poisoning._\r\n\r\nInflammation of the inner membranes of the brain, which constitutes the\r\n_acute hydrocephalus_ or acute _meningitis_ of authors, is not in\r\ngeneral apt to cause much ambiguity; for its progress is commonly\r\ngradual, well-marked and less rapid than most cases of narcotic\r\npoisoning: and the appearances in the dead body, such as effusion of\r\nserum, lymph or pus on the outer surface of the brain or in the\r\nventricles, are for the most part obvious.\r\n\r\nDr. Abercrombie, however, has described a form of it occurring among\r\nchildren during the existence of other diseases, particularly of the\r\nchest, which might be the cause of perplexity; for its course is\r\nsometimes finished within a day, its symptoms are delirium, convulsions\r\nand coma intermingled, and the only morbid appearance is congestion of\r\nvessels on the surface and in the substance of the brain.[1658] The\r\naffection now alluded to imitates closely, both in its progress and in\r\nits signs after death, some varieties of poisoning with the vegetable\r\nnarcotico-acrids, such as belladonna, stramonium, and hemlock. But the\r\nlatter cases, when they prove fatal, seldom last nearly so long as a\r\nday, while the instances of meningitis under consideration rarely cause\r\ndeath within twenty-four hours. Dr. Abercrombie also notices a parallel\r\ndisease occurring among adults; but it is in them always marked by a\r\nconsiderably longer, though often more obscure course.[1659]\r\n\r\nDr. Bright takes notice of a similar affection under the title of\r\n“Arachnitis with excessive irritability” occurring chiefly among very\r\nintemperate people, but independently of previous disease. In general\r\nthe disorder has a well-marked course of at least several days’\r\nduration. But in two of the instances he has given the early stage was\r\nvery obscure, the only symptoms having been headache and sickness of no\r\ngreat severity for four or five days; after which delirium came suddenly\r\non, and was followed by coma, and by death within thirty-six or forty\r\nhours. The sole appearances found within the head were some serous\r\neffusion and vascularity on the surface of the brain and in the\r\nventricles.[1660] To these illustrations may be added the heads of a\r\nremarkable case which occurred here in the person of an eminent lawyer,\r\nand for the particulars of which I am indebted to Dr. Maclagan. For\r\nthree days there had been occasional headache, not great enough to\r\nprevent him pursuing his ordinary avocations, yet becoming so\r\ntroublesome on the morning of the third day as to induce him to have\r\nleeches applied. But next morning he was seized rather suddenly with\r\nquickly increasing coma, and in forty hours more he expired. In this\r\ninstance the whole surface of the arachnoid membrane, both over the\r\nhemisphere and in the ventricles, was found lined with soft,\r\nyellowish-green lymph.\r\n\r\nIn such cases it is apparent that an inspection after death will often\r\nunfold their real nature, where the history of the symptoms may leave it\r\nin doubt. But even without an inspection it is not likely that a careful\r\nphysician could mistake them for narcotic poisoning; for independently\r\nof other considerations, the severe symptoms are ushered in by a\r\nprecursory stage of ill health, commonly indicating an obscure affection\r\nof the head, and such as no one but a careless observer could fail to\r\ndiscover and appreciate.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable, however, that acute meningitis may seem to prove\r\nsuddenly fatal, in consequence of its course being in a great measure\r\nlatent. The following case reported by Mr. Davies of Somers Town, seems\r\nof this nature. A woman, who had previously complained only of slight\r\nheadache, was attacked after breakfast with violent vomiting for half an\r\nhour, when she fell down, and immediately expired. After death there was\r\nfound great gorging of the vessels of the cerebral membranes, with\r\nopacity and thickening of the pia mater and arachnoid coats, and an\r\neffusion of nearly five ounces of bloody serum under the dura\r\nmater.[1661] Such a case might give rise to great perplexity in a charge\r\nof poisoning, until the examination of the body unfolded its true\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nI should scarcely have thought it necessary to mention _chronic\r\nmeningitis_ among the diseases apt to imitate the effects of narcotic\r\npoisons, because it is commonly marked by a long and distinct course.\r\nBut the following case, for which I am indebted to Dr. Arnoldi of\r\nMontreal, will show that, like other diseases of the head, chronic\r\nmeningitis may be latent in its early stage, and may, after developing\r\nitself, terminate in a day, and then in some measure imitate poisoning\r\nwith narcotics. A middle-aged female, subject for a twelvemonth to a\r\npurulent discharge from the left ear, and occasional headache, which was\r\nsupposed to be rheumatic, was seized one morning with acute pain in the\r\nhead, followed in a few hours by convulsions and tendency to coma; under\r\nwhich symptoms she died within twenty hours, although treated actively\r\nfrom the commencement. On dissection, the brain and pia mater were found\r\nhealthy, except at the part corresponding with the petrous portion of\r\nthe left temporal bone, where the brain was a little softened. The\r\ncorresponding part of the temporal bone and the adjacent part of the\r\noccipital were completely denuded and covered with pus, which had\r\nestablished a passage for itself into the cavity of the ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Of the Distinction between Inflammation of the Brain and Narcotic\r\n                              Poisoning._\r\n\r\nInflammation of the brain itself, the _ramollissement_ of French\r\nwriters, occasionally excites symptoms not unlike those produced by some\r\nnarcotic poisons; and in a few instances its course has appeared to be\r\nequally short. It requires particular notice, because the appearances\r\nleft in the dead body are sometimes apt to escape observation.\r\n\r\nThis disease in its well-marked form has been noticed by various authors\r\nfrom Morgagni downwards. But the first regular accounts of it were given\r\nin 1818 by Dr. Abercrombie,[1662] and in 1819 by M. Rostan[1663] of\r\nParis, and Professor Lallemand[1664] of Montpellier. Its symptoms are\r\nallied to those of apoplexy and epilepsy. But the comatose state is\r\ngenerally preceded by delirium or imperfect palsy, and often by a\r\nfebrile state of the circulation. Contraction of the voluntary muscles,\r\nonce supposed to be a distinguishing sign of this disease, is neither\r\nessential nor peculiar to it. In the dead body it is recognized by the\r\npresence either of an abscess in the brain,—or more commonly of a\r\nnucleus of disorganized cerebral tissue surrounded by unnatural redness\r\nor softness,—or sometimes of a clot of blood surrounded by similar\r\nsoftening. Occasionally, when the disease kills in its early stage,\r\nnothing is found but redness of a part of the brain, and slight\r\nsoftening of the tissue, recognizable only by scraping it with the edge\r\nof the scalpel.\r\n\r\nIn the form in which it is commonly seen, and as described by Rostan and\r\nLallemand from a great number of cases, it can hardly be confounded with\r\nthe effects of narcotic poisons; for its course is much slower, being\r\nseldom less than several days when it proves fatal.[1665] Yet in some\r\ninstances it may prove fatal instantly. Lancisi notices the case of an\r\nItalian nobleman, who after an apoplectic fit became liable to frequent\r\nattacks of lethargy,—who at length died quite suddenly more than a year\r\nafterwards,—and in whose brain an organized clot was found, with\r\nextensive suppuration of the brain around it.[1666] An unequivocal case\r\nof the same kind has been related by Mr. Dickson, a navy-surgeon. An\r\nelderly sailor, who for months before had done duty, eaten his rations,\r\nand drunk his grog as usual, suddenly dropped down while in the act of\r\npulling his oar, and died at once; and after death there was found in\r\nthe middle lobes of the brain an extensive abscess, which had made its\r\nway to the surface.[1667] Such cases might, in certain circumstances, be\r\nmistaken for the effects of large doses of hydrocyanic acid; but the\r\nmorbid appearances are of course quite characteristic. M. Louis has\r\nrelated an instance like the last two, but where the disease was\r\naltogether latent. His patient after a long illness died of diseased\r\nheart, the ventricles of which communicated together. He never had a\r\nsymptom of disorder of the head; yet on dissection an extensive recent\r\nsoftening was found in the right _corpus striatum_ and another in the\r\nright _thalamus_.[1668]\r\n\r\nNone of the treatises I have seen on the subject make mention of a\r\nvariety of this disease intermediate between suddenly fatal cases and\r\nthose which last several days,—a form in which the patient’s illness\r\nendures for a few hours only, and which, both in the special symptoms\r\nand in their course, imitates exactly the effects of some narcotics. Two\r\nsuch cases have come under my notice, both of them judicial, poisoning\r\nhaving been suspected. One of them proved fatal in an hour and a half,\r\nthe individual having previously been in excellent health; and the only\r\nappearance of disease was softening of a considerable part of the\r\nsurface of the brain where it lies over the left orbit. The other was\r\nmore remarkable in its circumstances. In November, 1822, a man, who had\r\npreviously enjoyed excellent health, was found one morning in a low\r\nlodging-house in the Lawnmarket comatose, and convulsed; and he died\r\nseven hours afterwards. The neighbours spread a report, that the woman\r\nof the house had poisoned him, with the view of selling the body; and by\r\nan odd coincidence the police, when they went to apprehend the woman,\r\nfound an anatomist hid in a closet. The body was judicially examined by\r\nSir W. Newbigging and myself; and we found an ulcer on the forepart of\r\nthe left hemisphere of the brain, and a small patch of softening on each\r\nmiddle lobe.\r\n\r\nIt is only in cases like the last two that the disease is likely to be\r\nmistaken for the effects of poison; and the morbid appearances will at\r\nonce distinguish them. But it is requisite to remember that softening of\r\nthe brain when not far advanced is apt to escape notice, as it is not\r\nnecessarily attended with a change in the colour of the diseased part.\r\nIn the first of the two cases I have related, the cause of death was\r\nvery nearly assumed to have been simple apoplexy, when at length the\r\ntrue disorder was unexpectedly noticed. I presume, indeed, that strictly\r\nspeaking, both of the cases which came under my notice ought to be\r\nconsidered as simple apoplexy excited by pre-existing _ramollissement_.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Of the Distinction between Hypertrophy of the Brain and Narcotic\r\n                              Poisoning._\r\n\r\nThis disease is not here mentioned, because its symptoms and progress\r\nresemble very closely those of poisoning with the narcotics; for it\r\ncauses epileptic symptoms, which, besides that they are preceded for\r\nsome time by other head affections, very seldom prove fatal in less than\r\nthree days. But some notice of it is necessary, because the disease is\r\nrare and of recent discovery, so that the appearances left by it in the\r\ndead body may escape observation. Besides, the physician is at present\r\nimperfectly acquainted with it, and therefore, when a more extensive\r\ncollection of cases shall have been made, it may be found to prove at\r\ntimes fatal so rapidly as to admit of being confounded with narcotic\r\npoisoning. Hypertrophy of the brain, it is true, is always a chronic or\r\nslow disease, but, like other diseases of the brain, its early stages\r\nmay possibly be so completely latent that the patient may appear to die\r\nof a few hours’ illness. This, however, must be left to the\r\ndetermination of future experience. The most rapid case yet published\r\nproved fatal twenty-four hours after the first appearance of symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe appearances left in the body are increased density and firmness of\r\nthe whole brain or a part of it,—flattening of the convolutions on their\r\nouter surface, so that their grooves are almost obliterated and the\r\ninvesting membrane uncommonly dry,—unusual emptiness of the\r\nblood-vessels of the brain and its membranes,—and a protrusion of the\r\nbrain upwards on removal of the skull-cap, as if the organ were too\r\nlarge for its containing cavity.[1669]\r\n\r\nSome pathologists doubt the existence of hypertrophy of the brain as a\r\ndistinct disease, and conceive that the appearance of flattening of the\r\nconvolutions is produced by serum effused between the dura mater and\r\narachnoid membrane. But this explanation will not account for those\r\ncases in which it is expressly stated that little or no fluid was to be\r\nfound in any part of the brain or in the base of the skull.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Of the Distinction between Diseases of the Spinal Cord and Narcotic\r\n                              Poisoning._\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to say much on the acute diseases of the spinal\r\ncord, which are apt to be confounded with the effects of narcotic\r\npoisons. The diseases are extravasation of blood into the spinal canal,\r\ninflammation of the membranes, and inflammation [_ramollissement_] of\r\nthe cord itself. These disorders are commonly marked by obvious and\r\ncharacteristic symptoms, as well as a much slower course than that of\r\nthe affections induced by narcotic poisons. But occasionally they\r\napproach closely the characters of some of the slow cases of narcotic\r\npoisoning,—palsy being absent, the leading symptoms consisting of\r\ndelirium, convulsions, and coma, and the fatal event occurring within\r\nthe third day. Dr. Abercrombie and M. Ollivier have related examples of\r\nthe kind arising from extravasation of blood,[1670] serous\r\neffusion,[1671] and softening of the cord.[1672] Such cases are\r\nexceedingly rare; but the possibility of their occurrence should impose\r\non the medical jurist the necessity of examining the spine with care in\r\nall judicial cases of alleged narcotic poisoning, especially when death\r\nhas not been rapid.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Of the Distinction between syncopal Asphyxia, and Narcotic Poisons._\r\n\r\nThe only other natural disease requiring notice under the present head\r\nis the _Asphyxia Idiopathica_ of the late Mr. Chevallier. It may be the\r\ncause of embarrassment in questions regarding narcotic poisoning, when\r\nthe course of the symptoms to their fatal termination is rapid, and was\r\nnot witnessed by any person; for it causes death with equal rapidity,\r\nand its signs in the dead body are very obscure. It has been observed\r\nchiefly among women in the latter months of pregnancy, or soon after\r\ndelivery; but it has also been known to attack the male sex. It\r\ngenerally commences during a state of perfect health, and is seldom\r\npreceded by any warning of danger. The person suddenly complains of\r\nslight sickness, giddiness, and excessive faintness, immediately seems\r\nto sleep or swoon away, and expires gently without a struggle. The only\r\nappearance of note found in the dead body is unusual flaccidity and\r\nemptiness of the heart.[1673] But even these slight appearances are not\r\nconstant; for in a case related by Rochoux of a woman who, while in a\r\nstate of perfect health, suddenly grew pale, slipped off her chair, and\r\ndied on the spot, the auricles of the heart contained a great deal of\r\nblood.[1674] This singular disorder appears to consist of nothing else\r\nthan a mortal tendency to fainting; and it may prove fatal either in the\r\nfirst fit of syncope, or after an hour and a half.—Under the same head\r\nare probably to be arranged the cases of sudden death described by M.\r\nDevergie under the title of Death by Syncope. He has given scarcely any\r\naccount of the circumstances attending death; but it may be inferred\r\nfrom his classification of the cases that fainting immediately preceded\r\nit. In all of them he found blood in both sides of the heart; and the\r\nblood, contrary to what happens in other kinds of sudden death, had\r\nseparated into clear serum, and fibrin free of colouring\r\nmatter.[1675]—Under the same head also may be noticed a denomination of\r\ncases, which, though alluded to before by various pathologists, were\r\nfirst distinctly characterized by M. Ollivier, where death is caused on\r\na sudden, apparently by the disengagement of a large quantity of\r\naëriform fluid from the blood in the heart and great vessels. Among the\r\ninstances described by Ollivier, it appears that death repeatedly\r\noccurred quite suddenly while the individuals enjoyed sound health; and\r\nthe only appearances of any note found in the body were tympanitic\r\ndistension of the heart, absence of blood there and in the great\r\nvessels, and the existence of a gaseous fluid in numerous globules\r\nthroughout the blood-vessels of the brain. The circumstances of death\r\nand the appearances in the dead body are much the same with those\r\nobserved from the admission of air into the veins during surgical\r\noperations. A case of this kind, owing to its suddenness, might be\r\nconfounded with the effects of the more active narcotic poisons, such as\r\nhydrocyanic acid, especially as its characters in the dead body might\r\nescape notice.[1676]\r\n\r\nDeath often takes place from sudden syncope in _organic diseases of the\r\nheart_. Such cases may be confounded with the most rapid variety of\r\npoisoning with hydrocyanic acid; and if the duration of the symptoms\r\npreceding death is unknown, they may give rise to a suspicion of\r\npoisoning generally. But they are at once distinguished by the morbid\r\nappearances. A trivial organic derangement may be the occasion of\r\ninstant death.\r\n\r\nThe genera comprehended in the class of narcotics are opium, henbane,\r\nlettuce-opium, solanum, hydrocyanic acid, and the deleterious gases. Of\r\nthese genera the last is by no means a pure one, for it includes many\r\ngases which act as irritants only; but it is more convenient to consider\r\nthem together, than to distribute them into separate classes. Some other\r\nvegetable substances besides henbane, lettuce-opium, and solanum,\r\npossess nearly the same properties; but as they likewise cause\r\nirritation, they are arranged more appropriately in the next class, the\r\nnarcotico-acrids.\r\n\r\nMost narcotic vegetables owe their poisonous properties to a peculiar\r\nprinciple, probably of an alkaline nature, and slightly different in\r\neach. This discovery was made with regard to opium in 1812; and the\r\ndiscovery of the active principle in that drug has been followed by the\r\ndetection of analogous principles in most narcotics, as well as in many\r\nnarcotico-acrids.\r\n\r\nThese principles are generally crystalline, soluble in alcohol and the\r\nacids, little soluble in water, free from mineral admixture, and\r\nentirely destructible by heat. When purified with the greatest care,\r\nthey still retain decided alkaline properties; but on account of their\r\nnumber and the low power of neutralization their alkaline nature was\r\nlong denied; and they have been conventionally styled alkaloids.\r\n\r\nIn their natural state they exist in combination with various ternary\r\nacids, some of which are peculiar; and they are likewise intimately\r\nblended, or more probably united chemically, with other inert principles\r\nof the vegetable kingdom, particularly resinous and extractive matters,\r\nto which they adhere with great obstinacy.\r\n\r\nThey are all highly energetic, and generally concentrate in themselves\r\nthe leading properties of the substance from which they are obtained.\r\n\r\nThe experiments, which have led to the conclusion, that the narcotic\r\npoisons act on the brain by entering the blood-vessels, have been\r\nrepeated with their alkaloids, and have yielded similar results. But the\r\nalkaloids are in equal quantities much more energetic than the crude\r\npoisons. Their effects indeed are truly formidable, and some well\r\nauthenticated instances of their action appear hardly less marvellous\r\nthan the most extravagant notions entertained in ancient times of the\r\noperation of poisons. One of them, the principle of nux vomica, which,\r\nhowever, does not belong to the present class, is so active that in all\r\nprobability a man might be killed with the third part of a grain in less\r\nthan fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to detect some of the vegetable alkaloids; and it\r\nis fortunate, therefore, that they are rare, and not to be procured but\r\nby complex processes.\r\n\r\nChemical analysis does not by any means supply so good evidence of\r\npoisoning with the narcotics as it does of poisoning with the irritants.\r\nTheir chemical properties are not very characteristic, and they are not\r\nwell developed unless with a larger quantity of the poison than will\r\nusually be met with in medico-legal investigations. This remark,\r\nhowever, does not apply universally; and it is probable, that, as\r\norganic analysis goes on improving, better and more delicate processes\r\nwill be discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n                        OF POISONING WITH OPIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the medical jurist opium is one of the most important of poisons;\r\nsince there is hardly any other whose effects come more frequently under\r\nhis cognizance. It is the poison most generally resorted to by the timid\r\nto accomplish self-destruction, for which purpose it is peculiarly well\r\nadapted on account of the gentleness of its operation. It has also been\r\noften the source of fatal accidents, which naturally arise from its\r\nextensive employment in medicine. It has likewise been long very\r\nimproperly employed to create amusement. And in recent times it has been\r\nmade use of to commit murder, and to induce stupor previous to the\r\ncommission of robbery. Mr. Burnett, in his work on Criminal Law, has\r\nmentioned a trial for murder in 1800, in which the prisoners were\r\naccused of having committed the crime by poisoning with opium; and\r\nalthough a verdict of _not proven_ was returned, there is little doubt\r\nthat the deceased, an adult, was poisoned in the way supposed. A few\r\nyears ago, a remarkable trial took place at Paris, where poisoning was\r\nalleged to have been effected by means of the alkaloid principle of\r\nopium; and the prisoner, a young physician of the name of Castaing, was\r\ncondemned and executed.\r\n\r\nIn several parts of Britain during the last fifteen years many persons\r\nhave been brought into great danger by opium having been administered as\r\na narcotic to facilitate robbery; and some have actually been killed. In\r\nDecember, 1828, a conviction was obtained in the Judiciary Court of\r\nEdinburgh for this crime, in which instance the persons who had taken\r\nthe opium recovered. A fatal case, which was strongly suspected to be of\r\nthe same nature, was submitted to me by the sheriff of this county in\r\n1828; but sufficient evidence could not be procured. In July, 1829, a\r\nman Stewart and his wife were condemned, and subsequently executed for\r\nthe same crime, the person to whom they gave the opium having been\r\nkilled by it. And about a year afterwards a similar instance occurred at\r\nGlasgow, for which a man Byers and his wife were condemned at the Autumn\r\nCircuit of 1831.\r\n\r\n\r\n        SECTION I.—_Of the Chemical History and Tests of Opium._\r\n\r\nOpium is the inspissated juice of the capsules of the _Papaver\r\nsomniferum_. It has a reddish-brown colour, and a glimmering lustre on a\r\nfresh surface. It is soft and plastic when recent; but if pure, may be\r\ndried so as to become brittle. Its smell is strong and quite peculiar.\r\nIt has a very bitter and most peculiar taste. In consequence of this\r\ntaste one would suppose it no easy matter to administer opium secretly.\r\nThe plan resorted to by thieves and robbers seems to be, to deaden the\r\nsense of taste by strong spirits, and then to ply the person with porter\r\nor ale drugged with laudanum, or the black drop, which possesses less\r\nodour.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the chemical history of opium will be confined\r\nin a great measure to the leading properties of the principles, in which\r\nits active qualities are concentrated, or which are likely by their\r\nchemical characters to supply proof of its presence.\r\n\r\nThe common solvents act readily on opium. Water dissolves its active\r\nprinciples even at low temperatures. So does alcohol. So particularly do\r\nthe mineral and vegetable acids when much diluted. Ether removes from it\r\nlittle else than one of its active principles, narcotine. By the action\r\nof these agents are procured various preparations in common use.\r\n_Laudanum_ is a spirituous infusion, and contains the active ingredients\r\nof a twelfth part of its weight of opium. _Scotch Paregoric Elixir_, a\r\nsolution in ammoniated spirit, is only one-fifth of the strength of\r\nlaudanum; and _English Paregoric_, tincture of opium and camphor for its\r\nchief ingredients, is four times weaker still. _Wine of opium_ contains\r\nthe soluble part of a sixteenth of its weight. The _black drop_ and\r\n_Battley’s sedative liquor_ are believed to be solutions of opium in\r\nvegetable acids, and to possess, the former four, the latter three times\r\nthe strength of laudanum. But their strength has been greatly\r\nexaggerated; neither of them, according to my own experience, being\r\nabove half what is supposed. The juice and infusion of the garden poppy\r\nare also powerfully narcotic, so as even to have caused death both when\r\ngiven by the mouth and in the way of injection.[1677] Many other\r\npharmaceutic preparations contain opium.\r\n\r\nIf opium be infused in successive portions of cold water, the water\r\ndissolves all its poisonous principles, and also a peculiar acid\r\npossessing characteristic chemical properties. These principles are\r\nseparated by means of the alkalis, the alkaline carbonates, or the\r\nalkaline earths. The most important of them are _morphia_, the chief\r\nalkaloid of opium,—_narcotine_, a feeble poison, not an alkaloid,—a\r\npeculiar acid, termed _meconic acid_,—and a _resinoid substance_. Other\r\ncrystalline principles also exist in opium, though apparently in too\r\nsmall proportion either to affect its action or to be available in\r\nmedico-legal analysis as the means of detecting the drug. These are\r\ncodeïa, meconine, narceïne, paramorphia, and porphyroxine.\r\n\r\nOf the various principles now indicated it is necessary to notice here\r\nonly morphia, narcotine, codeïa, porphyroxine and meconic acid. They\r\nrequire mention either as being active poisons, or because a knowledge\r\nof their leading characters may be useful in conducting a medico-legal\r\nanalysis in a case of poisoning with opium.\r\n\r\nMeconic acid, as procured by evaporation, is usually in little scales of\r\na pale brown or yellowish tint, being rendered so by adhering resin or\r\nextractive matter; but when nearly colourless, it forms long, extremely\r\ndelicate tabular crystals, which in mass have a fine silky appearance\r\nlike spermaceti. 1. When heated in a tube, it is partly decomposed, and\r\npartly sublimed; and the sublimate condenses in filamentous, radiated\r\ncrystals. 2. When dissolved even in a very large quantity of water, the\r\nsolution acquires an intense cherry-red colour with the perchloride of\r\niron. The sublimed crystals have the same property. Only one other acid\r\nis so affected, namely, the sulpho-cyanic, a very rare substance. It has\r\nbeen repeatedly stated,[1678] that the redness produced by meconic acid\r\nmay be distinguished by the effect of an alkali, which is said to bleach\r\nthe colour produced by sulpho-cyanic acid, but to deepen the cherry-red\r\ntint occasioned by the meconic. This is not correct; an alkali added to\r\nthe red solution of meconate of iron precipitates oxide of iron and\r\nrenders the liquid colourless. The best distinction yet proposed is the\r\nfollowing which has been suggested by Dr. Percy. Acidulate the red fluid\r\nwith sulphuric acid, drop in a bit of pure zinc, and suspend at the\r\nmouth of the tube a bit of paper moistened with solution of acetate of\r\nlead: If the redness be caused by sulpho-cyanic acid, hydrosulphuric\r\nacid gas is evolved, and blackens the paper; but no such effect ensues,\r\nit the redness be owing to meconic acid.[1679]—According to Dr. Pereira,\r\nsolutions of the acetates, an infusion of white mustard, decoctions of\r\nIceland moss, and of the _Gigantina helminthocorton_, besides other more\r\nrare substances, are reddened, like solution of meconic acid, by the\r\nsalts of peroxide of iron.[1680] 3. The solution of meconic acid gives a\r\npale-green precipitate with the sulphate of copper, and, if the\r\nprecipitate is not too abundant, it is dissolved by boiling, but\r\nreappears on cooling.\r\n\r\n_Of the Tests for Morphia and its Salts._—Morphia, when pure, is in\r\nsmall, beautiful, white crystals. Various forms have been ascribed to\r\nit; but in the numerous crystallizations I have made, it has always\r\nassumed when pure the form of a slightly flattened hexangular prism. It\r\nhas a bitter taste, but no smell.\r\n\r\nA gentle heat melts it, and if the fluid mass is then allowed to cool, a\r\ncrystalline radiated substance is formed. A stronger heat reddens and\r\nthen chars the fused mass, white fumes of a peculiar odour are\r\ndisengaged, and at last the mass kindles and burns brightly.—Morphia is\r\nvery little soluble in water. It is more soluble, yet still sparingly\r\nso, in ether. But its proper solvents are alcohol, or the diluted acids,\r\nmineral as well as vegetable. All its solutions are intensely bitter,\r\nand that in alcohol has an alkaline reaction.—From its solutions in the\r\nacids crystallizable salts may be procured; and morphia may be separated\r\nby the superior affinity of any of the inorganic alkalis; but it is\r\neasily redissolved by an excess of potash.—Morphia when treated with\r\nnitric acid is dissolved with effervescence, and becomes instantly\r\norange-red, which, if too much acid be used, changes quickly to yellow.\r\nThe coloration of morphia by nitric acid is a characteristic property;\r\nwhich, however, it possesses in common with some other alkaloids, such\r\nas brucia, and also strychnia when not quite pure. The change of colour\r\nis said by some chemists to depend on adhering resinoid matter, and not\r\nto be possessed by perfectly pure morphia; but this is a mistake. It is\r\nprobable that some other vegetable substances besides the three\r\nalkaloids, morphia, brucia, and strychnia, may be turned orange-red by\r\nnitric acid. Dr. Pereira says that oil of pimento undergoes the same\r\nchange.[1681]—When suspended in water, in the form of fine powder and\r\nthen treated with a drop or two of perchloride of iron containing little\r\nor no free hydrochloric acid, it is dissolved and forms a deep blue\r\nsolution, the tint of which is more purely blue, the stronger the\r\nsolution, and the purer the morphia. This is a property even more\r\ncharacteristic than the former, since no such effect is produced on any\r\nother known alkaloid. Like the effect of nitric acid, it is said not to\r\nbe essential to morphia, but to depend on adhering resinoid matter; yet\r\nthe blue colour is always strongly produced with powdered morphia of\r\nsnowy-whiteness.—Another property by which morphia maybe also\r\ndistinguished is the decomposition of iodic acid. A solution of iodic\r\nacid is turned brown either by morphia or its salts, owing to the\r\nformation of iodine; and the test is so delicate that it affects a\r\nsolution containing a 7000th of morphia.[1682] So many other substances,\r\nhowever, possess the property of disengaging iodine from iodic acid,\r\nthat little importance can be attached to this criterion.\r\n\r\n_Acetate of Morphia_ is in some countries the common medicinal form for\r\nadministering morphia; but it has been almost entirely superseded in\r\nthis city by the hydrochlorate, since Dr. W. Gregory pointed out a cheap\r\nmode of procuring that salt in a state of purity.[1683] The acetate is\r\nin confused crystals, often of a brownish colour from impurities. The\r\nstronger acids disengage acetic acid. The alkalis throw down morphia\r\nfrom its solution in water. Nitric acid and perchloride of iron act on\r\nit as on morphia itself.\r\n\r\n_Hydrochlorate of Morphia._—The muriate or hydrochlorate must be\r\ncarefully attended to by the medical jurist, because it is extensively\r\nused in medical practice instead of opium. As now prepared, it is\r\nsnowy-white and apparently pulverulent, but is in reality a congeries of\r\nfiliform crystals. It decrepitates slightly when heated, then melts, and\r\nat the same time chars, exhaling a strong odour somewhat like that of\r\ntruffles. Nitric acid and perchloride of iron act on it as on morphia.\r\nBoiling water dissolves fully its own weight, and very easily\r\nthree-fourths of its weight of hydrochlorate of morphia; and on cooling\r\ndown to 60° F. it retains seven parts per cent., and deposits the rest\r\nin tufts of beautiful filiform crystals. The solution commonly employed\r\nin medicine contains one per cent. of the salt. Nitric acid turns the\r\nsolution yellow, acting distinctly enough when the water contains a\r\nhundredth, and perceptibly when it contains only a two-hundredth of its\r\nweight. Perchloride of iron strikes a deep blue with a solution\r\ncontaining a hundredth of its weight, very distinctly when the\r\nproportion is a two-hundredth, and even perceptibly when it is only a\r\nfive-hundredth. A solution much more diluted than even the last has a\r\nstrong bitter taste. When moderately concentrated, morphia is\r\nprecipitated from it by the alkalis.\r\n\r\nOf the preceding properties of morphia and its salts, those which\r\nconstitute the most characteristic tests are the effects of perchloride\r\nof iron and of nitric acid on all of them, the effect of heat on\r\nmorphia, and the effect of an alkali on its solutions in acids.\r\n\r\n_Of the Tests for Narcotine._—Narcotine is rather distinguished by\r\nnegative than by positive chemical properties. When pure, it is in\r\ntransparent colourless pearly crystals, which, as formed from alcohol,\r\nmay be either very flat, oblique, six-sided prisms, or oblong four-sided\r\ntables obliquely bevelled on their sides. But when crystallized from\r\nsulphuric ether the crystals are prisms with a rhombic base. They fuse\r\nwith heat, and concrete on cooling into a resinous-like mass. They are\r\nsoluble in ether, and fixed oil, less so in alcohol, insoluble in water\r\nor the alkalis, very soluble in the diluted acids, but without effecting\r\nneutralization; and if perfectly pure, they do not undergo the changes\r\nproduced on morphia by perchloride of iron or nitric acid. Few specimens\r\nof narcotic, however, are so pure as not to render nitric acid yellow.\r\nCare must be taken not to confound narcotine with morphia. When\r\ncrystallized together from alcohol and not quite pure, narcotine forms\r\ntufts of pearly thin tabular crystals, while morphia is in short, thick,\r\nsparkling prisms.\r\n\r\n_Of Codeïa._—This substance is, like morphia, an alkaloid, capable of\r\ncombining with acids. It differs from morphia and narcotine in being\r\nmoderately soluble in water; and from this solution it may be\r\ncrystallized in large crystals affecting the octaedral form. It is\r\nunnecessary to detail its chemical properties.\r\n\r\n_Of the Tests for Porphyroxine._—This principle is a neutral crystalline\r\nbody, insoluble in water, soluble in alcohol and ether, and also soluble\r\nin weak acids, which part with it unchanged on the addition of an\r\nalkali. When heated with hydrochloric acid, a fine purple or rose-red\r\nsolution is produced; whence its name. It is supposed that this property\r\nmay be of use in medico-legal researches; and the following mode of\r\ndeveloping it has been proposed by Dr. Merck, its discoverer.[1684]\r\nDecompose the suspected fluid with caustic potash; agitate the mixture\r\nwith sulphuric ether; dip a bit of white filtering paper repeatedly in\r\nthe etherial solution, drying it after each immersion; then wet the\r\npaper with hydrochloric acid, and expose it to the vapour of boiling\r\nwater; upon which the paper will become more or less acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of the Process for detecting Opium in mixed fluids and solids._\r\n\r\nHaving stated these particulars of the chemical history of opium and its\r\nchief component ingredients, I shall now describe what has appeared to\r\nme the most delicate and satisfactory method of detecting it in a mixed\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n1. If there be any solid matter, it is to be cut into small fragments,\r\nwater is to be added if necessary, then a little acetic acid sufficient\r\nto render the mixture acidulous, and when the whole mass has been well\r\nstirred, and has stood a few minutes, it is to be filtered, and\r\nevaporated at a temperature somewhat below ebullition to the consistence\r\nof a moderately thick syrup. To this extract strong alcohol is to be\r\ngradually added, care being taken to break down any coagulum which may\r\nbe formed: and after ebullition and cooling, the alcoholic solution is\r\nto be filtered. The solution must then be evaporated to the consistence\r\nof a thin syrup, and the residue dissolved in distilled water and\r\nfiltered anew.\r\n\r\n2. Add now the solution of acetate of lead as long as it causes\r\nprecipitation, filter and wash. The filtered fluid contains acetate of\r\nmorphia, and the precipitate on the filter contains meconic acid united\r\nwith the oxide of lead.\r\n\r\n3. The fluid part is to be treated with hydrosulphuric acid gas, to\r\nthrow down any lead which may remain in solution. It is then to be\r\nfiltered while _cold_, and evaporated sufficiently in a vapour-bath. The\r\nsolution in this state will sometimes be sufficiently pure for the\r\napplication of the tests for morphia; but in most cases it is necessary,\r\nand in all advisable, to purify it still farther. For this purpose the\r\nmorphia is to be precipitated with carbonate of soda; and the\r\nprecipitate having been collected, washed, and drained on a filter, the\r\nprecipitate and portion of the filter to which it adheres are to be\r\nboiled in a little pure alcohol. The alcoholic solution,—filtered, if\r\nnecessary,—will give by evaporation a crystalline residue of morphia,\r\nwhich becomes orange-red with nitric acid, and blue with perchloride of\r\niron. The latter property I have sometimes been unable to develope when\r\nthe former was presented characteristically.\r\n\r\n4. It is useful, however, to separate the meconic acid also; because, as\r\nits properties are more delicate, I have repeatedly been able to detect\r\nit satisfactorily, when I did not feel satisfied with the result of the\r\nsearch for morphia. Dr. Ure made the same remark in his evidence on the\r\ntrial of Stewart and his wife. He detected the meconic acid, but could\r\nnot separate the morphia. It may be detected in one of two ways,—by\r\nmeans of hydrosulphuric acid, or by sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nIf the former method be chosen, suspend in a little water the\r\nprecipitate caused by the acetate of lead (par. 2); transmit\r\nhydrosulphuric acid gas till the whole precipitate is blackened; filter\r\nimmediately without boiling; then boil, and if necessary filter a second\r\ntime. A great part of the impurities thrown down by the acetate of lead\r\nwill be separated with the sulphuret of lead; and the meconic acid is\r\ndissolved. But it requires in general farther purification, which is\r\nbest attained by again throwing it down with acetate of lead, and\r\nrepeating the steps of the present paragraph. The fluid is now to be\r\nconcentrated by evaporation at a temperature not exceeding 180° F., and\r\nsubjected to the tests for meconic acid, more particularly to the action\r\nof perchloride of iron, when the quantity is small. If there is\r\nevidently a considerable quantity of acid, a portion should be\r\nevaporated till it yields crystalline scales; and these are to be heated\r\nin a tube to procure the arborescent crystalline sublimate formerly\r\ndescribed. About a sixth of a grain of meconic acid, however, is\r\nrequired to try the latter test conveniently.\r\n\r\nIf the method of separating meconic acid by means of sulphuric acid be\r\npreferred, the precipitate formed by acetate of lead is to be treated\r\nwith weak sulphuric acid, which forms insoluble sulphate of lead, and\r\ndisengages the meconic acid. The liquid obtained by filtration is then\r\nto be evaporated as above, to obtain crystals, which are to be examined\r\nby the tests for meconic acid. Orfila thinks this method more delicate\r\nthan the mode by hydrosulphuric acid gas. I am inclined from my own\r\nexperiments to doubt his statement.\r\n\r\n5. If there be a sufficiency of the original material, Merck’s process\r\nfor detecting porphyroxin may be tried [see p. 534]. But I doubt whether\r\nthis process is sufficiently delicate for medico-legal purposes.\r\n\r\nI wish I could add my testimony to the opinion, expressed on a\r\nremarkable occasion by Professor Chaussier, in favour of the delicacy of\r\nthe tests for morphia and its compounds, that they might be detected\r\n“jusqu’à une molécule.”[1685] In one sense this statement may be\r\ncorrect. Morphia, separated from the complex mixture of principles with\r\nwhich it is combined in opium, may be detected in extremely small\r\nquantities. Accordingly, M. Lassaigne has supplied, for the discovery of\r\nacetate of morphia in mixed fluids, an excellent process, whence the\r\nchief part of the three first paragraphs of the preceding method for\r\nopium are borrowed; and from the facts stated by him in his paper,[1686]\r\nas well as from the experimental testimony of Professor Orfila,[1687] it\r\nappears that Lassaigne’s process will furnish strong indications, if not\r\nabsolute proof of the presence of that salt, in the proportion of two\r\ngrains to eight ounces of the most complex mixtures. Hence the search\r\nfor acetate of morphia in a suspected case is by no means hopeless. But\r\nthe detection of acetate of morphia is an object of small moment,\r\ncompared with the detection of morphia in its natural state of\r\ncombination in opium. Now my own observations lead me to entertain\r\nserious doubts, whether the best method of operating hitherto known\r\ncould be successfully applied to the detection of the equivalent opium\r\nin complex mixtures. By the process I have recommended it is easy to\r\nprocure, from an infusion of ten grains of opium in four ounces of\r\nwater, satisfactory proof of the presence of morphia by the action of\r\nammonia, perchloride of iron and nitric acid, and equally distinct proof\r\nof the presence of meconic acid by perchloride of iron, as well as\r\nsulphate of copper. But on proceeding to apply the process to organic\r\nmixtures, I have found that when the soluble part of ten grains of opium\r\nwas mixed with four ounces of porter or milk, I could develope no\r\nproperty of morphia but its bitterness, and no indication of meconic\r\nacid but the action of perchloride of iron. MM. Larocque and Thibierge,\r\nit is right to add, have in similar circumstances found the process\r\nsomewhat more delicate.[1688]\r\n\r\nIt is of great consequence, however, to remark, that in cases of\r\npoisoning with opium, the medical jurist will seldom have the good\r\nfortune to operate even upon so large a proportion of the poison as in\r\nmy experiments; because the greater part of it disappears from the\r\nstomach before death. This will not happen always, as may be seen from\r\nvarious cases mentioned afterwards in the section on the morbid\r\nappearances caused by opium. But, according to my own observations, the\r\npoison will often disappear in a short time, so far as to render an\r\nanalysis abortive. Thus in the case of a young woman who died five hours\r\nafter taking not less than two ounces of laudanum, I could apply to the\r\nfluid, procured from the contents of the stomach, by paragraphs 1, 2,\r\nand 3 of my process, only the test of its taste, which had the\r\nbitterness of morphia. In the case of another young woman, whose stomach\r\nwas emptied by the stomach-pump four hours after she took two ounces of\r\nlaudanum, I could obtain from the evacuated fluid, when properly\r\nprepared, only the indications of the presence of morphia supplied by\r\nits bitterness and the imperfect action of nitric acid,—and the\r\nindication of the presence of meconic acid supplied by the imperfect\r\naction of perchloride of iron. In a third case, where the stomach was\r\nevacuated two hours after seven drachms of laudanum had been swallowed,\r\neven the first portions of fluid withdrawn had not any opiate odour, and\r\ndid not yield any indication of the presence even of meconic acid. Now,\r\non the one hand, the quantity taken in these instances is rarely\r\nexceeded in cases of poisoning with laudanum; and, on the other hand,\r\nthe interval during which it remained in the stomach subject to vital\r\noperations is considerably less than the average in medico-legal, and\r\nabove all in fatal cases. It may be laid down, therefore, as a general\r\nrule, that in poisoning with opium the medical jurist, by the best\r\nmethods of analysis yet known, will often fail in procuring satisfactory\r\nevidence, and sometimes fail to obtain any evidence at all, of the\r\nexistence of the poison in the contents of the stomach. In a case\r\npublished by Dr. Bright from the experience of Mr. Walne of London, it\r\nis stated that the matter removed from the stomach only half an hour\r\nafter an ounce and a half of laudanum had been taken, while the stomach\r\nwas empty, did not smell of opium.[1689] This case is quoted to put the\r\nreader on his guard. But at the same time it does appear extremely\r\nimprobable that the whole opium had disappeared from the stomach in so\r\nshort a time, and much more likely that it might have been found by\r\nanalysis in the matter first withdrawn.\r\n\r\nI have taken some pains to establish the proposition laid down above,\r\nbecause in a matter of such importance it is always essential, that the\r\nmedical inspector know the real extent of his resources; and it has\r\nappeared to me that, greatly as the hand of the chemist has been\r\nstrengthened by late discoveries in vegetable analysis, his power has\r\nbeen overrated both by his scientific brethren, and by the medical\r\nprofession generally. I am happy to find, since the first publication of\r\nthese remarks, that they coincide with the experience and opinion of so\r\neminent an authority as Professor Buchner; who has observed that a\r\nchemical analysis must often fail to detect opium where there could be\r\nno doubt of its having been administered in large quantity.[1690]\r\n\r\nIt is of moment to add, that in two of the instances mentioned above the\r\nodour of laudanum was perceived in the subject of analysis,—faintly,\r\nhowever, and only for a few hours after it was removed from the stomach.\r\nAlthough the peculiar odour of opium is a delicate criterion of its\r\npresence, it does not follow that it should be preferred to an elaborate\r\nchemical analysis. For it is a test of extreme uncertainty. There is in\r\nthe contents of the stomach such a complication of odours, that with a\r\nrather delicate sense of smell, I have sometimes been unable to satisfy\r\nmyself of the presence of the opiate odour where others were sure it\r\nexisted. At the same time the medical jurist should not neglect it as a\r\nsubsidiary test. It is always strongest and most characteristic, first,\r\nwhen the stomach is just opened, or the contents just withdrawn, and\r\nagain, when the fluid, in the course of preparation, as directed in\r\nparagraph 1 (p. 535), is just reaching the point of ebullition. The\r\nlatter odour is somewhat different from the former, yet quite peculiar,\r\nand such as every chemist must have remarked on boiling an infusion of\r\nopium. It is further to be observed, that although the odour of opium is\r\na very delicate test of its presence even in complex organic mixtures,\r\nchemical analysis may be successful, where this character fails. Dr.\r\nMorehead of the Bombay service, in applying my process to the fluid\r\nwithdrawn by the stomach-pump, detected morphia both by nitric acid and\r\nperchloride of iron, although he could not detect any odour of opium in\r\nthe fluid.[1691]\r\n\r\nSo much for the delicacy of the process. As to its precision,—from what\r\nI have myself witnessed, as well as from the experience of Dr. Ure, it\r\nwill often happen in actual practice, that the only indication of opium\r\nto be procured by the process consists in the deep red colour struck by\r\nperchloride of iron with the meconic acid. Now, will this alone\r\nconstitute sufficient proof of the presence of opium? On the whole, I am\r\ninclined to reply in the affirmative. Sulpho-cyanic acid, it is true,\r\nhas the same effect, and this acid has been proved by Professors Gmelin\r\nand Tiedemann to exist in the human saliva,[1692]—a fact which was\r\ncalled in question by Dr. Ure in his evidence on the trial of the\r\nStuarts, but which at the time I had verified, and which Dr. Ure has\r\nsince been compelled by experiments of his own to admit.[1693] But it\r\nmust be very seldom possible to procure a distinct blood-red coloration\r\nfrom the saliva, after it has been mixed with the complex contents of\r\nthe stomach, and subjected to the process of analysis detailed\r\nabove;[1694] and the check proposed by Dr. Percy (p. 532) will\r\ndistinguish it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SECTION II.—_Of the Action of Opium, and the Symptoms it excites in\r\n                                 Man._\r\n\r\nThe symptoms and mode of action of opium have been long made the subject\r\nof dispute, both among physicians and toxicologists; and in some\r\nparticulars our knowledge is still vague and insufficient.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of general poisoning, some experiments were related, from\r\nwhich it might be inferred that opium has the power of stupefying or\r\nsuspending the irritability of the parts to which it is immediately\r\napplied. The most unequivocal of these facts, which occurred to Dr.\r\nWilson Philip, was instant paralysis of the intestines of a dog, when an\r\ninfusion of opium was applied to their mucous coat;[1695] another hardly\r\nless decisive was palsy of the hind-legs of a frog, observed by Dr.\r\nMonro Secundus, when opium was injected between the skin and the\r\nmuscles;[1696] and a third, which has been remarked by several\r\nexperimentalists, is immediate cessation of the contractions of the\r\nfrog’s heart when opium is applied to its inner surface.[1697]\r\n\r\nThe poison has also powerful constitutional or remote effects, which are\r\nchiefly produced on the brain. Much discussion has arisen on the\r\nquestion, whether these constitutional effects are owing to the\r\nconveyance of the local torpor along the nerves to the brain, or to the\r\npoison being absorbed, and so acting on the brain through the blood. The\r\nquestion is not yet settled. It appears pretty certain, however, that\r\nthe poison cannot act constitutionally without entering the\r\nblood-vessels; although it is not so clear, that after it has entered\r\nthem, it acts by being carried with the blood to the brain. The newest\r\ndoctrine supposes that it enters the blood-vessels, and produces on\r\ntheir inner coat an impression which is conveyed along the nerves.\r\n\r\nAccording to the experiments of Professor Orfila, it is more energetic\r\nwhen applied to the surface of a wound than when introduced into the\r\nstomach, and most energetic of all when injected into a vein.[1698] The\r\ninference generally drawn from these and other analogous\r\nexperiments[1699] is, that the blood transmits the poison in substance\r\nto the brain. They certainly, however, do not prove more than that the\r\npoison must enter the blood before it acts.\r\n\r\nThe old doctrine, that the blood-vessels have no concern with its\r\naction, and that it acts only by conveyance along the nerves of a\r\npeculiar local torpor arising from its direct application to their\r\nsentient extremities, has been long abandoned by most physiologists as\r\nuntenable. But some have adopted a late modification of this doctrine,\r\nby supposing that opium may act both by being carried with the blood to\r\nthe brain, and by the transmission of local torpor along the nerves.\r\nThey believe, in fact, that opium possesses a double mode of\r\naction,—through sympathy as well as through absorption. It would be\r\nfruitless to inquire into the grounds that exist for adopting or\r\nrejecting this doctrine, because sufficient facts are still wanting to\r\ndecide the controversy. So far as they go, however, they appear adverse\r\nto the supposition of a conveyance of impressions along the nerves,\r\nwithout the previous entrance of the poison within the blood-vessels.\r\nThe difficulties, in the way of the theory of the sympathetic action of\r\nopium, would be removed by the doctrine of Messrs. Morgan and Addison.\r\nAccording to their views, the experiments, which appear at first sight\r\nto prove that this substance operates by being carried with the blood to\r\nthe part on which it acts, are easily explained by considering that the\r\nopium makes a peculiar impression on the inside of the vessels, which\r\nimpression subsequently passes along the nerves to the brain.[1700] But,\r\nas stated in the introductory chapter on the physiology of poisoning,\r\nthis theory requires support.\r\n\r\nThe effects of opium, through whatever channel it may produce them, are\r\nexerted chiefly on the brain and nervous system. This appears from the\r\nexperiments of a crowd of physiologists, as well as from the symptoms\r\nobserved a thousand times in man. In animals the symptoms are different\r\nfrom those remarked in man. Some experimentalists have indeed witnessed\r\nin the higher orders of animals, as in the human subject, pure lethargy\r\nand coma. But the latest researches, among the rest those of M. Orfila,\r\nshow that much more generally it causes in animals hurried pulse,\r\ngiddiness, palsy of the hind-legs, convulsions of various degrees of\r\nintensity, from simple tremors to violent tetanus, and a peculiar\r\nslumber, in the midst of which a slight excitement rouses the animal and\r\nrenews the convulsions. These symptoms are produced in whatever way the\r\npoison enters the body, whether by the stomach, or by a wound, or by\r\ndirect injection into a vein, or by the rectum. In man, convulsions are\r\nsometimes excited; but much more commonly simple sopor and coma.\r\n\r\nAccording to the inquiries of M. Charret, which were extended to every\r\nclass of the lower animals, opium produces three leading effects. It\r\nacts on the brain, causing congestion, and consequently sopor; on the\r\ngeneral nervous centre as an irritant, exciting convulsions; and on the\r\nmuscles as a direct sedative. It is poisonous to all animals,—man,\r\ncarnivorous quadrupeds, the _rodentia_, birds, reptiles, amphibious\r\nanimals, fishes, insects, and the _mollusca_. But of its three leading\r\neffects some are not produced in certain classes or orders of animals.\r\nIn the _mammalia_, with the exception of man, there is no cerebral\r\ncongestion induced, and death takes place amidst convulsions. In birds\r\nthere is some cerebral congestion towards the close; but still the two\r\nother phenomena are the most prominent.[1701]\r\n\r\nIt has been rendered probable, by what is stated above, that opium\r\nenters the blood. The question, therefore, naturally arises, whether its\r\npresence there can be proved by chemical analysis? But considering the\r\nimperfection of the processes for detecting it when mixed with organic\r\nsubstances, no disappointment ought to be felt if this proof should fail\r\nin regard to so complex a fluid as the blood. The only person who has\r\nrepresented himself successful in the search is M. Barruel of Paris. He\r\nexamined the urine and blood of a man under the influence of a poisonous\r\ndose of laudanum, amounting to an ounce and a half; and procured\r\nindications of morphia in both. When three ounces of urine were boiled\r\nwith magnesia, and the insoluble matter was collected, washed, dried,\r\nand boiled, in alcohol, the residue of the alcoholic solution formed a\r\nwhite stain, which became deep orange-red on the addition of nitric\r\nacid. The blood was subjected to a more complex operation. One pound and\r\nten ounces of it were bruised in a mortar, diluted with two pounds of\r\nwater, strongly acidulated with sulphuric acid, boiled, filtered, and\r\nwashed. The filtered fluid was saturated with chalk, and the excess of\r\ncarbonic acid driven off by heat. The fluid was then filtered again, and\r\nafter being washed with water, was acted on by diluted acetic acid. The\r\nacetic solution left on evaporation a residue which was repeatedly acted\r\non by alcohol; and the residue of the alcoholic solutions was treated\r\nwith pure alcohol and carbonate of lime. The new solution when filtered\r\nand evaporated left several small white stains, which became orange-red\r\nwith nitric acid.[1702] These results have been since contradicted by M.\r\nDublanc. He in vain sought for morphia in the blood and urine of people\r\nwho were taking acetate medicinally, or of animals that were killed by\r\nit.[1703] Barruel’s results are also at variance with some pointed\r\nexperiments of M. Lassaigne, who could not detect any acetate of morphia\r\neven in blood drawn from a dog twelve hours after thirty-six grains were\r\ninjected into the crural vein;[1704] nor any in the liver or venous\r\nblood of a dog poisoned with eight ounces of Sydenham’s laudanum.[1705]\r\n\r\nIn investigating the effects of opium and its principles on man, the\r\nnatural order of procedure is to consider in the first place those of\r\nopium itself in its various forms.\r\n\r\nThe effect of a small dose seems to be generally in the first instance\r\nstimulating: the action of the heart and arteries is increased, and a\r\nslight sense of fulness is caused in the head. This stimulus differs\r\nmuch in different individuals. In most persons it is quite\r\ninsignificant. In its highest degree it is well exemplified by Dr. Leigh\r\nin his Experimental Inquiry, as they occurred to a friend of his who\r\nrepeatedly made the experiment. If in the evening when he felt sleepy,\r\nhe took thirty drops of laudanum, he was enlivened so that he could\r\nresume his studies; and if, when the usual drowsiness approached, which\r\nit did in two hours, he took a hundred drops more, he soon became so\r\nmuch exhilarated, that he was compelled to laugh and sing and dance. The\r\npulse meanwhile was full and strong, and the temporal arteries throbbed\r\nforcibly. In no long time the customary torpor ensued. The stimulant\r\neffect of opium given during a state of exhaustion is also well\r\nillustrated by Dr. Burnes in his account of Cutch. “On one occasion,”\r\nsays he, “I had made a very fatiguing night march with a Cutchee\r\nhorseman. In the morning, after having travelled above thirty miles, I\r\nwas obliged to assent to his proposal of haulting for a few minutes,\r\nwhich he employed in sharing a quantity of about two drachms of opium\r\nbetween himself and his jaded horse. The effect of the dose was soon\r\nevident on both, for the horse finished a journey of forty miles with\r\ngreat apparent facility, and the rider absolutely became more active and\r\nintelligent.”[1706]\r\n\r\nBy repeating small doses frequently, the stimulus may be kept up for a\r\nconsiderable time in some people. In this way are produced the\r\nremarkable effects said to be experienced by opium-eaters in the east.\r\nThese effects seem to be in the first instance stimulant, the\r\nimagination being rendered brilliant, the passions exalted, and the\r\nmuscular force increased; and this state endures for a considerable time\r\nbefore the usual stage of collapse supervenes. A very poetical, but I\r\nbelieve also a faithful, picture of the phenomena now alluded to is\r\ngiven in the Confessions of an English Opium-eater,—a work well known to\r\nbe founded on the personal experience of the writer. It is singular that\r\nour profession should have observed these phenomena so little, as to be\r\naccused by him of having wholly misrepresented the action of the most\r\ncommon drug in medical practice. In reply to this charge the physician\r\nmay simply observe, that he seldom administers opium in the way\r\npractised by the opium-eater; that when given in the usual therapeutic\r\nmode it rarely causes material excitement; that some professional people\r\nprefer giving it in frequent small doses, with the view of procuring its\r\nsedative effect, and undoubtedly do succeed in attaining their object;\r\nthat in both of these medicinal ways of administering it, excitement is\r\noccasionally produced to a great degree and of a disagreeable kind; that\r\nthe latter phenomena have been clearly traced to idiosyncrasy; and\r\ntherefore that the effects on opium-eaters are probably owing either to\r\nthe same cause, or to the modifying power of habit. This much at all\r\nevents is certain,—that in persons unaccustomed to opium it seldom\r\nproduces material excitement in a single small dose, and does not always\r\ncause continuous excitement when taken after the manner of the\r\nopium-eater. The effect of a full medicinal dose of two or three grains\r\nof solid opium, or forty or sixty grains of the tincture, is to produce\r\nin general a transient excitement and fulness of the pulse, but in a\r\nshort time afterwards torpor and sleep, commonly succeeded in six,\r\neight, or ten hours by headache, nausea, and dry tongue.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of poisoning with opium, administered at once in a\r\ndangerous dose, begin with giddiness and stupor, generally without any\r\nprevious stimulus. The stupor rapidly increasing, the person soon\r\nbecomes motionless and insensible to external impressions; he breathes\r\nslowly; generally lies still, with the eyes shut and the pupils\r\ncontracted; and the whole expression of the countenance is that of deep\r\nand perfect repose. As the poisoning advances, the features become\r\nghastly, the pulse feeble and imperceptible, the muscles excessively\r\nrelaxed, and, unless assistance speedily arrive, death ensues. If\r\nrecovery take place, the sopor is succeeded by prolonged sleep, which\r\ncommonly ends in twenty-four or thirty-six hours, and is followed by\r\nnausea, vomiting, giddiness, and loathing of food.\r\n\r\nThe period which elapses between the taking of the poison and the\r\ncommencement of the symptoms is various. A large quantity, taken in the\r\nform of tincture, on an empty stomach, may begin to act in a few\r\nminutes; but for obvious reasons it is not easy to learn the precise\r\nfact as to this particular. Dr. Meyer, late medical inspector at Berlin,\r\nhas related a case of poisoning with six ounces of the saffron tincture\r\nof opium, where the person was found in a hopeless state of coma in half\r\nan hour,[1707] and M. Ollivier has described another instance of a man\r\nwho was found completely soporose at the same distance of time after\r\ntaking an ounce and a half of laudanum.[1708] In these cases, the\r\nsymptoms must have begun in ten or fifteen minutes at farthest. In a\r\ncase noticed by M. Desruelles the sopor was fairly formed in fifteen\r\nminutes after two drachms of solid opium were taken.[1709] For the most\r\npart, however, opium, taken in the solid form, does not begin to act for\r\nhalf an hour or even almost a whole hour,—that period being required to\r\nallow its poisonous principles to be separated and absorbed by the\r\nbibulous vessels. It is singular that an interval of an hour was\r\nremarked in a case where the largest quantity was taken which has yet\r\nbeen recorded. The patient swallowed eight ounces of crude opium; but in\r\nan hour her physician found her able to tell connectedly all she had\r\ndone; and she recovered.[1710] In some rare cases the sopor is put off\r\nfor a longer period: thus, in a case mentioned in Corvisart’s Journal,\r\nthere seems to have been no material stupor till considerably more than\r\nan hour after the person took two ounces and a half of the tincture with\r\na drachm of the extract.[1711]\r\n\r\nThe result of almost universal observation, however, is, that in pure\r\npoisoning with opium the commencement of the symptoms is not put off\r\nmuch beyond an hour. Such being the fact, it is extremely difficult to\r\naccount for the following extraordinary case, which was communicated to\r\nme by Dr. Heude, of the East India Company’s service. A man swallowed an\r\nounce and a half of laudanum, and in an hour half as much more, and then\r\nlay down in bed. Some excitement followed, and also numbness of the arms\r\nand legs. But he continued so sensible and lively seven hours after the\r\nfirst dose was taken, that a medical gentleman, who saw him at that time\r\nand got from him a confession of what he had done, very naturally did\r\nnot believe his story. It was not till at least the eighteenth hour that\r\nstupor set in; but two hours later, when Dr. Heude first saw him, he\r\nlaboured under all the characteristic symptoms of poisoning with opium\r\nin an aggravated degree. The stomach-pump brought away a fluid quite\r\nfree of the odour of opium. In seven hours more, under assiduous\r\ntreatment, after having been in an almost hopeless state of\r\ninsensibility, he had recovered so far as to be safely left in charge of\r\na friend; and eventually he got quite well. No particular cause could be\r\ndiscovered for the long apparent suspension of the usual effects of\r\nopium.\r\n\r\nAlthough the symptoms are very rarely postponed beyond an hour in pure\r\npoisoning with this substance, there is some reason for thinking that\r\nthe interval may be much longer, if at the time of taking the opium the\r\nperson be excited by intoxication from previously drinking spirits. Mr.\r\nShearmen has related a striking case of an habitual drunkard, who took\r\ntwo ounces of laudanum while intoxicated to excitement with beer and\r\nspirits, and had no material stupor for five hours, during which period\r\nvomiting could not be induced. Five hours afterwards, he was found\r\ninsensible, and he eventually died under symptoms of poisoning with\r\nopium.[1712]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable symptom in the generality of cases of poisoning with\r\nopium is the peculiar sopor. This state differs from coma, in as much as\r\nthe patient continues long capable of being roused. It may be difficult\r\nto rouse him; but unless death is at hand, this may be commonly\r\naccomplished by brisk agitation, tickling the nostrils, loud speaking,\r\nor the injection of water into the ear. The state of restored\r\nconsciousness is always imperfect, and is speedily followed again by\r\nlethargy when the exciting power is withheld.—It has been already\r\nremarked, that the possibility of thus interrupting the lethargy caused\r\nby opium is in general a good criterion for distinguishing the effects\r\nof this poison from apoplexy and epilepsy.\r\n\r\nIt was observed, in describing the mode of action of opium, that\r\nconvulsions, although very frequently produced by it in animals, are\r\nrarely caused in man. It is not easy to account for this difference.\r\nOrfila has endeavoured to explain it, by supposing that convulsions are\r\nproduced only by very large doses; but there are many facts incompatible\r\nwith that supposition.\r\n\r\nWhile convulsions are certainly not common in the human subject, yet\r\nwhen they do occur they are sometimes violent. Tralles mentions that he\r\nhad himself several times seen convulsions excited in children by\r\nmoderate doses.[1713] The Journal Universel contains the case of a\r\nsoldier who took two drachms of solid opium, and died in six hours and a\r\nhalf, after being affected with locked-jaw and dreadful spasms.[1714] A\r\ncase is related in the Medical and Physical Journal of a young man, who,\r\nthree hours after swallowing an ounce of laudanum, was found insensible,\r\nwith the mouth distorted, the jaws fixed, and the hands clenched; and\r\nwho, soon after the insensibility was lessened by proper remedies, was\r\nseized with spasms of the back, neck, and extremities, so violent as to\r\nresemble opisthotonos.[1715] Another good case of the kind is related by\r\nMr. M’Kechnie, where the voluntary muscles were violently convulsed in\r\nfrequent paroxysms, and affected in the intervals with subsultus, for\r\nthree hours before the sopor came on.[1716] Two instances of convulsions\r\nalternating with sopor are shortly related by Dr. Bright.[1717] The\r\nconvulsions sometimes assume the form of permanent spasm, which may\r\naffect the whole muscles of the body, as in a case related in\r\nCorvisart’s Journal.[1718]—Another rare symptom of poisoning with opium\r\nis delirium. It appears to occur occasionally along with convulsions, as\r\nhappened in Mr. M’Kechnie’s case, and in one related by M.\r\nOllivier.[1719]\r\n\r\nThe state of the pulse varies considerably. In an interesting case\r\ndescribed by Dr. Marcet it is mentioned that the pulse was 90, feeble\r\nand irregular; and such appears to be its most common condition when the\r\ndose has been so large as seriously to endanger life.[1720] Frequently,\r\nhowever, it is much slower; and then it is rather full than feeble, just\r\nas in apoplexy. In cases where convulsions occur, it is for the most\r\npart hurried, and does not become slow till the coma becomes pure. In\r\nMr. M’Kechnie’s case the pulse was at first 126; but when the\r\nconvulsions ceased, and pure sopor supervened, it fell to 55. It always\r\nbecomes towards the close very feeble, and at length imperceptible.\r\n\r\nThe respiration is almost always slow. In Dr. Marcet’s case, as in some\r\nothers, it was stertorous; but this is not common. On the contrary, it\r\nis more frequently soft and gentle, as it has been in all the cases I\r\nhave witnessed; and sometimes it can hardly be perceived at all, even in\r\npersons who eventually recover, as in an instance of recovery recorded\r\nby Dr. Kinnis.[1721]\r\n\r\nThe pupils are always at least sluggish in their contractions, often\r\nquite insensible;—sometimes, it is said, dilated:[1722] but much more\r\ncommonly contracted, and occasionally to an extreme degree. In the case\r\nlast noticed, they were no bigger than a pin’s head. The pupils have\r\nbeen so invariably found contracted in all recent cases of poisoning\r\nwith opium, that some doubt arises whether they are ever otherwise, and\r\nwhether the earlier accounts, which represent them to have been dilated,\r\nmay not be incorrect, and the result of hasty observation.\r\n\r\nThe expression of the countenance is for the most part remarkably\r\nplacid, like that of a person in sound natural sleep. Occasionally there\r\nis an expression of anxiety mingled with the stupor. The face is\r\ncommonly pale. Sometimes, however, it is flushed;[1723] and in rare\r\ncases the expression is furious.[1724]\r\n\r\nIn moderately large doses opium generally suspends the excretion of\r\nurine and fæces; but it promotes perspiration. In dangerous cases the\r\nlethargy is sometimes accompanied with copious sweating. In a fatal\r\ncase, which I examined judicially, the sheets were completely soaked to\r\na considerable distance around the body.\r\n\r\nA remarkable circumstance, which has been noticed by a late author, is\r\nthe sudden death of leeches applied to the body. The patient was a child\r\nwho had been poisoned by too strong an injection of poppy-heads.[1725]\r\n\r\nIn some instances the symptoms proper to poisoning with opium become\r\ncomplicated with those which belong rather to organic affections of the\r\nbrain, in consequence of such affections being suddenly developed\r\nthrough means of the cerebral congestion occasioned by the poison. Thus,\r\nin a case related in Corvisart’s Journal, there were convulsions and\r\nsomnolency on the third day, and palsy of one arm for four days; and for\r\nnearly two months afterwards the patient complained of occasional\r\nattacks of weakness and numbness, sometimes of one extremity, sometimes\r\nof another.[1726] Here the brain must have sustained some more permanent\r\ninjury than usual.—A more remarkable illustration once occurred to Dr.\r\nElliotson. A young man, seven hours after swallowing two ounces of\r\nlaudanum, presented the usual effects of opium, such as contracted\r\npupils, redness of the features, a frequent feeble pulse, coldness of\r\nthe integuments, and stupor, from which he could be roused without\r\nparticular difficulty. The stomach-pump brought away a fluid which had\r\nnot any odour of opium; powerful stimulants were given, such as ether,\r\nammonia and brandy; and he was kept constantly walking between two men.\r\nIn an hour and a half, when sensibility had been materially restored,\r\nhis head suddenly dropped down upon his breast, and he fell down dead.\r\nThe sinuses and veins of the brain were turgid, and a moderately thick\r\nlayer of blood was effused over the arachnoid membrane.[1727]—Under the\r\nsame head must be arranged the following extraordinary case related by\r\nPyl. That author admits it as one of simple poisoning, with a complete\r\nremission of the symptoms for several days. But the possibility of such\r\na remission must be received with great hesitation. It is well known\r\nthat most of the symptoms may be dispelled by vigorous treatment, and\r\nthe patient nevertheless relapse immediately if left to himself, and\r\neven die. This is acknowledged on all hands. Pyl, however, admits the\r\npossibility of a much more complete and longer interval. His case is\r\nshortly as follows. A man who had taken a large quantity of opium, and\r\nbecame very dangerously ill, was made to vomit in twelve hours, and\r\nregained his senses completely. The bowels continued obstinately\r\ncostive; but he had for some days no other symptom referrible to the\r\npoison; when at length the whole body became gradually palsied and\r\nstiff, and he died on the tenth day. No importance can be attached to a\r\nsolitary case differing so widely from every other. The only way in\r\nwhich opium could cause death in such a manner, must be by calling forth\r\nsome disposition to natural disease. Pyl’s case was probably one of\r\nsupervening _ramollissement_, or inflammation of the substance of the\r\nbrain.[1728]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the purely narcotic or nervous symptoms, which opium\r\nproduces in a vast proportion of instances, there is no doubt that it\r\nalso excites in a few rare cases those of irritation. Thus, although it\r\ngenerally constipates the bowels, it has been known to induce diarrhœa\r\nor colic in particular constitutions. In the first volume of the Medical\r\nCommunications, it is observed by Michaëlis that both diarrhœa and\r\ndiuresis may be produced by it. The soldier, whose case was quoted as\r\nhaving been accompanied with convulsions, had acute pain in the stomach\r\nfor some time after swallowing the poison; and in the case just quoted\r\nfrom Corvisart’s Journal, the accession of somnolency was attended with\r\nexcruciating pain of two days’ duration.\r\n\r\nAnother and more singular anomaly is the spontaneous occurrence of\r\nvomiting. Sometimes a little vomiting immediately succeeds the taking of\r\nthe poison. This may not interrupt, however, the progress of the\r\nsymptoms;[1729] but more commonly it is the means of saving the person’s\r\nlife, as in a striking case described by Petit of an English\r\nofficer,[1730] who, in consequence of vomiting immediately after taking\r\ntwo ounces of laudanum, had only moderate somnolency. At other times\r\nvomiting occurs at a much later period. Pyl, in his Essays and\r\nObservations, gives a case in which, some hours after thirty grains were\r\nswallowed, vomiting took place spontaneously, and recurred frequently\r\nafterwards; in the same paper is an account of another case by the\r\nindividual himself, who attempted to commit suicide by taking a large\r\ndose of laudanum, but was disappointed in consequence of the poison\r\nbeing spontaneously vomited after the sopor had fairly set in;[1731] and\r\na similar case is related by M. Mascarel, where, after seven ounces of\r\nSydenham’s laudanum had been taken, vomiting occurred spontaneously, and\r\nwas followed only by inconsiderable stupor.[1732]—Vomiting is a common\r\nenough symptom after the administration of emetics, or subsequent to the\r\ndeparture of the somnolency.[1733]\r\n\r\nThe _ordinary duration_ of a fatal case of poisoning with opium is from\r\nseven to twelve hours. Most people recover who outlive twelve hours. At\r\nthe same time fatal cases of longer duration are on record: Réaumur\r\nmentions one which proved fatal in fifteen hours,[1734] Orfila another\r\nfatal in seventeen hours,[1735] Leroux another fatal in the same\r\ntime,[1736] Alibert another fatal in nearly twenty-four hours.[1737] An\r\ninstance has even been related, which appeared to prove fatal not till\r\ntowards the close of the third day;[1738] but the whole course of the\r\nsymptoms was in that case so unusual, that some other cause must have\r\nco-operated in occasioning death. Sometimes, too, death takes place in a\r\nshorter time than seven hours; six hours is not an uncommon duration; I\r\nonce met with a judicial case, which could not have lasted above five\r\nhours; an infirmary patient of my colleague, Dr. Home, died in four\r\nhours; in the 31st volume of the Medical and Physical Journal, there is\r\none which proved fatal in three hours.[1739] This is the shortest I have\r\nread of.\r\n\r\nThe dose of opium requisite to cause death has not been determined.\r\nIndeed it must vary so much with circumstances, that it is almost vain\r\nto attempt to fix it. Pyl relates a case, quickly fatal, where the\r\nquantity taken was 60 grains;[1740] Lassus an instance of death from 36\r\ngrains;[1741] Wildberg has related a fatal case caused by little more\r\nthan half an ounce of the Berlin tincture,[1742] which contains the\r\nsoluble matter of forty grains; and Mr. Skae has mentioned a case fatal\r\nin about thirteen hours, where the dose seems to have been well\r\nascertained not to have exceeded half an ounce of common laudanum, or\r\nabout twenty grains of opium.[1743] Dr. Paris, without quoting any\r\nparticular fact, says four grains may prove fatal.[1744] I should have\r\nfelt some difficulty in admitting this statement, as I have repeatedly\r\nknown persons, unaccustomed to opium, take three or four grains without\r\nany other effect than sound sleep. But I have been favoured with the\r\nparticulars of a case by Mr. W. Brown of this city, where a dose of four\r\ngrains and a half, taken by an adult along with nine grains of camphor,\r\nwas followed by the usual signs of narcotism, and death in nine hours.\r\nThe man took the opium for a cough at seven in the morning; at nine his\r\nwife found him in a deep sleep, from which she could not rouse him;\r\nnothing was done for his relief till three in the afternoon, when Mr.\r\nBrown found him labouring under all the usual symptoms of poisoning with\r\nopium, contracted pupils among the rest; and death ensued in an hour,\r\nnotwithstanding the active employment of remedies. On examining the body\r\nno morbid appearance was found of any note except fluidity of the\r\nblood,—a common appearance in those who have died of the effects of this\r\ndrug.\r\n\r\nIt is more important than may at first sight be imagined to acquire an\r\napproximative knowledge of the smallest fatal dose. For, in consequence\r\nof the dread entertained of opium by many unprofessional persons, it is\r\ncurrently believed to be much more active than it is in reality; and\r\ninstances of natural death have been consequently imputed to medicinal\r\ndoses taken fortuitously a short time before. The facts stated above\r\ncomprehend the only precise information I have been able to collect as\r\nto the smallest fatal doses in adults. I may add some farther\r\nobservations, however, on the smallest fatal doses in children. Very\r\nyoung children are often peculiarly sensible to the poisonous action of\r\nopium, so that it is scarcely possible to use the most insignificant\r\ndoses with safety. Sundeling states in general terms that extremely\r\nsmall doses are very dangerous to infants on account of the rapidity of\r\nabsorption. This opinion is amply supported by the following cases.—An\r\ninfant three days old got by mistake about the fourth part of a mixture\r\ncontaining ten drops of laudanum. No medical man was called for eleven\r\nhours. At that time there was great somnolency and feebleness, but the\r\nchild could be roused. The breathing being very slow, artificial\r\nrespiration was resorted to, but without advantage: the child died in\r\ntwenty-four hours, the character of the symptoms remaining unchanged to\r\nthe last. At the inspection of the body, which I witnessed, no morbid\r\nappearance was found.—Of the same kind was a case communicated to me by\r\nDr. Simson of this city, where the administration of three drops of\r\nlaudanum in a chalk mixture, for diarrhœa, to a stout child fourteen\r\nmonths old, was followed by coma, convulsions, and death in about six\r\nhours. Dr. Simson satisfied himself, as far as that was possible, that\r\nthe apothecary who made up the mixture did not commit a mistake.—Dr.\r\nKelso of Lisburn met with a similar case in an infant of nine months,\r\nwho died in nine hours after taking four drops.[1745]—My colleague, Dr.\r\nAlison, tells me he has met with a case where an infant a few weeks old\r\ndied with all the symptoms of poisoning with opium after receiving four\r\ndrops of laudanum, and that he has repeatedly seen unpleasant deep sleep\r\ninduced by only two drops.—These remarks being kept in view, it will, I\r\nsuspect, be difficult to go along with an opinion against poisoning\r\nexpressed by a German medico-legal physician in the following\r\ncircumstances. A child’s maid, pursuant to a common but dangerous custom\r\namong nurses, gave a healthy infant, four weeks old, an anodyne draught\r\nto quiet its screams. The infant soon fell fast asleep, but died\r\ncomatose in twelve hours. There was not any appearance of note in the\r\ndead body; and the child was therefore universally thought to have been\r\nkilled by the draught. But the inspecting physician declared that to be\r\nimpossible, as the draught contained only an eighth of a grain of opium\r\nand as much hyoscyamus.[1746] In the first edition of this work an\r\nopinion was expressed to the same purport. But the facts stated above\r\nthrow doubt on its accuracy, and rather show that the dose was\r\nsufficient in the circumstances to occasion death.\r\n\r\nA very important circumstance to attend to in respect to the dose of\r\nopium required to prove fatal is the influence of constitutional\r\ncircumstances in rendering this drug unusually energetic. In some\r\npersons this peculiar anomaly exists always, even during a state of\r\nhealth. Thus, I am acquainted with a gentleman on whom seven drops of\r\nlaudanum act with great certainty as a hypnotic. In such a one doses,\r\nwhich are safely taken by many, might prove dangerous.\r\n\r\nIt is more usual, however, to meet with this anomaly in the course of\r\nsome diseases. These have not yet been satisfactorily indicated. I have\r\nseveral times, however, met with unusually energetic action from\r\nmedicinal doses in elderly persons affected with severe habitual\r\ncatarrh; and in one instance death occurred after a dose of twenty-five\r\ndrops in the advanced stage of acute catarrh supervening on its chronic\r\nform, the symptoms being those of poisoning with opium, succeeding\r\napparently a state of comfortable sleep.—A case seemingly of the same\r\nnature, where the dose was fifteen drops of Battley’s Sedative Liquor,\r\noccurred at Islington in 1841. An elderly lady, in delicate health, and\r\naffected severely with asthma, which for ten days prevented her from\r\nsleeping, got from a neighbouring druggist a draught of Battley’s\r\nsolution, syrup, and camphor-mixture. Next morning she was found\r\ninsensible and livid in the face, with cold extremities and contracted\r\npupils; and she died about twelve hours after taking the draught. There\r\nwas no sign of natural disease in the dead body to account for death.\r\nThe druggist was absurdly blamed for giving such a dose to a frail old\r\nlady; for the dose was not more than would be generally given in such\r\ncircumstances. This case was communicated to me by the druggist in\r\nquestion.—Another of the like kind has been communicated to me by Mr.\r\nGarstang of Clitheroe. An elderly female, long subject to severe cough,\r\nhaving enjoyed a comfortable night’s rest after a dose of a preparation\r\ncontaining half a grain of opium, took in the morning the equivalent of\r\ntwo grains and a half, or three grains at the utmost, and fell asleep\r\nsoon after. In no long time, her husband, alarmed because he could not\r\nrouse her, sent for Mr. Garstang, who found her husband labouring under\r\nall the symptoms of poisoning with opium; and, notwithstanding active\r\ntreatment, she died six hours after the second dose. Her husband took\r\nhalf a grain with her the evening before, but experienced no effect from\r\nit at all. Not the slightest ground could exist in this case for\r\nsuspecting either foul play or pharmaceutic error.—As a farther\r\nillustration, the following incident deserves notice, which occurred\r\nlast year in London, and was communicated to me by Dr. G. Johnson, a\r\nformer pupil. A little girl, five years and a half old, affected with\r\nviolent cough, got a mixture containing opium, which was repeated six,\r\nthirteen, and twenty-six hours afterwards. She slept soundly after each\r\ndose, and awoke readily after the first three; but after the fourth she\r\nhad more stupor and much uneasiness; in which state, but with at least\r\none interval of sensibility, she died in nine hours more, or thirty-five\r\nhours after the first dose. According to the prescriber’s intention, the\r\nchild ought to have taken only two minims of laudanum in all; but,\r\naccording to a rough analysis by Mr. Alfred Taylor, each dose contained\r\nan eighth of a grain of opium, or a trifle more. In either view it is\r\nimpossible that doses so small, and so distant, could produce these\r\neffects in ordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\nSuch cases are important in several respects, but especially because\r\nthey naturally give rise to suspicions of an over-dose of opium having\r\nbeen incautiously given, and thus to misrepresentations injurious to the\r\ndruggist or medical attendant. In the last case a Coroner’s Jury brought\r\nin the preposterous verdict, that death was caused by “too much opium\r\nordered without due instructions.”\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to add, that the dose required to prove fatal\r\nis very much altered by habit. Those who have been accustomed to eat\r\nopium are obliged gradually to increase the dose, otherwise its usual\r\neffects are not produced. Some extraordinary, but I believe correct\r\ninformation on this subject, is contained in the confessions of an\r\nEnglish opium-eater. The author took at one time 8000 drops daily, or\r\nabout nine ounces of laudanum.\r\n\r\nAn important topic relative to the effects of opium on man is its\r\noperation on the body when used continuously in the manner practised by\r\nopium-eaters. This subject was brought forcibly under my notice in 1831,\r\nin consequence of a remarkable civil trial, in which I was concerned as\r\na medical witness,—that of Sir W. Forbes and company against the\r\nEdinburgh Life Assurance Company. The late Earl of Mar effected\r\ninsurances on his life to a large amount while addicted to the vice of\r\nopium-eating; which was not made known at the time to the insurance\r\ncompany. He died two years afterwards of jaundice and dropsy. The\r\ncompany refused payment, on the ground that his lordship had concealed\r\nfrom them a habit which tends to shorten life; and Sir W. Forbes and\r\ncompany, who held the policy of insurance as security for money lent to\r\nthe earl, raised an action to recover payment.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of inquiries made on this occasion, I became for the\r\nfirst time aware of the frequency of the vice of opium-eating among both\r\nthe lower orders and the upper ranks of society; and at the same time\r\nsatisfied myself, that the habit is often easily concealed from the most\r\nintimate friends,—that physicians even in extensive practice seldom\r\nbecome acquainted with such cases,—that the effects of the habit on the\r\nconstitution are not always what either professional persons or the\r\nunprofessional would expect,—and generally that practitioners and\r\ntoxicologists possess little or no precise information on the matter. In\r\nwhat is about to be offered on the subject, some facts will be stated\r\nwhich appear to me interesting, and may induce others to contribute\r\ntheir knowledge towards filling up so important a blank in medico-legal\r\ntoxicology.\r\n\r\nThe general impression is, that the practice of opium-eating injures the\r\nhealth and shortens life. But the scientific physician in modern times\r\nhas seen so many proofs of the inaccuracy of popular impressions\r\nrelative to the operation of various agents on health and\r\nlongevity,[1747] that he will not allow himself to be hastily carried\r\nalong in the present instance by vague popular belief. The general\r\nconviction of the tendency of opium-eating to shorten life has obviously\r\nbeen derived in part from the injurious effects which opium used\r\nmedicinally has on the nervous system and functions of the alimentary\r\ncanal,—and partly on the reports of travellers in Turkey and Persia, who\r\nhave enjoyed opportunities of watching the life and habits of\r\nopium-eaters on a great scale. The statements of travellers, however,\r\nare so vague that they cannot be turned to use with any confidence in a\r\nscientific inquiry. Chardin, one of the earliest (1671) and best of\r\nmodern travellers in Turkey, merely says the opium-eater becomes\r\nrheumatic at fifty, and “never reaches an extreme old age;”[1748] and\r\nhis successors have seldom been more precise,—no one having given\r\ninformation as to the diseases which it tends to engender. By far the\r\ngreater number of authorities, however, agree in representing the\r\npractice to be hurtful. Mr. Madden, a recent and professional authority,\r\neven alleges that it is very rare for an opium-eater at Constantinople\r\nto outlive his thirtieth year, if he began the practice early. On the\r\nother hand, a few late observers deny altogether the accuracy of these\r\nstatements. To this number belongs Dr. Burnes of the Bombay army; whose\r\nopinion is worthy of notice, because he had ample opportunities of\r\nobservation during his residence in Cutch and at the Court of Sinde for\r\nseveral years prior to 1831. From what he there witnessed, Dr. Burnes is\r\ninclined to think “it will be found in general that the natives do not\r\nsuffer much from the use of opium,”—that “this powerful narcotic does\r\nnot seem to destroy the powers of the body, nor to enervate the mind to\r\nthe degree that might be imagined.”[1749] Dr. Macpherson of the Madras\r\narmy, who had occasion to observe the effects of the parallel practice\r\nof opium-smoking in China, coincides in opinion with Dr. Burnes. He\r\nsays, “were we to be led away by the popular opinion that the habitual\r\nuse of opium injures the health and shortens life, we should expect to\r\nfind the Chinese a shrivelled, emaciated, idiotic race. On the contrary,\r\nalthough the habit of smoking opium is universal among rich and poor, we\r\nfind them to be a powerful, muscular, and athletic people, and the lower\r\norders more intelligent and far superior in mental acquirements to those\r\nof corresponding rank in our own country.”[1750]\r\n\r\nThe familiar effects of the medicinal use of opium in disordering the\r\nnervous system and the digestive functions constitute a better reason,\r\nthan the loose statements of eastern travellers, for the popular\r\nimpression of the danger of its habitual and long-continued use. Yet\r\nthis consideration ought not to be allowed too much weight; because the\r\nfunctions of the nervous system and of digestion may be deranged by\r\nother causes, for example by hysteria, without necessarily and\r\nmaterially shortening life. It is desirable therefore to appeal if\r\npossible to precise facts.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of twenty-five cases, the particulars of\r\nwhich I have obtained from various quarters. The general result rather\r\ntends to throw doubt over the popular opinion.—1. A lady about thirty,\r\nin good health, has taken it largely for twenty years, having been\r\ngradually habituated to it from childhood by the villany of her maid,\r\nwho gave it frequently to keep her quiet. 2. A female who died of\r\nconsumption at the age of forty-two, had taken about a drachm of solid\r\nopium for ten years, but had given up the practice for three years\r\nbefore her death, and led in other respects a licentious life from an\r\nearly age. 3. A well-known literary author, about sixty years of age,\r\nhas taken laudanum for thirty-five years, with occasional short\r\nintermissions, and sometimes an enormous quantity, but enjoys tolerable\r\nbodily health. 4. A lady, after being in the practice of drinking\r\nlaudanum for at least twenty years, died at the age of fifty,—of what\r\ndisease I have been unable to learn. 5. A lady about fifty-five, who\r\nenjoys good health, has taken opium many years, and at present uses\r\nthree ounces of laudanum daily. 6. A lady about sixty gave it up after\r\nusing it constantly for twenty years, during which she enjoyed good\r\nhealth; and subsequently she resumed it. 7. Lord Mar after using\r\nlaudanum for thirty years, at times to the amount of two or three ounces\r\ndaily, died at the age of fifty-seven of jaundice and dropsy; but he was\r\na martyr to rheumatism, and besides lived rather freely. 8. A woman, who\r\nhad been in the practice of taking about two ounces of laudanum daily\r\nfor very many years, died at the age of sixty or upwards. 9. An eminent\r\nliterary character, who died about the age of sixty-three, was in the\r\npractice of drinking laudanum to excess from the age of fifteen; and his\r\ndaily allowance was sometimes a quart of a mixture consisting of three\r\nparts of laudanum and one of alcohol. 10. A lady, who died lately at the\r\nage of seventy-six, took laudanum in the quantity of half an ounce daily\r\nfor nearly forty years. 11. An old woman died not long ago at Leith at\r\nthe age of eighty, who had taken about half an ounce of laudanum daily\r\nfor nearly forty years, and enjoyed tolerable health all the time. 12.\r\nVisrajee, a celebrated Cutchee chief, mentioned by Dr. Burnes, had taken\r\nopium largely all his life, and was alive when Dr. Burnes drew up his\r\nNarrative, at the age of eighty, “paralyzed by years, but his mind\r\nunimpaired.”[1751]\r\n\r\nFor the particulars of the remaining cases I am indebted to Dr. Tait,\r\nsurgeon of police in this city. 13. M. C., a ruddy, healthy-looking\r\nwoman, sixty years of age, has taken laudanum for twenty-five years to\r\nthe extent of half an ounce daily in a single dose. 14. M. H., a flabby,\r\ndissipated-looking woman of thirty-six, has taken for ten years thirty\r\ngrains of opium daily in three doses. 15. M. T., a widow, forty-eight\r\nyears of age, who takes twice daily a dose of one fluidrachm of\r\nlaudanum, and has done so for fourteen years, cannot observe any\r\npermanent injury except diminution of appetite. 16. Mrs. G., aged\r\ntwenty-four, has taken a single dose of sixty drops regularly at\r\nbed-time for five years, and has not suffered in health in any respect,\r\nexcept that she is costive. 17. F. S., a thin, sallow woman of forty-six\r\nyears of age, has taken a fluidrachm of laudanum three times a day for\r\nten years, cannot take food without it, but is so well as to be able to\r\nget up regularly at six in the morning. 18. H. S., a shrivelled\r\nold-looking woman, who for thirty-eight years had taken daily towards a\r\ndrachm of opium in one dose, and who latterly was strong, lively, and of\r\ngood appetite, died recently at the age of sixty-nine. 19. Mrs. S., who\r\nhas taken about a scruple of opium for twenty-one years, is a tall,\r\nactive, old-looking woman of fifty-seven, enjoys good health when she\r\nuses the opium, but suffers from an affection like delirium tremens,\r\nwhen she cannot get her usual quantity. 20. M. A., aged thirty-one, has\r\ntaken half a drachm of opium daily in two doses for ten years, was a\r\nthin, drunken, starved-looking prostitute some years ago, but, having\r\nreformed her ways, is now “a fine-looking, bouncing woman,” younger in\r\nappearance than formerly, and not liable to any suffering either before\r\nor after her doses, except that she cannot take food without them. 21.\r\nMiss M., who has taken ten grains of opium three times a day for five\r\nyears, is a healthy, florid young woman of twenty-seven, liable to\r\ncostiveness, and, when without her opium, to languor and want of\r\nappetite, but otherwise free of complaint. 22. Mrs. ——, a plump,\r\nhale-looking old lady of seventy, has taken opium for six and twenty\r\nyears, and for some years to the extent of a drachm daily in two doses.\r\nShe thinks her health improved by it, and has suffered no inconvenience\r\nexcept merely costiveness, and always aversion to food till she gets her\r\ndose. 23. J. B., aged 23, has taken laudanum since she was fourteen, and\r\nsome time past to the amount of an ounce or ten drachms in three or four\r\ndoses daily. She has only menstruated twice since first using the\r\nlaudanum, has bilious vomiting once a month, and looks older than her\r\nyears, but is otherwise quite healthy, and has two children. 24. Mrs.\r\nM’C., a ruddy young-looking woman of forty-two, has taken opium during\r\ntwo years for cough and pain in the stomach, latterly to the extent of\r\nten grains twice a day. She has never menstruated since, but has enjoyed\r\nbetter health, and in particular has a good appetite after her dose, and\r\nhas got entirely quit of a former tendency to constipation. 25. An army\r\nofficer’s widow, fifty-five years old, healthy and young-looking,\r\nalthough subject to costiveness and rather defective appetite, has taken\r\nlaudanum for eleven years, and latterly opium to the extent of fifteen\r\ngrains morning and evening.\r\n\r\nThese facts tend on the whole rather to show, that the practice of\r\neating opium is not so injurious, and an opium eater’s life not so\r\nuninsurable, as is commonly thought; and that an insured person, who did\r\nnot make known this habit, could scarcely be considered guilty of\r\nconcealment to the effect of voiding his insurance. But I am far from\r\nthinking,—as several represent who have quoted this work,—that what has\r\nnow been stated can with justice be held to establish such important\r\ninferences; for there is an obvious reason, why in an inquiry of this\r\nkind those instances chiefly should come under notice where the\r\nconstitution has escaped injury, cases fatal in early life being more\r\napt to be lost sight of, or more likely to be concealed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, insurance companies and insurance physicians ought to be\r\naware, that not a few persons in the upper ranks of life are confirmed\r\nopium-eaters without even their intimate friends knowing it. And the\r\nreason is, that at the time the opium-eater is visible to his friends,\r\nnamely, during the period of excitement, there is frequently nothing in\r\nhis behaviour or appearance to attract particular attention. From the\r\ninformation I have received, it appears that the British opium-eater is\r\nby no means subject to the extraordinary excitement of mind and body\r\ndescribed by travellers as the effect of opium-eating in Turkey and\r\nPersia; but that the common effect merely is to remove torpor and\r\nsluggishness, and make him in the eyes of his friends an active and\r\nconversible man. The prevailing notions of the nature of the excitement\r\nfrom eating opium are therefore very much exaggerated. Another singular\r\ncircumstance I have ascertained is, that constipation is by no means a\r\ngeneral effect of the continued use of opium. In some of the cases\r\nmentioned above no laxatives have been required; and in others a gentle\r\nlaxative once a week is sufficient.\r\n\r\nIn the civil suit regarding Lord Mar’s insurances, the insurance company\r\nwas at first found not entitled to refuse payment,—not, however, on the\r\nground that the habit of opium-eating is harmless to longevity,—but\r\nchiefly on a technical ground, implying that they did not make inquiry\r\ninto his habits with the care usually observed by insurance companies,\r\nand were therefore to be understood as accepting the life at a venture.\r\nA new trial was granted by the court on the ground of the judge’s charge\r\nhaving been not according to evidence; but on this occasion the parties\r\ncompromised the case.[1752]\r\n\r\nThe previous remarks on the symptoms of poisoning with opium in man have\r\nbeen confined to its effects when swallowed. But it was mentioned under\r\nthe head of its mode of action, that this poison has been known to act\r\nwith energy upon animals through every channel by which it can be\r\nintroduced into the system. It is natural to expect that the same will\r\nbe the case with man also.\r\n\r\nThe only other modes in which poisoning with opium is reported to have\r\nbeen produced in man, besides administration by the mouth, have been by\r\ninjections into the anus, by application to the skin deprived of its\r\ncuticle, perhaps even also to the unbroken skin, and by its introduction\r\ninto the external opening of the ear.\r\n\r\nIn the Journal de Chimie Médicale, an instance is shortly noticed of a\r\nlady who was poisoned by the administration of too strong an anodyne\r\ninjection prepared by herself from fresh poppy-heads. She\r\nrecovered.[1753]\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed in France that opium acts more energetically\r\nthrough the medium of the rectum, than through the stomach. Orfila in\r\nparticular has endeavoured to establish this proposition by experiments\r\non animals, and quotations from cases recorded by some authors of its\r\naction upon man.[1754] But neither the experiments nor the quotations\r\nappear to me satisfactory; and the rule they go to support is completely\r\nat variance with the practice pursued in the medicinal administration of\r\nthe drug in Britain. It is the custom to give at least twice as much in\r\nan enema as in a draught. I have given by injection, without producing\r\nmore than the usual somnolency, one drachm and even two drachms by\r\nmeasure of laudanum, a dose which, were Orfila’s statement correct,\r\nwould prove fatal.\r\n\r\nAs to the action of opium through the skin when deprived of its\r\ncuticle, I am not acquainted with any fatal case of the kind, but have\r\nno doubt that such may happen. One of my friends very nearly lost his\r\nlife in the way alluded to. He had applied an opium-poultice to the\r\nscrotum to allay the violent irritation caused by a blister, and fell\r\ninto a state of profound sopor, which was luckily interrupted by a\r\nvisitor, so that the cause was discovered before it was too late. An\r\ninstance of the same kind has also been published by M. Pelletan. A\r\nchild two months old very nearly perished, in consequence of a cerate\r\ncontaining fifteen drops of laudanum having been kept for twenty-four\r\nhours on a slight excoriation produced by a fold of the skin. When the\r\ncause of illness was discovered, the child had been for some hours\r\nalmost completely insensible, with a slow, obscure pulse, and\r\noccasional convulsions.[1755]\r\n\r\nBut perhaps opium may in some circumstances act even through the\r\nunbroken skin. It has certainly been often applied in this way to\r\nrelieve local pain without avail. Yet on the other hand its effect is at\r\ntimes unequivocal; and the following incidents seem to show, that it may\r\neven prove fatal, both when the skin is healthy, and in certain diseased\r\nstates of the integuments. A young dramatic writer in Paris was directed\r\nby his father, a physician, to apply over the stomach a poultice\r\nmoistened with a few drops of laudanum. The patient, in order to relieve\r\nhis pain more quickly, poured the whole contents of the bottle over the\r\npoultice, and soon fell into a deep sleep. Prompt assistance was\r\nobtained, but proved of no avail, and death is said to have ensued with\r\ngreat rapidity.[1756] A soldier affected with erysipelas of the leg, had\r\na linseed poultice applied, which his surgeon ordered to be sprinkled\r\nwith 15 drops of laudanum. Next morning the patient was found in a state\r\nof deep sopor, accompanied with convulsive twitches of the muscles of\r\nthe face and limbs; and in no long time he expired. His soporose state\r\nturned the surgeon’s attention to the poultice, which he found coloured\r\nyellow and smelling strongly of opium; and on removing it he discovered\r\nthat it was completely soaked with laudanum, which the attendant had\r\ncarelessly poured on it to the extent of an ounce. The patient died\r\nnotwithstanding all the remedies which his state called for; and the\r\nviscera were found quite healthy; but in many places the blood is said\r\nto have had a strong odour of opium.[1757]\r\n\r\nIn an instance reported by M. Tournon of Bordeaux, death is supposed to\r\nhave arisen from the introduction of opium into the external opening of\r\nthe ear, as a remedy for ear-ache. It is possible that fatal poisoning\r\nmay thus be induced by laudanum too freely and frequently renewed: but\r\nit seems very unlikely that death was owing to opium in the instance in\r\nquestion, since it was used in the solid form, and in the quantity of\r\nfour grains; so that the dose was small, and absorption must have been\r\nvery slow. The account merely states that the patient fell asleep, but\r\nhis sleep was that of death.[1758]\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of the Action of Morphia, Narcotine, Codeïa, and Meconic Acid._\r\n\r\nThe action and symptoms caused by two active principles of opium,\r\nmorphia, and narcotine, have been examined by many experimentalists.\r\n\r\nThe action of _morphia_ is nearly the same as that of opium, but more\r\nenergetic. In its solid state it has little effect, being nearly\r\ninsoluble. But when dissolved in olive oil, or in alcohol, or in weak\r\nacids, it excites in animals the same symptoms as opium.\r\nExperimentalists are not yet agreed as to its power. The trial of\r\nCastaing gave rise to a physiological inquiry by three French\r\nphysicians, Deguise, Dupuy, and Leuret, who assigned to it feeble\r\nproperties; but more reliance is usually placed in the experiments of\r\nOrfila, who found that one part of morphia is equal in energy to two\r\nparts of the watery extract, and to four parts of crude opium. The\r\nobservations I have made on the medicinal effects of morphia and its\r\nmuriate, lead me to believe that half a grain is fully equal in power to\r\nthree grains of the best Turkey-opium. Probably those who have observed\r\nbut slight effects from it have accidentally used narcotine instead of\r\nit; for at one time they were often confounded together.\r\n\r\nOn man morphia acts like opium; it produces somnolency. It was at one\r\ntime thought that in medicinal doses it does not produce either the\r\ndisagreeable subsequent or idiosyncratic effects of opium; Magendie made\r\nsome observations to this purport;[1759] and Dr. Quadri of Naples was\r\nled to the same conclusion.[1760] Others, however, have doubted the\r\naccuracy of these authors, and opposite results appear to have been\r\nprocured by some. My own experience with the muriate of morphia inclines\r\nme to concur in opinion with Magendie and Quadri.\r\n\r\nThe effects of morphia on man in fatal doses have hitherto been observed\r\nin a few cases only. An instance, which was the occasion of a criminal\r\ntrial at Aberdeen in 1842, has been communicated to me by Dr. Traill,\r\nwho was consulted in the case on the part of the crown. A schoolmaster\r\ngave ten grains of the muriate to a girl immediately after she came out\r\nof an epileptic fit. In fifteen minutes she seemed to fall asleep; she\r\ncontinued in this state for some hours before it was discovered that she\r\nwas in a state of stupor, from which she could not be roused; and she\r\nexpired twelve hours after the poison was administered. A similar case\r\noccasioned by ten grains, and also fatal, occurred at Cheltenham in\r\n1839.\r\n\r\nOrfila relates the particulars of the case of a young Parisian graduate,\r\nwho swallowed twenty-two grains for the purpose of self-destruction. In\r\nten minutes he felt heat in the stomach and hindhead, with excessive\r\nitchiness; in three hours and a half he had also a sense of pricking in\r\nthe eyes, with dimness of vision; and in an hour more he for the first\r\ntime felt approaching stupor. Half an hour afterwards, when the people\r\nof the house entered his room he could not see them, though he was\r\nsensible enough to be able to reply to their inquiries, that he lay in\r\nbed because he had not slept the night before. Soon after this he fell\r\ninto a state of profound stupor and lost all consciousness. In thirteen\r\nhours he was visited by Orfila, who found him cold, quite comatose, and\r\naffected with locked-jaw; the pupils were feebly dilated, the pulse 120,\r\nthe breathing hurried and stertorous, the belly tense and tympanitic;\r\nand there were occasional convulsions, with intense itching of the skin.\r\nBy means of copious venesection, sinapisms, ammoniated friction,\r\nstimulant clysters, ice on the head, and acidulous drinks, he was\r\ngradually roused, so that in six hours he recognised his physician. In\r\nthe subsequent night and following day he had difficult and scanty\r\nmicturition, with pain in the kidneys and bladder, and difficulty in\r\nswallowing; but these symptoms went off during the second night; and on\r\nthe third morning he was quite well.[1761] The itching of the skin\r\nremarked in this case is considered by M. Bally an invariable symptom of\r\nthe operation of morphia even in medicinal doses.[1762] It is not,\r\nhowever, always produced.\r\n\r\nAnother case, which occurred at Lunéville, is very remarkable in its\r\ncircumstances. A young man addicted to opium-eating, but who had left\r\noff the practice for a twelvemonth, took first ten grains, and in ten\r\nminutes forty grains more of acetate of morphia. In five minutes he had\r\nexcessive general feebleness and a sense of impending dissolution, which\r\nforced him to confess what he had done. In fifteen minutes more M.\r\nCastara, who describes the particulars, found him motionless, almost\r\ncomatose, and breathing laboriously. The limbs were flaccid, the pupils\r\ncontracted, the face and lips livid, the skin warm and moist, the pulse\r\nfull and hard, and deglutition impossible. Tartar-emetic was ordered,\r\nbut could not be administered. He was then bled at the arm to eighteen\r\nounces; upon which he started as from sleep, rubbed his eyes, said every\r\nthing turned round him, and that he could not see the people present.\r\nWhen left to himself he quickly fell into a calm slumber; but if kept\r\nawake, he told collectedly all that happened before he became comatose.\r\nHe complained chiefly of intense itching and a general sense of\r\nbruising. In an hour, by keeping him constantly roused, consciousness\r\nwas almost restored, and this without vomiting having been produced,\r\nthough two grains of tartar-emetic had been swallowed and three\r\nadministered by the rectum. In four hours after he swallowed the poison\r\nhe vomited freely and had diarrhœa. He then steadily recovered, the\r\nsleepiness continued all next day, and the itching of the skin even\r\nlonger.[1763]\r\n\r\nM. Julia-Fontenelle met with a case of poisoning with this alkaloid, in\r\nconsequence of its having been administered with a clyster in the form\r\nof sulphate. The subject was a child five years old, the dose five\r\ngrains, the symptoms those of apoplexy, and death supervened within\r\ntwenty-four hours.[1764]\r\n\r\nAnother case worthy of particular mention is that of the French\r\ngentleman who was supposed to have been poisoned by Dr. Castaing. It is\r\nnot a pure one, for besides the symptoms of a consumptive complaint\r\nunder which he had laboured for some time, there were circumstances in\r\nhis last illness which indicated the administration of other deleterious\r\nsubstances. About thirty-six hours before his death, however, they were\r\nexactly such as might be expected from a large dose of morphia. About\r\nfive minutes after the administration of a draught by the prisoner, the\r\ngentleman was attacked with convulsions, and not long afterwards his\r\nphysician found him quite insensible, unable to swallow, bathed in a\r\ncold sweat, with a small pulse, a burning skin, the jaws locked, the\r\nneck rigid, the belly tense, and the limbs affected with spasmodic\r\nconvulsions. In this state he seems to have continued till his death.\r\nThe only appearances found in the dead body, which bore any relation to\r\nthe poison suspected, were congestion of blood and serous effusion in\r\nthe vessels of the cerebral membranes. If morphia was the cause of\r\ndeath, it is highly probable that, besides what was administered\r\nthirty-six hours before he died, several doses were given subsequently;\r\notherwise, from what is known of the action of opium, the narcotism\r\ncould scarcely have lasted uninterruptedly for so long a period.[1765]\r\n\r\nFor the following extraordinary case I am indebted to one of my pupils,\r\nMr. Clark of Montrose: A woman took one morning by mistake ten grains of\r\npure muriate of morphia, which had been prepared not long before by Mr.\r\nClark in my laboratory, and was freed of codeïa. The mistake having been\r\ndiscovered almost immediately, means were taken to prevent any ill\r\neffects from the accident, and within half an hour after the poison was\r\nswallowed, the stomach was completely cleared by the stomach-pump. At\r\nthis time she was quite sensible. But stupor quickly came on after the\r\npoison was evacuated, and deep imperturbable coma gradually formed, so\r\nthat nothing could rouse her in the slightest degree except cold\r\naffusion of the head and chest, which caused faint signs of returning\r\nconsciousness. Before night she expired, though all the usual remedies\r\nwere resorted to. An inspection of the body was not obtained, which is\r\nmuch to be regretted, since without it the case is quite obscure. I do\r\nnot know a single instance of fatal coma from opium where the proper\r\nremedies were resorted to before the stupor commenced; and death in such\r\ncircumstances is so inconceivable, that we must ascribe the result in\r\nthis case to apoplexy, either incidentally concurring, or brought on by\r\nthe operation of the poison.\r\n\r\nMorphia, like opium, may occasion serous effects when too freely applied\r\nto a blistered surface. In a case related by M. Dupont, four-tenths of a\r\ngrain of acetate of morphia, applied to a blister on the side, caused in\r\ntwenty minutes dimness of vision, vomiting, and delirium; and though it\r\nwas then removed, the patient had afterwards continued vomiting, dilated\r\npupils, and great feebleness of the pulse. Recovery took place, but the\r\npatient was not quite free of incoherence next day.[1766] The dose here\r\nwas so small, and the symptoms were so unlike the usual effects of\r\nmorphia, that doubts arise whether the case was really one of poisoning.\r\n\r\nThe effects of _narcotine_ have been examined experimentally by Magendie\r\nand Orfila; but their results do not coincide. According to Orfila it is\r\nnot easy to poison dogs with it, as it excites vomiting and is\r\ndischarged. But when the gullet is tied, the animal dies in two, three\r\nor four days, without any remarkable symptom but languor and hard\r\nbreathing.[1767] In these experiments it was dissolved in olive oil; it\r\ndoes not act at all in the solid state. Magendie found that it produces\r\nin dogs a state like reverie, accompanied with convulsions. They lie\r\nstill except when convulsed, and they are apparently asleep or dreaming;\r\nbut they are really alive to external objects, and even in a state of\r\nacute irritability. In short, he considers the symptoms to constitute an\r\naggravated form of the subsequent and idiosyncratic effects caused by\r\nopium on man. Vinegar, he says, destroys altogether the poisonous\r\nproperties of narcotine. According to Orfila it only weakens them.\r\nMuriatic acid would seem to annihilate them entirely; for Orfila found\r\nno effect in dogs from forty grains dissolved in water with the aid of\r\nmuriatic acid; and Bally gave sixty grains in like manner to a patient\r\nwithout injury.[1768] Forty grains dissolved by sulphuric acid, proved\r\nfatal to a dog in twenty-four hours.[1769]\r\n\r\nNarcotine, like other narcotic poisons, is more powerful when introduced\r\nat once into the blood, but produces nearly the same effects as when it\r\nis swallowed. Orfila found that a single grain was as powerful through\r\nthe former, as eight grains through the latter channel.[1770]\r\nDieffenbach observed that half a grain dissolved in water by means of a\r\ndrop or two of hydrochloric acid killed cats in five minutes when\r\ninjected into a vein, and always produced congestion within the head,\r\nand extravasation on the surface of the cerebellum. A remarkable\r\ncircumstance observed in the course of his experiments was, that\r\nleeches, applied to a rabbit under the influence of narcotine, died\r\nimmediately in convulsions; and that a portion of the blood of the same\r\nrabbit when injected into the vein of another produced drowsiness,\r\nlanguor, and pandiculation for nearly a day.[1771]\r\n\r\nThe effects of narcotine on man have not been much inquired into. From\r\nthe only researches on the subject I have yet seen, those of Dr. Wibmer\r\nof Munich, it appears to be but a feeble poison. He found by experiment\r\non himself, that two grains dissolved in olive oil produced merely\r\nslight transient headache; that eight grains dissolved by means of\r\nmuriatic acid had no effect at all; and that the same quantity of solid\r\nnarcotine occasioned temporary headache, and in twenty-eight hours a\r\nsingular state of excitement, with trembling of the hands, restlessness,\r\nand inability to fix the thoughts on any object. These effects went off\r\nin a few hours.[1772]\r\n\r\nThe effects of _codeïa_ have been examined by Dr. Kunkel. He found that\r\ntwelve grains, dissolved in water and introduced into the stomach,\r\nkilled a rabbit in three minutes; that six grains in solution when\r\ninjected into the cellular tissue occasioned death in little more than\r\ntwo hours; that the same quantity administered by the mouth sometimes\r\nhad little effect; that when given in powder its action was very feeble;\r\nand that the symptoms were excitement of the pulse, convulsions, and\r\ntetanus, without any tendency to sopor or somnolency.[1773] Hence codeïa\r\nis conceived to be a stimulant of the nervous system, and consequently\r\nthe cause of the excitant effects sometimes produced by opium. It may be\r\ndoubted, however, whether its proportion in opium is sufficient for\r\nexplaining these effects.\r\n\r\n_Meconic acid_ is inert. Sertuerner, indeed, thought the meconate of\r\nsoda acted as a powerful poison in some experiments made on himself and\r\non dogs; but more careful researches have since proved that he was\r\nmisled by some error. Sömmering found that ten grains of meconic acid or\r\nmeconate of soda had no effect whatever on dogs.[1774] Subsequently, in\r\nconsequence of two people having died suddenly at Turin after taking\r\neach a grain of the acid, some careful experiments were made by Drs.\r\nFeneglio and Blengini, who gave eight grains to dogs, crows, and frogs,\r\nand four grains to various men, without remarking any injurious effects\r\nwhatever.[1775]\r\n\r\nThe _distilled water_ of opium was formerly considered an active poison;\r\nbut Orfila found it nearly or altogether inert. Two pounds introduced\r\ninto the stomach of a dog, and two ounces and a half injected into a\r\nvein, had no effect whatever.[1776]\r\n\r\n\r\n       SECTION III.—_Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Opium._\r\n\r\nIn discussing this subject the appearances in the best marked cases will\r\nbe first noticed; and then some account; will be given of the variations\r\nto which they are liable.\r\n\r\nIn Knape’s Annals there is a good example of the most aggravated state\r\nof the appearances left by opium. It is the case of an infant who was\r\nkilled in the course of a night by a decoction of poppy-heads. There was\r\nmuch lividity over the whole back part of the body. All the sinuses and\r\nvessels of the brain were gorged with fluid blood; and a good deal of\r\nserosity was found in the ventricles and base of the skull. The pharynx\r\nwas red. The lungs were distended, and so gorged with fluid blood, that\r\nit ran out in a stream when they were cut. The cavities of the heart\r\ncontained the same fluid blood. There was some redness in the villous\r\ncoat of the stomach and intestines; and poppy-seeds were found in the\r\nstomach. Although the body had been kept only two days in the month of\r\nFebruary, the belly emitted a putrid odour when it was laid open.[1777]\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon these appearances, it may be first remarked, that\r\nturgescence of the vessels in the brain, and watery effusion into the\r\nventricles, and on the surface of the brain, are generally met with. Dr.\r\nBright mentions an instance where unusual turgescence was found, and on\r\nthe surface of the brain a spot of slight ecchymosis as big as a crown\r\npiece.[1778] I have seen turgescence of vessels and serous effusion in\r\none instance to a considerable extent: each ventricle contained three\r\ndrachms of fluid, the arachnoid membrane on the surface of the brain was\r\nmuch infiltered, and the vessels both in the substance and on the\r\nsurface of the brain were considerably gorged with blood. But congestion\r\nand effusion are by no means universal: in a case I examined judicially\r\nin November, 1822, which proved fatal in about seven hours, there was\r\nneither unusual congestion nor effusion. In the remarks on the diseased\r\nappearances caused by the narcotics generally, it was observed that\r\nextravasation of blood is a very rare effect of opium. A good example of\r\nthe kind, however, is related by Mr. Jewel of London. It was the case of\r\na young married female, who died eight hours after taking two ounces of\r\nlaudanum. Several clots were found in the substance of the brain, one of\r\nwhich, in the anterior right lobe, was an inch long.[1779] A similar\r\ncase, which occurred to Dr. Elliotson, has been mentioned already at p.\r\n546. There is little doubt that poisoning with opium may cause\r\nextravasation, by developing a disposition to apoplexy; but considering\r\nthe very great rarity of this appearance in persons killed by opium, it\r\nmay reasonably be questioned whether extravasation can be produced\r\nwithout some predisposition co-operating.\r\n\r\nThe lungs are sometimes found gorged with blood, as in many cases of\r\napoplexy. They were so in the soldier mentioned in the Journal\r\nUniversel, who died in convulsions. They were in the same state in a\r\npatient of Dr. Home, a man who died in the Infirmary here in 1825, four\r\nhours after taking two ounces of laudanum in six ounces of whisky; and\r\nlikewise in the case quoted from Pyl, in which sixty grains of solid\r\nopium were taken. But this appearance is not more constant than\r\ncongestion in the brain. Orfila never found it in dogs, and in three\r\ncases I have examined the lungs were perfectly natural. Perhaps they are\r\nmore usually turgid when death is preceded by convulsions. They were\r\nparticularly so in the case of the soldier above mentioned, and likewise\r\nin another case of the same nature recorded in Rust’s Magazin.[1780]\r\n\r\nThe stomach, as in Knape’s case, is occasionally red, and in the woman\r\nmentioned by Lassus, who died after swallowing thirty-six grains, it is\r\nsaid to have been inflamed. But even redness is rare, and decided\r\ninflammation probably never occurs. In four cases I have examined, the\r\nvillous coat was quite healthy; and it was equally so in another related\r\nin Knape and Hecker’s Register.[1781]\r\n\r\nLividity of the skin is almost always present more or less, and\r\nsometimes it is excessive. In one of the cases I examined it was\r\nuniversal over the depending surface of the body.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the blood is always fluid. This certainly appears\r\nto be very generally the case. For example, the blood was fluid in the\r\ncase of the soldier who died in convulsions, in Dr. Home’s patient, in\r\nfour adults I have examined, in Dr. Traill’s case of death from morphia,\r\nand likewise in Pyl’s case. But at the same time this condition of the\r\nblood is not invariable: In the case related in Knape and Hecker’s\r\nRegister, it was coagulated in the left cavities of the heart; in\r\nanother related by Petit in Corvisart’s Journal, there were clots in\r\nboth ventricles;[1782] and in the case of the first infant mentioned in\r\npage 549, clots were also found in both ventricles. In Alibert’s case a\r\nlarge fibrinous concretion was found in the heart, clearly showing that\r\nthe blood had coagulated after death as usual.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the body is often apt to pass rapidly into putrefaction.\r\nIn one of the cases I examined, although the body had been kept only\r\nthirty hours in a cool place in the month of December, the cuticle was\r\neasily peeled off, the joints were flaccid, and an acid smell was\r\nexhaled. In Réaumur’s case, that of a young man who died in fifteen\r\nhours, in consequence of his companions in a drunken frolic having mixed\r\na drachm of opium in his wine, the body soon became covered with large\r\nblue stains, and gave out an insupportable odour. A French physician has\r\nrelated in the Journal de Médecine a still more pointed case of a lady\r\nwho died seven hours after taking a large quantity of laudanum by\r\nmistake, and whose body was so far gone in putrefaction fourteen hours\r\nafter death, that the dissection could not be delayed any longer. The\r\nhair and cuticle separated on the slightest friction, and the stomach,\r\nintestines, and large vessels were distended with air.[1783]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether this is a constant appearance or not. In one case\r\nI examined, the body was free from putrefaction forty-eight hours after\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAlthough opium is generally believed to suspend all the secretions and\r\nexcretions but the sweat, instances have been met with where a great\r\ncollection of urine was found in the bladder after death. In a paper on\r\nthe signs of death by opium, in Augustin’s Repertorium, it is stated\r\nthat Welper of Berlin always found the bladder full of urine, and the\r\nkidneys gorged with blood, both in man and animals.[1784] I am not\r\nprepared to say how far this is a common condition, as the state of the\r\nurinary organs is seldom noticed in published cases.\r\n\r\nIn the examination of the dead body unequivocal evidence will sometimes\r\nbe procured by the discovery of a portion of the poison in the stomach.\r\nBut it must not always be concluded that opium has not been swallowed,\r\nbecause the sense of smell, chemical analysis, and experiments on\r\nanimals fail to detect it. For, as previously remarked, the opium may\r\nnot remain in the stomach after death, though a large quantity was\r\nswallowed, and not vomited. This may arise from two causes. It may be\r\nall absorbed, as will often happen when it has been taken in the liquid\r\nform: or it may be partly absorbed and partly decomposed by the process\r\nof digestion. But in one or other of these ways it may certainly\r\ndisappear, and that in a very few hours only. Several instances to this\r\neffect have been already mentioned (pp. 57, 537). These remarks are\r\nimportant, because the fact is generally believed to be the reverse. Dr.\r\nParis, in his work on Medical Jurisprudence, has tended to propagate the\r\nmisconception, by asserting that in all fatal cases opium may be\r\ndetected in the stomach;[1785] and in the last edition of his\r\nToxicology, Orfila has overrated the facility and frequency with which\r\nan analysis may be conducted successfully. [See p. 538.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time there is no doubt that the poison may sometimes be\r\nfound in the stomach. In Knape and Hecker’s Register there is the case\r\nof a girl who died about eight hours after taking half an ounce of\r\nlaudanum; and the reporters found that an extract prepared from the\r\ncontents of the stomach caused deep sleep in frogs, chickens, and dogs,\r\nand threw some of them into a comatose state, which proved fatal.[1786]\r\nWildberg has related a very interesting case of a young lady of Berlin,\r\nwho had been seduced, and finding herself pregnant, swallowed about half\r\nan ounce of laudanum in the evening, and died during the night. In this\r\ninstance the contents of the stomach had a narcotic odour, and their\r\nextract when given to a young dog caused excessive sleep, reeling, palsy\r\nof the legs, convulsions, and death.[1787]\r\n\r\nM. Petit has related another case fatal in about ten hours, where the\r\ncontents of the stomach had the smell of opium; and their alcoholic\r\nextract had a bitter taste, and killed guinea-pigs, with symptoms of\r\nnarcotism.[1788] In a case related by Mayer in Rust’s Magazin, which\r\nalso proved fatal after an interval of ten hours, the poison, which in\r\nthis instance was the saffron-tincture, was distinctly detected in the\r\nstomach by a strong odour of opium and saffron.[1789] In a case where\r\nthe patient lived between thirteen and fourteen hours, that of the\r\nindividual for whose murder Stewart and his wife were executed at\r\nEdinburgh, Dr. Ure succeeded in detecting meconic acid in the contents\r\nof the stomach, which had been removed by the pump about three hours\r\nafter the opium was swallowed.[1790] In another case published by Mr.\r\nSkae of this city, where death was caused by half an ounce in thirteen\r\nhours, without any attempt having been made to evacuate the stomach, the\r\ncontents of that organ, treated according to the process at p. 534,\r\nyielded evident indications of morphia, and obscure evidence of meconic\r\nacid.[1791] Lastly, it may be added that in Dr. Traill’s case of\r\npoisoning with ten grains of muriate of morphia, when the contents of\r\nthe stomach were decomposed by magnesia, a solution was obtained from\r\nthe precipitate by rectified spirit, which, when concentrated, had the\r\nstrong bitter taste of morphia, and became yellow with nitric acid; and\r\nyet the individual survived no less than twelve hours.\r\n\r\nAn important fact, ascertained by MM. Orfila and Lesueur, is that\r\nneither opium nor the salts of morphia undergo decomposition by being\r\nlong in contact with decaying animal matter. Even after many months they\r\nmay be discovered; at least the putrefaction of the matter with which\r\nthey are mingled does not add any impediment in the way of their\r\ndiscovery. It is only necessary to observe that the alkaloid may be\r\nrendered insoluble by the evolution of ammonia, which separates it from\r\nits state of combination.[1792]\r\n\r\n\r\n        SECTION IV.—_Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Opium._\r\n\r\nThe treatment of poisoning with opium, owing partly to the numerous\r\ncases that have been published, and partly to the experiments of Orfila\r\non the supposed antidotes,—is now well understood.\r\n\r\nThe primary object is to remove the poison from the stomach. This is\r\nproper even in the rare cases in which vomiting occurs spontaneously. It\r\nis by no means easy to remove all the opium by vomiting, especially if\r\nit was taken in the solid state; for it becomes so intimately mixed with\r\nthe lining mucus of the villous coat, that it is never thoroughly\r\nremoved till the mucus is also removed, which is always effected with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the poison is to be accomplished in one of three ways, by\r\nemetics administered in the usual manner, by the stomach-pump, or by the\r\ninjection of emetics into the veins.\r\n\r\nBy far the best emetic is the _sulphate of zinc_ in the dose of half a\r\ndrachm or two scruples, which may be repeated after a short interval, if\r\nthe first dose fails to act. In order to insure its action it is of\r\ngreat use to keep the patient roused as much as possible,—a point which\r\nis often forgotten.—The _sulphate of copper_ has been used by some as an\r\nemetic; but it is not so certain as the sulphate of zinc. Besides, as it\r\nis a much more virulent poison, it may prove injurious, if retained long\r\nin the stomach. In Dr. Marcet’s case the patient, after recovering from\r\nthe lethargic symptoms, suffered much from pain in the throat and\r\nstomach, occasioned probably by the sulphate of copper which he took\r\nremaining some time undischarged. _Tartar emetic_, from the uncertainty\r\nof its action when given in considerable doses, is even worse adapted\r\nfor such cases. This is illustrated by a case in the seventh volume of\r\nthe Medical and Surgical Journal, the same which has already been\r\nreferred to as exemplifying the occasional occurrence of convulsions and\r\ndelirium in poisoning with opium. A scruple of tartar emetic was\r\nadministered to cause vomiting, but to no purpose. When it had remained\r\nfifteen minutes, sulphate of zinc was also given, and with immediate\r\neffect. But the patient, after recovering from the sopor, was attacked\r\nwith pains in the stomach and bowels, and with tenesmus, which lasted\r\nseveral days.\r\n\r\nEmetics should be preferred for evacuating the stomach, provided the\r\ncase be not urgent. Even then, however, they sometimes fail\r\naltogether. The best practice in that case is to endeavour to remove\r\nthe poison with the stomach-pump; and this in urgent cases should be\r\nthe first remedy employed. The treatment by the stomach-pump has now\r\nbecome so generally known, that it is unnecessary to describe it\r\nparticularly. It was recommended in this country by the late Dr. Monro\r\nin his lectures; but does not appear to have been tried by him. In\r\n1803 it was first published by Renault in his treatise on the\r\ncounter-poisons of arsenic; and he had tried it on animals.[1793] But\r\nthe first person who used it in an actual case of poisoning with opium\r\nwas Dr. Physick of Philadelphia. He saved the life of a child with it\r\nin 1812; and not long afterwards his countryman, Dr. Dorsey, cured two\r\nother individuals.[1794] More lately it was again proposed in London\r\nby Mr. Jukes, who does not appear to have been acquainted with these\r\nprior trials and experiments. Although he cannot be considered in the\r\nlight of a discoverer, the profession is much indebted to him for\r\nhaving recalled their attention to this treatment, and for having by\r\nhis success and activity fairly established its reputation. An account\r\nwill be seen of his apparatus and of several cases in the Medical and\r\nPhysical Journal for September and November, 1822. In using the\r\nstomach-pump care must be taken not to injure the stomach by too\r\nforcible suction.—When it is not at hand, Mr. Bryce of this city\r\nrecommended the substitution of a long tube with a bladder attached.\r\nAfter the stomach has been filled with warm water from the bladder,\r\nthe tube is to be turned down so as to act upon the contents of the\r\nstomach as a syphon. Dr. Alison cured a patient in this way.[1795]\r\n\r\nAnother method of removing opium from the stomach, which has been\r\npractised successfully where the patient could not be made to submit to\r\nthe common treatment, is the injection of tartar-emetic into the rectum.\r\nA case is related by Dr. Roe of New York where this treatment proved\r\nsuccessful. Fifteen grains in half a gallon of water excited free\r\nvomiting, and ten grains more renewed it. Care was taken to insure the\r\ndischarge of the whole tartar-emetic by a subsequent purgative\r\ninjection.[1796]\r\n\r\nThe last method for removing opium from the stomach is a desperate one,\r\nwhich can only be recommended when emetics by the mouth have utterly\r\nfailed, and when a stomach-pump or Mr. Bryce’s substitute, cannot be\r\nprocured. It is the injection of an emetic into the veins. Tartar-emetic\r\nanswers best for this purpose, and its effect is almost certain. A grain\r\nis the dose. While injecting it, care must be taken by the operator not\r\nto introduce air into the vein.\r\n\r\nThe next object in conducting the treatment of poisoning with opium is\r\nto keep the patient constantly roused. This alone is sufficient when the\r\ndose is not large, and the poison has been discharged by vomiting; and\r\nin every case it forms, next to the evacuation of the stomach, the most\r\nimportant of the treatment.\r\n\r\nThe best method of keeping the patient roused is to drag him up and down\r\nbetween two men, who must be cautioned against yielding to his\r\nimportunate entreaties and occasional struggles to get free and rest\r\nhimself. For the sopor returns so rapidly, that I have known a patient\r\nanswer two or three short questions quite correctly on being allowed to\r\nstand still, and suddenly drop the head in a state of insensibility\r\nwhile standing. The duration of the exercise should vary according to\r\ncircumstances from three, to six, or twelve hours. When he is allowed at\r\nlength to take out his sleep, the attendants must ascertain that it is\r\nsafe to do so by rousing him from time to time; and if this should\r\nbecome difficult, he must be turned out of bed again and exercised as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIt appears from some cases published not long ago by Mr. Wray[1797] and\r\nDr. Copland,[1798] and more lately also by Dr. Bright,[1799] that the\r\nmost insensible may be roused to a state of almost complete\r\nconsciousness for a short time, by dashing cold water over the head and\r\nbreast. This treatment can never supersede the use of emetics: and as\r\nits effect is but temporary, it ought not to supersede the plan of\r\nforced exercise. But it appears to be an excellent way to insure the\r\noperation of emetics. If the emetic is about to fail in its effect, cold\r\nwater dashed over the head restores the patient for a few moments to\r\nsensibility, during the continuance of which the emetic operates.\r\nDashing cold water over the head may perhaps be dangerous in the\r\nadvanced stage, when the body is cold and the breathing imperceptible;\r\nbut the most desperate remedies may be then tried, as the patient is\r\ngenerally in almost a hopeless state. In one of the cases mentioned by\r\nDr. Bright from the experience of Mr. Walne, complete recovery was\r\naccomplished, mainly by cold affusion of the head, where there appeared\r\nreason to believe that more than an ounce and a half of laudanum had\r\ndisappeared from the stomach before evacuating remedies were used.—This\r\ntreatment seems to have been first proposed in 1767 by a German\r\nphysician, Dr. Gräter.[1800] A suggestion, which is probably an\r\nimprovement, has been recently made by Dr. Boisragon of Cheltenham, to\r\nalternate the use of cold with that of warm water, applied to children\r\nin the shape of warm bath, and to adults in the form of warm-sponging\r\nand the foot-bath. The alternating impression of heat and cold may act\r\nbetter as a stimulant than either agent singly; and the occasional\r\nemployment of heat prevents the risk of collapse from too continuous\r\nexposure to cold. Dr. Boisragon saved in this way two cases in very\r\nunpromising circumstances.[1801]\r\n\r\nIn some cases internal stimulants have been given with advantage, such\r\nas assafœtida, ammonia, camphor, musk, &c. It is always useful to\r\nstimulate the nostrils from time to time, by tickling them or holding\r\nammonia under the nose; but the application should be neither frequent\r\nnor long continued, as the ammonia may cause deleterious effects when\r\ntoo freely inhaled. Pulling the hair and injecting water into the ears\r\nare also powerful modes of rousing the patient.\r\n\r\nVenesection has been recommended and successfully used by some\r\nphysicians. If the stomach be emptied, and the patient kept roused, as\r\nmay almost always be done when means are resorted to in time,\r\nvenesection will be unnecessary. Sometimes, however, when the pulse is\r\nfull and strong, it may be prudent to withdraw blood; and it certainly\r\nappears that in most cases where this remedy has been employed the\r\nsensibility began to return almost immediately after. This is very well\r\nshown in a case of poisoning with opium related by Mr. Ross[1802] in the\r\nEdinburgh Medical Journal, in another described in the same journal by\r\nMr. Richardson,[1803] and also in two cases of poisoning with acetate of\r\nmorphia mentioned in a former page. Sometimes, on the contrary, it has\r\nseemed injurious, probably because it was not had recourse to till the\r\npatient was moribund. It is a sound general rule that blood-letting\r\nought not to be resorted to until the poison is thoroughly removed from\r\nthe stomach; for it favours absorption. And yet facts are not wanting to\r\nshow that this rule, now generally admitted since the researches of\r\nMagendie on absorption, is not infallible. Dr. Young of the United\r\nStates has given the particulars of a case where imperturbable coma was\r\nformed, together with puffing stertorous respiration, in consequence of\r\nan ounce of laudanum having been swallowed,—and where recovery took\r\nplace, without the poison having been removed at all, simply under the\r\nemployment of three blood-lettings to the amount of twenty-eight ounces\r\naltogether, of cold to the head, and of sinapisms to the legs.[1804]\r\n\r\nGalvanism has been sometimes resorted to, but seldom with decided\r\nadvantage. I saw it tried, with dubious utility, a few years ago in an\r\nurgent case which was treated in the Edinburgh Infirmary. Six ounces of\r\nlaudanum had been swallowed, but most of it was removed in\r\nthree-quarters of an hour by the stomach-pump. A stage of deep sopor\r\nfollowed, after which sensibility was restored, and maintained for four\r\nhours by forced exercise. A state of pure and extreme coma then ensued,\r\nduring which galvanism was for some time of great service, in rousing\r\nthe patient. Gradually, however, it ceased to have any effect of the\r\nkind. Recovery took place eventually under the use of external and\r\ninternal stimuli. Mr. Erichsen of the University-College Hospital,\r\nLondon, has related a case, in which electro-magnetism was of undoubted\r\nservice. The usual symptoms had been occasioned by an ounce of laudanum.\r\nThe poison had been withdrawn by the stomach-pump, when unavailing\r\nattempts were made to restore sensibility by means of various\r\nstimulants. At length several electro-magnetic shocks were passed from\r\nthe forehead to the upper part of the spine, with the effect of speedily\r\neliciting signs of consciousness; in twenty minutes the patient could\r\nanswer questions and walk a little; and eventually complete recovery\r\ntook place.[1805]\r\n\r\nIn desperate circumstances artificial respiration may be used with\r\npropriety. After the breathing has been almost or entirely suspended the\r\nheart continues to beat for some time; and so long as its contractions\r\ncontinue, there is some hope that life may be preserved. But it is\r\nessential for the continuance of the heart’s action, that the breathing\r\nbe speedily restored to a state of much greater perfection than that\r\nwhich attends the close of poisoning with opium. It is not improbable\r\nthat the only ultimate cause of death from opium is suspension of the\r\nrespiration, and that if it could be maintained artificially so as to\r\nresemble exactly natural breathing, the poison in the blood would be at\r\nlength decomposed and consciousness gradually restored. The following is\r\nan interesting example by Mr. Whately, in which artificial respiration\r\nproved successful. A middle-aged man swallowed half an ounce of crude\r\nopium and soon became lethargic. He was roused from this state by\r\nappropriate remedies, and his surgeon left him. But the poison not\r\nhaving been sufficiently discharged, he fell again into a state of\r\nstupor; and when the surgeon returned, he found the face pale, cold and\r\ndeadly, the lips black, the eyelids motionless, so as to remain in any\r\nposition in which they were placed, the pulse very small and irregular,\r\nand the respiration quite extinct. The chest was immediately inflated by\r\nartificial means, and when this had been persevered in for seven\r\nminutes, expiration became accompanied with a croak, which gradually\r\nincreased in strength till natural breathing was established. Emetics\r\nwere then given, and the patient eventually recovered.[1806]—Dr. Ware of\r\nBoston (U. S.) has more lately described another case, where artificial\r\nrespiration was employed with marked advantage, and would probably have\r\nsaved the patient’s life in very unfavourable circumstances, but for the\r\ndisease on account of which the opium was given.[1807]—Another has been\r\nlately described by Mr. C. J. Smith of Madras. The patient was not seen\r\nfor four hours, and received no benefit from the ordinary remedies\r\nduring the next hour and a half. Artificial respiration was then\r\nresorted to and maintained for nearly five hours with an hour of\r\ninterval; and this measure certainly seems to have brought the case to a\r\nfavourable termination under most unpromising circumstances.[1808]—Dr.\r\nWatson of Glasgow has mentioned to me the particulars of an instructive\r\nbase in the person of an infant three weeks old, in whom, after the\r\nbreathing had stopped and the heart had nearly ceased to beat, the\r\noccasional inflation of the chest with the breath at intervals of two or\r\nthree minutes restored for a time the action both of the heart and\r\nlungs, and eventually accomplished recovery. On physiological principles\r\nit appears probable, that this simple mode of procedure may prove more\r\nfrequently successful than might at first be thought.\r\n\r\nIt would be a fruitless task to examine into the merits of the numerous\r\nantidotes which have from time to time been proposed for poisoning with\r\nopium. Professor Orfila has examined many of them with great care, such\r\nas vinegar, tartaric acid, lemonade, infusion of coffee, decoction of\r\ngalls, solution of chlorine, camphor, diluents; and he has found them\r\nall useless before the poison is expelled from the stomach, with the\r\nsingle exception of decoction of galls. As he remarked that this fluid\r\nthrows down the active principles of an infusion of opium, and\r\nsubsequently found that such a mixture acts more feebly on the animal\r\nsystem than the opiate infusion itself, he thinks the decoction of galls\r\nmay with propriety be used as an imperfect antidote, till the poison can\r\nbe evacuated from the stomach.[1809] His experiments, however, do not\r\nassign to it very material activity as a remedy; and certainly the whole\r\nefforts of the physician ought in the first instance to be directed to\r\nthe removal of the opium, and to keeping the patient roused. When the\r\nopium has been completely removed, the vegetable acids and infusion of\r\ncoffee have been found useful in reviving the patient, and subsequently\r\nin subduing sickness, vomiting, and headache; but till the poison is\r\ncompletely removed the administration of acids is worse than useless,\r\nprovided the opium was given in the solid state, because its solution in\r\nthe juices of the stomach is accelerated. It has been maintained that\r\niodine, chlorine, and bromine are all antidotes for poisoning with the\r\nvegetable alkaloids.[1810] Some notice will be taken of this statement\r\nin the chapter on Nux Vomica. It has also been lately alleged in the\r\nUnited States that opium has no effect when given with acetate of lead;\r\nand an hospital case is reported as having occurred at New York, where\r\nthe poison was swallowed in this way to the extent of thirty grains,\r\nwithout any injurious effect.[1811] There must have been some mistake\r\nhere, however. When given with acetate of lead in medicinal doses, opium\r\nexerts its usual sedative and anodyne action; and indeed there is no\r\nchemical or physiological reason why it should not do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n          OF POISONING WITH HYOSCYAMUS, LACTUCA, AND SOLANUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Hyoscyamus._—Of the narcotic poisons none bears so\r\nclose a resemblance to opium in its properties as the _hyoscyamus_ or\r\nhenbane. Several species are poisonous; but the only one that has been\r\nexamined with care is the _H. niger_, from which the extract of the\r\napothecary is prepared.\r\n\r\nThe hyoscyamus has been analyzed by various chemists, and found to\r\ncontain a peculiar alkaloid, in which the properties of the plant are\r\nconcentrated. It is named hyoscyamia. This substance in its pure state,\r\nas first obtained by MM. Geiger and Hesse, is a solid body, in fine\r\nsilky crystals, without odour, of a strong acrid taste like tobacco,\r\npartially volatilizable with boiling water, entirely volatilizable alone\r\nat a somewhat higher heat, very soluble in alcohol and ether, but\r\nsparingly so in water.[1812]\r\n\r\nFarther, hyoscyamus, like many other narcotic vegetables, stramonium,\r\ndigitalis, opium, tobacco, and hemlock, has been found by Mr. Morries\r\nStirling to yield by destructive distillation an empyreumatic oil of\r\ngreat activity. Its poisonous properties, however, are not essential to\r\nthe oil, but reside in a volatile principle which may be detached by\r\nweak acetic acid. The relation of this principle to hyoscyamia has not\r\nbeen ascertained; but it is an active poison, small doses producing in\r\nrabbits, convulsions, coma, and speedy death.[1813]\r\n\r\nRunge proposes as evidence of poisoning with hyoscyamus, in common,\r\nhowever, with stramonium and belladonna, to concentrate a solution of\r\nthe contents of the stomach, and apply it to a cat’s eye to dilate the\r\npupil. Dilatation, he says, was even produced by an extract obtained\r\nfrom the urine of a rabbit which had been fed some time on\r\nhyoscyamus.[1814]\r\n\r\nAccording to the experiments of Professor Orfila, the juice or extract\r\nprocured from the leaves, stems, and especially the root, produces in\r\nanimals a state of sopor much purer than that caused by opium. It is\r\nmost active when injected into the jugular vein, less so when applied to\r\nthe cellular tissue, and still less when introduced into the stomach.\r\nExcept occasional paralysis of the heart, indicated by florid blood in\r\nits left cavities, no morbid appearance is to be found in the dead body.\r\nSix drachms of the pharmaceutic extract of the leaves killed a dog in\r\ntwo hours and a quarter when swallowed; and three drachms killed another\r\nin four hours through a wound in the back. Its action appears to be\r\nexerted through the medium of the blood-vessels, and is purely\r\nnarcotic.[1815]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the activity of this plant is much affected by\r\nseason; and the energy of its preparations varies greatly with the\r\nmanner of obtaining them. The information, however, which is at present\r\npossessed on these two points is vague, because the influence of the two\r\ncircumstances has seldom been viewed carefully apart.\r\n\r\nThe leaves, from which the pharmaceutic preparations of hyoscyamus are\r\nobtained, are commonly held to be most active during the inflorescence\r\nof the plant in the second summer of its existence. On general\r\nprinciples this appears probable; but there are no satisfactory\r\nexperiments on the subject, even the late researches of Mr. Houlton\r\nhaving left much still to be determined.[1816]\r\n\r\nOrfila has made some important remarks as to the effect of season and\r\nvegetation on the energy of the root as a poison. The root he maintains\r\nis the most active part of the plant; but in the spring it is nearly\r\ninert. Thus the juice of three pounds of the root collected near the end\r\nof April, when the plant has hardly begun to shoot, killed a dog in\r\nsomewhat less than two days; while a decoction of an ounce and a half\r\ncollected on the last day of June, when the plant was in full\r\nvegetation, proved fatal in two hours and a half.\r\n\r\nThe extract of the leaves, procured from different shops, was found by\r\nOrfila to vary greatly in point of strength, some samples being\r\nabsolutely inert.[1817] The causes of these differences have been\r\nascertained experimentally by Brandes to be, that the herb loses its\r\nactive principle in part by decomposition in the process of simple\r\ndesiccation, and also when long kept; and that the greater part is also\r\nsimilarly decomposed in preparing an extract, unless the process be\r\nfinished quickly, and at a low heat.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of hyoscyamus are poisonous, as well as the leaves and root.\r\nIndeed the whole plant is so. The seeds contain much more hyoscyamia\r\nthan the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe effects of hyoscyamus on man differ somewhat from those on animals,\r\nand vary greatly with the dose.\r\n\r\nIn medicinal doses it commonly induces pleasant sleep. This indeed has\r\nbeen denied by M. Fouquier, who infers from his experiments that it\r\nnever causes sleep, but always headache, delirium, nausea, vomiting, and\r\nfeverishness.[1818] I have certainly seen it sometimes have these\r\neffects; but much more generally it has acted as a pleasant hypnotic and\r\nanodyne.\r\n\r\nIts effect in large doses have been well described by M. Choquet as they\r\noccurred in two soldiers who ate by mistake the young shoots dressed\r\nwith olive oil. They presently became giddy and stupid, lost their\r\nspeech, and had a dull, haggard look. The pupils were excessively\r\ndilated, and the eyes so insensible that the eyelids did not wink when\r\nthe cornea was touched. The pulse was small and intermitting, the\r\nbreathing difficult, the jaw locked, and the mouth distorted by _risus\r\nsardonicus_. Sensibility was extinct, the limbs were cold and palsied,\r\nthe arms convulsed, and there was that singular union of delirium and\r\ncoma which is usually termed typhomania. One of the men soon vomited\r\nfreely under the influence of emetics, and in a short time got quite\r\nwell. The other vomited little. As the palsy and somnolency abated, the\r\ndelirium became extravagant, and the patient quite unmanageable till the\r\nevening of the subsequent day, when the operation of brisk purgatives\r\nrestored him to his senses. In two days both were fit for duty.[1819]\r\n\r\nIn a treatise on vegetable poisons, Mr. Wilmer has related the history\r\nof six persons in a family, who were poisoned by eating at dinner the\r\nroots of the hyoscyamus by mistake instead of parsneps. Several were\r\ndelirious and danced about the room like maniacs, one appeared as if he\r\nhad got drunk, and a woman became profoundly and irrecoverably comatose.\r\nEmetics could not be introduced into the stomach, stimulant clysters had\r\nno effect, external stimuli of every kind failed to rouse her, and she\r\nexpired next morning at six.[1820] The roots in this instance were\r\ngathered in the winter time,—a fact, which does not quite coincide with\r\nthe conclusions of Orfila, that the plant must be in full vegetation\r\nbefore the energy of the root is considerable.\r\n\r\nFrom these and other cases, the abstracts of which are to be seen in\r\nOrfila’s Toxicology, or in Wibmer’s Treatise on the Operation of\r\nMedicines and Poisons, it follows that hyoscyamus in a poisonous dose\r\ncauses loss of speech, dilatation of the pupil, coma, and delirium,\r\ncommonly of the unmanageable, sometimes of the furious kind. In general\r\na stage of delirium precedes coma; and sometimes as the coma passes off,\r\ndelirium returns for a time. It has been known to act powerfully in the\r\nform of clyster.[1821] It has also been known to act with considerable\r\nenergy even through the sound skin, as appears from a case which\r\noccurred to Wibmer. He was called to a lady affected with great stupor,\r\ndilated pupils, flushed face, loss of speech, full hard pulse, and\r\nswelling of the abdomen; and he found that these symptoms were owing to\r\nseveral ounces of henbane leaves having been applied to the belly in a\r\npoultice, on account of strangury and tympanitis. She was still capable\r\nof being roused by speaking loudly close to her ear; and under proper\r\ntreatment she recovered.[1822]\r\n\r\nHenbane seldom causes any distinct symptoms of irritant poisoning. In\r\nseveral, however, of the cases related by the older modern authors some\r\npain in the belly, a little vomiting, and more rarely diarrhœa, appear\r\nto have occurred.[1823] Plenck quotes, from a Swedish authority, an\r\ninstance of its having produced burning in the stomach, intense thirst,\r\nwatching, delirium, depraved vision, and next day a crowded eruption of\r\ndark spots and vesicles, which disappeared on the supervention of a\r\nprofuse diarrhœa.[1824] The same author alludes to cases where it proved\r\nfatal; but this event is rare in the present day, obviously because the\r\nprecursory stage of delirium gives an opportunity of removing the\r\npoison, before the stage of coma is formed. A fatal case, which occurred\r\nto Mr. Wibmer, has been mentioned above; and another has been related in\r\nPyl’s Magazin. Two boys a few minutes after eating the seeds were\r\nattacked with convulsions and heat in the throat; and one of them, who\r\ncould not be made to vomit, died in the course of the ensuing\r\nnight.[1825]\r\n\r\nThe accidents it has occasioned have commonly arisen from the\r\nindividuals confounding the root with that of the wild chicory or with\r\nthe parsnep, the latter of which it somewhat resembles.\r\n\r\nOf the other species of the hyoscyamus, the _H. albus_ has been known to\r\ncause symptoms precisely the same with those above described. Professor\r\nFoderé has given a good example of its effects on man, as they occurred\r\nin the crew of a French corvette in the Archipelago. The plant was\r\nboiled and distributed among the whole ship’s company, as several of the\r\nsailors said they knew it to be eatable and salubrious. But in no long\r\ntime they were all seized with giddiness, vomiting, convulsions, colic,\r\npurging, and delirium of the active kind. They were all soon relieved by\r\nemetics and purgatives.[1826]\r\n\r\nDr. Archibald Hamilton has described a case of the same nature, which\r\nwas caused by the seeds of this plant. A young medical student, who took\r\nabout twenty-five grains of the seeds, was seized in half an hour with\r\nlassitude and somnolency, and successively with dryness of the throat,\r\nimpeding deglutition, convulsive movements of the arms, incoherency,\r\ntotal insensibility of the skin, and loss of recollection. These\r\nsymptoms continued about twelve hours, and then slowly receded.[1827]\r\n\r\nThree other species, the _H. aureus_, _physaloides_ and _scopolia_ are\r\nrepresented by Orfila to be equally deleterious.\r\n\r\nThe alkaloid hyoscyamus possesses in an intense degree the active\r\nproperties of the plant. It has not been hitherto examined in this\r\nrespect with much care. But extremely minute quantities produce\r\nexcessive enlargement of the pupil, when put within the eyelids in the\r\nform of neutral salt.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The treatment of poisoning with hyoscyamus consists in\r\nremoving the poison, diminishing cerebral congestion, and restoring\r\nsensibility. It is therefore substantially the same as in poisoning with\r\nopium, except that general or local evacuation of blood is more\r\nfrequently required, in consequence of the greater tendency of\r\nhyoscyamus to induce determination of blood towards the head and\r\ncongestion there. It has been lately alleged by an Italian author that a\r\nlarge dose of lemon-juice is an immediate antidote for the effects of\r\ntoo large a medicinal dose, even when the poison was administered in the\r\nform of injection.[1828] This does not seem probable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Of Poisoning with Lactuca._\r\n\r\nAllied in its effects, but greatly inferior in power to opium and\r\nhyoscyamus, is the _Lactuca virosa_, together with the _Lettuce-opium_,\r\nor inspissated juice of _L. sativa_, and _L. virosa_.\r\n\r\nOrfila found that three drachms of the extract of _L. virosa_ introduced\r\ninto the stomach of a dog killed it in two days, without causing any\r\nremarkable symptom; that two drachms applied to a wound in the back\r\ninduced giddiness, slight sopor, and death in three days; and that\r\nthirty-six grains injected in a state of solution into the jugular vein\r\ncaused dulness, weakness, slight convulsions, and death in eighteen\r\nminutes.[1829] This poison, therefore, like other narcotics, acts\r\nthrough absorption. But it is far from being energetic. The extract is\r\nvery uncertain in strength,—as may indeed be inferred from the variable\r\nnature of the processes by which it is prepared.\r\n\r\nLactucarium, the inspissated juice, especially that obtained from _L.\r\nvirosa_, is obviously a more active preparation than the extract. Doses\r\nof no great magnitude kill small animals. But there is a want of good\r\nobservations on its effects and energy as a poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Of Poisoning with Solanum._\r\n\r\nDifferent species of _solanum_, a genus of the same natural order with\r\nthe hyoscyamus, have been considered by Orfila to possess the same\r\nproperties, though in a much feebler degree. The _S. dulcamara_ or\r\nbittersweet has been erroneously believed by some to possess distinct\r\nnarcotic properties.[1830] M. Dunal found that a dog might take 180 of\r\nthe berries or four ounces of the extract without any inconvenience, and\r\nquotes an experiment on the human subject where thirty-two drachms of\r\nextract were taken in two doses also without injury.[1831] If it has any\r\npower at all, therefore, it must possess too little to be entitled to\r\nthe name of a poison. Chevallier says he knew an instance of a\r\ndruggist’s apprentice being attacked with deep somnolency for ten hours\r\nafter carrying a large bundle of it on his head;[1832] but some other\r\ncause may be justly suspected to have here been in operation. The _S.\r\nnigrum_ or common nightshade has been made the subject of experiment by\r\nOrfila, who found its extract to possess nearly the power and energy of\r\nlettuce-opium.[1833] The following seems a genuine case of poisoning\r\nwith the berries of this species. Three children near Nantes in France\r\nwere seized with severe headache, giddiness, colic, nausea, and\r\nvomiting. One of them then had excessive dilatation of the pupils,\r\nsweating and urgent thirst; loss of voice, stertorous breathing, and\r\ntetanic spasms ensued; and in twelve hours he died. Another had swelling\r\nof the face, alternate contraction and dilatation of the pupils,\r\nrepeated vomiting, and eventually coma; but he recovered. The third was\r\nsimilarly, but more slightly affected, and also recovered. The children\r\nwho recovered pointed out the berries they had eaten; which were found\r\nto be those of _S. nigrum_.[1834] The _S. fuscatum_ is rather more\r\nactive, fifteen berries having caused hurried breathing and\r\nvomiting.[1835] The _S. mammosum_ is also probably an active species,\r\nthe capsule of the berries having been known to excite vomiting,\r\ngiddiness, and confusion of mind.[1836] In the _S. nigrum_ and\r\n_dulcamara_, M. Desfosses discovered in 1821 a peculiar alkaloid, which\r\ninduces somnolency in animals, but is not a very active poison.[1837]\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed by some that the tubers of _Solanum tuberosum_, the\r\ncommon potato, may acquire in certain circumstances poisonous qualities\r\nof no mean energy. Dr. Kabler of Prague has described the cases of four\r\nindividuals in a family who were seized with alarming narcotic symptoms\r\nafter eating potatoes which had begun to germinate and shrivel. The\r\nfather of the family, who had eaten least of them all, appeared as if\r\ntipsy, and soon became insensible. The mother and two children became\r\ncomatose and convulsed. All had vomited before becoming insensible. They\r\nrecovered under the use of ether, frictions, and coffee; and in two\r\nhours were out of danger.[1838]\r\n\r\nAn alkaloid has been indicated by several chemists in various species of\r\nsolanum. The most recent account, that of Otto, represents it to be a\r\npearly, white, pulverulent substance, alkaline in reaction, and capable\r\nof uniting with acids. One grain of sulphate of solania killed a rabbit\r\nin six hours, and three grains a stronger rabbit in nine hours,—the\r\nsymptoms being those of narcotic poisoning.[1839]\r\n\r\nViolent effects have often been assigned to the genus Solanum, in\r\nconsequence of its similarity to a powerful poison, the _Atropa\r\nbelladonna_; which indeed is described by the older authors under the\r\nname of _Solanum furiosum_. It will be noticed among the Narcotico-acrid\r\nPoisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n                  OF POISONING WITH HYDROCYANIC ACID.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poisons, whose energy depends on the presence of the prussic or\r\nhydrocyanic acid, are of great interest to the physiologist as well as\r\nthe medical jurist. Some of them are natural productions, derived from\r\nthe leaves, bark, fruit-kernels, and roots of certain plants; others are\r\nformed artificially by complex chemical processes. The species to be\r\nhere noticed are the _hydrocyanic acid_ itself, and the essential oils\r\nand distilled waters of the _bitter almond_, _cherry-laurel_,\r\n_peach-blossom_, _cluster-cherry_, _mountain-ash_, and _bitter cassava_.\r\nThese poisons have for some time attracted great attention on account of\r\ntheir extraordinary power. And indeed in rapidity of action, or the\r\nminuteness of the quantity in which they operate, no poison surpasses\r\nand very few equal them. They are exceedingly interesting to the medical\r\njurist, because, as they are now generally known, their effects often\r\nbecome the subject of medico-legal investigation: they have been\r\nrepeatedly taken by accident; they have often been resorted to for\r\ncommitting suicide; and they have likewise been employed as the\r\ninstruments of murder. A remarkable instance occurred in England towards\r\nthe close of last century, where murder was committed with the\r\ncherry-laurel water; and two cases have been tried in England where\r\ndeath arose from hydrocyanic acid, and the prisoners were charged with\r\nadministering it, but were found not guilty. These cases will be noticed\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Of the Hydrocyanic Acid._\r\n            SECTION I.—_Of its Chemical History and Tests._\r\n\r\nThis singular substance was discovered some time ago by Scheele; but\r\nGay-Lussac was the first who obtained it in a state of purity. It is\r\nfamiliarly known to chemists under two forms,—as a pure acid, and\r\ndiluted with water.\r\n\r\nThe pure acid is liquid, limpid, and colourless. It has an acrid,\r\npungent taste, and a very peculiar odour, which, when diffused through\r\nthe air, has a very distant resemblance to that of bitter almonds, but\r\nis accompanied with a peculiar impression of acridity on the nostrils\r\nand back of the throat. It is an error, however, to suppose, as is very\r\ngenerally done, that the odour is the same with that of the almond. It\r\nboils at 80°; freezes at 5°; and is very inflammable. I have kept it\r\nunchanged for a fortnight in ice-cold water; but at ordinary\r\ntemperatures it decomposes spontaneously, and becomes brown, sometimes\r\nin an hour, and commonly within twelve hours. On this account it is\r\nextremely improbable that a case will ever happen, in which the medical\r\njurist will have to examine it in its concentrated form.\r\n\r\nWhen united with water it forms the acid discovered by Scheele, and now\r\nkept in the druggist’s shop. In this state it has the same appearance,\r\ntaste, and smell as the pure acid; but it is less volatile, does not\r\nburn, and may be preserved long without change, if excluded from the\r\nlight. In consequence of its volatility, however, it becomes weak,\r\nunless kept with great care; many samples of it also undergo\r\ndecomposition, and deposit brown flakes, if not excluded from the light;\r\nand hence the acid of the shops is very variable in point of strength.\r\nThe acid prepared by decomposing the solution of the ferro-cyanate of\r\npotass by sulphuric acid may be kept for years, even exposed to diffuse\r\nlight, without being decomposed at all. A French physician made some\r\nexperiments not long ago on the uncertainty of the strength of the\r\nmedicinal acid; and he found that he could swallow a whole ounce of one\r\nsample, and a drachm of a stronger sample, without sustaining any\r\ninjury; but on trying some which had been recently prepared by\r\nVauquelin, he was immediately taken ill, as will be related presently,\r\nand narrowly escaped with his life.[1840]—The acid of commerce differs\r\nmuch in strength, according to the process by which it has been\r\nprepared, and independently of decomposition by keeping. The medicinal\r\nacid long used in this country is intended to be an imitation of that of\r\nVauquelin, which contains 3·3 per cent.;[1841] but the London College of\r\nPhysicians, in adopting it in their last Pharmacopœia, improperly\r\naltered the strength to 2 per cent. That of Giese, which keeps well, is\r\nof the same strength as the first; that of Schrader contains only one\r\nper cent.; that of Göbel 2·5 per cent.; that of Ittner 10 per\r\ncent.;[1842] that of Robiquet 50 per cent.[1843] Of the alcoholic\r\nsolutions the best known are that of Schrader, which contains about 1·5\r\nper cent. of pure acid,—that of the Bavarian Pharmacopœia, which\r\ncontains 4 per cent.,—that of Duflos, 9 per cent.,—that of Pfaff, 10 per\r\ncent.,—and that of Keller, 25 per cent.[1842] These statements are\r\nnecessary for understanding the cases of poisoning published in foreign\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nThe tests for hydrocyanic acid has been examined by M. Lassaigne of\r\nParis, by Dr. Turner of London, and by Professor Orfila. They are its\r\nodour, the salts of copper, the salts of iron, and nitrate of silver.\r\n\r\nThe _peculiar odour_ of the acid is a very characteristic and delicate\r\ntest of its presence. According to Orfila, the smell is perceptible when\r\nno chemical reagent is delicate enough to detect it.[1844] But I doubt\r\nthe accuracy of this statement, and may farther observe, that I have\r\nknown some persons nearly insensible of any smell, even in a specimen\r\nwhich was tolerably strong. Hence, when the odour is resorted to as a\r\ntest, it ought to be tried by several persons.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of copper_ forms with hydrocyanic acid, when rendered alkaline\r\nwith a little potass, a greenish precipitate, which becomes nearly\r\nwhite, on the addition of a little hydrochloric acid. The purpose of the\r\nhydrochloric acid is to redissolve some oxide of copper thrown down by\r\nthe potass. The precipitate is then the cyanide of copper. This test,\r\naccording to Lassaigne, will act on the poison when dissolved in 20,000\r\nparts of water. But as the precipitate is not coloured, the test is an\r\ninsignificant one compared with the next.\r\n\r\nIf the acid be rendered alkaline by potass, the _salts of the mixed\r\nperoxide and protoxide of iron_ produce a grayish-green precipitate,\r\nwhich, on the addition of a little sulphuric acid, becomes of a deep\r\nprussian blue colour. Common green vitriol answers very well for this\r\npurpose. The salts of the peroxide of iron will also often answer,\r\nbecause, unless carefully prepared, they are never altogether free of\r\nprotoxide. But the salts of the pure peroxide of iron have no such\r\neffect. They cause with the potass a brownish precipitate, which is\r\nredissolved on the addition of sulphuric acid, leaving the solution\r\nlimpid. Mr. Ilott of Bromley has pointed out to me, that the iron test\r\ndoes not act on a weak solution of hydrocyanic acid, if there be an\r\nexcess of ammonia present, either such from the first, or disengaged by\r\npotash from muriate of ammonia; that the blue precipitate is produced by\r\ndriving off the ammonia with heat; but not by neutralizing it with an\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nThe _nitrate of silver_ is a delicate and characteristic reagent for\r\nhydrocyanic acid. A white precipitate, the cyanide of silver, is\r\nproduced in a very diluted solution; and this precipitate is\r\ndistinguished from the other white salts of silver, by being insoluble\r\nin nitric acid at ordinary temperatures, but soluble in that acid at its\r\nboiling temperature. In this action it is necessary to observe that\r\nsomething more is accomplished than simple solution; the cyanide is\r\ndecomposed, nitrate of silver is formed, and hydrocyanic acid is\r\ndisengaged by the ebullition. A more characteristic property is, that\r\nthe precipitate when dried and heated emits cyanogen gas; which is\r\neasily known by the beautiful rose-red colour of its flame.[1845]\r\n\r\nSometimes it is necessary to determine the strength of diluted\r\nhydrocyanic acid; because, on account of its tendency to decomposition,\r\ndoubts may be entertained whether a mixture which contains it is strong\r\nenough to be dangerously poisonous. According to Orfila, the best method\r\nof ascertaining the strength either of a pure solution or of a mixture\r\nin syrup, is to throw down the acid with the nitrate of silver and dry\r\nthe precipitate; a hundred parts of which correspond to 20·33 of pure\r\nhydrocyanic acid.\r\n\r\n_Process for Mixed Fluids._—Some important observations have been made\r\nby MM. Leuret and Lassaigne on the effect of mixing animal matters with\r\nhydrocyanic acid. The most material of their results are, that if the\r\nbody of an animal poisoned with the acid is left unburied for three\r\ndays, the poison can no longer be detected; and that if it is buried\r\nwithin twenty-four hours the poison may be found after a longer\r\ninterval, but never after eight days. The reason is either that the acid\r\nvolatilizes, or that it is decomposed. The possibility thus indicated of\r\ndetecting the poison in the body some days after death has been since\r\nconfirmed by actual examination in a medico-legal case. In a case of\r\npoisoning with hydrocyanic acid, followed by dismemberment of the body\r\nfor the purpose of concealment, distinct proof of the presence of the\r\npoison seven days after death was obtained by the second of the\r\nsucceeding processes, although the trunk of the body had never been\r\nburied, but had been for some time lying in a drain.[1846]\r\n\r\nFor detecting the poison in mixed fluids Orfila has lately advised the\r\nfollowing process. The fluid may be treated with animal charcoal without\r\nheat. The colour being thus generally destroyed, the test will sometimes\r\nact as usual. Or, without this preparation, a slip of bibulous paper\r\nmoistened with pure potass, may be immersed in the suspected fluid for a\r\nfew minutes, and then touched with a solution of sulphate of iron: upon\r\nwhich the usual blue colour will be produced on the paper. If neither of\r\nthese methods should answer, the fluid is to be distilled.[1847]\r\n\r\nDistillation of the fluid is on the whole the best mode of procedure. It\r\nwas proposed some time before by Lassaigne and Leuret for detecting the\r\npoison in the stomach after death. The steps of their process, which\r\nappears to me the best yet proposed, are as follows. The contents after\r\nfiltration are to be neutralized with sulphuric acid if they are\r\nalkaline, in order to fix the ammonia which may have been disengaged by\r\nputrefaction; the product is then to be distilled from a vapour-bath\r\ntill an eighth part has passed over into the receiver; and the distilled\r\nfluid is to be tested with the sulphate of iron in the usual way.[1848]\r\nOrfila maintains that from hydrocyanized syrup only two-thirds of the\r\nacid can be distilled over; and cautions the analyst against estimating\r\nquantity by such means.[1849] M. Ossian Henry has proposed to condense\r\nthe acid in distillation by a much more complex process, which consists\r\nin obtaining it in the first instance in the form of cyanide of\r\nsilver.[1850] But with a good refrigeratory there is no difficulty in\r\ncondensing every particle of acid with no other aid than cold water.\r\n\r\nBy this process Lassaigne could detect the poison in a cat or dog killed\r\nby twelve drops and examined twenty-four or forty-eight hours after\r\ndeath.[1851] But Dr. Schubarth has objected to it,—and the same\r\nobjection will apply to every process in which heat is used,—that\r\nhydrocyanic acid may be formed during distillation by the decomposition\r\nof animal matter.[1852] His objection, however, appears only to rest on\r\nconjecture or presumption at farthest; and I doubt whether, supposing\r\nthe distillation to go on slowly in the vapour-bath, the heat is\r\nsufficient to bring about the requisite decomposition. The force of the\r\nobjection must be decided by future researches.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that hydrocyanic acid is apt to be formed in the\r\ncourse of the changes produced by various agents in organic matters.\r\nThese are probably more numerous than the toxicologist is at present\r\nexactly aware of. An instance of its formation in the course of the\r\ndecay of unsound cheese has been ascertained lately by Dr.\r\nWitling;[1853] and another example will be mentioned under the head of\r\nspurred rye.\r\n\r\n_Cyanide of Potassium._—The only compound of hydrocyanic acid which\r\nrequires notice is the cyanide of potassium. This is, when pure, a white\r\nsalt, bitter, not decomposable by a red heat unless in contact with air,\r\nvery soluble in water, and sparingly so in rectified spirit. Its watery\r\nsolution restores the blue of reddened litmus, and does not precipitate\r\nlime-water: the mixed sulphates of the two oxides of iron form with it\r\nPrussian blue: nitrate of silver causes a white precipitate insoluble in\r\ncold nitric acid, but disappearing when the acid is boiled: sulphate of\r\ncopper causes an apple-green precipitate, which becomes white on the\r\naddition of hydrochloric acid: chloride of platinum or perchloric acid\r\nwill indicate the potash. In a complex organic mixture it is difficult\r\nto detect the potash; but hydrocyanic acid may be obtained from it by\r\ndistilling the suspected fluid with tartaric acid.[1854]\r\n\r\n\r\n   SECTION II.—_Of the Action of Hydrocyanic Acid and the Symptoms it\r\n                            excites in Man._\r\n\r\nThe effects of hydrocyanic acid on the animal system have been examined\r\nby several physiologists. The best experiments with the concentrated\r\nacid are those of M. Magendie; who says that, if a single drop be put\r\ninto the throat of a dog, the animal makes two or three deep hurried\r\nrespirations, and instantly drops down dead; that it causes death almost\r\nas instantaneously when dropped under the eyelid; and that when it is\r\ninjected into the jugular vein, the animal drops down dead at the very\r\ninstant, as if struck with a cannon ball or with lightning.[1855]\r\n\r\nOn repeating these experiments in order to determine less figuratively\r\nthe shortest period which elapses before the poison begins to operate,\r\nas well as the shortest time in which it proves fatal,—two points it\r\nwill presently be found important to know,—I remarked that a single\r\ndrop, weighing scarcely a third of a grain, dropped into the mouth of a\r\nrabbit, killed it in eighty-three seconds, and began to act in\r\nsixty-three seconds,—that three drops weighing four-fifths of a grain,\r\nin like manner killed a strong cat in thirty seconds, and began to act\r\nin ten,—that another was affected by the same dose in five and died in\r\nforty seconds,—that four drops weighing a grain and a fifth did not\r\naffect a rabbit for twenty seconds, but killed it in ten seconds\r\nmore,—and that twenty-five grains, corresponding with an ounce and a\r\nhalf of medicinal acid, began to act on a rabbit as soon as it was\r\npoured into its mouth, and killed it outright in ten seconds at\r\nfarthest. Three drops injected into the eye acted on a cat in twenty\r\nseconds, and killed it in twenty more; and the same quantity dropped on\r\na fresh wound in the loins acted in forty-five and proved fatal in 105\r\nseconds. Dr. A. T. Thomson says he has seen the concentrated acid kill a\r\nstrong dog in two seconds.[1856] Mr. Blake on the other hand alleges\r\nthat all the accounts which represent the action of the poison to begin\r\nin less than ten seconds are exaggerated, because he could never find it\r\nto act more quickly, even when thirty minims of concentrated acid were\r\ninjected at once into the femoral vein.[1857] But it is impossible that\r\nany negative results can outweigh positive observations, especially when\r\nmade, as mine were, expressly with the view of ascertaining the shortest\r\ninterval. In the slower cases enumerated above there were regular fits\r\nof violent tetanus; but in the very rapid cases the animals perished\r\njust as the fit was ushered in with retraction of the head. In rabbits\r\nopisthotonos, in cats emprosthotonos, was the chief tetanic symptom.—The\r\npractical application of these experiments will appear presently.\r\n\r\nOf all the forms in which the pure acid can be administered, that of\r\nvapour appears the most instantaneous in operation. M. Robert found,\r\nthat when a bird, a rabbit, a cat, and two dogs were made to breathe air\r\nsaturated with its vapour, the first died in one second, the second also\r\nin a single second, the cat in two, one dog in five, and the other dog\r\nin ten seconds.[1858]\r\n\r\nThe effects of the diluted acid are the same when the dose is large, but\r\nsomewhat different when inferior doses are given. These effects have\r\nbeen observed by many physiologists; but the most accurate and extensive\r\nexperiments are those of Emmert published in 1805,[1859] those of\r\nCoullon in 1819,[1860] and those of Krimer in 1827.[1861] They found\r\nthat when an animal is poisoned with a dose not quite sufficient to\r\ncause death, it is seized in one or two minutes with giddiness, weakness\r\nand salivation, then with tetanic convulsions, and at last with\r\ngradually increasing insensibility; that after lying in this state for\r\nsome time, the insensibility goes off rapidly and is succeeded by a few\r\nattacks of convulsions and transient giddiness; and that the whole\r\nduration of such cases of poisoning sometimes does not exceed half an\r\nhour, but may extend to a whole day or more.—When the dose is somewhat\r\nlarger the animal perishes either in tetanic convulsions or comatose;\r\nand death for the most part takes place between the second and fifteenth\r\nminute. I have seen the diluted acid, however, prove fatal with a\r\nrapidity scarcely surpassed by the pure poison. Thus in an experiment\r\nwith Vauquelin’s acid, made on a strong cat at the same time with the\r\nsecond and third of the experiments with the pure acid detailed above, I\r\nfound that thirty-two grains, which contain one of real acid, began to\r\nact in fifteen seconds, and proved fatal in twenty-five more. According\r\nto Schubarth’s experiments death may be sometimes delayed for thirty-two\r\nminutes;[1862] but if the animal survives that interval, it recovers. He\r\nfarther states, that during the course of the symptoms the breath\r\nexhales an odour of hydrocyanic acid.[1863] Coullon once saw a dog die\r\nafter nineteen hours of suffering; but cases of this duration are\r\nexceedingly rare.[1864] When the dose is very large Mr. Macaulay, as\r\nwill afterwards be mentioned (p. 590), has found death take place in a\r\nfew seconds, exactly as when the pure acid is given.\r\n\r\nThe body presents few morbid appearances of note. The brain is generally\r\nnatural. Yet occasionally its vessels are turgid; and Schubarth once\r\nfound even an extravasation of blood between its external membranes in\r\nthe horse.[1865] The heart and great vessels are distended with black\r\nblood, which is commonly fluid, but occasionally coagulated as usual.\r\nThe lungs, according to Schubarth, are sometimes pale, but much more\r\ngenerally injected and gorged with blood.[1866] The pure acid, according\r\nto Magendie, exhausts the irritability of the heart and voluntary\r\nmuscles so completely, that they are insensible even to the stimulus of\r\ngalvanism.[1867] The diluted acid has not always this effect. In the\r\nexperiments of Coullon the heart and intestines contracted, and the\r\nvoluntary muscles continued contractile, after death as usual.[1868] So\r\ntoo Mr. Blake remarked both by inspection of the body after death, and\r\nby means of the hæmadynamometer during life, that, when the poison is\r\nintroduced directly into a vein, so as to prove fatal in forty-five\r\nseconds, the contractions of the heart, though irregular, are not\r\nmaterially impaired in energy.[1869] On the other hand Schubarth states\r\nthat the heart is never contractile, although the intestines and\r\nvoluntary muscles retain their contractility.[1870] The reason of these\r\ndiscrepant statements is that, as I have had occasion to observe, a\r\nconsiderable difference really prevails in experiments conducted under\r\ncircumstances apparently the same. In eight experiments on cats and\r\nrabbits with the pure acid the heart contracted spontaneously, as well\r\nas under stimuli, for some time after death, except in the instance of\r\nthe rabbit killed with twenty-five grains, and one of the cats killed by\r\nthree drops applied to the tongue. In the last two the pulsations of the\r\nheart ceased with the short fit of tetanus which preceded death; and in\r\nthe rabbit, whose chest was laid open instantly after death, the heart\r\nwas gorged and its irritability utterly extinct. The later researches of\r\nDr. Lonsdale likewise show great varieties in the condition of the\r\nheart; and he has been led to conclude that the diluted acid does not\r\nperceptibly influence the heart, while the pure acid enfeebles it, if\r\nintroduced into the stomach, but arrests it, if injected into the\r\nwindpipe.[1871]\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Emmert, Coullon, and Krimer show that the diluted\r\nacid acts most energetically through the serous membranes, and next upon\r\nthe stomach; that it also acts with energy on the cellular tissue; that\r\nit has no effect when applied to the trunks or cut extremities of\r\nnerves, or to a fissure made in the brain or spinal marrow; that its\r\naction is prevented when the vessels of any part are tied before the\r\npart is touched with the poison; that its action is not prevented by\r\npreviously dividing the nerves; and that it may sometimes be discovered\r\nin the blood after death by chemical analysis,[1872] and frequently by\r\nthe smell when analysis cannot succeed in separating it.[1873] These\r\nresults favour the supposition that hydrocyanic acid acts through the\r\nmedium of the blood-vessels. But the extreme rapidity of its operation\r\nin large doses is usually considered incompatible with an action through\r\nthe blood, or any other channel except direct conveyance along the\r\nnerves. The tremendous rapidity of action indicated by the experiments\r\nof Magendie, or of Mr. Macaulay (p. 543), of M. Robert, as well as in\r\nsome of those performed by myself,—certainly appears rather inconsistent\r\nwith the notion, that the acid must enter the blood-vessels before\r\nproducing its effects.\r\n\r\nThis acid acts on the brain and also on the spine independently of its\r\naction on the brain. Its action on both is clearly indicated by the\r\ncombination of coma with tetanus. The independent action on the spine is\r\nwell shown by the following experiment of Wedemeyer. In a dog the spinal\r\ncord was divided at the top of the loins, so that no movement took place\r\nwhen the hind-legs were pricked: hydrocyanic acid being then introduced\r\ninto a wound in the left hind-leg, symptoms of poisoning commenced in\r\none minute, and the hind-legs were affected with convulsions as well as\r\nthe fore-legs.[1874]\r\n\r\nHydrocyanic acid affects all animals indiscriminately. From the highest\r\nto the lowest in the scale of creation all are killed by it; and all\r\nperish nearly in the same manner. Such is the result of a very extensive\r\nseries of experiments by Coullon.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to observe that hydrocyanic acid acts\r\nenergetically as a poison, through whatever channel it is introduced\r\ninto the body. Whether it be swallowed, or injected into the rectum, or\r\ndropped into the eye, or applied to a fresh wound, or inhaled in the\r\nform of vapour, its action is exerted with tremendous energy. Perhaps it\r\nmay even act through the sound skin. It has not, hitherto, indeed, been\r\nfound to affect animals in this way, evidently because their skin is too\r\nthick and impermeable. But M. Robiquet informed me that once, while he\r\nwas making some experiments on the tension of its vapour, his fingers,\r\nafter being some time exposed to it, became affected with numbness,\r\nwhich lasted several days; I have repeatedly remarked the same effect\r\nwhen handling tubes which contained the concentrated acid; and Emmert\r\nfound that the essential oil of bitter almond, applied to the uninjured\r\nskin of the back of a rabbit, produced the usual symptoms and death: and\r\nthat the peculiar odour of the poison was quite distinct after death in\r\nthe deep-seated muscles of the back.[1875]\r\n\r\nThis substance is poisonous in all its chemical combinations. Coullon\r\nremarked that two drops of the hydrocyanate of ammonia killed a sparrow\r\nin two minutes.[1876] Robiquet and Magendie found that a hundredth part\r\nof a grain of the cyanide of potassium killed a linnet in thirty\r\nseconds, and five grains a large pointer in fifteen minutes;[1877]\r\nOrfila has related an instance of death in the human subject within an\r\nhour after the administration of six grains of cyanide of potassium in\r\nan injection;[1878] and in a recent experimental investigation the same\r\nauthor found that this salt produces all the effects of hydrocyanic\r\nacid.[1879] Schubarth killed a dog in twenty minutes with twenty drops\r\nof the diluted acid neutralized by ammonia,[1880] and another in three\r\nhours with twenty-five drops neutralized by potass. These facts are a\r\nsufficient answer to a statement made by Mr. Murray of London, to the\r\neffect, that a considerable dose of the acid may be given without injury\r\nto a rabbit,[1881] if previously rendered alkaline by ammonia. But,\r\nnevertheless, as will be seen under the head of the treatment, ammonia,\r\nas Mr. Murray stated, is a good antidote when administered after the\r\npoison as a stimulant.\r\n\r\nThe _ferro-cyanates_, or prussiates, do not possess deleterious\r\nproperties. These salts were at one time considered compounds of\r\nhydrocyanic acid with a double oxidized base, oxide of iron being one.\r\nThus the prussiate of potass was considered a compound of hydrocyanic\r\nacid with potass and oxide of iron. But since the investigations of Mr.\r\nPorrett, it has been admitted that there is only one base, potash; and\r\nthat it is in union with a hydracid, called ferro-cyanic acid, the\r\nradicle of which is a ternary body composed of carbon, azote, and iron.\r\nThe physiological effects of this substance, which have been examined by\r\nmany experimentalists, are favourable to Porrett’s opinion; for although\r\nsome have found it poisonous, all agree in assigning it very feeble\r\nproperties, and some have not been able to discover in it any\r\ndeleterious quality at all. Coullon observes that Gazan killed a dog\r\nwith two drachms, and Callies another with three drachms of the salt met\r\nwith in commerce.[1882] Schubarth found that half an ounce had not any\r\nmaterial effect on dogs, even when vomiting did not occur for half an\r\nhour;[1883] and Callies, who found the salt of commerce somewhat\r\npoisonous, also remarked, that when it was carefully prepared, several\r\nounces might be given without harm.[1884] D’Arcet once swallowed half a\r\npound of a solution without any injury.[1885] Similar results were\r\nobtained previously with smaller doses by Wollaston, Marcet,[1886] and\r\nEmmert,[1887] as well as afterwards by Dr. Macneven,[1888] and\r\nSchubarth,[1889] who found that a drachm or even two drachms might be\r\ntaken with impunity by man and the lower animals.\r\n\r\nThe _sulpho-cyanic acid_, another substance analogous in chemical nature\r\nto the ferro-cyanic, was once supposed like it to be a poison of great\r\nactivity, but this is doubtful. Professor Mayer of Bonn ascertained that\r\na drachm and a half of a moderately strong solution of the acid\r\nsometimes killed a rabbit in ninety seconds when injected into the\r\nwindpipe, and that the same quantity of a solution of sulpho-cyanate of\r\npotassa might occasion death in the course of four hours; but that some\r\nrabbits took half an ounce of the former and three drachms of the latter\r\nwithout material harm, both when administered through the windpipe, when\r\ninjected into the rectum, and when introduced into the stomach by a\r\ngullet-tube. In the fatal cases death took place under symptoms of\r\noppressed breathing, rarely attended with convulsions; and extensive\r\ntraces of irritation were found in the alimentary canal.[1890] Dr.\r\nWestrumb of Hameln, however, seems to have found it more active in the\r\nform of sulpho-cyanate of potassa. Two scruples in an ounce of water\r\nproduced in a dog spasmodic breathing, convulsions, efforts to vomit,\r\nand death in seven minutes; and forty grains killed another in less than\r\ntwo hours. In the latter animal he detected the poison by the sulphate\r\nof iron in the blood, lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys.[1891] Some\r\nexperiments by Soemering would even make it out to be a poison of very\r\ngreat energy; for half a drachm of concentrated sulpho-cyanic acid given\r\nto a dog occasioned immediate death; and the same quantity of\r\nsulpho-cyanate of potassa killed another in one minute.[1892]\r\n\r\n_Cyanic and cyanous acids_ are not poisonous, according to the\r\nexperiments of Hünefield;[1893] but _cyanogen_ is a powerful poison, as\r\nwill be mentioned under the head of the Narcotic Gases.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of hydrocyanic acid observed in man are very similar to\r\nthose witnessed in animals.\r\n\r\nCoullon has given a good account of the effects of small doses as\r\nascertained by experiment on himself. When he took from 20 to 86 drops\r\nof a diluted acid, he was attacked for a few minutes with nausea,\r\nsalivation, hurried pulse, weight and pain in the head, succeeded by a\r\nfeeling of anxiety, which lasted about six hours.[1894] Such symptoms\r\nare apt to be induced by too large medicinal doses. Another remarkable\r\nsymptom which has been sometimes observed during its medicinal use is\r\nsalivation with ulceration of the mouth. Dr. Macleod thrice had occasion\r\nto remark this in patients who had been using the drug for about a\r\nfortnight, and twice in one individual; and Dr. Granville says he had\r\nalso twice witnessed the same effect.[1895]\r\n\r\nAs to the effects of fatal doses, it is probable that in man, as in\r\nanimals, two varieties exist. When the dose is very large, death will in\r\ngeneral take place suddenly, without convulsions. But for obvious\r\nreasons the symptoms in such cases have not been hitherto witnessed.\r\n\r\nThe most complete account of the symptoms from fatal doses when\r\nconvulsions occur, is given in a case reported by Hufeland of a man,\r\nwho, when apprehended for theft, swallowed an ounce of alcoholized acid,\r\ncontaining about forty grains of the pure acid. He was observed\r\nimmediately to stagger a few steps, and then to sink down without a\r\ngroan, apparently lifeless. A physician, who instantly saw him, found\r\nthe pulse gone and the breathing for some time imperceptible. After a\r\nshort interval he made so forcible an expiration that the ribs seemed\r\ndrawn almost to the spine. The legs and arms then became cold, the eyes\r\nprominent, glistening, and quite insensible; and after one or two more\r\nconvulsive expirations he died, five minutes after swallowing the\r\npoison.[1896]\r\n\r\nIn Horn’s Journal is recorded another case which also proved fatal in\r\nfive minutes, with precisely the same symptoms.[1897] A short notice of\r\nwhat appears to have been a similar case is given in the Annales de\r\nChimie. The person was a chemist’s servant, who swallowed a large\r\nquantity of the alcoholic solution by mistake for a liqueur, the poison\r\nhaving been accidentally left on the table by her master, who had been\r\nshowing it as a curiosity to some friends. No account is given of the\r\nsymptoms, farther than that she died apoplectic in two minutes.[1898] To\r\nthese cases may be also added a short notice of the French physician’s\r\ncase mentioned at the commencement of this chapter. It will convey a\r\ngood idea of the operation of the poison when not quite sufficient to\r\nkill. Very soon after swallowing a tea-spoonful of the diluted acid he\r\nfelt confusion in the head, and soon fell down insensible, with\r\ndifficult breathing, a small pulse, a bloated countenance, dilated\r\ninsensible pupils, and locked jaw. Afterwards he had several fits of\r\ntetanus, one of them extremely violent. In two hours and a half he began\r\nto recover his intellects and rapidly became sensible; but for some days\r\nhe suffered much from ulceration of the mouth and violent pulmonary\r\ncatarrh, which had evidently been excited by the ammonia given for the\r\npurpose of rousing him. This gentleman had eructations with the odour of\r\nthe acid three or four hours after he took it; and during the earlier\r\nsymptoms the same odour was exhaled by his breath.[1899] The hydrocyanic\r\nodour of the breath is of course an important distinguishing character,\r\nwhich would appear, from the observations of Dr. Lonsdale on\r\nanimals,[1900] to occur more frequently than might be supposed from the\r\nsilence observed on the subject by the reporters of cases.\r\n\r\nHydrocyanic acid is not considered a cumulative poison,—that is, the\r\ncontinued use of frequent small doses is not believed to possess the\r\npower recognised in iodine, mercury, and foxglove, of gradually and\r\nsilently accumulating in the body, and then suddenly breaking out with\r\ndangerous or fatal violence. The frequent experience of practitioners in\r\nthis and other countries seems to prove that hydrocyanic acid possesses\r\nno such property. It is right at the same time to mention, that a case\r\npublished by Dr. Baumgärtner of Freyburg has been thought by some[1901]\r\nto establish the reverse. A man had taken for two months, on account of\r\nchronic catarrh, ten drops of Ittner’s acid daily in doses of one grain,\r\nwithout experiencing the slightest toxicological effect. At length he\r\nwas found one morning in bed apparently labouring under the poisonous\r\noperation of the acid. He had headache, blindness, dilated insensible\r\npupil, feeble irregular pulse, occasional suspension of the breathing,\r\nand rapidly increasing insensibility. The cold affusion and ammonia were\r\nimmediately resorted to, and at first with advantage. But in no long\r\ntime spasms commenced in the toes, and gradually affected the rest of\r\nthe body, till at length violent fits of general tetanus were formed,\r\nlasting for six or ten minutes, and alternating in the intervals with\r\ncoma. Venesection was next resorted to; after which the spasms were\r\nconfined to the jaw and eyes. Delirium succeeded, but was removed by a\r\nrepetition of the blood-letting. At four in the afternoon he was\r\ntolerably sensible; during the night delirium returned; at ten next\r\nmorning he recovered his sight; and on the subsequent morning he had no\r\ncomplaint but headache and pain in the eyes.[1902] This case differs so\r\nmuch from every other in the collateral circumstances, as well as in\r\nduration, that, although the symptoms themselves correspond with those\r\nof poisoning with hydrocyanic acid, we may justly suspect either some\r\nother cause, or the accidental administration of too large a dose. It\r\nought, however, to turn the attention of practitioners to the\r\npossibility of this poison acting by the accumulation of the effects of\r\nsmall doses frequently repeated for a great length of time.\r\n\r\nThe period within which hydrocyanic acid usually proves fatal is fixed\r\nwith considerable accuracy, not only by the cases observed in the human\r\nsubject, but likewise by the experiments of many physiologists, and more\r\nespecially those of Schubarth (p. 583). It is probable that very large\r\ndoses occasion death in a few seconds; and at all events a few minutes\r\nwill suffice to extinguish life when the dose is considerable; but if\r\nthe individual survive forty minutes, he will generally recover. In the\r\ncourse of a dreadful accident which happened a few years ago in one of\r\nthe Parisian hospitals, when seven epileptic patients were killed at one\r\ntime by too large doses of the medicinal acid, it was found that several\r\ndid not die for forty-five minutes.[1903] But the researches of\r\nSchubarth would certainly justify the expectation that recovery will\r\ntake place under active treatment when the patient survives so\r\nlong.—These facts may be highly important in the practice of medical\r\njurisprudence.\r\n\r\nThe period within which it begins to operate ought also to be accurately\r\nascertained for the same reason. Indeed in a very interesting trial,\r\nwhich took place a few years ago in this country, the fate of the\r\nprisoner depended in a great measure on the question, within how short a\r\ntime the effects of this poison must show themselves?[1904] The nature\r\nof the case was as follows: An apothecary’s maid-servant at Leicester\r\nwho was pregnant by her master’s apprentice, was found one morning dead\r\nin bed; and she had obviously been poisoned with hydrocyanic acid.\r\nCircumstances led to the suspicion that the apprentice was accessary to\r\nthe administration of the poison. On the other hand, it was distinctly\r\nproved that the deceased had made arrangements for a miscarriage by\r\nartificial means on the night of her death; and it was therefore\r\nrepresented, on the part of the prisoner, that she had taken the poison\r\nof her own accord. But the body was found stretched out in bed in a\r\ncomposed posture, with the arms crossed over the trunk, and the\r\nbed-clothes pulled smoothly up to the chin; and at her right side lay a\r\nsmall narrow-necked phial, from which about five drachms of the\r\nmedicinal prussic acid had been taken, and which was corked and wrapped\r\nin paper. There naturally arose a question, whether the deceased, after\r\ndrinking the poison out of such a vessel, could, before becoming\r\ninsensible, have time to cork up the phial, wrap it up, and adjust the\r\nbed-clothes?[1905] To settle this point, experiments were made at the\r\nrequest of the judge, by Mr. Macaulay, Mr. Paget, and several other\r\nmedical men of Leicester; and on the trial they, with the exception of\r\nMr. Paget, gave it as their opinion, founded on the experiments, that\r\nthe supposed acts of volition, although within the bounds of\r\npossibility, were in the highest degree improbable. The chief\r\nexperiments were three in number, from which it appeared that one dog\r\nwas killed with four drachms in eight seconds, another with four drachms\r\nin seven seconds, and another with four drachms and a half in three\r\nseconds; but in other experiments the interval was greater.—For these\r\nparticulars I am indebted to Mr. Macaulay.\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of this work I expressed my concurrence with the\r\nmajority of the witnesses. But some facts, which came subsequently under\r\nmy notice, led me to think that this concurrence was given rather too\r\nunreservedly. I still adhere so far to my original views as to think it\r\nimprobable that, if the deceased, after swallowing the poison, had time\r\nto cork the phial, wrap it in paper, pull up the bed-clothes, and place\r\nthe bottle at her side, the progress of the symptoms could have been so\r\nrapid and the convulsions so slight, as to occasion no disorder in the\r\nappearance of the body and the bed-clothes,—and I still likewise think,\r\nthat after swallowing so large a dose it was improbable she could have\r\nperformed all the successive acts of volition mentioned above—with\r\nordinary deliberation. But I am informed on good authority, that some\r\ngentlemen interested in the case found by actual trial, that all the\r\nacts alluded to might be accomplished, if gone about with promptitude,\r\nwithin the short period, which, in some of their experiments, the\r\nwitnesses found to elapse, before the action of the poison commenced.\r\nAnd such being the fact, we ought not perhaps to attach too great\r\nimportance to the other argument I have employed,—the probability of\r\ndisorder in the body and bed-clothes from the convulsions; for if the\r\npoisoning commenced very soon, the convulsions might have been slight.\r\nThe results of my own experiments related in p. 582, although on the\r\nwhole confirmatory of those of Mr. Macaulay and his colleagues, are\r\nnevertheless sufficient to prove that large doses occasionally do not\r\nbegin to operate with such rapidity as was observed in their\r\nexperiments; for in one instance four drops of concentrated acid,\r\nequivalent to two scruples of medicinal acid, did not begin to act on a\r\nrabbit for twenty seconds; and certainly, for so small an animal, two\r\nscruples are as large a dose as five drachms for a grown-up girl.\r\n\r\nThe two following cases will throw some farther light on the time within\r\nwhich this poison begins to act on man when taken in large quantity. The\r\nfirst case shows, that even when an enormous dose is taken, a few simple\r\nvoluntary acts may be executed before the symptoms begin. In this\r\ninstance which is related by Dr. Gierl of Lindau, the dose was no less\r\nthan four ounces of the acid of the Bavarian Pharmacopœia, which\r\ncontains four per cent. of pure acid, and is equivalent to five ounces\r\nat least of that commonly used in Britain and France. The subject, an\r\napothecary’s assistant, was found dead in bed, with an empty two-ounce\r\nphial on each side of the bed,—the mattrass, which is used in Germany\r\ninstead of blankets, pulled up as high as the breast,—the right arm\r\nextended straight down beneath the mattrass,—and the left arm bent on\r\nthe elbow.[1906] The second case proves that, although one or two acts\r\nof volition may be accomplished, the interval is so very brief that\r\nthese acts can only be of the simplest kind. An apothecary’s\r\napprentice-lad was sent from the shop to the cellar for some carbonate\r\nof potass; but he had not been a few minutes away, when his companions\r\nheard him cry in a voice of great alarm, “Hartshorn! Hartshorn!” On\r\ninstantly rushing down stairs, they found him reclining on the lower\r\nsteps and grasping the rail; and he had scarcely time to mutter “Prussic\r\nacid!” when he expired,—not more than five minutes after leaving the\r\nshop. On the floor of the cellar an ounce-phial was found, which had\r\nbeen filled with the Bavarian hydrocyanic acid, but contained only a\r\ndrachm. It appeared that he had taken the acid ignorantly for an\r\nexperiment; and from the state of the articles in the cellar, it was\r\nevident that, alarmed at its instantaneous operation, he had tried to\r\nget at the ammonia, which he knew was the antidote, but had found the\r\ntremendous activity of the poison would not allow him even to undo the\r\ncoverings of the bottle.[1907]\r\n\r\nWhen the quantity of the poison is small, a much longer interval may\r\nelapse before the commencement of its action. Thus, when the dose is\r\nbarely short of what is required to occasion death, the effects may be\r\npostponed even for fifteen minutes, as in a case which occurred to Mr.\r\nGarson of Stromness.[1908] This, so far as I am at present aware, is the\r\nextreme limit of interval hitherto observed.\r\n\r\nIn the trial related above the prisoner Freeman was found _Not Guilty_.\r\n\r\nIt is important to fix, if possible, the smallest fatal dose of\r\nhydrocyanic acid. This will vary with particular circumstances, such as\r\nthe strength of the individual, and the fulness or emptiness of the\r\nstomach at the time. The cases of the Parisian epileptics, who were\r\nkilled each by a draught containing two-thirds of a grain of pure\r\nacid,[1909] will supply pointed information. For, on the one hand,\r\nconsidering the long time they survived, it is not probable that a dose\r\nmaterially less would have a fatal effect on man. And on the other hand\r\nrepeated instances of recovery have been observed, where the dose was as\r\ngreat or even greater. Thus Dr. Geoghegan had a patient who recovered\r\nfrom a state of extreme danger after taking two-thirds of a grain;[1910]\r\nand Mr. Banks of Lowth met with a case of recovery in similar\r\ncircumstances, where the dose was very nearly a whole grain.[1911]\r\n\r\nIt is almost unnecessary to add, that in man, as in animals, this poison\r\nwill act violently, through whatever channel it may be introduced into\r\nthe body. It has not been positively ascertained to act with force\r\nthrough the unbroken skin. The chemist Scharinger indeed was supposed to\r\nhave been killed in consequence of accidentally spilling the acid on his\r\nnaked arm;[1912] but this was in all probability a mistake. Should the\r\nskin be freely exposed to the air it seems reasonable to expect that the\r\npoison will evaporate before it could act with energy; but if confined\r\nby pledgets or otherwise, a different result might ensue. Through every\r\nother surface, however, besides the unbroken skin, hydrocyanic acid acts\r\nwith very great power; and it is in particular important to remember\r\nthat its power is very great when inhaled, so that dangerous accidents\r\nhave ensued even from its vapour incautiously snuffed up the nostrils. I\r\nhave known a strong man suddenly struck down in this way; a French\r\nphysician, M. Damiron, has related the case of an apothecary who\r\nremained insensible for half an hour subsequently to the same\r\naccident;[1913] and cases of the kind are more apt to occur than might\r\nat first view be thought, because, contrary to what is generally\r\nbelieved and stated in chemical as well as medico-legal works, its smell\r\nis for a few seconds barely perceptible, and never of the kind which\r\nthese accounts would lead one to anticipate. Accidental death may\r\nreadily arise from its action on a wound or an abraded surface.\r\nSobernheim mentions that Mr. Scharring, a druggist at Vienna, was\r\npoisoned in consequence of a phial of the acid breaking in his hand and\r\nwounding it; and he expired in an hour.[1914]\r\n\r\nThe only case with which I am acquainted of poisoning with the\r\nartificial compounds of hydrocyanic acid is that formerly alluded to as\r\nhaving been occasioned by the cyanide of potassium. Six grains dissolved\r\nin a clyster amounting to six ounces, occasioned general convulsions,\r\npalpitations, slow laboured breathing, coldness of the limbs, dilated\r\npupil, fixing of the eyeballs, and death in one hour,—phenomena much the\r\nsame with those produced by the acid itself.[1915]—Another case has been\r\npublished, in which a French physician, ignorant of the correct dose,\r\nprescribed a potion with three grains of cyanide of potassium twice a\r\nday. Immediately after the first dose the patient was seized with the\r\nusual symptoms of poisoning with hydrocyanic acid; and expired in\r\nthree-quarters of an hour.[1916] In noticing the first of these cases,\r\nOrfila draws the attention of practitioners particularly to the fact,\r\nthat not long before a similar dose of a sample of cyanide, which had\r\nbeen moist for some time, was twice administered with impunity. The\r\nreason is that the cyanide of potassium undergoes decomposition when\r\nacted on by water, or when long kept.\r\n\r\n\r\n SECTION III.—_Of the Morbid Appearances produced by Hydrocyanic Acid._\r\n\r\nUnder this head the appearances in a special case will first be\r\nmentioned, and then the varieties to which they are liable.\r\n\r\nIn _Hufeland’s_ case [p. 587] the inspection was made the day after\r\ndeath. The eyes were still glistening, like those of a person alive; but\r\nthe countenance was pale and composed like one asleep. The spine and\r\nneck were stiff, the belly drawn in, the back alone livid. The body\r\ngenerally, the blood even within the head, and especially the serous\r\ncavities, exhaled a hydrocyanic odour, so strong as to irritate the\r\nnostrils. The blood was every where very fluid, so that two pounds\r\nflowed from the incision in the scalp and twelve ounces from that of the\r\ndura mater; and it had a glimmering bluish appearance, as if Prussian\r\nblue had been mixed with it. The vessels of the brain were gorged, the\r\nsubstance of the brain natural, and the left ventricle distended with\r\nhalf an ounce of serum. The villous coat of the stomach was red, easily\r\nremoved with the nail, and gangrenous.[1917] The intestines were\r\nreddish, and the liver gorged. The lungs were also turgid, and to such a\r\ndegree in the depending parts as to resemble the liver. The arteries and\r\nleft cavities of the heart were empty, the veins and right cavities\r\ndistended.\r\n\r\nIn commenting on this description it is first to be remarked, that the\r\nblood, as in the preceding case, is generally altered in nature. Ittner,\r\nwho made some good experiments on the subject, found it in animals\r\nblack, viscid, and oily in consistence.[1918] Emmert found it fluid and\r\nof a cochineal colour. In a case related by Mertzdorff of an\r\napothecary’s apprentice, who was found dead in bed after swallowing\r\nthree drachms and a half of diluted acid,[1919] in the case recorded in\r\nHorn’s Archiv, and in that related by Dr. Gierl, it was fluid. It was\r\nalso perfectly fluid every where in the bodies of the seven epileptic\r\npatients poisoned at Paris. Yet this state is not invariable. Coullon,\r\nthough his results tally in general with those of Ittner and Emmert, has\r\ngiven some experiments in which the blood coagulated after flowing from\r\nthe body;[1920] and in the case of an apothecary related in Rust’s\r\nJournal it was found coagulated in the heart.[1921]\r\n\r\nIn the next place, Magendie and other physiologists have observed that,\r\nas in Hufeland’s case, the blood and cavities of the body in animals\r\nexhale a hydrocyanic odour, even though the quantity taken was small.\r\nThe blood did so likewise in the heart of the apothecary just mentioned\r\nas well as throughout the whole body in the case described in Horn’s\r\nJournal. The odour, however, is not always present. For example, there\r\nwas none in the case of another German apothecary, who poisoned himself\r\nwith an ounce, as recorded in a later volume of Rust’s Journal;[1922]\r\nneither was there any odour in the blood in Mertzdorff’s case, although\r\nit was strong in the stomach; nor in the blood nor any other part of the\r\nbody in the Parisian epileptics. It also appears from an experiment by\r\nSchubarth,[1923] and from a case by Leuret where life was prolonged\r\nabove fifteen minutes,[1924]—that the odour may be distinct in the\r\nblood, brain, or chest, when hardly any is to be perceived in the\r\nstomach. Schubarth has inquired with some care into the circumstances\r\nunder which the hydrocyanic odour may, or may not, be expected. He\r\nstates, as the result of his researches, that if the dose is sufficient\r\nto cause death within ten minutes, the peculiar odour will always be\r\nremarked in the blood of the heart, lungs, and great vessels, provided\r\nthe body have not been exposed to rain or to a current of air, and the\r\nexamination be made within a moderate interval,—for example, twenty-one\r\nhours for so small an animal as a dog; but that, if the dose is so small\r\nthat life is prolonged for fifteen, twenty-seven, or thirty-two minutes,\r\nthen even immediately after death it may be impossible to remark any of\r\nthe peculiar odour, evidently because, as already mentioned, the acid is\r\nrapidly discharged by the lungs; and that even when the dose is large\r\nenough to cause death in four minutes, the smell may not be perceived if\r\nthe carcase has been left in a spacious apartment for two days, or\r\nexposed to a shower for a few hours only. These facts explain\r\nsatisfactorily why no odour could be perceived in the bodies of the\r\nParisian epileptics; for they lived from half an hour to forty-five\r\nminutes. The poison may exist in the stomach, though not appreciable by\r\nthe sense of smell. In Chevallier’s case mentioned above, the contents\r\nof the stomach had not any odour of hydrocyanic acid; which, however,\r\nwas evident to the sense of smell, and plainly indicated by various\r\ntests, in the fluid obtained by distilling the contents.\r\n\r\nThe presence of this odour in the blood may be accounted strong evidence\r\nof poisoning with hydrocyanic acid, if it is unequivocal to the sense of\r\nseveral individuals. An exhalation of the same kind is occasionally\r\nformed by natural processes in the excrement. Itard once remarked in a\r\ncase of inflammation of the intestines, and again in a case of inflamed\r\nliver, a strong smell of bitter almonds in the fæces, although no\r\nmedicine containing hydrocyanic acid had been given.[1925] Mr. Taylor\r\nmentions that he once observed a sort of hydrocyanic odour in the brain\r\nof a person who died of natural disease.[1926] These facts will render\r\nthe inspector cautious, but can scarcely throw a doubt over evidence\r\nderived from an unequivocal hydrocyanic odour in the blood.\r\n\r\nFew successful attempts have yet been made to detect the acid in the\r\nblood by chemical analysis. The odour may be present, although chemical\r\nanalysis fails in eliciting any indication. This follows from the\r\nobservations of Dr. Lonsdale,[1927] as well as of various authors quoted\r\nby him in his paper. The cyanide of potassium has been detected by Mayer\r\nnot merely in the blood, but likewise in the serous secretions and\r\nsundry soft solids.[1928]\r\n\r\nIn most instances,—for example, in the Parisian epileptics, the state of\r\nthe brain, as to turgescence of vessels, has corresponded with the\r\ndescription given by Hufeland. Venous turgescence and emptiness of the\r\narterial system are commonly remarked throughout the whole body. Thus in\r\nthe epileptic patients, the heart and great arteries were empty; the\r\ngreat veins gorged; the spleen gorged, soft, and pultaceous; the veins\r\nof the liver gorged; and the kidneys of a deep violet colour, much\r\nsoftened, and their veins gorged with black blood.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible that hydrocyanic acid could cause gangrene of the\r\nstomach, which is said to have been witnessed in Hufeland’s case. But\r\nthere are often signs of irritation in that organ. The villous coat has\r\nbeen found red in animals; it was shrivelled, and its vessels were\r\nturgid with black blood in the instance of the apothecary mentioned in\r\nthe fourteenth volume of Rust’s Journal; in Mertzdorff’s case it was red\r\nand checkered with bloody streaks; and in the case related by Dr. Gierl,\r\nwhere four ounces were swallowed, it was dark-red, as it were tanned or\r\nsteeped in spirits, and easily separated from the subjacent contents.\r\nThe contents of the stomach have in every instance had a strong\r\nhydrocyanic odour, except in the cases of the Parisian epileptics, and\r\nin those related by Leuret and by Chevallier. According to the\r\nexperiments of Lassaigne and Schubarth, formerly noticed, it is not to\r\nbe looked for when the body has been kept a few days, more especially if\r\nthe individual lived some time. Dr. Lonsdale generally found it eight or\r\nnine days after death in animals, which had been either buried during\r\nthat time, or kept in an apartment at the temperature of 50° F.[1929] In\r\na case which occurred not long ago in London the poison was found in the\r\nstomach five days after death. A coroner’s inquest had terminated in a\r\nverdict of natural death. But suspicions having arisen, that the man had\r\npoisoned himself in anticipation of a charge of forgery, another inquiry\r\nwas made; when the odour of hydrocyanic acid was evolved from the\r\ncontents of the stomach, and the distilled water obtained from them\r\nyielded decisive chemical evidence of its being present.[1930] It is\r\nimportant to observe, in reference to the evidence of hydrocyanic acid\r\nin the stomach, that here, as in the instance of the blood, the odour\r\nmay be strong, and yet the poison may not be discoverable by analysis.\r\nThis fact rests on the united testimony of Coullon, Vauquelin, Leuret,\r\nTurner, and Dr. Lonsdale; the last of whom mentions that he could not\r\ndetect it chemically after the fourth day in the bodies of some animals,\r\nin which it was perceptible by its odour even four or five days\r\nlater.[1931] It is possible, however, that these failures to detect the\r\npoison by analysis may have sometimes arisen from imperfections in the\r\nmethod of analysis employed; for it was detected by the process formerly\r\nmentioned in the stomach of the apothecary last alluded to, in\r\nChevallier’s case, though not perceptible to the smell, and frequently\r\nby Lassaigne in animals.\r\n\r\nMertzdorff remarked both in his case of poisoning with hydrocyanic acid,\r\nand likewise in a parallel instance of poisoning with the essential oil\r\nof bitter almonds,[1932] a singular appearance in the bile, the colour\r\nof which was altered to deep blue.\r\n\r\nCoullon and Emmert say they have observed, that the bodies of animals\r\nresist putrefaction. The latter in particular mentions, that he had left\r\nthem several days in a warm room without perceiving any sign of decay.\r\nThis certainly would not _à priori_ be expected, considering the state\r\nof the blood. And it is not universal; for in one instance, the case of\r\nMertzdorff, putrefaction commenced within thirty hours after death. In\r\nthe Parisian epileptics, the bodies passed through the usual stage of\r\nrigidity.\r\n\r\nIt appears that even long after death the eye, as in Hufeland’s case,\r\nhas a peculiar glistening and staring expression, so as to render it\r\ndifficult to believe that the individual is really dead; and this\r\nappearance has been considered by Dr. Paris so remarkable, as even alone\r\nto supply “decisive evidence of poisoning by hydrocyanic acid.”[1933]\r\nBut the accuracy of this opinion may be questioned. The appearance is\r\nindeed very general in cases of poisoning with preparations containing\r\nhydrocyanic acid. Besides occurring in the case of Hufeland, and in that\r\nwhich gave occasion to Dr. Paris’s statement, it was witnessed by\r\nMertzdorff, and in the instance described in Horn’s Journal. But it is\r\nnot a constant appearance; for it was not observed in the seven Parisian\r\nepileptics. Neither is it peculiar; for death from carbonic acid has the\r\nsame effect; I have remarked it six hours after death in a woman who\r\ndied of cholera; and it has been observed in cases of death during the\r\nepileptic paroxysm.\r\n\r\n\r\n   SECTION IV.—_Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Hydrocyanic Acid._\r\n\r\nMuch attention has been lately paid to the treatment of this variety of\r\npoisoning; and the object of those who have studied it has naturally\r\nbeen the discovery of an antidote.\r\n\r\nAn antidote to hydrocyanic acid must either be a substance which renders\r\nit immediately insoluble, or one which exerts upon the body an action\r\ncontrary to that excited by the poison, that is, a powerful stimulant\r\naction on the nervous system. Hence all such remedies as oil, milk,\r\nsoap, coffee, treacle, turpentine, at one time thought serviceable, are\r\nquite inert.[1934]\r\n\r\nAntidotes have hitherto been chiefly sought for among the powerful,\r\ndiffusible stimulants. And it is plain, that even although a chemical\r\nantidote were known, a stimulant antidote is indispensable also, because\r\nthe mischief done, before the poison can be rendered inert, is generally\r\nsufficient to cause death, unless counteracted by treatment.\r\n\r\nOf the diffusible stimulants, _ammonia_ is considered by many the most\r\nenergetic antidote. The first who made careful experiments with it was\r\nMr. John Murray of London; and he was so convinced of its efficacy, that\r\nhe expressed himself ready to swallow a dose of the acid large enough to\r\nprove fatal, provided a skilful person were beside him to administer the\r\nantidote.[1935] The favourable results obtained by Murray were\r\nafterwards confirmed by M. Dupuy.[1936] Afterwards, however, the\r\nefficacy of ammonia was called in question. Orfila stated in the third\r\nedition of his Toxicology that he had several times satisfied himself of\r\nthe complete inutility of this as well as many other antidotes.[1937]\r\nAnd Dr. Herbst of Göttingen made some careful experiments, from which he\r\nconcludes that ammonia, though useful when the dose of poison is not\r\nlarge enough to kill, and even capable of making an animal that has\r\ntaken a fatal dose jump up and run about for a little, yet will never\r\nsave its life.[1938] But farther experiments by Orfila have led him to\r\nmodify his former statement, and to admit, that, although liquid ammonia\r\nis of no use when introduced into the stomach, yet if the vapour from it\r\nis inhaled, life may sometimes be preserved, provided the dose of the\r\npoison be not large enough to act with great rapidity. He remarked, that\r\nwhen from eight to fourteen drops of the medicinal acid were given to\r\ndogs of various sizes, they died in the course of fifteen minutes if\r\nleft without assistance, but were sometimes saved by being made to\r\ninhale ammoniacal water, and recovered completely in little more than an\r\nhour.[1939] As this is very nearly the conclusion to which Mr. Murray\r\nwas led by his experiments performed in 1822, it is rather\r\nextraordinary, that his name, as the undoubted discoverer of the remedy,\r\nhas never been mentioned by the Parisian Professor. Buchner, it is right\r\nto add, had found this remedy useful in the same year in which Mr.\r\nMurray’s experiments were made.[1940] A gentleman who took an over-dose\r\nof two drachms of hydrocyanic acid while using it medicinally, and who\r\nseems to have been in great danger, owed his recovery to the assiduous\r\nuse of carbonate of ammonia held to the nostrils, and spirit of ammonia\r\ninternally. Relief was obtained immediately.[1941] Orfila suggests an\r\nimportant caution,—not to use a strong ammoniacal liquor, otherwise the\r\nmouth, air-passages, and even the alimentary canal may be attacked with\r\ninflammation,—as indeed happened to the French physician whose case was\r\nformerly mentioned. The strong _aqua ammoniæ_ should be diluted with\r\nseveral parts of water.\r\n\r\nAnother remedy of the same kind with ammonia as to action is _chlorine_.\r\nThis substance was first proposed as a remedy in 1822 by Riauz, a\r\nchemist of Ulm, who found that, when a pigeon, poisoned with hydrocyanic\r\nacid, was on the point of expiring, it immediately began to revive, on\r\nbeing made to breathe chlorine, and in fifteen minutes was able to fly\r\naway.[1942] Buchner repeated Riauz’s experiments and arrived at the same\r\nresults. More lately M. Simeon, apothecary to the hospital of St. Louis\r\nat Paris, apparently without being acquainted with the observations of\r\nthe German chemists, was likewise led to suppose, that this gas might\r\nprove a useful antidote;[1943] and MM. Cottereau and Vallette have\r\nformed the same conclusion.[1944] Orfila in his paper already quoted\r\nexpresses his conviction, that this remedy is the most powerful antidote\r\nof all hitherto proposed. His experiments have convinced him, that\r\nanimals, which have taken a dose of poison sufficient to kill them in\r\nfifteen or eighteen minutes, will be saved by inspiring water\r\nimpregnated with a fourth part of its volume of chlorine, even although\r\nthe application of the remedy be delayed till the poison has operated\r\nfor four or five minutes. In some of his experiments he waited till the\r\nconvulsive stage of the poisoning was passed, and the stage of\r\nflaccidity and insensibility had supervened; yet the animals were\r\nobviously out of danger ten minutes after the chlorine was first\r\napplied, and recovered entirely in three-quarters of an hour.[1945]\r\n\r\nThe last remedy of this nature which deserves notice is the _cold\r\naffusion_. This was first recommended by Dr. Herbst of Göttingen, who,\r\non account of the success he witnessed from it in animals, considers it\r\nthe best remedy yet proposed. When the dose of the poison was\r\ninsufficient to prove fatal in ordinary circumstances, two affusions he\r\nfound commonly sufficient to dispel every unpleasant symptom. When the\r\ndose was larger, it was necessary to repeat the effusion more\r\nfrequently. Its efficacy was always most certain when resorted to before\r\nthe convulsive stage of the poisoning was over; yet even in the stage of\r\ninsensibility and paralysis it was sometimes employed with success. In\r\nthe latter instance the first sign of amendment was renewal of the\r\nspasms of the muscles. Many experiments are related by the author in\r\nsupport of these statements. But the most decisive is the following. Two\r\npoodles of the same size being selected, hydrocyanic acid was given to\r\none of them in repeated small doses till it died. The whole quantity\r\nadministered being seven grains of Ittner’s acid, this dose was given at\r\nonce to the other dog. Immediately it fell down in convulsions, violent\r\nopisthotonos ensued, and in half a minute the convulsive stage was\r\nfollowed by flaccidity, imperceptible respiration, and failing pulse.\r\nThe cold affusion was immediately resorted to, but at first without any\r\namendment. After the second affusion, however, the opisthotonos\r\nreturned, and was accompanied by cries; and on the remedy being repeated\r\nevery fifteen minutes, the breathing gradually became easier and easier,\r\nthe spasms abated, and in a few hours the animal was quite well.[1946]\r\nProfessor Orfila repeated Dr. Herbst’s experiments, with analogous\r\nresults; but he considers the cold affusion inferior to\r\nchlorine.[1947]—It is probably advantageous to apply the cold water\r\nrather in the form of cold douche to the head and spine than to the body\r\nat large. Dr. Robinson of Sunderland found that rabbits, which had taken\r\ndoses adequate to occasion death, might be saved by pouring on the\r\nhindhead and along the spine cold water impregnated with common salt and\r\nnitre.[1948] A case, which seems to have been cured in this way, has\r\nbeen published by Mr. Banks of Lowth. A young woman took by mistake a\r\nsolution containing very nearly a grain of real acid, and immediately\r\nbecame insensible and convulsed. Ordinary stimulants were of no use. But\r\nin fifteen minutes, when the convulsions had ceased, and she lay in a\r\nstate of complete coma and general paralysis, the cold douche on the\r\nhead first renewed the convulsions, then strengthened the pulse and\r\nrestored some appearance of consciousness, and finally roused her, so\r\nthat in a few hours she was quite well.[1949]\r\n\r\nIt is probable, that _bleeding from the jugular vein_ deserves more\r\nattention as a remedy than it has yet received. The right side of the\r\nheart is almost invariably found much gorged with blood in animals\r\nexamined at the moment of death; and the contractions of the heart, in\r\nsuch circumstances imperfect or arrested altogether, have often been\r\nobserved by experimentalists to be instantly restored on promptly\r\nremoving the state of turgescence. Accordingly Dr. Cormack found that a\r\ndog, at the point of death after receiving a fatal dose of the acid, was\r\nspeedily roused and eventually saved by bleeding from the jugular\r\nvein.[1950] And in a careful inquiry by Dr. Lonsdale, it was ascertained\r\nthat the turgescence of the heart might be effectually diminished in\r\nthis way, and that recovery might frequently be accomplished when the\r\npoison was otherwise amply sufficient to have occasioned speedy\r\ndeath.[1951] In a case treated by Magendie, that of a young lady\r\npoisoned by too large a medicinal dose, the chief remedies were ammonia\r\nand blood-letting from the jugular vein; and she recovered.[1952]\r\n\r\nFew observations have hitherto been made on the chemical antidotes for\r\nhydrocyanic acid, or those substances which render it innoxious by\r\nconverting it into an insoluble compound. It is plain that several\r\nprobable antidotes of this kind exist. But toxicologists have been\r\napparently deterred from trying them by the fearful rapidity with which\r\nthe poison acts, and the consequent improbability that in practice any\r\nsuch antidote can be administered in time. It has lately been shown,\r\nhowever, by Messrs. T. and H. Smith of this city, that the effects of a\r\nfatal dose may be warded off by the timely administration of the\r\nreagents necessary for converting the acid into Prussian blue. They\r\nfound that if a solution of carbonate of potash followed by a solution\r\nof the mixed sulphates of iron be given to animals very soon after the\r\nadministration of a dose of thirty drops of the Edinburgh medicinal\r\nacid, containing three per cent. of real acid, recovery in general takes\r\nplace, and sometimes little inconvenience seems to be sustained. The\r\nsolutions they used were one of 144 grains of carbonate of potash in two\r\nounces of water, and another composed of a drachm and a half of sulphate\r\nof protoxide of iron, together with two drachms of the same salt\r\nconverted into sulphate of sesquioxide by means of sulphuric and nitric\r\nacids in the usual way. About 52 minims of each of these solutions will\r\nremove the whole acid contained in 100 grains of the Edinburgh medicinal\r\nacid; but for certainty, three or four times as much should be\r\nused,—which may be done with perfect safety.[1953]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, it appears that the proper treatment of a case of\r\npoisoning with hydrocyanic acid consists in the cold affusion applied to\r\nthe head and spine, the inhalation of diluted ammonia or chlorine,\r\nvenesection at the jugular vein, and the administration of carbonate of\r\npotash and the mixed sulphates of iron, if aid has been obtained in good\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt is right to remember, however, that on account of the dreadful\r\nrapidity of this variety of poisoning, it will rarely be in the\r\nphysician’s power to resort to any treatment soon enough for\r\nsuccess;—and farther, that his chance of success must generally be\r\nfeeble even though the case be taken in time, because when hydrocyanic\r\nacid is swallowed by man, the dose is commonly so large as not to be\r\ncounteracted by any remedies.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _On the Vegetable Substances which contain Hydrocyanic Acid._\r\n\r\nHydrocyanic acid exists in several plants; which are consequently\r\npoisonous. I have considered it advisable to describe their effects\r\nseparately from those of the pure acid.\r\n\r\nThe plants which have been thoroughly examined and found to yield it\r\nbelong chiefly to the division _Drupaceæ_, of Decandolle’s Natural\r\nFamily the _Rosaceæ_. These are the bitter almond, cherry-laurel,\r\nbird-cherry, and peach. The leaves and seeds of the nectarine and\r\napricot, and the seeds of the plum and cherry, have the same taste with\r\nthese four, and therefore will certainly be found to contain the acid\r\nalso. The same inference may be drawn from the taste of some pomaceous\r\nseeds; and accordingly I have obtained a hydrocyanated oil from the\r\nseeds of the New York pippin, and those of the white-beam-tree, the\r\n_Pyrus aria_. The poison procured from these sources exists in two\r\nforms,—as a distilled water, and as an essential oil. Further, the acid\r\nhas been discovered to constitute the active poison of the juice of the\r\n_Janipha manihot_, or bitter cassava [see p. 457].\r\n\r\nThe distilled waters yield hydrocyanic acid, as is shown by the blue\r\nprecipitate they give with potass and the mixed sulphates of iron. They\r\nhave a powerful, peculiar, grateful odour, which is usually likened to\r\nthat of pure hydrocyanic acid. But the smell really bears very little\r\nresemblance to that of hydrocyanic acid, and is not owing to its\r\npresence: the odour remains equally strong after the acid is thrown down\r\nby the test now mentioned. The active part of the distilled water may be\r\nseparated in the form of a volatile oil. This is colourless at first,\r\nafterwards yellowish or reddish, acrid, bitter, heavier than water, and\r\nvery volatile. The essential oil of the bitter almond has been carefully\r\nexamined by various chemists. Vogel, by subjecting it twice to\r\ndistillation from caustic potass, procured hydrocyanate of potass in the\r\nresidue; and a volatile oil was distilled over, which no longer\r\ncontained hydrocyanic acid, but nevertheless had the odour of the\r\noriginal oil.[1954] This purified oil he considered equally poisonous\r\nwith that which contains hydrocyanic acid, a single drop of it having\r\nkilled a sparrow; and his opinion was confirmed by the experiments of\r\nProfessor Orfila. But according to some careful experiments by\r\nStange,[1955] which have been amply confirmed by Dr. Göppert of\r\nBreslau,[1956] and also by MM. Robiquet and Boutron-Charlard,[1957]—if\r\nthe purified oil retains active poisonous properties, this must be owing\r\nto the acid not having been entirely removed. Göppert in particular\r\nremarked that twenty-five drops of the purified bitter-almond oil,\r\ncherry-laurel oil, or bird-cherry oil had very little effect on rabbits,\r\nnot more indeed than the same quantity of the common essential oils. The\r\npurified oil, according to all these chemists, possesses the odour of\r\nthe original oil, as Vogel first stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Of the Bitter Almond._\r\n\r\nThe bitter almond was once extensively used in medicine, and is still\r\nmuch employed by confectioners for flavouring puddings, sweetmeats, and\r\nliqueurs. It is the kernel of the fruit of the _Amygdalus communis_.\r\nThis species has two varieties, the _dulcis_ and the _amara_; which\r\ndiffer from one another in the fruit only. The fruit of the former\r\nyields the sweet, and of the latter the bitter almond. The bitter almond\r\nis the smaller of the two. The two plants, according to Murray, are\r\nconvertible into each other,—the sweet variety becoming bitter by\r\nneglect,—the bitter becoming sweet by cultivation, or certain modes of\r\nmanagement not well known,—and the seed of either variety producing\r\nplants of both.[1958] These statements as to the mutual convertibility\r\nof the two varieties require confirmation.\r\n\r\nThe bitter almond depends for its activity on the essential oil, which\r\nis common to all the vegetable poisons belonging to the present tribe.\r\nAccording to the researches of Robiquet and Boutron-Charlard, followed\r\nup by Liebig, the oil does not, like common essential oils, exist ready\r\nformed in the almond, but is only produced when the almond-pulp comes in\r\ncontact with water. It cannot be separated by any process whatever from\r\nthe almond without the co-operation of water,—neither, for example, by\r\npressing out the fixed oil, nor by the action of ether, nor by the\r\naction of absolute alcohol. After the almond is exhausted by ether, the\r\nremaining pulp gives the essential oil as soon as it is moistened; but\r\nif it is also exhausted by alcohol, the essential oil is entirely lost.\r\nThe reason is that alcohol dissolves out a peculiar crystalline\r\nprinciple, named amygdalin, which, with the co-operation of water, forms\r\nthe essential oil by reacting on a variety of the albuminous principle\r\nin the almond, called emulsion or synoptase.\r\n\r\nIn some respects, therefore, the essential oil of almonds is quite\r\npeculiar in its nature, and quite different from the common essential or\r\nvolatile oils.—The presence of hydrocyanic acid in it is easily proved\r\nby dissolving it with agitation in water, and treating the solution with\r\ncaustic potass, followed by the mixed sulphates of iron and sulphuric\r\nacid.—The quantity of essential oil which may be procured from the\r\nbitter almond amounts, according to Krüger of Rostock, to four drachms\r\nfrom five pounds or a ninety-sixth part.[1959] The quantity of\r\nhydrocyanic acid in the oil varies considerably: Schrader got from an\r\nold sample 8·5 per cent., from a new sample 10·75;[1960] but Göppert got\r\nfrom another specimen so much as 14·33 per cent.[1961]\r\n\r\n_Effects on Animals._—The bitter almond is a powerful poison, which acts\r\nin the same way as hydrocyanic acid, but likewise excites at times\r\nvomiting and other signs of irritation. The first good experiments on it\r\nare those related in Wepfer’s treatise on the Cicuta; but its properties\r\nseem to have been known even to Dioscorides. The symptoms it induces in\r\nanimals are trembling, weakness, palsy, convulsions, often of the\r\ntetanic kind, and finally coma. But frequently it occasions vomiting\r\nbefore these symptoms begin, and the animal in that way may\r\nescape.[1962] According to Orfila, twenty almonds will kill a dog in six\r\nhours by the stomach if the gullet be tied; and six will kill it in four\r\ndays when applied to a wound.[1963]\r\n\r\nThe essential oil is not much inferior in activity to the pure\r\nhydrocyanic acid. A single drop of it applied by Sir B. Brodie on the\r\ntongue of a cat caused violent convulsions and death in five\r\nminutes.[1964] But more generally a larger dose, or about seven drops,\r\nhas been found necessary to kill a middle-sized dog. Five drops,\r\naccording to Göppert, will kill a rabbit in six minutes. When entirely\r\nfreed of hydrocyanic acid, it becomes, as already mentioned, not more\r\npoisonous than common volatile oils.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Man._—The effects of the almond and of the oil upon man are\r\nequally striking with those of hydrocyanic acid.\r\n\r\nIn small doses the bitter almond produces disorder of the digestive\r\norgans, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes diarrhœa. These symptoms are\r\noccasionally brought on by the small quantities used for flavouring\r\nsweetmeats, if the confectioner has not been careful in compounding\r\nthem. Virey says that accidents occasionally happen to children at Paris\r\nfrom their eating freely of macaroons, which are sometimes too strongly\r\nflavoured with the bitter almond.[1965] In this country accidents from\r\nthe same cause may be with justice apprehended, as confectioners now\r\ngenerally use, not the bitter almond, but its essential oil, which is\r\ndistilled for the purpose in London, and sold in the druggists shops\r\nunder the name of peach-nut oil. Göppert suggests that this oil ought to\r\nbe freed of its hydrocyanic acid by repeated distillation with caustic\r\npotassa, because the flavour is not in the least injured by the process,\r\nwhile its activity as a poison is greatly lessened.\r\n\r\nIn peculiar constitutions the minutest quantity, even a single almond,\r\nwill cause a state resembling intoxication, succeeded by an eruption\r\nlike nettle-rash. The late Dr. Gregory was subject to be affected in\r\nthis way. Other vegetable bitters had the same effect on him, but none\r\nso remarkably as bitter almonds. They caused first sickness, generally\r\ntremors, then vomiting, next a hot fit with an eruption of urticaria,\r\nparticularly on the upper part of the body. At the same time the face,\r\nand head swelled very much, and there was generally a feeling like\r\nintoxication. The symptoms lasted only for a few hours. The rash did not\r\nalternately appear and disappear as in common nettle-rash.[1966] A lady\r\nof my acquaintance is liable to be attacked with urticaria even from\r\neating the sweet almond.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of bitter almonds which may be eaten with impunity is\r\nunknown; but Wibmer mentions an experimentalist who took half an ounce\r\nwithout any other effect besides headache and sickness.[1967] Two cases\r\nof death in the human subject from eating them have been quoted by\r\nCoullon from the Journal de Médecine of Montpellier. One is a doubtful\r\ncase, but the other is unequivocal. A bath-woman gave her child the\r\n“expressed juice” of a handful of bitter almonds to cure worms. The\r\nchild, who was four years old, was immediately attacked with colic,\r\nswelling of the belly, giddiness, locked jaw, frothing at the mouth,\r\ngeneral convulsions, and insensibility, and died in two hours.[1968]\r\nMurray, however, asserts in his Apparatus Medicaminum that the expressed\r\njuice is sweet and not poisonous.[1969] But this apparent contradiction\r\nis easily explained by referring to the chemical relations of the\r\nalmond,—the oil expressed without water being free from essential oil,\r\nwhile the milky fluid expressed from the pulp beat up with water is\r\nstrongly impregnated with it.—Another case was published not long ago by\r\nMr. Kennedy of London; but the symptoms were imperfectly ascertained.\r\nThe person, a stout labourer, appeared to have eaten a great quantity of\r\nbitter almonds, which were subsequently found in the stomach. He was\r\nseen to drop down while standing near a wall; soon after which the\r\nsurgeon who was sent for found him quite insensible, with the pulse\r\nimperceptible, and the breath exhaling the odour of bitter almonds; and\r\ndeath took place in no long time.[1970]\r\n\r\nCoullon has noticed many other instances where alarming symptoms were\r\nproduced by this poison, but were dissipated by the supervention of\r\nspontaneous vomiting.\r\n\r\nThe effects of small doses of the oil have been tried by Sir B. Brodie\r\non himself; and a fatal case of poisoning with it has been recorded by\r\nMertzdorff. In the course of his experiments Sir B. Brodie once happened\r\nto touch his tongue with the end of a glass rod which happened to be\r\ndipped in the oil; and he says he had scarcely done so before he felt an\r\nuneasy, indescribable feeling in the pit of the stomach, great\r\nfeebleness of his limbs, and loss of power to direct the muscles, so\r\nthat he could hardly keep himself from falling. These sensations were\r\nquite momentary.[1971]\r\n\r\nMertzdorff’s case is interesting, not only as being accurately related,\r\nbut likewise on account of the exact resemblance of the symptoms to\r\nthose observed in the celebrated case of Sir Theodosius Boughton, which\r\nwill presently be mentioned. A hypochondriacal gentleman, 48 years old,\r\nswallowed two drachms of the essential oil. A few minutes afterwards,\r\nhis servant, whom he sent for, found him lying in bed, with his features\r\nspasmodically contracted, his eyes fixed, staring, and turned upwards,\r\nand his chest heaving convulsively and hurriedly. A physician, who\r\nentered the room twenty minutes after the draught had been taken, found\r\nhim quite insensible, the pupils immoveable, the breathing stertorous\r\nand slow, the pulse feeble and only 30 in a minute, and the breath\r\nstrongly impregnated with the odour of bitter almonds, death ensued ten\r\nminutes afterwards.[1972] A fatal case occurred lately in London, where\r\nthe individual, intending to compound a nostrum for worms with beech-nut\r\noil, got by mistake from the druggist peach-nut oil, which is nothing\r\nelse than the oil of bitter almond.—A singular case of recovery from a\r\nvery large dose of this poison has been lately published by M. Chevasse.\r\nA shopkeeper, who swallowed half an ounce by mistake for spirit of\r\nnitric ether, had an attack of spontaneous vomiting, which was forthwith\r\nencouraged by sulphate of zinc. He nevertheless became pale and\r\nconvulsed; the pulse disappeared; and delirious muttering ensued, with\r\n_risus sardonicus_, sparkling of the eyes, and panting respiration.\r\nRecovery, however, took place under the use of brandy and ammonia.[1973]\r\n\r\nThe morbid appearances are the same as in poisoning with the pure acid.\r\nIn Mertzdorff’s case the whole blood and body emitted a smell of\r\nalmonds; putrefaction had begun, though the inspection was made\r\ntwenty-nine hours after death; the blood throughout was fluid, and\r\nflowed from the nostrils and mouth; the veins were every where turgid;\r\nthe cerebral vessels gorged; the stomach and intestines very red.—In the\r\ncase from the Medical and Physical Journal of poisoning with the almond\r\nitself, the vessels of the brain were much gorged, and the eyes\r\nglistening and staring as if the person had been alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Of the Cherry-Laurel._\r\n\r\nThe cherry-laurel, or _Cerasus lauro-cerasus_, was at one time much used\r\nfor flavouring liqueurs and sweetmeats. But it is now less employed than\r\nformerly, as fatal accidents have happened from its having been used in\r\ntoo large quantity. The custom, however, has not been altogether\r\nabandoned; for there is an account in an English newspaper in 1823 of\r\ntwo persons killed by ratifia’d brandy, which had been flavoured with\r\nthis plant; and Dr. Paris has mentioned an instance of several children\r\nat an English boarding-school having been dangerously affected by a\r\ncustard flavoured with the leaves.[1974] Almost every part of the plant\r\nis poisonous, especially the leaves and kernels; but the pulp of the\r\ncherry is not. The flower has a totally different odour from the leaves.\r\nThe healthy vigorous shoots in the early part of summer, and the inner\r\nbark, both then and in autumn, smell strongly of the bitter almond when\r\nbroken across. The kernels of the seeds have a strong taste of bitter\r\nalmonds.—The plant yields a distilled water and an essential oil, which\r\nRobiquet found to have all the chemical properties of the oil of bitter\r\nalmond.[1975]—A very peculiar source of danger in using the leaves of\r\nthis plant, for imparting a ratafia flavour to sweetmeats and liqueurs,\r\nis that the proportion of oil varies excessively according to the age of\r\nthe leaf. It abounds most in the young undeveloped leaves, and\r\ndiminishes gradually afterwards. Hence, the leaves being evergreen and\r\noutliving more than two summers, the young leaves in May or June\r\ncontain, as I have found, nearly ten times as much oil as the old ones\r\nat the same moment.\r\n\r\nCherry-laurel oil, according to Schrader, contains 7·66 per cent. of\r\nhydrocyanic acid;[1976] but according to Göppert, a specimen supposed to\r\nbe genuine gave only 2·75 per cent.[1977] It is probably therefore a\r\nweaker poison than the oil of bitter almond. The latest experiments made\r\nwith this oil are those of some Florentine physicians, performed at the\r\nlaboratory of the Marquess Rodolphi, and described by Professor\r\nTaddei.[1978] Sixteen drops put on the tongue of rabbits killed them in\r\nnine, fifteen, or twenty minutes; and ten or twelve drops injected in\r\noil into the anus killed them in four minutes. The symptoms were slow\r\nbreathing, palsy of the hind-legs, then general convulsions; and death\r\nwas preceded by complete coma. A very extraordinary appearance was found\r\nin the dead body,—blood extravasated abundantly in the trachea and\r\nlungs.\r\n\r\nThe cherry-laurel water, prepared by distillation from the leaves of\r\nthis plant, was long the most important of the poisons which contain the\r\nhydrocyanic acid, as it was the most common before the introduction of\r\nthe acid itself into medical practice. Water dissolves by agitation 3·25\r\ngrains of oil per ounce; which may be considered the proportion in a\r\nsaturated distilled water. The water contains, according to Schubarth,\r\nonly 0·25 per cent. of hydrocyanic acid;[1979] according to\r\nSchrader[1980] only half as much; and by long keeping even that small\r\nproportion will gradually disappear, as I have ascertained by\r\nexperiment. Hence its strength must vary greatly,—a fact which will\r\nexplain the very different effects of the same dose in different\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments on animals by a great number of observers, it appears\r\nthat, whether it is introduced into the stomach, or into the anus, or\r\ninto the cellular tissue, or directly into a vein, it occasions\r\ngiddiness, palsy, insensibility, convulsions, coma, and speedy\r\ndeath;—that the tetanic state brought on by the pure acid, is not always\r\nso distinctly caused by cherry-laurel water;—and that tetanus is most\r\nfrequently induced by medium doses.\r\n\r\nThe attention of physicians was first called to this poison by an\r\naccount, published by Dr. Madden in the Philosophical Transactions for\r\n1737, of several accidents which occurred at Dublin in consequence of\r\nstrong ratifia’d brandy having been prepared with it. Foderé has also\r\ngiven an account of two cases, caused by servants having stolen and\r\ndrunk a bottle of it, which they mistook for a cordial.[1981] Being\r\nafraid of detection, they swallowed it quickly, and in a few minutes\r\nexpired in convulsions. Murray has noticed several others in his\r\nApparatus Medicaminum.[1982] In most of these cases the individuals\r\nsuddenly lost their speech, fell down insensible, and died in a few\r\nminutes. Convulsions do not appear to have been frequent. Coullon has\r\nalso related an instance where a child seems to have been killed by the\r\nleaves applied to a large sore on the neck.[1983]\r\n\r\nThe dose required to occasion these effects, and more especially to\r\nprove fatal, has not been determined with care. It must vary with the\r\nage of the sample used. It will vary also according as the water has\r\nbeen filtered or not; for what is not filtered often presents\r\nundissolved oil suspended in it or floating on its surface. One ounce\r\nhas proved fatal;[1984] and half an ounce has caused only temporary\r\ngiddiness, loss of power over the limbs, stupor, and sense of pressure\r\nin the stomach.[1985]\r\n\r\nThe appearances found in the dead body have varied. In general the blood\r\nhas been fluid. The smell of bitter almond has commonly been distinct in\r\nthe stomach.\r\n\r\nThe cherry-laurel water has attracted much attention in this country, in\r\nconsequence of being the poison used by Captain Donnellan for the murder\r\nof Sir Theodosius Boughton. The trial of Donnellan, the most important\r\ntrial for poisoning which ever took place in Britain, has given rise to\r\nsome discrepance of opinion both among barristers and medical men, as to\r\nthe sufficiency of the evidence by which the prisoner was\r\ncondemned.[1986] For my part, taking into account the general, as well\r\nas medical circumstances of the case, I do not entertain a doubt of his\r\nguilt.\r\n\r\nLeaving the general evidence out of view, however, as foreign to the\r\nobjects of the medical jurist’s regard, it must be admitted that the\r\nmedical evidence, taken by itself, was defective. It may be summed up\r\nshortly in the following terms:—Sir Theodosius was a young man of the\r\nage of twenty, and in perfect health, except that he had a slight\r\nvenereal complaint of old standing, for which he occasionally took a\r\nlaxative draught. On the morning of his death, his mother, Lady\r\nBoughton, remarked, while giving him his draught, that it had a strong\r\nsmell of bitter almonds. Two minutes after he took it, she observed a\r\nrattling or gurgling in his stomach; in ten minutes more he seemed\r\ninclined to doze; and five minutes afterwards she found him quite\r\ninsensible, with the eyes fixed upwards, the teeth locked, froth running\r\nout of his mouth, and a great heaving at his stomach and gurgling in his\r\nthroat. He died within half an hour after swallowing the draught. The\r\nbody was examined ten days after death, and the inspectors found great\r\ncongestion of the veins every where, gorging of the lungs, and redness\r\nof the stomach. But the examination was unskilfully conducted. For the\r\nhead was not opened; the fæces were allowed to rush from the intestines\r\ninto the stomach; and, as a great quantity of fluid blood was found in\r\neach cavity of the chest, the subclavian veins must have been divided\r\nduring the separation of the clavicles. Very little reliance, therefore,\r\ncan be placed in the evidence from the inspection of the body.[1987]\r\n\r\nOn comparing these particulars with what has been said above regarding\r\nthe effects of hydrocyanic acid and this whole genus of poisons, it will\r\nbe seen that every circumstance coincides precisely with the supposition\r\nof poisoning with the cherry-laurel water. The symptoms were exactly the\r\nsame as in Mertzdoff’s case of poisoning with the essential oil of\r\nalmonds (p. 604). When to this are added, the smell of the draught,\r\nwhich Lady Boughton could hardly mistake, the rarity of apoplexy in so\r\nyoung and healthy a person as Sir Theodosius, and the improbability of\r\neither that or any other disease of the head proving fatal so\r\nquickly,—the conclusion at which, in my opinion, every sound medical\r\njurist must arrive is, that poisoning in the way supposed was very\r\nprobable. But I cannot go along with those who think that it was\r\ncertain; nor is it possible to see on what grounds such an opinion can\r\nbe founded, when the general or moral circumstances are excluded.\r\n\r\nThe medical evidence in Donnellan’s case has been much canvassed, and\r\nespecially that of Mr. John Hunter. It would be foreign to the plan\r\nhitherto pursued in this work to analyze and review what was said by him\r\nand his brethren. But I must frankly observe, that Mr. Hunter’s evidence\r\ndoes him very little credit, and that his high professional eminence is\r\nthe reverse of a reason for palliating his errors, or treating them with\r\nthe lenity which they have experienced from his numerous critics.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _Of the Peach, Cluster-Cherry, Mountain-Ash, &c._\r\n\r\nLittle need be said of the other plants formerly mentioned among those\r\nwhich yield hydrocyanic acid, and act on the system in consequence of\r\ncontaining that substance.\r\n\r\nThe _Amygdalus persica_ or peach is the most active of them. Most parts\r\nof the plant exhale the odour of the bitter-almond, but particularly the\r\nflowers and kernels. According to the chemical researches of M.\r\nGauthier, the fresh young shoots of the peach collected in July contain,\r\nweight for weight, even more essential oil than the bitter almond, or\r\ncherry-laurel leaves; for 250 grains yielded nearly five grains of it or\r\ntwo per cent.; and he found the oil may be easily procured by distilling\r\nthe shoots without addition till the product begins to pass over\r\nclear.[1988] The kernels of the peach, when distilled with water, yield\r\nnearly one grain of hydrocyanic acid per ounce.[1989]\r\n\r\nCoullon has collected two instances of poisoning with the peach-blossom.\r\nOne is the case of an elderly gentleman, who swallowed a sallad of the\r\nflower to purge himself. Soon afterwards he was seized with giddiness,\r\nviolent purging, convulsions, and stupor; and he died in three days.\r\nHere the poison must have proved fatal by inducing true apoplexy in a\r\npredisposed habit; at least poisoning with hydrocyanic acid never lasts\r\nnearly so long. The other, a child eighteen months old, after taking a\r\ndecoction of the flowers to destroy worms, perished with frightful\r\nconvulsions, efforts to vomit, and bloody diarrhœa.[1990] The\r\npeach-blossom would therefore appear to be rather a narcotico-acrid,\r\nthan a narcotic.—Peach-leaves are represented to have produced even\r\npurely irritant effects. A man, who took a decoction of a handful boiled\r\nin a quart of water down to a third,—when of course no hydrocyanic acid\r\ncould remain,—was attacked with tightness in the chest, a sense of\r\nsuffocation, violent colic, pain in the stomach and frequent desire to\r\nvomit, followed by a hard pulse, restlessness, and flushing of the face.\r\nBut he recovered slowly under the use of fomentations and opiates.[1991]\r\n\r\nThe bark of the _Prunus padus_, or cluster-cherry, a native of this\r\ncountry, owes its poisonous qualities to the same substance as the\r\npreceding plants. Heumann found that the distilled water obtained from\r\ntwo ounces of bark in March contains two grains of acid, two ounces of\r\ndeveloped leaves half a grain, and two ounces of the seed a trifle\r\nless.[1992] Its distilled water has the odour of bitter almonds,\r\ncontains the same essential oil with that of the bitter almond, and\r\nyields more hydrocyanic acid than the cherry-laurel water.[1993] The\r\noil, according to Schrader, contains 9·25[1994] per cent. of hydrocyanic\r\nacid, according to Göppert only 5·5 per cent.[1995] Bremer, who has\r\nexamined this plant with great care, found that both the distilled water\r\nand the essential oil kill mice when put into the mouth, eye, nose, ear,\r\nanus, or a wound; and that half an ounce of the water killed a dog in\r\ntwelve minutes.[1996] The fruit is also poisonous. It has a nauseous\r\ntaste, but communicates a pleasant flavour to spirituous liquors. The\r\nkernels yield by expression a transparent, fixed oil, concrete at 41°\r\nF., which contains a small quantity of the essential oil; and the cake\r\nwhich is left yields so much of the latter, that, as we are informed by\r\nM. Chancel of Briançon, a handful has proved fatal to cows in a short\r\ntime.[1997] In these kernels, as in the bitter almond, the essential oil\r\ndoes not exist ready formed, but is developed only in consequence of the\r\ncontact of water; and hence, if the fixed oil by expression contains a\r\nlittle of it, as Chancel says, this must arise from the kernels having\r\nbeen moist when squeezed.\r\n\r\nThe _Sorbus aucuparia_, mountain-ash, or Rowan-tree as it is called in\r\nScotland, has been lately added to the list of plants which abound in\r\nthe same poisonous principle. M. Grassmann of St Petersburgh has found\r\nthat many parts of this tree, such as the flowers and the bark of the\r\ntrunk and branches, contain more or less of the peculiar essential oil;\r\nand that the root in particular contains so much in the month of May as\r\nto smell strongly of it when broken across, and to yield a distilled\r\nwater which holds fully as much hydrocyanic acid as that procured from\r\nan equal weight of cherry-laurel leaves.[1998]\r\n\r\nSeveral other plants of the same natural order possess similar though\r\nweaker properties, such as the _Prunus avium_, or black-cherry, or\r\nmazzard, the _Prunus insititia_, or bullace, the _Prunus spinosa_, or\r\nsloe, the _Amygdalus nana_, or dwarf-almond, and even the leaves and\r\nkernels of the common cherry, the _Cerasus communis_. Twelve ounces of\r\ncherry kernels distilled with water, yield, according to Geiseler, seven\r\ngrains of hydrocyanic acid.[1999] I have no doubt, from my experiments,\r\nthat the seeds of _Pyrus malus_, the apple, _Pyrus aria_, the\r\nwhite-beam, and also, if the taste may be taken for a criterion, the\r\nwhole seeds of the _Pomaceæ_, yield by distillation with water a large\r\nquantity of hydrocyanic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX.\r\n                   OF POISONING WITH CARBAZOTIC ACID.\r\n\r\n\r\nA substance long known to chemists by the name of indigo-bitter, which\r\nis procured by the action of nitric acid on indigo, silk, and other\r\nazotized substances, and which has been found to consist chiefly of a\r\npeculiar acid, termed by Liebig, from its composition, the carbazotic\r\nacid, appears to be a pure narcotic poison of considerable\r\nactivity.[2000] It is in the form of shining crystals, of an excessively\r\nbitter taste, and of a yellow colour so singularly intense that it\r\nimparts a perceptible tint to a million parts of water. The pure\r\ncrystals are composed of carbon, azote, and oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe only account I have seen of the physiological properties of this\r\nsubstance is a full analysis by Buchner in his Toxicology, of some\r\ninteresting experiments by Professor Rapp of Tübingen.[2001] He found\r\nthat sixteen grains in solution, when introduced into the stomach,\r\nkilled a fox, ten grains a dog, and five grains a rabbit, in an hour and\r\na half; that the injection of a watery solution into the windpipe\r\noccasioned death in a few minutes; that the introduction of it into the\r\ncavity of the pleura or peritonæum occasioned death in several hours;\r\nthat a watery solution of ten grains injected into the jugular vein of a\r\nfox killed it instantaneously, and in like manner five grains affected a\r\ndog in three minutes and killed it in twenty-four hours; and that thirty\r\ngrains applied to a wound killed a rabbit. The symptoms remarked from\r\nits introduction into the stomach of the fox were in half an hour\r\ntremors, grinding of the teeth, constant contortion of the eyes and\r\nconvulsions, in an hour complete insensibility, and death in half an\r\nhour more. In the dog there was also remarked an attack of vomiting and\r\nfeebleness of the pulse.\r\n\r\nIn the dead body no particular alteration of structure was remarked. The\r\nheart, examined immediately after death from the introduction of the\r\npoison into the stomach, was found much gorged and motionless; but the\r\nirritability of the voluntary muscles remained. The stomach was not\r\ninflamed, but dyed yellow. A very interesting appearance was dyeing of\r\nvarious textures and fluids throughout the body. In the fox killed by\r\nswallowing sixteen grains the conjunctiva of the eyes, the aqueous\r\nhumour, the capsule of the lens, the membranes of the arteries, in a\r\nless degree those of the veins, the lungs, and in many places the\r\ncellular tissue, had acquired a lemon-yellow colour. The dog killed in\r\nthe same manner presented similar appearances, also those killed by\r\ninjection of the poison into the pleura or peritonæum; and in the latter\r\nanimals the urine was tinged yellow. In a rabbit killed by the\r\napplication of the poison to a wound the same discoloration was also\r\nevery where remarked, together with yellowness of the fibrin of the\r\nblood. But no yellowness could be seen any where in the dog, which died\r\nin twenty-four hours after receiving five grains into the jugular vein.\r\nIn no instance was there any yellow tint perceptible in the brain or\r\nspinal cord.\r\n\r\nThese facts form an interesting addition to the physiology of poisons.\r\nThey supply unequivocal proof that this substance is absorbed in the\r\ncourse of its operation, and furnish strong presumption that other\r\npoisons, which act on organs remote from the place where they are\r\napplied, and which have been sought for without success in the blood, as\r\nwell as in other fluids and solids throughout the body, have not been\r\ndetected, merely because the physiologist does not possess such simple\r\nand extremely delicate means of searching for them.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Professor Rapp have been arranged under the title of\r\ncarbazotic acid, because this acid forms the most prominent substance in\r\nthe matter with which his experiments appear to have been made. But it\r\nis right to state, that the article actually used was, if I understand\r\ncorrectly the abstract given by Buchner, not the pure crystals, but the\r\nyellow fluid, from which the crystals are procured, and which contains\r\nalso a resinous matter and artificial tannin.—The bitter principle of\r\nWelther produced by the action of nitric acid on silk, and that formed\r\nby Braconnot by the action of the same acid on aloes, appear to be\r\nimpure carbazotic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n                        OF THE POISONOUS GASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of the poisonous gases is one of great importance in\r\nrelation to medical police, as well as medical jurisprudence. They are\r\nobjects of interest to the medical jurist, because their effects may be\r\nmistaken for those of criminal violence, and because they have even been\r\nresorted to for committing suicide. They are interesting as a topic of\r\nmedical police, since some trades expose the workmen to their influence.\r\n\r\nIt has hitherto been chiefly on the continent that use has been made of\r\nthe deleterious gases for the purpose of self-destruction. Osiander\r\nmentions, that Lebrun, a famous player on the horn, suffocated himself\r\nat Paris in 1809 with the fumes of sulphur; and that an apothecary at\r\nPyrmont killed himself by going into the _Grotto del Cane_ there, which,\r\nlike that near Naples, is filled with carbonic acid gas.[2002] Many\r\ninstances have lately occurred in France of suicide caused by the\r\nemanations from burning charcoal in a close chamber.\r\n\r\nBut these poisons come under the notice of the medical jurist chiefly\r\nbecause their effects may be mistaken for those of other kinds of\r\nviolent death. Several mistakes of this nature are on record. Zacchias\r\nmentions the case of a man, who was found dead in prison under\r\ncircumstances which led to the suspicion, that he had been privately\r\nstrangled by the governor. But Zacchias proved this to be impossible,\r\nand ascribed death to the fumes from a choffer of burning charcoal left\r\nin the room.[2003] A more striking instance of the kind occurred a few\r\nyears ago at London. A woman, who inhabited a room with other five\r\npeople, alarmed the neighbours one morning with the intelligence that\r\nall her fellow-lodgers were dead. On entering the room they found two\r\nmen and two women actually dead, and another man quite insensible and\r\napparently dying. This man, however, recovered; and as it was said that\r\nhe was too intimate with the woman who gave the alarm, a report was\r\nspread that she had poisoned the rest, to get rid of the man’s wife, one\r\nof the sufferers. She was accordingly put in prison, various articles in\r\nthe house were carefully analysed for poison, and an account of the\r\nsupposed barbarous murder was hawked about the streets. At last the man\r\nwho recovered remembered having put a choffer of coals between the two\r\nbeds, which held the whole six people; and the chamber having no vent,\r\nthey had thus been all suffocated.[2004]—The following is a similar\r\naccident not less remarkable in its circumstances. Four people in\r\n_Gerolzhofen_ in Bavaria, were found one morning in bed, some dead,\r\nothers comatose; and only one recovered. A neighbour who had supped with\r\nthem, but slept at home, did not suffer. The stomach and intestines were\r\nfound very red and black; and the coats of the stomach brittle. The\r\ncontents of the stomach, the remains of their supper, and the wine were\r\nanalysed without any suspicious substance being found. A little smoke\r\nhaving been noticed in the room by those who first entered it, the stove\r\nand fuel were examined, but without furnishing any insight into the\r\ncause of the accident. At last the cellar was examined, and then it was\r\nfound that one of the sufferers had heated a copper vessel there so\r\nincautiously, that the fire communicated with the unplastered planks of\r\nthe floor above. The planks had burnt with a low smothered flame, and\r\nthe vapours passed through the crevices in the floor.[2005]\r\n\r\n\r\n                _What Irrespirable Gases are Poisonous?_\r\n\r\nSome gases act negatively on the animal system by preventing the access\r\nof respirable air to the lungs; others are positively poisonous. The\r\nfirst point, therefore, is to ascertain which are negatively, and which\r\npositively hurtful.\r\n\r\nM. Nysten, who has made the most connected train of experiments on this\r\nsubject, conceived that a gas will not act through any other channel\r\nbesides the lungs, if it exerts merely a negative action:—and that, on\r\nthe contrary, it certainly possesses a direct and positive power, if it\r\nhas nearly the same effects, in whatever way it is introduced into the\r\nbody.[2006] He therefore thought the best way to ascertain the action of\r\nthe gases would be, to inject them into the blood,—conceiving that,\r\nafter allowance is made for the mere mechanical effects of an aëriform\r\nbody, the phenomena would point out the true operation of each.\r\n\r\nHis first object then was to learn what phenomena are caused by the\r\nmechanical action of atmospheric air. He found that four cubic inches\r\nand a half, injected into the jugular vein of a dog, killed it\r\nimmediately amidst tetanic convulsions, by distending the heart with\r\nfrothy blood;—that a larger quantity introduced, gradually caused more\r\nlingering death, with symptoms of oppressed breathing, which arose from\r\ngorging of the lungs with frothy blood;—and that a small quantity,\r\ninjected into the carotid artery towards the brain, occasioned speedy\r\ndeath by apoplexy, which arose from the brain being deprived by means of\r\nthe air of a due supply of its proper stimulus, the blood. Numerous\r\nexperimental inquiries have been since made on this subject, the latest\r\nof which, those of Dr. Cormack, coincide with the first results of\r\nNysten, that air injected into the veins causes death by arrestment of\r\nthe action of the heart.[2007]\r\n\r\nProceeding with these data, Nysten found that _oxygen_ and _azote_ had\r\nthe same effect when apart, as when united in the form of atmospheric\r\nair; that _carburetted hydrogen_, _hydrogen_, _carbonic oxide_, and\r\n_phosphuretted hydrogen_ likewise seemed to act in the same way; and\r\nthat the _nitrous oxide_, or intoxicating gas, although it does not\r\ncause so much mechanical injury as the others, on account of its\r\nsuperior solubility in the blood, has the same effect when injected in\r\nsufficient quantity, and produces little or none of the symptoms of\r\nintoxication excited by it in man.[2008] As to _carbonic acid gas_, he\r\nfound that, on account of its great solubility in the blood, it is\r\ndifficult to produce mechanical injury with it; that sixty-four cubic\r\ninches are absorbed, and do not excite any particular symptoms; but that\r\nwhen injected into the carotid artery, it occasions death by apoplexy,\r\nalthough it is rapidly absorbed by the blood.[2009]\r\n\r\nThe other gases he tried were hydrosulphuric acid, nitric oxide, ammonia\r\nand chlorine; and all of these proved to be positively and highly\r\ndeleterious.\r\n\r\nTwo or three cubic inches of _hydrosulphuric acid gas_ caused tetanus\r\nand immediate death, when injected into the veins, although the gas was\r\nat once absorbed by the blood. The same quantity acted with almost equal\r\nrapidity when injected into the cavity of the chest. Similar results\r\nwere obtained when it was injected into the cellular tissue, or even\r\nwhen it was left for some time in contact with the sound skin.[2010] The\r\nlast important fact has been since confirmed by Lebküchner in his Thesis\r\non the permeability of the tissues;[2011] and it had previously been\r\nobserved also by the late Professor Chaussier, whose experiments will be\r\nmentioned presently (p. 617). In none of Nysten’s experiments with this\r\ngas was the blood changed in appearance.\r\n\r\n_Nitric oxide gas_, according to Nysten, is the most energetic of all\r\nthe poisonous gases. A very small quantity causes death by tetanus, when\r\nintroduced into a vein, the cavity of the chest, or the cellular tissue;\r\nand it always changes the state of the blood, giving it a\r\nchocolate-brown colour, and preventing its coagulation. In one of\r\nNysten’s experiments a cubic inch and three-quarters injected into the\r\nchest killed a little dog in 45 minutes.[2012] Dr. John Davy appears to\r\nhave found this gas not so active.[2013]\r\n\r\nNysten found the two other gases, _ammonia_ and _chlorine_, to be acrid\r\nin their action. When injected into the veins they kill by\r\nover-stimulating the heart; and when injected into the cavity of the\r\nchest, they excite inflammation in the lining membrane.[2014] Hébréart\r\nfarther remarked in his experiments relative to the action of irritants\r\non the windpipe, that chlorine when inspired, produces violent\r\ninflammation in the windpipe and its great branches, ending in the\r\nsecretion of a pseudo-membrane like that of croup;[2015] and that a very\r\nsmall quantity of ammonia has the same effect.\r\n\r\nFrom this abstract of Nysten’s researches, it appears to follow, that\r\nammonia and chlorine are irritants; hydrosulphuric acid and nitric\r\noxide, narcotics; oxygen, azote, hydrogen, carburetted hydrogen,\r\nphosphuretted hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and nitrous oxide, negative\r\npoisons; and carbonic acid, doubtful in its nature. Some of these\r\nconclusions do not correspond with the effects observed in man; which\r\nwill presently be found to lead to the inference, that not only carbonic\r\nacid, but likewise carbonic oxide, nitrous oxide, and carburetted\r\nhydrogen are narcotics. The reason Nysten did not find these gases\r\ninjurious was probably, that, before they could pass from the vein into\r\nwhich they were injected, to the brain on which they act, they were in a\r\ngreat measure exhaled from the lungs. The experiments of physiologists\r\nsince Nysten’s time likewise tend to show that oxygen gas is a positive\r\npoison when pure, and that even hydrogen possesses active properties.\r\nThe inquiries of Mr. Broughton led him to consider hydrogen a positive\r\npoison, because animals die in it in half a minute, and the heart\r\nimmediately after death is found to have lost its contractility.\r\nPrevious experimentalists had also remarked hypnotic effects from the\r\ninhalation of it diluted with oxygen.[2016] As to oxygen, the same\r\nphysiologist ascertained that when pure, it is a narcotic poison, though\r\na feeble one, as at least five hours of continuous respiration in the\r\npure gas are required to prove fatal.[2017]\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Of the Effects of the Poisonous Gases on Man._\r\n\r\nAccording to the effects of the poisonous gases on man, they may be\r\narranged in two groups, the first including the _irritants_, the second\r\nthe _narcotics_. It might have been therefore a more philosophical mode\r\nof arrangement, if the former had been considered under the irritant\r\nclass of poisons; but it is more convenient to examine the whole\r\ndeleterious gases together.\r\n\r\nThe _irritant gases_ are nitric oxide gas and nitrous acid vapour,\r\nhydrochloric acid gas, chlorine, ammonia, sulphurous acid, and some\r\nothers of little consequence.\r\n\r\n_Of Nitric oxide gas and Nitrous acid vapour._—Before nitric oxide gas\r\ncan be breathed in ordinary circumstances, it is transformed by the\r\noxygen of the air into nitrous acid vapour, of a ruddy colour and\r\nirritating odour. Hébréart found that in animals killed by inhaling it\r\nthe windpipe was much inflamed.[2018] Sir H. Davy tried to inhale it,\r\nand with this view took the precaution of previously breathing the\r\nnitrous oxide or intoxicating gas, in order to expel the atmospheric air\r\nas much as possible from his lungs. But he found that the small quantity\r\nof nitrous acid fumes formed with the remaining air was sufficient to\r\ncause a sense of burning in the throat, and at once stimulated the\r\nglottis to contract, so that none of the nitric oxide gas could pass\r\ninto the larynx. The subsequent entrance of the external air into the\r\nmouth, which Sir Humphrey unluckily had not provided for, was of course\r\nattended by the immediate formation of more acid fumes, by which his\r\ntongue, cheeks, and gums, were irritated and inflamed; and there is no\r\ndoubt, as Sir Humphrey himself remarks, that if he had succeeded in\r\ninhaling the nitric oxide gas, the same chemical change would have\r\nhappened in the lungs and excited pneumonia.[2019]\r\n\r\nThe following cases will prove that nitrous acid vapour, disengaged from\r\nthe fuming nitrous acid, is a very violent and dangerous poison when\r\ninhaled. A chemical manufacturer, in endeavouring to remove from his\r\nstore-room a hamper in which some bottles of nitrous acid had burst,\r\nbreathed the fumes for some time, and was seized in four hours with\r\nsymptoms of inflammation in the throat and stomach. At night the urine\r\nwas suppressed; the skin then became blue; at last he was seized with\r\nhiccup, acute pain in the diaphragm, convulsions, and delirium; and he\r\ndied twenty-seven hours after the accident.[2020] Another case has been\r\ndescribed in the Bulletins of the Medical Society of Emulation. It\r\nproved fatal in two days, and the symptoms were those of violent\r\npneumonia. In this instance there was pneumonia of one side, and\r\npleurisy of the other; the uvula and throat were gangrenous, and the\r\nwindpipe and air-tubes dark-red; the veins throughout the whole body\r\nwere much congested, the skin very livid in many places, and the blood\r\nfluid in the heart, but coagulated in the vessels.[2021] Dr. Reitz, a\r\nwriter in Henke’s Journal, met with two cases of death from the same\r\ncause in hatters. They had incautiously exposed themselves too much to\r\nthe fumes, which are disengaged during the preparation of nitrate of\r\nmercury for the operation of felting, and which are well known to be\r\nnitric oxide gas converted into nitrous acid vapour by contact with the\r\nair. Two men died of inflammation of the lungs excited in that manner;\r\nand a third, a boy of fourteen, after sleeping all night in an apartment\r\nwhere the mixture was effervescing, was attacked in the morning with\r\nyellowness of the skin, giddiness, and colic, which ended fatally in six\r\ndays.[2022]\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Chlorine._—The experiments of Nysten and Hébréart\r\nwith chlorine, and its well-known irritating effects when inhaled in the\r\nminutest quantities, show that it will produce inflammation of the lungs\r\nand air-passages. The following is the only instance of poisoning with\r\nit in man which has come under my notice. A young man, after breathing\r\ndiluted chlorine as an experiment, was instantly seized with violent\r\nirritation in the epiglottis, windpipe, and bronchial branches, cough,\r\ntightness, and sense of pressure in the chest, inability to swallow,\r\ngreat difficulty in breathing or articulating, discharge of mucus from\r\nthe mouth and nostrils, severe sneezing, swelling of the face, and\r\nprotrusion of the eyes. Ammonia was of no use; but singular relief was\r\nobtained from the inhalation of a little sulphuretted hydrogen, so that\r\nin an hour and a half he was tolerably well.[2023]\r\n\r\nAlthough this gas is very irritating to an unaccustomed person, yet by\r\nthe force of habit one may breathe with impunity an atmosphere much\r\nloaded with it. I have been told by a chemical manufacturer at Belfast,\r\nthat his men can work in an atmosphere of chlorine, where he himself\r\ncould not remain above a few minutes. The chief consequences of habitual\r\nexposure are acidity and other stomach complaints, which the men\r\ngenerally correct by taking chalk. He has likewise observed that they\r\nnever become corpulent, and that corpulent men who become workmen are\r\nsoon reduced to an ordinary size. It is not probable, however, that the\r\ntrade is an unhealthy one; for several of this gentleman’s workmen have\r\nlived to an advanced age; one man, who died not long ago at the age of\r\neighty, had been forty years in the manufactory; and I have seen in Mr.\r\nTenant’s manufactory at Glasgow a healthy-looking man who had been also\r\nabout forty years a workman there. It is an interesting fact, that\r\nduring the epidemic fever which raged over Ireland from 1816 to 1819,\r\nthe people at the manufactory at Belfast were exempt from it.\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Ammonia._—For an account of the effects of _ammonia_,\r\nwhich, when in the state of gas, acts violently as an irritant on the\r\nmouth, windpipe, and lungs, the reader is referred to the chapter on\r\nammonia and its salts in page 193. It appears to form one of the gases\r\ndisengaged from the soil of necessaries, as will be noticed presently,\r\nand excites inflammation in the eyes of workmen who are incautiously\r\nexposed to it.[2024]\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Hydrochloric Acid Gas._—I have not met with any\r\naccount of the effects of _hydrochloric acid gas_ on man. But no doubt\r\ncan be entertained that it will likewise act as a violent and pure\r\nirritant.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly hurtful to vegetable life. In the course of some\r\nexperiments performed in 1827 by Dr. Turner and myself on the effects of\r\nvarious gases on plants, we found that a tenth of a cubic inch diluted\r\nwith 20,000 times its volume of air, so as to be quite imperceptible to\r\nthe nostrils, shrivelled and killed all the leaves of various plants,\r\nwhich were exposed to it for twenty-four hours.[2025] These experiments\r\nwere repeated in 1832 by Messrs. Rogerson, apparently in ignorance of\r\nthem. Their results are on the whole the same; and the slighter effect\r\nobtained by them from minute proportions of the gas was evidently owing\r\nto the small size of their glass-jars not allowing them to use a\r\nsufficient quantity of it.[2026] They farther found that proportions of\r\nhydrochloric acid gas, amounting to a twentieth of the air, kill small\r\nanimals in half an hour with symptoms of obstructed respiration. Their\r\nexperiments with less proportions are not precise, yet warrant the\r\ninference that even a thousandth part of the gas will probably prove\r\nfatal in no long time.[2027]\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Hydrosulphuric Acid Gas._—The _narcotic gases_\r\nare of much greater importance than the irritants, on account of\r\nthe singularity of their effects, and the greater frequency of\r\naccidents with them. This group includes hydrosulphuric acid,\r\ncarburetted-hydrogen, carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, nitrous\r\noxide, cyanogen, and oxygen.\r\n\r\nHydrosulphuric acid gas is probably the most deleterious of all the\r\ngases. According to Thenard and Dupuytren, air containing only an 800th\r\nof it will kill small birds in a few seconds; and a 290th is sufficient\r\nto kill a dog; which, however, will sustain so much as a 400th.[2028]\r\nChaussier previously found, that a horse was killed by breathing\r\natmospheric air which contained a 250th of hydrosulphuric acid gas; and\r\nthat it acts with energy on animals, whether it be inhaled, or injected\r\ninto the stomach, anus, or cellular tissue, or even simply applied to\r\nthe skin. Nine quarts of the gas injected into the anus of a horse\r\nkilled it in one minute; and a rabbit, whose skin alone was exposed to\r\nit, died in ten minutes.[2029] Ulterior inquiries by MM.\r\nParent-Duchâtelet and Gaultier de Claubry,—scarcely so precise however\r\nas those of their predecessors,—appear to lead to the conclusion, that\r\nits energy is in some circumstances not so great. While superintending\r\nthe clearing out of some of the choked drains of Paris, they found that\r\nthe workmen suffered no harm, though they habitually breathed an\r\natmosphere containing from 25 to 80 ten-thousandths of hydrosulphuric\r\nacid gas, and on some occasions even so much as one per cent.; nay, on\r\none occasion Gaultier remained several minutes without injury,\r\ncollecting air for chemical analysis in an atmosphere, which proved to\r\nbe loaded with three per cent. of the gas.[2030] None of these\r\nresearches point out the precise manner of death. Dr. Percy of\r\nNottingham informs me he found in 1839, that dogs, which breathed air,\r\ncontaining this gas, quickly died in convulsions like those caused by\r\nhydrocyanic acid; that in some instances the heart’s action was observed\r\nto have ceased, when the body was opened immediately after death; but\r\nthat in general it either continued to beat for some time, or could be\r\nmade to do so when its state of congestion was relieved by withdrawing a\r\nlittle blood.\r\n\r\nDr. Turner and I found that hydrosulphuric acid gas is very injurious to\r\nvegetables, and that it acts differently from muriatic acid gas, as it\r\nappeared to exhaust the vitality of plants and to cause in them a state\r\nanalogous to narcotic poisoning in animals. Four cubic inches and a\r\nhalf, diluted with eighty volumes of air, caused drooping of the leaves\r\nof a mignonette plant in twenty-four hours; and the plant, though then\r\nremoved into the open air, continued to droop till it bent over\r\naltogether and died.[2031]\r\n\r\nThe best description of the effects of this gas on man has been given by\r\nM. Hallé,[2032] in his account of the nature and effects of the\r\nexhalations from the pits of the Parisian necessaries; which exhalations\r\nappear, from the experiments of Thenard and Dupuytren, to be mixtures\r\nchiefly of ammonia and sulphuretted-hydrogen. The symptoms, in cases\r\nwhere the vapours are breathed in a state of concentration, are sudden\r\nweakness and all the signs of ordinary asphyxia. The individual becomes\r\nsuddenly weak and insensible; falls down; and either expires\r\nimmediately, or, if he is fortunate enough to be quickly extricated, he\r\nmay revive in no long time, the belly remaining tense and full for an\r\nhour or upwards, and recovery being preceded by vomiting and hawking of\r\nbloody froth.[2033] When the noxious emanations are less concentrated,\r\nseveral affections have been noticed, which may be reduced to two\r\nvarieties, the one consisting of pure coma, the other of coma and\r\ntetanic convulsions. In the comatose form, the workman seems to fall\r\ngently asleep while at work, is roused with difficulty, and has no\r\nrecollection afterwards of what passed before the accident. The\r\nconvulsive form is sometimes preceded by noisy and restless delirium,\r\nsometimes by sudden faintness, heaving or pain in the stomach, and pains\r\nin the arms, and almost always by difficult breathing, from weakness in\r\nthe muscles of the chest. Insensibility, and a state resembling asphyxia\r\nrapidly succeed, during which the pupil is fixed and dilated, the mouth\r\nfilled with white or bloody froth, the skin cold, and the pulse feeble\r\nand irregular. At last convulsive efforts to breathe ensue; these are\r\nfollowed by general tetanic spasms of the trunk and extremities; and if\r\nthe case is to prove fatal, which it may not do for two hours, a state\r\nof calm and total insensibility precedes death for a short\r\ninterval.[2034] When the exposure has been too slight to cause serious\r\nmischief, the individual is affected with sickness, colic, imperfectly\r\ndefined pains in the chest, and lethargy.[2035]\r\n\r\nThe appearances in the bodies of persons killed by these emanations are\r\nfluidity and blackness of the blood, a dark tint of all the internal\r\nvascular organs, annihilation of the contractility of the muscles, more\r\nor less redness of the bronchial tubes, and secretion of brown mucus\r\nthere as well as in the nostrils, gorging of the lungs, an odour\r\nthroughout the whole viscera like that of decayed fish, and a tendency\r\nto early putrefaction.[2036] Chaussier in his experiments also remarked\r\nin animals, that when a plate of silver or bit of white lead was thrust\r\nunder the skin it was blackened.[2037] Dr. Percy could not detect the\r\ngas in the brain of animals killed by inhaling it.\r\n\r\nThese extraordinary accidents may be occasioned not only by exposure to\r\nthe vapours from the _fosses_, but likewise by the incautious inhalation\r\nof the vapours proceeding from the bodies of persons who have been\r\nasphyxiated there. Sickness, colic, and pains in the chest, are often\r\ncaused in the latter mode; and Hallé has even given an instance of the\r\nmost violent form of the convulsive affection having originated in the\r\nsame manner.[2038]\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader may comprehend the exact cause of these\r\naccidents,—as it is not easy for an Englishman to comprehend how\r\nsuffocation may arise from the fumes of a privy,—it may be necessary to\r\nexplain, that in Paris the pipe of the privy terminates under ground in\r\na pit, which is usually contained in a small covered vault, or is at the\r\nbottom of a small square tower open at the roof of the house; and that\r\nthe pit is often several feet long, wide and deep. Here the filth is\r\nsometimes allowed to accumulate for a great length of time, till the pit\r\nis full; and it is in the process of clearing it out that the workmen\r\nare liable to suffer. Hallé has given an interesting narrative of an\r\nattempt made to empty one of these pits in presence of the Duc. de\r\nRochefoucault, the Abbé Tessier, himself, and other members of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences, who were appointed by the French government to\r\nexamine into the merits of a pretended discovery for destroying the\r\nnoxious vapours. The pit chosen was ten feet and a half long, six wide,\r\nand at least seven deep; and repeated attempts had been previously made\r\nwithout success to empty it. For some time the process went on\r\nprosperously; when at last one of the workmen dropped his bucket into\r\nthe pit. A ladder being procured, he immediately proceeded to descend,\r\nand would not wait to be tied with ropes. “But hardly,” says Hallé, “had\r\nhe descended a few steps of the ladder, when he tumbled down without a\r\ncry, and was overwhelmed in the ordure below, without making the\r\nslightest effort to save himself. It was at first thought he had slipped\r\nhis foot, and another workman promptly offered to descend for him. This\r\nman was secured with ropes in case of accident. But scarcely had he\r\ndescended far enough to have his whole person in the pit except his\r\nhead, when he uttered a suppressed cry, made a violent effort with his\r\nchest, slipped from the ladder, and ceased to move or breathe. His head\r\nhung down on his breast, the pulse was gone; and his complete state of\r\nasphyxia was the affair of a moment. Another workman, descending with\r\nthe same precautions, fainted away in like manner, but was so promptly\r\nwithdrawn that the asphyxia was not complete, and he soon revived. At\r\nlast a stout young man, secured in the same way as the rest, also went\r\ndown a few steps. Finding himself seized like his companions, he\r\nre-ascended to recover himself for a moment; and still not discouraged,\r\nhe resolved to go down again, and descended backwards, keeping his face\r\nuppermost, so that he was able to search for his companion with a hook\r\nand withdraw the body.” It was impossible to go on with the operation of\r\nclearing out; and the pit was shut up again. The first workman never\r\nshowed any sign of life; the second recovered after discharging much\r\nbloody froth; all the persons in the vault were more or less affected;\r\nand a gentleman who, in trying to resuscitate the dead workman,\r\nincautiously breathed the exhalations from his mouth, was immediately\r\nand violently seized with the convulsive form of the affection.[2039]\r\n\r\nThe same kind of accident has been observed at Paris in the vaults of\r\ncemeteries, owing to the same cause,—the disengagement of hydrosulphuric\r\nacid and hydrosulphate of ammonia during putrefaction. A remarkable\r\ninstance is related by Guérard.[2040] Analogous accidents have happened\r\nin this country in clearing out drains.\r\n\r\nIn none of the French investigations on this singular subject has any\r\nallusion been made to the question, whether the health sustains any\r\ninjury from long-continued exposure to the gas in very minute\r\nproportion. It is probably injurious however. At one time, while in the\r\npractice of not using any precautions against inhaling the gas in\r\nchemical researches, I used to remark that daily exposure to it in\r\nminute quantity caused in a few weeks an extraordinary lassitude,\r\nlanguor of the pulse, and defective appetite. Strohmeyer in the like\r\ncircumstances was liable to severe headache. Mr. Taylor says that the\r\nworkmen in the Thames Tunnel suffered severely for some time from a\r\nsimilar exposure. Many of them became affected with giddiness, sickness,\r\ngeneral debility and emaciation, then with a low fever attended with\r\ndelirium, and in the course of a few months several died. No cause could\r\nbe discovered for their illness except the frequent escape of\r\nsulphuretted-hydrogen from the roof. The affection only disappeared,\r\nwhen the communication from bank to bank was completed, so that the\r\ntunnel could be thoroughly ventilated.[2041]\r\n\r\nThe presence of hydrosulphuric acid in all such emanations is best\r\nproved by exposing to them a bit of filtering paper moistened with a\r\nsolution of lead. The smell alone must not be relied on, as putrescent\r\nanimal matter exhales an odour like that of hydrosulphuric acid, though\r\nnone be present. Workmen ought to be aware that hydrosulphuric acid may\r\nbe quickly fatal where lights burn with undiminished brilliancy; and\r\nthat in places where it is apt to accumulate, the degree of purity of\r\nthe air may vary so much in the course of working, as to be wholesome\r\nonly a few minutes before, as well as a few minutes after a fatal\r\naccident.[2042]\r\n\r\nIn the present place, some notice may be taken of an extraordinary\r\naccident, which happened in 1831 near London. Great doubts may be\r\nentertained whether hydrosulphuric acid was the cause of it; and while\r\nthese exist, it is not possible to arrange it under a proper head. It is\r\ntoo important, however, in relation to Medical Jurisprudence, to be\r\nomitted in this work; and I take the opportunity of mentioning it here,\r\nas the accident was ascribed to hydrosulphuric acid by those who\r\nwitnessed it.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1831, twenty-two boys living at a boarding-school at Clapham\r\nwere seized in the course of three or four hours with alarming symptoms\r\nof violent irritation in the stomach and bowels, subsultus of the\r\nmuscles of the arms, and excessive prostration of strength. Another had\r\nbeen similarly attacked three days before. This child died in\r\ntwenty-five, and one of the others in twenty-three hours. On examination\r\nafter death, the Peyerian glands of the intestines were found in the\r\nformer case enlarged, and as it were tuberculated; in the other there\r\nwere also ulcers of the mucous coat of the small intestines, and\r\nsoftening of that coat in the colon. A suspicion of accidental poisoning\r\nhaving naturally arisen, the various utensils and articles of food used\r\nby the family were examined but without success. And the only\r\ncircumstance which appeared to explain the accident was, that two days\r\nbefore the first child took ill, a foul cess-pool had been opened, and\r\nthe materials diffused over a garden adjoining to the children’s\r\nplay-ground. This was considered a sufficient cause of the disease by\r\nDr. Spurgin and Messrs. Angus and Saunders of Clapham, as well as by\r\nDrs. Latham and Chambers, and Mr. Pearson of London, who personally\r\nexamined the whole particulars.[2043] Their explanation may be the only\r\nrational account that can be given of the matter. But as no detail of\r\ntheir chemical inquiries was ever published, their opinion cannot be\r\nreceived with confidence by the medical jurist and the physician; since\r\nit is not supported, so far as I am aware by any previous account of the\r\neffects of hydrosulphuric acid gas.\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Carburetted Hydrogen._—Of the several species of\r\ncarburetted hydrogen gas it is probable that all are more or less\r\nnarcotic; but they are much inferior in energy to sulphuretted hydrogen.\r\n\r\nSir H. Davy found that when he breathed a mixture of two parts of air\r\nand three of carburetted hydrogen, procured from the decomposition of\r\nwater by red-hot charcoal, he was attacked with giddiness, headache, and\r\ntransient weakness of the limbs. When he breathed it pure, the first\r\ninspiration caused a sense of numbness in the muscles of the chest; the\r\nsecond caused an overpowering sense of oppression in the breast, and\r\ninsensibility to external objects; during the third he seemed sinking\r\ninto annihilation, and the mouthpiece dropped out of his hand. On\r\nbecoming again sensible, which happened in less than a minute, he\r\ncontinued for some time to suffer from a feeling of impending\r\nsuffocation, extreme exhaustion, and great feebleness of the pulse.\r\nThroughout the rest of the day he was affected with weakness, giddiness\r\nand rending headache.[2044] These experiments show that the gas is\r\ndeleterious. Yet Nysten found it inert when injected into the veins, and\r\nwhat is more to the point, colliers breathe the air of coal mines\r\nwithout apparent injury when strongly impregnated with it.\r\n\r\nThe mixed gases of coal-gas or oil-gas appear likewise to be inert when\r\nconsiderably diluted; for gas-men breathe with impunity an atmosphere\r\nconsiderably loaded with them; and in the course of some researches on\r\nthe illuminating power and best mode of burning these gases, Dr. Turner\r\nand myself daily, for two months, breathed air strongly impregnated with\r\nthem, but never remarked any unpleasant effect whatever.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, however, from several accidents in France and England,\r\nthat when the impregnation is carried a certain length, poisonous\r\neffects may ensue; and that the symptoms then induced are purely\r\nnarcotic. The first case, which occurred at Paris in 1830, has been\r\nrelated by M. Devergie. In consequence of a leak in the service-pipe\r\nwhich supplied a warehouse, five individuals who slept in the house were\r\nattacked during the night with stupor; and if one of them had not been\r\nawakened by the smell and alarmed the rest, it is probable that all\r\nwould have perished. As it was, one man was found completely comatose\r\nand occasionally convulsed, with froth issuing from the mouth,\r\noccasional vomiting, stertorous respiration, and dilated pupils. Some\r\ntemporary amendment was procured by blood-letting, but the breathing\r\ncontinued laborious, and he expired about nine hours after the party\r\nwent to bed, and six hours after the alarm was given. On dissection the\r\nvessels of the brain were found much gorged, the blood in the heart and\r\ngreat vessels firmly coagulated, one of the lungs congested, and its\r\nbronchial tube blocked up by a kidney bean. The immediate cause of death\r\nin this case is therefore doubtful.[2045] A similar set of cases\r\nhappened at Leeds in 1838. An old woman and her grand-daughter were\r\nfound dead in bed one morning at nine o’clock, ten hours and a half\r\nafter they had been seen alive and well. The air of the apartment was\r\nloaded with coal-gas from a leak in a street-pipe ten feet from the\r\nbedroom. One body was cold and stiff when found, and the other became\r\nrigid very soon. The attitude and expression were calm, the integuments\r\npale, the cerebral membranes natural, the brain itself turgid, and its\r\nventricles distended, in the case of the girl, with an ounce and a half\r\nof serosity, the lungs congested, the alimentary mucous membrane red,\r\nand the blood every where fluid, and unusually florid, even in the right\r\nside of the heart.[2046] Another accident of the same kind, which proved\r\nfatal to five individuals, occurred at Strasbourg in 1841. Four were\r\nfound dead, another survived twenty-four hours after the accident was\r\ndiscovered, and a sixth recovered. It appears from the statement of this\r\nperson, that the first symptoms were headache and giddiness, then nausea\r\nand vomiting, afterwards confusion of ideas, and at length\r\ninsensibility. General prostration, partial palsy, coma, and convulsions\r\nwere the leading symptoms after the accident was observed. In the four\r\npeople found dead the most remarkable appearances were cerebral\r\ncongestion, redness of the bronchial membrane, accumulation of bloody,\r\nfrothy mucus in the air tubes, scarlet redness of the lungs, coagulation\r\nand darkness of the blood. In the person who was found alive, but did\r\nnot recover, there was no cerebral congestion, gorging of the air tubes,\r\nor redness of the lungs. Professor Tourdes, who reports these cases,\r\nascertained that air containing a fiftieth of coal-gas kills rabbits in\r\ntwelve or fourteen minutes, and that even a thirtieth proves fatal,\r\nthough slowly. The gas which caused the accident, and which was prepared\r\nfrom a mixture of water and slate coal, consisted of 22·5 per cent.\r\nlight carburetted hydrogen, 6·0 bicarburetted hydrogen, 21·9 carbonic\r\noxide, 31 hydrogen, 14 azote, and 4·6 carbonic acid; and by experiment\r\nthe author found that the most energetic of these gases as a poison is\r\nthe carbonic oxide, and that the action of the two carburetted-hydrogens\r\nis quite feeble.[2047] It is somewhat remarkable that no such accident\r\nhas ever happened in Edinburgh, where nevertheless coal-gas is more used\r\nfor purposes of illumination in private houses than in any other city.\r\nThe fine quality of the gas,—for it contains a mere trace of carbonic\r\nacid, and probably less than four per cent. of carbonic oxide,—may be\r\nthe reason why accidents are not occasioned by it. It is a singular\r\nfact, however, that the powerful odour of the gas, when it accidentally\r\nescapes in the night-time, generally awakes very soon those who are\r\nexposed to inhale it.\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Carbonic Acid Gas._—Carbonic acid gas is the most\r\nimportant of the deleterious gases; for it is the daily source of fatal\r\naccidents. It is extricated in great quantity from burning fuel; it is\r\ngiven out abundantly in the calcining of lime; it is disengaged in a\r\nstate of considerable purity in brew-houses by the fermentation of beer;\r\nit is often met with in mines and caverns, particularly in coal-pits and\r\ndraw-wells; it may collect in apartments where fuel is burnt without a\r\nproper outlet for the vitiated air, or where persons are crowded too\r\nmuch for the capacity of the room. Hence many have been killed by\r\ndescending incautiously into draw-wells, by falling into beer-vats, and\r\nby sleeping before the traps of lime-kilns, or in apartments without\r\nvents and heated by choffers. Instances have even occurred of the same\r\naccident from sleeping in greenhouses during the night, when plants\r\nexhale much carbonic acid; and some dreadful cases have occurred of\r\nsuffocation from confinement in small crowded rooms.\r\n\r\nPhysiologists, as already remarked, are not quite agreed as to the\r\naction of carbonic acid gas,—whether it is a positive poison, or simply\r\nan asphyxiating gas. But in my opinion reasons enough exist for\r\nbelieving that it is positively and energetically poisonous. This is\r\nperhaps shown by its effects being much more rapidly produced, and much\r\nmore slowly and imperfectly removed, than asphyxia from immersion in\r\nhydrogen or azote.[2048] Thus immersion for twenty-five seconds in an\r\natmosphere of carbonic acid gas has been found sufficient to kill an\r\nanimal outright; and fifteen seconds will kill a small bird.[2049] But\r\nit is more unequivocally established by the three following facts:\r\n\r\nIn the first place, if, instead of the nitrogen contained in atmospheric\r\nair, carbonic acid gas be mixed with oxygen in the same proportion,\r\nanimals cannot breathe this atmosphere for two minutes without being\r\nseized with symptoms of poisoning.[2050] Even a much less proportion has\r\nthe same effect. Five per cent. in the air will affect small birds in\r\ntwo minutes, and kill them in half an hour.[2051] Persons have become\r\napoplectic in an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas, which to those who\r\nentered it appeared at first quite respirable.[2052]\r\n\r\nSecondly, Professor Rolando of Turin having found that the land tortoise\r\nsustained little injury when the great air-tube of one lung was tied,—he\r\ncontrived to make it breathe carbonic acid gas with one lung, while\r\natmospheric air was inhaled by the other; and he remarked that death\r\ntook place in a few hours.[2053]\r\n\r\nThirdly, the symptoms caused by inhaling the gas may be also produced by\r\napplying it to the inner membrane of the stomach or to the skin. On the\r\none hand aërated water has been known to cause giddiness or even\r\nintoxication when drunk too freely at first;[2054] and the sparkling\r\nwines probably owe their rapid intoxicating power to the carbonic acid\r\nthey contain. And, on the other hand, M. Collard de Martigny has found\r\nthat, if the human body be enclosed in an atmosphere of the gas, due\r\nprecautions being taken to preserve the free access of common air to the\r\nlungs, the usual symptoms of poisoning with carbonic acid are produced,\r\nsuch as weight in the head, obscurity of sight, pain in the temples,\r\nringing in the ears, giddiness, and an undefinable feeling of terror;\r\nand that if the same experiment be made on animals and continued long\r\nenough, death will be the consequence.[2055]\r\n\r\nWhen a man attempts to inhale pure carbonic acid gas, for example by\r\nputting the face over the edge of a beer-vat, or the nose into a jar\r\ncontaining chalk and weak muriatic acid, the nostrils and throat are\r\nirritated so strongly, that the glottis closes and inspiration becomes\r\nimpossible. Sir H. Davy in making this experiment, farther remarked,\r\nthat the gas causes an acid taste in the mouth and throat, and a sense\r\nof burning in the uvula.[2056] I have remarked the same effects from\r\nvery pure gas disengaged by tartaric acid from carbonate of soda. Hence,\r\nwhen a person is immersed in the gas nearly or perfectly pure, as in a\r\nbeer-vat, or old well, he dies at once of suffocation.\r\n\r\nThe effects are very different when the gas is considerably diluted; for\r\nthe symptoms then resemble apoplexy. As they differ somewhat according\r\nto the source from which the gas is derived, and the admixtures\r\nconsequently breathed along with it, it will be necessary to notice\r\nseparately the effects of the pure gas diluted with air,—of the\r\nemanations from burning charcoal, tallow, and coal,—and finally of air\r\nvitiated by the breath.\r\n\r\n1. M. Chomel of Paris has related a case of poisoning with the gas\r\ndiluted with air, in the person of a labourer, who was suddenly immersed\r\nin it at the bottom of a well, and remained there three-quarters of an\r\nhour. He was first affected with violent and irregular convulsions of\r\nthe whole body and perfect insensibility, afterwards with fits of spasm\r\nlike tetanus; and during the second day, when these symptoms had gone\r\noff, he continued to be affected with dumbness.[2057]—It is worthy of\r\nparticular remark that, contrary to general belief, these effects may be\r\nproduced in situations where the air is not sufficiently impure to\r\nextinguish lights. Thus M. Collard de Martigny relates the case of a\r\nservant, who, on entering a cellar where grape-juice was fermenting,\r\nbecame suddenly giddy, and, under a vague impression of terror, fled\r\nfrom the place, dropping her candle on the floor and shutting the door\r\nbehind her. She fell down insensible outside the door, and those who\r\nwent to her assistance found on opening the door that the light\r\ncontinued to burn.[2058]—Mr. Taylor indeed has since ascertained that a\r\ncandle will burn in air, which contains ten, or even twelve per cent. of\r\ncarbonic acid,[2059]—a proportion more than sufficient to cause\r\npoisoning in no long time. It is also important to observe, that,\r\ncontrary to what would be expected from the statements of Sir H. Davy\r\nand other experimentalists on the effects of the pure gas, it will often\r\nhappen that no odour or taste is perceived. M. Bonami, in an account of\r\nan accident which happened at Nantes to two workmen who descended an old\r\nwell, says that the first while descending uttered a piercing cry and\r\nfell down; and that as soon as his comrade, who tried to rescue him, was\r\nlowered ten or twelve feet, he felt as if he was about to be suffocated\r\nfor want of breath, but perceived no strong or disagreeable smell.[2060]\r\nIt should be remembered therefore by workmen, that there may be danger\r\nin descending pits where none is indicated by the sense of smell, or by\r\nthe extinguishing of a light.\r\n\r\n2. The fumes of burning charcoal have been long known to be deleterious.\r\nThe early symptoms caused by them have been little noticed; for, as this\r\nvariety of poisoning generally occurs during sleep, the patient is\r\nseldom seen till the symptoms are fully formed. In an attempt at\r\nself-destruction described in a French journal, the first effects were\r\nslight oppression, then violent palpitation, next confusion of ideas,\r\nand at last insensibility.[2061] Tightness in the temples, and an\r\nundefinable sense of alarm have also been remarked;[2062] and others\r\nhave, on the contrary, experienced a pleasing sensation that seduced\r\nthem to remain on the fatal spot.[2063] The best account of the\r\nincipient symptoms has been given by Mr. Coathupe of Wraxhall, in an\r\naccount of an experiment he made with Joyce’s stove,—a preposterous\r\ninvention, the fuel of which was supposed by the inventor to burn\r\nwithout contaminating the air, although it was neither more nor less\r\nthan prepared charcoal. Having closed every aperture in a room of the\r\ncapacity of eighty cubic yards, Mr. Coathupe kindled the stove and\r\nwatched the results. In four hours he had slight giddiness, in five\r\nhours and a half intense giddiness, the desire to vomit without the\r\npower, excessive prostration and incapability of muscular effort, a\r\nfrequent full throbbing pulse, a sense of distention of the cerebral\r\narteries, agonizing headache, chiefly in the hindhead, but no sense of\r\nsuffocation. At this time he experienced great difficulty in opening the\r\nwindow and removing the stove; and in seven hours, when his wife entered\r\nthe room, he was unable to tell what was the matter, although quite\r\nconscious of all that was passing. He then slowly recovered.[2064] A\r\nsimilar account has also been given by Mr. Chapman of Tooting of the\r\neffects of this notorious stove. A young gentleman, after being only one\r\nhour in a chamber heated by it, felt first slight giddiness and\r\nheadache, and afterwards violent pain in the head and tightness round\r\nthe forehead and temples; the pupils became excessively dilated and\r\nnearly insensible; there was constant ringing in the ears, a feeble\r\nfrequent pulse, paleness of the features and lividity of the lips and\r\nhands, coldness of the extremities, laborious irregular breathing, and\r\nextreme prostration. A temporary relief, obtained by stimulants, was\r\nsucceeded by violence; which, however, was subdued by blood-letting; and\r\nhe recovered.[2065] A set of cases, 70 in number, similar to the last\r\ntwo, but milder, occurred in January, 1836, in the church of Downham in\r\nNorfolk, which was heated by two of these stoves.[2066]\r\n\r\nThe following abstract of a case by Dr. Babington will convey an\r\naccurate idea of the advanced symptoms. The waiter of a tavern and a\r\nlittle boy, on going to bed, left a choffer of charcoal burning beside\r\nit; and next morning were found insensible. The boy died immediately\r\nafter they were discovered. The waiter had stertorous breathing, livid\r\nlips, flushing of the face, and a full, strong pulse; for which\r\naffections he was bled to ten ounces. When Dr. Babington first saw him,\r\nhowever, the pulse had become feeble, the breathing imperfect, and the\r\nlimbs cold; the muscles were powerless but twitched with slight\r\nconvulsions, the sensibility gone, the face pale, the eyelids closed,\r\nthe eyes prominent and rolling, the tongue swollen and the jaw locked\r\nupon it, and there was a great flow of saliva from the mouth. The\r\nemployment of galvanism at this time caused an evident amendment in\r\nevery symptom. But it was soon abandoned; because each time it was\r\napplied, the excitement was rapidly followed by corresponding\r\ndepression. Cold water was then dashed upon him, ammonia rubbed on his\r\nchest, and oxygen thrown into the lungs; through which means a warm\r\nperspiration was brought out, and his state rapidly improved. He was\r\nnearly lost, however, during the subsequent night by hemorrhage from the\r\ndivided vein; but next day he was so well that he could even speak a\r\nlittle. For two days afterwards the left side of the face was paralyzed,\r\nand his mental faculties were somewhat disordered.[2067]—In such cases\r\nas this the stupor is generally very deep. There is a case in a French\r\nJournal of a girl, who, after remaining some time in a small close\r\nchamber heated by a charcoal choffer, fell down insensible, remained in\r\nthat state for three hours, and found, on recovering from her lethargy,\r\nthat the choffer had fallen, and burnt the skin and subjacent fat of the\r\nthighs to a cinder.[2068]\r\n\r\nOccasionally the stage of stupor is followed, as in some other varieties\r\nof narcotic poisoning, by a stage of delirium, at times of the furious\r\nkind, or by a state resembling somnambulism.[2069] It does not follow\r\nthat recovery is certain because coma has thus given place to\r\ndelirium,—an alteration, which in most varieties of narcotic poisoning\r\nis considered a sure sign of recovery. Collard de Martigny has related a\r\ncase which eventually proved fatal, notwithstanding this sign of\r\nimprovement.[2070]\r\n\r\nThe narcotism induced by breathing charcoal fumes often lasts a\r\nconsiderable length of time,—much longer indeed than the effects of\r\nother narcotic poisons. This will appear sufficiently from the case\r\ndescribed by Dr. Babington. One of the people, mentioned at the\r\ncommencement of this chapter as having been suffocated at Gerolzhofen,\r\nlingered five days in a state of coma before he expired.\r\n\r\nCommonly in cases of recovery, there is found to have been no\r\nconsciousness of any thing going on around, or recollection of what\r\npassed subsequently to the first impressions of poisoning. The reverse,\r\nhowever, occurred in Mr. Coathupe’s experiment; and a similar instance\r\nhas been published, where the individual, though apparently insensible,\r\nknew when the room was first entered by strangers, and heard them call\r\nhim by name and bid him put out his tongue, and stretch forth his\r\narm,—without, however, his having the power to answer, or in any way to\r\nexpress the consciousness of understanding them.[2071]\r\n\r\nPoisoning with charcoal vapour has become a subject of great importance\r\nin French medical jurisprudence, partly on account of the frequency with\r\nwhich it is resorted to for the purpose of committing suicide, and\r\npartly because repeated attempts have been made to conceal murder by\r\narranging matters so as to present the appearances of suicide. M.\r\nDevergie says, that in the years 1834 and 1835 no fewer than 360 cases\r\nof poisoning with charcoal-vapour occurred in Paris, of which nearly\r\nfour-fifths proved fatal; and he has given the particulars of two\r\nattempts to conceal murder under the appearance of death from this\r\ncause.[2072]\r\n\r\nThe subject has therefore been carefully examined by various authors,\r\nbut by none so successfully as by M. Devergie; of whose important\r\nresearches the following is a brief analysis.\r\n\r\nIn stating the various sources whence charcoal-vapour may become\r\nincidentally the cause of death, he dwells particularly on the risk of\r\nits admission from adjoining vents, even in other houses from that where\r\nthe accidents happen,—because there may be currents in the apartment\r\nwhich occasion back-draught. Three remarkable cases of this kind, very\r\nobscure in their origin, have been related by M. d’Arcet.[2073]\r\n\r\nThe very discrepant effects of the poison on different individuals,\r\nsimultaneously and to appearance alike exposed to it, have usually been\r\nexplained by reference to the great density of the gas, which\r\nconsequently accumulates near the floor. Some, however, have doubted the\r\nfact that the gas is unequally diffused. Mr. Taylor in particular says\r\nhe ascertained by analysis, that air collected above and below a choffer\r\nof burning charcoal was equally contaminated, that what was collected a\r\nfoot above its level contained 4·65 per cent., and that another portion\r\ntaken the same distance below it contained 4·5 of carbonic acid.[2074]\r\nM. Devergie has discovered the source of these discrepant opinions. He\r\nhas found,[2075] that, notwithstanding the high density of carbonic acid\r\ngas, the currents caused by the heat, disengaged when charcoal is burnt\r\nin a room, without an issue for the products of combustion, produce an\r\nequable mixture of gases at all elevations in the apartment, provided\r\nthe air be examined while still warm, and not long after the charcoal\r\nhas burnt out; but that, at a later period, such as twelve hours, the\r\ncarbonic acid partly separates and sinks, so that, while the air at the\r\ntop contains only a 78th, that near the floor contains four times as\r\nmuch, or a 19th of carbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\nDisputes have also arisen as to the precise nature of the emanations\r\nfrom burning charcoal,—some believing that carbonic acid is alone\r\ndischarged in such quantity as to prove injurious, and is singly\r\nsufficient to account for the effects which have been observed,—while\r\nothers maintain that carbonic oxide, carburetted-hydrogen, or some\r\npeculiar pyrogenous vapour, may be also formed, and prove the real cause\r\nof the active properties of the vapour. According to the researches of\r\nOrfila, charcoal in a state of vivid ignition emits carbonic acid only,\r\na hundred parts of the consumed air having been ascertained by him to be\r\ncomposed of 42 azote, 46 common air, and 12 carbonic acid. But when the\r\ncombustion is low, a hundred parts consist of 52 azote, 20 common air,\r\n14 carbonic acid, and 14 carburetted-hydrogen; so that not only is the\r\nair more thoroughly consumed; but likewise an additional poisonous gas\r\nis brought into action.[2076] The difference thus indicated has been\r\nsupposed to account for what is often observed in countries where\r\ncharcoal choffers are much in use for warming close apartments,—namely,\r\nthat the practice is attended with most danger when the combustion is\r\nlow, and that it is unsafe to close the doors of an apartment till the\r\nfuel is in a state of vivid ignition. M. Guérard again maintains, that\r\nwhen the supply of air is incomplete and combustion low, carbonic oxide\r\ngas is formed in considerable quantity; and that this gas, confessedly a\r\nmuch more powerful narcotic than carbonic acid, is probably the cause of\r\nmany cases of poisoning with charcoal fumes.[2077] M. Devergie doubts\r\nthe exactness of Orfila’s experiments on this head, but gives no new\r\nanalysis. He observes that charcoal-vapour gives the air of a room a\r\npeculiar odour and bluish misty appearance, the latter of which slowly\r\ndiminishes, and in twelve hours disappears; and that possibly there may\r\nbe both a little carbonic oxide and carburetted-hydrogen in the air. But\r\nnevertheless he is of opinion that the carbonic acid alone is adequate\r\nto occasion all the effects observed in man or animals.[2078] Professor\r\nHünefeld is of a different opinion, and has supplied the most\r\nsatisfactory explanation of the important fact, that charcoal fumes are\r\nmost noxious when the fuel has been just kindled and burns low; for he\r\nascertained that at first it gives out a pyrogenous acid, which\r\noccasions headache and tendency to sickness, and which is not a product\r\nof combustion at the moment, but exists ready formed; and that when\r\ncharcoal is at a full red heat, this noxious substance is no longer\r\ngiven off.[2079] Mr. Coathupe also thinks the cause of poisoning by\r\ncharcoal fumes is an unknown pyrogenous body, and not carbonic acid\r\ngas.[2080]—This department of inquiry is obviously susceptible of more\r\nprecise information. But meanwhile, whatever may be the probability\r\nthat, besides carbonic acid, some other gases, or some peculiar\r\npyrogenous body, may occasionally exist in charcoal fumes, and increase\r\ntheir poisonous property, little doubt can exist that the carbonic acid\r\nis singly sufficient to account for all the leading phenomena.\r\n\r\nM. Devergie has been led to the opinion that air, in which a fourth part\r\nof its oxygen has been converted into carbonic acid, and which therefore\r\ncontains five per cent. of that gas, is amply enough impregnated to\r\noccasion death.[2081] This corresponds with the observations of M.\r\nOllivier, who found that three per cent. was as much as could be\r\nbreathed with impunity even for a moderate length of time.[2082] Less,\r\nhowever, will suffice to prove injurious or even fatal, if the air be\r\nbreathed long. Mr. Coathupe inferred from a rough estimate, that in the\r\ndangerous experiment he made upon himself, the carbonic acid, if\r\nuniformly diffused in the apartment, which was probably the case,\r\namounted to only two per cent.; but his data were inadequate.[2083]\r\n\r\nProceeding from the fact that five per cent. of carbonic acid is\r\nsufficient to cause death, Devergie points out what quantity of charcoal\r\nis required to form that proportion,—a question of no small moment in\r\nrespect to charges of murder, concealed under the semblance of suicide\r\nby suffocation with charcoal fumes. And he shows, that a French bushel,\r\nor decalitre, weighing 3000 grammes, is sufficient for a close apartment\r\nof 1275 cubic mètres, that is 6·6 pounds avoirdupois for a space of 1666\r\nEnglish cubic yards, provided the gas be uniformly diffused.[2084] The\r\nquantity of charcoal burnt in a given case may be arrived at pretty\r\nnearly from the weight of ashes left, which is estimated in round\r\nnumbers at a twenty-fifth by himself,[2085] and at a twentieth by\r\nOllivier.[2086]\r\n\r\nIt is important to remark that complete closure of an apartment is by no\r\nmeans essential for the action of carbonic acid, whether disengaged\r\nwithin it or introduced from without. For poisoning has occurred, even\r\nwhere a window was partially open.[2087]\r\n\r\n3. It is probable that in some circumstances a very small quantity of\r\nthe mixed gases proceeding from the slow combustion of tallow and other\r\noily substances will produce dangerous symptoms. Dr. Blackadder remarked\r\nin the course of his experiments on flame, that the vapour into which\r\noil is resolved, previous to its forming flame round the wick, excites\r\nin minute quantities intense headache.[2088] The emanations from the\r\nburning snuff of a candle, which are probably of the same nature, seem\r\nto be very poisonous. An instance indeed has been recorded in which they\r\nproved fatal. A party of iron-smiths, who were carousing on a festival\r\nday at Leipzig, amused themselves with plaguing a boy, who was asleep in\r\na corner of the room, by holding under his nose the smoke of a candle\r\njust extinguished. At first he was roused a little each time. But when\r\nthe amusement had been continued for half an hour he began to breathe\r\nlaboriously, was then attacked with incessant epileptic convulsions, and\r\ndied on the third day.[2089]—The effects of such emanations are probably\r\nowing to empyreumatic volatile oil, which will be presently seen to be\r\nan active poison.\r\n\r\n4. The vapours from burning coal are the most noxious of all kinds of\r\nemanations from fuel, and cause peculiar symptoms. But they are less apt\r\nto lead to accidents than the vapour of charcoal, as they are much more\r\nirritating to the lungs. This effect depends on the sulphurous acid gas\r\nwhich is mingled with the carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nSulphurous acid gas is exceedingly deleterious to vegetable life, being\r\nhardly inferior in that respect to hydrochloric acid. Dr. Turner and I\r\nfound that a fifth of a cubic inch diluted with ten thousand times its\r\nvolume of air destroyed all the leaves of various plants in forty-eight\r\nhours.[2090] I am not acquainted with any experiments on animals or\r\nobservations on man regarding the effects of the pure gas. But it will\r\nwithout a doubt prove a powerful irritant.\r\n\r\nSome of the peculiarities in the cases now to be mentioned were possibly\r\nowing to the admixture of sulphuric acid gas with the carbonic, both\r\nbeing inhaled in a diluted state. The cases are described by Mr. Braid,\r\nat the time surgeon at Leadhills. In March, 1817, several of the miners\r\nthere were violently affected, and some killed, in consequence, it was\r\nsupposed, of the smoke of one of the steam-engines having escaped into\r\nthe way-gates, and contaminated the air in the workings. Four men who\r\nattempted to force their way through this air into the workings below\r\nwere unable to advance beyond, and seem to have died immediately. The\r\nrest attempted to descend two hours after, but were suddenly stopped by\r\nthe contaminated air. As soon as they reached it, although their lights\r\nburnt tolerably well, they felt difficulty in breathing, and were then\r\nseized with violent pain and beating in the head, giddiness and ringing\r\nin the ears, followed by vomiting, palpitation and anxiety, weakness of\r\nthe limbs and pains above the knees, and finally with loss of\r\nrecollection. Some of them made their escape, but others remained till\r\nthe air was so far purified that their companions could descend to their\r\naid. When Mr. Braid first saw them, some were running about frantic and\r\nfurious, striking all who came in their way,—some ran off terrified\r\nwhenever any one approached them,—some were singing,—some\r\npraying,—others lying listless and insensible. Many of them retched and\r\nvomited. In some the pulse was quick, in others slow, in many irregular,\r\nand in all feeble. All who could describe their complaints had violent\r\nheadache, some of them tenesmus, and a few diarrhœa. In a few days all\r\nrecovered except the first four and three others who had descended to\r\nthe deeper parts of the mine.[2091]—Another accident of the same nature,\r\nand followed by the same phenomena, happened more lately at\r\nLeadhills.[2092] Similar accidents have been also witnessed by Mr. Bald,\r\ncivil engineer, among the coal-miners who work in the neighbourhood of a\r\nburning mine belonging to the Devon Company. It is worthy of remark,\r\nthat the men sometimes worked for a considerable length of time before\r\nthey were taken ill. Such being the case, it will be readily conceived\r\nthat the burning of the lights was not a test of the wholesomeness of\r\nthe air. Here, as at Leadhills and in other instances already mentioned,\r\nthe lights continued to burn where the men were poisoned.[2093]\r\n\r\n5. Somewhat analogous to the symptoms now described are the effects of\r\nthe gradual contamination of air in a confined apartment. Every one must\r\nhave read of the horrible death of the Englishmen who were locked up all\r\nnight in a close dungeon in Fort William at Calcutta. One hundred and\r\nforty-six individuals were imprisoned in a room twenty feet square, with\r\nonly one small window; and before next morning all but 23 died under the\r\nmost dreadful of tortures,—that of slowly increasing suffocation. They\r\nseem to have been affected nearly in the same way as the workmen at\r\nLeadhills.[2094] A similar accident happened in London in 1742. The\r\nkeeper of the round-house of St. Martin’s, crammed 28 people into an\r\napartment six feet square and not quite six feet high; and four were\r\nsuffocated.[2095]\r\n\r\nThe morbid appearances left on the body after poisoning with carbonic\r\nacid gas have been chiefly observed in persons killed by charcoal\r\nvapour. According to Portal the vessels of the brain are congested, and\r\nthe ventricles contain serum; the lungs are distended, as if\r\nemphysematous; the heart and great veins are gorged with black fluid\r\nblood; the eyes are generally glistening and prominent, the face red,\r\nand the tongue protruded and black.[2096]—Gorging of the cerebral\r\nvessels seems to be very common. Yet sometimes it is inconsiderable, as\r\nin two cases related by Dr. Bright, where, except in the sinuses and in\r\nthe greater veins of the ventricles and substance of the brain, no\r\nparticular gorging or vascularity seems to have been met with,—the\r\nexternal membranes in particular having been very little injected.[2097]\r\nThis, however, is certainly a rare occurrence. Serous effusion in the\r\nventricles and under the arachnoid membrane is very general, yet not\r\ninvariable.—Dr. Schenck, medical inspector of Siegen, in reporting two\r\ncases of death caused by the vapours of burning wood, notices paleness\r\nof the countenance as a singular accompaniment of cerebral congestion;\r\nand calls the attention of medical jurists to the extreme calmness of\r\nthe features as a general character of this variety of poisoning.[2098]\r\nAlthough the same appearance has also been noticed by others,[2099] the\r\ncountenance nevertheless is often livid. But whether livid or pale, it\r\nis always composed.—It appears from an account in Pyl’s Essays of\r\nseveral cases of suffocation from the fumes of burning wood, that\r\nbesides the appearances mentioned by Portal, there is usually great\r\nlivor of the back, frothiness as well as fluidity of the blood, and more\r\nor less gorging of the lungs with blood.[2100]—A common appearance where\r\nthe poisonous emanation has been charcoal vapour, is a lining of dark,\r\nor sometimes actually black dust on the mucous membranes of the air\r\npassages, thickest near the external opening of the nostrils, and\r\ndisappearing towards the glottis. There are obvious reasons why this\r\nappearance cannot always be expected to occur; but when present, it may\r\nbe in doubtful circumstances a very important article of evidence.[2101]\r\nIn Wildberg’s collection of cases there is a report on two people who\r\nwere suffocated in bed, in consequence of the servant having neglected\r\nto open the flue-trap when she kindled the stove in the bed-chamber; and\r\nin each of them Wildberg found all the appearances now quoted from\r\nPortal and Pyl. The tongue was black and swelled.[2102]—Mertzdorff has\r\nrelated a case of death from the same cause, in which, together with the\r\npreceding appearances, an effusion of blood was found between\r\nthe arachnoid and pia mater over the whole surface of both\r\nhemispheres.[2103] In one of Dr. Bright’s cases there was a small\r\necchymosis in the cortical substance on the outer side of the anterior\r\nlobe, and not extending into the medullary matter. Fallot mentions an\r\ninstance of suffocation from charcoal vapour, where a little coagulated\r\nblood was found between the layers of the arachnoid membrane of the\r\ncerebellum in the region of the left occipital hollow.[2104] Three\r\ninstances of extravasation are enumerated in a list of German cases\r\nanalysed by Dr. Bird.[2105] Such appearances might be expected more\r\nfrequently, considering the manifest tendency of this kind of poisoning\r\nto cause congestion in the head.—The blood is generally described as\r\nbeing liquid and very dark. But M. Ollivier has lately called attention\r\nto the fact, that the blood both before and after death is not unusually\r\nmore florid in the veins than natural.[2106] In a case mentioned by M.\r\nRayer globules of an oily-looking matter were found swimming on the\r\nsurface of the blood and urine.[2107] This is a solitary\r\nobservation.—The body usually remains flaccid, and the customary stage\r\nof rigidity is imperfect. In some instances, however, as in those\r\nrelated by Dr. Schenck, the stage of rigidity is passed through in the\r\nusual manner. It is not uncommon to find vomited matter lying beside the\r\nbody, a circumstance which may naturally mislead the unpractised. This\r\nis represented by Professor Wagner of Berlin to have occurred uniformly\r\nin his experience;[2108] and it is also mentioned in many of the cases\r\nreported by others;[2109] but it is not invariable.—A red appearance in\r\nthe stomach and intestines has been noticed in many cases,[2110] and\r\noften ascribed to inflammation; but it is probably nothing more than the\r\nresult of the venous congestion, which pervades most of the membranous\r\nsurfaces of the body.\r\n\r\nThe least variable appearances according to Dr. Bird are general\r\nlividity, protrusion of the tongue, a calm expression and attitude,\r\ncerebral congestion, and serous effusion. This author’s paper in the\r\nMedical Gazette, 1838–39, i., or in Guy’s Hospital Reports, iv., enters\r\nvery fully into the appearances after death, and may be consulted with\r\nadvantage for further details.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of poisoning with carbonic acid consists chiefly in the\r\noccasional employment of the cold affusion, and in moderate\r\nblood-letting either from the arm or from the head. In a case which\r\nhappened at Paris, where a lady tried to make away with herself by\r\nbreathing charcoal fumes, and was found in a state of almost hopeless\r\ninsensibility, various remedies were tried unsuccessfully, till cupping\r\nfrom the nape of the neck was resorted to; and she then rapidly\r\nrecovered.[2111] Another instance where blood-letting was also\r\nsingularly successful deserves particular mention; because for three\r\nhours the patient remained without pulsation in any artery, and without\r\nthe slightest perceptible respiration. At first neither by cupping nor\r\nby venesection could any blood be obtained; and it was only after the\r\nlong interval just mentioned, and constant artificial inflation of the\r\nlungs, that the blood at length trickled slowly from the arm. The pulse\r\nand breathing were after this soon re-established; but it was not till\r\neight hours later that sensibility returned.[2112]\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Carbonic Oxide Gas._—Carbonic oxide gas, according to\r\nNysten, has not any effect on man when injected into the pleura; but\r\nwhen thrown slowly into the veins, it gives the arterial blood a\r\nbrownish tint, and induces for a short time a state resembling\r\nintoxication.[2113] The quantity injected into the veins was probably\r\ntoo small to produce the full effect, or it was discharged in passing\r\nthrough the lungs; for this gas certainly appears to be very deleterious\r\nwhen breathed by man, or the lower animals. M. Leblanc found by\r\nexperiment that a sparrow was killed almost immediately in air\r\ncontaining only a twentieth of it, and that so little even as a\r\nhundredth part proved fatal in two minutes.[2114]\r\n\r\nA set of interesting but hazardous experiments were made with it in 1814\r\nby the assistants of Mr. Higgins of Dublin. One gentleman, after\r\ninhaling it two or three times, was seized with giddiness, tremors, and\r\nan approach to insensibility, succeeded by languor, weakness, and\r\nheadache of some hours’ duration. The other had almost paid dearly for\r\nhis curiosity. Having previously exhausted his lungs, he inhaled the\r\npure gas three or four times, upon which he was suddenly deprived of\r\nsense and motion, fell down supine, and continued for half an hour\r\ninsensible, apparently lifeless, and with the pulse nearly extinct.\r\nVarious means were tried for rousing him, without success; till at last\r\noxygen gas was blown into the lungs. Animation then returned rapidly:\r\nbut he was affected for the rest of the day with convulsive agitation of\r\nthe body, stupor, violent headache, and quick irregular pulse; and after\r\nhis senses were quite restored, he suffered from giddiness, blindness,\r\nnausea, alternate heats and chills, and then feverish, broken, but\r\nirresistible sleep.[2115] A French aëronaut, who used for his balloon a\r\nmixture of carbonic oxide and hydrogen, obtained by decomposing water\r\nwith red-hot charcoal, lately suffered from similar symptoms in a milder\r\ndegree, in consequence of the gas being disengaged upon him from the\r\nsafety-valve of his balloon.[2116]\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Nitrous Oxide Gas._—The nitrous oxide or intoxicating\r\ngas is the last of the narcotic gases to be noticed. Nysten found, that,\r\nwhen slowly injected in large quantity into the veins of animals, it\r\nonly caused slight staggering.[2117] Frequent observation, however, has\r\nshown that it is by no means so inert when breathed by man. Sir H. Davy,\r\nwho first had the courage to inhale it, observed that it excited\r\ngiddiness, a delightful sense of thrilling in the chest and limbs,\r\nacuteness of hearing, brilliancy of all surrounding objects, and an\r\nunconquerable propensity to brisk muscular exertion. These feelings were\r\nof short duration, but were generally succeeded by alertness of body and\r\nmind, never by the exhaustion, depression, and nausea, which follow the\r\nstage of excitement brought on by spirits or opium.[2118] Although many\r\nhave since experienced the same enticing effects, yet they are by no\r\nmeans uniform. For others have been suddenly seized with great weakness,\r\ntendency to faint, loss of voice, and sometimes convulsions; and two of\r\nThenard’s assistants, on making the experiment, fainted away, and\r\nremained some seconds motionless and insensible.[2119] It is a\r\nremarkable circumstance in the operation of this gas, that, unlike other\r\nstimulants, it does not lose its virtues under the influence of habit.\r\nNeither does the habitual use of it lead to any ill consequence. Sir H.\r\nDavy, in the course of his researches, which were continued above two\r\nmonths, breathed it occasionally three or four times a day for a week\r\ntogether, at other periods four or five times a week only; yet at the\r\nend his health was good, his mind clear, his digestion perfect, and his\r\nstrength only a little impaired.[2120]\r\n\r\nNitrous oxide gas is one of the few gases that are not injurious to\r\nvegetables. Dr. Turner and I found that seventy-two cubic inches,\r\ndiluted with six times their volume of air, had no effect on a\r\nmignionette plant in forty-eight hours.[2121]\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Cyanogen Gas._—_Cyanogen gas_ has been proved by the\r\nexperiments of M. Coullon to be an active poison to all animals,—the\r\nguinea-pig, sparrow, leech, frog, wood-louse, fly, crab; and the\r\nsymptoms induced were coma, and more rarely convulsions.[2122] These\r\nresults are confirmed by the later experiments of Hünefeld, who found\r\nthat it produces in the rabbit anxious breathing, slight convulsions,\r\nstaring of the eyes, dilated pupils, coma, and death in five or six\r\nminutes.[2123] Buchner likewise found that small birds, held for a few\r\nseconds over the mouth of a jar containing cyanogen, died very speedily;\r\nand on one occasion remarked, while preparing the gas, that the\r\nfore-finger, which was exposed to the bubbles as they escaped, became\r\nsuddenly benumbed, and that this effect was attended with a singular\r\nfeeling of pressure and contraction in the joints of the thumb and\r\nelbow.[2124] It would undoubtedly be most dangerous to breathe this gas,\r\nexcept much diluted, and in very small quantity.\r\n\r\nOf all narcotic gases it is the most noxious to vegetables. Dr. Turner\r\nand I found that a third of a cubic inch, diluted with 1700 times its\r\nvolume of air, caused the leaves of a mignionette plant to droop in\r\ntwenty-four hours. As usual with the effects of narcotic gases on\r\nvegetables, the drooping went on after the plant was removed into the\r\nopen air; and in a short time it was completely killed.[2125]\r\n\r\n_Of Poisoning with Oxygen Gas._—Of all the narcotic gases, none is\r\nmore singular in its effects than oxygen. When breathed in a state of\r\npurity by animals, they live much longer than in the same volume of\r\natmospheric air. But if the experiment be kept up for a sufficient\r\nlength of time, symptoms of narcotic poisoning begin to manifest\r\nthemselves. For an hour no inconvenience seems to be felt; but the\r\nbreathing and pulse then become accelerated; a state of debility next\r\nensues; at length insensibility gradually comes on, with glazing of\r\nthe eyes, slow respiration and gasping; coma is in the end completely\r\nformed; and death ensues in the course of six, ten, or twelve hours.\r\nIf the animals are removed into the air before the insensibility is\r\nconsiderable, they quickly recover. When the body is examined\r\nimmediately after death, the heart is seen beating strongly, but the\r\ndiaphragm motionless; the whole blood in the veins as well as the\r\narteries is of a bright scarlet colour; some of the membranous\r\nsurfaces, such as the pulmonary pleura, have the same tint, and the\r\nblood coagulates with remarkable rapidity. The gas in which an animal\r\nhas died rekindles a blown out taper. These experiments, which\r\nphysiology owes to the researches of Mr. Broughton,[2126] furnish a\r\nsolitary example of death from stoppage of the respiration, although\r\nthe heart continues to pulsate, and the lungs to transmit florid\r\nblood. Death is probably owing to hyper-arterialization of the blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n                              CLASS THIRD.\r\n                 OF NARCOTICO-ACRID POISONS GENERALLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third class of poisons, the narcotico-acrids, includes those which\r\npossess a double action, the one local and irritating like that of the\r\nirritants, the other remote, and consisting of an impression on the\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\nSometimes they cause narcotism; which is generally of a comatose nature,\r\noften attended with delirium; but in one very singular group there is\r\nneither insensibility nor delirium, but merely violent tetanic spasms.\r\n\r\nAt other times they excite inflammation where they are applied. This\r\neffect, however, is by no means constant. For Orfila justly observes,\r\nthat under the name of narcotico-acrids several poisons are usually\r\ndescribed which seldom excite inflammation. Those which inflame the\r\ntissues where they are applied rarely occasion death in this manner.\r\nSome of them may produce very violent local symptoms; but they generally\r\nprove fatal through their operation on the nervous system.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, their narcotic and irritant effects appear\r\nincompatible. That is, when they act narcotically, the body is\r\ninsensible to the local irritation; and when they irritate, the dose is\r\nnot large enough to act narcotically. In large doses, therefore, they\r\nact chiefly as narcotics, in small doses as irritants. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, the narcotic symptoms are preceded or followed by symptoms of\r\nirritation; and more rarely both exist simultaneously.\r\n\r\nMost, if not all, of them, to whatever part of the body they are\r\napplied, act remotely by entering the blood-vessels; but it has not been\r\nsettled whether they operate by being carried with the blood to the part\r\non which they act, or by producing on the inner membrane of the vessels\r\na peculiar impression, which is conveyed along the nerves. Some of them\r\nproduce direct and obvious effects where they are applied. Thus\r\nmonkshood induces a peculiar numbness and tingling of the part with\r\nwhich it is placed in contact. The organs on which they act remotely are\r\nthe brain and spine, and sometimes the heart also.\r\n\r\nThe appearances in the dead body are, for the most part, inconsiderable;\r\nmore or less inflammation in the stomach or intestines, and congestion\r\nin the brain; but even these are not constant.\r\n\r\nAs a distinct class, they differ little from some poisons of the\r\nprevious classes. Several of the metallic irritants, and a few vegetable\r\nacrids are, properly speaking, narcotico-acrids: they excite either\r\nnarcotism or irritation, according to circumstances. But still, the\r\npoisons about to be considered form a good natural order when contrasted\r\nwith these irritants. For the irritants which possess a double action\r\nare nevertheless characterized by the symptoms of inflammation being at\r\nleast their most prominent effects; while the most prominent feature in\r\nthe effects of the poisons now to be considered is injury of the nervous\r\nsystem. It is more difficult to draw the line of separation between the\r\npresent class and the pure narcotics; for many narcotico-acrids rarely\r\ncause any symptom but those of narcotism.\r\n\r\nThe narcotico-acrids are all derived from the vegetable kingdom. Many of\r\nthem owe their power to an alkaloid, consisting of oxygen, hydrogen,\r\ncarbon, and azote.\r\n\r\nThe characters which distinguish the symptoms and morbid appearances of\r\nthe narcotico-acrids from those of natural disease, do not require\r\nspecial mention; for almost all the remarks made in the introduction to\r\nthe class of narcotics are applicable to the present class also. A few\r\nof the characters, however, which have been laid down, do not apply so\r\nwell to the narcotico-acrids as to the narcotics. In particular, it\r\nappears that what was said on the short duration of the effects of the\r\nnarcotics does not apply so well to the present class of poisons; some\r\nof which, in a single dose, continue to cause symptoms even of narcotism\r\nfor two or three days. But the rule, that they seldom prove fatal if the\r\ncase lasts above twelve hours, is still applicable,—at all events they\r\nrarely prove fatal after that interval by their narcotic action. The\r\npoisonous fungi, however, have proved fatal as narcotics so late as\r\nthirty-six hours, or even three days, after they were taken; and perhaps\r\ndigitalis has proved fatal narcotically at the remote period of three\r\nweeks. But such cases are extremely rare.\r\n\r\nSome narcotico-acids, such as the different species of _strychnos_, are\r\nquite peculiar in their effects; so that their symptoms may be\r\ndistinguished at once from natural disease.\r\n\r\nOrfila divides the narcotico-acrids into six groups, and this\r\narrangement will be followed in the present work; but they are not all\r\nvery well distinguished from one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n        OF POISONING WITH NIGHTSHADE, THORN-APPLE, AND TOBACCO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first group of the narcotico-acrids comprehends these whose\r\nprincipal symptom in the early stage of their effects is delirium. All\r\nthe plants of the group belong to the natural order _Solanaceæ_, and\r\nLinnæus’s class Pentandria Monogynia. Those which have been particularly\r\nexamined are deadly nightshade, thorn-apple, and tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Of Poisoning with Deadly Nightshade._\r\n\r\nThe deadly nightshade, or _Atropa belladonna_, is allied in\r\nphysiological and botanical characters to the _hyoscyamus_ and _solanum_\r\nformerly mentioned; and by the older writers, indeed, was confounded\r\nwith the latter. It is a native of Britain, growing in shady places,\r\nparticularly on the edge of woods. The berries, which ripen in\r\nSeptember, have a jet-black colour. Their beauty has frequently tempted\r\nboth children and adults to eat them, although they have a mawkish\r\ntaste; and many have suffered severely. It is not the berry alone which\r\nis poisonous; the whole plant is so; and the root is probably the most\r\nactive part.[2127] From one to four grains of the dried powder of the\r\nroot will occasion dryness in the throat, giddiness, staggering, flushed\r\nface, dilated pupils, and sometimes even delirium.[2128] The juice of\r\nthe leaves is very energetic, two grains of its extract being, when well\r\nprepared, a large enough dose to cause disagreeable symptoms in man. It\r\nis a very uncertain preparation, unless when procured by evaporation _in\r\nvacuo_; for some samples from the Parisian shops have been found by\r\nOrfila to be quite inert.\r\n\r\nIt contains a peculiar alkaloid, named _atropia_. In the belladonna\r\nBrandes obtained a volatile, oily-like, alkaloidal fluid, of a\r\npenetrating narcotic smell, and bitterish, acrid taste, which he\r\nsupposed to be the active principle of the plant.[2129] The ulterior\r\nresearches of Geiger and Hesse, however, as well as the simultaneous\r\nanalysis of Mein, have proved that this fluid is not the pure alkaloid\r\nof belladonna, and that the real atropia is a solid substance, forming\r\ncolourless, silky crystals, soluble in ether and alcohol, sparingly so\r\nin water, slightly bitter, liable to decomposition under contact with\r\nair and moisture, volatilizable, but with some decomposition, a little\r\nabove 212°, and capable of forming definite crystallizable salts with\r\nacids.[2130] The aqueous solutions of its salts exhale during\r\nevaporation a narcotic vapour, which dilates the pupil, and causes\r\nsickness, giddiness, and headache.[2131]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary extract of belladonna in the dose of half an ounce will\r\nkill a dog in thirty hours when introduced into the stomach. Half that\r\nquantity applied to a wound will kill it in twenty-four hours. And\r\nforty grains injected into the jugular vein prove even more quickly\r\nfatal. Convulsions are rarely produced, but only a state like\r\nintoxication.[2132]\r\n\r\nThe oleaginous atropia of Brandes in a dose of two or three drops kill\r\nsmall birds instantaneously like concentrated hydrocyanic acid; in less\r\ndoses it occasions staggering, gasping, and in a few minutes death\r\namidst convulsions; and the dead body presents throughout the internal\r\norgans great venous turgescence and even extravasation of blood, but\r\nmore especially excessive congestion within the head.[2133] The pure\r\ncrystalline atropia of Mein, when dissolved in water and greatly\r\ndiluted, causes extreme and protracted dilatation of the pupils.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Man._—On man the effects of belladonna are much more\r\nremarkable. In small doses, whatever be the kind or surface to which it\r\nis applied,—such as the skin round the eye, or the surface of a wound,\r\nor the inner membrane of the stomach,—it causes dilatation of the pupil.\r\nThis effect may be excited without any constitutional derangement. When\r\nthe extract is rubbed on the skin round the eye, or a solution of it\r\ndropped upon the eyeball, vision is not impaired; but when it is taken\r\ninternally so as to affect the pupils, the sight is commonly much\r\nobscured. The effects of large or poisonous doses have been frequently\r\nwitnessed in consequence of children and adults being tempted to eat the\r\nberries by their fine colour and bright lustre. From the cases that have\r\nbeen published the leading symptoms appear in the first instance to be\r\ndryness in the throat, then delirium with dilated pupils, and afterwards\r\ncoma. Convulsions are rare, and, when present, slight.\r\n\r\nThe dryness of the throat is not a constant symptom. It is often,\r\nhowever, very distinct. It occurred, for example, in 150 soldiers who\r\nwere poisoned near Dresden, as related by M. Gaultier de Claubry,[2134]\r\nand in six soldiers whose cases have been described by Mr.\r\nBrumwell.[2135] The former had not only dryness of the throat, but\r\nlikewise difficulty in swallowing.\r\n\r\nThe delirium is generally extravagant, and also most commonly of the\r\npleasing kind, sometimes accompanied with immoderate uncontrollable\r\nlaughter, sometimes with constant talking, but occasionally with\r\ncomplete loss of voice, as in the cases of the 150 soldiers. At other\r\ntimes the state of mind resembles somnambulism, as in the instance of a\r\ntailor who was poisoned with a belladonna injection, and who for fifteen\r\nhours, though speechless and insensible to external objects, went\r\nthrough all the customary operations of his trade with great vivacity,\r\nand moved his lips as if in conversation.[2136] Sometimes frantic\r\ndelirium is almost the only symptom of consequence throughout the whole\r\nduration of the poisoning. Thus a gentleman at Perigueux in France, who\r\ntook by mistake a mixture containing a drachm and a half of extract, was\r\nattacked in half an hour with delirium, which soon became furious, and\r\ncontinued till next day, when it gradually left him.[2137] In others the\r\ndelirium is attended with a singular and total loss of consciousness,\r\nbut without coma, as in the following case which occurred not long ago\r\nat St. Omer. A young man having taken by mistake an infusion of two\r\ndrachms of dried leaves, was seized in an hour with great dryness of the\r\nmouth and throat, afterwards slight delirium, loss of consciousness, and\r\ndilatation of the pupil, next with retention of urine, convulsive\r\ntwitches of the face and extremities, and incessant tendency to walk up\r\nand down. In three hours, after the action of an emetic and a clyster,\r\nhe lay down, but still in a state of total unconsciousness and muttering\r\ndelirium. Blood-letting being at last resorted to as a remedy, he\r\nspeedily recovered his senses, and eventually got well, after suffering\r\nfor some time from headache, fatigue, and much debility.[2138]\r\n\r\nThe pupil is not only dilated in all cases, but likewise for the most\r\npart insensible;[2139] and, as in the soldiers at Dresden, the eyeball\r\nis sometimes red and prominent. The vision also, as in these soldiers,\r\nis generally obscure; sometimes it is lost for a time;[2140] and so\r\ncompletely that even the brightest light cannot be distinguished.[2141]\r\n\r\nThe sopor or lethargy, which follows the delirium, occasionally does not\r\nsupervene for a considerable interval. In a case related by Munnik it\r\ndid not begin till twelve hours after the poison was taken.[2142]\r\nSometimes, as in the same case, the delirium returns when the stupor\r\ngoes off. A patient of my colleague Dr. Simpson, after using a\r\nbelladonna suppository consisting of two grains of extract, was attacked\r\nwith dryness of the throat and delirium, followed soon by drowsiness and\r\nstupor; and in five or six hours more, as the stupor wore off, the\r\ndelirium returned, prompting to constant movements as if she was busy\r\nwith her toilette and various other ordinary occupations. Sometimes the\r\nrelation of the delirium to the coma is reversed, as in a case related\r\nby Mr. Clayton, where sopor came on first, and delirium ensued in six\r\nhours. The dose in this instance was forty grains of the extract.[2143]\r\nFrequently the stupor is not distinct at any stage.—Even the delirium is\r\nnot always formed rapidly. A man whose case is described by Sir John\r\nHill did not become giddy for two hours after eating the berries, and\r\nthe delirium did not appear till five hours later.[2144] In Mr.\r\nBrumwell’s cases, the delirium was not particularly noticed till the\r\nmorning after the berries were taken.\r\n\r\nConvulsions, it has been already stated, are rare. In the case from the\r\n24th volume of Sedillot’s Journal, the muscles of the face were somewhat\r\nconvulsed: there is also at times more or less locked-jaw,[2145] or\r\nsubsultus tendinum;[2146] and occasionally much abrupt agitation of the\r\nextremities.[2147] But well-marked convulsions do not appear to be ever\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe effects now detailed are by no means so quickly dissipated as those\r\nof opium. Almost every person who has taken a considerable dose has been\r\nill for a day at least. The case from Sedillot’s Journal lasted three\r\ndays, delirium having continued twelve hours, the succeeding stupor for\r\nnearly two days, and the departure of the stupor being attended with a\r\nreturn of delirium for some hours longer. One of Mr. Brumwell’s\r\npatients, too, was delirious for three days; and Plenck has noticed\r\nseveral instances where the delirium was equally tedious.[2148] Sage has\r\nrelated a case in which the individual was comatose for thirty\r\nhours.[2149] Blindness is also a very obstinate symptom, which sometimes\r\nremains after the affection of the mind has disappeared. This happened\r\nin Plenck’s cases. In two children whose cases have been described in a\r\nlate French journal, the eyes were insensible to the brightest light for\r\nthree days.[2150] In general, the dilated state of the pupils continues\r\nlong after the other symptoms have departed. It further appears from an\r\nofficial narrative in Rust’s Journal, that dilated pupil is not the only\r\nsymptom which may thus continue, but that various nervous affections,\r\nsuch as giddiness, disordered vision, and tremors, may prevail even for\r\nthree or four weeks.[2151]\r\n\r\nHitherto little or no mention has been made of symptoms of irritation\r\nfrom this poison. They are in fact uncommon, and seldom violent. In the\r\ncases related by Gaultier de Claubry and by Mr. Brumwell, dryness and\r\nsoreness of the throat and difficult deglutition were remarked, and\r\nappear not unusual. These symptoms were especially noticed by Buchner,\r\nwho by way of curiosity took half a drachm of seeds digested in beer.\r\nThe sense of dryness and constriction of the throat were such as to\r\nprevent him swallowing even the saliva.[2152] Sage’s patient passed\r\nblood by stool; and after the symptoms of narcotic poisoning ceased, he\r\nhad aphthous inflammation in the throat, and swallowing was so difficult\r\nas for some time to excite convulsive struggles. Aphthæ in the throat\r\nand swelling of the belly also succeeded the delirium in Munnik’s case.\r\nMr. Wibmer alludes to the case of a man who, besides difficult\r\ndeglutition at the beginning, had violent strangury towards the\r\nclose.[2153] An instance of violent strangury with suppression of urine\r\nand bloody micturition is also related by M. Jolly. In the early stage,\r\nthe patient had redness of the throat and burning along the whole\r\nalimentary canal, combined with the customary delirium and loss of\r\nconsciousness. The symptoms were caused by forty-six grains of the\r\nextract given by mistake instead of jalap.[2154] Nausea and efforts to\r\nvomit are not infrequent at the commencement.\r\n\r\nIf the accident be taken in time, poisoning with belladonna is rarely\r\nfatal; for, as the state first induced is delirium, not sopor, suspicion\r\nis soon excited, and emetics may be made to act before a sufficient\r\nquantity of the poison has been absorbed to prove fatal. Hence few fatal\r\ninstances have occurred in recent times. Mr. Wilmer, however, has\r\nmentioned two fatal cases occurring in children, and terminating within\r\ntwenty-four hours.[2155] M. Boucher, a writer in the old French Journal\r\nof Medicine, has referred to several cases of the same nature;[2156]\r\nGmelin has described the particulars of a good example;[2157] and many\r\nothers have been succinctly quoted by Wibmer, chiefly from the older\r\nauthors.[2158]\r\n\r\nCases of poisoning with this plant have occurred in man through other\r\nchannels besides the stomach. Allusion has already been made to the\r\ninstance of a tailor who was poisoned by an injection. A small quantity\r\nwill sometimes suffice when administered in that way. A woman, whose\r\ncase is mentioned in Rust’s Journal, was attacked with wild delirium,\r\nflushed face and glistening eyes, in consequence of receiving, during\r\nlabour, a clyster, that contained six grains of the common\r\nextract;[2159] and Dr. Simpson’s patient, who was severely affected, had\r\nonly two grains.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the berry is in some circumstances not very active. A French\r\nphysician, M. Gigault of Pontcroix, says he has frequently had occasion\r\nto treat cases of poisoning with it, as accidents of the kind are\r\nextremely common in his neighbourhood; that he never knew it prove\r\nfatal; and that in one instance a young man took a pound of the berries\r\nbefore going to bed, and was not subjected to treatment till next\r\nmorning, when he was found in a state of delirium, but speedily\r\nrecovered after the free operation of emetics.[2160]\r\n\r\n_Morbid Appearances._—I have hitherto seen but one good account of the\r\nappearances after death from poisoning with belladonna. It is described\r\nby Gmelin. The subject was a shepherd who died comatose twelve hours\r\nafter eating the berries. When the body was examined twelve hours after\r\ndeath, putrefaction had begun, so that the belly was swelled, the\r\nscrotum and penis distended with fetid serum, the skin covered with dark\r\nvesicles, and the brain soft. The blood-vessels of the head were gorged,\r\nand the blood every where fluid, and flowing profusely from the mouth,\r\nnose, and eyes.[2161] In the only other fatal case I have read, where\r\nthe body was inspected, there appears to have been no unusual appearance\r\nat all.[2162]\r\n\r\nAs the husks and seeds of the berries are very indigestible, some of\r\nthem will almost certainly be found in the stomach, as happened in the\r\ninstance last quoted. It should likewise be remembered that the best\r\npossible evidence of the cause of the symptoms may be derived during\r\nlife from the presence of the seeds, husks, or even entire berries, in\r\nthe discharges. If vomiting has not been brought on at an early\r\nperiod, we may expect to find these remains both in the vomited matter\r\nand in the alvine evacuations. Mr. Wilmer mentions an instance in\r\nwhich the black husks appeared in the stools brought away by laxatives\r\nat least thirty hours after the poison was swallowed.[2163] One of Mr.\r\nBrumwell’s patients vomited the seeds towards the close of the third\r\nday.[2164] Several patients of M. Boucher vomited fragments of the\r\nfruit on the second day, and passed more by stool and injections on\r\nthe third, although they had been treated with activity from the\r\ncommencement.[2165]\r\n\r\nWhile most of the cases of poisoning with belladonna have originated in\r\naccident, at the same time they have not been all of this description.\r\nGmelin has quoted an instance of intentional and fatal poisoning by the\r\njuice of the berries being mixed with wine; and another singular case of\r\npoisoning with the decoction of the buds, given by an old woman for the\r\npurpose of committing theft during the stupor of the individual.[2166]\r\n\r\nOther species of atropa are probably similar to belladonna in\r\nproperties. Wibmer quotes a single instance of frantic delirium\r\noccurring among several shepherds, as well as their cattle, from eating\r\nthe herb of the _A. mandragora_.[2167] This is well known to have been\r\nused anciently as a medicinal narcotic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Of Poisoning with Thorn-Apple._\r\n\r\nThe thorn-apple, or _Datura stramonium_, is another plant of the same\r\nnatural order, which it is proper to notice, because people have often\r\nbeen poisoned with it, and it has become a common ornament of our\r\ngardens. The cases of poisoning which have occurred in recent times in\r\nthis country have been all accidental. But not long ago the thorn-apple\r\nappears to have been extensively used in Germany to cause loss of\r\nconsciousness and lethargy, preparatory to the commission of various\r\ncrimes.[2168] It was also proved to have been used lately in France for\r\nthis purpose. Some thieves made a man insensible with wine in which\r\nstramonium seeds had been steeped, and robbed him of five hundred francs\r\nwhile in this state. For twenty-four hours the victim knew nothing of\r\nwhat became of him; he was met wandering in a wood, affected with\r\ndelirium, unconsciousness, staring of the eyes, and oppression of the\r\nbreathing; and for some time he was taken for a madman.[2169] In the\r\nEastern Archipelago, according to Mr. Crawford, this is a common mode of\r\ncommitting theft and robbery.[2170]\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly the fruit and seeds that have hitherto been examined; but\r\nthe whole plant is probably poisonous. Brandes discovered in it a\r\nvolatile, oleaginous, alkaline substance, which he supposed to be its\r\nactive principle.[2171] But, though his observations were confirmed by\r\nBley,[2172] it now appears that the real principle is a colourless,\r\ncrystalline alkaloidal substance, of an acrid taste like tobacco, which\r\nwas discovered more lately by Geiger and Hesse; this is named daturine,\r\nor daturia.[2173]\r\n\r\nThe physiological effects of the extract have been determined by Orfila.\r\nHe found that half an ounce killed a dog within twenty-four hours after\r\nbeing swallowed, that a quarter of an ounce applied to a wound killed\r\nanother in six hours, and that thirty grains killed another when\r\ninjected into the jugular vein. The symptoms were purely nervous, and\r\nnot very prominent. Hence this poison, like the former, acts through the\r\nblood-vessels, and probably on the brain.[2174] Bley’s daturia proves\r\nquickly fatal to small animals in the dose of a few drops. The\r\ncrystalline daturia of Geiger and Hesse kills a sparrow in the dose of\r\nan eighth of a grain, and occasions great and persistent dilatation of\r\nthe pupil when applied to the eye.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Man._—The symptoms produced by a poisonous dose in man are\r\nvariable. The leading features are great delirium, dilatation of the\r\npupils, and stupor; but sometimes spasms occur, and occasionally palsy.\r\n\r\nDr. Fowler has related the case of a little girl who took a drachm and a\r\nhalf of the seeds. In less than two hours she was attacked with maniacal\r\ndelirium, accompanied with spectral illusions; and she remained in this\r\nstate most of the following night, but had some intervals of lethargic\r\nsleep. Next morning, after the operation of a laxative, she fell fast\r\nasleep, and after some hours she awoke quite well.[2175] In a case\r\nsomewhat like this, related in Henke’s Journal, the child had general\r\nredness of the skin, swelling of the belly, locked jaw, tremors of the\r\nextremities, and an attitude and expression as if about to tumble into a\r\npit. Recovery took place after the action of an emetic.[2176]\r\n\r\nIn two instances, one related by Vicat in his treatise on the poisonous\r\nplants of Switzerland,[2177] the other by Dr. Swaine[2178] in the Edin.\r\nPhys. and Lit. Essays, the leading symptoms were furious delirium and\r\npalsy of the whole extremities. In the instances of three children\r\nrelated by Alibert there were delirium, restlessness, constant\r\nincoherent talking, dancing and singing, with fever and flushed\r\nface.[2179] In another recorded by Dr. Young, there were some\r\nconvulsions, and livid suffusion of the countenance.[2180] In an\r\ninstance communicated to me by my colleague Dr. Traill, where eighteen\r\nor twenty grains of extract of stramonium were taken by mistake for\r\nsarsaparilla, the symptoms were dryness of the throat immediately\r\nafterwards, then giddiness, dilated pupils, flushed face, glancing of\r\nthe eyes, and incoherence, so that he seemed to his friends to be\r\nintoxicated: and subsequently there was incessant unconnected talking,\r\nlike that of demency. Emetics were given without effect, and little\r\namendment was obtained from blood-letting, leeches on the temples, cold\r\nto the head, or purgatives. But after a glass of strong lemonade\r\nvomiting took place, the symptoms began to recede, in ten hours he\r\nrecognized those around him, and next day he was pretty well. Kaauw\r\nBoerhaave has related with great minuteness the case of a girl who very\r\nnearly lost her life in consequence of a man having given her the powder\r\nin coffee with the view of seducing her. The symptoms were redness of\r\nthe features, delirium, nymphomania, loss of speech; then fixing of the\r\neyes, tremors, convulsions, and coma; afterwards tetanic spasm and slow\r\nrespiration with the coma. She was with much difficulty roused for a\r\ntime by the operation of emetics, and eventually got well after her\r\nlethargy had lasted nearly a day.[2181] In another related in Rust’s\r\nMagazin, and caused by a decoction of the fruit, which was mistaken for\r\nthistle-heads, the leading symptoms were spasmodic closing of the\r\neyelids and jaws, spasms also of the back, complete coma, and excessive\r\ndilatation and insensibility of the pupil.[2182] This case, which seems\r\nto have been a very dangerous one, was rapidly cured by free\r\nblood-letting. Blood-letting, indeed, seems peculiarly called for in\r\npoisoning with thorn-apple, on account of the strong signs of\r\ndetermination of blood to the head.—Gmelin has quoted several fatal\r\ncases, one of which endured for six hours only;[2183] and Dr. Young\r\nsays, that a child has been killed by a single apple.[2184] The most\r\ncomplete account yet published of the phenomena of poisoning with\r\nstramonium when fatal is given by Mr. Duffin of London. A child of his\r\nown, two years old, swallowed about 100 seeds without chewing them. Soon\r\nafter she became fretful and like a person intoxicated; in the course of\r\nan hour efforts to vomit ensued, together with flushed face, dilated\r\npupils, incoherent talking, and afterwards wild spectral illusions and\r\nfurious delirium. In two hours and a half she lost her voice and the\r\npower of swallowing, evidently owing to spasms of the throat. Then\r\ncroupy breathing and complete coma set in, with violent spasmodic\r\nagitation of the limbs, occasional tetanic convulsions, warm\r\nperspiration, and yet an imperceptible pulse. Subsequently the pulse\r\nbecame extremely rapid, the belly tympanitic, and the bladder paralyzed,\r\nbut with frequent involuntary stools, probably owing to the\r\nadministration of cathartics; and death took place in twenty-four hours.\r\nAt an early period twenty seeds were discharged by an emetic: the stools\r\ncontained eighty; and none were found in the alimentary canal after\r\ndeath. There was never any marked sign of congestion of blood in the\r\nhead, except flushed face at the beginning.[2185] Dr. Droste of Osnaburg\r\nhas related a fatal case occasioned by a decoction of 125 seeds given to\r\nremove colic. In fifteen minutes the patient became delirious, but soon\r\nfell apparently fast asleep, and died in seven hours without again\r\nawaking.[2186]\r\n\r\nDangerous effects may result from the application of the thorn-apple to\r\nthe skin when deprived of the cuticle. An instance has been lately\r\npublished of alarming narcotism from the application of the leaves to an\r\nextensive burn.[2187]\r\n\r\n_Morbid Appearances._—As to the _morbid appearances_, Droste found in\r\nhis case redness of the cardiac end of the stomach, which contained two\r\ntable-spoonfuls of a pulpy matter mixed with black and white grains, the\r\nremains of the teguments of the seeds; and there was also lividity of\r\nthe back, lividity of the lungs, emptiness of the cavities of the heart,\r\nand gorging of the vessels of the brain. Haller says he once found\r\ngeneral congestion of the brain and sinuses,[2188]—an appearance which\r\nmay naturally be expected, considering the signs of strong determination\r\nof blood towards the head, which often prevail during life. In Mr.\r\nDuffin’s case, however, the brain was healthy, not congested; the\r\nstomach and intestines presented no morbid appearance; and the only\r\nunusual appearances observed were a slight blush over the pharynx,\r\nlarynx, and upper third of the gullet, thickening and swelling of the\r\nrima glottidis, and a semi-coagulated state of the blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Of Poisoning with Tobacco._\r\n\r\nA plant of the same natural order with the two former, tobacco, the\r\n_Nicotiana tabacum_ of botanists, is familiarly known to be in certain\r\ncircumstances a virulent poison. Every part of the plant possesses\r\nactive properties. It has been used as a poison in this country for\r\ncriminal purposes.\r\n\r\n_Vauquelin_ analyzed it some time ago, and procured an acrid volatile\r\nprinciple which he called nicotine.[2189] This substance, which was\r\nafterwards obtained in a purer state as a crystalline body by\r\nHermbstädt, has been more recently ascertained by MM. Posselt and\r\nReimarus to be nothing else than essential oil of tobacco, which is sold\r\nat ordinary temperatures; and they succeeded in procuring another\r\nprinciple which they consider the true nicotina. This is fluid at 29°\r\nF., volatile, extremely acrid, alkaline, and capable of forming\r\ncrystallizable salts with some of the acids.[2190] Tobacco then appears\r\nto contain an acrid alkaline principle, and an essential oil to which\r\nthe alkaloid adheres with great obstinacy. The relation of the\r\nempyreumatic oil of tobacco to these principles has not been accurately\r\nascertained, though it probably contains one or other of them. It is\r\nwell known to be an active poison, which produces convulsions, coma and\r\ndeath. Mr. Morries-Stirling found that its active part is removed from\r\nthe oil by washing with weak acetic acid, as he also observed in the\r\ninstance of similar oils obtained from various narcotic\r\nvegetables.[2191]\r\n\r\n_Process for detecting Tobacco in Organic mixtures._—In a medico-legal\r\ncase which happened at Aberdeen in 1834, and of which some notice is\r\ntaken at page 651, Dr. Ogston of that city successfully employed the\r\nfollowing process for detecting tobacco in the contents of the stomach.\r\nThe contents, consisting of a pulpy fluid, were acidulated with acetic\r\nacid, digested, and filtered; the liquid was treated with diacetate of\r\nlead, filtered again, freed of lead by hydrosulphuric acid, filtered a\r\nthird time, treated with caustic potash, and then allowed to settle. The\r\nsupernatant liquid, which had the taste of tobacco-juice, was separated\r\nand distilled to half its volume. The distilled liquor had a strong\r\ntobacco odour and taste, and some acridity, and gave a precipitate with\r\ninfusion of galls. The residuum in the retort presented oily particles\r\non its surface, and when heated in an open basin filled the apartment\r\nwith a vapour which had a strong odour of tobacco smoke, and caused in\r\nseveral persons present a sense of acridity of the throat, watering of\r\nthe eyes, and tendency to sneeze. Various additional experiments\r\nconfirmatory of these results were also performed; and a simultaneous\r\nexamination of tobacco-powder gave precisely the same indications. I am\r\nindebted to Dr. Ogston for these particulars and a detailed narrative of\r\nhis investigation; which appears to supply a convenient and conclusive\r\nprocess for the detection of tobacco.—Perhaps the ordinary process for\r\nobtaining nicotina may also be employed with advantage. This consists in\r\ndistilling the suspected substance with caustic potash, neutralizing the\r\ndistilled liquor with sulphuric acid, concentrating the product to a\r\nthin syrup, exhausting this with etherized alcohol, evaporating off the\r\nsolvent, and distilling the extract with strong solution of potash.\r\nNicotina passes over, and may be recognized by its sensible and chemical\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nThe effects of tobacco are somewhat different from those of belladonna\r\nand thorn-apple; but it is here arranged with them, as it belongs to the\r\nsame natural family. Orfila remarked that 5½ drachms of common rappee,\r\nintroduced into the stomach of a dog and secured by a ligature, caused\r\nnausea, giddiness, stupor, twitches in the muscles of the neck, and\r\ndeath in nine hours; and that two drachms and a quarter applied to a\r\nwound proved fatal in a single hour. Mr. Blake thinks tobacco has no\r\ndirect action on the heart, even when admitted directly into the blood\r\nby the jugular vein;—that it acts primarily on the capillary circulation\r\nof the lungs, by obstructing which it prevents the blood from reaching\r\nthe left cavities of the heart, and thus acts on that organ indirectly.\r\nFor he observed, that laboured respiration always preceded any sign of\r\ndepressed action of the heart, that forcible action of the heart often\r\nreturned after its first cessation, and that its contractility continued\r\nafter death.[2192] An infusion of ten grains caused laborious breathing\r\nin ten seconds, and in twenty seconds temporary arrestment of the\r\nheart’s action, which then returned, and was attended for a time with\r\nincreased arterial pressure. Soon afterwards the animal recovered,\r\nwithout any convulsions or loss of sensibility. Two scruples had the\r\nsame effect. But when three drachms were used, convulsions succeeded\r\nsimilar phenomena, and death ensued in two minutes, the heart continuing\r\nto act for some time after respiration had ceased, until at length it\r\nwas stopped by the usual consequences of asphyxia.[2193] On the other\r\nhand, Sir B. Brodie found that the effects are very different, according\r\nto the form in which the poison is used. Thus four ounces of a strong\r\ninfusion, when injected into the anus of a dog, killed it in ten minutes\r\nby paralyzing the heart; for after death the blood in the aortal\r\ncavities was arterial. But the empyreumatic essential oil does not act\r\nin that manner: it excites convulsions and coma, without affecting the\r\nheart. It may prove fatal in two minutes.[2194] Like other violent\r\npoisons, tobacco has no effect when applied directly to the brain or\r\nnerves.[2195] Two drops of the alkaloid, nicotina, injected into the\r\njugular vein of a dog, begin to act in ten seconds, and will prove fatal\r\nin a minute and a half.[2196]\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Man._—The effects observed in man are allied to those\r\nproduced in dogs by the infusion. In a slight degree they are frequently\r\nwitnessed in young men, while making their first efforts to acquire the\r\nabsurd practice of smoking. The first symptoms are acceleration and\r\nstrengthening of the pulse, with very transient excitement, then sudden\r\ngiddiness, fainting and great sickness, accompanied with a weak,\r\nquivering pulse. These effects are for the most part transient and\r\ntrifling, but not always. Some degree of somnolency is not uncommon. Dr.\r\nMarshall Hall has given an interesting account of a young man who smoked\r\ntwo pipes for his first debauch, and in consequence was seized with\r\nnausea, vomiting, and syncope, then stupor, stertorous breathing,\r\ngeneral spasms and insensible pupils. Next day the tendency to faint\r\ncontinued, and in the evening the stupor, stertor and spasms returned;\r\nbut from that time he recovered steadily.[2197] Gmelin has quoted two\r\ncases of death from excessive smoking,—caused in one by seventeen, in\r\nthe other by eighteen pipes, smoked at a sitting.[2198] It is likewise\r\nmentioned by Lanzoni that an individual fell into a state of somnolency\r\nand died lethargic on the twelfth day in consequence of taking too much\r\nsnuff;[2199] Dr. Cheyne says, “he is convinced apoplexy is one of the\r\nevils in the train of that disgusting practice;”[2200] and I have met\r\nwith an instance where the excessive use of snuff, occasioned twice, at\r\ndistant intervals, an attack resembling imperfect apoplexy, united with\r\ndelirium. Such cases, however, must be admitted to be rare; and the\r\npractice of taking snuff is in general unattended with injury.\r\n\r\nSerious consequences have resulted from the application of tobacco to\r\nthe abraded skin. In the Ephemerides an account is given of three\r\nchildren who were seized with giddiness, vomiting, and fainting from the\r\napplication of tobacco-leaves to the head for the cure of\r\nring-worm.[2201] Dr. Merriman has also alluded to an instance of death\r\nin a child from the incautious employment of a strong decoction of\r\ntobacco as a lotion for ring-worm of the scalp.[2202] And in Leroux’s\r\nJournal there is an account of a man, who, after using a tobacco\r\ndecoction for the cure of an eruptive disease, was seized with symptoms\r\nof poisoning, and died in three hours.[2203]\r\n\r\nIn recent times poisoning with tobacco has been often produced by the\r\nemployment of too large doses in the way of injection. Richard has\r\nmentioned a case, not fatal, which arose from an infusion of five leaves\r\nin a choppin of water, used as an injection by a lady for costiveness.\r\nShe was immediately seized with colic, giddiness, buzzing in the ears,\r\nheadache, nausea, and then syncope of seven hours’ duration. During this\r\nperiod the breathing was difficult, the pulse very slow, the pupils\r\ndilated, the skin cold and moist, the urine suppressed, the efforts to\r\nvomit constant, and the belly depressed, contracted, and affected with\r\nconstant borborygmus. She recovered under the use of emollient\r\ninjections and fomentations.[2204] Dr. Grahl of Hamburg has related\r\nminutely a fatal case, which arose from an ounce of rather more, boiled\r\nfor fifteen minutes in water, and administered by advice of a female\r\nquack. The individual, who laboured merely under dyspepsia and obstinate\r\ncostiveness, was seized in two minutes with vomiting, violent\r\nconvulsions, and stertorous breathing, and died in three-quarters of an\r\nhour.[2205] Another accident of the same kind is noticed in the Journal\r\nde Chimie Médicale, where the person became as it were intoxicated, and\r\ndied immediately. Instead of an infusion of two drachms she had used a\r\ndecoction of two ounces.[2206]—M. Tavignot describes the following\r\nremarkable case occasioned by a similar dose. An infusion prepared by\r\nmistake with two ounces and one drachm, instead of a drachm and a half,\r\nwas used as an injection for a stout man affected with ascarides. In\r\nseven minutes he was seized with stupor, headache, paleness of the skin,\r\npain in the belly, indistinct articulation, and slight convulsive\r\ntremors, at first confined to the arms, but afterwards general. Extreme\r\nprostration and slow laborious breathing soon ensued, and then coma,\r\nwhich ended fatally in eighteen minutes.[2207]—Even two drachms,\r\nhowever, or a drachm and a half, are by no means a safe dose. An\r\nanonymous writer in the Medical and Surgical Journal says a patient of\r\nhis died in convulsions an hour or two after receiving a clyster\r\ncomposed of two drachms infused in eight ounces.[2208] Nay, in the Acta\r\nHelvetica there is an account by an anonymous writer of the case of a\r\nwoman, who, after an injection made with one drachm only, was seized\r\nwith pain in the belly, anxiety and faintings, proving fatal in a few\r\nhours.[2209] And a case, fatal in thirty-five minutes, which was\r\noccasioned by the same dose, occurred not long ago in Guy’s Hospital,\r\nLondon.[2210]\r\n\r\nTobacco is an equally deadly poison when swallowed in large quantity. M.\r\nCaillard has related the particulars of the case of a lunatic, who,\r\nhaving swallowed half an ounce of snuff during a lucid interval, was\r\nseized with vomiting, and afterwards with oppression, incoherence, cold\r\nsweats, a slow full pulse, and dilated pupils; but he slowly\r\nrecovered.[2211] The French poet Santeuil was killed in this way by a\r\npractical joker at the Prince of Condé’s table. When the bottle had\r\ncirculated rather freely, a boxful of Spanish snuff was emptied into a\r\nlarge glass of wine, and thus administered to the unlucky victim, who\r\nwas in consequence “attacked with vomiting and fever, and expired in two\r\ndays amidst the tortures of the damned.”[2212] The following important\r\ncase has been communicated to me by Dr. Ogston of Aberdeen, who was\r\nemployed in the judicial investigations connected with it. An elderly\r\nman, a pensioner, was seen to enter a brothel, while in perfect health;\r\nand in an hour he was carried out insensible and put down in a passage,\r\nwhere he was found by the police unable to speak or move. While carrying\r\nhim to the watch-house hard by, the officers observed him attempt to\r\nvomit; but he was scarcely laid down before the fire, when he expired.\r\nIt was ascertained, that he had drunk both rum and whisky in the\r\nbrothel, and that something had been given him “to stupefy him or set\r\nhim asleep.” On dissection the blood was found every where very fluid,\r\nand four ounces of serosity were collected from the lateral ventricles\r\nand base of the skull. But there was no other unusual appearance, except\r\nthat the stomach contained about four ounces of a thick brownish pulp,\r\nin which were seen several pellets of a powder resembling snuff. In\r\nthese contents Dr. Ogston could not detect any opium; but he detected\r\ntobacco by the process mentioned above. No doubt could exist that the\r\nman died of poisoning with tobacco; but as no evidence could be obtained\r\nto inculpate any one in particular of many individuals who were in the\r\nbrothel with him, the case was not made the subject of trial.\r\n\r\nEvidence is not wanting, therefore, to prove that this plant is a very\r\nactive poison; yet every one knows that under the influence of habit it\r\nis used in immense quantities over the whole world as an article of\r\nluxury, without any bad effect having ever been clearly traced to it.\r\nIts poisonous qualities were known in Europe as soon as it was brought\r\nfrom America; and the belief that such properties could not fail to be\r\nattended, as in the case of spirits and opium, with evil consequences\r\nfrom its habitual use, led to much opposition on the part of various\r\ngovernments to its introduction. Soon after it was brought to England by\r\nSir W. Raleigh, King James wrote a philippic against it, entitled “The\r\nCounter-blaste to Tobacco.” Some countries even prohibited it by severe\r\nedicts. Amurath the 4th in particular made the smoking of tobacco\r\ncapital; several of the Popes excommunicated those who smoked in the\r\nchurch of St. Peter’s; in Russia it was punished with amputation of the\r\nnose; and in the Canton of Bern it ranked in the tables next to\r\nadultery, and even so lately as the middle of last century a particular\r\ncourt was held there for trying delinquents.[2213] Like every other\r\npersecuted novelty, however, smoking and snuff-taking passed from place\r\nto place with rapidity; and now there appear to be only two luxuries\r\nwhich yield to it in prevalence, spirituous liquors and tea.\r\n\r\nThe only accounts I have seen of the morbid appearances after poisoning\r\nwith tobacco are contained in the cases of Dr. Grahl and Dr. Ogston. In\r\nthe former there was great lividity of the back, paleness of the lips,\r\nflexibility of the joints (two days after death), diffuse redness of the\r\nomentum without gorging of vessels, similar redness with gorging of\r\nvessels both on the outer and inner coats of the intestines, in some\r\nparts of the mucous coat patches of extravasation, unusual emptiness of\r\nthe vessels of the abdomen; while the stomach was natural, the lungs\r\npale, the heart empty in all its cavities, and the brain natural. The\r\nappearances in Dr. Ogston’s case have been already stated.\r\n\r\nWriters on the diseases of artisans have made many vague statements on\r\nthe supposed baneful effects of the manufacture of snuff on the\r\nworkmen.[2214] It is said they are liable to bronchitis, dysentery,\r\nophthalmia, carbuncles and furuncles. At a meeting of the Royal Medical\r\nSociety of Paris, however, before which a memoir to this purport was\r\nread, the facts were contradicted by reference to the state of the\r\nworkmen at the Royal Snuff Manufactory of Gros-Caillou, where 1000\r\npeople are constantly employed without detriment to their health.[2215]\r\nThis subject was afterwards investigated with care by MM.\r\nParent-Duchatelet and D’Arcet, who inquired minutely into the state of\r\nthe workmen employed at all the great tobacco-manufactories of France,\r\ncomprising a population of above 4000 persons; and the results at which\r\nthey arrived are,—that the workmen very easily become habituated to the\r\natmosphere of the manufactory,—that they are not particularly subject\r\neither to special diseases, or to disease generally,—and that they live\r\non an average quite as long as other tradesmen.[2216] These facts are\r\nderived from accurate statistical returns, showing the number of days\r\neach person was annually off work from sickness, the ages at which\r\nsuperannuated allowances were granted, the period of death, and the\r\nprevalent diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n            OF POISONS OF THE UMBELLIFEROUS ORDER OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Natural Order _Umbelliferæ_ contains a variety of plants, to which\r\nnarcotico-acrid properties have been at different times ascribed. But\r\nthese properties have been satisfactorily traced in the instance of four\r\nspecies only, the _Conium maculatum_, _Œnanthe crocata_, _Cicuta\r\nvirosa_, and _Æthusa cynapium_. It is supposed that others may be\r\npoisonous. But the facts on the subject are equivocal; for the several\r\nspecies of the family are very apt to be confounded with one another,\r\nand there is reason to think that other species have repeatedly been\r\nmistaken for one of the four already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms caused by the umbelliferous narcotics comprehend chiefly\r\ncoma, convulsions, paralysis, and delirium. But the knowledge possessed\r\non this head is rather vague, and the phenomena are not unfrequently\r\ncomplex and difficult to observe with accuracy; so that their nature has\r\nbeen sometimes misunderstood. The irritant properties of the poisons of\r\nthis tribe of narcotico-acrids are seldom well defined.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Of Poisoning with Hemlock._\r\n\r\nThe first to be mentioned is the common hemlock, or _Conium maculatum_,\r\none of the most abundantly diffused of umbelliferous vegetables. It is\r\ndistinguished from all those which it resembles by its tall, smooth,\r\nspotted stem,—its smooth leaves,—the rugged edge of the five ribs of its\r\nfruit,—its singular mousy odour,—and the very peculiar odour of conia,\r\nemitted when the pulp or juice of the leaves is mixed with caustic\r\npotash. The only other umbelliferous native which has a spotted stem,\r\nthe _Myrrhis temulenta_, is easily distinguished from hemlock by the\r\nwhole plant being very hairy.\r\n\r\nCases of poisoning with hemlock are not infrequent on the continent, the\r\nroot having been mistaken for fennel, asparagus, parsley, but\r\nparticularly parsnep.[2217] It is generally believed to have furnished\r\nthe poison which was used in ancient times, and especially among the\r\nGreeks, for despatching criminals; but we have not any precise\r\ninformation on the subject.\r\n\r\nA peculiar alkaloid was indicated in hemlock not long ago by Brandes,\r\nhalf a grain of which killed a rabbit with symptoms like those of\r\ntetanus.[2218] Other chemists were unable to obtain his results. But the\r\nsubject was afterwards taken up with success by Geiger, who obtained\r\nfrom the plant a volatile, oleaginous alkaloid, which possesses great\r\nenergy as a poison.[2219] Mr. Morries-Stirling procured from hemlock by\r\ndestructive distillation an empyreumatic oil similar in properties to\r\nthose of hyoscyamus, stramonium and tobacco, but producing in animals a\r\nstate of pure coma.[2220]\r\n\r\nThe effects of hemlock on the animal system have been variously\r\ndescribed by different observers. Sometimes they have appeared to be\r\npurely soporific like those of opium; at other times they have resembled\r\nthe effects of belladonna and thorn-apple; and in the lower animals they\r\nare quite different, as I have witnessed them, from what they have been\r\ndescribed to be in man,—the phenomena being simply those of asphyxia\r\nfrom paralysis of the muscles, without material convulsions and without\r\ninsensibility. Its irritant action is not well established.\r\n\r\nOrfila observed that an ounce of the extract of the leaves killed a dog\r\nin forty-five minutes when swallowed, ninety grains killed another\r\nthrough a wound in an hour and a half, and twenty-eight grains another\r\nthrough a vein in two minutes. It therefore acts by entering the\r\nblood-vessels. The extract is a very uncertain preparation; the reason\r\nof which is, that the alkaloid conia is very easily decomposed in its\r\nnatural state of mixture by heat or age, being converted into an inert\r\nresinoid matter,—that the dried leaves of hemlock contain scarcely any\r\nof it,—and that even an extract of the fresh leaves contains little,\r\nunless prepared with a gentle heat, yet speedily.[2221] The symptoms\r\nremarked by Orfila were convulsions and insensibility; and in the dead\r\nbody the blood of the left cavities of the heart was sometimes found\r\narterial.—The result of my observations is quite at variance with this\r\nstatement. In various experiments with a strong extract prepared from\r\nthe green seeds with absolute alcohol, the only effect I could remark\r\nwere palsy, first of the voluntary muscles, next of the chest, lastly of\r\nthe diaphragm,—asphyxia in short from paralysis, without insensibility,\r\nand with slight occasional twitches only of the limbs, and the heart was\r\nalways found contracting vigorously for a long time after death. Thirty\r\ngrains of a soft extract introduced between the skin and muscles of the\r\nback killed a rabbit in five minutes, and a five months’ puppy in twenty\r\nminutes.[2222]\r\n\r\nThe root is much less energetic than is represented by some authors, and\r\nprobably varies in this respect at different seasons. I have found that\r\nfour ounces and a half of juice, the produce of twelve ounces of roots\r\ncollected in November, had no effect on a dog when secured in its\r\nstomach by a ligature on the gullet; and that four ounces obtained from\r\nten ounces of roots in the middle of June, when the plant was coming\r\ninto flower, merely caused diarrhœa and languor. Orfila had previously\r\nobserved that three pounds of roots had no effect in the month of April;\r\nbut that two pounds in the end of May, when the plant was in full\r\nvegetation, killed a dog in six hours.[2223] The alcoholic extract of\r\nthe juice obtained from six ounces of roots on the last day of May, I\r\nhave found to kill a rabbit in thirty-seven minutes, when introduced in\r\na state of emulsion between the skin and muscles of the back; and the\r\neffects were analogous to those obtained with the extract of the leaves.\r\nThe differences depending on season will probably account for various\r\npersons having found the juice of the root harmless. Gmelin quotes an\r\ninstance where four ounces of the juice were taken without injury. He\r\nadds another where three ounces of the juice of the herb were swallowed\r\ndaily for eight days with as little effect. But, as he judiciously\r\nobserves, other less active plants have probably been sometimes mistaken\r\nfor hemlock.[2224]\r\n\r\nThe alkaloid, conia, seems to be the active principle of hemlock, and is\r\na poison of extraordinary virulence. On investigating this subject in\r\n1835,[2225] I found that it is a local irritant, possessing an acrid\r\ntaste, and capable of exciting redness or vascularity in any membrane to\r\nwhich it is applied; but that these topical effects are readily\r\noverwhelmed by its swift and intense narcotic action. This action\r\nconsists of swiftly spreading palsy of the muscles, which affects first\r\nthose of voluntary motion, then the respiratory muscles of the chest and\r\nabdomen, and lastly the diaphragm, so as to terminate by causing\r\nasphyxia. The paralytic state is usually interrupted from time to time\r\nby slight convulsive twitches of the limbs and trunk at the beginning.\r\nThe muscular contractility is impaired or annihilated by the topical\r\naction of the poison, but not by its indirect action through absorption.\r\nThe heart is not appreciably affected; for it contracts vigorously long\r\nafter all motion, respiration, and other signs of life are extinct; and\r\nit contains after death, not florid but dark blood in its left cavities.\r\nThe blood undergoes no alteration. The external senses are little, if at\r\nall impaired, until the breathing is almost arrested; and volition too\r\nis retained. But a contrary inference may be drawn by a careless\r\nobserver, in consequence of the paralytic state taking away the means,\r\nby which in animals sensation is expressed and volition exercised. The\r\naction of conia, in short, is confined to the spinal cord; and it acts\r\nas a sedative, by exhausting the nervous energy.\r\n\r\nConia is probably a deadly poison to all orders of animals: at least I\r\nfound it to be so to the dog, cat, rabbit, mouse, frog, fly, and flea;\r\nand Geiger killed the kite, pigeon, sparrow, slow-worm, and earth-worm\r\nwith it. It acts through every texture where absorption is carried on\r\nreadily, through the stomach, eye, lungs, cellular tissue, peritonæum,\r\nor veins; and its activity is in proportion to the speed with which\r\nabsorption is carried on in the part. It acts therefore through\r\nabsorption. Its activity is increased by neutralization with an acid, by\r\nwhich it is rendered much more soluble in water. Few poisons equal it in\r\nsubtility and swiftness. A single drop, applied to the eye of a rabbit,\r\nwill kill it in nine minutes; and three drops in the same way will kill\r\na strong cat in a minute and a half. Five drops, introduced into the\r\nthroat of a little dog, began to act in thirty seconds, and proved fatal\r\nin one minute. And when two grains, neutralized with thirty drops of\r\nweak hydrochloric acid, were injected into the femoral vein of a young\r\ndog, it died before there was time to note the interval, so that only\r\ntwo or three seconds at most had elapsed, before all internal signs of\r\nlife were extinct. This extraordinary rapidity of action seems\r\nincompatible with its operation taking place by conveyance of the poison\r\nwith the blood to the spinal cord. Mr. Blake, as formerly mentioned (p.\r\n15), denies that its action in this way was ever so swift in his hands,\r\nand alleges that he could never observe the interval to be shorter than\r\nfifteen seconds. If the reader, however, will consult the original\r\naccount of my experiment,[2226] which was made along with Dr. Sharpey,\r\nhe will see that we could scarcely be mistaken as to the interval in\r\nthat instance.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Man._—M. Haaf, a French army-surgeon, has described a fatal\r\ncase of poisoning with hemlock, which closely resembled poisoning with\r\nopium. The subject of it, a soldier, had partaken along with several\r\ncomrades of a soup containing hemlock leaves, and appeared to them to\r\ndrop asleep not long after, while they were conversing. In the course of\r\nan hour and a half they became alarmed on being all taken ill with\r\ngiddiness and headache; and the surgeon of the regiment was sent for. He\r\nfound the soldier, who had fallen asleep, in a state of insensibility,\r\nfrom which, however, he could be roused for a few moments. His\r\ncountenance was bloated, the pulse only 30, and the extremities cold.\r\nThe insensibility became rapidly deeper and deeper, till he died, three\r\nhours after taking the soup.[2227] His companions recovered.\r\n\r\nDr. Watson has briefly described two cases which were fatal in the same\r\nshort space of time. The subjects were two Dutch soldiers, who, in\r\ncommon with several of their comrades, took broth made with hemlock\r\nleaves and various other herbs. Giddiness, coma, and convulsions were\r\nthe principal symptoms. The men who recovered were affected exactly as\r\nif they had taken opium.[2228]\r\n\r\nWhen the dose is not sufficient to prove fatal, there is sometimes\r\nparalysis, attended with slight convulsions, as in a case noticed by\r\nOrfila.[2229] More commonly there is frantic delirium. Matthiol has\r\nrelated an instance of this last description, occurring in the cases of\r\na vine-dresser and his wife, who mistook the roots for parsneps Both of\r\nthem became in the course of the night so delirious that they ran about\r\nthe house, knocking themselves against every object which came in their\r\nway.[2230] Kircher, as quoted by Wibmer, tells a parallel story of two\r\nmonks who became so raving mad after eating the roots, that they plunged\r\ninto water, imagining that they were turned into geese, and they were\r\naffected for three years with incomplete palsy and neuralgic\r\npains.[2231] These and some other cases of the like kind, recorded by\r\nthe older medical authors, must be received with reserve. Independently\r\nof other considerations, there is often no certainty that the poison was\r\nreally the hemlock of modern botanists, and not some other umbelliferous\r\nvegetable.\r\n\r\n_Morbid Appearances._—In Haaf’s case the vessels of the head were much\r\ncongested; and the blood must have been very fluid, for on the head\r\nbeing opened a quantity flowed out, which twice filled an ordinary\r\nchamber-pot. This state of the blood likewise occurred in a case which I\r\nexamined here some years ago along with Dr. C. Coindet of Geneva. A\r\nhypochondriacal old woman took by advice of a neighbour two ounces of a\r\nstrong infusion of hemlock leaves with the same quantity of whisky,\r\nwhich she swallowed in the morning fasting. She died in an hour,\r\ncomatose and slightly convulsed. The vessels within the head were not\r\nparticularly turgid; but the blood was everywhere remarkably fluid. Dr.\r\nCoindet subsequently found that a small portion of the infusion prevents\r\nfresh drawn blood from coagulating; but I suspect there must have been\r\nsome mistake here, for a carefully prepared alcoholic extract of very\r\ngreat power, which was used in my experiments alluded to above, had no\r\nsuch effect on blood fresh drawn from rabbits and dogs. On account of\r\nthis extreme fluidity of the blood, it often flows from the nose, but\r\nthe skin is much marked with lividity.[2232] The fluidity of the blood\r\nis nothing more than the result of the proximate cause of death,—slowly\r\nformed asphyxia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Of Poisoning with Water-Hemlock._\r\n\r\nAnother plant of the order Umbelliferæ, the water-hemlock or _Cicuta\r\nvirosa_, possesses also great energy as a poison; and in its effects it\r\nappears to resemble considerably the hydrocyanic acid. The plant is\r\nindigenous. It is easily known from other umbelliferous species\r\ninhabiting watery places by the peculiar structure of its root-stock,\r\nwhich is not fleshy, but hollow, and composed of a number of large cells\r\nwith transverse plates.\r\n\r\nFrom a numerous set of experiments with the root of the cicuta performed\r\nby Wepfer, it appears to cause true tetanic convulsions in frequent\r\nparoxysms, and death on the third day.[2233] Simeon ascertained that the\r\nalcoholic extract of the root is very poisonous.[2234] Schubarth found\r\nthat an ounce of the juice of the stems and leaves, collected after the\r\nflowers had begun to blow, produced no effect on the dog.[2235] It is\r\nprobably inert, or at all events feebly poisonous in this climate,\r\nalthough it grows luxuriantly in many localities. I have found that\r\ntwelve ounces of juice, expressed from sixteen ounces of roots in the\r\nbeginning of August, merely caused some efforts to vomit, when secured\r\nin the stomach of a dog by a ligature on the gullet; that the alcoholic\r\nextract of twelve ounces of leaves gathered at the same time had no\r\neffect when introduced in the form of emulsion between the skin and\r\nmuscles of the back of a rabbit; and that the alcoholic extract of two\r\nounces of unripe seeds proved equally inert when imployed in the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Man._—Wepfer has likewise related several instances which\r\noccurred in the human subject. Among the rest he has described the cases\r\nof eight children who ate the roots instead of parsneps. Of those who\r\nwere seriously affected, one, a girl six years old, who ultimately\r\nrecovered, had tetanic fits, followed by deep coma, from which it was\r\nimpossible to rouse her for twenty-four hours. Two of them died. The\r\nfirst symptoms in these two were swelling in the pit of the stomach,\r\nvomiting or efforts to vomit, then total insensibility, with involuntary\r\ndischarge of urine, and finally severe convulsions, during which the\r\njaws were locked, the eyes rolled, and the head and spine were bent\r\nbackwards, so that a child might have crept between the body and the\r\nbed-clothes. One of them died half an hour after being taken ill, and\r\nthe other not long after.[2236] Mayer of Creutsburg mentions four cases,\r\nwhich were occasioned by the roots. One of the individuals, a child\r\nthree years old, was attacked with colic, vomiting, and convulsions, and\r\ndied in a few hours. The three others, the eldest of whom was six years\r\nof age, had coldness, paleness of the features, dilated immoveable\r\npupils, violent colic, general spasms, and insensibility. The action of\r\nthe heart was intermitting and the breathing oppressed. After the\r\nremains of the roots were brought up by emetics, and infusion of gall\r\nwas administered, they gradually recovered. They had eaten between them\r\nno more than a single root weighing about two ounces, as they had in\r\ntheir possession another of that weight, which they said was not so\r\nlarge. This accident happened in the middle of March.[2237]\r\n\r\nAccording to Guersent, poisoning with the cicuta commences with dimness\r\nof sight, giddiness, acute headache, anxiety, pain in the stomach,\r\ndryness in the throat, and vomiting.[2238]\r\n\r\nMertzdorff has related the particulars of the inspection of three cases\r\nwhich proved quickly fatal with convulsions and vomiting. Nothing\r\nremarkable seems to have been found except great gorging of the cerebral\r\nvessels.[2239]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Of Poisoning with Hemlock Dropwort._\r\n\r\nThe _Œnanthe crocata_ of botanists, the hemlock dropwort,\r\nfive-finger-root, or dead-tongue of vernacular speech in England, a\r\nspecies of the same family with the last two, and an abundant plant in\r\nsome localities throughout this country, has usually been held one of\r\nthe most virulent of European vegetables. It seems well entitled to this\r\ncharacter in general; but climate, or some other more obscure cause,\r\nrenders it inert in some situations.\r\n\r\nIt is said to be liable to be confounded with common hemlock, or _Conium\r\nmaculatum_,—a mistake which can happen only in very ignorant hands. It\r\nhas smooth, dark-green leaves, more fleshy, and much less minutely\r\ndivided, than those of hemlock; it presents a purplish appearance at the\r\njoints only of the stem, and no diffused purple spots; its fruit is\r\noblong and black, not round, rough, and light brown; and its root,\r\ninstead of being single, long, tapering, and little branched, consists\r\nof from two to ten tubers, like fingers, which are white, and terminate\r\nin a few rootlets. These tubers are formed annually in summer from the\r\nflowering stem of the season, and send out flowering stems the\r\nsubsequent year. During the first autumn, winter, and spring they are\r\nfirm, white, and amylaceous; but in their second summer they become more\r\npulpy, less amylaceous, and grayer. At all times they emit, when broken\r\nacross, an oleo-resinous juice, which quickly becomes yellow; this juice\r\nabounds most when the plant, which is growing at their expense, is about\r\nto flower; and it abounds much more at this period in localities in the\r\nsouth of England, than in Scotland, especially in the neighbourhood of\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\nBrotero and some others have attempted to subdivide the species into\r\ntwo, the _Œnanthe crocata_ proper, and the _Œ. apiifolia_. But the best\r\nauthorities deny that these can be distinguished; and from what I have\r\nnow seen in sundry localities, it appears to me that the distinctions\r\npointed out by Brotero, confessedly obscure enough in themselves, are\r\nthe result of differences in climate, soil, and situation.\r\n\r\nThe only analysis of this plant with which I am acquainted is one\r\nexecuted in 1830 by MM. Cormerais and Pihan-Dufeillay, who found in the\r\nroot a resinoid matter, which adheres obstinately to the solid portion\r\nof it, and which seems to be the active ingredient.[2240] I have\r\nsubjected the roots to various processes, and among the rest to that by\r\nwhich Geiger detected conia in hemlock, but without discovering any\r\nindication of the existence of an alkaloid. My materials, however, were\r\nnot well fitted for a chemical analysis; because the œnanthe root of\r\nthis neighbourhood is inert or nearly so. The whole plant contains a\r\nheavy-smelling volatile oil, which may be obtained by distillation in\r\nthe usual way, and most abundantly from the ripe seeds. This oil is\r\nyellowish, viscid, and inert.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that a plant, so universally considered a potent poison,\r\nand so frequently the cause of fatal accidents, has not yet been made\r\nthe subject of physiological investigation. A few imperfect experiments\r\nby M. Cormerais and his companion, made with the resinoid matter of the\r\nroots, show that this substance produces in animals dulness, convulsions\r\nof the voluntary muscles, a semi-paralytic state of the hind legs, and\r\nsometimes shortness of breath, vomiting, and fluid evacuations by stool.\r\nAll the animals experimented on recovered. On repeating these\r\nexperiments with larger quantities I found the resin of the root, grown\r\nnear Woolwich, and kindly sent to me by Dr. Pereira, to be a poison of\r\ngreat energy and singular properties. Twenty-four grains obtained from\r\neight ounces of roots in the middle of December, when introduced in the\r\nform of emulsion between the skin and muscles of the rabbit, caused in\r\nhalf an hour depression, uneasiness, and hurried breathing,—then\r\ntwitches of the ears, neck, and fore-legs,—next combined spasm and\r\nconvulsive starting of the head and limbs,—then, after a quiet interval,\r\na more violent fit of the same kind, affecting the whole body with a\r\nsingular combination of tetanus and convulsive starting,—finally, after\r\nseveral such fits, a paroxysm more violent than before, ending in\r\nimmoveable tetanic rigidity, which speedily proved fatal, 78 minutes\r\nafter the application of the poison. No morbid appearance could be\r\ndetected in the body. The heart contracted vigorously for some time\r\nafter death. These phenomena correspond in the main with what has been\r\nrecorded of the symptoms caused by the roots in man.—Dr. Pereira informs\r\nme he had found the juice both of the root and leaves to act as a\r\npoison, either when introduced into the peritonæum, or when injected\r\ninto the veins; and in the latter way it was so energetic as to prove\r\nfatal in one minute.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Man._—Since Lobel first took notice of the poisonous\r\nproperties of the œnanthe root in 1570, an uninterrupted series of\r\nobservations has been published, down to the present day, showing that\r\nin France, Germany, Holland, Spain, and various parts of England as far\r\nnorth as Liverpool, it is at all seasons of the year, even in October\r\nand in the beginning of January, a poison of great activity. In several\r\nof the cases death has been occasioned by a single handful of the roots,\r\nin one instance by a piece no bigger than the finger, or even in\r\nconsequence of the individuals merely tasting them. A girl seems to have\r\nhad a narrow escape after eating, with an interval of three hours, two\r\npieces of the size of a walnut. Very seldom has death been delayed\r\nbeyond four hours, and on some occasions a single hour has been\r\nsufficient. Sometimes the symptoms have been slow in making their\r\nappearance, an hour and a half having occasionally elapsed before the\r\neffects were evident; but in every instance their progress was rapid,\r\nonce the symptoms had fairly set in; and some died in convulsions almost\r\nimmediately after being taken ill.\r\n\r\nThe particular effects have been variable. Most generally the first\r\nsymptoms have been giddiness and staggering, as if from ordinary\r\nintoxication, occasionally headache, and often extreme feebleness of the\r\nlimbs. Stupor has then generally succeeded, sometimes with the\r\nintervention of efforts to vomit, sometimes too with an interval of\r\ndelirium. Convulsions have also commonly made their appearance in the\r\nnext place; and ere long a state of insensibility has ensued attended in\r\nevery instance with occasional violent convulsive fits like epilepsy,\r\nand with permanent locked-jaw; which symptoms have continued till near\r\ndeath. In one or two cases the individual has suddenly, without any\r\npremonitory symptoms, fallen down convulsed, and died almost\r\nimmediately. In one or two instances again, the effects have rather been\r\nthose of irritant poisoning, namely, inflammation of the mouth and\r\nthroat, spasms of the muscles of the throat, vomiting, and excessive\r\nweakness and faintness, without any convulsions or insensibility.—It\r\nappears then that this plant is a true narcotico-acrid poison. The\r\nemanations from the plant are said on some occasions to have proved\r\ninjurious; but the effect here was probably the work of the imagination.\r\n\r\nAware of these singular properties being generally ascribed to the\r\n_Œnanthe crocata_, I was anxious to make a methodical examination of the\r\nsubject, physiologically as well as chemically,—especially as the plant\r\ngrows in great abundance and very luxuriantly in a locality not far from\r\nEdinburgh. But I have found it in that situation, to all appearance,\r\nquite inert. The juice of fourteen ounces of the root in the end of\r\nOctober had no effect on a little dog when secured in the stomach by a\r\nligature on the gullet. The juice of sixteen ounces in the middle of\r\nJune was also without effect. An alcoholic extract of four ounces of the\r\nfull grown leaves in the end of June, introduced into the cellular\r\ntissue in the form of emulsion, had no effect on a rabbit. An alcoholic\r\nextract of three ounces of the ripe seeds was administered in the same\r\nway with the same result. Finally, the resinoid extract of eight ounces\r\nof the root, analogous to that which had proved so deadly in my hands\r\nwhen obtained from Woolwich plants, had also no effect whatever, when\r\nprepared from those growing in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. Relying\r\nupon these results, I ate a whole tuber weighing an ounce, without\r\nobserving any effect, except its disagreeable taste; which was the only\r\ncircumstance that prevented me from trying a larger quantity.—It may be\r\nwell to add, that, amidst the numerous cases of poisoning with œnanthe\r\nnow on record, there is not one that has occurred in Scotland. At the\r\nsame time, the common people in Scotland are not at all given to rash\r\nexperiments in cookery, or to make use of vegetables not produced by the\r\ncare of the gardener or farmer.[2241]\r\n\r\nThe only other locality from which I have been hitherto able to obtain\r\nplants for examination is the neighbourhood of Liverpool, where a fatal\r\ncase of poisoning with it occurred near the close of last century. When\r\nthe juice of sixteen ounces of this root in the beginning of September\r\nwas secured in the stomach of a dog, efforts to vomit were produced,\r\nfollowed by several fits of violent convulsions and spasm of the\r\nvoluntary muscles, a paralytic state of the fore-legs, and a constant\r\ntendency to fall backwards; but the animal recovered.\r\n\r\nNo morbid appearances of any note have been observed after death in any\r\nof the fatal cases which are recorded.—The most appropriate treatment\r\nconsists in the prompt employment of emetics, and diffusible stimulants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Of Poisoning with Fool’s Parsley._\r\n\r\nAnother umbelliferous plant of great activity is fool’s parsley, or\r\n_Æthusa cynapium_. It has occasioned several accidents by reason of its\r\nresemblance to parsley,—from which, however, it is at once distinguished\r\nby the leaves being dark and glistening on their lower surface, and by\r\nthe nauseous smell they emit when rubbed. It contains an alkaloid, which\r\ncrystallizes in rhombic prisms, and is soluble in water and alcohol, but\r\nnot in ether. It was discovered by Professor Ficinus of Dresden.[2242]\r\n\r\nOrfila found that six ounces of the juice, when retained in the stomach\r\nof a dog, by a ligature, caused convulsions and stupor, and death in an\r\nhour.[2243]\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Man._—Some interesting information on the characters and\r\nproperties of this plant is contained in the Medical and Physical\r\nJournal. Among other cases the writer relates those of two ladies who\r\nate a little of it in a sallad instead of parsley, and who were soon\r\nseized with nausea, vomiting, headache, giddiness, somnolency, pungent\r\nheat in the mouth, throat, and stomach, difficulty in swallowing and\r\nnumbness of the limbs.[2244] Gmelin has related the case of a child, who\r\ndied in eight hours in consequence of having eaten the æthusa. The\r\nsymptoms were spasmodic pain in the stomach, swelling of the belly,\r\nlividity of the skin, and difficult breathing.[2245] In two children who\r\nrecovered, the chief symptoms at the height of the poisoning were\r\ncomplete insensibility, dilated, insensible pupil, and staring of the\r\neyes. In one of them there was also frequent vomiting, in the other\r\nconvulsions. The treatment consisted in the administration of milk,\r\nsinapisms to the legs, and cold spunging with vinegar.[2246]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXV.\r\n                     OF THE NARCOTIC RANUNCULACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the poisons belonging to the Natural Family\r\n_Ranunculaceæ_ are acrid only in their action, and have been already\r\ntaken notice of among the irritants. Two only are yet known to possess\r\nnarcotic properties, namely, _monkshood_, and _black hellebore_. The\r\nlatter is a true narcotico-acrid. The former has till lately been always\r\nconsidered so; but its acrid properties seem doubtful or feeble, while\r\nits action on the nervous system is most intense.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Of Poisoning with Monkshood._\r\n\r\nMonkshood, the _Aconitum napellus_ of botanists, is an active poison,\r\nand has commonly been considered a true narcotico-acrid. But its effects\r\nhave been hitherto much misunderstood. It has been used for criminal\r\npurposes in Ireland; and in 1841, a woman, M’Conkey, who was executed\r\nthere for poisoning her husband, was proved to have administered this\r\nsubstance [see p. 61]. The root of another species, the _A. ferox_, is\r\nwell known to be in common use as a poison, under the name of Bikh, in\r\nBengal, and Nabee, in the Madras Presidency.\r\n\r\nThe toxicological history of the genus, and of this species in\r\nparticular, has been rendered complex and obscure, by the extreme\r\ndifficulty of distinguishing accurately the several species from one\r\nanother. The whole genus, now a numerous one, is generally conceived to\r\nbe eminently poisonous. But from some observations of my own, as well as\r\nan elaborate inquiry, not yet made public, by Dr. Alexander\r\nFleming,[2247] a recent graduate of this university, I am inclined to\r\nthink that this is a mistake, that the poisonous species are not\r\nnumerous, and that many aconites are inert, at least in this climate.\r\n\r\nThe _A. napellus_, a doubtful native of Britain, and the most common\r\nspecies in our gardens, shoots up annually a leafy stem from a black,\r\ntapering, spindle-shaped root. The stem, which is from two to five feet\r\nhigh, ends in a long dense spike of fine blue flowers; and when the\r\nseeds ripen in autumn, it dies down, and the root also shrivels and\r\nperishes. But in the spring, while the stem is rising, one or more\r\ntubers form near the crown of the root; each tuber quickly assumes the\r\nspindle-shaped form of its parent, but has a light brown, instead of a\r\nbrownish-black tegument; and when the plant is in flower, the new tuber,\r\ndestined for the root of next year’s plant, is as large as the parent\r\none, firmer, more amylaceous, and not so apt to shrivel in drying. This\r\nmode of propagation has led some to describe the root erroneously as\r\nsometimes palmated. Dr. Fleming considers the young, full-grown tuber to\r\nbe the most active part of the plant; but the root of the existing\r\nplant, the leaves, and also the seeds, are highly energetic; and every\r\npart is more or less so.\r\n\r\nEvery part of the _A. napellus_, but especially the root, affects\r\nremarkably the organs of taste, producing a very singular sense of heat,\r\nnumbness, and tingling of those parts of the mouth to which it is\r\napplied. Dr. Fleming has ascertained, that this peculiar taste, or\r\nrather sensation, is a property belonging to the narcotic principle of\r\nmonkshood, and that in all probability it is a measure of the activity\r\nof the plant as a poison. It is most intense in the root, next in the\r\nseeds, and next in the leaves before the flowers blow. Geiger first\r\nascertained, and I have since observed, that the sensation thus\r\noccasioned by the leaves diminishes in intensity as the flowers expand,\r\nand almost disappears when the seeds ripen. Contrary to what has been\r\noften stated, it is not diminished by drying the leaves, even with the\r\nheat of the vapour-bath. Nor is it materially lessened by time, if the\r\ndried leaves be preserved with care; for I have found it intense after\r\nsix years. Geiger observed some years ago, that several species or\r\nvarieties do not possess it. I have ascertained that _A. napellus_,\r\n_sinense_, _tauricum_, _uncinatum_, and _ferox_, possess it intensely,\r\n_A. schleicheri_ and _nasutum_ feebly, _A. neomontanum_ very feebly; all\r\nof which are therefore probably poisonous, in proportion to the\r\nintensity of their taste. _A. ferox_, well known as a deadly poison in\r\nthe East, and undoubtedly the most virulent of all the species, produces\r\nby far the most intense and persistent effect on the mouth of all the\r\nspecies I have had an opportunity of examining. Those which do not\r\nproduce it at all, at least in this climate, are _A. paniculatum_,\r\n_lasiostomum_, _vulparia_, _variegatum_, _nitidum_, _pyrenaïcum_, and\r\n_ochroleucum_. It would be premature to say that all these species are\r\ninert; but I suspect they are: and, at all events, I have ascertained\r\nthat the leaves of _A. paniculatum_, although the officinal species\r\nrecognised in the London Pharmacopœia, are quite inactive in this\r\nclimate; and Dr. Fleming has found the root inert in medicinal doses of\r\nconsiderable magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe properties of monkshood have been traced by Geiger and Hesse to a\r\npeculiar alkaloid, named aconitina: which is white, pulverulent,\r\nfusible, not volatile, soluble in ether and alcohol, sparingly so in\r\nwater, and capable of forming crystallizable salts with acids. It\r\nproduces most intensely the peculiar impression caused by the plant on\r\nthe mouth, tongue, and lips; and it is a poison of tremendous activity,\r\nprobably indeed the most subtle of all known poisons. Although not a\r\nvolatile principle, it has been supposed peculiarly liable to\r\ndecomposition by heat, at least in its natural state of combination in\r\nthe plant or its pharmaceutic preparations. This opinion is founded on\r\nthe uncertainty of the medicinal action of the common extract of the\r\nshops, and on the results of experiments on animals by Orfila.[2248] In\r\none experiment he found that half an ounce of the extract of the\r\nParisian shops had no effect at all on a dog, while a quarter of an\r\nounce killed another within two hours. Careless preparation may account\r\nfor such differences; but at the same time an error in choosing the\r\nspecies of plant is an equally probable explanation. The properties of\r\nmonkshood appear to me to resist a heat of 212°, either in drying the\r\nplant or in preparing an extract from it.\r\n\r\nThe medico-legal chemistry of monkshood has not been studied. If any of\r\nthe suspected matter be obtained in a pure state, its best character is\r\nits remarkable taste; to which I have found nothing exactly similar in\r\nthe numerous trials I have made with other narcotic and acrid plants. A\r\ncomplex substance, such as the contents of the stomach, or vomited\r\nmatter, should be evaporated over the vapour-bath to the consistence of\r\nthin syrup, and agitated with absolute alcohol. The filtered alcoholic\r\nsolution being then evaporated, the extract may be subjected to the\r\nsense of taste.\r\n\r\n_Action._—The action of monkshood is a subject of great interest, but\r\nhas hitherto been much misunderstood. Sir B. Brodie, who was the first\r\nto examine it in recent times, found that the leading phenomena in\r\nanimals, were staggering, excessive weakness, slow laborious\r\nrespiration, and slight convulsive twitches before death.[2249] Had\r\nthese observations been followed up by his successors with a\r\ndiscriminating eye, toxicologists would not have been so much misled as\r\nthey have been. Orfila, who was the next to examine the subject\r\nexperimentally, failed to appreciate the phenomena with exactness.[2250]\r\nHe thinks monkshood acts peculiarly upon the brain, causing delirium,\r\nand that it is a local irritant, capable of developing more or less\r\nintense inflammation. A single experiment made in 1836 convinced me that\r\nthe former statement is incorrect, and led me to consider that the\r\nsymptoms depend in a great measure on gradually-increasing paralysis of\r\nthe muscles, which terminates in immobility of the chest and diaphragm,\r\nand consequent asphyxia. Dr. Pereira, in some experiments with an\r\nalcoholic extract, published in 1842, took notice of two remarkable\r\nphenomena,—an extraordinary diminution of common sensation, evidenced by\r\nthe animal being insensible to pinching and pricking,—and the total\r\nabsence of stupor, as shown by the animal following its owner, and\r\nrecognizing him when called.[2251] Similar observations have been made\r\nin poisoning with monkshood in man. The ablest investigation yet\r\nundertaken into the actions of this substance is contained in the\r\nunpublished Inaugural Dissertation of Dr. Fleming.\r\n\r\nHe found that the most remarkable symptoms are weakness and staggering,\r\ngradually increasing paralysis of the voluntary muscles, slowly\r\nincreasing insensibility of the surface, more or less blindness, great\r\nlanguor of the pulse, and convulsive twitches before death. He farther\r\nobserved that the pupil becomes much contracted; that the irritability\r\nof the voluntary muscles is impaired; that the veins are congested after\r\ndeath, the blood unaltered, and the heart capable of contracting for\r\nsome time after respiration has ceased. Lastly, he maintains that this\r\npoison has not, as is generally thought, any irritant properties, that\r\nneither the plant, nor its extract, nor its alkaloid occasions\r\nvascularity in any membrane to which it is applied, even, for example,\r\nin the lips or tongue while burning and tingling from its topical\r\naction; that this peculiar effect is therefore merely a nervous\r\nphenomenon; and that he never could observe either the diffuse cellular\r\ninflammation described by Orfila to arise from the application of\r\nmonkshood to a wound, or the inflammatory redness of the alimentary\r\ncanal noticed by others as one of its effects when swallowed.\r\n\r\nOrfila ascertained that monkshood exerts its action through the medium\r\nof the blood; for its effects are greater when it is introduced into a\r\nwound, than when it is swallowed, and they are still greater when it is\r\ninjected directly into a vein. It is a poison of very great activity. I\r\nhave found that thirty grains of an alcoholic extract, the produce of\r\nthree-quarters of an ounce of fresh leaves, will kill a rabbit in two\r\nhours and a quarter, if introduced between the skin and muscles of the\r\nback. Five drachms of the root in one of Orfila’s experiments with the\r\ndog, occasioned death in twenty-one minutes, when swallowed.\r\n\r\nThe alkaloid, aconitina, seems to produce in animals precisely the same\r\neffects as the plant or its extract. Orfila and Dr. Pereira agree in\r\nthis; and my own observation, limited to a single experiment, is to the\r\nsame effect. It is probably the most subtile of all known poisons. Dr.\r\nPereira mentions that the fiftieth part of a grain has endangered life\r\nwhen used medicinally.[2252] In my experiment the tenth of a grain,\r\nintroduced in the form of hydrochlorate into the cellular tissue of a\r\nrabbit, killed it in twelve minutes.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Man._—A perplexing discrepance exists in the accounts that\r\nhave been published of the effects of monkshood on man; which seems to\r\nhave arisen, less from any actual contrariety in the phenomena, than\r\nfrom loose observation, or a misunderstanding of the facts; for most of\r\nthe recent statements of competent observers are consistent with one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nDr. Fleming says that in medicinal doses it occasions warmth in the\r\nstomach, nausea, numbness and tingling in the lips and cheeks, extending\r\nmore or less over the rest of the body, diminution in the force and\r\nfrequency of the pulse, which sometimes sinks to 40 in the minute, great\r\nmuscular weakness, confusion of sight or absolute blindness; and if the\r\ndose be unduly large, there is a sense of impending death, sometimes\r\nslight delirium, and a want of power to execute what the will directs,\r\nbut without any loss of consciousness. The warmth which is excited is\r\nunattended with any elevation of temperature, vascularity of the skin,\r\nor acceleration of the pulse. No true hypnotic effect is produced; but\r\nby inducing serenity, or deadening pain, it may predispose to sleep. The\r\nhighest degree of these effects is not unattended with danger.\r\n\r\nWhen it is administered in doses adequate to occasion death, it seems in\r\ngeneral to operate by inducing extreme depression of the circulation.\r\nDr. Fleming recognizes two other modes of death in animals,—first, by an\r\noverwhelming depression of the nervous system, proving fatal in a few\r\nseconds, without arresting the action of the heart,—and secondly, by\r\nasphyxia, or arrestment of the respiration, the result of paralysis\r\ngradually pervading the whole muscular system, respiratory, as well as\r\nvoluntary. But these effects, he thinks, cannot be recognized in the\r\ncases which have been published of poisoning in man, because the dose\r\nrequired to produce either of them is very large. The least variable\r\nsymptoms in the human subject are, first, numbness, burning, and\r\ntingling in the mouth, throat, and stomach,—then sickness, vomiting, and\r\npain in the epigastrium,—next, general numbness, prickling, and impaired\r\nsensibility of the skin, impaired or annihilated vision, deafness, and\r\nvertigo,—also frothing at the mouth, constriction at the throat, false\r\nsensations of weight or enlargement in various parts of the body,—great\r\nmuscular feebleness and tremor, loss of voice, and laborious\r\nbreathing,—distressing sense of sinking and impending death,—a small,\r\nfeeble, irregular, gradually-vanishing pulse,—cold, clammy sweat and\r\npale bloodless features,—together with perfect possession of the mental\r\nfaculties, and no tendency to stupor or drowsiness,—finally, sudden\r\ndeath at last, as from hemorrhage, and generally in a period varying\r\nfrom an hour and a half to eight hours. The symptoms may begin in a few\r\nminutes, as in a case observed by Dr. Fleming, which was occasioned by\r\nthe tincture of the root; or they may be postponed for three-quarters of\r\nan hour, as in an instance recorded by Dr. Pereira,[2253] which arose\r\nfrom the root being used by mistake for horse-radish. Two or three\r\ndrachms of the root are sufficient to kill a man; and Dr. Fleming\r\nmentions one instance where two grains of the alcoholic extract\r\noccasioned alarming effects, and another where four grains proved fatal.\r\nI may observe, however, that I have given six grains of a carefully\r\nprepared alcoholic extract (the same of which thirty grains killed a\r\nrabbit in little more than two hours), to a female suffering from\r\nrheumatism, without being able to observe any effect whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIf all the reports of cases now on record are to be trusted, the\r\nfollowing anomalies have occurred. Some persons are said to have\r\npresented convulsions. Slight spasmodic twitches of the muscles are not\r\nuncommon, and probably depend, as Dr. Fleming suggests, on venous\r\ncongestion, the result of incomplete asphyxia. Stupor and even\r\napoplectic insensibility are also sometimes represented to have been\r\nobserved. If really ever present, they must depend on the same cause;\r\nbut there is reason to apprehend, that extreme nervous depression and\r\nfaintness have been mistaken for stupor and coma. Delirium of the\r\nfrantic kind, mentioned by some of the older authors, is justly\r\nconsidered by Dr. Fleming to be of doubtful occurrence, as it has never\r\nbeen observed in recent times. Irritation in the alimentary canal is\r\ndistinctly mentioned as indicated by prominent symptoms, even in some\r\ncases observed but a few years ago, and apparently with care. Dr.\r\nFleming properly objects to nausea, vomiting, or pain in the epigastrium\r\nas evidence of irritation in the stomach; for these symptoms may all\r\ndepend on the same local nervous impression which is produced on the\r\norgans of taste. And he denies that purging is ever produced in any\r\ngenuine case of poisoning with monkshood. The following, however, seem\r\nunequivocal examples of irritation in the alimentary canal. M.\r\nPallas[2254] mentions, that three out of five persons, who took a\r\nspirituous infusion of the root by mistake for lovage [_Ligusticum\r\nlevisticum_], died in two hours with burning in the throat, vomiting,\r\ncolic, swelling of the belly and purging. A similar set of cases is\r\ndescribed by M. Degland.[2255] Four persons took the tincture of the\r\nroot by mistake for tincture of lovage; and three of them were seized\r\nwith burning pain from the throat to the stomach, a sense of enlargement\r\nof the tongue and face, colic, tenderness of the belly, vomiting, and\r\npurging. One of these, who ultimately recovered, had frantic delirium\r\nfor some time after the other symptoms went off. The two others died,\r\none in two hours, the other half an hour later. Dr. Pereira[2256] and\r\nDr. Fleming doubt the authenticity of these cases; and it may be, that\r\nsuch unusual symptoms may have arisen either from some other root\r\nmistaken by the narrators for monkshood, or from irritant substances\r\ngiven along with or after it. At the same time I may mention, that in\r\nthe first trials I made with monkshood as a medicine, using a carefully\r\nprepared extract of the root, I was deterred from proceeding by two\r\npatients being attacked with severe vomiting, griping, and diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to conclude these general statements by the particulars\r\nof a few well authenticated cases. Dr. Pereira describes two that were\r\noccasioned by the root having been dug up in February by mistake for\r\nhorse-radish.[2257] The parties, a gentleman and his wife, ate, the\r\nformer about a root and a half, the latter not much more than half a\r\nroot. Both of them in three-quarters of an hour had burning, and\r\nnumbness in the lips, mouth, and throat, extending to the stomach and\r\nfollowed by vomiting. The husband had subsequently violent and frequent\r\nvomiting, partly owing to an emetic. His extremities became cold, the\r\nlips blue, the eyes glaring, and the head covered with cold sweat. There\r\nwas no spasm or convulsion, but some tremor. He had no delirium, or\r\nstupor, or loss of consciousness, but complained of violent headache.\r\nThe respiration was not affected; and although he felt very weak, he was\r\nable to walk with a little assistance only a few minutes before death;\r\nwhich took place, as if from fainting, about four hours after the poison\r\nwas swallowed.—His wife, in addition to the early symptoms already\r\nmentioned, had such weakness and stiffness of the limbs that she was\r\nunable to stand; and she could utter only unintelligible sounds; but she\r\nhad no spasms or convulsions. She experienced a strange sensation of\r\nnumbness in the hands, arms, and legs, diminution of sensibility over\r\nthe whole integuments, especially of the face and throat, where the\r\nsense of touch was almost extinguished. She had also some dimness of\r\nvision, giddiness, and at times an approach to loss of consciousness,\r\nbut no delirium, sleepiness, or deafness. She recovered, under the use\r\nof emetics, laxatives, and stimulants. In neither of these cases was\r\nthere any diarrhœa.—A patient of Mr. Sherwen,[2258] five minutes after\r\ntaking a tincture of the root, suffered from the same incipient symptoms\r\nas above, but without actual vomiting. The face seemed to her to swell,\r\nand the throat to contract; she became nearly blind, and excessively\r\nfeeble, but did not lose her consciousness. The eyes were fixed and\r\nprotruded, and the pupils contracted, the jaws stiff, the face livid,\r\nthe whole body cold, the pulse imperceptible, the heart’s action feeble\r\nand fluttering, and the breathing short and laborious. An emetic was\r\nfollowed first by violent convulsions, and then by vomiting; after which\r\nshe slowly recovered. At all times she was so sensible as to be able to\r\ntell how the accident happened.—Dr. Ballardini of Brescia met with\r\ntwelve simultaneous cases of poisoning with the juice of the leaves,\r\nused by mistake for scurvy-grass [_Cochlearia officinalis_]. Each person\r\nhad three ounces of juice. Three of them died in two hours; but the rest\r\nwere saved. The chief symptoms were extreme weakness and anxiety,\r\npaleness and distortion of the features, dilatation of the pupils,\r\ndulness of the eyes, giddiness, headache, chiefly occipital, some\r\ndistension and pain of the belly, vomiting of a green matter, and in\r\nsome diarrhœa. The whole body was cold, the nails livid, the limbs\r\ncramped, the pulse small and scarcely perceptible. In the fatal cases\r\nthere were convulsions.[2259]—MM. Pereyra and Perrin mention, that,\r\nwhile using the alcoholic extract in the Hospital of St. André at\r\nBordeaux, the sample of the drug happened to be changed when the dose\r\nhad been raised so high as ten grains; and that the patients who were\r\ntaking it were then all seized with burning in the mouth and throat,\r\nvomiting, pungent pains in the extremities, cold sweating, anxiety,\r\nextreme general prostration, great slowness and irregularity of the\r\npulse, convulsions, and congestion in the venous system. One patient\r\ndied; the others recovered under no other treatment than stimulant\r\nfriction along the spine.[2260] An infant at Suippe, in the French\r\nDepartment of the Marne, ate a few leaves and flowers of monkshood,\r\nwhile walking in a garden. Soon afterwards he began to stagger as if\r\ntipsy, and to complain of pain in the belly. In two hours an emetic was\r\ngiven; but a few minutes afterwards, the eyes became convulsed, the jaws\r\nlocked, the trunk bent rigidly backward, and the limbs convulsed; and\r\ndeath ensued in five minutes more.[2261]\r\n\r\n_Morbid Appearances._—In Ballardini’s fatal cases the pia mater and\r\narachnoid were much injected; there was much serosity under the\r\narachnoid and in the base of the cranium; the lungs were considerably\r\ngorged with blood; the heart and great vessels contained but a little\r\nblack fluid blood: the villous coat of the stomach was spotted with red\r\npoints; and the small intestines presented inwardly red patches and much\r\nmucus. In the Bordeaux case there was venous congestion in the head and\r\nchest, the lungs particularly being much gorged with blood. The right\r\nside of the heart was full of blood, of gelatinous consistence. In\r\nPallas’s cases the gullet, stomach, small intestines and rectum were\r\nvery red, the lungs dense, dark, and gorged, and the cerebral vessels\r\nturgid.\r\n\r\nFew trustworthy observations have been made on the effects of the other\r\nspecies of aconite. Dr. Pereira found the A. ferox of the East Indies to\r\nbe a much more deadly poison to animals than common monkshood; but its\r\neffects were otherwise identical.[2262] Three grains of the root put\r\ninto the throat of a rabbit, killed it in nineteen minutes; one grain of\r\nthe alcoholic extract, introduced into the peritonæum, proved equally\r\ndeadly. Nine grains will kill a cat in four hours.[2263]——Of the other\r\naconites the A. cammarum, and A. lycoctonum are said to have proved\r\nfatal frequently in Germany; but no accurate facts on the subject are on\r\nrecord.—It was stated above that the A. paniculatum, supposed by De\r\nCandolle to have been the true aconite of Baron Störck, is inert in this\r\ncountry. I introduced the alcoholic extract of three ounces of the fresh\r\nleaves collected near the end of June, into the cellular tissue between\r\nthe skin and muscles of a young rabbit, having previously converted the\r\nextract into an emulsion with mucilage and water. This was four times\r\nthe dose of A. napellus, which I had found sufficient to kill a strong\r\nadult rabbit in two hours and a quarter; but no effect whatever was\r\nproduced.—Mr. Ramsay of Broughty Ferry has described a case of fatal\r\npoisoning with a handful of aconite leaves which were mistaken for\r\nparsley, and which he supposes to have been those of A. neomontanum. The\r\nsubject, a boy of fourteen, was attacked with a sense of burning in the\r\nmouth, throat, and stomach, afterwards with vomiting and convulsions,\r\nand died considerably within five hours.[2264] The very feeble taste of\r\nthis species—which besides is little cultivated in Scotland,—inclines me\r\nto doubt whether it was the species that produced such violent effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Of Poisoning with Black Hellebore._\r\n\r\nBlack hellebore, or Christmas-rose, the _Helleborus niger_ of botanists,\r\nis a true narcotico-acrid poison. It is a doubtful native of this\r\ncountry. It produces a large white ranunculus-like flower about\r\nmidwinter. The root, the only part used in medicine, or to be found in\r\nthe shops, consists of a short root-stock and numerous, long, black\r\nundivided rootlets. The fresh root in January is not acrid to the taste.\r\nIts active principle appears from the researches of MM. Feneulle and\r\nCapron, to be an oily matter containing an acid.[2265]\r\n\r\nIts action has not yet been examined with particular care. Two or three\r\ndrachms of the root killed a dog in eighteen hours, when swallowed; two\r\ndrachms killed another in two hours, when applied to a wound; and six\r\ngrains in a wound caused death in twenty-three hours. In all cases the\r\nleading symptoms are efforts to vomit, giddiness, palsy of the\r\nhind-legs, and insensibility.[2266] Ten grains of the extract introduced\r\ninto the windpipe killed a rabbit in six minutes.[2267] Orfila found\r\nredness of the rectum, when the animals survived a few hours. But none\r\nof these experiments show the powerful irritant action exerted by the\r\nroot upon man.\r\n\r\nThe Bulletins of the Medical Society of Emulation mention two cases of\r\npoisoning with hellebore, which arose from the ignorance of a quack\r\ndoctor. Both persons, after taking a decoction of the root, were seized\r\nin forty-five minutes with vomiting, then with delirium, and afterwards\r\nwith violent convulsions. One died in two hours and a half, the other in\r\nless than two hours.[2268] Morgagni has related a case which proved\r\nfatal in about sixteen hours, the leading symptoms of which were pain in\r\nthe stomach, and vomiting. The dose in this instance was only half a\r\ndrachm of the extract.[2269] In a case not fatal, related by Dr.\r\nFahrenhorst, the symptoms were those of irritant poisoning generally,\r\nthat is, burning pain in the stomach and throat, violent vomiting, to\r\nthe extent of sixty times in the first two hours, cramps of the limbs,\r\nand cold sweating. The most material symptoms were at this time quickly\r\nsubdued by sinapisms to the belly and anodyne demulcents given\r\ninternally; and in four days the patient was well. The dose here was a\r\ntable-spoonful of the root in fine powder.[2270] In small doses of ten\r\nor twenty grains, it is well known to be a powerful purgative to man. I\r\nhave known severe griping produced by merely tasting the fresh root in\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nThe morbid appearances in Morgagni’s case were the signs of inflammation\r\nin the digestive canal, particularly in the great intestines. In the\r\ncase described in the French Bulletins, there was gorging of the lungs,\r\nand the stomach had a brownish-black colour as if gangrenous.\r\n\r\nThe other species of hellebore have not been carefully examined; but it\r\nis probable that they all possess similar properties. The _H. hyemalis_\r\nand _viridis_ are said by Buchner to be weaker than the _H. niger_; and\r\nthe _H. fœtidus_ is the most poisonous of all.[2271]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nOF POISONING WITH SQUILL, MEADOW-SAFFRON, WHITE HELLEBORE, AND FOXGLOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natural family _Liliaceæ_, and the allied family, _Melanthaceæ_,\r\ncontain many species which possess narcotico-acrid properties. Those\r\nwhich are best known in Europe are squill, meadow-saffron, cevadilla,\r\nand white hellebore. To these may be added foxglove, as possessing\r\nproperties in some measure analogous, and also rue and ipecacuan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Of Poisoning with Squill._\r\n\r\nThe root of the squill, or _Squilla maritima_, possesses the properties\r\nof the narcotico-acrids. Orfila’s experiments on animals, indeed, assign\r\nto it only an action on the nervous system. He found that two ounces and\r\na half of the fresh root, when secured in the stomach of a dog by a\r\nligature on the gullet, excited efforts to vomit, dilated pupil, and\r\nlethargy; and in two hours the animal suddenly fell down in a violent\r\nfit of tetanus, and expired. From thirty-six grains injected into the\r\njugular vein no effect followed for sixteen hours; when at last, as in\r\nthe former case, the animal dropped down convulsed and died\r\nimmediately.[2272]\r\n\r\nThe effects, however, caused by squill on man leave no doubt that it is\r\nalso an active irritant; for it causes sickness, vomiting, diarrhœa,\r\ngripes, and bloody urine, when given in over-doses. It has likewise\r\nproduced narcotic symptoms in man. Lange mentions an instance of a\r\nwoman, who died from taking a spoonful of the root in powder to cure\r\ntympanitis. She was immediately seized with violent pain in the stomach;\r\nand in a short time expired in convulsions. The stomach was found every\r\nwhere inflamed, and in some parts eroded.[2273]—A woman, whose case is\r\nmentioned in a French journal, after taking from a female quack a vinous\r\ntincture made with seventy-five grains of extract of squill, was seized\r\nwith nausea and severe colic, to which were added in twenty-four hours a\r\nsmall contracted pulse, extreme tenderness of the belly, and cold\r\nextremities; and she died in the course of the second day.[2274]\r\nTwenty-four grains of the powder have proved fatal.[2275] I have seen a\r\nquarter of an ounce of the syrup of squills, which is a common medicinal\r\ndose, cause severe vomiting, purging, and pain.\r\n\r\nAn acrid principle, named scillitin, has been discovered in the squill.\r\nA difference of opinion prevails as to its nature. Some chemists\r\nconsider it to be a resin; but Landerer has obtained it in the\r\ncrystalline form, with alkaline properties. A grain of it will kill a\r\ndog.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _Of Poisoning with White Hellebore and Cevadilla._\r\n\r\nWhite hellebore, the root-stock of _Veratrum album_, and cevadilla, the\r\nseed and capsules of _Asagræa officinalis_, and possibly of _Veratrum\r\nsabadilla_, seem to be characteristic examples of the narcotico-acrid\r\npoisons. They both possess a strong bitter taste, followed by acridity.\r\nThe cevadilla-seed in particular has an intensely disagreeable and\r\npersistent bitter taste, and produces at the same time a combination of\r\nacridity and numbness of the lips, tongue, and cheeks. They owe their\r\nactive properties chiefly to an alkaloid of great energy, termed\r\nveratria.\r\n\r\nWhite hellebore root is familiarly known to be a virulent poison. The\r\nbest account of its effects is contained in a Thesis by Dr. Schabel,\r\npublished at Tübingen in 1817. Collecting together the experiments\r\npreviously made by Wepfer, Courten, Viborg, and Orfila, and adding a\r\nnumber of excellent experiments of his own, he infers that it is\r\npoisonous to animals of all classes,—horses, dogs, cats, rabbits,\r\njackdaws, starlings, frogs, snails, and flies;—that it acts in whatever\r\nway it is introduced into the system,—by the stomach, rectum, windpipe,\r\nnostrils, pleural membrane of the chest, an external wound, or the\r\nveins;—that it produces in every instance symptoms of irritation in the\r\nalimentary canal, and injury of the nervous system;—and that it is very\r\nactive, three grains of the extract applied to the nostrils of a cat\r\nhaving killed it in sixteen hours.[2276]\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Man._—Its effects on man are similar. A singular account of\r\nseveral cases of poisoning with the root is contained in Rust’s Journal.\r\nA family of eight people, in consequence of eating bread for a whole\r\nweek, in which the powder of the root had been introduced by mistake\r\ninstead of cumin seeds, were attacked with pains in the belly, a\r\nsensation as if the whole intestines were wound up into a clue, swelling\r\nof the tongue, soreness of the mouth, and giddiness; but they all\r\nrecovered by changing the bread and taking gentle laxatives.[2277]\r\n\r\nAnother set of cases of a more aggravated nature, though still not\r\nfatal, is given in Horn’s Archives.[2278] Three people took the root by\r\nmistake for galanga. The symptoms that ensued were characteristic of its\r\ndouble action. In an hour they all had burning in the throat, gullet,\r\nand stomach, followed by nausea, dysuria, and vomiting; weakness and\r\nstiffness of the limbs; giddiness, blindness, and dilated pupil; great\r\nfaintness, convulsive breathing, and small pulse. One of them, an\r\nelderly woman, who took the largest share, had an imperceptible pulse,\r\nstertorous breathing, and total insensibility even to ammonia held under\r\nthe nose. Next day she continued lethargic, complained of headache, and\r\nhad an eruption like flea-bites. A fatal case is quoted by Bernt from\r\nSchuster’s Medical Journal. A man took twice as much as could be held on\r\nthe point of a knife, was attacked with violent and incessant vomiting,\r\nand lived only from morning till night. The gullet, stomach, and colon\r\nwere here and there inflamed.[2279]\r\n\r\nNo detailed inquiry has yet been made respecting the properties of\r\ncevadilla; but there can be no doubt that it will prove an energetic\r\npoison, similar in its effects to white hellebore, and probably more\r\nactive. Wibmer quotes Villemet for the fact, that half a drachm of the\r\nseeds excites vomiting and convulsions in the cat and dog, and Lentin\r\nfor the case of a child, who died in convulsions in consequence of the\r\npowder having been used inwardly and outwardly.[2280]\r\n\r\nThe alkaloid, veratria, has been made the subject of experiment by\r\nvarious physiologists. The most complete investigation yet undertaken is\r\nthat of Dr. Esche;[2281] who found that it causes in a few minutes\r\nrestlessness, anxiety, salivation, slowness and irregularity of the\r\npulse, slow respiration, nausea, violent vomiting, borborygmus, spasms\r\nof the abdominal muscles and brisk purging of watery mucus, often tinged\r\nwith blood;—that by and by the muscles become extremely feeble, so that\r\nthe animal cannot support itself;—that coldness of the surface succeeds,\r\ntogether with spasmodic contractions of the throat, face, and\r\nextremities, but without any stupor;—and that finally the respiration\r\nand pulse gradually become extinguished, extreme prostration ensues, and\r\ndeath takes place in a fit of tetanic spasm. No particular morbid\r\nappearance was found in the dead body, and especially no sign of\r\ninflammation. Magendie found, that one grain in the form of acetate\r\nkilled a dog in a few seconds when injected into the jugular vein, and\r\nin nine minutes when injected into the peritonæum; and that the\r\nprincipal symptom in such rapid cases was tetanic spasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Of Poisoning with Meadow-Saffron._\r\n\r\nThe _Colchicum autumnale_, meadow-saffron, or autumn-crocus, is a more\r\nfamiliar poison in this country than white hellebore, and seems to\r\npossess very similar properties. Two parts of the plant are met with in\r\nthe shops, the _cormus_ or bulb, and the seeds; both of which are\r\npoisonous. Both have a strong, disagreeable, persistent, bitter taste.\r\nThe seeds, and probably the bulb also, contain a bitter crystalline\r\nprinciple, called colchicina, which is soluble in water, neutralizes\r\nacids, and possesses intense activity as a poison.\r\n\r\nA good physiological investigation into the action of colchicum as a\r\npoison is still wanting. Baron Störck found that two drachms of the\r\ndried bulb caused in dogs violent diarrhœa and diuresis, ending\r\nfatally.[2282] Sir Everard Home observed that the active part of about\r\ntwo drachms dissolved in sherry, caused in a dog, when injected into the\r\njugular vein, slow respiration, languor of the pulse, vomiting,\r\ndiarrhœa, extreme prostration, and death in five hours.[2283]—Geiger and\r\nHesse, the discoverers of colchicina, gave a cat a tenth of a grain,\r\nwhich occasioned salivation, vomiting, purging, staggering, extreme\r\nlanguor, colic, and death in twelve hours.[2284]\r\n\r\nThe effects of colchicum on man, like those observed in animals, rather\r\nassociate it with the acrid than with the narcotic poisons.\r\n\r\nIn the Edinburgh Journal a case is briefly noticed of a man who took by\r\nmistake an ounce and a half of the wine of the bulb, and died in\r\nforty-eight hours, after suffering much from vomiting, acute pain in the\r\nstomach, colic, purging, and delirium.[2285]—Chevallier has described a\r\nsimilar case arising from the wine of the bulb having been given\r\nintentionally as a poison. In a few minutes burning pain, urgent thirst,\r\nand frequent vomiting of mucus ensued; and death took place in three\r\ndays.[2286]—Three American soldiers, who drank by mistake a large\r\nquantity of colchicum wine prepared from the bulb, died with similar\r\nsymptoms. One of them, who took eighteen ounces, and died in two days,\r\npresented the leading symptoms of malignant cholera, namely, frequent\r\nvomiting, copious rice-water stools, cramps of the abdominal muscles and\r\nflexion of the extremities, coldness of the skin, tongue, and breath,\r\nblueness of the nails, dull, sunken eyes, contracted pupils, and\r\ncollapse of the features. The two others had at first similar symptoms,\r\nwhich passed into those of chronic dysentery, and proved fatal in a few\r\nweeks.[2287]—M. Caffe has related the case of a young lady who destroyed\r\nherself by taking five ounces of the wine containing the active matter\r\nof rather more than the fourth part of one bulb. She was soon seized\r\nwith acute pain in the stomach, then with frequent vomiting, general\r\ncoldness and paleness, a sense of tightness in the chest and oppression\r\nof the breathing, a slow thready pulse, and extreme prostration,—and\r\nsubsequently with severe and constant cramps in the soles of the feet.\r\nIn eleven hours she had less frequent efforts to vomit, but was\r\nexcessively exhausted; in twenty hours the pulse was imperceptible; and\r\nin two hours more she died. There was no suppression of urine, no\r\npurging, no diminution of sensibility, delirium, convulsions, or change\r\nin the state of the pupils.[2288] About a twelvemonth afterwards the\r\nsister of this patient put an end to herself with the same preparation,\r\nof which she took the same quantity; and she died, with precisely the\r\nsame symptoms, in twenty-eight hours.[2289] M. Ollivier met with two\r\ncases of death within twenty-four hours, in consequence of a tincture\r\nbeing taken which contained the active part of forty-eight grains of the\r\ndry bulb; and a third case of death in three days caused by three doses\r\nof a watery decoction made each time with 46 grains of the bruised bulb\r\ncollected in July. Severe purging and prostration followed each dose.\r\nThere was no symptom of any affection of the brain.[2290]—Mr. Henderson\r\ndescribes a case occasioned by an ounce of the tincture. No injury\r\naccrued for three hours. The patient then had gnawing pain in the\r\nstomach followed by vomiting, and then by purging, at first bilious,\r\nafterwards watery, and attended with numbness in the feet, and\r\nsubsequently a sense of prickling. In the course of the second day there\r\nwas intense gnawing pain in all the joints of the extremities, profuse\r\nacid sweating, tightness in the head, and pain in the hindhead and nape\r\nof the neck. Blood-letting, laxatives, and hyoscyamus were employed with\r\nsuccess; but the case seems very nearly to have proved fatal.[2291]\r\n\r\nThe seeds produce similar effects. Bernt has noticed the cases of two\r\nchildren who were poisoned by a handful of colchicum seeds, and who\r\ndied in a day, affected with violent vomiting and purging.[2292] Mr.\r\nFereday of Dudley relates a carefully detailed case of a man who died\r\nin forty-seven hours after swallowing by mistake two ounces of the\r\nwine of the seeds, and in whom the symptoms were acute pain, coming on\r\nin an hour and a half, then retching, vomiting, and tenesmus, feeble\r\npulse, anxious expression, afterwards incessant coffee-coloured\r\nvomiting, suppression of urine, excessive weakness of the limbs and\r\nfeeble respiration, and, for a short period before death, profuse,\r\ndark, watery purging. There was neither insensibility nor\r\nconvulsions.[2293]—Blumhardt relates a similar case caused by an\r\ninfusion of a large table-spoonful of the seeds. In three-quarters of\r\nan hour the man was seized with griping, and then profuse diarrhœa and\r\nvomiting. Next morning, twelve hours after the poison was taken, his\r\nphysician found him still affected with vomiting and purging, but not\r\nwith pain. He seemed, indeed, to suffer so little, and to improve so\r\nmuch under the use of emollients, that he was thought to be fairly\r\nrecovering. But next day the pulse was almost imperceptible, the\r\ncountenance and extremities were cold, the voice hoarse, the breathing\r\nhurried, the eyes sunk, the pupils dilated, the epigastrium tender,\r\nand the forehead affected with pain; and he died at twelve the same\r\nday.[2294]\r\n\r\nThe leaves, too, are poisonous. Dr. Bleifus has related a case in proof\r\nof this. A man gathered the leaves in the middle of May, and, after\r\ncooking them, ate about two ounces for supper. In six hours he was\r\nseized with violent colic, vomiting, and purging. In fifteen hours, when\r\nhis physician first saw him, the countenance was ghastly as in malignant\r\ncholera, the pupils dilated and scarcely contractile, but the mind\r\nentire. He complained of rheumatic pains in the neck, and burning pain\r\nin the pit of the stomach. He had frequent vomiting and purging, spasms\r\nof the muscles of the belly, coldness of the skin, a slow, small, wiry\r\npulse, and cramps of the fingers and the calves of the legs. Coffee and\r\nlemon-juice allayed the vomiting, and a temporary amendment ensued. But\r\nearly on the third morning he became worse, and soon afterwards the\r\nnarrator of the case found him dying.[2295]\r\n\r\nThe flowers are not less poisonous than the bulbs, leaves, and seeds. A\r\ncase is noticed in Geiger’s Journal of poisoning with a decoction of\r\nsome handfuls of the flowers, where death occurred within twenty-four\r\nhours, under incessant colic, vomiting and purging.[2296]\r\n\r\nDoubts exist as to the degree of activity of colchicum. Some\r\npractitioners direct half an ounce of the tincture of the seeds to be\r\ngiven as a medicinal dose,[2297] even four times a day.[2298] Others\r\nadminister from one to two drachms night and morning. According to more\r\ngeneral experience, these are dangerous doses. Dr. Lewins, junior, has\r\nseen dangerous symptoms from a drachm given thrice a day for a\r\nweek;[2299] a fatal case occurred a few years ago in the Edinburgh\r\nInfirmary, from this amount having been given for a few days only; I\r\nhave known very violent effects produced by half an ounce taken by\r\nmistake, although most of it was brought away by emetics in an hour;\r\nand, in medical practice, I have seldom seen the dose of a sound\r\npreparation gradually raised to a drachm thrice a day, without such\r\nsevere purging and sickness ensuing as rendered it prudent to diminish\r\nor discontinue the remedy. There is no doubt, however, that larger doses\r\nhave occasionally been taken without any ill effect. Constitutional\r\npeculiarity can alone account for such differences in the instance of\r\nthe tincture of the seeds. As to the preparations of the bulb, an\r\nadditional source of diversity of effect is a difference in the activity\r\nof the bulb according to season. On this point no accurate facts have\r\nyet been brought forward. The bulb is usually directed to be gathered in\r\nJuly, when it is most plump and firm, and most charged with starch.\r\nOrfila, however, says that three bulbs, collected at this time, had no\r\neffect whatever on a dog;[2300] and Buchner maintains that it is most\r\nenergetic in the autumn, when the flowering stem is rising.[2301] I\r\nsuspect, on the other hand, that it is very energetic in the spring,\r\nwhen it is watery, more membranous, and shrivels much in drying; for it\r\nis then very bitter.\r\n\r\nThe morbid appearances are chiefly those of inflammation of the\r\nalimentary canal.\r\n\r\nIn the bodies of the children mentioned by Bernt there was considerable\r\nredness of the stomach and small intestines; in Geiger’s case\r\ninflammation of the stomach and duodenum only; in the case mentioned in\r\nthe Edinburgh Journal, and in that related by Chevallier, there was no\r\nmorbid appearance at all to be found. In Mr. Fereday’s case the omentum\r\nwas curled and folded up between the stomach on the one hand, and the\r\nliver and diaphragm on the other; the stomach and intestines were coated\r\nwith much mucus; there was no appearances of inflammation there but on\r\ntwo points, one in the stomach, the other in the jejunum, where a red\r\npatch appeared, owing to blood effused between the muscular and\r\nperitoneal coats; the bladder was empty, the pleura red, the lungs much\r\ngorged, their surface, as well as that of the diaphragm and heart,\r\ncovered with ecchymosed spots; and the skin over most of the body\r\npresented patches of a purple efflorescence.—In Blumhardt’s case the\r\nmuscles were rigid twenty-three hours after death; the heart and great\r\nvessels contained coagulated blood; the cardiac end of the gullet was\r\ninternally dark-violet; the stomach externally of a clear violet hue,\r\nand its veins turgid; the gall-bladder turgid with greenish-yellow bile;\r\nand the inner membrane of the whole small intestines chequered here and\r\nthere with red, inflamed-like spots.[2302]—In one of M. Caffe’s cases\r\nthere was congestion of the cerebral vessels, coagulated blood in the\r\nheart, uniform grayness, softness, and brittleness of the mucous coat of\r\nthe stomach, and enlargement of the muciparous follicles of the small\r\nintestines, as well as unusual distinctness and lividity of the Peyerian\r\nglands. In the other case putrefaction was so far advanced in\r\nforty-eight hours as to make the appearances equivocal.\r\n\r\nThe treatment consists in evacuation of the stomach and bowels by\r\nemetics and oleaginous laxatives in the early stage, and afterwards in\r\nthe employment of opium, stimulants, the warm bath, and occasionally\r\nblood-letting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Of Poisoning with Foxglove._\r\n\r\nFoxglove, or _Digitalis purpura_, a plant which is common in this\r\ncountry both as a native and in gardens, possesses powerful and peculiar\r\nproperties. The leaves are considered its most active part. They contain\r\nan alkaloid; but chemists have not fixed its nature with precision. M.\r\nLe Royer of Geneva procured a pitchy, deliquescent, uncrystallizable\r\nsubstance;[2303] but more lately M. Pauguy obtained a principle in fine\r\nacicular crystals, soluble in alcohol and ether, but insoluble in water,\r\nalkaline in its reaction, and of a very acrid taste. This principle is\r\ncalled digitalin.[2304] It seems to be the same substance, which has\r\nalso been detected by Radig, as quoted by Dr. Pereira.[2305] The leaves,\r\nlike those of other narcotic vegetables, yield by destructive\r\ndistillation an empyreumatic oil similar in chemical qualities and\r\nphysiological effects to the empyreumatic oil of hyoscyamus.[2306]\r\n\r\nFrom an extensive series of experiments on animals by Orfila with the\r\npowder, extract and tincture of the leaves, foxglove appears to cause in\r\nmoderate doses vomiting, giddiness, languor, and death in twenty-four\r\nhours, without any other symptoms of note; but in larger doses, it\r\nlikewise produces tremors, convulsions, stupor and coma. It acts\r\nenergetically both when applied to a wound, and when injected into a\r\nvein.[2307] Mr. Blake has inferred from his researches, that when\r\ninjected into the jugular vein, it occasions both obstruction of the\r\npulmonary capillaries, and direct depression of the heart’s action. In\r\nthe dog an infusion of three drachms of leaves arrested in five seconds\r\nthe action of the heart; which was motionless after death, turgid,\r\ninirritable, and full of florid blood in its left cavities. An infusion\r\nof an ounce, injected back into the aorta from the axillary artery,\r\ncaused in ten seconds great obstruction of the systemic capillaries,\r\nindicated by sudden increase of arterial pressure in the\r\nhæmadynamometer; the heart was unaffected for forty-five seconds, when\r\nit became slow in its pulsations, and the arterial pressure diminished;\r\nand in four minutes the heart ceased to beat, although for a little\r\nlonger it continued excitable by stimulation. As no affection of the\r\nbrain or spine was apparent before the heart became affected, the author\r\ninfers that the action depends on the poisoned blood being circulated\r\nthrough the substance of the heart, and not on any intermediate\r\ninfluence upon the nervous centre.[2308]\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Man._—Upon man its effects as a poison have been frequently\r\nnoticed, partly in consequence of its being given by mistake in too\r\nlarge a dose as a medicine, partly on account of the singular property\r\nit possesses, in common with mercury, of accumulating silently in the\r\nsystem, when given long in moderate doses, and at length producing\r\nconstitutional effects even after it has been discontinued. The effects\r\nof a dose somewhat larger than is usually given, are great nausea,\r\nfrontal headache, sense of disagreeable dryness in the gums and pharynx,\r\nsome salivation, giddiness, weakness of the limbs, feebleness and\r\nincreased frequency of the pulse, in a few hours an appearance of sparks\r\nbefore the eyes, and subsequently dimness of vision, and a feeling of\r\npressure on the eyeballs. These effects may be occasioned by so small a\r\ndose as two or three grains of good foxglove.[2309] The symptoms arising\r\nfrom its gradual accumulation are in the slighter cases nausea,\r\nvomiting, giddiness, want of sleep, sense of heat throughout the body,\r\nand of pulsation in the head, general depression, great languor and\r\ncommonly retardation of the pulse, sometimes diarrhœa, sometimes\r\nsalivation, and for the most part profuse sweating. A good instance of\r\nthis form of the effects of foxglove is mentioned in the Medical\r\nGazette. A man took it at his own hand for dropsy during twenty days,\r\nwhen the pulse sank to half its previous frequency, he was seized with\r\nrestless, want of sleep, incoherent talking with imaginary persons,\r\ndilated pupils, nausea, thirst, and increase of urine; and these\r\ncomplaints did not materially subside for six days.[2310] The depressed\r\naction of the heart may be the occasion of death in particular\r\ncircumstances. Mr. Brande mentions from the experience of Dr. Pemberton\r\nthe case of an elderly woman, who, while under the full influence of\r\nfoxglove, fell in a fainting fit on walking across the floor; after\r\nwhich, although she at first got better, there were frequent attacks of\r\nfainting and vomiting till she died.[2311] In other instances\r\nconvulsions also occur; and it appears from a case mentioned by Dr.\r\nBlackall, that the disorder thus induced may prove fatal. One of his\r\npatients, while taking two drachms of the infusion of the leaves daily,\r\nwas attacked with pain over the eyes and confusion, followed in\r\ntwenty-four hours by profuse watery diarrhœa, delirium, general\r\nconvulsions, insensibility, and an almost complete stoppage of the\r\npulse. Although some relief was derived from an opiate clyster, the\r\nconvulsions continued to recur in frequent paroxysms for three weeks; in\r\nthe intervals he was forgetful and delirious; and at length he died in\r\none of the convulsive fits.[2312]\r\n\r\nA case which exemplifies the effects of a single large dose is related\r\nin the Edinburgh Journal. An old woman drank ten ounces of a decoction\r\nmade from a handful of the leaves in a quart of water. She grew sick in\r\nthe course of an hour, and for two days she had incessant retching and\r\nvomiting, with great faintness and cold sweats in the intervals, some\r\nsalivation and swelling of the lips, and a pulse feeble, irregular,\r\nintermitting, and not above 40. She had also suppression of urine for\r\nthree days.[2313]\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar instance may be found in the Journal de Médecine. A\r\nman, fifty-five years old took by mistake a drachm instead of a grain\r\nfor asthma, and was attacked in an hour with vomiting, giddiness,\r\nexcessive debility, so that he could not stand, loss of sight, colic,\r\nand slow pulse. These effects continued more or less for four days, when\r\nthe vomiting ceased; and the other symptoms then successively\r\ndisappeared, the vision, however, remaining depraved for nearly a\r\nfortnight.[2314]\r\n\r\nA very interesting fatal case, which arose from an over-dose\r\nadministered by a quack doctor, and which became the ground of a\r\ncriminal trial at London in 1826, is shortly noticed in the same\r\nJournal. Six ounces of a strong decoction when taken as a laxative early\r\nin the morning. Vomiting, colic, and purging, were the first symptoms;\r\ntowards the afternoon lethargy supervened; about midnight the colic and\r\npurging returned; afterwards general convulsions made their appearance;\r\nand a surgeon, who saw the patient at an early hour of the succeeding\r\nmorning, found him violently convulsed, with the pupils dilated and\r\ninsensible, and the pulse, slow, feeble, and irregular. Coma gradually\r\nsucceeded, and death took place in twenty-two hours after the poison was\r\nswallowed.[2315]\r\n\r\nThis is the only case in which I have seen an account of the appearances\r\nin the dead body, and they are related imperfectly. It is merely said\r\nthat the external membranes of the brain were much injected with blood,\r\nand the inner coat of the stomach red in some parts.\r\n\r\nThe affections induced by poisoning with digitalis are often much more\r\nlasting than the effects of most other vegetable narcotics. Dr.\r\nBlackall’s case is one instance in point, and another no less remarkable\r\nin its details is described in Corvisart’s Journal. The usual local and\r\nconstitutional symptoms were produced by a drachm of the powder being\r\ntaken by mistake; and the slowness of the pulse did not begin to go off\r\nfor seven days, the affection of the sight not for five days more.[2316]\r\n\r\nThe preparations of foxglove are very uncertain in strength. From what I\r\nhave observed in the course of their medicinal employment, I conceive\r\nfew powders retain the active properties of the leaves, and even not\r\nmany tinctures. Two ounces of the tincture of the London College have\r\nbeen taken in two doses with a short interval between them, yet without\r\ncausing any inconvenience.[2317] This assuredly could not happen with a\r\nsound preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Of Poisoning with Rue._\r\n\r\nThe _Ruta graveolens_, or rue, although its wild variety is expressly\r\ndeclared by Dioscorides to be mortal when taken too largely, has\r\nattracted little attention as a poison in recent times, and is indeed\r\nscarcely considered deleterious. Orfila seems to have found it by no\r\nmeans active; for the juice of two pounds of leaves, secured in the\r\nstomach of a dog by tying the gullet, did not prove fatal till the\r\nsecond day, the symptoms were not well marked, and the only appearances\r\nin the dead body were the signs of slight inflammation in the stomach.\r\nEven when the distilled water was injected into a vein, the only effects\r\nwere a temporary nervous disorder similar to intoxication.[2318]\r\n\r\nAccording to the late experimental inquiry, however, by M. Hélie,[2319]\r\nrue is possessed of peculiar and energetic properties. All parts of its\r\norganization, especially the roots and leaves, produce the effects of\r\nthe narcotico-acrid poisons; and although he never met with any instance\r\nof a fatal result, its activity is such as to render this event not\r\nimprobable, even when the dose is by no means very large. His attention\r\nwas drawn to the subject in consequence of finding, that it was often\r\nemployed in his neighbourhood for producing abortion,—a property\r\nascribed to it immemorially by the country people of France; and all the\r\ninstances he has seen of its poisonous action were cases in which it had\r\nbeen given with this object. Sometimes the juice of the leaves is given,\r\nsometimes an infusion of them, sometimes a decoction of the root; and in\r\none instance a woman took a decoction of two roots, each about as thick\r\nas the finger. The effects were, severe pain in the stomach, followed by\r\nviolent and obstinate vomiting, drowsiness, giddiness, confusion,\r\ndimness of sight, difficult articulation, staggering, contracted pupils,\r\nconvulsive movements of the head and arms, like those of chorea,\r\nretention of urine, slowness of the pulse, and great prostration. There\r\nwas never any purging. In the course of two days or a little more\r\nmiscarriage took place, preceded by the usual precursors, and followed\r\nby abatement of the symptoms of poisoning. At the period of the\r\nmilk-fever, however, these symptoms again increased, and the patient was\r\nalso attacked with swelling and pain in the tongue and copious\r\nsalivation. In about ten days the pulse began to increase in frequency;\r\nand a mild typhoid fever commonly succeeded, from which recovery took\r\nplace slowly. In another case the symptoms throughout their whole course\r\nwere so mild, that, although miscarriage occurred, the subject of it was\r\nnot confined to bed, and in fifteen days recovered her health\r\ncompletely. M. Hélie adds, that with full knowledge of the doubts\r\nentertained by eminent authorities, whether any substance whatever\r\npossesses a peculiar property of inducing miscarriage, he is strongly\r\npersuaded that rue is really a substance of the kind, and that it will\r\ntake effect even when there is no natural tendency to miscarriage, or\r\nany particular weakness of constitution.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these statements, it may be suspected that M. Hélie has\r\noverrated both its poisonous properties and its virtues as a drug\r\ncapable of inducing miscarriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Of Poisoning with Ipecacuan._\r\n\r\nIpecacuan is well known as an emetic. It is procured from a plant of the\r\nnatural family Rubiaceæ, the _Cephaëlis ipecacuanha_. It contains a\r\npeculiar principle, not yet crystallized, which is white, permanent in\r\nthe air, sparingly soluble in water, easily soluble in alcohol and\r\nether, fusible about 122° F., capable of forming crystallizable salts\r\nwith acids, and possessing an alkaline reaction on litmus. It was\r\ndiscovered by M. Pelletier.[2320]\r\n\r\nIpecacuan itself is not known to be a poison; because in consequence of\r\nits emetic properties it is quickly discharged from the stomach. But in\r\ndoses of considerable magnitude it would probably be dangerous. In some\r\nconstitutions the odoriferous effluvia from the powder induce difficult\r\nbreathing, anxiety, and imperfect convulsions. I have met with several\r\ninstances of this singular idiosyncrasy, and one in particular where the\r\nsubject of it, a surgeon’s apprentice, suffered so often and so severely\r\nas to be induced to abandon the medical profession. A German physician,\r\nDr. Prieger, has published a remarkable case of a druggist’s servant,\r\nwho, in consequence of incautiously inhaling the dust of ipecacuan\r\npowder, was attacked with a sense of tightness in the chest, vomiting,\r\nand soon after an alarming sense of suffocation from tightness of the\r\nthroat. When these symptoms had continued several hours the uneasiness\r\nin the throat was removed after the use of a decoction of uva-ursi and\r\nrhatany-root; but the dyspnœa remained several days.[2321]\r\n\r\nIts active principle, emeta, is a powerful poison. Two grains of the\r\npure alkaloid will kill a dog; and the symptoms are frequent vomiting,\r\nfollowed by sopor and coma, and death in fifteen or twenty-four hours.\r\nIn the dead body the lungs and stomach are found inflamed. The same\r\neffects result from injecting it into a vein, or applying it to a\r\nwound.[2322] It appears, then, to be a narcotico-acrid. But its irritant\r\nproperties are so prominent that it might be properly arranged with the\r\nvegetable acrids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n     OF POISONING WITH STRYCHNIA, NUX VOMICA, AND FALSE ANGUSTURA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next group of the narcotico-acrids includes a few vegetable poisons\r\nthat act in a very peculiar manner. They induce violent spasms, exactly\r\nlike tetanus, and cause death during a fit, probably by suspending the\r\nrespiration. But they do not impair the sensibility. During the\r\nintervals of the fits the sensibility is on the contrary heightened, and\r\nthe faculties are acute.\r\n\r\nDeath, however, does not always take place by tetanus. In some cases the\r\ndeparture of the convulsions has been followed by a fatal state of\r\ngeneral and indescribable exhaustion.\r\n\r\nBesides thus acting violently on the nervous system, they also possess\r\nlocal irritant properties; but these are seldom observed on account of\r\nthe deadliness and quickness of their remote operation on the spine and\r\nnerves.\r\n\r\nThey exert their action by entering the blood-vessels. The dose required\r\nto prove fatal is exceedingly small. The organ acted on is chiefly the\r\nspinal cord; but sometimes they seem also to act on the heart.\r\n\r\nThey seldom leave any morbid appearances in the dead body. Like the\r\nother causes of death by obstructed respiration, such as drowning and\r\nstrangling, they produce venous congestion; but this is frequently\r\ninconsiderable. Sometimes, however, they leave signs of inflammation in\r\nthe alimentary canal.\r\n\r\nTheir energy resides in peculiar alkaloids. The only poisons included in\r\nthis group, are derived from the genus _Strychnos_. The bark of _Brucea\r\nantidysenterica_ was long supposed also to possess similar properties;\r\nbut it is now known that the bark of _Strychnos nux-vomica_ was mistaken\r\nfor the bark of that tree.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of _Strychnos_ have been examined, namely, the _S.\r\nNux-vomica_, the _S. Sancti Ignatii_ or St. Ignatius bean, the _S.\r\ncolubrina_, or snake-wood, the _S. tieuté_, which yields an Indian\r\npoison the Upas tieuté, the _S. Guianensis_, and likewise the _S.\r\npotatorum_ and _Pseudo-kina_; and all have been found to possess the\r\nsame remarkable properties, except the last two, which are inert.\r\n\r\nAll of them, except the _S. pseudo-kina_, and probably the _S.\r\npotatorum_,[2323] contain an alkaloid to which their poisonous\r\nproperties are owing. This is _strychnia_ or strychnin, a substance\r\nwhich has lately been made the subject of many experiments by chemists\r\nand physiologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Of Poisoning with Strychnia._\r\n\r\nStrychnia was discovered by Pelletier and Caventou soon after the\r\ndiscovery of morphia.[2324] For an account of the best process for\r\npreparing it, the reader may consult a paper by M. Henry in the journal\r\nquoted below.[2325]\r\n\r\nIts leading properties are the following. Its crystals when pure are\r\nelongated octaedres. It has a most intensely bitter taste, perceptible,\r\nit is said, when a grain is dissolved in 80 pounds of water.[2326] It is\r\nvery sparingly soluble in water, but easily soluble in alcohol and the\r\nvolatile oils. Its alcoholic solution has an alkaline reaction. It forms\r\nneutral and crystallizable salts with the acids. In its ordinary form it\r\nis turned orange-red by the action of nitric acid; which tint becomes\r\nviolet-blue on the gradual addition of hydrosulphate of ammonia. The\r\naction of nitric acid is owing to the presence of a yellow colouring\r\nmatter, or of another alkaloid, brucia, which is also contained in nux\r\nvomica, but exists in larger quantity in the false angustura bark. Pure\r\nstrychnia is not turned orange-red by nitric acid.[2327]\r\n\r\nNo poison is endowed with more destructive energy than strychnia. I have\r\nkilled a dog in two minutes with a sixth part of a grain injected in the\r\nform of alcoholic solution into the chest; I have seen a wild-boar\r\nkilled in the same manner with the third of a grain in ten minutes; and\r\nthere is little doubt that half a grain thrust into a wound might kill a\r\nman in less than a quarter of an hour. It acts in whatever way it is\r\nintroduced into the system, but most energetically when injected into a\r\nvein. The symptoms produced are very uniform and striking. The animal\r\nbecomes agitated and trembles, and is then seized with stiffness and\r\nstarting of the limbs. These symptoms increase till at length it is\r\nattacked with a fit of violent general spasm, in which the head is bent\r\nback, the spine stiffened, the limbs extended and rigid, and the\r\nrespiration checked by the fixing of the chest. The fit is then\r\nsucceeded by an interval of calm, during which the senses are quite\r\nentire or unnaturally acute. But another paroxysm soon sets in, and then\r\nanother and another, till at length a fit takes place more violent than\r\nany before it; and the animal perishes suffocated. The first symptoms\r\nappear in 60 or 90 seconds, when the poison is applied to a wound. When\r\nit is injected into the pleura, I have known them begin in 45 seconds,\r\nand Pelletier and Caventou have seen them begin in 15 seconds.[2328] M.\r\nBouillaud has recently found that it has no effect when directly applied\r\nto the nerves.[2329] The experiments of Mr. Blake tend to show, that its\r\naction is exerted solely on the nervous system, and that it has no\r\ndirect action on the heart, even when directly admitted into the blood\r\nby the jugular vein.[2330] It appears to act peculiarly by irritating\r\nthe spinal cord.\r\n\r\nDangerous effects have often been occasioned by an accidental over-dose\r\nin ordinary medical practice. These are well exemplified by a case\r\ncommunicated to Dr. Bardsley by Dr. Booth of Birmingham. A man of 46,\r\naffected with hemiplegia for nearly four weeks, began to use strychnia,\r\nand had been affected by it for eleven days without particular\r\ninconvenience. During this period he took twice a day gradually\r\nincreasing doses, till the amount of one grain was attained; when the\r\nusual physiological effect having ceased to occur, the quantity was\r\nincreased to a grain and a half. But the first dose caused anxiety and\r\nexcitability, in three hours stupor and loss of speech, and at length\r\nviolent tetanic convulsions, which proved fatal in three hours and\r\nthree-quarters.[2331] A fatal case, occasioned by the large dose of two\r\nscruples, has been recorded by a German physician, Dr. Blumhardt. In\r\nfifteen minutes, imperfect vomiting was brought on by emetics. At this\r\ntime, the patient, a lad of seventeen, lay on his back, quite stiff, and\r\nwith incipient fits of locked-jaw. The spasms gradually extended to the\r\nrest of the body, till at last violent fits of general tetanus were\r\nestablished, under which the whole body became as stiff as a board, the\r\narms spasmodically crossed over the chest, the legs extended, the feet\r\nbent, so that the soles were concave, the breathing arrested, the\r\neyeballs prominent, the pupils dilated and not contractile, and the\r\npulse hurried and irregular. In the second severe fit he died, one hour\r\nand a half after taking the poison.[2332] I have known very dangerous\r\ntetanic spasm induced by so small a dose as two-thirds of a grain of the\r\nordinary impure strychnia of the shops; and Dr. Pereira describes a\r\ncase, communicated by a friend, where death was occasioned by a dose of\r\nhalf a grain administered three times a day.[2333] As each fit of spasm\r\nwent off, respiration, which was found to have ceased, was maintained\r\nartificially; but no sooner did natural breathing return, than the\r\nparoxysm of tetanus returned also; and at length artificial inflation of\r\nthe lungs failed to restore life.\r\n\r\nThe only accounts I have seen of the morbid appearances after death from\r\nstrychnia are in the cases of Dr. Booth and Dr. Blumhardt. In the\r\nformer, the muscles were in a rigid state, the fingers contracted, the\r\nvessels of the brain gorged, the membranes of the spinal cord highly\r\ninjected; and four patches of extravasated blood were found between the\r\nspinal arachnoid and the external membrane. In the latter, twenty-four\r\nhours after death, there was general lividity of the skin, and\r\nextraordinary rigidity of the muscles. Fluid blood flowed in abundance\r\nfrom the spinal cavity, where the veins were gorged, the pia mater\r\ninjected, the spinal column softened at its upper part, and here and\r\nthere almost pulpy. There was also congestion and softening of the\r\nbrain. The head and great vessels were flaccid, and contained scarcely\r\nany blood. The inner membrane of the stomach and intestines presented\r\nsome redness, but not more than is often seen independently of\r\nirritation there.\r\n\r\nStrychnia has been found by Pelletier and Caventou in four species of\r\n_Strychnos_, the _S. nux vomica_, _Sancti Ignatii_, _Colubrina_, and\r\n_Tieuté_; and from the researches of MM. Martius and Herberger on the\r\ncomposition and properties of the American poison Wourali, it is also\r\nprobably contained in the _S. guianensis_.[2334] Vauquelin could not\r\nfind it in the _S. pseudo-kina_, which is destitute of bitterness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Of Poisoning with Nux Vomica._\r\n\r\n_Tests of Nux Vomica._—Nux vomica, the most common of these poisons, is\r\na flat, roundish seed, hardly an inch in diameter, of a yellowish or\r\ngreenish-brown colour, covered with short silky hair, and presenting a\r\nlittle prominence on the middle of one of its surfaces. In powder it has\r\na dirty greenish-gray colour, an intensely bitter taste, and an odour\r\nlike powder of liquorice. It inflames on burning charcoal, and when\r\ntreated with nitric acid acquires an orange-red colour, which is\r\ndestroyed by the addition of protochloride of tin. Its infusion also is\r\nturned orange-red by nitric acid, and precipitated grayish-white with\r\ntincture of galls.\r\n\r\nOrfila and Barruel have made some experiments on the mode of detecting\r\nit in the stomach, and the following is the plan recommended by them.\r\nThe contents of the stomach, or the powder, if it can be separated, must\r\nbe boiled in water acidulated with sulphuric acid. The liquid after\r\nfiltration is neutralized with carbonate of lime, and then evaporated to\r\ndryness. The dry mass is then acted on with successive portions of\r\nalcohol, and evaporated to the consistence of a thin syrup. The product\r\nhas an intensely bitter taste, yields a precipitate with ammonia,\r\nbecomes deep orange-red with nitric acid, and will sometimes deposit\r\ncrystals of strychnia on standing two or three days.[2335] By this\r\nprocess Dr. R. D. Thomson, in a case which proved fatal in three hours,\r\ndetected nux-vomica, although vomiting had been induced by\r\nemetics.[2336]\r\n\r\nThese experiments it is important to remember, because, contrary to what\r\ntakes place in regard to vegetable poisons generally, nux vomica is\r\noften found in the stomachs of those poisoned with it.\r\n\r\n_Its Mode of Action and Symptoms in Man._—The poisonous properties of\r\nnux vomica are now well known to the vulgar; and in consequence it is\r\noccasionally made the instrument of voluntary death, although no poison\r\ncauses such torture. It is difficult to conceive, considering its\r\nintensely bitter taste, how any one could make it the instrument of\r\nmurder. But a fact is stated in Rust’s Journal, which shows that it may\r\nbe used for that purpose. At a drinking party one man wagered with\r\nanother, that if he took a little _Cocculus indicus_ in beer, he would\r\nbe compelled to walk home on his head. The wager was taken and the\r\npotion drunk; but nux vomica was substituted for the Cocculus indicus,\r\nitself too a virulent poison; and the man went home and died in\r\nconvulsions fifteen minutes afterwards.[2337]\r\n\r\nMany experiments have been made on animals with nux vomica; but the\r\nfirst accurate inquiry was that of Magendie and Delille read before the\r\nFrench Institute in 1809. The symptoms they remarked were precisely the\r\nsame with those produced by strychnia. Half a drachm of the powder\r\nkilled a dog in forty-five minutes, and a grain and a half of the\r\nalcoholic extract thrust into a wound killed another in seven minutes.\r\nThe animals uniformly experienced dreadful fits of tetanic spasm, with\r\nintervals of relaxation and sensibility, and were carried off during a\r\nparoxysm.\r\n\r\nThe cause of death appears to be prolonged spasm of the thoracic muscles\r\nof respiration. The spasm of these muscles is apparent in the unavailing\r\nefforts which the animals make to inspire. The external muscles of the\r\nchest may be felt during the fits as hard almost as bone; and, according\r\nto an experiment of Wepfer, the diaphragm partakes in the spasm of the\r\nexternal muscles.[2338]\r\n\r\nOn account of the singular symptoms of irritation of the spinal cord,\r\nuncombined with any injury of the brain, this poison is believed to act\r\non the spinal marrow alone. This is farther shown by the experiments of\r\nMr. Blake with strychnia alluded to above. But from some experiments by\r\nSegalas it appears also to exhaust the irritability of the heart: for in\r\nanimals he found that organ could not be stimulated to contract after\r\ndeath, and life could not be prolonged by artificial breathing.[2339] A\r\nsimilar observation was made long ago by Wepfer, who found the heart\r\nmotionless and distended with arterial blood in its left cavities;[2340]\r\nand a case of poisoning in the human subject to the same effect will be\r\npresently related. The pulse is always very weak, often wholly\r\nsuppressed during a paroxysm; and in the case alluded to it was found on\r\ndissection pale, flaccid and empty, having been apparently affected with\r\nspasm. The action exerted through the medium of the spinal cord on the\r\nmuscles is wholly independent of the brain; for Stannius found that in\r\nfrogs the removal of the brain does not interfere with the\r\neffects.[2341]\r\n\r\nOf late poisoning with nux vomica has been common. The most\r\ncharacteristic example yet published is a case related by Mr. Ollier, of\r\na young woman, who in a fit of melancholy, took between two and three\r\ndrachms of the powder in water. When the surgeon first saw her, half an\r\nhour afterwards, she was quite well. But going away in search of an\r\nemetic, and returning in ten minutes, he found her in a state of great\r\nalarm, with the limbs extended and separated, and the pulse faint and\r\nquick. She then had a slight and transient convulsion succeeded by much\r\nagitation and anxiety. In a few minutes she had another, and not long\r\nafterwards a third, each about two minutes in duration. During these\r\nfits, “the whole body was stiffened and straightened, the legs pushed\r\nout and forced wide apart; no pulse or breathing could be perceived; the\r\nface and hands were livid, and the muscles of the former violently\r\nconvulsed.” In the short intervals between the fits she was quite\r\nsensible, had a feeble rapid pulse, complained of sickness with great\r\nthirst, and perspired freely. “A fourth and most violent fit soon\r\nsucceeded, in which the whole body was extended to the utmost from head\r\nto foot. From this she never recovered: she seemed to fall into a state\r\nof asphyxia, relaxed her grasp, and dropped her hands on her knees. Her\r\nbrows, however, remained contracted, her lips drawn apart, salivary foam\r\nissued from the corners of the mouth, and the expression of the\r\ncountenance was altogether most horrific.” She died an hour after\r\nswallowing the poison.[2342]—A case precisely similar, produced by three\r\npence worth of the powder, and fatal in little more than an hour, is\r\nrelated by Mr. Watt of Glasgow.[2343]—Another apparently also similar\r\nbut fatal in three hours, is related by Dr. R. D. Thomson.[2344] There\r\nis in fact very little variety of symptoms in different cases, where\r\ndeath occurs in the primary stage.—Occasionally even in such rapid cases\r\nthere is a little vomiting in the first instance. This was remarked in\r\nMr. Watt’s case, and also in another described by MM. Orfila and\r\nOllivier.[2345]\r\n\r\nWhen death does not take place thus suddenly in a fit of spasm, the\r\nperson continues to be affected for twelve or sixteen hours with\r\nsimilar, but milder paroxysms; and afterwards he may either recover\r\nwithout farther symptoms, or expire in a short time apparently from\r\nexhaustion, or suffer an attack of inflammation of the stomach and\r\nintestines, which may or may not prove fatal.\r\n\r\nM. Jules Cloquet has described a case, where the patient seemed to die\r\nof the excessive exhaustion produced by the violent, long continued\r\nspasms. The tetanic fits lasted about twenty-four hours, the sensibility\r\nin the intervals being acute. Slight signs of irritation in the stomach\r\nsucceeded; and death ensued on the fourth morning.[2346]\r\n\r\nIn the Bulletins of the Medical Society of Emulation another case is\r\nrelated, which arose from an over-dose of the alcoholic extract being\r\ntaken by an old woman who was using it for palsy. She took three grains\r\nat once. Violent tetanus was soon produced; and afterwards she had a\r\nregular attack of inflammation of the stomach and intestines, which\r\nproved fatal in three days.\r\n\r\nThe last instance to be noticed exemplifies very well the effects of the\r\npoison when the quantity is insufficient to cause death. A young woman\r\nswallowed purposely a drachm mixed in a glass of wine. In fifteen\r\nminutes she was seized with pain and heat in the stomach, burning in the\r\ngullet, a sense of rending and weariness in the limbs succeeded by\r\nstiffness of the joints, convulsive tremors, tottering in her gait, and\r\nat length violent and frequent fits of tetanus. Milk given after the\r\ntetanus began excited vomiting. She was farther affected with redness of\r\nthe gums, inflammation of the tongue, burning thirst, and pain in the\r\nstomach. The pulse also became quick, and the skin hot. Next day, though\r\nthe fits had ceased, the muscles were very sore, especially on motion.\r\nThe tongue and palate were inflamed, and there was thirst, pain in the\r\nstomach, vomiting, colic and diarrhœa. These symptoms, however, abated,\r\nand on the fourth day disappeared, leaving her exceedingly weak.[2347]\r\n\r\nThis and the previous case show clearly the double narcotico-acrid\r\nproperties of the poison.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the dose requisite to prove fatal, the smallest fatal\r\ndose of the alcoholic extract yet recorded is three grains, which was\r\nthe quantity taken in the case from the Parisian bulletins: Hoffmann\r\nmentions a fatal case caused by two fifteen grain doses of the\r\npowder;[2348] and in Hufeland’s Journal there is another caused by two\r\ndrachms, which was fatal in two hours.[2349]—A dog has been killed by\r\neight grains of the powder, and a cat by five.[2350] It is even said\r\nthat a dog has been killed by two grains.[2351]\r\n\r\nIt has been thought, from some observations by Mr. Baker on the\r\nmedicinal use of nux vomica in Hindostan that, by the force of habit,\r\nthe constitution may become to a certain extent accustomed to large\r\ndoses of this poison, in the same manner as it acquires the power of\r\nenduring large doses of opium. The natives of Hindostan, often take it\r\nmorning and evening for many months continuously, beginning with an\r\neighth part of a nut, and gradually increasing the dose to an entire\r\nnut, or about twenty grains. If it is taken either immediately before or\r\nafter meals, it never occasions any unpleasant effects; but if this\r\nprecaution be neglected, spasms are apt to ensue.[2352] As it is found\r\nunsafe, however, to increase the dose beyond one nut, and the poison is\r\ntaken in the form of coarse powder, in which state it must be slowly\r\nacted on by the fluid in the stomach, it is probable that the modifying\r\ninfluence of habit is inconsiderable. Habit certainly does not\r\nfamiliarize the system to strychnia used medicinally. The same dose,\r\nwhich has once excited its peculiar physiological action, will for the\r\nmost part suffice to excite it again, however frequently the dose may be\r\nrepeated.—The facts mentioned by Mr. Baker show that nux vomica is not a\r\ncumulative poison; and European experience, in the instance of\r\nstrychnia, is to the same effect.\r\n\r\n_Morbid Appearances._—The morbid appearances differ according to the\r\nperiod at which death occurs. In Mr. Ollier’s case, where death took\r\nplace in an hour, the appearances were insignificant. The stomach was\r\nalmost natural, the vessels of the brain somewhat congested, the heart\r\nflaccid, empty, and pale. In the case in Hufeland’s Journal there was\r\ngeneral inflammation of the stomach, duodenum and part of the jejunum.\r\nIn Cloquet’s case, a slower one, there was very little appearance of\r\ninflammation. In that from the Parisian bulletins, on the contrary, the\r\nstomach was highly inflamed, the intestines violet-coloured, in many\r\nplaces easily lacerated and apparently gangrenous. In an interesting\r\ndissection of a case, which was quickly fatal,—that related by Orfila\r\nand Ollivier, there was found much serous effusion on the surface of the\r\ncerebellum, and softening of the whole cortical substance of the brain,\r\nbut especially of the cerebellum. Blumhardt too, found softening of the\r\ncerebellum and congestion of the cerebral vessels, together with\r\nsoftening of the spinal cord and general gorging of the spinal veins.\r\nThis is some confirmation of an opinion advanced not long ago in France\r\nby Flourence and others, that nux vomica acts particularly on the\r\ncerebellum.[2353] In Dr. R. D. Thomson’s case, which was examined by Mr.\r\nTaylor, there was found much congestion of the whole membranes and\r\nsubstance of the brain and cerebellum, and even some extravasation of\r\nblood within the cavity of the arachnoid over the upper surface of the\r\nformer. Mr. Watt remarked in his case (sixty hours, however, after death\r\nin summer) softening of the substance of the brain and the lumbar part\r\nof the spinal cord.—In Orfila and Ollivier’s case the lungs were found\r\nmuch gorged with black fluid blood.—In Blumhardt’s case the heart and\r\ngreat vessels were entirely destitute of blood.—There is sometimes seen,\r\nas in Dr. R. D. Thomson’s case, a brown powder lining the stomach, even\r\nalthough vomiting may have occurred.\r\n\r\nThe body appears sometimes to retain for a certain period after death\r\nthe attitude and expression impressed on it by the convulsions during\r\nlife. In the instance mentioned by Orfila and Ollivier the muscles\r\nimmediately after death remained contracted, the head bent back, the\r\narms bent, and the jaws locked. This state may even continue for some\r\nhours, so that the body appears to pass into the state of rigidity which\r\nprecedes decay, without also passing through the preliminary stage of\r\nflaccidity immediately after death. In the case related by Mr. Ollier,\r\nthe body five hours after death “was still as stiff and straight as a\r\nstatue, so that if one of the hands was moved the whole body moved along\r\nwith it;” and in Blumhardt’s case the rigidity twenty hours after death\r\nwas unusually great. This state of rigidity, however, does not\r\ninvariably occur. On the contrary, in animals the limbs become very\r\nflaccid immediately after death; but the usual rigidity supervenes at an\r\nearly period.[2354] In Dr. R. D. Thomson’s case flaccidity immediately\r\nfollowed death.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Little is known of the treatment in this kind of poisoning.\r\nBut it is of the greatest moment to evacuate the stomach thoroughly, and\r\nwithout loss of time. Hence emetics are useful; but if the stomach-pump\r\nis at hand it ought to be resorted to without waiting for the operation\r\nof emetics. Torosiewicz describes the case of a young woman who, after\r\nthe usual symptoms had begun to appear in consequence of the\r\nadministration of a tea-spoonful of powder, recovered under the action\r\nof an emetic followed by rhatany-root.[2355] When nux vomica is taken in\r\npowder,—the most frequent form in which it has been used,—it adheres\r\nwith great obstinacy to the inside of the stomach. Consequently whatever\r\nmeans are employed for evacuating the stomach, they must be continued\r\nassiduously for a considerable time. If the patient is not attacked with\r\nspasms in two hours, he will generally be safe.\r\n\r\nM. Donné of Paris has stated that he has found iodine, bromine, and\r\nchlorine to be antidotes for poisoning with the alkaloid of nux vomica,\r\nas well as for the other vegetable alkaloids. Iodine, chlorine, and\r\nbromine, he says, form with the alkaloid compounds which are not\r\ndeleterious,—two grains and a half of the iodide, bromide, and chloride\r\nof strychnia, having produced no effect on a dog. Animals which had\r\ntaken one grain of strychnia or two grains of veratria, did not sustain\r\nany harm, when tincture of iodine was administered immediately\r\nafterwards. But the delay of ten minutes in the administration of the\r\nantidote rendered it useless. In the compounds formed by these antidotes\r\nwith the alkaloids, the latter are in a state of chemical union, and not\r\ndecomposed. Sulphuric acid separates strychnia, for example, from its\r\nstate of combination with chlorine, iodine, or bromine, and forms\r\nsulphate of strychnia, with its usual poisonous qualities.[2356] It\r\nremains to be proved that the same advantages will be derived from the\r\nadministration of these antidotes in the instance of poisoning with the\r\ncrude drug, nux vomica, as in poisoning with its alkaloid.\r\n\r\nIn general little difficulty will be encountered in recognizing a case\r\nof poisoning with nux vomica. _Tetanus_ or locked-jaw is the only\r\ndisease which produces similar effects. But that disease never proves so\r\nquickly fatal as the rapid cases of poisoning with nux vomica; and it\r\nnever produces the symptoms of irritation observed in the slower cases.\r\nBesides, the fits of natural tetanus are almost always slow in being\r\nformed; while nux vomica brings on perfect fits in an hour or less. It\r\nis right to remember, however, that nux vomica may be given in small\r\ndoses, frequently repeated, and gradually increased, so as to imitate\r\nexactly the phenomena of tetanus from natural causes. Medical men will\r\nbe at no loss to discover, on reflection, how the preparations of this\r\ndrug may be rendered formidable secret poisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Of Poisoning with the St. Ignatius Bean and Upas Tieuté._\r\n\r\nThe _Strychnos Sancti Ignatii_, or St. Ignatius bean, contains about\r\nthree times as much strychnia as nux vomica, namely, from twelve to\r\neighteen parts in the 1000. It is very energetic. Dr. Hopf has mentioned\r\nan instance of a man, who was attacked with tetanus of several hours’\r\nduration after taking the powder of half a bean in brandy, and who seems\r\nto have made a narrow escape.[2357]\r\n\r\nThe _Strychnos tieuté_ is the plant which yields the Upas tieuté, one of\r\nthe Javanese poisons. This substance has been analyzed by Pelletier and\r\nCaventou, and found to contain strychnia.[2358] From the experiments of\r\nMagendie and Delille, the Upas tieuté appears to be almost as energetic\r\nas strychnia itself.[2359] Mayer found that the bark of the plant which\r\nyields it, when applied in the dose of fifty grains to a wound, killed a\r\nrabbit in two hours and a half.[2360] Dr. Darwin has given an account of\r\nits effects on the Javanese criminals, who used formerly to be executed\r\nby darts poisoned with the tieuté. The account quoted by him is not very\r\nauthentic; yet it accords precisely with what would be expected from the\r\nknown properties of the poison. He says, that a few minutes after the\r\ncriminals are wounded with the instrument of the executioner, they\r\ntremble violently, utter piercing cries, and perish amidst frightful\r\nconvulsions in ten or fifteen minutes.[2361]\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Of Poisoning with False Angustura Bark._\r\n\r\nBesides these poisons of the genus Strychnos, the present group\r\ncomprehends another, of the same properties, which was once supposed to\r\nbe derived from a plant of a different family, the _Brucea\r\nantidysenterica_.\r\n\r\nA species of bark, commonly called the false angustura bark, was\r\nintroduced by mistake into Europe instead of the true angustura,\r\ncusparia, or bark of the _Galipea officinalis_. It was long supposed to\r\nbe the bark of the _Brucea antidysenterica_; but it is now known to be\r\nthe bark of _S. nux vomica_.[2362] It is a poison of great energy. It\r\ngave rise to so many fatal accidents soon after its introduction, that\r\nin some countries on the continent all the stores of angustura were\r\nordered to be burnt. It contains a less proportion of strychnia, but\r\nmore of the alkaloid brucia than nux vomica, the seed of the plant.\r\n\r\nAccording to Andral, brucia is twenty-four times less powerful than\r\nstrychnia;[2363] but the bark itself is as strong nearly as nux-vomica,\r\nfor Orfila found that eight grains killed a dog in less than two\r\nhours.[2364]\r\n\r\nThe symptoms it induces are the same as those caused by nux vomica. They\r\nare minutely detailed in a paper by Professor Emmert of Bern.[2365] It\r\nappears that during the intervals of the fits the sensibility is\r\nremarkably acute: a boy who fell a victim to it implored his physician\r\nnot to touch him, as he was immediately thrown into a fit. Professor\r\nMarc of Paris was once violently affected by this poison, which he took\r\nby mistake for the true angustura to cure ague. He took it in the form\r\nof infusion, and the dose was only three-quarters of a liqueur-glassful;\r\nyet he was seized with nausea, pain in the stomach, a sense of fulness\r\nin the head, giddiness, ringing in the ears, and obscurity of vision,\r\nfollowed by stiffness of the limbs, great pain on every attempt at\r\nmotion, locked-jaw, and impossibility of articulating. These symptoms\r\ncontinued two hours; and abated under the use of ether and\r\nlaudanum.[2366]\r\n\r\nSome interesting experiments were made by Emmert with this poison to\r\nshow that it acts on the spine directly, and not on that organ through\r\nthe medium of the brain. If an animal be poisoned by inserting the\r\nextract of false angustura bark into its hind-legs after the spinal cord\r\nhas been severed at the loins, the hind-legs as well as the fore-legs\r\nare thrown into a state of spasm; or if the medulla oblongata be cut\r\nacross and respiration maintained artificially, the usual symptoms are\r\nproduced over the whole body by the administration of it internally or\r\nexternally,—the only material difference being that they commence more\r\nslowly, and that a larger dose is required to produce them, than when\r\nthe medulla is not injured. On the other hand, when the spinal cord is\r\nsuddenly destroyed after the symptoms have begun, they cease\r\ninstantaneously, although the circulation goes on for some\r\nminutes.[2367]\r\n\r\nThe true angustura bark has a finer texture than the other, and is\r\ndarker coloured, aromatic, pungent, and less bitter. The ferro-cyanate\r\nof potass causes in a muriatic infusion of the false bark a precipitate,\r\nwhich is first green and then becomes blue; and the same reagent\r\nconverts into blue the reddish powder which lines the bark. No such\r\neffects are produced on the true angustura bark. Nitric acid renders the\r\nrusty efflorescence of the spurious bark deep dirty blue, but has no\r\nsuch effect on the true bark; which, besides, never exhibits a yellow\r\nefflorescence.\r\n\r\nWith the preceding poisons Orfila has arranged also some poisons used by\r\nthe American Indians; but, as in Europe they are mere objects of\r\ncuriosity, it is scarcely necessary to treat of them particularly here.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting and best known of them is the _wourali poison_ of\r\nGuiana, variously called woorara, urari, or curare, by different\r\nauthors. It is believed to have been traced by Martius to a new species\r\nof strychnos, the _S. guianensis_, and more recently by Dr. Schomburg to\r\na different species, the _S. toxicaria_ of that traveller. But the\r\naction it exerts does not correspond exactly with what would be expected\r\nof a plant belonging to that genus.\r\n\r\nThe effects of wourali have been investigated by Sir B. Brodie in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions for 1811–12, in Orfila’s Toxicology, in\r\nMagendie’s Memoir on Absorption, and in Fontana’s Traité des Poisons.\r\nBut the most detailed inquiry is that by Emmert, published in 1818. It\r\nproduces, not convulsions or spasm of the muscles, but on the contrary\r\nparalysis, and probably occasions death in this way by suspending the\r\nrespiration, in the same way as hemlock and conia. According to Emmert’s\r\nexperiments the spine only is acted on, and not the brain also.[2368]\r\nSome remarkable experiments were made in 1839 by Mr. Waterton, to show\r\nthe power of artificial respiration in accomplishing recovery from its\r\neffects. After the animals had fallen down motionless from the action of\r\nthe poison introduced through a wound, and when the action of the heart\r\nhad become so feeble as not to affect the pulse, artificial respiration,\r\ncontinued in one instance for seven hours and a half, and in another for\r\ntwo hours, had the effect of restoring the animals to health.[2369]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n           OF POISONING WITH CAMPHOR, COCCULUS INDICUS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third group of the narcotico-acrids resemble strychnia in their\r\naction so far, that they occasion in large doses convulsions of the\r\ntetanic kind. But they differ considerably by producing at the same time\r\nimpaired sensibility or sopor. They are camphor, Cocculus indicus, its\r\nactive principle picrotoxin, the Coriara myrtifolia, the Upas antiar, a\r\nJava poison, and perhaps also the yew-tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Of Poisoning with Camphor._\r\n\r\nCamphor dissolved in oil soon causes in dogs paroxysms of tetanic spasm.\r\nAt first the senses are entire in the intervals; but by degrees they\r\nbecome duller, till at length a state of deep sopor is established, with\r\nnoisy laborious breathing, and expiration of camphorous fumes; and in\r\nthis state the animal soon perishes. A solution of twenty grains in\r\nolive oil will kill a dog in less than ten minutes when injected into\r\nthe jugular vein. When camphor is given to dogs in fragments, it does\r\nnot excite convulsions, but kills them more slowly by inducing\r\ninflammation of the alimentary canal. These are the results of numerous\r\nexperiments by Orfila.[2370]\r\n\r\nThey are confirmed by others performed more lately by Scudery of\r\nMessina; but this experimentalist likewise remarked, that the\r\nconvulsions were attended with a singular kind of delirium, which made\r\nthe animals run up and down without apparent cause, as if they were\r\nmaniacal. He also found the urinary organs generally affected, and for\r\nthe most part with strangury.[2371] Lebküchner discovered camphor in the\r\nblood of animals poisoned with it.[2372]\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Man._—The symptoms caused by camphor in man may not have\r\nbeen observed; but so far as they have been witnessed, they establish\r\nits claim to be considered a narcotic and acrid poison. Its effects\r\nappear to be singularly uncertain: at least they are very discrepant;\r\nand the reason for this is not apparent.\r\n\r\nIts narcotic effects are well exemplified in an account given by Mr.\r\nAlexander from personal experience, and by Dr. Edwards of Paris, as they\r\noccurred in a patient of his who received a camphor clyster.\r\n\r\nMr. Alexander, in the course of his experiments on his own person with\r\nvarious drugs, was nearly killed by this poison, and has left the best\r\naccount yet published of its effects in dangerous doses on man. After\r\nhaving found, by a previous experiment, that a scruple did not cause any\r\nparticular symptom, he swallowed in one dose two scruples mixed with\r\nsyrup of roses. In the course of twenty minutes he became languid and\r\nlistless, and in an hour giddy, confused, and forgetful. All objects\r\nquivered before his eyes, and a tumult of undigested ideas floated\r\nthrough his mind. At length he lost all consciousness, during which he\r\nwas attacked with strong convulsive fits and maniacal frenzy. These\r\nalarming symptoms were dispelled, on Dr. Monro, who had been sent for,\r\naccidentally discovering the subject of his patient’s experimental\r\nresearches, and administering an emetic. But a variety of singular\r\nmental affections continued for some time after. The emetic brought away\r\nalmost the whole camphor which had been swallowed three hours\r\nbefore.[2373]\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Edwards’s patient, the symptoms were excited by an injection\r\ncontaining half a drachm of camphor. In a few minutes he felt a\r\ncamphrous taste, which was followed by indescribable uneasiness. On then\r\ngoing down stairs for assistance, he was astonished to feel his body so\r\nlight, that he seemed to himself to skim along the floor almost without\r\ntouching it. He afterwards began to stagger, his face became pale, he\r\nfelt chilly, and was attacked with a sense of numbness in the scalp. On\r\nthen taking a glass of wine, which he asked for, he became gradually\r\nbetter; but for some time his mind was singularly affected. He felt\r\nanxious, without thinking himself in danger; he shed tears, but could\r\nnot tell why; they flowed in fact involuntarily. For twenty-four hours\r\nhis breath exhaled a camphrous odour.[2374]\r\n\r\nHoffmann has related a case analogous to those of Alexander and Edwards.\r\nThe dose was two scruples taken in oil; the symptoms vertigo,\r\nchilliness, anxiety, delirium, and somnolency.[2375]\r\n\r\nThese cases would seem to indicate very considerable activity; yet there\r\ncan be little doubt that even larger doses have been at times taken with\r\nmuch less effect. Thus, from an account given by Dr. Eickhorn of New\r\nOrleans, of its operation on himself, when incautiously swallowed to the\r\namount of two drachms in frequent small doses within three hours, it\r\nwould appear that the only result was great heat, palpitation, hurried\r\npulse, and pleasant intoxication, then moisture of the skin, next\r\nprofound sleep for some hours, attended with excessive sweating, and\r\nfinally no ultimate ill consequence except great debility.[2376] I am\r\nassured by a correspondent, Dr. Jennison of Cambridge, U. S., that a\r\nmedical friend of his has given 90 grains of camphor four times a day in\r\nphrenitis, with safety and advantage.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wendt of Breslau has related an instance, which proves the\r\nirritant action of camphor on man, and likewise the uncertainty of the\r\ndose required to act deleteriously. In the case of Mr. Alexander, two\r\nscruples would in all probability have proved fatal, had they not been\r\ndischarged in time by vomiting. In the case now to be noticed, 160\r\ngrains were taken in a state of solution in alcohol, and were not\r\nvomited; yet the individual recovered. He was a drunkard, who took four\r\nounces of camphorated spirit, prescribed for him as an embrocation. Soon\r\nafterwards he was attacked with fever, burning heat of the skin,\r\nanxiety, burning pain in the stomach, giddiness, flushed face, dimness\r\nof sight, sparks before the eyes, and some delirium. He soon got well\r\nunder the use of almond oil and vinegar, but did not vomit.[2377]\r\n\r\n_Morbid Appearances._—The morbid appearances caused by camphor have not,\r\nso far as I know, been witnessed in man. In dogs examined immediately\r\nafter death, the heart is no longer contractile, and its left cavities\r\ncontain arterial blood of a reddish-brown colour. When the poison has\r\nbeen given in fragments, it leaves marks of inflammation in the stomach\r\nand intestines. Orfila found these organs much inflamed in such\r\ncircumstances.[2378] Scudery found the membranes of the brain much\r\ninjected, and the brain itself sometimes softened; the inner membrane of\r\nthe stomach either very red, or checkered with black, gangrenous-like\r\nspots of the size of millet-seeds; the duodenum in the same state; the\r\nureters, urethra, and spermatic cords inflamed; and every organ in the\r\nbody, even the brain, impregnated with the odour of camphor.[2379]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Of Poisoning with Cocculus Indicus._\r\n\r\nThe _Menispermum cocculus_, _Cocculus suberosus_, or _Anamirta cocculus_\r\nof botanists, is a creeping plant which grows in the island of Ceylon,\r\non the Malabar coast, and in other parts of the East Indies. Its fruit,\r\nwhich is the only part of the plant hitherto particularly examined, is\r\nlike a large, rough, grayish-black pea, and is known in the shops by the\r\nname of Cocculus indicus. It has a rough, ligneous pericarp, enclosing a\r\npale grayish-yellow, brittle kernel, of a very strong lasting bitter\r\ntaste. The medical jurist should make himself well acquainted with its\r\nexternal characters, because, besides being occasionally used in\r\nmedicine, it is a familiar poison for destroying fish, and has also been\r\nextensively used by brewers as a substitute for hops,—an adulteration\r\nwhich is prohibited in Britain by severe statutes. It has been analyzed\r\nby M. Boullay of Paris,[2380] who found in it besides other matters, a\r\npeculiar principle termed picrotoxin. This principle constitutes,\r\naccording to Boullay, about a fifth part of the kernel; according to\r\nNees von Esenbeck, only a hundreth part:[2381] and my own experiments\r\nagree with the results of the latter. It is moderately soluble in water,\r\nand crystallizes readily from a hot acidulous watery solution. It is\r\nmore soluble in hot alcohol, from which it crystallizes in granular\r\nmasses. Ten grains of it killed a dog in twenty-five minutes in the\r\nsecond paroxysm of tetanus.\r\n\r\nThe seeds themselves occasion vomiting soon after they are swallowed; so\r\nthat animals may often swallow them, if not without injury, at all\r\nevents without danger. But if the gullet be tied, the animal soon begins\r\nto stagger; the eye acquires a peculiar haggard expression, which is the\r\nsure forerunner of a tetanic paroxysm; and the second, third, or fourth\r\nfit commonly proves fatal. Three or four drachms will kill a dog when\r\nintroduced into the stomach; less will suffice when it is applied to a\r\nwound; and still less when it is injected into a vein.[2382] Wepfer has\r\nrelated a good experiment, from which he infers that Cocculus indicus\r\nacts by exhausting the irritability of the heart. In the intervals of\r\nthe fits the pulse could not be felt; and on opening the chest\r\nimmediately after death, he found the heart motionless and all its\r\ncavities distended.[2383] Orfila also sometimes found the heart\r\nmotionless, and its left cavities filled with reddish-brown blood.[2384]\r\n\r\nThis poison does not seem to possess distinct acrid properties in regard\r\nto animals. M. Goupil indeed found that it produced vomiting and\r\npurging,[2385] but Orfila could not observe any such effect. According\r\nto Goupil it possesses the singular property of communicating to the\r\nflesh of animals, more particularly of fish, that have been killed with\r\nit, some of the poisonous qualities with which it is itself endowed. The\r\naccuracy of this statement may be doubted, the alleged fact being\r\ncontrary to analogy. Besides, this poison has been used immemorially in\r\nthe East for taking fish; and it is familiarly used for the same purpose\r\nin some parts of France, though prohibited by statute. Chevallier\r\nmentions that in a particular parish the inhabitants live half the year\r\non fish caught with this poison; and that a friend of his made trial of\r\nfish so caught, without the slightest injury.[2386]\r\n\r\n_Symptoms in Man._—Although it is well known that malt liquors have\r\noften been adulterated with Cocculus indicus for the purpose of\r\neconomizing hops, cases of poisoning in the human subject are rare,\r\nbecause the quantity required to communicate the due degree of\r\nbitterness is small. Professor Bernt has shortly noticed a set of cases,\r\nwhich arose in consequence of an idiot having seasoned soup with it by\r\nmistake. Nine people were taken ill with sickness, vomiting, pain in the\r\nstomach and bowels; and one died in twelve days.[2387] The symptoms\r\nunder which this person died are not stated; but the account of the\r\naccident sent to Bernt imputed death to the poison,—which is improbable,\r\nconsidering the length of the interval before death.\r\n\r\nIn the same group with camphor and Cocculus indicus Orfila has arranged\r\n_Upas antiar_, a Javanese poison. This poison is a very bitter milky\r\njuice or extract, which is known in Europe only as an article of\r\ncuriosity. It has been sometimes confounded with the Upas tieuté. It\r\nowes its properties to a neutral principle called antiarin.[2388] From\r\nthe experiments of MM. Magendie and Delille,[2389] as well as from those\r\nof Sir B. Brodie[2390] and of Emmert[2391] it appears to act in the same\r\nmanner, and to produce the same effects, as camphor and Cocculus\r\nindicus. In small doses it acts as an irritant; in large doses it causes\r\nconvulsions and coma.\r\n\r\nIt is here noticed principally because it is one of the poisons which\r\nact violently on the heart. If the body of an animal be examined\r\nimmediately after death from the Upas antiar, the heart is found to have\r\nlost its irritability, and the left ventricle to contain florid blood:\r\nSchnell found, that, like many other active poisons, it has no effect\r\nwhen applied to the divided end of a nerve.[2392]\r\n\r\nThe _Coriaria myrtifolia_ is also supposed by some to possess the\r\nproperties of the present group, and is sufficiently important from its\r\nenergy, and its occasional injurious effects on man, to claim some\r\nnotice here.\r\n\r\nIts toxicological action has been investigated by Professor Mayer of\r\nBonn, who found that it excites in most animals violent fits of tetanus,\r\ngiving place to apoplectic coma; and that in the dead body the brain is\r\nseen gorged with blood, the blood in the heart and great vessels fluid,\r\nthe heart not irritable immediately after death, and the inner membrane\r\nof the stomach yellowish and shrivelled. A drachm of the extract of the\r\njuice killed a cat in two hours when swallowed; half a drachm applied to\r\na wound killed another in eighty-five minutes; and six grains in the\r\nsame way killed a kitten in three hours and a half. A drachm swallowed\r\nby a young dog killed it in two hours and a half. Ten grains of the\r\nextract of the infusion applied to a wound killed a kitten in six hours;\r\nand three grains another in three hours. A buzzard was killed in\r\nthree-quarters of an hour by half a drachm of the extract of the juice.\r\nFrogs are also soon killed by it. Rabbits, it is remarkable, are\r\nscarcely affected by this poison, either administered internally, or\r\napplied to a wound,—a drachm in the former way, and half as much in the\r\nlatter, having produced no effect at all. A grain, however, injected\r\ninto the jugular vein occasioned in about five hours a single convulsive\r\nparoxysm, which proved immediately fatal.[2393]\r\n\r\nInstances of poisoning with this substance have occurred in the human\r\nsubject,—generally in consequence of its having been taken in various\r\nparts of the continent with senna, which it is employed to adulterate.\r\nSauvages has recorded two cases of death occasioned by the berries. In\r\none, a child, death took place within a day under symptoms like\r\nepileptic convulsions; and in the other, an adult, who swallowed only\r\nfifteen berries, convulsions, coma, and lividity of the face were\r\nproduced, ending fatally the same evening, though the greater part of\r\nthe berries were discharged by emetics.[2394] In recent French journals\r\nvarious similar cases are recorded. M. Fée describes five cases, one of\r\nthem fatal. In this instance, a male adult, death occurred within four\r\nhours after he took an infusion of senna adulterated with the coriaria;\r\nand the symptoms were violent convulsions, locked-jaw and colic.[2395]\r\nM. Roux has noticed a great number of cases in the fullest paper yet\r\npublished on its effects on man, and gives the details of three which\r\ncame under his own notice, and of which one proved fatal. In the fatal\r\ncase, that of a child three years and a half old, who took between\r\neighty and a hundred berries, the symptoms were heat and pricking of the\r\ntongue, sparking and rolling of the eyes, loss of voice, locked-jaw, and\r\nconvulsions recurring in occasional fits of eight or ten minutes in\r\nduration. Death ensued in sixteen hours and a half.[2396] Roux refers\r\nalso among other instances to those of no fewer than ten soldiers, who\r\nwere attacked at the same time in consequence of eating the berries, and\r\nof whom two died. In Roux’s fatal case there was injection of the\r\nmembranes of the brain, and no other particular appearance; in that\r\nmentioned by Fée, there was inflammation of the stomach and bowels; and\r\nin one of Sauvages’s cases no morbid appearance at all was discovered.\r\n\r\nConsidering these very pointed proofs of the poisonous qualities of the\r\ncoriaria, it is not a little singular that doubts have lately arisen\r\nwhether it is a poison at all. Peschier of Geneva says he has\r\nascertained that tanners, who use it in their trade on account of the\r\npowerful astringency of the leaves, also take it internally for gleet,\r\nand that he gave a decoction of an ounce to chickens, dogs, and men,\r\nwithout witnessing any ill effect.[2397]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Of Poisoning with Yew._\r\n\r\nThe leaves and berries of the _Taxus baccata_, or yew, are known to be\r\npoisonous; but their effects have not been investigated with care. I\r\nhave arranged it in the meantime with the present group.\r\n\r\nM. Grognier, as quoted by Orfila, ascertained that a decoction of eight\r\nounces of berries without seeds had no effect on a dog; that a pound and\r\na half of seeds had no effect on a horse; that three ounces of the juice\r\nof the leaves given to a large dog merely caused vomiting; and that a\r\ndecoction of twelve ounces of leaves, confined in the stomach of a dog\r\nby a ligature on the gullet, had also no effect. But two ounces of the\r\njuice of the leaves killed a small dog; and Orfila himself ascertained,\r\nthat thirty-six grains of extract of the leaves, injected into the\r\njugular vein, caused giddiness, stupor, and death.[2398]\r\n\r\nAccidents have repeatedly happened to children in this country from\r\nyew-berries. Mr. Hurt of Mansfield has given the particulars of an\r\ninteresting case. A child, three years and a half old, two hours after\r\neating the berries, was observed to look ill at dinner, and became\r\naffected with lividity and heaviness of the eyes, as if he was about to\r\nfall asleep. Vomiting followed, without any pain; and he died before a\r\nmedical man, who was sent for, could arrive. Four other children,\r\nsomewhat older, who had eaten the seeds, were made to vomit by emetics,\r\nand got well. The dead body of the first child presented many livid\r\nspots, redness of the villous coat of the stomach, and gorging of the\r\nbrain and membranes with blood. A mass of berries, seeds, and potatoes\r\nwas found in the stomach.[2399]—Dr. Hartmann of Frankfort mentions that\r\na girl, who took a decoction of the leaves to produce abortion, died in\r\nconsequence, but without having miscarried.[2400]—Dr. Percival has\r\nrelated other cases in his essays.[2401]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n                        OF THE POISONOUS FUNGI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fourth group of poisons possessing narcotico-acrid proper ties,\r\nincludes the poisonous _fungi_ or mushrooms.\r\n\r\nAccidents arising from the deadly fungi being mistaken for eatable\r\nmushrooms are common on the continent, and especially in France. They\r\nare not uncommon, too, in Britain; but they are less frequent than\r\nabroad, because the epicure’s catalogue of mushrooms in this country\r\ncontains only three species, whose characters are too distinct to be\r\nmistaken by a person of ordinary skill; while abroad a great variety of\r\nthem have found their way to the table, many of which are not only\r\nliable to be confounded with poisonous species, but are even also\r\nthemselves of doubtful quality.\r\n\r\nThe present subject cannot be thoroughly studied without a knowledge of\r\nthe appearance and characters of all the fungi which have been\r\nascertained to be esculent, as well as of those which are known to be\r\ndeleterious. This information, however, I cannot pretend to communicate,\r\nas it would lead to great details. In what follows, therefore, a simple\r\nlist will be given of the two classes, with references to the proper\r\nsource for minute descriptions of them, and some general observations on\r\nthe effects of the poisonous species.\r\n\r\n_List of the wholesome and poisonous Fungi._—The only good account yet\r\npublished of the innocent or eatable fungi of Great Britain is contained\r\nin an elaborate essay on the subject by Dr. Greville of this place. He\r\nenumerates no fewer than twenty-six different species, which grow\r\nabundantly in our woods and fields, and which, although most of them\r\nutterly neglected in this country, are all considered abroad to be\r\neatable, and many of them delicate. They are the following: _Tuber\r\ncibarium_, or common truffle; _T. moschatum_ and _T. album_, two species\r\nof analogous qualities; _Amanita cæsarea_ or _aurantiaca_, the Oronge of\r\nthe French, a species which is often confounded by the ignorant with a\r\nvery poisonous one, the _A. muscaria_, or _pseudo-aurantiaca_; _Agaricus\r\nprocerus_; _A. campestris_, the common mushroom of meadows; _A. edulis_,\r\nor white caps; _A. oreades_, or Scotch bonnets; _A. odorus_; _A.\r\nuburneus_; _A. ulmarius_; _A. ostreatus_; _A. violaceus_; _A.\r\ndeliciosus_; _A. piperatus_; and _A. acris_; _Boletus edulis_; and _B.\r\nscaber_; _Fistulina hepatica_; _Hydnum repandum_; _Morchella esculenta_,\r\nthe common morelle; _Helvella mitra_, and _H. leucophæa_. Of these the\r\n_Agaricus acris_, _procerus_, and _piperatus_ are probably unwholesome;\r\nand the _Amanita cæsarea_ is very rare in this country, if indeed it is\r\nindigenous at all. The _A. muscaria_, with which it is apt to be\r\nconfounded, is common enough. The species to which our cooks confine\r\ntheir attention are the _Tuber cibarium_ or truffle, the _Agaricus\r\ncampestris_, or common mushroom, and the _Morchella esculenta_, or\r\nmorelle. The _Agaricus edulis_ is also to be met with in some markets,\r\nbut is not in general use.[2402]\r\n\r\nThe best description of the poisonous species is to be found in Orfila’s\r\nToxicology. He enumerates the _Amanita muscaria_, _alba_, _citrina_, and\r\n_viridis_; the _Hypophyllum maculatum_, _albocitrinum_, _tricuspidatum_,\r\n_sanguineum_, _crux-melitense_, _pudibundum_ and _pellitum_; the\r\n_Agaricus necator_, _acris_, _piperatus_, _pyrogalus_, _stypticus_,\r\n_annularis_, and _urens_.[2403] To these may be added the _Agaricus\r\nsemiglobatus_, on the authority of Messrs. Brande and Sowerby,[2404] the\r\n_A. campanulatus_,[2405] the _A. procerus_, on the authority of a case\r\nby Dr. Peddie of this city,[2406] the _A. myomica_, on the authority of\r\nGhiglini,[2407] the _A. panterinus_ on that of Dr. Paolini of\r\nBologna,[2408] the _A. bulbosus_ of Bulliard, or _Amanita venenata_, on\r\nthat of Pouchet,[2409] the _Agaricus vernus_, _insidiosus_,\r\n_globocephalus_, _sanguineus_, _torminosus_ and _rimosus_, on that of\r\nLetellier,[2410] and the _Hypophyllum niveum_ on the authority of\r\nPaulet.\r\n\r\n_Circumstances which modify their qualities._—The qualities of the fungi\r\nas articles of food are liable to considerable variety. Some, which are\r\nin general eaten in safety, occasionally become hurtful; and some of the\r\npoisonous kinds may under certain circumstances become inert, or even\r\nesculent. But the causes which regulate these variations are not well\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought by some that most fungi become safe when they have\r\nbeen dried;[2411] and there may be some truth in this remark, as their\r\npoisonous qualities appear to depend in part on a volatile principle.\r\nBut it is by no means universally true. Foderé mentions that the\r\n_Agaricus piperatus_ continues acrid after having been dried.[2412]\r\n\r\nClimate certainly alters their properties. The _Agaricus piperatus_ is\r\neaten in Prussia and Russia;[2413] but is poisonous in France. The\r\n_Agaricus acris_ and _A. necator_, also enumerated above as meriting\r\ntheir names, are used freely in Russia.[2414] The _Amanita muscaria_ in\r\nFrance and Britain is a violent poison, and is considered so even in\r\nRussia;[2415] but in Kamschatka it yields a beverage which is used as a\r\nsubstitute for intoxicating liquors.[2416]\r\n\r\nThere is some reason to believe also that the weather or period of the\r\nseason influences some of the esculent species. Thus Foderé has\r\nmentioned instances of the common morelle having appeared injurious\r\nafter long-continued rain.[2417]\r\n\r\nEven the _Agaricus campestris_ or common mushroom is generally believed\r\nto become somewhat unsafe towards the close of the season, or as it\r\nturns old. Its external characters at that time are sensibly altered;\r\nthe margin of the cap is more acute, its white colour less lively, and\r\nthe fleshy hue of its lamellæ is changed to brown or black. In this\r\nstate, however, I have often eaten it freely and with impunity.\r\n\r\nCooking produces some difference on their effects. The very best of them\r\nare indigestible when raw; and some of the poisonous species may lose in\r\npart their deleterious qualities when cooked, because heat expels the\r\nvolatile principle; but, on the whole, I believe the effect of cooking\r\nhas not been satisfactorily shown to be considerable. Dr. Pouchet of\r\nRouen seems to have clearly proved, that the poisonous properties of two\r\nof the most deadly fungi, the _Amanita muscaria_ and _A. venenata_, may\r\nbe entirely removed by boiling them in water. A quart of water, in which\r\nfive plants had been boiled for fifteen minutes, killed a dog in eight\r\nhours, and again another in a day; but the boiled fungi themselves had\r\nno effect at all on two other dogs; and a third, which had been fed for\r\ntwo months on little else than boiled amanitas, not only sustained no\r\nharm, but actually got fat on this fare.[2418] Pouchet is inclined to\r\nthink that the whole poisonous plants of the family are similarly\r\ncircumstanced.—On the other hand some cryptogamous botanists have\r\nmaintained that the qualities of the esculent mushrooms are injured by\r\ncooking, and that when used in the raw state they may be taken for a\r\nlong time as a principal article of food without injury. This statement,\r\nas to the effect of mushrooms when used for a length of time as food,\r\nwill be more fully considered presently. It is easy to understand how\r\nboiling may remove their active properties, although other modes of\r\ncookery may not do so. Roasting had no effect in impairing the activity\r\nof _Agaricus procerus_ in the case observed by Dr. Peddie.\r\n\r\nOn certain persons all mushrooms, even the very best of the eatable\r\nkinds, act more or less injuriously. They cause vomiting, diarrhœa, and\r\ncolic. In this respect they are on the same footing with the richer\r\nsorts of fish, which by idiosyncrasy act as poisons on particular\r\nconstitutions. It is probably under this head that we must arrange an\r\nextraordinary case mentioned by Sage of a man who died soon after eating\r\na pound of truffles. He was seized with headache, a sense of weight in\r\nthe stomach, and faintness; and he lived only a few hours.[2419]\r\n\r\nLastly, it is not improbable from a singular set of cases to be related\r\npresently, that, contrary to what some botanists have alleged, the best\r\nmushrooms when taken in large quantity, and for a considerable length of\r\ntime, are deleterious to every one.\r\n\r\nFoderé,[2420] Orfila,[2421] Decandolle,[2422] and Greville,[2423] have\r\nlaid down general directions for distinguishing the esculent from the\r\npoisonous varieties; but it is extremely questionable whether their\r\nrules are always safe; and certainly they are not always accurate, as\r\nthey would exclude many species in common use on the continent. It\r\nappears that most fungi which have a warty cap, more especially\r\nfragments of membrane adhering to their upper surface, are poisonous.\r\nHeavy fungi, which have an unpleasant odour, especially if they emerge\r\nfrom a _vulva_ or bag, are also generally hurtful. Of those which grow\r\nin woods and shady places a few are esculent, but most are unwholesome;\r\nand if moist on the surface they should be avoided. All those which grow\r\nin tufts or clusters from the trunks or stumps of trees ought likewise\r\nto be shunned. A sure test of a poisonous fungus is an astringent,\r\nstyptic taste, and perhaps also a disagreeable, but certainly a pungent,\r\nodour. Some fungi possessing these properties have indeed found their\r\nway to the epicure’s table; but they are of very questionable quality.\r\nThose whose substance becomes blue soon after being cut are invariably\r\npoisonous. Agarics of an orange or rose-red colour, and boleti which are\r\ncoriaceous or corky, or which have a membranous collar round the stem,\r\nare also unsafe; but these rules are not universally applicable in other\r\ngenera. Even the esculent mushrooms, if partially devoured and abandoned\r\nby insects, are avoided by some as having in all probability acquired\r\ninjurious qualities which they do not usually possess; but this test I\r\nhave often disregarded.—These rules for knowing deleterious fungi seem\r\nto rest on fact and experience; but they will not enable the collector\r\nto recognise every poisonous species. The general rules laid down for\r\ndistinguishing wholesome fungi are not so well founded, and therefore it\r\nappears necessary to specify them.\r\n\r\n_On the Poisonous Principle of the Fungi._—Few attempts have been\r\nhitherto made to discover by chemical analysis the principles on which\r\nthe effects of the poisonous mushrooms depend. M. Braconnot analyzed a\r\nconsiderable number both of the esculent and poisonous species, and\r\nfound in some a saccharine matter, in others an acrid resin, in others\r\nan acrid volatile principle, and in all a spongy substance, which forms\r\nthe basis of them, and which he has denominated fungin.[2424] The last\r\ningredient is innocuous, and it does not appear that M. Braconnot could\r\ntrace the peculiar powers of the fungi to any of the acrid principles.\r\nThe subject was afterwards resumed by M. Letellier, who says he found in\r\nsome of them one, in others two poisonous principles. One of these is an\r\nacrid matter so fugacious, that it disappears when the plant is either\r\ndried, or boiled, or macerated in weak acids, alkalis, or alcohol. To\r\nthis principle he says are owing the irritant properties of some fungi.\r\nThe other principle is more fixed, as it resists drying, boiling, and\r\nthe action of weak alkalis and acids. It is soluble in water, has\r\nneither smell nor taste, and forms crystallizable salts with acids; but\r\nhe did not succeed in separating it in a state of purity. To this\r\nprinciple he attributes the narcotic properties of the fungi. He found\r\nit in the _Amanita bulbosa_, _muscaria_, and _verna_; and he therefore\r\nproposed to call it amanitine. Its effects on animals appear to resemble\r\nconsiderably those of opium.[2425]—Chansarel found that the poisonous\r\nprinciple resides in the juice, and not in the fleshy part after it is\r\nwell washed.[2426]\r\n\r\n_Of the Symptoms produced in Man by the Poisonous Fungi._—The mode of\r\naction of the poisonous fungi has not been particularly examined; but\r\nthe experiments of Paulet long ago established that they are poisonous\r\nto animals as well as to man.[2427]\r\n\r\nThe symptoms produced by them in man are endless in variety, and fully\r\nsubstantiate the propriety of arranging them in the class of\r\nnarcotico-acrid poisons. Sometimes they produce narcotic symptoms alone,\r\nsometimes only symptoms of irritation, but much more commonly both\r\ntogether. It is likewise not improbable, that fungi, even though not\r\nbelonging to the varieties commonly acknowledged as poisons, induce,\r\nwhen taken for a considerable length of time, a peculiar depraved state\r\nof the constitution, leading to external suppuration and gangrene. Each\r\nof these statements will now be illustrated by a few examples.\r\n\r\nThe following is a good instance of pure narcotism. A man gathered in\r\nHyde Park a considerable number of the _Agaricus campanulatus_ by\r\nmistake for the _A. campestris_, stewed them, and proceeded to eat them;\r\nbut before ending his repast, and not above ten minutes after he began\r\nit, he was suddenly attacked with dimness of vision, giddiness,\r\ndebility, trembling, and loss of recollection. In a short time he\r\nrecovered so far as to be able to go in search of assistance. But he had\r\nhardly walked 250 yards when his memory again failed him, and he lost\r\nhis way. His countenance expressed anxiety, he reeled about, and could\r\nhardly articulate. The pulse was slow and feeble. He soon became so\r\ndrowsy that he could be kept awake only by constant dragging. Vomiting\r\nwas then produced by means of sulphate of zinc; the drowsiness gradually\r\nwent off; and next day he complained merely of languor and\r\nweakness.[2428]—An equally remarkable set of cases of pure narcotism,\r\nwhich occurred a few years ago in this city, has been related by Dr.\r\nPeddie. Half an hour after eating the _Agaricus procerus_, an elderly\r\nman and a boy of thirteen were attacked with giddiness and staggering,\r\nas if they were intoxicated; and in an hour they became insensible, the\r\nman indeed so much so that for some time he could not be roused by any\r\nmeans. Emetics having little effect, the stomach was cleared out by the\r\npump, and powerful stimulants were employed both inwardly and outwardly,\r\nby means of which sensibility was in some degree restored. Occasional\r\nconvulsive spasms ensued, and afterwards furious delirium, attended with\r\nfrantic cries and vehement resistance to remedies, and followed by a\r\nstate like delirium tremens. The pupils were at first much contracted,\r\nafterwards considerably dilated as sensibility returned, and in the boy\r\ncontracted while he lay torpid, but dilated when he was roused. In\r\nneither instance was there any pain felt at any time; nor were the\r\nbowels affected. Another boy who took a small quantity only had no other\r\nsymptom but giddiness, drowsiness, and debility.[2429]—A singular form\r\nof the narcotic effects of the fungi occurred in the case of a boy of\r\nfourteen, who had eaten the _Agaricus panterinus_ near Bologna. In the\r\ncourse of two hours he was seized with delirium, a maniacal disposition\r\nto rove, and some convulsive movements. Ere long these symptoms were\r\nsucceeded by a state resembling coma in every way, except that he looked\r\nas if he understood what was going on: and in point of fact really did\r\nso. He recovered speedily under the use of emetics.[2430]\r\n\r\nIn the next set of cases the symptoms were those of almost pure\r\nirritation. Several French soldiers in Russia ate a large quantity of\r\nthe _Amanita muscaria_, which they had mistaken for the _Amanita\r\ncæsarea_. Some were not taken ill for six hours and upwards. Four of\r\nthem, who were very powerful men, thought themselves safe, because while\r\ntheir companions were already suffering, they themselves felt perfectly\r\nwell; and they refused to take emetics. In the evening, however, they\r\nbegan to complain of anxiety, a sense of suffocation, frequent fainting,\r\nburning thirst, and violent gripes. The pulse became small and\r\nirregular, and the body bedewed with cold sweat; the lineaments of the\r\ncountenance were singularly changed, the nose and lips acquiring a\r\nviolet tint; they trembled much; the belly swelled, and a profuse fetid\r\ndiarrhœa supervened. The extremities soon became livid, and the pain of\r\nthe abdomen intense; delirium ensued; and all four died.[2431]\r\n\r\nSuch cases, however, do not appear to be very common; and much more\r\ngenerally the symptoms of poisoning with the fungi present a well-marked\r\nconjunction of deep narcotism and violent irritation, as the instances\r\nnow to be mentioned will show.\r\n\r\nBesides the four soldiers whose cases have just been described, several\r\nof their comrades were severely affected, but recovered. Two of these\r\nhad weak pulse, tense and painful belly, partial cold sweats, fetid\r\nbreath and stools. In the afternoon they became delirious, then\r\ncomatose, and the coma lasted twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nA man, his wife, and three children, ate to dinner carp stewed by\r\nmistake with the _Amanita citrina_. The wife, the servant, and one of\r\nthe children had vomiting, followed by deep sopor; but they recovered.\r\nThe husband had true and violent cholera, but recovered also. The two\r\nother children became profoundly lethargic and comatose, emetics had no\r\neffect, and death soon ensued without any other remarkable symptom. The\r\nindividuals who recovered were not completely well till three weeks\r\nafter the fatal repast.[2432] This set of cases shows the tendency of\r\nthe poisonous fungi to cause in one person pure irritation, and in\r\nanother pure narcotism.\r\n\r\nThe last set of cases to be mentioned were produced by the _Hypophyllum\r\nsanguineum_, a small conical fungus of a mouse colour, well known to\r\nchildren in Scotland by the name of _puddock-stool_. This species seems\r\nto cause convulsions as well as sopor. A family of six persons, four of\r\nwhom were children, ate about two pounds of it dressed with butter. The\r\nincipient symptoms were pain in the pit of the stomach, a sense of\r\nimpending suffocation, and violent efforts to vomit; which symptoms did\r\nnot commence in any of them till about twelve hours after the poisonous\r\nmeal, in one not till twenty hours, and in another not till nearly\r\nthirty hours. One of the children, seven years of age, had acute pain of\r\nthe belly, which soon swelled enormously; afterwards he fell into a\r\nstate of lethargic sleep, but continued to cry; about twenty-four hours\r\nafter eating the fungi the limbs became affected with permanent spasms\r\nand convulsive fits; and in no long time he expired in a tetanic\r\nparoxysm. Another of the children, ten years old, perished nearly in the\r\nsame manner, but with convulsions of greater violence. The mother had\r\nfrequent bloody stools and vomiting; the skin became yellow; the muscles\r\nof the abdomen were contracted spasmodically, so that the navel was\r\ndrawn towards the spine; profound lethargy and general coldness\r\nsupervened; and she too died about thirty-six hours after eating the\r\nfungus. A third child, after slight symptoms of amendment had shown\r\nthemselves, became worse again, and died on the third day with\r\ntrembling, delirium, and convulsions. This patient, who had taken very\r\nlittle of the poison, was not attacked till about thirty hours after the\r\nmeal. The fourth child, after precursory symptoms like those of the\r\nrest, became delirious, and had an attack of colic and inflammation of\r\nthe bowels, without diarrhœa; but he eventually recovered. The father\r\nhad a severe attack of dysentery for three days, and remained five days\r\nspeechless. For a long time afterwards he had occasional bloody\r\ndiarrhœa; and, although he eventually recovered, his health continued to\r\nsuffer for an entire year.[2433] The cases now mentioned illustrate\r\nclearly the simultaneous occurrence of narcotic and irritant symptoms in\r\nthe same individuals.\r\n\r\nA striking circumstance in respect to the symptoms of poisoning with the\r\nfungi, is the great difference in the interval which elapses before they\r\nbegin. In the first case the symptoms appear to have commenced in a few\r\nminutes; but, on the contrary, an interval of twelve hours is common;\r\nand Gmelin has quoted a set of cases, seventeen in number, in which, as\r\nin one of those related by Picco, the interval is said to have been a\r\nday and a half.[2434] The tardiness of the approach of the symptoms is\r\nowing to the indigestibility of most of the fungi. Their indigestibility\r\nis in fact so great, that portions of them have been discharged by\r\nvomiting so late as fifty-two hours after they were swallowed.[2435]\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance, worthy of particular notice, is the great\r\ndurability of the symptoms. Even the purely narcotic effects of some\r\nfungi have been known to last above two days. In the instance just\r\nalluded to, the vomiting of the poison was the first thing that\r\ninterrupted a state of deep lethargy, which had prevailed for fifty-two\r\nhours. The symptoms of irritation, after their violence has been\r\nmitigated, might continue, as in the instance quoted from Orfila, for\r\nabout three weeks.\r\n\r\nIt was stated above, that some people are apt to suffer unpleasant\r\neffects from eating even the best and safest of the esculent mushrooms.\r\nThese effects, which depend on idiosyncrasy, are confined chiefly to an\r\nattack of vomiting and purging, followed by more or less indigestion.\r\nSome persons have been similarly affected, even by the small portion of\r\nmushroom-juice which is contained in an ordinary ketchup seasoning. This\r\naccident, however, may very well be often unconnected with idiosyncrasy;\r\nas I have seen those who gather mushrooms near Edinburgh, for the\r\npurpose of making ketchup, picking up every fungus that came in their\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThere is some reason for suspecting that even the best mushrooms, when\r\ntaken as a principal article of food for a considerable length of time,\r\nwill prove injurious, and that they then induce a peculiar depraved\r\nhabit, which leads to external suppuration and gangrene. The only cases\r\nwhich have hitherto appeared in support of this statement, were lately\r\npublished in Rust’s Journal. A family, consisting of the mother and four\r\nchildren, were seized with a kind of tertian fever, and the formation of\r\nabscesses, which discharged a thin, ill-conditioned pus, passed rapidly\r\ninto spreading gangrene, and proved fatal to the mother and one of the\r\nchildren. No other cause could be discovered to account for so\r\nextraordinary a conjunction of symptoms in so many individuals, except\r\nthat for two months they had lived almost entirely on mushrooms; and the\r\nprobability of this being really the cause, was strengthened by the\r\nfact, that the father who slept always with his family, and who alone\r\nescaped, lived on ordinary food at a place where he worked not far\r\noff.[2436] In opposition, however, to the natural inference from this\r\nnarrative, some have believed, that mushrooms may be safely eaten to a\r\nlarge amount and for a long time, provided they be used raw. A botanist\r\nof Persoon’s acquaintance, while studying the cryptogamous plants in the\r\nvicinity of Nuremberg, says he found that the peasants ate them in large\r\nquantities as their daily food; and, in imitation of their custom, he\r\nate for several weeks nothing but bread and raw mushrooms; yet at the\r\nend he experienced an increase rather than a diminution of strength, and\r\nenjoyed perfect health. He adds that they lose their good qualities by\r\ncooking; but he has supplied no facts in support of that\r\nstatement.[2437] It is said that eatable fungi, used for a considerable\r\ntime as a principal article of food, as in Russia, cause greenness of\r\nthe skin.[2438] There is no reason for supposing, as some have\r\ndone,[2439] that wholesome mushrooms may produce the effects of the\r\npoisonous kinds, if eaten in large quantity.\r\n\r\n_Of the Morbid Appearances._—The morbid appearances left in the bodies\r\nof persons poisoned by this deleterious fungi have been but imperfectly\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nThe body is in general very livid, and the blood fluid; so much so\r\nsometimes, that it flows from the natural openings in the dead\r\nbody.[2440] In general, the abdomen is distended with fetid air, which,\r\nindeed, is usually present during life. The stomach and small intestines\r\nof the four French soldiers (p. 705), presented the appearance of\r\ninflammation passing in some places to gangrene. In two of them\r\nespecially, the stomach was gangrenous in many places, and far advanced\r\nin putrefaction. The same appearances were found in Picco’s cases. In\r\nthese there was also an excessive enlargement of the liver. The lungs\r\nhave sometimes been found gorged or even inflamed. The vessels of the\r\nbrain are also sometimes very turgid. They were particularly so in a\r\ncase related by Dr. Beck, where death was occasioned in seven hours by\r\nan infusion of the _Amanita muscaria_ in milk. The whole sinuses of the\r\ndura mater, as well as the arteries were enormously distended with\r\nblood; the arachnoid and pia mater were of a scarlet colour; the vessels\r\nof the membrane between the convolutions, together with the plexus\r\nchoroides, were also excessively gorged; and the substance of the brain\r\nwas red. Lastly, a clot of blood, as big as a bean, was found in the\r\ncerebellum.[2441]—The stomach, unless there had been vomiting or\r\ndiarrhœa, will usually contain fragments of the poison, if it has not\r\nbeen taken in a state of minute division; and this evidence of the cause\r\nof death may be obtained, even although the individual survived two days\r\nor upwards. Sometimes fragments are found in the intestines. In one of\r\nPicco’s patients who lived twenty-four hours, there was found in the\r\nneighbourhood of the ileo-cæcal valve, which was much inflamed.[2442]\r\n\r\n_Of the Treatment._—The treatment of poisoning with the fungi does not\r\ncall for any special observations. Emetics are of primary importance;\r\nand after the poison has been by their means dislodged, the sopor and\r\ninflammation of the bowels are to be treated in the usual way. No\r\nantidote is known. Several have at different times been a good deal\r\nconfided in; but none are of any material service. Chansarel found acids\r\nuseless, but thought infusion of galls advantageous.[2443]\r\n\r\nIn concluding the present chapter it is necessary to take notice of a\r\nvariety of poisoning, not altogether unimportant in a medico-legal point\r\nof view. A person may seem to die of poisoning with the deleterious\r\nfungi, from eating esculent mushrooms intentionally drugged with some\r\nother vegetable or mineral poison. It must be confessed, that if the\r\nmurderer is dexterous in the choice and mode of administering the\r\npoison, such cases might readily escape suspicion, and even when\r\nsuspected might not be cleared up without difficulty. The ascertaining\r\nthe species of mushroom, by finding others where it has been gathered,\r\nwill not supply more than presumptive proof of the wholesomeness of that\r\nwhich has been eaten; because the esculent and poisonous species\r\nsometimes grow near one another, and have a mutual resemblance, so that\r\na mistake may easily occur. The presumption may be somewhat strengthened\r\nby evidence derived from the interval which elapses before the symptoms\r\nbegin, from the nature and progress of the symptoms themselves, and from\r\nthe morbid appearances. Some one or other of these circumstances may\r\nestablish the fact of poisoning with a deleterious fungi. It is\r\nimpossible, however, that they shall ever establish satisfactorily that\r\nthe fungus was naturally wholesome; and, on the whole, the only decided\r\nevidence of poisoning by some other means will be the actual discovery\r\nof another poison.\r\n\r\nThe case now under consideration is not a mere hypothetical one. Ernest\r\nPlatner has related a very interesting example, which proves how easily\r\npoisoning of the kind supposed may be accomplished without suspicion. A\r\nservant-girl poisoned her mistress by mixing oxide of arsenic with a\r\ndish of mushrooms. She died in twenty hours, after suffering severely\r\nfrom vomiting and colic pains. On dissection there were found\r\ninflammation of the stomach, gangrenous spots in it, clots of blood in\r\nits contents, and redness of the intestines. Her death, however, was\r\nascribed to the mushrooms having been unwholesome; and the real cause\r\nwas not discovered till thirteen years after, when the girl was\r\nconvicted of murdering a fellow-servant in a somewhat similar way by\r\nmixing arsenic with her chocolate, and then confessed both crimes.[2444]\r\n\r\n_Poisonous Mosses._—It is not improbable that some of the mosses possess\r\npoisonous properties similar to those of the deleterious fungi. Dr.\r\nWinkler of Innsbruch mentions that the _Lycopodium selago_ is used in\r\nthe Tyrol in the way of infusion for killing vermin on animals; and that\r\nunpleasant accidents have been produced in man by its accidental use.\r\nIts effects appear to be sometimes irritant, but more generally narcotic\r\nin their nature.[2445]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XL.\r\n              OF THE EFFECTS OF POISONOUS GRAIN AND PULSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe different sorts of grain are subject to certain diseases, in\r\nconsequence of which meal or flour made from them is apt to be\r\nimpregnated with substances more or less injurious to animal life. It is\r\nlikewise believed, that unripe grain possesses properties which render\r\nit to a certain extent unfit for the food of man.\r\n\r\nIt is for the most part difficult to trace satisfactorily the operation\r\nof the poisons now alluded to, because they are seen acting only in\r\ntimes of famine and general distress, when it is not always easy to make\r\ndue allowance for the effect of collateral circumstances. There is one\r\npoison of the kind, however, whose baneful influence has been so\r\nfrequently and unequivocally witnessed, that no doubt now exists\r\nregarding its properties, I mean _spurred rye_, or _ergot_. It is a\r\npoison of no great consequence, perhaps, to the English toxicologist;\r\nfor indeed I am not aware that a single instance of its operation has\r\nhitherto been observed in Britain.[2446] But its effects are so\r\nsingular, and the ravages it has often committed on the continent have\r\nbeen so dreadful, that a short account of it cannot fail to interest\r\neven the English reader. Besides, it has lately been introduced into the\r\nmateria medica, as possessing very extraordinary medicinal qualities;\r\nand since its use is gaining ground, every medical jurist ought to be\r\nconversant with its properties as a poison. I have also met with an\r\ninstance where it was administered for the purpose of procuring\r\nmiscarriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Of Poisoning with Spurred Rye._\r\n\r\n_Spurred Rye_, or _Secale cornutum_, the _Seigle ergoté_, or _Ergot_ of\r\nthe French, and _Mutterkorn_, or _Roggenmutter_, of the Germans, is a\r\ndisease common to various grains, in consequence of which the place of\r\nthe pickle is supplied by a long, black substance, like a little horn or\r\nspur. It has been known to attack many plants of the order\r\nGraminaceæ;[2447] and among those used as food by man, it has been\r\nobserved on barley, oats, spring-wheat, winter-wheat, and rye. But the\r\nrye seems peculiarly subject to it, almost all the poison which has\r\ncaused epidemics, as well as what is now used in medicine, being\r\nproduced by that grain.\r\n\r\n_Of the Cause and Nature of the Spur in Rye._—The spur attacks rye\r\nchiefly in damp seasons, and in moist clay soils, particularly those\r\nrecently redeemed from waste lands in the neighbourhood of forests. Of\r\nall the places where the spur has been hitherto observed none combines\r\nthese conditions so perfectly, and none has been so much infested with\r\nthe disease, as the district of Sologne, situated between the rivers\r\nLoire and Cher, in France. According to the statistical researches of\r\nthe _Abbé Tessier_, who in 1777 was deputed by the Parisian Society of\r\nMedicine to investigate the causes of the extraordinary prevalence of\r\nthe ergot in that district, the country was then so much intersected by\r\nbelts of wood around the fields, that the traveller in passing along\r\nmight imagine he was constantly approaching an immense forest; the\r\narable land was so poor, that, although it lay fallow every third\r\nseason, it was exhausted in nine or twelve years at farthest, and then\r\nremained a long time in pasture before it could again bear white crops;\r\nthe surface was so level, and consequently so wet, that crops were\r\nobtained only when the seed was sown on the tops of furrows a foot high;\r\nand the climate is so moist, that from the month of September till late\r\nin spring the whole country is overhung by dense fogs.[2448] Here the\r\nrye, the common food of the peasantry, appears to have been in Tessier’s\r\ntime more liable to be attacked by the spur than in any other part of\r\nthe continent. Tessier found, that after being thrashed it contained on\r\nan average about a forty-eighth part of ergot, even in good seasons; but\r\nin bad seasons, and taking into account a considerable proportion which\r\nis shaken out of the ears and sheaves before they reach the barn, the\r\nproportion of ergot in the whole crop has been estimated so high as a\r\nfourth or even a third. In Sologne the disease was farther observed by\r\nTessier to be always most prevalent in the dampest parts of a field, and\r\nto affect above all the first crop of fields redeemed from waste land,\r\nor from land which had previously been for some time in pasture.[2449]\r\nThe same connexion between moisture and the development of the ergot has\r\nbeen repeatedly traced in other parts of France, as well as in\r\nGermany.[2450] And according to the experiments of Wildenow, it may be\r\nbrought on at any time, by sowing the rye in a rich damp soil, and\r\nwatering the plants exuberantly in warm weather.[2451]\r\n\r\nOpinions are much divided as to the cause and nature of the spur. It had\r\nbeen conceived by some that nothing else is required for its production\r\nbut undue moisture combined with warmth; and that under these\r\ncircumstances the spur is formed simply by a diseased process from the\r\njuices of the plant.[2452] By others, such as Tillet, Fontana, and Réad,\r\nwho also consider it to be simply a diseased formation, it has been held\r\nto arise from the germen being punctured when young by an insect;[2453]\r\nand in support of this statement, General Field says he saw flies\r\npuncture the glumes in their milky state where spurs afterwards formed,\r\nand imitating the operation with a needle obtained the same\r\nresult.[2454] On the other hand, Decandolle, reviving a previous\r\ndoctrine that the spur is a kind of fungus, conceived he had given\r\nstrong grounds for believing this excrescence to be a species of\r\n_sclerotium_, which he terms _S. clavus_. Wiggers supports this doctrine\r\nby chemical analysis; for he endeavours to show that the basis of the\r\nstructure of the spur is almost identical in chemical properties with\r\nthe principle fungin.[2455] Lastly, the most recent researches, those of\r\nSmith,[2456] Queckett,[2457] and Bauer,[2458] founded chiefly on\r\nmicroscopical observations, tend to a union and modification of these\r\ntwo views,—namely, that the great mass of the spur is a peculiar morbid\r\nformation, and that the whitish bloom which covers fresh specimens\r\nconsists of a multitude of microscopic fungi in the form of _sporidia_,\r\nwhich thickly envelope and impregnate the parts of fructification in the\r\nnascent state of the embryo, and are in all probability the exciting\r\ncause of the morbid degeneration of the pickle.[2459]\r\n\r\nVarious opinions have been formed as to the mode of propagation of the\r\nspur. Fontana has alleged that one variety of it may spread from plant\r\nto plant over a field; and that he has expressly transmitted it by\r\ncontact from one ear to another.[2460] His opinion and statement of\r\nfacts are at variance with experiments lately made by Hertwig, a German\r\nphysician, who found that even when the ear while in flower was\r\nsurrounded for twelve days with powder of spurred rye, the healthiness\r\nof the future grain was not in the slightest degree affected.[2461] The\r\nsame results have also been obtained by Wiggers, and more recently by\r\nDr. Samuel Wright.[2462] Wiggers, however, although he could not produce\r\nspurs in the way indicated by Fontana, observed that the white dust on\r\nthe surface of the spurs will produce the disease in any plant, if\r\nsprinkled in the soil at its roots, appearing therefore to be analogous\r\nto the sporules or spawn of the admitted fungi. Mr. Queckett has made\r\nthe most precise experiments on the mode of reproduction of the disease.\r\nHe succeeded in infecting rye repeatedly with ergot by means of the\r\nsporidia developed on the spurs; but it is remarkable that he could not\r\nin the same way infect wheat or barley.[2463]\r\n\r\n_Description and analysis of Spurred Rye._—The spur varies in length\r\nfrom a few lines to two inches, and is from two to four lines in\r\nthickness. If it is long, there is seldom more than one or two on a\r\nsingle ear, and the remaining pickles of the ear are healthy. But the\r\nears which have small spurs have generally several, sometimes even\r\ntwenty; and when there are many, few of the remaining pickles are\r\naltogether without blackness at the tips.[2464] The substance of the\r\nspur is of a pale grayish-red tint; and externally it is bluish-black or\r\nviolet, with two, sometimes three, streaks of dotted gray. It is\r\nspecifically lighter than water, while sound rye is specifically\r\nheavier, so that they are easily separated from one another.[2465] It is\r\ntough and flexible when fresh, brittle and easily pulverized when dry.\r\nThe powder is disposed to attract moisture. It has a disagreeable heavy\r\nsmell, a nauseous, slightly acrid taste, and imparts its taste and smell\r\nboth to water and alcohol. Bread which contains it is defective in\r\nfirmness, liable to become moist, and cracks and crumbles soon after\r\nbeing taken from the oven.[2466]—It is easily known, when entire, by its\r\nexternal characters. Its powder, which is of an obscure grayish-red hue,\r\nis best known by the action of solution of potash, which immediately\r\ndisengages a powerful odour of ergot, and forms a lake-red pulp; and\r\nthis pulp yields by filtration a splendid lake-red solution, which gives\r\na beautiful lake-red flaky precipitate, when either neutralized by\r\nnitric acid, or treated with an excess of solution of alum.\r\n\r\nSpurred rye has been repeatedly subjected to analysis. The earlier\r\nresearches of Vauquelin[2467] and of Pettenkofer[2468] do not lead to\r\nany pointed results. The presence of hydrocyanic acid indicated by\r\nRobert,[2469] would not account for the very peculiar effects of ergot,\r\nand has besides been denied by Wiggers. Winkler obtained various\r\nprinciples from it, and among the rest a thick, rancid, slightly acrid\r\noil, and a nauseous, sweetish, acrid fluid; but he did not determine,\r\nany more than his predecessors, in which of these principles the active\r\nproperties of the spur reside.[2470] Wiggers supplied more definite\r\ninformation on the subject. He denies the presence of hydrocyanic acid,\r\nand says he found ergot to consist chiefly of a heavy-smelling fixed\r\noil, fungin, albumen, osmazome, waxy matter, and an extractive substance\r\nof a strong, peculiar taste and smell, in which, from experiments on\r\nanimals, he was led to infer that its active properties reside. I have\r\nobtained all his chief results, except the most important of them; for\r\nthe substance which ought to have been his ergotin was destitute of\r\nmarked taste or smell of any kind.[2471] Dr. Wright too could not obtain\r\nthe ergotin of Wiggers, and concludes from his own experiments, that the\r\nspur consists of fungin, modified starch, mucilage, gluten, osmazome,\r\ncolouring matter, various salts, and thirty-one per cent. of fixed oil,\r\nin which the active properties of the poison seemed to him to\r\nreside.[2472] Buchner, however, thinks that the oil is not itself\r\nactive, but owes its apparent energy to an acrid principle which alcohol\r\nremoves from it, and which is not removed from the crude substance in\r\nseparating the oil in the usual way by sulphuric ether, unless the ether\r\nbe somewhat alcoholized.[2473] However this may be, it seems ascertained\r\nby the experiments of Dr. Wright, that the fixed oil, obtained by means\r\nof common ether, concentrates in itself the peculiar properties\r\npossessed by ergot, either in small doses as a medicine, or in a single\r\nlarge dose as a poison.\r\n\r\n_Effects of Spurred Rye on Man and Animals._—Before proceeding to relate\r\nthe effects of this poison on man, it should be mentioned, that at\r\ndifferent times doubts have been entertained, whether the baneful\r\neffects ascribed to it might not really arise from some other cause. But\r\nindependently of the connexion which has been frequently traced between\r\nthe poison and the diseases imputed to it in the human subject, the\r\nquestion has been set at rest by the experiments which have been tried\r\non animals, and which indeed were instituted with a view to settle the\r\npoint in dispute.\r\n\r\nThe experiments hitherto made on animals are variable in their results,\r\nyet sufficient to show that spurred rye is an active poison of a very\r\npeculiar kind. According to the observations collected by Dr. Robert\r\nfrom a variety of authors, it follows that it is injurious and even\r\nfatal to all animals which are fed for a sufficient length of time with\r\na moderate proportion of it, unless they escape its action by early\r\nvomiting; that dogs and cats, in consequence of discharging it by\r\nvomiting, suffer only slight symptoms of irritant poisoning;—but that\r\nswine, moles, geese, ducks, fowls, quails, sparrows, as well as leeches\r\nand flies, are sooner or later killed by it;—and that the symptoms it\r\ncauses in beasts and birds are in the first instance giddiness, dilated\r\npupil, and palsy, and afterwards diarrhœa, suppurating tumours,\r\nscattered gangrene throughout the body, and sometimes dropping off of\r\nthe toes. Wiggers ascertained that nine grains of the substance he has\r\nconsidered its active principle occasioned in a fowl dulness, apparent\r\nsuffering, gradually increasing feebleness, coldness and insensibility\r\nof the extremities, and in three days a fit of convulsions, ending in\r\ndeath.[2474] Taddei lately found, that sparrows were killed by six\r\ngrains of it in six or seven hours, with symptoms merely of great\r\nweakness, torpor, and indisposition to stir.[2475]\r\n\r\nDr. Wright, whose experiments are the most extensive and precise yet\r\nmade on this subject, found that a single dose, consisting of a strong\r\ninfusion of between two drachms and a half and six drachms of ergot, if\r\nintroduced into the jugular vein of a dog, occasions death, sometimes in\r\na few minutes, sometimes not for more than two hours, with symptoms of\r\nalternating spasm and paralysis, occasionally a tendency to coma, and\r\noften depressed or irregular action of the heart, or even complete\r\narrestment of its function;—that, when introduced into the cellular\r\ntissue, it produces inflammation and suppuration, sometimes\r\ncircumscribed, sometimes diffuse, and always attended with an unhealthy\r\ndischarge and great exhaustion;—and that, when admitted into the\r\nstomach, it excites irritation of the alimentary canal, excessive\r\nmuscular prostration, at first excitability, but afterwards singular\r\ndulness or even complete obliteration of the senses, and occasional\r\nslight spasms; but that it is not a very active poison through this\r\nchannel, as above three ounces are required to prove fatal to a dog.\r\nWhen it was administered in frequent small doses, he could not observe\r\nthe effects remarked by Robert, but found that it induced a peculiar\r\ncachectic state, indicated by extreme muscular emaciation and weakness,\r\nloss of appetite, frequency of the pulse, repulsive fetor of the\r\nsecretions and excretions, congestion of the alimentary mucous membrane,\r\nexcessive contraction of the spleen, enlargement of the liver and\r\nabsorbent glands, and non-formation of callus at the ends of fractured\r\nbones.[2476]\r\n\r\nWith regard to its effects on man, it has been found by express\r\nexperiment, that a single dose of two drachms excites giddiness,\r\nheadache, flushed face, pain and spasms in the stomach, nausea, and\r\nvomiting, colic, purging, and a sense of weariness and weight in the\r\nlimbs.[2477] But it is not in this way that it has been usually\r\nintroduced into the system; nor are these precisely the symptoms already\r\nhinted at as particular in its action. The effects now to be mentioned\r\nform a peculiar disease, which has often prevailed epidemically in\r\ndifferent territories on the continent, and which arises from the spur\r\nbeing allowed to mix with the grain in the meal, and being taken as food\r\nfor a continuance of time in rye-bread. The affection produced differs\r\nmuch in different epidemics and even in different cases of the same\r\nepidemic. Two distinct disorders have been noticed; the one a nervous\r\ndisease, characterized by violent spasmodic convulsions; the other a\r\ndepraved state of the constitution, which ends in that remarkable\r\ndisorder, dry gangrene; and it does not appear that the two affections\r\nare apt to be blended together in the same case.\r\n\r\nThe first form of disease, the _convulsive ergotism_ of the French\r\nwriters, has been very well described by Taube, a German physician, as\r\nit occurred in the north of Germany in 1770–1. In its most acute form,\r\nit commenced suddenly with dimness of sight, giddiness and loss of\r\nsensibility, followed soon by dreadful cramps and convulsions of the\r\nwhole body, _risus sardonicus_, yellowness of the countenance, excessive\r\nthirst, excruciating pains in the limbs and chest, and a small, often\r\nimperceptible pulse. Such cases usually proved fatal in twenty-four or\r\nforty-eight hours. In the milder cases the convulsions came on in\r\nparoxysms, were preceded for some days by weakness and weight of the\r\nlimbs, and a strange feeling as of insects crawling over the legs, arms,\r\nand face; in the intervals between the fits the appetite was voracious,\r\nthe pulse natural, the excretions regular; and the disease either\r\nterminated in recovery, with scattered suppurations, cutaneous\r\neruptions, anasarca or diarrhœa, or it proved in the end fatal amidst\r\nprolonged sopor and convulsions.[2478] Another more recent and very\r\nclear account of this form of the disease has been given by Dr. Wagner\r\nof Schlieben from his experience of an epidemic which prevailed in the\r\nneighbourhood of that place so lately as the years 1831 and 1832. In\r\nconsequence of unusual moisture and late frosts in the summer of 1831,\r\nthe rye was so much spurred in many fields that a fifth at least of the\r\npickles was diseased. As soon as the country people proceeded to use the\r\nnew rye, convulsive ergotism began to show itself, and it recurred more\r\nor less till next midsummer, when the diseased grain was all consumed.\r\nThe usual symptoms were at first periodic weariness, afterwards an\r\nuneasy sense of contraction in the hands and feet, and at length violent\r\nand permanent contraction of the flexor muscles of the arms, legs, feet,\r\nhands, fingers and toes, with frequent attacks of a sense of burning or\r\ncreeping on the skin. These were the essential symptoms; but a great\r\nvariety of accessory nervous affections occasionally presented\r\nthemselves. There was seldom any disturbance of the mind, except in some\r\nof the fatal cases, where epileptic convulsions and coma preceded death.\r\nEvery case was cured by emetics, laxatives, and frequent small doses of\r\nopium, provided it was taken in reasonable time, and the unwholesome\r\nfood was completely withdrawn.[2479]\r\n\r\nThe other form of disease, which has been named _gangrenous ergotism_,\r\nby the French writers, and is known in Germany by the vulgar name of\r\ncreeping-sickness (_kriebelkrankheit_), has been minutely described by\r\nvarious authors. In the most severe form, as it appeared in Switzerland\r\nin 1709 and 1716, it commenced, according to Lang, a physician of\r\nLucerne, with general weakness, weariness, and a feeling as of insects\r\ncreeping over the skin; when these symptoms had lasted some days or\r\nweeks, the extremities became cold, white, stiff, benumbed, and at\r\nlength so insensible that deep incisions were not felt; then\r\nexcruciating pains in the limbs supervened, along with fever, headache,\r\nand sometimes bleeding from the nose; finally the affected parts, and in\r\nthe first instance the fingers and arms, afterwards the toes and legs,\r\nshrivelled, dried up, and dropped off by the joints. A healthy\r\ngranulation succeeded; but the powers of life were frequently exhausted\r\nbefore that stage was reached. The appetite, as in the convulsive form\r\nof the disease, continued voracious throughout.[2480] In milder cases,\r\nas it prevailed at different times in France, nausea and vomiting\r\nattended the precursory symptoms, and the gangrenous affection was\r\naccompanied with dark vesications.[2481] In another variety, which has\r\nbeen witnessed in various parts of Germany, the chief symptoms were\r\nspasmodic contraction of the limbs at first, and afterwards weakness of\r\nmind, voracity and dyspepsia, which, if not followed by recovery, as\r\ngenerally happened, either terminated in fatuity or in fatal\r\ngangrene.[2482]\r\n\r\nThese extraordinary and formidable distempers were first referred to the\r\noperation of spurred rye in 1597 by the Marburg Medical Faculty, who\r\nwitnessed the ravages of the poison in Hessia during the preceding year.\r\nSince then repeated epidemics have broken out in Germany, Bohemia,\r\nHolstein, Denmark, Sweden, Lombardy, Switzerland, and France.[2483]\r\nAbout the close of last century, partly in consequence of the attention\r\nof the respective governments being turned to the subject, partly by\r\nreason of the improved condition of the peasantry in these countries,\r\nand the greater rarity of seasons of famine, the epidemics became much\r\nless common or extensive. Nevertheless the creeping-sickness has been\r\nseveral times noticed in Germany since the present century began.[2484]\r\n\r\nSpurred rye is now generally believed to possess another singular\r\nquality, in consequence of which it has been lately introduced into the\r\nmateria medica of this and other countries,—a power of promoting the\r\ncontractions of the gravid uterus. This property seems to have been long\r\nfamiliar to the quacks and midwives of Germany; and towards the close of\r\nlast century it rendered ergot so favourite a remedy with them, that\r\nseveral of the German states prohibited the use of it by severe\r\nstatutes.[2485] It was first fairly brought under the notice of regular\r\naccoucheurs by the physicians of the United States between the years\r\n1807 and 1814.[2486] There appears little reason for doubting that it\r\npossesses the power of increasing the contractions of the uterus when\r\nunnaturally languid; and consequently it has been employed, apparently\r\nwith frequent good effect, to hasten languid natural labour, to promote\r\nthe separation of the placenta, and to quicken the contraction of the\r\nwomb after delivery. These facts, however, are mentioned chiefly as\r\npreparatory to the statement, that it has been also supposed to possess\r\nthe power of producing abortion, and has been actually employed for that\r\npurpose in some foreign countries, and even in this city. Accurate\r\ninformation is still much wanted on this subject. No other poison seems\r\nso likely to possess a peculiar property of the kind. Nevertheless it is\r\nthe opinion of the best authorities, that spurred rye has no such power,\r\nexcept in connexion with violent constitutional injury produced by\r\ndangerous doses; and that it is endowed with the property only of\r\naccelerating natural labour, not of inducing it, particularly in the\r\nearly months of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nIt seems from the experiments of Dr. Wright to have no power whatever of\r\ninducing miscarriage in the lower animals.[2487] Notwithstanding the\r\nimprobability, however, of its possessing the property of bringing on\r\nabortion, it is one of the substances at present occasionally employed\r\nwith the view of feloniously causing this accident. In a case of attempt\r\nto procure abortion, which occurred not long ago in this city, one of\r\nthe articles repeatedly employed, but without success, was powder of\r\nspurred rye,—as I had occasion to ascertain by chemical analysis.\r\n\r\n_Of Spurred Maize._—It has been already observed, that many other plants\r\nof the Natural Family of Grasses are subject to the ergot besides rye.\r\nBut the only other species in which the disease has been particularly\r\nexamined is Indian corn or maize [_Zea Mays_]. It appears from the\r\ninquiries of M. Roullin that maize is very subject to the spur in the\r\nprovinces of Neyba and Maraquita in Colombia; that the spur forms a\r\nblack, pear-shaped body on the ear in place of the pickle; and that in\r\nthis state the grain, which is known by the name of _maïs peladero_,\r\npossesses properties injurious to animal life. Its effects, however, are\r\nsomewhat different from those of spurred rye. Men who eat the ergotted\r\nmaize lose their hair and sometimes their teeth, but are never attacked\r\nwith dry gangrene or convulsions. When swine eat it, which after a time\r\nthey do with avidity, the bristles drop off, and the hind-legs become\r\nfeeble and wasted. Mules likewise lose their hair, and the hoofs swell.\r\nFowls lay their eggs without the shell. Apes and parrots, which frequent\r\nthe fields of spurred maize, fall down as if drunk; and the native dogs\r\nand deer experience similar effects.[2488]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Of the Rust of Wheat._\r\n\r\nThere are several other diseases to which grain is liable, and which are\r\nmuch more common in this country than the ergot. But very little is\r\nknown of their effects on the animal body; which circumstance, since the\r\nwheat of this and other countries often suffers from them, is probably\r\nsufficient to show that their influence must be trifling, or at all\r\nevents very seldom called forth. Wheat is liable to three diseases. One\r\nis a disease of the stalk and leaf rather than of the ear, and has the\r\neffect of preventing the development of the ear or its pickles, and of\r\ncovering the plant with a brown powder. Of the two other diseases, which\r\nboth attack the pickles of the ear, one consists in the substitution of\r\na brown dry powder for the farina of the pickle, and the other of a\r\ndeposition of black moist matter in the fissure of the pickle, the\r\nsubstance of which it also invades and partially destroys. One of these\r\nis called in Scotland _brown rust_, the other _black rust_.\r\n\r\nOf the three diseases the only one which is apt to infect the flour is\r\nthe black rust. The others, as they consist of a light dry powder, are\r\nalmost entirely separated in thrashing and winnowing the grain. But the\r\nblack rust being damp and adhesive, it is carried along with the\r\npickles. Such pickles are almost invariably separated by the farmer if\r\nthey are abundant; for otherwise, on account of the dark colour and\r\ndisagreeable odour of the matter deposited on them, the flour possesses\r\nexternal qualities which would be at once recognized by a dealer of\r\nordinary experience.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable, that a moderate impregnation of bread with the\r\npowder formed by the diseases in question may take place, without\r\nleading to any unpleasant effect on the human body. Experiments to this\r\neffect were made by Parmentier with one of them, termed in France\r\n_carie_, or caries of wheat, which from his description appears to be\r\nthe black rust of Scottish farmers. He gave two dogs each two drachms\r\ndaily of the powder for fifteen days, without remarking any sign of ill\r\nhealth. Bread made with wheat flour containing a 64th of the powder,\r\nwhen eaten by various people, and Parmentier among the rest, to the\r\namount of a pound daily for several days, caused slight headache and\r\npain in the stomach the first day only; and in larger proportion it had\r\nas little effect.[2489]\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that the introduction of any deleterious ingredient\r\ninto wheat bread is hardly to be dreaded from the common diseases to\r\nwhich wheat is liable in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Of Unripe Grain._\r\n\r\nWheat and other grains have been supposed to acquire qualities\r\ndetrimental to health, from being cut down while unripe, or used\r\nimmediately after being cut down, although ripe. I am not aware that\r\naccidents have ever been traced or even imputed to such causes in this\r\ncountry; and, on the whole, I believe it is generally considered here,\r\nthat imperfect ripening of the pickle rather lessens the quantity, than\r\nimpairs the quality, of the flour. But several times epidemics have been\r\nascribed in France to unripe wheat. In 1801 M. Bouvier read a memoir to\r\nthe Society of Medicine at Paris, ascribing to new and unripe wheat an\r\nepidemic dysentery, which laid waste several districts of the department\r\nof the Oise in the autumn of 1793. These districts abound in small farms\r\nof a few acres, on the produce of which the cultivators depend in great\r\nmeasure for their subsistence. Hence in unfavourable seasons the corn\r\nwas commonly cut down before it was ripe, and made into bread soon after\r\nbeing reaped. It was accordingly among the peasantry of these farms\r\nonly, and not among the agriculturists in large farms, which were under\r\nbetter management, that the epidemic prevailed. Bouvier remarks, that at\r\nall times when the long continuance of wet weather has compelled the\r\ninhabitants of a district to cut down the wheat before it is ripe, or a\r\nprevious dearth has forced them to use it when newly cut, epidemic\r\ndisorders of the bowels have been observed to rage in the latter months\r\nof autumn. And as an instance of this he refers to the year 1783, when\r\nthe crops around Paris were believed to have been injured by the\r\nextraordinary prevalence of fogs, and were cut down unripe and used\r\nimmediately. Various epidemics broke out in the metropolis, and still\r\nmore in the surrounding country.[2490] This is an important subject for\r\nfarther inquiry; but at present I cannot help thinking that M. Bouvier\r\nexaggerates the effects of the immaturity of the grain. At all events,\r\nthe grain is often cut down in an unripe state in various districts of\r\nthis country; and I have never heard that any epidemic diseases were\r\nproduced. When M. Bouvier witnessed the epidemic of 1793 in the\r\ndepartment of the Oise, he instructed the inhabitants of his own parish\r\nto dry the unripe corn before thrashing it, to repeat the process before\r\nthe grain was converted into flour, and to mix with the flour a larger\r\nquantity than usual of yeast in making it into bread; and he states that\r\nin the succeeding year, which was even more unfavourable to the crops,\r\nthey were enabled, by following these directions, to use unripe corn\r\nwith safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Of Spoiled Bread._\r\n\r\nThis is the fittest opportunity for noticing certain injurious effects\r\nsometimes observed from the use of spoiled or mouldy bread. On the\r\ncontinent repeated instances have occurred of severe and even dangerous\r\npoisoning from spoiled rye-bread, barley-bread, and even wheat bread.\r\nSeveral instances have been observed of horses having been killed in a\r\nshort space of time with symptoms of irritant poisoning after eating\r\nsuch bread with their ordinary food.[2491] And Ur. Westerhoff has given\r\nan account of its effects on two children and several adults. In\r\nchildren the symptoms were redness of the features, dry tongue, frequent\r\nweak pulse, violent colic pains, urgent thirst and headache, and\r\nsubsequently vomiting and diarrhœa, alternating with great exhaustion\r\nand sleepiness. The bread in these instances was made of rye.[2492] It\r\nappears that in bread so spoiled a variety of mucedinous vegetables are\r\ndeveloped, especially the _Penicillium glaucum_ and _P. roseum_; and it\r\nis imagined by some, that this circumstance may account for the\r\ndeleterious effect of the bread.[2493]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Of the Effects of Darnel-Grass._\r\n\r\nGrain is also rendered more or less injurious by the accidental or\r\nintentional admixture of a variety of foreign substances, by which, in\r\ncommon speech, it is said to be adulterated. The subject of the\r\nadulteration of grain is a very important topic in medical police. But\r\nas this practice seldom imparts to the grain qualities decidedly\r\npoisonous, the consideration of it would be misplaced here. One variety,\r\nhowever, the accidental adulteration of flour with the seeds of the\r\n_Lolium temulentum_ or darnel-grass calls for some notice; for it may\r\noccasion not only symptoms of poisoning, but even also death itself.\r\n\r\nThis is the only poisonous species of the natural order of the grasses.\r\nThe seeds appear to be powerfully narcotic, and at the same time to\r\npossess acrid properties. Seeger gave a dog three ounces of a decoction\r\nof the flour, and observed that it was seized in five hours with violent\r\ntrembling and great feebleness, which were succeeded in four hours by\r\nsopor and insensibility; but it recovered next day.[2494]\r\n\r\nWhen mixed with bread and taken habitually by man, darnel-grass has been\r\nknown to cause headache, giddiness, somnolency, delirium, convulsions,\r\nparalysis, and even death. M. Cordier found by experiment on himself,\r\nthat very soon after eating bread containing darnel-grass flour, he felt\r\nconfusion of sight and ideas, languor, heaviness, and alternate attacks\r\nof somnolency and vomiting. The bread was commonly vomited soon after he\r\nate it.[2495] Seeger has related some cases in which the somnolency was\r\nmuch more deep; and states that general tremors are almost always\r\npresent.[2496] A few years ago almost the whole inmates of the Poor’s\r\nHouse at Sheffield, to the amount of eighty, were attacked with\r\nanalogous symptoms after breakfasting on oatmeal porridge; and it was\r\nsupposed that the meal had been accidentally adulterated with the\r\nlolium. The chief symptoms were a piercing stare, violent agitation of\r\nthe limbs, quivering of the lips, frontal headache, confusion of sight,\r\ndilated pupil, small tremulous pulse, twitches of the muscles, and\r\npalpitation. In twelve hours all of the persons attacked were well but\r\ntwo, who had strong convulsions in the subsequent night, but also\r\neventually recovered.[2497] A similar accident is mentioned by Perleb,\r\nas having happened at Freyburg in the House of Correction. The inmates,\r\nsoon after eating bread made with new flour, were attacked to the number\r\nof forty, with loss of speech and somnolency; and for some days\r\nafterwards they complained of sickness.[2498] The accident was ascribed\r\nto darnel-grass. In a recent instance which happened in the workhouse of\r\nBeninghausen, and which was traced to the lolium, seventy-four people\r\nwere attacked with giddiness, tremor, convulsions, and vomiting. Those\r\nwho had led a dissipated life suffered most, and children least of\r\nall.[2499]\r\n\r\nSometimes this poison appears to excite symptoms of intestinal\r\nirritation, without acting as a narcotic. A small farmer near Poicters\r\nin France saved five bushels of the seed from a field of wheat,—had it\r\nground with a single bushel of wheat, and afterwards made bread with the\r\nmixture for his own family. He himself, with his wife and a servant,\r\nbegan to eat the bread on a Thursday; but the two last were so violently\r\naffected with vomiting and purging, that they refused to continue taking\r\nit. He persevered himself, however, till on the Sunday evening he became\r\nso ill that his wife wished to send for medical aid. This he refused to\r\nallow, and next day he expired after suffering severely from fits of\r\ncolic.[2500]\r\n\r\nBley of Bemburg has examined chemically the grain of lolium. He obtained\r\nfrom it a bitter extractive matter, without any characteristic chemical\r\nproperties, but which killed a pigeon. The seed has a very feeble\r\nbitterish taste. Bley maintains that its poisonous properties are\r\nessential to it, and not incidental, as some think.[2501]\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Of the Effects of certain Poisonous Leguminous Seeds._\r\n\r\nAmong the injurious substances with which various grains are apt to be\r\naccidentally mixed from their growing together, two leguminous plants\r\nmay be here shortly mentioned, as they have often been the source of\r\ndisagreeable accidents on the continent.\r\n\r\nIn the department of the Cher and Loire in France, severe effects have\r\nbeen traced to bread made partly with flour of the _Lathyrus cicera_. M.\r\nDesparanches, in a report to the Prefect of the Department, says this\r\nflour occasionally forms one-half of that of which bread is made in some\r\nparishes; that it produces sometimes sudden incapability of walking,\r\nsometimes imperfect paraplegia and pain, with a draggling gait and\r\nturning in of the toes, and sometimes also slight convulsive movements\r\nof the thighs and legs.[2502] Similar effects have been traced to this\r\nsubstance formerly. Virey says it has been known to produce in\r\nparticular a singular stiffness and state of semiflexion of the\r\nknee-joint, compelling the individual to move the limbs in one rigid\r\nmass.[2503]\r\n\r\nThe _Ervum ervilia_, or Bitter-vetch, which is not a native of this\r\ncountry, has also been found in France to possess analogous properties.\r\nIn 1815, according to Virey, a great variety of herbs grew up with the\r\ngrain, in consequence of the wetness of the summer; and their seeds were\r\nthus subsequently mixed with the wheat and rye. Among these he\r\nparticularizes the bitter-vetch as peculiarly noxious, because it\r\nproduces so great weakness of the extremities, but especially of the\r\nlimbs, that the individual trembles while standing, and totters when he\r\nwalks, or even requires the help of stilts; and he adds, that horses are\r\nsimilarly affected, so as to become almost paralytic.[2504]\r\n\r\nThe _Cytisus laburnum_, or laburnum tree, is another plant of the same\r\nfamily, which yields poisonous seeds. The whole plant is more or less\r\ndeleterious. But it is chiefly the seed that has attracted attention\r\nhitherto.\r\n\r\nI am not acquainted with any experiments relative to the action of the\r\nseeds on animals.—Its effects on man present considerable variety, and\r\nshow that it is a true narcotico-acrid. In some instances they seem to\r\nhave been purely narcotic. My colleague Dr. Traill has communicated to\r\nme two cases of this nature. In one of these, that of a child two years\r\nold, the first evident effects were sudden paleness and a fit of\r\nscreaming, followed immediately by insensibility, and then by coldness\r\nof the whole body and lividity of the face; but vomiting having been\r\ninduced by warm water and mustard, the seeds were discharged, the\r\nsymptoms abated, and next day he was quite well. The other case was that\r\nof a boy who was left by his companions at Dr. Traill’s door in a state\r\nof complete insensibility, with froth at the mouth and a feeble pulse.\r\nAn emetic, administered immediately, brought up a large quantity of\r\nlaburnum seeds; after which the pulse became firmer, and sensibility\r\nquickly returned.—Mr. North has briefly noticed a similar case of a\r\nchild, who after eating laburnum flowers, was seized with paleness and\r\ntwitches of the face, coldness of the skin, laborious breathing, efforts\r\nto vomit, and great feebleness of the pulse. But recovery took place\r\nafter the flowers were vomited.[2505]—In other instances the effects\r\nhave been chiefly limited to an irritant action on the stomach and\r\nbowels. Dr. Bigsby of Newark informs me that a few years ago a little\r\ngirl in his neighbourhood, in consequence of eating the seeds, was\r\nattacked with violent vomiting and purging, and became in other respects\r\nvery ill, but recovered in forty-eight hours.—Most generally, however,\r\nthe effects are partly irritant, partly narcotic. In 1839 Dr. Annan of\r\nKinross communicated to me the case of a little boy, who in an hour\r\nafter swallowing a small quantity of unripe seeds, was attacked with\r\nviolent vomiting and ghastly expression of countenance, and then fell\r\ninto a very drowsy state, from which he was constantly roused by shaking\r\nhim and dashing cold water on his body. But for a month afterwards he\r\ncontinued subject to vomiting and diarrhœa.—Mr. Bonney of Brentford has\r\nrelated the particulars of eleven cases, which presented all the\r\nvarieties of poisoning with the seeds. The subjects were children from\r\nseven to nine years of age; and they took, some of them one seed, and\r\nnone more than five. Three scarcely suffered at all. One vomited the\r\npoison and got well at once. Of the others, some had only nausea and\r\nfeebleness of the pulse, another had also dilatation of the pupils, some\r\nhad vomiting and purging, others great drowsiness, others again both\r\nsets of symptoms. In all the pulse was weak and generally rapid.\r\nEmetics, laxatives and ammonia were administered with success.[2506]\r\n\r\nThe leaves of this plant are stated by Vicat, a good authority, to\r\npossess the property of acting violently as an emetic and\r\npurgative;[2507] and Cadet says the unripe pods have been known to\r\nproduce in small quantities severe vomiting, and profuse, protracted\r\ndiarrhœa.[2508]\r\n\r\nMy attention was lately turned by a criminal trial in this country to\r\nthe effects of the bark, which is not alluded to as a poison by any\r\nauthor, although its properties seem well known to the peasantry in the\r\nnorth of Scotland. A lad Gordon was tried lately at Inverness for\r\nadministering poison to a fellow-servant, and it was proved that he gave\r\nher laburnum-bark in broth. She immediately became very sick, and was\r\nsoon attacked with incessant vomiting and purging, pain in the belly,\r\nrigor, and extreme feebleness; and several days elapsed before she could\r\nreturn to her work. The sickness, vomiting, purging and pain continued\r\nafterwards to recur more or less; great emaciation ensued; in six weeks\r\nshe was so much reduced as to be compelled to quit service; and even six\r\nmonths afterwards, she continued so ill with a chronic dysenteric\r\naffection, that fears were entertained for her life, although eventually\r\nshe did recover. Being consulted in the case, I was inclined to rely in\r\nthe general properties of the plant and the peculiar, intense, nauseous\r\nbitterness of the bark, even more intense there than in the seeds, as\r\nadequate proof that the bark was capable of producing the effects\r\nobserved in this case. I was scarcely prepared, however, to find it so\r\ndeadly a narcotic poison, as it proved to be on careful experiment. Dr.\r\nRoss of Dornoch, who saw the woman and was also consulted on the part of\r\nthe crown in the case, found that from twenty to seventy grains of dried\r\nlaburnum-bark caused speedy and violent vomiting when administered to\r\ndogs, but no other marked effect. I found that when an infusion of a\r\ndrachm of dried bark was injected into the stomach of a strong rabbit,\r\nthe animal in two minutes began to look quickly from side to side, as if\r\nalarmed and uncertain in which direction to go, then twitched back its\r\nhead two or three times, and instantly fell on its side in violent\r\ntetanic convulsions, with alternating opisthotonos and emprosthotonos so\r\nenergetic that its body bounded with great force upon the side up and\r\ndown the room. Suddenly in half a minute more all motion ceased,\r\nrespiration was at an end, and, excepting that the heart continued for a\r\nlittle to contract with some force, life was extinct. No morbid\r\nappearance was visible anywhere. The heart was gorged, but irritable.\r\nDr. Ross subsequently repeated this experiment, and obtained analogous\r\nresults; but the animals he operated on did not die for half an hour or\r\nupwards.[2509]\r\n\r\nMM. Chevallier and Lassaigne have discovered in the seeds an active\r\nprinciple called cytisin, a nauseous, bitter, brownish-yellow, neutral,\r\nuncrystallizable substance, of which small doses killed various animals\r\namidst vomiting and convulsions, and eight grains taken by man in four\r\ndoses brought on giddiness, violent spasms, and frequency of the pulse,\r\nlasting for two hours, and followed by exhaustion.[2510]\r\n\r\nA great number of Brown’s division Papilionaceæ of the present natural\r\nfamily probably possess similar properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLI.\r\n        OF POISONING WITH ALCOHOL, ETHER, AND EMPYREUMATIC OILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last group of the narcotico-acrids comprehends _alcohol_, _ether_,\r\nand the _oleaginous products of combustion_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Of Poisoning with Alcohol._\r\n\r\n_Of its Action on Animals, and Symptoms in Man._—Alcohol has been\r\ngenerally believed, since the experiments of Sir B. Brodie,[2511] to act\r\non the brain through the medium of the nerves, and to do so without\r\nentering the blood. This may be doubted. At least in some experiments\r\nperformed several years ago by Dr. C. Coindet and myself it appeared not\r\nto act so swiftly, but that absorption might easily have taken place\r\nbefore its operation began. At all events, through whatever channel it\r\nmay operate, there is no doubt that it enters the blood; for in man the\r\nbreath has a strong smell of spirit for a considerable time after it is\r\nswallowed; and it has been found in the tissues and secretions after\r\ndeath from large doses. Professor Orfila found that alcohol is a violent\r\npoison when injected into the cellular tissue; and that it produces\r\nthrough that channel the same effects as when taken into the\r\nstomach.[2512] In the course of our experiments Dr. C. Coindet and I\r\nfound that it acted with great rapidity when injected into the cavity of\r\nthe chest.\r\n\r\nAuthors who have treated of the action of alcohol and spirituous liquors\r\non man, have distinguished three degrees in its immediate effects.\r\n\r\n1. When the dose is small, much excitement and little subsequent\r\ndepression are produced.\r\n\r\n2. When the effect is sufficiently great to receive the designation of\r\npoisoning, the symptoms are more violent excitement, flushed face,\r\ngiddiness, confusion of thought, delirium, and various mental\r\naffections, varying with individual character, and too familiar to\r\nrequire description here. These symptoms are soon followed by dozing and\r\ngradually increasing somnolency, which may at length become so deep as\r\nnot to be always easily broken. After the state of somnolency has\r\ncontinued several hours, it ceases gradually, but is followed by\r\ngiddiness, weakness stupidity, headache, sickness, and vomiting.\r\n\r\nThis degree of injury from alcohol may prove fatal, either in itself, by\r\nthe coma becoming deeper and deeper,—or from the previous excited state\r\nof the circulation causing diseases of the brain in a predisposed\r\nhabit,—or more frequently from the occurrence of some trifling accident,\r\nwhich in his torpid state the individual cannot avoid or remedy, such as\r\nexposure to cold, falling with the face in mud or water, suffocation\r\nfrom vomited matters getting into the windpipe, and the like.\r\n\r\nOf simple poisoning by the gradual increase of coma the following\r\njudicial case in which I was consulted is a characteristic example. Two\r\nbrothers drank in half an hour three bottles of porter, with which three\r\nhalf-mutchkins (24 ounces) of whisky had been secretly mixed by a\r\ncompanion, whose object was to fill them drunk by way of joke. In the\r\ncourse of drinking both became confused. In fifteen minutes after\r\nfinishing the last bottle one of them fell down insensible, and had no\r\nrecollection of what happened for twelve hours; but he recovered. The\r\nother staggered a considerable distance for an hour, and then became\r\nquite insensible and unable to stand. In four hours more consciousness\r\nand sensibility were quite extinct, the breathing stertorous and\r\nirregular, the pulse 80 and feeble, the pupils dilated and not\r\ncontractile, and deglutition impossible. In this state he remained\r\nwithout any material change till his death, which took place in fifteen\r\nhours after he finished his debauch. A surgeon saw him when he had been\r\nfive hours ill, but did little for his relief, as the case appeared\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nThere is a singular variety in the principal symptoms of this form of\r\npoisoning, even when completely formed. From a careful tabular analysis\r\nof no fewer than twenty-six cases, chiefly of the present denomination,\r\ncollected by Dr. Ogston of Aberdeen from the experience of the\r\npolice-office there, it appears that when the stage of stupor is fully\r\nformed, the person is sometimes capable of being roused, sometimes\r\nimmovably comatose for a long time,—that the pulse is sometimes\r\nimperceptible or very feeble, sometimes distinct or even full, generally\r\nslow or natural, seldom frequent, very seldom firm,—that the pupils are\r\noccasionally contracted, much more generally dilated, and in a few\r\ninstances alternating between one state and the other,—that the\r\ncountenance is commonly pale, sometimes turgid and flushed,—and that the\r\nbreathing is for the most part slow, and also soft, yet not unfrequently\r\nlaborious, but very rarely stertorous. Convulsions are rare, having been\r\nobserved twice only, and on both occasions in young people of the age of\r\ntwelve or fourteen.[2513] Dr. Ogston has tried to group these several\r\nsymptoms together in classified cases; but the general conclusions at\r\nwhich he arrives are subject to important exceptions. Neither do any of\r\nthe special symptoms seem to bear a marked relation to the ultimate\r\nevent. It is peculiarly worthy of remark, that very many cases got well\r\nwhere the pupils were much dilated, the coma profound, and the pulse\r\nimperceptible.\r\n\r\nIn the present form of poisoning with alcoholic fluids, it usually\r\nhappens that if the stage of stupor be completely overcome, recovery\r\nspeedily ensues, without any particular symptom except headache,\r\ngiddiness, sickness, and the customary consequences of a debauch. Hut on\r\nsome occasions the comatose stage is succeeded by one which indicates\r\nmuch cerebral excitement,—by flushed face, injected eyes, restlessness,\r\na febrile state of the pulse, and delirium, even of the violent kind. In\r\nother cases this affection puts on very much the characters of a slight\r\nattack of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nIn the second variety of the second degree of intoxication, an\r\napoplectic disposition is called into action by the excited state of the\r\ncirculating system; and death ensues from apoplexy or some other disease\r\nof the brain, rather than from simple poisoning. Thus in some instances,\r\nas will be more fully mentioned under the head of the morbid\r\nappearances, extravasation of blood is found within the head after\r\ndeath, preceded by the usual phenomena of ordinary intoxication. Since\r\nthis is a rare effect of intoxication, it must be considered as the\r\nresult of poisoning with spirits, exciting sanguineous apoplexy in a\r\npredisposed constitution. In other cases the stupor of intoxication,\r\nafter putting on all the characters of apoplexy for two days and\r\nupwards, terminates fatally without extravasation. Here the poison\r\noperates by developing a constitutional tendency to congestive apoplexy.\r\nAgain, this mode of action is still more clearly shown in some cases,\r\nwhere an interval of returning health occurs between the immediate\r\nnarcotic effects of the poison and the ultimate apoplectic coma which is\r\nthe occasion of death. Such a course of events, which, however, is of\r\nrare occurrence, is well exemplified in the following cases. A man drank\r\n32 ounces of rum one afternoon, and was comatose most of the ensuing\r\nnight. Next morning, though very drowsy, he was sensible when roused;\r\nand in the evening he was considered convalescent. But two days\r\nafterwards he became delirious; in two days more he died comatose; and\r\ncongestion was the only appearance found in the brain.[2514] Another\r\ninstance, most remarkable in its circumstances, is the following, which\r\nhas been related by Dr. Golding Bird. A workman in a distillery, after\r\ndrinking eight ounces of rectified spirit by mistake for water, suddenly\r\nfell down senseless and motionless, and remained so for eleven hours. He\r\nthen began to recover, and came round so far that he returned to his\r\nwork next morning. After this he continued to pass dark, pitch-like\r\nevacuations. In three weeks he became drowsy, mistook one thing for\r\nanother, answered questions sluggishly, and had a frequent pulse, and\r\ndilated sluggish pupils; in which state he continued three weeks later\r\nwhen the account was published.[2515] The following case, related by Dr.\r\nChowne, also seems to belong to the same category, although it presents\r\nanomalies. A boy, eight years of age, soon after swallowing about eight\r\nounces of gin, said he felt like a drunk man, and suddenly became\r\nmotionless and insensible. In no long time he vomited a fluid of the\r\nodour of gin; and in seven hours from the commencement a fluid was\r\nwithdrawn from the stomach, possessing no longer any such odour. He was\r\nnow motionless, insensible, pale, and cold; the pupils were contracted,\r\nthe pulse feeble and hurried, the breathing stertorous and slow; and he\r\nmade ineffectual efforts to vomit. Stimulants of all kind had little\r\neffect on him for a day and a half, when the breathing became more\r\nnatural, and his look quite intelligent. Yet he could not answer\r\nquestions, exhibited no sign of volition, and had a pulse so frequent as\r\n160. In twenty-four hours more the breathing became laborious and\r\nrattling, and the lips livid; and death took place near the close of the\r\nthird day. The only appearances of any note in the dead body were\r\ngeneral injection of the arachnoid membrane of the brain, and effusion\r\nof frothy mucus into the bronchial ramifications.[2516] Similar to these\r\nis the following extraordinary case which has been communicated to me by\r\nDr. Traill. A boy seven years of age, who was persuaded by two\r\nmiscreants to take nearly five ounces of undiluted whisky, suffered for\r\ntwo days from the ordinary symptoms of excessive intoxication, which\r\nwere then immediately followed by epileptic convulsions. These continued\r\nto recur with more or less violence, but always frequently, for two\r\nmonths down to the date of the judicial investigation to which the case\r\ngave rise. All these forms of the effects of drinking ardent spirits can\r\nscarcely be considered as simple poisoning, but as the result of\r\npoisoning developing a tendency to diseases of the head.\r\n\r\nThe third variety of poisoning with spirits in the second degree proves\r\nfatal, not in itself, but by some trivial accident happening, from which\r\nthe individual cannot escape on account of his powerless insensibility.\r\nThus, it is no uncommon thing for persons in a state of deep\r\nintoxication to fall down in an exposed place, where they perish from\r\ncold, or to tumble with the face in a puddle, and so be suffocated, or\r\nto be choked by inhaling the contents of the stomach imperfectly\r\nvomited, or by lying in such a posture that their neck-cloth produces\r\nstrangulation. These statements are so familiar, that it is unnecessary\r\nto illustrate them by special facts. The reader’s attention was called\r\nto such accidents in the previous editions of this work. Two well-marked\r\ncases of the kind have been since published by Mr. Skae.[2517]\r\n\r\nIn cases of simple poisoning in the second degree the progress of the\r\nsymptoms is on the whole remarkably uniform, gradual and uninterrupted.\r\nBut there are likewise some anomalies which it may be well to notice.\r\nThus, occasionally after the phenomena of ordinary intoxication have\r\ngone on gradually increasing without having attained a very great\r\nheight, sudden lethargy supervenes at once, and may prove fatal with\r\nsingular rapidity. My colleague, Dr. Alison, has communicated to me the\r\nparticulars of a case of the kind where death took place from simple\r\nintoxication, twenty minutes after the state of lethargy began. The\r\nindividual reached his home in a state of reeling drunkenness, but able\r\nto speak and give an indistinct account of himself. He then became\r\nlethargic, and died in the course of twenty minutes. On examining the\r\nbody, Dr. Alison could not discover any morbid appearance, except some\r\nwatery effusion on the surface of the brain and in the ventricles; but\r\nthe contents of the stomach had a strong smell of spirits. Instances of\r\nsuch excessive rapidity, however, are rare, unless from the third form\r\nof poisoning.—An anomaly of a different kind, of which a remarkable\r\nexample was brought judicially under my notice, is sudden supervention\r\nof deep insurmountable stupor, without the usual precursory symptoms,\r\nyet not till after a considerable interval subsequently to drinking. In\r\nMay, 1830, a lad of sixteen, in consequence of a bet with a\r\nspirit-dealer, swallowed sixteen ounces of whisky in the course of ten\r\nminutes, and, pursuant to the terms of the wager, walked up and down the\r\nroom for half an hour. He then went into the open air, apparently not at\r\nall the worse for his feat; but in a very few minutes, while in the act\r\nof putting his hand into his pocket to take out some money, he became so\r\nsuddenly senseless as to forget to withdraw his hand, and so insensible\r\nthat his companions could not rouse him. A surgeon, who was immediately\r\nprocured, contented himself with giving several clysters and a dose of\r\ntartar-emetic, which did not operate; and the young man died in the\r\ncourse of sixteen hours. The cause of the retardation of the symptoms\r\nwas partly perhaps that he had taken supper only an hour before drinking\r\nthe spirits, but chiefly, I presume, because the stupor was kept off for\r\na time by the stimulus of determination to win his bet.—Several cases\r\nsomewhat similar have been described by Dr. Ogston. In these sudden\r\ninsensibility came on while the individuals had been drinking freely for\r\nsome time, without showing any marked sign of approaching\r\nintoxication.[2518] The cause of the postponement and sudden invasion of\r\nthe stupor does not exactly appear; but a familiar cause of its abrupt\r\ninvasion in ordinary cases of drunkenness is sudden exposure to cold.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to fix the extremes of duration of the present form of\r\npoisoning in fatal cases. For, on the one hand, one or other of the\r\naccidents mentioned above may bring the case to a speedy close; and, on\r\nthe other hand, the supervention of apoplexy may protract it to several\r\ndays. The ordinary duration in fatal cases seems to be from twelve to\r\neighteen hours.\r\n\r\n3. The third degree of poisoning is not so often witnessed, because, in\r\norder to produce it, a greater quantity of spirits must be swallowed\r\npure and at once, than is usually taken by those among whom poisoning in\r\nthe second degree chiefly occurs. When swallowed in large quantity, as\r\nby persons who have taken foolish wagers on their prowess in drinking,\r\nthere is seldom much preliminary excitement; coma approaches in a few\r\nminutes and soon becomes profound, as in apoplexy. The face is then\r\nsometimes livid, more generally ghastly pale; the breathing stertorous,\r\nand of a spirituous odour; the pupils sometimes much contracted, more\r\ncommonly dilated and insensible; and if relief is not speedily procured,\r\ndeath takes place,—generally in a few hours, and sometimes immediately.\r\nAccording to Mr. Bedingfield, who witnessed many cases of poisoning with\r\nrum at Liverpool, which always follow the arrival of the West India\r\nvessels, the patient will recover if the iris remains contractile; but\r\nif it is dilated and motionless on the approach of a light, recovery is\r\nvery improbable.[2519]\r\n\r\nA case is briefly alluded to by Orfila of a soldier, who drank eight\r\npints of brandy for a wager, and died instantly.[2520] A case of the\r\nsame kind is quoted by Professor Marx.[2521] Another, which happened in\r\nthe person of a London cabman, is noticed in a French Journal. The man,\r\nfor a bribe of five shillings, drank at a draught a whole bottle of gin;\r\nand in a few minutes he dropped down dead.[2522] Similar accidents occur\r\nnot infrequently in this country; but I have not met with any fully\r\ndescribed by authors. A case of the less rapid variety of the present\r\nform occurred at the Infirmary here in 1820. A man stole a bottle of\r\nwhiskey; and, being in danger of detection, took what he thought the\r\nsurest way of concealing it, by drinking it all. He died in four hours\r\nwith symptoms of pure coma.\r\n\r\nConvulsions are not common in such cases. I have seen a remarkable\r\nexample, however, in which the coma was accompanied with constant\r\nalternating _opisthotonos_ and _emprosthotonos_. The subject was a boy\r\nwho had been induced to drink raw whisky by an acquaintance, and had\r\nbeen two hours insensible before I saw him. The stomach-pump, which was\r\nimmediately applied, brought away a large quantity of fluid with a\r\nstrong spirituous odour; and he recovered his senses in fifteen minutes,\r\nbut remained very drowsy for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nSuch are the forms of poisoning with spirits usually admitted by\r\nauthors. But it also appears to act sometimes as an irritant. After its\r\nordinary narcotic action passes off, another set of symptoms\r\noccasionally appear, which indicate inflammation of the alimentary\r\ncanal. Cases of this kind are exceedingly rare; yet they have been met\r\nwith, as the following extract shows. “A young man at Paris had been\r\ndrinking brandy immoderately for several successive days, when at length\r\nhe was attacked with shivering, nausea, feverishness, pain in the\r\nstomach, vomiting of everything he swallowed except cold water, thirst,\r\nand at last hiccup, delirium, jaundice, and convulsions; and death took\r\nplace on the ninth day. On examining the body the stomach was found\r\ngangrenous over the whole villous coat; the colon too was much inflamed;\r\nand all the small intestines were red.”[2523]\r\n\r\nA case of great complexity, but probably of the same nature, has been\r\nrelated by Opitz in Pyl’s Memoirs. The subject was a woman liable to\r\nepilepsy, and addicted to excessive drinking. After one of her\r\ndrinking-bouts she was seized with vomiting and severe pain of the\r\nbowels, afterwards with delirium, then with convulsions, and she died in\r\ntwenty-four hours after the first attack. The stomach and intestines\r\nwere greatly inflamed, a table-spoonful of blood was effused into the\r\nventricles of the brain, and the left lung was purulent.[2524]\r\n\r\nBesides the immediately fatal effects of spirituous liquors now\r\ndescribed, there is still another variety of poisoning more common than\r\nany yet mentioned, and constituting a peculiar disease. People who fall\r\ninto the unhappy vice of habitual intoxication, after remaining in a\r\nstate of drunkenness for several days together, are often attacked with\r\na singular maniacal affection, which is accompanied with tremors,\r\nparticularly of the hands, and after enduring for several days, ends at\r\nlast in coma. When the delirium is not so violent, the disease by proper\r\ntreatment may be cured. But frequently, after the delirium and tremor\r\nhave continued mildly for some time, they increase, and the delirium\r\nbecomes furious, or coma rapidly supervenes; in either of which cases\r\nthe disorder commonly proves fatal in two or three days more. This\r\ndisease, which is now familiar to the physician, is called _delirium\r\ntremens_. It is supposed by some to depend on inflammation of the\r\nmembranes of the brain, followed by effusion.\r\n\r\nOther diseases, besides _delirium tremens_, are also slowly induced by\r\nthe habitual and excessive use of spirituous liquors; but in general\r\nthe habit of intoxication acts in inducing these diseases only as a\r\npredisposing cause. A particular variety of tuberculated liver\r\nprobably arises from the habitual use of spirits without the\r\nco-operation of other causes. That variety of disease of the kidney,\r\nwhich was first brought under the notice of the profession by Dr.\r\nBright,[2525] is also obviously often connected with the habit of\r\ndrinking spirits. The following have been enumerated among the\r\ndiseases where the same habit acts powerfully as a predisposing\r\ncause—indurated pancreas,—indurated mesenteric glands,—scirrhous\r\npylorus,—catarrh of the bladder,—inflammation, suppuration and\r\ninduration of the kidneys,—incontinence of urine,—aneurism of the\r\nheart and great vessels,—apoplexy of the lungs,—varicose\r\nveins,—mania,—epilepsy,—tendency to gangrene of wounds,—spontaneous\r\ncombustion.[2526]\r\n\r\n_Of the Morbid Appearances._—Some doubts exist as to the morbid\r\nappearances in the bodies of those poisoned by spirituous liquors.\r\n\r\nIn animals killed by alcohol, Orfila says he found the villous coat of\r\nthe stomach constantly of a cherry-red odour. I have several times\r\nremarked the same appearance. When the stomach was empty before the\r\nalcohol was introduced, I have always found the prominent part of its\r\nrugæ of a deep cherry-red tint, the margin of the patches being more\r\nflorid, and evidently consisting of a minute network of vessels.\r\n\r\nIn man these signs of irritation have not been always observed. In the\r\npatient who died in the Infirmary here, the stomach was quite natural to\r\nappearance. Dr. Ogston notices injection of the small intestines and\r\nthickening of the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines as\r\ncommon appearances in the cases he has examined; but he seems to\r\nconsider these the effects not of the last fatal dose, but of the habit\r\nof frequent excessive drinking.[2527]\r\n\r\nThe blood in the heart and great vessels is commonly fluid and very\r\ndark, and the lungs are sometimes more or less gorged with the same\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\nThe state of the brain differs much according to the mode of death.\r\nSometimes great congestion and even actual extravasation of blood are\r\nfound in the heads of persons who have died of excessive continuous\r\ndrinking,—the excitement of such a debauch being apt, as already\r\nmentioned, to induce apoplexy in a predisposed habit. Accordingly\r\nextravasation was found by Professor Bernt of Vienna in no less than\r\nfour cases of the kind, two of which happened in the persons of young\r\nmen not above twenty-two years of age;[2528] and Dr. Cooke quotes\r\nanother in his work on nervous diseases.[2529] I have myself met with\r\nanother remarkable instance. A female out-pensioner of Trinity Hospital\r\nhere, who was much addicted to drinking, and for fourteen days after the\r\nNew-year of 1830 had been very little in her sober senses, soon after\r\narriving at home one evening much intoxicated, fell down comatose, and\r\ndied in ten or twelve hours. An enormous extravasation of clotted blood\r\nwas found in the ventricles, producing extensive laceration of the right\r\nmiddle and anterior lobes of the brain.—In such cases it is natural to\r\nsuppose that a predisposition to apoplexy must concur with the\r\nintoxication; otherwise it is not easy to see why death from\r\nextravasation is not more frequently produced by excessive drinking.\r\n\r\nExtravasation is not apt to occur in the cases of rapid death brought on\r\nby a very large quantity swallowed at once. The circulation, indeed, is\r\nduring life in a state quite the reverse of excitement; and accordingly\r\nthe brain and its membranes are found quite healthy. They were\r\nparticularly so in the man who died in the hospital here. It is right to\r\nmention, however, that one of Bernt’s cases, although the symptoms and\r\nother particulars are not mentioned, possibly belongs to the present\r\nvariety, as the man swallowed for a wager a quart of brandy at a\r\ndraught.[2530] According to Dr. Ogston, who has given the best account\r\nof the appearances within the head in the ordinary cases of this kind,\r\nthere is usually serous effusion under the arachnoid membrane,\r\noccasionally minute injection of vessels, commonly more or less general\r\ngorging of the larger veins, and especially effusion of serosity to the\r\namount of two or even four ounces in the ventricles.[2531]\r\n\r\nWhen delirium tremens proves fatal, effusion is commonly found among the\r\nmembranes of the brain; and occasionally to a great extent. In one\r\ninstance, which proved fatal in two or three days, I have seen minute\r\nvascularity of the membranes, with effusion of fibrin, and without\r\neffusion of serosity; but such cases are rare. There is also, according\r\nto Andral, very extensive softening of the mucous coat of the\r\nstomach.[2532] In an instance mentioned in Rust’s Journal, besides\r\neffusion into the cerebral membranes, there was found an enormous\r\naccumulation of fat in all the cavities, a conversion of the muscular\r\nsubstance into fat, and a nauseous sweet smell from the whole\r\nbody.[2533]\r\n\r\nIn all cases of rapid poisoning with spirituous liquors some of the\r\npoison will be found in the stomach. For when the case is one of pure\r\nnarcotic poisoning, unaided by the effects of blows, exposure to cold,\r\nor the like, and the person dies in a few hours, the poison cannot be\r\nall absorbed before death.—Although the spirituous liquors used in\r\nBritain have all very powerful odours, the inspector in a case of\r\nimportance ought not to confine himself to this test alone. He must\r\nsubject the suspected matter to distillation; and then remove the water\r\nfrom what distils over by repeated agitation with dry carbonate of\r\npotass, till he procures the alcohol of the spirit in such a state of\r\npurity as to be inflammable.\r\n\r\nAlcohol may also be in some circumstances detected in the tissues and\r\nsecretions of the body. A spirituous odour has been remarked not\r\ninfrequently in various parts, and especially in the brain. Dr. Cooke\r\nmentions a case in which the fluid in the ventricles of the brain had\r\nthe smell and taste of gin, the liquor which had been taken;[2534] Dr.\r\nOgston adverts to an instance, in which after death by drowning during\r\nintoxication, he found in the ventricles nearly four ounces of fluid,\r\nhaving a strong odour of whisky;[2535] in the case which occurred in the\r\nhospital here the odour of whisky was said to have been perceived in the\r\npericardium; and in a man who died of long-continued intoxication from\r\nimmoderate drinking Dr. Wolffe found that the surface, and still more\r\nthe ventricles, of the brain had a strong smell of brandy, although the\r\ncontents of the stomach had not.[2536]\r\n\r\nThe presumption afforded by such facts as these, in favour of the\r\nabsorption of alcohol and the possibility of detecting it throughout the\r\nanimal system, has been turned to certainty by the late experimental\r\nresearches of Dr. Percy; who found that in animals poisoned with\r\nalcoholic fluids, as well as in the case of a man who died during the\r\nnight after drinking a bottle of rum, alcohol could be detected,\r\ngenerally in the urine, and also in the brain, by cautious distillation,\r\nand removing the water from the distilled fluid by means of dry\r\ncarbonate of potass.[2537] Dr. Percy gave me an opportunity of verifying\r\nhis results with the brain of the man; and I had no difficulty in\r\nobtaining from a few ounces of brain a sufficiency of spirit to exhibit\r\nits combustion on asbestus repeatedly.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to add, that when the individual has survived the\r\ntaking of the poison a considerable length of time, an odour of spirits\r\nwill not be perceived either in the stomach or elsewhere. In the\r\nout-pensioner of Trinity Hospital, for example, who survived about\r\ntwelve hours, no spirituous odour could any where be perceived. In such\r\ncases the poison disappears during life by absorption.—A question may\r\neven be entertained, whether the odour may not sometimes be\r\nimperceptible at the inspection of the body, although the poison was\r\nreally present immediately after death. It is probable that, as in the\r\ninstance of hydrocyanic acid, the alcohol, on account of its volatility\r\nor fluidity, will evaporate or percolate away in a few days. In this\r\nmanner only can be explained the occasional absence of the odour in\r\npersons who have been killed in the early stage of drunkenness. I could\r\nnot perceive any odour of whisky in the stomach of the woman Campbell,\r\nwho was murdered by the notorious resurrectionist Burke, although she\r\nhad drunk spirits to intoxication half an hour before her death. The\r\nbody was not examined till thirty-eight hours after.[2538] It must be\r\nobserved, however, that alcohol may exist in the contents of the stomach\r\nand be detected by chemical analysis, although it is not indicated by\r\nits odour. I have twice had occasion to observe this, where the bodies\r\nwere disinterred some time after death.\r\n\r\nFrom all that has been said, there ought seldom to be much difficulty in\r\nrecognizing a case of poisoning with spirituous liquors.\r\n\r\nBut, before quitting the subject, a form of it must be noticed which may\r\nbe extremely difficult to distinguish. It was formerly remarked that the\r\neatable mushrooms have been sometimes poisoned with substances\r\npossessing effects on the system analogous to those caused by the\r\ndeleterious fungi. In the same manner spirituous liquors may be poisoned\r\nwith narcotics allied to them in action. Thus, in former parts of this\r\nwork, it has been stated that a young man was killed during a debauch in\r\nconsequence of his companions having mingled opium with his wine; that\r\nmany persons have been poisoned and some killed by fermented liquors\r\ndrugged in the same manner; that murder has been accomplished by\r\npoisoning wine with nightshade; and that several fatal accidents have\r\noccurred in consequence of liqueurs having been too strongly impregnated\r\nwith hydrocyanic acid, to give them a ratafia flavour. Cases of this\r\nnature may be embarrassing. In general, they may be made out by\r\nattending strictly to the symptoms, the quantity of liquor taken, and\r\nthe contents of the stomach. But, it must be admitted, that if a\r\nmurderer, who chooses such a method, should season his guest’s drink\r\njudiciously, and ply him well with it, a medical jurist might be puzzled\r\nto determine whether the liquor was to blame in point of quality or\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\n_Of the Treatment._—The treatment of poisoning with alcoholic fluids\r\ndoes not differ essentially from that of poisoning with opium. In the\r\nformer, as in the latter, the chief objects must be to remove the poison\r\nfrom the stomach, and to rouse the patient from his state of stupor; but\r\nin poisoning with alcoholic fluids it is also frequently necessary to\r\ntreat a secondary stage of reaction by local and even general\r\nantiphlogistic measures. As to the primary object, the removal of the\r\npoison from the stomach, it appears that in the present form of\r\npoisoning emetics are more seldom effectual than in the case of other\r\nnarcotics, and that the stomach-pump should be promptly resorted to. It\r\nis remarkable that the operation of clearing out the stomach is likewise\r\noften a sufficient stimulus to dispel stupor immediately and even\r\npermanently. I have seen almost complete consciousness permanently\r\nrestored with the discharge of the alcoholic fluid; and the same remark\r\nhas been made by others. Where the senses are not thus restored, one of\r\nthe most effectual stimulants, according to the practice of the\r\npolice-office of this city, is the injection of water into the ears.\r\nGreat advantage has been derived, as in poisoning with opium, from the\r\ncold affusion applied to the head. Dr. Ogston, who has appended to his\r\npaper formerly quoted a very useful summary of the treatment of\r\npoisoning with spirits, has found this a safe and effectual remedy where\r\nthe heat of the head was unnaturally great and that of the body not too\r\nlow.[2539] Cases have been published where it proved successful although\r\nthe pulse was gone at the wrist, the breathing scarcely perceptible, and\r\nthe temperature of the whole body greatly reduced.[2540] It is doubtless\r\na powerful remedy: but where the general temperature of the surface is\r\nmuch lowered, I conceive it should be restricted to the head and neck,\r\nand conjoined with the application of warmth to the body. Dr. Ogston\r\nobjects to the general use of blood-letting in cases of poisoning with\r\nspirits, as being often apt to be followed by sudden sinking. Where\r\nother remedies are judiciously used, it is probably seldom called for;\r\nand the purpose it is intended to serve, namely, the relief of cerebral\r\ncongestion and determination, is better fulfilled by the local\r\nemployment of cold, and local blood-letting. Ammonia and its acetate\r\nhave been found useful as internal stimulants where the stupor is deep.\r\nThe treatment of the secondary affections adverted to above does not\r\nrequire specific mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Of Poisoning with Sulphuric and Nitric Ether._\r\n\r\nSulphuric ether and nitric ether are poisons of the same nature with\r\nalcohol. But the effects produced by them when taken in considerable\r\ndoses are not very well known.\r\n\r\nOrfila found that half an ounce of sulphuric ether introduced into the\r\nstomach of a dog and secured there by a ligature on the gullet, excited\r\nefforts to vomit, in ten minutes inability to stand, and in six minutes\r\nmore, insensibility. In fifteen minutes more the animal revived a\r\nlittle, but soon became again comatose; and it died in three hours after\r\nthe commencement of the experiment. The villous coat of the stomach was\r\nreddish-black, the other coats of a lively red colour.[2541]\r\n\r\nThe effects of the ethers on man have not been accurately ascertained.\r\nFrom some observations published in the Journal of Science, sulphuric\r\nether appears to act energetically even in small doses. In moderate\r\nquantity it produces a strong sense of irritation in the throat, a\r\nfeeling of fulness in the head, and other symptoms like those excited by\r\nnitrous-oxide gas. A gentleman, in consequence of inhaling it too long,\r\nwas attacked with intermitting lethargy for thirty-six hours, depression\r\nof spirits and lowness of pulse.[2542] When long and habitually used, as\r\nby persons afflicted with asthma, its dose must be gradually increased;\r\nand it appears that considerable quantities may then be taken for a\r\ngreat length of time without material injury. I have been informed of an\r\ninstance of an asthmatic gentleman about sixty years of age who consumed\r\nsixteen ounces every eight or ten days, and had been in the habit of\r\ndoing so for many years. Yet, with the exception of his asthma, he\r\nenjoyed tolerable health.\r\n\r\nAn interesting case has been published which proves that nitric ether in\r\nvapour is a dangerous poison when too freely and too long inhaled. A\r\ndruggist’s maid-servant was found one morning dead in bed, and death had\r\nevidently arisen from the air of her apartment having been accidentally\r\nloaded with vapour of nitric ether, from the breaking of a three-gallon\r\njar of the _spiritus etheris nitrici_. She was found lying on her side,\r\nwith her arms folded across the chest, the countenance and posture\r\ncomposed, and the whole appearance like a person in deep sleep. The\r\nstomach was red internally, and the lungs were gorged.[2543] The editor\r\nof the journal, where this case is related, says he is acquainted with a\r\nsimilar instance where a young man became completely insensible from\r\nbreathing air loaded with sulphuric ether, remained apoplectic for some\r\nhours, and would undoubtedly have perished had he not been discovered\r\nand removed in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Of Poisoning with the Oleaginous products of Combustion._\r\n\r\nThe physiological effects of these substances have not yet been\r\nextensively investigated. It has been already mentioned, that the\r\nempyreumatic oils of tobacco and other narcotic vegetables are active\r\npoisons; and that the emanations from candle snuffings and imperfectly\r\nconsumed tallow probably owe their injurious properties to a peculiar\r\noil. Many empyreumatic oils are known, and some are used in medicine,\r\nwhich act powerfully on the animal system as stimulants and\r\nantispasmodics. Among these may be enumerated naphtha, oil of galbanum,\r\noil of guiaiac, oil of amber, oil of wax, and Dippel’s oil. The last in\r\nparticular, which is the rectified empyreumatic oil of hartshorn, but is\r\nprepared also from blood and various animal matters,[2544] has been a\r\ngood deal used of late on the continent for medical purposes, and has\r\neven been resorted to as a poison for the purpose of self-destruction.\r\n\r\nThe only one of these substances whose physiological properties have\r\nbeen examined with particular care, is the empyreumatic oil procured by\r\nthe destructive distillation of lard. When freed of adhering acid by\r\nrectification from quicklime, this oil is limpid and very volatile, has\r\nan insupportable smell, and when diffused in the air, irritates the eyes\r\nand nostrils, and even excites giddiness. Buchner found it to possess\r\nsimple narcotic properties. When a mouse was confined under a jar, into\r\nwhich a little of its vapour was introduced, it suddenly tried to\r\nescape, immediately fell down exhausted, and, although soon afterwards\r\nremoved into the open air, expired in about fifteen minutes, without\r\nconvulsions. It is much less powerful when introduced into the stomach,\r\nyet is still a dangerous poison through that channel; for five drops\r\nprojected into the throat of a chaffinch very nearly proved fatal; and\r\nthe only symptoms were excessive exhaustion, slow respiration, and\r\ninsensibility.[2545]\r\n\r\nSimilar effects have been occasionally observed in man. The late\r\nProfessor Chaussier has related a case of poisoning in the human subject\r\nfrom the _oil of Dippel_, or rectified empyreumatic oil of hartshorn. It\r\nis merely mentioned, however, that the individual, on taking a spoonful\r\nby mistake, died immediately; and that no morbid appearance could be\r\ndiscovered in the dead body.[2546] Another case has been more recently\r\nrelated, where the poison was the impure oil of commerce, from which the\r\noil of Dippel is prepared by rectification. The subject was a woman, who\r\ntook it intentionally in the dose of an ounce and a half. The symptoms\r\ninduced could not be ascertained; but it appeared, that she had been\r\nattacked with vomiting, and, finding the action of the poison either\r\nless speedy, or less supportable than she expected, had thrown herself\r\ninto a well and been drowned. The appearances in the body clearly showed\r\nthat in this instance the poison had not acted as a pure narcotic. The\r\nwhole body exhaled the peculiar fetid odour of the oil. The palate,\r\ntongue, throat, and gullet, were white and shrivelled. The stomach had\r\noutwardly a diffuse rose tint, crossed by gorged black veins, which here\r\nand there had burst and formed patches of extravasation. The contents of\r\nthe stomach consisted of remains of food, a good deal of the oil, some\r\nwater, and likewise some extravasated blood. Its villous coat was thick,\r\ncovered with red points, corrugated into prominent rugæ, but not eroded.\r\nThe intestines also presented signs of irritation, but in an inferior\r\ndegree.[2547] Dr. Kurtze, a German author, mentions that the impure oil\r\n[Oleum Animale Fœtidum] was given with malicious intention in repeated\r\ndoses to an infant eighteen days old, whom he attended, and that it\r\ncaused crying and vomiting; and he quotes Froriep’s Notizen, for the\r\ncase of a woman of thirty, who swallowed nearly two ounces, and, after\r\nrepeated attacks of vomiting, threw herself into a well and was\r\ndrowned.[2548]\r\n\r\nThese facts seem to establish sufficiently the propriety of arranging\r\nthe empyreumatic oils among the narcotico-acrids.\r\n\r\n_Oil of turpentine_ possesses somewhat similar properties; but is much\r\nless active. It was found by Professor Schubarth, that two drachms of\r\nthis oil administered to a dog produced immediate staggering, cries,\r\ntetanus, failure of the pulse and breathing, and death in three minutes;\r\nand in the dead body he remarked flaccidity of the heart, gorging of the\r\nlungs, and redness of the stomach.[2549] It is likewise well known to be\r\na powerful poison for vermin, such as lice, fleas, and worms.—On man its\r\neffects are capricious. It is frequently used along with other laxatives\r\nagainst obstinate constipation of the bowels, and either in the same\r\nmanner or alone as a remedy for intestinal worms. For these purposes it\r\nhas been at times administered in very large doses, for example in the\r\nquantity of two, three, or four ounces, without any other effect than\r\nbrisk purging. But on the other hand it has sometimes, in much inferior\r\ndoses, induced violent hypercatharsis, or acted severely on the urinary\r\norgans, producing strangury and bloody micturition, or affected the\r\nbrain, producing a state like intoxication, followed by trance for many\r\nhours.[2550] I am not aware that it has ever proved fatal.\r\n\r\n_Oil of tar_, a composite substance obtained by the distillation of\r\nwood-tar, is another pyrogenous fluid of poisonous properties. Messrs.\r\nSlight of Portsmouth have related the case of a seaman, who, after\r\ntaking nearly four ounces by mistake for spirits, was attacked with\r\nfrequent vomiting of a matter having a strong odour of tar, attended\r\nwith excessive pain in the bowels and loins. Nothing was done for his\r\nrelief till about seven hours afterwards, when he was freely bled and\r\npurged, with immediate relief; and next morning he was so better as to\r\nbe able to resume his work. The urine had a strong tarry odour, and for\r\nsome time he suffered from heat in passing it.[2551] A case occurred in\r\nthe London Hospital, in which the symptoms were very different. A lad of\r\neighteen, while intoxicated, took two or three draughts of oil of tar,\r\nalthough aware of its being poisonous. Not long afterwards he became\r\ninsensible, and had laborious, rattling respiration, coldness of the\r\nextremities, suffusion of the conjunctiva, contraction of the pupils,\r\nand an exceedingly feeble pulse. The stomach-pump brought away a liquid\r\nwith an overpowering smell of tar. Stimulants, external as well as\r\ninternal, venesection, and turpentine clysters were of little avail; the\r\ninsensibility continued, with only a short and imperfect interval; and\r\nhe died about twenty-four hours after swallowing the poison. The\r\npulmonary mucous membrane was highly injected, the lungs gorged with\r\nblood and of a tarry odour, the stomach and intestines natural, except\r\nthat the whole _valvulæ conniventes_ were yellow,—the brain and its\r\nmembranes also natural.[2552] It is mentioned in the paper of Messrs.\r\nSlight that a gentleman at Brighton died in consequence of a druggist\r\nusing oil of tar by mistake for something else in making up a\r\nprescription.\r\n\r\n_Creasote_ is another pyrogenous substance possessing considerable\r\nactivity as a poison. It is now extensively used in small doses as a\r\nmedicine for a variety of purposes.\r\n\r\nIt has been made the subject of physiological experiment by various\r\ninquirers, and especially by Dr. Cormach; who found that doses of\r\ntwenty-five or forty drops caused death in a few seconds when injected\r\ninto the jugular vein of a dog, by arresting the heart’s action, and\r\nwithout visibly altering the condition of the blood; that a quantity\r\nsomewhat larger caused only sopor and spasmodic twitches of the muscles,\r\nif injected into the carotid artery, and without proving fatal; that\r\nthirty drops introduced into the stomach of a rabbit excited\r\nconvulsions, acute cries, and death in one minute, apparently from\r\narrestment of the action of the heart; and that the same dose given to a\r\ndog brought on salivation, giddiness, tetanic spasm, a feeble,\r\nfluttering, almost imperceptible pulse, and general insensibility, with\r\ndilated immovable pupils; but recovery took place under the employment\r\nof blood-letting.[2553]—The effects of too large a medicinal dose in man\r\nare pain in the stomach and vomiting, and also, according to Dr.\r\nElliotson, giddiness, headache, and stupor.[2554] Dr. Pereira alludes to\r\na case, mentioned in the Times newspaper, of death caused in 36 hours by\r\ntwo drachms taken at once; and in this instance acute pain in the\r\nabdomen was a prominent symptom.[2555] I presume this is the same case\r\nwhich is mentioned in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal as\r\nhaving occurred at Liverpool.[2556]—The results of Dr. Cormack’s\r\nexperiments on animals lead to the conclusion, that in poisoning with\r\ncreasote, this substance may always be detected in the body, if it has\r\nnot been removed by artificial means a considerable time before death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLII.\r\n                         OF COMPOUND POISONING.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now investigated the three great classes of poisons in their\r\nrelations to physiology, practice of physic, and medical jurisprudence,\r\nit will be necessary to offer a few observations on a subject of\r\nconsiderable medico-legal importance, which has been almost overlooked\r\nin systems of Toxicology,—Compound Poisoning.\r\n\r\nWhen two poisons of different or opposite properties are administered\r\nabout the same time in poisonous doses, the effects of the one may\r\noverpower and prevent the operation of the other, or they may merely\r\nmodify the action of one another. In this manner the usual symptoms\r\nproduced by one or by both may be entirely or in a great measure\r\nwanting; and even in the dead body the usual appearances occasioned by\r\none or both may be modified or perhaps altogether absent.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the course of reading I have met with a sufficient number of\r\ncases of the kind to show that compound poisoning is an object of some\r\nconsequence to the medical jurist, the facts hitherto made public are\r\nnot so numerous as to render a systematic arrangement of them\r\npracticable. The most advisable course, therefore, seems to be merely to\r\ndescribe for the present the cases which have been brought under my\r\nnotice. These are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Poisoning with Arsenic and Alcohol._—A man, after taking twelve\r\nounces of whisky at a debauch, swallowed, an hour afterwards, while in a\r\nstate of excitement, but not particularly drunk, a quantity of arsenic,\r\nthe dose of which could not be ascertained. Fifteen minutes after the\r\narsenic was taken medical aid was procured, upon which repeated attempts\r\nwere made to produce vomiting by means of ipecacuan and sulphate of\r\nzinc, but to no purpose. The stomach-pump was therefore resorted to;\r\nand, after at least an hour had been spent in previous attempts by\r\nemetics, the stomach was cleared of a fluid in which arsenic was\r\nunequivocally detected. No symptom of poisoning with arsenic followed.\r\nAs the man took the arsenic seven hours after a meal, when of course the\r\npowder would at once be brought freely in contact with the villous coat\r\nof the stomach, it must, I think, be inferred, that the operation of the\r\narsenic was impeded or prevented by the narcotism previously induced by\r\nthe ardent spirits. For this case I am indebted to a former pupil, Mr.\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n_Poisoning with Arsenic and Alcohol._—A case of the same description\r\nwith the last, but which proved fatal in consequence of the large\r\nquantity of arsenic taken, has been related by Dr. Wood of Dumfries. A\r\nlad of seventeen, after a night’s debauch, swallowed half an ounce of\r\narsenic early in the morning. In two hours and a half, when Dr. Wood\r\nfirst saw him, there was no symptom of poisoning with arsenic,—no\r\nsymptom at all indeed but languor and drowsiness. A few minutes\r\nafterwards he had slight vomiting, which was repeatedly renewed by\r\nartificial means. For some hours the pulse was but little elevated. In\r\neighteen hours he began to sink, and presented the usual constitutional\r\nsymptoms of poisoning with arsenic; and in forty-one hours he expired.\r\nBut from first to last he had scarcely any local symptom except\r\nvomiting, even although the stomach presented after death signs of\r\nviolent irritation.[2557]\r\n\r\n3. _Poisoning with Tartar-Emetic and Charcoal Fumes._—Under the head of\r\npoisoning with antimony, notice has already been taken of the case of a\r\nman who, after swallowing seventeen grains of tartar-emetic, attempted\r\nto commit suicide by suffocating himself with the fumes of burning\r\ncharcoal. He recovered from both attempts, suffered severely from the\r\nusual narcotic effects of carbonic acid gas, but showed scarcely any\r\nsymptom of the irritant action of tartar-emetic.[2558]\r\n\r\n4. _Poisoning with Alcohol and with Laudanum._—Under the head of\r\npoisoning with opium, allusion has already been made to a remarkable\r\ncase related by Mr. Shearman, where the usual effects of opium were much\r\nretarded in an individual who, at the time of swallowing the opium, was\r\nin a state of excitement from intoxication. For five hours there was no\r\nmaterial stupor. But after that the usual narcotic symptoms supervened\r\nand eventually proved fatal.[2559] The excitement of intoxication,\r\nhowever, has not always the effect of suspending the action of opium;\r\nfor in a case which came under my notice in the Infirmary of this\r\ncity,—that of a woman, who swallowed an ounce and a half of laudanum\r\nwhile much intoxicated,—the usual narcotic symptoms were fully formed in\r\nan hour: and although the stomach-pump was applied soon afterwards, she\r\nexpired in less than five hours from the time the laudanum was\r\nswallowed,—those who had charge of her before she was brought into the\r\nhospital having neglected to use the proper means for keeping her\r\nroused.\r\n\r\n5. _Poisoning with Laudanum and Corrosive Sublimate._—Of all the cases\r\nof compound poisoning I have met with, the most remarkable is an\r\ninstance which occurred in Edinburgh Castle, a few years ago, of\r\npoisoning with laudanum and corrosive sublimate. In this case, the\r\nindividual, a young soldier, swallowed about the same time two drachms\r\nof the latter and half an ounce of the former. He had at first no\r\nviolent symptoms whatever, indicating the operation of corrosive\r\nsublimate; which is an extremely rare occurrence. Afterwards he had\r\nfrequent purging and tenesmus, with bloody stools and all the usual\r\nphenomena of violent dysentery, but no pain of belly, no tenderness even\r\non firm pressure, no vomiting except under the use of emetics. On the\r\nfourth day a violent salivation set in; and under this and the\r\ndysenteric affection he became quickly exhausted, yet not so much, but\r\nthat on the day of his death, the ninth after he took the poison, he was\r\nable to walk a little in his room without assistance. He died on the\r\nclose-stool rather unexpectedly. I have unfortunately lost the original\r\nnotes I had of this case, and have forgotten whether any narcotic\r\nsymptoms were present at first; but my impression is that they were\r\npresent, though in a slight degree only. Most of the previous\r\nparticulars were communicated to me by the late Dr. Mackintosh. The\r\nstomach, duodenum, ileum, colon, and rectum were found after death\r\nenormously inflamed, ulcerated, and here and there almost gangrenous.—In\r\nthis instance some of the corrosive sublimate must have been decomposed\r\nby the laudanum, and an insoluble meconate of mercury formed. But the\r\nquantity thus decomposed could have been but a small proportion of the\r\nwhole,—as was indeed proved by the extensive ravages actually committed\r\nin the whole alimentary canal. I conceive, therefore, that there is no\r\nother way of accounting for the slight apparent effects of the corrosive\r\nsublimate, at the commencement particularly, than by supposing that the\r\nnarcotic operation of the opium veiled or actually retarded the irritant\r\naction of the corrosive sublimate.\r\n\r\n6. _Poisoning with Opium and Belladonna._—A lady, who used a compound\r\ninfusion of opium and belladonna as a wash for an eruption in the vulva,\r\ntook it into her head one day to use the wash as an injection; and\r\nactually received three successive injections, containing each the\r\nactive matter of a scruple of opium and half an ounce of belladonna\r\nleaves. Fortunately none of the three was retained above a few minutes,\r\nexcept the last, which was not discharged for ten minutes. In less than\r\nan hour, she was found in bed in a deep sleep, but the true cause was\r\nnot suspected till three hours later. She was then completely insensible\r\nand motionless, with the face pale, the pupils excessively dilated and\r\nnot contractile, the pulse frequent and small, and the breathing\r\nhurried. After the use of purgative injections, blood-letting, leeches\r\nto the head, and sinapisms to the legs, she began in five hours to show\r\nsome sign of returning consciousness, which improved after a fit of\r\nvomiting. When thoroughly roused, her vision continued dim, the pupils\r\nexcessively dilated, and the ideas somewhat confused. For three days the\r\npulse continued frequent, and the pupils somewhat dilated.[2560] Here\r\nthe opium seems to have prevented the delirium usually induced by\r\nbelladonna in the early stage, while on the other hand the belladonna\r\nprevented the usual effect of opium on the pupils, and actually produced\r\nthe opposite action.\r\n\r\n7. In the following cases, the active poisons to which the individuals\r\nwere exposed were so numerous, that it is impossible to say which or how\r\nmany of them occasioned the symptoms. A colour-maker was superintending\r\na process in which cobalt, arsenic, mercury, sal-ammoniac, and nitric\r\nacid were subjected to heat in a mattrass, when the mattrass suddenly\r\ngave way, and a dense vapour was instantly discharged. The manufacturer,\r\nbefore he could escape, fell down insensible; and though speedily\r\nremoved, he died in no long time, affected with enormous swelling of the\r\nabdomen. A workman who was also present, escaped by a window; but was\r\nnevertheless immediately attacked with swelling of the belly, which\r\nspeedily became very great, and was attended with pain in the jaws, and\r\ndimness of sight. These symptoms were very slowly dissipated under the\r\nuse of cold bathing and purgatives, which brought away an enormous\r\nquantity of fetid gas.[2561]\r\n\r\nThese are not the only examples of compound poisoning which have come\r\nunder my attention. But others I have noticed are not detailed with\r\nsufficient exactness to make it worth while to quote them. The instances\r\ngiven, however, are sufficient to show that poisons of opposite\r\nqualities given about the same time in large doses will disguise one\r\nanother’s effects, or impede, or perhaps even prevent them, in a manner\r\nwhich renders such a combination of circumstances an important subject\r\nof inquiry for the medico-legal toxicologist.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the modifying influence is established in one of two\r\nways,—either by one poison producing a state of venous plethora or\r\ndistension, which impedes, or for a time prevents, the absorption of the\r\nother,—or by one poison producing an insensibility of the membrane with\r\nwhich the other is in contact; so that not only the local injury\r\nactually done has not the usual remote effect on the constitution, or on\r\ndistant organs, but likewise is at times substantially less extensive\r\nthan in ordinary circumstances. These reflexions arise naturally from a\r\nreview of the preceding cases; but of course further facts are necessary\r\nto give them weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n Absorption, its extreme rapidity, 15\r\n\r\n — action of poisons through, 17\r\n\r\n — effect of in removing poisons beyond the reach of analysis, 57\r\n\r\n Acetatæ of lead, tests of, in its pure state, 398\r\n\r\n — — — process for detecting it in organic mixtures, 423\r\n\r\n — — — effects on the animal body.

The figure is a fourth of the natural size.\r\n\r\n  6. Instrument for washing down scanty precipitates on filters. It is a\r\n    thin bottle capable of standing heat—half-filled with water, which\r\n    may be boiled on occasion,—and having its cork pierced with a small\r\n    tube drawn at its outer end to a very fine bore. The breath is\r\n    impelled into the bottle, and, the bottle being then reversed, a\r\n    very fine stream issues with great force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\n  7. Tubes of natural size for collecting small portions of mercury by\r\n    the process, p. 300.\r\n\r\n  8. Pipette, one-fourth the natural size, for removing by suction\r\n    fluids lying over precipitates. Some have a rectangular bend in the\r\n    upper part, by means of which the operator sees better the point of\r\n    the instrument when in action; but such pipettes are difficult to\r\n    clean. That represented in the figure is easily cleaned with a\r\n    feather.\r\n\r\n  9. Apparatus for reducing the sulphurets of some metals by a stream of\r\n    hydrogen. A, the vessel with zinc and diluted sulphuric acid, the\r\n    latter of which may be renewed by the funnel B. C, a ball on the\r\n    emerging tube to prevent the liquid thrown up by the effervescence\r\n    from passing forward. D, E, corks by which C and G are fitted into\r\n    F, the tube which contains the sulphuret at F. G, the exit-tube for\r\n    the sulphuretted-hydrogen, plying into a vessel containing acetate\r\n    of lead. When the hydrogen has passed long enough to expel all the\r\n    air, the spirit-lamp flame is applied at F; and when\r\n    sulphuretted-hydrogen is formed, the lead solution is blackened. The\r\n    figure is one-third the size of the apparatus.\r\n\r\n  For Description of Figures 10 and 11, see p. 212.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Orfila and Ollivier, Archives Générales de Médecine, x. 360.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Philosophical Transactions, 1811, 186.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Experiments on Opium, 1795, reprinted in his Treatise on Fevers, iv.\r\n  697.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Essay on the Operation of poisonous agents on the living body, 1829,\r\n  p. 63.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Edin.

He states that arsenic, which is so fatal to animals in\r\n  general, merely purges dogs and wolves more or less; that nux vomica\r\n  is less fatal to man than to dogs; that pepper is fatal to hogs,\r\n  parsley to parrots, the agrostis arundinacea to goats, elder-berries\r\n  to poultry, chenopodium vulvaria to swine; that on the contrary the\r\n  goat eats with impunity hemlock, daphne gnidium, and some species of\r\n  euphorbia; that the camel eats all species of euphorbia, the hedgehog\r\n  cantharides, the horse monkshood, ranunculus flammula, and buckthorn;\r\n  asses and mules white hellebore, swine yew-berries; all which are\r\n  poisonous to animals in general. He does not state special authorities\r\n  for these facts; but they are taken from authors not of the most\r\n  modern times, and must be received, in my opinion, with great reserve,\r\n  notwithstanding the respect which he claims for the older writers.\r\n  Some of the statements are plainly false.\r\n\r\n  In a more recent paper Virey lays it down as a general principle, that\r\n  poisons from the inorganic kingdom act more or less on the whole\r\n  animated creation, but that vegetable and animal poisons are such only\r\n  in respect to particular animals; that carnivorous animals are more\r\n  sensible to the action of vegetable poisons, but less so to that of\r\n  animal poisons, than herbivorous or graminivorous animals; and that\r\n  the activity of poisons on different animals bears a ratio in the\r\n  first place to their relative sensibility, and secondly, to the\r\n  digestive power of their stomach. I question whether these views will\r\n  be generally admitted by toxicologists, without much more extensive\r\n  and more careful inquiries than any hitherto made. [Journ. de Chim.\r\n  Méd. vii. 214.]\r\n\r\n  Another singular illustration of the facility with which facts are\r\n  admitted in proof of the varying effects of poisons on different\r\n  animals, is a statement by a German naturalist, Dr. Lenz, to the\r\n  effect that the hedgehog altogether resists the most powerful poisons.\r\n  He states that he has seen one receive ten or twelve wounds from a\r\n  viper on the ears, muzzle, and tongue, without sustaining any harm;\r\n  and that ultimately it kills and devours the snake. He quotes Palias\r\n  for the fact that it has taken 100 cantharides flies without injury,\r\n  and says a medical friend who wished to dissect a hedgehog, gave it\r\n  successively hydrocyanic acid, arsenic, opium, and corrosive\r\n  sublimate, without being able to kill it [L’Institut. ii. 84]. His\r\n  countryman Reich, however, contradicts these statements, observing\r\n  that he has poisoned the hedgehog with hydrocyanic acid, arsenic, and\r\n  corrosive sublimate, but that doses considerably larger are required\r\n  for a dog or cat. Ninety grains of medicinal hydrocyanic acid, thirty\r\n  of arsenic, and twenty of corrosive sublimate, occasioned death.\r\n  [Annalen der Pharmacie, i. 358.] One of my colleagues having lately\r\n  quoted Lenz’s assertion in his lectures, some of his pupils brought me\r\n  two hedgehogs to be subjected to experiment. A drop of the pure acid\r\n  put upon the tongue killed each within a minute.\r\n\r\n  The following experiments by Professor Gohier of the veterinary school\r\n  of Lyons are worth mentioning; but in order to be satisfactory would\r\n  require to be performed in a more consecutive train. Muriate of soda\r\n  in the dose of two or three pounds causes in the horse great disorder\r\n  and even death. Calomel has no effect. The juice of rhus toxicodendron\r\n  has no effect on the _solipedes_ either internally or applied to the\r\n  skin. Ten drachms of opium cause in the horse tympanitis and stupor,\r\n  not somnolency. Thirty-six grains of opium had no effect on a dog.\r\n  Cantharides does not injure the horse in the dose of a drachm, or the\r\n  dog in that of nine grains. When the sheep swallows yew-leaves it is\r\n  soon seized with locked-jaw and convulsive movements of the lips and\r\n  flanks: in the horse they cause dilated pupil, convulsive movements of\r\n  the eyes, and restlessness: the goat and dog eat them with impunity\r\n  [Corvisart’s Journal de Médecine, xix. 156]: man is severely affected\r\n  by them. Hyoscyamus, stramonium, hemlock, and other narcotic\r\n  vegetables, though powerfully narcotic to man, will not affect the\r\n  domestic animals unless given in doses 100 times as great as those\r\n  given to man. [Ibid. 154.]\r\n\r\n  The most important researches I have yet seen in this line of inquiry\r\n  are those of Professor Viborg of Copenhagen, read in the Royal Danish\r\n  Society of Sciences in 1792. He instituted a connected series of\r\n  experiments, expressly to determine how far the effects of poisons on\r\n  man correspond with those on the lower animals. The results were, that\r\n  mineral poisons appeared to act nearly in the same manner on all\r\n  orders of animals, antimonial and barytic salts alone excepted, the\r\n  former of which acted powerfully on man, the carnivorous animals, and\r\n  swine, but scarcely at all on ruminating and herbivorous animals,\r\n  while the latter in doses of a drachm had no effect on horses: That\r\n  animal poisons resemble mineral poisons in their leading effects on\r\n  most animals: That the vegetable acrids also act pretty uniformly on\r\n  most animals: and that of the vegetable narcotics there are few which\r\n  possess poisonous properties in regard to certain animals only.\r\n  Yew-leaves kill all ruminating animals, and, notwithstanding Virey’s\r\n  statement, swine, mules, and horses, also chickens; and they produce\r\n  violent symptoms in geese, ducks, cats and dogs, although Gohier says\r\n  dogs eat them with impunity. An ape ate a large quantity of the Æthusa\r\n  cynapium without injury. Dogs took from an ounce and a half to three\r\n  ounces of belladonna without dangerous symptoms. [Marx, die Lehre von\r\n  den Giften,—from Viborg’s Sammlung von Abhandlungen für Thierärzte, i.\r\n  277.]\r\n\r\n  Professor Mayer of Bonn, in an inquiry into the effects of the\r\n  Coriaria myrtifolia, found that rabbits are not affected at all by a\r\n  drachm of the extract of the juice given internally, or applied to a\r\n  wound; while half a drachm swallowed by a cat kills it in a few hours,\r\n  and three grains will have the same effect when introduced into a\r\n  wound. He likewise found that it is a deadly poison to the dog, the\r\n  hawk, and the frog. [Journal der Praktischen Heilkunde, lxviii. 4,\r\n  43.]\r\n\r\n  Professor Giacomini of Padua says, that “in many experiments performed\r\n  by him on dogs and rabbits, he has constantly observed, that the\r\n  former, as being carnivorous by nature, sustain stimulating substances\r\n  tolerably well; while rabbits, being herbivorous, stand stimulants\r\n  ill, but sedatives well.” “Hence many herbivorous animals eat with\r\n  impunity large quantities of vegetable poisons of the sedative kind\r\n  which prove fatal to carnivorous animals.” [Annali Univ. di Med. 1841,\r\n  i. 372.] This may be true as a general rule. But it is not universally\r\n  applicable; for alcoholic fluids kill dogs with great swiftness in no\r\n  great dose.\r\n\r\n  An extraordinary statement was lately brought before the French\r\n  Institute, to the effect that 120 sheep, affected with an epidemic\r\n  pleurisy, got each about 500 grains of arsenic without sustaining the\r\n  slightest harm; and that it was also ascertained to have no poisonous\r\n  action upon sheep even in a state of health. A commission of the\r\n  Institute, however, which was appointed to test this assertion, found\r\n  that healthy sheep were killed by a dose of 155 grains, if they had\r\n  fasted for some time before [Annales d’Hyg. Publ. &c. 1843, xxix.\r\n  468.] It is reasonable to suppose, that ruminating animals, whose\r\n  alimentary canal is scarcely ever empty should suffer less than\r\n  carnivorous animals from such poisons as arsenic.\r\n\r\n  Lassaigne, in some experiments with arsenic, incidentally remarked,\r\n  that 246 grains of solid arsenic given daily for four days had no\r\n  effect whatever on a horse; but that this result seemed to depend on\r\n  the difficulty which the stomach must experience in appropriating it\r\n  among the bulky materials of its food; for 154 grains in solution\r\n  killed the same animal in six hours [Journ. de Chim. Méd. 1841,\r\n  82].—Gianelli of Lucca found that a horse was killed in eight hours by\r\n  185 grains of powder of arsenic given in the form of bolus [Annales\r\n  d’Hyg. Publ. &c. 1842, xxviii. 88].\r\n\r\n  I might easily extend these extracts. But the result would be merely a\r\n  mass of contradiction, from which no sound conclusion could be drawn,\r\n  otherwise the subject would have been discussed in the text.\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  Pyl’s Aufsätze und Beobachtungen, i. 29.\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  Celebrated Trials, vi. 55.\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  Toxicologie Générale, ii. 676.\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  Journal des Progrès des Sciences Médicales, 1827, iv. 124.

Nevertheless, it will be seen\r\n  under the head of morbid appearances caused by the irritant class of\r\n  poisons, that Dr. Bostock’s experiments, though conclusive as to the\r\n  statement in the text, did not affect the real questions in the case.\r\n\r\nFootnote 120:\r\n\r\n  See trial of Freeman—_article_ Hydrocyanic Acid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 121:\r\n\r\n  I have unfortunately mislaid the reference to this interesting fact,\r\n  which was taken, I think, from a French periodical. In this country\r\n  arsenic is never employed for the purpose mentioned in the text.\r\n\r\nFootnote 122:\r\n\r\n  Edinburgh Med. and Surg.

On considering, however, this and other instances\r\n  of the kind which have since come under my notice, I suspect the case\r\n  is rendered intelligible by the effect of sleep in suspending or\r\n  delaying for a time the action of arsenic and other simply irritating\r\n  poisons.

As pyrites\r\n  commonly contains arsenic, the acid becomes adulterated with oxide of\r\n  arsenic, and may communicate the same impregnation to various other\r\n  reagents which are prepared by means of sulphuric acid. The oxide may\r\n  easily be detected in that acid by a stream of hydrosulphuric acid\r\n  gas, after moderate dilution with water; for pure acid is rendered\r\n  milky; but an arsenical acid yields a yellow precipitate of sulphuret\r\n  of arsenic.\r\n\r\nFootnote 516:\r\n\r\n  Journal de Chim.

I have dwelt on them more particularly than may appear\r\n  necessary, because some loose statements on the subject were made in a\r\n  controversy on the occasion of a trial of some note, that of Hannah\r\n  Russell and Daniel Leny, at Lewes Summer Assizes 1826, for the murder\r\n  of the husband of the former. Arsenic was decidedly detected in the\r\n  stomach, and it was proved that the deceased did not live above three\r\n  hours after the only meal at which the prisoners could have\r\n  administered the poison. Now during the controversy which arose after\r\n  the execution of one of the prisoners, it was alleged by one of the\r\n  parties, among other reasons for believing arsenic not to have been\r\n  the cause of death, that this poison never proves fatal so soon as in\r\n  three hours,—that Sir Astley Cooper and Mr. Stanley of London had\r\n  never known a case prove fatal in less than seven hours—and that Dr.\r\n  Male’s case mentioned above is the shortest on record. The instances\r\n  quoted above overthrow this whole line of statement. It was mentioned\r\n  by Mr. Evans, the chief crown witness, but I know not on what\r\n  authority, that, on the trial of Samuel Smith for poisoning, held at\r\n  Warwick Summer Assizes 1826, the deceased was proved to have expired\r\n  in two hours after taking a quarter of an ounce of arsenic. I have\r\n  examined with some care the documents in the Lewes case, which were\r\n  obligingly communicated to me by Mr. Evans; and I have been quite\r\n  unable to discover any reason for questioning the reality of\r\n  poisoning, or for the ferment which it seems the subsequent\r\n  controversy excited. The case seems to have been satisfactorily made\r\n  out by Mr. Evans in the first instance; and no sound medical jurist\r\n  would for a moment suffer a shadow of doubt to be thrown over his mind\r\n  by the criticisms of Mr. Evans’s antagonist.\r\n\r\nFootnote 637:\r\n\r\n  Die Wirkung der Arzneimittel und Gifte, i. 271.\r\n\r\nFootnote 638:\r\n\r\n  London Medical Repository, ii. 270.\r\n\r\nFootnote 639:\r\n\r\n  Edinburgh Med. and Surg.

In distilled water\r\n  containing a 35,000th of anhydrous _phosphate of soda_, three lead\r\n  rods, which weighed together 73·949 grains, became in thirty-two days\r\n  73·946; and in a comparative experiment with a solution containing a\r\n  27,000th they gained 0·015.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1241:\r\n\r\n  Sometimes, however, a minute trace of white powder is attached to the\r\n  bottom of the glass wherever the lead touches it. This is carbonate of\r\n  lead at first, and afterwards a mixture like that described in the\r\n  text.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1242:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Morson in Pharmaceutic Journal, ii. 355.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1243:\r\n\r\n  On Spring Waters, p. 23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1244:\r\n\r\n  Tronchin de Col.

The Voirie et Chantier\r\n  d’Ecarrissage of Montfaucon, which has existed close to the walls of\r\n  Paris for several centuries, is an enclosure of many acres, where the\r\n  contents of the necessaries of the city are collected in enormous\r\n  pits, and where horses, dogs, and cats are flayed to the amount of\r\n  forty or fifty thousand annually. The fat is melted for blowpipe\r\n  lamps; the bones are in a great measure burnt on the premises for\r\n  fuel; the intestines are made into coarse gut for machinery; the\r\n  flesh, blood, and garbage are heaped to putrefy for manure; and in\r\n  summer a bed of compost is spread to breed maggots for feeding\r\n  poultry. There is no drain. Description cannot convey an idea of the\r\n  stench. The committee of the Board of Health, appointed to make\r\n  inquiries into the best mode of abating the nuisance, in vain\r\n  attempted to penetrate into the place. Yet the workmen and their\r\n  families are stout, healthy, and long lived.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1557:\r\n\r\n  Des Chantiers d’Ecarrissage. Annales d’Hyg. Publ. et de Méd. Lég.\r\n  viii. 139.

[1843, ii. 253], has attacked in\r\n  no very measured terms this opinion of Professor Buchner and myself.\r\n  But, although he professes to give a literal translation of the\r\n  passage above, he has translated it so incorrectly as wholly to\r\n  misrepresent our opinion. The close of the paragraph, “chemical\r\n  analysis must often fail to detect opium where there could be no doubt\r\n  of its _having been administered_ in large quantity,” is rendered into\r\n  French by the Parisian Professor in these words,—“l’analyse chimique,\r\n  propre à constater l’existence de l’opium, est souvent inutile, même\r\n  dans le cas _ou il existe_ une grande quantité de cette\r\n  substance,”—which is a very different proposition. Orfila clearly\r\n  overrates the utility of the process for detecting opium, both in this\r\n  criticism and in his whole observations on the subject, by losing\r\n  sight of the tendency of absorption to remove the poison beyond reach.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1691:\r\n\r\n  Bombay Med.

This fact, however,\r\n  does not exactly touch the question. The reddening must be occasioned,\r\n  not in the crude fluid, but with a substance obtained by the process\r\n  of analysis for detecting meconic acid in complex organic\r\n  mixtures,—otherwise the proposition in the text stands good.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1695:\r\n\r\n  Experiments on Opium.

Med. Gazette, viii. 577]. I have\r\n  nevertheless thought it right to retain my original statement of the\r\n  evidence, as it was derived from what I still consider the best\r\n  authority,—the medical witness, who mentions the special fact on which\r\n  he founded the most important, indeed the only important professional\r\n  opinion in the case, and to which therefore his attention must have\r\n  been more pointedly turned than that of any Law-Reporter.

For in the\r\n  numerous experiments I have made and witnessed in animals, flaccidity\r\n  invariably took place at the time of death, and continued for a\r\n  moderate interval.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2355:\r\n\r\n  Repertorium für die Pharmacie, lxv. 80.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2356:\r\n\r\n  Le Globe, vii. 525.—Août 19, 1829.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2357:\r\n\r\n  Henke’s Zeitschrift für die Staatsarzneikunde, ii. 169.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2358:\r\n\r\n  Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. xxvi. 44.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2359:\r\n\r\n  Orfila, Toxicol.
