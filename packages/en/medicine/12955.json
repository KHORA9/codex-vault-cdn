LOUIS ARNER, Ph.D.\r\n_University Fellow in Sociology_\r\n\r\n\r\n1908\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis monograph does not claim to treat exhaustively, nor to offer a\r\nfinal solution of all the problems which have been connected with the\r\nmarriage of kin. The time has not yet come for a final work on the\r\nsubject, for the systematic collection of the necessary statistics,\r\nwhich can only be done by governmental authority, has never been\r\nattempted. The statistics which have been gathered, and which are\r\npresented in the following pages, are fragmentary, and usually bear\r\nupon single phases of the subject, but taken together they enable us\r\nbetter to understand many points which have long been in dispute.\r\n\r\nThe need for statistics of the frequency of occurrence of\r\nconsanguineous marriages has been strongly felt by many far-sighted\r\nmen. G.H. Darwin and A.H. Huth have tried unsuccessfully to have the\r\nsubject investigated by the British Census, and Dr. A.G. Bell has\r\nrecently urged that the United States Census make such an\r\ninvestigation.[1] Another motive for undertaking this present work,\r\naside from the desire to study the problems already referred to, has\r\nbeen to test the widely prevalent theory that consanguinity is a\r\nfactor in the determination of sex, the sole basis of which seems to\r\nbe the Prussian birth statistics of Düsing, which are open to other\r\ninterpretations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cf. Bell, \"A Few Thoughts Concerning Eugenics.\" In\r\n_National Geographic Magazine_, March, 1908.]\r\n\r\nThe stock illustrations from isolated communities have been omitted as\r\ntoo difficult to verify, and little space has been given to the\r\nresults of the inbreeding of domestic animals, for although such\r\nresults are of great value to Biology, they are not necessarily\r\napplicable to the human race.\r\n\r\nThe writer regrets that it is impossible here to acknowledge all his\r\nobligations to those who have assisted him in the preparation of this\r\nwork. Such acknowledgement is due to the many genealogists and other\r\nfriends who have kindly furnished detailed cases of consanguineous\r\nmarriage. For more general data the writer is especially indebted to\r\nDr. Alexander Graham Bell, to Dr. Martin W. Barr, to Professor William\r\nH. Brewer of Yale University, and to Dr. Lee W. Dean of the University\r\nof Iowa. In the preparation of the manuscript the suggestions and\r\ncriticisms of Professors Franklin H. Giddings and Henry L. Moore have\r\nbeen invaluable.\r\n\r\nG.B.L.A.\r\n\r\nMARCH, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nProblems to be Treated--Degrees of Consanguinity--Literature of the\r\nSubject--Noah Webster--Bemiss--Dally--G.H.

The\r\nproblems to be considered are not only those which relate primarily to\r\nthe individual and secondarily to the race, such as the supposed\r\neffect of blood relationship in the parents upon the health and\r\ncondition of the offspring; but also the effect, if any, which such\r\nmarriages have upon the birth-rate, upon the proportion of the sexes\r\nat birth, and the most fundamental problem of all, the relative\r\nfrequency with which consanguineous marriages take place in a given\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nNo thorough and systematic study of the subject has ever been made,\r\nand could not be made except through the agency of the census. The\r\nstatistical material here brought together is fragmentary and not\r\nentirely satisfactory, but it is sufficient upon which to base some\r\ngeneralizations of scientific value. The sources of these data are\r\nlargely American. Little attempt is made to study European material,\r\nor to discuss phases of the problem which are only of local concern.\r\nSome topics, therefore, which have frequently been treated in\r\nconnection with the general subject of consanguineous marriages are\r\nhere ignored as having no scientific interest, as for instance that of\r\nthe so-called \"marriages of affinity,\" which has been so warmly\r\ndebated for the past fifty years in the British Parliament.\r\n\r\nFor obvious reasons it will often be impossible to distinguish between\r\nthe different degrees of consanguinity, but wherever possible the\r\ndegree will be specified. It is probable that where a number of\r\nmarriages are vaguely given as consanguineous, few are more distant\r\nthan second cousins, for in the United States especially, distant\r\nrelationships are rarely traced except by genealogists. In designating\r\ndegrees of relationship the common terminology will be used, as in the\r\nfollowing table, expressing, however, the rather clumsy expression,\r\n\"first cousin once removed\" by the simpler form \"1-1/2 cousin.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBy far the greater part of the literature of consanguineous marriage\r\nis of a controversial rather than of a scientific nature, and a search\r\nfor statistical evidence for either side of the discussion reveals\r\nsurprisingly little that is worthy of the name. Yet men of high\r\nscientific standing have repeatedly made most dogmatic assertions in\r\nregard to the results of such unions, and have apparently assumed that\r\nno proof was necessary. For example, Sir Henry Sumner Maine \"cannot\r\nsee why the men who discovered the use of fire, and selected the wild\r\nforms of certain animals for domestication and of vegetables for\r\ncultivation, should not find out that children of unsound constitution\r\nwere born of nearly related parents.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Maine, _Early Law and Custom_, p. 228.]\r\n\r\nMuch space is given to the alleged \"innate horror of incest,\" and\r\nfrequent appeals are made to Scripture, wrongly assuming that the\r\nmarriage of cousins is prohibited in the Mosaic Law.\r\n\r\nThe origin of \"prohibited degrees\" is only conjectural. The Christian\r\nChurch apparently borrowed its prohibitory canons from the Roman\r\nLaw,[3] and a dispensation is still necessary before a Catholic can\r\nmarry his first cousin. However, such dispensations have always been\r\neasy to obtain, especially by royal families, and even the marriage of\r\nuncle and niece sometimes occurs, as among the Spanish Habsburgs, and\r\nas recently as 1889 in the House of Savoy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Luckock, _History of Marriage_, p. 282.]\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of the marriage of first cousins was removed in\r\nEngland by the Marriage Act of 1540,[4] but by this time the idea of\r\nthe harmfulness of kinship marriage was so thoroughly impressed upon\r\nthe people that they were very prone to look askance at such unions,\r\nand if they were followed by any defective progeny, the fact would be\r\nnoted, and looked upon as a chastisement visited upon the parents for\r\ntheir sin. Naturally the idea became proverbial, and in some places it\r\nhas influenced the civil law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Child, \"On Marriages of Consanguinity,\" in\r\n_Medico-Chirurgical Review_, April, 1862, p. 469.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first printed discussion of the subject in America is from\r\nthe pen of Noah Webster, in an essay which should be as interesting to\r\nthe spelling reformer as to the sociologist.[5] He writes: \"It iz no\r\ncrime for brothers and sisters to intermarry, except the fatal\r\nconsequences to society; for were it generally practised, men would\r\nbecome a race of pigmies. It iz no crime for brothers' and sisters'\r\nchildren to intermarry, and this iz often practised; but such near\r\nblood connections often produce imperfect children. The common peeple\r\nhav hence drawn an argument to proov such connections criminal;\r\nconsidering weakness, sickness and deformity in the offspring az\r\njudgements upon the parents. Superstition iz often awake when reezon\r\niz asleep.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Webster, _Collection of Essays and Fugitiv Writings on\r\nMoral, Historical, Political and Religious Subjects_, 1790, p. 322.]\r\n\r\nFrom about 1855 to 1880 much was written about the effect of\r\nconsanguineal interbreeding. One of the first contributions came from\r\nAmerica. In 1858 Dr. S.M. Bemiss, of Louisville, Kentucky, reported to\r\nthe American Medical Association the results of his investigation of\r\n833 cases of consanguineous marriage.[6] His compilation remains to\r\nthis day the largest single piece of direct statistical work on the\r\nsubject. Unfortunately, however, his statistics have a strong, if\r\nunintentional, bias which seriously affects their value. In France one\r\nof the earliest discussions was by M. Boudin,[7] who evidently\r\nobtained the Bemiss report (attributing it to Dr. O.W. Morris, who had\r\nquoted freely from Bemiss),[8] and enlarged greatly upon its\r\nfallacies. He also collected statistics of the deaf-mutes in Paris,\r\nand, by an amazing manipulation of figures, \"demonstrated\" that\r\nconsanguinity of the parents was the cause of nearly one-third of the\r\ncases of congenital deafness. The savants of the Société\r\nd'Anthropologie took sides and the debate became very entertaining.\r\nFinally M. Dally came to the rescue, and published some very sane and\r\nlogical articles which avoided both extremes, and first advanced the\r\ntheory that any ill effects of consanguineous marriage should be\r\nattributed to the intensification of inherited characteristics.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: See _Transactions of the American Medical Association_,\r\n1858, pp. 321-425.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: \"Du Croisement des families,\" _Mem. de la Société\r\nd'Anthropologie_, vol. i, 1860-63, pp. 505-557.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: See Morris: \"On Marriages of Consanguinity,\" in _Amer.\r\nMed. Times_, Mar. 23, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: See _Bulletins de la Société d'Anthropologie_, 1863, pp.\r\n515-575; 1877, pp. 203-213.]\r\n\r\nIn England similar discussions took place during the same period,\r\ncomplicated, however, by the presence of the patient and\r\nlong-suffering \"deceased wife's sister.\" The best of the English work\r\nhas been the statistical study by George H. Darwin,[10] and the\r\nclassic \"Marriage of Near Kin\" by Alfred H. Huth, a book of 475 pages,\r\nincluding a very complete bibliography to the date of the second\r\nedition, 1885. Although Mr. Huth's book is not free from error, and is\r\nencumbered with a large amount of worthless material, it is now after\r\nthirty-three years, by far the best treatment of the subject.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: \"Marriages of First Cousins in England and their\r\nEffects,\" _Journal Statistical Society_, 1875, pp. 153-184.]\r\n\r\nIn Italy Dr. Montegazza,[11] in Spain Señor Pastor[12] and others,\r\nhave made useful contributions. German writers have usually preferred\r\nmore general subjects, but many of them have given much space to\r\nconsanguineous marriage in sociological and biological works.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Studj Sui Matrimonj Consanguinei_. Quoted by Darwin,\r\nop. cit., p. 178.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: \"De los Matrimonios entre Parientes,\" Memorias _de la\r\nReal Academia de Ciencias Morales y Políticas_, vol. ii, pp. 369-400.]\r\n\r\nSince the appearance of the Bemiss report little has been published in\r\nthis country which bears directly upon our subject. The most important\r\nAmerican contribution, however, is to be found in the Special Report\r\non the Blind and the Deaf, in the Twelfth Census of the United States,\r\nprepared by Dr. Alexander Graham Bell. Although American writers have\r\nhad little part in the theoretical discussions, our legislators have\r\nbeen active, so that the statutes of every state specify degrees of\r\nkinship within which marriage is prohibited. In at least sixteen\r\nstates the prohibition is extended to include first cousins. In New\r\nHampshire such marriages are void and the children are illegitimate.\r\nOther states in which first-cousin marriage is forbidden are\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Kansas, North Dakota,\r\nSouth Dakota, Wyoming, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Missouri, Arkansas,\r\nand Louisiana. Since both Oklahoma and Indian Territory had similar\r\nlaws, the present State of Oklahoma should probably be added to this\r\nlist. In all of these states marriages within the prohibited degrees\r\nare incestuous or void or both, except in Ohio, where no express\r\ndeclaration is made in the statute. In Ohio, Indiana, Nevada and\r\nWashington the law is made to read: \"and not nearer of kin than\r\n_second cousins_,\" therefore including \"1-1/2 cousins\" within the\r\nprohibited degrees. In many states the marriage of step relatives is\r\nforbidden, as also marriage with a mother-in-law or father-in-law. Of\r\nthe territories, Arizona, Alaska, and Porto Rico forbid the marriage\r\nof first cousins, but in Porto Rico the court may waive the\r\nimpediment.\r\n\r\nThese laws probably have some effect in reducing the number of\r\nconsanguineous marriages in these states, but the sentiment back of\r\nthe law is more responsible for the decrease in the number of such\r\nunions than the law itself. For in the nature of things enforcement\r\nwould be very difficult, and apparently little real effort is made in\r\nthat direction. In Ohio, and probably elsewhere, the question as to\r\nconsanguinity is not directly put to the applicants for a marriage\r\nlicense. The applicants are required to answer the usual questions in\r\nregard to age, parentage, residence, etc., and are then required to\r\nswear that their previous statements have been correct and that\r\nneither of them is \"epileptic, imbecile or insane,\" that they are \"not\r\nnearer of kin than second cousins, and not at the time under the\r\ninfluence of any intoxicating liquor or narcotic drug.\" Undoubtedly\r\nviolations of the consanguinity clause are very frequent, and it is\r\nlikewise easily evaded by going to another state where the laws are\r\nmore liberal. One effect of the law is to provide a painless method of\r\nsevering the marriage bond. A correspondent, who is a District Court\r\nJudge in Kansas, in reporting a case of first cousin marriage, adds\r\nthat he \"divorced them on the ground of consanguinity.\"\r\n\r\nIn the absence of direct investigation by the Census Bureau, or other\r\npublic records of consanguineous marriages, perhaps the most promising\r\nfield for research is in the genealogical records of American\r\nfamilies. Several thousand volumes of such material have been\r\npublished within the last half-century, and a large number of these\r\nare very carefully and scientifically prepared. The material gathered\r\nfrom such sources is very accurate in regard to the number of births,\r\nyouthful deathrate etc., but mental or physical defects are rarely\r\nmentioned. The greatest objection to the utilization of this material,\r\nhowever, is the amount of labor necessary in order to glean the\r\ndesired facts from the mass of irrelevant data. For example, in order\r\nto find one case of first cousin marriage it is necessary on an\r\naverage, to examine the records of nearly two hundred other marriages.\r\n\r\nThe collection of data from personal sources is likewise open to grave\r\nobjections. Not only is the informant likely to be biassed, but the\r\ncases which he will remember will be those in which something unusual\r\nhas occurred. Herein lay the fallacy in the conclusions of Dr. Bemiss.\r\nI have endeavored to overcome this bias by restricting my requests\r\nfor information to genealogists and others who would more naturally\r\nappeal to records, but my efforts have been only partially successful.\r\n\r\nThe number of cases of consanguineous marriage, embracing all degrees\r\nof consanguinity, which I have collected from these two sources,\r\ngenealogies and correspondence, is 723, a number too small in itself\r\nto establish any definite conclusions; but by using this material in\r\nconnection with other related data, I trust I may be able to add\r\nsomething to the comparatively small amount of real knowledge which\r\nthe world already possesses in regard to the marriage of kin.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my investigations I visited Smith's Island, in the\r\nChesapeake Bay, about twelve miles across Tangier Sound, from\r\nCrisfield, Maryland, and nearly opposite the mouth of the Potomac.\r\nHere is a community of about seven hundred people, who are principally\r\nengaged in the sea-food industry. Their ancestors have lived on the\r\nisland for many generations and there have been comparatively few\r\naccessions to the population from the mainland. As a natural\r\nconsequence the population is largely a genetic aggregation.\r\nConsanguineous marriages have been very frequent, until now nearly all\r\nare more or less interrelated. Out of a hundred or more families of\r\nwhich I obtained some record, at least five marriages were between\r\nfirst cousins. All of these were fertile, and all the children were\r\nliving and apparently healthy. Since over thirty per cent of the\r\ninhabitants bear one surname (Evans), and those bearing the first four\r\nsurnames in point of frequency (Evans, Brad-shaw, Marsh, and Tyler)\r\ncomprise about fifty-nine per cent of the population, it will readily\r\nbe seen that comparatively few absolutely non-related marriages take\r\nplace. Yet in this community from September, 1904, to October, 1907,\r\nor during the residence there of the present physician, Dr. P.H.\r\nTawes, there have been 87 births and but 30 deaths, the latter from\r\nthe usual causes. During this period there has not been a single case\r\nof idiocy, insanity, epilepsy, deaf-mutism or even of typhoid fever on\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nThe evidence gathered from various other isolated communities is very\r\nconflicting. Huth describes a great many of them which have existed\r\nfor many generations without crosses without ill results. Other\r\nwriters quote instances where whole communities have become\r\ndegenerate. Until the antecedents of a community are known it is of\r\ncourse impossible to estimate the effect of consanguinity. The\r\nexceptionally high percentage of deaf-mutism on Martha's Vineyard may\r\nto some extent be due to a high percentage of consanguineous marriage,\r\nbut that inbreeding is not the primary cause is revealed by the\r\nrecords showing that among the first settlers were two deaf-mutes,\r\nwhose defect has been inherited from generation to generation for two\r\nhundred and fifty years.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: See article in Cincinnati _Gazette_, Jan. 22, 1895.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nRATIO OF THE CONSANGUINEOUS TO ALL MARRIAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards determining the average frequency of occurrence of\r\nconsanguineous marriages, or the proportion which such marriages bear\r\nto the whole number of marriages, little has as yet been done in this\r\ncountry. Professor Richmond Mayo-Smith estimated that marriages\r\nbetween near kin constituted less than one per cent of the total,[14]\r\nand Dr. Lee W. Dean estimates that in Iowa they comprise only about\r\none half of one per cent.[15] But these estimates are little more than\r\nguesses, without any statistical basis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Statistics and Sociology_, p. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Effect of Consanguinity upon the Organs of Special\r\nSense_, p. 4.]\r\n\r\nIn several European countries such marriages have been registered,\r\nthough somewhat spasmodically and inaccurately. According to\r\nMulhall[16] the ratio of the consanguineous among 10,000 marriages in\r\nthe various countries is as follows:\r\n\r\n              TABLE I.\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nCountry.| Ratio. | Country.| Ratio.\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nPrussia |  67    | Alsace  |  107\r\nItaly   |  69    | France  |  126\r\nEngland |  75    | Jews    |  230\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Dictionary of Statistics_, p. 383.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Uchermann the ratio is 690 or 6.9 per cent, including\r\nmarriages between second cousins and nearer.[17] Dr. Peer says that 4\r\nper cent of the marriages in Saxony are consanguineous.[18] The ratio\r\nseems to be increasing in France but diminishing in Alsace and Italy,\r\nas indicated in Table II.[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Les Sourds-muets en Norvège_. Quoted by Feer, p. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _Der Einfluss der Blutsverwandschaft der Eltern auf die\r\nKinder_, p. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Mulhall, _Dictionary of Statistics_, p. 383.]\r\n\r\n                       TABLE II.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\nCountry.| Date.  |Ratio.[A]| Country.|  Date.  |Ratio.[A]\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\nFrance  | 1853-60|  97     | France  | 1861-71 |  126\r\nAlsace  | 1858-65| 143     | Alsace  | 1872-75 |  107\r\nItaly   | 1868-71|  84     | Italy   | 1872-75 |   69\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  [A] Per 10,000.\r\n\r\nIn Italy the ratio varies greatly in different parts of the country.\r\nMulhall gives the following figures for the years 1872-75:\r\n\r\n               TABLE III.\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nProvince.| Ratio.[A]| Province.| Ratio.[A]\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nVenice   |  24      | Sicily   |  117\r\nNaples   |  30      | Piedmont |  131\r\nLombardy | 100      | Liguria  |  183\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n  [A] Per 10,000.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the lowest ratios are in provinces where the\r\nurban population is comparatively large. Wherever statistics have been\r\ngathered it is the rule that the percentage of consanguineous marriage\r\nis greater in rural than in urban districts. Table IV, also from\r\nMulhall, illustrates this point.\r\n\r\n                  TABLE IV.\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n                   |_Ratio per 10,000 Marriages_.\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nCountry.             | Rural.| Urban. |  General.\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nEngland              |  79   |   71   |      75\r\nFrance               | 130   |  115   |     126\r\nAlsace               | 121   |   41   |     107\r\nNorway[A] (Uchermann)| 810   |  260   |     690\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n  [A] Includes second cousins.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the degree of consanguinity, it seems very probable that\r\nin the French, German, Italian, and English statistics and estimates\r\nfew if any marriages beyond the degree of first cousins are returned\r\nas consanguineous, so in order to compare the Norwegian figures with\r\nthe others they should probably be reduced by one half. Out of 1549\r\nconsanguineous marriages contracted in Prussia in 1889, 1422 were\r\nbetween \"cousins\" (probably first), 110 between uncles and nieces, and\r\n16 between nephews and aunts.[20] The ratio of such marriages to\r\n10,000 in France during the fifteen years ending in 1875 was:[21]\r\n\r\n                         TABLE V.\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n  Degree.        |  Urban.| Rural.| All France.\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nNephew and aunt  |   1.6  |   2.4 |    2.1\r\nUncle and niece  |   6.0  |   5.6 |    5.8\r\n\"Cousins\"        |  96.0  | 119.0 |  113.1\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nTotal            | 103.6  | 127.0 |  121.2\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Mulhall, op. cit., p. 383.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Ibid., p. 384.]\r\n\r\nIn Italy during seven years ending in 1874, of all consanguineous\r\nmarriages 92 per cent were of cousins and 8 per cent were of uncle and\r\nniece or aunt and nephew.[22]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Ibid., p. 384.]\r\n\r\nDally[23] is very skeptical about the accuracy of the French figures,\r\nbut says that in Paris the records are well kept. He found that in the\r\nyears 1853-62 there were 10,765 marriages in the _8me arrondissement_\r\nof Paris, and of these he finds:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nMarriages between cousins-german  | 141\r\nMarriages between uncle and niece |   8\r\nMarriages between aunt and nephew |   1\r\nTotal consanguineous              | 150\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: \"Recherches sur les Mariages Consanguins et sur les\r\nRaces Pures.\" in _Bulletins de la Société d'Anthropologie_, 1863, p.\r\n527.]\r\n\r\nThis is rather higher than the average for urban districts, according\r\nto official figures, but Dally seems to consider it as typical. He\r\ngives examples of the carelessness and incompetency of the rural\r\nrecord keepers, and insists that the percentage is really much higher\r\nthan the official figures would indicate. He estimates the\r\nconsanguineous marriages in France not including second cousins, at\r\nfrom four to five per cent.\r\n\r\nA very ingenious method of determining the approximate number of\r\nfirst-cousin marriages was devised by Mr. George H. Darwin.[24]\r\nNoticing that in marriage announcements, some were between persons of\r\nthe same surname, it occurred to him that there might be a constant\r\nratio between same-name marriages and first cousin marriages. Some\r\nsame-name marriages would of course be purely adventitious; so, to\r\neliminate this element of chance, he obtained from the Registrar\r\nGeneral's Report the frequency of occurrence of the various surnames\r\nin England. The fifty commonest names embraced 18 per cent of the\r\npopulation. One person in every 73 was a Smith, one in every 76 a\r\nJones and so on. Then the probability of a Smith-Smith marriage due to\r\nmere chance would be 1/73^2 and of a Jones-Jones marriage 1/76^2.\r\nThe sum of fifty such fractions he found to be .0009207 or .9207 per\r\nthousand. After the fiftieth name the fractions were so small as to\r\nhave comparatively little effect upon the total. He therefore\r\nconcluded that about one marriage in a thousand takes place, in which\r\nthe parties have the same surname and have been uninfluenced by any\r\nrelationship between them bringing them together.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: \"Marriages between First Cousins in England and their\r\nEffects,\" in _Journal of the Statistical Society_, June, 1875. pp. 154\r\n_et seq_.]\r\n\r\nThe next step was to count the marriages announced in the \"_Pall Mall\r\nGazette_\" for the years 1869-72 and a part of 1873. Of the 18,528\r\nmarriages there found, 232 or 1.25 per cent were between persons of\r\nthe same surname. Deducting the percentage of chance marriages at\r\nleast 1.15 per cent were probably influenced directly or indirectly by\r\nconsanguinity.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin then proceeded by a purely genealogical method. He found\r\nthat out of 9,549 marriages recorded in \"Burke's _Landed Gentry_,\" 144\r\nor 1.5 per cent were between persons of the same surname, and exactly\r\nhalf of these were first cousins. In the \"_English and Irish Peerage_\"\r\nout of 1,989 marriages, 18 or .91 per cent were same-name first cousin\r\nmarriages. He then sent out about 800 circulars to members of the\r\nupper middle class, asking for records of first cousin marriage among\r\nthe near relatives of the person addressed, and obtained the following\r\nresult:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nSame-name first cousin marriages      |   66\r\nDifferent-name first cousin marriages |  182\r\nSame-name not first cousin marriages  |   29\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThese cases furnished by correspondents he calculated to be 3.41 per\r\ncent of all marriages in the families to which circulars were sent.\r\n\r\nFrom the data collected from all these sources Mr. Darwin obtains the\r\nfollowing proportion:\r\n\r\nSame-name first cousin marriages     142\r\n--------------------------------  =  ---  = .57\r\n    All same-name marriages          249\r\n\r\nHe is inclined to think that the ratio should be lower and perhaps .50\r\ninstead of .57. By a similar line of reasoning he obtains this\r\nproportion:\r\n\r\n  Same-name first cousin marriages        1\r\n-------------------------------------  = ---\r\nDifferent-name first cousin marriages     3\r\n\r\nHere too, he fears that the denominator is too small, for by\r\ntheoretical calculation he obtains by one method the ratio 2/7, and\r\nby another 1/1. He finally takes 1/4 for this factor. To express the\r\nproportion in another form:\r\n\r\nSame-name first cousin marriages     1\r\n--------------------------------  = ---\r\n   All first cousin marriages        5\r\n\r\nThe completed formula then becomes:\r\n\r\n  All same-name marriages     100     1\r\n-------------------------- = ----- X ---  =  .35 (nearly)\r\nAll first cousin marriages     57     5\r\n\r\nApplying this formula to the English statistics, Mr. Darwin computes\r\nthe percentages of first cousin marriages in England with the\r\nfollowing results:\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nLondon                         |  1.5\r\nOther urban districts          |  2.\r\nRural districts                |  2.25\r\nMiddle class and Landed Gentry |  3.5\r\nAristocracy                    |  4.5\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn order to apply this formula to the American population I counted\r\nthe names in the New York Marriage License Record previous to\r\n1784,[25] and found the number to be 20,396, representing 10,198\r\nmarriages. The fifty commonest names embraced nearly 15 per cent of\r\nthe whole (1526), or three per cent less than the number found by\r\nDarwin.[26] Of these, one in every 53 was a Smith, one in 192 a\r\nLawrence, and so on. The sum of the fraction 1/53^2, 1/192^2,\r\netc., I found to be .000757 or .757 per thousand, showing that the\r\nprobability of a chance marriage between persons of the same name was\r\neven less than in England, where Mr. Darwin considered it almost a\r\nnegligible quantity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: _Names of Persons for whom Marriage Licenses were issued\r\nby the Secretary of the Province of New York_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Cf. supra_, p. 21.]\r\n\r\nOf these 10,198 marriages, 211, or 2.07 per cent were between persons\r\nbearing the same surname. Applying Darwin's formula we would have 5.9\r\nas the percentage of first cousin marriages in colonial New York.\r\nThis figure is evidently much too high, so in the hope of finding the\r\nfallacy, I worked out the formula entirely from American data. To\r\navoid the personal equation which would tend to increase the number of\r\nsame-name first cousin marriages at the expense of the same-name not\r\nfirst cousin marriages, I took only those marriages obtained from\r\ngenealogies, which would be absolutely unbiassed in this respect. Out\r\nof 242 marriages between persons of the same name, 70 were between\r\nfirst cousins, giving the proportion:\r\n\r\nSame-name first cousin marriages    70\r\n-------------------------------- = ---  = .285\r\n  All same-name marriages          242\r\n\r\nas compared with Darwin's .57. So that we may be fairly safe in\r\nassuming that not more than 1/3 of all same-name marriages are first\r\ncousin marriages. Taking data from the same sources and eliminating as\r\nfar as possible those genealogies in which only the male line is\r\ntraced, we have it:\r\n\r\n  Same-name first cousin marriages      24      1          1\r\n------------------------------------- = -- = -------- = -------\r\nDifferent-name first cousin marriages   62   (2-7/12)    2.583\r\n\r\nThis is near the ratio which Darwin obtained from his data, and which\r\nhe finally changed to 1/4. I am inclined to think that his first ratio\r\nwas nearer the truth, for since we have found that the coefficient of\r\nattraction between cousins would be so much greater than between\r\nnon-relatives, why should we not assume that the attraction between\r\ncousins of the same surname should exceed that between cousins of\r\ndifferent surnames? For among a large number of cousins a person is\r\nlikely to be thrown into closer contact, and to feel better acquainted\r\nwith those who bear the same surname with himself. But since the\r\ntheoretical ratio would be about 1/4 it would hardly be safe to put\r\nthe probable ratio higher than 1/3, or in other words four first\r\ncousin marriages to every same-name first cousin marriage. Our\r\nrevised formula then is:\r\n\r\nAll same-name marriages        3     1\r\n--------------------------- = --- X --- = .75\r\nAll first cousin marriages     1     4\r\n\r\nInstead of Mr. Darwin's .35.\r\n\r\nTaking then the 10,198 marriages, with their 2.07 per dent of\r\nsame-name marriages, and dividing by .75 we have 2.76 per cent, or 281\r\nfirst cousin marriages.\r\n\r\nIn order to arrive at approximately the percentage of first cousin\r\nmarriages in a nineteenth-century American community I counted the\r\nmarriage licenses in Ashtabula County, Ohio, for seventy-five years,\r\n(1811-1886). Out of 13,309 marriages, 112 or .84 per cent were between\r\npersons of the same surname. Applying the same formula as before, we\r\nfind 1.12 per cent of first cousin marriages, or less than half the\r\npercentage found in eighteenth-century New York. This difference may\r\neasily be accounted for by the comparative newness of the Ohio\r\ncommunity, in which few families would be interrelated, and also to\r\nthat increasing ease of communication which enables the individual to\r\nhave a wider circle of acquaintance from which to choose a spouse.\r\n\r\nAdopting a more direct method of determining the frequency of cousin\r\nmarriage, I estimated in each of sixteen genealogical works, the\r\nnumber of marriages recorded, and found the total to be 25,200. From\r\nthese sixteen families I obtained 153 cases of first cousin marriage,\r\nor .6 per cent. Allowing for the possible cases of cousin marriage in\r\nwhich the relationship was not given, or which I may have over-looked,\r\nthe true percentage is probably not far below the 1.12 per cent\r\nobtained by the other method.\r\n\r\nThe compiler of the, as yet, unpublished Loomis genealogy writes me\r\nthat he has the records of 7500 marriages in that family, of which 57\r\nor .8 per cent are same-name marriages. This would indicate that 1.07\r\nper cent were between first cousins.\r\n\r\nIn isolated communities, on islands, among the mountains, families\r\nstill remain in the same locality for generations, and people are\r\nborn, marry and die with the same environment. Their circle of\r\nacquaintance is very limited, and cousin marriage is therefore more\r\nfrequent. If we exclude such places, and consider only the more\r\nprogressive American communities, it is entirely possible that the\r\nproportion of first cousin marriages would fall almost if not quite to\r\n.5 per cent. So that the estimate of Dr. Dean for Iowa may not be far\r\nout of the way.\r\n\r\nEven for England Mr. Darwin's figures are probably much too large.\r\nApplying the corrected formula his table becomes:\r\n\r\n                   TABLE VI.\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n               |Number     |Per cent of|Per cent of\r\n1872.          |marriages  |same-name  |first cousin\r\n               |registered.|marriages. |marriages.\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nLondon,        |           |           |\r\nMetropolitan   |           |           |\r\nDistricts      | 33,155    |   .55     |  .73\r\nUrban Districts| 22,346    |   .71     |  .95\r\nRural Districts| 13,391    |   .79     | 1.05\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n      Total    | 68,892    |   .64     |  .85[A]\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n  [A] Cf. Mulhall, .75 per cent, _supra_, p. 18.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the frequency of marriage between kin more distant than\r\nfirst cousins figures are still more difficult to obtain. The\r\ndistribution of 514 cases of consanguineous marriage from genealogies\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n                             TABLE VII.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n              | First | 1-1/2 |Second | 2-1/2 | Third |Distant|\r\n              |cousins|cousins|cousins|cousins|cousins|cousins|Total\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSame-name     |  70   |   24  |  49   |  19   |  20   |  26   | 208\r\nDifferent-name|  96   |   30  |  58   |  22   |  37   |  62   | 305\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Total       | 166   |   54  | 107   |  41   |  57   |  88   | 513\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nObviously this cannot be taken as typical of the actual distribution\r\nof consanguineous marriages, since the more distant the degree, the\r\nmore difficult it is to determine the relationship. However it is very\r\nevident that the coefficient of attraction is at its maximum between\r\nfirst cousins, and probably there are actually more marriages between\r\nfirst cousins than between those of any other recognized degree of\r\nconsanguinity. But the two degrees of 1-1/2 cousins and second cousins\r\ntaken together probably number more intermarriages than first cousins\r\nalone. Allowing four children to a family, three of whom marry and\r\nhave families, the actual number of cousins a person would have on\r\neach degree would be: First, 16; 1-1/2, 80; Second, 96; 2-1/2, 480;\r\nThird, 576; Fourth, 3,456. The matter is usually complicated by double\r\nrelationships, but it will readily be seen that the consanguineal\r\nattraction would hardly be perceptible beyond the degree of third\r\ncousins.[27]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: See note, _infra_, p. 29.]\r\n\r\nOmitting, as in the discussion on page 24, those genealogies in which\r\nonly the male line is given we have the following table:\r\n\r\n                         TABLE  VIII.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n              |First  | 1-1/2 |Second | 2-1/2 | Third |Distant|\r\n              |cousins|cousins|cousins|cousins|cousins|cousins|Total\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSame-name     |   24  |   5   |  10   |   4   |   2   |   5   |  50\r\nDifferent-name|   62  |  15   |  33   |  12   |  23   |  26   | 171\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTotal         |   86  |  20   |  43   |  16   |  25   |  31   | 221\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt would naturally be supposed that with each succeeding degree of\r\nrelationship the ratio of same-name to different-name cousin marriages\r\nwould increase in geometrical proportion, viz. first cousins, 1:3;\r\nsecond cousins, 1:9; third cousins, 1:27, etc., but on the other hand\r\nthere is the tendency for families of the same name to hold together\r\neven in migration as may be proved by the strong predominance of\r\ncertain surnames in nearly every community. So that the ratio or\r\nsame-name to different-name second cousin marriage may not greatly\r\nexceed 1:4. Beyond this degree any estimate would be pure guesswork.\r\nHowever the coefficient of attraction between persons of the same\r\nsurname would undoubtedly be well marked in every degree of kinship,\r\nand conversely there are few same-name marriages in which some\r\nkinship, however remote, does not exist.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of mixed generation cousin marriages (1-1/2 cousins,\r\n2-1/2 cousins, etc.) is always smaller than the even generation\r\nmarriages of either the next nearer or more remote degrees. For\r\nexample, a man is more likely to marry his first or his second cousin\r\nthan either the daughter of his first cousin, or the first cousin of\r\none of his parents, although such mixed generation marriages often\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions, then, in regard to the frequency of consanguineous\r\nmarriage in the United States may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The frequency varies greatly in different communities, from perhaps\r\n.5 per cent of first cousin marriages in the northern and western\r\nstates to 5 per cent, and probably higher, in isolated mountain or\r\nisland communities. The average of first cousin marriage in the United\r\nStates is probably not greater than one per cent.\r\n\r\n2. The percentage of consanguineous marriages is decreasing with the\r\nincreasing ease of communication and is probably less than half as\r\ngreat now as in the days of the stage coach.\r\n\r\n3. Although the number of marriageable second cousins is usually\r\nseveral times as great as that of first cousins, the number of\r\nmarriages between second cousins is probably somewhat less than the\r\nnumber of marriages between first cousins, but the number of second\r\ncousin marriages combined with the number of 1-1/2 cousin marriages\r\nprobably exceeds the number of first cousin marriages alone. So that\r\nthe percentage of marriages ordinarily considered consanguineous is\r\nprobably between two, and two and a half.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--In an article entitled \"Sur le nombre des consanguins dans un\r\ngroupe de population,\" in _Archives italiennes de biologie_ (vol.\r\nxxxiii, 1900, pp. 230-241), Dr. E. Raseri shows that from one point of\r\nview the actual number of consanguineous marriages is little, if any,\r\ngreater than the probable number. The average number of children to a\r\nmarriage he finds to be 5, the average age of the parents 33 and the\r\naverage age at marriage 25. The Italian mortality statistics show that\r\n54 per cent of the population lives to the age of 25, of which 15 per\r\ncent does not marry, leaving an average of 2.3 children in every\r\nfamily who marry. On this basis a person would have at birth 4,357\r\nrelatives within the degree of fourth cousins; at the age of 33 he\r\nwould have 4,547; and at 66, 5,002. In 1897 out of 229,041 marriages\r\nin Italy, 1,046 were between first cousins, giving an average of one\r\nin 219. In 1881 the number of men between 18 and 50 and of women\r\nbetween 15 and 45 was 5,941, 495 in 8,259 communes with an average\r\npopulation of 3,500. In each commune there must be 360 marriageable\r\npersons of each sex, but to marry within his class a man would only\r\nhave the choice of 180 women and vice versa. Adding the probable\r\nnumber who would marry outside the commune, the choice lies within 216\r\nof the opposite sex. Of these 25 would be cousins within the tenth\r\ndegree (fourth cousins) making the probability of a consanguineous\r\nmarriage .11, reduced by a probable error in excess to .10. The\r\nprobability of a first cousin marriage would be .82/216 or .0038,\r\nwhereas the actual ratio is 1/219 or .0045.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMASCULINITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe predominance of male over female births is almost universal,\r\nalthough varying greatly in different countries and under different\r\nconditions. This fact has given rise to the term Masculinity, which\r\nconveniently expresses the proportion of the sexes at birth. The\r\ndegree of masculinity is usually indicated by the average number of\r\nmale births to every 100 female births. The cause of this\r\npreponderance of males is still a mystery, and will definitely be\r\nknown only when the causes of the determination of sex are known.\r\nSince, however, it is well known that infant mortality is greater\r\namong males than among females, positive masculinity is necessary to\r\nkeep up the balance of the sexes, and therefore seems to be an\r\nessential characteristic of a vigorous and progressive race.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years the theory has prevailed among certain\r\nsociologists that positive masculinity is stronger in the offspring of\r\nconsanguineous marriages than in the offspring of unrelated parents.\r\nProfessor William I. Thomas in his writings and lectures asserts this\r\nas highly probable.[28] Westermarck,[29] to whom Professor Thomas\r\nrefers, quotes authorities to show that certain self-fertilized plants\r\ntend to produce male flowers, and that the mating of horses of the\r\nsame coat color tends to produce an excess of males.[30]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _Sex and Society_, p. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: _History of Human Marriage_, p. 476.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _Goehlert, Ueber die Vererbung der Haarfarben bei den\r\nPferden._ Quoted by Westermarck, p. 476.]\r\n\r\nWestermarck continues, quoting from Düsing:[31] \"Among the Jews, many\r\nof whom marry cousins, there is a remarkable excess of male births. In\r\ncountry districts, where, as we have seen, comparatively more boys are\r\nborn than in towns, marriage more frequently takes place between\r\nkinsfolk. It is for a similar reason that illegitimate unions show a\r\ntendency to produce female births.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: _Die Regulierung des Geschlechtsverhaeltnisses_, pp.\r\n243-244.]\r\n\r\nWestermarck comments: \"The evidence for the correctness of his\r\ndeduction is, then, exceedingly scanty--if, indeed it can be called\r\nevidence. Nevertheless, I think his main conclusion holds good.\r\nIndependently of his reasoning I had come to exactly the same result\r\nin a purely inductive way.\" He then quotes a number of travelers to\r\nthe effect that marriage between members of different races produce a\r\nphenomenal excess of female births. When we consider the extraordinary\r\nproficiency in fiction attained by many travelers in strange lands, we\r\nare forced to the belief that Westermarck based his own conclusion on\r\nstill more scanty evidence.\r\n\r\nThe statistics given by Dr. Düsing for Prussia[32] are as follows:\r\n\r\n                          TABLE IX.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n             |            |           |   Other    |\r\n             |Evangelical.| Catholic. | Christians.| Jews.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMale births  | 4,015,634  | 2,273,708 |   12,283   |  69,901\r\nFemale births| 3,775,010  | 2,136,295 |   11,548   |  64,939\r\nMasculinity  |   106.374  |   106.435 |  106.36    | 107.64\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: _Das Geschlechtsverhaeltnis der Geburten in Preussen_,\r\npp. 24-25; in _Staatswissenschaftliche Studien_, vol. iii.]\r\n\r\nand for mixed marriages:\r\n\r\n                         TABLE  X.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n             |Evangelical  |Catholic and|  Other  | Jews and\r\n             |and Catholic.|Evangelical.|  mixed. |Christians.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMale births  |  157,755    |  189,733   |   4.464 |   2,958\r\nFemale births|  149,205    |  179,505   |   4.254 |   2,850\r\nMasculinity  |  105.73     |  105.70    | 104.9   | 103.8\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn the face of these statistics it is impossible to deny that\r\nendogamy within a great social class or an ethnic race may have some\r\ntendency to produce an excess of male births, while exogamy in this\r\nbroad sense may diminish the masculinity. But the perpetuation of a\r\ncomparatively pure race by marriage within that race, and\r\nconsanguineous marriage in the narrower sense are different\r\npropositions. It may easily be that the marriage of individuals of a\r\nsimilar type regardless of consanguinity produces a greater excess of\r\nmale offspring. According to the percentage of first cousin marriages\r\namong the Jews as given by Mulhall,[33] and allowing the average\r\nnumber of children to a marriage, there would be only 3100 children of\r\nsuch marriages among the Jewish births in Prussia, and in order that\r\nthese might raise the masculinity of Jewish births even from 106 to\r\n107 the 3100 births would have to have a masculinity of 200. Among\r\nProtestants, or especially among Catholics where the percentage of\r\ncousin marriage is much smaller, it seems hardly reasonable that the\r\ngeneral masculinity would be appreciably affected. A much better case\r\ncan be made for similarity or difference of race as the cause of the\r\nvariation. The difference between Catholic and Protestant is, roughly\r\nspeaking, the difference between the brachycephalic brunette Alpine\r\nrace and the dolichocephalic blonde Baltic race. So that a mixed\r\nmarriage in Germany would almost always mean the crossing of two\r\ndistinct types.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: _Dictionary of Statistics, op. cit._, p. 383.]\r\n\r\nThe investigations of M. Gache in Buenos Ayres covering the period\r\nfrom 1884 to 1894 inclusive, show that cross breeding has had the\r\neffect of _raising_ the masculinity. The births resulting from unions\r\nof Italian, Spanish and French male immigrants with native-born\r\nArgentine females, show a higher masculinity than the births produced\r\neither by pure Argentine alliances or by pure alliances of any of\r\nthese nationalities of Buenos Ayres. Further, the unions of Argentine\r\nmales with females of foreign nationality provide a higher masculinity\r\nthan is common among Argentines themselves.[34] These facts do not\r\nnecessarily contradict the theory that any crossing of great racial\r\ngroups diminishes masculinity, for all of the nationalities involved\r\nin this study are predominantly Mediterranean in blood. The theory is\r\nborne out by the statistics of the negroes in the United States, a\r\nlarge proportion of whom are of mixed blood. For taking as a basis the\r\nnumber of children of negro descent born during the year ending June\r\n1, 1900 reported by the Twelfth Census, the females predominated,\r\ngiving a negative masculinity of 99.8. Furthermore, the percentage of\r\nconsanguineous marriage is probably high in the colored population.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: C.J. & J.N. Lewis, _Natality and Fecundity_, pp.\r\n114-116.]\r\n\r\nThe following table compiled from Mulhall[35] and other sources fails\r\nto show any correspondence between the percentage of first cousin\r\nmarriage and the masculinity:\r\n\r\n                TABLE XI.\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nCountry. |Masculinity.|  Per cent 1st\r\n         |            |cousin marriage.\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nEngland  |   104.5    |      .75\r\nFrance   |   105.3    |     1.26\r\nItaly    |   107.0    |      .69\r\nPrussia  |   105.8    |      .67\r\nU.S.[36] |   104.9    |     1.00\r\nJews[37] |   107.6    |     2.30\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Op. cit., p. 92.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Masculinity, _Twelfth Census, Vital Statistics_, Pt. 1.\r\nPer cent of cousin marriage, estimated.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Duesing, op. cit., p. 24.]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to obtain the actual masculinity ratio for the United\r\nStates, for the Census gives the statistics for only one year in ten\r\nand even then is untrustworthy on this point. In a few states birth\r\nregistration is attempted but the figures thus obtained do not\r\nharmonize with the Census and the situation is not greatly\r\nimproved.[38] The masculinity varies considerably in different parts\r\nof the country, and is generally higher in states where the rural\r\npopulation predominates. This fact agrees with European statistics\r\nwhich almost universally show a high masculinity in rural districts.\r\nTable XII, illustrates this point:\r\n\r\n                       TABLE XII.\r\n              _Masculinity in Scotland_.[39]\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n         |         |      |      | Mainland |Insular\r\nPeriod.  |Principal|Large |Small | rural    | rural\r\n         | towns.  |towns.|towns.|districts.|districts.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n1855-1861|   --    |   -- |  --  |    105.6 | 106.6\r\n1862-1871|   --    |   -- |  --  |    105.9 | 105.6\r\n1872-1881| 105.0   | 105.6| 106.1|    105.3 | 108.0\r\n1882-1891| 105.1   | 105.6| 105.5|    105.5 | 108.7\r\n1892-1901| 104.7   | 104.6| 104.9|    105.2 | 107.1\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nAverage  | 104.9   | 105.3| 105.5|    105.5 | 107.2\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Massachusetts _Census_, 103.1; Reg. 1891-1900, 105.6.\r\nVermont _Census_, 108.1; Reg. 1890-1896, 105.9.

But\r\nunless consanguineous marriages can directly be shown to produce an\r\nexcess of male births greater than the normal, such indirect evidence\r\nis valueless.\r\n\r\nIn the genealogical material previously considered, we have a sampling\r\nof the American population throughout its whole history, but the data\r\nso far collected are insufficient for more than an indication of what\r\nmight be expected in further research along the same line. In the\r\nfollowing table as before, the figures compiled from printed\r\ngenealogies are separated from those obtained through correspondence\r\nand from miscellaneous sources. The \"unrelated\" marriages from\r\ngenealogies, are marriages of brothers and sisters of the persons who\r\nhave married first cousins, and their records were obtained from the\r\nsame sources as those in the next previous category. The \"children of\r\nfirst cousins\" are the offspring of the first cousin marriages who\r\nmarried persons not related to themselves by blood. The last category\r\nincludes distantly related marriages from correspondence and other\r\nsources and marriages between persons of the same surname whose\r\nrelationship could not be traced.\r\n\r\n                          TABLE XIII.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                         |        |    Sex of Children.   |\r\n                         |Number  |-----------------------|Mascu-\r\nMarriages.               |Fertile.| Male.|Female.|Unknown.|linity.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1st cousin.

It will be noticed, however,\r\nthat the two categories whose masculinity is most similar (100 and\r\n101), are derived from cases taken from the same families and from the\r\nsame environment, and differing only in that the first is closely\r\nconsanguineous while the second is not. The third and fourth groups,\r\nseparated from the first two by at least a generation, and probably\r\nliving in a different environment, differ greatly in masculinity from\r\nthem. In the fourth group are included 1-1/2, second, third, and a few\r\neven more distant cousins, all more distantly related than first\r\ncousins, and taken from the same genealogies as these; yet the\r\nmasculinity is much greater.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the cases collected fifty years ago by Dr. Bemiss, of\r\ncourse without thought of masculinity, gives the following result:[40]\r\n\r\n                      TABLE XIV.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n                      |   Sex of Children.   |\r\n                      |----------------------|\r\n     Marriage.        |Number.| Male.|Female.|Masculinity.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n1st cousins and nearer| 709   | 1245 | 1171  | 106.3\r\n2d and 3rd cousins    | 124   |  264 |  240  | 110.0\r\nAll consanguineous    | 833   | 1509 | 1411  | 106.9\r\nUnrelated             | 125   |  444 |  380  | 116.9\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Bemiss, _Report on Influence of Marriages of\r\nConsanguinity_, pp. 420-423.]\r\n\r\nIn the \"Marriage of Near Kin,\" Mr. Huth gives a list of cases of\r\nconsanguineous marriage collected by various persons from all over\r\nEurope.[41] He is free to say that they are worse than useless for the\r\npurpose for which they were collected, that of determining whether or\r\nnot such marriages produce degeneracy, but in so far as the sex of the\r\nchildren is concerned they would not be biassed.\r\n\r\n                     TABLE XV.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n                      |Sex of Children.|\r\n                      |----------------|\r\n     Marriage.        | Male.| Female. | Masculinity.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n1st cousins and nearer| 165  |  164    |   100\r\nMore distant cousins  |  95  |   73    |   131\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Huth, _Marriage of Near Kin. Appendix._]\r\n\r\nThe unusual ratios are of course due principally to a \"run of luck,\"\r\nand this table only shows that if consanguinity is a determining\r\nfactor in sex, its influence is negligible when a small number of\r\ncases is considered. It is interesting accordingly to note that of 100\r\nchildren of incestuous unions and from uncle-niece and aunt-nephew\r\nmarriages from Bemiss, Huth and other sources, the sex distribution\r\nwas 48 males and 52 females, giving a negative masculinity of 92.\r\n\r\nWhile in general the evidence presented in this chapter is somewhat\r\nconflicting, that which bears most directly upon the problem does not\r\nsubstantiate the hypothesis of Westermarck. The evidence in favor of\r\nthe theory is all indirect and is open to other interpretations. It is\r\nhardly safe to go to the other extreme and to assert that\r\nconsanguinity diminishes masculinity. The safest, and withal the most\r\nreasonable conclusion is that consanguinity in the parents has no\r\nappreciable effect upon the sex of the child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCONSANGUINITY AND REPRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal object of nearly every previous discussion of the\r\nintermarriage of kindred, has been either to prove or to disprove some\r\nalleged injurious effect upon the offspring. The writers who have\r\ntreated the subject may be divided into three groups. First, those who\r\nhave maintained in accordance with popular opinion that consanguinity\r\n_per se_ is a cause of degeneracy or that in some mysterious way\r\nkinship of the parents produces certain diseases in the children. In\r\nthis group Boudin in France and Bemiss in America are typical. Second,\r\nthose who have flatly contradicted this position and have asserted\r\nthat on the whole such marriages are beneficial, and that crossing is\r\nin itself injurious to the race. Huth is the chief exponent of this\r\ntheory, although he admits that where degenerate conditions exist in\r\nthe parents consanguinity in marriage may not be beneficial. The third\r\ngroup holds that cousin marriages in themselves, especially if not\r\ncarried through too many generations, are not harmful, but that if any\r\nhereditary tendency to malformation or disease exists in the family of\r\nthe parents, this tendency, inherited through both parents is strongly\r\nintensified in the offspring, and that consequently an increased\r\npercentage of the offspring of cousin marriage may be afflicted with\r\nhereditary diseases. This group includes a number of the later writers\r\nsuch as Feer and Mayet. Among the earlier discussions, those of Dally\r\nin France and George H. Darwin in England take substantially this\r\nposition. On the whole this theory seems to be the most reasonable one\r\nand with a few modifications it will be seen to account for all the\r\nfacts herein presented.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that degeneracy does in some cases follow from the\r\nmarriage of near kin, and probably with greater frequency than from\r\nnon-related marriages. But it is likewise true that many of the\r\nworld's greatest men have been the products of close inbreeding,\r\nsometimes continued through several generations. Frederick the Great\r\nof Prussia was the product of three successive cousin marriages\r\nbetween descendants of William the Silent,[42] and among his seven\r\nbrothers and sisters at least three others ranked among the ablest men\r\nand women of the generation. Cousin marriage has always been frequent\r\nin the \"first families of Virginia\" which have produced a phenomenal\r\npercentage of able men. In fact, few persons who have traced their\r\npedigrees back through a number of generations, do not find some names\r\nduplicated, as a result of cousin marriage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Woods, _Heredity in Royalty_, pp. 74-75. The Great\r\nElector, a great-grandson of William the Silent, married his 1-1/2\r\ncousin, a granddaughter of William and also a great-granddaughter of\r\nAdmiral Coligny. Frederick I married his second cousin, daughter of\r\nthe Duchess Sophia of Brunswick, and a descendant of William.\r\nFrederick William I married his first cousin, Dorothea, granddaughter\r\nof Sophia, and also a descendant of William the Silent. Unfortunately\r\nthe Hohenzollern line was continued by a mediocre brother of Frederick\r\nII, but through his sister, Queen Ulrica, the line of genius lasted\r\nstill another generation to Gustavus III of Sweden.]\r\n\r\nThe ills which have at one time or another been attributed to\r\nconsanguineous marriage include nearly all those which cannot\r\notherwise be satisfactorily accounted for. But with the progress of\r\npathology the list has greatly been reduced: for instance, cretinism\r\nis now known to be a product of local conditions. The remaining\r\ncounts in the indictment against consanguineous marriage may roughly\r\nbe classified as: 1. The production of infertility, some forms of\r\nphysical degeneracy, and deformity. 2. The production or aggravation\r\nof mental and nervous disorders. 3. The production of certain defects\r\nin the organs of special sense. These three divisions will be\r\ndiscussed separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. INFERTILITY AND DEGENERACY\r\n\r\nAlthough there has never been any considerable evidence for the first\r\nof these charges, it has frequently been repeated. Professor\r\nMontegazza of the University of Pavia collected data in regard to 512\r\ncases of consanguineous marriage of which between 8 and 9 per cent\r\nwere sterile, and with this basis he asserts that sterility is the\r\nonly fact which can safely be deduced from his cases, since it cannot\r\nbe hereditary.[43] But if in the nature of things absolute sterility\r\nis not inheritable, comparative infertility may be. And even then 8 or\r\n9 per cent does not seem to be an excessively high proportion of\r\nsterility, especially if late marriages be counted. Boudin bases his\r\nassertion on this point on even less tenable grounds.[44] On the other\r\nhand some writers assure us that cousin marriages are even more\r\nprolific and less liable to sterility than the average.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: See Darwin, \"Marriages between First Cousins in England\r\nand Their Effects,\" _Journal of Statistical Society_, June, 1875, p.\r\n178.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Boudin, \"Croisement des familles, de races et des\r\nespèces.\" In _Memoires de la Société d' Anthropologie_, vol. i, p.\r\n518.]\r\n\r\nThe most important statistical investigation was made by G.H.\r\nDarwin.[45] From his genealogical data he compiled the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n                              TABLE  XVI.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                         |          |  Average   |            |Ave. no.\r\n                         |          |  number    |  Per cent  |sons to\r\n                         |Number of |  sons to   |  sterile   |fertile\r\n                         |marriages.| marriage.  | marriages. |marriage.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nNot consanguineous       |    217   |     1.91   |       15.9 | 2.26\r\nParents 1st cousins[A]   |97 to 105 |2.07 to 1.92|14.7 to 20.9| 2.43\r\nOne parent offspring of  |          |            |            |\r\n 1st cousin marriages.   |    93    |    1.93    |     17.2   | 2.34\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  [A] Eight cases of doubtful fertility.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: Op. cit., p. 181.]\r\n\r\nIt will readily be seen that the conclusion is negative, since the\r\nvariation is slight, but the higher fertility of the cousin marriages\r\nis interesting.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand de Lapouge quotes a case of a community founded two\r\ncenturies ago by four families and populated almost entirely by their\r\ndescendants, in which from 1862 to 1886 there were 273 marriages of\r\nwhich 63 were consanguineous and 26 were between first cousins. Among\r\nthe non-consanguineous 3 per cent were uniparous, as against 7.95 per\r\ncent among the consanguineous. 7.5 per cent of the non-consanguineous\r\nwere sterile as against 16 per cent of the consanguineous.[46] The\r\nimportance of these percentages is impaired by the fact that they\r\ninvolve only five uniparous families and ten sterile ones, and that of\r\nthese latter only five were sprung from first cousins.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: De Lapouge, _Les Selections Societies_, p. 196.]\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to get any accurate statistics of sterility\r\nfrom genealogies, for when no children are given in the record, there\r\nis always a strong possibility that there were children of whom the\r\ngenealogist has no record. However, of 16 first-cousin marriages of\r\nwhich the record expressly stated \"no issue,\" or where it was\r\npractically certain that no issue was possible, the average age of the\r\nbrides was 34.3 years and that of the grooms was 39 years, showing\r\nthat consanguinity could not have been the only cause of their\r\nsterility.\r\n\r\nIn regard to relative fertility the figures are reliable, but they\r\nfail to indicate any effect of consanguinity upon fertility, as will\r\nbe noted in Table XVII.\r\n\r\n                            TABLE  XVII.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                              |No. of    |         | Ave. to\r\n                              |fertile   | No. of  | fertile\r\nParentage.                    |marriages.|children.|marriage.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFirst cousin.

Med. Asso._, vol. xi,\r\n1858, pp. 420-425.]\r\n\r\nThe comparatively low averages of the consanguineous marriages from\r\nBemiss may easily be accounted for by the fact that the cases were\r\nhighly selected so that nearly one-third of the children were in some\r\nway defective, and the parents in many cases were far below the\r\naverage in vitality. The \"more distantly related\" are in a still\r\nlesser degree representative of the class, since out of a greater\r\npossibility of choice a smaller number were chosen. The\r\n\"non-consanguineous\" were supposed to be near the average in vitality\r\nand fertility.\r\n\r\nIn Norway, according to Uchermann, the consanguineous and the\r\nnon-consanguineous marriages are equally fertile, averaging 6.1\r\nchildren per marriage;[49] and in a Black Forest village Tenckhoff\r\nfound an average of 4.6 children to each consanguineous marriage as\r\nagainst 3.5 to each non-consanguineous marriage.[50] In regard to the\r\nyouthful death-rate among the offspring of consanguineous marriages,\r\ncomparison with non-related marriages is more feasible. I have counted\r\nin each case all those children who are known to have died under the\r\nage of twenty. This age was taken for the sake of convenience, and to\r\ninclude all children indefinitely specified as having \"died young.\"\r\nThe results are given in Table XIX:\r\n\r\n                      TABLE XIX.\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n    Parentage.    | No. of  |No. dying |\r\n   (Genealogies.) |Children.|under 20. |Per cent.\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nFirst cousins     |   672   |   113    |  16.7\r\nOther cousins     |  1417   |   211    |  14.9\r\nCh. of 1st cousins|   825   |   103    |  12.5\r\nNon-consanguineous|  3184   |   370    |  11.6\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n(Correspondence.)\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nFirst cousins     |   759   |    88    |  11.6\r\nOther marriages   |   829   |    71    |   8.6\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Feer, _Der Einfluss der Blutsverwandschaft der Eltern\r\nauf die Kinder,_ p. 12, _note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Ibid.]\r\n\r\nIf the figures in Table XIX are to be accepted at their face value,\r\nand there seems to be no good reason for not doing so in the\r\ngenealogical cases at least, the youthful death-rate among the\r\noffspring of consanguineous marriages far exceeds the average. The\r\naverage in the correspondence cases is undoubtedly too low, as many\r\ncorrespondents failed to report the deaths. From the fact that a\r\ncomparatively large percentage of these were reported as defective, we\r\nshould expect a higher death-rate than among the unbiased genealogical\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nDr. Bemiss found a very high death-rate among the children of\r\nconsanguineous marriage, due partly to the fact that his cases were\r\nreported by physicians. He reports that of the offspring of marriages\r\nbetween first cousins and nearer relatives, 23 per cent \"died young;\"\r\nof the offspring of more remote consanguineous marriages, 16 per cent;\r\nand of non-related marriages 16 per cent. There is, therefore, a\r\nstrong indication of lowered vitality as a result of consanguineous\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nA determination of even the approximate percentage of degenerate\r\noffspring resulting from marriages of consanguinity by direct inquiry\r\nis exceedingly difficult. The average human mind is so constituted as\r\nto exaggerate unconsciously the unusual in its experience. Herein lies\r\nthe fallacy in the work of Dr. Bemiss. His material was \"furnished\r\nexclusively by reputable _physicians_ in various states,\" and of the\r\n3942 children of consanguineous marriages in the cases thus furnished\r\nhim, 1134 or 28.8 per cent were in some way \"defective.\" Of these, 145\r\nwere deaf and dumb, 85 blind, 308 idiotic, 38 insane, 60 epileptic,\r\n300 scrofulous and 98 deformed. It is evident that a physician in\r\nreporting such data to a physician would naturally give cases in which\r\nsomething pathological existed. Even if there were no conscious bias,\r\nsuch cases would be the ones with which a physician would be most\r\nlikely to come in contact. Dr. Bemiss himself recognized the\r\npossibility of this bias. To quote him:\r\n\r\n    It is, natural for contributors to overlook many of the more\r\n    fortunate results of family intermarriage, and furnish those\r\n    followed by defective offspring and sterility. The mere\r\n    existence of either of these conditions would prompt inquiry,\r\n    while the favorable cases might pass unnoticed. Contributors\r\n    have been particularly requested to furnish without prejudice\r\n    or selection all instances of the marriage of consanguinity\r\n    within their various circles of observation, whatever their\r\n    results.[51]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Bemiss. see _Trans. of Am. Med. Asso._, vol. xi, 1858,\r\np. 323.]\r\n\r\nYet he does not seem to believe that this bias seriously affects his\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nIn order as far as possible to avoid this bias, I sent my own\r\ncirculars to genealogists and others who would naturally be more\r\ninterested in the relationships than in pathological conditions. I\r\nasked, however, that all such results be noted. Among 722 children of\r\nfirst cousins I found 95 or 13 per cent who were defective in the\r\nsense in which Bemiss used the term. This is much nearer the actual\r\npercentage, but I have reason to believe, as will be seen hereafter,\r\nthat even this percentage is far too high. A good illustration of the\r\nunconscious bias, which I tried to avoid is afforded by the reports on\r\nthe cause of death among children of first cousins. Only 58 replies\r\nwere given to this question, and of the 58 deaths 14 or one-fourth\r\nwere either accidental or otherwise violent, while only one person was\r\nreported to have succumbed to pneumonia.\r\n\r\nMany efforts have been made to investigate the occurrence of\r\ndegeneracy in the offspring of consanguineous marriages, by studying\r\ncommunities in which such unions have been frequent, but the results\r\nare untrustworthy. Huth[52] quotes a number of instances where\r\ncommunities have lived for generations without crosses and with no\r\napparent degeneracy, while other writers tell of high percentages of\r\ndegeneracy. Smith's Island, Maryland, as has been said, seems\r\nabsolutely free from serious congenital abnormalities, in spite of the\r\ngreat frequency of consanguineous marriages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: _Marriage of Near Kin_, chap. iv.]\r\n\r\nThe causes of degeneracy are so varied, complicated, and obscure that\r\neven if consanguinity is a cause, there can be but few cases in which\r\nit is not complicated by other factors. But for the same reason that\r\nit is so difficult to prove any connection between consanguinity and\r\ndegeneracy, it is equally difficult to disprove such a connection. It\r\nis very probable that from the mere operation of the law of heredity,\r\nthere must be a comparatively large percentage of degenerates among\r\nthe offspring of related parents, for defects which tend to be bred\r\nout by crossing are accentuated by inbreeding. This may be the reason\r\nfor the disagreement among investigators of isolated communities. If\r\nan island, for instance, were settled by a small group of families in\r\neven one of which some hereditary defect was common, in the course of\r\na few generations that defect would be found in a relatively large\r\npart of the population. While if the same island were settled by\r\nperfectly sound families, there would only be a remote chance of any\r\nparticular defect appearing. Thus both classes of investigators may be\r\nperfectly conscientious, and yet arrive at diametrically opposite\r\nresults. This theory is at least not to be contradicted by any facts\r\nwhich have come to light in the present investigation.\r\n\r\nSome interesting points are brought up in Dugdale's well-known study\r\nof the \"Jukes.\"[53] This family, of about 540 persons living in\r\nnorthern New York, is descended from five sisters of unknown\r\nparentage, who were born between 1740 and 1770. The name \"Juke\" is\r\nfictitious, and is applied to all descendants of these five women,\r\nlittle attempt being made to trace the male lines on account of the\r\nexcessive prevalence of illegitimacy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: R.L. Dugdale, _The Jukes_]\r\n\r\nIn this family consanguineous marriages have been very frequent,\r\nperhaps partly because the Jukes came to be looked upon as pariahs and\r\ncould not associate on equal terms with other members of the\r\ncommunity. These marriages seem to have been fully as productive as\r\nthe average of the family, and the offspring of as high a grade of\r\nintelligence. However, some individual cases are worthy of special\r\nmention as illustrative of intensification of hereditary tendencies.\r\n\r\n(1) An illegitimate son of Ada Juke married a daughter of Bell Juke.\r\nHe was a laborer, honest and industrious. She was reputable and\r\nhealthy, and her father had a good reputation, but her mother had\r\ngiven birth to four illegitimate children before marriage, three of\r\nwhom were mulattoes. Thus in this marriage of first cousins, three out\r\nof the four parents were of a low moral grade. As a result of this\r\nmarriage three sons and three daughters were born. Two sons were\r\nlicentious, intemperate and dishonest, two daughters were prostitutes,\r\nand the third became such after her husband was sent to prison. Only\r\none son turned out fairly well. This son married a second cousin, a\r\ngranddaughter of Delia Juke, and four out of his seven children were\r\nabove the average of the family. His two elder brothers, however,\r\nmarried prostitutes, and became ancestors of criminals, prostitutes\r\nand syphilitics.[54]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Ibid., Chart I.]\r\n\r\n(2) A legitimate son of Ada Juke, whose father was a thief and a\r\npauper, married a daughter of Clara Juke, whose antecedents were\r\nfairly good. The husband had contracted syphilis before marriage and\r\nentail it upon every one of his eight children. Five daughters became\r\nprostitutes and one was idiotic. The only daughter who bore a good\r\nreputation married a grandson of both Clara and Bell Juke. This was a\r\nremarkable case of selection. Both husband and wife were grandchildren\r\nof Clara, and so first cousins, and both were the offspring of first\r\ncousins, all within the Juke blood. But, on the other hand, both were\r\nthe descendants of Clara, the best of the Juke sisters, and both were\r\nthe best of the progeny of their respective parents. The only serious\r\ntaint was the secondary syphilis which the wife had inherited from her\r\nfather. Six children were born, two males and four females. The eldest\r\nson was at 31 \"laborer, industrious, temperate;\" the eldest daughter\r\n\"good repute, temperate, read and write;\" second daughter, \"harlot;\"\r\nthird daughter \"good repute, temperate;\" and the two youngest are\r\ngiven simply as \"unmarried.\" This family seems to have had as high an\r\naverage mentally and morally as any family in the whole tribe, only\r\none in six being distinctly immoral. In the next generation, the\r\neldest son had two children, the eldest daughter four, and the third\r\ndaughter, who married a first cousin, had one child. It would be of\r\ngreat interest to know more of this last marriage, the third\r\ngeneration of consanguinity in marriage, and the fourth first-cousin\r\nmarriage in three generations, but at the time the book was written\r\nthe parties were still in their early twenties.[55]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Dugdale, op. cit., Chart II.]\r\n\r\nMr. Dugdale makes the following \"tentative inductions.\" 1. Boys\r\npreponderate in the illegitimate lines. 2. Girls preponderate in the\r\nintermarried branches. 3. Lines of intermarriage between Jukes show a\r\nminimum of crime. 4. Pauperism preponderates in the consanguineous\r\nlines. 5. In the main, crime begins in progeny where Juke blood\r\ncrosses X blood. (Anyone not descended from a Juke, is of \"X blood\").\r\n6. The illegitimate lines have chiefly married into X.[56] The third\r\nand fourth inductions might indicate that a lowered vitality of the\r\nconsanguineous lines changed a tendency toward crime into the less\r\nstrenuous channel of pauperism, but I cannot find in Mr. Dugdale's\r\ncharts any sufficient basis for the induction. It is true that the\r\nmost distinctively pauper line is consanguineous, but it is less\r\nclosely inbred than the \"semi-successful\" branch. As to the fifth\r\ninduction, a close examination of the data shows clearly that in\r\nnearly every case where an X marriage occurred, it was with a person\r\nof a distinctly immoral or criminal type. Cousin marriage has also\r\nbeen frequent in the middle western counterpart of the Jukes, the\r\n\"Tribe of Ishmael.\"[57]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Dugdale, op. cit., p. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: McCulloch, _Tribe of Ishmael_.]\r\n\r\nA more recent study of hereditary degeneracy is that of the \"Zero\r\nFamily\" in Switzerland.[58] Here the first degenerate was the product\r\nof two successive consanguineous marriages, both with a branch tainted\r\n_with insanity_. In spite of his bad ancestry he lived to the age of\r\n106 years. He married an Italian woman of questionable antecedents,\r\nand was the father of a large family. Three hundred and ten of his\r\ndescendants are mentioned, of whom many are still young. Of these 310,\r\n74 died in early childhood, 55 are or were vagabonds, 58 were\r\nweak-minded or idiotic and 23 were criminals. Fifty-two were of\r\nillegitimate birth. Although some are counted in more than one\r\ncategory, the record is appalling. In this family however, the\r\nmarriages were nearly all with foreign women, and the effect of\r\nconsanguinity was only the intensification of the neurosis in the\r\nfirst two generations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Joerger, \"Die Familie Zero.\" Reviewed by Gertrude C.\r\nDavenport, in the _American Journal of Sociology_, Nov., 1907.]\r\n\r\nDr. Bemiss found that 300 or 7.7 per cent of the offspring of\r\nconsanguineous marriages were subject to scrofula.[59] This is a\r\ndisease which is almost universally recognized as hereditary, and\r\nwhich we should therefore expect to find intensified by double\r\nheredity. But 7.7 per cent is obviously too high; otherwise most of\r\nthe scrofulous must be the offspring of marriages of kindred. About\r\none per cent of the children of my own correspondence cases were\r\nreported as scrofulous. And while the United States Census reports but\r\n3.9 per cent of the blind as the offspring of consanguineous\r\nmarriages, the percentage of the blind from scrofula is 6.1.[60] The\r\nblind from scrofula of consanguineous parentage were 2.8 per cent of\r\nall the blind of consanguineous parentage, while all the blind from\r\nscrofula were 1.8 per cent of all the blind. Consanguinity, then,\r\nseems appreciably to intensify scrofula, but there is no indication\r\nthat scrofula is ever caused by parental consanguinity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Bemiss, see _Trans. of Am. Med. Asso._, vol. xi, 1858,\r\np. 420.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _The Blind and the Deaf._ Special Report of 12th Census,\r\n1906.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCONSANGUINITY AND MENTAL DEFECT\r\n\r\n\r\nIdiocy, perhaps more than any other disease or defect, has long been\r\nconnected in the popular mind with the marriage of cousins. This fact\r\nis not surprising when we consider that until very recent times idiots\r\nwere looked upon with a kind of superstitious awe, and the affliction\r\nwas supposed to be a curse of God. For this reason, when idiocy did\r\nfollow consanguineous marriage as it sometimes would, it was believed\r\nto be the fit punishment of some violation of divine law. Insanity\r\nalso frequently has been attributed to consanguineous marriage, but\r\nnot so frequently as idiocy, since its occurrence later in life is not\r\nso obviously connected with pre-natal conditions.\r\n\r\nThe terminology of mental and nervous disorders has been so loosely\r\napplied that some definition may be necessary. By the term \"idiocy,\"\r\nis meant a condition of undeveloped mentality. Idiocy exists in\r\nvarious degrees, from the complete absence of intellectual faculties\r\nto a condition of mere irresponsibility in which the subject is\r\ncapable of self-help, and sometimes of self-support under the careful\r\nguidance of other. Under the generic term \"idiot\" may be included the\r\n\"complete idiot,\" the imbecile, the \"feeble-minded\" and the\r\n\"simpleton,\" all of whom suffer in a greater or less degree from\r\narrested mental development.\r\n\r\nInsanity, on the other hand, is a disease which destroys or clouds an\r\nintellect which has once been developed. It is true that certain\r\nconditions of idiocy and imbecility do resemble that phase of insanity\r\nknown as dementia--a reversion to the original mental state of\r\nchildhood--in reality a form of second childhood. But the states are\r\nnot identical, although one may lapse into the other. One is defect,\r\nthe other disease; the imbecile in the former being the counterpart of\r\nthe dement in the latter, just as the moral imbecile is the analogue\r\nof the paranoiac.[61]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Barr, _Mental Defectives_, p. 18.]\r\n\r\nOf the strong inheritability of idiocy there can be no doubt. Dr.\r\nMartin W. Barr of the Pennsylvania Training School for Feeble Minded\r\nChildren has published an etiological table embodying the results of a\r\ncareful examination of 4050 cases of mental defect. Of these, 2651 or\r\n65.45 per cent resulted from causes acting before birth, including\r\n1030 or 25.43 per cent with a family history of idiocy and imbecility,\r\nand 529 more (13.06 per cent) with a family history of insanity,\r\nepilepsy and minor neuroses. Dr. Barr gives many instances\r\nillustrating the heredity of imbecility, especially where both parents\r\nwere imbeciles, and had imbecile relatives. One case in particular\r\nforcibly illustrates the disastrous results of the marriage of such\r\nunfortunates. It is taken from the reports of the Connecticut Lunacy\r\nCommission:\r\n\r\n    In one instance, where a pauper female idiot lived in one town,\r\n    the town authorities hired an idiot belonging to another town,\r\n    and not then a pauper, to marry her, and the result has been\r\n    that the town to which the male idiot belongs has for many\r\n    years had to support the pair and the three idiot children.[62]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Ibid., p. 99.]\r\n\r\nNeuroses may remain latent for a generation and reappear in the\r\ngrandchildren of the person affected, or the latent tendency may never\r\nreappear unless some disturbing factor such as scarletina, meningitis\r\nor other acute disease attacks the weak spot. This possibility\r\nsuggests that the influence of heredity may be vastly greater than the\r\netiological tables would indicate. The apparent causes may be only\r\nagents which assist in developing the evil really engendered by an\r\ninheritance of imbecility.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all certain that there is any well marked boundary line\r\nbetween genius and some forms of imbecility. Many quite irresponsible\r\nidiots have marvelous verbal memories, and can repeat parrot-like,\r\npage after page of books of which they have no comprehension. Dr. Barr\r\ntells of cases of prodigies, musical, mathematical and mechanical, who\r\nexcept in their specialty were almost totally deficient mentally.[63]\r\nMany of the world's most brilliant musicians, mathematicians and even\r\nmilitary leaders have been men of one-sided mental development, whose\r\nability in other lines was so slight that they were little better than\r\nimbeciles, and it is not at all surprising that their children are\r\nsometimes truly idiotic.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Barr, op. cit., p. 301 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThe best writers of the present day no longer recognize consanguinity\r\nas a cause _per se_, of idiocy. The heredity of neuroses, however, is\r\nso strongly established that few would dispute the proposition that\r\nwhere the morbidity is inherited through both parents it appears more\r\nfrequently and in a more marked degree than where one parent is\r\nentirely free from taint. This is what occurs when a consanguineous\r\nmarriage takes place between descendants of a neurotic family. The\r\npercentage of idiotic children would then be somewhat higher from\r\nconsanguineous marriages than from the average marriage purely through\r\nthe action of the laws of heredity.\r\n\r\nDr. Barr finds 49 out of 4050 cases of idiocy or 1.21 per cent, in\r\nwhich there was a family history of consanguinity. This is little\r\nhigher than the average frequency of first cousin marriage, and an\r\nanalysis of 41 of these cases does not show one case that can be\r\nattributed to consanguinity alone. To quote: \"Two were the result of\r\nincestuous connection--one of brother and sister, the other of father\r\nand daughter, and in the others there was an undoubted history, of\r\ngrave neuroses.\"[64] \"Beach and Shuttleworth find in the consideration\r\nof their 100 cases (out of 2,380 idiots), giving 4.2 per cent (of\r\nconsanguineous parentage) that the bad effects are due rather to the\r\nintensification of bad heredity common to both parents.\"[65]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Barr, op. cit., p. 94.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Ibid., p. 109.]\r\n\r\nDr. Arthur Mitchell examined all idiots in nine counties of Scotland\r\nand found that 42 out of 519 or 8.1 per cent of whom the parentage was\r\nknown, were children of first cousins.[66] Dr. Down found 46 out of\r\n852 or 5.4 per cent to be children of first cousins.[67] Dr. Grabham\r\nof the Earlswood Idiot Asylum in Surrey, England, stated that 53 out\r\nof 1388 patients were the offspring of first cousins. The facts, he\r\nadds, were obtained from the parents and are \"therefore tolerably\r\ntrustworthy.\"[68] Other investigations give percentages as follows:\r\nKerlin, 7; Rogers, 3.6; Brown, 3.5 and C.T. Wilbur, 0.3.[69]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: Darwin, see _Jour. Stat. Soc._, p. 173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: Huth, _Marriage of Near Kin_, pp. 210-211.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: Darwin, op. cit., p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Barr, op. cit., p. 109.]\r\n\r\nThe earlier American writers, Drs. Howe and Bemiss, believed that\r\nconsanguinity was a cause of idiocy. Dr. Howe inquired into the\r\nparentage of 359 idiots and found that in 17 families the parents were\r\nnearly related; in one of these cases there were 5 idiotic children;\r\nin 5 families there were 4 idiots each; in 3 families 3 each; in 2\r\nfamilies 2 each; and in 6 families i each. In all 17 families there\r\nwere 95 children of whom 44 were idiots, 12 were scrofulous and puny,\r\n1 was deaf, 1 dwarf--58 in low health or defective, and only 37 fairly\r\nhealthy. These of course are selected cases and do not indicate at\r\nall, as Dr. Howe supposed, that consanguinity was the cause of the\r\ndisasters. He adds that in each case one or both of the parents were\r\neither intemperate or scrofulous, and that there were also other\r\npredisposing causes.[70] Dr. Bemiss found that 7.8 per cent of his\r\n3942 children of consanguineous marriages were idiots, while but 0.7\r\nper cent of the children of non-consanguineous parentage were\r\nidiotic.[71] A more detailed examination reveals the fact that in a\r\nlarge number of these, one or both of the parents were mentally\r\ndefective. For example, in a marriage of double cousins the wife was\r\n\"feeble minded\" and the six children were of inferior mentality. In a\r\ncase of first-cousin marriage the wife became insane and two of the\r\nchildren were idiotic. In a case of the marriage of cousins,\r\nthemselves the offspring of cousins the husband was a hypochondriac,\r\nand seven children idiotic. In another marriage of the same class both\r\nparents were feeble-minded and the children idiotic. These are simply\r\ntaken at random, and many others might be given. When we find also\r\nthat in a majority of cases no report is given of the ancestry, it is\r\nvery obvious that consanguinity alone could not have been the cause of\r\nany large proportion of the 308 cases of idiocy in the Bemiss report.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Barr, op. cit., p. iii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Bemiss, op. cit., p. 420.]\r\n\r\nMy own investigations show that out of 600 children of first cousin\r\nmarriage (from correspondence) 26 or 4.3 per cent are mentally\r\ndefective--10 are reported as \"idiots,\" 13 as \"weak-minded\" and 3 as\r\n\"imbeciles.\" In at least five of these cases there is evidence of bad\r\nheredity, in two others the father was intemperate and in two more\r\ncauses acting after birth are mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of the insane and idiotic in Prussia presented by Mayet\r\nclearly indicate the large part which heredity plays in the production\r\nof mental disorders. Tables XX and XXI set forth the most important\r\nresults of his work. Mayet considers a case hereditary if any near\r\nrelative of the subject suffered from mental or nervous disorder, or\r\nwas intemperate, suicidal, criminal or eccentric.[72]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: Mayet, _Verwandtenehe and Statistik_, quoted by Feer,\r\n_Der Einfluss der Blutsverwandschaft der Eltern auf die Kinder_, p.\r\n13.]\r\n\r\n                 TABLE XX.\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n                            | No. of |Percentage\r\n                            | Cases. |hereditary.\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n1.

Since insanity is more likely to have some more definitely\r\nassignable cause than idiocy, we should expect the percentage due to\r\nheredity to be lower and consequently the influence of consanguinity\r\nless.\r\n\r\nIt is generally admitted that a tendency toward insanity is\r\ninheritable, and it seems probable that this tendency as well as other\r\nneuroses may be intensified through double heredity. A case in point\r\ncan be found in the Shattuck genealogy.[74] For four generations in\r\nthe S. family there is no indication of neurosis. The average number\r\nof children to a family had been eight, few children died young and\r\nall were prosperous farmers. But in 1719 J.S. married E.C. and their\r\nson Z.S. is thus described: \"He was sometimes subject to depression of\r\nspirits; and some peculiar traits of character in a few branches of\r\nhis family seem to have originated with him.\" He married A.C., a niece\r\nof his mother. They both lived to be over 80 and had ten children, of\r\nwhom three were insane; only six married, and of these only two are\r\nknown to have left surviving children. One of these a daughter, S.S.,\r\nmarried E.S., a nephew of her father, and himself the offspring of a\r\nsecond cousin marriage within the S. blood. E.S. and S.S. had five\r\nchildren, all of whom married, and there is no further mention of\r\ninsanity. We may suppose, then, that the C. stock was neurotic, and\r\nthat a consanguineous marriage within that stock, although of the S.\r\nsurname, intensified the tendency into insanity, but with a further\r\ninfusion of the normal S. blood the morbidity was eliminated. It is\r\nvery evident that the heredity and not the consanguinity was the cause\r\nof these three cases of insanity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: _Shattuck Memorials_, p. 118.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCONSANGUINITY AND THE SPECIAL SENSES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important source for this chapter is the special report on\r\nthe Blind and the Deaf in the Twelfth Census of the United States.[75]\r\nThis report was prepared under the direction of Dr. Alexander Graham\r\nBell, as Expert Special Agent of the Census Office.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: U.S. Census, 1900, _Special Report on the Blind and the\r\nDeaf_.]\r\n\r\nThe enumerators of the Twelfth Census reported a total of 101,123\r\npersons as blind, and to each of these Dr. Bell addressed a circular\r\nof inquiry. By this method he obtained verified returns of 64,763\r\ncases of blindness in continental United States or 85.2 per 100,000 of\r\nthe total population. In the same way he obtained data in regard to\r\n89,287 persons with seriously impaired powers of hearing, or 117.5 Per\r\n100,000 of the total population.\r\n\r\nIn each case the following questions among others were asked: \"Were\r\nhis (or her) parents first cousins? If not first cousins were they\r\notherwise related by blood to each other, before their marriage? Were\r\nany of his relatives blind? If yes, what relatives? (Father, mother,\r\ngrandparents, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, and how many of each,\r\nso far as known).\" The results of this inquiry give us the best and\r\nmost reliable statistical material which has ever been compiled on any\r\nphase of the problem of consanguineous marriage. The investigation of\r\nthe deaf was similar to that of the blind, but even more complete.\r\n\r\nI. The Blind. The question as to the relationship of the parents was\r\nanswered in 56,507 cases, in 2,527 or 4.47 per cent of which the\r\nparents were reported as cousins. Of the 57,726 who answered the\r\nquestion in regard to blind relatives, 10,967 or 19 per cent replied\r\nin the affirmative.[76] The blind relatives were divided into two\r\ngroups: (a) blind brothers, sisters or ancestors, and (b) blind\r\ncollateral relatives or descendants. Table XXII concisely expresses\r\nthe results most fundamental for this study.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: U.S. Census, 1900, op. cit., p. 16.]\r\n\r\n                         TABLE XXII.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                    |      |Having   |Having   |         |\r\n                    |      |Blind    |blind    |         |\r\n                    |      |relatives|relatives|Having   |\r\nConsanguinity of    |      |Class    |Class    |no blind | Not\r\nParents.            |Totals|(a).[A]  |(b).[A]  |relatives|Stated.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe blind           |64,763|  8,629  | 2,338   | 46,759  | 7,037\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTotally blind       |35,645|  4,378  | 1,215   | 26,349  | 3,703\r\nPartially blind     |29,118|  4,251  | 1,123   | 20,410  | 3,334\r\n                    |      |         |         |         |\r\nParents cousins.    |      |         |         |         |\r\n --The blind        | 2,527|     844 |   149   |  1,456  |    78\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nParents cousins.    |      |         |         |         |\r\n --Totally blind    | 1,291|     435 |    78   |    739  |    39\r\nParents cousins.    |      |         |         |         |\r\n --Partially blind  | 1,236|     409 |    71   |    717  |    39\r\n                    |      |         |         |         |\r\nParents not cousins.|      |         |         |         |\r\n --The blind        |53,980|   7,395 | 2,095   | 43,368  | 1,122\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nParents not cousins.|      |         |         |         |\r\n --Totally blind    |29,892|   3,720 | 1,090   | 24,541  |   541\r\nParents not cousins.|      |         |         |         |\r\n --Partially blind  |24,088|   3,675 |  1,005  | 18,827  |   581\r\n                    |      |         |         |         |\r\nConsanguinity not   |      |         |         |         |\r\n stated.--The blind | 8,256|     390 |     94  |  1,935  | 5,837\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nConsanguinity not   |      |         |         |         |\r\n stated.--Totally   |      |         |         |         |\r\n blind              | 4,462|     223 |     47  |  1,069  | 3,123\r\nConsanguinity not   |      |         |         |         |\r\n stated.--Partially |      |         |         |         |\r\n blind              | 3,794|     167 |     47  |    866  | 2,714\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  [A] Symbols for Blind Relatives--(a) blind brothers, sisters or\r\n      ancestors; (b) blind collateral relatives or descendants.\r\n\r\nOf the 2527 blind persons whose parents were cousins, 993 or 39.3 per\r\ncent have blind relatives, 33.4 per cent having blind brothers,\r\nsisters or ancestors, and 3.9 per cent having blind collateral\r\nrelatives or descendants. And 9 per cent of the blind who have blind\r\nrelatives are of consanguineous parentage, while but 3.1 per cent of\r\nthe blind who have no blind relatives are the offspring of cousins.\r\nThese figures alone indicate a decided intensification of blindness\r\nthrough consanguinity, although it should be remembered that a\r\nrelationship \"works both ways,\" so that when a brother has a blind\r\nsister, the sister would have a blind brother. This fact has probably\r\ndiminished the apparent number of sporadic cases of blindness.\r\n\r\nConsidered with reference to the degree of blindness the table shows\r\nthat 1291 or 51.1 per cent of the blind of consanguineous parentage\r\nare totally blind, and 1236 or 48.9 per cent are partially blind.\r\nAmong those whose parents were not cousins, 55.4 per cent were totally\r\nand 44.6 per cent were partially blind.\r\n\r\nOf the 2527 blind of consanguineous parentage, 632 or 25.0 per cent\r\nwere congenitally blind, of whom 350 or 55.4 per cent also had blind\r\nrelatives of the degrees specified. Not counting those who did not\r\nanswer the question in regard to blind relatives, we have 615 cases of\r\nwhich 51.5 per cent had blind relatives of class (a), and 5.4 per cent\r\nblind relatives of class (b). Taking the 53,980 blind whose parents\r\nwere not so related the number of congenitally blind was 3666 or but\r\n6.8 per cent, of whom 1023 or 27.9 per cent had blind relatives.\r\nOmitting as before the \"blind relatives not stated,\" we have 23.4 per\r\ncent who had blind relatives of class (a), and 4.3 per cent relatives\r\nof class (b).\r\n\r\nOn the hypothesis that consanguinity in the parents intensifies a\r\ntendency toward blindness we should expect to find among the\r\ncongenitally blind a larger proportion of consanguineous parentage\r\nthan among those blind from specific causes. In Table XXIII a general\r\nclassification of the causes of blindness is given together with the\r\nconsanguinity of parents.

The\r\n    difference in these proportions is but slight, and the relative\r\n    number of cases of blindness attributed to each of the other\r\n    causes is greater among those whose parents were not\r\n    related.[77]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: U.S. Census, 1900, op. cit., p. 17.]\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the greatest proportion is in the case of\r\nscrofula.\r\n\r\nSince it is probable that a part of those who did answer the question\r\nas to consanguinity are in fact the offspring of cousins, the\r\npercentage in each case should be somewhat increased. Allowing for\r\nthese the same proportion as for those who did answer the question we\r\nshould have of all the blind 4.47 per cent as the offspring of\r\ncousins; of the totally blind 4.14 per cent and of the partially blind\r\n4.88. While of the congenitally blind we should have 14.7 per cent as\r\noffspring of cousins.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note in this connection that in 1900, Dr. Lee\r\nWallace Dean, of the University of Iowa examined the 181 blind\r\nchildren in the Iowa College for the Blind, and found that 9 or nearly\r\n5 per cent were the offspring of first cousin marriages.[78] Dr. Dean\r\ncontinues,\r\n\r\n    If we exclude from the list those blind children who were blind\r\n    because of blennorrhea neonatorum, sympathetic opthalmia,\r\n    trachoma, etc., and consider only those who suffered because of\r\n    congenital conditions, we should find that 14 per cent were the\r\n    result of consanguineous marriage of the first  degree....\r\n    Among the pupils who have entered the college since 1900 the\r\n    percentage is about the same.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: _Effect of Consanguinity upon the Organs of Special\r\nSense_, p. 4.]\r\n\r\nThis was written in 1903, three years before the publication of Dr.\r\nBell's report.\r\n\r\nStatistics from foreign sources give even larger percentages of the\r\nblind as the offspring of consanguineous marriage. Dr. Feer quotes\r\nfourteen distinct investigations of the etiology of retinitis\r\npigmentosa, embodying in all 621 cases, of which 167 or 27 per cent\r\nwere the offspring of consanguineous parents.[79] Retinitis pigmentosa\r\nis perhaps more generally attributed to consanguineous marriage than\r\nany other specific disease of the eye, and it is to be regretted that\r\nthe Census report does not give any data in regard to this cause.\r\nRetinitis pigmentosa in known to be strongly inheritable, as is\r\nalbinism and congenital cataract.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: _Der Einfluss der Blutsverwandschaft der Eltern auf die\r\nKinder_, p. 14.]\r\n\r\nLooking now at the other side of the problem, that of the probability\r\nof consanguineous marriages producing blind offspring, we have as our\r\ndata the 2527 blind whose parents were cousins, and a conservative\r\nestimate which may be made from the data in Chapter II that 1,000,000\r\npersons in continental United States are the offspring of cousins\r\nwithin the degrees included in the Census report.[80] In the general\r\npopulation 852 per million are reported as blind, and 63 per million\r\nas congenitally blind. The actual figures for the offspring of cousin\r\nmarriages are 2527 per million for all blind and 632 per million for\r\nthe congenitally so. In other words only 0.25 per cent of the\r\noffspring of cousin marriages are blind and only 0.05 per cent are\r\ncongenitally blind. Although the probability that a child of related\r\nparents will be born blind is ten times as great (632 per million vs.\r\n63 per million) as when the parents are not related, the numbers are\r\nso small that there seems to be very little basis for a belief that\r\nconsanguinity does more than to intensify an inherited tendency,\r\nespecially since over one half of the congenitally blind of\r\nconsanguineous parentage are known to have blind relatives.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: From 1-1/2 to 2 per cent of all marriages were found to\r\nbe between cousins within the degree of second cousins, and cousin\r\nmarriages were found to be normally fertile.]\r\n\r\n2. The Deaf. The extent to which the connection between consanguineous\r\nmarriage and deaf-mutism has been studied is indicated by a table\r\ngiven by Mr. Huth, in which are set forth the results of fifty\r\ndistinct investigations.[81] In this table the percentages of\r\ndeaf-mute offspring of consanguineous marriage to the total number of\r\ndeaf-mutes investigated, varies from 30 per cent to none at all. Of\r\nthese studies not more than ten or eleven have the slightest\r\nstatistical value, and four of these--the most reliable--are from the\r\nreports of the Census of Ireland in the years 1851, 1861, 1871 and\r\n1881.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: _Marriage of Near Kin_, p. 229.]\r\n\r\nThe Irish censuses of 1891 and 1901 give similar data, though not so\r\ndetailed as in 1871 and 1881. Thus we have in these reports a census\r\ninquiry into a phase of the consanguineous marriage problem extending\r\nover the period of six successive censal years. Although we can hardly\r\nsuppose that these figures are accurate in all respects, they throw a\r\ngreat deal of light upon the problem, and are worth quoting in some\r\ndetail. The tables as given by Mr. Huth contain a number of errors of\r\ndetail, the correction of which changes the results materially.[82]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: In a subsequent article Mr. Huth corrects some of these\r\nerrors.

It\r\nwill be seen that while there has been an absolute diminution in the\r\nnumber of deaf-mutes in Ireland with the decrease in population, there\r\nhas been a relative increase of deaf-mutism. There are two possible\r\nexplanations for this phenomenon, both of which may have operated in\r\npart; first that in the great emigration the deaf-mutes have been left\r\nbehind, and second that with the introduction of improved methods of\r\ncensus taking, the returns are more complete than a half century ago.\r\nMr. Huth believes that there is still room for improvement in Irish\r\ncensus methods, and thinks there is reason to believe that in the\r\nenumeration of the deaf all children born deaf in a family are\r\nincluded whether living or not.\r\n\r\nSince Ireland is strongly Roman Catholic, the proportion of\r\nconsanguineous marriages is probably small, so that the percentage of\r\ndeafmutes derived from consanguineous marriages, varying from 5.86 to\r\n11.56 is very much greater than the percentage of these marriages in\r\nthe general population. The average number of deaf children to a\r\nfamily in Table XXIV varies less than any other part of the table, and\r\nclearly shows a much higher average number of deaf children where the\r\nparents were cousins. They reveal the interesting fact that the\r\noccurrence of two or more deafmutes in a family is more than twice as\r\nprobable where the parents are related as where they are not. Table\r\nXXV still better illustrates this point. Of the families where there\r\nwas but one deaf-mute, only 4.3 per cent were the offspring of cousin\r\nmarriages; where there were two in a family 12.9 per cent were of\r\nconsanguineous parentage; three in a family, 13.3 per cent; four in a\r\nfamily, 19.0 per cent; more than four in a family, 21.1 per cent.\r\n\r\n                      TABLE XXV.\r\n_Number of Congenital Deaf mutes to a Family in Ireland._\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     |                 | Families in which deaf-mutes numbered.\r\n     |                 |----------------------------------------\r\nYear.| Parentage.      | 1. | 2. | 3. |4.|5.|6.|7.|8.|9.|10.|11.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1851 | Parents cousins | 127| 45 | 20 |10| 5| 2|..| 1|..|.. |..\r\n1871 | Parents cousins |  91| 38 | 24 | 5| 3| 1| 1|..|..|.. |..\r\n1881 | Parents cousins |  63| 30 | 13 | 6| 1|..|..|..|..|.. |..\r\n1891 | Parents cousins |  82| 38 | 19 | 9| 1| 3| 1| 2|..|.. |..\r\n1901 | Parents cousins |  79| 34 | 23 | 7| 1|..| 1|..|..|.. |..\r\n1851 | All families[A] |2963|347 |158 |35|13| 5|..| 1|..|.. |..\r\n1871 | All families[A] |2460|305 |167 |47|20| 5| 1|..|..|.. |..\r\n1881 | All families[A] |2080|281 |162 |39|18| 6|..|..|..| 1 |..\r\n1891 | All families[A] |1473|273 |134 |40|12| 6| 1| 2|..|.. | 1\r\n1901 | All families[A] |1219|231 |122 |34|10| 4| 2|..|..|.. |..\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  [A] Number of the \"Deaf and Dumb\" to a family, \"as far as\r\n      could be ascertained.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1871 and 1881 the inquiry was more minute and the degrees of\r\nconsanguinity were specified. Mr. Huth quotes some of the figures for\r\nthese years, probably derived from the same sources as Table XXVI, and\r\ncomments as follows: \"An examination of this table will show that the\r\nstatistics so much relied upon as proving the causation of deaf-mutism\r\nby consanguineous marriages show nothing of the sort. In 1871 fourth\r\ncousins produced more deaf-mutes per marriage than any nearer\r\nrelationship. In 1881 third cousins produced more than any nearer\r\nrelationship.\"[83] Mr. Huth forgets that he is basing these statements\r\non five and nine families respectively, and does not take into\r\nconsideration the probability that if the returns are biased, as he\r\nsuspects, this bias would affect the more distantly related,\r\nrelatively more than the first cousin marriages, for the same reason\r\nthat this would be true of the cases collected by Dr. Bemiss.[84]\r\nCombining the figures of the two censal years helps to correct these\r\naverages, and the distantly related show approximately the same\r\naverage as the first cousin marriages in spite of the vastly greater\r\nselection which must have obtained in the distantly related cases.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: Huth, _Marriage of Near Kin_, p. 227.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: _Cf. supra_, p. 42.]\r\n\r\nIn Table XXVI it will be seen that 52.5 per cent of the deaf-mute\r\noffspring of consanguineous parents were the offspring of first cousin\r\nmarriages. On the assumption that this percentage is fairly typical of\r\neach set of returns we may say that from three to six per cent of the\r\nIrish deaf-mutes are the offspring of first cousin marriages. If,\r\nthen, the proportion of first cousin marriages is no greater than in\r\nEngland, the percentage of deaf-mute offspring is several times as\r\ngreat as in the average non-related marriage.\r\n\r\n                             TABLE XXVI.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n              |        1871       |        1881       |  1871 and 1881\r\n              |-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n              |      |Number|     |      |Number|     |      |Number|\r\n              |      | of   |Aver |      | of   |Aver |      | of   |Aver\r\n              |Number|conge-|age  |Number|conge-|age  |Number|conge-|age\r\nConsanguinity | of   |nital |per  | of   |nital |per  | of   |nital |per\r\n     of       |mar-  |deaf- |mar- |mar-  |deaf- |mar- |mar-  |deaf- |mar-\r\n  Parents.    |riages|mutes |riage|riages|mutes |riage|riages|mutes |riage\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFirst cousins |   72 |  128 | 1.78|   74 |  123 | 1.66|  146 |  251 | 1.72\r\nSecond cousins|   50 |   89 | 1.78|   29 |   46 | 1.58|   79 |  135 | 1.71\r\nThird cousins |   24 |   40 | 1.67|    9 |   21 | 2.33|   33 |   61 | 1.85\r\nFourth cousins|    5 |   11 | 2.20|    1 |    1 |  -- |    6 |   12 | 2.00\r\nFifth and     |      |      |     |      |      |     |      |      |\r\nsixth cousins |   12 |   19 | 1.58|    not stated     |   12 |   19 | 1.58\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTotal         |  163 |  287 | 1.76|  113 |  191 | 1.69|  276 |  478 | 1.73\r\nNo            |      |      |     |      |      |     |      |      |\r\nrelation-     |      |      |     |      |      |     |      |      |\r\nship[A]       |2,842 |3,609 | 1.27|2,474 |3,229 | 1.31|5,316 |6,838 | 1.29\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGrand total   |3,005 |3,896 | 1.30|2,587 |3,420 | 1.32|5,592 |7,316 | 1.31\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  [A] See Table XXV.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland Dr. Arthur Mitchell made inquiry of the superintendents of\r\na number of deaf-mute asylums, and found that of 544 deaf-mutes, 28\r\nwere the offspring of 24 consanguineous marriages.[85] There were 504\r\nfamilies represented in all, so that the average per family was 1.17\r\namong the consanguineous to 1.07 among the non-consanguineous.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Huth, op. cit., p. 226.]\r\n\r\nIn Norway, according to Uchermann, while 6.9 per cent of all marriages\r\nare consanguineous within and including the degree of second cousins,\r\nand in single cantons the percentages range as high as 31.0, only in\r\none single district does the number of the deaf-mutes harmonize with\r\nthat of the marriage of cousins. The district of Saeterdalen has the\r\ngreatest number of consanguineous marriages (201 out of 1250), but not\r\na single case of deaf-mutism. Hedemarken, which has the fewest\r\nconsanguineous marriages has a great many deaf-mutes. Where\r\ndeaf-mutism exists it seems to be intensified by consanguinity, but\r\nwhere it is not hereditary it is not caused by consanguinity. Of the\r\n1841 deaf-mutes in Norway, 919 were congenitally deaf, and of these\r\n212 or 23 per cent were of consanguineous parentage.[86]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: _Les Sourds-muets en Norvège_. Quoted by Feer, _Der\r\nEinfluss der Blutsverwandschaft der Eltern auf die Kinder_, p. 22.]\r\n\r\nDr. Feer gives a table containing the results of a number of studies\r\nof deaf-mutism, which shows an average of 20 per cent as of\r\nconsanguineous origin. Four investigations give the number of children\r\nto a family. Table XXVII from Feer seems to indicate that the Irish\r\ncensus is fairly accurate at this point.[87]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Feer, op. cit., p. 22.]\r\n\r\n             TABLE XXVII.\r\n_Average Number of Children to a Family._\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n                    |Consanguineous|\"Crossed\"\r\nObserver.           | marriages.   |marriages.\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nHuth (Irish Census) |   1.68       |  1.17\r\nWilhelmi            |   1.71       |  1.26\r\nMygind              |   1.53       |  1.20\r\nUchermann           |   1.41       |  1.19\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn the American Census the instructions to enumerators have been so\r\ndiverse that statistics of the deaf have been very poor until recent\r\nyears. Not until the Twelfth Census was the inquiry put upon a really\r\nscientific basis.\r\n\r\nThis reform, as also the more intelligent attitude of the American\r\npeople in general towards the affliction of deafness, is due largely\r\nto the work of Dr. Alexander Graham Bell. An enumeration of Dr. Bell's\r\nservices directly, and through the agency of the Volta Bureau, in this\r\ncause, cannot be given here. For our purpose the most important of his\r\ncontributions is embodied in the Special Report of the Twelfth Census\r\nof the United States already referred to.\r\n\r\nAs in the investigation of the Blind, the circular letter sent to each\r\nperson reported by the enumerators as deaf contained questions in\r\nregard to parentage and the existence of deaf relatives. It is\r\nunfortunate that in these returns it is impossible to distinguish\r\nbetween degrees of relationship, but in such an extensive compilation\r\nit was doubtless impracticable to attempt to unravel the intricacies\r\nof consanguinity. Judging from the returns of the Census of Ireland we\r\nmay assume that about half of the cases returned as \"cousins\" were\r\nfirst cousins.\r\n\r\nThe replies to the inquiry as to deaf relatives were more carefully\r\nanalyzed, and were divided into four groups, which are referred to\r\nthroughout as (a), (b), (c) and (d) relatives. These groups are: (a),\r\ndeaf brothers, sisters or ancestors; (b), deaf uncles, aunts, cousins\r\nor other relatives not (a), (c) or (d); (c), deaf children, (sons or\r\ndaughters); (d), deaf husbands or wives. Thus a large proportion of\r\nthe hereditary cases would be included in the first two categories,\r\n(a) and (b).[88]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: U.S. Census _Report on the Blind and the Deaf_, p. 127.]\r\n\r\nThe causes of deafness are given in detail, but as might be expected\r\nthe returns are not as definite or as accurate as we should desire.\r\nThe causes given have been grouped under five main heads; these again\r\nare subdivided, often into divisions numerically too minute for real\r\nstatistical value. Table XXVIII includes the main groups and those\r\nspecific causes which number more than 3000 cases. The extreme\r\nvariation in the percentages of those who are the offspring of\r\nconsanguineous marriages cannot be attributed to mere chance. There is\r\nclearly some fundamental connection between consanguinity and\r\ncongenital deafness if 11.8 per cent of all the congenitally deaf are\r\nthe offspring of consanguineous marriages, while of the adventitiously\r\ndeaf but 3.1 per cent are the offspring of such marriages. In fact we\r\nare tempted to jump at the conclusion that consanguinity is in itself\r\na cause of deaf-mutism. Furthermore 42.1 per cent of the deaf whose\r\nparents were cousins were congenitally deaf, while this was true of\r\nbut 15 per cent of those whose parents were unrelated.\r\n\r\n                      TABLE XXVIII.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                           |      |                    |\r\n                           |      |    Consanguinty    |\r\n                           |      |     of Parents.    |    Per cent.\r\n                           |      |--------------------|-----------------\r\n                           |      |      |      |      |     |     |\r\n     Cause of Deafness.    |      |      | Not  | Not  |     | Not | Not\r\n                           |Total.|Cous- |Cous- | Sta- |Cous-|Cous-| Sta-\r\n                           |      | ins. | ins. | ted. | ins.| ins.| ted.\r\n---------------------------|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----\r\n                           |      |      |      |      |     |     |\r\n  Total                    |89,287| 4,065|75,530| 9,692|  4.5| 84.6| 10.9\r\n---------------------------|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----\r\nAffections of external ear |   871|    29|   760|    82|  3.3| 87.3|  9.4\r\nAffections of middle ear   |34,801| 1,238|30,824| 2,739|  3.5| 88.6|  7.9\r\nAffections of internal ear |12,295|   343|11,121|   831|  2.8| 90.4|  6.8\r\nUnclassified               |31,205| 2,183|25,281| 3,741|  7.0| 81.0| 12.0\r\nUnknown                    |10,115|   272| 7,544| 2,299|  2.7| 74.6| 22.7\r\n                           |      |      |      |      |     |     |\r\nScarlet fever              | 7,424|   285| 6,647|   492|  3.9| 89.5|  6.6\r\nDisease of ear             | 4,210|   222| 3,683|   305|  5.3| 87.5|  7.2\r\nCatarrh                    |11,702|   304|10,450|   948|  2.6| 89.3|  8.1\r\nColds                      | 3,074|    81| 2,666|   327|  2.6| 86.7| 10.7\r\nMeningitis                 | 3,991|    83| 3,741|   167|  2.1| 93.7|  4.2\r\nOld age                    | 3,361|    38| 2,369|   954|  1.1| 70.5| 28.4\r\nMilitary service           | 3,242|    40| 2,897|   305|  1.2| 89.4|  9.4\r\nCongenital                 |14,472| 1,710|11,322| 1,440| 11.8| 78.2| 10.0\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, 53.4 per cent of the deaf whose parents were\r\ncousins had deaf relatives of the (a) and (b) groups, while of those\r\nwhose parents were not cousins, only 29.9 per cent in these groups had\r\ndeaf relatives.

Where there is\r\nthe largest amount of deafness in the family the percentage of\r\nconsanguinity is the highest. That is, of those who had both (a) and\r\n(b) relatives ten per cent were the offspring of cousins, while of\r\nthose who had neither (a) nor (b) relatives only three per cent were\r\nthe offspring of cousins. It is natural to assume that as a rule where\r\nthe deaf have either (a) or (b) deaf relatives, deafness is\r\nhereditary, for the probability of two cases of deafness occurring in\r\nthe same family, uninfluenced by heredity would be very small. It is\r\nlikely also that a great many of the deaf who stated that they had no\r\ndeaf relatives were mistaken, for few people are well enough informed\r\nin regard to their ancestry to answer this question definitely. Not\r\none man in thousands can even name all of his great-grandparents, to\r\nsay nothing of describing their physical or mental traits. Others may\r\nhave understood the inquiry to refer only to living relatives and\r\ntherefore have omitted almost all reference to their ancestors. These\r\npossible errors might easily explain all the excess of the percentage\r\nof consanguinity among those reported as having no deaf relatives over\r\nthe probable percentage of consanguineous marriage in the general\r\npopulation. But this very probability that comparatively few deaf\r\nancestors have been reported increases the probability that the\r\ngreater part of the (a) relatives were brothers and sisters rather\r\nthan ancestors. Now of the 26,221 deaf having deaf relatives, 17,345\r\nhave only (a) relatives, and if these are largely living brothers and\r\nsisters the relationship would \"work both ways,\" so that if there were\r\ntwo deaf children in a family, each would have an (a) deaf relative.\r\nIn the Census of Ireland figures above quoted it will be remembered\r\nthat among families which were the offspring of cousins the proportion\r\nhaving two or more deaf children was three times as great as among\r\nthose who were not the offspring of consanguineous unions. If this\r\nfollows in America, it largely accounts for the high percentage of the\r\ncongenitally deaf who are the offspring of cousin marriages, and\r\nespecially of those who have (a) deaf relatives.\r\n\r\n                         TABLE  XXX.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                 |       |    Consanguinity      |\r\n                 |       |     of Parents.       |   Per Cent.\r\n                 |       |----------------------------------------------\r\nClass of Deaf    |       |       | Not   | Not   |       | Not   | Not\r\n Relatives.[A]   |Total. |Cousins|Cousins|stated |Cousins|Cousins|stated\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTotal            |14,472 | 1,710 | 11,322| 1,440 | 11.8  | 78.2  |10.0\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStated           |13,428 | 1,647 | 11,110|   671 | 12.3  | 82.7  | 5.0\r\nNot stated       | 1,044 |    63 |    212|   769 |  6.0  | 20.3  |76.7\r\n(a) relatives    | 5,295 |   986 |  3,961|    48 | 18.6  | 74.8  | 6.6\r\n(b) and (c) but  |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n no (a) relatives|   860 |   126 |    686|    48 | 14.6  | 79.8  | 5.6\r\nNo (a), (b) or   |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n (c) relatives   | 7,273 |   535 |  6,463|   275 |  7.3  | 88.9  | 3.8\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  [A] Symbols for deaf relatives: (a) deaf brothers, sisters or\r\n      ancestors; (b) deaf uncles, aunts, cousins, etc.; (c) deaf children.\r\n\r\nA further analysis of the congenitally deaf according to consanguinity\r\nof parents and deaf relatives, as in Table XXX, helps to determine to\r\nwhat extent the greater number of deaf children to a family among the\r\noffspring of consanguineous marriages has influenced the totals. From\r\nthe report it cannot be determined how many of the congenitally deaf\r\nhad (a), (b) or (c) relatives alone, but the existence of (b) and (c)\r\nrelatives would almost certainly indicate that the deafness was\r\nhereditary. Of these 14.6 per cent were the offspring of cousins,\r\nwhile of those having (a) relatives 18.6 per cent were the offspring\r\nof consanguineous unions. Thus it would seem to be a more reasonable\r\nconclusion that where two or more deaf-mutes appear in the same\r\nfamily, at least a tendency toward deaf-mutism is hereditary in the\r\nfamily and is intensified by the marriage of cousins, rather than that\r\nconsanguineous marriage is in itself a cause. The fact that in many\r\ncases the relationship would \"work both ways\" would not greatly affect\r\nthe percentage of the offspring of cousins having (b) and (c)\r\nrelatives, for the chance would be slight that the (b) or (c) relative\r\nwould be himself the offspring of a consanguineous marriage. Among the\r\ncongenitally deaf who reported no deaf relatives, the percentage of\r\nconsanguineous parentage is still high, (7.3 per cent), but this\r\nexcess can easily be accounted for by the ignorance of deaf relatives\r\non the part of the informant, without contradicting the hypothesis of\r\nheredity.\r\n\r\nBasing now our percentages on the totals of consanguineous and\r\nnon-consanguineous parentage respectively, and including only those\r\nwho answered the inquiry as to deaf relatives, it will be seen (Table\r\nXXXI) that while of all the deaf less than one third are returned as\r\nhaving deaf relatives, of the deaf who were the offspring of cousins\r\nover one half (55.5 per cent) were returned as having (a) or (b) deaf\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\nAgain taking into consideration only the congenitally deaf the results\r\nare still more striking. Table XXXII shows that 66.5 per cent of the\r\ncongenitally deaf who are of consanguineous parentage are known to\r\nhave deaf relatives.\r\n\r\n                     TABLE XXXI.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                         |      |Consanguinity  |\r\n                         |      | of Parents.   |     Per cent.\r\n                         |      |-------------------------------------\r\n                         |      |       |Not    |     |       |Not\r\nClass of Deaf Relatives. |Total.|Cousins|Cousins|Total|Cousins|Cousins\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDeaf relatives stated    |80,481| 3,911 |73,639 |100.0|100.00 |100.00\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n(a) relatives            |21,660| 1,850 |18,838 | 26.9| 47.3  | 25.5\r\nNo (a) relatives         |58,821| 2,061 |54,801 | 73.1| 52.7  | 74.5\r\n                         |      |       |       |     |       |\r\n(a) or (b) relatives     |25,851| 2,171 |22,552 | 32.1| 55.5  | 30.6\r\n(a) and (b) relatives    | 4,117|   412 | 3,587 |  5.1| 10.5  |  4.8\r\n(a) and no (b) relatives |17,543| 1,438 |15,251 | 21.8| 36.8  | 20.7\r\n(b) and no (a) relatives | 4,191|   321 | 3,714 |  5.2|  8.2  |  5.1\r\nNo (a) or (b) relatives  |54,630| 1,740 |51,087 | 67.9| 44.5  | 69.4\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSymbols for deaf relatives: (a) deaf brothers, sisters or ancestors;\r\n (b) deaf uncles, aunts, cousins, etc.; (c) deaf children;\r\n (d) deaf husbands or wives.\r\n\r\n                         TABLE XXXII.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                            |      |Consanguinity  |\r\n                            |      |of Parents.    |    Per cent.\r\n                            |      |-------------------------------------\r\n                            |      |       |Not    |     |       |Not\r\nClass of Deaf Relatives     |Total.|Cousins|Cousins|Total|Cousins|Cousins\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDeaf relatives stated       |13,428| 1,647 |11,110 |100.0|100.0  |100.0\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n(a) relatives               | 5,295|   986 | 3,961 | 39.5| 59.9  | 35.6\r\n(b) or (c), no (a) relatives|   860|   126 |   686 |  6.4|  7.6  |  6.2\r\nNo (a), (b) or (c) relatives| 7,273|   535 | 6,463 | 54.2| 32.5  | 58.2\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSymbols for deaf relatives: (a) deaf brothers, sisters or ancestors;\r\n (b) deaf uncles, aunts, cousins, etc.; (c) deaf children.\r\n\r\nThe percentage having (a) relatives, including brothers, and sisters,\r\nis nearly twice as great among the deaf of consanguineous parentage as\r\namong the offspring of unrelated parents.

Counting only the 3,078 marriages of which information in\r\nregard to offspring was available these figures show an average of a\r\nlittle less than one such marriage in ten as productive of deaf\r\noffspring. The total number of children of these marriages was 6,782,\r\nof which 588 were deaf. These 3,078 marriages represented 5,199 deaf\r\nmarried persons as compared with the 31,334 reported in the Twelfth\r\nCensus, or about one sixth. Increasing the 300 families who had deaf\r\nchildren in the same ratio we have 1800 as compared with the 437\r\nreported by the census. But as it was inevitable that Dr. Fay's cases\r\nshould be selected somewhat, he has probably collected records of more\r\nthan one sixth of all the cases where deaf children were born of deaf\r\nparents. But we can hardly believe that he found three-fourths of such\r\ncases. The true number therefore must be considerably greater than\r\n437, but less than 1800.[90]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: _Marriages of the Deaf in America_, chap. v.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: Of the 17 children of first cousins reported on my\r\ncirculars as either totally or partially deaf, 9 are known to have had\r\ndeaf ancestors.]\r\n\r\nDr. Fay found that 31 out of the 4,471 marriages of the deaf were\r\nconsanguineous, but he expresses the belief that the actual number\r\nand percentage of consanguineous marriages of the deaf are larger. The\r\nfollowing table which combines several of Dr. Fay's tables sets forth\r\nthe main results of his work. In each instance one or both parties to\r\nthe marriage were deaf. The totals include only those of whom\r\ninformation as to the offspring was available.\r\n\r\n                    TABLE XXXIV.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n                    |      | Marriages |\r\n                    |      | resulting |\r\n                    |      |  in deaf  |\r\n                    |      | offspring |  Deaf children\r\n                    |Number|-----------|------------------\r\n   Consanguineous   |of    |      |    |             |Per\r\n     Marriages      |mar-  |      |Per |      |Number|Cent\r\n    of the Deaf.    |riages|Number|Cent|Number|Deaf  |Deaf\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\nFirst cousins       |    7 |   4  | 57.|   26 |    7 | 27.\r\nSecond cousins      |    5 |   3  | 60.|   25 |   10 | 40.\r\nThird cousins       |    1 |   1  | -- |    1 |    1 | --\r\n\"Cousins\"           |   14 |   3  | 21.|   36 |    7 | 19.\r\nNephew and aunt     |    1 |   1  | -- |    4 |    3 | 75.\r\nDistantly related   |    3 |   2  | 67.|    8 |    2 | 25.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\nTotal consanguineous|   31 |  14  | 45.|  100 |   30 | 30.\r\nNot consanguineous, |      |      |    |      |      |\r\n or no information  |3,047 | 286  |  9.|6,682 |  558 |  8.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\nGrand total         |3,078 | 300  | 10.|6,782 |  588 |  9.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nObviously percentages based on these figures are of little value of\r\nthemselves, especially since Dr. Fay's cases are not entirely typical,\r\nbut in general this table points us to the same conclusion that we\r\nhave reached by other means, namely that where a tendency toward\r\ndeafness exists, a consanguineous marriage is more likely to produce\r\ndeaf children than a non-consanguineous marriage. If more figures were\r\navailable the percentage of deaf children would probably increase with\r\nthe nearness of consanguinity and the number of deaf relatives, but\r\nwith the present data a further analysis has no significance.[91]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Mr. Edgar Schuster (_Biometrika_, vol. iv, p. 465) finds\r\nfrom Dr. Fay's statistics that the average parental correlation\r\n(parent and child) of deafness is: paternal, .54; maternal, .535.\r\nEnglish statistics of deafness give: paternal correlation, .515;\r\nmaternal, .535. The fraternal correlation from the American data is\r\n.74 and from the English .70. See _infra_, p. 92.]\r\n\r\nIf, then, consanguineous marriages where relatives are deaf have a\r\ngreater probability of producing deaf offspring, and also a greater\r\nprobability of producing plural deaf offspring, than ordinary\r\nmarriages, and two thirds of the congenitally deaf offspring of\r\nconsanguineous marriages do have deaf relatives, it does not seem\r\nnecessary to look beyond the law of heredity for an explanation of the\r\nhigh percentage of the congenitally deaf who are of consanguineous\r\nparentage.\r\n\r\nIn those cases of deafness which, in the Census returns, are ascribed\r\nto specific causes, the factor of consanguinity is still noticeable,\r\nalthough the percentage of the non-congenitally deaf who are the\r\noffspring of cousins never exceeds 5.3 (Table XXVIII). But the\r\ninfluence of heredity is not removed by the elimination of the\r\ncongenitally deaf. Many instances are known where successive\r\ngenerations in the same family have developed deafness in adult life,\r\noften at about the same age and from no apparent cause. The following\r\ncase well illustrates this point. It is furnished me by a\r\ncorrespondent in whom I have great confidence. The facts are these:\r\nA---- aged 28 married B---- aged 19, his first cousin who bore the\r\nsame surname as himself. Both lived to old age and were the parents of\r\neight children, two of whom died in infancy. My informant further\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n    Having personally known very well all of the surviving six\r\n    children of this family, I can truthfully state that all were\r\n    unusually strong, active and vigorous people and all the\r\n    parents of healthy children. A---- was troubled with deafness\r\n    as long as I can remember, and this physical trait he\r\n    transmitted to all of his children, though some of them did not\r\n    develop the same till well along in life. C---- (the youngest\r\n    son), however, began to indicate deafness quite early. No one\r\n    of his four children is in the least deaf.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed here that whereas in the case of the cousin\r\nmarriage the trait was so strongly inherited, it disappeared entirely\r\nin the next generation with a non-consanguineous marriage. The\r\ninheritance of tendencies or weaknesses may be more common than the\r\nactual inheritance of defects. Dr. Bell's words on this point are\r\nsuggestive:\r\n\r\n    Where a tendency toward ear trouble exists in a family, it may\r\n    lie dormant and unsuspected until some serious illness attacks\r\n    some member of the family, when the weak spot is revealed and\r\n    deafness is produced. We are not all built like that wonderful\r\n    one-horse shay that was so perfectly made in all its parts that\r\n    when at last it broke down it crumbled into dust. When an\r\n    accident occurs it is the weak spot that gives way, and it\r\n    would be incorrect to attribute the damage to the accident\r\n    alone and ignore the weakness of the part; both undoubtedly are\r\n    contributing causes.\r\n\r\n    In the case, then, of a deaf person who has deaf relatives, the\r\n    assigned cause of deafness may not be the only cause involved,\r\n    or indeed the true cause at all. It may be the cause simply in\r\n    the same sense that the pulling of a trigger is the cause of\r\n    the expulsion of a bullet from a rifle, or a spark the cause of\r\n    the explosion of a gunpowder magazine; hereditary influences\r\n    may be involved.[92]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: U.S. Census _Report on the Blind and the Deaf_, p. 127.]\r\n\r\nIt is thus possible to account for the large proportion of deafness\r\namong persons of consanguineous parentage by the simple action of the\r\nlaws of heredity. Why then should we go out of our way to look for a\r\ncause of the defect in consanguinity itself? When two explanations are\r\npossible, the simpler explanation is the more probable, other factors\r\nbeing equal; but in the present problem the factors are not equal, for\r\nthe evidence points strongly toward the simpler hypothesis of\r\nintensified heredity, while there is little or no evidence that\r\nconsanguinity is a cause _per se_.\r\n\r\nAs to the probability then of a consanguineous marriage producing deaf\r\noffspring, it will readily be seen to be very slight, and in those\r\ncases where there is actually no trace of hereditary deafness in the\r\nfamily, perhaps no greater than in non-related marriages. While the\r\ncensus figures in regard to the deaf are not complete they probably\r\ninclude a great majority of the deaf in the United States. The 89,287\r\ndeaf would mean an average of 12 deaf persons to every 10,000\r\ninhabitants and the 14,472 congenitally deaf, 2 persons to every\r\n10,000. Assuming then, as before[93] that 1,000,000 persons in\r\ncontinental United States are the offspring of consanguineous\r\nmarriages within the limits of the term \"cousins\" as used in the\r\nCensus report, 41 out of every 10,000 persons of consanguineous\r\nparentage would be deaf, and 17 congenitally so. Thus less than one\r\nhalf of one per cent of the offspring of consanguineous marriages in\r\nthe United States are deaf, and only one sixth of one per cent are\r\ndeaf-mutes in the commonly accepted sense of the term.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: _Supra_, p. 64.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting here to quote an opinion given by Dr. Bell in 1891,\r\nas to the probable results of the consanguineous marriage of deaf\r\npersons.[94]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: _Marriage--An Address to the Deaf_, second edition,\r\nAppendix.]\r\n\r\n    1. A deaf person, not born deaf, who has no deaf relatives,\r\n    will probably not increase his liability to have deaf offspring\r\n    by marrying a blood relative.\r\n\r\n    2. A deaf person, born deaf, who has no deaf relatives, will\r\n    probably increase his liability to have deaf offspring by\r\n    marrying a blood relative.\r\n\r\n    3. A deaf person, whether born deaf or not, who has deaf\r\n    relatives, will probably increase his liability to have deaf\r\n    offspring by marrying a blood relative, especially if that\r\n    relative should happen to be on the deaf side of the family.\r\n    For example: If his father has deaf relatives and his mother\r\n    has none, he will be more likely to have deaf offspring if he\r\n    marries a relative of his father than if he marries a relative\r\n    of his mother.\r\n\r\n    The laws of heredity seem to indicate that a consanguineous\r\n    marriage increases or intensifies in the offspring whatever\r\n    peculiarities exist in the family. If a family is\r\n    characterized by the large proportion of persons who enjoy\r\n    good health and live to old age with unimpaired faculties,\r\n    then a consanguineous marriage in such a family would probably\r\n    be beneficial, by increasing and intensifying these desirable\r\n    characteristics in the offspring. On the other hand, if a\r\n    large proportion of the members of a family betray weakness of\r\n    constitution--for example: if many of the children die in\r\n    infancy, and a large proportion of the others suffer from ill\r\n    health, only a few living to old age with unimpaired\r\n    faculties--then a consanguineous marriage in such a family\r\n    would probably be hurtful to the offspring. A large\r\n    proportion of the children would probably die in infancy, and\r\n    the survivors be subject to some form of constitutional\r\n    weakness.\r\n\r\n    As there are few families entirely free from constitutional\r\n    defects of some kind, a prudent person would do well to avoid\r\n    consanguineous marriage in any case--not necessarily on account\r\n    of deafness, but on account of the danger of weakening the\r\n    constitution of the offspring. Remoteness of blood is eminently\r\n    favorable to the production of vigorous offspring, and those\r\n    deaf persons who have many deaf relatives would greatly\r\n    diminish their liability to have deaf offspring by marrying\r\n    persons very remote in blood from themselves.\r\n\r\n    Children, I think, tend to revert to the type of the common\r\n    ancestors of their parents. If the nearest common ancestors are\r\n    very far back in the line of ancestry, the children tend to\r\n    revert to the common type of the race. Deafness and other\r\n    defects would be most likely to disappear from a family by\r\n    marriage with a person of different nationality. English,\r\n    Irish, Scotch, German, Scandinavian and Russian blood seems to\r\n    mingle beneficially with the Anglo-Saxon American, apparently\r\n    producing increased vigor in the offspring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus considered the more important problems which have been\r\nconnected with the marriage of near kin, we have only to discuss the\r\nbearing of the conclusions thus formed upon the social aggregate, and\r\nthe effect which consanguineous marriages have upon the evolution and\r\nimprovement of the human species.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the frequency with which consanguineous\r\nmarriages occur varies greatly with the physical and social\r\nenvironments; that such marriages are more frequent in isolated and in\r\nrural communities than in cities; and that with the increasing range\r\nof individual activity and acquaintance the relative frequency of\r\nconsanguineous marriage is decreasing.\r\n\r\nConsanguinity in the parents has no perceptible influence upon the\r\nnumber of children or upon their masculinity, and has little, if any,\r\ndirect effect upon the physical or mental condition of the offspring.\r\n\r\nThe most important physiological effect of consanguineous marriage is\r\nto intensify any or all inheritable family characteristics or\r\npeculiarities by double inheritance. The degree of intensification\r\nprobably varies with the nature of the characteristic; degenerate\r\nconditions of the mind, and of the delicate organs of special sense\r\nbeing the most strongly intensified.\r\n\r\nIt is probable also that in the absence of degenerative tendencies\r\nthe higher qualities of mind and body are similarly intensified by\r\nmarriage between highly endowed members of the same family. Dr.\r\nReibmayr believes that inbreeding is necessary to the higher evolution\r\nof the race: \"A settled abode, natural protection from race mixture\r\nand the development of a closely inbred social class are the basic\r\nconditions of every culture period.\" But inbreeding must not be\r\ncarried too far: \"In the course of generations the ruling class begins\r\nto degenerate mentally and physically, until not only is the class\r\ndestroyed, but for lack of capable leadership the people (Volk) itself\r\nis subjugated and a crossing of blood again takes place.\"[95]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: Trans. from _Insucht und Vermischung beim Menschen_, p.\r\n46.]\r\n\r\nIn the breeding of animals the closest inbreeding is frequently\r\nresorted to in order to improve the stock, and many examples can be\r\ngiven of the closest possible inbreeding for generations without\r\napparent detriment, but it is universally admitted that the animals\r\nselected for such inbreeding must be sound constitutionally, and free\r\nfrom disease. After a certain number of generations however,\r\ndegeneration apparently sets in. The number of generations through\r\nwhich inbreeding may be carried varies with the species, and the\r\npurpose for which the animals are bred. Where they are bred primarily\r\nfor their flesh, as for beef, mutton or pork, it can be pursued\r\nfarther and closer than where they are bred for achievement in which a\r\nspecial strength is required--for instance in the breeding of race\r\nhorses. This would indicate that the more delicate brain and nervous\r\nsystem is sooner affected than the lower bodily functions.\r\n\r\nIn man, however, freedom from hereditary taint cannot so easily be\r\nsecured. Individuals cannot be selected scientifically for breeding\r\npurposes. Furthermore, the human body is more delicately constructed\r\nthan that of the lower animals, and the nervous system is more highly\r\ndeveloped and specialized, so that it is reasonable to suppose that in\r\nman degeneration would set in earlier in the process of inbreeding,\r\nand that it would be impossible to breed as closely as with the lower\r\nanimals. Instances are well known, however, where incestuous unions\r\nhave been productive of healthy offspring, and successive generations\r\nof offspring of incestuous connection are not unknown; but, although\r\nstatistics are lacking, it seems to be very often true that children\r\nof such unions are degenerate. It may be that the reason for this is\r\nthat with the laws and social sentiments now prevailing in all\r\ncivilized communities, only degenerates ever contract incestuous\r\nalliances. Desirable as it may be from a social point of view that\r\nthis strong sentiment against incest should continue, it is not yet\r\n_proven_ that even the closest blood relationship between the parents\r\nis directly injurious to the offspring. The \"instinctive horror of\r\nincest\" is a myth, for although a horror of incest does very properly\r\nexist in civilized, and in some tribal societies, it is purely a\r\nmatter of custom and education, and not at all a universal law.\r\n\r\nDouble heredity may account for all the observed ill effects of\r\nconsanguineous marriage, including the high youthful death-rate, the\r\nhigher percentage of idiocy, deafness and blindness, and probably also\r\nthe scrofulous and other degenerate tendencies; nevertheless, there\r\nmay be in some instances a lowering of vitality which this hypothesis\r\ndoes not fully explain.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of inbreeding in animals, it is well known, is to fix the\r\ntype, the tendency of crossing, to variation. Inbreeding then, tends\r\nto become simple repetition with no natural variations in any\r\ndirection, a stagnation which in itself would indicate a comparatively\r\nlow vitality. Variation and consequent selection is necessary to\r\nprogress. \"Sex,\" according to Ward[96] \"is a device for keeping up a\r\ndifference of potential,\" and its object is not primarily\r\nreproduction, but variation.[97]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: _Pure Sociology_, p. 232.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Pearson (_Grammar of Science_, p. 373) points out that\r\nvariation does occur in asexual reproduction. But that sex is at least\r\na powerful stimulus to variation can hardly be questioned.]\r\n\r\n    It is organic differentiation, higher life, progress,\r\n    evolution.... But difference of potential is a social as well\r\n    as a physiological and physical principle, and perhaps we shall\r\n    find the easiest transition from the physiological to the\r\n    social in viewing the deteriorating effects of close inbreeding\r\n    from the standpoint of the environment instead of from that of\r\n    the organism. A long-continued uniform environment is more\r\n    deteriorating than similarity of blood. Persons who remain for\r\n    their whole lives, and their descendants after them, in the\r\n    same spot, surrounded by precisely the same conditions, and\r\n    intermarry with others doing the same, and who continue this\r\n    for a series of generations, deteriorate mentally at least, and\r\n    probably also physically, although there may not be any mixing\r\n    of blood. Their whole lives, physical, mental, and moral,\r\n    become fixed and monotonous, and the partners chosen for\r\n    continuing the race have nothing new to add to each other's\r\n    stock. There is no variation of the social monotony, and the\r\n    result is socially the same as close consanguineal\r\n    interbreeding. On the other hand, a case in which a man should,\r\n    without knowing it, marry his own sister, after they had been\r\n    long separated and living under widely different skies, would\r\n    probably entail no special deterioration, and their different\r\n    conditions of life would have produced practically the same\r\n    effect as if they were not related.[98]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Ward, op. cit., pp. 234-235.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Ward's idea of \"difference of potential,\" or contrast, as\r\nessential to the highest vigor of the race as well as to that of the\r\nindividual offspring, offers an alternative explanation of the\r\nobserved results of consanguineous marriages, and one which does not\r\nnecessarily conflict with the explanation already given. All the\r\nphenomena of intensification are simply due to a resemblance between\r\nhusband and wife in particular characteristics, such as a common\r\ntendency toward deafness or toward mental weakness. This resemblance,\r\nwhich may or may not be the result of a common descent, renders more\r\nprobable the appearance of the trait in the offspring. If the parents\r\nclosely resembled each other in many respects they would be more\r\nlikely to \"breed true\" and the children would resemble one another in\r\ntheir inherited traits, thus accounting for the high average of\r\ndeaf-mutes to the family, observed in the Irish statistics.[99]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: _Cf. supra_, p. 66.]\r\n\r\nThe theory of contrast and resemblance supplements that of intensified\r\nheredity where the resemblance is general, rather than in particular\r\ntraits or characteristics. In such a case the absence of the\r\nstimulating effects of contrast might result in a lowering of\r\nvitality, which in turn would react upon the youthful death-rate.\r\n\r\nWhere then related persons differ greatly in mental and physical\r\ntraits, and generally speaking, belong to different types, it is very\r\nimprobable that there would be any ill effects resulting from the mere\r\nfact of consanguinity. A case in point is furnished me by a\r\ncorrespondent. A first cousin marriage which turned out exceedingly\r\nwell was between strongly contrasted individuals; the husband was\r\n\"short, stocky and dark complexioned\" while the wife was \"tall, slight\r\nof figure, and of exceedingly light complexion.\" In other cases in\r\nwhich the results were not so good the husband and wife bore a close\r\nresemblance to one another, physically and mentally.\r\n\r\nThis, however, does not agree with the results obtained by Professor\r\nKarl Pearson. Basing his conclusions on the correlation of stature\r\nbetween husband and wife, he believes that homogamy is a factor of\r\nfertility. Taking 205 marriages from Mr. Francis Galton's _Family\r\nRecords_, Professor Pearson found the correlation between husband and\r\nwife to be .0931 ± .0467, while weighted by their fertility the\r\ncorrelation was .1783 ± .0210, practically doubling the intensity of\r\nassortative mating.[100] The value of these correlations, however, is\r\nimpaired, as he says, by the insufficient number of observations, and\r\nby the fact that absolutely taller mothers are the more fertile.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: _Royal Society Proceedings_, vol. 66, p. 30.]\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent investigation of from 1000 to 1050 pairs of parents of\r\nadult children, Professor Pearson found the correlation in stature to\r\nbe .2804 ± .0189; of span .1989 ± .0204; and of forearm .1977 ± .0205;\r\nwith cross coefficients varying from .1403 to .2023. If, as he\r\nbelieves, \"The parents of adult children are on the average more alike\r\nthan first cousins, then it follows that any evils which may flow from\r\nfirst cousin marriage depend not on likeness of characters, but on\r\nsameness of stock.\"[101]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: _Biometrika_, vol. ii, p. 373.]\r\n\r\nBut even if it were true, as is very improbable, that parents of adult\r\nchildren are more alike than first cousins, it would still be likely\r\nto follow that first cousins who married would be more alike than\r\nfirst cousins in general. A certain degree of resemblance is\r\nundoubtedly necessary to complete fertility: husband and wife must be\r\nphysically compatible, and must both enjoy a certain degree of health\r\nand physical strength. These facts are admitted by all, but it does\r\nnot follow that resemblance beyond a certain point is not in itself\r\ndetrimental.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pearson's own experiments in this line, however, do not\r\ngive consistent results, for in correlating eyecolor with fertility,\r\nheterogamy seems to increase fertility. The highest average fertility\r\n(4.57) is in those cases where the father is dark-eyed and the mother\r\nlight-eyed, while the lowest is where both parents have blue-green or\r\ngray eyes.[102]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: _Phil. Trans. of the Royal Society_, vol. 195 A, p.\r\n150.]\r\n\r\nIn a recent study an attempt has been made to measure the coefficient\r\nof correlation between cousins.[103] In the characteristics of health,\r\nsuccess, temper and intelligence the coefficients ranged between .25\r\nand .30. These values differ but little from those found to obtain for\r\nthe resemblance between avuncular relatives for eye color (.265), or\r\nbetween grandparent and grandchild for the same characteristic\r\n(.3164).[104] Positive results were also found, with one doubtful\r\nexception, for the occurrence of insanity and tuberculosis in cousins.\r\nThe writer concludes: \"The grandparent, the uncle and aunt, and the\r\ncousin are on practically the same footing with regard to relationship\r\nor intensity of kinship as measured by degree of likeness of\r\ncharacter; and it seems probable that any scientific marriage\r\nenactments would equally allow or equally forbid marriage between\r\ngrandparent and grandchild, uncle and niece, aunt and nephew, and\r\nbetween first cousins.\"[105]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: Elderton and Pearson, \"On the Measure of the\r\nResemblance of First Cousins.\" _Eugenics Laboratory Memoirs IV._\r\nReviewed in _Br. Med. Journal_, Feb. 15, 1908.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: _Phil. Trans. of the Royal Society_, vol. 195 A, p.\r\n106.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: Elderton and Pearson, op. cit.]\r\n\r\nAs we should expect the resemblance between near relatives has been\r\nfound to be much greater. From a measurement of from 4000 to 4886\r\npairs, the average correlation of the characteristics of stature,\r\nspan, forearm length and eyecolor between parent and child was .4695.\r\nBy similar computations and measuring the same characteristics, the\r\nfraternal correlation was found to be .508.[106] From measurements of\r\na greater variety of characteristics in school children the mean\r\nfraternal correlation was .539.[107] In athletic power the coefficient\r\nwas still higher, .72 between brothers, .75 between sisters and\r\n.49 between brothers and sisters. Measurements of mental\r\ncharacteristics--vivacity, assertiveness, introspection, popularity,\r\nconscientiousness, temper, ability and handwriting proved to be as\r\neasily correlated, the mean coefficients being; brothers, .52,\r\nsisters .51, brothers and sisters .52.[108]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: Pearson and Lee, \"On the Laws of Inheritance in Man,\"\r\n_Biometrika_, vol. ii, p. 387.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: Ibid., p. 388.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: Pearson, \"On the Laws of Inheritance in Man,\" part 2,\r\n_Biometrika_, vol. iii, p. 154.]\r\n\r\nThe relative amount of degeneracy and disease among the offspring of\r\nconsanguineous marriages has been enormously exaggerated, and the\r\ndanger is by no means as great as is popularly supposed. Nevertheless,\r\nsince it is undoubtedly true that on the average such marriages do not\r\nproduce quite as healthy offspring as do non-consanguineous unions,\r\nand since public sentiment is already opposed to the marriage of\r\ncousins, it is perhaps just as well that existing laws on the subject\r\nshould remain in force. From the standpoint of eugenics however, it is\r\nmuch more important that the marriage of persons affected with\r\nhereditary disease should be prevented. Dr. Bell has pointed out the\r\ndanger of producing a deaf-mute race by the intermarriage of\r\ncongenitally deaf persons,[109] and this warning should be made to\r\napply to other congenital defects as well. Some states already\r\nprohibit the marriage of the mentally defective, and persons under the\r\ninfluence of intoxicants. Such provisions are wise, and are the most\r\npractical means of achieving eugenic ideals--by preventing the\r\npropagation of the unfit. The interests of society demand that the\r\nmentally and physically defective should not propagate their kind.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: \"Memoir upon the Formation of a Deaf Variety of the\r\nHuman Race.\" _Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences_, vol. ii,\r\npp. 177-262.]\r\n\r\nFrom the broader viewpoint of social evolution the problems of\r\ninbreeding or crossing of stocks merge into the discussion of the\r\nendogamous and exogamous types of society. Whatever may have been the\r\norigin of exogamy, the survival of the exogamous type in progressive\r\nsocieties may easily be explained on the ground of superior\r\nadaptability, variability and plasticity, which enables such societies\r\nto survive a change of environment while the more rigid structure of\r\nthe endogamous clan brings about its extermination.\r\n\r\nInbreeding leads to caste formation and a rigid and stratified social\r\nstructure, which is in the end self-destructive, and cannot survive a\r\nchange of environment. The governing caste may, as Reibmayr says,\r\nfavor the growth of culture, but it is usually the culture of that\r\ncaste, and not of the people at large. The ruling caste is usually the\r\nresult of selection of the strongest and ablest, but after it becomes\r\na caste, the individuals are selected on account of hereditary social\r\nposition and not primarily on account of ability. Now biological\r\nexperiments show that although artificial selection may be carried to\r\na point where animals will breed true to a characteristic to within 90\r\nper cent, yet if selection is stopped, and the descendants of the\r\nselected individuals are allowed to breed freely among themselves,\r\nthey will in a very few generations revert to the original type. This\r\nis what happens in a social caste, unless, as in the case of the\r\nEnglish aristocracy, it is continually renewed by selection of the\r\nablest of the other classes.\r\n\r\nThe superposition and crossing of cultures, the development of\r\nsecondary civilization, is necessary to social evolution in its\r\nbroadest sense, and this usually involves crossing of blood as well as\r\ncrossing of cultures. As a result of the unprecedented migrations of\r\nthe last half-century we have in the United States the greatest\r\nvariety of social types ever brought so closely together. An\r\nopportunity is offered either for the perpetuation of each racial type\r\nby inbreeding, with the prospect of an indefinite stratification of\r\nsociety, or for the amalgamation of all cultural and racial elements\r\ninto a homogeneous whole, and the development of a race more versatile\r\nand adaptable than any the world has yet known. The general tendency\r\nwill undoubtedly be toward amalgamation, but there are decided\r\ntendencies in the other direction, as for instance in the \"first\r\nfamilies of Virginia,\" and in that large element of the New England\r\npopulation which prides itself upon its exclusively Puritan ancestry,\r\nand which has inherited from its progenitors that intolerance which\r\ncharacterized the early settlers of New England more than the pioneers\r\nof the other colonies. The dynamic forces of modern civilization are,\r\nhowever, opposed to caste--the West has long ago obliterated the\r\ndistinction between the Pennsylvania German and the Puritan, the\r\nScotch-Irish and the Knickerbocker Dutch. These same dynamic forces,\r\nwhich have prevented the formation of caste have at the same time been\r\ndiminishing the percentage of consanguineous marriage and will\r\nundoubtedly continue to operate in the same way for some time to come.\r\nAnd when rational laws prohibit the marriage of the diseased and the\r\ndegenerate, the problem of consanguineous marriage will cease to be of\r\nvital importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nBarr, M.W. _Mental Defectives._ Philadelphia, 1904.\r\n\r\nBell, A.G. _Marriage--An Address to the Deaf._ Second Edition.\r\n  Washington, 1891.\r\n\r\n  _Memoir upon the Formation of a Deaf Variety of the Human Race._\r\n  Washington, 1884.\r\n\r\nBemiss, S.M. \"Report on the Influence of Marriages of Consanguinity\r\n  upon Offspring.\" In _Transactions of the American Medical\r\n  Association_, vol. xi, 1858, pp. 319-425.\r\n\r\nBoudin, J.C.M.F.J. \"Du Croisement des families, des races et de\r\n  espèces.\" In _Memoires de la Société d'Anthropologie_, vol. i.\r\n  Paris, 1860-1863.\r\n\r\nChild, G.W. \"On Marriages of Consanguinity.\" _In Medico-Chirurgical\r\n  Review_, Apr. 1862, pp. 461-471.
