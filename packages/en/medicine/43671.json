The two\r\nvolumes may be referred to conveniently as the first and second of a\r\n‘History of Epidemics in Britain.’ In adhering to the plan of a systematic\r\nhistory instead of annals I have encountered more difficulties in the\r\nsecond volume than in the first. In the earlier period the predominant\r\ninfection was Plague, which was not only of so uniform a type as to give\r\nno trouble, in the nosological sense, but was often so dramatic in its\r\noccasions and so enormous in its effects as to make a fitting historical\r\ntheme. With its disappearance after 1666, the field is seen after a time\r\nto be occupied by a numerous brood of fevers, anginas and other\r\ninfections, which are not always easy to identify according to modern\r\ndefinitions, and were recorded by writers of the time, for example\r\nWintringham, in so dry or abstract a manner and with so little of human\r\ninterest as to make but tedious reading in an almost obsolete phraseology.\r\nDescriptions of the fevers of those times, under the various names of\r\n_synochus_, _synocha_, nervous, putrid, miliary, remittent, comatose, and\r\nthe like, have been introduced into the chapter on Continued Fevers so as\r\nto show their generic as well as their differential character; but a not\r\nless important purpose of the chapter has been to illustrate the condition\r\nof the working classes, the unwholesomeness of towns, London in\r\nparticular, the state of the gaols and of the navy, the seasons of dearth,\r\nthe times of war-prices or of depressed trade, and all other vicissitudes\r\nof well-being, of which the amount of Typhus and Relapsing Fever has\r\nalways been a curiously correct index. It is in this chapter that the\r\nepidemiology comes into closest contact with social and economic history.\r\nIn the special chapter for Ireland the association is so close, and so\r\nuniform over a long period, that the history may seem at times to lose its\r\ndistinctively medical character.\r\n\r\nAs the two first chapters are pervaded by social and economic history, so\r\neach of the others will be found to have one or more points of distinctive\r\ninterest besides the strictly professional. Smallpox is perhaps the most\r\nsuitable of all the subjects in this volume to be exhibited in a\r\ncontinuous view, from the epidemics of it in London in the first Stuart\r\nreigns to the statistics of last year. While it shares with Plague the\r\nmerit, from a historical point of view, of being always the same definite\r\nitem in the bills of mortality, it can be shown to have experienced, in\r\nthe course of two centuries and a half, changes in its incidence upon the\r\nclasses in the community, upon the several age-periods and upon town and\r\ncountry, as well as a very marked change relatively to measles and\r\nscarlatina among the infective scourges of infancy and childhood. For\r\ncertain reasons Smallpox has been the most favoured infectious disease,\r\nhaving claimed an altogether disproportionate share of interest at one\r\ntime with Inoculation, at another time with Vaccination. The history of\r\nthe former practice, which is the precedent for, or source of, a whole new\r\nambitious scheme of prophylaxis in the infectious diseases of men and\r\nbrutes, has been given minutely. The latter practice, which is a radical\r\ninnovation inasmuch as it affects to prevent one disease by the\r\ninoculation of another, has been assigned as much space in the chapter on\r\nSmallpox as it seems to me to deserve. Measles and Whooping-cough are\r\nhistorically interesting, in that they seem to have become relatively more\r\nprominent among the infantile causes of death in proportion as the public\r\nhealth has improved. Whooping-cough is now left to head the list of its\r\nclass by the shrinkage of the others. It is in the statistics of Measles\r\nand Whooping-cough that the principle of population comes most into view.\r\nThe scientific interest of Scarlatina and Diphtheria is mainly that of\r\nnew, or at least very intermittent, species. Towards the middle of the\r\n18th century there emerges an epidemic sickness new to that age, in which\r\nwere probably contained the two modern types of Scarlet Fever and\r\nDiphtheria more or less clearly differentiated. The subsequent history of\r\neach has been remarkable: for a whole generation Scarlatina could prove\r\nitself a mild infection causing relatively few deaths, to become in the\r\ngeneration next following the greatest scourge of childhood; for two whole\r\ngenerations Diphtheria had disappeared from the observation of all but a\r\nfew medical men, to emerge suddenly in its modern form about the years\r\n1856-59.\r\n\r\nThe history of Dysentery, as told by the younger Heberden, has been a\r\nfavourite instance of the steady decrease of a disease in London during\r\nthe 18th century. I have shown the error in this, and at the same time\r\nhave proved from the London bills of mortality of the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies that Infantile Diarrhoea, which is now one of the most important\r\ncauses of death in some of the great manufacturing and shipping towns, was\r\nformerly still more deadly to the infancy of the capital in a hot summer\r\nor autumn. Asiatic Cholera brings us back, at the end of the history, to\r\nthe same great problem which the Black Death of the 14th century raised\r\nnear the beginning of it, namely, the importation of the seeds of\r\npestilence from some remote country, and their dependence for vitality or\r\neffectiveness in the new soil upon certain favouring conditions, which\r\nsanitary science has now happily in its power to withhold. I have left\r\nInfluenza to be mentioned last. Its place is indeed unique among epidemic\r\ndiseases; it is the oldest and most obdurate of all the problems in\r\nepidemiology. The only piece of speculation in this volume will be found\r\nin the five-and-twenty pages which follow the narrative of the various\r\nhistorical Influenzas; it is purely tentative, exhibiting rather the\r\n_disjecta membra_ of a theory than a compact and finished hypothesis. If\r\nthere is any new light thrown upon the subject, or new point of view\r\nopened, it is in bringing forward in the same context the strangely\r\nneglected history of Epidemic Agues.\r\n\r\nOther subjects than those which occupy the nine chapters of this volume\r\nmight have been brought into a history of epidemics, such as Mumps,\r\nChickenpox and German Measles, Sibbens and Button Scurvy, together with\r\ncertain ordinary maladies which become epidemical at times, such as\r\nPneumonia, Erysipelas, Quinsy, Jaundice, Boils and some skin-diseases.\r\nWhile none of these are without pathological interest, they do not lend\r\nthemselves readily to the plan of this book; they could hardly have been\r\nincluded except in an appendix of _miscellanea curiosa_, and I have\r\npreferred to leave them out altogether. It has been found necessary, also,\r\nto discontinue the history of Yellow Fever in the West Indian and North\r\nAmerican colonies, which was begun in the former volume.\r\n\r\nI have, unfortunately for my own labour, very few acknowledgements to make\r\nof help from the writings of earlier workers in the same field. My chief\r\nobligation is to the late Dr Murchison’s historical introduction to his\r\n‘Continued Fevers of Great Britain.’ I ought also to mention Dr Robert\r\nWillan’s summary of the throat-distempers of the 18th century, in his\r\n‘Cutaneous Diseases’ of 1808, and the miscellaneous extracts relating to\r\nIrish epidemics which are appended in a chronological table to Sir W. R.\r\nWilde’s report as Census Commissioner for Ireland. For the more recent\r\nhistory, much use has naturally been made of the medical reports compiled\r\nfor the public service, especially the statistical.\r\n\r\n_September,

James Lind, in 1761, that a judicious synopsis of\r\nthe writings on fevers, in a chronological sense, would be a valuable\r\nbook: it would bring to light, he was fain to expect, treasures of\r\nknowledge; “and perhaps the influence of a favourite opinion, or of a\r\npreconceived fancy, on the writings of some even of our best instructors,\r\nsuch as Sydenham and Morton, would more clearly be perceived[1].” Lind\r\nhimself was the person to have delivered such a history and criticism. He\r\nwas near enough to the 17th century writers on fevers to have entered\r\ncorrectly into their points of view; while so far as concerned the\r\ndetection of theoretical bias or preconceived fancies, he had shown\r\nhimself a master of the art in his famous satire upon the “scorbutic\r\nconstitution,” a verbal or mythical construction which had been in great\r\nvogue for a century and a half, and was still current, at the moment when\r\nLind destroyed it, in the writings of Boerhaave and Haller. A judicious\r\nhistorical view of the English writings on fevers, such as this 18th\r\ncentury critic desired to see, may now be thought superfluous. The\r\ntheories, the indications for treatment, the medical terms, have passed\r\naway and become the mere objects of a learned curiosity. But the actual\r\nhistory of the old fevers, of their kinds, their epidemic prevalence,\r\ntheir incidence upon rich or poor, upon children or adults, their\r\nfatality, their contagiousness, their connexion with the seasons and other\r\nvicissitudes of the people--all this is something more than curious.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the historian of diseases, he has to look for the\r\nrealities amidst the “favourite opinions” or the “preconceived fancies” of\r\ncontemporary medical writers. Statements which at first sight appear to be\r\nobservations of matters of fact are found to be merely the necessary\r\ntruths or verbal constructions of some doctrine. One great doctrine of the\r\n17th and 18th centuries was that of obstructions: in this doctrine, as\r\napplied to fevers, obstructions of the mesentery were made of central\r\nimportance; the obstructions of the mesentery extended to its lymphatic\r\nglands; so that we come at length, in a mere theoretical inference, to\r\nsomething not unlike the real morbid anatomy of enteric fever. Another\r\ngreat doctrine of the time, specially applied by Willis to fevers, was\r\nthat of fermentations and acrimonies. “This ferment,” says a Lyons\r\ndisciple of Willis in 1682, “has its seat in the glandules of the velvet\r\ncoat of the stomach and intestines described by Monsieur Payer[2].” But\r\nthe Lyons physician is writing all the while of the fevers that have\r\nalways been common in the Dombes and Bresse, namely intermittents; the\r\ntertian, double tertian, quotidian, quartan, or double quartan paroxysm\r\narises, he says, from the coagulation of the humours by the ferment which\r\nhas its seat in the glandules described by M. Payer, even as acids cause a\r\ncoagulation in milk, the paroxysm of ague continuing, “until this sharp\r\nchyle be dissipated and driven out by the sweat or insensible\r\nperspiration.” The lymphatic follicles of the intestine known by the name\r\nof Payer, or Peyer, were then the latest anatomical and physiological\r\nnovelty, and were chosen, on theoretical grounds, as the seat of\r\nfermentation or febrile action in agues. On the ground of actual\r\nobservation they were found about a century and a half after to be the\r\nseat of morbid action in typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nWhile there are such pitfalls for the historian in identifying the several\r\nspecies of fevers in former times, there are other difficulties of\r\ninterpretation which concern the varieties of a continued fever, or its\r\nchanges of type from generation to generation. Is change of type a reality\r\nor a fiction? And, if a reality, did it depend at all upon the use or\r\nabuse of a certain regimen or treatment, such as blooding and lowering, or\r\nheating and corroborating? A pupil of Cullen, who wrote his thesis in\r\n1782 upon the interesting topic of the change in fevers since the time of\r\nSydenham[3], inferred that the great physician of the Restoration could\r\nnot have had to treat the low, putrid or nervous fevers of the middle and\r\nlatter part of the 18th century, otherwise he would not have resorted so\r\nregularly to blood-letting, a practice which was out of vogue in continued\r\nfevers at the time when the thesis was written, as well as for a good many\r\nyears before and after. Fevers, it was argued, had undergone a radical\r\nchange since the time of Sydenham, in correspondence with many changes in\r\ndiet, beverages and creature comforts, such as the greatly increased use\r\nof tea, coffee and tobacco, and of potatoes or other vegetables in the\r\ndiet, changes also in the proportion of urban to rural population, in the\r\nuse of carriages, and in many other things incident to the progressive\r\nsoftening of manners. In due time the low, putrid, nervous type of typhus\r\nfever, which is so much in evidence in the second half of the 18th\r\ncentury, ceased to be recorded, an inflammatory type, or a fever of strong\r\nreaction, taking its place; so that Bateman, of London, writing in 1818,\r\nsaid: “The putrid pestilential fevers of the preceding age have been\r\nsucceeded by the milder forms of infectious fever which we now witness”;\r\nwhile Armstrong, Clutterbuck, and others, who had revived the practice of\r\nblood-letting in fevers shortly before the epidemic of 1817-18, claimed\r\nthe comparatively slight fatality and short duration of the common fever\r\nof the time as an effect of the treatment. After 1831, typhus again became\r\nlow, depressed, spotted, not admitting of the lancet; on which occasion\r\nthe doctrine of “change of type” was debated in the form that the older\r\ngeneration of practitioners still remember.\r\n\r\nThus the task of the historian, whose first duty is to ascertain, if he\r\ncan, the actual matters of fact, or the realities, in their sequence or\r\nchronological order, is made especially difficult, in the chapter on\r\ncontinued fevers, by the contemporary influence of theoretical pathology\r\nor “a preconceived fancy,” by the ascription of modifying effects to\r\ntreatment, whether cooling or heating, lowering or supporting, and, most\r\nof all, by the absence of that more exact method which distinguishes the\r\nrecords of fever in our own time. Nor can it be said that the work of\r\nhistorical research has been made easier in all respects, by the exact\r\ndiscrimination and perfected diagnosis to which we are accustomed in\r\npresent-day fevers. In the years between 1840 and 1850, the three grand\r\ntypes of fever then existing in Britain, namely, spotted typhus, enteric,\r\nand relapsing fever, were at length so clearly distinguished, defined and\r\ndescribed that no one remained in doubt or confusion. Thereupon arose the\r\npresumption that these had always been the forms of continued fever in\r\nBritain, and that the same fevers, presumably in the same relative\r\nproportions to each other, might have been left on record by the\r\nphysicians of former generations, if they had used the modern exactness\r\nand minuteness in observing both clinical history and anatomical state,\r\nwhich were seen at their best in Sir William Jenner. It would simplify\r\nhistory, indeed it would make history superfluous, if that were really the\r\ncase. There are many reasons for believing that it was not the case. As\r\nSydenham looked forward to his successors having experiences that he never\r\nhad, so we may credit Sydenham with having really seen things which we\r\nnever see, not even those of us who saw the last epidemics of relapsing\r\nfever and typhus. It is due to him, and to his contemporaries and nearest\r\nsuccessors, to reciprocate the spirit in which he concludes the general\r\nchapter on epidemics prefatory to his annual constitutions from 1661 to\r\n1676:\r\n\r\n    “I am far from taking upon myself the credit of exhausting my subject\r\n    in the present observations. It is highly probable that I may fail\r\n    even in the full enumeration of the epidemics. Still less do I warrant\r\n    that the diseases which during the years in question have succeeded\r\n    each other in the sequence about to be exhibited shall remain the same\r\n    in all future years. One thing most especially do I aim at. It is my\r\n    wish to state how things have gone lately; how they have been in this\r\n    country, and how they have been in this the city which we live in. The\r\n    observations of some years form my ground-work. It is thus that I\r\n    would add my mite, such as it is, towards the foundation of a work\r\n    that, in my humble judgment, shall be beneficial to the human race.\r\n    Posterity will complete it, since to them it shall be given to take\r\n    the full view of the whole cycle of epidemics in their mutual\r\n    sequences for years yet to come[4].”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe epidemic fever of 1661, according to Willis.\r\n\r\nOn the very threshold of the period at which the history is resumed in\r\nthis volume, we find a minute account by Willis of an epidemic in the year\r\n1661, which at once raises the question whether a certain species of\r\ninfectious fever did really exist at that time which exists no longer, or\r\nwhether Willis described as “a fever of the brain and nervous stock” what\r\nwe now call enteric fever. Willis’s fever corresponds in every respect to\r\nthe worm fever, the comatose fever, the remittent fever of children, the\r\nacute fever with dumbness, the convulsive fever, which was often recorded\r\nby the medical annalists and other systematic observers as late as the\r\nbeginning of the 19th century[5]. It ceased at length to be recorded or\r\ndescribed, and it has been supposed that it was really the infantile or\r\nchildren’s part of enteric fever, which had occurred in former times as\r\nnow[6]. The epidemic fever which Willis saw in the summer of 1661, after a\r\nclear interval of two years from the great epidemics of agues, with\r\ninfluenzas, in 1657-59, is called by him “a certain irregular and\r\nunaccustomed fever[7].” It was not, however, new to him altogether; for he\r\nhad seen the same type, and kept notes of the cases, in a particular\r\nhousehold at Oxford in 1655, as well as on other occasions. It was an\r\nepidemical fever “chiefly infestous to the brain and nervous stock.” It\r\nraged mostly among children and youths, and was wont to affect them with a\r\nlong and, as it were, a chronical sickness. When it attacked the old or\r\nmiddle-aged, which was more rarely, it did sooner and more certainly kill.\r\nIt ran through whole families, not only in Oxford and the neighbouring\r\nparts, “but in the countries at a great distance, as I heard from\r\nphysicians dwelling in other places.” Among those other witnesses, we\r\nshall call Sydenham; but meanwhile let us hear Willis, whose account is\r\nthe fullest and least warped by theory.\r\n\r\n    Its approach was insidious and scarce perceived, with no immoderate\r\n    heat or sharp thirst, but producing at length great debility and\r\n    languishing, loss of appetite and loathing. Within eight days there\r\n    were brain symptoms--heavy vertigo, tingling of the ears, often great\r\n    tumult and perturbation of the brain. Instead of phrensy, there might\r\n    be deep stupidity or insensibility; children lay sometimes a whole\r\n    month without taking any notice of the bystanders, and with an\r\n    involuntary flux of their excrements; or there might be frequent\r\n    delirium, and constantly absurd and incongruous chimaeras in their\r\n    sleep. But in men a fury, and often-times deadly phrensy, did succeed.\r\n    If, however, neither stupidity nor great distraction did fall upon\r\n    them, swimmings in the head, convulsive movements, with convulsions of\r\n    the members and leaping up of the tendons did grievously infest them.\r\n    In almost all, there were loose and stinking motions, now yellow, now\r\n    thin and serous; vomiting was unusual; the urine deep red. The\r\n    sufferers in this prolonged sickness wasted to a skeleton, with no\r\n    great heat or evacuations to account for the wasting. Some, at the end\r\n    of the disease, had a severe catarrh. In others, with little infection\r\n    of the head, soon after the beginning of the fever a cruel cough and a\r\n    stinking spittle, with a consumptive disposition, grew upon them, and\r\n    seemed to throw them suddenly into a phthisis, from which, however,\r\n    they recovered often beyond hope. In some there were swellings of the\r\n    glands near the hinder part of the neck, which ripened and broke, and\r\n    gave out a thin stinking ictor for a long time. “I have also seen\r\n    watery pustules excited in other parts of the body, which passed into\r\n    hollow ulcers, and hardly curable. Sometimes little spots and\r\n    _petechiales_ appeared here and there.” But none of the spots were\r\n    broad and livid, nor were there many malignant spots.\r\n\r\n    Willis then gives several cases clinically, in his usual manner. The\r\n    first is of a strong and lively young man, who was sick above two\r\n    months and seemed near death, but began to mend and took six weeks to\r\n    recover, sweating every night or every other night of his convalescent\r\n    period. The second case, aged twelve, was restored to health in a\r\n    month. Numbers three and four were children of a nobleman, who both\r\n    died, the convulsive type being strongly marked; one of the two was\r\n    examined after death, and found to have several sections of the small\r\n    intestine telescoped, but all the abdominal viscera free from\r\n    disease[8], the lungs engorged, the vessels of the brain full, much\r\n    water in the sub-arachnoid space, and more than half a pint in the\r\n    lateral ventricles.\r\n\r\n    In farther illustration of this type of fever, epidemic in 1661,\r\n    Willis goes back to his notes of a sporadic outbreak of what he thinks\r\n    was the same disease in a certain family at Oxford in the winter of\r\n    1653-4[9]: “yea I remember that sometime past very many laboured with\r\n    such a fever.” In the family in question, five children took the fever\r\n    one after another during a space of four months, two of the cases\r\n    proving fatal; the domestics also took it, and some strangers who came\r\n    in to help them, “the evil being propagated by contagion.” The cases\r\n    in the children are fully recorded[10], the following being some of\r\n    the symptoms:\r\n\r\n    In case 1, aged seven, the illness began at the end of December, 1653\r\n    (or 1655): there were contractions of the wrist tendons, red spots\r\n    like fleabites on his neck and other parts, drowsiness, and\r\n    involuntary passage of the excrements. At the end of a fortnight, a\r\n    flux set in and lasted for four days; next, after that, a whitish\r\n    crust or scurf, as it were chalky, began to spread over the whole\r\n    cavity of his mouth and throat, which being often in a day wiped away,\r\n    presently broke forth anew. He mended a little, but had paralysis of\r\n    his throat and pharynx, was reduced to a living skeleton, but at\r\n    length got well.\r\n\r\n    Case 2, a brother, aged nine, had frequent loose and highly putrid\r\n    motions on the eleventh day; and next day, the flux having ceased, the\r\n    most severe colic, so that he lay crying out day and night, his belly\r\n    swollen and hard as a drum, until, on the 24th day, he died in an\r\n    agony of convulsions.\r\n\r\n    Case 3, a brother, aged 11, was taken with similar symptoms on the\r\n    13th February, and died on the 13th day.\r\n\r\n    Case 4, a sister, was taken ill in March, with less marked symptoms,\r\n    and recovered slowly, having had no manifest crisis.\r\n\r\n    Case 5, a boy of the same family, and the youngest, fell ill about the\r\n    same time as No. 4, and after the like manner, “who yet, a looseness\r\n    arising naturally of itself, for many days voiding choleric and\r\n    greenish stuff, was easily cured.”\r\n\r\n    Then comes a general reference to the domestics and visitors, who fell\r\n    sick of the same and all recovered.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged series of cases in the household of this “venerable man”\r\nappears to have made a great impression upon Willis, as something new in\r\nhis experience, as well as in the experience of several other physicians\r\nwho gave their services. That it was malignant he considers proved “ex\r\ncontagio, pernicie, macularum pulicularum apparentia, multisque aliis\r\nindiciis.” He adds that he had seen the same disease sporadically at other\r\ntimes; and again “I remember that formerly several laboured under such a\r\nfever.” Those cases were all previous to the general prevalence of the\r\nfever which he identifies with them in the summer of 1661, under the name\r\nof a “fever of the brain and spinal cord.”\r\n\r\nThe signs given by Willis are as nearly as may be the signs of infantile\r\nremittent fever, or worm fever, or febris synochus puerorum, or hectica\r\ninfantilis, or febris lenta infantum, or an acute fever with dumbness, of\r\nwhich perhaps the first systematic account in this country was given by Dr\r\nWilliam Butter of Lower Grosvenor Street, in 1782[11]. It is, he says,\r\nboth a sporadical and an epidemical disease, “and when epidemical it is\r\nalso contagious.” The age for it is from birth up to puberty; but “similar\r\nsymptoms are often observed in the disorders of adults.” Morton, writing\r\nin 1692-94, clearly points to the same fever under the name of worm fever\r\n(febris verminosa). He adds it at the very end of his scheme of fevers, as\r\nif in an appendix, having been unable to find a place for it in any of his\r\ncategories owing to its varying forms--hectic, acute, intermittent,\r\ncontinued, συνεχής, inflammatory, but for the most part colliquative or\r\nσύνοχος, “and malignant according to the varying degrees of the venomous\r\nmiasm causing it[12].” Butter also recognizes its varying types: it has\r\nmany symptoms, but they seldom all occur in the same case; there are three\r\nmain varieties--the acute, lasting from eight to ten days up to two or\r\nthree weeks; the slow, lasting two or three months; and the low, lasting\r\na month or six weeks. The slow form, he says, is only sporadic; the low is\r\nonly epidemic, and is never seen but when the acute is also epidemical; it\r\nis rare in comparison with the latter, and not observed at all except in\r\ncertain of the epidemical seasons. Waiving the question whether the\r\nremittent fever of children, thus systematically described, was not a\r\ncomposite group of maladies, of which enteric fever of children was one,\r\nwe can hardly doubt that Willis found a distinctive uniform type in the\r\nepidemic of 1661, in Oxford as he saw it himself, in other parts of\r\nEngland by report. It had symptoms which were not quite clearly those of\r\nenteric fever: spots, like fleabites, on the neck and other parts,\r\nswelling and suppuration of the glands in the hinder part of the neck,\r\neffusion of fluid on the brain and in the lateral ventricles, and the\r\nintestine free from disease[13].\r\n\r\nConfirming Willis’s account for Oxford, is the case of Roger North, when a\r\nboy at Bury St Edmunds Free School in 1661, as related by himself in his\r\n‘Autobiography[14].’ Being then “very young and small,” after a year at\r\nschool he had “an acute fever, which endangered a consumption.” Elsewhere\r\nhe attributes his bad memory with “confusion and disorder of thought,” to\r\nthat “cruel fit of sickness I had when young, wherein, I am told, life was\r\ndespaired of, and it was thought part of me was dead; and I can recollect\r\nthat warm cloths were applied, which could be for no other reason, because\r\nI had not gripes which commonly calls for that application.” That “great\r\nviolence of nature,” while it had impaired his mental faculties, had\r\nsapped his bodily vigour somewhat also, of which he gives a singular\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nThis special prevalence of epidemic fevers in the summer and autumn of\r\n1661 is noticed also by the London diarists.\r\n\r\nEvelyn says that the autumn of 1661 was exceedingly sickly and wet[15].\r\nPepys has several entries of fever[16]. On 2 July, 1661: “Mr Saml. Crewe\r\ndied of the spotted fever.” On 16 August: “At the [Navy] Office all the\r\nmorning, though little to do; because all our clerks are gone to the\r\nburial of Tom Whitton, one of our Controller’s clerks, a very ingenious\r\nand a likely young man to live as any in the office. But it is such a\r\nsickly time both in the city and country everywhere (of a sort of fever)\r\nthat never was heard of almost, unless it was in a plague-time. Among\r\nothers the famous Tom Fuller [of the ‘Worthies of England’] is dead of it;\r\nand Dr Nichols [Nicholas], Dean of St Paul’s; and my Lord General Monk is\r\nvery dangerously ill.” On 31 August: “The season very sickly everywhere of\r\nstrange and fatal fevers.” On 15 January, 1662: “Hitherto summer weather,\r\nboth as to warmth and every other thing, just as if it were the middle of\r\nMay or June, which do threaten a plague (as all men think) to follow; for\r\nso it was almost the last winter, and the whole year after hath been a\r\nvery sickly time to this day.”\r\n\r\nThe great medical authority of the time is Sydenham. His accounts of the\r\nseasons and reigning diseases of London extend from 1661 to 1686, so that\r\nthey begin with the year for which Willis described the epidemic fever\r\n“chiefly infestous to the brain and nervous stock,” popularly called the\r\nnew disease. But Sydenham did not describe the epidemic in the same\r\nobjective way that Willis did. He records a series of “epidemic\r\nconstitutions of the air,” the particular constitution of each year being\r\nnamed from the epidemic malady that seemed to him to dominate it most. It\r\nwas, perhaps, because it had to conform to Sydenham’s “preconceived\r\nfancy,” as Lind said, that his account of the dominant type of fever in\r\n1661 differs somewhat from that given by Willis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSydenham’s epidemic Constitutions.\r\n\r\nSydenham adopted the epidemic constitutions from Hippocrates, as he did\r\nmuch else in his method and practice. In the first and third books of the\r\n‘Epidemics,’ Hippocrates describes three successive seasons and their\r\nreigning diseases in the island of Thasos, as well as a fourth\r\nplague-constitution which agrees exactly with the facts of the plague of\r\nAthens as described by Thucydides. The Greek term translated\r\n“constitution” is κατάστασις, which means literally a settling,\r\nappointing; ordaining, and in the epidemiological sense means the type of\r\nreigning disease as settled by the season. The method of Hippocrates is\r\nfirst to give an account of the weather--the winds, the rains, the\r\ntemperature and the like,--and then to describe the diseases of the\r\nseasons[17]. Sydenham followed his model with remarkable closeness. The\r\ngreat plague of London has almost the same place in his series of years\r\nthat the plague-constitution, the fourth in order, has in that of\r\nHippocrates. It looks, indeed, as if Sydenham had begun with the year\r\n1661, more for the purpose of having several constitutions preceding that\r\nof the plague than because he had any full observations of his own to\r\nrecord previous to 1665. He is also much influenced by the example of\r\nHippocrates in giving prominence to the intermittent type of fevers. It\r\nwas remarked by one of our best 18th century epidemiologists, Rogers of\r\nCork, and with special reference to Sydenham’s “intermittent\r\nconstitutions,” that fevers proper to the climate of Thasos were not\r\nlikely to be identified in or near London excepted by a forced\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n_Sydenham’s Constitutions._\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n      |                         | Total |      | Fever |        |       |\r\n      |       Constitutions     | deaths|Plague|  and  |Smallpox|Measles|\r\n      |                         |   in  |      |Spotted|        |       |\r\n      |                         | London|      | Fever |        |       |\r\n  ----|-------------------------|-------|------|-------|--------|-------|\r\n  1661|“Intermittent”           | 16,665|    20| 3,490 |  1,246 |  188  |\r\n  1662|  constitution: with a   | 13,664|    12| 2,601 |    768 |   20  |\r\n  1663|  continued fever        | 12,741|     9| 2,107 |    411 |   42  |\r\n  1664|  throughout.            | 15,453|     5| 2,258 |  1,233 |  311  |\r\n      |                         |       |      |       |        |       |\r\n  1665|Constitution of plague   | 97,306|68,596| 5,257 |    655 |    7  |\r\n  1666|  and pestilential fever.| 12,738| 1,998|   741 |     38 |    3  |\r\n      |                         |       |      |       |        |       |\r\n  1667|Constitution of smallpox,| 15,842|    35|   916 |  1,196 |   83  |\r\n  1668|  with a continued       | 17,278|    14| 1,247 |  1,987 |  200  |\r\n  1669|  “variolous” fever.     |}      |      |       |        |       |\r\n      |                         |}19,432|     3| 1,499 |    951 |   15  |\r\n  1669|Constitution of dysentery|}      |      |       |        |       |\r\n  1670|  and cholera nostras,   | 20,198|     0| 1,729 |  1,465 |  295  |\r\n  1671|  with a continued fever.| 15,729|     5| 1,343 |    696 |   17  |\r\n  1672|  Measles in 1670.       | 18,230|     5| 1,615 |  1,116 |  118  |\r\n      |                         |       |      |       |        |       |\r\n  1673|Constitution of          | 17,504|     5| 1,804 |    853 |   15  |\r\n  1674|  “comatose” fevers.     | 21,201|     3| 2,164 |  2,507 |  795  |\r\n  1675|Influenza in 1675.       | 17,244|     1| 2,154 |    997 |    1  |\r\n  1676|                         | 18,732|     2| 2,112 |    359 |   83  |\r\n      |                         |       |      |       |        |       |\r\n  1677|Not recorded.            | 19,067|     2| 1,749 |  1,678 |   87  |\r\n      |                         |       |      |       |        |       |\r\n  1678|Return of the            | 20,678|     5| 2,376 |  1,798 |   93  |\r\n  1679|  “intermittent”         | 21,730|     2| 2,763 |  1,967 |  117  |\r\n  1680|  constitution, absent   | 21,053|     0| 3,324 |    689 |   49  |\r\n      |  since 1661-64.         |       |      |       |        |       |\r\n      |                         |       |      |       |        |       |\r\n  1681|“Depuratory” fevers,     | 23,951|     0| 3,174 |  2,982 |  121  |\r\n  1682| or dregs of the         | 20,691|     0| 2,696 |  1,408 |   50  |\r\n  1683| intermittents.          | 20,587|     0| 2,250 |  2,096 |   39  |\r\n  1684|                         | 23,202|     0| 2,836 |  1,560 |    6  |\r\n      |                         |       |      |       |        |       |\r\n  1685|Constitution of a        | 23,222|     0| 3,832 |  2,496 |  197  |\r\n  1686| “new” continued fever.  | 22,609|     0| 4,185 |  1,062 |   25  |\r\n\r\n      --------\r\n      |Griping\r\n      | in the\r\n      |  Guts\r\n      |\r\n      |-------\r\n      | 1,061\r\n      |   835\r\n      |   866\r\n      | 1,146\r\n      |\r\n      | 1,288\r\n      |   676\r\n      |\r\n      | 2,108\r\n      | 2,415\r\n      |\r\n      | 4,385\r\n      |\r\n      | 3,690\r\n      | 2,537\r\n      | 2,645\r\n      |\r\n      | 2,624\r\n      | 1,777\r\n      | 3,321\r\n      | 2,083\r\n      |\r\n      | 2,602\r\n      |\r\n      | 3,150\r\n      | 2,996\r\n      | 3,271\r\n      |\r\n      |\r\n      | 2,827\r\n      | 2,631\r\n      | 2,438\r\n      | 2,981\r\n      |\r\n      | 2,203\r\n      | 2,605\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a Table of Sydenham’s epidemic constitutions from 1661 to\r\n1686, compiled from his various writings, with the corresponding\r\nstatistics from the London Bills of Mortality.\r\n\r\nI give this Table both as a convenient outline and in deference to the\r\ngreat name of Sydenham. But we should be much at fault in interpreting the\r\nfigures of the London Bills, or the history of epidemic diseases in the\r\ncountry at large, if we had no other sources of information than his\r\nwritings. Only some of the figures in the Table concern us in this\r\nchapter; plague has been finished in the previous volume, smallpox,\r\nmeasles and “griping in the guts” are reserved each for a separate\r\nchapter, as well as the influenzas and epidemic agues which formed the\r\nchief part of the “strange” or “new” fevers. If this work had been the\r\nAnnals of Epidemics in Britain, it would have been at once proper and easy\r\nto follow Sydenham’s constitutions exactly, and to group under each year\r\nthe information collected from all sources about all epidemic maladies.\r\nBut as the work is a history, it proceeds, as other histories do, in\r\nsections, observing the chronological order and the mutual relations of\r\nepidemic types as far as possible; and in this section of it we have to\r\ncull out and reduce to order the facts relating to fevers, beginning with\r\nthose of 1661.\r\n\r\nCases of fever, says Sydenham, began to be epidemic about the beginning of\r\nJuly 1661, being mostly tertians of a bad type, and became so frequent day\r\nby day that in August they were raging everywhere, and in many places made\r\na great slaughter of people, whole families being seized. This was not an\r\nordinary tertian intermittent; indeed no one but Sydenham calls it an\r\nintermittent at all, and he qualifies the intermittence as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Autumnal intermittents do not at once assume the genuine type, but in\r\n    all respects so imitate continued fevers that unless you examine the\r\n    two respectively with the closest scrutiny, they cannot be\r\n    distinguished. But, when by degrees the impetus of the ‘constitution’\r\n    is repelled and its strength reined in, the fevers change into a\r\n    regular type; and as autumn goes out, they openly confess themselves,\r\n    by casting their slough (_larva abjecta_) to be the intermittents that\r\n    they really were from the first, whether quartans or tertians. If we\r\n    do not attend to this diligently” etc. And again, in a paragraph which\r\n    does not occur in the earlier editions, he writes as follows in the\r\n    context of the “Intermittent Fevers of the years 1661-1664:”\r\n\r\n    “It is also to be noted that in the beginning of intermittent fevers,\r\n    especially those that are epidemic in autumn, it is not altogether\r\n    easy to distinguish the type correctly within the first few days of\r\n    their accession, since they arise at first with continued fever\r\n    superadded. Nor is it always easy, unless you are intent upon it, to\r\n    detect anything else than a slight remission of the disease, which,\r\n    however, declines by degrees into a perfect intermission, with its\r\n    type (third-day or fourth-day) corresponding fitly to the season of\r\n    the year.”\r\n\r\nThe intermittent character of these fevers seems to have struck Sydenham\r\nhimself in a later work as forced and unreal. Writing in 1680, when the\r\nsame kind of fevers were prevalent, after the epidemic agues of 1678 and\r\n1679, he calls them “depuratory,” and says that “doubtless those\r\ndepuratory fevers which reigned in 1661-64 were as if the dregs of the\r\nintermittents which raged sometime before during a series of years,” i.e.\r\nthe agues of 1657-59[18].\r\n\r\nTheory or names apart, Sydenham’s account of the fatal epidemic fever of\r\nthe summer and autumn of 1661, comes to nearly the same as Willis’s.\r\nWithout saying expressly, as Willis does, that the victims were mostly\r\nchildren or young people, he speaks in one place of those of more mature\r\nyears lying much longer in the fever, even to three months, and he\r\nspecially mentions the same sequelae of the fever in children that Willis\r\nmentions, and that Roger North remembered in his own case--namely that\r\nthey sometimes became hectic, with bellies distended and hard, and often\r\nacquired a cough and other consumptive symptoms, “which clearly put one in\r\nmind of rickets.” He refers also to pain and swelling of the tonsils and\r\nto difficulty of swallowing, which, if followed by hoarseness, hollow\r\neyes, and the _facies Hippocratica_, portended speedy death. Among the\r\nnumerous other _accidentia_ of the fever, was a certain kind of mania.\r\nAmong the symptoms were phrensy, and coma-vigil; diarrhœa occurred in some\r\nowing, as he thought, to the omission of an emetic at the outset; hiccup\r\nand bleeding at the nose were occasional.\r\n\r\nBut, although Sydenham must have had the same phenomena of fever before\r\nhim that Willis had, the epidemic being general, according to the\r\nstatements of both, one would hardly guess from his way of presenting the\r\nfacts, that the fever was what Willis took it to be--a slow nervous fever,\r\nwith convulsive and ataxic symptoms, specially affecting children and the\r\nyoung. Both Willis and Sydenham recognised something new in it; the common\r\npeople called it, once more, the “new disease,” and Pepys calls it a “sort\r\nof fever,” and “strange and fatal fevers.”\r\n\r\nAs Sydenham maintains that the same epidemic constitution continued until\r\n1664 (although the fever-deaths in London are much fewer in 1662-3-4 than\r\nin the year 1661, which was the first of it), we may take in the same\r\nconnexion Pepys’s account of the Queen’s attack of fever in 1663. The\r\nyoung princess Katharine of Portugal, married to Charles II. in 1662, had\r\nthe beginning of a fever at Whitehall about the middle of October, 1663;\r\nPepys enters on the 19th that her pulse beat twenty to eleven of the\r\nking’s, that her head was shaved, and pigeons put to her feet, that\r\nextreme unction was given her (the priests so long about it that the\r\ndoctors were angry). On the 20th he hears that the queen’s sickness is a\r\nspotted fever, that she was as full of the spots as a leopard: “which is\r\nvery strange that it should be no more known, but perhaps it is not so.”\r\nOn the 22nd the queen is worse, 23rd she slept, 24th she is in a good way\r\nto recovery, Sir Francis Prujean’s cordial having given her rest; on the\r\n26th “the delirium in her head continues still; she talks idle, not by\r\nfits, but always, which in some lasts a week after so high a fever, in\r\nsome more, and in some for ever.” On the 27th she still raves and talks,\r\nespecially about her imagined children; on the 30th she continues\r\n“light-headed, but in hopes to recover.” On 7th December, she is pretty\r\nwell, and goes out of her chamber to her little chapel in the house; on\r\nthe 31st “the queen after a long and sore sickness is become well again.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTyphus fever perennial in London.\r\n\r\nSydenham says that a continued fever, the symptoms of which so far as he\r\ngives them suggest typhus, was mixed with the masked intermittent, (or the\r\nconvulsive fever of children, as in Willis’s account), in every one of the\r\nyears 1661-4; and that statement raises a question which may be dealt with\r\nhere once for all. Fever in the London bills is a steady item from year to\r\nyear, seldom falling below a thousand deaths and in the year 1741, during\r\na general epidemic of typhus, rising to 7500. The fevers were a composite\r\ngroup, as we have seen, and shall see more clearly. But the bulk of them\r\nperennially appears to have been typhus fever. Where the name of “spotted\r\nfever” is given there can be little doubt. Every year the bills have a\r\nsmall number of deaths from “spotted fever,” and the number of them\r\nalways rises in the weekly bills in proportion to the increase of “fever”\r\nin general, sometimes reaching twenty in the week when the other fevers\r\nreach a hundred. It would be a mistake to suppose that only the fevers\r\ncalled spotted were typhus, the other and larger part being something\r\nelse. The more reasonable supposition is that the name of spotted was\r\ngiven by the searchers in cases where the spots, or vibices or petechiae\r\nof typhus were especially notable. If a score, or a dozen or half-a-dozen\r\ndeaths in a week are set down to spotted fever, it probably means that a\r\nlarge part of the remaining hundred, or seventy, or fifty cases of “fever”\r\nnot called spotted were really of the same kind, namely typhus. In the\r\nplague itself, the “tokens,” which were of the same haemorrhagic nature as\r\nthe larger or more defined spots of typhus, were exceedingly variable[19].\r\nOne of the synonyms of typhus (the common name in Germany) is spotted\r\ntyphus; but the spots were of at least two kinds, a dusky mottling of the\r\nskin and more definite spots, sometimes large, sometimes like fleabites.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the cases specially called “spotted” in the London Bills\r\nwere only a part of all that might have been called by the same name in\r\nthe wider acceptation of the term (as in Germany), it is a significant\r\nfact that there are few of the weekly bills for a long series of years in\r\nthe 17th and 18th centuries without some of the former. Such a case as\r\nthat of Mr Samuel Crewe, brother of Lord Crewe, who died of the “spotted\r\nfever” on 2 July, 1661, probably means that there were more cases of the\r\nsame kind in the poorer parts of the town, from which no account of the\r\nreigning sicknesses ever came unless it were the number of deaths in the\r\nbills. The conditions of endemic typhus were there long before we have\r\nauthentic accounts, towards the end of the 18th century, of that disease\r\nbeing ever present in the homes of the lower classes. In the time of\r\nSydenham, and even in the time of Huxham two generations after, there was\r\nno thought of the unwholesome domestic life graphically described by\r\nWillan and others, as a cause of typhus--the overcrowding, the want of\r\nventilation, the foul bedding and the excremental effluvia.\r\n\r\nIf there had been any reason to suppose that the London of the\r\nRestoration, or of the time of Queen Anne, or of the first Georges had\r\nenjoyed better public health in its crowded liberties and out-parishes\r\nthan we know it to have done from the time when the authentic accounts of\r\nLettsom and other dispensary physicians begin, then one might err in\r\nassuming the perennial existence of typhus fever and in assigning to that\r\ncause the bulk of the deaths under the heading of “fevers” in the Parish\r\nClerks’ bills. But the public health was undoubtedly worse in the earlier\r\nperiod. A writer as late as the year 1819, who is calling for that reform\r\nof the dwellings of the working classes in London which was soon after\r\ncarried out, namely the construction of regular streets instead of mazes\r\nof courts and alleys, speaks of the “silent mortality” that went on in the\r\nlatter[20]. It was still more silent in earlier times, when the west end\r\nof London knew nothing of what was passing in the east end[21].\r\n\r\nIn all matters of public health, after the somewhat romantic interest in\r\nplague had ceased, the poorer parts of London were for long an unexplored\r\nterritory. Dr John Hunter, who had been an army physician and was\r\nafterwards in practice in Mayfair, began about the year 1780 to visit the\r\nhomes of the poor in St Giles’s or other parishes near him, and was\r\nsurprised to find in them a fever not unlike the hospital typhus of his\r\nmilitary experience. I quote at this stage only a sentence or two[22].\r\n\r\n    “It may be observed, that though the fever in the confined habitations\r\n    of the poor does not rise to the same degree of violence as in jails\r\n    and hospitals, yet the destruction of the human species occasioned by\r\n    it must be much greater, from its being so widely spread among a class\r\n    of people whose number bears a large proportion to that of the whole\r\n    inhabitants. There are but few of the sick, so far as I have been able\r\n    to learn, that find their way into the great hospitals in London.” I\r\n    shall defer the subject of the dwellings of the working class in\r\n    London until a later stage.\r\n\r\nThe “constitution” in Sydenham’s series which succeeded the febrile one of\r\n1661-64 was “pestilential fever.” It began in the end of 1664, lasted into\r\nthe spring of 1665, and passed by an easy transition into the plague\r\nproper. The bills for those months have very large weekly totals of deaths\r\nfrom “fever,” as well as a good many deaths from “spotted fever,” before\r\nthey begin to have more than an occasional death from plague. It is this\r\nparticular form of typhus fever that Bateman had in mind when he wrote, in\r\n1818, “We never see the pestilential fever of Sydenham and Huxham”;\r\nalthough Willan, who preceded him at the Carey Street dispensary,\r\ndescribed in 1799 a fever of so fatal a type that it gave rise to the\r\nrumour that the plague was back in London. The term “pestilential” was\r\ntechnically applied to a kind of fever a degree worse than the\r\n“malignant.”\r\n\r\nWillis, the earliest of the Restoration authorities on fevers, had three\r\nnames in an ascending scale of severity--putrid, malignant and\r\npestilential. The putrid fevers were what we might call idiopathic,\r\nengendered within the body in some way personal to the individual from\r\n“putrefaction” or fermentation of the humours; all the intermittents were\r\nincluded in that class, and the theory of their cure by bark was that the\r\ndrug corrected putridity. In the malignant and pestilential, an altogether\r\nnew element came in--the τὸ θεῖον of Hippocrates, the mysterious something\r\nwhich we call infection; and of these two infectious fevers, the malignant\r\nwas milder than the pestilential[23].\r\n\r\nMorton drew out the scale of fevers in an elaborate classification, of\r\nwhich only the last section of continued contagious fevers concerns us at\r\npresent[24]:\r\n\r\n            {                        {Fever mostly with sweats and\r\n            {Simple Malignant Fever  {other signs of malignity, but\r\n            {                        {without buboes, carbuncles,\r\n            {                        {petechiae or miliary rash.\r\n  Synochus  {\r\n            {                        {Fever with petechiae, purple\r\n            {Pestilential Fever      {spots, miliaria, morbillous rash\r\n            {                        {on the chest.\r\n            {\r\n            {Plague                  {With buboes, carbuncles and\r\n            {                        {black spots.\r\n\r\nThe order in this Table was also the order in time: the fever of 1661,\r\nwhich Willis calls malignant, remained as the constitution of the years\r\nfollowing until the end of 1664; then began the pestilential, which passed\r\ndefinitely in the spring of 1665 into the plague proper. Willis, Sydenham\r\nand Morton, differing as they did on many points of theory and treatment,\r\nall alike taught the scale of malignity in fevers and plague, and all used\r\nthe language of “constitutions.” The Great Plague of 1665 was, in their\r\nview, the climax of a succession of febrile constitutions of the air,\r\nbeing attended by much pestilential fever and followed by a fever which\r\nMorton places in the milder class of συνεχής.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe epidemic Constitutions following the Great Plague.\r\n\r\nDuring the ten or twelve years following the Great Plague of London, the\r\nepidemic maladies which Sydenham dwelt most upon as the reigning types\r\nwill appear on close scrutiny to have been on the whole proper to the\r\nearlier years of life. This cannot be shown in the simple way of figures;\r\nfor the ages at death from the several maladies, although they were in the\r\nbooks of the Parish Clerks, were not published.\r\n\r\nThere was some continued fever every year, which we may take to have been\r\nchiefly the endemic typhus of a great city, and there were also deaths\r\namong adults due to those reigning epidemics which fell most on the young.\r\nIn 1667 and 1668 the leading epidemic was smallpox, with a continued fever\r\ntowards the end of the period which Sydenham called “variolous,” for no\r\nother reason, apparently, than that it was part of a variolous\r\nconstitution. In the autumn of 1669, and in the three years following, the\r\nepidemic mortality was peculiarly infantile, in the form of diarrhoea or\r\n“griping in the guts,” with some dysentery of adults, and some measles in\r\n1670. From 1673 to 1676, the constitution was a comatose fever, which\r\nchiefly affected children, with a sharp epidemic of measles in the first\r\nhalf of 1674, attended by a very high mortality from all causes, and a\r\nsevere smallpox in the second half of 1674, attended by a much lower\r\nmortality from all causes. There was also an influenza for a few weeks in\r\n1675. In 1678 the “intermittent” constitution returned, having been absent\r\nfor thirteen years, and continued through 1779-80, until its “strength was\r\nbroken.” In 1681 smallpox was unusually mortal, the deaths being more than\r\nin any previous year. Most of these constitutions fall to be dealt with\r\nfully in other chapters: but as we are here specially concerned with the\r\nsuccession to the plague, it is to be noted how largely the epidemic\r\nmortality in London fell upon the age of childhood for a number of years\r\nafter the Great Plague of 1665. It was observed both by English and\r\nforeign writers that the next epidemic following the Black Death of\r\n1348-49, namely, that of 1361 in England and of 1359-60 in some other\r\nparts of Europe, fell mostly upon children and upon the upper classes of\r\nadults. There is doubtless some particular application of the population\r\nprinciple in the earlier instance as in the later, but not the same\r\napplication in both. The conditions at the beginning of the three hundred\r\nyears’ reign of plague in Britain were different from those at the end of\r\nit. The increased prevalence of smallpox in the generation before the last\r\ngreat outburst of plague, and the infantile or puerile character of the\r\nepidemic fever of 1661, as described by Willis, show that the incidence of\r\ninfectious mortality had already begun to shift towards the age of\r\nchildhood. It looks as if the conditions of population, intricate and\r\nobscure as they must be confessed to be, were somehow determining what the\r\nreigning infectious maladies, with their special age-incidence, should be.\r\nSuch a gradual change is the more probable for the reason that infectious\r\nmortality came in due time to be mostly an affair of childhood. The\r\nplague, which was the great infection of the later medieval and earlier\r\nmodern period, was peculiarly fatal to adult lives; on the other hand, the\r\nmortality from infectious diseases in our own time falls in much the\r\nlarger ratio upon infants and children. It looks as if this change, now so\r\nobvious, had begun before the end of plague in Britain, having become more\r\nmarked in the generation following its extinction. The direct successor of\r\nplague, so far as concerns age-incidence and nosological affinity, was the\r\npestilential or malignant typhus, which came into great prominence in\r\n1685-86, in circumstances that seemed to contemporaries to forebode a\r\nreturn of the plague. But before we come to that, there remains a little\r\nto be said of some other fevers, especially of the comatose fever of\r\n1673-76, which was largely an affair of childhood.\r\n\r\nPepys says that he went on 3 May, 1668, to Old Street (St Luke’s) to see\r\nAdmiral Sir Thomas Teddiman, “who is very ill in bed of a fever,” and, in\r\na later entry, that he “did die by a thrush in his mouth” on the 12th of\r\nMay. Next year, 1669, Pepys and his wife went on tour through several\r\nparts of Europe, and had hardly returned to their house in Seething Lane\r\nwhen the lady fell ill of a fever; on 2nd November, it was “so severe as\r\nto render her recovery desperate,” and on 10th November she died, in her\r\n29th year,--a surprising sequel, as her husband felt, to a “voyage so full\r\nof health and content.” These two years, for which we have a sample of the\r\nLondon fevers, were marked in the Netherlands by epidemics of fevers which\r\nare among the most extraordinary in the whole history. At Leyden in 1669\r\nthe fever reached such a height as to cut off 7000--a mortality which\r\nwould not have been surprising if the disease had been plague; but it was\r\nnot plague, it wanted the buboes, carbuncles &c., was longer in its\r\ncourse, and, strangest of all, affected the upper classes far more\r\nseverely than the poor, so much so “that of seventy men administering the\r\npublic affairs, scarcely two were left[25],” while, according to Fanois,\r\nwho was the Leyden poor’s doctor, the lower classes, “protected as it were\r\nby having survived the simpler forms of fever,” suffered from this\r\nmalignant epidemic far less than the rich[26]. The mortality is said to\r\nhave risen as high as three-fourths of the attacks. At Haarlem the burials\r\nin a week rose to three or four hundred (which was a fair week’s average\r\nfor London itself in an ordinary season), the epidemic lasting four months\r\nand leaving hardly one family untouched. Among the symptoms were extreme\r\npraecordial anxiety, weight at the pit of the stomach, constant nausea and\r\nloathing, vomiting, in part bilious but chiefly “pituitous,” thirst and\r\nrestless tossing. It was attended by an affection of the throat and\r\nmouth--an angina with aphthae or thrush of the palate. The pools and other\r\nsources of water for domestic use were unusually stagnant that summer in\r\nHolland, and were commonly blamed for the epidemic; but Fanois points out\r\nthat at Haarlem and Emden, where similar fevers raged, “salubriores non\r\ndesunt aquae[27].”\r\n\r\nAfter such an instance as the Leyden fever of 1669, nothing is incredible\r\nin the records of fever subsequent to the extinction of plague. Turning to\r\nSydenham’s account of the continued fever which occurred in London during\r\nthe same season, the latter half of 1669, as well as in the three years\r\nfollowing, we find that it was characterized rarely by diarrhoea or\r\nsweats, commonly by pain in the head, by a moist white tongue which\r\nafterwards became covered by a dense skin, and by a greater tendency than\r\nSydenham had ever seen to aphthae (the “thrush in the mouth” of Admiral\r\nTeddiman in 1668) when death threatened--the same being a “deposition from\r\nthe blood of foul and acrid matter upon the mouth and throat.” But London\r\nin 1668 and 1669 suffered little from fevers in comparison to Leyden,\r\nHaarlem and other Dutch towns, its high mortality in the summer and autumn\r\nof 1669 being from infantile diarrhoea, cholera nostras and dysentery.\r\n\r\nSydenham’s continued fever from 1673 to 1676 (he was absent from his\r\npractice in 1677 owing to ill health) was a malady which affected adults\r\nas well as children, but, it would appear, the latter especially. The only\r\ncharacteristic case given is of a boy of nine who did not begin to mend\r\nuntil the thirtieth day. Many recovered in a fortnight, while others were\r\nnot clear of the fever in a month. On account of the remarkable stupor\r\nwhich almost always attended it, Sydenham called the fever of this\r\nconstitution a comatose fever. It began with sharp pains in the head and\r\nback, pains in the limbs, heats and chills, etc. His account of the\r\ncomatose state is exactly like that given by Willis for the fever of\r\nchildren in 1661--profound stupor, sometimes for a week long, so profound\r\nin some as to pass into absolute aphonia (the “acute fever with dumbness”\r\nof later writers), while others would talk a few words in their sleep, or\r\nwould seem to be angry or perturbed by something (the chimaeras mentioned\r\nby Willis) and would then become tranquil again; when roused to take\r\nphysic or to drink they would open the eyes for a moment and then fall\r\nback into stupor. When they began to mend, they would crave for absurd\r\nthings to eat or drink. During convalescence the head, through weakness,\r\ncould not be kept straight but would incline first to one side and then to\r\nthe other[28].\r\n\r\nThe years 1678-1680 witnessed remarkable epidemics of ague, such as had\r\noccurred on several occasions before, the last in the years 1657-59. They\r\nengross so much of Sydenham’s writing, especially in connexion with the\r\nPeruvian-bark controversy, that we hear little of any other fever until\r\nthe great epidemic of continued fever, or typhus, in 1685-6. But he does\r\nmention briefly that the interval between the decline of the agues in 1680\r\nand the beginning of the “new fever” of 1685, was occupied by “continued\r\ndepuratory” fevers--depuratory of the dregs of the preceding intermittent\r\nconstitution, and comparable in that respect to the fevers of 1661-64\r\nwhich followed the agues of 1657-59[29].\r\n\r\nSydenham’s term “depuratory” does not help us much; but we learn something\r\nfrom Morton as to what fevers were prevalent, besides the epidemical\r\nintermittents, in the years preceding the epidemic of 1685-86. Morton\r\nclasses them as continued συνεχής (_Synocha_), by which he means something\r\nless malignant than _Synochus_. A fever which began in the milder form\r\nwould often degenerate into the more malignant, the cause assigned, in the\r\nusual recriminatory manner of the time between rival schools, being\r\nmistaken treatment. But sometimes the fever was malignant from the outset,\r\nwith purple spots, petechiae, morbillous efflorescence, watery vesicles on\r\nthe neck and breast, buboes, and anthraceous boils. All these fevers, says\r\nMorton, whether they were spurious forms of synocha, or malignant from the\r\noutset, were sporadic, “neque contagione, ut in pestilentiali\r\nconstitutione, sese propagabant[30].” This points to their having been\r\npart of that strange aguish epidemic of which an account is given in\r\nanother chapter. In Short’s abstracts of parish registers, the year 1680\r\nseems to have been the most unhealthy of the series in country parishes,\r\nand that is borne out by one Lamport, or Lampard, an empiric who practised\r\nin Hampshire: “I will tell you somewhat concerning a malignant fever. In\r\nthe year ’80 or ’81 there were great numbers of people died of such\r\nfevers, many whereby were taken with vomitings, etc., yet I had the good\r\nfortune to cure eighteen in the parish of Aldingbourn, not one dying, in\r\nthat great compass, of that disease[31].” The moral is that the empiric\r\nrecovered his cases, whereas the regular faculty lost theirs; which means\r\nthat the fevers were of various degrees, some aguish, some typhus, as in\r\nthe exactly similar circumstances a century after, 1780-85.\r\n\r\nIn the London Bills from 1681 to 1684, the deaths from fever were many,\r\nwith some from “spotted fever” nearly every week, while the annual\r\nmortalities from all causes were high. It is the more remarkable,\r\ntherefore, that Sydenham should have discovered, in the beginning of 1685,\r\nthe outbreak of a new fever, different from any that had prevailed for\r\nseven years before. The explanation seems to be that a malignant typhus\r\nfever, such as might have been discovered in any year in the crowded\r\nparishes where the working classes lived, broke out at the Court end of\r\nthe town, where Sydenham’s practice lay.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe epidemic fever of 1685-86.\r\n\r\nA letter of 12 March, 1685, says: “Sir R. Mason died this morning in his\r\nlodging at Whitehall. A fever rages that proves very mortal, and gives\r\ngreat apprehensions of a plague[32].” Sydenham also was reminded of the\r\ncircumstances preceding the Great Plague of London in 1665. In his first\r\naccount of the epidemic of fever in 1685[33], which began with a thaw in\r\nFebruary, he points out that the thaw in March, 1665, had been followed by\r\npestilential fever and thereafter by the plague proper. In a later\r\nreference, when the epidemic of fever was in its second year (1686) he\r\nsays: “How long it may last I shall not guess; nor do I quite know whether\r\nit may not be a certain more spirituous, subtle beginning, and as if\r\n_primordium_, of the former depuratory fever (1661-64) which was followed\r\nby the most terrible plague. There are some phenomena which so far incline\r\nme to that belief[34].” However, no plague followed the malignant, if not\r\npestilential, fever of 1685-86. The reign of plague, as the event showed,\r\nwas over; the fever which had been on former occasions its portent and\r\nsatellite, came into the place of reigning disease. It is true that\r\nSydenham does not identify the fever of 1685-86 by name as pestilential\r\nfever; on the contrary, he entitles his essay “De Novae Febris Ingressu.”\r\nBut the novelty of type was partly in contrast to the fevers immediately\r\npreceding, which admitted treatment by bark, and its principal difference\r\nfrom the pestilential fever of former occasions seems to have been that it\r\nwas not followed by plague[35]. Its antecedents and circumstances were\r\nvery much those of plague itself. Its mortality was greatest in the old\r\nplague-seasons of summer and autumn, it had slight relation to famine or\r\nscarcity, or to other obvious cause of domestic typhus. Sydenham can find\r\nno explanation of the new constitution but “some secret and recondite\r\nchange in the bowels of the earth pervading the whole atmosphere, or some\r\ninfluence of the celestial bodies.” He enlarges, however, on the character\r\nof the seasons preceding, which would have affected the surface, if not\r\nthe bowels, of the earth, and the levels of the ground-water.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1683-84 was one of intense frost; an ice-carnival was held\r\non the Thames during the whole of January. The long dry frost of winter\r\nwas followed by an excessively hot and dry summer, the drought being such\r\nas Evelyn did not remember, and as “no man in England had known.” For\r\neight or nine months there had not been above one or two considerable\r\nshowers, which came in storms. The winter of 1684-85 set in early, and\r\nbecame “a long and cruel frost,” more interrupted, however, than that of\r\nthe year before. The spring was again dry, and it was not until the end of\r\nMay 1685 that “we had plentiful rain after two years’ excessive drought\r\nand severe winters[36].”\r\n\r\nThe two years of excessive drought, with severe winters, had their effect\r\nupon the public health, as will appear from Short’s abstracts of parish\r\nregisters in town and country[37]; the years 1683-85 being conspicuous for\r\nthe excess of burials over baptisms:\r\n\r\n_Country Parishes._\r\n\r\n  Year   Registers   Registers with    Deaths in   Births in\r\n         examined    excess of death     them        them\r\n\r\n  1683      140            37             923         685\r\n  1684      140            31             900         629\r\n  1685      140            19             574         478\r\n  1686      140            16             419         301\r\n  1687      143            19             522         427\r\n  1688      143            11             327         267\r\n\r\n_Towns._\r\n\r\n  1683       25             8            1398        1169\r\n  1684       25             8            1243         865\r\n  1685       25             4            1191         741\r\n  1686       25             2             555         418\r\n  1687       25             1             313         269\r\n  1688       25             2             191         146\r\n\r\nThere is no clue to the forms of sickness that caused the excessive\r\nmortality in country parishes and provincial towns. But in London it\r\nappears from the Bills that the one great cause of the unusual excess of\r\ndeaths in 1684 was an enormous mortality from infantile diarrhoea, from\r\nthe end of July to the middle of September, during the weather which\r\nEvelyn describes as excessively hot and dry with occasional storms of\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nIt was in the second year of the long drought, February, 1685, that\r\nSydenham dated the beginning of his new febrile constitutions. The\r\nmortality of 1685 was just twenty deaths more than in 1684 (23,222); but\r\nfever (with spotted fever) and smallpox had each a thousand more out of\r\nthe total than in the year before. Sydenham says that the fever did not\r\nspare children, which might be alleged of typhus at all times; but a fever\r\nof the kind, even if it ran through the children of a household, seldom\r\ncut off the very young, the mortality being in greatest part of adults and\r\nadolescents. Excepting smallpox for the year 1685, infantile and\r\nchildren’s maladies were not prominent during the constitution of the “new\r\nfever;” the usual items of high infantile mortality, such as convulsions\r\nand “griping in the guts” or infantile diarrhoea, were moderate and even\r\nlow. Hence, although the weekly fever-deaths in the following Table may\r\nnot appear sufficient for the professional and other interest that they\r\nexcited, it is to be kept in mind that they had been mostly of adult\r\nlives. It is probable also that a good many of them had been among the\r\nwell-to-do, and perhaps at first in the West End; for there is nothing in\r\nthe height of the weekly bills for all London to bear out the remark of\r\nthe letter of 12 March, already quoted, “A fever rages that proves very\r\nmortal and gives apprehensions of a plague.”\r\n\r\n_Weekly Mortalities in London._\r\n\r\n1685.\r\n\r\n

new fever at first as nothing more than\r\nthe “bastard peripneumony” which he had described for previous seasons;\r\nbut he had soon cause to see that it wanted the violent cough, the racking\r\npain in the head during coughing, the giddiness caused by the slightest\r\nmovement, and the excessive dyspnoea of the latter (Huxham likewise\r\ndistinguished typhus from “bastard peripneumony”). The early symptoms of\r\nthe “new fever” were alternating chills and flushings, pain in the head\r\nand limbs, a cough, which might go off soon, with pain in the neck and\r\nthroat. The fever was a continued one, with exacerbation towards evening;\r\nit was apt to change into a phrensy, with tranquil or muttering delirium;\r\npetechiae and livid blotches were brought out in some cases (Sydenham\r\nthought they were caused by cordials and a heating regimen), and there\r\nwere occasional eruptions of miliary vesicles. The tongue might be moist\r\nand white at the edges for a time, latterly brown and dry. Clammy sweats\r\nwere apt to break out, especially from the head. If the brain became the\r\norgan most touched, the fever-heat declined, the pulse became irregular,\r\nand jerking of the limbs came on before death.\r\n\r\nLater writers, for example those who described the great epidemic fever of\r\n1741, have identified the fever of 1685-86 with the contagious malignant\r\nfever afterwards called typhus, and Murchison, in his brief retrospect of\r\ntyphus in Britain, has included it under that name. Sydenham mentions\r\npetechiae and livid blotches in some cases, and the Bills give a good many\r\nof the deaths in the worst weeks of the epidemic under the head of\r\n“spotted fever.” It is not at first easy to understand why Sydenham should\r\nhave written an essay specially upon it, in September, 1686, to claim it\r\nas a new fever[38] and not rather as the old pestilential\r\nfever--“populares meos admonens de subingressu novae cujusdam\r\nConstitutionis, a qua pendet Febris nova species, a nuper grassantibus\r\nmultum abludens.” It should be kept in mind that his motive was correct\r\ntreatment, and that the fashionable treatment of the day by Peruvian bark\r\nwas, in his judgment, unsuited to this fever, however much it may have\r\nsuited the epidemical intermittents of 1678-79 and the “depuratory” dregs\r\nof them for several years after. Physicians, he says, had learned to drive\r\noff by bark the fevers of the former constitution, from 1677 to the\r\nbeginning of 1685, even when the fever intermitted little and sometimes\r\nwhen it intermitted not at all; and they saw an indication for bark in the\r\nnocturnal exacerbations of the new fever. Sydenham found that even large\r\ndoses of bark did not free the patient from fever, and that restoration to\r\nhealth under treatment with the bark was due “magis fortunato alicui morbi\r\neventu quam corticis viribus.” He seeks to establish the indications for\r\nanother treatment by setting forth the symptoms minutely; and as the\r\nquestion of bark in fevers was the great medical question of the time,\r\nthis may well have been Sydenham’s motive for discovering in the epidemic\r\nof 1685-6 a “new fever” although he does not say so in as many words. We\r\nhave a good instance of how the bark-craze was at this time influencing\r\nthe very highest circles of practice in the case of Lord Keeper Guildford,\r\nin July, 1685, as related in another chapter.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the table of weekly deaths that the second of the two\r\nhard winters was over before the fever began to attract notice. Sydenham\r\ncompares its beginning after the thaw in February, 1685, to the beginning\r\nof the plague when the frost broke in March, 1665.\r\n\r\nIf it had been merely the typhus of a hard winter, of overcrowding\r\nindoors, of work and wages stopped by the frost, and of want of fuel\r\n(which things Evelyn mentions as matters of fact), it would have come\r\nsooner than the spring of 1685. The Bills for years before have regularly\r\na good many deaths from fever, and always some from spotted fever; but\r\nthese may have come from parishes wholly beyond the range of Sydenham’s\r\npractice. The fever began definitely for him in February, 1685, and was at\r\nits worst in the old plague-seasons of summer and autumn. If the seasons\r\nhad any relation at all to it, the epidemic was a late effect of the long\r\ndrought, an effect which was manifested most when the rain came, in the\r\nsummer of 1685 and throughout the mild winter and normal summer of\r\n1685-86. It must have been for that reason that Sydenham traced the source\r\nof it to “some secret and recondite change in the bowels of the earth,”\r\nrather than to a change in the sensible qualities of the air. One must\r\never bear in mind that the physicians of the Restoration gave no thought\r\nto insanitary conditions of living; in that respect the later Stuart\r\nperiod seems to have been behind the Elizabethan or even the medieval; we\r\ncannot err in assuming, behind all Sydenham’s speculative causes, a great\r\ndeal of unwholesomeness indoors. Sydenham’s fullest reference to the\r\nsubterranean sources of poisonous miasmata occurs in his tractate on Gout:\r\n\r\n    “Whether it be that the bowels of the earth, if one may so speak,\r\n    undergo various changes, so that by the accession of vapours exhaled\r\n    therefrom the air is disturbed, or that the whole atmosphere is\r\n    infected by a change which some peculiar conjunction of certain of the\r\n    heavenly bodies induces in it;--the matter so falls out that at this\r\n    or that time the air is furnished with particles that are adverse to\r\n    the economy of the human body, just as at another time it is\r\n    impregnated with particles of a like kind that agree ill with the\r\n    bodies of some species of brute animals. At these times, as often as\r\n    by inspiration we draw into the naked blood miasmata of this kind,\r\n    noxious and inimical to nature, and we fall into those epidemical\r\n    diseases which they are apt to produce, Nature raises a fever,--her\r\n    accustomed means of vindicating the blood from some hostile matter.\r\n    And such diseases are commonly called _epidemical_; and they are short\r\n    and sharp because they have thus a quick and violent movement[39].”\r\n\r\nIt was Sydenham’s intimate friend Robert Boyle who worked out the\r\nhypothesis of subterraneous miasmata as a cause of epidemic (and endemic)\r\ndiseases. An account of his theory will be found in the chapter on\r\nInfluenzas and Epidemic Agues. It may be said here that it needs only a\r\nfew changes, especially the substitution of organic for inorganic matters\r\nin the soil, to bring it into line with the modern doctrine of miasmatic\r\ninfective disease as expounded by the Munich school.\r\n\r\nIt has not been usual to think of spotted fever, (or of influenzas), in\r\nthat connexion; but a telluric source of the epidemic constitution of\r\n1685-86 was clearly Sydenham’s view; and as the fever came in\r\ncircumstances like those of the last great plague, and was thought at the\r\ntime to be the forerunner of another great plague, its connexion with\r\nrecondite decompositions in the soil, dependent on the phenomenal drought\r\nof two whole years before, cannot be set aside as a possibility, the less\r\nso that the fever, although of the type of typhus, was not a fever of\r\ncold, hunger, and domestic distress, but mainly of the warm, or mild, or\r\nsoft weather following the long drought, and of many well-to-do-people, as\r\nin the great Netherlands fever of 1669. My view of it is that it was the\r\nmodified successor of plague, the _pestis mitior_, which used to precede\r\nand accompany the plague, now become the dominant constitution. The\r\nauthentic figures of its mortality come from London; but Sydenham says\r\nthat its “effects were felt far more in other places”; although Short’s\r\nabstracts of parish registers, given above, do not indicate excessive\r\nmortality throughout England.\r\n\r\n\r\nRetrospect of the great Fever of 1623-25.\r\n\r\nThe most instructive instance of _pestis mitior_ in Britain is not the\r\npestilential fever which led up to the last plague (1665-6), but the great\r\nepidemic of fever all over England and Scotland which reigned for two or\r\nthree years before the great outburst of plague in 1625. I go back to this\r\nbecause it was not wholly or even mainly a famine fever (although it was\r\nas general as one of the medieval famine-fevers), and because in that\r\nrespect it furnishes a close parallel to the fever of 1685-86, which I\r\nregard as the successor of the plague. After this interlude in the\r\nhistory, we shall proceed to consider the question of the final extinction\r\nof plague.\r\n\r\n    In Scotland the fever of 1622-23 was directly connected with famine,\r\n    but in England it was not obviously so according to the records that\r\n    remain. The dearth in Scotland began as early as the autumn of 1621:\r\n    “Great skarsitie of cornes throw all the kingdome,” the harvest having\r\n    been spoiled by wet weather and unheard of river floods; however,\r\n    abundance of foreign victual came in, and the scarcity was got\r\n    over[40]. In England the same harvest of oats was abundant, and\r\n    probably yielded the “foreign victual” which relieved the Scots; but\r\n    the price of wheat rose greatly[41]. It was the year following, 1622,\r\n    that really brought famine and famine-sickness to Scotland, as the\r\n    second of two bad harvests had always done. On 21 July, 1622, a fast\r\n    was proclaimed at Aberdeen for “the present plague of dearth and\r\n    famine, and the continuance thereof threatened by tempests,\r\n    inundations and weets likely to rot the fruit on the ground[42].”\r\n\r\n    In an entry of the Chronicle of Perth, subsequent to July, 1622, it is\r\n    said: “In this yeir about the harvest and efter, thair wes suche ane\r\n    universall seikness in all the countrie as the ellyke hes not bene\r\n    hard of. But speciallie in this burgh, that no familie in all the\r\n    citie was frie of this visitation. Thair was also great mortalitie\r\n    amonge the poore.” From which it appears that the autumnal fever of\r\n    1622 was among all classes in Scotland. The famine in Scotland became\r\n    more acute in the spring and summer of 1623; the country swarmed with\r\n    beggars, and in July, says Calderwood, the famine increased daily\r\n    until “many, both in burgh and land, died of hunger.” At Perth ten or\r\n    twelve died every day from Midsummer to Michaelmas; the disease was\r\n    not the plague, but a fever[43]. At Dumfries 492 died during the first\r\n    ten months of 1623, perhaps a ninth part of the inhabitants, about one\r\n    hundred of the deaths being specially marked as of “poor[44].” The\r\n    “malignant spotted fever” which caused numerous deaths in 1623 in\r\n    Wigton, Penrith and Kendal is clearly part of the famine-fever of\r\n    Scotland extending to the Borders and crossing them. This is a\r\n    famine-fever of the old medieval type, like that of 1196 which,\r\n    according to William of Newburgh “crept about everywhere,” always the\r\n    same acute fever, putting an end to the miseries of the starving, but\r\n    attacking also those who had food.\r\n\r\n    The same spotted fever was all over England in 1623, but it did not,\r\n    as in Scotland, come in the wake of famine. It is true that the\r\n    English harvest of 1622 was a good deal spoiled; a letter of 25\r\n    September says[45]: “Though the latter part of this summer proved so\r\n    far seasonable, yet the harvest is scant, and corn at a great price by\r\n    reason of the mildews and blasting generally over the whole realm,”\r\n    rye being quoted a few weeks later at 7/- the bushel and wheat at\r\n    10/-, although the average of wheat for the year, in Rogers’s tables,\r\n    is not more than 51/1_d._ per quarter, while the average of next year\r\n    falls to 37/8_d._ These were not famine-prices in England, and there\r\n    is no evidence of general sickness directly after the harvest of 1622,\r\n    when corn was dearest. Also, although the autumn of 1623 was a time of\r\n    “continual wet” in England[46], the price of wheat remained moderate,\r\n    and even low as compared with the rather stiff price of the winter of\r\n    1622-23. But it was not until the summer and autumn of 1623 that the\r\n    spotted fever became epidemic in England. Short’s abstracts of the\r\n    registers of market towns show how sickly that year was:\r\n\r\n        Year.    No. of     No. with    Buried   Baptised\r\n                registers   excess of   in the    in the\r\n                examined.   burials.    same.     same.\r\n\r\n        1622      25           4          442       345\r\n        1623      25          16         2254       439 (sic)\r\n        1624      25           9          978       714\r\n        1625      25           9          666       563\r\n\r\n    In September, 1623, the corporation of Stamford made a collection “in\r\n    this dangerous time of visitation,” and sent £10 of it to Grantham,\r\n    the rest to go “to London or some other town, as occasion offered.” A\r\n    London letter of 6 December, 1623, from Chamberlain to Carleton\r\n    says[47]:--\r\n\r\n    “Here is a contagious spotted or purple fever that reigns much, which,\r\n    together with the smallpox, hath taken away many of good sort, as well\r\n    as meaner people.” He then gives the names of notables dead of it, and\r\n    adds: “Yet many escape, as the dean of St Paul’s [Dr Donne, who used\r\n    the occasion to compile a manual of devotion] is like to do, though he\r\n    were in great danger.” One of the Coke family writes early in January,\r\n    1624, from London[48]: “Having two sons at Cambridge, we sent for them\r\n    to keep Christmas with us, and not many days after their coming my\r\n    eldest son Joseph fell suddenly into the sickness of the time which\r\n    they call the spotted fever, and which after two days’ extremity took\r\n    away his life.” From another letter it appears that one of his\r\n    symptoms was “not being able to sleep,” the unmistakable vigil of\r\n    typhus. Although there is no word of the epidemic continuing in\r\n    Scotland in 1624, it was undoubtedly as prevalent in England in that\r\n    year as the year before, and prevalent in country houses as well as\r\n    in towns and cities. Thus, on 7 August, 1624, Chamberlain writes: “The\r\n    [king’s] progress is now so far off that we hear little thence, but\r\n    only that there be many sick of the spotted ague, which took away the\r\n    Duke of Lennox in a few days. He died at Kirby,” a country house in\r\n    Northamptonshire[49]. On 21 August he writes again: “This spotted\r\n    fever is cousin-german to it [the plague] at least, and makes as quick\r\n    riddance almost. The Lady Hatton hath two or three of her children\r\n    sick of it at her brother Fanshaw’s in Essex, and hath lost her\r\n    younger daughter, that was buried at Westminster on Wednesday night by\r\n    her father; a pretty gentlewoman, much lamented.” A letter of 4\r\n    September says there was excessive mortality in London, in great part\r\n    among children (doubtless from the usual infantile trouble of a hot\r\n    autumn, diarrhoea), while “most of the rest are carried away by this\r\n    spotted fever, which reigns almost everywhere, in the country as ill\r\n    as here.” Sir Theodore Mayerne, the king’s physician, confirms this,\r\n    under date 20 August, 1624: the purple fever, he says, was “not so\r\n    much contagious as common through a universal disposing cause,”\r\n    seizing upon many in the same house, and destroying numbers, being\r\n    most full of malignity[50]. It was clearly an inexplicable visitation.\r\n    The summer was hot and dry, from which character of the season, says\r\n    Chamberlain, “some have found out a far-fetched speculation, which yet\r\n    runs current, and would ascribe it [the spotted fever] to the\r\n    extraordinary quantity of cucumbers this year, which the gardeners, to\r\n    hasten and bring forward, used to water out of the next ditches, which\r\n    this dry time growing low, noisome and stinking, poisoned the fruit.\r\n    But,” adds Chamberlain, “that reason will reach no farther than this\r\n    [London] town, whereas the mortality is spread far and near, and takes\r\n    hold of whole households in many places.” He then gives the names of\r\n    several eminent persons dead of it, and speaks of others who were\r\n    “still in the balance[51].” On 9 October, “the town continues sickly\r\n    still,” and Parliament had been put off, “in consideration of the\r\n    danger,” from 2 November, 1624, to 15 February, 1625. On Ash\r\n    Wednesday, 1625, the Marquis of Hamilton died of the pestilent fever\r\n    at Moor Park, Rickmansworth. Thus far there had been no plague; and if\r\n    the spotted fever were cousin-german to the plague, as Chamberlain\r\n    said, it was remarkable in this that it prevailed in the mansions of\r\n    the rich in town and country and took off more victims among the upper\r\n    classes than the plague itself even in its most terrific outbursts.\r\n    However, a plague of the first rank followed in London and elsewhere\r\n    in the summer and autumn of 1625.\r\n\r\n    The cucumber-theory, above mentioned, shows how puzzled people must\r\n    have been to account for the spotted fever, or “spotted ague” as it\r\n    was also called, in 1624. Sir Theodore Mayerne did not think contagion\r\n    from person to person could explain it, but referred it to “some\r\n    universal disposing cause.” It is conceivable that the famine-fever of\r\n    1622 and 1623 in Scotland and the Marches may have spread by contagion\r\n    into England in the latter year; but in 1624 there is nothing said of\r\n    fever in Scotland or of scarcity as a primary cause in England.\r\n\r\n    Besides the famine-fever of Scotland in 1622-23, there was another\r\n    associated thing which should not be left out of account. Before the\r\n    famine and fever had begun in that country, the notorious Hungarian\r\n    fever was raging in the Palatinate, and continued to rage for four\r\n    years. “Hungarian fever” had become the dreaded name for war-typhus of\r\n    a peculiar malignity and diffusive power. It had been so often\r\n    engendered since the 16th century in campaigns upon Hungarian soil as\r\n    to have become known everywhere under the name of that country. Its\r\n    infection spread, also, everywhere through Europe; thus it is said to\r\n    have even reached England in 1566, and again in 1589, although it is\r\n    not easy to find English evidence of it for either year. It was this\r\n    type of fever which broke out in the Upper Palatinate, occupied by\r\n    troops of the Catholic powers, in 1620, and continued through the\r\n    years 1621, 1622 and 1623; as the title of one of the essays upon this\r\n    outbreak somewhat fantastically declares, it spread “ex castris ad\r\n    rastra, ex rastris ad rostra, ab his ad aras et focos[52].” Was the\r\n    epidemic constitution of “spotted ague” in England in 1623 and 1624\r\n    derived from the centre of famine-fever in Scotland, or from the\r\n    centre of camp-fever in the Palatinate? In the last years of James I.\r\n    communications were frequent with the latter country, and there was of\r\n    course much intercourse with Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe spotted fever or spotted ague of 1623-24, the plague of 1625, and the\r\ncountry agues of the same autumn make really a more instructive series of\r\nepidemic constitutions than any that fell under Sydenham’s observation, so\r\ninstructive, indeed, that it has seemed worth while to revert to it for\r\nthe sake of illustrating the doctrine of epidemics then in vogue. That\r\ndoctrine made little of contagion from person to person; yet the idea of\r\ncontagion was familiar, and had been so since medieval times. If we might\r\nassume contagion to explain such cases as those that occurred in the\r\nhouses of squires and nobles, we might find a source of it either in the\r\nfamine-fever of Scotland or in the war-fever of the Palatinate. But the\r\nteaching of the time was that it was in the air; and if the infective\r\nprinciple had been generated either in Scotland or on the upper Rhine it\r\nhad diffused itself in some inscrutable way. The doctrine of epidemic\r\nconstitutions seems strange to us; but some of the facts that it was meant\r\nto embrace are also strange to us. Were it not for an occasional reminder\r\nfrom influenza, we should hardly believe that any fevers could have\r\ntravelled as the Hungarian fevers, the spotted fevers or “spotted agues”\r\nof former times are said to have done.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have now a scientific doctrine of the effects of\r\ngreat fluctuations of the ground-water upon the production of telluric\r\nmiasmata, which may be used to rationalize the theory of emanations\r\nadopted by Sydenham and Boyle. From this modern point of view the\r\nremarkable droughts preceding the pestilential fevers and plagues of\r\n1624-25 and 1665, and preceding the fever of 1685-86, which is the one\r\nthat immediately concerns us, may be not without significance.\r\n\r\nThe London fever of 1685-86 having been suspected at the time to be the\r\nforerunner of a plague, as other such fevers in the earlier part of the\r\ncentury had been, and no plague having ensued, the question arises most\r\nnaturally at this stage, why the plague should have never come back in\r\nLondon or elsewhere in Britain after the great outbreak of 1665-66.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extinction of Plague in Britain.\r\n\r\nPlague had been the grand infective disease of Britain from the year of\r\nthe Black Death, 1348-9, for more than three centuries, down to 1666. The\r\nlast of plague in Scotland was in 1647-8, in the west and north-west of\r\nEngland about 1650 (in Wales probably in 1636-8), in Ireland in 1650, and\r\nin all other parts of the kingdom including London in 1666, the absolute\r\nlast of its provincial prevalence having been at Peterborough in the first\r\nmonths of 1667[53], while two or three occasional deaths continued to\r\noccur annually in London down to 1679. False reports of plague,\r\ncontradicted by public advertisement, were circulated for Bath in\r\n1675[54], and for Newcastle in 1710[55]; while in London as late as 1799,\r\nduring a bad time of typhus fever, the occurrence of plague was\r\nalleged[56].\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to say why the plague should have died out. It had been\r\ncontinuous in England from 1348, at first in general epidemics, all over\r\nthe country in certain years, thereafter mostly in the towns, either in\r\ngreat explosions at long intervals or at a moderate level for years\r\ntogether. The final outburst in 1665, which was one of the most severe in\r\nits whole history, had followed an unusually long period of freedom from\r\nplague in London, and was followed, as it were, by a still longer period\r\nof freedom until at last it could be said that the plague was extinct. In\r\nsome large towns it had been extinct, as the event showed, at a much\r\nearlier date; thus at York the last known epidemic was in 1604, and it can\r\nhardly be doubted that many other towns in England, Scotland and Ireland\r\nwould have closed their records of plague earlier than they did had not\r\nthe sieges and military occupations of the Civil Wars given especial\r\noccasion for the seeds of the infection to spring into life. Plague seemed\r\nto be dying out all over England and Scotland (in Ireland it is little\r\nheard of except in connexion with the Elizabethan and Cromwellian\r\nconquests) for some time before its final grand explosion in London in\r\n1665.\r\n\r\nIn seeking for the causes of its decline and extinction we must keep\r\nprominently in view the fact that the virus was brought into the country\r\nfrom abroad as the Black Death of 1348-9. But for that importation it is\r\nconceivable that there would have been no signal history of plague in\r\nBritain. Its original prevalence was on a great scale, and there were\r\nseveral other widespread epidemics throughout the rest of the 14th\r\ncentury. In the first volume of this history I have collected evidence\r\nthat plague was endemic or steady for long periods of the 15th and 16th\r\ncenturies in London, with greater outbursts at intervals, and that in the\r\n17th century it came chiefly in great explosions. Something must have\r\nserved to keep the virus in the country, and more especially in the towns,\r\nuntil at length it was exhausted. An exotic infection, or one that had not\r\narisen from indigenous conditions, and would probably never have so\r\narisen, does not remain indefinitely in the country to which it is\r\nimported. Thus Asiatic cholera, imported into Europe on six, or perhaps\r\nfive, occasions in the 19th century, has never become domesticated; and\r\nyellow fever had a career in the southern provinces of Spain during some\r\ntwenty years only. Plague did become domesticated for about three\r\ncenturies in England, and for longer in some other countries of Europe;\r\nbut it died out at length, and it would almost certainly have died out\r\nsooner had it not found in all European countries some conditions not\r\naltogether unsuited to it. What were the favouring conditions?\r\n\r\nIf, as I believe, the virus of plague had its habitat in the soil, from\r\nwhich it rose in emanations, and if it depended therein, both remotely for\r\nits origin in some distant country, as well as immediately for its\r\ncontinuance in all countries, upon the decomposition of human bodies, then\r\nit is easy to understand that the immense mortalities caused by each\r\nepidemic would preserve the seeds of the disease, or the crude matters of\r\nthe disease, in the soil. Buried plague-bodies would be the most obvious\r\nsources of future plagues. But if the theory given of the Black Death be\r\ncorrect, bodies dead of famine or famine-fever would also favour in an\r\nespecial way the continuance of the plague-virus in certain spots of\r\nground, although they would probably never have originated it in this\r\ncountry. Moreover, the products of ordinary cadaveric decomposition would\r\nbe so much pabulum or nutriment for the continuance of the virus. But all\r\nthose things being constant, the continuance of plague would largely\r\ndepend upon the manner in which the dead, after plague, or after famine\r\nand fever, or in general, were disposed of. The soil of all England in\r\n1348-9 was filled with multitudes of the dead laid in trenches, and there\r\nwere several general revivals of plague in the fifty or sixty years\r\nfollowing. In London there were plague-pits opened in the suburbs in many\r\ngreat epidemics during three centuries. Even when there was no epidemic\r\nthe dead were laid in the ground in such a manner that their resolution\r\nwas speedy, and the diffusion of the products unchecked. But it is\r\nundoubted that greater care in the disposal of the dead did at length come\r\ninto vogue. Thus, in the Black Book of the Corporation of Tewkesbury there\r\nis an entry under the year 1603, that all those dead of plague, “to avoid\r\nthe perill, were buried in coffins of bourde,” the disease having carried\r\noff no fewer than 560 the year before (1602) and being then in its second\r\nseason.[57]. The reason given is “to avoid the peril,” and it is beyond\r\nquestion that burial in a coffin did in fact delay decomposition (unless\r\nin peculiar circumstances which need not be particularized), and kept the\r\ncadaveric products from passing quickly and freely into the pores of the\r\nground. Again, if the burial were in such coffins as the Chinese commonly\r\nuse, the decomposition would proceed almost as slowly as if the body had\r\nbeen embalmed, and with as little risk of befouling the soil. For a long\r\ntime in England such burials were the privilege only of the rich; but as\r\nwealth increased by commerce they became the privilege of all classes; and\r\nin the last great plague of London, as I said in my former volume, “even\r\nat the worst time coffins would seem to have been got for most.” Defoe’s\r\naccount of the burials in heaps in plague-pits is so exactly like that of\r\nDekker for the plague of 1603, and of other contemporaries for the plague\r\nof 1625, that one may reasonably suspect him to have used these earlier\r\naccounts as his authority for the practice in 1665, which he had no\r\ndirect knowledge of. However, I do not contend that there were no such\r\nburials in 1665; just as one learns from Dekker that the coffin-makers in\r\n1603 were busily employed and grew rich, although he also describes how a\r\nhusband “saw his wife and his deadly enemy whom he hated” launched into\r\nthe pit “within a pair of sheets.” In ordinary times, as we learn from the\r\ntables of burial-dues, there were poorer interments without coffins as\r\nlate as 1628, according to a document printed by Spelman, the name of the\r\nparish being withheld, and even as late as 1672 in the parish of St\r\nGiles’s, Cripplegate. Spelman’s object in writing in 1641 was to protest\r\nagainst the mercenary practices of the clergy in the matter of burial,\r\nrecalling the numerous canons of the medieval Church directed against all\r\nsuch forms of simony; and incidentally he mentions that it was testified\r\nbefore the Commissioners that a certain parson “had made forty pound of\r\none grave in ten yeeres, by ten pounds at a time”[58]--a “tenancy of the\r\nsoil” short enough to satisfy even the so-called Church of England Burial\r\nReform Association. The use of coffins in the burial of the very poorest\r\nis now so universal that we hardly realize how gradually it was\r\nintroduced. I am unable to say when burial in a sheet or cerecloth ceased;\r\nbut it became less and less the rule for the poorer classes throughout the\r\n17th century. In 1666 was passed the Act for burial in woollen, which was\r\nre-enacted more strictly in 1678[59]. The motive of it was to encourage\r\nthe native woollen manufactures, or to prevent the money of the country\r\nfrom being expended on foreign-made linen; and its clauses ordained that\r\nwoollen should be substituted for linen in the lining of the coffin and in\r\nthe shrouding of the corpse, but that no penalty should be exacted for\r\nburying in linen any that shall die of the plague. Whether it prohibited\r\nin effect the use of linen cerecloths to enshroud corpses where no coffin\r\nwas used does not appear clearly from the terms of the Act; but, as the\r\nintention was to discourage the use of linen, and to bring in the use of\r\nwoollen, for all purposes of burial, it is probable that it served to put\r\nan end to coffinless burials altogether, wherever it was enforced,\r\ninasmuch as the prescribed material was wholly unsuited for the purpose of\r\na cerecloth.\r\n\r\nThe history of the London plague-pit between Soho and the present Regent\r\nStreet shows that, after the last great plague of 1665-66, more caution\r\nwas used against infection from the buried plague-bodies. Macaulay says it\r\nwas popularly believed that the earth was deeply tainted with infection,\r\nand could not be disturbed without imminent risk to human life; and he\r\nasserts that no foundations were laid in the pest-field till two\r\ngenerations had passed and till the spot had long been surrounded with\r\nbuildings, the space being left blank in maps of London as late as the end\r\nof George I.’s reign[60].\r\n\r\nAfter 1666 the old churchyards were not less crowded than before, but more\r\ncrowded, perhaps because coffined corpses occupied more space and decayed\r\nmore slowly. On 17 October, 1672, Evelyn paid a visit to Norwich: “I\r\nobserved that most of the churchyards (tho’ some of them large enough)\r\nwere filled up with earth, or rather the congestion of dead bodys one upon\r\nanother, for want of earth, even to the very top of the walls, and some\r\nabove the walls, so as the churches seemed to be built in pitts.” The same\r\nday he had visited Sir Thomas Browne, the author of the famous essay on\r\nurn burial or cremation, (suggested to him by the digging up of forty or\r\nfifty funeral urns in a field at Old Walsingham). The essay is full of\r\ncurious learning and equally curious moralizing. But Sir Thomas, though a\r\nphysician, has not a word to say on so proximate a topic as the state of\r\nthe Norwich churchyards, which came under his eyes and perhaps under his\r\nnose every day of his life[61].\r\n\r\nThe practice of burying in coffins, which came at length within the means\r\nof all classes, may seem too paltry a cause to assign, even in part, for\r\nso remarkable an effect as the absolute disappearance of plague after a\r\nduration of more than three centuries. My view of the matter is that the\r\nvirus would have died out of itself had it not been continually augmented,\r\nor fed by its appropriate pabulum, and that the gradual change in the mode\r\nof interment helped to check such augmentation or feeding.\r\n\r\nBut the more elaborate interment of the dead was itself an index of the\r\ngreater spending power of the community, and it may be said that it was\r\nthe better condition of the people, and not this one particular thing in\r\nit, which put an end to the periodical recurrences of plague. In all but\r\nits earliest outbursts in the fourteenth, and perhaps the fifteenth\r\ncentury, plague had been peculiarly an infection of the poor, being known\r\nas “the poor’s plague.” Perhaps the chief reason why the richer classes\r\nusually escaped it was that they fled from the plague-tainted place,\r\nleaving the poorer classes unable to stir from their homes, exposed to the\r\ninfectious air, and all the more exposed that their habitual employments\r\nand wages would cease, their sustenance become precarious, their condition\r\nlowered, and their manners reckless. Again, it was not unusual for the\r\nplague to break out in a season of famine or scarcity, during which the\r\nordinary risks of the labouring class would be aggravated. Famines ceased\r\n(except in Ireland, where there had been comparatively little plague), and\r\nscarcities became less common. The sieges and occupations of the Civil\r\nWars in the middle of the 17th century, which undoubtedly were the\r\noccasion of the last outbursts of plague in many of the towns, were a\r\nbrief experience, followed by unbroken tranquillity. Whatever things were\r\ntending to the removal of plague in all its old seats had free course\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one may make too much of the increase of well-being\r\namong the labouring class which coincided with the cessation of plague. As\r\na check upon population plague worked in a very remarkable way. In London,\r\nas well as in towns like Newcastle and Chester, plague towards the end of\r\nits reign arose perhaps once in a generation and made a clean sweep of a\r\nfifth or a fourth part of the inhabitants, including hardly any of the\r\nwell-to-do. It destroyed, of course, many bread-winners and many that were\r\nnot absolutely sunk in poverty; but its broad effect was to cut off the\r\nmargin of poverty as if by a periodical process of pruning. The Lord Mayor\r\nof London wrote to the Privy Council at the end of the great plague of\r\n1625: “The great mortality, although it had taken many poor people away,\r\nyet had made more poverty by decay of tradesmen”--a decay of trade which\r\nthey might reasonably expect to recover from before long. No such ruthless\r\nshears was ever applied at intervals to the growing fringe of poverty in\r\nafter times. The poor were a more permanent residue, pressing more upon\r\neach other; but they did not press more upon the rich, except through the\r\npoor rate; on the contrary, the separation of classes became more marked.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I ought to give an illustration of this, so as not to leave so\r\nradical a change in the vague and disputable form of a generality. I shall\r\ntake the instance of Chester; its circuit of walls, remaining from the\r\nRoman conquest, is something fixed for the imagination to rest upon amidst\r\nchanges within and without them.\r\n\r\n    Passing over its medieval and its not infrequent Tudor experiences of\r\n    epidemic sickness, let us come to the beginning of the 17th century.\r\n    In two or three successive seasons from 1602 to 1605 it lost 1,313\r\n    persons by plague, as well as about 250 from other causes. The\r\n    population was then mostly within the walls, and probably did not\r\n    exceed 5000. There was a shipping quarter on the west side, with\r\n    egress by the Water-gate to the landing-places on the Dee; a millers’\r\n    quarter, with corn-market and hostelries, on the south, connecting by\r\n    the South gate and bridge with a hamlet across the river along the\r\n    road to Wales; a Liberty or Freedom of the city outside the walls on\r\n    the east, along the road to Warrington and Manchester, with a Bar, a\r\n    short distance out, as in London, to mark the limit of the mayor’s\r\n    jurisdiction; and on the north side, within the walls, the\r\n    cattle-market and shambles, with the market for country produce, and a\r\n    few straggling houses without the gate on the road leading to\r\n    Liverpool. Chester was a characteristic county town, with its\r\n    cathedral clergy, its garrison, its resident nobility and gentry, its\r\n    professional classes, its tradesmen, market people and populace, with\r\n    the addition of a shipping trade to Ireland and afterwards to foreign\r\n    and colonial ports. Plague continuing from 1602 to 1605 cut off a\r\n    fourth or a fifth of its population, and these the poorest. The gaps\r\n    in the population would gradually have filled up, and the fringe of\r\n    poverty grown again[62].\r\n\r\n    The plague came again in 1647, and cut off 2053 in the short space of\r\n    twenty-three weeks from 22 June to 30 November. The bills of it are\r\n    extant[63], and show on what parishes the plague fell most. All the\r\n    parishes were originally within the walls but one, St John’s, the\r\n    ancient collegiate church of Mercia, built upon a rocky knoll in the\r\n    south-east angle made by the walls with the river. The other nine\r\n    parish churches and their graveyards were within the walls; but the\r\n    parishes of three of them extended beyond the gates, just as the three\r\n    parishes dedicated to St Botolph at the gates of London did. These\r\n    three were St Oswald’s, which included the Liberty on the east side,\r\n    Trinity, which included the shipping quarter on the west as well as\r\n    the houses along the Liverpool road on the north, and St Mary’s, which\r\n    included the millers’ suburb across the Dee on the south. Hollar’s\r\n    map, made a few years after the plague of 1647, shows very few houses\r\n    beyond the walls, except in the ancient Liberty on the east. But it\r\n    will appear from the following table that the parishes which had\r\n    extended beyond the walls must either have been very crowded close up\r\n    to the walls (as the Gate parishes were always apt to be), or there\r\n    must have actually been a greater population outside the gates than\r\n    the contemporary map shows:\r\n\r\n    _Burials from Plague in the several Parishes of Chester in 23 weeks,\r\n    June 22-Nov. 30, 1647._\r\n\r\n    _5 parishes wholly within the walls._\r\n\r\n                     Total.

The population of 14,713 was then divided\r\n    into two almost distinct parts, separated by the wall. The old city\r\n    was being rebuilt, all but some ancient blocks of buildings held in\r\n    the dead hand of the cathedral chapter; it was becoming a model 18th\r\n    century place of residence for a wealthy and refined class, who were\r\n    remarkably healthy and not very prolific, the parishes wholly within\r\n    the walls having 3502 inhabitants. The poorer class had gone to live\r\n    mostly outside the walls in new and mean suburbs, the three parishes\r\n    at the Gates and extending now far beyond the walls, together with the\r\n    original extramural parish of St John’s, having a population of\r\n    11,211. There was no town in Britain where the separation of the rich\r\n    from the poor was more complete; there was hardly another town of the\r\n    size where the health of the rich was better; and although the health\r\n    of the populace was not so bad as in the manufacturing towns of\r\n    Lancashire and Cumberland, close at hand, yet it is hardly possible to\r\n    find so great a contrast as that between the clean and wholesome\r\n    residential quarter within the walls and the mean fever-stricken\r\n    suburbs as described by Haygarth in 1774:\r\n\r\n    “The inhabitants of the suburbs,” he says, “are generally of the\r\n    lowest rank; they want most of the conveniences and comforts of life;\r\n    their houses are small, close, crowded and dirty; their diet affords\r\n    very bad nourishment, and their cloaths are seldom changed or\r\n    washed.... These miserable wretches, even when they go abroad, carry a\r\n    poisonous atmosphere round their bodies that is distinguished by a\r\n    noisome and offensive smell, which is peculiarly disgustful even to\r\n    the healthy and vigorous, exciting sickness and a sense of general\r\n    debility. It cannot therefore be wondered that diseases should be\r\n    produced where such poison is inspired with every breath.”\r\n\r\nThe case of Chester shows by broader contrasts than anywhere else the\r\nchange from the public health of plague-times to that of more modern\r\ntimes. But it can hardly be said to show the populace better off than\r\nbefore; it shows them changed into a proletariat, and separated from the\r\nricher classes by walls several feet thick. Such, at least, was the result\r\nafter four generations of immunity from plague, a result which indicates,\r\nas I have said, that we may easily make too much of the improved\r\nwell-being of the poorer classes as a cause of the cessation of plague.\r\n\r\nAn easy explanation of plague ceasing in London has long been current, and\r\njust because it is an easy explanation it will probably hold the field for\r\nmany years to come. It is that the fire of 1666 burnt out the seeds of\r\nplague. Defoe, writing in 1723, ascribed this opinion to certain “quacking\r\nphilosophers,” but he would hardly have said so if he could have foreseen\r\nthe respectable authority for it in after times. The plague had ceased in\r\nmost of its provincial centres after the Civil Wars, and in some of them,\r\nsuch as York, from as early a date as 1604. It ceased in all the principal\r\ncities of Western Europe within a few years of its cessation in London. In\r\nLondon itself it ceased after 1666, not only in the City which was the\r\npart burned down in September of that year, but in St Giles’s, where the\r\nGreat Plague began, in Cripplegate, Whitechapel and Stepney, where it was\r\nalways worst, in Southwark, Bermondsey and Newington, in Lambeth and\r\nWestminster. Nor can it be said that the City was the source from which\r\nthe infection used to spread to the Liberties and out-parishes. All the\r\nlater plagues of London, perhaps even that of 1563, began in the Liberties\r\nor out-parishes and at length invaded the City. The part of London that\r\nwas rebuilt after 1666 contained many finer dwelling-houses than before,\r\nbuilt of stone, with substantial carpentry, and elegantly finished in fine\r\nand rare woods. The fronts of the new houses did not overhang so as to\r\nobstruct the ventilation of the streets and lanes; but the streets, lanes,\r\nalleys and courts were somewhat closely reproduced on the old foundations.\r\nA side walk in some streets was secured for foot-passengers by means of\r\nmassive posts, which, with the projecting signs of houses and shops, were\r\nat length removed in 1766. The improvements in the City after the fire\r\nwere mostly in the houses of the richer citizens. The City was the place\r\nof residence of the rich, with perhaps as many poorer purlieus in close\r\nproximity as the residential districts of London now have. But four-fifths\r\nof London at the time of the fire were beyond the walls of the City. It is\r\nin these extramural regions that the interest mostly lies for epidemical\r\ndiseases. They remain, says Defoe in 1723, “still in the same condition\r\nthey were in before.” Unfortunately we know little of their condition,\r\nwhether in the 17th century or in the 18th. But there must have been\r\nsomething in it most unfavourable to health; for we find from the Bills of\r\nMortality that the cessation of plague made hardly any difference to the\r\nannual average of deaths, the increase of population being allowed for.\r\nThis fact makes the disappearance of plague all the more remarkable.\r\n\r\n\r\nFevers to the end of the 17th century.\r\n\r\nThe epidemical seasons of 1685-86 were the last that Sydenham recorded; he\r\nwas shortly after laid aside from active work by gout, and died in 1689.\r\nMorton, who made notes of fevers and smallpox until 1694, is more a\r\nclinical observer than a student of “epidemic constitutions”; and although\r\nhis writings are of value to the epidemiologist, he does not help us to\r\nunderstand the circumstances in which epidemic diseases prevailed more at\r\none time than another. To the end of the century there is no other medical\r\nsource of information, and little besides generalities to be collected\r\nfrom any source. It is known that the years from 1693 to 1699 were years\r\nof scarcity all over the kingdom, that the fever-deaths in London reached\r\nthe high figure of 5036 in 1694, and that there was a high mortality in\r\nmany country parishes and market towns during the scarcity. But there are\r\nfew particular illustrations of the type of epidemic sickness. There is,\r\ntherefore, little left to do but to give the figures, and to add some\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\n_Fever Deaths in the London Bills, 1687-1700._\r\n\r\n                     Spotted  Deaths\r\n            Fever    fever   from all\r\n  Year     deaths    deaths   causes\r\n\r\n  1687      2847      144     21460\r\n  1688      3196      139     22921\r\n  1689      3313      129     23502\r\n  1690      3350      203     21461\r\n  1691      3490      193     22691\r\n  1692      3205      161     20874\r\n  1693      3211      199     20959\r\n  1694      5036      423     24109\r\n  1695      3019      105     19047\r\n  1696      2775      102     18638\r\n  1697      3111      137     20292\r\n  1698      3343      274     20183\r\n  1699      3505      306     20795\r\n  1700      3675      189     19443\r\n\r\n_Tables from Short’s Abstracts of Parish Registers._\r\n\r\n          Registers    Registers with     Deaths     Births\r\n  Year    examined     excess of death   in them    in them\r\n\r\n  _Country Parishes._\r\n\r\n  1689       144             27            828        692\r\n  1690       146             17            532        324\r\n  1691       147             16            336        180\r\n  1692       147             10            207        146\r\n  1693       146             27            650        426\r\n  1694       148             18            465        348\r\n  1695       149             23            649        492\r\n  1696       150             19            503        344\r\n  1697       150             21            559        409\r\n  1698       152             12            397        289\r\n  1699       151             20            433        318\r\n  1700       160             29            890        739\r\n\r\n  _Market Towns._\r\n\r\n  1689        25             12           1965       1415\r\n  1693        25              5            417        338\r\n  1694        25              6           1307        681\r\n  1695        25              3            309        246\r\n  1696        26              4           1020        708\r\n  1697        26              2            109         80\r\n  1698        26              4            575        423\r\n  1699        26              7           1181        867\r\n  1700        27              4            726        587\r\n\r\nIn the London figures the year 1694 stands out conspicuous by its deaths\r\nfrom all causes, and by its high total of fevers. The fever-deaths began\r\nto rise from their steady weekly level a little before Christmas, 1693,\r\nand remained high all through the year 1694, with a good many deaths from\r\n“spotted fever” in the worst weeks. Among the victims in London in\r\nFebruary was Sir William Phipps, Governor of New England: his illness\r\nappeared at first to be a cold, which obliged him to keep his chamber; but\r\nit proved “a sort of malignant fever, whereof many about this time died in\r\nthe city[65].” Pepys, writing to Evelyn on 10 August, 1694, calls it “the\r\nfever of the season,” three being down with it at his house, but well\r\nadvanced in their recovery. In that week and in the week following, the\r\ndeaths in London from all causes touched the highest points of the year,\r\nthe deaths from fever and spotted fever being a full quarter of them.\r\nFever at its worst in London never made more than a quarter of the annual\r\ndeaths from all causes; so that, if we take it to have been the successor\r\nof the plague, it operated in a very different way--with a greatly\r\nlessened fatality of all that were attacked, with only a reminder of the\r\nold special incidence upon the summer and autumn seasons, but with a\r\nsteadiness from year to year, and throughout each year, that made the\r\nfever-deaths of a generation little short of one of those enormous totals\r\nof plague-deaths that were rapidly piled up during a few months, perhaps\r\nonce or twice in a generation.\r\n\r\nThe following table from the London weekly Bills shows the progress of the\r\nfever from the end of April, 1694, with the number of deaths specially\r\nassigned to “spotted fever”:--\r\n\r\n_London: Weekly Mortalities from fever and all causes, epidemic of 1694._\r\n\r\n  Week              Spotted   All\r\n  ending     Fever   fever   deaths\r\n\r\n  April 24     90      15    427\r\n  May    1     77      10    369\r\n         8     89       9    413\r\n        15     80       5    395\r\n        22    101       3    428\r\n        29     72       8    430\r\n  June   5    112      12    469\r\n        12    113      12    434\r\n        19    113      11    430\r\n        26     99      14    396\r\n  July   3     94      11    423\r\n        17     86      10    445\r\n        24    115      13    507\r\n        31     84      13    484\r\n  Aug.   7     99      10    462\r\n        14    110      20    530\r\n        21    135      19    583\r\n        28    111      20    510\r\n  Sept.  5    115      16    505\r\n        12    112      12    462\r\n        18     98       9    504\r\n        25    106       4    490\r\n  Oct.   2    124       8    533\r\n         9    125      10    553\r\n        16    114       9    552\r\n        23    104       3    511\r\n        30    118       3    528\r\n  Nov.   6     70       3    439\r\n        10     89       7    453\r\n        13    106       2    471\r\n        20    117      13    538\r\n        27     79       6    456\r\n  Dec.   4     87       6    475\r\n        11     87       3    407\r\n        18     78       4    445\r\n        25     66       3    394\r\n\r\nThe year 1694, to which the epidemic of malignant fever (as well as\r\nmalignant smallpox) belongs, was one of the series of “seven ill years” at\r\nthe end of the 17th century (1693-99). They were long noted, says Thorold\r\nRogers, “for the distress of the people and for the exalted profits of the\r\nfarmer.” The price of wheat in the autumn and winter of 1693 was the\r\nhighest since the famine of 1661. In 1697-8 corn was again dear and much\r\nof it was spoilt. At Norwich in 1698 wheat was sold at 44_s._ a comb.\r\n\r\nHarvests spoiled by wet weather or unseasonable cold appear to have been\r\nthe most general cause of the high prices of food. In London there was no\r\nunusual sickness except in 1694; indeed the other years to the end of the\r\ncentury show a somewhat low mortality, the year 1696, which Macaulay\r\nmarks as a time of severe distress among the common people owing to the\r\ncalling in of the debased coinage[66], had the smallest number of deaths\r\nfrom all causes (18,638) since many years before, and for a century after\r\nallowing for the increase of population. But the deaths from “fever” were\r\nsome three thousand every year, and the births, so far as registered,\r\nwere, as usual, far below the deaths.\r\n\r\nIt was in the country at large that the effects of the “seven ill years”\r\nwere chiefly felt. According to Short’s abstracts of parish registers,\r\nthere was unusual mortality at the beginning of the period and at the end\r\nof it; in his Chronology he mentions spotted fever, bloody flux and agues\r\nin 1693 (besides an influenza or universal slight fever recorded by\r\nMolyneux of Dublin), and again in 1697 and 1698 “purples, quinsies,\r\nHungarian and spotted fever, universal pestilential spotted fever,” from\r\nfamine and bad food.\r\n\r\nWhen we look for the evidence of this in England we shall have difficulty\r\nin finding it. Short’s own abstracts give almost no colour to it; but\r\nthere are other figures from the parish registers, scattered through the\r\ncounty histories and statistical works, which prove that the seven ill\r\nyears must have checked population. Thus at Sheffield in the ten years\r\n1691-1700 there was the greatest excess of burials over baptisms in the\r\nwhole history of the town from 1561--namely, 2856 burials to 2221 baptisms\r\n(688 marriages). At Minehead, Somerset, a parish of some 1200 people\r\noccupied in weaving, the deaths and births were as follows in four years\r\nof the decennium:\r\n\r\n        Baptised. Buried.\r\n\r\n  1691     57      75\r\n  1694     34      55\r\n  1695     47      48\r\n  1697     35      65\r\n\r\nA glimpse of spotted or pestilential fever in Bristol during the years of\r\ndistress at the end of the 17th century comes from Dr Dover, a man of no\r\nacademical repute, but at all events an articulate voice. Passing from an\r\naccount of the spotted pestilential fever at Guayaquil, “when I took it by\r\nstorm,” he goes on[67]:\r\n\r\n    “About thirty-seven years since [written in 1732], this fever raged\r\n    much in Bristol, so that I visited from twenty-five to thirty patients\r\n    a day for a considerable time, besides their poor children taken into\r\n    their workhouse, where I engaged myself, for the encouragement of so\r\n    good and charitable an undertaking, to find them physick and give them\r\n    advice at my own expense and trouble for the two first years. All\r\n    these poor children in general had this fever, yet no more than one of\r\n    them died of it of the whole number, which was near two hundred.”\r\n\r\n--an experience of typhus in children which was strictly according to\r\nrule. This had clearly been the occasion of a memorial addressed to the\r\nMayor and Aldermen of Bristol, in 1696, praying that a capacious workhouse\r\nshould be erected for children and the aged, which “will prevent children\r\nfrom being smothered or starved by the neglect of the parish officers and\r\npoverty of their parents, which is now a great loss to the nation[68].”\r\n\r\nThe year 1698 was the climax of the seven ill years. The spring was the\r\nmost backward for forty-seven years, the first wheat in the ear being seen\r\nnear London on 16th June. For four months to the end of August the days\r\nwere almost all rainy, except from the 18th to the 26th July. Whole fields\r\nof corn were spoilt. In Kent there was barley standing uncut on 29th\r\nSeptember, and some lay in the swathe until December. Much of the corn in\r\nthe north of England was not got in until Christmas, and in Scotland they\r\nwere reaping the green empty corn in January[69].\r\n\r\n\r\nFevers of the seven ill years in Scotland.\r\n\r\nIt is from Scotland that we hear most of the effects of the seven ill\r\nyears in the way of famine and fever. Scotland was then in a backward\r\nstate compared with England; and its northern climate, making the harvest\r\nalways a few weeks later than in England, told especially against it in\r\nthe ill years. Fynes Morryson, in the beginning of the 17th century,\r\ncontrasts the Scotch manner of life unfavourably with the English, and Sir\r\nRobert Sibbald’s account towards the end of that century is little better.\r\nMorryson says, “the excesse of drinking was then farre greater in generall\r\namong the Scots than the English.” Sibbald remarks[70] on the drinking\r\nhabits of the Scots common people: their potations of ale or spirits on\r\nan empty stomach, especially in the morning, relaxed the fibres and\r\ninduced “erratic fevers of a bad type, bastard pleurisies, ... dropsies,\r\nstupors, lethargies and apoplexies.” Morryson says: “Their bedsteads were\r\nthen like cubbards in the wall, with doores to be opened and shut at\r\npleasure, so as we climbed up to our beds. They used but one sheete, open\r\nat the sides and top, but close at the feete, and so doubled[71].” Sibbald\r\nsays the peasantry had poor food and hard work, and were subject to many\r\ndiseases--“heartburn, sleeplessness, ravings, hypochondriac affections,\r\nmania, dysentery, scrophula, cancer, and a dire troop of diseases which\r\neverywhere now invades the husbandmen that were formerly free from\r\ndiseases.” _Causa a victu est._ Therefore consumption was common enough.\r\nHe has much to say of fevers,--of intermittents, especially in spring and\r\nautumn, catarrhal fevers, nervous fevers, comatose fevers, with delirium,\r\nspasms and the like symptoms, malignant, spotted, pestilential, hectic,\r\n&c. The continued fevers ranged in duration from fifteen to thirty-one\r\ndays, recovery being ushered in with sweats, alvine flux and salivation.\r\nPurple fevers had sometimes livid or black spots mixed with the purple\r\n(mottling); in a case given, there were suppurations which appear to have\r\nbeen bubonic. There had been no plague in Scotland since 1647-48; but\r\nfevers, unless Sibbald has given undue prominence to them, would appear to\r\nhave filled its place among the adults.\r\n\r\nAnother writer of this period, from whom some information is got as to\r\nfevers, was Dr Andrew Brown of Edinburgh. He is mainly a controversialist,\r\nand is on the whole of little use save for the history of the treatment of\r\nfevers. He came to London on a visit in 1687, attracted by the fame of\r\nSydenham’s method of curing fevers by antimonial emetics and by purgation:\r\n“Returning home as much overjoyed as I had gotten a treasure, I presently\r\nset myself to that practice”--of which he gave an account in his\r\n‘Vindicatory Schedule concerning the New Cure of Fever[72].’ Continual\r\nfever, he says, takes up, with its pendicles, the half of all the diseases\r\nthat men are afflicted with; and some part of what he calls continual\r\nfever must have been spotted: “As concerning the eruption of spots in\r\nfevers, these altogether resemble the marks made by stroaks on the skin,\r\nand these marks are also made by the stagnation and coagulation of the\r\nblood in the small channels [according to the doctrine of\r\nobstructions].... They tinge the skin with blewness or redness.”\r\n\r\nThe bitter controversy as to the treatment of fevers led Brown into\r\nanother writing in 1699[73].\r\n\r\n    “The fevers that reign at this time [it was towards the end of the\r\n    seven ill years] are for the most part quick and peracute, and cut off\r\n    in a few days persons of impure bodies. And as I have used this method\r\n    by vomiting and purging in many, and most successfully at this time,\r\n    so I have had lately considerable experience thereof in my own family:\r\n    wherein four of my children and ten servants had the fever, and\r\n    blessed be God, are all recovered, by repeated vomiting with\r\n    antimonial vomits and frequent purgings, except two servants, the one\r\n    having gotten a great stress at work, who bragging of his strength did\r\n    contend with his neighbour at the mowing of hay, and presently\r\n    sickened and died the sixth day, and whom I saw not till the day\r\n    before he died, and found him in such a condition that I could not\r\n    give him either vomit or purge: and the other was his neighbour who\r\n    strove with him, being a man of most impure and emaciate body, who had\r\n    endured want and stress before he came to my service, and who got not\r\n    all was necessary because he had not the occasion of due attendance,\r\n    all my servants being sick at the time[74].”\r\n\r\nThis account of the experience which Dr Andrew Brown had lately had among\r\nhis children and domestics in or near Edinburgh was written in 1699, and\r\nmay be taken as relating to part of the wide-spread sickliness of the\r\nseven ill years in Scotland. Fletcher of Saltoun gives us a general view\r\nof the deplorable state of Scotland at the end of the 17th century, which\r\nwas intensified by the succession of bad harvests[75]. The rents of\r\ncultivated farms were paid, not in money, but in corn, which gave occasion\r\nto many inequalities, to the traditional fraudulent practices of millers\r\nand to usury. The pasture lands for sheep and black cattle had no shelters\r\nfrom the weather, and no winter provision of hay or straw (roots were\r\nunheard of until long after), “so that the beasts are in a dying\r\ncondition.” The country swarmed with vagrants (a hundred thousand, he\r\nestimates, in ordinary times, but doubled in the dear years), who lived\r\nand multiplied in incest, rioted in swarms in the nearest hills in times\r\nof plenty, and in times of distress fell upon farmhouses in gangs of\r\nforty or more, demanding food. Besides these there were a great many poor\r\nfamilies very meanly provided for by the Church boxes, who lived wholly\r\nupon bad food and fell into various diseases. He had been credibly\r\ninformed that some families in the years of mere scarcity preceding the\r\nclimax of 1698-99 had eaten grains, for want of bread. “In the worst time,\r\nfrom unwholesome food diseases are so multiplied among poor people that,\r\nif some course be not taken, the famine may very probably be followed by a\r\nplague[76].”\r\n\r\nWe owe some details of these calamities in Scotland to Patrick Walker, the\r\nCovenanter, who records them to show how the prophecies of Divine\r\nvengeance on the land, uttered during the Stuart persecutions by Cargill\r\nand Peden, had been in due time fulfilled[77]:\r\n\r\n    “In the year 1694, in the month of August, that crop got such a stroke\r\n    in one night by east mist or fog standing like mountains (and where it\r\n    remained longest and thickest the badder were the effects, which all\r\n    our old men, that had seen frost, blasting and mildewing, had never\r\n    seen the like) that it got little more good of the ground. In November\r\n    that winter many were smitten with wasting sore fluxes and strange\r\n    fevers (which carried many off the stage) of such a nature and manner\r\n    that all our old physicians had never seen the like and could make no\r\n    help; for all things that used to be proper remedies proved\r\n    destructive. And this was not to be imputed to bad unwholesome\r\n    victual; for severals who had plenty of old victual did send to\r\n    Glasgow for Irish meal, and yet were smitten with fluxes and fevers in\r\n    a more violent and infectious nature and manner than the poorest in\r\n    the land, whose names and places where they dwelt I could instance.\r\n\r\n    “These unheard-of manifold judgments continued seven years, not always\r\n    alike, but the seasons, summer and winter, so cold and barren, and the\r\n    wonted heat of the sun so much withholden, that it was discernible\r\n    upon the cattle, flying fowls and insects decaying, that seldom a fly\r\n    or gleg was to be seen. Our harvests not in the ordinary months, many\r\n    shearing in November and December, yea some in January and February;\r\n    the names of the places I can instruct. Many contracting their deaths,\r\n    and losing the use of their feet and hands, shearing and working\r\n    amongst it in frost and snow; and after all some of it standing still,\r\n    and rotting upon the ground, and much of it for little use either to\r\n    man or beast, and which had no taste or colour of meal. Meal became so\r\n    scarce that it was at two shillings a peck, and many could not get it.\r\n\r\n    “Through the long continuance of these manifold judgments deaths and\r\n    burials were so many and common that the living were wearied with\r\n    burying of the dead. I have seen corpses drawn in sleds. Many got\r\n    neither coffins nor winding-sheet.\r\n\r\n    “I was one of four who carried the corpse of a young woman a mile of\r\n    way; and when we came to the grave, an honest poor man came and said,\r\n    ‘You must go and help me to bury my son, he is lien dead this two\r\n    days; otherwise I will be obliged to bury him in my own yard.’ We\r\n    went, and there were eight of us had two miles to carry the corpse of\r\n    that young man, many neighbours looking on us, but none to help us. I\r\n    was credibly informed, that in the North, two sisters on a Monday’s\r\n    morning were found carrying the corpse of their brother on a barrow\r\n    with bearing-ropes, resting themselves many times, and none offering\r\n    to help them.\r\n\r\n    “I have seen some walking about at sunsetting, and next day at six\r\n    o’clock in the summer morning found dead in their houses, without\r\n    making any stir at their death, their head lying upon their hand, with\r\n    as great a smell as if they had been four days dead; the mice or rats\r\n    having eaten a great part of their hands and arms.\r\n\r\n    “The nearer and sorer these plagues seized, the sadder were their\r\n    effects, that took away all natural and relative affections, so that\r\n    husbands had no sympathy with their wives, nor wives with their\r\n    husbands, parents with their children, nor children with their\r\n    parents. These and other things have made me to doubt if ever any of\r\n    Adam’s race were in a more deplorable condition, their bodies and\r\n    spirits more low, than many were in these years.”\r\n\r\n    In the parish of West Calder, 300 out of 900 “examinable” persons\r\n    wasted away.\r\n\r\n    Some facts and traditions of the Seven Ill Years were recorded nearly\r\n    a century after in the Statistical Account of Scotland. From the Kirk\r\n    Session records of the parish of Fordyce, Banffshire, it did not\r\n    appear “that any public measures were pursued for the supply of the\r\n    poor, nor anything uncommon done by the Session except towards the\r\n    end. The common distribution of the collections of the church amounted\r\n    only to about 1_s._ 2_d._ or 1_s._ 4_d._ weekly.” The Kirk Session\r\n    records bore witness to the numerous cases of immorality in the years\r\n    before the famine that had been dealt with ecclesiastically, and to\r\n    the entire and speedy cessation of such cases thereafter[78].\r\n\r\n    The account for the parish of Keithhall and Kinkell, Aberdeenshire,\r\n    says that “many died of want, in particular ten Highlanders in a\r\n    neighbouring parish, that of Kemnay; so that the Session got a bier\r\n    made to carry them to the grave, not being able to afford coffins for\r\n    such a number[79].” In the upland parish of Montquhitter, in the same\r\n    county, the dear years reduced the population by one half or more.\r\n    Until 1709 many farms were waste. Of sixteen families that resided on\r\n    the estate of Lettertie, thirteen were extinguished. The account of\r\n    this parish contains several stories of the distress, with the names\r\n    of individuals[80]. It is clear, however, that all the parishes of\r\n    Scotland were not equally distressed. The county of Moray and “some of\r\n    the best land along the east coast of Buchan and Formartine\r\n    [Aberdeenshire] abounded with seed and bread;” but transport to the\r\n    upland parishes was difficult[81].\r\n\r\nWe may take it that these experiences in the reign of William III. were\r\npeculiar to Scotland; even Ireland, which had troubles enough of the same\r\nkind in the 18th and 19th centuries, was at that time resorted to as a\r\nplace of refuge by the distressed Scots. Among the special and temporary\r\ncauses in Scotland were antiquated agricultural usage, an almost\r\nincredible proportion of the people in a state of lawless vagrancy, such\r\nas Henry VIII. and Elizabeth had to deal with a century and a half before,\r\na low state of morals, both commercial and private, a tyrannical\r\ndisposition of the employers, a sullen attitude of the labourers, and a\r\ntotal decay of the spirit of charity. An ancient elder of the parish of\r\nFordyce, who kept some traditions of the dear years, remarked to the\r\nminister: “If the same precautions had been taken at that time which he\r\nhad seen taken more lately in times of scarcity, the famine would not have\r\ndone so much hurt, nor would so many have perished.”\r\n\r\nThe evil of vagrancy, for which Fletcher of Saltoun saw no remedy but a\r\nstate of slavery not unlike that which Protector Somerset had actually\r\nmade the law of England for a couple of years, 1547-49, in somewhat\r\nsimilar circumstances, gradually cured itself without a resort to the\r\npractices of antiquity or of barbarism.\r\n\r\nThe union with England in 1707, by removing the customs duties and opening\r\nthe Colonial trade to Scots shipping (they had a share in the East India\r\ntrade already) gave a remarkable impulse to the manufacture of linen and\r\nto commerce. Such was the demand for Scots linen that, it seemed to De\r\nFoe, “the poor could want no employment”; and it may certainly be taken as\r\na fact that the establishment on a free basis of industries and foreign\r\nmarkets gave Scotland relief from the pauperism and vagrancy, like those\r\nof Ireland in the 18th and 19th centuries, that threatened for a time, and\r\nespecially in the Seven Ill Years, to retard the developement of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor several years after the period of scarcity or famine from 1693 to\r\n1699, the history of fever in Britain presents little for special remark.\r\n\r\nA book of the time was Dr George Cheyne’s _New Theory of Continual Fever_,\r\nLondon, 1701. His theory is that of Bellini and Borelli, which accounted\r\nfor everything in fevers on mechanical principles, and ignored the\r\ninfective element in them. Cheyne does not even describe what the fevers\r\nwere; but in showing how the theory applies, he mentions incidentally the\r\nsymptoms--quick pulse, pain in the head, burning heat, want of sleep,\r\nraving, clear or flame-coloured urine, and morbid strength. Equally\r\ntheoretical is the handling of the subject by Pitcairn. Freind, in his\r\nessays on fevers[82], is mainly occupied with controversial matters of\r\ntreatment, except in connexion with Lord Peterborough’s expedition to\r\nSpain in 1705, as we shall see in a section on sickness of camps and\r\nfleets.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of clinical details from the medical profession, the\r\nfollowing from letters of the time will serve a purpose:\r\n\r\nOn 18 September, 1700, Thomas Bennett writes to Thomas Coke from Paris\r\ngiving an account of the fever of Coke’s brother: His fever is very\r\nviolent upon him, and he has a hickup and twitchings in his face; he is\r\nespecially ill in the night, and has now and then violent sweats. He raved\r\nfor eight days together and in all that time did not get an hour’s sleep.\r\nHe was attended by Dr Helvetius and other physicians. Lady Eastes, her\r\nson, and most of her servants are sick, but they are all on the mending\r\nhand; her steward is dead of a high fever, having been sick but five\r\ndays[83]. These are Paris fevers, the symptoms suggesting typhus,\r\nespecially the prolonged vigil in one of the cases. It is to be remarked\r\nthat they occurred among the upper classes; and it appears that the\r\nuniversal fevers “of a bad type” in France in 1712 did not spare noble\r\nhouses nor even the palace of Louis the Great[84].\r\n\r\nThe following from the London Bills will show the prevalence of fever from\r\nyear to year[85].\r\n\r\n         Dead of      Dead of         Dead of\r\n  Year    Fever    Spotted Fever    all diseases\r\n\r\n  1701     2902          68            20,471\r\n  1702     2682          53            19,481\r\n  1703     3162          74            20,720\r\n  1704     3243          61            22,684\r\n  1705     3290          41            22,097\r\n  1706     2662          54            19,847\r\n  1707     2947          42            21,600\r\n  1708     2738          62            21,291\r\n  1709     3140         118            21,800\r\n  1710     4397         343            24,620\r\n  1711     3461         142            19,833\r\n  1712     3131          96            21,198\r\n  1713     3039         102            21,057\r\n  1714     4631         150            26,569\r\n  1715     3588         161            22,232\r\n  1716     3078         100            24,436\r\n  1717     2940         137            23,446\r\n  1718     3475         132            26,523\r\n  1719     3803         124            28,347\r\n  1720     3910          66            25,454\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London fever of 1709-10.\r\n\r\nThe “seven ill years” were followed by the fine summer and abundant\r\nharvest (although hardly more than half the breadth was sown) of 1699.\r\nScarcity was not a cause of excessive sickness again until 1709-10;\r\nalthough the harvest of 1703 was unfavourable. The price of wheat in 1702\r\nwas 25_s._ 6_d._ per quarter, and continued low for a number of years,\r\nnotwithstanding the war with France. In Marlborough’s wars there were no\r\nwar-prices for farmers, as in the corresponding circumstances a century\r\nafter; on the contrary, corn and produce of all kinds were so cheap that\r\nfarmers had difficulty in paying their rents. The bounty of five shillings\r\nper quarter on exported wheat had given a great impulse to corn-growing,\r\nso that the acreage of wheat sown was much more than the country in an\r\nordinary year required, partly, no doubt, because the bread of the poorer\r\nclasses was largely made from the coarser cereals. The period of abundance\r\nwas broken by the excessively severe winter of 1708-9, one of three\r\nmemorable winters in the 18th century. The frost lasted all over Europe\r\nfrom October to March, and was followed by a greatly deficient crop in\r\n1709. The following shows the rise of the price of the quarter of wheat in\r\nEngland:\r\n\r\n                       _s._  _d._\r\n\r\n  1708    Lady-day      27    3\r\n   \"      Michaelmas    46    3\r\n  1709    Lady-day      57    6\r\n   \"      Michaelmas    81    9\r\n  1710    Lady-day      81    9\r\n\r\nThe export of corn was prohibited in 1709 and again in 1710.\r\n\r\nAn epidemic of fever began in London in the autumn of 1709 and continued\r\nthroughout 1710, in which year the fever-deaths reached the highest total\r\nsince 1694. But it was not altogether a fever of starvation or distress\r\namong the poor, and perhaps not mainly so. There is always the dual\r\nquestion in connexion with fever following bad seasons and high prices:\r\nhow much of it was due to the scarcity, and how much to those states of\r\nsoil and atmosphere upon which the failure of the crop itself depended. An\r\nauthentic case of the malignant fever which began to rage in London in the\r\nautumn of 1709 will both serve to show the remarkable type of at least a\r\nportion, if not the whole of the epidemic, and to prove its incidence upon\r\nthe houses of the rich.\r\n\r\n    The case is recorded by Sir David Hamilton[86]:\r\n\r\n    “About the 5th of October, 1709, the son of that worthy gentleman,\r\n    William Morison, esquire, was seized with a fever; at which time, and\r\n    for some weeks before, a malignant fever raged in London.” He had a\r\n    quick and weak pulse, great difficulty or hindrance of speech, and a\r\n    stupidity; “whereto were added tremors, and startings of the tendons,\r\n    a dry and blackish tongue, a high-coloured but transparent urine and\r\n    coming away for the most part involuntarily, and a hot and dry skin.”\r\n    Dr Grew was called in, and prescribed alexipharmac remedies (cordials,\r\n    sudorifics, etc.) “A few days after the patient’s skin was stained or\r\n    marked with red and purple spots, and especially upon his breast, legs\r\n    and thighs. These symptoms, although a little milder now and then,\r\n    prevailed for fourteen days; after that the spots vanished, and the\r\n    convulsive motions so increased that the young gentleman seemed ready\r\n    to sink under them for several days together.” He was treated with the\r\n    application of blisters, and with doses of bark. His strength and\r\n    flesh were so wasted that the hip whereon he lay was seized with a\r\n    gangrene. For ten or twelve days before his death, “he breathed and\r\n    perspired so offensive a smell that they were obliged to smoke his\r\n    chamber with perfumes; and even myself, whilst I inclined my body a\r\n    little too near him, was, by receiving his breath into my mouth,\r\n    seized all on a sudden with such a sickness and faintness that I was\r\n    obliged to take the air in the open fields, and returning thence to\r\n    drink plentifully of _mountain_ wine at dinner.” The examination after\r\n    death was made by the celebrated anatomist Dr Douglas. There was still\r\n    a heap of brown-coloured spots visible on the breast; “there was\r\n    nothing contained in the more conspicuous vessels of the abdomen but\r\n    grumes or clots of blackish blood, without any serum in the\r\n    interstices.” Hamilton adds: “We too seldom dissect the bodies of\r\n    those dying in fevers.”\r\n\r\nThe tremors, offensive sweats and offensive breath are distinctive of a\r\nform of typhus that became common towards the middle of the century, and\r\nwas called putrid fever (not in the sense of Willis) or miliary fever from\r\nthe watery vesicles of the skin that often attended it. But although\r\nHamilton was writing on miliary fever (of the factitious variety) this\r\ncase is not given as an example, but is appended to his sixteen cases of\r\nthe latter, as an example of “a deadly fever with loss of speech from the\r\nbeginning.” Among earlier cases, those belonging to the epidemic of 1661\r\nas described by Willis correspond closely with this case, which we may\r\ntake as representing part of the malignant fever that then raged in\r\nLondon. We have an anatomical record from each; but in neither was there\r\nsloughing of the lymph-follicles of the intestine, or of the mesenteric\r\nglands, as in the enteric fever of our own time; while in both there were\r\nred or purple spots on the breast or neck, and on the limbs. The “loss of\r\nspeech from the beginning” suggests Sydenham’s “absolute aphonia” in the\r\ncomatose fever of 1673-76, which resembled in other respects Willis’s\r\nfever of the brain and nervous stock (mostly of children) in 1661. One of\r\nthe synonyms of “infantile remittent” was “an acute fever with\r\ndumbness[87].” This seems to have been a common type of fever in the\r\nlatter part of the 17th century and early part of the 18th. Some likeness\r\nto enteric fever may be found in it, but there is no warrant for\r\nidentifying it with that fever. Its main features may be said to have been\r\nits incidence upon the earlier years of life, but not to the exclusion of\r\nadult cases, its remarkable ataxic symptoms, which led Willis to refer it\r\nto “the brain and nervous stock” (spinal cord), its comatose character,\r\nits spots, occasional miliary eruption, ill-smelling sweats and other\r\nfoetid evacuations, its protracted course, and its hectic sequelae.\r\n\r\nThe weekly bills of mortality in London bear little evidence of unusual\r\nprevalence of fever in 1709, except in the weeks ending 13 and 20\r\nSeptember, when the fever-deaths were 96 and 75 (including “spotted\r\nfever”). But the unusual entry of “malignant fever” appears in three\r\nweekly bills, 19 July, 9 August and 23 August, one death being referred to\r\nit on each occasion. It was in the summer and autumn of 1710 that the\r\nfever reached a height in London, being attended with a very fatal\r\nsmallpox. An essay on the London epidemic of 1710[88] is interesting\r\nchiefly for recording a probable case of relapsing fever, a form which was\r\nalmost certainly part of the great febrile epidemic in London in 1727-29.\r\n\r\n    Mrs Simon, aged 20, had a burning fever, stifling of her breath,\r\n    frequent vomiting and looseness, foul tongue, loss of sleep,\r\n    restlessness, intermitting, low and irregular pulse. This terrible\r\n    fever disappeared on the fourth day, and she thought herself\r\n    recovered. But on the seventh day from her being taken ill the fever\r\n    returned, she was light-headed, did not know her relatives, and was\r\n    fevered in the highest degree. It looked like a malignant fever, but\r\n    there were no spots.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the very high mortality from fever (as well as\r\nfrom smallpox) in the epidemic to which the above case belonged.\r\n\r\n_London: Weekly deaths from fever, smallpox and all causes._\r\n\r\n1710.\r\n\r\n  Week       Dead of       Dead of       Dead of       Dead of\r\n  ending      fever     spotted fever    smallpox    all diseases\r\n\r\n    May  2     103       [illegible]        99           571\r\n         9      90             6            60           517\r\n        16      84             7            71           502\r\n        23      93            15            71           503\r\n        30     106            11            83           550\r\n   June  6      93             2            98           508\r\n        13      79             8            84           509\r\n        20     106            12            99           574\r\n        27     105            15            86           503\r\n   July  4     106             7            99           482\r\n        11     107            13            97           467\r\n        18     126            16            89           509\r\n        25     109            13           105           562\r\n   Aug.  1      91            12            79           444\r\n         8      92            11            72           463\r\n        15      98            10            58           459\r\n        22     105            10            63           463\r\n        29     111            16            71           495\r\n  Sept.  5      76             4            63           414\r\n        12[89] 107            12            57           520\r\n        19     115             9            83           548\r\n        26      81            11            46           456\r\n   Oct.  3      98             9            45           469\r\n        10      79            10            49           480\r\n        17      90             5            41           477\r\n        24     107             5            45           470\r\n        31     106            14            51           421\r\n   Nov.  7      71             6            55           425\r\n        14      92             2            41           390\r\n        21      70             4            25           345\r\n\r\nThroughout England, in country parishes and in towns, the first ten years\r\nof the 18th century were on the whole a period of good public health. In\r\nShort’s abstracts of the parish registers to show the excess of deaths\r\nover the births, those years are as little conspicuous as any in the long\r\nseries. It was a time when there was a great lull in smallpox, and\r\nprobably also in fevers. The figures for Sheffield may serve as an\r\nexample[90]. It will be seen from the Table that the burials exceeded the\r\nbaptisms in every decade from the Restoration to the end of the century;\r\nafter that for twenty years the baptisms exceeded the burials, the\r\nmarriages having increased greatly.\r\n\r\n_Vital Statistics of Sheffield._\r\n\r\n  Ten-year\r\n  periods        Marriages     Baptisms     Burials\r\n\r\n  1661-70           585          2086         2266\r\n  1671-80           537          2240         2387\r\n  1681-90           540          2595         2856\r\n  1691-1700         688          2221         2856\r\n  1701-10           942          3033         2613\r\n  1711-20           991          3304         2765\r\n\r\nOf particular epidemics, we hear of a malignant fever at Harwich in 1709.\r\nHarwich was then an important naval station, and the fever may have arisen\r\nin connexion with the transport of troops to and from the seat of war,\r\njust as camp- and war-fevers appeared at various ports in the next war,\r\n1742-48.\r\n\r\nThere were rumours of a plague at Newcastle in 1710, which were\r\ncontradicted by advertisement in the _London Gazette_[91]. But, as there\r\nwas so much plague in the Baltic ports in 1710 it is possible that the\r\nNewcastle rumour may have been one of plague imported, and not a rumour\r\nsuggested by the mortality from some other disease.\r\n\r\nTo the same period of epidemic fever in London, about 1709-10, belongs\r\nalso a curiously localized epidemic in an Oxford college, which reminds\r\none somewhat of the circumstances of enteric fever in our time. It was\r\ntold to Dr Rogers of Cork twenty-five or twenty-six years before the date\r\nof his writing (1734), by one who was a student at Oxford then: “There\r\nbroke out amongst the scholars of Wadham College a fever very malignant,\r\nthat swept away great numbers, whilst the rest of the colleges remained\r\nunvisited. All agreed that the contagious infection arose from the\r\nputrefaction of a vast quantity of cabbages thrown into a heap out of the\r\nseveral gardens near Wadham College[92].”\r\n\r\nThe next epidemic of fever in London was in 1714. Like that of 1710, it\r\nfollowed a great rise in the price of wheat, or perhaps it followed the\r\nunseasonable weather which caused the deficient harvest. Before the Peace\r\nof Utrecht wheat in England was as low as 33_s._ 9_d._ per quarter, in\r\n1712, the peace next year sending it no lower than 30_s._ But at\r\nMichaelmas, 1713, it rose with a bound to 56_s._ 11_d._, doubtless owing\r\nto a bad harvest. The fever-deaths in London began to rise in the spring\r\nof 1714, reaching a weekly total of 103 in the week ending 20 April. All\r\nthrough the summer and autumn they continued very high, the weekly totals\r\nexceeding, on an average, those of the year 1710, as in the foregoing\r\ntable, and having corresponding large additions of “spotted fever.” The\r\ndeaths from all causes in 1714 were a quarter more than those of the year\r\nbefore, the epidemic of fever being the chief contributor to the rise.\r\nThis happened to be a very slack time in medical writing[93]; but, even in\r\nthe absence of such testimony as we have for earlier and later epidemics\r\nof fever in London, we may safely conclude that the fever of 1714 was of\r\nthe type of pestilential or malignant typhus, beginning in early summer\r\nand reaching a height in the old plague season of autumn.\r\n\r\nA singular instance of what may be considered war-typhus belongs to the\r\nwinter of 1715-16. The political intrigues preceding and following the\r\ndeath of Queen Anne in 1714 culminated in the Jacobite rising in Scotland\r\nand the North of England in 1715. The Jacobites having been defeated at\r\nPreston on 13 November, prisoners to the number of 450 were brought to\r\nChester Castle on the Sunday night before December 1st. A fortnight later\r\n(December 15th), Lady Otway writes of the 450 prisoners in the Castle:\r\n\r\n    “They all lie upon straw, the better and the worse alike. The king’s\r\n    allowance is a groat a day for each man for meat, but they are almost\r\n    starved for want of some covering, though many persons are charitable\r\n    to the sick.” The winter was unusually severe, the snow lying “a yard\r\n    deep.” Many prisoners died in the Castle by “the severity of the\r\n    season,” many were carried off by “a very malignant fever.” On\r\n    February 16th Lady Otway writes again:--“So much sickness now in our\r\n    Castle that they dye in droves like rotten sheep, and be 4 or 5 in a\r\n    night throne into the Castle ditch ffor ther graves. The feavour and\r\n    sickness increaseth dayly, is begun to spread much into the citty, and\r\n    many of the guard solidyers is sick, it is thought by inffection. The\r\n    Lord preserve us ffrom plague and pestilence[94]!”\r\n\r\n\r\nProsperity of Britain, 1715-65.\r\n\r\nThe fifty years from 1715 to 1765 were, with two or three exceptions,\r\nmarked by abundant harvests, low prices and heavy exports of corn. This\r\nwas undoubtedly a great time in the expansion of England, a time of\r\nfortune-making for the monied class, and of cheapness of the necessaries\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nThe well-being and comfort of the middle class were undoubtedly great;\r\nalso there was something peculiar to England in the prosperity of towns\r\nand villages throughout all classes. In the very worst year of the period,\r\nthe year 1741, Horace Walpole landed at Dover on the 13th September,\r\nhaving completed the grand tour of Europe. Like many others, he was\r\ndelighted with the pleasant county of Kent as he posted towards London;\r\nand on stopping for the night at Sittingbourne, he wrote as follows in a\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n    “The country town delights me: the populousness, the ease, the gaiety,\r\n    and well-dressed everybody, amaze me. Canterbury, which on my setting\r\n    out I thought deplorable, is a paradise to Modena, Reggio, Parma, etc.\r\n    I had before discovered that there was nowhere but in England the\r\n    distinction of _middling people_. I perceive now that there is\r\n    peculiar to us _middling houses_; how snug they are[95]!”\r\n\r\nOur history henceforth has little to record of malignant typhus fevers, or\r\nof smallpox, in these snug houses of the middle class, although not only\r\nthe middle class, but also the highest class had a considerable share of\r\nthose troubles all through the 17th century. But the 18th century, even\r\nthe most prosperous part of it, from the accession of George I. to the\r\nbeginning of the Industrial Revolution in the last quarter or third of it,\r\nwas none the less a most unwholesome period in the history of England. The\r\nhealth of London was never worse than in those years, and the vital\r\nstatistics of some other towns, such as Norwich, are little more\r\nsatisfactory. This was the time which gave us the saying, that God made\r\nthe country and man made the town. Praise of rural felicity was a common\r\ntheme in the poetry of the time, as in Johnson’s _London_:\r\n\r\n  “There every bush with nature’s music rings,\r\n   There every breeze bears health upon its wings.”\r\n\r\nBoth for the country and the town the history of the public health does\r\nnot harmonize well with the optimist views of the 18th century. The\r\nhistorians are agreed that, under the two first Georges, during the\r\nministries of Walpole, the Pelhams and Pitt, the prosperity of Britain was\r\ngeneral. Adam Smith speaks of “the peculiarly happy circumstances of the\r\ncountry” during the reign of George II. (1727-60). Hallam characterizes\r\nthe same reign as “the most prosperous that England had ever experienced.”\r\nThe most recent historian of England in the 18th century is of the same\r\nopinion[96]. The novels of Fielding give us the concrete picture of the\r\nperiod with epic fidelity, and the picture is of abundance and\r\nprodigality. Agriculture and commerce with the Colonies, India and the\r\ncontinent of Europe, were the sources of the country’s wealth. Farming and\r\nstock-raising had been greatly improved by the introduction of roots and\r\nsown grasses. In some country parishes the baptisms were three times the\r\nburials. But the public health during this period will not appear in a\r\nfavourable light from what follows. More particularly there were three\r\noccasions, about the years 1718, 1728 and 1741, when a single bad harvest\r\nin the midst of many abundant ones brought wide-spread distress, with\r\nepidemics of typhus and relapsing fever; from which fact it would appear\r\nthat the common people had little in hand. Thorold Rogers, among\r\neconomists, was of the opinion that the prosperity was all on the side of\r\nthe governing and capitalist classes, that the labourers were in\r\n“irremediable poverty” and “without hope,” and that the law of parochial\r\nsettlement, with the artificial fixing of wages by the Quarter Sessions\r\nand the bonuses out of the poor-rates, had the effect of keeping the mass\r\nof the people on the land “in a condition wherein existence could just be\r\nmaintained[97].” I shall not attempt an independent judgment in economics,\r\nbut proceed to those illustrations of national well-being which belong to\r\nmy subject, leaving the latter to have their due weight on the one side of\r\neconomical opinion or on the other. Besides the economical question there\r\nis of course also an ethical one. When the pinch came about 1766, there\r\nwas the usual diversity of opinion expressed on the “condition of England”\r\nproblem, one holding that the labourers were unfairly paid, another that\r\nthe nation had been made “splendid and flourishing by keeping wages low,”\r\nand that the distress was due to “want of industry, want of frugality,\r\nwant of sobriety, want of principle” among the common people at large. “If\r\nin a time of plenty,” wrote one austere moralist, “the labourers would\r\nabate of their drunkenness, sloth, and bad economy, and make a reserve\r\nagainst times of scarcity, they would have no reason to complain of want\r\nor distress at any time[98].” But there must have been something wrong in\r\nthe economics and morals of their betters if it were the case that the\r\nworking class as a whole, and not merely a certain number of individuals\r\nin it, was drunken, thriftless and slothful. The familiar proof of this is\r\nthe apathy of the Church, broken by the Methodist revival of religion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe epidemic fevers of 1718-19.\r\n\r\nIn the fifty years from 1715 to 1765, the three worst periods of epidemic\r\nfever in England and Scotland correspond closely to the three periods of\r\nactual famine and its attendant train of sicknesses in Ireland, namely,\r\nthe years 1718-19, 1727-29, and 1740-42. The three divisions of the\r\nkingdom suffered in common, Ireland suffering most. The first period,\r\n1718-19, was an extremely slack tide in medical writing, insomuch that\r\nhardly any accounts of the reigning maladies remain, except those by\r\nWintringham, of York, and Rogers, of Cork. The whole of the Irish history\r\nof fevers and the allied maladies is dealt with in a chapter apart. Of the\r\nScots history, little is known for the first of the three periods beyond a\r\nstatement that there was a malignant fever and dysentery in Lorn,\r\nArgyllshire, in January and February, 1717[99].\r\n\r\nWintringham gives the following account of the _synochus_, afterwards\r\ncalled typhus, which attracted notice in the summer of 1718 and became\r\nmore common in the warm season of 1719: in each year it began about May,\r\nreached its height in July and lasted all August, carrying off many of\r\nthose who fell into it.\r\n\r\n    It began with rigors, nausea and bilious vomiting, followed by\r\n    alternate heats and chills, with great lassitude and a feeling of\r\n    heaviness: then thirst and pungent heat, a dry and brown tongue,\r\n    sometimes black. The patient slept little, did not sweat, and was\r\n    mostly delirious, or anxious and restless, tossing continually in bed.\r\n    About the 12th day it was not unusual for profuse and exhausting\r\n    diarrhœa to come on. In a favourable case the fever ended in a crisis\r\n    of sweating about the 16th day. Those who were of lax habit,\r\n    unhealthy, hysteric, or cachectic, were apt to have tremors, spasms\r\n    and delirium, while others were so prostrated as to have no control\r\n    over their evacuations, lying in a stupor and raving when roused out\r\n    of it. In these the fever would continue to the 20th day; in some few\r\n    it ended without a manifest crisis, and with a slow\r\n    convalescence[100].\r\n\r\nThis applies to the city of York, but in what special circumstances we are\r\nnot told. However, it happens that a physician of York, two generations\r\nafter, in giving an account of the great improvement that had taken place\r\nin its public health, throws some light on its old-world state: “The\r\nstreets have been widened in many places by taking down a number of old\r\nhouses built in such a manner as almost to meet in the upper stories, by\r\nwhich the sun and air were almost excluded in the streets and inferior\r\napartments[101].”\r\n\r\nIn London the fever-deaths, with the deaths from all causes, rose\r\ndecidedly in 1718, and reached a very high figure in 1719, of which the\r\nsummer was excessively hot. One cause, at least, was want of employment,\r\nespecially among weavers in the East End[102]. But the epidemic fever of\r\n1718-19 was not limited to the distressed classes; we have a glimpse of\r\nit, under the name of “spotted fever,” in the family of the archbishop of\r\nCanterbury:\r\n\r\n“On Friday night the archbishop of Canterbury’s sixth daughter was\r\ninterred in our chancel, with four others preceding, she dying on Monday\r\nafter three days of the spotted fever. The fourth and seventh are\r\nrecovered, and hoped past danger[103].”\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the fever-mortalities for London, from 1718\r\nonwards, and, for comparison, the excessive mortalities in the epidemics\r\nof 1710 and 1714:\r\n\r\n_London Mortalities from Fever, &c._\r\n\r\n  Year    Fevers    Spotted fevers    Smallpox    All causes\r\n\r\n  1710     4397           343           3138        24620\r\n  1714     4631           150           2810        26569\r\n  1718     3475           132           1884        26523\r\n  1719     3803           124           3229        28347\r\n  1720     3910            46           1442        25454\r\n  1721     3331            84           2375        26142\r\n  1722     3088            22           2167        25750\r\n  1723     3321            51           3271        29197\r\n  1724     3262            84           1227        25952\r\n  1725     3277            59           3188        25523\r\n  1726     4666            84           1569        29647\r\n  1727     4728           102           2379        28418\r\n  1728     4716            94           2105        27810\r\n  1729     5235       [The entry        2849        29722\r\n  1730     4011          ends.]         1914        26761\r\n  1731     3225                         2640        25262\r\n  1732     2939                         1197        23358\r\n  1733     3831                         1370        29233\r\n  1734     3116                         2688        26062\r\n  1735     2544                         1594        23538\r\n  1736     3361                         3014        27581\r\n  1737     4580                         2084        27823\r\n  1738     3890                         1590        25825\r\n  1739     3334                         1690        25432\r\n  1740     4003                         2725        30811\r\n\r\nIn country parishes, according to Short’s abstracts of registers, there\r\nwas no unusual sickness in 1718 and 1719.

That the old pestilential fever of London was one of them we need\r\nhave no doubt. Dr John Arbuthnot, writing two or three years after, said,\r\n“I believe one may safely affirm that there is hardly any year in which\r\nthere are not in London fevers with buboes and carbuncles [the distinctive\r\npestilential marks]; and that there are many petechial or spotted fevers\r\nis certain[105].”\r\n\r\nThe essay of Strother also has a reference to “spotted fever” in its\r\ntitle, although the text throws very little light upon it[106]. But, for\r\nthe rest, the “constitution” of 1727-29 is more than usually perplexing.\r\nThere was an influenza at the end of 1729, which can be separated from the\r\nrest easily enough by the help of the London weekly bills of mortality;\r\nand it is probable, unless Arbuthnot, Huxham and Rutty have erred in their\r\ndates, that one or more epidemics of catarrhal fever had occurred before\r\nthat, in the years 1727 and 1728. The greatest difficulty is with a\r\ncertain “little fever,” or “hysteric fever,” or “febricula,” which gave\r\nrise to some writing and a good deal of talk. Strother does not specially\r\ntreat of it, at least under that name, although he says that “many,\r\nespecially women, have been subject to fits of vapours, cold sweats,\r\napprehensions, and unaccountable fears of death; every small\r\ndisappointment dejected them, tremblings and weakness attended them,” etc.\r\n(p. 116); and again, “never was a season when apoplexies, palsies and\r\nother obstructions of the nerves did prevail so much as they do at\r\npresent, and have done for some time past” (p. 102); while he had\r\nfrequently seen hysterical and hypochondriacal symptoms, dejection of\r\nspirits and the like remaining behind the fever (p. 109). For some years\r\nbefore this, much had been heard in London of the vapours, the “hypo,” the\r\nspleen, and the like, an essay by Dr Mandeville, better known by his\r\n‘Fable of the Bees,’ having first made these maladies fashionable in the\r\nyear 1711[107].\r\n\r\nIn due time it began to be noticed that symptoms which many physicians\r\nmade light of as a “fit of vapours” were really the beginning of a fever.\r\nDr Blackmore, in an essay on the Plague written in 1721, admitted the\r\nambiguity:\r\n\r\n    “For several days a malignant fever has so near a resemblance to one\r\n    that is only hysterick, that many physicians and standers by, I am apt\r\n    to believe, mistake the first for the last, and look upon a great and\r\n    dangerous disease to be only the spleen, or a fit of the vapors, to\r\n    the great hazard of the patient[108].”\r\n\r\nIn 1730, Dr William Cockburn, in a polemic against the physicians whom he\r\nstyles “the academical cabal” (because they objected to his secret\r\nelectuary for dysentery), professes to give a history of the mistakes of\r\nthe faculty in London over this “little fever,” or “hysteric fever,” which\r\noften became dangerous[109]:\r\n\r\n    “The present fever, with a variation in some of its symptoms, has now\r\n    subsisted twelve years [or since 1718] not in England only, but all\r\n    over Europe [Manningham says it was peculiarly English]. Few or no\r\n    physicians suspected the reigning and popular disease to be a fever.\r\n    Vapours, a nervous disease, and such general appellations it had from\r\n    sundry physicians. Others, who discovered the fever, knew it was the\r\n    low or slow fever, first mentioned by Hippocrates.... The last were\r\n    represented as ignorant for calling the distemper a fever, and\r\n    affixing to it the name ‘low’ or ‘slow,’ a slow fever being, in their\r\n    adversaries’ opinion, altogether unheard of among physicians and never\r\n    recorded in their books. Nothing was more monstrous than calling this\r\n    distemper a fever, or confining persons afflicted with it to their\r\n    bed, and dieting them with broth, or other liquid food of good\r\n    nourishment, and what is easily concocted.... ‘You are not hot, you\r\n    are not dry; you are in good temper; and therefore you have no fever’\r\n    was the common language of the town.... They might have seen\r\n    physicians practising for a destroying distemper, and yet, after seven\r\n    years, they confess themselves ignorant of its very name.”\r\n\r\nAt length, he continues, Blackmore admitted the ambiguity of diagnosis,\r\nwhile Mead, Freind and others, recognized that there was really such a\r\nthing as a slow, nervous fever, by no means free from danger to life. It\r\nis probably to this insidious fever that Strother refers:\r\n\r\n    “Thus, having gone on for six or seven days in a train of indolence,\r\n    they have been surprized on the seventh day, and have died on the\r\n    eighth lethargick or delirious, whereas, if they had taken due care,\r\n    the fever would have run its course in fifteen days or more.” It was\r\n    the remissions, or intermissions, he explains, that often misled\r\n    patients, by which he seems to mean the clear intervals between\r\n    relapses. “Others, wearied out with relapses, have hoped their\r\n    recovery would as certainly ensue as it had hitherto, and have\r\n    deferred asking advice until it was too late.” These relapses, he\r\n    thought, were brought on by venturing too soon into the air: “it is\r\n    too well known that the fever has been cured, and patients have soon,\r\n    after they have ventured into the air, relapsed and have again run the\r\n    same circle of ill symptoms, if not worse than before.” Bark failed\r\n    conspicuously in these “remittents:” “it is therefore incumbent on me\r\n    to examine into the reason of this _new phenomenon_. I call it _new_,”\r\n    he explains, because bark had hitherto succeeded. “Perhaps we may find\r\n    reason to lay some blame on the air for the frequent relapses....\r\n    Periodical comas have of late been common; so soon as the fit was\r\n    over, the drowsiness abated till the fit returned.”\r\n\r\n    Elsewhere he speaks of the frequent relapses as belonging to a\r\n    “quartan,” under which diagnosis bark had been tried. The fevers were\r\n    less apt to “relapse” when treated by mild cathartics. Another symptom\r\n    of this fever was jaundice: “If jaundice breaks forth on the fourth\r\n    day of a fever, it is much better than if it comes at the conclusion\r\n    of a fever.... Jaundices are now very common after the cure of these\r\n    fevers.”\r\n\r\nThese indications, dispersed throughout the rambling essay of Strother,\r\npoint somewhat plainly to relapsing fever[110]. But his theoretical\r\npathology comes in to obscure the whole matter. He explains everything by\r\nobstructions. The jaundice was due to obstruction of the liver by\r\n“styptics,” the hysteric symptoms to obstructions of the nerves; there\r\nwere also theoretical obstructions of the mesentery, part of the matter\r\nbeing sometimes “thrown off into the mesenteric glands”; also\r\n“congestions” or phlegmons of the liver, spleen and pancreas. But it is\r\nwhen he comes to the bowels that his subjective morbid anatomy becomes\r\ntruly misleading. There is nothing to show that Strother examined a single\r\nbody dead of this fever. He says, however, in his _à priori_ way: “The\r\ncrisis of these slow fevers is generally deposited on the bowels.... The\r\nlent fever is a symptomatical fever, arising from an inflammation, or an\r\nulcer fixed on some of the bowels. A lent fever, depending on some fixed\r\ncause of the bowels, must be cured by having regard to those causes some\r\nof which I shall enumerate”:--the first supposition being that the fever\r\ndepends on phlegmons by congestion of “the liver, spleen, pancreas, or the\r\nmesentery”; the second, if it depends on extravasations in an equally\r\ncomprehensive range of viscera; the third, “if it depends on an ulcer,\r\nthen all vulneraries must be administered internally; but to speak truth,\r\nwhen the viscera are ulcerated, there remains but small hope of life”; the\r\nfourth supposition is worms, the fifth corruption of the humours. All\r\nthis is paper pathology. There is not a single precise fact relating to\r\nulcerated Peyer’s patches, or to swollen mesenteric glands, or to enlarged\r\nspleen, which last would have been equally distinctive of relapsing as of\r\nenteric fever; it is “the viscera” that are ulcerated, or congested, or\r\nextravasated, or it is “some of the bowels,” or the pancreas and liver\r\nobstructed as well as the spleen, the obstruction of the liver being\r\ninvoked to explain the highly significant jaundice.\r\n\r\nIt is not quite clear whether Strother’s fever with relapses and jaundice\r\ncorresponded exactly to the little fever, hysteric fever, or nervous fever\r\nof the same years; but it is worthy of note that relapsing fever in\r\nIreland a century later was called febricula or the “short fever.” It was\r\nnot until 1746 that the excellent essay upon it by Sir Richard Manningham\r\nwas written. By that time a good deal was being said in various parts of\r\nBritain of a slow, nervous, or putrid fever, Huxham, in particular,\r\nidentifying the nervous fever with Manningham’s febricula or little\r\nfever[111]. Some have supposed that the nervous fever of the 18th century\r\nincluded cases of enteric fever, if it did not stand for that disease\r\nexclusively. Murchison takes Manningham’s essay to be “an excellent\r\ndescription of enteric fever, under the title of febricula or little\r\nfever, etc.[112]” The following are brief extracts from his description,\r\nby which the reader will be able to form his own opinion on the question\r\nof identity[113].\r\n\r\n    At the beginning patients feel merely languid or uneasy, with flying\r\n    pains, dryness of the lips and tongue but no thirst; in a day or two\r\n    they find themselves often giddy, dispirited and anxious without\r\n    apparent reason, and passing pale urine. They have transient fits of\r\n    chilliness, a low, quick and unequal pulse, sometimes cold clammy\r\n    sweats and risings in the throat. They go about until more violent\r\n    symptoms come on, simulating those of quotidian, tertian or quartan\r\n    fever; sometimes the malady simulates pleurisy. There may be attacks\r\n    of dyspnoea, nausea and haemorrhage; the menses in women are checked.\r\n    A loss of memory and a delirium occur at intervals for short periods.\r\n    The malady is very difficult to cure and too often becomes fatal in\r\n    the end. It will last thirty or forty days, unless it end fatally in\r\n    stupor or syncope. A form of mania is a consequence of it, where it\r\n    has been neglected or badly treated; “of late years this species of\r\n    madness has been more than ordinarily frequent.” All sorts were liable\r\n    to it, but mostly valetudinarians, delicate persons, and those in the\r\n    decline of life; the fatalities were “especially among the opulent\r\n    families of this great metropolis[114].”\r\n\r\nThis fever-period in London corresponds on the whole closely with a series\r\nof unhealthy years in Short’s tables from the registers of market towns\r\nand country parishes, and with high mortalities in the Norwich register.\r\nIt was not specially a smallpox period, as the last unhealthy year, 1723,\r\nwas. On the other hand the epidemiographists in Yorkshire, Devonshire and\r\nIreland dwell most upon fevers of the nature of typhus, some of which were\r\ndue to famine or dearth, and upon “agues.”\r\n\r\n_Market Towns._\r\n\r\n         Registers  No. with excess  Deaths    Births\r\n  Year   examined      of deaths     in same   in same\r\n\r\n  1727       33           19          3606      2441\r\n  1728       34           23          4972      2355\r\n  1729       36           27          6673      3494\r\n  1730       36           16          3445      2529\r\n\r\n_Norwich._\r\n\r\n  Year        Buried      Baptized\r\n\r\n  1728         1417          774\r\n  1729         1731          843\r\n\r\n_Country Parishes._\r\n\r\n         Registers    With excess   Burials   Baptisms\r\n  Year   examined     of burials    in same   in same\r\n\r\n  1726      181           22           542       495\r\n  1727      180           55          1368      1091\r\n  1728      180           80          2429      1536\r\n  1729      178           62          2015      1442\r\n  1730      176           39          1302      1022\r\n  1731      175           24           700       614\r\n\r\nThe best epidemiologists of the time were not in London, but at York,\r\nRipon, Plymouth, Cork and Dublin. Leaving the Irish history to a separate\r\nchapter, we shall find in the annals of Wintringham, Hillary and Huxham a\r\nsomewhat detailed account of the fevers which caused the very high\r\nmortalities of the years 1727-29, with an occasional glimpse of the\r\ncircumstances in which the fevers arose. Much of what follows relates to\r\nthe same nervous, hysteric or “putrid” fever, with or without relapses,\r\nthat has been described for London. Going back a little, Wintringham\r\nsays[115] that the continued fevers of 1720 were milder than those of the\r\nyear before (which were synochus or typhus) and were often languid or\r\nnervous, with giddiness, stupor and nervous tremblings, a quick pulse, a\r\nwhitish tongue, no thirst, and sweats of the head, neck and chest: this\r\nfever lasted twenty days or more, and ended in a general sweat. He had\r\nmentioned the “languid nervous fevers” first in the years 1716 and 1717,\r\nand he mentions them again as mixed with or following the synochus or\r\ntyphus of 1727-28.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1727, there were fevers prevalent, remitting and intermitting,\r\nbut with uncertain paroxysms; in May, a fever with pleuritic pains; in\r\nJuly, a putrid fever in some, but the chief diseases of that month were\r\n“remittents and intermittents,” which were often attended by cutaneous\r\neruptions, sometimes of dusky colour and dry, at other times full of clear\r\nserum; which, “as they depended upon a scorbutic taint, tormented the sick\r\nwith pruritus.” The sick persons in these remittents were for the most\r\npart drowsy and stupid, especially during the paroxysm; the fevers were\r\nfollowed by lassitude, debility, languor of spirits and hysteric symptoms.\r\n\r\nHillary[116], who practised at Ripon, not far from Wintringham, at York,\r\nrecords in 1726 the prevalence of remittents and intermittents: “some had\r\nexanthematous eruptions towards the latter end of the disease, filled with\r\na clear or yellowish water, which went or dried away without any other\r\ninconvenience to the sick but an uneasy itching for a few days”--just as\r\nWintringham had described a miliary fever for 1727. It is also under 1726\r\nthat he describes the same drowsy and nervous symptoms of Wintringham’s\r\nsummer fever of 1727:\r\n\r\n    “Ancient and weak hysterical people had nervous twitchings and\r\n    catchings, and were comatous and delirious; some were very languid,\r\n    sick and faint, and had tremors; the young and robust, who had more\r\n    full pulses, were generally delirious, unless it was prevented or\r\n    taken off by proper evacuations and cooling medicines. I found\r\n    blistering to be of very great service in this fever, and the sick\r\n    were more relieved by it than ever I observed in any other fever\r\n    whatever. People of lax, weak constitutions were very low and faint,\r\n    and had frequent, profuse, partial sweatings, which most commonly were\r\n    cold and clammy.” Huxham also, at the other end of England, says that\r\n    in October and November, 1727, a slow nervous fever attacked not a\r\n    few; and under the date of January, 1728, he confirms the Yorkshire\r\n    experiences of the prevalence of angina.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that England in 1727 was already suffering in a\r\nmeasure from the distress that was acutely felt in Ireland; it was much\r\naggravated by the hard winter of 1728-29[117], but it had begun before\r\nthat and was doubtless the indirect cause of the great prevalence of\r\nsickness. The exports of corn under the bounty system used to bring two or\r\nthree millions of money into the country in a year. But in 1727 there was\r\na debt balance of 70,757 quarters of wheat imported, and in 1728 the\r\nimport exceeded the export by 21,322 quarters, the price rising at the\r\nsame time from 4_s._ to 8_s._ per bushel[118]. Under the year 1727 Hillary\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    “Many of the labouring and poor people, who used a low diet, and were\r\n    much exposed to the injuries and changes of the weather, died; many of\r\n    whom probably wanted the necessary assistance of diet and medicines.”\r\n    And after referring, under the winter of 1727-28, to the prevalence of\r\n    a fatal suffocative angina, which fell, by a kind of metastasis, on\r\n    the diaphragm or pleura, and sometimes on the peritoneum, he proceeds\r\n    (p. 16):--\r\n\r\n    “Nor did any other method, which art could afford, relieve them:\r\n    insomuch that many of the little country towns and villages were\r\n    almost stripped of their poor people, not only in the country adjacent\r\n    to Ripon, but all over the northern parts of the kingdom: indeed I had\r\n    no certain account of what distempers those who were at a distance\r\n    died of, but suppose they were the same as those which I have\r\n    mentioned, which were nearer to us. Bleeding, pectorals with\r\n    volatiles, and antiphlogistic diluters and blistering, were the most\r\n    successful. I observed that very few of the richer people, who used a\r\n    more generous way of living, and were not exposed to the inclemencies\r\n    of the weather, were seized with any of these diseases at this\r\n    time.... The quartans were very subject to turn into quotidians, and\r\n    sometimes to continual, in which the sick were frequently delirious.”\r\n\r\nThe Yorkshire accounts by Wintringham and Hillary for the second year of\r\nthis epidemic period, the year 1728, are very full, as regards the\r\nsymptoms or types of the fevers; but it would be tedious to cite them at\r\nlength, and unnecessary to do so unless to answer the not inconceivable\r\ncavil that the fevers were not of the nature of typhus in one or other of\r\nits forms. The chief point is that the second year, towards Midsummer,\r\nbrought a fever with the symptoms of _synochus_, and not rarely marked\r\nwith small red spots like fleabites or with purple petechiae. In the\r\nautumn of 1729, Hillary noticed a fever of a slow type, which might go on\r\nas long as thirty days and end without a perfect crisis--the nearest\r\napproach to enteric fever in any of the descriptions. For the same years,\r\n1727-29, Huxham, of Plymouth, describes languid fevers of the “putrid”\r\ntype, with profuse sweating, followed by typhus of a more spotted type.\r\nLike the Yorkshire observer, Huxham mentions also “intermittents” as mixed\r\nwith the continued fevers.\r\n\r\nThe great prevalence of these fevers, “intermittents and other fevers,” in\r\nthe west of England in 1728-29 was known to Dr Rutty of Dublin, who speaks\r\nespecially of “the neighbourhoods of Gloucester and London, and very\r\nmortal in the country places, but less in the cities.” This is confirmed\r\nby Dover:\r\n\r\n    “I happened to live in Gloucestershire in the years 1728 and 1729,\r\n    when a very fatal epidemical fever raged to such a degree as to sweep\r\n    off whole families, nay almost whole villages. I was called to several\r\n    houses where eight or nine persons were down at a time; and yet did\r\n    not so much as lose one patient where I was concerned[119].”\r\n\r\nSome of the cases of nervous or putrid fever in the epidemics of 1727-29\r\nappear to have been marked by relapses in the country districts as well as\r\nin London. Huxham says under date of April, 1728, that those who had\r\nwholly got rid of the putrid fever were exceedingly apt to have relapses.\r\nHillary does not mention relapses until March, 1733, when a fever, with\r\nmany hysterical symptoms, which succeeded the influenza of that year,\r\nrelapsed in several, “though seemingly perfectly recovered before.” But he\r\nseems really to be contrasting relapsing fever and typhus when he points\r\nout that, whereas the inflammatory type of fever in the first year of the\r\nepidemic (1727) was greatly benefited by enormous phlebotomies, the fever\r\npatients in the two seasons following, when the fever was more of the\r\nnature of spotted typhus, could not stand the loss of so much blood, or,\r\nit might be, the loss of any blood[120]. This was precisely the remark\r\nmade by Christison and others a century later, when the inflammatory\r\nsynocha, which often had the relapsing type very marked, changed to the\r\nspotted typhus.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1731 we begin to have annual accounts (soon discontinued) of\r\nthe reigning maladies in Edinburgh, on the same plan as Wintringham’s,\r\nHillary’s and Huxham’s, with which, indeed, they are sometimes collated\r\nand compared[121]. The fevers of Edinburgh and the villages near were as\r\nvarious as those of Plymouth, according to Huxham, and singularly like the\r\nlatter. Thus, in the winter of 1731-32, there was much worm fever,\r\ncomatose fever, or convulsive fever among children, but not limited to\r\nchildren, marked by intense pain in the head, raving in some, stupor in\r\nothers, tremulous movements, leaping of the tendons, and all the other\r\nsymptoms described by Willis for the fever of 1661, a fatal case of\r\nOctober, 1732, in a boy of ten, recorded by St Clair one of the Edinburgh\r\nprofessors, reading exactly like the cases of Willis already given[122].\r\nSt Clair’s case, which was soon fatal, had no worms; but in the general\r\naccounts, both for the winter of 1731-32 and the autumn of 1732, it is\r\nsaid that many of the younger sort passed worms, both _teretes_ and\r\n_ascarides_, and recovered, the fatalities among children being, as usual,\r\nfew. In March and April, 1735, there were again “very irregular fevers of\r\nchildren.” Huxham records exactly the same “worm-fever” of children at\r\nPlymouth in the spring of 1734--a fever with pains in the head, languor,\r\nanxiety, oppression of the breast, vomiting, diarrhoea, and a comatose\r\nstate (_affectus soporosus_), which attacked the young mostly, and was\r\noften attended by the passage of worms. He gives the same account of the\r\nseasons as Gilchrist--the years 1734 and 1735 marked by almost continual\r\nrains, the country more squalid than had been known for some years[123].\r\n\r\nBut it is the nervous fever that chiefly engrosses attention both in\r\nScotland and in England. In 1735, Dr Gilchrist, of Dumfries, made it the\r\nsubject of an essay, returning to the subject a few years after[124]. “As\r\n_our_ fever,” he says, “seems to be peculiar to this age, it is not a\r\nlittle surprising that much more has not been said upon it.” He is not\r\nsure whether its frequency of late years may not be owing to the manner of\r\nliving (it was the time of the great drink-craze, which Huxham also\r\nconnects with the reigning maladies) and to a long course of warm, rainy\r\nseasons; the winters for some years had been warm and open, and the\r\nsummers and harvests rainy. It was only the poorer sort and those a degree\r\nabove them who were subject to this fever; he knew but few instances of it\r\namongst those who lived well, and none amongst wine-drinkers. It was in\r\nsome insidious in its approach; those who seemed to be in no danger the\r\nfirst days for the most part died. In others the onset was violent, with\r\nnausea, heat, thirst and delirium. Among the symptoms were looseness,\r\npains in the belly, local sweating, tickling cough, leaping of the\r\ntendons. Sometimes they were in continual cold clammy sweats; at other\r\ntimes profuse sweats ran from them, as if water were sprinkled upon them,\r\nthe skin feeling death cold.\r\n\r\nAt Edinburgh, from October, 1735, to February, 1736, the fever became very\r\ncommon, and was often a relapsing fever.\r\n\r\n    “The sick had generally a low pulse on the first two or three days,\r\n    with great anxiety and uneasiness, and thin, crude urine. Delirium\r\n    began about the fourth day, and continued until the fever went off on\r\n    the seventh day. Sometimes the disease was lengthened to the\r\n    fourteenth day. The approach of the delirium could always be foretold\r\n    by the urine becoming more limpid, and without sediment.... A large\r\n    plentiful sweat was the crisis in some. Others were exposed to\r\n    relapses, which were very frequent, and rather more dangerous than the\r\n    former fever[125].”\r\n\r\nThese evidences, beginning with Strother’s for London in 1728 and\r\nextending to the Edinburgh record of 1735, must suffice to identify true\r\nrelapsing fever. In the chapter on Irish fevers we shall find clear\r\nevidence of relapsing fever in Dublin in 1739, before the great famine had\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nHuxham’s account of the fevers at Plymouth, in Devonshire generally, and\r\nin Cornwall about the years 1734-36 is of the first importance. It is\r\nhighly complex, owing to the prevalence of an affection of the throat, so\r\nthat one part of the constitution is “anginose fever.” This has been dealt\r\nwith in the chapter on Scarlatina and Diphtheria. Another part was true\r\ntyphus. In his account of the nervous fever we are introduced, as in the\r\nYorkshire annals, 1726-27, to a phenomenon that was almost distinctive of\r\nthe low, nervous or putrid fever from about 1750 to 1760 or longer,\r\nnamely, the eruption of red, or purple, or white watery vesicles, from\r\nwhich it got the name of miliary fever. Huxham’s annals are full of this\r\nphenomenon about the years 1734-36[126]. The red pustules, or white\r\npustules, with attendant ill-smelling sweats, are mentioned over and over\r\nagain. He thought them critical or relieving: “Happy was then the patient\r\nwho broke out in sweats or in red pustules.” These fevers are said to have\r\nextended to the country parts of Devonshire, after they had ceased in\r\nPlymouth, and to Cornwall in August, 1736. In Plymouth itself the type of\r\nfever changed after a time to malignant spotted fever, synochus, or true\r\ntyphus.\r\n\r\nThe malignant epidemic seemed to have been brought in by the fleet; it had\r\nraged for a long time among the sailors of the fleet lying at Portsmouth,\r\nand had destroyed many of them. In March, 1735, it was raging among the\r\nlower classes of Plymouth. About the 10th day of the fever, previously\r\nmarked by various head symptoms, there appeared petechiae, red or purple,\r\nor livid or black, up to the size of vibices or blotches, or the eruption\r\nmight be more minute, like fleabites. A profuse, clammy, stinking sweat,\r\nor a most foetid diarrhoea wasted the miserable patients. A black tongue,\r\nspasms, hiccup, and livid hands presaged death about the 11th to 14th day.\r\nSo extensive and rapid was the putrefaction of the bodies that they had to\r\nbe buried at once or within twenty-four hours. It was fortunate for many\r\nto have had a mild sweat and a red miliary eruption about the 4th or 5th\r\nday; but for others the course of the disease was attended with great\r\nrisk. In April the type became worse, and the disease more general. There\r\nwas rarely now any constriction of the throat. Few pustules broke out; but\r\nin place of them there were dusky or purple and black petechiae, and too\r\noften livid blotches, with which symptoms very many died both in April and\r\nMay. In July this contagious fever had decreased much in Plymouth, and in\r\nSeptember it was only sporadic there. With a mere reference to Hillary’s\r\naccount of somewhat similar fevers at Ripon in 1734-5 (with profuse\r\nsweats, sometimes foetid, great fainting and sinking of spirits, starting\r\nof the limbs and beating of the tendons, hiccup for days, etc.[127]) we\r\nmay pass to a more signal historical event, the great epidemic of fever in\r\n1741-42, of which the Irish part alone has hitherto received sufficient\r\nnotice[128].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe epidemic fever of 1741-42.\r\n\r\nThe harvest of 1739 had been an abundant one, and the export of grain had\r\nbeen large. At Lady-day the price of wheat had been 31_s._ 6_d._ per\r\nquarter, and it rose 10_s._ before Lady-day, 1740. An extremely severe\r\nwinter had intervened, one of the three memorable winters of the 18th\r\ncentury. The autumn-sown wheat was destroyed by the prolonged and intense\r\nfrost, and the price at Michaelmas, 1740, rose to 56_s._ per quarter, the\r\nexportation being at the same time prohibited, but not until every\r\navailable bushel had been sold to the foreigners. The long cold of the\r\nwinter of 1739-40 had produced much distress and want in London, Norwich,\r\nEdinburgh and other towns. In London the mortality for 1740 rose to a very\r\nhigh figure, 30,811, of which 4003 deaths were from fever and 2725 from\r\nsmallpox. In mid-winter, 1739-40, coals rose to £3. 10_s._ per chaldron,\r\nowing to the navigation of the Thames being closed by ice; the streets\r\nwere impassable by snow, there was a “frost-fair” on the Thames, and in\r\nother respects a repetition of the events preceding the London typhus of\r\n1685-86. The _Gentleman’s Magazine_ of January, 1740, tells in verse how\r\nthe poor were “unable to sustain oppressive want and hunger’s urgent\r\npain,” and reproaches the rich,--“colder their hearts than snow, and\r\nharder than the frost”; while in its prose columns it announces that “the\r\nhearts of the rich have been opened in consideration of the hard fate of\r\nthe poor[129].” The long, hard winter was followed by the dry spring and\r\nhot summer of 1740, during which the sickness (in Ireland at least) was of\r\nthe dysenteric type. In the autumn of 1740 the epidemic is said to have\r\ntaken origin both at Plymouth and Bristol from ships arriving with\r\ninfection among the men--at the former port the king’s ships ‘Panther’ and\r\n‘Canterbury,’ at the latter a merchant ship. At Plymouth it was certainly\r\nraging enormously from June to the end of the year--“febris nautica\r\npestilentialis jam saevit maxime,” says Huxham; it continued there all\r\nthrough the first half of 1741, “when it seemed to become lost in a fever\r\nof the bilious kind.” It was in the dry spring and very hot summer of 1741\r\nthat the fever became general over England. Wall says that it appeared at\r\nWorcester at the Spring Assizes among a few; at Exeter also it was traced\r\nto the gaol delivery; and it was commonly said that the turmoil of the\r\nGeneral Election (which resulted in driving Walpole from his long term of\r\npower) helped its diffusion. But undoubtedly the great occasion of its\r\nuniversality was a widely felt scarcity. The rise in the price of wheat\r\nwas small beside the enormous leaps that prices used to take in the\r\nmedieval period, having been at no time double the average low price of\r\nthat generation. It was rather the want of employment that made the pinch\r\nso sharp in 1741. The weaving towns of the west of England were losing\r\ntheir trade; of “most trades,” also, it was said that they were in\r\napparent decay, “except those which supply luxury[130].” Dr Barker, of\r\nSarum, the best medical writer upon the epidemic, says:\r\n\r\n    “The general poverty which has of late prevailed over a great part of\r\n    this nation, and particularly amongst the woollen manufacturers in the\r\n    west, where the fever has raged and still continues to rage with the\r\n    greatest violence, affords but too great reason to believe that this\r\n    has been one principal source of the disease[131].”\r\n\r\nHe explains that the price of wheat had driven the poor to live on bad\r\nbread. This is borne out by a letter from Wolverhampton, 27 November,\r\n1741[132]. The writer speaks of the extraordinary havoc made among the\r\npoorer sort by the terrible fever that has for some time raged in most\r\nparts of England and Ireland. At first it seldom fixed on any but the poor\r\npeople, and especially such as lived in large towns, workhouses, or\r\nprisons. Country people and farmers seemed for the most part exempt from\r\nit, “though we have observed it frequently in villages near market towns”;\r\nwhereas, says the writer, the epidemic fevers of 1727, 1728 and 1729 were\r\nfirst observed to begin among the country people, and to be some time in\r\nadvancing to large towns. This writer’s theory was that the fever was\r\ncaused by bad bread, and he alleges that horse-beans, pease and coarse\r\nunsound barley were almost the only food of the poor. To this a Birmingham\r\nsurgeon took exception[133]. Great numbers of the poor had, to his\r\nknowledge, lived almost entirely upon bean-bread, but had been very little\r\nafflicted with the fever. Besides, every practitioner knew that the fever\r\nwas not confined to the poor. He pointed out that in Wolverhampton, whence\r\nthe bad-bread theory emanated, the proportion of poor to those in easier\r\ncircumstances was as six to one, poverty having increased so much by decay\r\nof trade that many wanted even the necessaries of life. The Birmingham\r\nsurgeon was on the whole inclined to the theory of “the ingenious\r\nSydenham, that the disease may be ascribed to a contagious quality in the\r\nair, arising from some secret and hidden alterations in the bowels of the\r\nearth, passing through the whole atmosphere, or to some malign influence\r\nin the heavenly bodies”--these being Sydenham’s words as applied to the\r\nfever of 1685-6.\r\n\r\nBarker, also, draws a parallel between the epidemic of 1741 and that of\r\n1685-86: the Thames was frozen in each of the two winters preceding the\r\nrespective epidemics, and the spring and summer of 1740 and 1741 were as\r\nremarkable for drought and heat as those of 1684 and 1685.\r\n\r\nIn London the deaths from fever in 1741 reached the enormous figure of\r\n7528, the highest total in the bills of mortality from first to last,\r\nwhile the deaths from all causes were 32,119, in a population of some\r\n700,000, also the highest total from the year of the great plague until\r\nthe new registration of the whole metropolitan area in 1838. It will be\r\nseen from the following table (on p. 81) of the weekly mortalities that\r\nthe fever-deaths rose greatly in the autumn, but, unlike the old plague,\r\nreached a maximum in the winter.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the epidemic of typhus upon the weaving towns of the west\r\nof England, in which the fever lasted, as in London, into the spring of\r\n1742, were seen at their worst in the instance of Tiverton. It was then a\r\ntown of about 8000 inhabitants, having increased little during the last\r\nhundred years. Judged by the burials and baptisms in the parish register\r\nit was a more unhealthy place since the extinction of plague than it had\r\nbeen before that. It was mostly a community of weavers, who had not been\r\nin prosperous circumstances for sometime past. In 1735 the town had been\r\nburned down, and in 1738 it was the scene of riots. The hard winter of\r\n1739-40 brought acute distress, and in 1741 spotted fever was so prevalent\r\nthat 636 persons were buried in that year, being 1 in 12 of the\r\ninhabitants. At the height of the epidemic ten or eleven funerals were\r\nseen at one time in St Peter’s churchyard. Its population twenty years\r\nafter is estimated to have declined by two thousand, and at the end of the\r\n18th century it was a less populous place than at the beginning[134].\r\n\r\n_Mortality by Fever in London, 1741-42._\r\n\r\n        Week              All\r\n      ending     Fever   causes\r\n  1741\r\n      March 10    123     660\r\n            17    103     564\r\n            24    112     624\r\n            31    105     573\r\n       April 7    123     670\r\n            14    128     687\r\n            21     89     580\r\n            28    123     622\r\n         May 5    104     495\r\n            12    141     587\r\n            19    129     573\r\n            26    153     600\r\n        June 2    138     512\r\n             9    138     483\r\n            16    115     536\r\n            23    127     494\r\n            30    154     513\r\n        July 7    149     523\r\n            14    162     551\r\n            21    130     485\r\n            28    151     621\r\n        Aug. 4    128     512\r\n            11    142     541\r\n            18    172     636\r\n            25    192     665\r\n       Sept. 1    171     675\r\n             8    190     691\r\n            15    182     760\r\n            22    199     748\r\n            29    189     733\r\n       Oct.  6    207     784\r\n            13    192     787\r\n            20    232     793\r\n            27    234     850\r\n       Nov.  3    250     835\r\n            10    228     772\r\n            17    182     670\r\n            24    214     806\r\n       Dec.  1    224     768\r\n             8    203     748\r\n            15    191     761\r\n            22    179     775\r\n            29    180     702\r\n  1742\r\n        Jan. 5    221     893\r\n            12    184     760\r\n            19    151     724\r\n        Feb. 2    132     675\r\n             9    103     533\r\n            16    108     675\r\n            25    103     641\r\n\r\n_Effects of the Epidemic of 1741-42 on Provincial Towns.

The record of baptisms in Norwich is almost certainly\r\ndefective; in only two years from 1719 to 1741, is a small excess of\r\nbaptisms over burials recorded, namely, in 1722 and 1726, while in a third\r\nyear, 1736, the figures are exactly equal. In 1740 there are 916 baptisms\r\nto 1173 burials, and in 1741, 851 baptisms to 1456 burials; while in 1742,\r\nowing to an epidemic of smallpox, the deaths rose to 1953, or to more than\r\ndouble the recorded births[135]. The distress was felt most in East Anglia\r\nin 1740. Blomefield, who ends his history in that year, says there was\r\nmuch rioting throughout the kingdom, “on the pretence of the scarcity and\r\ndearness of grain.” At Wisbech Assizes fourteen were found guilty, but\r\nwere not all executed. In Norfolk two were convicted and executed\r\naccordingly. At Norwich the military fired upon the mob and killed seven\r\npersons, of whom only one was truly a rioter[136]. It was also in the\r\nsevere winter of 1739-40 that the distress began in Edinburgh. The mills\r\nwere stopped by ice and snow, causing a scarcity of meal; the harvest of\r\n1740 was bad, riots took place in October, and granaries were\r\nplundered[137]. The deaths from fever were many in 1740, but were nearly\r\ndoubled in 1741, with a significant accompaniment of fatal dysentery[138]:\r\n\r\n_Edinburgh Mortalities, 1740-41._\r\n\r\n(Population in 1732, estimated at 32,000.)[139]\r\n\r\n                 1740    1741\r\n  All causes     1237    1611\r\n                 ----    ----\r\n  Consumption     278     349\r\n  Fever           161     304\r\n  Flux              3      36\r\n  Smallpox        274     206\r\n  Measles         100     112\r\n  Chincough        26     101\r\n  Convulsions      22      16\r\n\r\nThe last four items are of children’s maladies, for which Edinburgh was\r\nworse reputed even than London.\r\n\r\nAt Newcastle the deaths in the register in 1741 were 320 more than in\r\n1740, in which year they were doubtless excessive, as elsewhere. But there\r\nis a significant addition: “There have also been buried upwards of 400\r\nupon the Ballast Hills near this town[140].”\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of the epidemic fever of 1741-42 are described by Barker, of\r\nSalisbury, and Wall, of Worcester[141]. It began like a common cold, as\r\nwas remarked also in Ireland. On the seventh day spots appeared like\r\nfleabites on the breast and arms; in some there were broad purple spots\r\nlike those of scurvy. Miliary eruptions were apt to come out about the\r\neleventh day, especially in women. In most, after the first six or seven\r\ndays, there was a wonderful propensity to diarrhoea, which might end in\r\ndysentery. The cough, which had appeared at the outset, went off about the\r\nninth day, when stupor and delirium came on. Gilchrist, of Dumfries,\r\ndescribes the fever there in November, 1741, as more malignant than the\r\n“nervous fever” which he had described in 1735. It came to an end about\r\nthe fourteenth day; the sick were almost constantly under a coma or\r\nraving, and they died of an absolute oppression of the brain; a profuse\r\nsweat about the seventh day was followed by an aggravation of all the\r\nsymptoms[142]. An anonymous writer, dating from Sherborne, uses the\r\noccasion to make an onslaught upon blood-letting[143].\r\n\r\n\r\nSanitary Condition of London under George II.\r\n\r\nThe great epidemic of fever in 1741-42 was the climax of a series of years\r\nin London all marked by high fever mortalities. If there had not been\r\nsomething peculiarly favourable to contagious fever in the then state of\r\nthe capital, it is not likely that a temporary distress caused by a hard\r\nwinter and a deficient harvest following should have had such effects.\r\nThis was the time when the population is supposed to have stood still or\r\neven declined in London. Drunkenness was so prevalent that the College of\r\nPhysicians on 19 January, 1726, made a representation on it to the House\r\nof Commons through Dr Freind, one of their fellows and member for\r\nLaunceston:\r\n\r\n    “We have with concern observed for some years past the fatal effects\r\n    of the frequent use of several sorts of distilled spirituous liquor\r\n    upon great numbers of both sexes, rendering them diseased, not fit for\r\n    business, poor, a burthen to themselves and neighbours, and too often\r\n    the cause of weak, feeble and distempered children, who must be,\r\n    instead of an advantage and strength, a charge to their country[144].”\r\n\r\n“This state of things,” said the College, “doth every year increase.”\r\nFielding guessed that a hundred thousand in London lived upon drink alone;\r\nsix gallons per head of the population per annum is an estimate for this\r\nperiod, against one gallon at present. The enormous duty of 20_s._ per\r\ngallon served only to develope the trade in smuggled Hollands gin and\r\nNantes brandy. In the harvest of 1733 farmers in several parts of Kent\r\nwere obliged to offer higher wages, although the price of grain was low,\r\nand could hardly get hands on any terms, “which is attributed to the great\r\nnumbers who employ themselves in smuggling along the coast[145].”\r\n\r\nThe mean annual deaths were never higher in London, not even in plague\r\ntimes over a series of years, the fever deaths keeping pace with the\r\nmortality from all causes, and, in the great epidemic of typhus in 1741,\r\nmaking about a fourth part of the whole. The populace lived in a bad\r\natmosphere, physical and moral. As Arbuthnot said in 1733, they “breathed\r\ntheir own steams”; and he works out the following curious sum:\r\n\r\n    “The perspiration of a man is about 1/34 of an inch in 24 hours,\r\n    consequently one inch in 34 days. The surface of the skin of a\r\n    middle-sized man is about 15 square feet; consequently the surface of\r\n    the skin of 2904 such men would cover an acre of ground, and the\r\n    perspir’d matter would cover an acre of ground 1 inch deep in 34 days,\r\n    which, rarefi’d into air, would make over that acre an atmosphere of\r\n    the steams of their bodies near 71 foot high.” This, he explains,\r\n    would turn pestiferous unless carried away by the wind; “from whence\r\n    it may be inferred that the very first consideration in building of\r\n    cities is to make them open, airy, and well perflated[146].”\r\n\r\nIn the growth of London from a medieval walled city of some forty or sixty\r\nthousand inhabitants to the “great wen” of Cobbett’s time, these\r\nconsiderations had been little attended to so far as concerned the\r\nquarters of the populace. The Liberties of the City and the out-parishes\r\nwere covered with aggregates of houses all on the same plan, or rather\r\nwant of plan. In the medieval period the extramural population built rude\r\nshelters against the town walls or in the fosse, if it were dry, or along\r\nthe side of the ditch. The same process of squatting at length extended\r\nfarther afield, with more regular building along the sides of the great\r\nhighways leading from the gates. Queen Elizabeth’s proclamation of 1580\r\nwas designed to check the growth of London after this irregular fashion;\r\nbut as neither the original edict nor the numerous copies of it, reissued\r\nfor near a hundred years, made any provision for an orderly expansion of\r\nthe capital, these prohibitions had merely the effect of adding to the\r\nhugger-mugger of building, “in odd corners and over stables.” The\r\noutparishes were covered with houses and tenements of all kinds, to which\r\naccess was got by an endless maze of narrow passages or alleys; regular\r\nstreets were few in them, and it would appear from the account given by\r\nJohn Stow in 1598 of the parish of Whitechapel that even the old country\r\nhighway, one of the great roads into Essex and the eastern counties, had\r\nbeen “pestered[147].” The “pestering” of the field lanes in the suburban\r\nparishes with poor cottages is Stow’s frequent theme[148]. The borough of\r\nSouthwark, as part of the City, may have been better than most: “Then from\r\nthe Bridge straight towards the south a continual street called Long\r\nSouthwark, built on both sides with divers lanes and alleys up to St\r\nGeorge’s Church, and beyond it through Blackman Street towards New Town or\r\nNewington”--the mazes of courts and alleys on either side of the Borough\r\nRoad which may be traced in the maps long after Stow’s time. So again in\r\nSt Olave’s parish along the river bank eastwards from London\r\nBridge--“continual building on both sides, with lanes and alleys, up to\r\nBattle Bridge, to Horsedown, and towards Rotherhithe.” In the Western\r\nLiberty, the lanes that had been laid out in Henry VIII.’s time, Shoe\r\nLane, Fetter Lane and Chancery Lane, served as three main arteries to the\r\ndensely populated area between Fleet Street and Holborn, but for the rest\r\nit was reached by a plexus or _rete mirabile_ of alleys and courts,\r\nnotorious even in the 19th century. In like manner Drury Lane and St\r\nMartin’s Lane were the main arteries between High Holborn and the Strand.\r\nOne piazza of Covent Garden was a new centre of regular streets, to which\r\nthe haberdashers and other trades were beginning to remove from the City,\r\nfor greater room, about 1662. The Seven Dials were a wonder when they were\r\nnew, about 1694, and had the same intention of openness and regularity as\r\nin Wren’s unused design for the City after the fire. The great speculative\r\nbuilder of the Restoration was Nicholas Barbone, son of Praise-God\r\nBarbones. He built over Red Lion Fields, much to the annoyance of the\r\ngentlemen of Gray’s Inn[149], and his manner of building may be inferred\r\nfrom the following:\r\n\r\n    “He was the inventor of this new method of building by casting of\r\n    ground into streets and small houses, and to augment their number with\r\n    as little front as possible, and selling the ground to workmen by so\r\n    much per foot front, and what he could not sell build himself. This\r\n    has made ground-rents high for the sake of mortgaging; and others,\r\n    following his steps, have refined and improved upon it, and made a\r\n    superfoetation of houses about London[150].”\r\n\r\nIn these mazes of alleys, courts, or “rents” the people were for the most\r\npart closely packed. Overcrowding had been the rule since the Elizabethan\r\nproclamation of 1580, and it seems to have become worse under the Stuarts.\r\nOn February 24, 1623, certain householders of Chancery Lane were indicted\r\nat the Middlesex Sessions for subletting, “to the great danger of\r\ninfectious disease, with plague and other diseases.” In May, 1637, one\r\nhouse was found to contain eleven married couples and fifteen single\r\npersons; another house harboured eighteen lodgers. In the most crowded\r\nparishes the houses had no sufficient curtilage, standing as they did in\r\nalleys and courts. When we begin to have some sanitary information long\r\nafter, it appears that their vaults, or privies, were indoors, at the foot\r\nof the common stair[151]. In 1710, Swift’s lodging in Bury Street, St\r\nJames’s, for which he paid eight shillings a week (“plaguy deep” he\r\nthought), had a “thousand stinks in it,” so that he left it after three\r\nmonths. The House of Commons appears to have been ill reputed for smells,\r\nwhich were specially remembered in connexion with the hot summer of the\r\ngreat fever-year 1685[152].\r\n\r\nThe newer parts of London were built over cesspools, which were probably\r\nmore dangerous than the visible nuisances of the streets satirized by\r\nSwift and Gay. There were also the “intramural” graveyards; of one of\r\nthese, the Green Ground, Portugal Street, it was said by Walker, as late\r\nas 1839; “The effluvia from this ground are so offensive that persons\r\nliving in the back of Clement’s Lane are compelled to keep their windows\r\nclosed.” But that which helped most of all to make a foul atmosphere in\r\nthe houses of the working class, an atmosphere in which the contagion of\r\nfever could thrive, was the window-tax. It is hardly possible that those\r\nwho devised it can have foreseen how detrimental it would be to the public\r\nhealth; it took nearly a century to realize the simple truth that it was\r\nin effect a tax upon light and air.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Window-Tax.\r\n\r\nWillan, writing of fever in London in 1799, mentions that even the\r\npassages of tenement houses were “kept dark in order to lessen the\r\nwindow-tax,” and the air therefore kept foul[153]. Ferriar, writing of\r\nManchester in the last years of the 18th century, mentions, among other\r\nfever-dens, a large house in an airy situation which had been built for a\r\npoor’s-house, but abandoned: having been let to poor families for a very\r\ntrifling rent, many of the windows and the principal entrance were built\r\nup, and the fever then became universal in it[154]. The Carlisle typhus\r\ndescribed by Heysham for 1781 began in a house near one of the gates,\r\ntenanted by five or six very poor families; they had “blocked up every\r\nwindow to lessen the burden of the window-tax[155].” John Howard’s\r\ninterest having been excited in the question of gaol-fever, he noted the\r\neffects of the window-tax not only in prisons but in other houses. The\r\nmagistrates of Kent appear to have paid the tax for the gaols in that\r\ncounty from the county funds; but in most cases the burden fell on the\r\nkeepers of the gaols.\r\n\r\n    “The gaolers,” says Howard, “have to pay it; this tempts them to stop\r\n    the windows and stifle their prisoners;” and he appends the following\r\n    note: “This is also the case in many work-houses and farm-houses,\r\n    where the poor and the labourers are lodged in rooms that have no\r\n    light nor fresh air; which may be a cause of our peasants not having\r\n    the healthy ruddy complexions one used to see so common twenty or\r\n    thirty years ago. The difference has often struck me in my various\r\n    journeys[156].”\r\n\r\nSuch impressions are known to be often fallacious; but in the history of\r\nthe window-tax, which we shall now follow, it will appear that there was a\r\nnew law, with increased stringency, in the years 1746-1748, corresponding\r\nto the “twenty or thirty years ago” of Howard’s recollection.\r\n\r\nThe window-tax was originally a device of the statesmen of the Revolution\r\n“for making good the deficiency of the clipped money.” By the Act of 7 and\r\n8 William and Mary, cap. 18, taking effect from the 25th March, 1696,\r\nevery inhabited house owed duty of two shillings per annum, and, over and\r\nabove such duty on all inhabited houses, every dwelling-house with ten\r\nwindows owed four shillings per annum, and every house with twenty\r\nwindows eight shillings. In 1710 houses with from twenty to thirty windows\r\nwere made to pay ten shillings, and those with more than thirty windows\r\ntwenty shillings. Various devices were resorted to to check the evasions\r\nof bachelors, widows and others. A farmer had to pay for his servants,\r\nrecouping himself from their wages. A house subdivided into tenements was\r\nto count as one; which would have made the tax difficult to gather except\r\nfrom the landlord. The machinery of collection was a board of\r\ncommissioners, receivers-general and collectors.\r\n\r\nBut in the 20th of George II. (1746) the basis of the law was changed. The\r\ntax was levied upon the several windows of a house, so much per window, so\r\nthat it fell more decisively than before upon the tenants of\r\ntenement-houses, and not on the landlords. The two-shillings house duty\r\nwas continued; but the window-tax became sixpence per annum for every\r\nwindow of a house with ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen or fourteen windows,\r\nor lights, ninepence for every window of a house with fifteen, sixteen,\r\nseventeen, eighteen or nineteen windows, and one shilling for every window\r\nof a house with twenty or more windows. An exemption in the Act in favour\r\nof those receiving parochial relief was decided by the law officers of the\r\nCrown not to apply to houses with ten or more windows or lights, which\r\nwould have included most tenement-houses; on the other hand they ruled\r\nthat hospitals, poor-houses, workhouses, and infirmaries were not\r\nchargeable with the window duty. To remove doubts and check evasions\r\nanother Act was made in 21 George II. cap. 10. All skylights, and lights\r\nof staircases, garrets, cellars and passages were to count for the purpose\r\nof the tax; also certain outhouses, but not others, were to count as part\r\nof the main dwelling whether they were contiguous or not. The 11th\r\nparagraph of the Amendment Act shows how the law had been working in the\r\ncourse of its first year: “No window or light shall be deemed to be\r\nstopped up unless such window or light shall be stopped up effectually\r\nwith stone or brick or plaister upon lath,” etc.\r\n\r\nThis remained the law down to 1803, when a change was made back to the\r\noriginal basis of rating houses as a whole, according to the number of\r\ntheir windows, the rate being considerably raised and fixed according to a\r\nschedule. The tax for tenement houses was at the same time made\r\nrecoverable from the landlord. The window-tax thus became a form of the\r\nmodern house-tax, rated upon windows instead of upon rental, and so lost a\r\ngreat part of its obnoxious character.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1747-48, which taxed each window separately, and was enforced\r\nby a galling and corrupt machinery of commissioners, receivers-general and\r\ncollectors paid by results, could not fail to work injuriously; for light\r\nand air, two of the primary necessaries of life, were in effect taxed.\r\nEven rich men appear to have taken pleasure in circumventing the\r\ncollectors[157]. But it was among the poor, and especially the inhabitants\r\nof tenement houses, that the effect was truly disastrous; a tax on the\r\nskylights of garrets and on the lights of cellars, staircases and\r\npassages, taught the people to dispense with them altogether. Towards the\r\nend of the 18th century the grievance became now and then the subject of a\r\npamphlet or a sermon.\r\n\r\n\r\nGaol-Fever.\r\n\r\nBesides these ordinary things favouring contagious epidemic fever both in\r\ntown and country, there were two special sources of contagion, the gaols\r\nand the fleets and armies. I shall take first the state of the gaols,\r\nwhich has been already indicated in speaking of the window-tax. In the\r\nopinion of Lind, a great part of the fever, which was a constant trouble\r\nin ships of the navy, came direct from the gaols through the pressing of\r\nnewly discharged convicts.\r\n\r\nThe state of the prisons in the first half of the 18th century was\r\ncertainly not better than Howard found it to be a generation after; it was\r\nprobably worse, for the administration of justice was more savage. About\r\nthe beginning of the century, many petitions were made to Parliament by\r\nimprisoned debtors, complaining of their treatment, and a Bill was\r\nintroduced in 1702. Sixty thousand were said to be in prison for\r\ndebt[158]. On 25 February, 1729, the House of Commons appointed a\r\ncommittee “to inquire into the state of the gaols of this Kingdom”; but\r\nonly two prisons were reported on, the Fleet and the Marshalsea, in\r\nLondon, the inquiries upon these being due to the energy of Oglethorpe,\r\nthen at the beginning of his useful career. The committee found a\r\ndisgraceful state of things:--wardens, tip-staffs and turnkeys making\r\ntheir offices so lucrative by extortion that the reversion of them was\r\nworth large sums, prisoners abused or neglected if they could not pay,\r\nsome prisoners kept for years after their term was expired, the penniless\r\ncrowded three in a bed, or forty in one small room, while some rooms stood\r\nempty to await the arrival of a prisoner with a well-filled purse. On the\r\ncommon side of the Fleet Prison, ninety-three prisoners were confined in\r\nthree wards, having to find their own bedding, or pay a shilling a week,\r\nor else sleep on the floor. The “Lyons Den” and women’s ward, which\r\ncontained about eighteen, were very noisome and in very ill repair. Those\r\nwho were well had to lie on the floor beside the sick. A Portuguese debtor\r\nhad been kept two months in a damp stinking dungeon over the common sewer\r\nand adjoining to the sink and dunghill; he was taken elsewhere on payment\r\nof five guineas. In the Marshalsea there were 330 prisoners on the common\r\nside, crowded in small rooms. George’s ward, sixteen feet by fourteen and\r\nabout eight feet high, had never less than thirty-two in it “all last\r\nyear,” and sometimes forty; there was no room for them all to lie down,\r\nabout one-half of the number sleeping over the others in hammocks; they\r\nwere locked in from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. in summer (longer hours in winter),\r\nand as they were forced to ease nature within the room, the stench was\r\nnoisome beyond expression, and it seemed surprising that it had not caused\r\na contagion; several in the heat of summer perished for want of air.\r\nMeanwhile the room above was let to a tailor to work in, and no one\r\nallowed to lie in it. Unless the prisoners were relieved by their friends,\r\nthey perished by famine. There was an allowance of pease from a casual\r\ndonor who concealed his name, and 30 lbs. of beef three times a week from\r\nanother charitable source. The starving person falls into a kind of\r\nhectic, lingers for a month or two and then dies, the right of his corpse\r\nto a coroner’s inquest being often scandalously refused[159]. The prison\r\nscenes in Fielding’s _Amelia_ are obviously faithful and correct.\r\n\r\nOglethorpe’s committee had done some good since they first met at the\r\nMarshalsea on 25th March, 1729, not above nine having died from that date\r\nto the 14th May; whereas before that a day seldom passed without a death,\r\n“and upon the advancing of the spring not less than eight or ten usually\r\ndied every twenty-four hours.” Two of the chief personages concerned were\r\nfound by a unanimous vote of the House of Commons to have committed high\r\ncrimes and misdemeanours; but when they were tried before a jury on a\r\ncharge of felony they were found not guilty.\r\n\r\nAbout a year after these reports to the Commons there was a tragic\r\noccurrence among the Judges and the Bar of the Western Circuit during the\r\nLent Assizes of 1730. The Bridewell at Taunton was filled for the occasion\r\nof the Assizes with drafts of prisoners from other gaols in Somerset,\r\namong whom several from Ilchester were said to have been more than\r\nordinarily noisome. Over a hundred prisoners were tried, of whom eight\r\nwere sentenced to death (six executed), and seventeen to transportation.\r\nAs the Assize Court continued its circuit through Devon and Dorset several\r\nof its members sickened of the gaol fever and died: Piggot, the\r\nhigh-sheriff, on the 11th April, Sir James Sheppard, serjeant-at-law, on\r\n13th April at Honiton, the crier of the court and two of the Judge’s\r\nservants at Exeter, the Judge himself, chief baron Pengelly, at Blandford,\r\nand serjeant-at-law Rous, on his return to London, whither he had posted\r\nfrom Exeter as soon as he felt ill[160]. It is said that the infection\r\nafterwards spread within the town of Taunton, where it arose, “and carried\r\noff some hundreds”; but the local histories make no mention of such an\r\nepidemic in 1730, and no authority is cited for it[161]. Something of the\r\nsame kind is believed to have happened at a gaol delivery at Launceston\r\nin 1742, but the circumstances are vaguely related, and it does not appear\r\nthat any prominent personage in the Assize Court died on the\r\noccasion[162].\r\n\r\nThe great instance of a Black Assize in the 18th century, comparable to\r\nthose of Cambridge, Oxford and Exeter in the 16th[163], was that of the\r\nOld Bailey Sessions in London in April, 1750. It has been fully related by\r\nSir Michael Foster, one of the justices of the King’s Bench, who had\r\nhimself been on the bench at the January sessions preceding, and was the\r\nintimate friend of Sir Thomas Abney, the presiding judge who lost his life\r\nfrom the contagion of the April sessions[164].\r\n\r\n    “At the Old Bailey sessions in April, 1750, one Mr Clarke was brought\r\n    to his trial; and it being a case of great expectation, the court and\r\n    all the passages to it were extremely crowded; the weather too was\r\n    hotter than is usual at that time of the year[165]. Many people who\r\n    were in court at this time were sensibly affected with a very noisome\r\n    smell; and it appeared soon afterwards, upon an enquiry ordered by the\r\n    court of aldermen, that the whole prison of Newgate and all the\r\n    passages leading thence into the court were in a very filthy\r\n    condition, and had long been so. What made these circumstances to be\r\n    at all attended to was, that within a week or ten days at most, after\r\n    the session, many people who were present at Mr Clarke’s trial were\r\n    seized with a fever of the malignant kind; and few who were seized\r\n    recovered. The symptoms were much alike in all the patients, and in\r\n    less than six weeks time the distemper entirely ceased. It was\r\n    remarked by some, and I mention it because the same remark hath\r\n    formerly been made on a like occasion [Oxford, 1577], that women were\r\n    very little affected: I did not hear of more than one woman who took\r\n    the fever in court, though doubtless many women were there.\r\n\r\n    “It ought to be remembered that at the time this disaster happened\r\n    there was no sickness in the gaol more than is common in such places.\r\n    This circumstance, which distinguisheth this from most of the cases of\r\n    the like kind which we have heard of, suggesteth a very proper\r\n    caution: not to presume too far upon the health of the gaol, barely\r\n    because the gaol-fever is not among the prisoners. For without doubt,\r\n    if the points of cleanliness and free air have been greatly neglected,\r\n    the putrid effluvia which the prisoners bring with them in their\r\n    clothes etc., especially where too many are brought into a crowded\r\n    court together, may have fatal effects on people who are accustomed to\r\n    breathe better air; though the poor wretches, who are in some measure\r\n    habituated to the fumes of a prison, may not always be sensible of any\r\n    great inconvenience from them.\r\n\r\n    “The persons of chief note who were in court at this time and died of\r\n    the fever were Sir Samuel Pennant, lord mayor for that year, Sir\r\n    Thomas Abney, one of the justices of the Common Pleas, Charles Clarke,\r\n    esquire, one of the barons of the exchequer, and Sir Daniel Lambert,\r\n    one of the aldermen of London. Of less note, a gentleman of the bar,\r\n    two or three students, one of the under-sheriffs, an officer of Lord\r\n    Chief Justice Lee, who attended his lordship in court at that time,\r\n    several of the jury on the Middlesex side, and about forty other\r\n    persons whom business or curiosity had brought thither.”\r\n\r\nThe same thing was remarked here as at Exeter in 1586 that those who sat\r\non the side of the Court nearest to the dock were most attacked by the\r\ninfection[166]. When the cases of fever began to occur, after the usual\r\nincubation of “a week or ten days,” there was much fear of the infection\r\nspreading, so that many families, it is said, retired into the\r\ncountry[167]. But Pringle wrote on 24 May, “However fatal it has been\r\nsince the Sessions, it is highly probable that the calamity will be in a\r\ngreat measure confined to those who were present at the tryal[168];” and\r\nJustice Foster gives no hint of anyone having taken the fever who was not\r\npresent in court.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of gaol-fever at the Old Bailey in 1750 secured increased\r\nattention to the subject of scientific ventilation. The great bar to fresh\r\nair indoors throughout the 18th century was the window-tax. It bore\r\nparticularly hard on prisoners, for the gaolers had to pay the window-tax\r\nout of their profits, and they naturally preferred to build up the\r\nwindows. Scientific ventilation of gaols was something of a mockery in\r\nthese circumstances; but it is the business of science to find out cunning\r\ncontrivances, and ingenious ventilators were devised for Newgate, the\r\nleading spirit in this work being the Rev. Dr Hales, rector of a parish\r\nnear London, and an amateur in physiology at the meetings of the Royal\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nA ventilating apparatus had been erected at Newgate about a year before\r\nthe fatal sessions of 1650, but it does not seem to have answered. It\r\nconsisted of tubes from the various wards meeting in a great trunk which\r\nopened on the roof. A committee of the Court of Aldermen in October 1750\r\nresolved, after consulting Pringle and Hales, to add a windmill on the\r\nleads over the vent, and that was done about two years after. Pringle, who\r\ninspected the ventilator on 11 July, 1752, says that a considerable\r\nstream of air of a most offensive smell issued from the vent; and it\r\nappeared that no fewer than seven of the eleven carpenters who were\r\nworking at the alterations on the old ventilator caught gaol-fever (of the\r\npetechial kind), which spread among the families of some of them[169].\r\nPringle and Hales were of opinion that the wards furnished with tubes were\r\nless foul than the others; and they claimed, on the evidence of the man\r\nwho took care of the apparatus, that only one person had died in the gaol\r\nin two months, whereas, before the windmill was used, there died six or\r\nseven in a week[170]. But Oglethorpe had claimed an improvement of the\r\nsame kind at the Marshalsea in 1729 merely from having the prisoners saved\r\nfrom hunger; and Lind, who was a most matter-of-fact person, did not think\r\nthat the ingenious contrivances for ventilation had answered their\r\nend[171].\r\n\r\nHoward’s visitations of the prisons, which began in 1773 and were\r\ncontinued or repeated during several years following, brought to light\r\nmany instances of epidemic sickness therein, which was nearly always of\r\nthe nature of gaol-typhus. The following is a list compiled from his\r\nvarious reports, the two or three instances of smallpox infection being\r\ngiven elsewhere.\r\n\r\n    _Wood Street Compter, London._ About 100 in it, chiefly debtors.\r\n    Eleven died in beginning of 1773; since then it has been visited by Dr\r\n    Lettsom at the request of the aldermen.\r\n\r\n    _Savoy, London._ On 15 March, 1776, 119 prisoners. Many sick and\r\n    dying. Between that date and next visit, 25 May, 1776, the gaol-fever\r\n    has been caught by many.\r\n\r\n    _Hertford._ Inmates range from 20 to 30. In the interval of two\r\n    visits, the gaol-fever prevailed and carried off seven or eight\r\n    prisoners and two turnkeys. (The interval probably corresponded to the\r\n    admission of an unusual number of debtors.)\r\n\r\n    _Chelmsford._ Number of inmates varies from 20 to 60, about one-half\r\n    debtors. A close prison frequently infected with the gaol-distemper.\r\n\r\n    _Dartford, County Bridewell._ A small prison. About two years before\r\n    visit of 1774 there was a bad fever, which affected the keeper and his\r\n    family and every fresh prisoner. Two died of it.\r\n\r\n    _Horsham, Bridewell._ The keeper a widow: her husband dead of the\r\n    gaol-fever.\r\n\r\n    _Petworth, Bridewell._ Allowance per diem a penny loaf (7½ oz.). Th.\r\n    Draper and Wm. Godfrey committed 6 Jan., 1776: the former died on 11\r\n    Jan., the other on 16th. Wm. Cox, committed 13 Jan., died 23rd. “None\r\n    of these had the gaol-fever. I do not affirm that these men were\r\n    famished to death; it was extreme cold weather.” After this the\r\n    allowance of bread was doubled, thanks to the Duke of Richmond.\r\n\r\n    _Southwark, the new gaol._ Holds up to 90 debtors and felons. “In so\r\n    close a prison I did not wonder to see, in March, 1776, several felons\r\n    sick on the floors.” No bedding, nor straw. The Act for preserving the\r\n    health of prisoners is on a painted board.\r\n\r\n    _Aylesbury._ About 20 prisoners. First visit Nov., 1773, second Nov.,\r\n    1774: in the interval six or seven died of the gaol-distemper.\r\n\r\n    _Bedford._ About twenty years ago the gaol-fever was in this prison;\r\n    some died there, and many in the town, among whom was Mr Daniel, the\r\n    surgeon who attended the prisoners. The new surgeon changed the\r\n    medicines from sudorifics to bark and cordials; and a sail-ventilator\r\n    being put up the gaol has been free from the fever almost ever since.\r\n    (This was the gaol which is often said to have started Howard on his\r\n    inquiries when he was High Sheriff.)\r\n\r\n    _Warwick._ Holds up to fifty-seven. The late gaoler died in 1772 of\r\n    the gaol-distemper, and so did some of his prisoners. No water then;\r\n    plenty now.\r\n\r\n    _Southwell, Bridewell._ A small prison. A few years ago seven died\r\n    here of the gaol-fever within two years.\r\n\r\n    _Worcester._ Has a ventilator. Mr Hallward the surgeon caught the\r\n    gaol-fever some years ago, and has ever since been fearful of going\r\n    into the dungeon; when any felon is sick, he orders him to be brought\r\n    out.\r\n\r\n    _Shrewsbury._ Gaol-fever has prevailed here more than once of late\r\n    years.\r\n\r\n    _Monmouth._ At first visit in 1774, they had the gaol-fever, of which\r\n    died the gaoler, several of his prisoners, and some of their friends.\r\n\r\n    _Usk (Monmouth) Bridewell._ The keeper’s wife said that many years ago\r\n    the prison was crowded, and that herself, her father who was then\r\n    keeper, and many others of the family had the gaol-fever, three of\r\n    whom, and several of the prisoners, died of it.\r\n\r\n    _Gloucester, the Castle._ Many prisoners died here in 1773; and always\r\n    except at Howard’s last visit, he saw some sick in this gaol. A large\r\n    dunghill near the stone steps. The prisoners miserable objects: Mr\r\n    Raikes and others took pity on them.\r\n\r\n    _Winchester._ The former destructive dungeon was down eleven steps,\r\n    and darker than the present. Mr Lipscomb said that more than twenty\r\n    prisoners had died in it of the gaol-fever in one year, and that the\r\n    surgeon before him had died of it.\r\n\r\n    _Liverpool._ Holds about sixty, offensive, crowded. Howard in March,\r\n    1774, told the keeper his prisoners were in danger of the gaol-fever.\r\n    Between that date and Nov., 1775, twenty-eight had been ill of it at\r\n    one time.\r\n\r\n    _Chester, the Castle._ Dungeon used to imprison military deserters.\r\n    Two of them brought by a sergeant and two men to Worcester, of which\r\n    party three died a few days after they came to their quarters. (For\r\n    fever in this prison in 1716 see the text, p. 60.)\r\n\r\n    _Cowbridge._ The keeper said, on 19 August, 1774, that many had died\r\n    of the gaol-fever, among them a man and a woman a year before, at\r\n    which time himself and daughter were ill of it.\r\n\r\n    _Cambridge, the Town Bridewell._ In the spring of 1779, seventeen\r\n    women were confined in the daytime, and some of them at night, in the\r\n    workroom, which has no fireplace or sewer. This made it extremely\r\n    offensive, and occasioned a fever or sickness among them, which so\r\n    alarmed the Vice-Chancellor that he ordered all of them to be\r\n    discharged. Two or three of them died within a few days.\r\n\r\n    _Exeter, the County Bridewell._ Between first visit in 1775 and next\r\n    on 5 Feb., 1779, the surgeon and two or three prisoners have died of\r\n    the gaol-fever. In 1755 a prisoner discharged from the gaol went home\r\n    to Axminster, and infected his family, of whom two died, and many\r\n    others in that town afterwards.\r\n\r\n    _Exeter, the High Gaol for felons._ Mr Bull, the surgeon, stated that\r\n    he was by contract excused from attending in the dungeons any\r\n    prisoners that should have the gaol-fever.\r\n\r\n    _Winchester, Bridewell._ Close and small. Receives many prisoners from\r\n    other gaols at Quarter Sessions. It has been fatal to vast numbers.\r\n    The misery of the prisoners induced the Duke of Chandos to send them\r\n    for some years 30 lbs. of beef and 2 gallon loaves a week.\r\n\r\n    _Devizes, Bridewell._ Two or three years ago the gaol-fever carried\r\n    off many. An infirmary added since then.\r\n\r\n    _Marlborough._ The rooms offensive. Saw one dying on the floor of the\r\n    gaol-fever. One had died just before, and another soon after his\r\n    discharge.\r\n\r\n    _Launceston._ Small, with offensive dungeons. No windows, chimneys, or\r\n    drains. No water. Damp earthen floor. Those who serve there often\r\n    catch the gaol-fever. At first visit, found the keeper, his assistant\r\n    and all the prisoners but one sick of it (on 19 Feb., 1774, eleven\r\n    felons in it). Heard that, a few years before, many prisoners had died\r\n    of it, and the keeper and his wife in one night. A woman confined\r\n    three years by the Ecclesiastical Court had three children born in the\r\n    gaol.\r\n\r\n    _Bodmin, Bridewell._ Much out of repair. The night rooms are two\r\n    garrets with small close-glazed skylight 17 in. × 12 in. A few years\r\n    ago the gaol-fever was very fatal, not only in the prison but also in\r\n    the town.\r\n\r\n    _Taunton, Bridewell._ Six years ago, when there was no infirmary\r\n    provided, the gaol-fever spread over the whole prison, so that eight\r\n    died out of nineteen prisoners.\r\n\r\n    _Shepton Mallet._ Men’s night room close, with small window. So\r\n    unhealthy some years ago that the keeper buried three or four in a\r\n    week.\r\n\r\n    _Thirsk._ Prisoners had the gaol-fever not long ago.\r\n\r\n    _Carlisle._ During the gaol-fever which some years ago carried off\r\n    many of the prisoners, Mr Farish, the chaplain, visited the sick every\r\n    day.\r\n\r\nI shall add some medical experiences of gaol-fever in London from the\r\nnotes of Lettsom[172]:--\r\n\r\n    May, 1773. A person released from Newgate “in a malignant or\r\n    jail-fever” was brought into a house in a court off Long Lane,\r\n    Aldersgate Street; soon after which fourteen persons in the same\r\n    confined court were attacked with a similar fever: one died before\r\n    Lettsom was called in, one was sent to hospital, eleven attended by\r\n    him all recovered, though with difficulty. Two deaths in Wood Street\r\n    Compter: 1. Rowell, an industrious, sober workman, who had supported\r\n    for many years a wife and three children; some of these having been\r\n    lately sick, he fell behind with his rent, a little over three\r\n    guineas; he offered all he had (more than enough) to the landlord, but\r\n    the latter preferred to throw the man and his family into the Compter,\r\n    where Rowell died of fever. 2. Russell, once a reputable tradesman on\r\n    Ludgate Hill, fell into a debt of under three guineas, sent to the\r\n    Compter with his wife and five children, took fever and died; attended\r\n    in his sickness in a bare room by his eldest daughter, elegant and\r\n    refined, aged seventeen; his son, aged fourteen, took the fever and\r\n    recovered.\r\n\r\nThere was one Black Assize at this period, at Dublin in April 1776. A\r\ncriminal, brought into the Court of Sessions without cleansing, infected\r\nthe court and alarmed the whole city. Among others who died of the\r\ncontagion were Fielding Ould, High Sheriff, the counsellors Derby, Palmer,\r\nSpring and Ridge, Mr Caldwell, Messrs Bolton and Eriven, and several\r\nattorneys and others whose business it was to attend the court[173].\r\n\r\nThere were two notorious outbreaks of malignant fever among foreign\r\nprisoners of war, one in 1761[174] and another in 1780[175], the first\r\namong French and Spaniards at Winchester and Portchester, the second among\r\nSpaniards at Winchester.\r\n\r\nHoward found so little typhus in the gaols in his later visits that it\r\nseemed as if banished for good. But it was heard of frequently about\r\n1780-85--at Maidstone, at Aylesbury, at Worcester, costing the lives of\r\nsome of the visiting physicians.\r\n\r\n\r\nCircumstances of severe and mild Typhus.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the gaol distemper bring out one grand character of\r\ntyphus which will have to be stated formally before we go farther.\r\nOrdinary domestic typhus was not a very fatal disease. Haygarth says that\r\nof 285 attacked by it in the poorer quarters of Chester in the autumn of\r\n1774, only twenty-eight died. Ferriar, in Manchester, had sometimes an\r\neven more favourable experience than that: “The mortality of the epidemic\r\nwas not great, ... out of the first ninety patients whom I attended, only\r\ntwo died.” This was before the House of Recovery was opened; so that the\r\nlow mortality was of typhus in the homes of the people.\r\n\r\nThe fever was often an insidious languishing, without great heat, and\r\nmarked most by tossing and wakefulness, which might pass into delirium;\r\nwhen it went through the members of a family or the inmates of a house,\r\nthere would be some cases concerning which it was hard to say whether they\r\nwere cases of typhus or not. Misery and starvation brought it on, and\r\noften it was itself but a degree of misery and starvation. “I have found,”\r\nsays Ferriar, “that for three or four days before the appearance of\r\ntyphus in a family consisting of several children, they had subsisted on\r\nlittle more than cold water.” “It has been observed,” says Langrish, “that\r\nthose who have died of hunger and thirst, as at sieges and at sea, etc.,\r\nhave always died delirious and feverish.” The fever was on the whole a\r\ndistinct episode, but in many cases it had no marked crisis. “Those women\r\nwho recovered,” says Ferriar, “were commonly affected with hysterical\r\nsymptoms after the fever disappeared;” and again: “Fevers often terminate\r\nin hysterical disorders, especially in women; men, too, are sometimes\r\nhysterically inclined upon recovering from typhus, for they experience a\r\ncapricious disposition to laugh or cry, and a degree of the globus\r\nhystericus.” These were probably the more case-hardened people, inured to\r\ntheir circumstances, their healthy appetite dulled by the practice of\r\nfasting or “clemming,” or by opium, and their blood accustomed to be\r\nrenovated by foul air. If the limit of subsistence be approached\r\ngradually, life may be sustained thereat without any sharp crisis of\r\nfever, or with only such an interlude of fever as differs but little from\r\na habit of body unnamed in the nosology.\r\n\r\nThe worst kind of typhus, often attended with delirium, crying and raving,\r\nintolerable pains in the head, and livid spots on the skin, ending fatally\r\nperhaps in two or three days, or after a longer respite of stupor or\r\nwaking insensibility, was commonly the typhus of those not accustomed to\r\nthe minimum of well-being--the typhus of hardy felons newly thrown into\r\ngaol, of soldiers in a campaign crowded into a hospital after a season in\r\nthe open air, of sailors on board ship mixing with newly pressed men\r\nhaving the prison atmosphere clinging to them, of judges, counsel,\r\nofficials of the court and gentlemen of the grand jury brought into the\r\nsame atmosphere with prisoners at a gaol-delivery, of the wife and\r\nchildren of a discharged prisoner returned to his home, of the\r\ngaol-keeper, gaol-chaplain, or gaol-doctor, of the religious and\r\ncharitable who visited in poor localities even where no fever was known to\r\nbe, and most of all of country people who crowded to the towns in search\r\nof work or of higher wages or of a more exciting life.\r\n\r\nIt was in these circumstances that the most fatal infections of typhus\r\ntook place. Such extraordinary malignancy of typhus happened often when\r\nthe type of sickness (if indeed there was definite disease at all) among\r\nthe originally ailing failed to account for it; it was the great\r\ndisparity of condition that accounted for it. There were, however, more\r\nspecial occasions when a higher degree of malignancy than ordinary was\r\nbred or cultivated among the classes at large who were habitually liable\r\nto typhus. But even the old pestilential spotted fever which used to\r\nprecede, accompany, and follow the plague itself, was fatal to a\r\ncomparatively small proportion of all who had it. Thus, towards the end of\r\nthe great London plague of 1625, on 18th October, Sir John Coke writes to\r\nLord Brooke: “In London now the tenth person dieth not of those that are\r\nsick, and generally the plague seems changed into an ague[176].” One in\r\nten is probably too small a fatality for the old pestilential fever; but\r\nthat is the usually accepted proportion of deaths to attacks in the typhus\r\nfever of later times. The rate of fatality is got, naturally, by striking\r\nan average. But in truth an aggregate of typhus cases, however homogeneous\r\nin conventional symptoms or type-characters, was not always really\r\nhomogeneous. We have seen that ninety cases of typhus could occur in the\r\nslums of Manchester with only two deaths. On the other hand there were\r\noutbreaks of gaol-fever in which half or more of all that were attacked\r\ndied; and I suspect that the average fatality in typhus of one in ten was\r\noften brought up by an admixture of cases of healthy and well-conditioned\r\npeople who caught a much more malignant type of fever from their contact\r\nwith those inured to misery. To strike an average is in many instances a\r\nconvenience and a help to the apprehension of a truth; but for the average\r\nto be instructive, the members of the aggregate must be more or less\r\ncomparable in their circumstances. It has been truly said that there is no\r\ncommon measure between Lazarus and Dives as regards their subjective views\r\nof things; it is not a little strange to find that they are just as\r\nincommensurable in their risk of dying from the infection of typhus fever.\r\nThe rule seems to be that the degree of acuteness or violence of an attack\r\nof typhus was inversely as the habitual poor condition of the victim. In\r\nadducing evidence of the tragic nature of typhus infection conveyed across\r\nthe gulf of misery to the other side, I shall endeavour to keep strictly\r\nto the scientific facts, leaving the moral, if there be a moral (and it is\r\nnot always obvious), to point itself.\r\n\r\nLet us take first the common case of country-bred people migrating to the\r\ntowns. Any lodging in a crowded centre of industry and trade would be\r\nhigh-rented compared with the country cottage which they had left, and\r\nthey would naturally gravitate to the slums of the city.\r\n\r\n    “Great numbers of the labouring poor,” says Ferriar of Manchester,\r\n    “who are tempted by the prospect of large wages to flock into the\r\n    principal manufacturing towns, become diseased by getting into dirty\r\n    infected houses on their arrival. Others waste their small stock of\r\n    money without procuring employment, and sink under the pressure of\r\n    want and despair.... The number of such victims sacrificed to the\r\n    present abuses is incredible.” And again:\r\n\r\n    “It must be observed that persons newly arrived from the country are\r\n    most liable to suffer from these causes, and as they are often taken\r\n    ill within a few days after entering an infected house, there arises a\r\n    double injury to the town, from the loss of their labour, and the\r\n    expense of supporting them in their illness. A great number of the\r\n    home-patients of the Infirmary are of this description. The horror of\r\n    these houses cannot easily be described; a lodger fresh from the\r\n    country often lies down in a bed filled with infection by its last\r\n    tenant, or from which the corpse of a victim to fever has only been\r\n    removed a few hours before[177].”\r\n\r\nTwo instances from the same author will show the severe type of the fever.\r\n\r\n    The tenant of a house in Manchester, who was herself ill of typhus\r\n    along with her three children, took in a lodger, a girl named Jane\r\n    Jones, fresh from the country. The lodger fell ill, but the fact was\r\n    kept concealed from the visiting physician until her screams\r\n    discovered her: “She was found delirious, with a black fur on the lips\r\n    and teeth, her cheeks extremely flushed, and her pulse low, creeping,\r\n    and scarcely to be counted.” Treatment was of no use; she “passed\r\n    whole nights in shrieking,” and in her extremity, she was saved, as\r\n    Ferriar believed, by affusions of cold water. Another case, exactly\r\n    parallel, proved fatal in three days:\r\n\r\n    “In 1792 I had two patients ill of typhus in an infected\r\n    lodging-house. I desired that they might be washed with cold water;\r\n    and a healthy, ruddy young woman of the neighbourhood undertook the\r\n    office. Though apparently in perfect health before she went into the\r\n    sick chamber, she complained of the intolerable smell of the patients,\r\n    and said she felt a head-ache when she came down stairs. She sickened,\r\n    and died of the fever in three days[178].”\r\n\r\nThese are instances of country-bred people, plunging abruptly into the\r\nfever-dens of cities and catching a typhus severe in the direct ratio of\r\ntheir ruddy, healthy condition. Another class of cases is that of persons\r\ncarrying the atmosphere of a gaol into the company of healthy and\r\notherwise favourably situated people. Howard gives a case: at Axminster a\r\nprisoner discharged from Exeter gaol in 1755 infected his family with the\r\ngaol-distemper, of which two of them died, and many others in that town.\r\nThe best illustrations of the greater severity and fatality of typhus\r\namong the well-to-do come from Ireland, in times of famine, and will be\r\nfound in another chapter. But it may be said here, so that this point in\r\nthe natural history of typhus fever may not be suspected of exaggeration,\r\nthat the enormously greater fatality of typhus (of course, in a smaller\r\nnumber of cases) among the richer classes in the Irish famines, who had\r\nexposed themselves in the work of administration, of justice, or of\r\ncharity, rests upon the unimpeachable authority of such men as Graves, and\r\nupon the concurrent evidence of many.\r\n\r\n\r\nShip-Fever.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of fevers in ships of war and transports from the\r\nRestoration onwards can be learned but imperfectly, and learned at all\r\nonly with much trouble. Sir Gilbert Blane, who was not wanting in aptitude\r\nand had the archives of the Navy Office at his service, goes no farther\r\nback than 1779, from which date an account was kept of the causes of death\r\nin the naval hospitals. But the deaths on board ships of the fleet were\r\nnot systematically recorded until 1811, when the Board of Admiralty\r\ninstructed all commanders of ships of war to send to the Naval Office an\r\nannual account of all the deaths of men on board[179]. The sources of\r\ninformation for earlier periods are more casual.\r\n\r\nThe war with France, which dated from the accession of William III. and\r\ncontinued until the Peace of Ryswick in 1697, led to numerous conflicts\r\nwith French and Spaniards in the West Indies, and to naval expeditions\r\nyear after year. The loss of life from sickness in the British ships for a\r\nfew years at the end of the century was such as can hardly be realized by\r\nus. Some part of it happened on the outward voyages, but by far the\r\ngreater part of it was from the poison of yellow fever which had entered\r\nthe ships in the anchorages of West Indian colonies. It was probably to\r\nthat cause that the enormous mortality in the fleet under Sir Francis\r\nWheeler was owing. After some ineffective operations against the French in\r\nthe Windward Islands in the winter of 1693-4, he sailed for North America\r\nwith the intention of attacking Quebec. This he failed to do, having\r\nsailed from Boston for home on the 3rd of August without entering the St\r\nLawrence. The reason of the failure was probably the extraordinary\r\nfatality which Cotton Mather, of Boston, professes to have heard from the\r\nadmiral himself, namely, that he lost by a malignant fever on the passage\r\nfrom Barbados to Boston 1300 sailors out of 2100, and 1800 soldiers out of\r\n2400[180].\r\n\r\nAnother instance comes from Carlisle Bay, Barbados. The slave ship\r\n‘Hannibal’ arrived there in November, 1694, during a disastrous epidemic\r\nof yellow fever. Phillips, the captain, whose journal of the voyage is\r\npublished[181], had great difficulty in saving his crew from being pressed\r\ninto the king’s ships, which were short of men owing to the yellow fever.\r\nCaptain Sherman, of the ‘Tiger,’ who convoyed the ‘Hannibal’ and other\r\nmerchantmen back to England in April, 1695, told Phillips that he buried\r\nsix hundred men out of his ship during the two years that he lay at\r\nBarbados, though his complement was but 220, “still pressing men out of\r\nthe merchant ships that came in, to recruit his number in the room of\r\nthose that died daily.”\r\n\r\nThese and other similar experiences of yellow fever in the West Indies,\r\nwhich might be collected from the naval history, do not come properly into\r\nthis chapter; and I pass from them to ship-fever proper, having indicated\r\nhow much of the loss of life abroad was due to yellow fever.\r\n\r\nSome light is thrown upon the state of health on board ships of war on the\r\nhome station by Dr William Cockburn, physician to the fleet, afterwards\r\nthe friend of Swift, who calls him “honest Dr Cockburn.” He had a secret\r\nremedy for dysentery, which he succeeded in getting adopted by the\r\nAdmiralty, greatly to his own emolument for many years after. Dining on\r\nboard one of the ships at Portsmouth, in 1696, with Lord Berkeley of\r\nStratton, he brought up the subject of his electuary, and arranged for a\r\npublic trial of it next day on board the ‘Sandwich.’ An uncertain number,\r\nwhich looks to have been about seven in Cockburn’s own account, but became\r\nseventy in the pamphlet which advertised the electuary after his death,\r\nwere available for the trial and were speedily cured. Cockburn’s three\r\nessays on the health of seamen[182] leave no doubt as to the extensive\r\nprevalence of scurvy and the causes thereof; while his references to\r\n“malignant fever,” although they are, as usual, brought in to illustrate\r\nsome doctrinal or theoretical point, give colour to the belief that\r\nship-typhus may have been as common then as we know it to have been in the\r\nships at Portsmouth and Plymouth, on the more direct testimony of Huxham\r\nin 1736, and of Lind twenty years later.\r\n\r\nA naval surgeon of the time of William III. and Anne, was induced by his\r\nenthusiasm for blood-letting in fevers to record some of his experiences\r\non board ship[183]. It was usually the lustiest, both of the young, strong\r\nand healthy people, and likewise of the elder sort, that died of fevers,\r\nthe symptoms which proved so mortal having been delirium, phrenitis, coma\r\nor stupor, whether they occurred in the συνόχοι (of Sydenham) or in the\r\nσυνεχεῖς (of the same author):\r\n\r\n    “I had observed in a ship of war whose complement was near 500, in a\r\n    Mediterranean voyage in the year 1694, where we lost about 90 or 100\r\n    men, mostly by fevers, that those who died were commonly the young,\r\n    but almost always the strongest, lustiest, handsomest persons, and\r\n    that two or three escaped by means of such [natural] haemorrhagies,\r\n    which were five or six pounds of blood”--the point being that the\r\n    amount of blood drawn by phlebotomy should be in proportion to the\r\n    robustness and body-weight of the patient.\r\n\r\nIn 1703 and 1704 he was surgeon to two of Her Majesty’s ships “where a\r\ndelirium, stupor and phrenitis” were found as symptoms of the fevers. In\r\nthe summer of 1704, cruising in the latitudes of Portugal and Spain, the\r\nmen brought on board from Lisbon unripe lemons with which they made great\r\nquantities of punch. This was the evident cause of a cholera morbus and\r\ndysentery: “after this we had a pretty many taken with the _synochus\r\nputris_, and some with the _causus_” [malignant fever]. Most of these\r\nfevers went off by a crisis in sweating, “which was so large I had good\r\nreason to believe it judicatory.” In several the fevers left on the 9th,\r\n10th or 11th day, and in almost all by the 14th. “About the latter end of\r\nJuly, and in August, there were many taken with a delirium and stupor or\r\ncoma, and some with the phrenitis in their fever.” Among the symptoms was\r\none which we find described for fevers on board ship on the West Coast of\r\nAfrica at the same time--“soreness all over as if from blows with a cane,”\r\na symptom afterwards associated with dengue. “Sometimes the bones (as they\r\nterm it) don’t pain them much.” In some cases there were petechial spots\r\nas well as a stupor. In the month of August “the fevers with a stupor and\r\nphrenitis” came on apace. The treatment was to take ten ounces of blood\r\nevery day from the second to the eighth day of the fever, to give tartar\r\nemetic in five-grain doses at the outset, and to administer cathartic\r\nglysters in the second half of the fever. “Seeing the lustiest men now ran\r\nno more hazard of their lives than any other who were usually taken with\r\nthis fever, nor indeed so much, in the beginning of September I resolved,\r\nafter all the phlebotomy was done in these fevers, to try the cathartic\r\nsooner.” Many of these who had accustomed themselves to the liberal use of\r\nspirituous liquors miscarried in the phrenitis.\r\n\r\nWhite left the navy in 1704 and settled in practice at Lisbon, where he\r\nsaw much fever. He had seen epidemics break out in British ships of war at\r\nanchor in the Tagus, crowded with men and prisoners. One case he mentions\r\nin a Lisbon woman, with continual synochus, stupor, and petechiae on the\r\nfifth day: “This was contagious, for she got it by going often to assist a\r\ngunner of a man-of-war, who came to her house with this distemper upon\r\nhim: for many at the same time on board that ship were sick of that\r\ndisease.” Among the causes of fever on board ship he mentions the effluvia\r\nof the bilge-water.\r\n\r\n    Exposed to these emanations were “a multitude of people breathing and\r\n    constantly perspiring in a close place, such as a ship’s _allop_ or\r\n    lower deck next the hould, where is the entry to a certain vacant\r\n    space near the ship’s center, which leadeth to the bottom, for\r\n    gathering all the water together which the ship draweth by leakage,\r\n    and is called the well. Several times there is occasion for some\r\n    people to go down to examine the quantity of the water, and in some\r\n    ships to bore an augur hole to let in as much as will preserve a good\r\n    air. I have often known two or three men killed at a time, as it is\r\n    said; and the reason may be understood from what I said of the general\r\n    effects of that fluid in ordinary fever [he is now writing on heat\r\n    apoplexy], where there is not above two or three inches, but just as\r\n    much as may make a surface, almost equal to the square of the well, of\r\n    stagnant salt water which had been a long while in gathering; and the\r\n    air over the whole _allop_ extremely rarified, and here not at all\r\n    ventilated[184].”\r\n\r\nWe owe it to the accident of the celebrated Dr Freind having accompanied\r\nLord Peterborough’s expedition to Spain in 1705 that some account has been\r\npreserved of the sickness among the troops ashore and afloat[185].\r\n\r\nThe expedition of some 8000 men being then in its second year, fever and\r\ndysentery were by far the most common diseases, so common that “we can\r\nhardly turn, whether at sea or in camp, without finding them as if our\r\ninseparable companions and as if domesticated among us.” In the summer of\r\nthe previous year there had been much fever both in the ships of the fleet\r\nand in the camp before Barcelona: “It was of the continual kind, though it\r\nusually remitted in the day time, and seemed to approach nearly to the\r\nstationary one which Sydenham has described in the years 1685 and 1686.”\r\nHe then gives symptoms, which were on the whole those of the hospital\r\nfever to be afterwards described from Pringle’s medical account of the\r\ncampaigns in 1743-48. Persons of a robust habit were affected more than\r\nothers, and more severely, and carried off sooner. The others were\r\ngenerally taken away by a lingering death. “Some, when the fever seemed to\r\nhave been wholly gone off lay four or five days without pain or sickness,\r\nthough weak; afterwards being suddenly seized with convulsions of the\r\nnerves they in a short time expired”--perhaps the phenomenon of relapse,\r\nwhich Lind recorded for ship-fever fifty years after and was seen among\r\nthe troops landed from Corunna in 1809. In some few the parotids, or\r\nabscesses formed about the groin, carried off the disease.\r\n\r\n    He then gives the case of a lieutenant on board the ‘Barfleur.’ At\r\n    first he was restless and delirious; on the 7th and 8th days he had\r\n    _subsultus tendinum_; on the 8th day his tongue was sometimes fixed,\r\n    and his eyes sparkled; on the 9th day, he was wholly deprived of his\r\n    understanding; he pulled off the fringe of the bed and plucked the\r\n    flocks; when he had before faultered in his speech, he was sometimes\r\n    seized with hiccough. But on the 10th day, after 12 oz. of blood had\r\n    been drawn from the jugular vein, his delirium went off on a sudden,\r\n    and he began to mend, making a perfect recovery.\r\n\r\nUntil the middle of the 18th century there are few other notices of\r\nship-fever, but it is probable that Huxham’s accounts of a very malignant\r\ntyphus among the crews of ships of war at Plymouth in 1735 (as well as at\r\nPortsmouth according to report), and again in 1741, are to be taken as\r\nsamples of what might have been recorded on many occasions[186].\r\n\r\n\r\nFever and Dysentery of Campaigns: War Typhus, 1742-63.\r\n\r\nThe war in Ireland after the accession of William III. produced two\r\nremarkable instances of war-sickness, which are fully given in another\r\nchapter. The campaigns of Marlborough against the armies of Louis XIV.,\r\nfrom 1704 to the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, appear to have found no\r\nhistorian from the medical side, nor does the duke refer to these matters\r\nin his dispatches or letters, beyond a remark in a letter to his wife from\r\nnear Munich, 30 July, 1704, a fortnight before the battle of Blenheim:\r\n“There having been no war in this country for above sixty years, these\r\ntowns and villages are so clean that you would be pleased with them[187].”\r\n\r\nThe war of 1742-48, in which George II. joined Austria against France,\r\nproduced the first good accounts of war typhus, on land and on board ship,\r\nin the writings of Pringle[188]. After the battle of Dettingen, 27 June,\r\n1743, the men were exposed all night in the wet fields; during the next\r\neight days five hundred of them were attacked with dysentery, and in a few\r\nweeks near half the army were either ill of it or had recovered from it.\r\nThe dysentery continued all July and part of August, while the army lay at\r\nHanau. The village of Feckenheim, a league from the camp, was used as a\r\nhospital, some 1500 being quartered in it, most of them ill at first of\r\ndysentery. The latrines appear to have been ill designed and badly kept.\r\n“A malignant fever began among the men, from which few escaped: for\r\nhowever mild or bad soever the flux was for which the person was sent to\r\nhospital, this fever almost surely supervened. The petechial spots,\r\nblotches, parotids, frequent mortifications, and the great mortality,\r\ncharacterized a pestilential malignity: in this it was worse than the true\r\nplague.... Of 14 mates employed about the hospital five died; and,\r\nexcepting one or two, all the rest had been ill and in danger. The\r\nhospital lost nearly half of the patients; but the inhabitants of the\r\nvillage of Feckenheim, where the sick were, having first received the\r\nbloody flux, and afterwards the fever by contagion, were almost utterly\r\ndestroyed[189].” The survivors from the sick troops in Feckenheim were\r\nremoved to Neuwied, where they were relieved; “but the rest, who were\r\nmixed with them, caught the infection.” The mixed troops were sent still\r\ndown the Rhine in bilanders, during which voyage “the fever became so\r\nvirulent that above half the number died in the boats, and many of the\r\nremnant soon after their arrival.” A parcel of tents sent in these\r\nbilanders to the Low Countries were given to a Ghent tradesman to refit;\r\nhe employed twenty-three journeymen upon them, “but these unhappy men were\r\nquickly seized with this fever, whereof seventeen died.” They had no\r\nother communication with the infected but through the tents.\r\n\r\n“These,” says Pringle, “are instances of high malignity. The common course\r\nof the infection is slow, and only catching to those constantly confined\r\nto the bad air. Sometimes one will have this fever about him for several\r\ndays before it confines him to his bed; others I have known complain for\r\nweeks of the same symptoms without any regular fever at all; and some,\r\nafter leaving the infectious place, have afterwards fallen ill of\r\nit[190].”\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Fontenoy on 11 May, 1745, the army was in good health:\r\n“the smallpox was the only new disease; it came with the recruits from\r\nEngland, but did not spread; and indeed we have never known it of any\r\nconsequence in the field.”\r\n\r\nOn the Jacobite rebellion breaking out in Scotland later in the same year,\r\nsome of the returning troops were ordered to disembark at Newcastle, Holy\r\nIsland and Berwick. They had a long voyage, so that a kind of remitting\r\nfever which some of them had acquired in the autumn in the Low Countries\r\nwas “by the crowds and the foul air of the hold soon converted into the\r\njail distemper and became infectious.” At Newcastle most of the nurses and\r\nmedical attendants of the extemporized hospital were seized with it, of\r\nwhom three apothecaries, four apprentices and two journeymen died. But the\r\nmost remarkable experience was on Holy Island. Of ninety-seven men taken\r\nout of the ships there, ill of the gaol-fever, forty died, “and the people\r\nof the place receiving the infection, in a few weeks buried fifty, the\r\nsixth part of the inhabitants of that island.” At Nairn and Inverness\r\nthere was a singular experience in the spring of 1746. The ships which\r\nbrought Houghton’s brigade to Nairn carried also thirty-six deserters to\r\nbe tried by court-martial at the headquarters at Inverness: these men had\r\ndeserted to the French in Flanders, had been found on board of a captured\r\nFrench transport carrying men to aid the Pretender, and had been thrown\r\ninto gaol in England till an opportunity arose of sending them to their\r\ntrial. Three days after the landing at Nairn of the force with which these\r\ndeserters sailed, six of the officers were seized with fever and many of\r\nthe men, of whom eighty were left sick at Nairn; in the ten days that the\r\nregiment remained at Inverness it sent one hundred and twenty more to\r\nhospital, ill of the same fever, which became frequent also among the\r\ninhabitants of the town. “Though the virulence of the distemper diminished\r\nafterwards in their march to Fort Augustus and Fort William, yet the corps\r\ncontinued sickly for some time.” From the middle of February, 1746, when\r\nthe army crossed the Forth, to the end of the campaign, there were two\r\nthousand sick in hospital, including wounded, of which number near three\r\nhundred died, mostly of the contagious fever[191].\r\n\r\nAfter the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, the English troops embarked at\r\nWillemstad for home; “but the wind being contrary, several of the ships\r\nlay above a month at anchor, and, after all, meeting with a tedious and\r\nstormy passage, during which the men kept mostly below deck, the air was\r\ncorrupted and produced the jail or hospital fever.” The ships that came to\r\nIpswich were in the worst state, about four hundred men having been landed\r\nsick there, most of them ill of this contagious fever. The infection was\r\nat first as active and the mortality as great on shore as on board; but\r\nthe virulence of the fever was at length subdued by dispersing the sick\r\nand convalescents as much as possible[192].\r\n\r\nMonro gives a similar account of the camp sickness among the British\r\ntroops during the campaigns in North Germany in 1760-63. In the autumn of\r\n1760, before he joined the forces, there had been much malignant fever and\r\ndysentery: the camp at Warburg was near the battlefield (31 July, 1760),\r\nwhere many of the dead were scarce covered with earth; there were also\r\nmany dead horses, and in a time of heavy rains, the camp, with the\r\nneighbouring villages and fields, was filled with the excrements of a\r\nnumerous army. Not only the soldiers, but the inhabitants of the country,\r\nwho were reduced to the greatest misery and want, were infected, and whole\r\nvillages almost laid waste. When Monro joined at Paderborn in January,\r\n1761, he found the hospitals overcrowded, and the malignancy of the fever\r\nthereby much increased, so that a great many died. “The 1st and 3rd\r\nregiments suffered most, owing to all the sick of each regiment being put\r\ninto a particular hospital by themselves, which kept up the infection, so\r\nthat they lost one-third of those left ill of this fever, and many of the\r\nnurses and people who attended them were seized with it.” He distributed\r\nthe sick men of the Coldstreams among the houses in the town, and lost few\r\nin comparison with the 1st and 3rd regiments. The contagion, under this\r\nbold policy, did not spread.\r\n\r\nTwo points in the symptoms are noteworthy: first the occurrence of\r\nsuppurating buboes of the groins and armpits in several; and, secondly,\r\nthe frequency of round worms.\r\n\r\n    “In this fever it was common for patients to vomit worms, or to pass\r\n    them by stool, or, what was more frequent, to have them come up into\r\n    the throat or mouth, and sometimes into their nostrils, while they\r\n    were asleep in bed, and to pull them out with their fingers. The same\r\n    thing happened to most of the British soldiers brought to the\r\n    hospitals for other feverish disorders as well as this.”\r\n\r\nHe cannot explain the commonness of round worms in the sick, unless it was\r\nfrom the great quantity of crude vegetables and fruits eaten, and the bad\r\nwater. Patients in convalescence often suffered from deafness, and from\r\nsuppurating parotids. Some had frequent relapses into the fever, “which\r\nseemed to be owing to the irritation of these insects,” namely the worms.\r\nMost of those who fell into profuse, kindly, warm sweats recovered, the\r\nsweats lasting from twelve to forty-eight hours, and carrying off the\r\nfever. He never saw any miliary eruptions, and only sometimes petechiae,\r\nor small spots, or marbling as in measles[193].\r\n\r\n\r\nShip-Fever in the Seven Years’ War and American War.\r\n\r\nShip-fever would appear to have been at its worst after the middle of the\r\n18th century. Dr James Lind joined Haslar Hospital in 1758, and brought to\r\nthe naval medical service the same high qualities which Pringle and Monro\r\nbrought to that of the army[194]. The smaller ships, such as the ‘Saltash’\r\nsloop, the ‘Richmond’ frigate, and the ‘Infernal’ bomb were full of fever\r\nof the most malignant kind; of 120 men in the ‘Saltash,’ 80 were infected\r\nwith a contagion much more virulent and dangerous than that in the\r\nguard-ships. The explanation was that the smaller ships were receiving\r\nvessels for the larger ships, and were manned from the gaols; drafts from\r\nthem carried the infection to the guard-ships and to the ships fitting out\r\nfor foreign service. Malignant fever also arose on the voyage home from\r\nAmerica[195]. In September and October 1758, after the reduction of\r\nLouisburg, several of the ships arriving at Spithead were infected with a\r\nmalignant fever; three hundred men were received from them at Haslar\r\nHospital (some with scurvy), of whom twenty-eight died. The ‘Edgar,’\r\nhaving been manned at the Nore from gaols, sailed for the Mediterranean,\r\nand lost sixty men from fever and scurvy. The ‘Loestoffe,’ having lain in\r\nthe St Lawrence for eight months in perfect health, took on board six\r\nconvalescent men from Point Levi Hospital before sailing for home; in\r\nforty-eight hours, fifty out of her two hundred men were seized with\r\nfevers and fluxes, and six died on the voyage home. The ‘Dublin’ on the\r\nhomeward voyage from Quebec buried nineteen, and on her arrival reported\r\nninety men sick of fever, fluxes and scurvy. The ‘Neptune’ was said to\r\nhave lost one hundred and sixty men in a few months, and reported 136\r\nsick. The ‘Cambridge,’ with 650 men in health, sent three of her crew to\r\nthe ‘Neptune’ laid up, to prepare her for the dock; of these three, one on\r\nthe fifth day became spotted and died, and another narrowly escaped with\r\nlife. The ‘Diana’ developed fever during a rough passage home from\r\nAmerica. The ‘St George,’ having sailed from Spithead in 1760, met with\r\nrough weather and had to return on account of sickness. On the other hand,\r\nHawke’s fleet of twenty ships of the line with fourteen thousand men,\r\nwhich defeated the French in November 1759, kept the Bay of Biscay for\r\nfour months in the most perfect health.\r\n\r\nFrom 1 July, 1758, to 1 July, 1760, there were 5743 admissions to Haslar\r\nHospital, the chief diseases being as follows:\r\n\r\n  Fevers         2174\r\n  Scurvy         1146\r\n  Consumption     360\r\n  Rheumatism      350\r\n  Fluxes          245\r\n\r\nOf the fevers some were of an intermittent type, but by far the most were\r\ncontinued ship-typhus. Relapses were common, even to the sixth or seventh\r\ntime. The fever varied a good deal in malignity, but never produced\r\nbuboes, livid blotches or mortifications, and seldom parotids. Twenty-four\r\nmen received from January to March 1760 out of the ‘Garland’ had most of\r\nthem petechial spots accompanied with other symptoms of malignity, and of\r\nthese, five died or 20 per cent. But of 105 received during the same\r\nmonths from the ‘Postilion’ and ‘Liverpool’ only eight died, and those\r\nmostly of a flux. The infection had little tendency to spread among the\r\nattendants at Haslar. In the first six months only one nurse died; in\r\n1759, two labourers and two nurses died, one of the nurses by infection,\r\nhaving concealed some infected shirts under her bed, the other by decay of\r\nnature. Of more than a hundred persons employed in various offices about\r\nthe sick there died only those five in the course of eighteen months.\r\n\r\n    Although Lind’s account of ship-fever in the British navy is bad\r\n    enough, he has collected some far worse particulars of foreign ships.\r\n    Febrile contagion destroyed two-thirds of the men in the Duc\r\n    d’Anville’s fleet at Chebucto (now Halifax), in 1746, the complete\r\n    destruction of which was afterwards accomplished by the scurvy. It was\r\n    ship-fever which ravaged the Marquis d’Antin’s squadron in 1741, the\r\n    Count de Roquesevel’s in 1744, and the Toulon squadron in 1747. He\r\n    takes the following from Poissonnier’s _Traité de Maladies des Gens de\r\n    Mer_: The fleet commanded by M. Dubois de la Mothe sailed in 1757 from\r\n    Rochefort for Louisburg, Canada, having some men sickly. The ships\r\n    touched at Brest, and sent 400 ashore sick. They sailed from Brest on\r\n    3 May, and arrived at Louisburg on 28 June. There was then sickness in\r\n    only two ships, but in a short time it appeared in all the fleet. On\r\n    14 October the fleet sailed from Louisburg for home, embarking one\r\n    thousand sick, and leaving four hundred supposed dying. In less than\r\n    six days from sailing most of the thousand sick were dead. When the\r\n    fleet arrived at Brest on 22 November there were few seamen well\r\n    enough to navigate the ships; 4000 men were ill, the holds and decks\r\n    being crowded with the sick. The hospitals at Brest were already\r\n    occupied, two ships from Quebec shortly before having sent a thousand\r\n    men to them. Fifteen hospitals were soon filled, attended by five\r\n    physicians and one hundred and fifty surgeons. Two hundred almoners\r\n    and nurses fell victims. The infection passed to the lower class of\r\n    the citizens, the havoc became general, and houses everywhere were\r\n    filled with the dying and the dead. At length it got among the\r\n    prisoners in the hulks. This dreadful infection began to abate in\r\n    March, 1758, and ceased in April, having carried off in less than five\r\n    months upwards of 10,000 people in the hospitals alone, besides a\r\n    great number of the Brest townspeople. The stench was intolerable. No\r\n    person could enter the hospitals without being immediately seized with\r\n    headache; and every kind of indisposition quickly turned to fatal\r\n    fever, as in the old plague times. The state of the bodies showed the\r\n    degree of malignity that had been engendered: the lungs were engorged\r\n    with blood, and looked gangrenous; the intestines often contained a\r\n    green offensive liquor, and sometimes worms. Lind’s other instances\r\n    are chiefly of the Dutch East Indiamen that anchored at Spithead with\r\n    fever on board. In Nov., 1770, the ‘Yselmonde’ bound to Batavia, came\r\n    to anchor at Spithead, and buried a number of men every day; two\r\n    custom-house officers caught the fever and died. He gives two other\r\n    instances of Dutch ships bound to Batavia, which came in to\r\n    Portsmouth with fever[196]. The Dutch were said to send annually 2000\r\n    soldiers to Batavia, and to lose three-fourths of them by the\r\n    ship-fever before they arrived. In 1769 Lind saw ship-fever in the\r\n    Russian fleet at Spithead.\r\n\r\nBrownrigg, of Whitehaven, gives a good instance of the diffusion of typhus\r\nin a newly-commissioned ship of war, and thence to the civil population,\r\nwhich bears out Lind’s favourite notion that the gaols and the press-gang\r\nhad far-reaching effects. In the year 1757 a sloop of war had been hastily\r\nmanned at the Nore to protect the shipping between the Irish and\r\nCumberland ports. She reached Whitehaven in May, with fever on board. The\r\nmen were landed and lodged in small houses. Brownrigg found about forty\r\nlying on the floor of three small rooms, very close together, many of them\r\nin a dying state; seven days after he was himself seized with fever, and\r\nhad a narrow escape with life. The ship’s surgeon died of it, his mate\r\nrecovered with difficulty, two surgeons of the town died of it, and two\r\nmore in Cockermouth. The contagion spread widely among the inhabitants of\r\nWhitehaven, Cockermouth and Workington[197].\r\n\r\nLind showed to Howard in one of the wards of Haslar Hospital a number of\r\nsailors ill of the gaol fever; it had been brought on board their ship by\r\na man who had been discharged from a prison in London, and it spread so\r\nmuch that the ship had to be laid up[198].\r\n\r\nWith the outbreak of the American War we begin to hear of still more\r\ndisastrous epidemics of fever in the English fleets. Some instances from\r\nRobertson’s full collection must suffice[199]. The ‘Nonsuch’ left England\r\nin March, 1777, and fifty of her men were carried off by fever before\r\nDecember; in that month, the ‘Nonsuch,’ ‘Raisonable’ and ‘Somerset’ had\r\neach from 130 to 150 men on the sick list, chiefly fever in the\r\n‘Somerset,’ and scurvy in the other two. In April, 1778, the ‘Venus,’ with\r\na crew of 240, was at Rhode Island very sickly; the surgeon told Robertson\r\nthat they had lost about fifty men of fever, which still continued to rage\r\non board: they became sickly from being crowded with prisoners and\r\ncruising with them on board in bad weather. The ‘Somerset’ had buried 90\r\nmen of the fever since she left England, 70 of them being of the best\r\nseamen. On arriving at Spithead in October, 1779, Robertson found much\r\nfever in the Channel Fleet which had lately come in, especially in the\r\n‘Canada,’ ‘Intrepid,’ ‘Shrewsbury,’ ‘London’ and ‘Namur,’ three or four of\r\nwhich were put past service, so much were they disabled by sickness. At\r\nGibraltar Hospital from 12 January to 31 March, 1780, there were admitted\r\n570 men from twenty-seven ships, of whom 57 died; of 110 sick from the\r\n‘Ajax,’ 18 died; of 437 Spanish prisoners, 37 died. Next year, in May,\r\n1781, at Gibraltar, the ‘Bellona’ had buried 27 men since she left\r\nEngland, and had 108 on the sick list. The ‘Cumberland’ had buried 15; of\r\nthe ‘Marlborough’s’ men, 40 had died at the hospital. Robertson had to\r\npurchase at his own expense vegetable acids, fruit and vegetables for the\r\nsick.\r\n\r\n    Some statistics remain of the loss of men in the navy by sickness in\r\n    the Seven Years’ War (1756-62) and in the American War[200]. The House\r\n    of Commons had ordered a return of the number of seamen and marines\r\n    raised and lost in the former; but the return was too general to be of\r\n    much use, the number “lost” having included all those men who had been\r\n    sent to hospital and never returned to their ships, all those who had\r\n    been discharged as unserviceable, and all deserters. The number raised\r\n    was 184,899, and the number “lost” 133,708, besides 1512 killed. The\r\n    Return by the Navy Board for the period of the American War was more\r\n    specific, showing only the number of the dead and killed.\r\n\r\n    _Seamen and Marines raised, dead or killed, during the American War,\r\n    29 Sept., 1774, to 29 Sept., 1780_:\r\n\r\n        Year   Raised    Dead  Killed\r\n\r\n        1774      345      --      --\r\n        1775    4,735      --      --\r\n        1776   21,565    1679     105\r\n        1777   37,457    3247      40\r\n        1778   31,847    4801     254\r\n        1779   41,831    4726     551\r\n        1780   28,210    4092     293\r\n              -------  ------    ----\r\n              175,990  18,545    1243\r\n\r\nFully a tenth part of the men raised were lost by sickness. Fever was the\r\nchief sickness, and as it happened rarely that more than one in ten cases\r\nof fever died, it will be easy to form an approximate estimate of the\r\nproportion of all the men raised for the ships that were on the sick list\r\nat one time or another with fever--nearly the whole, one might guess.\r\n\r\nDuring the three last years of the period Haslar Hospital was constantly\r\nfull of typhus fever. Admiral Keppel’s fleet arrived at Spithead on 26\r\nOctober, 1778, and soon began to be infected with contagious fever; before\r\nthe end of December, 3600 men had been sent to Haslar, which could make up\r\nat a pinch 1800 beds. But the great epidemic at Portsmouth was the next\r\nyear, 1779, when the very large Channel Fleet under Sir Charles Hardy came\r\nin. During the month of September, 2500 men were received into hospital,\r\nand more than 1000 ill of fevers remained on board for want of room in the\r\nhospitals. In the last four months of 1779, 6064 sick were sent to Haslar,\r\nwhich had 2443 patients on 1 January, 1780. There was an additional\r\nhospital at Foston, holding 200, as well as two hospital ships holding\r\n600. The infection was virulent during the winter, when Portsmouth was\r\ncrowded with ships; and in the first five months of 1780, when 3751 cases\r\nof fever were admitted during the decline of the epidemic, one in eight\r\ndied. The following shows how much fever preponderated at Haslar Hospital\r\nin 1780. In 8143 admissions on the medical side, the chief forms of\r\nsickness were as follows[201]:\r\n\r\n        Continued Fevers     5539\r\n        Scurvy               1457\r\n        Rheumatism            327\r\n        Flux                  240\r\n        Consumption           218\r\n        Smallpox               42\r\n\r\n    Blane gives the instance of the ‘Intrepid,’ one of the Channel Fleet\r\n    under Hardy in 1779: “Almost the whole of her crew either died at sea\r\n    or were sent to the hospital upon arriving at Portsmouth. This ship,\r\n    after refitting, was pretty healthy for a little time; but probably\r\n    from the operation of the old adhering infection, she became extremely\r\n    sickly immediately after joining our fleet and sent 200 men to the\r\n    hospital after arriving in the West Indies. Most of these were ill of\r\n    dysentery[202].” During a voyage of three weeks of the ‘Alcide’ and\r\n    ‘Torbay’ from the Windward Islands to New York in September, 1780,\r\n    nearly a half of the men were unfit. In the ‘Alcide’ it was a fever\r\n    that raged, in the ‘Torbay’ it was a dysentery[203].\r\n\r\nThese experiences of fever in the ships of the Royal navy continued to the\r\nend of the 18th century. In Trotter’s time, as in Lind’s, receiving ships\r\nwere a source of contagion to others, one ship of the kind, the\r\n‘Cambridge’ having diffused fever among many ships of the Channel Fleet by\r\nmen drafted from her[204].\r\n\r\nShip typhus was also an incident of the voyages of the East India\r\nCompany’s ships, which nearly always carried troops. In the voyage of the\r\n‘Talbot,’ 22 March--25 August, 1768, with 240 persons on board, “towards\r\nthe end of July a fever of a very bad kind made its appearance, attended\r\nwith delirium, low pulse, petechiae or livid vibices and hæmorrhages from\r\nthe nose, of which one died and three or four escaped hard.” The sick were\r\nisolated, and the infection did not spread. Such outbreaks of typhus were\r\nnot uncommon at sea, although the loss of life from them was small beside\r\nthat from the fevers of Madagascar, Sumatra, Batavia and Bengal. The ship\r\ntyphus usually began on board among the soldiers. The most notable point\r\nis that relapses were common, as Lind also observed at Haslar Hospital;\r\nsome on board the ‘Lascelles’ in 1783 (150 attacks among 151 soldiers) had\r\nrelapsed seven times. It does not appear, however, that the best class of\r\nmerchantmen suffered greatly from fevers. Dr Clark, who compiled a report\r\nof the practice in fevers in the ships of the East India Company from 1770\r\nto 1785, had reason to congratulate the Company on the general healthiness\r\nof their fleet:\r\n\r\n    “When ships set out at a proper season, when they are not too much\r\n    crowded, when the weather is favourable, and no mismanagement appears,\r\n    fewer lives are lost in these long voyages than in the most healthy\r\n    country villages. And in perusing the medical journals I have the\r\n    peculiar pleasure of finding that many ships have arrived in India\r\n    without the loss of a single life by disease,” e.g. the ‘Valentine’ in\r\n    1784, seven months out, with 300 souls, no deaths, and the\r\n    ‘Barrington’ in 1789, no deaths outward bound[205].\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, these English reports give incidentally the most\r\nunfavourable accounts of the Dutch East Indian ships. Three Dutch ships,\r\nthen in Praya Bay, St Jago (Cape de Verde Islands), had buried 70 to 80\r\nmen each, and had some hundreds of sick on board. Another report says:\r\n“Before we left Table Bay several Dutch ships arrived, some of which had\r\nburied 80 people in the voyage from Holland. None lost less than 40 men. I\r\nam informed that some of their ships last year buried 200 men”--the causes\r\nof the sickness being overcrowding, filth, and the slowness of the\r\nvoyages. One experience of the very worst kind happened to an English\r\nexpedition consisting of the 100th regiment, the 98th regiment, the second\r\nbattalion of the 42nd, and four additional companies. They had formed part\r\nof the force for the reduction of the Cape of Good Hope, whence they\r\nre-embarked for Bombay. During the voyage from Saldanha Bay a contagious\r\nfever and scurvy broke out among the troops, who were crowded and badly\r\nclothed; dead men were thrown overboard by dozens, and the regiments were\r\nreduced to a third of their original numbers. Six officers of the 100th\r\nregiment died, and an equal if not greater proportion of those of the 98th\r\nand 42nd.\r\n\r\nThe other chief occasion of ship typhus was the emigration to the American\r\nand West Indian colonies from Britain and Ireland. The Irish emigration\r\nwas especially active from the beginning of the 18th century, owing to\r\nrack-renting and other causes. Madden[206] professed to know that\r\none-third of the Irish who went to the West Indies (perhaps he should have\r\nincluded Carolina) perished either on the voyage or by diseases caught in\r\nthe first weeks after landing; and as we know that typhus attended the\r\nIrish emigration in the 19th century, we may infer that the same was the\r\ncause of mortality in the 18th.\r\n\r\nThe trouble from ship-fever in the navy was so great all through the 18th\r\ncentury that many ingenious shifts were tried to overcome it. Towards the\r\nend of the century, the favourite device was fumigation with the vapour of\r\nmineral acids; one such plan, for which the Admiralty paid a good sum,\r\nended in the burning of several ships to the water’s edge. An earlier plan\r\nwas ventilation of the hold and ’tween decks by means of Sutton’s\r\npipes[207], which found a strong advocate in the Rev. Stephen Hales, of\r\nthe Royal Society[208].\r\n\r\nTwice in the course of a paper to that learned body[209] he asserts that\r\nthe noxious, putrid, close, confined, pestilential air of ships’ holds and\r\n’tween decks “has destroyed millions of mankind”; on the other hand,\r\naccording to the testimony of a captain of the navy, Sutton’s pipes had\r\nkept his ship free from fever. Lind caps this with the case of H.M.S.\r\n‘Sheerness,’ bound to the East Indies. She was fitted with Sutton’s pipes,\r\nthe dietary being at the same time so arranged that the men had salt meat\r\nonly once a week. After a very long passage of five months and some days\r\nshe arrived at the Cape of Good Hope without having had one man sick. “As\r\nthe use of Sutton’s pipes had been then newly introduced into the king’s\r\nships, the captain was willing to ascribe part of such an uncommon\r\nhealthfulness in so long a run to their beneficial effects; but it was\r\nsoon discovered that, by the neglect of the carpenter, the cock of the\r\npipes had been all this while kept shut[210].”\r\n\r\nShip-fever was at length got rid of by more homely and more radical means\r\nthan scientific ingenuity. Lind had shown one root of the evil to lie in\r\nthe pressing of men just out of gaol. Admiral Boscawen, by his unaided\r\nwits, discovered another means of checking it. He avoided the mixing of\r\nfresh hands with crews seasoned to their ships, unless when some evident\r\nutility or necessity of service made it proper; “and upon this principle\r\nhe used to resist the solicitation of captains, when they requested to\r\ncarry men from one ship to another when changing their command[211].”\r\nTowards the end of the 18th century many reforms were made in the naval\r\nservice--in the dietary, in the allowance of soap, in keeping the bilges\r\nclean, in the use of iron and lead instead of timber; so that Blane dates\r\nfrom the year 1796 a new era in the health of the navy[212].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Putrid Constitution” of Fevers in the middle third of the 18th\r\nCentury.\r\n\r\nResuming the history of fevers among the people at large from the great\r\ntyphus epidemic of 1741-42 to the end of the century, we find the\r\nconditions somewhat different in the earlier and later divisions of the\r\nperiod. The time of prosperity, when England exported large quantities of\r\nwheat in every year except two or three, is reckoned from 1715 to 1765;\r\nafter the latter date England gradually ceased to be an exporting country,\r\nowing to various causes, including the increase of pasture farming and the\r\ngrowth of industrial populations in the northern counties. The year 1765\r\nmarks the beginning of what has been called the Industrial Revolution; and\r\nit is also an important point of time in the history of the fevers of the\r\ncountry, for it is in the generation after that we obtain all the best\r\ninformation on what may be called industrial typhus, in the writings of a\r\ngroup of physicians who were at once philanthropic and exact. But there\r\nwas an earlier period of fever, which is somewhat difficult to the\r\nhistorian. It is perhaps the last period in which Sydenham’s language of\r\n“epidemic constitutions” seems to be appropriate, whether it be that the\r\nwriters of the time were still under his influence, or because the\r\nprevalent maladies could not well be accounted for in any other way. The\r\nconstitution in question was a “putrid” one. It coincided with the great\r\noutburst of putrid or gangrenous sore-throat, to be described elsewhere;\r\nand it included an extensive prevalence of fevers which were also called\r\nputrid or nervous, and sometimes called miliary. Fevers of the same kind,\r\nand with the same miliary rash, are described by earlier writers, such as\r\nHuxham. Perhaps the most correct view of the matter is to consider this\r\ntype of fever as corresponding roughly to the middle third of the century,\r\nand as having been interrupted by the typhus epidemic of 1741-42, during a\r\ntime of special distress. Besides the great outburst of putrid or\r\nmalignant sore-throat, there was also a disastrous murrain of cattle for\r\nseveral years; and at Rouen there was a remarkable fever which some\r\nEnglish writers of the time took to be the highest manifestation of the\r\nsame “putrid” constitution that they discovered also in the English and\r\nIrish fevers.\r\n\r\n    The fever at Rouen which Le Cat specially described to the Royal\r\n    Society was an outbreak from the end of November, 1753, to February,\r\n    1754. This outbreak was only one of a series; but as it attacked a\r\n    great number of persons of distinction and made great havock among\r\n    them, it attracted unusual notice and was regarded as something new,\r\n    the rumour spreading over Europe that Rouen had been visited by\r\n    plague. The same fever, however, had occurred there in previous years;\r\n    and allied forms of sickness, of the same gangrenous character,\r\n    including gangrenous sore-throat, could be traced back for twenty or\r\n    thirty years. It will suffice to mention of these the malignant fever\r\n    which appeared in 1748 and continued in 1749, 1750 and 1751. There was\r\n    a fixed pain in the head, pain about the heart, a low fever with\r\n    delirium, often miliary eruptions, continual faint sweating,\r\n    drowsiness, scanty or suppressed urine, abdominal distension. After\r\n    death the stomach was found “inflamed” at places, as well as the small\r\n    intestine. In some cases there were ulcerations which almost\r\n    penetrated the coats. The lungs were engorged with blood. In one case,\r\n    of a young woman aged twenty, the mesentery was filled with obstructed\r\n    glands and the intestines mortified in different places. In another,\r\n    almost the whole mesentery was mortified and there was an anthrax or\r\n    carbuncle at the upper fore part of the armpit. At the same time some\r\n    cases of smallpox, with miliary eruption, also had ulcerations of the\r\n    stomach, with inflammatory spots on other parts of it and of the\r\n    intestine, the mesenteric glands being enlarged and hard. Some of the\r\n    cases at the Hôtel Dieu in 1750 were traced to infection from bales of\r\n    horse-hair; but the type of the disease in those cases did not differ\r\n    essentially from that of other cases. Some rapidly fatal cases in the\r\n    winter of 1752-53 had suppurative inflammation about the heart. (In\r\n    1739 there had been deaths from continued fever at the Hôtel Dieu,\r\n    after an illness of six or seven days, marked by frequent faintings,\r\n    small abscesses being found after death in the substance of the heart\r\n    near the auricles.) The fever among the upper classes in the winter of\r\n    1753-54 was marked, in its most mortal form, by lowness, continued\r\n    fever, pain in the head, cough, sore-throat, nausea, dry black tongue,\r\n    delirium, sweats, stupor, some oppression of the heart, spitting of\r\n    blood, sometimes swelling of the belly, these symptoms being followed\r\n    often by miliary eruption, and sometimes by a slight flux with blood.\r\n    Many were affected with a dejection of spirits, and with a feeling of\r\n    terror which made them tremble at the ordinary sound of the voice. The\r\n    fever ran a full course of thirty or forty days (the miliary eruption\r\n    coming about the 21st day), while death usually ensued about the 25th.\r\n    The appearances after death were remarkable (many bodies were opened):\r\n    “In some a part of the villous coat of the stomach and of the small\r\n    guts was inflamed; and the rest of these organs were filled with an\r\n    eruption of the miliary crystalline kind, except that it was larger;\r\n    and there was likewise an obstruction in the glands of the mesentery.\r\n    In others a strong inflammation had seized the whole stomach and a\r\n    small portion of the oesophagus, but the intestines were free.... In\r\n    those cases where the delirium had continued long and violent, we\r\n    found either ulceration on the stomach, or its villous coat separated,\r\n    together with a great inflammation, and even some gangrenous spots, on\r\n    the other coats of that organ.” Some recovered by critical abscesses.\r\n    Others who escaped death by the poison carried its terrible effects\r\n    for many months; their limbs and joints were feeble, and they were\r\n    troubled with vertigo, lassitude and fears[213].\r\n\r\nExactly covering the period of these fevers at Rouen, there were low\r\nputrid fevers in London, in Worcestershire, in Ireland, and among the\r\nEnglish colonists in Barbados. It was certainly not a mere fashion in\r\nmedicine which produced the accounts of a similar fever, for these\r\naccounts came from places far apart and were independent of each other. Dr\r\nFothergill, of Lombard Street, published in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_\r\nevery month for five years a short account of the weather and prevalent\r\ndiseases of London, beginning with April, 1751, and ending with December,\r\n1755. He had the weekly bills of mortality before him, and he makes\r\nvarious comments upon them; but his accounts of prevalent diseases are\r\nfrom his own observation and by way of illustrating the bills. His first\r\nreference to a fever is under October, 1751: “A slow continual fever, with\r\nacute pain in the forehead: not many attacked, few mortally.” The year\r\n1752 was remarkably free from fevers until November, when we read of a\r\nfatal fever which had rheumatic symptoms at first (as at Rouen in 1744),\r\nattacking the head later, with coma-vigil and a dark-coloured ichor on the\r\ntongue and lips. It continued into January and February, 1753, proving\r\nfatal to several. In the summer and autumn months there were fevers of the\r\nlow, depressed kind, sometimes called “remittents,” with copious sweats,\r\nor “slow, remitting, dangerous fever,” or “slow, treacherous, remittent\r\nfever, too often fatal.” The references to it are most numerous in the\r\nmonths from November, 1753, corresponding to Le Cat’s Rouen narrative. It\r\nwas slow and imperceptible in its approach, the sick often going about ill\r\nfor a week before seeking advice; it was attended with profuse sweats\r\nwhich never relieved, and was fatal to many. It continued more or less\r\nthrough the summer, and from August, 1754, it is again prominent. In\r\nSeptember, it was the most alarming form of disease, and was then commonly\r\nvehement in its access, with lassitude, and pain in the head and back;\r\nunrelieving sweats are again mentioned, with dry tongue, delirium,\r\ncoma-vigil, and death about the 14th-15th day. Fothergill was at a loss to\r\nknow whether he should order blood to be drawn, owing to the low depressed\r\nnature of the fever. In February, 1755, the fever is still “too much of\r\nthe nature of those which prevailed in the preceding months to allow a\r\nrepetition of bleeding.” In April it is called the petechial and miliary\r\nfever, the miliary eruption being of a white sort with a very noisome\r\nscent; the petechial spots turned livid, black and gangrenous; few\r\npatients escaped who had been sweated at the beginning. The fever was\r\ntruly malignant, the patient restless from the outset, the sweats\r\nweakening. Fothergill’s last entries of it are important, under the months\r\nof May and June, 1755. In May, 1755, the fevers were “for the most part\r\nallied to that dangerous remittent which has for some years past more or\r\nless prevailed in different places of this kingdom.” In June: “It does not\r\nappear that either in the hospitals or any part of the city a disease has\r\nbroken out of so dangerous a nature as has been reported. The same kind of\r\nfever that has long continued in this city with some small variations in\r\nits type, still remains, but it is by no means more frequent than it has\r\nbeen in the preceding months, nor is it attended with more unfavourable\r\nsymptoms.”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say how general over England this fever may have been\r\nin the years 1751-57. Our fullest accounts come from Worcestershire; but\r\nthe putrid fever is heard of more widely. Thus a short Latin piece in the\r\n_Gentleman’s Magazine_, dated 14 April, 1755, is on the putrid fever\r\nlately epidemic, and not yet extinct, in some parts of the county of\r\nSomerset and adjoining places; its signs were contagiousness, pains of the\r\nhead and loins, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, quick weak pulse, purple\r\nspots, delirium and coma[214]. Grainger, writing from Edinburgh in 1753,\r\ndeclares his motive for publishing an account of the anomalous fever of\r\nthe Netherlands in 1746-48 to be that the same had lately been raging over\r\nalmost the whole of Britain.\r\n\r\nWe have some particulars for Kidderminster, which can hardly have been\r\nexceptional for an industrial town, and according to the accounts were\r\ntrue also for villages and market towns near. Kidderminster was, in the\r\nyear 1756, a town of about four thousand inhabitants, mostly hand-loom\r\nweavers of worsted and silk. There were no power-looms anywhere in England\r\nat that time; and the condition of the Kidderminster weavers’ houses was\r\ndoubtless what that of the Tiverton community had been fifteen years\r\nbefore. Many of the weavers, we are told, are lodged in small nasty\r\nhouses, for the most part crowded with looms and other utensils[215]. Many\r\nof these houses were built on a low flat of the river Stour, whence rose\r\nputrid vapours after floods. Its situation had served to render the town\r\nspecially unhealthy before, as in the epidemic of 1727-29[216].\r\n\r\nThe first notice by Dr Johnstone is of a low miliary fever from Midsummer\r\n1752 to the end of the year. This was a comparatively mild affair,\r\nalthough it carried off several. But after Christmas it was succeeded by a\r\nfever which would then have been classed as of the putrid kind. The first\r\ngreat season was in 1753, it ceased in the fine years 1754-55, but came\r\nback in 1756 and 1757. It began with languor, lowness, flutterings,\r\nfaintness, vague pains in the limbs, a low quick pulse, giddiness and\r\nslight sickness. Some had a propensity to loose stools and to profuse\r\nhurtful sweats; some bled at the nose, others coughed and spit blood; some\r\nhad pain in the throat, and crimson-red tongue, the sweat and breath of\r\nthe sick had a strong, offensive, putrid smell. In some of the worst cases\r\nlivid petechiae, large livid blotches, and dark brown spots occurred over\r\nthe trunk and limbs. The successful treatment was by mineral acids, bark,\r\nport wine, and vesication. “This malignant fever was very often (though\r\nnot constantly) complicated with, and in general bore great analogy to the\r\nmalignant sore-throat which at this time prevailed in many parts of\r\nEngland.” The fever which prevailed during that remarkable year (1753) was\r\nvery evidently contagious, for whole families were either all together or\r\none after another seized with it. One of the most distinctive symptoms was\r\na tendency to trembling of the whole body, as well as leaping of the\r\ntendons at the wrists. In some the tonsils were beset with aphthous\r\nsloughs, and towards the decline there would be aphthae of the mouth, but\r\nsymptomatic only, and not the dominant lesion as in the ulcerous\r\nsore-throat. About the 15th day the fever was generally at its height. The\r\nmiliary eruptions were critical to the few that had them; the flat livid\r\npetechiae appeared at all times of the disorder. Johnstone then compares\r\nthe fever with that described by Le Cat at Rouen in the winter of the same\r\nyear; and although he had been unable to satisfy his curiosity by opening\r\nany body dead of the fever, he felt sure that these dreadful symptoms\r\narose from some affection of the stomach and small guts, at first\r\nerysipelatous, afterwards gangrenous, and at last truly sphacelous.\r\n\r\nJohnstone’s statement that the putrid fever in Worcestershire in 1752-53\r\nwas often complicated with and bore great analogy to the malignant\r\nsore-throat is borne out by Huxham’s accounts for Plymouth during the same\r\nseason:\r\n\r\n    “In all sorts of fevers,” he writes, “there was a surprising\r\n    disposition to eruptions of some kind or other [including miliary], to\r\n    sweats, soreness of throat and aphthae.” It is hardly possible to make\r\n    out all his cases of “malignant anginose fever” to have been scarlet\r\n    fever with sore-throat. Thus there occurred stench, swelling, and\r\n    samious haemorrhages “commonly in those that died of malignant\r\n    anginose fever above described. I have known the whole body swell\r\n    vastly, even to the ends of the fingers and toes, with a cadaveric\r\n    lividity, though almost quite cold, and an intolerable stench, even\r\n    before the person was actually dead, blood issuing at the same time\r\n    from the ears, nose, mouth and guts[217].”\r\n\r\nThe first years of this putrid or miliary fever were not seasons of\r\nscarcity, there having been no failure of the crops since 1741 (unless in\r\nIreland, in the province of Ulster mostly, in 1744); on the contrary, many\r\nof the seasons had been unusually fine and abundant, the exports from\r\nEngland of wheat, barley, malt and rye in the three years 1748, 1749 and\r\n1750 amounting to four million quarters. Prices were at the same time\r\nfavourable to the poorer classes[218]. But there had been a destructive\r\nmurrain for several years (30,000 cows are said to have died in Cheshire\r\nin 1751), and the harvest of 1756 was a failure.\r\n\r\nTo the month of February, 1756, the season had been very forward, but the\r\nearly promise of spring was blighted by cold, a wet summer and autumn\r\nensued, the fruit crop was ruined, and the corn harvest spoiled by long,\r\nheavy rains. A dearth, bread-riots, &c. ensued[219]; but it is to be noted\r\nthat the revival of the dangerous malignant contagious fever began at\r\nKidderminster as early as April, becoming much worse after harvest. “Many\r\nfor weeks or months laboured under an uncommon depression of spirits, felt\r\ntheir strength abate, with great lassitude, and very often a great\r\nproneness to faint away.” As the summer advanced the fever became truly\r\nepidemic not only in Kidderminster but in many other parts of the West and\r\nNorth-west of England.\r\n\r\n    It went through whole families, who succumbed either all together or\r\n    one member after the other, and was carried from place to place by the\r\n    attendants on the sick. “It prevailed chiefly in poor families, where\r\n    numbers were lodged in mean houses, not always clean, but sordid and\r\n    damp. It seemed to affect such poor families most where there was\r\n    reason to think a sufficiency of the necessaries of life, on account\r\n    of the dearth, had for some time been scantily supplied; yet the other\r\n    poor persons, given to the intemperate use of malt liquors and ardent\r\n    spirits, were observed to be very much liable to its influence. And\r\n    not a few persons in easy circumstances of life were affected with\r\n    this fever like others.”\r\n\r\nFrost in October checked it, and then measles of a malignant type had its\r\nturn among the children, the whooping-cough succeeding the measles. From\r\nNovember to Christmas the putrid fever, which chiefly affected persons\r\nfrom ten to fifty, and more women than men, returned with increased force.\r\nIn fatal cases, the face was ghastly, sunken and livid (the facies\r\nHippocratica), the patient sweated profusely, but seldom became cold till\r\ndeath was at hand. There was an abominable cadaverous stench in the\r\nbreath, perspiration and stools. In these cases death took place from the\r\n12th to the 14th day.\r\n\r\nThe intense and long frost of the opening months of 1757 nearly put a stop\r\nto the fever at Kidderminster.\r\n\r\n    “But in other neighbouring villages and market towns it has since the\r\n    spring hitherto (Dec. 1757) been very frequent in places that were\r\n    little affected with it last year. The families of the poorer sort of\r\n    people universally are the most subject to it. And it is observable\r\n    that the fever in some places first broke out in the parish\r\n    workhouses, and from thence spread among the neighbouring people with\r\n    great malignity. Wherever it has appeared it has given very apparent\r\n    and fatal evidence of its infectious nature[220].”\r\n\r\nParliament was summoned to meet in December, 1756, on account of the\r\ndearth, which formed the topic of the Speech from the throne. The export\r\nof corn (which had reached a million quarters a year not long before) was\r\nprohibited, and the use of grain in distilling stopped for two months. The\r\ndistress was more acute in 1757, and was enhanced by the greed of\r\ncorn-dealers and millers, who used French bolting-mills to grind the mere\r\nhusks of wheat, pease, rye and barley together into meal. Short, who\r\npractised at Sheffield, says that the fever in October and November, 1757,\r\n“was neither so rife nor fatal as in 1741[221].” It raged fiercely in\r\nseveral towns at a distance, “where it went by the name of the miliary\r\nfever,” and was mostly among the poor, half-starved in the dearth of\r\n1756-57. It is heard of again in the district of Cleveland in the winter\r\nof 1759-60, where it seems to have been mostly a disease of children\r\ncomplicated with sore-throat, and allied more to scarlet fever than to the\r\nputrid fever of adults[222]. But at Sunderland, near at hand, there was\r\nspotted fever at the same time, and in Newcastle there was dysentery.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of fever in Ireland in the same period as in England (see\r\nchapter II.) are not without value, as showing that the “putrid” or\r\nnervous type of fever, contrasting with the ordinary typhus of the\r\ncountry, had been remarked there also. Rutty and Sims describe, during a\r\ncertain period, the symptoms of the low, putrid fever, sometimes with\r\nmiliary eruptions, identifying it both by name and in character with the\r\nfever then prevalent in England. The most significant thing in Rutty’s\r\nannals is that there occurred in the midst of the low, putrid fever with\r\nmiliary pustules in 1746, a more acute fever, ending after five or seven\r\ndays in a critical sweat, and relapsing. The same fever, not very fatal,\r\nreappeared in 1748. Sims brings the history of the nervous or putrid or\r\nmiliary fever in Ireland (Tyrone) continuously down to the year 1772, as\r\nelsewhere related. The remarkable phenomenon of tremors or shakings, which\r\nmost witness to, was seen by him in perfection in the year 1771:\r\n\r\n    The tremulousness of the wrists, he says, extended to all the body,\r\n    “insomuch that I have seen the bed-curtains dancing for three or four\r\n    days, to the no small terror of the superstitious attendants, who, on\r\n    first perceiving it, thought some evil spirit shook the bed. This\r\n    agitation was so constant a concomitant of the fever as to be almost a\r\n    distinguishing symptom.” These were not the shakings of an ague, for\r\n    there might be no intermission for days[223].\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most surprising testimony to the existence of an “epidemic\r\nconstitution” of slow, continued nervous fever comes from the island of\r\nBarbados. Hillary, who had kept a record of the prevalent diseases at\r\nRipon, continued the same when he settled in Barbados in 1751[224]. There\r\ncan be no doubt as to the appearance of this fever in February 1753, its\r\nprevalence all over the island for eighteen months, and its disappearance\r\nin September 1754, when, as he writes, “It now totally disappeared and\r\nleft the island, and, I think, has not been seen in it since” (1758). He\r\ngives the same account of it as the observers in England and Ireland,\r\nexcept that he does not describe miliary eruptions and describes jaundice\r\nin convalescent children. It was insidious in its onset (as in London),\r\nthe patient often keeping afoot five or six days; the symptoms included\r\npains in the head, vertigo, torpor, lassitude, vigil, delirium, faintings,\r\npartial sweats, involuntary evacuations, gulpings, tremors, twitchings,\r\ncatchings, coma and convulsions. Recovery was marked by copious equable\r\nsweats and plentiful spitting. “This slow, nervous fever was certainly\r\ninfectious, for I observed that many of those who visited, and most of\r\nthem that attended the sick in their fever were infected by it, and got\r\nthe disease, and especially those who constantly attended them and\r\nperformed the necessary offices of the sick.” It was last heard of in the\r\nremoter parts of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiliary Fever.\r\n\r\nIt will have been observed in the foregoing accounts of the predominant\r\nfevers of the years (roughly) from 1750 to 1760 that there was often a\r\nmiliary eruption, but that it was far from constant. The constant things\r\nwere the lowness, depression, ill-smelling sweats, tremors of the whole\r\nbody or of the wrist-tendons, and other nervous or ataxic symptoms. But we\r\nhear more of a miliary eruption in connexion with that than with any other\r\nperiod of fevers in the history; and this was the time when a controversy\r\narose as to whether there was in reality a distinctive kind of fever\r\nmarked by miliary eruption. Some of the school of Boerhaave contended that\r\nthe phenomenon of miliary vesicles was due solely to the heating and\r\nsweating treatment of the alexipharmac physicians. De Haën and others\r\nanswered that miliary fever was a natural form, independent of the mode of\r\ntreatment. The Boerhaavian contention may be admitted as good for such\r\nmiliary fevers as were described under that name in 1710 by Sir David\r\nHamilton[225]; nearly the whole of his sixteen cases appear to have been\r\nmade miliary by treatment, in so far as they became miliary at all. What\r\nthis physician did was to foretell the approach of miliary symptoms in\r\nvarious maladies (about one-half of the cases being of lying-in women, and\r\nthe rest various), and then to prescribe Gascoign’s powder, Goa stone,\r\nGutteta powder, Venice treacle or other diaphoretics, along with diluents\r\nand the application of blisters; the miliaria appeared about the breast,\r\nneck, and clefts of the fingers in due course (tenth to fourteenth day).\r\n\r\nSo far as his clinical cases are concerned, the late appearance of miliary\r\nvesicles, lasting a few days, is sufficiently explained by the powerful\r\ndrenches administered; and it can hardly be doubted that much of what was\r\ncalled miliary fever was of that factitious kind. But even in Hamilton’s\r\nessay we find indications of a real miliary type of fever; thus he\r\nmentions a class of cases which look to be the same as those described by\r\nJohnstone, Rutty, Sims and others forty years after--cases with\r\nwakefulness, depression, tremblings of the tongue and hands, convulsive\r\nmovements and delirium. He mentions also a complication of this with\r\nsore-throat in 1704, which destroyed many.\r\n\r\nAs to the association of miliary eruption with the low putrid fever so\r\ncharacteristic of the sixth decade of the 18th century, it is asserted by\r\ntoo many and in too various circumstances for any doubt as to its reality.\r\nThere is nothing to show that the alexipharmac treatment was the one\r\nalways used; and it is not certain that some in Ireland and elsewhere who\r\nhad miliary eruption received any medical treatment at all. Again, miliary\r\nvesicles, not always with perspiration, were commonly found in the\r\nrelapsing fever of Irish emigrants in London during the great famine of\r\nIreland in 1846-47, by which time the powerful drenches of the\r\nalexipharmac treatment had been long disused[226]. The controversy as to\r\nthe reality of miliary fever was one of the kind usual in medicine:\r\ncertain physicians, of whom Hamilton in 1710 was an obvious instance, took\r\nup an untenable position; they were answered according to the weakness of\r\ntheir argument; and that has been held in later times to be an answer to\r\nall who alleged the existence of a type of fever marked by miliary\r\neruptions. There can be no question as to a low, “putrid” kind of fever in\r\nwhich miliary eruptions were usual; but offensive sweats were perhaps\r\nmore usual, whence the name of putrid in a literal sense, different from\r\nthe theoretical sense of Willis; more constant also were the starting of\r\ntendons, the tremors and shakings, together with very varied hysteric\r\nsymptoms, from which the fevers received the name of nervous. Dr John\r\nFordyce in his ‘History of a Miliary Fever’ (1758) really describes under\r\nthat name the symptoms of the low, nervous, putrid fever, often attended\r\nwith miliary vesicles, which had been the common type in England in the\r\nyears immediately preceding, and was a common type for some time after,\r\nalthough less is heard of the miliary eruptions in the later history[227].\r\n\r\nAbout the last quarter of the 18th century medical writers were inclined\r\nto drop the names of nervous and putrid as distinctive of certain fevers.\r\nPringle, in his edition of 1775, says he had been careful to avoid the\r\nterms nervous, bilious, putrid and malignant, which conveyed either no\r\nclear idea or a false one. Armstrong, another army physician, writing in\r\n1773, says: “Nervous, putrid, bilious, petechial or miliary, they are all\r\nof the malignant family; and in this great town [London] these are almost\r\nthe only fevers that have for many years prevailed, and do so still, to\r\nthe great destruction of mankind. For inflammatory fevers ... have for\r\nmany years been remarkably rare[228].” Dr John Moore becomes sarcastic\r\nover the variety of names given to continued fever, some such generic name\r\nas Cullen’s “typhus,” then newly introduced, being what he desired[229].\r\n\r\nHaygarth, writing of the Chester fevers in 1772, said that the miliary\r\nfever had been “supposed” endemic there for more than thirty years past,\r\nbut he thought it probable that the eruption had generally, or always,\r\nbeen fabricated “by close, warm rooms, too many bed-cloaths, hot medicines\r\nand diet.” He had seen only one case in the epidemic that year, and he\r\nbelieved its rarity at that time was due to the treatment by fresh air and\r\nby “such regimen and medicines as are cooling and check\r\nputrefaction[230].” We shall see later that Percival, for Manchester,\r\ncontents himself with saying that miliary fevers, which were formerly very\r\nfrequent in that town and neighbourhood, now [1772] rarely occur[231]. In\r\nScotland as late as 1782 the type was still nervous or low, and hardly\r\never inflammatory[232].\r\n\r\n_Mortalities in London from fever and all causes._\r\n\r\n        Fever     All\r\n  Year  deaths   deaths\r\n\r\n  1741   7528    32169\r\n  1742   5108    27483\r\n  1743   3837    25700\r\n  1744   2670    20606\r\n  1745   2690    21296\r\n  1746   4167    28157\r\n  1747   4779    25494\r\n  1748   3981    23069\r\n  1749   4458    25516\r\n  1750   4294    23727\r\n  1751   3219    21028\r\n  1752   2070    20485\r\n  1753   2292    19276\r\n  1754   2964    22696\r\n  1755   3042    21917\r\n  1756   3579    20872\r\n  1757   2564    21313\r\n  1758   2471    17576\r\n  1759   2314    19604\r\n  1760   2136    19830\r\n  1761   2475    21063\r\n  1762   3742    26326\r\n  1763   3414    26148\r\n  1764   3942    23202\r\n  1765   3921    23230\r\n  1766   3738    23911\r\n  1767   3765    22612\r\n  1768   3596    23639\r\n  1769   3430    21847\r\n  1770   3214    22434\r\n\r\nIt is singular to observe that in the five successive years in this period\r\nwith lowest fever-deaths and deaths from all causes, the years 1757-61\r\nEngland was at war on the Continent. A similar low fever-mortality\r\ncorresponded with the wars under Marlborough and Wellington.\r\n\r\nThe era of agricultural prosperity in England, which had its only\r\nconsiderable interruptions in the years 1727-29 and 1740-42, may be said\r\nto have met with a more serious check from the bad harvest of 1756. There\r\nwas a recurrence of agrarian troubles in 1764-67, partly through actual\r\nscarcity caused by the extreme drought of 1764, partly through the pulling\r\ndown of cottages and the discouragement of country villages, which\r\nGoldsmith has pathetically described in his poem of the time. Short says\r\nthat the country in 1765 was in general very healthy but for children’s\r\ndiseases. “In some parts the putrid fever roamed about from place to place\r\nin the highest degree of putrefaction, so as several dead bodies were\r\nobliged to be buried the same day as they died.” The price of provisions\r\nwas excessive, meal riots broke out, and the export of corn was stopped,\r\nParliament having been summoned for the occasion in November, 1766[233].\r\nIn 1769, at the time of the formation of Chatham’s ministry, the same\r\ntrain of incidents recurred,--bread-riots, flour-mills wrecked, corn and\r\nbread seized by the populace and sold at low prices, collisions with the\r\nmilitary, the gaols full of prisoners[234]. The long period of cheapness,\r\nhaving lasted half a century, was coming to an end. Moralists and\r\neconomists had much to say as to the meaning of the national distress\r\nwhich began to be felt in the sixties. Want of industry, want of\r\nfrugality, want of sobriety, want of principle, said one, had brought\r\ntrouble on the working class. “The tumults that have lately arisen in many\r\ncounties of England are no other than the murmurs of the people, which\r\nhave been heard for some years, bursting forth at last into riot and\r\nconfusion.” The English, it seems, had returned to their old medieval\r\ntaste for the best food they could get; they would not give up the finest\r\nbread, although the Irish lived on potatoes, and the French on turnips and\r\ncabbage: “The ploughman, the shepherd, the hedger and ditcher, all eat as\r\nwhite bread as is commonly made in London, which occasions a greater\r\nconsumption of wheat.” Women must have tea and snuff, though children go\r\nnaked and starved. Another writes: “The poorest people will have the\r\nfinest or none.” The enclosures had made a want of tillage. “What must\r\nbecome of our poor, destitute of work for want of tillage?” The country\r\nhad for the most part been sickly, labourers scarce, and the farmers not\r\nable to get their usual quantity threshed out. The profligacy of the poor,\r\nprofane swearing, etc., are remarked upon[235].\r\n\r\nIn the last thirty years of the 18th century the accounts of fever in\r\nEngland became more detailed as to its circumstances, and more numerically\r\nprecise. I shall accordingly bring together all that I can find relevant\r\nto fever in London, Liverpool, Newcastle and Chester, and thereafter in\r\nthose towns, such as Manchester, Leeds, and others in the North, which\r\nwere specially touched in their public health by the movement known as the\r\nIndustrial Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nTyphus Fever in London, 1770-1800.\r\n\r\nIn the London bills of mortality the item of fevers diminishes steadily\r\nduring the latter part of the 18th century, the deaths from all causes\r\ndiminish, the births come nearer to the number of the deaths, and in three\r\nyears of the last decade they exceed them. This statistical result is\r\ndoubtless roughly correct; but the bills were becoming more and more\r\ninadequate to the whole metropolitan area; and even for the original\r\nparishes which they included they have not the same value for fever in the\r\nlater period as they had for plague at their beginning[236]. On the other\r\nhand, from about the year 1770 we begin to have more exact medical\r\naccounts of fever in London, which are not indeed numerically exhaustive,\r\nbut good as samples of what was going on. Whatever improvement there was\r\nin the prevalence of typhus fever touched the richer classes. The Paving\r\nAct of 1766 is credited with having improved the health of the City, and\r\nthere were many new streets and squares being built in the west end that\r\nwere, of course, free from typhus. It is to these desirable residential\r\nquarters that the eulogies of Sir John Pringle[237], Dr John Moore[238]\r\nand others apply. The slums of London were as yet unimproved, and but\r\nlittle known to the physicians. Lettsom, who was one of the first of his\r\nclass to visit among the poor in their homes, has much to say of typhus\r\nfever; but he is emphatic that it was nearly all an infection of the poor.\r\n“In the airy parts of this city,” he writes in 1773, “and in large, open\r\nstreets, fevers of a putrid tendency rarely arise.... In my practice I\r\nhave attentively observed that at least forty-eight out of fifty of these\r\nfevers have existed in narrow courts and alleys.” The same is remarked by\r\nCurrie for Liverpool, by Clark for Newcastle, by Percival and Ferriar for\r\nManchester, by Haygarth for Chester, and by Heysham for Carlisle.\r\n\r\nThe quarters of the rich had gradually become detached from those of the\r\npoor. I have shown this more especially for Chester, where the old walls\r\nmade a clear division; but it was general in the second half of the 18th\r\ncentury[239].\r\n\r\nMedical practice lay mostly among the richer classes; the physicians knew\r\nlittle of the state of health in the cellars and tenement-houses of large\r\ntowns. Those physicians who did know how much typhus fever there was in\r\nthese purlieus had to enter a caveat against the incredulity of the rest.\r\nDr Currie of Liverpool, whose facts I shall give in their place, protested\r\nthat he was not exaggerating; a protest the more necessary that a\r\ncontemporary of his own, Mr Moss, a middle-class practitioner, who wrote a\r\nbook specially on the medical aspects of Liverpool, declares that fever is\r\n“rare” in that city, while Currie was treating from his dispensary a\r\nsteady average of three thousand cases of typhus every year. In the same\r\nyears, in February, 1779, a physician to the army, Dr John Hunter, who had\r\ncommenced practice in Mayfair, found on visiting in the homes of the\r\npoorer classes in the west of London cases of fever for which he had no\r\nother name than the gaol or hospital fever of his military experience; it\r\nwas so much a novelty to him, apart from campaigns or transport ships,\r\nthat he gave an account of his discovery of domestic typhus to the College\r\nof Physicians[240]. At length he found so many cases steadily winter after\r\nwinter that he had them sent to the infirmary of the Marylebone Workhouse.\r\nThe practitioners who knew most of the sicknesses of the poor were such as\r\nRobert Levett, Dr Samuel Johnson’s dependant, who lived with the doctor\r\nin the house in Gough Square. Levett had been a waiter in a Paris\r\ncoffee-house frequented by the medical fraternity, and had acquired a\r\ntaste for and perhaps some knowledge of the healing art. He made his\r\nmodest living by the small fees or articles of food and drink which his\r\npoor patients gave him. He had only to issue from the back of Gough Square\r\nby the courts and alleys behind Fleet Street, and he would find in the\r\nregion between Chancery Lane and Shoe Lane hundreds of families seldom\r\nvisited by a physician or by a qualified surgeon-apothecary. The good\r\nLevett was only one of a class. There had always been such humble medical\r\nattendants of the poor in London. An Act of the third year of Henry VIII.\r\nwas directed against them at the instance of the privileged practitioners;\r\nbut the regular faculty is said to have proved in the sequel both greedy\r\nand incompetent, and after thirty years there came another Act, couched in\r\nterms that the bluff king himself might have indited (31-32 Henry VIII.),\r\nwhich asserts those qualities of the profession in so many words, and\r\nestablishes the right of any subject of the king to practise minor surgery\r\nand the medicine of simples upon his or her neighbours. That Act is still\r\npart of the law of England, and under it Levett exercised a statutory\r\nright, perhaps without knowing it[241]. There were many other regions of\r\ncourts and alleys all round the City on both sides of the water, which\r\nmust have been medically served by such as Levett, if served at all. It\r\nwas there that typhus was found and at length clinically described by\r\ncompetent physicians, among the earliest of whom was Lettsom.\r\n\r\nThe General Dispensary in Aldersgate Street having been started in 1770\r\nwith one physician, Lettsom was chosen additional physician in 1773, and\r\nthrew himself into the work with great zeal[242].

The hectic fevers were almost all of\r\nchildren. The fatal cases of fever were fourteen, the fatal cases in all\r\ndiseases for the year having been forty-four. What these putrid, nervous\r\nand remittent fevers were, will now appear from some of Lettsom’s\r\ndescriptions. Fevers with symptoms of putrescency were marked by nausea,\r\nbitter taste, and frequent vomiting, by laboured breathing and deep\r\nsighing, offensive breath, sweats offensive and sometimes tinged with\r\nblood, almost constant delirium, the tongue dry, the tongue, teeth and\r\nlips covered with black or brown tenacious foulness, thrush and ulceration\r\nin the mouth and throat, the urine with a dark sediment, the stools\r\nexcessively nauseous and foetid, and blackish or bloody, the eyes horny or\r\nglassy, with the whites often tinged of a deep blood colour, spots on the\r\nskin like fleabites, or larger haemorrhagic vibices, bleeding from the\r\ngums, nose or old ulcers, hiccup near death, often a cough through the\r\nfever. Lettsom’s treatment consisted in good liquors, Peruvian bark, and\r\nabove all fresh, or “cold” air: “When it is considered that putrid fevers\r\noriginate in close unventilated places, the introduction of fresh air\r\nseems so natural a remedy that I have often admired its aid should have\r\nbeen so long neglected[243].” Accordingly he persuaded the poor people to\r\nopen their windows, and dragged the sick out of doors as soon as it was\r\nsafe to do so; the effects, he says, were wonderful. His fifty-one cases\r\nare most valuable illustrations of the perennial fever in the crowded\r\nparts of London:\r\n\r\n    Case 1 is of a man aged forty who had occasion to visit a miserable\r\n    crowded workhouse in Spitalfields. He was instantly seized with such a\r\n    nausea and debility as induced him to keep his room as soon as he got\r\n    home. At the end of a week Lettsom found him in “the true jail-fever,\r\n    or, what is the same, a true workhouse-fever.” He had involuntary\r\n    stools and leaping of the tendons, and took more wine in a week than\r\n    he had done for many years.\r\n\r\n    Cases 2 to 12 were of several families in one house in a court in Long\r\n    Lane, Aldersgate Street, who had been infected by a discharged\r\n    prisoner from Newgate. Other cases follow, where the infection was\r\n    caught from visiting the sick. In Case 17, Lettsom applied blisters\r\n    “owing to the importunity of the friends,” but without advantage. Case\r\n    30, on 26th October, 1773, was of a family of six persons near Christ\r\n    Church, Lambeth, father, mother, boy of seventeen, child of two\r\n    (slight attack) and two maids. Other localities were courts off\r\n    Whitecross Street, Jewin Street, Little Moorfields, Chiswell Street,\r\n    and St Martin’s-le-Grand. Case 43 was of a woman, aged thirty, in\r\n    Bunhill Row; she attended a relation who died of a putrid fever, and\r\n    was herself attacked; her eyes were bloodshot, her skin marbled and\r\n    interspersed with a general deep-coloured eruption, her cheeks and\r\n    nose mortified. Cases 44-47 were of people in a “very helpless\r\n    situation” in Gloucester Court, Whitecross Street.\r\n\r\nThe year 1773, to which these experiences in a small part of London\r\nrelate, was one of high febrile mortality, according to the Bills. Two\r\nyears after, Dr William Grant was moved to write an ‘Essay on the\r\nPestilential Fever of Sydenham, commonly called Gaol, Hospital, Ship and\r\nCamp Fever[244],’ which, as he said in his preface, “I often see in this\r\ncity: and though so common and fatal, appears not at present to be\r\ngenerally understood.” It was, he says, “an indigenous plant, frequent in\r\nthis city, being produced by close confinement; but it often passes\r\nunnoticed, because unknown.” The deaths by “fever” in the London Bills\r\nwere as follows until the end of the century:\r\n\r\n_Deaths from Fever and from all causes in London._\r\n\r\n          Fever      All\r\n  Year    deaths    deaths\r\n\r\n  1771     2273     21780\r\n  1772     3207     26053\r\n  1773     3608     21656\r\n  1774     2607     20884\r\n  1775     2244     20514\r\n  1776     1893     19048\r\n  1777     2760     23334\r\n  1778     2647     20399\r\n  1779     2336     20420\r\n  1780     2316     20517\r\n  1781     2249     20719\r\n  1782     2552     17918\r\n  1783     2313     19029\r\n  1784     1973     17828\r\n  1785     2310     18919\r\n  1786     2981     20454\r\n  1787     2887     19349\r\n  1788     2769     19697\r\n  1789     2380     20749\r\n  1790     2185     18038\r\n  1791     2013     18760\r\n  1792     2236     20213\r\n  1793     2426     21749\r\n  1794     1935     19241\r\n  1795     1947     21179\r\n  1796     1547     19288\r\n  1797     1526     17014\r\n  1798     1754     18155\r\n  1799     1784     18134\r\n  1800     2712     23068\r\n\r\nThere were higher figures in the years immediately before 1771, the years\r\nto which the generalities of Fordyce and Armstrong relate. There is a\r\ndecline in the fever-mortality towards the end of the century; but it is\r\njust from the years 1799-1800 that we have an account by Willan of the\r\nprevalence and conditions of London typhus, than which nothing can well be\r\nimagined worse. The intermediate glimpses we get of typhus in London in\r\nthe writings of Dr Hunter, physician, and of Dr James Sims, show that the\r\ndisease was perennial.\r\n\r\n    “In the month of February, 1779,” says Hunter[245], “I met with two\r\n    examples of fever in the lodgings of some poor people whom I visited\r\n    that resembled in their symptoms the distemper which is called the\r\n    jail or hospital fever. It appeared singular that this disease should\r\n    show itself after three months of cold weather. Being therefore\r\n    desirous of learning the circumstances upon which this depended I\r\n    neglected no opportunity of attending to similar cases. I soon found a\r\n    sufficient number of them for the purpose of further information. It\r\n    appeared that the fever began in all in the same way and originated\r\n    from the same causes. A poor family, consisting of the husband, the\r\n    wife, and one or more children, were lodged in a small apartment not\r\n    exceeding twelve or fourteen feet in length, and as much in breadth.\r\n    The support of them depended on the industry and daily labour of the\r\n    husband, who with difficulty could earn enough to purchase food\r\n    necessary for their existence, without being able to provide\r\n    sufficient clothing or fuel against the inclemencies of the season. In\r\n    order therefore to defend themselves against the cold of the winter,\r\n    their small apartment was closely shut up, and the air excluded by\r\n    every possible means. They did not remain long in this situation\r\n    before the air became so vitiated as to affect their health and\r\n    produce a fever in some one of the miserable family. The fever was not\r\n    violent at first, but generally crept on gradually ... soon after the\r\n    first a second was seized with the fever, and in a few days more the\r\n    whole family perhaps were attacked, one after another, with the same\r\n    distemper. I have oftener than once seen four of a family ill at one\r\n    time and sometimes all lying on the same bed. The fever appeared\r\n    sooner or later as the winter was more or less inclement, as the\r\n    family was greater or smaller, as they were worse or better provided\r\n    with clothes for their persons and beds, and with fuel, and as their\r\n    apartment was more or less confined. The slow approach of the fever,\r\n    the great loss of strength, the quickness of the pulse with little\r\n    hardness or fulness, the tremors of the hands, and the petechiae or\r\n    brown spots upon the skin, to which may be added the infectious nature\r\n    of the distemper, left no doubt of its being the same with what is\r\n    usually called the jail or hospital-fever.”\r\n\r\nDr James Sims, who had seen much of Irish typhus in Tyrone in his earlier\r\nyears, and had removed to London, wrote of typhus among the poor there in\r\n1786, ten years before the more systematic and more circumstantial\r\ndescriptions by Willan[246].\r\n\r\nThis fever was exceedingly mortal, several medical men, he had reason to\r\nbelieve, falling sacrifices to it. Sims never saw the cases till the 7th\r\nor 8th day, when they were desipient, insensible, with pulse scarcely to\r\nbe felt and not to be counted, all having petechiae. None had scarlet rash\r\nor sore-throat. They sank and died quietly; the strongest cordials did not\r\nproduce the smallest effect, and blisters in many did not even raise the\r\nskin[247].\r\n\r\nIt is in the year 1796 that we begin to have the full and accurate records\r\nby Willan of the prevailing diseases of London month by month as he saw\r\nthem at the Carey Street Dispensary, situated in the crowded quarter\r\nbetween Holborn and the Strand[248]. His first reference to typhus is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “In September, also, fevers usually appear which from their\r\n    commencement exhibit symptoms of malignancy; being attended with a\r\n    brown dry tongue, violent pain of the head, delirium, or coma,\r\n    deep-seated pains of the limbs, petechial spots and haemorrhagy. These\r\n    fevers become highly contagious, especially when they occur in close,\r\n    confined situations, and in houses where little attention is paid to\r\n    ventilation or cleanliness. The disease is extended by infection\r\n    during the months of October and November, but its progress is\r\n    generally stopped by the frosts of December.”\r\n\r\nWillan says little more of fever in London until September, 1798, when\r\nthese contagious malignant fevers became more numerous, both in the city\r\nand adjacent villages, than had been known for many years before; also the\r\nfever was more fatal than usual, one in five or six dying, whereas one in\r\nseven was formerly a very unfavourable death-rate, and one in twenty not\r\nunknown. Haemorrhages, aphthae, diarrhoea, starting of the tendons,\r\npicking the bedclothes, violent delirium, ending in deafness, stupor,\r\nhiccough and involuntary evacuations, were the usual accompaniments of\r\nthis fever. In the corresponding months of 1799 he recurs to the symptoms\r\nof this “malignant contagious fever,” and depicts typhus as clearly as may\r\nbe. In September, 1799, it was “attended with a dull pain of the head,\r\ngreat debility or sense of lassitude and pains referred to the bones,\r\ntremblings, restlessness with slight delirium, a querulous tone of voice,\r\na small and frequent pulse, heat of the skin, thirst and a fur upon the\r\ntongue, first of a dirty white colour, but turning in the latter stage of\r\nthe disease to a yellowish brown. In this form the fever continued\r\nthirteen days without any dangerous symptoms, and then suddenly\r\ndisappeared, leaving the patient, for some time after, languid and\r\ndispirited. All the individuals of a family were successively affected\r\nwith the same train of symptoms; many of them so slightly as not to be\r\nmuch confined to their beds.” In October and November he describes the\r\nsymptoms of the disease in a more dangerous form. By this fever, he was\r\ninformed, some houses of the poor had been almost depopulated, the\r\ninfection having extended to every inmate. “The rumour of a plague was\r\ntotally devoid of foundation.”\r\n\r\nHe then describes the state of the dwellings where such fevers\r\noccurred--the unwashed bed-linen, the numbers in one bed, the rooms\r\nencumbered with furniture or utensils of trade, the want of light and air\r\nin the cellars and garrets and in the passages thereto, the excremental\r\neffluvia from the vault at the bottom of the staircase. It cannot be\r\nwondered at, he concludes, that contagious diseases should be thereby\r\nformed, and attain their highest degree of virulence; and he estimates\r\nthat “hundreds, perhaps thousands” of labourers in and near London, heads\r\nof families and in the prime of life, perished annually from such fevers.\r\nHe denies that his account is exaggerated, and appeals for the truth of it\r\nto medical practitioners whose “situation or humanity has led them to be\r\nacquainted with” the localities[249].\r\n\r\n\r\nTyphus in Liverpool, Newcastle and Chester in the last quarter of the 18th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nLiverpool, in the last quarter of the 18th century, came next in size to\r\nLondon, having a population (in 1790) of 56,000 to the capital’s estimated\r\n800,000. According to a medical author, whose experiences lay among the\r\nmiddle classes, it was everything that could be wished in the way of\r\nhealthfulness and prosperity; but it had a dark side as well. About 7,000\r\nof the people lived in cellars underground, and nearly 9,000 in back\r\nhouses, in small confined courts with a narrow passage to the street.\r\n“Among the inhabitants of the cellars,” says Currie[250], “and of these\r\nback houses, the typhus is constantly present; and the number of persons\r\nunder this disease that apply for medical assistance to the charitable\r\ninstitutions, the public will be astonished to hear, exceeds three\r\nthousand annually.... In sixteen years’ practice I have found the\r\ncontagious fever of Liverpool remarkably uniform among the poor. Seldom\r\nextending itself in any considerable degree among the other classes of the\r\ncommunity, it has been supposed that Liverpool was little subject to\r\nfever; but this will be shewn from authentic documents to be a great and\r\npernicious error.” At the Dispensary in the year 1780 the cases of typhus\r\naveraged 160 per month, the numbers being as remarkably steady from month\r\nto month as from year to year. In the ten years from 1 January, 1787, to\r\n31 December, 1796, 31,243 cases of fever were entered on the books of the\r\nDispensary, an average of 3124 per annum[251].\r\n\r\nOf 213,305 cases of all diseases at the Dispensary in seventeen years,\r\n1780 to 1796, 48,367, nearly one-fourth, were labouring under typhus.\r\nSupposing that these were all the cases of typhus in Liverpool, and that 1\r\nin 15 died, we should have some 150 deaths from typhus in a year.\r\nSupposing also that typhus was relatively as common at that time in\r\nLondon, it will follow that nearly all the deaths under “fever” in the\r\nbills of mortality might well have been from typhus fever; for London in\r\nits several densely populated out-parishes was the fever-quarter of\r\nLiverpool a dozen times over[252].\r\n\r\nThe Newcastle Dispensary was opened in October, 1777, by the exertions of\r\nDr John Clark, who was in correspondence with Lettsom in London[253]. Dr\r\nClark had been in the East India Company’s service, and had seen much of\r\nship-fever and of the fevers of the East. During a visit to his home in\r\nRoxburghshire in the summer of 1770, between his voyages, he attended\r\nseveral persons in continued fever. When he settled at Newcastle he saw\r\nthe worst kinds of contagious fever, in workhouses and “in the sordid and\r\ncrowded habitations of the indigent.” Putrid fever, or typhus, was by far\r\nthe most common disease attended from the new dispensary, although less\r\nthan at Liverpool, the operations of the charity being on a much smaller\r\nscale. It was seldom out of Newcastle a whole year; and in some years, as\r\n1778, 1779, 1783, 1786 and 1787 it was unusually rife in particular\r\ndistricts, often attacking whole families. Scarlet fever was epidemic and\r\nvery fatal in 1778 and 1779, while dysentery attacked great numbers of the\r\npoor in the autumns of 1783 and 1785. The following Table shows the\r\nprincipal diseases attended from the Dispensary during the first\r\ntwenty-three months of its working, 1 Oct. 1777, to 1 Sept. 1779:\r\n\r\n_Newcastle Dispensary 1777-79._\r\n\r\n                          Cases          Too far\r\n                         visited  Cured  advanced  Dead\r\n\r\n  Putrid fever             391     357       9      16\r\n  Ulcerated sore-throat    146     125      11       9\r\n  Dysentery                 72      55       5       4\r\n  Smallpox                  45      29       5       6\r\n\r\nFrom 1 Oct. 1777, to 1 Sept. 1789, the cases of typhus visited were 1920,\r\nof which 121 were fatal. During the winter of 1790 and the spring and\r\nsummer of 1791 it was prevalent amongst the poor, and was frequently\r\nintroduced into genteel families and sometimes even into those of the\r\nfirst distinction. That outbreak was supposed to have been generated in\r\nthe Gateshead poorhouse. For some time its ravages were confined chiefly\r\nto the low, ill-aired, narrow street called Pipewell Gate. In September\r\nit made its appearance in Newcastle; at first the contagion was easily\r\ntraced from Pipewell Gate, and afterwards from one house to another. In\r\nthat outbreak, 188 poor persons were visited from the Newcastle\r\nDispensary, the Gateshead poor having been attended by the parochial\r\nsurgeon. Clark’s ten cases recorded of the epidemic were all of people in\r\ngood circumstances. The Dispensary Tables show cases of typhus every year\r\ndown to 1850, the largest totals being in 1793 (374, 18 deaths), 1801\r\n(435, 20 deaths), and 1819 (368, 14 deaths); and these, we may take it,\r\nwere but a small fraction of all the cases in Newcastle.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most unexpected revelation of typhus is at Chester, from the\r\ntime when Haygarth began to write upon its public health in 1772. Chester\r\nwas then one of the most desirable places of residence in England. Boswell\r\nwrote to Johnson, “Chester pleases me more than any town I ever saw.” The\r\nold city within the walls was occupied by a superior class of residents,\r\nincluding the cathedral clergy, county families, retired officers and\r\nAnglo-Indians, professional men, merchants and tradesmen. It had the best\r\ntheatre out of London. Squares, crescents and broad streets were replacing\r\nmost of the old buildings. The six parishes that lay entirely within the\r\nwalls had a population, in 1774, of 3502, and an annual average death-rate\r\n(in the ten years 1764 to 1773) of 1 in 58 or 17·2 per 1000, the central\r\nparish of St Peter having a rate of 1 in 62, and the cathedral parish 1 in\r\n87. It passed as one of the healthiest cities in the kingdom, being far\r\nbefore Shrewsbury and Nottingham, to say nothing of the large towns where\r\nthe burials exceeded the baptisms. But its moderate death-rate over all, 1\r\nin 42 living, would have been much lower but for the four poor suburban\r\nparishes, with a population of 11,211, which had a death-rate of 1 in 35.\r\nHaygarth gives a deplorable account of them. The houses were small, close,\r\ncrowded and dirty, ill supplied with water, undrained, and built on ground\r\nthat received the sewage from within the walls. The people were ill-fed\r\nand they seldom changed or washed their clothes; when they went abroad\r\nthey were noisome and offensive to the smell. Many of them worked on the\r\nlarge farms around Chester, others at shipbuilding and shipping (Chester\r\nhad then a considerable foreign trade), others at the mills and markets,\r\nothers at a nail-factory, while others were employed by the tradesmen\r\nwithin the walls. Fever seems to have been perennial among them, the\r\ndeaths from typhus having been 23 in 1772, 33 in 1773 and 35 in 1774. “In\r\nthese poor habitations,” says Haygarth, “when one person is seized with a\r\nfever, others of the family are generally affected with the same fever in\r\na greater or less degree.” It became rifer than usual in August, 1773, and\r\nattacked 285, proving fatal to 28, or to one in ten. It had the common\r\nsymptoms of malignant fevers produced by human effluvia, and particularly\r\naffected the head with pain, giddiness and delirium. It attacked in\r\ngeneral the lowest, few of the middle rank, and none (or only one) of the\r\nhighest rank[254].\r\n\r\nChester had no manufactures. Its population had grown rapidly of late, as\r\nthat of Liverpool had grown, the poorer classes being the prolific part of\r\nthe community; but it had no share in the industrial revolution, it did\r\nnot employ its women and children in factories, and it was in some\r\nrespects better than Leeds, Warrington, Manchester, or Carlisle. It is a\r\ngood illustration of a town growing rapidly without manufactures, and of a\r\ncommunity divided by the old walls into two quite distinct sections, a\r\nrich and a poor. Such had been the drift of things in England apart from\r\nthe industrial revolution; but it is the latter which furnishes the best\r\nillustrations of a poor prolific populace, of a growing struggle, and of\r\nthe attendant typhus fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nFever in the Northern Manufacturing Towns, 1770-1800.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of the first two-thirds of the 18th century had been\r\nattended with a very small increase of population. From 1700 to 1750 the\r\nnumbers in England are estimated to have grown no more than from about six\r\nmillions to six millions and a half. The fecundity of many rural parishes\r\nwas swallowed up by emigration to the American and West Indian colonies,\r\nby the army and navy, and by the great waste of life in London and some\r\nother towns. The increase was nearly all north of the Trent, while the old\r\nweaving towns of the south-west had actually declined. Gloucestershire,\r\nSomerset and Wilts were the most crowded counties in 1700. During the next\r\nfifty years, the greatest increase was as in the following rough\r\nestimate[255]:\r\n\r\n                                          Increase\r\n                           1700    1750   per cent.\r\n\r\n  Lancashire             166,200  297,400   78\r\n  West Riding of Yorks.  236,700  361,500   52\r\n  Warwickshire            96,600  140,000   45\r\n  Durham                  95,500  135,000   41\r\n  Staffordshire          117,200  160,000   36\r\n  Gloucestershire        155,200  207,800   34\r\n\r\nIn the counties where population had increased most, much of the increase\r\nwas still rural or semi-rural. Defoe describes how the land near Halifax\r\nwas divided into lots of from two to six or seven acres, hardly a house\r\nout of speaking distance from another, at every house a tenter, and on\r\nalmost every tenter a piece of cloth, or kersey or shalloon. Every\r\nclothier kept one horse at least, to carry his manufactures to the market,\r\nand nearly every one kept a cow, or two or more, for his family. The\r\nhouses were full of lusty fellows, some at the dye-vat, some at the looms,\r\nothers dressing the cloths, the women and children carding or spinning,\r\nbeing all employed from the youngest to the oldest: not a beggar to be\r\nseen, nor an idle person[256]. We have no accounts of the health of this\r\npopulation, except Nettleton’s statistics of smallpox in and around\r\nHalifax in 1721 and 1722, given elsewhere, and the “epidemic\r\nconstitutions” recorded by Wintringham at York during the same period, and\r\nby Hillary at Ripon.\r\n\r\nBefore the earliest of the inventions of spinning by machinery, the\r\nweavers were gathering to the towns of Yorkshire, Lancashire and other\r\ncounties north of the Trent. The spinning-jenny of Hargreaves was wrecked\r\nby a Blackburn mob in 1768, and a mob wrecked the cotton-mill built by\r\nArkwright at Chorley eleven years later. This was decidedly a time of\r\nmovement from the country to the towns, a movement which preceded the\r\nspinning ingenuity of the sixties and may have been stimulated by the\r\nearlier use of the fly-shuttle in weaving.\r\n\r\nMuch of the country round Manchester, though it doubtless retained those\r\nfarm-houses, hedgerows, and field paths which come into the idyllic\r\nopening of ‘Mary Barton’ more than half a century later, was “crowded with\r\nhouses and inhabitants,” as Percival says: so populous were the environs\r\nof Manchester that every house in the township had been found by a late\r\nsurvey to contain an average of six persons. The proportion of deaths was\r\nless than in 1757; but that was chiefly due to the accession of new\r\nsettlers from the country, which raised the ratios of marriages and\r\nbirths[257]. Manchester had increased from a population of about 8000 in\r\n1717 to one of 19,839 (inclusive of Salford) in 1757. When the inhabitants\r\nwere next counted in 1773, they were found to be 22,481 in Manchester\r\n(5317 families in 3402 houses) and 4765 in Salford (1099 families in 866\r\nhouses). According to Percival, who gives these figures, the death-rate in\r\n1773 was 1 in 28·4, the births exceeding the deaths by forty in a year.\r\nThe poor, he says, were now better lodged, and some of the most dangerous\r\nmalignant distempers were less violent and less mortal. Manchester,\r\nhowever, was still an unhealthy place compared with the country,\r\nespecially to young children. Thus, the thirty-one townships in the parish\r\nof Manchester contained, exclusive of the city, 13,786 inhabitants (2525\r\nfamilies in 2371 houses), and of these only 1 in 56 died annually\r\n(compared with 1 in 28 in the city)--the births being to the deaths as 401\r\nto 246 in the year 1772.\r\n\r\nAgain, the bleak upland parish of Darwen with a population in the year\r\n1774 of 1850 souls mostly occupied in the cotton manufacture, had, during\r\nthe seven years before, more than twice as many baptisms as burials (508\r\nto 233), the birth-rate (1 in 25·5) being high and the death-rate (1 in\r\n56) low.\r\n\r\nLeeds had a population of some six or seven thousand at the time of the\r\nCivil Wars, and lost 1325 in nine months of the year 1645 from plague, all\r\nof them the poorer class. A generation or two later, in the time of\r\nThoresby’s ‘Diary,’ it was a centre of the cloth trade; and it appears to\r\nhave grown steadily throughout the 18th century. In 1775 it had a\r\npopulation of 17,117. We hear from Lucas of an epidemic typhus in it\r\nprevious to 1779[258]. Eighty persons had died of that fever in one year,\r\nand many who struggled through the disease died afterwards of lingering\r\ncomplaints. In two courts or yards (such as might have been the Lantern\r\nYard which Silas Marner found pulled down when he revisited Leeds) forty\r\npersons were affected with the fever; some families had received ten\r\nshillings a week from the assessment for the poor. As early as 1779 Lucas\r\nproposed a house of reception for contagious fever, a proposal which was\r\ncarried into effect in 1804, after a whole generation of typhus and at a\r\ntime when there was little fever in Leeds or elsewhere. The infectious\r\nfevers, being chiefly confined to the poor, often prevailed, says this\r\nwriter, for a length of time without exciting much alarm, or without their\r\nfatality being attended to; but, he adds about the year 1790, “should a\r\nfew of the higher rank receive the infection, then the disease is\r\ndescribed in most exaggerated terms.”\r\n\r\nCarlisle was a good instance of the increase of urban population and the\r\nbreeding of typhus. In seventeen years, from 1763 to 1780, the inhabitants\r\nhad increased from 4158 to 6229, many of the immigrants being Scots and\r\nIrish with their families. The chief industry was the making of calico, in\r\nwhich the women and children were employed as well as the men. When Dr\r\nHeysham surveyed the town and suburbs for his census of 1779, he had\r\n“opportunity of seeing many scenes of poverty and filth and\r\nnastiness[259]”; and in the bill of mortality for that year he confesses\r\nhimself astonished that there should be so little fever.\r\n\r\nThe great outburst of typhus at Carlisle began in the end of March, 1781,\r\nwith no very obvious special provocation[260]. Upwards of 600 had typhus\r\nto February 7th, 1782, at which date 12 or 15 were still suffering from\r\nit. The deaths were less than 1 in 10 of all attacked: viz. 2 in May, 4 in\r\nJune, 8 in July, 8 in August, 7 in September, 9 in October, 8 in November,\r\n6 in December, and 3 in January, 1782, a total of 55. Of this total of\r\nfatal cases, 3 were boys, 4 bachelors, and 15 husbands: 3 girls, 2 maids,\r\n22 wives, and 6 widows. Two-thirds of all the deaths were of married\r\npeople; Heysham saw no case in a child under three years. It affected\r\nabout a tenth part of the inhabitants of Carlisle (6299), and raged most\r\namong the lower class who lived in narrow, close, confined lanes and in\r\nsmall crowded apartments, of which there were a great many in Carlisle,\r\ngenerally going through all the inmates of a house where it had once\r\nbegun. On seeking to trace the origin of the epidemic, he found that it\r\nbegan in the end of March, 1781, in a house in Richard-gate, which\r\ncontained about half-a-dozen very poor families. Every window that could\r\nbe spared was shut up, to save the window-tax. The surgeon who attended\r\nsome of these poor wretches told Dr Heysham that the smell was so\r\noffensive that it was with difficulty he could stay in the house. One of\r\nthe typhus patients in this house was a weaver, who, on his recovery, went\r\nto the large workshop where he worked, and there, it was supposed, gave\r\nthe infection (in his clothes) to his fellow workmen, by whom new centres\r\nof infection were made in various other houses. In August, a young man\r\njust recovered from the fever went to his mother’s in the small village of\r\nRockliffe, four or five miles from Carlisle, to get back his strength in\r\nthe country air; his mother soon took the fever and died, and a neighbour\r\nwoman who came to her in her sickness likewise caught it and died. These\r\nwere all the cases known in the village, and they show the enormously\r\ngreater fatality of typhus in those not inured to its atmosphere and\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe state of population and health at Warrington was peculiar, and is\r\ngiven fully in another chapter. There could be no more striking instance\r\nof the growth of what the foreign writers call the proletariat; an old\r\nmarket-town, with a small sail-cloth industry from Elizabethan times, it\r\nbecame a busy weaving town owing to the demand for sail-cloth during the\r\nwar with the American colonies. The whole population of some 9000 men,\r\nwomen and children, were wage-earners; the women were all the while\r\nunusually prolific, and the sacrifice of infant life was enormous,\r\nespecially by smallpox. We have no particular accounts of fevers; but in\r\nthe bill of mortality for 1773, the year of a disastrous smallpox\r\nepidemic, there were 25 deaths from fever, of which 10 were of “worm\r\nfever,” or the remittent of children[261].\r\n\r\nBy the year 1790, when Ferriar’s accounts of fever in Manchester begin,\r\nthe industrial revolution had been accomplished, mills were everywhere,\r\nand the characteristic hardships and maladies of a prolific working class\r\nin a time of slack trade were already much the same as we find them\r\npictured with fidelity and pathos in the pages of Mrs Gaskell half a\r\ncentury after.\r\n\r\nBut, so as not to exaggerate the ill health of the working class in\r\nManchester at the end of the 18th century, let us compare the births with\r\nthe deaths according to the doubtless imperfect registers[262]:\r\n\r\n_Manchester, Births and Deaths, 1770-91._\r\n\r\n  Year   Births   Deaths\r\n\r\n  1770    1050     988\r\n  1771    1169     993\r\n  1772    1127     904\r\n  1773    1168     923\r\n  1774    1245     958\r\n  1775    1359     835\r\n  1776    1241    1220\r\n  1777    1513     864\r\n  1778    1449     975\r\n  1779    1464    1288\r\n  1780    1566     993\r\n  1781    1591    1370\r\n  1782    1678     984\r\n  1783    1615    1496\r\n  1784    1958    1175\r\n  1785    1942    1734\r\n  1786    2319    1282\r\n  1787    2256    1761\r\n  1788    2391    1637\r\n  1789    2487    1788\r\n  1790    2756    1940\r\n  1791    2960    2286\r\n\r\nThe mean lodging-houses in the outskirts of the town, says Ferriar, in\r\n1790[263], were the principal nurseries of febrile contagion: some of\r\nthese were old houses with very small rooms, into each of which four or\r\nmore people were crowded to eat, sleep, and frequently to work. They\r\ncommonly bore marks of a long accumulation of filth, and some of them had\r\nbeen scarcely free from infection for many years past. As soon as one poor\r\ncreature dies or is driven out of his cell he is replaced by another,\r\ngenerally from the country, who soon feels in his turn the consequences of\r\nbreathing infected air. There was hardly any ventilation possible, many of\r\nthese old houses being in dark narrow courts or blind alleys. In other\r\nparts of the town the lodging-houses were new, and not yet thoroughly\r\ndirty; but in these there was a long garret under the tiles, in which\r\neight or ten people often lodged, the beds almost touching. Again, many\r\nlived in cellars, sleeping on the damp floor with few or no bedclothes;\r\nthe cellars of Manchester, however, were better ventilated than those of\r\nEdinburgh, and freer from fever. These cellar-tenants were subject to the\r\nconstant action of depressing passions of the mind. “I have seen\r\npatients,” says Ferriar, “in agonies of despair on finding themselves\r\noverwhelmed with filth and abandoned by everyone who could do them any\r\nservice, and after such emotions I have seldom found them recover.”\r\nAddressing the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester previous\r\nto 1792, he pointed out in an _argumentum ad hominem_ that “the situation\r\nof the poor at present is extremely dangerous, and often destructive to\r\nthe middle and higher ranks of society[264].” And again, “the poor are\r\nindeed the first sufferers, but the mischief does not always rest with\r\nthem. By secret avenues it reaches the most opulent, and severely revenges\r\ntheir neglect or insensibility to the wretchedness surrounding them[265].”\r\n\r\nIn an address to the Committee of Police in Manchester, he instances the\r\nfollowing cases:\r\n\r\n    A family of the name of Turner in a dark cellar behind Jackson’s Row:\r\n    they have been almost constantly patients of the Infirmary for three\r\n    years past on account of disorders owing to their miserable dwelling.\r\n    There are other instances of the same kind in Bootle Street.\r\n\r\n    In Blakely Street, under No. 4, is a range of cellars let out to\r\n    lodgers, which threatens to become a nursery of disease. They consist\r\n    of four rooms communicating with each other, of which the two centre\r\n    rooms are completely dark; the fourth is very ill-lighted and chiefly\r\n    ventilated through the others. They contain four or five beds in each,\r\n    and are already extraordinarily dirty.\r\n\r\n    In a nest of lodging-houses in Brook’s entry near the bottom of\r\n    Longmill-gate, a very dangerous fever constantly subsists, and has\r\n    subsisted for a considerable number of years. He had known nine\r\n    patients confined in fevers at the same time in one of those houses\r\n    and crammed into three small dirty rooms without the regular\r\n    attendance of any friend or of a nurse. Four of these poor creatures\r\n    died, absolutely from want of the common offices of humanity and from\r\n    neglect in the administration of their medicines. Another set of\r\n    lodging-houses constantly infected is known by the name of the Five\r\n    Houses, in Newton Street[266].\r\n\r\nThe fever in Manchester was not always malignant typhus: sometimes it had\r\nthe symptoms and low rate of mortality that suggest relapsing fever. Thus,\r\nin the winter epidemic of 1789-90, very prevalent in Manchester and\r\nSalford, out of Ferriar’s first ninety patients only two died; in some the\r\nskin had a remarkable, pungent heat, in others there were profuse watery\r\nsweats; women were commonly affected with hysterical symptoms during\r\nconvalescence, which was often tedious[267]. A certain number of these\r\ncases would run into “a formed typhus,” with petechiae and all the other\r\nsigns of malignity; and in some seasons, as in the distressful year 1794,\r\ntyphus was the usual form. Two fatal cases in children, examined after\r\ndeath, had peritonitis; “in the one no marks of the disease were\r\ndiscernible within the cavity of the [intestinal] tube;” in the other, the\r\npatient was covered with petechiae[268]. These cases of localized\r\ninflammation in typhus he compares with Pringle’s cases of spotted fever\r\ncomplicated with abscess of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe years 1792 and 1793 passed, says Ferriar, without any extraordinary\r\nincrease of fever patients, although the noxious influences were always\r\npresent. But in the summer and autumn of 1794 “the usual epidemic fever”\r\nbecame very prevalent among the poor in some quarters of the town,\r\nparticularly after a bilious colic had raged among all ranks of people.\r\nThis was a time when work was slack; many workmen enlisted and left their\r\nfamilies. In November and December 1794, as many as 156 sent applications\r\nto the Infirmary in a week to be visited in fever at their homes.\r\n\r\nThis was a memorable time of scarcity and distress all over the country,\r\nthe beginning of a twenty-years’ period of so-called “war-prices,” when\r\nfarmers’ profits were so large that they could afford to double or treble\r\ntheir rents to the landlords. The history of epidemics comes at this point\r\ninto close contact with the economic history, which I shall touch on in\r\nthe sequel, after giving a few more particulars of typhus in England and\r\nScotland generally, previous to the outbreak of the war with France in\r\n1793.\r\n\r\n\r\nTyphus in England and Scotland generally, in the end of the 18th century.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of machinery and the building of mills brought typhus\r\nfever to places much less crowded than Leeds, or Manchester, or Carlisle.\r\n\r\nDr David Campbell of Lancaster saw much of typhus in that town, and in\r\nmill villages near it, in the years 1782, 1783, and 1784. In Lancaster\r\ntown he saw about 500 cases, of which 168 were in men, with 20 deaths, 236\r\nin women, with 11 deaths, and 94 in children under fourteen, with 3\r\ndeaths. At Backbarrow cotton mill, twenty miles from Lancaster, there were\r\n180 cases, of which 38 were in men, with 5 deaths, 11 in women, with 2\r\ndeaths, and 131 in children under fourteen, with no deaths[269]. At this\r\nmill there was an extremely offensive smell in the rooms, which came from\r\nthe privy; the doors of the latter, “for indispensable reasons in the\r\neconomy of these works, where so many children are employed, always\r\ncommunicate with the workrooms.” Every care had been taken to keep the air\r\nsweet, but without effect. The offensive smell was in all the cotton mills\r\nfrom the same cause; and in the Radcliffe mill belonging to Mr Peel, the\r\ntyphus was ascribed to that source, the nuisance having been at length got\r\nrid of. Both at Backbarrow and Radcliffe the houses of the workpeople were\r\nnew, airy and comfortable. In the same years typhus raged with uncommon\r\nseverity at Ulverston and in various parts of Lancashire, where\r\ncotton-mills had been set up[270].\r\n\r\nThe typhus of Liverpool and Newcastle was reproduced in Whitehaven and\r\nCockermouth on a scale proportionate to their size. Whitehaven, the port\r\nof the Cumberland coal-field, was the Newcastle of the west coast, and had\r\na large trade with Ireland. Many of the labourers lived in cellars.\r\nBrownrigg’s experiences of typhus fever in it went back to near the middle\r\nof the 18th century. The Whitehaven Dispensary was opened in 1783, the\r\noccasion for it being thus explained:--\r\n\r\n    “Previous to the establishment of dispensaries Whitehaven and\r\n    Cockermouth were infested by nervous and putrid fever. Many of their\r\n    respectable inhabitants became its victims; and among the lower class\r\n    of people it prevailed with deplorable malignancy. The present period\r\n    happily exhibits a different picture. Notwithstanding our connection\r\n    with the metropolis of Ireland, and other commercial places, contagion\r\n    rarely appears; or, when accidentally introduced, is readily\r\n    suppressed[271].”\r\n\r\nThe following is the abstract of “contagious fever cases” from the records\r\nof the Whitehaven Dispensary from 30 June, 1783, to 9 June, 1800[272]:\r\n\r\n  Year  Cured  Dead  Total\r\n\r\n  1783    75     1     76\r\n  1784   401     9    410\r\n  1785   350    20    370\r\n  1786    91     6     97\r\n  1787    21     1     22\r\n  1788    53     7     60\r\n  1789   103     2    105\r\n  1790   288    21    309\r\n  1791    74     6     79\r\n  1792    17     2     19\r\n  1793     7     3     10\r\n  1794    13     1     14\r\n  1795    28     2     30\r\n  1796    48     1     49\r\n  1797    35     2     37\r\n  1798    12     1     13\r\n  1799    11     1     12\r\n          ----  ---   ----\r\n  Total   1627   85   1712\r\n\r\nThe year 1790 is indicated as an unhealthy one, by the excess of burials\r\nover christenings, also at Macclesfield, where there were 316 christenings\r\nto 380 burials, the proportion being usually the other way[273].\r\n\r\nDr John Alderson of Hull wrote in 1788 an essay on the contagion of fever,\r\nin which there are no authentic details for Hull: “The calamity itself is\r\nthe constant complaint of every neighbourhood, and almost every newspaper\r\npresents us with an example of the direful consequences of infection”--the\r\nreference being to gaols more particularly[274]. Whatever was the reason,\r\nthere was undoubtedly a great deal of typhus in England in the eighties of\r\nthe eighteenth century. Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire,\r\nWiltshire and Buckinghamshire experienced much typhus from 1782 to 1785,\r\nalthough we have few particulars. “The remembrance of its ravages at\r\nGloucester, Worcester and Marlborough,” says Dr Wall of Oxford, “is still\r\nfresh in every mind, where its virulence proved so peculiarly fatal to the\r\nmedical world.” At Aylesbury, Dr Kennedy survived an attack of the\r\n“contagious fever,” to write an account (1785) of the epidemic, which he\r\ntraced to the gaol (the date, be it observed, is subsequent to Howard’s\r\nvisitations)[275]. At Maidstone, also, in 1785, the gaol fever was the\r\nsubject of a special account[276].\r\n\r\nAt Worcester in 1783 the younger Dr Johnstone caught typhus while visiting\r\nthe gaol, which was thereafter rebuilt at great expense. A prisoner took\r\nit to Droitwich where 14 died[277].\r\n\r\nDr Wall gives clinical details of fifteen cases of typhus treated by him\r\nin private practice at Oxford in 1785; one of his patients was an\r\napothecary whose business had exposed him very much to the influence of\r\ncontagion, as he was much employed amongst the poor in the suburbs of the\r\ntown and neighbouring villages and in the House of Industry[278]. In the\r\nyear 1783-85, much of the epidemic fever was of the nature of ague, as\r\ndescribed in another chapter. It is not always easy to separate it from\r\ntyphus; but there is no doubt that both were prevalent together. Thus in\r\nthe parish of Painswick, Gloucestershire, in the spring of 1785 there\r\noccurred both “a contagious fever” and an “epidemic ague,” the latter\r\nhaving left a good many persons dropsical and cachectic[279]. This had\r\nbeen part of an epidemical fever which had raged for some time in the\r\ncounty of Gloucestershire, and is said to have lately carried off a great\r\nnumber of poor. At Norton, within five miles of Gloucester, there lived in\r\ntwo adjoining tenements two families: in one a man and his wife and three\r\nchildren, in the other a man and his wife, of whom only one remained alive\r\non the 1st of March, 1785[280].\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary failure of the harvest in Scotland in 1782 produced much\r\ndistress, and with it fever, in the winter following. The Glasgow and\r\nEdinburgh municipalities imported grain for the public benefit. Various\r\ntraces of the scarcity and fever appear in the Statistical Account written\r\na few years after. Thus, in Holywood parish, Dumfriesshire, some fevers\r\nwere wont to appear in February and March among people of low\r\ncircumstances living in a narrow valley; and the unusual mortality in the\r\ndear year 1782 was owing to an infectious fever in the same cottages. In\r\nthe regular bills of mortality of Torthorwald parish, Dumfriesshire, the\r\ndeaths from “fever” fall in the dear years, 1782-3, 1785, &c. In Dunscore\r\nparish, in the same county, the burials of 1782 rose to the most unusual\r\nfigure of 30 (the baptisms being 17), “owing to a malignant fever[281].”\r\n\r\nBut Scotland was now past the danger of actual famine from even a total\r\nfailure of the harvest. Some farmers were ruined, and many more were\r\nunable to pay the year’s rent; but the very poorest were enabled to find\r\nfood, one source being “the importation of white pease from America.” From\r\nDelting, in Shetland, one of the poorest parishes, the report is: “There\r\nis reason to believe that none died from mere want; but there is no doubt\r\nthat many, from the unwholesome food, contracted diseases that brought\r\nthem to their graves.”\r\n\r\nThe following relating to the parishes of Keithhall and Kinkell,\r\nAberdeenshire, in the scarcity following the lost harvest of 1782, is a\r\ncuriously detailed glimpse of the time:\r\n\r\n    “Several families who would not allow their poverty to be known lived\r\n    on two diets of meal a day. One family wanted food from Friday night\r\n    till Sunday at dinner. On the last Friday of December, 1782, the\r\n    country people could get no meal in Aberdeen, as the citizens were\r\n    afraid of a famine; and a poor man, in this district, could find none\r\n    in the country the day after. But the distress of this family being\r\n    discovered, they were supplied. Next day the [Kirk] session bought at\r\n    a sale a considerable quantity of bere, which was made into meal. This\r\n    served the poor people until the importation at Aberdeen became\r\n    regular, and every man of humanity rejoiced that the danger of famine\r\n    was removed[282].”\r\n\r\nWe hear most of fevers in the Highland parishes, with their subdivisions\r\nof holdings and an excess of population. Thus of Gairloch, Ross-shire, it\r\nis said: “Fevers are frequent, sometimes they are of a favourable kind, at\r\nother times they continue long and carry off great numbers”--the poor in\r\nthis parish, upon the Kirk Session roll, numbering 84 in the year 1792,\r\nand the aggregate money paid to the whole number averaging £6. 7_s._ in a\r\nyear, whereas the fertile parish of Ellon, Aberdeenshire, with 40 on the\r\npoor’s roll, paid them £43 per annum.\r\n\r\nAgain, of the fishing village of Eyemouth, it is said: “The only\r\ncomplaints that prove mortal in this place are different kinds of fevers\r\nand consumptions; and these are mostly confined to the poorest class of\r\npeople, and ascribed to their scanty diet.” And of another fishing parish,\r\nin Banffshire, Fordyce, including Portsoy, it is said: “The most prevalent\r\ndistemper is a fever, and that for the most part not universal, but\r\nconfined to particular districts. It is sometimes thought to arise from\r\ninfection and communication with other parts of the country; at other\r\ntimes from local situations and circumstances of the people’s houses and\r\nhabits of living in particular districts[283].”\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the great French war was the occasion of a considerable\r\nincrease of fever; although no records make it appear so fatal a time as\r\nthe years 1783-86. The commercial distress and want of work which began in\r\nthe autumn of 1792, were intensified by the bad harvests of 1794 and 1795,\r\nwhich followed two harvests also deficient. This was the period of\r\ndistress and of epidemic fever to which Wordsworth referred in the passage\r\nin the first book of the ‘Excursion,’ where he is relating the story of\r\nMargaret’s ruined cottage[284].\r\n\r\nThere is little medical writing upon the epidemic fever of 1794-95; and,\r\nin the very district of Wordsworth’s story, the records of the Whitehaven\r\nDispensary bear no traces of a great concourse of patients. There is\r\nreason to think that the fever, if slow and weakening, was seldom fatal,\r\nthat it was _typhus mitior_, and that it was sometimes, perhaps often,\r\nrelapsing. One glimpse we get of it in the family of the afterwards\r\ncelebrated Dr Edward Jenner of Berkeley, in the winter of 1794-95. He thus\r\nwrites to a friend about the visitation of “grim-visaged typhus:”\r\n\r\n    “You shall hear the history of our calamities. First fell Henry’s [his\r\n    nephew and assistant] wife and sister. From the early use of bark,\r\n    they both appeared to recover; but the former, after going about her\r\n    ordinary business for some days, had a dreadful relapse which nearly\r\n    destroyed her. It was during my attendance on this case that the\r\n    venomed arrow wounded me.... Like Mrs Jenner’s fever, at an early\r\n    period there was a clear intermission for four days.... On the eighth\r\n    day after the first seizure it again set in, in good earnest, and\r\n    continued one-and-twenty days.... Dr Parry was with me from Bath five\r\n    times, Dr Hicks and Dr Ludlow as many, and my friend George was never\r\n    absent from my bedside.... But, to return to that mansion of\r\n    melancholy, Henry’s. His infant girl has now the fever; a servant maid\r\n    in the house is dying with it; and to complete this tragical\r\n    narrative, about five days ago fell poor Henry himself. His symptoms\r\n    at present are such as one might expect: violent pain in the head,\r\n    vertigo, debility, transient shiverings.... His pulse this evening is\r\n    sunk from 125 to 100. The stench from the poor girl is so great as to\r\n    fill the house with putrid vapour; and I shall remove him this morning\r\n    by means of a sedan-chair to a cottage near my own house[285].”\r\n\r\nThis is a tolerably clear picture of a short-period fever with relapses,\r\nor of relapsing fever strictly so-called; the stench, also, of one patient\r\nis characteristic. Barker, of Coleshill or Birmingham, has much to say\r\nunder the same year 1794, of a slow, tedious fever, marked by “sluggish\r\naction and comatose symptoms,” and much subject to relapses; but he does\r\nnot give the duration of the first or subsequent paroxysms, as Jenner\r\ndoes, or the usual length of the clear intervals, his most definite case\r\nbeing of a young woman who died in twenty-four hours from a relapse which\r\ncame on about three weeks after the fever had left her[286].\r\n\r\nIt was the access of fever in 1794-5, and the alarm that it caused among\r\nthe richer classes, that led to the opening of the Manchester House of\r\nRecovery in 1796. In certain streets in the neighbourhood chosen for the\r\nhospital, Portland Street, Silver Street and others in the same block, the\r\ncases of contagious fever for nearly three years before the hospital was\r\nopened are given by Ferriar as follows:\r\n\r\n  Sept. 1793 to Sept. 1794, cases of fever, 400\r\n  Sept. 1794 to Sept. 1795,   \"   \"    \"    389\r\n  Sept. 1795 to May 1796,     \"   \"    \"    267\r\n\r\nThe cases began to be sent to the hospital on the 27th May, 1796, and an\r\nattempt was made to extinguish contagion in the houses, by white-washing,\r\ndisinfecting and the like; so that in the same group of streets there were\r\nonly 25 cases of fever from 13 July, 1794 to 13 March, 1797. Meanwhile the\r\nadmissions to the hospital were few until the dearth of 1799-1802. One of\r\nthe manufacturing towns which is known to have shared in the epidemic\r\nfever of 1794-96 was Ashton-under-Lyne, where upwards of three hundred\r\ncases (with few deaths) occurred in less than three months at the end of\r\n1795. This epidemic must have been somewhat special to Ashton, for it\r\nproduced much alarm in neighbouring places and caused Ashton to be avoided\r\nfrom fear of infection.\r\n\r\nShortly after 1796, Ferriar made an inquiry into an epidemic of fever at a\r\nvillage within a mile of Manchester; the houses were many of them new,\r\nbuilt for the convenience of a large cotton mill; but even the new houses\r\nwere offensive, with cellars occupied by lodgers, and almost every house\r\novercrowded. This was the first fever in the village, and it was traced to\r\na family who had come from Manchester with infected clothes. Stockport\r\nabout the same time erected a House of Recovery, having “the same general\r\ncauses of fever which render the disease so common in Manchester”; and\r\nFerriar adds: “I believe there is not a town in the kingdom containing\r\nfour thousand inhabitants which would not be greatly benefited by similar\r\nestablishments.”\r\n\r\nThe bad harvest of 1794 raised the price of wheat to 55_s._ 7_d._ on 1\r\nJanuary, 1795, and the prospect of another short harvest to 77_s._ 2_d._\r\non 1 July. A famine being threatened, the Government caused neutral ships\r\nbound to French ports with corn to be seized, and brought into English\r\nports, the owners receiving an ample profit. Agents were also sent to the\r\nBaltic to buy corn. By these means the price of wheat, which had risen in\r\nAugust to 108_s._ 4_d._, fell in October to 76_s._ 9_d._ Parliament met on\r\nthe 29th October, and various measures were taken[287]. In the spring of\r\n1796, the climax of distress was reached, wheat being at 100_s._ per\r\nquarter. The harvest of 1796 was abundant and wheat fell to 57_s._ 3_d._\r\nThe harvests of 1797 and 1798 were not equally good, but they were not\r\naltogether bad, and the price of wheat kept about 50_s._ for nearly three\r\nyears, which were years of comparative comfort between the dearth of\r\n1794-96 and the dearth of 1799-1802.\r\n\r\n\r\nFevers in the Dearth of 1799-1802.\r\n\r\nAlthough Willan chooses the end of the year 1799 to enlarge upon the\r\nLondon fever, he does not connect it with the dearth that was already\r\nbeginning to be felt (soup kitchens having been opened in various parts of\r\nLondon). The price of wheat, which had been steadily about 50_s._ in 1797\r\nand 1798, rose in May, 1799 to 61_s._ 8_d._, after a hard winter which had\r\nprobably injured the autumn-sown corn. The harvest turned out ill, and the\r\nprice of wheat rose in December, 1799, to 94_s._ 2_d._ Bounties were\r\noffered on imported foreign grain, but in June, 1800, the price was\r\n134_s._ 5_d._, falling in August to 96_s._ 2_d._ on the crops promising\r\nwell. The latter end of harvest proved wet, much of the grain being lost,\r\nso that the price per quarter of wheat rose to 133_s._ in December. There\r\nwas much suffering, and some rioting. Parliament met on the 11th November,\r\n1800, on account of the dearth, the opinions of the members being much\r\ndivided as to the causes of the high prices. In March, 1801, wheat was at\r\n156_s._ 2_d._ per quarter, beef from 10_d._ to 10½_d._ per pound, mutton\r\n11_d._ to 12_d._ per pound. It is to this year, when the quartern loaf was\r\nat one-and-eightpence, that a comparison by Arthur Young belongs, showing\r\nthe great change in the purchasing power of wages[288]. By the end of\r\nsummer, 1801, wheat rose to 180_s._, and the quartern loaf was for four\r\nweeks at 1_s._ 10½_d._\r\n\r\nWhatever statistics were then kept of fever-cases, show a decided rise in\r\nthe years 1800 and 1801:\r\n\r\n          Manchester   Glasgow                      London\r\n          House of      Royal       Newcastle       Bills of\r\n          Recovery    Infirmary    Dispensary      Mortality\r\n  Year (fever-cases) (fever-cases) (fever-cases) (fever-deaths)\r\n\r\n  1796       371          43            201           1547\r\n  1797       339          83             65           1526\r\n  1798       398          45             67           1754\r\n  1799       364         128             --           1784\r\n  1800       747         104             --           2712\r\n  1801      1070          63            425           2908\r\n  1802       601         104             --           2201\r\n  1803       256          85            352           2326\r\n  1804       184          97            255           1702\r\n  1805       268          99             74           1307\r\n\r\nThe London Fever Hospital was not opened until February, 1802, a small\r\nhouse in Gray’s Inn Lane containing sixteen beds. It came at the end of\r\nthe epidemic, and was in small request during the next fifteen years. The\r\nsame epidemic at Leeds was the occasion of opening a House of Recovery\r\nthere in 1804, twenty-five years after Lucas had first called for it. The\r\nstate of affairs in Leeds, which at length moved the richer classes to\r\nthat step, is thus described by Whitaker[289]:\r\n\r\n    “In the years 1801 and 1802 an alarming epidemic fever spread in Leeds\r\n    and the neighbourhood. The contagion extended so rapidly and proved so\r\n    fatal that some hundreds were affected at the same time, and two\r\n    medical gentlemen, with several nurses, fell victims to the\r\n    disease.... In 1802 whole streets were infected house by house; in one\r\n    court, of crowded population, typhus raged for four months\r\n    successively.”\r\n\r\nOne of the Leeds physicians, Dr Thorp, seized the occasion to urge the\r\nneed of a fever hospital, in a pamphlet written in 1802, in which he said:\r\n\r\n    “In a visit made a few days ago to those abodes of misery, I saw in\r\n    one particular district upwards of twenty-five families ill in\r\n    contagious fever. In some houses two, in others six or seven\r\n    [families] were confined, many of whom appeared to be in extreme\r\n    danger.” The superintendent of the sick poor stated to Dr Thorp “that\r\n    sixty families in epidemic fever are under his care at this time. New\r\n    applications are making daily. In some families three, in others six\r\n    or seven, are in the disease. Forty persons in fever have applied to\r\n    him for medical aid within the present week[290].”\r\n\r\nThe wonder is that, with the enormous prices of food, things were not\r\nworse. At the time when provisions were dearest, work was slack in several\r\nindustries. A commercial report of 1 April, 1801, speaks of the trade of\r\nBirmingham as very distressed, a large proportion of the men being out of\r\nwork; the ribbon trade of Coventry was deplorable, and the woollen trade\r\nof Yorkshire still worse. Evidence of epidemic typhus in various parts of\r\nEngland came out in connexion with the reports on influenza in 1803.\r\nHolywell, in Flintshire, with a large cotton-making industry, had not been\r\nfree from a bad kind of typhus for two years previous to the influenza of\r\n1803[291]. In Bristol there was a good deal of fever in 1802-3, which\r\nfound its way, through domestic servants, into good houses in Clifton,\r\n“and proved fatal in some instances[292].” It is probable that these are\r\nonly samples, the writings on epidemics being singularly defective at this\r\nperiod. The following, dated 10th April, 1802, by a surgeon at Earlsoham,\r\nnear Framlingham, Suffolk, gives us a glimpse of malignant contagious\r\nfever in a farm-house:\r\n\r\n    “The most prevailing epidemics for the last twelve months have been\r\n    typhus maligna and mitior, scarlatina anginosa, measles, and mumps.\r\n    Many of the former have proved alarmingly fatal in several of our\r\n    villages, whilst those of the second class of typhoid fevers have put\r\n    on the appearance of the low nervous kind attended with great\r\n    prostration of strength, depression of spirits, loss of appetite,\r\n    etc., which frequently continue many weeks before a compleat recovery\r\n    ensues.” Five cases, of “the most malignant kind of typhus,” occurred\r\n    in a farmer’s family: one of the sons, aged eighteen, died in a few\r\n    days with delirium, and black sordes of the mouth, tongue and throat;\r\n    then the father, two daughters, and another son, took the infection\r\n    but all escaped with their lives. Of four persons who nursed them, one\r\n    caught the fever, and died. Four persons in a neighbouring family, who\r\n    visited them, took infection, of whom two died[293].\r\n\r\nThere was perhaps nothing very unusual in such instances of country fevers\r\nat the beginning of the century. The incident is exactly in the manner of\r\none that figures prominently in a story of Scottish life and customs at\r\nthe same period, which long passed current as a faithful picture and as\r\nenforcing a much-needed moral[294].\r\n\r\n\r\nComparative immunity from Fevers during the War and high prices of\r\n1803-15.\r\n\r\nFrom 1803 to 1816 there was comparatively little fever in this country.\r\nThis was notably the case in London, but it was also true of all the\r\nlarger towns where fever-hospitals had been established, and it was as\r\ntrue of Ireland as of England. This was, indeed, a time of great\r\nprosperity, which reached to all classes, the permanent rise of wages\r\nhaving more than balanced the increased cost of the necessaries of life.\r\nThe following prices of wheat will show that a dear loaf did not\r\nnecessarily mean distress while the war-expenditure lasted:\r\n\r\nPrices of wheat (from Tooke).\r\n\r\n                _s._  _d._\r\n\r\n  1802           57     1\r\n\r\n  1803           52     3\r\n\r\n  1804 Lady Day  49     6\r\n       Dec.      86     2\r\n\r\n  1805 Aug.      98     4\r\n       Dec.      74     5\r\n\r\n  1806           73     5\r\n\r\n  1807 Nov.      66\r\n\r\n  1808 May       73     6\r\n       Dec.      92\r\n\r\n  1809 March     95\r\n       July      86     6\r\n       Dec.     102     6\r\n\r\n  1810 June     113     5\r\n       Dec.      94     7\r\n\r\n  1811 June      86    11\r\n       Nov.     101     6\r\n\r\n  1812 Aug.     155\r\n       Nov.     113     6\r\n\r\n  1813 Aug.     112\r\n       Dec.      73     6\r\n\r\n  1814 July      66     5\r\n\r\n  1815 Dec.      53     7\r\n\r\n  1816 May       74\r\n       Dec.     103\r\n\r\n  1817 June     111     6\r\n\r\n  1817 Sept.     77     7\r\n\r\n  1818 Dec.      78    10\r\n\r\n  1819 Aug.      75\r\n\r\n  1820           72\r\n\r\n  1821 July      51\r\n       Dec.      50\r\n\r\n  1822           42\r\n\r\n  1823 Feb.      40     8\r\n       June      62     5\r\n       Oct.      46     5\r\n       Dec.      50     8\r\n\r\n  1824           65\r\n\r\nThe only years in the period from 1803 to 1816 in which there was some\r\nslight increase of fever were about 1811-12. There was undoubtedly some\r\ndistress in the manufacturing districts at that time, owing to the much\r\ntalked-of Orders in Council, which had the effect of closing American\r\nmarkets to British manufactures[295].\r\n\r\nThe small amount of fever in London between the year 1803 and the\r\nbeginning of the epidemic of 1817-19 rests on the testimony of\r\nBateman[296], who in 1804 took up Willan’s task of keeping a systematic\r\nrecord of the cases at the Carey Street Dispensary. He has only two\r\nspecial entries relating to typhus: one in the autumn of 1811, when some\r\ncases occurred in the uncleanly parts of Clerkenwell and St Luke’s (“but I\r\nhave not learned that it has existed in any other districts of London”);\r\nthe other in October and November 1813, when there was more typhus among\r\nthe Irish in some of the filthy courts of Saffron Hill, near Hatton\r\nGarden, than for several years past, the infection having spread rapidly\r\nand fatally in several houses. The best evidence of this lull in typhus in\r\nLondon is the almost empty state of the new fever-hospital:\r\n\r\n  Year   Admissions\r\n\r\n  1802      164\r\n  1803      176\r\n  1804       80\r\n  1805       66\r\n  1806       93\r\n  1807       63\r\n  1808       69\r\n  1809       29\r\n  1810       52\r\n  1811       43\r\n  1812       61\r\n  1813       85\r\n  1814       59\r\n  1815       80\r\n  1816      118\r\n  1817      760\r\n\r\nUntil it was removed to Pancras Road, in September, 1816, the London\r\nfever-hospital had only sixteen beds. But Bateman says that no one was\r\nrefused admission, and that for several years the house was frequently\r\nempty three or four weeks together. Also at the Dispensary, in Carey\r\nStreet, he had an opportunity during the period 1804-1816,\r\n\r\n    “Of observing the entire freedom from fevers enjoyed by the\r\n    inhabitants of the numerous crowded courts and alleys within the\r\n    extensive district comprehended in our visits from that charity.” And\r\n    again, writing in the winter of 1814-15, Bateman says: “To those who\r\n    recollect the numerous cases of typhoid fevers [this term did not then\r\n    mean enteric] which called for the relief of dispensaries twelve or\r\n    fourteen years ago, and the contagion of which was often with great\r\n    difficulty eradicated from the apartments where it raged, and even\r\n    seized the same individuals again and again when they escaped its\r\n    fatal influences, the great freedom from these fevers which now\r\n    exists, even in the most close and filthy alleys in London, is the\r\n    ground of some surprise.” And once more, in the summer of 1816, just\r\n    as the new epidemic period was about to begin, he says: “The\r\n    extraordinary disappearance of contagious fever from every part of\r\n    this crowded metropolis during the long period comprehended by these\r\n    Reports [since 1804], cannot fail to have attracted the attention of\r\n    the reader.”\r\n\r\nBateman concluded, not without reason, that this immunity of London from\r\nfever was due to the high degree of well-being among the poorer classes in\r\ntimes of plenty; and although he made out that the poor of Dublin, Cork\r\nand some Scotch towns did not profit by times of plenty so much as those\r\nin London, yet his reason for the abeyance of fever from 1804 to 1816\r\napplied to England, Ireland and Scotland at large, and was doubtless the\r\ntrue reason.\r\n\r\nThe following figures from Manchester[297], Leeds[298] and Glasgow[299]\r\nhospitals, as well as the Irish statistics elsewhere given, are closely\r\nparallel with those of London:\r\n\r\n_Manchester House of Recovery._\r\n\r\n  Year         Cases   Deaths\r\n\r\n  1796-7        371      40\r\n  1797-8        339      16\r\n  1798-9        398      27\r\n  1799-1800     364      41\r\n  1800-1        747      63\r\n  1801-2       1070      84\r\n  1802-3        601      53\r\n  1803-4        256      33\r\n  1804-5        184      34\r\n  1805-6        268      29\r\n  1806-7        311      33\r\n  1807-8        208      15\r\n  1808-9        260      21\r\n  1809-10       278      30\r\n  1810-11       172      15\r\n  1811-12       140      18\r\n  1812-13       126      13\r\n  1813-14       226      17\r\n  1814-15       379      29\r\n  1815-16       185      14\r\n  1816-17       172       6\r\n\r\n_Leeds House of Recovery._\r\n\r\n  Year         Cases    Deaths\r\n\r\n  1804 (2 mo.)   10       0\r\n  1805           66       6\r\n  1806           75       2\r\n  1807           35       1\r\n  1808           80       3\r\n  1809           93       8\r\n  1810           75      14\r\n  1811           92       4\r\n  1812           80      12\r\n  1813          137      11\r\n  1814           79       4\r\n  1815          146      15\r\n  1816          121      13\r\n  1817          178       8\r\n  1818(10 mo.)  254      20\r\n\r\n_Glasgow Royal Infirmary (Fever Wards)._\r\n\r\n  Year         Cases\r\n\r\n  1795           18\r\n  1796           43\r\n  1797           83\r\n  1798           45\r\n  1799          128\r\n  1800          104\r\n  1801           63\r\n  1802          104\r\n  1803           85\r\n  1804           97\r\n  1805           99\r\n  1806           75\r\n  1807           25\r\n  1808           27\r\n  1809           76\r\n  1810           82\r\n  1811           45\r\n  1812           16\r\n  1813           35\r\n  1814           90\r\n  1815          230\r\n  1816          399\r\n  1817          714\r\n  1818         1371\r\n\r\nEven such fever as there was in Britain from 1804 to 1817 was not all\r\ncertainly typhus. The high death-rates at the Manchester fever-hospital in\r\n1804 and 1805 (1 death in 7·5 cases and 1 death in 5·25 cases) may mean a\r\ncertain proportion of enteric cases in those years. “From 1804 to 1805,”\r\nsays Ferriar, “many cases were admitted of a most lingering and dangerous\r\nkind.... Many deaths took place from sudden changes in the state of the\r\nfever, contrary to the usual course of the disease, and only imputable to\r\nthe peculiar character of the epidemic. Similar cases occurred at that\r\ntime in private practice.” Next year, 1806, there was an epidemic among\r\nthe troops at Deal, described under the name of “remittent fever,” which\r\nMurchison claims to have been enteric[300]. In September, 1808, says\r\nBateman, several were admitted into the London House of Recovery, with\r\nmalignant symptoms; “and some severe and even fatal instances occurred in\r\nindividuals in respectable rank in life.” He still uses the name of\r\ntyphus; but he is aware that the cases of continued fever, especially in\r\nthe summer and autumn of 1810, had often symptoms pointing to a\r\nbowel-fever rather than to a head-fever[301].\r\n\r\nThe years 1807 and 1808 appear to have been the most generally unwholesome\r\nduring this period of comparative immunity from fever; they were marked by\r\nthe occurrence of dysenteries, agues, and infantile remittents, as well as\r\nof fevers of the “typhus” kind. The chief account comes from\r\nNottingham[302]. The cases of “typhus” there were very tedious, but not\r\nviolent, nor attended with any unfavourable symptoms, only one case having\r\npetechiae, and all having diarrhoea. The following table of admissions\r\nfor various kinds of fever (as classified by Cullen) at the Nottingham\r\nGeneral Hospital, 25 March, 1807, to 25 March, 1808, shows the\r\npreponderance of “synochus” and next to it, of infantile remittent:\r\n\r\n_Admitted to the Nottingham General Hospital, 1807._\r\n\r\n  Intermittent fever            7\r\n  Synocha                      10\r\n  Typhus                       27\r\n  Febris nervosa               26\r\n  Synochus                    155\r\n  Febris infantum remittens    88\r\n  Dysentery                     5\r\n\r\nThe state of war in the Peninsula was favourable to epidemic or spreading\r\ndiseases, and there is a good deal to show that such diseases did exist\r\namong the British troops[303]. But there is only one good instance of\r\nEngland getting a taste of that experience of war-typhus which the\r\nContinent had to endure for many years. This was on the return of the\r\nremnant of the army after the defeat at Corunna on 16 January, 1809. The\r\ntroops were crowded pell-mell on board transports, which had a very rough\r\npassage home. Dysentery broke out among them, and was the most urgent\r\nmalady when they landed at Plymouth in a state of filth and rags. Typhus\r\nfever followed, but in the first three weeks at Plymouth, to the 18th of\r\nFebruary, it was not of a malignant type, only 8 dying of it in the Old\r\nCumberland Square Hospital; in the next three weeks, 28 died of it there.\r\nUp to the 27th of March, 1809, the sick at Plymouth from the Corunna army\r\nnumbered 2432, of whom 241 died. Of 4 medical officers, 3 took the\r\ncontagion, of 29 orderlies, 25 took it. The fever was in some cases\r\nfollowed by a relapse, which was more often fatal than the original\r\nattack[304]. This was a typical instance of typhus bred from dysentery or\r\nother incidents of campaigning, a contagion more dangerous to others than\r\nto those who had engendered it. “Within a few yards of the spot where I\r\nnow write,” says Dr James Johnson, of Spring Gardens, London, “the greater\r\npart of a family fell sacrifices to the effects of fomites that lurked in\r\na blanket purchased from one of these soldiers after their return from\r\nCorunna[305].” In August, 1813, an Irish regiment passing through\r\nLeyburn, a small market-town of the West Riding of Yorkshire, in an airy\r\nsituation, was obliged to leave behind a soldier ill of typhus, who died\r\nof the fever after a few days. The infection appeared soon after in the\r\ncottages adjoining, and remained in that end of the town for several\r\nmonths, choosing the clean and respectable houses. In a farmer’s family, a\r\nson, aged twenty-nine, died of it, while another son and two daughters had\r\na narrow escape. The disease appeared also in the village of Wensby, a\r\nmile distant, and in other villages. Few lives were lost[306].\r\n\r\nThese were, perhaps, not altogether solitary instances in Britain of\r\ntyphus spread abroad by the movements of troops during the great French\r\nwar. Let us multiply such instances by hundreds, and we shall vaguely\r\nrealize the meaning of the statement that the period of the Napoleonic\r\nwars, and more particularly the period from the renewal of the war in 1803\r\nuntil its close in 1815, was one of the worst times of epidemic typhus in\r\nthe history of modern Europe. It was precisely in those years that\r\nEngland, Scotland and Ireland enjoyed a most remarkable degree of freedom\r\nfrom contagious fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Distress and Epidemic Fever (Relapsing) following the Peace of 1815\r\nand the fall of wages.\r\n\r\nThe long period of comparative immunity from typhus near the beginning of\r\nthe 19th century was first broken, both in Great Britain and in Ireland,\r\nby the very severe winter of 1814-15; but it was not until the great\r\ndepression of trade following the peace of 1815 (which made a difference\r\nof forty millions sterling a year in the public expenditure) and the bad\r\nharvest of 1816 that typhus fever and relapsing fever became truly\r\nepidemic, chiefly in Ireland but also in Scotland and England. The lesson\r\nof the history is unmistakable: with all the inducements to typhus from\r\nneglect of sanitation in the midst of rapidly increasing numbers, there\r\nwas surprisingly little of the disease so long as trade was brisk and the\r\nmeans of subsistence abundant. The reckoning came in the thirty years\r\nfollowing the Peace.\r\n\r\nIn London, says Bateman[307], the epidemic began in the autumn of 1816,\r\nbefore the influence of scarcity was acutely felt, in the courts about\r\nSaffron Hill, the same locality in which he mentioned fever in the winter\r\nof 1813-14 among the poor Irish. But this means little more than that the\r\nIrish, whether in Ireland or out of it, are the first to feel the effects\r\nof scarcity in producing fever. At the very same time that it began among\r\nthem in Saffron Hill, it began among some young people at a silk factory\r\nin Spitalfields. In March, 1817, there was a good deal more of it in\r\nSaffron Hill, as well as among the silk-weavers in Essex Street,\r\nWhitechapel, in Old Street, in Clerkenwell, and in Shadwell workhouse.\r\nMany poor-houses, and especially those of Whitechapel, St Luke’s, St\r\nSepulchre’s and St George’s, Southwark, were getting crowded in 1817 with\r\nhalf-starved persons, among whom fever was rife in the summer and autumn.\r\nThere was also much of it in the homes of working people in the eastern,\r\nnorth-eastern and Southwark parishes, with more occasional infected\r\nhouseholds in Shoe Lane, Clare Market, Somers Town and St Giles’s in the\r\nFields (“in the filthy streets between Dyot Street and the end of Oxford\r\nStreet”)[307]. The hospitals and dispensaries were fully occupied with\r\nfever, and the new House of Recovery in Pancras Road, with accommodation\r\nfor seventy patients, was soon full. At the Guardian Asylum for young\r\nwomen, more than half of the forty inmates were seized with the fever in\r\none week. The cases were on the whole milder than in ordinary years; of\r\n678 admitted to the House of Recovery in 1817, fifty died or 1 in 13·5. In\r\ntwo-thirds of these patients the fever lasted two weeks or to the\r\nbeginning of the third week; of the remaining third, a few lost the fever\r\non the 7th, 8th or 9th day, a larger number on the 12th to the 14th day,\r\nwhile a considerable number kept it to the end of the third week or\r\nbeginning of the fourth. Of the whole 678, only 75 had a free\r\nperspiration, and in only 19 of these was the perspiration critical so as\r\nto end the fever abruptly. The fever relapsed in 54 of the 678, a\r\nproportion of relapsing cases which seemed to Bateman to be “remarkably\r\ngreat[308].” In most the symptoms continued without break throughout the\r\nillness. Besides other febrile symptoms, there were pains in the limbs and\r\nback, aching of the bones, and soreness of the flesh, as if the patients\r\nhad been beaten. There was a certain proportion of severe complicated\r\ncases of typhus. Bateman held that the differences in type depended on the\r\ndifferences of constitution, giving the following reason for and\r\nillustration of his opinion:\r\n\r\n    “Thus, in the instance of a man and his wife who were brought to the\r\n    House of Recovery together, the former was affected with the mildest\r\n    symptoms of fever, which scarcely confined him to bed, and terminated\r\n    in a speedy convalescence; while his wife was lying in a state of\r\n    stupor, covered with _petechiae_ and _vibices_; in a word, exhibiting\r\n    the most formidable symptoms of the worst form of typhus. Yet these\r\n    extreme degrees of the disease manifestly originated from the same\r\n    cause; and it would be equally unphilosophical to account them\r\n    different kinds of fever and give them distinct generic appellations\r\n    as in the case of the benign and confluent smallpox, which are\r\n    generated in like manner from one contagion.” Besides this woman, only\r\n    eight others had petechiae.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons Committee were unable to find out with numerical\r\nprecision how much more prevalent the fever was in 1817-18 than in the\r\nyears preceding[309]. To their surprise they found that in six of the\r\ngeneral hospitals of London, which admitted cases of fever, “no register\r\nis kept in the hospital to distinguish the different varieties of\r\ndisease.” The apothecary of St Luke’s Workhouse told them that he\r\nattended, on an average of common years, about 150 cases of fever; in the\r\nlast year [1817] the number rose to 600; and they were assured by several\r\nbesides Bateman, that the great decrease of the deaths from “fever” in the\r\nLondon bills of mortality during a space of fourteen years at the\r\nbeginning of the century (1803-17), was not a mere apparent decrease, from\r\nthe growing inadequacy of the bills, but was a real decrease.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic which began in 1817 continued in London throughout the years\r\n1818 and 1819, chiefly in the densely populated poorer quarters of the\r\ntown. Two instances of the London slums of the time came to light before\r\nthe House of Commons Committee on Mendicity and Vagrancy in 1815-16:\r\nfirstly, Calmel’s Buildings, a small court near Portman Square, consisting\r\nof twenty-four houses, in which lived seven hundred Irish in distress and\r\nprofligacy, neglected by the parish and shunned by everyone from dread of\r\ncontagion; and, secondly, George Yard, Whitechapel, consisting of forty\r\nhouses, in which lived two thousand persons in a similar state of\r\nwretchedness. The dwellings of the poorer classes in London at this\r\nperiod, before the alleys and courts began to disappear, were described\r\nthus generally by Dr Clutterbuck[310]:\r\n\r\n    “The houses the poor occupy are often large, and every room has its\r\n    family, from the cellar to the garret. Thirty or forty individuals are\r\n    thus often collected under the same roof; the different apartments\r\n    must be approached by a common stair, which is rarely washed or\r\n    cleansed; there are often no windows or openings of any kind\r\n    backwards; and the _privies_ are not unfrequently within the walls,\r\n    and emit a loathsome stench that is diffused over the whole house. The\r\n    houses are generally situated in long and narrow alleys, with lofty\r\n    buildings on each side; or in a small and confined court, which has\r\n    but a single opening, and that perhaps a low gateway: such a court is\r\n    in fact little other than a well. These places are at the same time\r\n    the receptacles of all kinds of filth, which is only removed by the\r\n    scavenger at distant and uncertain intervals, and always so\r\n    imperfectly as to leave the place highly offensive and disgusting.”\r\n\r\nIn England, generally, this epidemic of 1817-19 is somewhat casually\r\nreported. One writes from Witney, Oxfordshire, “on the prevailing\r\nepidemic,” which began there in July, 1818, among poor persons, in\r\ncrowded, filthy and ill-ventilated situations. At first it was like the\r\nordinary contagious fever of this country, “a disease familiar to common\r\nobservation”; but afterwards it showed choleraic and pneumonic\r\ncomplications. Sometimes the parotid and submaxillary glands were\r\ninflamed; petechiae were absent[311]. The type of fever at Ipswich in the\r\nspring of 1817 was contagious (e.g. six cases in one family) and sthenic,\r\nor of strong reaction, admitting of bloodletting, according to the\r\nteaching which Armstrong, Clutterbuck and others had been reviving for\r\nfevers[312]. Those instances, one from Oxfordshire the other from Suffolk,\r\nmust stand for many. Hancock says that the fever of 1817-19 “visited\r\nalmost every town and village of the United Kingdom[313].” Prichard says\r\nthat it began in Ireland, “where the distress was most urgent, and\r\nafterwards prevailed through most parts of Britain,” some of the more\r\nopulent also being involved in the calamity. As to its prevalence in the\r\nmanufacturing towns of Yorkshire we have ample testimony. The Leeds House\r\nof Recovery, which had not been fully occupied at any time since its\r\nopening in 1804, received 178 cases in 1817, and 254 in the first ten\r\nmonths of 1818. Of the latter, 66 came from low lodging-houses, of whom\r\nupwards of 50 were strangers. Of 50 admitted in January, 1818, 20 came\r\nfrom four or five lodging-houses in March Lane, and from another locality\r\nequally bad--Boot and Shoe Yard; while the rest of the 50 in that month\r\ncame from houses and streets in the same vicinity. March Lane was one of\r\nthe worst seats of the great Leeds plague in 1645. By the month of April,\r\n1820, the epidemic had decreased a good deal in Leeds, the cases becoming\r\nat the same time more anomalous[314].\r\n\r\nThe following is one of the Rochdale cases:\r\n\r\n    June 2, 1818, Alice Eccles, a delicate young woman living in a crowded\r\n    and filthy court from which fever had not been absent for nearly a\r\n    year, was bled to ten ounces, purged, and recovered. On September 20th\r\n    the same woman returned, desiring to be bled again. She was labouring\r\n    under her former complaint; “since her last illness she had been\r\n    repeatedly exposed to contagion, or rather, she had been living in an\r\n    atmosphere thoroughly saturated with infectious effluvia, the house in\r\n    which she resided, and generally the room in which she slept, having\r\n    had one or more cases of fever in them,” and the windows kept\r\n    closed[315].\r\n\r\nAt Halifax in the summer of 1818, typhus (or relapsing fever) had\r\nincreased so much that fever-wards were added to the Dispensary. It had\r\nbeen alarmingly fatal in a high-lying village near Settle. It was\r\nprevalent in Ripon, Huddersfield and Wakefield; and had been brought from\r\nLeeds to Atley. A Bradford physician visited 27 cases of fever in one day\r\nat a neighbouring village. Throughout Yorkshire, it was confined to the\r\nlower orders, and was not very fatal[316]. At Carlisle it began about\r\nJuly, 1817, and became somewhat frequent in the winter and spring\r\nfollowing; of 457 cases treated from the Dispensary 46 died, or 1 in\r\n10[317]. At Newcastle, a mild typhus (typhus mitior) broke out in the\r\nautumn of 1816, not in the poorer quarters, but mostly among the domestics\r\nof good houses in elevated situations. There was much privation at\r\nNewcastle, as elsewhere, at this time, among the poor. Murchison takes\r\nthis fever of the autumn of 1816 at Newcastle to have been enteric or\r\ntyphoid; but it is described as a simple continued fever, with vertigo,\r\nheadache, and bloodshot eyes, lasting from five or six days to four or\r\nfive weeks, ending usually without a marked crisis, and causing few\r\ndeaths[318]. The epidemic continued in Newcastle for three years, the\r\nadmissions to the Fever Hospital from 4 Sept. 1818, to 4 March, 1819,\r\nhaving been 160, with 12 deaths. Dr McWhirter wrote, in April, 1819, that\r\nhe saw on his rounds as dispensary physician “too many of the obvious\r\ncauses of fever,” including the filth and wretchedness of the poor\r\ninhabitants: “one rather wonders that so many escape it than that some are\r\nits victims[319].”\r\n\r\nThus far there has been little besides Bateman’s essay to indicate the\r\nnature or type of the fever in England. In Ireland it was to a large\r\nextent relapsing fever, and, as we shall see, it was so also in Scotland.\r\nBateman found less than a tenth part of the cases at the London Fever\r\nHospital to have relapses, which was an unusually large proportion, in his\r\nexperience. Elsewhere in England the tendency to relapse was either\r\nwanting or the relapses were described or accounted for in other ways; to\r\nunderstand this it has to be kept in mind that the epidemic was the\r\noccasion of a great revival of blood-letting, a practice which had fallen\r\ninto disuse in fevers since the last half of the 18th century, and was\r\nsomething of a novelty in 1817. The fever of that year was undoubtedly\r\nabrupt in its onset, strong, “inflammatory,” with full bounding pulse,\r\nbeating carotids, hot and dry skin, intense headache, suffused eyes, and\r\nthe like symptoms, which seemed to call for depletion. The common practice\r\nwas to bleed _ad deliquium_, which meant to ten, or fourteen, or twenty\r\nounces, at the outset of the fever. There was hardly one of the writers\r\nupon the epidemic, unless it were Bateman, an advocate of the cordial and\r\nsupporting regimen, who did not consider the stages or duration of the\r\nfever as artificially determined by the blood-letting, and not as\r\nbelonging to the natural history.\r\n\r\nIn order to show how much the treatment by blood-letting dominated the\r\nview of the fever itself, of its type, its stages, or duration, I shall\r\ntake the Bristol essay of Prichard, who adopted phlebotomy, as he says, at\r\nfirst tentatively and with some fear and trembling, but at length\r\npractised it vigorously, having found it to answer well[320]. The epidemic\r\nof fever in Bristol began about June, 1817, and lasted fully two years.\r\nThe first cases brought to St Peter’s Hospital, which was the general\r\nworkhouse of the city, were of wretched vagrants found ill by the wayside\r\nor abandoned in hovels. About the same time forty-two felons in the\r\nBristol Newgate, “one of the most loathsome dungeons in Britain, perhaps I\r\nmight say in Europe,” were infected, of whom only one died, and he of a\r\nrelapse. From June, 1817, to the end of 1819, there were 591 cases in the\r\npoor’s house, 647 in the General Infirmary, and 975 treated from the\r\nDispensary, making 2213 cases, of which a record was kept. But there were\r\nalso many cases in private practice among the domestics, children, and\r\nothers in good houses, such as those on Redcliff Hill. The cases in the\r\npoor’s house were classified by Prichard as follows:\r\n\r\n                                     1817  1818  1819\r\n\r\n  Simple Fever                        22    45    40\r\n    with cephalic symptoms            24    27    25\r\n      \"  pneumonic symptoms            7    10    16\r\n      \"  gastric symptoms              3    11     5\r\n      \"  enteric symptoms              3     4     5\r\n      \"  hepatic symptoms              5     3     3\r\n         exhausted and moribund        1     6     4\r\n         not characterised            30    44     2\r\n                                     ---   ---    --\r\n                                      95   150   105\r\n                                     ---------------\r\n        Of these there died           20    16    11\r\n\r\nThe “genuine form,” or ground-type, according to Prichard, was “simple\r\nfever,” of which the cases with cephalic symptoms were merely the more\r\nprotracted or more serious. “The pneumonic, hepatic, gastric, enteric and\r\nrheumatic forms may be regarded as varieties”--the gastric and hepatic\r\nbeing cases mostly in summer with jaundice, the enteric in autumn and\r\nwinter with diarrhoea and dysentery. Nearly all these patients were bled\r\nwithin four or five days from the commencement of the disease: “in a very\r\nlarge proportion of the cases the fever was immediately cut short”; when\r\nit did not end thus abruptly, its symptoms declined gradually, and the\r\nattack was over within eight or ten days. After the blooding “sleep very\r\nfrequently followed, and a partial or sometimes a complete remission of\r\nthe symptoms.” Only one case of relapse is mentioned, No. 118, of the year\r\n1818, and that was a relapse in a very prolonged case: the patient was\r\nadmitted on 6 October, had a relapse on 18 November, and was discharged on\r\n23 December. Prichard has not one word in his text to suggest relapsing\r\nfever; the bulk of his cases were simple continued fever, with or without\r\ncephalic or other local symptoms, ending in four, six, eight or ten days,\r\nwhile some were cases of _typhus gravior_. The fever was undoubtedly\r\ncontagious: it spread through whole families, and in St Peter’s Hospital\r\nitself it attacked seventy of the ordinary pauper inmates, including a\r\ngood many lunatics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Epidemic of 1817-19 in Scotland: Relapsing Fever.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the epidemic in Scotland, where the relapsing type was\r\nas marked as in Ireland, if not more so. The destitution in the Scots\r\ntowns in the autumn of 1816, and following years, was fully as great as\r\nanywhere in the kingdom, although the peasantry of Scotland were not\r\nfamine-stricken, as those of Ireland were. The state of the poorer classes\r\nin Edinburgh was graphically set forth in an essay by Dr Yule, in\r\n1818[321], and in an article in _Blackwood’s Magazine_ the year after.\r\nVigorous efforts to relieve the distress were made by the richer classes,\r\nand a special fever-hospital was opened at Queensbery House, the\r\nadmissions to which, together with the fever-cases at the Royal Infirmary,\r\nwere as follows:[322]\r\n\r\n  Year   Admitted   Died   Ratio of deaths\r\n\r\n  1817     511       33     1 in 15-16/33\r\n  1818    1572       75     1 in 21\r\n  1819    1027       30     1 in 34\r\n  (to 1 Dec.)\r\n\r\nOf this epidemic several accounts were published at the time, including\r\none by Welsh, superintendent of the fever hospital, which is dominated,\r\nlike the Bristol account of Prichard, by the idea that blood-letting cut\r\nshort the fever[323]. Christison, who had experience of the relapsing\r\nform in his own person[324], describes also two other forms mixed with the\r\ncases of relapsing fever: a mild typhus, the _typhus mitior_ (_typhus\r\ngravior_ being exceedingly rare in that epidemic), and a form which began\r\nlike the inflammatory relapsing _synocha_, and gradually after a week put\r\non the characters of mild typhus.\r\n\r\nThe admissions for fever to the Glasgow Infirmary, which was then the only\r\ncharity that received fever cases, had been at a somewhat low level since\r\nthe last epidemic in 1799-1801. They began to rise again with the distress\r\nof 1816:--\r\n\r\n_Admissions for Fever, Glasgow Infirmary._\r\n\r\n  Year   Cases\r\n\r\n  1814    90\r\n  1815   230\r\n  1816   399\r\n  1817   714\r\n  1818  1371\r\n  1819   630\r\n  1820   289\r\n  1821   234\r\n  1822   229\r\n  1823   269\r\n\r\nAt the height of the epidemic in 1818 an additional fever hospital was\r\nopened at Spring Gardens, to which 1929 cases were admitted in that and\r\nthe following year. Great efforts were made in Glasgow to “stamp out” the\r\ncontagion by disinfectants and removal to hospital[325]; but the course of\r\nthe epidemic seemed to follow the economic conditions more than anything\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak at Aberdeen was later than in the south of Scotland, having\r\nbegun in August, 1818. The infection was said to have been brought to the\r\ncity by a woman who found a lodging in Sinclair’s Close. A group of houses\r\nin the close, covering an area of seventy by fifty feet and containing\r\none hundred and three inmates, became the first centre of the fever. The\r\nscenes described are like those of the Irish epidemics: in one room, a\r\nman, his wife, and five children were lying ill on the floor; in another,\r\na man, his wife and six children; in a third, a young girl, whose mother\r\nhad just died of fever, was left with three infant brothers or sisters.\r\nMore than three-fourths of the denizens of the close were “confined to bed\r\nin fever, and all the others crawling about during the intervals of their\r\nrelapses.” The value of all the furniture and clothing belonging to 103\r\npersons could little exceed £5. There was a horrible stench both within\r\nand without the houses (relapsing fever being remarkable for its odour).\r\nYet this close was usually as healthy as any other part of the town. A\r\nHouse of Recovery, with sixty beds, was opened in the Gallowgate, and\r\nthirty beds were given up to fever-cases in the Infirmary of the city.\r\nBesides those ninety hospital cases at the date of 17 December, 1818, it\r\nwas estimated that were three hundred more. Begging had been put down, so\r\nthat the contagion had not spread to the richer classes. Despite these\r\nremovals to hospital, the epidemic became more general about the New Year,\r\n1819, and of a worse type; two physicians died of it, and some others had\r\na narrow escape. At the outset, the fever had been of the relapsing\r\nkind--“subject to relapses for a third and fourth time, more especially\r\nwhen they return too early to their usual labour[326].” At a later period\r\nthe epidemic seems to have become ordinary typhus, as it did also in\r\nIreland and elsewhere; and it was called typhus in the essay upon it by Dr\r\nGeorge Kerr[327].\r\n\r\nThe extent of this epidemic of 1818-19 over Scotland generally is not\r\nknown; but the following notice of it in a country parish of Forfarshire\r\nwas probably a sample of more that might have been given.\r\n\r\n    Early in the summer of 1818 an epidemic of continued fever appeared in\r\n    a manufacturing village seven miles from Lintrathen; it attacked at\r\n    first young and plethoric subjects, and ran through whole families. In\r\n    August it reached Lintrathen parish, in which one practitioner had\r\n    forty cases, with no deaths. The fever was of an inflammatory nature;\r\n    the bulk of the cases fell in October, and were nearly all of young\r\n    women. They were bled to syncope, which then meant usually to 32\r\n    ounces. There was a prejudice against blooding among the old people,\r\n    who said “they had had many fevers, and in their time no such thing\r\n    was ever allowed.” But, according to the doctor, this withholding of\r\n    the lancet had the effect of protracting their illnesses: “they\r\n    toasted sick for six weeks, and were often confined to bed for\r\n    months[328].”\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of 1817-19 brought into prominence two questions, the one\r\ntheoretical, the other practical. The theoretical question (not debated at\r\nthe time) was touching the place or affinities of relapsing fever in the\r\nnosology. Christison maintained that it was the inflammatory fever, or\r\n_synocha_ of Cullen, showing a peculiar tendency to relapse. The fever of\r\nthe same epidemic period in England was also undoubtedly a fever of strong\r\nor inflammatory reaction, corresponding to Cullen’s definition of\r\n_synocha_, but it relapsed much less frequently than in Ireland and\r\nScotland in the same years. Even in Ireland and Scotland there were always\r\nmany cases of “relapsing fever” which did not relapse. The law of its\r\nrelapses was reduced to great simplicity by a physician learned in fevers,\r\nDr John O’Brien, in the Dublin epidemic of 1827. The bulk of that epidemic\r\nwas a fever of short periods--three, five, seven or nine days, most of the\r\nattacks ending on the fifth or seventh night of the fever. The attack\r\nbeing ended in a free perspiration, there might or might not happen, after\r\nan interval, a relapse, and again a relapse after that, or even a third.\r\nThe five-days’ fever was more liable to relapse than the seven-days’\r\nfever, the seven-days’ fever more liable than the nine-days’ fever, the\r\nfevers of the longest periods not liable at all. In other words, the\r\nsooner the patient “got the cool,” by a night’s sweating, the more liable\r\nhe was to have one or more relapses[329].\r\n\r\nThe logical position of relapsing fever was completed by Dr Seaton Reid,\r\nof Belfast, when he proposed, in his account of the epidemic in 1846-7, to\r\ncall it Relapsing Synocha[330]. Other fevers have shown a tendency to\r\nrelapse in certain circumstances. Three fevers which have many points in\r\ncommon, the sweating sickness, dengue and influenza, are all subject to\r\nrelapses. It was doubtless of the sweating sickness that Sir Thomas More\r\nwas thinking when he wrote: “Considering there is, as physicians say, and\r\nas we also find, double the peril in the relapse that was in the first\r\nsickness.” Plague, also, might relapse, or recur in an individual once,\r\ntwice, three times, or oftener in the same epidemic season. Enteric is an\r\ninstance of a long-period fever which has at times a tendency to\r\nrelapses[331]. None of these, however, can dispute the claim of relapsing\r\nsynocha to be relapsing fever _par excellence_. For whatever reason, the\r\nshort-period fever of times of distress and dearth or famine has shown a\r\npeculiar tendency to relapse, and has shown that tendency more in the 19th\r\ncentury than in the 18th, and more among the Irish and Scotch poor than\r\namong the English.\r\n\r\nThe practical question that came to the front in the epidemic fever of\r\n1817-19 was that of isolation hospitals for the sick. It was thus stated\r\nby Dr Millar, of Glasgow, in a letter of advice to the authorities of\r\nAberdeen:\r\n\r\n    “It is only by a universal, or nearly universal sweep of the sick into\r\n    Fever Hospitals, joined to a universal or nearly universal\r\n    purification of their dwellings, that anything is to be hoped for in\r\n    the way of suppressing our epidemic. So far as this grand object is\r\n    concerned, all the rest is folly: it is worse than folly[332].”\r\n\r\nThis was the well-meant but somewhat fanatical application of a trite and\r\ncommonplace notion. It was well understood by reflective persons at that\r\ntime, who were quite sound on the contagiousness of fever, that the whole\r\nquestion of segregating the poor in fever hospitals was beset with\r\ndifficulties, not merely of expense but also of expediency. A Select\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons sat upon it in 1818, and published their\r\nreport, with the minutes of evidence, on the 20th May. So much had been\r\nsaid in Parliament by Peel and others, and said so truly, of the spreading\r\nof fever all over Ireland by whole families turned adrift in beggary, that\r\nthe Select Committee were full of ideas of contagion, and of the great\r\nopportunity of suppressing fever by destroying its germs or seeds. But\r\nthey had soon occasion to learn that a fever may be potentially\r\ncontagious, yet not contagious in all circumstances, and that segregation\r\nin fever hospitals had a rival in dispersion through general hospitals.\r\nHalf-a-dozen London physicians of position, answering respectively for\r\nGuy’s, St Thomas’s, the London, St Bartholomew’s, St George’s, the\r\nWestminster and the Middlesex Hospitals, declared that they mixed their\r\ncases of contagious fever in the ordinary wards among the other patients;\r\nand when asked by the astonished Committee whether the fever did not\r\nspread, they answered one after another with singular unanimity, “Never,”\r\nwhich under cross-examination, became in one or two instances, “hardly\r\never,” as, for example, in the evidence for St Thomas’s Hospital, where a\r\nsister and a nurse had caught fever and died. The point of this London\r\nevidence was that the great safeguard against febrile contagion was free\r\ndilution with air, and that the great provocation of a contagious\r\nprinciple was to “concentrate” the cases of fever[333]. The Bristol\r\nexperience in the same epidemic, although it did not come before the\r\nSelect Committee, was wholly in agreement with medical opinion in London.\r\nThe fever-cases there were received either into St Peter’s Hospital, which\r\nwas the city poor-house, or into the General Infirmary. The former was an\r\nold irregular building, badly ventilated, in which the contagion spread\r\nfreely to the ordinary inmates and became very virulent. Contrasting with\r\nthe apartments of the old poor’s house, the wards of the Bristol General\r\nInfirmary were spacious, lofty, well-ventilated:\r\n\r\n    “Here the patients labouring under fever were dispersed among invalids\r\n    of almost every other description; so that, whatever effluvia emanated\r\n    from infected bodies became immediately diluted in the mass of air\r\n    free from such pollution. Here, accordingly, no instance occurred of\r\n    the propagation of fever. None of the nurses were attacked, nor were\r\n    patients lying in the adjacent beds in any instance infected, though\r\n    cases of the worst description, some of them exhibiting all the\r\n    symptoms of typhus gravior, were placed promiscuously among the other\r\n    patients, scarcely two feet of space intervening between the\r\n    beds[334].”\r\n\r\nThe same practice was kept up in the Edinburgh Infirmary until 1858 or\r\nlonger; Christison, who gives a diagram of an ordinary ward with four\r\nfever-beds in it, declared in 1850 that there had been no spread of fever\r\nfor fifteen years before, except on one occasion, when the rules of the\r\nhouse were neglected[335]. The bold policy of dispersing fever-patients\r\namong the healthy was begun by Pringle and Donald Monro during the\r\ncampaigns of 1742-48 and 1761-63 in the Netherlands and North Germany.\r\nThey found that concentration raised the contagion to high degrees of\r\nvirulence and that dispersion weakened it to the point of non-existence,\r\nMonro’s success at Paderborn in 1761 having been of the most signal\r\nkind[336].\r\n\r\nThe Select Committee of 1818 were more influenced by what they were told\r\nof the good effects of the earliest Houses of Recovery, at Waterford,\r\nManchester and other places in the end of the last century. For several\r\nyears after their opening they were little needed, the epidemic which gave\r\nthe immediate impulse to their establishment having subsided in due time\r\nboth in the towns provided with Houses of Recovery and in the innumerable\r\nplaces where no such provision had been made. The recommendations of the\r\nCommittee do not appear to have been carried out; for the London Fever\r\nHospital, in Pancras Road, which had been enlarged to seventy beds when\r\nthe epidemic began in 1817, remained the only special fever hospital in\r\nLondon until the establishment of the hospitals of the Metropolitan\r\nAsylums Board in 1870[337].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe confusion of commerce, depression of trade and lack of employment\r\nwhich followed the Peace of Paris, and gave occasion to the British and\r\nIrish epidemic fevers of 1817-19, gradually righted themselves. The price\r\nof wheat, which would have been still higher after the four-months drought\r\nof 1818, but for large imports, gradually fell, and was about 50_s._ in\r\n1821, and 40_s._ in the winter of 1822-23. After that, it rose somewhat\r\nagain, and the third decade of the century, in the middle of which\r\noccurred the great speculative crash of 1825, was on the whole a hard time\r\nfor the working classes. The history of fever has few illustrations\r\nbetween the epidemic of 1817-19 and that of 1826-27, excepting the great\r\nfamine-fever of Connemara and other parts of the West of Ireland in 1822,\r\nelsewhere described, which coincided with a somewhat prosperous time in\r\nEngland and called forth a princely charity[338].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Relapsing Fever of 1827-28.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of relapsing fever which was at a height in Dublin in 1826,\r\ndid not culminate in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and other towns of Scotland until\r\n1828. It was a somewhat close repetition of the epidemic of 1817-19,\r\nexcept that it was chiefly an affair of the towns, owing to depression of\r\ntrade and want of work following the great crash of commercial credit in\r\n1825-26. In Glasgow, the admissions for fever to the Royal Infirmary began\r\nto rise in 1825[339]:\r\n\r\n_Glasgow: Admissions for Fever._\r\n\r\n  Year\r\n\r\n  1824    523\r\n  1825    897\r\n  1826    926\r\n  1827   1084[340]\r\n  1828   1511[340]\r\n  1829    865\r\n  1830    729\r\n\r\nAt Edinburgh the cases of fever treated in hospital were fewer in ordinary\r\nyears than at Glasgow, but they rose to a higher point in the epidemic\r\nyears[341]:\r\n\r\n_Edinburgh: Admissions for Fever._\r\n\r\n  Year\r\n\r\n  1824                   177\r\n  1825                   341\r\n  1826 (nine months)     456\r\n  1827                  1875\r\n  1828                  2013\r\n  1829                   771\r\n  1830                   346\r\n\r\nChristison gives the following account of the epidemic in Edinburgh in\r\n1827-28:\r\n\r\n    “Like that of 1817-19, it arose in Edinburgh during a protracted\r\n    period of want of work and low wages among the labouring classes and\r\n    tradespeople; it prevailed only among the working classes and\r\n    unemployed poor--in the Fountainbridge and West Port districts, the\r\n    Grassmarket ‘closes,’ the Cowgate and the narrow ‘wynds’ descending on\r\n    either side of the long sloping back of the High Street and\r\n    Canongate.” The fever had the same three types as in 1817-19--many\r\n    cases of inflammatory, or relapsing, or synocha, a few of low fever\r\n    (typhus), and some between the two--militant or inflammatory for a\r\n    week, then becoming low, and running the continuous course of\r\n    typhus.... “The inflammatory fever presented the same extreme violence\r\n    of reaction as in the former epidemic--the same tendency to abrupt\r\n    cessation, with profuse sweating--the same liability to return\r\n    abruptly a few days afterwards--and the same disposition to depart\r\n    finally in a few days more, and again abruptly with free perspiration.\r\n    The cases of typhus were more frequently severe than in 1818-19.\r\n    Icteric synocha occurred also oftener, although far from\r\n    frequently[342].”\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of relapsing fever in 1826-28, which made a great impression\r\nin the towns of Ireland and Scotland, has left few traces in specially\r\nEnglish records. But it is clear that there was some increase of fever\r\nabout the same time in London; and it becomes a matter of interest, as\r\nwell as of no little difficulty, to ascertain the type or types of the\r\nsame. It was just after this quasi-epidemic in London that Dr Burne\r\npublished his essay on fevers, the preface bearing the date of 28th\r\nFebruary, 1828[343]. The materials of this essay came from Guy’s Hospital,\r\nand they were both clinical and anatomical. The author seeks to find a\r\ncommon name for all varieties of continued fever, the name that he chooses\r\nbeing “Adynamic Fever.” “By far the greater number of cases,” he says,\r\n“are of the first or second degree only of severity, and not dangerous.”\r\nThese were cases of “simple continued fever,” or fever of short duration,\r\nwith flushed face, suffused eyes and other signs of the “inflammatory”\r\ntype, or of synocha. Although Burne does not give the exact proportion of\r\ncases with relapse, as Bateman had done for the London epidemic of\r\n1817-18, yet he makes it clear that relapses did occur, and he discusses\r\nthe phenomenon in a manner which makes his testimony interesting:\r\n“Convalescents are more liable to a relapse after the adynamic fever than\r\nafter any other disease; and this may be accounted for by the very\r\nenfeebled and exhausted state in which the powers of the system are\r\nleft.” His relapses were obviously a return of the original fever,\r\nbeginning again suddenly in the midst of convalescence with flushing of\r\nthe face, headache, dry tongue, and scanty urine, and with a great access\r\nof febrile heat in the night, a disturbance of the system which generally\r\ncontinued for several days, while in some it went off sooner with a\r\ndiarrhoea. He assigned three principal causes for the relapse--overloading\r\nthe enfeebled but craving stomach, walking out in the open air too soon,\r\nand giving way to emotion[344].\r\n\r\nThe references to relapse apply almost certainly to fevers of the shorter\r\nperiods (synocha or “inflammatory” fever), and not to those cases of\r\nenteric fever which did undoubtedly occur in the practice of Guy’s\r\nHospital in the same seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nTyphoid or Enteric Fever in London, 1826.\r\n\r\nThe identification of enteric fever and relapsing fever respectively, or\r\nthe separation of each from typhus, became actual in Britain at one and\r\nthe same time. I have already said all that seems necessary as to the\r\nearlier appearances of relapsing fever on the stage of epidemiological\r\nhistory. This will be the fitting point in the chronology, the third\r\ndecade of the 19th century, to bring in the question of enteric or typhoid\r\nfever. As to its identification, or recognition as a distinct species,\r\nthat was not really completed, to the satisfaction of everyone, until the\r\nelaborate analysis of the symptoms respectively of typhus and enteric\r\nfevers by Sir William Jenner in 1849-51[345]. But, for ten years before\r\nthat, the co-existence with maculated typhus of a different long-period\r\nfever, having abdominal symptoms and abdominal lesion, had been\r\nrecognised, and the characteristic ulceration or sloughing of the\r\nlymph-follicles of the ileum, with sphacelation of the mesenteric\r\nlymph-glands, had been clearly described by several London physicians and\r\ndepicted in coloured plates, in the years 1826 and 1827, during an unusual\r\nprevalence of such cases in London. The authentic history of enteric fever\r\nin Britain really begins with these writings by physicians of St George’s\r\nand Guy’s Hospitals. But, as it is improbable that the type of fever was\r\nabsolutely new in the years 1825 and 1826, it may be asked whether the\r\nenteric type cannot be discovered in the old accounts of British fevers,\r\nand if so, whether we may assume in the past as much enteric fever\r\nrelatively to spotted typhus, relapsing fever, or simple continued fever,\r\nas in the period after 1850.\r\n\r\nHaving adverted to this point from time to time in the preceding history\r\nas it arose, for example in connexion with Willis’s fever of 1661,\r\nStrother’s fever of 1727-29, the Rouen fever of 1750, and other instances\r\nboth in children (remittent or convulsive or comatose fever of children)\r\nand in adults, I shall not recapitulate farther back than the beginning of\r\nthe 19th century.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain amount of post-mortem observation in the 18th century,\r\nespecially in camp sicknesses, by Pringle and others; but there is no\r\ntrace of intestinal ulceration among their fatal fevers. It was found,\r\nhowever, in the epidemic of 1806 among the troops at Deal, and it is\r\nprobable that Ferriar’s cases at Manchester about 1804, and Bateman’s\r\ncases of continued fever in London from 1804 to 1816, were in some part\r\nenteric, although the anatomical test is wanting. That was a period when\r\nthere was singularly little of the old London fever in the houses of the\r\npoorer class. Then came the remarkable “constitution” of relapsing or\r\nsimple continued fever, from about 1816 to 1828, the relapsing character\r\nof which was far more obvious in Ireland and Scotland, than in London,\r\nBristol, or elsewhere in England, but was not altogether unobserved in\r\nLondon, whether in 1817-19 or in 1827-28. The relapsing type disappeared\r\nafter that for fifteen or twenty years, and was replaced by typhus more\r\nmaculated than had been seen for many years. But, before the relapsing or\r\nsimple continued fever disappeared for a time, enteric fever was seen in\r\nLondon in company with it.\r\n\r\nThe chief season of enteric fever in London was the autumn of 1826,\r\nfollowing a long period of great drought and heat. The remarkable weather\r\nof that season was the same in England, Ireland and Scotland, and is thus\r\ndescribed for the last by Christison:\r\n\r\n    “The spring and summer seasons of that year were remarkable for the\r\n    extraordinary drought and heat which prevailed for many continuous\r\n    months. No such seasons could be recollected by anybody, and assuredly\r\n    there has been nothing similar in this country since.... The fine\r\n    weather set in with the beginning of March, and continued, with\r\n    scarcely a check, well into the autumn.... The drought prevailed and\r\n    the heat increased till the middle of June, when a thunderstorm with\r\n    heavy rain cooled the air for a day or two. But the heat then became\r\n    greater than ever, and there was continuous sunshine and no rain till\r\n    after the middle of July, when again there was thunder and rain, after\r\n    which sun, heat and drought ruled the season once more.” The shade\r\n    temperature at Edinburgh was 84° Fahr., at 3 p.m. on three successive\r\n    days of July[346]. The two summers preceding had also been\r\n    exceptional, that of 1824 having been hot and moist, that of 1825 hot\r\n    and dry, with dysentery in Dublin.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1826, Dr Cornwallis Hewett, of St George’s Hospital, published\r\nten fatal cases of enteric fever, four of which had occurred in his own\r\npractice, six in the practice of his colleagues[347]. The first was\r\nadmitted on 23 April, 1825, the latest on 3 July, 1826. While his paper\r\nwas under hand, he had read in the _Medico-chirurgical Review_ for July,\r\n1826, some extracts from Bretonneau’s paper on “Dothiénentérite” (enteric\r\nfever), and he pronounced the London cases to be the same as those\r\nrecently observed at Tours. Several other cases occurred at St George’s\r\nHospital in the autumn of 1826, three of them reported by Dr\r\nChambers[348]. At the very same time, there was a run of enteric cases at\r\nGuy’s Hospital. Dr Bright says: “Fever occurred with considerable\r\nfrequency among the patients who presented themselves for admission into\r\nGuy’s Hospital, during the months of October, November and December, 1826.\r\nOn the whole, the disease was not severe.” The more comprehensive account\r\nof these cases was given by Burne, early in 1828, from which it appears\r\nthat the bulk of them were fevers of the shorter period, that there were\r\nrelapsing cases among them, and that some were cases of enteric fever,\r\nverified by post-mortem examination[349]. It was the enteric cases that\r\nattracted the notice of Dr Bright, who says nothing of the relapsing\r\ncases, or of cases of simple continued fever. The fact that the intestinal\r\nmucous membrane may become diseased during fever was, he says, “long known\r\nin particular cases, but never suspected to be so general till brought\r\ninto view by the French physicians, and which has lately been illustrated\r\nin this country with great beauty [this does not mean in plates] by the\r\npens of my able and assiduous friends Dr Chambers and Dr Hewett.” He gives\r\nten fatal cases, with coloured plates of the intestinal or mesenteric\r\nlesion in some of them, the earliest coloured plate having been made from\r\na case admitted on 13 October, 1825, and the most typical plate of the\r\nsloughing Peyer’s follicles from a case admitted on 25 November, 1826. He\r\ngives also eleven cases of recovery, to show the benefit of treating the\r\ndiarrhoea by calomel[350]. Nearly all the cases occurred in the end of the\r\nyear, either of 1825 or 1826; and Burne confirms this when he says that\r\nthe cases with enteric lesion were found at Guy’s Hospital only in autumn.\r\nSome two years after, in 1830, Drs Tweedie and Southwood Smith, physicians\r\nto the London Fever Hospital, described cases of fever with ulcerated\r\nintestine and sphacelated mesenteric glands. After that, the interest\r\nshifted to typhus, which reappeared in London of an unusually maculated\r\ntype; so that the years 1826-30 make a somewhat distinct period in which\r\nthe new fever, with enteric lesion, was an engrossing medical topic. It is\r\ntolerably certain that it was the unusual seasons of 1825 and 1826 which\r\nbrought enteric fever into prominence; while, as soon as it became\r\nfrequent, it could hardly have escaped the systematic apparatus of\r\nclinical case-taking and post-mortem examination, with preservation and\r\ndrawing of specimens, for which Guy’s Hospital was already noted under the\r\ninfluence of Bright and his colleagues, and in which the staff of St\r\nGeorge’s Hospital would appear to have been not less competent. Although\r\nDr Hewett, in 1826, identified his cases with the _dothiénentérite_ of\r\nBretonneau, yet neither he nor Dr Bright took the abdominal ulcerations or\r\nsloughs as distinctive of a new kind of fever. They regarded them rather\r\nas a new complication of “idiopathic” typhus fever, a “complication” which\r\nappealed to them more on the side of treatment than of systematic\r\nnosology; hence the writings of both physicians are occupied mainly with\r\nthe benefit of calomel in relieving the congestion of the bowels and in\r\nchecking the diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubted that cases of enteric fever in 1826-27 were relatively\r\nmore numerous in London than in Dublin and Edinburgh, where the epidemic\r\nfever was almost wholly of the relapsing type. In Edinburgh, at least, the\r\ncomparative infrequency of enteric fever for years after it had been\r\nrecognized in Paris, Tours and other French cities, and had been found in\r\nLondon as a common autumnal type, can be proved beyond cavil. Writing long\r\nafter of the first epidemic of relapsing fever in Edinburgh, Christison\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    “Of enteric typhus (typhoid fever) we saw nothing then [1817-20], nor\r\n    for many years afterwards. If it might have been overlooked during\r\n    life, it could not have been missed after death. For our dissections\r\n    were many, and, to meet the bias of the day for finding a local\r\n    anatomical cause for all fevers [the doctrine of Broussais], every\r\n    important organ in the body was habitually looked to. Nevertheless we\r\n    were constantly met with the want of morbid appearances anywhere,\r\n    unless slight signs of vascular congestion in various membranous\r\n    textures be considered such[351].”\r\n\r\nThese vascular congestions were, indeed, scanned closely for traces of\r\nulceration, after Bright’s plates of 1828, and any little irregularity on\r\nthe surface of a congested Peyer’s patch was liberally construed in that\r\nsense, as in Craigie’s reports subsequently. But in the Edinburgh epidemic\r\nof 1827-29, the anatomical signs of enteric fever were wanting until the\r\nend of it. Writing in 1827, Alison said that he had dissected 26 cases\r\ndead of the epidemic fever, without finding intestinal ulceration in one\r\nof them. Christison, however, says that a very few cases of enteric fever\r\nwere dissected in Edinburgh in 1829[352].\r\n\r\nIn Dublin, also, the anatomical mark of enteric fever was missed in\r\n1826-27, in the few dissections that were made during the epidemic[353].\r\nAn opinion in a widely different sense was given on that point by Stokes\r\ntwelve years after the event, to which I refer in a note[354].\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn of Spotted Typhus after 1831: “Change of Type.” Distress of the\r\nWorking Class.\r\n\r\nA fever with relapses, and a fever with sloughing of the follicles and\r\nlymph glands of the intestine, were not the only novelties in the first\r\nthirty or forty years of the 19th century. Relapsing fever and enteric or\r\ntyphoid fever were each clearly separated, at a later date, from typhus\r\nfever. But what was the “typhus fever” from which they were at length\r\nseparated? It was a fever which came prominently into notice after the\r\n“constitution” of 1826-29 was ended--a fever with a mottled, measly, or\r\nrubeoloid rash, and with various other spots, on account of which it was\r\ndescribed by Dr Roupell in 1831, in a lecture before the College of\r\nPhysicians of London, as a “new fever[355].” It was a new fever only in\r\nthe sense in which each new febrile “constitution,” whether it were an\r\ninfluenza, an epidemic ague, or a malignant typhus, was apt to be called\r\npopularly “the new fever,” in the 16th and 17th centuries. There were, of\r\ncourse, erudite men at the College of Physicians in 1831 who knew that a\r\nfever with a mottled rash, with vibices and petechiae, and with all other\r\nsymptoms of typhus gravior, had often occurred in England, Scotland and\r\nIreland in former times. The “spotted fever” was perhaps the most familiar\r\nname of typhus in the 17th century. The mottled rash, like that of\r\nmeasles, was described for the fever of Cork by Rogers in the beginning of\r\nthe 18th century, and for various other English and Irish epidemics by\r\nHuxham, O’Connell, Rutty and others. But undoubtedly the maculated typhus\r\nwas somewhat new to the generation who saw it about 1830 and following\r\nyears, the continued fevers which had prevailed in England, Scotland and\r\nIreland since 1816 having been for the most part the simple continued, or\r\nsynocha, with or without the relapsing character, and to some extent\r\nenteric fever[356].\r\n\r\nIt was from 1830 to 1834 that a change in the reigning type of fever began\r\nto be remarked in London, Dublin, Edinburgh and Glasgow, the new type\r\nbecoming more and more evident as fevers became more prevalent in the\r\n‘thirties’ and ‘forties.’ Typhus at length became so much a spotted fever\r\nthat the question arose whether it should not be classed among the\r\nexanthemata. In 1840, Dr Charles West, having observed “the alteration in\r\ncharacter which fever has undergone within the last few years,” went over\r\nthe history (but more the foreign than the English) with a view “to\r\nillustrate the question whether typhus ought not to be classed among the\r\nexanthematous fevers[357]:” of course he found many old descriptions of a\r\nmottled rash or other spots, but saw no reason to make spotted typhus one\r\nof the exanthemata. Dr Kilgour, of Aberdeen, who treated more than a\r\nthousand cases in his fever-ward at the infirmary there from 1838 to 1840,\r\nwrote in 1841, “I am perfectly satisfied that this fever, call it by what\r\nname we will, is truly an exanthematous fever[358].” Previous to 1835, the\r\nspots of fever-cases in the Glasgow Infirmary had hardly been remarked;\r\nbut after that date all cases were classed either as spotted or not, the\r\nspotted cases being three-fourths of the whole. Besides being spotted, the\r\nfever of the new constitution was insidious in its approach and low in its\r\nreaction, very unlike the sthenic, militant, inflammatory synocha of the\r\ngeneration before. The blood-letting which had been all but universally\r\nused in the fever from 1816 to 1828, and had seemed to answer well, was\r\ncontinued for a time in the fever of the ‘thirties.’ But it was soon found\r\nto be injurious: the patients in the new fever were apt to faint when only\r\na few ounces of blood (four or six) had been drawn, whereas in the other\r\nfever (whether relapsing or simple continued) they had often lost thirty\r\nounces before deliquium was reached. It was found, on the other hand, that\r\nfever-cases in the ‘thirties’ needed wine and other cordial regimen. There\r\nwas nothing new in these revolutions, whether of the fevers themselves, or\r\nof the opinions as to their treatment. Sydenham’s method of taking his cue\r\nfor treatment from the “constitution” of the season, which was the method\r\nof Hippocrates, appeared to be once more the best suited to the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to make out what were the circumstances of the time that\r\nled to the supersession of simple continued fever (or relapsing fever in\r\nIreland and Scotland), by spotted fever or typhus gravior in all parts of\r\nthe kingdom. Sydenham would have looked, among other things, to the\r\nweather and the character of seasons; but from 1830 onwards there was no\r\nseason so notable as the dry and hot summer of 1826, although the end of\r\nthe year 1836 was remarkably wet. The period of typhus gravior was a time\r\nof much sickness of other kinds--the Asiatic cholera of 1831-32, the\r\ninfluenza of 1831, 1833, and 1836-37, and the general unhealthiness of the\r\nyear 1837. This was also the decade when the “condition-of-England\r\nquestion” was a common topic, a time of strikes and of much distress among\r\nthe working classes, as shown in the reports of the Poor Law Commission.\r\n\r\nIn Glasgow there was a considerable prevalence of fevers year after year\r\nfrom the relapsing-fever epidemic of 1827-29, according to the following\r\ntable of admissions for fever to the Royal Infirmary and the special\r\nfever-hospitals[359]:\r\n\r\n_Admissions for Fever, Glasgow._\r\n\r\n  Year   Fever cases\r\n\r\n  1827    1084\r\n  1828    1511\r\n  1829     865\r\n  1830     729\r\n  1831    1657\r\n  1832   {1589\r\n         {1148[360]\r\n  1833    1288\r\n  1834    2003\r\n  1835    1359\r\n  1836    3125\r\n  1837    5387[361]\r\n  1838    2047\r\n  1839    1529\r\n\r\nThe worst year of the series for fever was 1837, and the worst month of\r\nthat year was May, when the fever-deaths were 1 in 3·22 of the mortality\r\nfrom all causes. That great access of fever in Glasgow followed\r\nimmediately upon the great strike of the cotton-spinners, on 8th April,\r\n1837, by which eight thousand persons, mostly women, were thrown out of\r\nwork[362]. The death-rate in Glasgow was in those years as high as\r\nanywhere in the kingdom, and was higher in the nine years from 1831 than\r\nin the nine years preceding. The population of Glasgow, says Cowan, had\r\nincreased on the industrial side, out of proportion to its middle and\r\nwealthiest class[363]; and to that he would attribute the higher\r\ndeath-rates in the second period (right-hand side), of the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n_Glasgow Death-rates._\r\n\r\n              1822-1830         |              1831-1839\r\n                                |\r\n         Death-rate  Death-rate |       Death-rate  Death-rate\r\n         over all.   under five.|       over all.   under five.\r\n  Year    One in      One in    |  Year  One in      One in\r\n  1822     44·4        101      |  1831   33·8         79\r\n  1823     36·4         78      |  1832   21·67        63\r\n  1824     37·0         81      |  1833   35·7         77\r\n  1825     36·3         81      |  1834   36·3         81\r\n  1826     40·6        105      |  1835   32·6         67\r\n  1827     37·0         84      |  1836   28·9         62\r\n  1828     33·0         79      |  1837   24·6         65\r\n  1829     37·9        100      |  1838   37·9         83\r\n  1830     41·5         97      |  1839   36·1         72\r\n\r\nThe high death-rates in some of the years in the second column were owing\r\nto special causes--Asiatic cholera in 1832, smallpox of children in 1835\r\nand 1836, and to influenza, as well as to typhus, in 1831, 1833 and 1837.\r\nAs to the fever which prevailed from 1831 to 1836, as it was not relapsing\r\nin type, so it was not associated with scarcity.\r\n\r\n    “The increase of fever in Glasgow,” says Cowan, “during the seven\r\n    years prior to 1837, had taken place, not in years of famine or\r\n    distress, but during a period of unexampled prosperity, when every\r\n    individual able and willing to work was secure of steady and\r\n    remunerating employment. From the close of 1836, one of those\r\n    periodical depressions in trade, arising from the state of our\r\n    monetary system, had visited this city, and deprived a large\r\n    proportion of the population of the means of subsistence[364].”\r\n\r\nIt was then that the cases of typhus trebled in number.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of fever reached its height in Dundee about the same time as\r\nin Glasgow, and in both towns sooner than anywhere else in Scotland or\r\nEngland. One reason of this was the labour-troubles culminating in\r\nstrikes. In the twelvemonth from 15 June, 1836, to 12 June, 1837, more\r\nthan three-fourths of all the admissions to the Dundee Infirmary on the\r\nmedical side were for fever (700 cases). After the wet autumn of 1836\r\nthere were a good many cases of dysentery, of which 22 were treated in the\r\ninfirmary, with two deaths[365].\r\n\r\nAt Edinburgh, as at Glasgow, there had been an unusual amount of fever in\r\n1831 and 1832, and a steady prevalence of it thereafter. The epidemic of\r\n1836-39 was for the most part typhus of the winter seasons, declining each\r\nspring and disappearing each summer, except in the summer of 1836, when\r\nmany cases came in June, July and August from airy parts of the town[366].\r\nThe climax of the epidemic was in 1838, a year later than in Glasgow and\r\nDundee, according to the admissions to the fever-wards of the\r\ninfirmary[367]:\r\n\r\n_Admissions for Fever, Edinburgh Infirmary._\r\n\r\n  Year    Cases\r\n\r\n  1831     758\r\n  1832    1394\r\n  1833     878\r\n  1834     690\r\n  1835     826\r\n  1836     652\r\n  1837    1224\r\n  1838    2244\r\n  1839    1235\r\n  1840     782\r\n\r\nAt Aberdeen the epidemic appears to have been later even than at\r\nEdinburgh, if the following admissions to one of the two fever-wards (Dr\r\nKilgour’s) may be taken as a fair measure of it[368]:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Admissions for Fever, Aberdeen._\r\n\r\n  Year                        Cases   Deaths\r\n\r\n  1838 (March to December)     189      26\r\n  1839                         286      29\r\n  1840                         534      53\r\n\r\nIn all these large towns of Scotland, the fever was purely typhus. The\r\nvarious observers all describe the fever as of the spotted kind, the\r\nproportion of cases with spots varying somewhat.\r\n\r\n    Thus, at Glasgow Infirmary, from 1835 to 1839, there were 4202 cases\r\n    with eruption, 1270 without eruption, and 143 doubtful. And, that the\r\n    cases without eruption were not cases of enteric or typhoid, is\r\n    probable from the record kept of the fatalities in Dr Anderson’s\r\n    fever-wards[369]:\r\n\r\n        In 1885 cases with eruption,   275 deaths, or 14·58 per cent.\r\n         \"  324 cases without eruption, 11 deaths, or  3·33 per cent.\r\n         \"  143 cases doubtful,          7 deaths, or  4·89 per cent.\r\n\r\n    At Aberdeen, Kilgour counted 59 cases spotted in a total of 189 in\r\n    1838, 96 in a total of 286 in 1839, and 278 in a total of 534 in 1840,\r\n    all the cases, whether spotted or not, being of the same fever, which\r\n    he considered an exanthematous malady as a whole. Of 169 cases\r\n    tabulated by Craigie at Edinburgh, from 28 June, 1836, to 12 February,\r\n    1837, there were 79 with an eruption, which was usually the mottled or\r\n    rubeoloid rash.\r\n\r\nThe fatalities were relatively more in Edinburgh than in Dundee, comparing\r\ntwo periods which were not the same. Of 700 cases at Dundee, from June,\r\n1836, to June, 1837, only 50 died, or 1 in 14, notwithstanding a good many\r\ncomplications from chest complaints and bowel complaints[370]. At\r\nEdinburgh during fifteen months of 1838-39, there died 276 in 2037 cases,\r\nor 1 in 7·3; of those cases, 1075 were in females, with 116 deaths, or 1\r\nin 9, and 962 males, with 160 deaths, or 1 in 6[371]. The most common age\r\nfor the fever at Dundee was from twenty to forty years (416 out of 700\r\ncases, with 26 deaths, or 1 in 16), while the most fatal age, as usual,\r\nwas from forty to sixty years, at which one person died of three attacked.\r\nAt Aberdeen, in the last year of the epidemic, the years of life from ten\r\nto twenty had more cases (233 in a total of 657) than any other decade of\r\nlife. The average stay of a patient in the Aberdeen fever-wards was 18·67\r\ndays. The great preponderance of deaths in adolescents or adults was\r\nclearly shown in the Glasgow fever-statistics, 1835-39.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Fever-deaths per cent.\r\n  Deaths from      Under        Over     of deaths from\r\n  typhus fever   ten years   ten years      all causes\r\n\r\n     4788           752         4036          11·57\r\n\r\nThe corresponding epidemic of typhus in England had the fortune to be\r\nrecorded in great part under the new system of Registration, which came\r\ninto force on the 1st of July, 1837. At the beginning of registration of\r\nthe causes of death, and until a good many years after, no distinction was\r\nmade in the published tables between typhus fever and enteric fever. But\r\nwe happen to know that the epidemic of 1837-38 was in London almost\r\nwholly typhus, just as it was in the large towns of Scotland. Of sixty\r\ncases in 1837-38, of which notes were kept by West, under Latham at St\r\nBartholomew’s Hospital, none that died and were examined post-mortem had\r\nulcerations, although some had congestion, of Peyer’s patches, the cases\r\nbeing all reckoned typhus exanthematicus[372]. Sir Thomas Watson, who was\r\nthen physician to the Middlesex Hospital, says of the ulceration of\r\nPeyer’s patches in continued fever:\r\n\r\n    “Since attention has been drawn to the subject, the patches of glands,\r\n    and the whole tract of mucous membrane, from the stomach to the\r\n    rectum, have been diligently explored, and the result seems to be\r\n    that, at certain times and places (in other words, in certain\r\n    epidemics), the ulceration of the inner surface of the intestine is\r\n    far less common than at others. It was comparatively rare in an\r\n    epidemic of which I witnessed some part in Edinburgh [1827-29]. Then I\r\n    came to London; and for several years I never saw a body opened after\r\n    death by continued fever without finding ulcers of the bowels. More\r\n    recently, however, and especially during the present epidemic (1838),\r\n    I have looked for them carefully, in many cases that have proved fatal\r\n    in the Middlesex Hospital, and have discovered neither ulceration nor\r\n    any other apparent change in the follicles of the intestines.” And\r\n    elsewhere he confirms the purely typhus character of the epidemic of\r\n    1838: “Our wards at the Middlesex are full of it, and scarcely a case\r\n    presents itself without these spots. We speak of it familiarly as the\r\n    _spotted_ fever; or, from the resemblance which the rash bears to that\r\n    of measles, as the _rubeoloid_ fever[373].”\r\n\r\nFrom which it would appear that not even the ordinary average number of\r\nendemic cases of enteric fever, such as might have been expected at a\r\nhospital in the west end of London, were forthcoming in the epidemic of\r\n1837-38, so purely was the type of fever typhus.\r\n\r\nThe deaths from this epidemic in London, from the 1st of July, 1837, to\r\nthe 31st of December, 1838, were as follows[374]:\r\n\r\n        1837                           1838\r\n    3rd      4th          1st      2nd      3rd      4th\r\n  Quarter  Quarter      Quarter  Quarter  Quarter  Quarter\r\n\r\n    826     1107         1285     1176      829      788\r\n\r\n--a total of 6011 deaths from fever, nearly all typhus, in eighteen\r\nmonths. The worst London parishes were Whitechapel and St Pancras, in\r\nwhich latter the fever-hospital was situated. The high mortality from\r\nfever, which had begun before the 1st of July, 1837, continued into the\r\nyear 1839, when the deaths in London (probably including some enteric)\r\nwere 1819.\r\n\r\nOver all England and Wales, including London, the last six months of 1837\r\nproduced 9047 deaths from “typhus,” and the twelve months of 1838, 18,775\r\ndeaths, the winter of 1837-38 having been the most fatal period. After\r\nLondon, the large towns most affected by the epidemic in the latter half\r\nof 1837 were as follows:\r\n\r\n               Deaths from\r\n                typhus in\r\n               six months\r\n\r\n  Liverpool      524\r\n  Manchester }\r\n  and Salford}   274\r\n  Birmingham      75\r\n  Bolton          75\r\n  Sunderland      72\r\n  Leeds           71\r\n  Sheffield       68\r\n  Bradford        65\r\n  Stockport       63\r\n  Dudley          54\r\n  Abergavenny     53\r\n  Wolverhampton   45\r\n  Newcastle       44\r\n  Wigan           43\r\n  Chorley         41\r\n  Swansea         36\r\n  Halifax         33\r\n  Macclesfield    33\r\n  Norwich         27\r\n\r\nIn each of the next two years the number of deaths from typhus in the four\r\nlargest towns was as follows:\r\n\r\n                  Typhus      Typhus\r\n                  deaths      deaths\r\n                 in 1838     in 1839\r\n\r\n  Manchester}\r\n  and Salford}     627         416\r\n  Liverpool        573         358\r\n  Leeds            245         150\r\n  Birmingham       123         141\r\n\r\nFrom nearly all the registration districts of England and Wales, deaths\r\nfrom fever were returned in 1837-39, so that the contagion must have been\r\nvery widely spread in town and country[375]. In London the epidemic\r\ndeclined greatly in 1839, but in many parts of England the deaths\r\nregistered as “typhus” were hardly less numerous than in 1838, and in some\r\ncountry divisions they were more, as if the contagion had taken longer to\r\nreach the villages[376]. One village epidemic in North Devon in the latter\r\nhalf of the year 1839 had been observed by Dr W. Budd, afterwards of\r\nBristol:\r\n\r\n    The first case in the village (North Tawton, 1100 to 1200 inhabitants)\r\n    was of a young woman in a poor and crowded cottage, who sickened on 11\r\n    July, 1839; her mother, brother, and sister sickened in succession,\r\n    her father and a young infant escaping the infection. In another\r\n    cottage, four out of six were ill of fever, in another, three persons\r\n    had it, and so on, the whole number of cases treated by Dr Budd in the\r\n    village until the beginning of November being about eighty. It was\r\n    carried from North Tawton to neighbouring hamlets: thus, a sawyer who\r\n    lodged next door to the first infected cottage sickened of the fever\r\n    and, on 2 August, returned to his home in the hamlet of Morchard. As\r\n    he lay there, he was visited by a friend, who assisted to raise him in\r\n    bed: “While thus employed, the friend was quite overpowered by the\r\n    smell from the sick man’s body,” and on the tenth day thereafter\r\n    sickened of fever, which spread to two of his children and to a\r\n    brother who came from a distance to see him. Another sawyer who lodged\r\n    with the former left North Tawton ill a week after him (9 August) for\r\n    his home, also at Morchard, where he died after a period not stated;\r\n    ten days after his death his two children took the fever, his widow\r\n    escaping it. In a third instance, a widow L---- left North Tawton on\r\n    21 August to visit her brother, a farmer in the hamlet of Chaffcombe,\r\n    seven miles distant. Two days after her arrival she fell ill of fever\r\n    and recovered slowly. In the same farmhouse the mistress caught it a\r\n    month or two later and died on 4 November; the farmer himself took to\r\n    bed with the fever on the day his wife died, and came safe through the\r\n    attack. Three weeks after, an apprentice on the farm sickened, then a\r\n    lad (the fifth in order) in the end of December, then the farmer’s\r\n    sister, then another apprentice, then a serving-man, then a\r\n    maidservant, and lastly the daughter of the widow L---- from North\r\n    Tawton, who had been the first case in the house months before. This\r\n    farmhouse at Chaffcombe sent off two distinct offshoots of contagion.\r\n    The lad, who was fifth in the above series, was sent home ill to his\r\n    mother’s cottage, between Bow and North Tawton, in the end of\r\n    December. His mother sickened on 24 January, 1840, and died on 2\r\n    February. Next door to her lived a married daughter, whose whole\r\n    household were attacked. Another married daughter, who came from a\r\n    distance to visit the sick, took the infection on her return home, and\r\n    so started a new focus. From the same farm at Chaffcombe, the maid,\r\n    who was ninth in order in the above series, was sent home to her\r\n    father’s cottage in the hamlet of Loosebeare, four miles away; her\r\n    father caught the fever from her, and a farmer K----, who lived across\r\n    the road, having visited this man several times in his illness, took\r\n    the fever next, other cases following under farmer K’s. roof, and\r\n    thereafter throughout the whole hamlet of Loosebeare[377].\r\n\r\nThis was doubtless the way the epidemic spread in all the country\r\ndistricts of England, the unwholesome state of labourers’ cottages, as\r\nrevealed in the reports of the Poor Law Commission, favouring it. In the\r\nchapter on the fevers of Ireland we shall find that the contagion of\r\ntyphus and relapsing fever was dispersed in the same way, but to a much\r\ngreater extent, owing to the amount of vagrancy.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacturing towns of the North of England the fever continued at\r\na somewhat steady epidemic level for several years. The pathetic scenes of\r\ntyphus among the poor of Manchester in Mrs Gaskell’s famous tale of _Mary\r\nBarton_ belong to the early part of the year 1839; but they might have\r\nbeen drawn from almost any months of the two or three years following,\r\naccording to the passage cited below from the same work[378]. In 1839 the\r\nLancashire deaths from typhus were 1343; in Wales, Monmouth and\r\nHerefordshire they were 1548. There is, indeed, little improvement in the\r\nstatistical returns as late as 1842. The deaths from “typhus” were as\r\nfollows in all England and Wales:\r\n\r\n\r\n         1838    1839    1840    1841    1842\r\n        18,775  15,666  17,177  14,846  16,201\r\n\r\n    The deaths from the epidemic maladies of infants and children during\r\n    the same five years were also very high.\r\n\r\n                       1838      1839     1840    1841     1842\r\n\r\n        Smallpox      16,268     9,131   10,434   6,368    2,715\r\n        Measles        6,514    10,937    9,326   6,894    8,742\r\n        Hooping cough  9,107     8,165    6,132   8,099    8,091\r\n        Scarlatina     5,802    10,325   19,816  14,161   12,807\r\n        Croup          4,463     4,192    4,336   4,177    4,457\r\n        Diarrhoea      2,482     2,562    3,469   3,240    5,241\r\n\r\n    The epidemic of smallpox corresponded closely to the epidemic of\r\n    fever, the former being fatal chiefly to infants and young children,\r\n    the latter fatal chiefly to adults. Before the smallpox epidemic had\r\n    subsided scarlet fever became unusually mortal, especially in 1840,\r\n    and kept its higher level of deaths for a generation after. The\r\n    epidemic of fever, although it affected the mortality of the young\r\n    comparatively little, was indirectly a reason why many of them died of\r\n    other diseases; for the prostration of the parents, the\r\n    impoverishment, and all the other troubles associated with an epidemic\r\n    of typhus, led to inevitable sufferings among the young, which\r\n    weakened their power of resistance.\r\n\r\nThe registration returns were not tabulated (except for London) from the\r\nend of 1842 to the beginning of 1847, but there is reason to think that\r\nthe epidemic fever was not active in the interval. It is undoubted that\r\nthe enormous construction of railroads in England during those years gave\r\nemployment and wages to multitudes, and ended the distress the sooner.\r\nThis effect of railroad-making in England was so obvious that Lord George\r\nBentinck desired to relieve the distress in Ireland in 1846-47 by the same\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnteric Fever mixed with the prevailing Typhus, 1831-42.\r\n\r\nWhile there is complete agreement among the hospital physicians of the\r\ngreat towns that the fever of 1837-39 was maculated typhus, to the total\r\nexclusion of cases with ulceration of the bowel, as in the experience of\r\nWatson at the Middlesex Hospital and of West (under Latham) at St\r\nBartholomew’s, yet some allowance should be made, in interpreting the\r\nfigures of fever mortality in those years throughout England and Wales,\r\nfor admixture of enteric fever. Budd’s statement that the only case which\r\nwas dissected in the epidemic at North Tawton, Devonshire, in 1839, had\r\nthe bowel-lesion of enteric fever, if it is to count in the absence of the\r\nusual details (place, date, objective description), would mean that at\r\nleast one case there was not of the prevailing type of contagious epidemic\r\ntyphus. The coincidence of some such cases is made the more probable by\r\nthe evidence from Anstruther, Fifeshire, reported by John Goodsir,\r\nafterwards Professor of Anatomy at Edinburgh, who was assisting his father\r\nin practice there from 1835 to 1839. During that period, which was the\r\ntime of the typhus epidemic in the larger towns of Scotland, he attended\r\nabout one hundred cases of fever annually in Anstruther and the\r\nneighbourhood; the fever was usually mild, only some sixteen of the cases\r\nhaving proved fatal; of those sixteen he examined ten after death, finding\r\n“ulceration” of the Peyer’s patches in all, and perforation of the\r\nintestine in four of them. These facts he gave orally to Dr John Reid,\r\npathologist to the Edinburgh Infirmary, whose experience of the morbid\r\nanatomy of fever was altogether different. Goodsir, having kept the\r\nspecimens, made them the subject of a paper some years after (1842), in\r\nwhich he described very minutely the stages and degrees of congestion,\r\nulceration, sloughing and perforation in the lymph-follicles of the\r\nintestine in fever, placing congestions at one end of the scale and\r\nsloughing at the other, as the French pathologists then did[379]. Reid\r\nexamined, at the Edinburgh Infirmary from October, 1838, to June, 1839,\r\nforty-one bodies dead of fever, to see whether the intestinal lesion,\r\nwhich Goodsir had told him of, occurred in them. The distinctness of the\r\nPeyer’s patches varied a good deal (differences which are known to be in\r\npart congenital and in part to depend on age), and in only two instances\r\nwere they elevated and seemingly “ulcerated.”\r\n\r\n    One of these was the case of an Irishman, from Sligo, aged 25, who had\r\n    been so constipated that he was purged with colocynth, etc.: “at the\r\n    lower part of the ileum, the elliptical patches were irregular on the\r\n    surface, and presented several superficial and ill-defined depressions\r\n    (ulcerations).” The other was the case of a girl, aged 15, who had not\r\n    suffered from diarrhoea, but had the intestinal patches elevated and\r\n    superficially “ulcerated[380].” Neither of these cases would probably\r\n    be reckoned typhoid or enteric fever at the present time on the\r\n    anatomical evidence only. The early French observers, Chomel, Louis,\r\n    Andral and others, included in a scale all the appearances of the\r\n    Peyer’s patches in fever that they thought morbid, from mere\r\n    prominence of the lymphatic tissue and distinctness of the follicular\r\n    pits, up to extensive sloughing and ulceration of the same, as if they\r\n    were all the signs of one and the same fever in its various stages of\r\n    development. But simple prominence or congestion of Peyer’s patches\r\n    may occur in typhus fever, or in relapsing fever; nor would a slight\r\n    erosion, or “superficial ulceration” raise in all cases a suspicion of\r\n    enteric fever.\r\n\r\nThe observations of Home, Reid’s predecessor as pathologist to the\r\nEdinburgh Infirmary, from 1833 to 1837, were however conclusive that true\r\nenteric fever had occurred now and again during the steady prevalence of\r\ntyphus fever from year to year. In that space he made 101 post-mortem\r\nexaminations in fever-cases; in 29 the Peyer’s patches were distinct, in 7\r\nof those 29 there was “a greater or less degree of ulceration,” and in 2\r\nof those 7 there was perforation[381]. Murchison examined the post-mortem\r\nregister of the Edinburgh Infirmary for the years 1833 to 1838, and found\r\nonly fifteen cases of fever with ulceration of the bowel. But in the eight\r\nmonths from 1 November, 1846, to June, 1847, there were nineteen\r\ndissections with the characteristic lesion of typhoid, the season having\r\nbeen remarkable everywhere for that disease.\r\n\r\nIn the following series of years the fatal cases of fever in the Edinburgh\r\nInfirmary with ulceration were few[382]:\r\n\r\n  Year    Enteric deaths\r\n\r\n  1854          5\r\n  1855          2\r\n  1856          1\r\n  1857          8\r\n  1858          1\r\n  1859          2\r\n  1860          1\r\n  1861          6\r\n\r\nIt was thought remarkable that the form of continued fever which was most\r\nusually found in the great continental cities, in Paris, Berlin, Prague\r\nand Vienna, namely that with ulceration of the lymph-follicles of the\r\nintestine, should be but occasionally mixed with the old typhus in\r\nEngland, Ireland and Scotland in the very same years. But there was\r\nnothing to discredit the British observations, anatomical and clinical;\r\nand in 1836 Dr Lombard, of Geneva, having visited various cities in\r\nEngland, Scotland and Ireland bore witness to the matter of fact, strange\r\nas it was to him. Writing to Graves, of Dublin, on 16 June, 1836, he said:\r\n“Before I leave Ireland, allow me to express to you my great astonishment\r\nat what I have seen in this country respecting your continued fever;” and\r\nin a second letter, of 18 July, after his return to Geneva, he added, that\r\nin Liverpool, ulceration of the ileum in continued fever was “occasional,”\r\nthat in Manchester he had been told it occurred “by no means always,” that\r\nin Birmingham the cases of fever were not many, but “always” with\r\nintestinal ulceration, and that in London “not a fourth part” of the cases\r\nof fever had the latter condition, and these mostly in autumn[383]. This\r\nwas before the great epidemic of typhus had begun in the English towns. To\r\nthe same non-epidemic period (1834) belongs the statement of Carrick, for\r\nBristol, that fever was often observed to be infrequent or altogether\r\nabsent in the most crowded and dirty parts of the city at times when there\r\nwere a good many cases “in institutions and dwellings where cleanliness\r\nand free air are most carefully attended to,” and that ulceration of the\r\nbowel was the most common post-mortem appearance[384].\r\n\r\nThe comparative rarity of enteric fever in the chief towns of Scotland and\r\nIreland continued for a good many years longer, indeed until after the\r\ndifferences between typhus and typhoid were perceived and admitted by all.\r\nEven at the London Fever Hospital, during twenty-four years (1848-71)\r\nafter Sir William Jenner’s diagnostic points were strictly looked to in\r\nits wards, much the greater part of the admissions were of typhus; in only\r\ntwo periods, 1850-55 and 1858-61, during both of which there was\r\ncomparatively little fever of any kind in London, did the admissions for\r\nenteric fever slightly exceed those for typhus; on an annual average of\r\nthe twenty-four years ending 1871, the cases of the former were only about\r\na fifth part of the whole. The cases of enteric fever increased decidedly\r\nafter 1865. Murchison thought that the increase might be accounted for in\r\npart by the enlargement of the Fever Hospital, and by the unusually high\r\ntemperature of certain years, the summers and autumns of 1865, 1866, 1868\r\nand 1870 having been remarkable for their great heat and prolonged\r\ndrought; but, he adds, “it is not a little remarkable that this increased\r\nprevalence of enteric fever in the metropolis has been contemporaneous\r\nwith the completion of the main drainage scheme[385].”\r\n\r\nStill more recently, the relative proportions of typhus and enteric fever\r\nhave been reversed, so that there have been years with little or no typhus\r\nbut with a good deal of enteric fever. There are some persons,\r\nunacquainted with the history, who cannot imagine that it was ever\r\notherwise than now, who think of the former times of medicine, not as\r\ndiffering in social, economic, and various other respects from their own,\r\nbut only as being less clever at diagnosis. There are others who realize\r\nclearly enough the historical matter of fact, but find it necessary to\r\nexplain the almost contemporaneous decline of typhus and rise of typhoid\r\nby some hypothesis of the latter being “evolved” out of the former. This\r\nevolutional doctrine makes the mistake of ascribing to the species of\r\ndisease the same comparative fixity of characters that belongs to the\r\nspecies of animals and plants. Beside the latter, the species of disease\r\nare the creatures of a day. In the nosological field, the origin of\r\nspecies is not analogous to the evolution of a new species of animal or\r\nplant out of an old, as in the hypothesis of Darwin, for the reason that\r\nevery species of disease is evolved directly and, as it were, _pro re\r\nnata_, out of a few simple conditions of human life, variously mixed but\r\nalways there to give occasion to one infective malady or another, which\r\nmay have a shorter existence, like sweating sickness, or a longer, like\r\nplague. Edinburgh experiences offer a ready criticism of the evolutional\r\ndoctrine. Typhus declined, and typhoid rose; but it was in the old\r\ntenement houses of the Canongate, Cowgate, Grassmarket, and High Street\r\nthat typhus declined, and it was mostly in the new streets across the\r\nvalley, or in the New Town of Edinburgh, that enteric fever arose, having\r\nsometimes no more mysterious an origin than the results of defective or\r\ncheap plumber-work, for example, the leakage of a soil-pipe fermenting, a\r\nfoot deep, beneath the basement floor. But it was not until a good many\r\nyears after that these new experiences became common; and meanwhile\r\nEdinburgh and other towns in Scotland saw much of typhus and relapsing\r\nfever.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelapsing Fever in Scotland, 1842-44.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of 1836-39 had been typhus of a specially maculated kind. The\r\nperiod or “constitution” of synocha, rising twice to epidemics of\r\nrelapsing fever, had lasted from near the beginning of the century until\r\n1828 or 1829. Then came the new constitution of low, depressed, spotted\r\nfever, which would not stand blood-letting. But in 1842-44 relapsing fever\r\nreappeared in Scotland. This reappearance was a blow to two doctrines of\r\nthe time--first that Ireland was the original breeding-place of all such\r\nfevers, and secondly, that a return of the “constitution” of relapsing\r\nfever would warrant a return to the practice of blood-letting, which had\r\nfallen into disuse during the epidemic of typhus. The epidemic of 1842-44\r\nwas at first purely a Scots affair, with some extension to England, but\r\nnone to Ireland. As to blood-letting, once it had been given over in\r\nfevers it was not readily taken up again, notwithstanding the theory that\r\nrelapsing fever belonged to those sthenic or inflammatory types of\r\nsickness in which the lancet was still thought admissible. Moreover,\r\nChristison, who remembered the relapsing synocha of 1817-19 and of\r\n1827-28, said of the third epidemic: “The synocha of 1843-44, though so\r\nprevalent, by no means presented the same strong phlogistic or sthenic\r\ncharacter as in the earlier epidemics of 1817-20 and 1826-29. The pulse\r\nwas neither so frequent nor so strong; the heat was not so pungent; the\r\nglow of the integuments was less lively and less general[386].”\r\n\r\nI take conveniently from Murchison the following succinct account of the\r\nScots relapsing fever of 1842-44[387]:\r\n\r\n    “The next epidemic of fever in 1843 differed from those that preceded\r\n    it, inasmuch as it did not originate in or implicate Ireland, but was\r\n    mainly confined to Scotland. There was no increase of fever in the\r\n    Irish hospitals during this year, whereas the number of admissions\r\n    into the Glasgow Infirmary rose from 1,194 to 3,467; in the Edinburgh\r\n    Infirmary from 842 to 2,080; and in the Aberdeen Infirmary from 282 to\r\n    1,280. These numbers, too, are far from representing the true extent\r\n    of the epidemic, for thousands of sick were sent from the hospital\r\n    doors. The fever was almost exclusively relapsing fever; typhus was\r\n    comparatively rare. The first cases were observed on the east coast of\r\n    Fife, in 1841-2 (by H. Goodsir), and not in the crowded localities of\r\n    large towns. In Dundee, where the proportion of typhus cases was\r\n    comparatively great, the fever appeared early in the summer of 1842,\r\n    and raged to a considerable extent during the whole of the autumn,\r\n    before it showed itself elsewhere. In Glasgow the first cases occurred\r\n    in September, 1842; but the fever was not generally prevalent until\r\n    December, from which month the cases rapidly increased until October,\r\n    1843, when the epidemic began to decline. The number of cases in\r\n    Glasgow was estimated at 33,000, or 11½ per cent. of the entire\r\n    population. In Edinburgh relapsing fever was first observed in\r\n    February, 1843. It rapidly spread until October, after which it\r\n    gradually abated, until, by the following April, it had well nigh\r\n    disappeared. In the month of October, 1843, the number of fever cases\r\n    admitted into the Edinburgh Infirmary amounted to 638, and during\r\n    several months, from thirty to fifty cases were daily refused\r\n    admission. The total number of cases in Edinburgh was calculated by\r\n    Alison at 9,000. In Aberdeen the epidemic commenced about the same\r\n    time, and followed the same course as in Edinburgh. At Leith,\r\n    curiously enough, it did not appear until September, 1843; it then\r\n    spread rapidly for two months, after which it declined, and by the end\r\n    of February, 1844, it had almost ceased; but during this brief period\r\n    it attacked 1,800 persons, or one in every fourteen of the population.\r\n    The disease was general over Scotland, and was not restricted to the\r\n    large towns; it prevailed in Greenock, Paisley, Musselburgh, Tranent,\r\n    Penicuick, Haddington, Dunbar, the Isle of Skye, etc. Although the\r\n    epidemic was mostly confined to Scotland, the same fever was observed\r\n    in some of the large towns of England. The number of admissions into\r\n    the London Fever Hospital rose from 252 in the preceding year to 1,385\r\n    in 1843: and the annual report for 1843 makes it evident that a large\r\n    proportion of these cases were relapsing fever. The rate of mortality\r\n    of the epidemic was small, not exceeding from two-and-a-half to four\r\n    per cent. Although this was the same fever as prevailed in 1817-19,\r\n    even local bleeding was rarely resorted to, and many of the cases were\r\n    thought to demand stimulants. All accounts agree in stating that the\r\n    epidemic supervened upon a period of great distress among the Scottish\r\n    poor, and that it was restricted throughout to the poorest and most\r\n    wretched of the population.”\r\n\r\nThis epidemic, which was the subject of an altogether unusual amount of\r\nwriting in Edinburgh[388], partly on the supposition that relapsing fever\r\nwas a “new disease,” proved once for all that one had not to go to Ireland\r\nfor the engendering or making of a famine-fever. The demonstration came\r\njust in time; for the epidemic was hardly over in Scotland, when the\r\nseries of great potato-famines in Ireland began in 1845, soon to be\r\nfollowed by the disastrous epidemics of dysentery, relapsing fever and\r\ntyphus from 1846 to 1848. Indeed, so near was the Scots epidemic to the\r\nIrish, that in the North of Ireland the first of the relapsing fever, in\r\n1846, was called “the Scotch Fever,” on the supposition that it had\r\nreached them from its recent focus in the West of Scotland[389]. The Irish\r\nand original part of the great epidemic of 1846-48 has been fully\r\ndescribed in another chapter; much of the mortality was due to dysentery,\r\nand the most prevalent fever was relapsing fever, with a very low rate of\r\nfatality among the poorer classes. But in Ireland itself there was also\r\nmuch typhus, very mortal to the richer classes who came in contact with\r\nthe starving multitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Irish Fever” of 1847 in England and Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe contagion that reached England and Scotland from the scene of famine\r\nin Ireland was more apt to produce typhus than relapsing fever. That the\r\nIrish contagion was the principal source of the great epidemics in England\r\nand Scotland in 1847-48, seems to be proved by every fact in their\r\nprogress, direction and other circumstances. But it is not so clear that\r\nEngland and Scotland would not have had an unusual amount of typhus in the\r\nsame years even if the Irish had been kept out by an ideally strict\r\nquarantine. What touched Ireland most, touched Scotland and England in a\r\nmeasure. The seasons were bad in all parts of the kingdom; many were out\r\nof work in the manufacturing towns; but as soon as the price of provisions\r\nfell in 1848, the epidemic in England came to a sudden end.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of fever in England in 1847 was almost wholly typhus; in\r\nScotland, it was to some extent relapsing fever, but there also it was\r\nmainly typhus. It was more severe, while it lasted, than the epidemic of\r\n1837 and following years; but it was of shorter duration, ceasing almost\r\nabruptly in 1848. The rise of the epidemic of 1847 in London is shown by\r\nthe following quarterly returns of the deaths from fever:\r\n\r\n  1st Quarter  2nd Quarter  3rd Quarter  4th Quarter\r\n\r\n      442         568           895         1279\r\n\r\nIn the last quarter of 1846, the deaths from fever in London had been\r\n619. In all England, the last quarter of 1846 was also most unhealthy, its\r\ndeaths from all causes being 53,055 (only 43,850 in the first quarter of\r\nthe year). The summer of 1846 had been remarkable for heat and drought,\r\nand the end of the year was, according to precedent, an unwholesome time.\r\nIt was just the season for enteric fever, as in the still more memorable\r\ncircumstances of 1826. There is evidence from various parts of England and\r\nScotland that much of the fever of the end of 1846 was enteric; and it was\r\ndoubtless the unusual prevalence of that disease, and of other maladies\r\nthat are favoured, like it, by extreme fluctuations of the ground-water,\r\nthat explains the very high mortality of the last quarter of 1846[390].\r\nBut it is equally certain that it was typhus which raised the fever deaths\r\nin London in the last quarter of 1847 to 1,279, and the deaths from all\r\ncauses in all England to the enormous total of 57,925. In the whole of the\r\nyear 1847, typhus alone claimed 30,320 deaths in England and Wales, the\r\ntotal in 1848 falling to 21,406. Lancashire and Cheshire had the largest\r\nshare of this epidemic, and Liverpool the largest share in Lancashire. In\r\nthat Registration Division (the North-western) the deaths from typhus in\r\n1847 were 9,076, and in 1848 they were 3,380. Next in order (excluding\r\nLondon and suburbs) came the West Midland Division, and next to that\r\nYorkshire. At Liverpool, and in other places of the north-west of England,\r\nthe fever was very clearly connected with the enormous Irish immigration,\r\nand was in great part among the Irish. There were floating lazarettos on\r\nthe Mersey, filled with fever and dysentery, workhouses overflowing, and\r\nsheds hastily built to hold each 300 patients. The following returns from\r\nthe several sub-divisions of Liverpool for the months of July, August and\r\nSeptember, 1847, show the proportions of dysentery and fever, as well as\r\nthe mortality from diarrhoea, which last was mostly an affair of the\r\ninfants and young children[391]:\r\n\r\n_Liverpool deaths, July-Sept. 1847._\r\n\r\n                     Fever   Dysentery   Diarrhoea\r\n  St Martin’s         291       82          174\r\n  Dale Street         250       20          111\r\n  St Thomas      (301 deaths on the floating lazarettos)\r\n  Mount Pleasant      324       18           73\r\n  Islington           105       37           78\r\n  Great Howard Street (the fever extending to the upper classes)\r\n\r\nIn his report for the quarter before (April, May and June, 1847) the\r\nregistrar of the Great Howard Street sub-district says: “Eight Roman\r\nCatholic priests, and one clergyman of the Church of England, have fallen\r\nvictims to their indefatigable attentions to the poor of their\r\nchurch[392].”\r\n\r\nIn Manchester there were causes of fever independently of the Irish\r\ncontagion. The registrar of the Deangate sub-district writes in the third\r\nquarter of 1847: “In the calamitous season just passed, manufactures have\r\nbeen almost at a stand-still; food has been unattainable by the poor, for\r\nemployment they had none; Famine made her dwelling in their homes &c.” The\r\nhardships of the children caused an immense mortality from summer\r\ndiarrhoea. The same registrar gives an account of the epidemic fever in\r\nhis report for the second quarter of 1847, from which it appears that,\r\nalthough nearly all the hospital cases were distinctly maculated, and the\r\nfever was undoubtedly typhus in all other respects and in its conditions,\r\nyet tympanitis, with abdominal tenderness and diarrhoea, were specially\r\nnoted[393].\r\n\r\nBesides Liverpool and Manchester, many other towns in Lancashire had the\r\n“Irish fever” in them; also Birmingham, Dudley, Wolverhampton, Shrewsbury,\r\nLeeds, Hull, York and Sunderland. Except in London, the fever mortality\r\nwas not unusual in the southern half of England[394].\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the epidemic was a mixture of relapsing fever and typhus. The\r\nfollowing were the proportions of each admitted to the Glasgow Royal\r\nInfirmary:\r\n\r\n  Year   Relapsing Fever  Typhus\r\n\r\n  1846         777          500\r\n  1847       2,333        2,399\r\n  1848         513          980\r\n  1849         168          342\r\n\r\nIn the Barony Fever Hospital, Glasgow, open from 5 August 1847 to July\r\n1848, the relapsing cases were double the typhus cases at the opening of\r\nthe hospital, at the end of 1847 they were nearly equal, and from February\r\n1848 the typhus cases were double the relapsing. In Edinburgh, where the\r\nepidemic was less severe, the same relations were observed--relapsing\r\nfever most at the beginning, typhus fever (much more fatal) most at the\r\nend[395]. Some relapsing fever occurred also in London, among destitute\r\nIrish, which was often attended by a miliary eruption (Ormerod).\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequent Epidemics of Typhus and Relapsing Fevers.\r\n\r\nBy midsummer, 1848, there was a most marked improvement in the public\r\nhealth, corresponding with the great fall in the prices of food, under the\r\ninfluence of free trade, and with a good harvest and the commencement of\r\nan era of steady employment for workers. The improvement is strikingly\r\nshown in the following comparison of the deaths from all causes in\r\nLancashire and Cheshire in the third quarter of each of the years 1846,\r\n1847 and 1848:\r\n\r\n                                  1846    1847    1848\r\n\r\n  Deaths in the 3rd Quarter      15,221  17,080  11,720\r\n\r\nSince the epidemic of 1847, which was not unfairly called “the Irish\r\nfever,” there has been no such extensive and fatal outbreak of typhus or\r\nrelapsing fever in England, Scotland or Ireland. The fever deaths rose\r\nsomewhat in Ireland and in Glasgow in 1851-53, the type of disease being\r\nrelapsing and typhus. In London there was a considerable increase of\r\ntyphus in 1856, at the end of the Crimean War. From 1861 to 1867 there was\r\na considerable epidemic of the same fever in England and Scotland (not\r\nmuch of it in Ireland until 1864), the chief centres in England having\r\nbeen the Lancashire towns, Preston, Manchester, Accrington, Chorley,\r\nSalford and Blackburn, and the occasion of it the “cotton famine” of the\r\nAmerican Civil War[396]. Greenock was the chief seat of typhus in 1863-64\r\nin Scotland; indeed, in the whole kingdom, its death-rate from that cause\r\nwas approached by that of Liverpool only. Fevers had been very mortal\r\nthere in the epidemic of 1847 (it is said 353 deaths); in the next\r\nfever-period they rose as follows[397]:\r\n\r\n  1860  1861  1862  1863  1864\r\n\r\n  19     57    63    98    274\r\n\r\nThis epidemic was more easily dealt with than those of the same kind\r\nbefore it. Very large sums were subscribed by the wealthy, of which,\r\nindeed, a considerable balance remained undistributed. Rawlinson, as\r\nengineer, and Villiers, as Minister, devised extensive relief works, in\r\nthe form of main drainage for the distressed Lancashire towns, the whole\r\ncost being defrayed eventually by the municipalities themselves. The\r\nfollowing table, from Murchison, shows the admissions for typhus to the\r\nfever hospitals of various towns, subsequently to the great epidemic of\r\n1847-48. The first rise in London was in 1856; the next rise, which was\r\nsomewhat prolonged, coincided with the epidemic in Lancashire.\r\n\r\n_Hospital Cases of Typhus, 1849-71._\r\n\r\n       London  Edin.

In the Royal Infirmary of\r\n    Glasgow in 1864, of 2,190 cases of fever, 2,150 were reported to be\r\n    cases of typhus fever, while only 40 were cases of enteric fever. In\r\n    the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary not a case of enteric fever was observed:\r\n    of 396 cases in the year 1863, 387 were pure typhus, and 9 febricula;\r\n    and in 1864, of 926 cases, 897 were pure typhus and 29 febricula. In\r\n    the Royal Infirmary of Dundee, of 355 cases of fever treated in 1864,\r\n    318 were typhus, 16 enteric fever, and 21 febricula. It was only at\r\n    Perth, and there not exclusively in hospital practice, that an excess\r\n    of typhoid fever was observed; from 1st August, 1863, to 30th April,\r\n    1864 (months which included the special typhoid season), there were\r\n    101 cases of gastro-enteric or typhoid fever, 46 cases of typhus, 19\r\n    of relapsing fever, and 59 of simple continued fever[398].\r\n\r\nThe last considerable prevalence of contagious fever in England and\r\nScotland was in 1869 and 1870. It was relapsing fever, mixed with some\r\ntyphus, and it was restricted almost to a few large towns, including\r\nLondon, Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Glasgow, and\r\nEdinburgh[399]. It was first seen in London in 1868 among Polish Jews. It\r\nwas heard of as late as 1872 at Newcastle. It was observed during this\r\nepidemic in Liverpool, Bradford and Edinburgh that the subjects of the\r\nrelapsing fever were not suffering from want[400]. The same observation\r\nhas been made in some foreign countries. Still, on the great scale and in\r\na broad view, relapsing fever has been _typhus famelicus_ or famine-fever,\r\noccurring in association with other maladies due to want, and especially\r\nin the circumstances which have been discussed fully in the chapter on\r\nfevers in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelative prevalence of Typhus and Enteric Fevers since 1869.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the year 1869, or about the time when typhus fever ceased\r\nto be epidemic or common, that the deaths from typhus fever, simple\r\ncontinued fever and enteric fever began to be tabulated separately in the\r\nRegistrar-General’s reports. The following tables show for England and\r\nWales and for London a steady decline of the deaths from typhus and simple\r\ncontinued fever since the end of the epidemic period 1869-71, which was\r\nthe last epidemic of typhus and relapsing fever in this country hitherto.\r\nThe deaths from enteric fever, it will be seen, remained somewhat steady\r\n(in a growing population) for about ten years after the separation, and\r\nthen began to decline.\r\n\r\n_Continued-fever Deaths in England and Wales, 1869-91._\r\n\r\n                  Simple or\r\n  Year   Typhus  Ill-defined  Enteric\r\n\r\n  1869    4281      5310       8659\r\n  1870    3297      5254       8731\r\n  1871    2754      4248       8461\r\n  1872    1864      3352       8741\r\n  1873    1638      3081       8793\r\n  1874    1762      3089       8861\r\n  1875    1499      2599       8913\r\n  1876    1192      1974       7550\r\n  1877    1104      1923       6879\r\n  1878     906      1776       7652\r\n  1879     533      1472       5860\r\n  1880     530      1490       6710\r\n  1881     552      1159       5529\r\n  1882     940      1016       6036\r\n  1883     877       963       6068\r\n  1884     328       768       6380\r\n  1885     318       662       4765\r\n  1886     245       505       5061\r\n  1887     211       502       5165\r\n  1888     168       436       4848\r\n  1889     140       413       4971\r\n  1890     160       361       6146\r\n  1891     148       325       5075\r\n\r\n_Continued-fever Deaths in London, 1869-91._\r\n\r\n                 Simple or\r\n  Year   Typhus  Ill-defined   Enteric\r\n\r\n  1869    716        615        1069\r\n  1870    472        570         976\r\n  1871    384        436         871\r\n  1872    174        322         867\r\n  1873    277        325         968\r\n  1874    312        337         879\r\n  1875    128        272         817\r\n  1876    159        202         769\r\n  1877    157        194         901\r\n  1878    151        197        1033\r\n  1879     71        160         849\r\n  1880     74        134         702\r\n  1881     92        134         971\r\n  1882     53         95         975\r\n  1883     55        102         963\r\n  1884     32         75         925\r\n  1885     28         78         597\r\n  1886     13         73         618\r\n  1887     19         44         612\r\n  1888      9         35         694\r\n  1889     16         42         538\r\n  1890     10         35         604\r\n  1891     11         44         557\r\n\r\nSuch being the proportions of typhus and enteric fever since 1869, when\r\nthe separation was made, it remains to ask what share each of them may\r\nhave had in the total of “typhus,” or of continued fever generally, in the\r\nyears before the two forms were distinguished in the annual registration\r\nreports. Of course, they were distinguished by many of the profession long\r\nbefore that; so that there are means of forming a judgment. At the London\r\nFever Hospital, enteric fever and typhus were distinguished after 1849. If\r\nthe admissions of each kind of fever to that hospital be assumed to have\r\nbeen proportionate to the prevalence of each in London from year to year,\r\nwe should get in the following table a means of estimating which of the\r\ntwo forms of continued fever furnished most of the deaths in all London,\r\nas given in the first column:\r\n\r\n                            Admissions to London\r\n            Deaths in        Fever Hospital\r\n           London from\r\n  Year     both fevers      Typhus  Typhoid\r\n\r\n  1838        4078            --      --\r\n  1839        1819            --      --\r\n  1840        1262            --      --\r\n  1841        1151            --      --\r\n  1842        1184            --      --\r\n  1843        2094            --      --\r\n  1844        1721            --      --\r\n  1845        1324            --      --\r\n  1846        1838            --      --\r\n  1847        3297            --      --\r\n  1848        3685            --      --\r\n  1849        2564           155     138\r\n  1850        2032           130     137\r\n  1851        2374            68     234\r\n  1852        2183           204     140\r\n  1853        2617           408     212\r\n  1854        2816           337     228\r\n  1855        2410           342     217\r\n  1856        2717          1062     149\r\n  1857        2195           274     214\r\n  1858        1919            15     180\r\n  1859        1840            48     176\r\n  1860        1476            25      95\r\n  1861        1848            86     161\r\n  1862        3673          1827     220\r\n  1863        2871          1309     174\r\n  1864        3782          2493     253\r\n  1865        3217          1950     523\r\n  1866        2688          1760     582\r\n  1867        2184          1396     380\r\n  1868        2468          1964     459\r\n\r\nFrom this it will appear that every great annual rise in the London deaths\r\nfrom “fever,” since the last great typhus epidemic of 1847-48, has\r\ncorresponded to a greatly increased admission, not of enteric cases, but\r\nof typhus cases into the London Fever Hospital. On the other hand, enteric\r\nfever has been at a somewhat steady or endemic level for a good many\r\nyears. Even at that level it would have had a small share of the whole\r\nfever-mortality in the old London; in modern London, especially in its\r\nresidential quarters, its rate has probably been higher than in former\r\ntimes; while in recent years, owing to the absolute decline of typhus, it\r\nhas been by far the most common continued fever. If the conditions were\r\nthe same in London as in Edinburgh, it was the very creation of\r\nresidential streets and new quarters of the town that called forth typhoid\r\nfever; while the more the town was remodelled, the more were the _fomites_\r\nof typhus destroyed. Thus it seems probable that the same progress in\r\nwell-being among all classes, which has gradually brought typhus down\r\nalmost to extinction (or apparently so for the present), has been attended\r\nwith an increase of typhoid, an increase which has happily fallen within\r\nthe last few years from its highest point.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance, during the last twenty years, of typhus and relapsing\r\nfevers from the observation of all but a few medical practitioners in\r\nEngland, Scotland and Ireland, is one of the most certain and most\r\nstriking facts in our epidemiology. Most of the recent English cases have\r\noccurred in Lancashire, especially in Liverpool, and in Sunderland,\r\nGateshead, Newcastle and other shipping places of the north. In the\r\ndecennial period 1871-80 the death-rate from typhus, per 1000 living, was\r\n0·58 in Liverpool and 0·33 in Sunderland, rates which were about the same\r\nas those from enteric fevers. The rates in 1881-83 were also high in the\r\nsame group of towns. As to other industrial centres, including the\r\ncoal-districts of Cumberland, Wales and Scotland, it is probable that a\r\ngood deal of typhus passes under the name of “typhoid,” the change in\r\nmedical fashion having outrun somewhat the real change in the relative\r\nprevalence of each fever[401]. In Scotland the disease is still heard of\r\nfrom time to time in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Leith, Dundee, Aberdeen,\r\nInverness and Thurso. In London the recent immunity from it is remarkable,\r\nbut intelligible. First, the populace is better housed: we have got rid of\r\nthe window-tax, rebuilt the houses in regular streets opening upon wide\r\nthoroughfares, pulled down most of the back-to-back houses, dispersed the\r\nworking population over square miles of suburbs easily accessible from the\r\nheart of the town by tramways and railways, perfected the sewerage and the\r\nwater-supply. These great structural changes are so far an earnest that\r\ntyphus cannot come back in the old way. Secondly, food has been for a long\r\ntime cheap and wages good. During the remarkable lull in typhus from 1803\r\nto 1816, Bateman pointed out that the unwholesome state of the dwellings\r\nof the working class remained the same as before, but that money was\r\nflowing freely among all classes (thanks to the special war-expenditure).\r\nUnder free trade, the same abundance of the necessaries of life has been\r\nsecured in another way. Typhus, it need hardly be said, is an indigenous\r\nor autochthonous infection; the conditions of its engendering are never\r\nvery far off. In a small and remote island off the coast of Skye, which I\r\nhappened to know in its pleasing aspects from having landed upon it during\r\na summer vacation, typhus fever was reported by the newspapers a few\r\nmonths after to have broken out in the hamlet of twenty or thirty\r\nfamilies, the winter storms having prevented the fishers from leaving\r\ntheir cottages or any stranger from approaching the island. In a sparsely\r\npopulated parish of the east coast of Scotland, two cases of genuine\r\ntyphus (one of them fatal), and two only, have occurred, to medical\r\nknowledge, within the last ten years, each in a very poor cottage in a\r\ndifferent part of the parish and in a different season. So long as our\r\ncheap supplies of food, fuel and clothing are uninterrupted, there is\r\nsmall chance of typhus or relapsing fever. But the population of England\r\nbeing now twice as great as the home-grown corn can feed, a return of\r\nthose fevers on the great scale is not out of the question in the event of\r\nthe foreign food-supply being interfered with, or the necessaries of life\r\nbecoming permanently dearer from any other cause.\r\n\r\nThe following Table of the fever-deaths in Scotland since the beginning of\r\nRegistration does not distinguish enteric from typhus, relapsing and\r\nsimple continued during the first ten years of the period; but it is\r\nprobable, from all that is known non-statistically or by hospital figures\r\nonly, as to the history of enteric fever in Scotland, that it made the\r\nsmaller part of the generic total of fever-deaths so long as typhus and\r\nrelapsing fevers were common.\r\n\r\n_Scotland--Deaths from the Continued Fevers since the beginning of\r\nRegistration._\r\n\r\n  Year\r\n\r\n  1855  2419     }\r\n  1856  2363     }\r\n  1857  3087     }\r\n  1858  2790     }\r\n  1859  2436     } Inclusive of typhus, relapsing, enteric\r\n  1860  2344     } and other continued fevers.\r\n  1861  2579     }\r\n  1862  3021     }\r\n  1863  3441     }\r\n  1864  4804[402]}\r\n\r\n                                 Simple   Infantile  Cerebro-Spinal\r\n       Typhus Enteric Relapsing continued Remittent\r\n\r\n  1865  3272    1048     62       839        164        --\r\n  1866  2172    1404     34       249        159        --\r\n  1867  1745    1378     40       105        119        --\r\n  1868  1561    1404     45       100        132        --\r\n  1869  2059    1335     29       121        157        --\r\n  1870  1460    1207    205       151        141        --\r\n  1871  1129    1234    411       108        124        --\r\n  1872   795    1223    115       103        118        --\r\n  1873   628    1495     31       192        117        --\r\n  1874   726    1455     27       104         80        --\r\n  1875   615    1625     17        98         85        --\r\n  1876   471    1448     18        65         88        --\r\n  1877   265    1427      5       164         --        --\r\n  1878   263    1477      2       147         --        --\r\n  1879   210    1013      5       133         --        --\r\n  1880   170    1338      4       155         --        --\r\n  1881   229    1004      0       115         --        --\r\n  1882   180    1204      2        90         --        --\r\n  1883   152     998      1        71         --         7\r\n  1884   138    1050      2        63         --         9\r\n  1885   111     889      1        58         --         8\r\n  1886    80     755      2        62         --        10\r\n  1887   126     835      7        65         --         4\r\n  1888   102     665      6        58         --         6\r\n  1889    69     795      1        45         --         2\r\n  1890    77     777     --        30         --         3\r\n  1891   107     799      4        23         --         6\r\n\r\n\r\nCircumstances of Enteric Fever.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of typhus and relapsing fevers need no general stating\r\nafter what has been said of particular epidemics in England and Scotland,\r\nor remains to be said, for the most distinctive instances of all, in the\r\nchapter on fevers in Ireland. There has been so little typhus in the\r\ncountry at large since the disease began to be registered apart in the\r\nmortality returns, in 1869, that hardly anything can be inferred except\r\nthe fact of its disappearance. It is significant, however, that\r\nSunderland, one of the two great towns which have kept typhus longest and\r\nin largest measure (Liverpool being the other) is distinguished for the\r\novercrowding of its dwelling-houses (7·24 persons to a house in the Census\r\nof 1881, 7·00 in the Census of 1891).\r\n\r\nBut the circumstances of enteric fever are not only not so obvious as\r\nthose of typhus in the historical way; they are also more complex and\r\ndisputable. One fact in the natural history of enteric fever has been made\r\nclear in the chronology, namely, its greater frequency after a severe\r\ndrought. It was in the autumn of 1826, after the driest and hottest summer\r\nof the century, that cases of fever with ulceration of the bowel were\r\nfirst described and figured in London. It was in the autumn of 1846, after\r\nthe next very dry and hot summer, that cases of the same fever again\r\nbecame unusually common in many parts of England and Scotland. The same\r\nsequence has been remarked on more recent occasions and in various\r\ncountries. It is explained by taking into account some other facts in the\r\nnatural history of enteric fever. In nearly all countries in our\r\nlatitudes, autumn is its principal season, and autumn is the season when\r\nthe level of the water in the soil, or in the wells, is lowest. Virchow\r\nstates the law of enteric fever in the following simple and concrete way:\r\n“We [in Berlin] have a certain number of cases of typhoid at all times.\r\nThe number increases when the sub-soil water falls, and decreases when it\r\nrises. Every year, at the time of the lowest level of the sub-soil water,\r\nwe have a small epidemic.” A sharp rise above the mean level of the year,\r\nfrom the first week of September to the end of October, has been well\r\nshown for London from the admissions to the hospitals of the Metropolitan\r\nAsylums Board, 1875-1884. The curve has an equally sharp descent, passing\r\nbelow the mean line of the year in the second week of December[403]. There\r\nare indications that it is the partial filling of the pores of the\r\nsub-soil with water, after they have long been occupied with air only,\r\nthat makes the virus of typhoid active, or, in other words, that the\r\nrains of late summer and autumn are the occasion of the seasonal increase\r\nof the infection.\r\n\r\nYet it is not the changes in the ground-water by themselves, just as it is\r\nnot rainfall and temperature by themselves, that make enteric fever to\r\nprevail. The soil in which those vicissitudes of drought and saturation\r\nare potent for evil must be one that is befouled with animal organic\r\nmatters, more especially with excremental matters. For that and other\r\nreasons (such as the geological formation), enteric fever shows, in its\r\nmore steady or endemic prevalence from year to year or from decade to\r\ndecade, certain marked preferences of locality. Since 1869, when the\r\ndeaths from it began to be registered apart, it has been much more common,\r\nper head of the population, in the quick-growing manufacturing and mining\r\ntowns than in any other parts of England and Wales, the districts with\r\nhighest enteric death-rates being the mining region of the East Coast from\r\nthe mouth of the Tees to somewhat north of the Tyne, the mining region of\r\nGlamorgan, certain manufacturing towns of Lancashire and the West Riding\r\nof Yorkshire, and some districts in the valley of the Trent in\r\nStaffordshire and Nottinghamshire. The following Table shows, by\r\ncomparison with all England and Wales and with London, the excessive\r\ndeath-rates from enteric fever in the registration divisions which head\r\nthe list:\r\n\r\n_Highest mortalities from Enteric Fever in Registration Divisions of\r\nEngland and Wales_[404].\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                           Decennium                     | Decennium\r\n                            1871-80                      |  1881-90\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------|----------\r\n                         |  Annual   |  Annual   |       |\r\n                         |death-rate,|death-rate,|Enteric| Deaths,\r\n                         |all causes,| Enteric,  |Deaths | Enteric,\r\n                         | per 1000  | per 1000  | in 10 |  in 10\r\n                         |  living   |  living   | years |  years\r\n  -----------------------|-----------|-----------|-------|----------\r\n  England and Wales      |   21·27   |    0·32   | 78421 |   53509\r\n    London               |   22·37   |    0·24   |  8536 |    7497\r\n  -----------------------|-----------|-----------|-------|----------\r\n    Durham co.           |   23·77   |    0·56   |  4525 |    2590\r\n    South Wales          |   21·09   |    0·45   |  3715 |    2550\r\n    W.

All the counties of England and Wales have shared in that\r\nnotable decline, including Durham and Glamorgan. But these two great\r\ndistricts of the coal and iron mining are, by the latest returns, still\r\nkeeping the lead; and it is probable that we shall find in them, or in\r\nparticular towns within them, the conditions that have been most\r\nfavourable to enteric fever in the earlier decennia of this century and\r\nare still favourable to it. First it is to be observed that one of the\r\nmost noted of the old typhoid centres in Glamorgan, namely Merthyr Tydvil,\r\nhas ceased to be in that class; its enormous rate of growth has been\r\nchecked (to 18·9 per cent. from 1881 to 1891) and it has at the same time\r\nbecome a more uniform and better-ordered municipality.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, on the same river Taff, and in the tributary valley of\r\nthe Rhondda, there is an immense population of miners, among whom the\r\nenteric fever death-rate will probably be found to have been higher in\r\n1881-90 than in any other registration district. The most populous part of\r\nthe district is the town of Ystradyfodwg, which had 44,046 inhabitants in\r\n1881 and 68,720 in 1891, an increase of over fifty per cent., the highest\r\nurban rate of increase in the country. On the mean of the last three\r\nyears, 1891-93, its enteric fever death-rate has been ·62 per 1000. There\r\nare several populous towns or townships in the mining districts of the\r\nnorth-east which have in like manner kept their high rate of typhoid\r\nmortality--Auckland, Easington, Bellington (Morpeth) and Middlesborough.\r\nIt is held by many that enteric fever has been most characteristically a\r\nproduct of the modern system of closet-pipes and sewers. It is, of course,\r\nthe defects of the system that are, in this hypothesis, to blame,\r\nincluding its partial adoption, the transition-state from the older\r\nsystem, the tardy extension to new streets, as well as cheap and faulty\r\nconstruction. All those things, together with the inherent difficulty of\r\nconnecting with a main sewerage the irregular squattings of a mining\r\ncommunity, are probably to be found in highest degree in those districts\r\nof Durham and South Wales that are most subject to enteric fever. While\r\nenteric fever is in some places steady or endemic from year to year, in\r\nothers its force is felt mostly in great and sudden explosions.\r\n\r\n    One such happened in the city and district of Bangor in the summer of\r\n    1882. The registration district had only 95 deaths from enteric fever\r\n    in the ten years 1871-80, but in the single year 1882 it had 87 deaths\r\n    registered under that name. Of 548 attacks (with 42 deaths) which were\r\n    known from 22 May to 12 September, 407 fell in August and the first\r\n    twelve days of September[407]. In the following year and throughout\r\n    the rest of the decennium the district had its usual low average of\r\n    enteric-fever deaths. One thing relevant to the explosion was probably\r\n    the excessive rainfall of June and July (9·5 inches, as compared with\r\n    4·8 inches about London).\r\n\r\n    Another explosion, probably unique in the history of enteric fever,\r\n    took place at Worthing, on the Sussex coast, in the summer of 1893.\r\n    The enteric death-rate of the town had been much below the average of\r\n    England and Wales from 1871 to 1880, the rate being 0·15 per 1000 and\r\n    the whole deaths in ten years 36. During the next ten years, 1881-90,\r\n    the whole enteric deaths were 43 in the entire registration district\r\n    (population in 1891, 32,394). In 1891 the typhoid deaths were two, in\r\n    1892 they were six. In 1893 a severe outbreak of typhoid took place\r\n    within the municipal borough (population 16,606): In the first quarter\r\n    of the year Worthing was one of the places mentioned for typhoid,\r\n    having had 5 deaths; in April there were no deaths, in May 25, in June\r\n    19, in July 61, in August 64, in September 11, and in the last quarter\r\n    of the year 8, making 193 deaths in the year. The highest weekly\r\n    number of cases notified was 253 in the second week of July. The\r\n    enormously wide dispersion of the poison, in a town little subject to\r\n    enteric fever, caused suspicion to fall on the water-supply, the more\r\n    reasonably that the district of West Worthing, which had a separate\r\n    water-supply, was said not to have suffered from the outbreak. A new\r\n    water-supply was at once undertaken. A relief fund of £7000 was raised\r\n    for the sufferers.\r\n\r\n    The towns of Middlesborough, Stockton and Darlington, in the lower\r\n    valley of the Tees, were together the scene of two remarkable\r\n    explosions of enteric fever, the first from 7 September to 18 October,\r\n    1890, the second from 28 December, 1890, to 7 February, 1891. The\r\n    phenomenal nature of these outbreaks in the autumn and winter of\r\n    1890-91 will appear from the following table of deaths by enteric\r\n    fever:\r\n\r\n                         Darlington  Stockton  Middlesborough\r\n        Ten years 1881-90   104        258        460\r\n                  -----------------------------------\r\n                   1890      21         66        130\r\n                   1891      17         59         93\r\n\r\n    In the first of the two explosions the three towns were almost equally\r\n    attacked per head of their populations; in the second explosion, in\r\n    mid-winter, Darlington had relatively only half as many cases as each\r\n    of the other two, which had about the same number of cases as in the\r\n    former six-weeks’ period. In both periods, of six weeks each, the\r\n    three towns had together 1334 cases of typhoid, while the country\r\n    districts near them had a mere sprinkling. A flooded state of the Tees\r\n    appeared to be a relevant antecedent to each of the explosions. The\r\n    Tees is a broad shallow river flowing rapidly, subject to frequent\r\n    inundations, tortuous in its lower course, forming at its mouth, where\r\n    Middlesborough stands, a wide estuary bordered by low flat grounds.\r\n    The rainfall at Middlesborough was 6·3 inches in August, of which 2·2\r\n    inches fell on the 12th of the month, the river being high in flood\r\n    thereafter. There were again high floods in November, chiefly caused\r\n    by the melting of snow in the upper basin (5 inches fell at Barnard\r\n    Castle in November, 3·1 inches at Middlesborough, while the December\r\n    fall was 1·2 inches at the former and 1·4 inches at the latter). To\r\n    apply correctly the ground-water doctrine of enteric fever to these\r\n    explosions, other particulars would have to be known, more especially\r\n    the extent of the previous dryness of the subsoil (the rainfall at\r\n    Middlesborough was 9·3 inches in the first half of 1890, 15·6 in the\r\n    second half, and below average for the whole year). But the flooded\r\n    state of the Tees valley in August and November must have changed\r\n    abruptly the state of the ground-ferments within the areas of the\r\n    respective towns and so afforded, according to the general law, the\r\n    conditions for an abrupt increase of enteric fever in these its\r\n    endemic or perennial soils[408].\r\n\r\nWhile the more or less steady or endemic prevalence of typhoid fever is\r\ndue to the formation and reproduction in the soil of an infective\r\nprinciple (probably of faecal origin) which affects more or less\r\nsporadically the individuals living thereon, after the manner of a miasma\r\nrising from the ground, there have been some hardly disputable instances\r\nof the infection being conveyed to many at once from a single source in\r\nthe drinking water and by the medium of milk[409]. But such instances,\r\nsuggestive though they be and easy of apprehension by the laity, must not\r\nbe understood as giving the rule for the bulk of enteric fever. In like\r\nmanner, the escape or reflux of excremental gases from pipes or sewers, or\r\nthe leakage into basements or foundations from faulty plumber-work, are\r\ncauses, real no doubt, but of limited application, which do not conflict\r\nwith, as they do not supersede, the more comprehensive and cognate\r\nexplanation of enteric fever as an infection having its habitat in the\r\nsoil and an incidence upon individuals after the manner of other miasmatic\r\ninfections. Sex has little or nothing to do with the incidence of the\r\ninfective virus. As to age, enteric fever rarely befalls infants, and, in\r\nthe general belief of practitioners, is a less frequent cause of death\r\namong children than among adolescents and adults.\r\n\r\n    In the following Table from the Registrar-General’s Decennial Review,\r\n    1871-80, enteric fever is not separated from other continued fevers.\r\n    It is probable that a considerable ratio of the deaths from 0 to 5\r\n    years are due to febrile disorders other than enteric.\r\n\r\n    _Annual Mortality per million living at all ages and at eleven groups\r\n    of ages, males and females, from fever (including Typhus, Enteric\r\n    Fever and Different Forms of Continued Fever) 1871-80._\r\n\r\n                All\r\n               ages   0-   5-  10-  15-  20-  25-  35-  45-  55-  65-  75+\r\n\r\n    Both sexes  484  651  518  439  543  509  411  379  402  458  553  498\r\n    Males       494  644  483  390  513  579  436  395  437  503  629  593\r\n    Females     477  658  550  487  573  445  387  362  369  418  488  425\r\n\r\nThe cases notified under the Act in 1891 and 1892 have been found to\r\naverage five or six for every death registered in the corresponding\r\ndistricts, the rate of fatality ranging widely. It is matter of familiar\r\nknowledge that many of the attacks and fatalities occur among the richer\r\nclasses. New comers to an endemic seat of the disease are most apt to take\r\nit (this has been elaborately shown for Munich, and holds good for the\r\nBritish troops in India). There are undoubtedly constitutional\r\nproclivities to it among individuals, which may run strongly in families.\r\nAs in other miasmatic infective diseases, such as yellow fever, Asiatic\r\ncholera, and (formerly) plague, there seem to be occasions in the varying\r\nstates of body and mind, as well as in the external circumstances, when\r\nthe infection of enteric fever is specially apt to find a lodgement and to\r\nbecome effective. The old plague-books gave lists of the things that were\r\napt to invite venom or to stir venom (see former volume pp. 212, 674); and\r\nit is probable that some of these hold good also for the incidence of\r\nenteric fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFEVER AND DYSENTERY IN IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the public health in Ireland has been so remarkable that it\r\nmay be useful to take a continuous view of it in a chapter apart, so far\r\nas concerns flux, or dysentery, and typhus with relapsing fever.\r\n\r\nIreland is a country which would have given Hume, had he thought of it,\r\nthe best of all his illustrations of the difficult problem handled in the\r\nessay “Of National Characters”--how far the habits, customs, temperaments\r\nand, he might have added, morbid infections have been determined by\r\nclimate, and how far by laws and government, by revolutions in public\r\naffairs, or by the situation of the nation with regard to its neighbours.\r\nNot only is there something special and peculiar in the actual\r\nepidemiology of Ireland, but its political and social history has been apt\r\nto borrow the phrases of medicine in a figure. “First the physicians are\r\nto take care,” says Burke, “that they do nothing to irritate this\r\nepidemical distemper. It is a foolish thing to have the better of the\r\npatient in a dispute. The complaint, or its cause, ought to be removed,\r\nand wise and lenient arts ought to precede the measures of vigour[410].”\r\nAnd this singular use of the imagery of disease in Irish history might be\r\nillustrated from many other passages of the same orator and essayist, just\r\nas it may be seen any day in the columns of newspapers in our own time.\r\nGiraldus Cambrensis began it, within a few years of the first English\r\nconquest of Irish territory by Henry II. Writing of that singular effect\r\nupon the English settlers by contact with the native Irish, whereby they\r\nbecame, in the words of another medieval author, _ipsis Hibernis\r\nhiberniores_, he resorts to the medical figure of “contagion” as the best\r\nway to account for it. So again, to overleap six centuries, Bishop\r\nBerkeley in his query “whether idleness be the mother or daughter of\r\nspleen[411],” is trying upon the Irish both Hume’s problem of national\r\ncharacter and the use of the medical figure. And, to take a modern\r\ninstance, Lord Beaconsfield used the same figure of the old humoral\r\npathology, and gave his adhesion to a theory of national characters\r\nadverse to the sense of Hume, when he ascribed the habits and manners of\r\nthe Irish, and the course of their national history, to their propinquity\r\nto a “melancholy” ocean.\r\n\r\nAs far back as we can go in the history, two diseases are conspicuous--the\r\nflux or “the country disease,” and the sharp fever or “Irish ague.” When\r\nHenry II. invaded Ireland in 1172, his army suffered from flux, which the\r\ncontemporary chronicler, Radulphus de Diceto, dean of St Paul’s, set down\r\nto the unwonted eating of fresh meat (_recentium esus carnium_), the\r\ndrinking of water, and the want of bread[412]. Less than a generation\r\nafter, Giraldus of Wales wrote his “Topography of Ireland,” wherein he\r\nremarks that hardly any stranger, on his first coming to the country,\r\nescapes the flux by reason of the juicy food (_ob humida\r\nnutrimenta_)[413]. At that time Ireland was almost wholly a pastoral\r\ncountry, and a pastoral country it has remained to a far greater extent\r\nthan England or Scotland. It is to this comparative want of tillage, an\r\nalmost absolute want when Giraldus was there, that we shall probably have\r\nto look in the last resort for an explanation of the two national maladies\r\nthat here concern us--the “country disease” and the “Irish ague.” The same\r\ndietetic reason that the dean of St Paul’s gave in 1172 for the prevalence\r\nof flux in the army of Henry II., the want of bread and the eating of\r\nfresh meat, can be assigned for the country disease long after, and, in\r\nsome periods, on the explicit testimony of observers. As to the Irish\r\nague, or typhus fever, Giraldus mentions it in the medieval period; and\r\nHigden, copying him exactly, says: “The inhabitants of Ireland are vexed\r\nby no kind of fever except the acute, and that seldom”--the word _acuta_\r\nbeing the original of “the ague,” or, as in another translation of the\r\npassage, “the sharp axes[414].” In this pastoral country, according to\r\nGiraldus, there was little sickness and little need of physicians; but\r\nthere is hardly an instance of military operations by the English\r\nunattended with sickness among the troops, and famine with sickness among\r\nthe native Irish.\r\n\r\nThe generalities of Fynes Moryson, a traveller of the time of James I.,\r\nwho included Ireland among the many countries that he visited and\r\ndescribed, throw light upon the dietetic peculiarities of the Irish.\r\nHaving little agriculture, and at that time no general cultivation of the\r\npotato (although they adopted it much sooner than the English and Scots),\r\nthey lived, says Moryson, mostly on milk (as Giraldus Cambrensis also\r\nrecords in the twelfth century), and upon the flesh of unfed calves, which\r\nthey cooked and ate in a barbarous fashion. “The country disease” is also\r\nnoted. The experience in Ireland from time immemorial, that a bellyful was\r\na windfall, must have been the origin of a habit observed by Moryson:\r\n\r\n    “I have known some of these Irish footemen serving in England to lay\r\n    meate aside for many meales to devoure it all at one time.” And again:\r\n    “The wilde Irish in time of greatest peace impute covetousnesse and\r\n    base birth to him that hath any corne after Christmas, as if it were a\r\n    point of nobility to consume all within these festivall dayes.” The\r\n    Irish slovenliness or filthiness in their food, raiment and lodging\r\n    was apt, he says, “to infect” the English who came to reside in their\r\n    country[415].\r\n\r\nAbout a generation after we come to the earliest medical account of the\r\nsicknesses of Ireland, by Gerard Boate, compiled during the Cromwellian\r\noccupation[416]. The following occurs under the head of The Looseness:\r\n\r\n    The English have given it the name of the Country Disease. The\r\n    subjects of it are often troubled a great while, but take no great\r\n    harm. It is easily cured by good medicines: “But they that let the\r\n    looseness take its course do commonly after some days get the bleeding\r\n    with it; ... and last it useth to turn to the bloody flux, the which\r\n    in some persons having lasted a great while, leaveth them of itself;\r\n    but in far the greatest number is very dangerous, and killeth the most\r\n    part of the sick, except they be carefully assisted with good\r\n    remedies.”\r\n\r\nThe other reigning disease is the “Irish Ague,” a continued fever of the\r\nnature of typhus:\r\n\r\n    “As Ireland is subject to most diseases in common with other\r\n    countries, so there are some whereunto it is peculiarly obnoxious,\r\n    being at all times so rife there that they may justly be reputed for\r\n    Ireland _endemii morbi_, or reigning diseases, as indeed they are\r\n    generally reputed for such. Of this number is a certain sort of\r\n    malignant feavers, vulgarly in Ireland called Irish agues, because\r\n    that at all times they are so common in Ireland, as well among the\r\n    inhabitants and the natives, as among those who are newly come thither\r\n    from other countries. This feaver, commonly accompanied with a great\r\n    pain in the head and in all the bones, great weakness, drought, loss\r\n    of all manner of appetite, and want of sleep, and for the most part\r\n    idleness or raving, and restlessness or tossings, but no very great\r\n    nor constant heat, is hard to be cured.” If blood-letting be avoided\r\n    and cordial remedies given, “very few persons do lose their lives,\r\n    except when some extraordinary and pestilent malignity cometh to it,\r\n    as it befalleth in some years.” Those who recover “are forced to keep\r\n    their beds a long time in extreme weakness, being a great while before\r\n    they can recover their perfect health and strength.”\r\n\r\nThe occasion of Boate’s writing was the subjugation of Ireland by\r\nCromwell, in the course of which we hear from time to time of sickness.\r\nThe greatest of the calamities was the utter destruction of the prosperity\r\nof Galway by the frightful plague of 1649-50, and by the suppression of\r\nthe Catholics, who had brought the port of Connaught to be a place of\r\nforeign commerce[417].\r\n\r\nCromwell’s troops in 1649 incurred dysentery through the hardships of\r\ncampaigning. On 17 September, 1649, the Lord General writes from Dublin to\r\nMr Speaker Lenthall after the storming of Tredah or Drogheda: “We keep the\r\nfield much; our tents sheltering us from the wet and cold. But yet the\r\ncountry-sickness overtakes many: and therefore we desire recruits, and\r\nsome fresh regiments of foot, may be sent us.” And on 25 October, “Colonel\r\nHorton is dead of the country-disease[418].”\r\n\r\nAnother general reference to the “country disease” of Ireland, by Borlase,\r\nis very nearly the same as Boate’s. It is introduced early in the history,\r\non the occasion of the death in 1591 of Walter, Earl of Essex, earl\r\nmarshal of Ireland:\r\n\r\n    “The dysentery, or flux, so fatal to this worthy person, is commonly\r\n    termed the country disease; and well it may, for it reigns nowhere so\r\n    epidemically as in Ireland; tainting strangers as well as natives. But\r\n    whether it proceeds from the peculiar disposition of the air, errour\r\n    in diet, the laxity and waterishness of the meat, or some occult\r\n    cause, no venomous creature living there to suck that which may be\r\n    thought (in other countries) well distributed amongst reptilious\r\n    animals, I shall not determine, though each of these circumstances may\r\n    well conduce to its strength and vigour. Certain it is that regular\r\n    diet preserves most from the violence, and many from the infection of\r\n    this disease; yet as that which is thought very soveraign--I must say\r\n    that the stronger cordial liquors (viz. brandy, usquebeh, treacle and\r\n    Mithridate waters) are very proper, or the electuaries themselves, and\r\n    the like[419].”\r\n\r\nFrom the Restoration to the Revolution little is known of epidemics in\r\nIreland. It is probable that Dublin and the other considerable towns fared\r\nmuch the same as English towns. A Dublin physician writing to Robert Boyle\r\non 27 February, 1682, speaks of a petechial fever, marked by leaping of\r\nthe tendons, which had been fatal to very many in that city for these\r\ntwelve or fourteen months[420]. With the Revolution the troubles of the\r\ncountry begin again, and enter on their peculiarly modern phase. For our\r\nhistory, two characteristic incidents come at the very beginning of the\r\nnew period of disorder among the Irish--the sicknesses of the siege of\r\nLondonderry and the unparalleled havoc of disease among the troops of\r\nSchomberg in the camp of Dundalk. In both, the old “country disease,”\r\nwhich had affected Cromwell’s troops, was the primary malady, occurring,\r\nof course, in circumstances special enough to have bred it anywhere; in\r\nboth, the dysentery was attended or followed by typhus fever, the old\r\n“Irish ague;” and although the epidemics of Londonderry and Dundalk in\r\n1689 are properly examples of war sickness, yet the circumstances of each\r\nmay help to realize the connexion between dysentery and typhus in the\r\nordinary history of the Irish.\r\n\r\n\r\nDysentery and Fever at Londonderry and Dundalk, 1689.\r\n\r\nThe siege of Londonderry[421] by the Catholic Irish army of James II.\r\nbegan in April and ended on 28 July, having lasted 105 days. On 19 April\r\nthe garrison numbered 7020 men, and the total of men, women and children\r\nin the town was estimated at 30,000, a number which included refugees from\r\nthe neighbouring country and would have been more but for many Protestants\r\nat the beginning of the siege leaving the city and taking “protection” at\r\nthe hands of the besiegers. On 21 May, a collection was made for the poor,\r\nwho began to be in want. Sickness is heard of on 5 June, when several that\r\nwere sick were killed in their beds by the enemy’s bombs. The dread of the\r\nbombs in the houses caused the people to lie about the walls or in places\r\nremote from the houses all night, so that many of them, especially the\r\nwomen and children, caught cold, which along with the want of rest and\r\nfailing food, threw them into fluxes and fevers. The pinch of hunger began\r\nto be felt before the middle of June, about which time and for six weeks\r\nafter the fluxes and fevers were rife. A great mortality spread through\r\nthe garrison as well as the inhabitants; fifteen captains and lieutenants\r\ndied in one day, and it was estimated that ten thousand died during the\r\nsiege, “besides those who died soon after.” The want, the dysentery, the\r\nfever and the vast numbers of dead every day must have produced a horrible\r\nstate of things; when, on 2 July, five hundred useless persons were put\r\noutside the walls, to disperse as they best could, the besiegers are said\r\nto have recognized them when they met them “by the smell.”\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of June large quantities of provisions were found in\r\ncellars and places of concealment under ground; after that the garrison\r\nhad always bread, although the allowance was small. An ingenious man\r\ndiscovered how to make pancakes of starch and tallow, of which articles\r\nthere was no lack; the pancakes not only proved nutritious, but are said\r\nto have been an infallible cure of the flux, or preservative from it. At\r\nlength, on 28 July some of the victuallers and ships of war which had been\r\nin Lough Foyle since the 15th of June, sailed up to the head of the Lough\r\non the evening flood tide, finding little resistance from the enemy’s\r\nbatteries and none from “what was left of” the tide-tossed boom of logs\r\nacross the mouth of the river. Provisions poured in, and the siege was\r\nraised; but it is clear that the infection continued for some time after,\r\nhaving been found among such of the released garrison as repaired to\r\nSchomberg’s camp at Dundalk.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic army is said (by the Protestants) to have lost 8000 or 9000\r\nbefore the walls of Londonderry, “most by the sword, the rest of fever and\r\nflux, and the French pox, which was very remarkable on the bodies of\r\nseveral of the dead officers and soldiers[422].”\r\n\r\nNot far off, at Dundalk, there began, a few weeks after, an extraordinary\r\noutbreak of war-sickness, which, unlike the pestilence in Londonderry, was\r\naltogether inglorious in its circumstances. In many respects it resembled\r\nthe disaster to Cromwell’s troops at the first occupying of Jamaica in\r\n1655-56[423]; but it was worse than that, and it is probably unexampled in\r\nthe military annals of Britain[424].\r\n\r\nSupplies had been voted in Parliament for quelling the Catholic rebellion\r\nin Ireland, and an expedition was got together under the illustrious\r\nMarshal, Duke of Schomberg. The force consisted of some ten thousand foot,\r\nmost of them raw levies from the English peasantry, with one regiment of\r\nseasoned Dutch troops (“the blue Dutch”), and cavalry. While the bulk of\r\nthe force was undisciplined, their clothes, food, tents and other\r\nmunitions of war were bad or insufficient through the fraud of\r\ncontractors. The expedition embarked at Hoylake on the Dee and landed on\r\nthe 15th of August, 1689, nearly three weeks after the relief of\r\nLondonderry, at Bangor, on the south side of Belfast Lough. Schomberg took\r\nCarrickfergus, and began to advance on Dublin; but finding the towns\r\nburned and the country turned into a desert, he threw himself into an\r\nentrenched camp around the head of Dundalk Bay, nearly a mile from the\r\ntown of Dundalk. His camp was on a low moist bottom at the foot of the\r\nhills. The Irish Catholic army took up a position among the hills “on high\r\nsound ground,” not more than two miles distant from the English lines,\r\nand, being in superior force, in due time they offered battle, which was\r\ndeclined. Schomberg, who had been joined by the Enniskillen regiments of\r\ndragoons and by men from Londonderry, had under him some 2000 horse and\r\nnot less than 12,000 foot at the time when James II. offered battle. The\r\nundisciplined state of his English troops and the suspected treachery of a\r\nbody of French Protestants were among the causes that held Schomberg back;\r\nbut he had to reckon also with sickness almost from the moment of sitting\r\ndown at Dundalk. At a muster on 25 September, several of the regiments\r\nwere grown thin “by reason of the distemper then beginning to seize our\r\nmen.” The distemper was dysentery and fever. The two maladies were mixed\r\nup, as they usually are in war and famines, the flux commonly preceding\r\nthe fever, and perhaps affording the virulent matters in the soil and in\r\nthe air upon which the epidemic prevalence of the fever depends. It was\r\neasy to account for the dysentery among the troops at Dundalk; but as to\r\nthe fever, there was an ambiguity at the outset which Story is careful to\r\nnote: “And yet I cannot but think that the feaver was partly brought to\r\nour camp by some of those people that came from Derry; for it was\r\nobservable that after some of them were come amongst us, it was presently\r\nspread over the whole army, yet I did not find many of themselves died of\r\nit.” Where the cause of death is specially named, it is fever, as in the\r\ncases of Sir Thomas Gower, Colonel Wharton and other officers on the 28th\r\nand 29th October. The fever was a most malignant form of typhus, marked by\r\nthe worst of all symptoms, gangrene of the extremities, so that the toes\r\nor a whole foot would fall off when the surgeon was applying a\r\ndressing[425].\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that most of the enormous mortality was caused by\r\ninfection, and not by dysentery due to primary exciting causes.\r\n\r\nThe primary exciting causes were obvious, but seemingly irremovable.\r\nSchomberg had a great military reputation, but he was now over eighty, and\r\nit does not appear that he made himself personally felt in the camp,\r\nalthough he issued incessantly orders to inspect and report. As the\r\nmortality proceeded apace during the six or eight weeks of inactivity,\r\nmurmurings arose against the commander. He was unfortunate in his choice\r\nof a camping ground, and in an unusually cold and wet season. The newly\r\nraised English troops seem to have been lacking equally in intelligence\r\nand in moral qualities. Their foul language and debauchery were the\r\noccasion of a special proclamation; their laziness and inability to make\r\nthemselves comfortable called forth numerous orders, but all to no\r\npurpose. The regiment of Dutch troops were so well hutted that not above\r\neleven of them died in the whole campaign; but the English would not be\r\ntroubled to gather fern or anything else to keep themselves dry and clean\r\nwithal: “many of them, when they were dead, were incredibly lousy.”\r\n\r\nThe camping ground not only received the drainage of the hills, but,\r\nstrange to say, the rain would be falling there all day while the camp of\r\nthe enemy, only a few miles farther inland, would not be getting a drop.\r\nOn 1 October the tents on the low ground were moved a little higher up. On\r\nthe same date there were distributed among the regiments casks of\r\nbrandy--Macaulay says it was of bad quality--which appears to have been\r\nthe trusted remedy against camp sickness, as in the Jamaica expedition of\r\n1655. There were twenty-seven victuallers or other ships riding in Dundalk\r\nBay; but the stores were bad, and the regimental surgeons had come\r\nunprovided with drugs that might have been useful in flux or fever. While\r\nthe weather continued cold and wet, there was also a scarcity of firing\r\nand forage. On 14 October all the regimental surgeons were ordered to meet\r\nat ten in the morning to consult with Dr Lawrence how to check the\r\nsickness[426]. Several officers having died on the 16th and 17th, the camp\r\nwas shifted on the 20th to new ground, the huts being left full of the\r\nsick. Gower’s regiment had sixty-seven men unable to march, besides a good\r\nmany dead before or sent away sick. Story, the chaplain, went every day\r\nfrom the new camp to visit the sick of his regiment in the huts, and\r\nalways at his going found some dead. He found the survivors in a state of\r\nbrutal callousness, utterly indifferent to each other, but objecting to\r\npart with their dead comrades as they wanted the bodies to sit or lie on,\r\nor to keep off the cold wind. The ships at anchor had now received as many\r\nsick as they could hold, and the deaths on board soon became as many as on\r\nshore. On 25-27 October, the camp was again shifted, but the sickness\r\ncontinued apace. At length on 3 November, the Catholic army having\r\ndispersed to winter quarters, the sick were ordered to be removed to\r\nCarlingford and Newry. “The poor men were brought down from all places\r\ntowards the Bridge End, and several of them died by the way. The rest were\r\nput upon waggons, which was the most lamentable sight in the world, for\r\nall the rodes from Dundalk to Newry and Carlingford were next day full of\r\nnothing but dead men, who, even as the waggons joulted, some of them died\r\nand were thrown off as fast.” Some sixteen or seventeen hundred had been\r\nleft dead at Dundalk. The ships were ordered to sail for Belfast with the\r\nfirst wind, and the camp was broken up. There was snow on the hills and\r\nrain in the valleys; on the march to Newry, men fell out of the ranks and\r\ndied at the road side. When the ships weighed anchor from Dundalk and\r\nCarlingford, they had 1970 sick men on board, but not more than 1100 of\r\nthese came ashore in Belfast Lough, the rest having died at sea in coming\r\nround the coast of County Down. Such was the violence of the infection on\r\nboard that several ships had all the men in them dead and nobody to look\r\nafter them whilst they lay in the bay at Carrickfergus. An infective\r\nprinciple, once engendered in circumstances of aggravation such as these,\r\nis not soon extinguished. Belfast was the winter quarters, and in the\r\ngreat hospital there from 1 November, 1689, to 1 May, 1690, there died\r\n3762, “as appears by the tallies given in by the men that buried them.”\r\nThese numbers together make fully six thousand deaths, which agrees with\r\nthe general statement that Schomberg lost one half of the men whom he had\r\nembarked at Hoylake in August. The Irish Catholic army began to sicken in\r\ntheir camp in the hills above Dundalk Bay just before they broke up, and\r\nthey are said to have lost heavily by sickness in their winter quarters.\r\n\r\nThe war ended with the Treaty of Limerick, in 1691. The Seven Ill Years\r\nfollowed,--ill years to Scotland, in a measure to England, and almost\r\ncertainly to Ireland also; but it does not appear that the end of the 17th\r\ncentury was a time of special sickness and famine to the Irish, and it may\r\nbe inferred from the fact of Scots migrating to Ireland during the ill\r\nyears that the distress was not so sharp there. The epidemiology of\r\nIreland is, indeed, a blank until we come to the writings of Dr Rogers, of\r\nCork, in some respects the best epidemiologist of his time, which cover\r\nthe period from 1708 to 1734. His account of the dysentery and typhus of\r\nthe chief city of Munster in the beginning of the 18th century will show\r\nthat the old dietetic errors of the Irish, noted in medieval times, had\r\nhardly changed in the course of centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nA generation of Fevers in Cork.\r\n\r\nRogers is clear that typhus fever was never extinct, while the three\r\nseveral times when it “made its appearance amongst us in a very signal\r\nmanner,” are the same as its seasons in England, namely 1708-10, 1718-21\r\nand 1728-30[428]. His experience relates only to the city of Cork, and, so\r\nfar as his clinical histories go, only to the well-to-do classes therein;\r\nand although those seasons were years of scarcity and distress all over\r\nIreland, yet Rogers does not seem to associate insufficient food with the\r\nfever, and never mentions scarcity. The fevers were in the winter, for the\r\nmost part, and were usually accompanied by epidemic smallpox of a bad\r\ntype, which in 1708 “swept away multitudes.” Nothing is said of dysentery\r\nfor the earliest of the three fever-periods; but for 1718 and following\r\nyears we read that “dysentery of a very malignant sort, frequently\r\nproducing mortification in the bowels,” prevailed during the same space;\r\nand that the winters of the third fever-period, namely, those of 1728,\r\n1729 and 1730 were “infamous for bloody fluxes of the worst kind.” It is\r\nclear that the fever spread to the richer classes in Cork, for his five\r\nclinical histories are all from those classes. The following is his\r\ngeneral account of the symptoms:\r\n\r\n    The patient is suddenly seized with slight horrors or rather\r\n    chilliness, to which succeed a glowing warmth, a weight and fixed pain\r\n    in the head, just over the eyebrows; soreness all over his flesh, as\r\n    if bruised, the limbs heavy, the heart oppressed, the breathing\r\n    laboured, the pulse not much altered, but in some slower; the urine\r\n    mostly crude, pale and limpid, at first, or even throughout, the\r\n    tongue moist and not very white at first, afterwards drier, but rarely\r\n    black. An universal petechial effloresence not unlike the measles\r\n    paints the whole surface of the body, limbs, and sometimes the very\r\n    face; in some few appear interspersed eruptions exactly like the\r\n    _pustulae miliares_, filled with a limpid serum. The earlier these\r\n    petechiae appear, the fresher in colour, and the longer they continue\r\n    out, the better (p. 5). The fixed pain in the head increasing, ends\r\n    commonly in a coma or stupor, or in a delirium with some. Some few\r\n    have had haemorrhage at the nose, a severe cough, and sore throat. In\r\n    some he had observed a great tendency to sweats, even from the\r\n    beginning: these are colliquative and symptomatic, not to be\r\n    encouraged. In but few there have appeared purple and livid spots, as\r\n    in haemorrhagic smallpox: some as large as a vetch, others not bigger\r\n    than a middling pin’s head, thick set all over the breast, back and\r\n    sometimes the limbs, the pulse in these cases being much below normal.\r\n    The extremities cold from the 6th or 7th day, delirium constant,\r\n    tongue dry and black, urine limpid and crude, oppression greater, and\r\n    difficulty of breathing more. It is a slow nervous fever (p. 18).\r\n\r\nRogers believed that mere atmospheric changes could not be the cause of\r\nthese epidemics: “they may favour, encourage and propagate such diseases\r\nwhen once begun; but for the productive cause of them we must have\r\nrecourse to such morbid effluvia as above described [particles of all\r\nkinds detached from the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms]; or\r\nresolve all into the θεῖον τί so often appealed to by Hippocrates[429].”\r\n\r\nBut, as regards Cork itself, special interest attaches to the following\r\n“four concurring causes:”\r\n\r\n    “1st, the great quantities of filth, ordure and animal offals that\r\n    crowd our streets, and particularly the close confined alleys and\r\n    lanes, at the very season that our endemial epidemics rage amongst\r\n    us.\r\n\r\n    2nd, the great number of slaughter-houses, both in the north and south\r\n    suburbs, especially on the north ridge of hills, where are vast pits\r\n    for containing the putrefying blood and ordure, which discharge by the\r\n    declivities of those hills, upon great rains, their fetid contents\r\n    into the river.\r\n\r\n    3rd, the unwholesome, foul, I had almost said corrupted water that\r\n    great numbers of the inhabitants are necessitated to use during the\r\n    dry months of the summer.\r\n\r\n    4th, the vast quantities of animal offals used by the meaner sort,\r\n    during the slaughtering seasons: which occasion still more mischief by\r\n    the quick and sudden transition from a diet of another kind.”\r\n\r\nIn farther explanation of the fourth concurring cause, he says that in no\r\npart of the earth is a greater quantity of flesh meat consumed than in\r\nCork by all sorts of people during the slaughtering season--one of the\r\nchief industries of the place being the export of barrelled beef for the\r\nnavy and mercantile marine. The meat, he says, is plentiful and cheap, and\r\ntempts the poorer sort “to riot in this luxurious diet,” the sudden change\r\nfrom a meagre diet, with the want of bread and of fermented liquors, being\r\ninjurious to them[430].\r\n\r\n\r\nFamine and Fevers in Ireland in 1718 and 1728.\r\n\r\nThus far Rogers, for the city of Cork in the three epidemic periods,\r\n1708-10, 1718-21, and 1728-30, two of which, if not all three, were\r\nperiods of dysentery as well as of typhus. But it was usual in Ireland for\r\nthe country districts and small towns to suffer equally with the cities.\r\nThe circumstances of the Irish peasantry in the very severe winter of\r\n1708-9 are not particularly known; if there was famine with famine-fever,\r\nit was not such as to have become historical. But for the next\r\nfever-period, 1718-20, we have some particulars. Bishop Nicholson, of\r\nDerry, writes: “Never did I behold even in Picardy, Westphalia or\r\nScotland, such dismal marks of hunger and want as appeared he\r\ncountenances of most of the poor creatures I met with on the road.” One of\r\nthe bishop’s carriage horses having been accidentally killed, it was at\r\nonce surrounded by fifty or sixty famished cottagers struggling\r\ndesperately to obtain a morsel of flesh for themselves and their\r\nchildren[431].\r\n\r\nThis was a time when the population was increasing, but agriculture, so\r\nfar from increasing in proportion to the number of mouths to feed, was\r\npositively declining, unless it were the culture of the potato. In a\r\npamphlet of about 1724, on promoting agriculture and employing the poor,\r\nthe complaint is of beef and mutton everywhere, and an insufficiency of\r\ncorn. “Such a want of policy,” says one, “is there, in Dublin especially,\r\non the most important affair of bread, without a plenty of which the poor\r\nmust starve.” Another, a Protestant, has the following threat for the\r\nclergymen of the Established Church: “I’ll immediately stock one part of\r\nmy land with bullocks, and the other with potatoes--so farewell\r\ntithes[432]!” From this it is to be inferred that potatoes were not made\r\ntithable until a later period, pasture being exempted to the last. For\r\nwhatever reason, grazing, and not corn-growing, was then more general in\r\nIreland than in the generations immediately preceding, much land having\r\ngone out of tillage. The culture of the potato was driven out of the\r\nfertile lowlands to the hill-sides, so as to leave the ground clear for\r\nranges of pasture. Rack-renting was the rule, doubtless owing to the same\r\nreason as afterwards, the competition for farms. While the Protestants\r\nemigrated in thousands, the Catholics multiplied at home in beggary. A\r\npamphleteer of 1727 says: “Where the plough has no work, one family can do\r\nthe business of fifty, and you may send away the other forty-nine.” Thus\r\nwe find the pasturing of cattle preferred to agriculture long after the\r\nbarbaric or uncivilized period had passed, preferred indeed by English\r\nlandlords or farmers[433].\r\n\r\nThere were three bad harvests in succession, 1726, 1727 and 1728,\r\nculminating in a famine in the latter year. Boulter, archbishop of Armagh,\r\nwho then ruled Ireland, was able to buy oats or oatmeal in the south and\r\nwest so as to sell it below the market price to the starving Protestants\r\nof Ulster, an interference with the distribution of food which led to\r\nserious rioting in Cork, Limerick, Clonmel and Waterford in the first\r\nmonths of 1728[434]. No full accounts of the epidemic fever of that famine\r\nremain. Rutty, of Dublin, says it was “mild and deceitful in its first\r\nattack, attended with a depressed pulse, and frequently with\r\npetechiae[435];” while, according to Rogers and O’Connell[436], the\r\nepidemic fever of Munster was the same. Of the famine itself we have a\r\nglimpse or two. Primate Boulter writes to the Duke of Newcastle on 7\r\nMarch, 1727:\r\n\r\n    “Last year the dearness of corn was such that thousands of families\r\n    quitted their habitations to seek bread elsewhere, and many hundreds\r\n    perished; this year the poor had consumed their potatoes, which is\r\n    their winter subsistence, near two months sooner than ordinary, and\r\n    are already, through the dearness of corn, in that want that in some\r\n    places they begin already to quit their habitations[437].”\r\n\r\nQuitting their habitations to beg was a regular thing at a later time of\r\nthe year. It was in the course of these bad years, in 1729, that Swift\r\nwrote his ‘Modest Proposal for preventing the Children of Poor People in\r\nIreland from being a Burden to their Parents or Country.’ The scheme to\r\nuse the tender babes as delicate morsels of food for the rich, was a\r\nsomewhat extreme flight of irony, not so finished as in Swift’s other\r\nsatires, but the circumstances out of which the proposal grew were more\r\nreal than usual.\r\n\r\n    “It is a melancholy object,” says the Dean of St Patrick’s, “to those\r\n    who walk through this great town, or travel in the country, when they\r\n    see the streets, the roads and cabin doors crowded with beggars of the\r\n    female sex followed by three, four, or six children, all in rags, and\r\n    importuning every passenger for an alms.” Having ventilated his\r\n    project for the children, he proceeds to show that “their elders are\r\n    every day dying and rotting by cold and famine, filth and vermin, as\r\n    fast as can be reasonably expected.”\r\n\r\nAll the while there was a considerable export of corn from Ireland. In the\r\nbeginning of 1730, two ships laden with barley were stopped at Drogheda by\r\na fierce mob and were compelled to unload[438].\r\n\r\nThe interval between those years of epidemic typhus in Ireland and the\r\nnext, 1740-41, was filled, we may be sure, with at least an average amount\r\nof the endemial fever. Rutty specially mentions it in Dublin in the autumn\r\nand winter of 1734-35: “We had the low fever, called nervous (and\r\nsometimes petechial from the spots that frequently attended, although\r\nprobably not essential).” He then adds: “It is no new thing with us for\r\nthis low kind of fever to prevail in the winter season;” and gives figures\r\nfrom the Dublin Bills of Mortality for forty years. He mentions the\r\npetechial fever as being frequent next in January and February, 1736,\r\ncorresponding to a bad time of it in Huxham’s Plymouth annals. In 1738 and\r\n1739 the type of the Dublin fever was relapsing, in part at least, the\r\nsame type having been seen at Edinburgh shortly before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe economics of Ireland, at this time, gave occasion to Berkeley’s\r\n_Querist_, a series of weekly essays written in 1737 and 1738, and\r\ncollected in 1740, on the eve of the next great famine and mortality[439].\r\nA few of the bishop’s sarcasms, in the form of queries, will serve to show\r\nhow anomalous was the economic condition of the country, and how easily a\r\ncrisis of famine and pestilence could arise.\r\n\r\n    “169. Whether it is possible the country should be well improved while\r\n    our beef is exported, and our labourers live upon potatoes?\r\n\r\n    “173. Whether the quantities of beef, butter, wool and leather,\r\n    exported from this island, can be reckoned the superfluities of a\r\n    country, where there are so many natives naked and famished?\r\n\r\n    “174. Whether it would not be wise so to order our trade as to export\r\n    manufactures rather than provisions, and of those such as employ most\r\n    hands?\r\n\r\n    “466. Whether our exports do not consist of such necessaries as other\r\n    countries cannot well be without?\r\n\r\n    “353. Whether hearty food and warm clothing would not enable and\r\n    encourage the lower sort to labour?\r\n\r\n    “354. Whether in such a soil as ours, if there was industry, there\r\n    would be want?\r\n\r\n    “418. Whether it be not a new spectacle under the sun, to behold in\r\n    such a climate and such a soil, and under such a gentle government, so\r\n    many roads untrodden, fields untilled, houses desolate, and hands\r\n    unemployed?\r\n\r\n    “514. Whether the wisdom of the State should not wrestle with this\r\n    hereditary disposition of our Tartars, and with a high hand introduce\r\n    agriculture?\r\n\r\n    “534. Why we do not make tiles of our own, for flooring and roofing,\r\n    rather than bring them from Holland?\r\n\r\n    “539. Whether it be not wonderful that with such pastures, and so many\r\n    black cattle, we do not find ourselves in cheese?”\r\n\r\nIn several of his queries (381, 383) Bishop Berkeley is driving at the\r\nexpediency of domestic slavery. It was two hundred years since the same\r\nexpedient had been tried by Protector Somerset in England, during the\r\nintolerable state of vagabondage which followed the rage for pasture\r\nfarming under the first Tudors. In Scotland, it was hardly more than a\r\ngeneration since the institution of domestic slavery had commended itself\r\nto Fletcher of Saltoun, as the only expedient that could free that country\r\nfrom the vagabondage of a tenth, or more, of the population. England had\r\nsurmounted the difficulty long ago, Scotland got over it easily and\r\nspeedily when she was admitted to the English and colonial markets for her\r\nlinen manufacture by the Treaty of Union[440]. But in Ireland in the year\r\n1740, and until long after, disabilities of all kinds, not only economic,\r\nbut political and religious, were fastened upon the weaker nation by the\r\nstronger, the unfortunate cause of their long continuance having been the\r\ncostly inheritance of loyalty to James II. and the Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Famine and Fever of 1740-41.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the bishop of Cloyne was issuing his economic queries\r\nfrom week to week (not much to the satisfaction of Primate Boulter),\r\nthings were making up for the greatest crisis of famine and pestilence\r\nthat Ireland experienced in the 18th century. There had been relapsing\r\nfever among the poor in Dublin in the autumn of 1738, and it appeared\r\namong them again in the summer and autumn of 1739. Rutty’s account of it\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n    “It was attended with an intense pain in the head. It terminated\r\n    sometimes in four, for the most part in five or six days, sometimes in\r\n    nine, and commonly in a critical sweat. It was far from being mortal.\r\n    I was assured of seventy of the poorer sort at the same time in this\r\n    fever, abandoned to the use of whey and God’s good providence, who all\r\n    recovered. The crisis, however, was very imperfect, for they were\r\n    subject to relapses, even sometimes to the third time, nor did their\r\n    urine come to a complete separation.”\r\n\r\nIn October 1739, there appeared some dysenteries in Dublin.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1739 set in severely with cold and wet in November, and\r\nabout Christmas there began a frost of many weeks’ duration which was\r\nmore intense than anyone remembered. It is said to have made the ground\r\nlike iron to the depth of nine inches; the ice on all the rivers stopped\r\nthe corn mills, trees and shrubs were destroyed, and even the wool fell\r\nout of the sheep’s backs. In January 1740 the destitution was such that\r\nsubscription-lists were opened in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford,\r\nClonmel, Wexford and other places. Bishop Berkeley distributed every\r\nMonday morning twenty pounds sterling among the poor of Cloyne (near Cork)\r\nbesides what they got from his kitchen. One morning he came down without\r\npowder on his wig, and all the domestics of the episcopal palace followed\r\nsuit[441]. The distress became more acute as the spring advanced. The\r\npotato crop of 1739 had been ruined, not by disease as in 1845-46, but by\r\nthe long and intense frost. It was usual at that time to leave the tubers\r\nin the ridges through most of the winter, with the earth heaped up around\r\nthem. The frost of December found them with only that slight covering, and\r\nrotted them: “a dirissimo hoc et diuturno gelu penitus putrescebant,” says\r\nDr O’Connell. Besides putrid potatoes, the people ate the flesh of cattle\r\nwhich had died from the rigours of the season. Owing to the want of sound\r\nseed-potatoes, the crop of 1740 was almost a blank. The summer was\r\nexcessively dry and hot. In Dublin, the price of provisions had doubled or\r\ntrebled, and some of the poor had died of actual starvation. In July\r\ndysenteries became common, and extended to the richer classes in the\r\ncapital. Smallpox was rife at the same time, and peculiarly fatal in Cork.\r\nDysentery continued in Dublin throughout the autumn and winter of 1740\r\n(the latter being again frosty), and became the prevailing malady\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nOn 8 February, 1741, Berkeley writes that the bloody flux had appeared\r\nlately in the town of Cloyne, having made great progress before that date\r\nin other parts of the country. A week after he writes (15 Feb.), “Our\r\nweather is grown fine and warm: but the bloody flux has increased in this\r\nneighbourhood, and raged most violently in other parts of this and the\r\nadjacent counties[442].” This prevalence of dysentery, and not of fever,\r\nas the reigning malady of the winter of 1740-41 in Munster is confirmed\r\nby Dr Maurice O’Connell, who says that the typhus of the previous summer\r\ngave place to it. Dysentery in the winter and spring, preceding the fever\r\nof summer, was also the experience in the famine of 1817. Berkeley treated\r\nthe subjects of dysentery, not with tar water, but with a spoonful of\r\npowdered resin dissolved in oil by heat and mixed in a clyster of\r\nbroth[443].\r\n\r\nAs the year 1741 proceeded, with great drought in April and May, typhus\r\nfever (which had appeared the autumn before) and dysentery were both\r\nwidely epidemic, so that it is impossible to say which form of disease\r\ncaused most deaths. In Dublin during the month of March, 1741, the deaths\r\nfrom dysentery reached a maximum of twenty-one in a week, “though it was\r\nless mortal than in the country, to which the better care taken of the\r\npoor and of their food undoubtedly contributed.” Bishop Berkeley writes on\r\nthe 19th of May:\r\n\r\n    “The distresses of the sick and poor are endless. The havoc of mankind\r\n    in the counties of Cork, Limerick and some adjacent places, hath been\r\n    incredible. The nation probably will not recover this loss in a\r\n    century. The other day I heard one from county Limerick say that whole\r\n    villages were entirely depeopled. About two months since I heard Sir\r\n    Richard Cox say that five hundred were dead in the parish where he\r\n    lives, though in a country I believe not very populous. It were to be\r\n    wished that people of condition were at their seats in the country\r\n    during these calamitous times, which might provide relief and\r\n    employment for the poor[444].”\r\n\r\nIt was said that there were twenty-five cases of fever in the bishop’s own\r\nhousehold, which were cured by the panacea, tar-water, drunk copiously--a\r\nlarge glass, milk-warm, every hour in bed, the same method being practised\r\nby several of his poor neighbours with equal success[445]. In a “Letter\r\nfrom a country gentleman in the Province of Munster to his Grace the Lord\r\nPrimate[446]” it is said:\r\n\r\n    “By a moderate computation, very near one-third of the poor cottiers\r\n    of Munster have perished by fevers, fluxes and downright want.... The\r\n    charity of the landlords and farmers is almost quite exhausted.\r\n    Multitudes have perished, and are daily perishing, under hedges and\r\n    ditches, some by fevers, some by fluxes, and some through downright\r\n    cruel want in the utmost agonies of despair. I have seen the labourer\r\n    endeavouring to work at his spade, but fainting for want of food,”\r\n    etc.\r\n\r\nThe loss of life must have been great also in Connaught. A letter of 8\r\nJuly, 1741, from Galway, says: “The fever so rages here that the\r\nphysicians say it is more like a plague than a fever, and refuse to visit\r\npatients for any fee whatever[447].” The Galway Assizes were held at\r\nTuam[448], the races also being transferred to the same neighbourhood, not\r\nwithout their usual evening accompaniments of balls and plays.\r\n\r\nOf this famine and sickness it might have been said, in the stock medieval\r\nphrase, that the living were hardly able to bury the dead[449].\r\n\r\nAs in later Irish famines, there appear to have been, in 1740-41, three\r\nmain types of sickness--dysentery, relapsing fever and typhus fever. In\r\nDublin, as we know from the direct testimony of Rutty, there was relapsing\r\nfever in 1739, before the distress had well begun, and again in the summer\r\nof 1741, when the worst was over. So much is said of dysentery that we may\r\nwell set down to it, and to its attendant dropsy, a great part of the\r\ndeaths, as in the famine of 1846-47. But it is probable that true typhus\r\nfever, sometimes of a malignant type, as at Galway, was the chief\r\ninfection in 1741, which was the year of its great prevalence in England.\r\nIt was characterized by a mild and deceitful onset, like a cold. Spots\r\nwere not invariable or essential; they were mostly of a dusky red,\r\nsometimes purple, and sometimes intermixed with miliary pustules.\r\nO’Connell mentions, for Munster, bleeding from the nose, a mottled rash as\r\nin measles, and pains like those of lumbago. One of the worst features of\r\nthe Irish epidemic of 1740-41 was the prevalence of fever in the gaols. At\r\nTralee above a hundred were tried, most of them for stealing the means of\r\nsubsistence; the gaol was so full that there was no room to lie down, and\r\nfifty prisoners died in six weeks. Limerick gaol had dysentery and fever\r\namong its inmates, and the judge who held the Munster Circuit died of\r\nfever on his return to Dublin[450].\r\n\r\nRutty says that the fever fell most upon strong middle-aged men, less upon\r\nwomen, and least of all upon children. The number of orphans was so great\r\nafter the famine that Boulter, the Anglican primate, seized the\r\nopportunity to start the afterwards notorious Charter Schools for the\r\neducation of the rising generation according to the Protestant creed. In\r\nall the subsequent Irish famines it was the enormous swarms of people\r\nbegging at a distance from their own parishes that spread the infection of\r\nfever; and there seems to have been as much of beggary in 1741, when\r\nIreland was underpeopled with two millions, as in 1817-18, when it was\r\noverpeopled with six millions. A few years after the famine, Berkeley\r\nwrote in 1749:\r\n\r\n    “In every road the ragged ensigns of poverty are displayed; you often\r\n    meet caravans of poor, whole families in a drove, without clothes to\r\n    cover, or bread to feed them, both which might be easily procured by\r\n    moderate labour. They are encouraged in their vagabond life by the\r\n    miserable hospitality they meet with in every cottage, whose\r\n    inhabitants expect the same kind reception in their turn when they\r\n    become beggars themselves.”\r\n\r\nThe estimates of the Irish mortality in 1741 varied greatly, as they have\r\ndone in the Irish famines of more recent times. One guessed a third of the\r\ncottiers of Munster, another said one-fifth; and it is known that, whereas\r\nin Kerry the hearth-money was paid in 1733 by 14,346, it was paid in 1744\r\nby only 9372[451]. The largest estimates are 200,000 deaths or even\r\n400,000 deaths in all Ireland in a population of less than two millions.\r\nBut Dr Maurice O’Connell, who practised in Cork, and saw in Munster the\r\nmortality at its worst, estimated the deaths in all Ireland, in the two\r\nyears 1740 and 1741, from fevers, fluxes and absolute want, at 80,000.\r\nThose who saw the famine, fever and dysentery of 1817-18 in a population\r\nincreased by three times were inclined to doubt whether even the smallest\r\nestimate of 80,000 for 1740-41 was not too large; but it is clear that the\r\nfamished and fever-stricken in the 18th century were in many places\r\nallowed to perish owing to the indifference of the ruling class or the\r\nexhaustion of their means, so that a much higher rate of fatality may be\r\nassumed for that epidemic than for the first of the 19th century Irish\r\nfamines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe distress came to an end before the winter of 1741, when food was so\r\ncheap in Dublin that a shilling bought twenty-one pounds of bread. The\r\nsubsequent prevalence of typhus fever and dysentery in Ireland, whether\r\nepidemic or endemic, is very imperfectly known to the end of the century.\r\nIt may be inferred that there was in that period no epidemic so great as\r\nthat of 1740-41; but it is clear from the records kept by Rutty in Dublin\r\ndown to 1764, and by Sims in Tyrone to 1772, that the indigenous fevers\r\nand fluxes of the country were never long absent, being more common in\r\nsome years than in others[452].\r\n\r\nThe year 1744 was remarkable for a destructive throat distemper among\r\nchildren, described elsewhere, and the year 1745 for smallpox dispersed by\r\nswarms of beggars. In 1746 and 1748, the Dublin fever was relapsing in\r\npart, “terminating,” says Rutty, “the fifth, sixth, seventh or eighth day\r\nwith a critical sweat. A relapse commonly attended, which however was\r\ncommonly carried off by a second critical sweat.” In 1748, though the\r\nseason was sickly, the diseases were not mortal, several of the fevers\r\nbeing “happily terminated by a sweat the fifth or sixth day.” But there\r\nwere also fevers of the low kind, sometimes with petechiae, sometimes with\r\nmiliary pustules, though not essentially with either. In the autumn of\r\n1754 Rutty begins to adopt the language of the time concerning a “putrid”\r\nconstitution, identifying the fever with the dangerous remittents which\r\nFothergill was then writing about in London; “it is probable that ours was\r\nakin to them and owing to the same general causes.” In February, 1755, the\r\nfevers were fatal to many, raising the deaths to double the usual number;\r\nthey attacked all ages, were of the low, depressed kind, and commonly\r\nattended with miliary pustules. He again identifies them with the low,\r\nputrid fever in London. From that time on to 1758, Rutty has frequent\r\nreferences to the same fever, under the names of low, putrid, petechial\r\nand miliary. It was at its worst in 1757, and was marked by the remarkable\r\ntremors described by Johnstone at Kidderminster, as well as by miliary\r\neruptions and by a gangrenous tendency at the spots where blisters had\r\nbeen applied. In November, 1757, it was fatal to not a few of the young\r\nand strong in Dublin, “and we received accounts of a like malignity\r\nattending this fever in the country[453].” It was still prevalent in the\r\nNorth and West of Ireland in the spring of 1758. He describes also an\r\nunusual amount of fever in the end of 1762. Sims, of Tyrone, an\r\nepidemiologist in the same manner as Rutty, does not begin his full annals\r\nuntil 1765; but he sums up the years from 1751 to 1760 as unhealthy by\r\nagues in spring, dysenteries and cholera morbus in autumn, and “low,\r\nputrid or nervous fevers throughout the year[454].” He adds:\r\n\r\n    “To the unhealthiness of these years the bad state and dearth of\r\n    provisions might not a little contribute; the poor, being incapable to\r\n    procure sufficient sustenance, were often obliged to be contented with\r\n    things at which nature almost revolted; and even the wealthy could not\r\n    by all their art and power render wholesome those fruits of the earth\r\n    which had been damaged by an untoward season.”\r\n\r\nMuch of the distress, however, was owing to the continual spread of\r\npasture-farming, which made the labour of villagers unnecessary[455].\r\n\r\nThe nearest approach to a great Irish epidemic in the second half of the\r\n18th century was in 1771, as described by Sims, the type of fever being\r\nclearly the same low, putrid or nervous fever, with offensive sweats and\r\nmuscular tremors, that was commonly observed in England also in the middle\r\nthird of the 18th century. Early in the summer of 1771 a fever began to\r\nappear which, as autumn advanced, raged with the greatest violence; nor\r\nwas it overcome by a severe winter. It claimed the prerogative of the\r\nplague, almost all others vanishing from before its presence. It began\r\ntwelve months sooner in the eastern parts of the kingdom, pursuing a\r\nregular course from East to West. Some symptoms suggest cerebro-spinal\r\nfever.\r\n\r\n    The symptoms were languor, precordial oppression, want of appetite,\r\n    slight nausea, pains in the head, back and loins, a thin bluish film\r\n    on the tongue, turbid urine, eyes lifeless and dejected. After the\r\n    fourth day, constant watchfulness, the eyes wild, melancholy,\r\n    sometimes with bloody water in them, constant involuntary sighing, the\r\n    tendons of the wrists tremulous, the pulse quick and weak, most\r\n    profuse sweats, small dun petechiae principally at the bend of the arm\r\n    and about the neck. At the height of the fever, on the ninth or tenth\r\n    day, the tremulousness of the wrists spread to all the members,\r\n    “insomuch that I have seen the bed-curtains dancing for three or four\r\n    days to the no small terror of the superstitious attendants, who on\r\n    first perceiving it, thought some evil spirits shook the bed. This\r\n    agitation was so constant a concomitant of the fever as to be almost a\r\n    distinguishing symptom.” The patients lay grinding their teeth; when\r\n    awake, they would often convulsively bite off the edges of the vessel\r\n    in which drink was given them. They knew no one, their delirium being\r\n    incessant, low, muttering, their fingers picking the bed covering. The\r\n    face was pale and sunk, the eyes hollow, the tongue and lips black and\r\n    parched. Profuse clammy sweats flowed from them; the urine was as if\r\n    mixed with blood: the stools were involuntary. Petechiae almost black\r\n    came out, having an outer circle with an inner dark speck; sometimes\r\n    there were the larger vibices. Bleedings at the nose were frequent.\r\n    Those who were put to bed and sweated almost all died. Death took\r\n    place about the 13th day.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough this disease showed itself even among the middle ranks of\r\nthe people, especially those who lived an irregular life, used flesh diet\r\nand drank much. Among the poorer sort, who used vegetable food, the fever\r\nwas more protracted and less malignant, but in the winter and spring it\r\nmade much greater havoc among them. “Bleeding, that first and grand\r\nauxiliary of the physician in treating inflammatory disorders, seemed here\r\nto lose much of its influence.” It was, indeed, the long prevalence of\r\nthis low or nervous type of fever in Britain and Ireland in the middle of\r\nthe 18th century that drove blood-letting in fevers out of fashion until\r\nthe return of a more inflammatory type (often relapsing fever) in the\r\nepidemic of 1817. In 1770, while such fevers more or less nervous, putrid,\r\nmiliary, were beginning to be prevalent among the adults, there was a good\r\ndeal of “worm fever” among children. They suffered from heat, thirst,\r\nquick, full pulse, vomiting, coma, and sometimes slight convulsions,\r\nuniversal soreness to the touch, and a troublesome phlegmy cough. When not\r\ncomatose they were peevish. The fever was remitting, the cheeks being\r\nhighly flushed at its acme, pale in its remission. It lasted several days,\r\nbut seldom over a week, nor was it often fatal. In children under five or\r\nsix years, it could hardly be distinguished from hydrocephalus\r\ninternus[456]. The same association of the worm fever or remittent fever\r\nof children with the putrid or nervous fever of adults had been noticed at\r\nEdinburgh in 1735. Neither the fever of the adults nor that of the\r\nchildren will be found, on close scrutiny, to have had much in common with\r\nour modern enteric fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Epidemic Fevers of 1799-1801.\r\n\r\nSims left Tyrone to practise as a physician in London, and with his\r\ndeparture what seems to have been the only contemporary record of\r\nepidemics in Ireland ceased. The last quarter of the 18th century in\r\nIreland had probably as much epidemic fever as in England; but it is not\r\nuntil the years 1797-1801 that we again hear of fever and dysentery, on\r\nthe testimony of the records of the Army Medical Board, of the Dublin\r\nHouse of Industry, and of the Waterford Fever Hospital. At the end of the\r\nyear 1796 the health of the regiments in Ireland was everywhere good; but\r\nin December of that year, and in January 1797, the poor in the towns began\r\nto suffer more than usual from fever, and in the course of the year 1797\r\nfever appeared in several cantonments of troops--at Armagh as early as\r\nFebruary or March, at Limerick, at Waterford and in Dublin[457]. The\r\nsummer and autumn were unusually wet, so that the peasantry of the\r\nsouthern and western counties were unable to lay in their usual supply of\r\nturf for fuel. In the course of the winter 1797-98 a considerable increase\r\nof fever and dysentery was remarked among them, and these two maladies\r\nappeared in various regiments in the early months of 1798. This was the\r\nyear of the rebellion in the south-east of Ireland, pending the efforts\r\nfor the union with England. The British troops were much engaged with the\r\ninsurgents throughout the summer, and got rid in great part of the\r\nmaladies of their quarters while they were campaigning. But in the end of\r\nthe year fever began to spread, both among the inhabitants and among the\r\ntroops. It was nothing new for English and Scots regiments to suffer from\r\nfever or dysentery during the greater part of their first year in Ireland;\r\nbut the epidemics in the end of 1798 were more than ordinary. The\r\nBuckinghamshire Militia quartered in the Palatine Square of the Royal\r\nbarracks, Dublin, lost by “malignant contagious fever” 13 men in October,\r\n13 in November, and 15 in December. From November to January, the Warwick\r\nregiment suffered greatly in the same barrack. The Herefordshire regiment,\r\n833 strong, lost 47 men at Fermoy, mostly from fever contracted in bad\r\nbarracks; the Coldstream Guards at Limerick, the 92nd regiment at Athlone,\r\nand the Northamptonshire Fencibles at Carrick-on-Shannon, also lost men by\r\nfever. In July, 1799, not a single regiment in Ireland was sickly; but a\r\nwet and very cold autumn made a bad harvest, aggravating the distresses of\r\nthe poor and causing much sickness, which the troops shared. The county of\r\nWexford, the principal scene of the rebellion, suffered most, and next to\r\nit the adjacent county of Waterford. The fever-hospital of the latter\r\ntown, the earliest in Ireland[458], was projected in 1799; the statement\r\nmade in the report of a plan for the new charity, that fifteen hundred\r\ndependent persons suffered from contagious fever every year there, showed\r\nthat the need for it was nothing new, although hardly a tenth part of the\r\nnumber sought admission to the hospital when it was at work. Next year,\r\n1800, the managers of the newly-opened hospital gave some particulars of\r\nthe causes of fever in Waterford--want of food, causing weakness of body\r\nand depression of mind, but above all the excessive pawning of clothes and\r\nbedding, whereby they suffered from cold and slept for warmth several in a\r\nbed. In the winter and spring of 1799-1800 the poor of Waterford had\r\nepidemic among them fever and dysentery, as well as smallpox. In\r\nDonagh-a-gow’s Lane nine persons died of dysentery between October 1799\r\nand March 1800. The harvest of 1800 was again a failure, from cold and\r\nwet, bread and potatoes being dear and of bad quality. In the autumn and\r\nwinter the distress, with the attendant fever and dysentery, became worse.\r\nAt that time in Dublin all fever cases among the poor were received into\r\nthe House of Industry (the Cork Street and Hardwick Hospitals were soon\r\nafter built for fever-cases), at which the deaths for four years were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n          Died in the Dublin\r\n  Year    House of Industry\r\n\r\n  1799         627\r\n  1800        1315\r\n  1801        1352\r\n  1802         384\r\n\r\nThe enormous rise of the deaths in 1800 and 1801 shows how severe the\r\nepidemic of fever must have been. Compared with the epidemic of 1817-18,\r\nit has few records, perhaps because the political changes of the union\r\nengrossed all attention. But the significant fact remains that the deaths\r\nin the Dublin House of Industry in 1800 and 1801 were nearly as many as in\r\nall the special fever-hospitals of Dublin during the two years, 1 Sept.\r\n1817 to 1 Sept. 1819. At Cork, in 1800, there were 4000 cases of fever\r\ntreated from the Dispensary; at Limerick the state of matters is said to\r\nhave been as bad as in the great famine of 1817-18; and there is some\r\nreason to think that the same might have been said of other places. All\r\nthe relief in 1800-1801 came from private sources, the example of Dublin\r\nin opening soup-kitchens having been followed by other towns. The troops\r\nshared in the reigning diseases, especially at Belfast and Dublin; in the\r\nlatter city, the spotted fever was severe both among the military and all\r\nranks of the civil population in August, 1801. The harvest of 1801 was\r\nabundant, and the fever quickly declined. It had been often of the\r\nrelapsing type[459]. Dysentery appeared in the end of September, and\r\nbecame severe in many places in October and November, being attributed to\r\nthe rains after a long tract of dry, hot weather. Ophthalmias and\r\nscarlatinal malignant sore-throats were common at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Growth of Population in Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhen the history of the great famine and epidemic sicknesses of 1817-18\r\nwas written, it was found that this calamity had fallen upon a population\r\nthat had grown imperceptibly until it had reached the enormous figure of\r\nover six millions, the census of 1821 showing the inhabitants of Ireland\r\nto be 6,801,827. The increase from an estimated one million and\r\nthirty-four thousand in 1695 was, according to Malthus, probably without\r\nparallel in Europe. According to Petty, the inhabitants in 1672 numbered\r\nabout one million one hundred thousand, living in two hundred thousand\r\nhouses, of which 160,000 were “wretched, nasty cabins without chimney,\r\nwindow or door-shut, and wholly unfit for making merchantable butter,\r\ncheese, or the manufacture of woollen, linen or leather.” In 1695, the war\r\non behalf of James II. having intervened, the population as estimated by\r\nSouth was 1,034,000. When the people were next counted in 1731, by a not\r\nincorrect method in the hands of the magistracy and Protestant clergy,\r\nthey were found to have almost doubled, the total being 2,010,221. This\r\nincrease, the exactness of which depends naturally upon the accuracy of\r\nPetty’s and South’s 17th century estimates, had been made notwithstanding\r\nthe famines and epidemics of 1718 and 1728, and an excessive emigration,\r\nmostly of Protestants, to the West Indian and American colonies, which was\r\nitself attended by a great loss of life through disease. For the rest of\r\nthe 18th century, the estimates of population are based upon the number of\r\nhouses that paid the hearth-tax. In the following figures six persons are\r\nreckoned to each taxed hearth:\r\n\r\n  Year    Persons\r\n\r\n  1754   2,372,634\r\n  1767   2,544,276\r\n  1777   2,690,556\r\n  1785   2,845,932\r\n\r\nThe hearth-money was not altogether a safe basis of reckoning, for the\r\nreason that many were excused it on account of their poverty by\r\ncertificate from the magistrates, and that hamlets in the hills, perhaps\r\nthose which held their lands in rungale or joint-lease, often compounded\r\nwith the collectors for a fixed sum; so that cabins might multiply and no\r\nmore hearth-tax be paid[460]. It is probable that a considerable increase\r\nhad taken place which was not represented in the books of the\r\ntax-collectors; for in 1788, only three years from the last date given,\r\nthe number of hearths suddenly leapt up to the round figure of 650,000\r\n(from 474,322), giving a population of 3,900,000, at the rate of six\r\npersons to a cabin or house. But it is undoubted that a new impulse was\r\ngiven to population in the last twenty years of the 18th century, firstly\r\nby the bounties on Irish corn exported, dating from 1780, which caused\r\nmuch grazing land to be brought under the plough, and secondly by the\r\ngradual removal, after 1791, of various penalties and disabilities which\r\nhad rested on the Roman Catholics since the reign of Anne, affecting their\r\ntenure of land, and serving in various ways to repress the multiplication\r\nof families. Accordingly we find the hearths rated in 1791 at the number\r\nof 701,102, equal to a population of 4,206,612. The estimates or\r\nenumerations from 1788, to the census of 1831, show an increase as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Year    Persons\r\n\r\n  1788   3,900,000\r\n  1791   4,206,612\r\n  1805   5,395,456\r\n  1812   5,937,856\r\n  1821   6,801,827\r\n  1831   7,784,539\r\n\r\nThe secret of this enormous increase was the habit that the Irish\r\npeasantry had begun to learn early in the 17th century of living upon\r\npotatoes. From that dietetic peculiarity, it is well known, much of the\r\neconomic and political history of Ireland depends. At the time when it was\r\nlosing its tribal organization (rather late in the day, although not so\r\nlate as in the Highlands of Scotland), the country was in a fair way to\r\npass from the pastoral state to the agricultural and industrial. It is\r\nconceivable that, if Ireland had peacefully become an agricultural\r\ncountry, wheaten bread would have become the staple food of the people, as\r\nin England in early times and again in later times; or that the standard\r\nmight have been oatmeal in the northern province, as in Scotland: in which\r\ncase one may be sure that the population would not have increased as it\r\ndid. “Since the culture of the potatoes was known,” says a topographer of\r\nKerry in 1756, “which was not before the beginning of the last century,\r\nthe herdsmen find out small dry spots to plant a sufficient quantity of\r\nthose roots in for their sustenance, whereby considerable tracts of these\r\nmountains are grazed and inhabited, which could not be done if the\r\nherdsmen had only corn to subsist on[461].” Twenty years later Arthur\r\nYoung found an enormous extension of potato culture, the pigs being fed on\r\nthe surplus crop[462]. The motive, on the part of the landlord or the\r\nfarmer, was to have the peat bogs on the hill-sides reclaimed by the\r\nspade; the surface of peat having been removed, a poor subsoil was\r\nexposed, which might be made something of after it had grown several crops\r\nof potatoes, but hardly in any other way. Another motive was political;\r\nnamely, the multiplication by landlords of forty-shilling freeholder\r\ndependent votes among the Catholics as soon as they became free to\r\nexercise the franchise[463].\r\n\r\nMalthus relied so much upon statistics, that he found the case of Ireland,\r\nnotable though it was, little suited to his method, and dismissed it in a\r\nfew sentences. But he indicated correctly the grand cause of\r\nover-population:\r\n\r\n    “I shall only observe, therefore, that the extended use of potatoes\r\n    has allowed of a very rapid increase of population during the last\r\n    century (18th). But the cheapness of this nourishing root, and the\r\n    small piece of ground which, under this kind of cultivation, will in\r\n    average years produce the food for a family, joined to the ignorance\r\n    and depressed state of the people, which have prompted them to follow\r\n    their inclinations with no other prospect than an immediate bare\r\n    subsistence, have encouraged marriage to such a degree that the\r\n    population is pushed much beyond the industry and present resources of\r\n    the country; and the consequence naturally is, that the lower classes\r\n    of people are in the most impoverished and miserable state.”\r\n\r\nIn another section he showed that the cheapness of the staple food of\r\nIreland tended to keep down the rate of wages:\r\n\r\n    “The Irish labourer paid in potatoes has earned perhaps the means of\r\n    subsistence for double the number of persons that could be supported\r\n    by an English labourer paid in wheat.... The great quantity of food\r\n    which land will bear when planted with potatoes, and the consequent\r\n    cheapness of the labour supported by them, tends rather to raise than\r\n    to lower the rents of land, and as far as rent goes, to keep up the\r\n    price of the materials of manufacture and all other sorts of raw\r\n    produce except potatoes. The indolence and want of skill which usually\r\n    accompany such a state of things tend further to render all wrought\r\n    commodities comparatively dear.... The value of the food which the\r\n    Irish labourer earns above what he and his family consume will go but\r\n    a very little way in the purchase of clothing, lodging and other\r\n    conveniences.... In Ireland the money price of labour is not much more\r\n    than the half of what it is in England.”\r\n\r\nLastly, in a passage quoted in the sequel, he showed how disastrous a\r\nfailure of the crop must needs be when the staple was potatoes; the people\r\nthen had nothing between them and starvation but the garbage of the\r\nfields[464].\r\n\r\nWhat the growth of population could come to on these terms was carefully\r\nshown for the district of Strabane, on the borders of Tyrone and Donegal,\r\nby Dr Francis Rogan, a writer on the famine and epidemic fever of\r\n1817-18[465]. Strabane stood at the meeting of the rivers Mourne and Fin\r\nto form the Foyle; and in the three valleys the land was fertile. All\r\nround was an amphitheatre of hills, in the glens of which and among the\r\npeat bogs on their sides was an immense population. The farms were small,\r\nfrom ten to thirty acres, a farm of fifty acres being reckoned a large\r\nholding. The tendency had been to minute subdivisions of the land, the\r\nsons dividing a farm among them on the death of the father:\r\n\r\n    “The Munterloney mountains,” says Rogan, “lie to the south and east of\r\n    the Strabane Dispensary district. They extend nearly twenty miles, and\r\n    contain in the numerous glens by which they are intersected so great a\r\n    population that, except in the most favourable years, the produce of\r\n    their farms is unequal to their support. In seasons of dearth they\r\n    procure a considerable part of their food from the more cultivated\r\n    districts around them; and this, as well as the payment of their\r\n    rents, is accomplished by the sale of butter, black cattle, and sheep,\r\n    and by the manufacture of linen cloth and yarn, which they carry on to\r\n    a considerable extent.”\r\n\r\nThese small farmers dwelt in thatched cottages of three or four rooms, in\r\nwhich they brought up large families[466]. Besides the farmers, there were\r\nthe cottiers, who lived in cabins of the poorest construction, sometimes\r\nbuilt against the sides of a peat-cutting in the bog. The following table\r\nshows the proportion of cottiers to small farmers on certain manors of the\r\nMarquis of Abercorn, near Strabane, at the date of the famine in 1817-18\r\n(Rogan, p. 96):\r\n\r\n                   Number of Families\r\n     Manor         Farmers    Cottiers\r\n\r\n  Derrygoon          368        335\r\n  Donelong           243        322\r\n  Magevelin and\r\n  Lismulmughray      319        668\r\n  Strabane           302        415\r\n  Cloughognal        328        279\r\n\r\nThe cottiers rented their cabins and potato gardens from the farmers,\r\npaying their rent, on terms not advantageous to themselves, by labour on\r\nthe farm. For a time about the beginning of the century the practice by\r\nfarmers of taking land on speculation to sublet to cottiers was so common\r\nthat a class of “middlemen” arose. One pamphleteer during the distress of\r\n1822 speaks of the class of middlemen as an advantage to the cottiers, and\r\nregrets that they should have been personally so disreputable as to have\r\nbecome extinct. It is not easy to understand how they served the interests\r\nof the cottiers: for the latter were answerable to the landlord for the\r\nmiddleman’s rent, and were themselves over-rented and underpaid for their\r\nlabour. The system of middlemen did not in matter of fact answer; they\r\nhoped to make a profit from the tenants under them, and neglected to work\r\non their own farms; it appears that they were a drunken class, and that\r\nthey were at length swallowed up in bankruptcy. After the first quarter of\r\nthe century the cottiers and the landlords (with the agents and the tithe\r\nproctors) stood face to face; but at the date of the famine of 1817 there\r\nwas subletting going on, of which Rogan gives an instructive instance in\r\nhis district of Ulster[467].\r\n\r\nUnder this system of subdividing farms and subletting potato gardens with\r\ncabins to cottiers, the following enormous populations had sprung up in\r\nfour parishes within the Dispensary district of Strabane and in four\r\nmanors of the Marquis of Abercorn adjoining them, but not included in the\r\nDispensary District:\r\n\r\n  Town of Strabane                        3896\r\n  Parish of Camus                         2384\r\n     \"   \"  Leck                          5092\r\n     \"   \"  Urney                         4886\r\n  Manor of Magevelin and Lismulmughray    5548\r\n  Manor of Donelong                       3126\r\n     \"  \"  Derrygoon                      2568\r\n     \"  \"  Part of Strabane               2796\r\n\r\nIn the language of the end of the 19th century, this would have been\r\ncalled a “congested district” of Ireland; but all Ireland was then\r\ncongested to within a million and a half of the utmost limit, so that the\r\nfamine, which we shall now proceed to follow in this part of Ulster, has\r\nto be imagined as equally severe in Connaught, in Munster, and even in\r\nparts of Leinster.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Famine and Fevers of 1817-18.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1815-16 had been unusually prolonged, so that the sowing and\r\nplanting of 1816 were late. They were hardly over when a rainy summer\r\nbegan, which led to a ruined harvest. The oats never filled, and were\r\ngiven as green fodder to the cattle; in wheat-growing districts, the grain\r\nsprouted in the sheaf; the potatoes were a poor yield and watery; such of\r\nthem as came to the starch-manufacturers were found to contain much less\r\nstarch than usual. The peat bogs were so wet that the usual quantity of\r\nturf for fuel was not secured[468]. This failure of the harvest came at a\r\ncritical time. The Peace of Paris in 1815 had depressed prices and wages\r\nand thrown commerce into confusion. During the booming period of\r\nwar-prices, from 1803 to 1815, farms and small holdings had doubled or\r\neven trebled in rent, and had withal yielded a handsome profit to the\r\nfarmers and steady work to the labourers. When the extraordinary war\r\nexpenditure stopped, this factitious prosperity came to a sudden end. The\r\nsons of Irish cottiers were not wanted for the war, and the daughters were\r\nno longer profitable as flax-spinners to the small farmers. Weavers could\r\nhardly earn more than threepence a day, and labourers who could find\r\nemployment at all had to be content with fourpence or sixpence, without\r\ntheir food. A stone of small watery potatoes cost tenpence; but the value\r\nof cattle fell to one-third, and butter brought little. By Christmas the\r\nproduce of the peasants’ harvest of 1816 was mostly consumed. “Many\r\nhundred families holding small farms in the mountains of Tyrone,” says\r\nRogan, “had been obliged to abandon their dwellings in the spring of 1817\r\nand betake themselves to begging, as the only resource left to preserve\r\ntheir lives[469].” At Galway, in January, a mob gathered to stop the\r\nsailing of a vessel laden with oatmeal. At Ballyshannon the peasants took\r\nto the shore to gather cockles, mussels, limpets and the remains of fish.\r\nIn some parts the seed potatoes were taken up and consumed. The people\r\nwandered about in search of nettles, wild mustard, cabbage-stalks and the\r\nlike garbage, to stay their stomachs. It was painful, says Carleton, to\r\nsee a number of people collected at one of the larger dairy farms waiting\r\nfor the cattle to be blooded (according to custom), so that they might\r\ntake home some of the blood to eat mixed with a little oatmeal. The want\r\nof fuel caused the pot to be set aside, windows and crevices to be\r\nstopped, washing of clothes and persons to cease, and the inmates of a\r\ncabin to huddle together for warmth. This was far from being the normal\r\nstate of the cottages or even of the cabins, but cold and hunger made\r\ntheir inmates apathetic. Admitted later to the hospitals for fever, they\r\nwere found bronzed with dirt, their hair full of vermin, their ragged\r\nclothes so foul and rotten that it was more economical to destroy them and\r\nreplace them than to clean them.\r\n\r\nSome months passed before this state of things produced fever. The first\r\neffect of the bad food through the winter, such as watery potatoes eaten\r\nhalf-cooked for want of fuel, had been dysentery, which became common in\r\nFebruary, and was aggravated by the cold in and out of doors. It was\r\nconfined to the very poorest, and was not contagious, attacking perhaps\r\none or two only in a large family. Comparatively few of those who were\r\nattacked by it in the country places came to the Strabane Dispensary; but\r\nthe dropsy which often attended or followed it brought in a larger number.\r\nThe following table of cases at the Dispensary shows clearly enough that\r\ndysentery and dropsy preceded the fever, which became at length the chief\r\nepidemic malady[470]:\r\n\r\n_Cases at Strabane Dispensary._\r\n\r\n    1817       Dropsy   Dysentery   Typhus\r\n\r\n  June            23        2         10\r\n  July           107       31         60\r\n  August          40       22        206\r\n  September        9       23        287\r\n\r\nAt a few of the larger towns in each of the provinces typhus had risen in\r\nthe autumn of 1816 somewhat above the ordinary low level which\r\ncharacterized the years from 1803 to 1816 in Ireland as well as in\r\nBritain. At that time there was steadily from year to year a certain\r\namount of typhus in the poorest parts of the towns and here or there among\r\nthe cabins of the cottiers. Statistically this may be shown by the table\r\nof regular admissions to the fever hospitals of some of the chief towns\r\nfrom the date of their opening.\r\n\r\n_Admissions to Irish Fever Hospitals, 1799-1818._\r\n\r\n           Dublin,   Dublin    Cork      Waterford  Limerick   Kilkenny\r\n          Cork St.  House of   Fever       Fever     Fever      Fever\r\n  Year    Hospital  Industry  Hospitals  Hospital   Hospital   Hospital\r\n\r\n  1799       --        --       --          146        --         --\r\n  1800       --        --       --          409        --         --\r\n  1801       --        --       --          875        --         --\r\n  1802       --        --       --          419       446         --\r\n  1803       --        --      254          188        86         73\r\n  1804      415        82      190          223        95         80\r\n  1805     1024       709      200          297        90         69\r\n  1806     1264      1276      441          165        86         56\r\n  1807     1100      1289      191          166        84         81\r\n  1808     1071      1473      232          157       100         96\r\n  1809     1051      1176      278          222       109        116\r\n  1810     1774      1474      432          410       120        135\r\n  1811     1471      1316      646          331       196        153\r\n  1812     2265      2006      617          323       146        156\r\n  1813     2627      1870      550          252       227        183\r\n  1814     2392      2398      845          175       221        236\r\n  1815     3780      2451      717          403       394        249\r\n  1816     2763      1669     1026          307       659        162\r\n  1817     3682      2860     4866          390      2586       1100\r\n  1818     7608     17894    10408         2729      4829       1924\r\n\r\nIn 1812 the first step was taken towards the adoption of the Poor Law,\r\nnamely the division of the country into Dispensary Districts, which\r\nremained the units of charitable relief until 1839, when the old English\r\nsystem of a poor-rate and parochial Unions was applied to Ireland. During\r\nthat intermediate period much was left to the medical profession, which\r\ncontained many well-educated and humane men, to the priests and clergy,\r\nand to charitable persons among the laity. There was fever in many places\r\nwhere there were no fever hospitals. A physician at Tralee reported that\r\nthe back lanes of the town, crowded with cabins, were seldom free from\r\ntyphus. Rogan gives two instances from the Strabane district in the summer\r\nand winter of 1815, at a time when the district was remarkably healthy. A\r\nbeggar boy was given a night’s lodging by a cottier at Artigarvan, three\r\nmiles from Strabane. Next morning he was too ill to leave; he lay three\r\nweeks in typhus, and gave the disease to twenty-seven persons in the eight\r\ncabins which formed the hamlet. A few months after, about a mile from\r\nStrabane, a mother fell into typhus and was visited many times by her two\r\nmarried daughters and by others of her children at service in the\r\nneighbourhood. Nineteen cases were traced to this focus; “but the actual\r\nnumber attacked was probably more than three times this, as the disease,\r\nwhen once introduced into the town, spread so widely among the lower\r\norders as to create general alarm, and led to the establishment of the\r\nsmall fever ward attached to the Dispensary.” It was in April, 1816, that\r\nthis was done, two rooms, each with four beds, having been provided at\r\nStrabane for fever cases; but at no time until the summer of 1817 were\r\nthey all occupied at once.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic really began there in May, 1817, in a large house which had\r\nbeen occupied during the winter by a number of families from the\r\nmountains; they had brought no furniture with them, nor bedding except\r\ntheir blankets, and lay so close together as to cover the floors. Each\r\nroom was rented at a shilling a week, the tenant of a room making up his\r\nrent by taking in beggars at a penny a night. The floors and stairs were\r\ncovered with the gathered filth of a whole winter; the straw bedding,\r\nnever renewed, was thrown into a corner during the day to be spread again\r\nat night. Every crevice was stopped to keep out the cold; the rain came in\r\nthrough the roof, the floors were damp, and the cellars of the house full\r\nof stagnant water turned putrid. Meanwhile more than a fourth part of the\r\nfamilies resident in Strabane, to the number of 1026 persons, were being\r\nfed from a soup-house opened early in the spring of 1817, while there were\r\nothers equally destitute but too proud to ask relief. The rumour of this\r\ncharity soon brought crowds of people from the surrounding country, with\r\ngaunt cheeks, says Carleton, hollow eyes, tottering gait and a look of\r\n“painful abstraction” from the unsatisfied craving for food. In the crowd\r\nround the soup-shop, the timid girl, the modest mother, the decent farmer\r\nscrambled “with as much turbulent solicitation and outcry as if they had\r\nbeen trained, since their very infancy, to all the forms of impudent cant\r\nand imposture.” These soup-shops were opened in all the Irish towns. At\r\nStrabane some of the richer class lent money to procure supplies, for sale\r\nat cost price, of oatmeal, rice and rye-flour, the last being in much\r\nrequest in the form of loaves of black bread.\r\n\r\nThe fever, having begun among the houseful of vagrants above mentioned,\r\nmade slow progress until June, when it spread through the town, and in the\r\nautumn became a serious epidemic. Meantime the soup-kitchen was closed,\r\nthe supplies having ceased, and the country people returned to their\r\ncabins carrying the infection of typhus everywhere with them. By the\r\nmiddle of October, 1817, the epidemic was general in the country round\r\nStrabane.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the rise and decline of the epidemic of typhus\r\nin the town itself.\r\n\r\n_Cases of Fever attended from Strabane Dispensary_[471].\r\n\r\n         1817  1818\r\n\r\n  Jan.     9    83\r\n  Feb.    13    46\r\n  March    6    60\r\n  April   13    48\r\n  May      3    39\r\n  June    10    71\r\n  July    60   106\r\n  Aug.   206    90\r\n  Sept.  287    57\r\n  Oct.   233    49\r\n  Nov.   193    40\r\n  Dec.   140    38\r\n\r\nThe exact particulars from the Dispensary district of Strabane show\r\nclearly how famine in Ireland is related to fever. The epidemic of typhus\r\nwas an indirect result of the famine, and was due most of all to the\r\nvagrancy which a famine was bound to produce in Ireland, in the absence of\r\na Poor Law. In the spring of 1817, said a gentleman near Tralee, “the\r\nwhole country appeared to be in motion.” “It was lamentable,” said Peel,\r\nin the Commons debate, on 22 April, 1818, “at least it was affecting, that\r\nthis contagion should have arisen from the open character and feelings of\r\nhospitality for which the Irish character was so peculiarly remarkable.”\r\nThey gathered also at funerals, and, as Graves said of a later epidemic,\r\nthey were “scrupulous in the performance of wakes.” The concourse of\r\npeople at the daily distributions of soup was another cause of spreading\r\ninfection, many of them having come out of infected houses[472]. Of such\r\nhouses, the lodging-houses of the towns, we have several particular\r\ninstances. At Strabane, there were four such, which sent ninety-six\r\npatients to the fever hospital in eighteen months. At Dublin, a house in\r\nCathedral-lane sent fifty cases to the fever hospitals in a twelvemonth;\r\nthe house No. 4, Patrick’s close sent thirty cases in eight months; No.\r\n52½ Kevin-street sent from five rooms nineteen persons in six weeks.\r\n\r\nThe spread of the disease was much aided by the ordinary annual migration\r\nof harvest labourers. It was the custom every year for cottiers in\r\nConnaught to shut up their cabins after the potatoes were planted, and to\r\ntravel to the country round Dublin in search of work at the hay and corn\r\nharvests, leaving their families to beg; in the same way there was an\r\nannual migration from Clare to Kilkenny, from Cavan, Longford and Leitrim\r\ninto Meath, and from Derry into Antrim, Down and Armagh[473]. In the\r\nsummer of 1817 some parishes of Derry were left with only four or five\r\nfamilies. The keeper of the bridge at Toome, over the Bann, counted more\r\nthan a hundred vagrants every day passing into Antrim, from the middle of\r\nMay to the beginning of July; and the same might have been seen at the\r\nother bridge over the Bann at Portglenone.\r\n\r\nAs the spread of contagion came to be realized, the ordinary hospitality\r\nto vagrants ceased. Rogan was struck with the apathy which at length arose\r\ntowards sick or dead relatives; even parents became callous at the death\r\nof their children (of whom many died from smallpox). “For some time,” he\r\nsays, “it has been as difficult for a pauper bearing the symptoms of\r\nill-health to procure shelter for the night, as it was formerly rare to be\r\nrefused it.” In Strabane they extemporised a poor’s fund by voluntary\r\ncontributions of £30 a month, by means of which eighty poor families were\r\nkept from begging in the streets. In Dublin there was so much alarm of\r\ninfection from the number of beggars entering the shops that trade was\r\nchecked. The following, relating to a town in the centre of Ireland, is an\r\nextreme instance of the panic which the idea of contagion at length\r\ncaused:\r\n\r\n    “In Tullamore, when measures were proposed for arresting the progress\r\n    of fever, by the establishment of a fever hospital, so little was the\r\n    alarm that the design was regarded by most of the inhabitants as a\r\n    well-intentioned project, uncalled for by the circumstances of the\r\n    community. But when the death of some persons of note excited a sense\r\n    of danger, alarm commenced, which ended in general dismay: military\r\n    guards were posted in every avenue leading to this place, for the\r\n    purpose of intercepting sickly itinerants. The town, from the shops of\r\n    which the neighbouring country is supplied with articles of all kinds,\r\n    was thus in a state of blockade. It was apprehended that woollen and\r\n    cotton goods might be the vehicles of infection, and all intercourse\r\n    between the shops and purchasers was suspended. Passengers who\r\n    inadvertently entered the town considered themselves already victims\r\n    of fever. No person would stop at the public inns, nor hire a carriage\r\n    for travelling; in a word all communication between the town and the\r\n    adjacent country was completely interrupted. Apprehension did not\r\n    proceed in most other places to the same extent as in Tullamore[474].”\r\n\r\nSeveral isolated places escaped the epidemic of typhus, either for a time\r\nor altogether. The island of Rathlin, seven miles to the west of Antrim,\r\nwhich was as famished as the mainland, had no typhus at the time when it\r\nwas epidemic along the nearest shore; the island of Cape Clear, at the\r\nsouthernmost point of Ireland, had a similar experience. The whole county\r\nof Wexford, where the soil was dry and the harvest of 1816 had been fair,\r\nkept free from typhus until 1818, partly because it was out of the way of\r\nvagrants. The town of Dingle, at the head of a bay in Kerry, with old\r\nSpanish traditions, was totally free from typhus at a time when its near\r\nneighbour, Tralee, was full of it, the immunity being set down to the\r\nwell-being of the population from their industry at the linen manufacture\r\n(and fisheries) and their thrifty habits. But the counties of Wexford and\r\nWaterford, and other places more or less exempted in 1817, had a full\r\nshare of the epidemic in 1818, which was the season of its greatest\r\nprevalence in most parts of Ireland except Ulster. The harvest of 1817 had\r\nbeen little better than that of the year before, although the potato crop\r\nwas hardly a failure. The fine summer of 1818 brought out crowds of\r\nvagrants who slept in the open, and, when they took the infection, were\r\nplaced in “fever-huts” erected near the roads[475]. The harvest of that\r\nyear was abundant, and by the end of 1818 the epidemic had declined\r\neverywhere except in Waterford.\r\n\r\nThe most carefully kept statistics of the sickness and mortality were\r\nthose by Rogan for the Strabane Dispensary district, and the adjoining\r\nmanors of the Marquis of Abercorn, for each of which a private dispensary\r\nwas established under the care of a physician.\r\n\r\n    Abstract of Returns of the Dispensary district of Strabane, shewing\r\n    the numbers ill of fever from the commencement of the epidemic in the\r\n    summer of 1817, till the end of September, 1818, the numbers labouring\r\n    under the fever at that date, and the mortality caused by the disease\r\n    (Rogan, p. 72).\r\n\r\n                        Population   Ill of Fever   Dead   Remaining ill\r\n\r\n        Town of Strabane    3896         639         59          13\r\n        Parish of Camus     2384         685         61          37\r\n          \"    \"  Leek      5092        1462         96          57\r\n          \"    \"  Urney     4886        1381         86          42\r\n                          ---------------------------------------------\r\n                          16,258        4167        302         149\r\n\r\n    Similar return for those parts of the Marquis of Abercorn’s estates\r\n    not within the Dispensary district:\r\n\r\n                                        Ill of fever\r\n           Manors         Population   (to Oct. 1818)   Dead\r\n\r\n        Magevelin and}\r\n        Lismulmughray}       5548           1666         101\r\n        Donelong             3126           1217          71\r\n        Derrygoon            2568           1215          90\r\n        Part of Strabane     2796            990          75\r\n                           -----------------------------------\r\n        Totals             14,038           5088         337\r\n\r\nThe proportion of attacks in these tables for a part of Tyrone, one-third\r\nto one-fourth of the whole population, is believed to have been a fair\r\naverage for the whole of Ireland. Each attack, with the weakness that it\r\nleft behind, lasted about six weeks; cases would occur in a family one\r\nafter another for several months; in some cottages, says Rogan, only the\r\ngrandmother escaped.\r\n\r\nOne hundred thousand cases were known to have passed through the\r\nhospitals. Harty thought that seven times as many were sick in their\r\ncabins or houses, making 800,000 cases in all Ireland in two years; Barker\r\nand Cheyne estimated the whole number of cases at a million and a half\r\n(1,500,000). The mortality was comparatively small. It comes out greater\r\nin the tables for the Strabane district than anywhere else in Ireland\r\nexcept the hospital at Mallow. The following table, compiled by Harty,\r\nshows how widely the fatality ranged (if the figures can be trusted), from\r\nplace to place and from season to season:\r\n\r\n    Proportions of fatal cases of typhus in the chief hospitals of Ireland\r\n    1817, 1818 and 1819 (Harty)[476].\r\n\r\n                   1817    1818    1819   Average\r\n                  One in  One in  One in  One in\r\n\r\n        Dublin     14½     24      18¼     20\r\n        Kilkenny   16½     14⅚     12⅔     14¼\r\n        Dundalk    20-6/7  54      25      30\r\n        Belfast    19⅕     15⅘     19      17⅓\r\n        Newry      21-1/9  34½     13½     26\r\n        Cork       29      35      35      33⅕\r\n        Limerick   13½     15⅔     30⅔     16½\r\n        Waterford  27⅓     25      23⅓     24⅗\r\n        Clonmel    27      18      18¼     19⅓\r\n        Mallow     22½      9⅗             12\r\n        Killarney  74      67      33      62\r\n        Tralee     20¾     69      43      39\r\n\r\nWhat this meant to particular places will appear from some instances. In\r\nthe parish of Ardstraw, Tyrone, with a population of about twenty\r\nthousand, 504 coffins are stated by the parish minister to have been given\r\nto paupers in eighteen months. The burials were about twice as many as in\r\nordinary years, according to the register of the Cathedral churchyard of\r\nArmagh:\r\n\r\n        1815                  247 burials\r\n        1816                  312   \"\r\n        1817                  571   \"\r\n        1 May-25 Dec. 1818    463   \"\r\n\r\n    Of the 463 burials in eight months of 1818, there were 165 from fever,\r\n    180 from smallpox, and 118 from other causes.\r\n\r\nBarker and Cheyne make the whole mortality of the two years from fever and\r\ndysentery to have been 65,000; Harty makes it 44,300. But not more than a\r\nsixth part of the latter total were registered deaths, and the estimate of\r\nthe whole may be wide of the mark. In the county of Kerry, ten Catholic\r\npriests died of it. Many medical men took it, as well as apothecaries and\r\nnurses, and several physicians died, of whom Dr Gillichan, of Dundalk, a\r\nyoung man of good fortune, made a notable sacrifice of his life. Everyone\r\nbore willing testimony to the devotion of the Roman Catholic clergy. Some\r\nharrowing incidents were reported, such as those from Kanturk, in county\r\nCork:\r\n\r\n    Dr O’Leary visited a low hut in which lay a father and three children:\r\n    “There were also two grown-up daughters who were obliged to remain for\r\n    several nights in the open air, not having room in the hut till the\r\n    father died, when the stronger of the two girls forced herself into\r\n    his place. On the road leading to Cork, within a mile of this town, I\r\n    visited a woman of the name of Vaughan, labouring under typhus; on her\r\n    left lay a child very ill, at the foot of the bed another child just\r\n    able to crawl about, and on her right the corpse of a third child, who\r\n    had died two days previously, and which the unhappy mother could not\r\n    get removed. When the grant arrived from Government, I visited a man\r\n    of the name of Brahill near the chapel gate, who with his wife and six\r\n    children occupied a very small house, all of them ill of fever with\r\n    the exception of one boy, who was so far convalescent as to creep to\r\n    the door to receive charity from the passengers.”\r\n\r\n    Infants rarely took the fever. Dr Osborne, of Cork, stated that in one\r\n    instance a physician in attendance on the poor had to separate two\r\n    children from the bed of their dead brother, the father and mother\r\n    being already in a fever hospital; in another instance, he had to\r\n    remove an infant from the corpse of its mother who had just expired in\r\n    a hovel[477].\r\n\r\nNosologically the epidemic of 1817-18 presented several features of\r\ninterest. It began with dysentery, and ended with the same in autumn,\r\n1818. It was in great part typhus, but towards the end of the epidemic,\r\nin Dublin, at Strabane, and doubtless elsewhere, it changed to relapsing\r\nfever, that is to say, the sick person “got the cool” about the fifth or\r\nseventh day instead of the tenth or twelfth, but was apt to have one or\r\nmore relapses or recurrences of the fever. The relapsing type was milder\r\nin its symptoms and was more rarely fatal. The average fatality of typhus\r\nwas much less than in ordinary years, while a good many of the fatal cases\r\ncame from the richer classes, to whom the contagion reached, the\r\nproportion of fatalities among them being noted everywhere as very high,\r\nup to one death in three or four cases[478]. The fatalities were most\r\ncommon, as usual, at ages from forty to sixty. A full share of the women\r\nand children took the fever, perhaps an excess of women, allowing for\r\ntheir excess in the population. The following were the numbers at each\r\nperiod of life among 18,891 cases treated in the hospitals of Dublin and\r\nWaterford:\r\n\r\n  Years of age  1-10  10-20  20-30  30-40  40-50  50 and over\r\n\r\n  Cases         2426  6116    5230   2476   1415    1228\r\n\r\nThe action of the English Government was thought by some to have been\r\napathetic. Nothing was done to check the export of corn from Irish ports.\r\nPeel, who held the office of Irish Secretary in 1817, was probably\r\nactuated in this by the same constitutional and economic considerations\r\nwhich led him, as Prime Minister in 1845, to refuse O’Connell’s demand for\r\na proclamation against the export of corn.\r\n\r\nCarleton says that there were scattered over the country “vast numbers of\r\nstrong farmers with bursting granaries and immense haggards,” and that\r\nlong lines of provision carts on their way to the ports met or\r\nintermingled with the funerals on the roads, the sight of which\r\nexasperated the famishing people. Several carts were attacked and\r\npillaged, some “strong farmers” were visited, and here or there a “miser”\r\nor meal-monger was obliged to be charitable with a bad grace; but on the\r\nwhole there was little lawlessness, less indeed than in England in 1756\r\nand 1766, or in Edinburgh in 1741. In September, 1817, Peel commissioned\r\nfour Dublin physicians to visit the respective provinces and report on the\r\ncauses and extent of the epidemic fever. On 22 April, 1818, Sir John\r\nNewport, member for Waterford, for whom Dr Harty had been collecting\r\ninformation, raised a debate on the epidemic in the House of Commons, and\r\nmoved for a Select Committee. The debate, after the opening speech and a\r\nsensible brief reply by Peel, degenerated at once into irrelevant talk on\r\nthe inadequacy of the fever hospital of London. The Select Committee was\r\nnamed, and quickly reported on the 8th of May.\r\n\r\nA Bill embodying the recommendations of the Committee received the royal\r\nassent on 30th May. The Act provided for the extension of fever hospitals,\r\nthe exemption of lodging-houses, under certain regulations, from the\r\nhearth-tax and the window-tax, and the formation of Boards of Health with\r\npowers to abate and remove nuisances. The Boards of Health were found\r\nunworkable, partly by reason of expense, partly of excessive powers. The\r\nepidemic having visited Waterford somewhat late in its progress, Sir John\r\nNewport again called attention to it on 6th April, 1819, and moved for the\r\nrevival of last year’s Committee. Mr Charles Grant, afterwards Lord\r\nGlenelg, who was now Irish Secretary, gave much satisfaction to the\r\npatriotic members both by his sympathetic speech on the occasion and by\r\nhis previous action at the Irish Office in the way of pecuniary help to\r\nthe fever hospitals or Dispensary district officers. The Second Report of\r\nthe Committee remarked that the rich absentee landlords had given nothing.\r\nAnother Act, of June, 1819 (59 Geo. III. cap 41), defined the duties of\r\nofficers of health, and contained an important clause (ix.) relating to\r\nthe spread of contagion by vagrants. By that time the epidemic was over;\r\nnor can it be said that the action of the Government from first to last\r\nhad made much difference to its progress.\r\n\r\nVagrancy was the principal direct cause; and behind the vagrancy were\r\nusages and traditions, with interests centuries old, which made the\r\nlandlords resolute not to pay poor-rates on their rentals. It was not\r\nuntil twenty years after that the English Poor Law was applied to Ireland\r\n(in 1839), whereby the pauper class were dealt with as far as possible in\r\ntheir respective parishes. How far that measure was effective in checking\r\nthe spread of contagion will appear when we come to the great famine and\r\nepidemic of dysentery and fever in 1846-49.\r\n\r\nIt will not be necessary to follow with equal minuteness the successive\r\nfamines and epidemics of typhus, relapsing fever and dysentery in Ireland,\r\nto the great famine of 1846-49. After 1817 distress became chronic among\r\nthe cottiers and small farmers. Leases had been entered into at high rents\r\nduring the years of war prices, and in the struggle for holdings tenants\r\nat will offered the highest rate. When peace came and prices fell, rents\r\nwere found to be excessive, not to say impossible. But in Ireland with a\r\nrapidly increasing population it was easier to put the rents up than to\r\nbring them down. Other things helped to embarrass the poor cottager: he\r\npaid twice over for his religion, tithes to the parson, dues to the\r\npriest; and he paid all the more of the tithe in that the graziers, who\r\nwere mostly of the established Church and the occupiers of the fertile\r\nplains, had taken care to make potato land titheable (at what date this\r\ninnovation arose is not stated) but had used their power in the Irish\r\nParliament to resist the tithe on arable pastures. Again the cottiers or\r\ncottagers paid, in effect, the whole of the poor rate in the form of alms;\r\nfor the dogs of the gentry kept all beggars from their gates.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamine and Fever in the West of Ireland, 1821-22.\r\n\r\nThe next famine in 1821-22 is remarkable for two things besides its purely\r\nmedical interest. Owing to the number of desperate evicted tenants, it\r\ngave occasion to an increased activity of the secret associations,\r\nespecially the Whiteboys of Tipperary and Cork[479]; and it called forth\r\nthe first great dole of English charity in the form of princely\r\nsubscriptions to a Famine Fund. The English charity in 1822 was prompt and\r\nlarge-hearted, contrasting with the tardy help from the exchequer in the\r\nmuch more serious famine of 1817-18. The true explanation of it is,\r\ndoubtless, that England on the second occasion had more money to spare.\r\nThe trouble in 1821-22 came from the total loss of the potato crop in\r\nMayo, Galway, Clare and Kerry, and from a partial loss of it in some other\r\ncounties of the south and west. There was no corn famine, and no general\r\ndearth. Accordingly it affected the poorest class only, and the most\r\nremote districts chiefly. The planting season of 1821 had not been\r\nfavourable, and the yield of potatoes had been poor. But the autumn was so\r\nwet in the west that the floods in some places washed away the soil with\r\nthe potatoes in it, and in other places drowned the potatoes after they\r\nhad been pitted. The flooded state of the basin of the Shannon was a\r\nnatural calamity on the great scale that touched the imagination and\r\nloosened the purse-strings. A Committee was formed at the London Tavern,\r\nwhich sat through the spring of 1822, and quickly raised an immense sum.\r\nThe great mercantile firms of the City and of Liverpool gave each a\r\nthousand pounds; a ball at the Opera House under the patronage of the king\r\n(George IV.) brought six thousand, and from all sources the Committee\r\nfound themselves with three hundred thousand pounds at their disposal\r\n(forty-four thousand of it from Ireland), while a fund at the Dublin\r\nMansion House amounted to thirty thousand more. Much of this was sent to\r\nGalway, Mayo, Clare and Kerry, in time to save many thousands of families\r\nfrom starvation[480]; it was, no doubt, wastefully given away, and there\r\nwas a balance of sixty thousand pounds sterling unused. More tardily in\r\nJune, 1822, Parliament voted one hundred thousand “for the employment of\r\nthe poor in Ireland,” and in July two hundred thousand to meet\r\ncontingencies of the famine. It was generally admitted that the Government\r\ngrants were jobbed and misappropriated to a scandalous extent. The towns\r\nhad to be made the centres of relief and the depôts of provisions; and yet\r\nthe towns were not suffering from famine or fever but only from penury.\r\nThe fever hospital at Ennis, the county town of Clare, was constantly\r\nfilled by strangers, the townspeople remaining healthy. Kerry was one of\r\nthe most afflicted counties, but Tralee and Killarney had no unusual\r\nsickness. Limerick town had hardly more fever than in an ordinary year. In\r\nDublin the admissions for fever in 1822 were a good deal below the usual\r\nnumber. On the other hand, Sligo town had much fever, and Galway town had\r\nan altogether unique experience, the history of which, as related by Dr\r\nGraves, will be the best possible view of the peculiar circumstances of\r\n1821-22[481].\r\n\r\nIn Connemara, where the distress was acute, there were no roads over which\r\nthe provisions from England could be carted to the famished districts.\r\nAccordingly a great store was made in Galway, to which crowds flocked from\r\nthe country in boats and on foot. Many died a few days after they arrived,\r\nfrom exhaustion or from the surfeit of food after long hunger. Galway, a\r\ncrowded place at best, with narrow streets and lanes, contained thousands\r\nof strangers, who slept about the quays and the fish-market, or in the\r\nlanes and entries, or in crowded lodging-houses four or five in a bed. The\r\nfever began in May, and quickly spread so much that the priests were kept\r\nfully employed by calls to the dying. In June and July the sixty beds of\r\nthe fever hospital were filled, principally with the fugitives from\r\nConnemara. Sixty more beds were added, and these by the middle of\r\nSeptember were insufficient. The infection had now spread to many good\r\nhouses. When Dr Graves and three other Dublin physicians arrived, on 26\r\nSeptember, they found ropes stretched across the streets to stop the wheel\r\ntraffic. The shops of tradesmen were avoided. The town was like a place in\r\nthe plague; people passing along the streets put their handkerchiefs to\r\ntheir noses when they came to a house with fever in it. Yet the number of\r\ncases was not remarkable; on 3 October, there were 404 sick in a\r\npopulation of 30,000, of whom 130 were in the fever hospital and 274 at\r\ntheir homes, the new cases occurring at the rate of 29 per diem. At length\r\nit was found practicable to set up depôts of provisions in country places,\r\nand the crowd of strangers left Galway. The fever was mild but tedious\r\namong the poor, more violent and fatal among the well-to-do. In many\r\ncountry places dysentery and choleraic diarrhœa were prevalent, as well as\r\nfever. In Erris, county Mayo, dysentery and dropsy were more common than\r\nfever, many of the cottiers having subsisted on weeds, shell-fish, or new\r\npotatoes dug six weeks after the seed was planted. In this famine the\r\npeople ate the flesh of black cattle dead of disease. Excepting in\r\nConnemara the county of Galway was not so soon affected as some other\r\nparts of Ireland; but, as in 1818, the contagion of fever was spread\r\nabroad by vagrants. After Mayo, Galway, Clare and Kerry, the counties most\r\naffected were Roscommon and Sligo, and next to these Leitrim, Tipperary\r\nand Cork.\r\n\r\n\r\nDysentery and Relapsing Fever, 1826-27.\r\n\r\nFever and dysentery decreased to an ordinary level in 1823, but rose\r\nsomewhat again in 1824, the summer of which was hot and moist. But it was\r\nin the hot and dry summers of 1825 and 1826 that dysentery became notably\r\ncommon in Ireland generally and in Dublin in particular. It began in the\r\ncapital in June--among the richer class of people. About the middle of\r\nAugust admissions for dysentery were perceptibly raising the number of\r\npatients in the Cork Street Fever Hospital, and continued to do so\r\nthroughout the autumn. At one dispensary three out of four applicants had\r\ndysentery. All those admitted to hospital were over twenty years of age;\r\nof thirty-five cases under Dr O’Brien, nine died, all of which had\r\nulceration of the great intestine, in one case gangrenous. The mortality\r\nwas not nearly so great among the richer classes, in which respect\r\ndysentery reversed the rule of typhus fever. O’Brien had one obvious case\r\nillustrating the curious connexion between dysentery and rheumatic fever,\r\noriginally remarked by English observers in the 18th century. A hospital\r\nporter was admitted with “fever of a mixed catarrhal and rheumatic type.”\r\nHaving been blooded and subjected to free evacuations, his fever left him\r\non the fourth day, but he was at once seized with dysentery, which ran its\r\ncourse[482].\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that this epidemic of dysentery began in Dublin in the\r\nhot June weather of 1825 among the richer classes, and that there was no\r\nnotable increase of fever while it lasted. It appears to have declined in\r\nDublin in the early part of 1826. After a cold and dry spring there began\r\none of the hottest and driest summers on record. The first rain for four\r\nmonths fell on the 15th of July, 1826, the thermometer rose as high as\r\n86°, and was on a mean several degrees above summer temperature in Dublin.\r\nIn the spring labour had become slack, and before long it was estimated\r\nthat 20,000 artizans in the Liberties (weavers and others) were out of\r\nwork. Early in May there began a most extraordinary epidemic of relapsing\r\nfever, with which some typhus was mixed. By the 9th of May, the 220 beds\r\nof the Cork Street Hospital were full, and applicants were sent away\r\ndaily. On 4 August, a temporary hospital of 240 beds was opened in the\r\ngarden of the Meath Hospital; on the 18th, the Wellesley Hospital, in\r\nNorth King Street, was opened with 113 beds; on the 15th, tents to hold\r\n180 patients were erected on the lawn of the Cork Street Hospital, raising\r\nits accommodation to 400; a warehouse in Kevin Street was furnished with\r\nbeds for 230 patients, and some increase was made to the beds in Sir\r\nPatrick Dun’s and Stevens’s Hospitals. The whole number of fever-beds in\r\nDublin hospitals at length reached 1400; but not half the number of cases\r\nwas provided for. At a meeting in the Mansion House on 26 October, it was\r\nstated that there were at that date 3200 persons sick of the fever at\r\ntheir homes, besides the 1400 in the hospitals. Funds were subscribed,\r\nsoup-kitchens and dispensaries opened in various districts of Dublin, and\r\nkept open most of the winter, “but they made little impression on the\r\nepidemic, which continued with unabated violence.” In March, 1827, it\r\nbegan suddenly to decline, and fell rapidly until it was nearly extinct in\r\nMay; and that, too, although “the complaints of distress and want are to\r\nthe full as loud as at the commencement of the epidemic, and provisions\r\nare dearer[483].” The corresponding sicknesses in Edinburgh and Glasgow\r\nwere later--the fever chiefly in 1828, the dysentery in 1827 and 1828.\r\n\r\nThis great epidemic was mainly one of relapsing fever. The patient “got\r\nthe cool,” or passed the crisis of the fever, usually on the evening of\r\nthe fifth or seventh day, sometimes on the ninth, the evening\r\nexacerbation, which was to prove critical, being ushered in generally with\r\na rigor, and passing off in profuse perspiration throughout the night. The\r\nfive-day fever was more certain to relapse than that of seven days, the\r\nseven-day fever was more likely to relapse than that of nine days. The\r\nrelapses might be one or two or three or more, prolonging the illness for\r\nweeks. The clear interval varied from twenty-four hours to fourteen days.\r\nThere were some cases with jaundice which led Stokes and Graves to speak\r\nloosely of “yellow fever[484].” O’Brien saw only four cases with exquisite\r\nicterus in fifteen hundred cases of relapsing fever. There was a small\r\nproportion of cases of ordinary typhus of a severe kind, marked by\r\nunusual delirium or phrensy and the absence of sordes on the teeth or\r\npetechiae on the skin; the typhus cases became more numerous in the winter\r\nseason, or, in other words, the original attack lasted to nine, eleven, or\r\nthirteen days, with little or no tendency to relapse. Gangrene was not\r\nuncommon in one part of the body or another, and in four cases the feet\r\nbecame gangrenous[485].\r\n\r\nEven with the admixture of pure typhus cases, and with dysenteric\r\ncomplications in the autumn and winter, the mortality of the whole\r\nepidemic was small--not more than it would have been among a third part\r\nthe number of fever cases in an ordinary year. At the Cork Street Hospital\r\nalone (including the tents) there were 8453 admissions from 4th August,\r\n1826, to 4th April, 1827, with 332 deaths, or four deaths in a hundred\r\ncases. The proportion of recoveries was quite as remarkable in known\r\ninstances in the squalid homes of the poor, where two or three would be\r\nfound ill of fever on one pallet, or a father and six children in one\r\nroom, shunned by the neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe strangest thing in this epidemic was the sequel of it. In the spring\r\nof 1827, intermittent fever, which had not made its appearance for several\r\nyears in Dublin, began to prevail pretty generally; whilst the ordinary\r\ncontinued fever showed a strong tendency to assume the intermittent and\r\nremittent forms. It is not surprising, therefore, that Dr O’Brien, who had\r\nthese varied experiences of epidemic dysentery in 1825, of epidemic\r\nrelapsing fever and typhus in 1826, and of intermittent fever in 1827,\r\nshould adopt Sydenham’s language of epidemic constitutions, and revert to\r\nthe old Sydenhamian doctrine of causes. While the sequence of epidemic\r\ndiseases in Dublin was some dysentery in the autumn and winter of 1825 and\r\nrelapsing fever on a vast scale during the excessively dry spring and\r\nsummer of 1826, in country districts of Ireland, such as Skibbereen,\r\ndysentery became epidemic after the great drought and heat of 1826, while\r\n“fever disappeared altogether,” and indeed all other prevalent forms of\r\nsickness gave way before it, so general was it. Such is the report from\r\nSkibbereen, county Cork, a district that became early notorious, in the\r\ngreat famine of 1846-47, and was perhaps a kind of barometer of Irish\r\ndistress twenty years earlier. The epidemic dysentery of 1826 attacked all\r\nclasses there, but chiefly the poorest; it was apt to begin insidiously,\r\nand, as it was often neglected, so it often became obstinate and hard to\r\ncure. Dr McCarthy attributed it to the drought of 1826, the commercial\r\ndistress of 1825, the lack of employment for labourers, the overgrowth of\r\npopulation, and the alarming rise in the prices of food[486]. He uses the\r\nsame economic illustrations as O’Connell and Smith O’Brien in the Great\r\nFamine twenty years after, which were, indeed, as old as the time of\r\nBishop Berkeley[487].\r\n\r\nAlthough little is heard of the fever of 1826-27 except in Dublin, it is\r\nprobable that the same causes which produced it there were operative in\r\nother large towns. The admissions to the Limerick Fever Hospital rose\r\nrapidly in the end of 1826. Geary, who was appointed one of its physicians\r\nthat year, estimates that about one in twelve of the population of\r\nLimerick (63,310) were treated for fever in 1827 at public institutions,\r\nbesides those treated in private practice. It was relapsing fever, as in\r\nDublin[488].\r\n\r\n\r\nPerennial Distress and Fever.\r\n\r\nAccording to all the figures of Irish fever-hospitals, and the\r\ngeneralities of their physicians, fever was now constantly present in the\r\ntowns. After the relapsing epidemic of 1826-27 had subsided, there was no\r\nrise above the steady level until the years 1831 and 1832, when a\r\nconsiderable increase appears in the admissions to the hospitals of\r\nDublin, Limerick and Belfast. But the fever of 1831-32 was totally\r\neclipsed by the cholera, and little is heard of typhus in Irish writings\r\nuntil 1835-36, when an epidemic arose, purely of typhus fever, which is\r\nsaid to have been as severe upon some districts as that of 1817-18 had\r\nbeen. This outbreak fell at the time of the Commission presided over by\r\nthe Earl of Devon, the report of which is authoritative for the state of\r\nthe Irish lower class and the causes of the same. The country cottiers and\r\nthe poor of the towns were always on the verge of starvation. Dr Geary, of\r\nLimerick, in 1836 estimated as follows the proportion of poor to the whole\r\npopulation, “the poor” being taken to mean “those who would require aid if\r\na Poor Law existed[489]:”\r\n\r\n_Proportion of “Poor” in the several Parishes of Limerick, 1836._\r\n\r\n                 St Nicholas   St John and\r\n                 and St Mary   St Laurence   St Munchin   St Michael\r\n\r\n  Population       14,629        15,667        4,071        16,226\r\n  Number of Poor    7,000         6,400          930         2,500\r\n\r\nMost of the poor lived in the old town of Limerick in lofty and\r\nclosely-built houses which the better classes had abandoned. These\r\ndilapidated barracks were the abodes of misery and filth, two and often\r\nthree families occupying a single room: “It is here, as in the decayed\r\nLiberties of Dublin[490], that the indigent room-keeper, the ruined\r\nartisan, the unemployed labourer, and the ejected country cottier, with\r\ntheir famishing families retreat.” Their degradation, Dr Geary thought,\r\nwas owing to the delay of Parliament in giving Ireland the Poor Law. The\r\nsanitary state of the old town was disgraceful. Heaps of manure were\r\ncarefully kept in back yards, to be sold to farmers in the spring--“a very\r\nprincipal source of livelihood” for those who collected it. Certain houses\r\nnear these depôts had always fever in them, dysentery was frequent, and\r\nExchange-lane never free from it[491]. An extensive glue-mill in the Abbey\r\npoisoned the air with the effluvia of putrid animal matters. The following\r\ntable shows the number of fever-cases admitted to the Hospital or attended\r\nfrom the Dispensary in 1827 and in four ordinary years thereafter:\r\n\r\n_Limerick:--Table of Hospital Cases of Fever and Cases at their Homes\r\nattended from the Dispensary._\r\n\r\n        Hospital Cases                      Dispensary Cases\r\n                      Average                        Average\r\n                     mortality.                      mortality.\r\n  Year Admitted Died  One in          Attended Died   One in     Total\r\n\r\n  1827   2781    137    20             2800     80     35         5581\r\n  1828    854     37    23              960     22     39         1714\r\n  1829    506     23    22              640     18     35         1146\r\n  1830    806     34    23½             910     25     36         1716\r\n  1831   1015     65    15½             920     31     29         1935\r\n                 -----------------------------------------------------\r\n  Totals 5962    296    20             6130    176     34        12092\r\n\r\nFrom 1831 to 1836 the admissions to hospitals were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Year Admitted Died\r\n\r\n  1832   1028    57\r\n  1833    824    42\r\n  1834    906    55\r\n  1835   1484   121\r\n  1836   3227   235\r\n\r\nThe last lines show the epidemic increase, which began in the autumn of\r\n1835.

But, although 1836 was not a\r\nyear of special scarcity, there must have been some cause at work to\r\nraise the perennial typhus to the height of an epidemic, not only in\r\nLimerick, but in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Ennis, Belfast, and other towns.\r\nIn the country, an epidemic outburst during the months of March, April and\r\nMay, 1836, in the parish of Donoughmore, Donegal, is perhaps only a sample\r\nof others unrecorded: it was remarkable in that nine-tenths of the cases\r\nof fever had as a sequel large boils on various parts of the body, but\r\nprincipally on the limbs[492].\r\n\r\nIn Dublin, the influenza of the first months of 1837 seemed to check the\r\nprevalence of typhus for a time; but the latter increased greatly when the\r\ninfluenza was over, so that the admissions to the Cork Street Hospital\r\nuntil the end of 1838 nearly equalled those of the worst epidemics since\r\nthe hospital was opened in 1804[493]. Females in typhus were admitted\r\ngreatly in excess of males; a large proportion (1847 in two years) were\r\nunder fifteen years of age; the fever rarely relapsed, so that it was\r\nmostly typhus, as in England and Scotland at the same time. In twelve\r\nmonths of the same period (Oct. 1837 to Sept. 1838) there were 1786\r\nadmissions for fever at Cork, 1840 at Limerick, and 1706 at Belfast[494].\r\n\r\nIn Dublin, as in London, Edinburgh and Glasgow, the continued fevers of\r\nthe “thirties” were distinctively spotted typhus, which was a new\r\nconstitution. Graves, lecturing at Dublin in November, 1836, said: “We are\r\nnow at a point of time possessing no common interest for the reflection of\r\nmedical observers. It is now nearly two years since my attention was first\r\narrested by the appearance of maculated fever, of which the first examples\r\nwere observed in some hospital cases from the neighbourhood of Kingstown.\r\nThis form of fever has lasted ever since, prevailing universally, as if it\r\nhad banished all other forms of fever, and being almost the only type\r\nnoticed in our wards[495].”\r\n\r\nThis increase of fever in Ireland, as well as the change in its type,\r\ncorresponded closely to the great epidemic outburst in Scotland and\r\nEngland. The census of Ireland, taken in June, 1841, for the ten years\r\npreceding, gave a somewhat loose return of the causes of death in each\r\nyear of the decennial period[496].\r\n\r\nThe worst years for fever were 1837 and 1840, the best year 1841. The\r\ndeaths from fever in ten years were 112,072, being 1 in 10·59 of the\r\ndeaths from all causes. The counties with highest fever mortality were\r\nCavan, Mayo, Galway and Clare; the worst towns were Belfast, Kilkenny,\r\nDublin, Limerick and Carrickfergus. Of these deaths from typhus-like\r\nfevers, 14,501 occurred in 86 fever-hospitals, which were open, or which\r\nkept records, for more or less of the decennial period. The following\r\ntable shows the proportions of rural, urban and hospital fever-deaths in\r\neach of the four provinces:\r\n\r\n_Deaths from fever in ten years, 1831-41._\r\n\r\n                         Leinster      Munster       Ulster    Connaught\r\n\r\n  Rural fever-deaths       16,159       23,718       21,616     19,319\r\n  Urban                     4,626        4,878        3,183      1,262\r\n  Hospital                  9,030        5,465        2,439        386\r\n                          -----------------------------------------------\r\n                           29,815       34,061       27,238       20,958\r\n\r\n  Rural population }\r\n  in 1841          }    1,531,106    2,009,220    2,160,698    1,338,635\r\n\r\n  Ratio of do. per }\r\n  sq. mile         }          247          332          406          386\r\n\r\nThe following detailed table for the province of Leinster shows the\r\nenormous preponderance of fever-deaths in the cottages or cabins[497].\r\nOnly Dublin and Kilkenny have most of the deaths in their fever hospitals\r\nor public institutions; it was not until near the end of this decennial\r\nperiod, the year 1839, that workhouses, with their infirmaries, began to\r\nbe provided for all the poor-law unions:\r\n\r\n_Fever Mortality in Leinster, 1831-41._\r\n\r\n                       Deaths from Fever      Deaths\r\n                       in Hospitals and     from Fever\r\n    Localities        Public Institutions     at home        Total\r\n\r\n  Carlow County                 202            891            1093\r\n  Drogheda Town                   1            238             239\r\n  Dublin County                 111           1248            1359\r\n  Dublin City                  6393           2369            8762\r\n  Kildare County                276           1068            1284\r\n  Kilkenny County               114           2378            2492\r\n  Kilkenny City                 487            204             691\r\n  King’s County                 126           1754            1880\r\n  Longford County                 3           1265            1268\r\n  Louth County                    1           1201            1202\r\n  Meath County                  294           2151            2445\r\n  Queen’s County                 84           1763            1847\r\n  Westmeath County               54           1550            1604\r\n  Wexford County                637           1736            2373\r\n  Wicklow County                280           1002            1282\r\n                             --------------------------------------\r\n                               9063         20,758          29,821\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Famine and Epidemic Sicknesses of 1846-49.\r\n\r\nThe great epidemic of relapsing fever, typhus, dysentery, anasarca and\r\npurpura, which arose in Ireland in the end of 1846 or spring of 1847 and\r\nlasted until the beginning of 1849, had for its direct antecedents the\r\nmore or less complete loss of the potato-crop through blight in two\r\nsuccessive autumns, 1845 and 1846, while the state of distress and\r\nsickness was prolonged by the potato disease in 1847 and 1848[498]. The\r\npotato-blight, which caused so much alarm in Ireland for the first time in\r\nSeptember, 1845, had been seen in Germany several years before, in Belgium\r\nin 1842, in Canada in 1844, and in England about the 19th of August, 1845.\r\nShortly after the last date, it attacked the Irish potato-fields, first in\r\nWexford, and before the end of the year it was estimated that one-third to\r\none-half of the yield, which was a fifth larger than usual from the\r\ngreater breadth planted and the abundant crop, was lost by absolute\r\nrottenness or unfitness for food, the process of decay being of a kind to\r\nmake great progress after the tubers were pitted. The loss to Ireland was\r\nestimated at about one pound sterling per head of the population. Sir\r\nRobert Peel was keenly alive to the magnitude of the calamity which\r\nthreatened the Irish peasantry. His first step was to summon to his aid a\r\nbotanist, Dr Lindley, and a chemist, Dr Playfair; the latter went down to\r\nDrayton Manor, and joined the prime minister in examining samples of the\r\ndiseased potatoes. The question was whether some chemical process could\r\nnot be found to arrest the decay of the tubers. Sir Robert Peel, in a much\r\ntalked-of address at the opening of the Tamworth Reading-Room in the\r\nwinter of 1840, had hailed the rising sun of science and useful knowledge.\r\nIt was only in reference to morals and religion that Peel’s deliverance\r\ncalled forth criticism, more particularly the memorable series of letters\r\nto the _Times_ by John Henry Newman. But one of Newman’s gibes was in a\r\nmanner prophetic of Peel’s attitude in approaching the material distress\r\nof Ireland: “Let us, in consistency, take chemists for our cooks, and\r\nmineralogists for our masons.” The two professors proceeded to Ireland,\r\nbut could only confirm the fact, already known, that one-third, or\r\none-half, of the potato-crop would be lost.\r\n\r\nBotany and chemistry being powerless to stay the effects of the\r\npotato-blight, the appeal was next to economics. Ireland produced not only\r\npotatoes but also corn. But for the most part the cottiers and cottagers\r\ntasted little of the oats or wheat which they grew; as soon as the harvest\r\nwas gathered, the corn was sold to pay the November rents, and was\r\nexported. Ireland was still in the paradoxical condition which Bishop\r\nBerkeley puzzled over a hundred years before: “whether our exports do not\r\nconsist of such necessaries as other countries cannot well be without?”\r\nThe industry and trade of Irish ports was largely that of corn-milling and\r\nshipping of oatmeal, flour and other produce; thus Skibbereen in the\r\nextreme south-west, where the horrors of famine were felt first, had\r\nseveral flour-mills and a considerable export trade in corn, meal, flour\r\nand provisions. The Irish corn harvest of 1845 had been abundant:\r\nO’Connell cited the _Mark Lane Express_ for the fact that 16,000 quarters\r\nof oats from Ireland had arrived in the Thames in a single week of\r\nOctober; on the 23rd of the same month the parish priest of Kells saw\r\nfifty dray-loads of oatmeal on the road to Drogheda for shipment. Ireland\r\npaid its rent to absentee landlords in corn and butter, just as a century\r\nbefore it had paid it largely in barrelled beef, keeping little for its\r\nown use besides potatoes and milk. In the face of the potato famine, the\r\nmeasure approved by the Irish leaders of all parties, O’Connell and Smith\r\nO’Brien as well as ducal proprietors, was to keep some of the oatmeal at\r\nhome. A committee which sat at the Dublin Mansion House were of opinion,\r\non 19 November, 1845, that the quantity of oats already exported of that\r\nharvest would have sufficed to feed the entire population of Ireland.\r\nO’Connell’s plan was to raise a million and a half on the annual revenue\r\nof the Irish woods and forests (£74,000), and to impose a tax on\r\nlandlords, both absentee and resident, and with the moneys so obtained to\r\nbuy up what remained of the Irish corn harvest for use at home. In the\r\nensuing session of Parliament, both he and Smith O’Brien protested that\r\nIreland had no need of English doles, having resources of her own if the\r\nlandlords were compelled to do their duty.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Lord John Russell, leader of the Opposition, was led\r\nby the danger of famine in Ireland to pronounce for the repeal of the Corn\r\nLaws of 1815; and at the meetings of the Cabinet in December, Peel urged\r\nthe same policy upon his colleagues for the same reason. The political\r\nhistory does not concern us beyond the fact that the threatened Irish\r\ndistress caused by the first partial potato-blight of 1845 was the\r\noccasion of the Corn and Customs Act of June, 1846, by which the Corn Laws\r\nwere repealed, and that an Irish Coercion Bill, brought in on account of\r\noutrages following an unusual number of evictions, was made the occasion\r\nof turning out Peel’s ministry at the moment of its Free Trade victory, by\r\na combination of Tory protectionists, Whigs and Irish patriots.\r\n\r\nThe direct effects of the potato-blight of 1845 were not so serious as had\r\nbeen expected. The Government quietly bought Indian meal (maize flour) in\r\nAmerica without disturbing the market, and had it distributed from twenty\r\nprincipal food-depots in Ireland, to the amount of 11,503 tons, along with\r\n528 tons of oatmeal. This governmental action ceased on the 15th of\r\nAugust, 1846, by which time £733,372 had been spent, £368,000 being loans\r\nand the rest grants. The people were set to road-making, so as to pay by\r\nlabour for their food, the number employed reaching a maximum of 97,000 in\r\nAugust. The Government, having been led by physicians in Dublin to expect\r\nan epidemic of fever, passed a Fever Act in March, 1846, by which a Board\r\nof Health was constituted. But no notable increase of sickness took place,\r\nand the Board was dissolved. There was a small outbreak of dysentery and\r\ndiarrhoea at Kilkenny (and possibly elsewhere) in the spring of 1846,\r\nwhich the physician to the workhouse set down to the use of the Indian\r\nmeal “and other substitutes for potatoes[499].”\r\n\r\nIt was the total loss of the potato crop in the summer and autumn\r\nfollowing, 1846, together with a failure of the harvest in England and in\r\nother countries of Northern Europe, that brought the real Irish distress.\r\nA large breadth of potatoes had been planted as usual, but doubtless with\r\na good deal of the seed tainted. An ordinary crop would have been worth,\r\naccording to one estimate, sixteen millions sterling, according to\r\nanother, twice as much. The crop was a total loss. The fields looked well\r\nin the summer, but those who dug the early potatoes found them unusually\r\nsmall. About the beginning of August the blight began suddenly and spread\r\nswiftly. A letter of the celebrated Father Mathew, the temperance\r\nreformer, brings this out:\r\n\r\n    “On the 29th of last month (July) I passed from Cork to Dublin, and\r\n    this doomed plant bloomed in all the luxuriance of an abundant\r\n    harvest. Returning on the 3rd instant (August) I beheld with sorrow\r\n    one wide waste of putrefying vegetation. In many places the wretched\r\n    people were seated on the fences of the decaying gardens wringing\r\n    their hands and wailing bitterly the destruction that had left them\r\n    foodless[500].”\r\n\r\nThe relief-works and distribution of Indian meal, which had been estimated\r\nby the Government to last only to August, 1846, at a cost of £476,000\r\n(one-half of it being a free grant), were resumed under the pressure of\r\npublic opinion, in the winter of 1846 and spring of 1847, a cost of\r\n£4,850,000, one-half of the sum being again a free grant. Before the\r\ndistress was over, other free grants and advances were made; so that, on\r\n15 February, 1850, Lord John Russell summed up the famine-indebtedness of\r\nIreland to the Consolidated Fund at £3,350,000, (which was to be repaid\r\nout of the rates in forty years from that date). Allowing an equal sum\r\nfreely gifted from the national exchequer, the whole public cost of the\r\nfamine would have been about seven millions sterling.\r\n\r\nThe short crops in Britain in 1846 were an excuse for not interfering with\r\nthe export of oats from Ireland. The imports of Indian meal were left to\r\nthe ordinary course of the market, and the distribution to retail traders.\r\nThe corn merchants of Cork, Limerick and other ports made fortunes out of\r\nthe American cargoes, and the dealers throughout the country made large\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\nTo encourage the influx of foreign food-supplies, and to lower freights,\r\nthe Navigation Laws were suspended for a few months, so that corn could be\r\ncarried in other than British bottoms. When Parliament met in January,\r\n1847, the distress in Ireland occupied the greater part of the Queen’s\r\nSpeech.\r\n\r\nLord George Bentinck proposed that sixteen millions should be advanced for\r\nthe construction of railroads, so as to give employment and wages to the\r\nstarving multitudes. The Government, however, objected that such relief\r\nwould operate at too great a distance, in most cases, from the homes of\r\nthe people; and it was urged by independent critics that a State loan for\r\nrailways would really be for the relief of the landlords more than of the\r\npeasantry. The large sums actually voted were spent in road-making and in\r\nprocuring food and medical relief. A Board of Works directed the\r\nrelief-works. A Commissariat, with two thousand Relief Committees under\r\nit, directed the distribution of food. A Board of Health provided\r\ntemporary fever-hospitals and additional physicians. It was not to be\r\nexpected that this machinery would work well, and, in fact, the public\r\nrelief was costly in its administration and often misdirected in its\r\nobjects. Private charities, especially that of the Society of Friends,\r\ngave invaluable help, money being subscribed by all classes at home and\r\nsent from distant countries, including a thousand pounds from the Sultan\r\nof Turkey. On one day, the third of July, 1847, nearly three millions in\r\nIreland received food gratuitously from the hands of the relieving\r\nofficers. In March, 1847, the public works were employing 734,000. The\r\nnumber relieved out of the poor rates at one time reached 800,000.\r\nWorkhouses were enlarged, and temporary fever-hospitals were built to the\r\nnumber of 207, which in the two years 1847 and 1848, received 279,723\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nEmigration to the United States and Canada, which had averaged 61,242\r\npersons per annum from the last half of 1841 to the end of 1845, rose\r\nsteadily all through the famine until it reached a total of 214,425 in the\r\nyear 1849, the passage money to the amount of millions sterling having\r\ncome largely from the savings of the Irish already settled in the New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nThe grand effect of the famine upon the population of Ireland was revealed\r\nby the census of 1851. The people in 1841 had numbered 8,175,124; in 1851\r\nthey numbered 6,515,794. The decrease was 28·6 per cent. in Connaught,\r\n23·5 per cent. in Munster, 16 per cent. in Ulster, and 15·5 per cent. in\r\nLeinster. In many remote parishes the number of inhabitants, and of\r\ncabins, fell to nearly a half. The depopulation was wholly rural, so much\r\nso that there was a positive increase of inhabitants not only in the large\r\ncounty towns, but even in small towns such as Skull and Kanturk, situated\r\nin Poor Law unions where the famine and epidemics had made the greatest\r\nclearances all over[501]. Our business here is with the epidemical\r\nmaladies, which contributed to this depopulation; but a few words remain\r\nto be said on the subject at large.\r\n\r\nMalthus had been prophetic about this crisis in the history of Ireland.\r\nCriticizing Arthur Young’s project to encourage the use of potatoes and\r\nmilk as the staple food of the English labourer instead of wheat, so as to\r\nescape the troubles of scarcity and high prices of corn, Malthus says:\r\n\r\n    “When, from the increasing population, and diminishing sources of\r\n    subsistence, the average growth of potatoes was not more than the\r\n    average consumption, a scarcity of potatoes would be, in every\r\n    respect, as probable as a scarcity of wheat at present; and when it\r\n    did arrive it would be beyond all comparison more dreadful. When the\r\n    common people of a country live principally upon the dearest grain, as\r\n    they do in England on wheat, they have great resources in scarcity;\r\n    and barley, oats, rice, cheap soups and potatoes, all present\r\n    themselves as less expensive, yet at the same time wholesome means of\r\n    nourishment; but when their habitual food is the lowest in this scale,\r\n    they appear to be absolutely without resource, except in the bark of\r\n    trees, like the poor Swedes; and a great portion of them must\r\n    necessarily be starved[502].”\r\n\r\nThe forecast of Malthus was repeated in his own way by Cobbett, although\r\nneither of them foresaw the potato-blight as the means.\r\n\r\n    “The dirty weed,” said Cobbett in a conversation in 1834, “will be the\r\n    curse of Ireland. The potato will not last twenty years more. It will\r\n    work itself out; and then you will see to what a state Ireland will be\r\n    reduced.... You must return to the grain crops; and then Ireland,\r\n    instead of being the most degraded, will become one of the finest\r\n    countries in the world. You may live to see my words prove true; but I\r\n    never shall[503].”\r\n\r\nThis is what has come to pass in a measure, and will come to pass more and\r\nmore. Only in some remote parts do the Irish cottiers now live upon\r\npotatoes and milk. It has come to be quite common for them to grow an\r\nIrish half acre of wheat, and, what is more to the purpose, to consume\r\nwhat they thus produce instead of selling it to pay the rent. Doubtless\r\nthe enormous imports of American, Australian and Black Sea wheat have made\r\nit easier for the Irish to have wheaten bread. But, whatever the reason,\r\nthey have at length adopted the ancient English staff of life, a staple or\r\nstandard which they were in a fair way to have achieved long ago, had not\r\ntheir addiction to “lost causes and impossible loyalties” given an\r\nunfavourable turn to the natural progress of the nation[504].\r\n\r\nWe come at length to the purely medical side of the great famine of\r\n1846-47[505]. The distress in the latter part of the year 1846 was felt\r\nfirst in the west and south-west--in the districts to which the famine of\r\n1822 had been almost confined. It happened that the state of matters\r\naround Skibbereen, the extreme south-western point of Ireland, was brought\r\nmost under public notice; but it is believed that there were parts of the\r\nwestern sea-board counties of Mayo, Galway, Clare and Kerry from which\r\nequally terrible scenes might have been reported at an equally early\r\nperiod. It was in Clare that relief at the national charges was longest\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nDr Popham, one of the visiting physicians to the Cork Workhouse, wrote as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “The pressure from without upon the city began to be felt in October\r\n    [1846], and in November and December the influx of paupers from all\r\n    parts of this vast county was so overwhelming that, to prevent them\r\n    from dying in the streets, the doors of the workhouse were thrown\r\n    open, and in one week 500 persons were admitted, without any\r\n    provision, either of space or clothing, to meet so fearful an\r\n    emergency. All these were suffering from famine, and most of them from\r\n    malignant dysentery or fever. The fever was in the first instance\r\n    undoubtedly confined to persons badly fed or crowded into unwholesome\r\n    habitations; and as it originated with the vast migratory hordes of\r\n    labourers and their families congregated upon the public roads, it was\r\n    commonly termed ‘the road fever’[506].”\r\n\r\nIt was the same in the smaller towns of the county, such as Skibbereen; in\r\nthe month of December, 1846, there were one hundred and forty deaths in\r\nthe workhouse; on one day there were fifteen funerals waiting their turn\r\nfor the religious offices. Still farther afield, in the country parishes,\r\nthe state of matters was the same. The sea-board parish of Skull was a\r\ntypical poor district, populous with cabins along the numerous bays of the\r\nAtlantic, but with few residential seats of the gentry. On the 2nd of\r\nFebruary, 1847, the parish clergyman, the Rev. Traill Hall (himself at\r\nlength a victim to the contagion), wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Frightful and fearful is the havock around me. Our medical friend, Dr\r\n    Sweetman, a gentleman of unimpeachable veracity, informed me yesterday\r\n    that if he stated the mortality of my parish at an average of\r\n    thirty-five daily, he would be within the truth. The children in\r\n    particular, he remarked, were disappearing with awful rapidity. And to\r\n    this I may add the aged, who, with the young--neglected, perhaps,\r\n    amidst the widespread destitution--are almost without exception\r\n    swollen and ripening for the grave[507].”\r\n\r\nThey were “swollen” by the anasarca or general dropsy, which was reported\r\nfrom nearly all parts of Ireland as being, along with dysentery and\r\ndiarrhoea, the prevalent kind of sickness before the epidemic fever became\r\ngeneral in the spring of 1847. The same had been remarked as the precursor\r\nof the fever of 1817-18. In the end of March, Dr Jones Lamprey, sent by\r\nthe Board of Health, found the parish of Skull “in a frightful state of\r\nfamine, dysentery and fever.” Dysentery had been by far more prevalent\r\nthan fever in this district, as in many others. “It was easily known,”\r\nsays Dr Lamprey, “if any of the inmates in the cabins of the poor were\r\nsuffering from this disease, as the ground in such places was usually\r\nfound marked with clots of blood.” The malady was most inveterate and\r\noften fatal. It must have had a contagious property, for the physician\r\nhimself went through an attack of it[508].\r\n\r\nIn the Skibbereen district the dead were sometimes buried near their\r\ncabins; at the town itself many were carried out in a shell and laid\r\nwithout coffins in a large pit[509]. Along the coast of Connemara for\r\nthirty miles there was no town, but only small villages and hundreds of\r\ndetached cabins; this district is said to have been almost\r\ndepopulated[510].\r\n\r\nBesides the dysentery and dropsy, which caused most of the mortality in\r\nthe winter of 1846-47, another early effect of the famine was scurvy, a\r\ndisease rarely seen in Ireland and unknown to most of the medical men. It\r\nwas by no means general, but undoubtedly true scurvy did occur in some\r\nparts: thus in the Ballinrobe district, county Mayo[511], it was very\r\nprevalent in 1846 for some months before the epidemic fever appeared,\r\nbeing “evidenced by the purple hue of the gums, with ulceration along\r\ntheir upper thin margin, bleeding on the slightest touch, and deep\r\nsloughing ulcers of the inside of the fauces, with intolerable\r\nfoetor”--affecting men, women, and children. In some places, as at\r\nKilkenny early in 1846, there was much purpura[512]. These earlier effects\r\nof the famine (dysentery and diarrhoea, dropsy, scurvy and purpura), were\r\nseen in varying degrees before the end of 1846 in most parts of Ireland.\r\nThe counties least touched by them were in Leinster and Ulster, such as\r\nDown, Derry, Tyrone, Fermanagh and some others, where the peasantry lived\r\nupon oatmeal as well as on potatoes. But even these were invaded by the\r\nensuing epidemic of fever, the only place in all Ireland which is reported\r\nto have escaped both the primary and the secondary effects of the famine\r\nhaving been Rostrevor, on the coast of Down, a watering-place with a rich\r\npopulation, which was also one of the very small number of localities that\r\nescaped in 1817-18.\r\n\r\nAccording to the following samples of admissions to the Fever Hospital of\r\nEnnis in the several months, the summers were the season of greatest\r\nsickness, a fact which was noted also in the epidemic of 1817-18:\r\n\r\n  Year   Month    Patients\r\n\r\n  1846  November      93\r\n   \"    December     224\r\n  1847  June         757\r\n  1848  February     210\r\n   \"    May          705\r\n   \"    November     400\r\n\r\nThe almost uniform report of medical men was that the epidemic of fever\r\nbegan in 1847, in the spring months in most places, in the summer in\r\nothers. Relapsing fever was the common type. It was usually called the\r\nfamine fever for the reason that it was constantly seen to arise in\r\npersons “recovering from famine,” on receiving food from the Relief\r\nCommittees[513]. It was a mild or “short” fever, apt to leave weakness,\r\nbut rarely fatal. Dr Dillon, of Castlebar, reports that he would be told\r\nby the head of a family: “We have been _three times down_ in the fever,\r\nand have all, thank God, got through it.” Dr Starkey, of Newry, “knew many\r\nfamilies, living in wretched poverty on the mountains near the town, who\r\nwere attacked with fever, and who without any medical attendance, and but\r\nlittle attendance of any kind, passed through the fever without a single\r\ndeath.” The doctor of Bryansford and Castlewellan, county Down, (where\r\nthere was no famine), declared that the recoveries of the poor in their\r\nown cottages destitute of almost every comfort, were astonishing. In the\r\nSkibbereen district, Dr Lamprey was “often struck with the rarity of the\r\nordinary types of fever among the thousands suffering from starvation.” In\r\nsome of the most famine-stricken places, such as the islands off the\r\ncoast of Mayo and Galway, and in Gweedore, Donegal, not more than one in\r\na hundred cases of relapsing fever proved fatal. In Limerick the mortality\r\nwas “very small.” In many places it is given at three in the hundred\r\ncases, in some places as high as six in the hundred. When deaths occurred,\r\nthey were often sudden and unexpected,--more probable in the relapse than\r\nin the first onset. At Clonmel it was remarked that a certain blueness of\r\nthe nose presaged death; in Fermanagh it was called the Black Fever, from\r\nthe duskiness of the face. The report from Ballinrobe, Mayo, says that it\r\nwas attended by rheumatic pains, which caused the patients to cry out when\r\nthey stirred in bed[514]. It was mostly a fever of the first half of life,\r\nand more of the female sex than of the male. One says that it was\r\ncommonest from five to fifteen years of age, another from ten to thirty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nRelapsing fever was the most common fever of the famine years, in the\r\ncabins, workhouses and fever hospitals, in the country districts as well\r\nas the towns and cities. Dr Henry Kennedy says of Dublin: “Cases of\r\ngenuine typhus were through the whole epidemic very rare, I mean\r\ncomparatively speaking.” But everywhere there was a certain admixture of\r\ntyphus, and in some not unusual circumstances the typhus was peculiarly\r\nmalignant or fatal--many times more fatal than the relapsing fever. The\r\npoor themselves do not appear to have suffered much from the more\r\nmalignant typhus, unless in the gaols and workhouses. When the doors of\r\nthe Cork workhouse were thrown open in December, 1846, five hundred were\r\nadmitted pell mell in one week; the deaths in that workhouse were 757 in\r\nthe month of March, 1847, and 3329 in the whole year. In the Ballinrobe\r\nworkhouse, county Mayo, “men, women and children were huddled together in\r\nthe same rooms (the probationary wards), eating, drinking, cooking, and\r\nsleeping in the same apartment in their clothes, without even straw to lie\r\non or a blanket to cover them.” Typhus at length appeared in that\r\nworkhouse, said to have been brought in by a strolling beggar, and the\r\nphysician, the master and the clerk died of it. Wherever the better-off\r\nclasses caught fever, it was not relapsing but typhus, and a very fatal\r\ntyphus. At Skibbereen the relapsing fever “was not propagated by\r\ncontagion; but in persons so affected, when brought in contact with the\r\nmore wealthy and better fed individuals, was capable of imparting fevers\r\nof different types[515].” There were many opportunities for such\r\ncontact-in serving out food at the depôts, in superintending the gangs\r\nworking on the roads, in attending the sessions, in visiting the sick. The\r\ncrowds suffering from starvation, famine-fever or dysentery exhaled the\r\nmost offensive smells, the smell of the relapsing fever and the anasarca\r\nbeing peculiar or distinguishable[516]. There appeared to be a scale of\r\nmalignity in the fevers in an inverted order of the degree of misery. The\r\nmost wretched had the mildest fever, the artizan class or cottagers had\r\ntyphus fatal in the usual proportion, the classes living in comfort had\r\ntyphus of a very fatal kind. This experience, however strange it may seem,\r\nwas reported by medical observers everywhere with remarkable unanimity.\r\nOne says that six or seven of the rich died in every ten attacks, others\r\nsay one in three. Forty-eight medical men died in 1847 in Munster, most of\r\nthem from fever; in Cavan county, seven medical men died of fever in\r\ntwelve months, and three more had a narrow escape of death: two of the\r\nthree physicians sent by the Board of Health to the coast of Connemara\r\ndied of fever[517]. Many Catholic priests died as well as some of the\r\nEstablished Church clergy; and there were numerous fatalities in the\r\nfamilies of the resident gentry, and among others who administered the\r\nrelief. Yet a case of fever in a good house did not become a focus of\r\ncontagion; the contagion came from direct contact with the crowds of\r\nstarving poor, their clothes ragged and filthy, their bodies unwashed, and\r\nmany of them suffering from dysentery. The greater fatality of fever among\r\nthe richer classes had been a commonplace in Ireland since the epidemic of\r\n1799-1801, and is remarked by the best writers[518]. At Loughrea, in\r\nGalway, Dr Lynch observed that “in the year 1840 the type of fever was\r\nvery bad indeed, and very many of the gentry were cut off by it.” He\r\nreckoned that ordinarily one in six cases of fever among the richer class\r\nproved fatal, one in fifteen among the poor[519]. But in the great famine,\r\nsix years after, the fever of the poor assumed the still milder type of\r\nrelapsing, fatal perhaps to one in a hundred cases, or three in a hundred,\r\nwhile the fever which contact with them gave to those at the other extreme\r\nof well-being became a peculiarly malignant typhus, fatal to six or seven\r\nin ten cases, as Dr Pemberton of Ballinrobe found, or to three or four in\r\nten cases, as many others found. Of course it was the peasantry who made\r\nup by far the greater part of the mortality in the years of famine; but\r\nthey were cut off by various maladies, nondescript or definite, while the\r\nricher classes died, in connexion with the famine, of contagious typhus\r\nand here or there of contagious dysentery.\r\n\r\nEven in the crowded workhouses and gaols, more deaths occurred from\r\ndysentery than from fever. But in some of the gaols great epidemics arose\r\nwhich cut off many of the poor by malignant infection. That was an old\r\nexperience of the gaols, studied best in England in the 18th century; the\r\nworst fevers, or those most rapidly fatal, were caught by the prisoners\r\nnewly brought to mix with others long habituated to their miserable\r\ncondition. The gaols in Ireland during the famine were crowded to excess,\r\nnot so much because the people gave way to lawlessness--their patience and\r\nobedience were matters of common complimentary remark--but because they\r\ncommitted petty thefts, broke windows, or the like, in order to obtain the\r\nshelter and rations of prisoners. The mortality in the gaols rose and fell\r\nas follows[520]:\r\n\r\n  Year    Deaths in gaol\r\n\r\n  1846         130\r\n  1847        1320\r\n  1848        1292\r\n  1849        1406\r\n  1850         692\r\n  1851         197\r\n\r\nMost of the deaths in these larger totals came from two or three great\r\nprison epidemics in each of the series of years--at Tralee,\r\nCarrick-on-Shannon, Castlebar and Cork in 1847, at Galway in 1848, at\r\nClonmel, Limerick, Cork and Galway in 1849, the highest mortality being\r\n485 deaths in Galway county gaol in 1848. Descriptions remain of the state\r\nof the gaols at Tralee and Castlebar in 1847, from which it appears that\r\nthey were frightfully overcrowded and filthy. Dr Dillon, of Castlebar,\r\nsays that the county gaol there in March, 1847, had twice as many\r\nprisoners as it was built for, “those committed being in a state of\r\nnudity, filth and starvation.” He expected an outbreak of typhus, and\r\napplied to the magistrates to increase the accommodation, which they\r\ndeclined to do. In due time, very bad maculated typhus broke out, of which\r\nthe chaplain, matron and others of the staff died. This contagious fever\r\nis said to have proved fatal to forty per cent. of those attacked by it.\r\nThe deaths for the year are returned at 83 in Castlebar gaol, those in\r\nTralee gaol at 101, and in the gaol of Carrick-on-Shannon at 100.\r\n\r\nNo exact statistical details of the mortality in the great Irish famine of\r\n1846-49 were kept. Ireland had then no systematic registration of deaths\r\nand of the causes of death, such as had existed in England since 1837.\r\nInformation as to the mortality was got retrospectively once in ten years\r\nby means of the census, heads of families being required to fill in all\r\nthe deaths, with causes, ages, years, seasons, &c., of the same, that had\r\noccurred in their families within the previous decennial period. This was,\r\nof course, a very untrustworthy method, more especially so for the famine\r\nyears, when many thousands of families emigrated, leaving hardly a trace\r\nbehind, many hamlets were wholly abandoned, and many parishes stripped of\r\nnearly half their inhabited houses. When a certain day in the year 1851\r\ncame round for the census papers to be filled up, a fourth part of the\r\npeople were gone, and that fourth could have told more about the famine\r\nand the deaths than an equal number of those that remained. However, the\r\nCensus Commissioners did their best with the defective, loose or erroneous\r\ndata at their service. Much of the interest of the Irish Census of 1851\r\ncentered, indeed, in the Great Famine; and the two volumes of specially\r\nmedical information compiled by Sir William Wilde, making Part V. of the\r\nCensus Report, are a store of facts, statistical and historical, of which\r\nonly a few can be given here[521].\r\n\r\n_Table of Workhouses and Auxiliary Workhouses in Ireland during the\r\nFamine._\r\n\r\n          No. of      Numbers    Numbers   Ratio of deaths\r\n  Year  Workhouses   relieved   that died     One in\r\n\r\n  1846     129       250,822    14,662       17·11\r\n  1847     130       332,140    66,890        6·92\r\n  1848     131       610,463    45,482       13·4\r\n  1849     131       932,284    64,440       14·47\r\n  1850     163       805,702    46,721       17·74\r\n\r\nDuring the ten years from 6 June, 1841, to 30 March, 1851, the deaths from\r\nthe principal infective or “zymotic” diseases in the workhouses were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Dysentery      50,019\r\n  Diarrhoea      20,507\r\n  Fevers         34,644\r\n  Measles         8,943\r\n  Cholera         6,716\r\n  Smallpox        5,016\r\n\r\nBesides the workhouses, there were during the famine 227 temporary fever\r\nhospitals, which received 450,807 persons from the beginning of 1847 to\r\nthe end of 1850, of whom 47,302 died.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Census returns, the deaths from the several causes\r\nconnected with the famine were as follows in the respective years:\r\n\r\n                       Dysentery\r\n  Year     Fever    (with Diarrhoea)  Starvation\r\n\r\n  1845     7,249       ------           -----\r\n  1846    17,145        5,492           2,041\r\n  1847    57,095       25,757           6,058\r\n  1848    45,948       25,694[522]    }\r\n  1849    39,316       29,446[523]    } 9,395\r\n  1850    23,545       19,224           -----\r\n\r\nAccording to this table, fever caused more deaths than dysentery. But\r\nthere are reasons for thinking that the deaths from dysentery, anasarca\r\nand other slow effects of famine and bad food really made up more of the\r\nextra mortality of the famine-years than the sharp fever itself. In the\r\nreturns from the workhouses, dysentery is actually credited with about\r\none-half more deaths than fever. It is known that most of the mortality at\r\nthe beginning of the famine, the winter of 1846-47, was from dysentery and\r\nallied chronic forms of sickness. Dysentery also followed the decline of\r\nthe relapsing-fever epidemic of 1847-48. Dillon, of Castlebar, says that\r\nmany, who had gone through the fever in the autumn of 1847, fell into\r\ndysentery in 1848, during which year it was very prevalent. Mayne says\r\nthat dysentery often attacked those recovering from fever, and proved\r\nfatal to them[524]. In the General Hospital of Belfast the fatality of\r\nfever-cases was 1 in 8, “but this included dysentery.” Probably the same\r\nexplanation should be given of the high rates of fatality in the Fever\r\nHospital of Ennis, the chief centre of relief for the greatly distressed\r\ncounty of Clare: 1846, 1 in 12½; 1847, 1 in 5¾; 1848, 1 in 5½.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that some thousands of deaths were put down to\r\nstarvation in the Census returns. Perhaps a more technical nosological\r\nterm might have been found for a good many of these, such as anasarca or\r\ngeneral dropsy. But even if physicians had made the returns, instead of\r\nthe priests or relatives, they would have put many into a nondescript\r\nclass, for which starvation was a sufficiently correct generic name.\r\nScurvy was another disease of malnutrition which was far from rare during\r\nthe famine; the deaths actually set down to that cause were some hundreds\r\nover the whole period.\r\n\r\nThe deaths from all causes in the decennial period covered by the Census\r\nof 1851 were 985,366. But these returns were made, as we have seen, on a\r\npopulation which had been reduced by a fourth part in the course of ten\r\nyears, so that they fall considerably short of the reality. If the\r\npopulation of Ireland had multiplied at the same rate as that of England\r\nand Wales from 1841 to 1851, namely, 1·0036 per cent. per annum, it should\r\nhave been 9,018,799 in the year 1851; but it was only 6,552,385.\r\nEmigration beyond the United Kingdom had averaged 61,242 persons per annum\r\nfrom the 30th of June, 1841, to the 31st December, 1845; next year, 1846,\r\nit rose to 105,955, in 1847 it was “more than doubled,” in 1848 it was\r\n178,159, in 1849, 214,425, in 1850 it was 209,054, and in 1851 it touched\r\nthe maximum, 249,721. Nearly a million emigrated in the six years\r\npreceding the date of the Census, and there was besides a considerable\r\nmigration to Liverpool, Glasgow, London and other towns of England and\r\nScotland. It is probable that emigration accounts for two-thirds of the\r\ndecrease of inhabitants revealed by the Census of 1851; but the extra\r\nmortality of the famine years, or the deaths over and above the ordinary\r\ndeaths in Ireland during a decennial period, can hardly be estimated below\r\nhalf a million.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecrease of Typhus and Dysentery after 1849.\r\n\r\nThe potato famines of 1845-48 were a turning-point in the history of\r\nIreland. From that time the population has steadily declined and the\r\nwell-being of the people steadily improved. By the Census of 1871 the\r\npopulation was 5,386,708, by that of 1881 it was 5,144,983, by that of\r\n1891 it was 4,704,750. Registration of births and deaths, which began in\r\n1864, shows the following samples:\r\n\r\n  Year    Births    Deaths\r\n\r\n  1867   144,318    98,911\r\n  1871   151,665    88,720\r\n  1880   128,010   102,955\r\n  1888   109,557    85,892\r\n\r\nThe enormous amount of pauperism which followed the great famine was at\r\nlength brought within limits: from 1866 to the present time it has been\r\nmarked by a steady increase of out-door relief, and by some increase in\r\nthe numbers within the Union Workhouses; the out-door paupers have\r\nincreased from 10,163 on 1 Jan., 1866, to 53,638 on 1 Jan., 1881, the\r\nabsolute number of indoor paupers having remained, on an average of good\r\nand bad years, somewhat steady in a declining population.\r\n\r\nThe public health has been undisturbed by great epidemics since the potato\r\nfamine, although the effects of that calamity did not wholly cease until\r\nsome years after. It is best estimated by the mean annual average of\r\ndeaths among a thousand inhabitants, a ratio which has been low for the\r\nprovinces of Connaught and Munster, and not excessive for the provinces of\r\nUlster and Leinster. The following tables are of the death rates in two\r\nsample years, 1880 and 1889 respectively[525]:\r\n\r\n              1880   1889\r\n\r\n  Connaught   15·3   12·4\r\n  Munster     19·5   15·1\r\n  Ulster      20·0   16·8\r\n  Leinster    23·3   18·3\r\n\r\n_Four healthiest counties_:\r\n\r\n       1880         |       1889\r\n  Mayo       14·5   |  Galway    11·8\r\n  Sligo      15·3   |  Kerry     12·1\r\n  Galway     15·6   |  Leitrim   12·1\r\n  Roscommon  15·8   |  Cavan     12·2\r\n\r\n_Four unhealthiest counties_:\r\n\r\n        1880           |        1889\r\n  Dublin co.     31·7  |  Dublin co.  24·5\r\n  Waterford co.  24·9  |  Antrim      21·2\r\n  Louth          22·6  |  Down        18·6\r\n  Antrim         21·9  |  Armagh      17·0\r\n\r\nThe higher death rates of some counties are chiefly owing to their greater\r\nurban populations. The health of the cottier districts is remarkably good,\r\nand is rarely if ever disturbed by any _morbus miseriae_. The cabins,\r\nexcept in a few remote parts, are more comfortable than they used to be,\r\nthe diet is better, the clothing is better, the education of the children\r\nis better. The present happier lot of the Irish peasantry can be measured\r\nnot unfairly by the statistics showing the decrease in the number of\r\ncabins of the lowest class, and the increase of dwellings in the higher\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nThe history of fever and dysentery in Ireland subsequently to the great\r\nepidemics of 1846-49 has few salient points. Dysentery, the old “country\r\ndisease,” has steadily declined to about a hundred deaths in the year,\r\nwhile the considerable mortality from diarrhoea, nearly two thousand\r\ndeaths in a year, is nearly all from the cholera infantum or summer\r\ndiarrhoea of children in the large towns. The history of the continued\r\nfevers is made complex by the modern identification of typhoid or enteric\r\nfever. According to the testimonies of several, it played but a small part\r\nin the epidemics of 1846-49, even in Dublin itself[526], and it can hardly\r\nbe doubted that its recent increase in that city is not apparent but real.\r\nThe following table from the year 1880 to the present time will show how\r\nthe deaths from continued fever are now divided in the registration\r\nreturns:\r\n\r\n                  Simple\r\n  Year  Typhus  continued  Enteric\r\n\r\n  1880   934       1073     1087\r\n  1881   859        774      813\r\n  1882   744        657      844\r\n  1883   810        593      853\r\n  1884   628        572      693\r\n  1885   505        443      716\r\n  1886   394        380      772\r\n  1887   405        385      740\r\n  1888   362        330      741\r\n  1889   359        250      968\r\n  1890   391        231      855\r\n  1891   266        183      859\r\n  1892   268        210      714\r\n\r\nThis decline of typhus in a country where for many generations it seemed\r\nto be a national malady is a remarkable testimony to the influence of the\r\nchanged conditions which have made typhus rare everywhere.\r\n\r\nThere are some interesting points in connexion with Irish typhus since\r\n1849. After the subsidence of the great epidemic of relapsing and typhus\r\nfevers (1847-49), says Dr Dennis O’Connor, of Cork, “intermittent fever\r\nmade its appearance, and, as long as it lasted, scarcely a case of\r\ncontinued fever was seen. As soon as the last cases of intermittent\r\ndisappeared, the present epidemic broke out (1864-65), and still rages\r\nwith much severity. This alternation of continued and intermittent fever\r\nis remarkable. Indeed it might have been observed that the fever of 1847\r\npassed first into a remittent form, and gradually into the intermittent\r\nwhich prevailed more or less for ten years subsequently[527].” The same\r\nsuccession of relapsing fever by intermittent fever was observed after the\r\nepidemic of 1826 by Dr John O’Brien, of Dublin[528]. The epidemic of fever\r\nwhich Dr O’Connor describes for Cork in 1864-65, appeared in Dublin about\r\nthe same time--the latter half of 1864. It was of the nature of typhus in\r\nboth cities, cerebro-spinal in part, but probably not typhoid[529]. At\r\nCork it had some peculiarities--a croupous-like exudation on the tongue,\r\nresembling thrush in the mouth, and a dark mottled rash (rubeola nigra),\r\nor fiery red spots on a dark red ill-defined base. “The true typhoid rash\r\nhas been seen but seldom, and the petechiae of genuine typhus, so frequent\r\nin former epidemics, have been equally rare. The latter I attribute to the\r\nimproved condition of our poor in good clothing and the ventilation of\r\ntheir dwellings.” The intellect was little disturbed in this fever, there\r\nwas usually a crisis about the fourteenth day, and there were no relapses.\r\nThe sequelae were peculiar--“great nervous debility, leading to a\r\nsemi-paralysed state of the limbs,” congestion of the lungs, sometimes\r\nsolidification, or gangrene or suppuration of them. It occurred at a time\r\n“when the food of the people is most abundant and of the best quality.”\r\nThere had been three bad harvests in succession from 1860, but it may be\r\ninferred from a Dublin article of August, 1863, that no epidemic of typhus\r\nhad arisen in Ireland down to that date, although there was much typhus in\r\nEngland, especially in Lancashire owing to the “cotton famine.” When the\r\nepidemic did arise in Dublin, Cork, and doubtless elsewhere in Ireland, in\r\nthe latter part of 1864, to continue throughout 1865, it was not connected\r\nwith scarcity or distress among the common people. On the other hand, Dr\r\nGrimshaw, of Dublin, found that it was subject to influences of the\r\nweather, as if the infective principle had been a soil poison like that of\r\nplague, yellow fever, cholera, or enteric fever. Taking the Cork Street\r\nFever Hospital for his study, he made out that there was a very close\r\ncorrespondence, from the 29th of May to the 31st of December, 1864,\r\nbetween the fluctuating pressure upon its accommodation and the periodic\r\nrises in the atmospheric moisture and heat, the crowd of patients being\r\nalways greater when a high temperature coincided with a large\r\nrainfall[530]. One would not have been surprised to find some such law as\r\nthat in enteric or typhoid fever, although a correspondence from day to\r\nday is subject to many sources of fallacy; but, by all accounts, the\r\ndisease was typhus, the last of the considerable outbreaks of it in\r\nIreland hitherto, and an outbreak that seemed to require, both at Cork and\r\nDublin, the language of Sydenham’s epidemic constitutions for its adequate\r\ndescription. For a good many years, the continued fever of Dublin has been\r\nchiefly enteric or typhoid. As late as 1862 a physician to the Fever\r\nHospital, unconvinced by the method of Sir William Jenner, believed that\r\nhe observed a transition from the old typhus into the new enteric: “The\r\nchange at first seemed to be to the gastric type; to which was shortly\r\nadded diarrhoea in nearly every instance; and this latter, again,\r\noccurring in a large number of cases which presented all the characters of\r\ntyphus, including a dense crop of petechiae[531].” Assuming that there had\r\nbeen a mixture of cases of enteric and typhus fevers, the latter must have\r\nhad diarrhoea among the symptoms, as they often had in special\r\ncircumstances (as well as tympanitis). Since that time the species of\r\ntyphus has greatly declined, and the species of typhoid has considerably\r\nincreased. The remodelling which Dublin has undergone, like all other old\r\ncities, explains the one fact. The notorious Liberties have been in great\r\npart rebuilt, and the conditions of typhus, as well as its actual fomites,\r\nto that extent removed. On the other hand, something has happened to\r\nencourage the soil poison of enteric fever. It is not easy to say what are\r\nthe conditions that have favoured the enteric poison in modern towns; but\r\nthere can be little doubt about the fact in general, or that Dublin and\r\nBelfast are among the best fields for the study of the problem[532].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nINFLUENZAS AND EPIDEMIC AGUES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEpidemic agues are joined in the same chapter with influenzas for the\r\nreason that they can hardly be separated in the earlier part of the\r\nhistory. Until 1743 the name influenza was not used at all in this\r\ncountry. The thing itself can be identified clearly enough in certain\r\ninstances from the earliest times. But there are periods, such as 1657-59,\r\n1678-79, and 1727-29 when short waves of epidemic catarrhs or catarrhal\r\nfevers came in the midst of longer waves of epidemic agues, “hot agues,”\r\nor intermittents, the whole being called by the people “the new disease,”\r\nor “the new ague,” while by physicians, such as Willis and Sydenham, they\r\nwere taken to be the distinguishable constituent parts of one and the same\r\nepidemic constitution. The last period in which epidemic agues were so\r\nrecognised and named in England was from 1780 to 1785; and in the midst of\r\nthat also there occurred an epidemic catarrh--the “influenza” of the year\r\n1782. It is possible that our own recent experience of a succession of\r\ninfluenzas, or strange fevers, from 1889 to 1893, in some respects the\r\nmost remarkable in the whole history, would have seemed an equally\r\ncomposite group if they had fallen in the 17th century and had been\r\ndescribed in the terminology of the time and according to the then\r\ndoctrines or nosological methods. Without prejudice to the distinctness\r\nand unity of the influenza-type in all periods of the history, I am\r\nunable, after trying the matter in various ways, to do otherwise than take\r\nthe epidemics of ague in chronological order along with the influenzas. As\r\nthe history will require the frequent use of the name “ague,” and, in due\r\ncourse, that of the name “influenza,” it will be useful to examine at the\r\noutset their respective etymologies and the meanings that usage has given\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nOriginally the English name ague did not mean a paroxysmal or intermittent\r\nfever, or a fever with a long cold fit followed by a hot fit, or the\r\nmalarial cachexia with sallowness, dropsy and enlarged spleen, or any\r\nother state of health arising from the endemic conditions which are known\r\nas malarial over so large a part of the globe in the tropical and\r\nsub-tropical zones. It meant simply _acuta_, the adjective of _febris\r\nacuta_ made into a substantive. Thus Higden’s reference in the\r\n_Polychronicon_ (which is exactly in the words of Giraldus Cambrensis a\r\ncentury and a half before) to the _febris acuta_ of Ireland is translated\r\nby Trevisa (14th cent.): “Men of that lond haue no feuere, but onliche the\r\nfeuere agu, and that wel silde whanne”; and by an anonymous translator:\r\n“The dwellers of hit be not vexede with the axes excepte the scharpe axes,\r\nand that is but selde[533].” Again in the MS. English translation of the\r\nLatin essay on plague by the bishop of Aarhus, the acute fever which is\r\ndescribed as the attendant or variant of bubo-plague proper (well known\r\nlong after as the pestilential fever, a malignant form of typhus), is thus\r\nrendered:\r\n\r\n    “As we see a sege or prevy next to a chambre, or of any other\r\n    particuler thyng which corrupteth the ayer in his substance and\r\n    qualitee: whiche is a thing maye happe every daye. And therof cometh\r\n    the ague of pestilence. And aboute the same many physicions be\r\n    deceyved, not supposing this axes to be a pestilence.... And suche\r\n    infirmite sometime is an axes, sometime a postume or a swellyng--and\r\n    that ys in many thinges.”\r\n\r\nThe same use of ague is continued in the first native English book on\r\nfevers, Dr John Jones’s ‘Dyall of Agues,’ which has chapters on plague as\r\nwell as on pestilential fever and on all other fevers including\r\nintermittents. In Ireland the name of ague was applied until a\r\ncomparatively late period to the indigenous typhus of the country, as if\r\nin literal translation of the _febris acuta_ first spoken of by Giraldus\r\nin the 12th century. Ague in early English meant any sharp fever, and most\r\ncommonly a continued fever. The special limitation to intermittents\r\nappears to have followed the revival of the study of the Graeco-Roman\r\nwriters on medicine, Galen above all, in the sixteenth century. But Jones,\r\nwho was freer than the more academical physicians of his time from\r\nclassical influences, is shrewd enough to see that it was a mistake to\r\ntransfer the experiences of Greece verbatim to England and to make them\r\nour standard of authority: he is speaking, however, not of intermittents\r\nbut of the simple ephemeral fever, or inflammatory fever of one day:\r\n\r\n    “Such as have the fever of heat or burning of the sun, sayeth Galen,\r\n    theyr skin is drye and hot as that which is perched with the sun; of\r\n    the which, in this orizon and countrye of oures, we have no great nede\r\n    to entreate of, leaving it to the phisitions and inhabitantes that\r\n    dwell nerer to the meridionall line and hoter regions, as Hispaine and\r\n    Africke[534].”\r\n\r\nAt a later date, when the Hippocratic tradition had displaced the Galenic,\r\nRogers of Cork, perhaps the earliest writer on fevers whose observations\r\nare essentially modern, has occasion thus to reflect upon the extreme\r\ndeference of Sydenham to his Greek model: “Again we learn from Hippocrates\r\nthat fevers in the warmer climates of Greece, at Naxos, Thasos or Paros,\r\nran their course in certain periods of time, which no ways answers in\r\nregions removed at a farther distance from the sun,”--Rogers himself\r\nhaving had no experience of intermittents among all the fevers and\r\ndysenteries that he saw from 1708 to 1734, although Cork was surrounded by\r\nmarshes[535].\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Latin translations of Greek medical writings by Linacre\r\nand Caius in the Tudor period, there were in this country actual\r\nexperiences of strange fevers, which were interpreted according to the\r\nGreek teaching of quotidians, tertians and quartans, with their several\r\nbastard or hybrid or larval forms. These, as I have said, were certainly\r\nnot the endemic fevers of malarious districts; they were, on the contrary,\r\nwidely prevalent all over the country during one or more seasons in\r\nsuccession and more occasional for a few years longer; then there would be\r\na clear interval of years, and again an universal epidemic of “the new\r\nfever,” “the new acquaintance,” “the new ague” or the like.\r\n\r\nSydenham, for example, has much to say of agues or intermittents prevalent\r\nin town and country for a series of years, and then disappearing for as\r\nlong a period as thirteen years at a stretch. But he does not count these\r\nas the agues of the marsh; his single reference to the latter is in his\r\nessay on Hysteria, where he interpolates a remark that, if one spends two\r\nor three days in a locality of marshes and lakes, the blood is in the\r\nfirst instance impressed with a certain spirituous miasma, which produces\r\nquartan ague, and that in turn is apt to be followed, especially in the\r\nmore aged, by a permanent cachectic state[536]. If Sydenham had intended\r\nto bring all the intermittents of his experience into that class, he would\r\nnot have left the paludal origin of them to a casual interpolated remark.\r\nOn the other hand, he refers the epidemic agues, which occupy his pen so\r\nmuch, to emanations from the bowels of the earth, according to a theory of\r\nhis friend Robert Boyle, applied by the latter to epidemical infections in\r\ngeneral and to epidemic colds or influenzas in particular. Sydenham and\r\nhis learned colleagues were not ignorant of the endemic agues of marshy\r\nlocalities, but they made little account of them in comparison with the\r\naguish or intermittent fevers that came in epidemics all over England.\r\n\r\nIn admitting the reality of such agues, we must be careful not to ascribe\r\nthem to such conditions as Talbor, the ague-curer, found in one village in\r\nEssex. We must be careful not to do so, because there are plausible\r\nreasons for doing so. The ground is much better drained now than formerly;\r\nthere is less standing water, fewer marshes, a much smaller extent of\r\nwater-logged soil. But the malarious parts of England have been tolerably\r\nwell defined at all times; and at all times the greater part of the\r\ncountry was as little malarious as it is now. It is the frequent reference\r\nto agues in old medical writings that has led some modern authors to\r\nconstruct a picture of a marshy or water-logged England, for which there\r\nis no warrant. Cromwell died of a tertian ague which he caught at Hampton\r\nCourt; therefore “the country round London in Cromwell’s time” must needs\r\nhave been “as marshy as the fens of Lincolnshire are now.” The country\r\nround London was much the same then as now, or as in John Stow’s time, or\r\nas in the medieval monk Fitzstephen’s time, or as it has ever been since\r\nthe last geological change. The ague of which Cromwell died in the autumn\r\nof 1658 was one of those which raged all over England from 1657 to\r\n1659--so extensively that Morton, who was himself ill of the same for\r\nthree months, says the country was “one vast hospital.” Whatever was the\r\ncause of that great epidemic of “agues,” and of others like it, we have no\r\nwarrant to assume that “the country round London,” or wherever else the\r\nepidemic malady prevailed, was then as marshy as the fens of\r\nLincolnshire[537].\r\n\r\nThe other name in the title of this chapter, influenza, appeared\r\ncomparatively late in the history. It is an Italian name, which is usually\r\ntaken to mean the influence of the stars. It may have got that sense by\r\npopular usage, but the original etymology was probably different. As early\r\nas the year 1554 the Venetian ambassador in London called the sweating\r\nsickness of 1551 an _influsso_, which is the Italian form of _influxio_.\r\nThe latter is the correct classical term for a humour, catarrh, or\r\ndefluxion, the Latin _defluxio_ itself having a more special limited\r\nmeaning. It was not astrology, but humoral pathology, that brought in the\r\nwords _influxio_ and _influsso_; and I suspect that influenza grew out of\r\nthe latter, but not out of the notion of an influence rained down by the\r\nheavenly bodies.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1743 that the Italian name of “influenza” first came to\r\nEngland[538], the rumour of a great epidemic, so called, at Rome and\r\nelsewhere in Italy having reached London a month or two before the disease\r\nitself. The epidemic of 1743 was soon over and the Italian name forgotten;\r\nso that when the same malady became common in 1762, some one with a good\r\nmemory or a turn for history remarked that it resembled “the disease\r\ncalled influenza” nearly twenty years before. After the epidemic of 1782,\r\nthe Italian name came into more general use, and from the beginning of the\r\npresent century it became at once popular and vague. The great epidemics\r\nof it in 1833 and 1847 fixed its associations so closely with catarrh that\r\nan “influenza cold” became an admitted synonym for coryza or any common\r\ncold attended with sharp fever. Lastly, the series of epidemics from 1889\r\nto 1893 effectually broke the association with coryza or catarrh.\r\n\r\nBefore influenza became adopted as the common English name towards the end\r\nof last century, what were the names popularly given to the malady in this\r\ncountry? The earliest references to it are in the medieval Latin\r\nchronicles under the name of _tussis_ or cough, or in some periphrasis. In\r\nthe fifteenth century the English name was “mure” or “murre,” which\r\nappears to be the same root as in murrain. Thus the St Albans Chronicle,\r\nunder the year 1427, enters a certain “infirmitas rheumigata,” which in\r\nEnglish was called “mure”; and the obituary of the monks of Canterbury\r\nabbey has two deaths from “empemata, id est, tussis et le murra[539].” In\r\nthe Tudor period there is no single distinctive name, unless it be “hot\r\nague”: in 1558 the name is “the new burning ague,” in 1562 “the new\r\nacquaintance,” in 1580 “the gentle correction,” and at various times in\r\nthe 17th century “the new disease,” “the new ague,” “the strange fever,”\r\n“the new delight,” “the jolly rant.” Robert Boyle called one sudden\r\noutbreak “a great cold.” Molyneux, of Dublin, mentions “a universal cold”\r\nin one year (1688), and “a universal transient fever” in another (1693).\r\nThe earlier 18th century writers mostly use the word catarrh or catarrhal\r\nfever, either in Latin or in English, the popular names probably\r\ncontinuing fanciful as before, as for example Horace Walpole’s “blue\r\nplagues.” That which stands out most clearly in the English naming from\r\nthe earliest times is the idea of something new or strange; but the\r\nnewness or strangeness pertained quite as much to the agues as to the\r\ncatarrhs. The notion of ague may be said to be uppermost in the 16th and\r\n17th centuries, that of catarrh in the 18th and 19th; while our very\r\nlatest experiences have once more brought a suggestion of ague to the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n\r\nRetrospect of Influenzas and Epidemic Agues in the 16th and 17th\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nIn the former volume of this history I have dealt with the various\r\nepidemics of “hot ague,” “new disease” or the like down to the epidemic of\r\n1657-59. It will be convenient to go over some of that ground again, with\r\na view to distinguish, if possible, the catarrhal types from the aguish,\r\nand to illustrate the use of the word ague as applied to a universal\r\nepidemic. Two of the epidemic seasons in the 16th century, 1510 and 1539,\r\nare too vaguely recorded for our purpose; but I shall review briefly the\r\nseasons from 1557-58 onwards.\r\n\r\n    It is known from the general historians that there were two seasons of\r\n    fever all over England in 1557 and 1558, of which the latter was the\r\n    more deadly, the type according to Stow, being “quartan agues.” In\r\n    letters of the time the epidemic of 1557 is variously named: thus\r\n    Margaret, Countess of Bedford, writes on 9 August from London to Sir\r\n    W. Cecil that she “trusts the sickness that reigns here will not come\r\n    to the camp [near St Quentin, where Francis, Earl of Bedford was]....\r\n    As for the ague, I fear not my son.” On the 18th of the same month,\r\n    Sir Nicholas Bacon writes from Bedford to Cecil: “Your god-daughter,\r\n    thanks be to God, is somewhat amended, her fits being more easy, but\r\n    not delivered of any. It is a double tertian that holds her, and her\r\n    nurse had a single, but it is gone clearly;” to which letter Lady\r\n    Bacon adds a postscript about “little Nan, trusting for all this\r\n    shrewd fever, to see her.” On 21 September, it appears that the\r\n    sickness had reached the English camp near St Quentin, for the Earl of\r\n    Bedford writes: “Our general is sick of an ague, our pay very slack,\r\n    and people grudge for want.” As late as the 25th October the Countess\r\n    of Bedford writes from London to Cecil that she “would not have him\r\n    come yet without great occasions, as there reigns such sickness at\r\n    London[540].”\r\n\r\n    Next year, 1558, the epidemic sickness returned in the summer and\r\n    autumn, in a worse form than before. Stow calls it “quartan agues,”\r\n    which destroyed many old people and especially priests, so that a\r\n    great number of parishes were unserved. Harrison, a canon of Windsor,\r\n    says that a third part of the people did taste the general sickness.\r\n    On the 6th September, sickness affected more than half the people in\r\n    Southampton, Portsmouth, and the Isle of Wight. From the 20th October\r\n    to the end of the year, no fewer than seven of the London aldermen\r\n    died, a number hardly equalled in the first sweating sickness of 1485,\r\n    and the queen (Mary) died of the lingering effects of an ague, which\r\n    was doubtless the reigning sickness. On 17th October, the English\r\n    commissioners being at Dunkirk to negotiate the surrender of Calais,\r\n    one of them, Sir William Pickering, fell “very sore sick of this new\r\n    burning ague: he has had four sore fits, and is brought very low, and\r\n    in danger of his life if they continue as they have done.” That year\r\n    Dr Owen published _A Meet Diet for the New Ague_, and himself died of\r\n    it in London on the 18th of October[541].\r\n\r\n    Fuller quaintly describes the ague of 1558 as “a dainty-mouthed\r\n    disease, which, passing by poor people, fed generally on principal\r\n    persons of greatest wealth and estate[542].” Roger Ascham wrote in\r\n    1562 to John Sturmius that, for four years past, or since 1558, “he\r\n    was afflicted with continual agues, that no sooner had one left him\r\n    but another presently followed; and that the state of his health was\r\n    so impaired and broke by them that an hectic fever seized his whole\r\n    body; and the physicians promised him some ease, but no solid\r\n    remedy[543].” Thoresby, the Leeds antiquary of the end of the 17th\r\n    century, found in the register of the parish of Rodwell, next to\r\n    Leeds, a remarkable proof of the fatality of these agues, which fully\r\n    bears out the general statements of Stow and Harrison. In 1557 the\r\n    deaths in the register rose from 20 to 76, and in 1558, which the\r\n    historians elsewhere say was the most fatal year, they rose to\r\n    124[544]. This was as severe as the sweating sickness of 1551, for\r\n    example in the adjoining parish of Swillington, or in the parish of\r\n    Ulverston, in Lancashire[545].\r\n\r\nThe English names of the epidemic sickness in the summers and autumns of\r\n1557 and 1558 are all in the class of agues--“this new burning ague,” “a\r\nstrange fever,” “divers strange and new sicknesses taking men and women in\r\ntheir heads, as strange agues and fevers,” “quartan agues.” One medical\r\nwriter, Dr John Jones, says in a certain place that “quartans were\r\nreigning everywhere,” and in another place, still referring to 1558, that\r\nhe himself had the sickness near Southampton, that it was attended by a\r\ngreat sweat, and that it was the same disease as the sweating sickness of\r\n1551. There were certainly two seasons of these agues, 1557 and 1558, the\r\nlatter being the worst; and it is probable from Short’s abstracts of a few\r\nparish registers in town and country that there was a third season of them\r\nin 1559. The year 1557 has been made an influenza year, perhaps because\r\nthe Italian writers have emphasized catarrhal symptoms here or there in\r\nthe epidemic of that year; while both the years 1557 and 1558 have been\r\nreceived into the chronology of epidemic or pandemic agues or malarial\r\nfevers[546]. There are perhaps a dozen English references in letters and\r\nchronicles to the sicknesses of those years, either to particular cases or\r\nto a general prevalence, but they do not enable us to distinguish a\r\ncatarrhal type in 1557 from the aguish type which they assert for both\r\n1557 and 1558.\r\n\r\nFour years after, another very characteristic influenza was prevalent in\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\n    Randolph writes from Edinburgh to Cecil in the end of November, 1562:\r\n    “Maye it please your Honer, immediately upon the Quene’s (Mary’s)\r\n    arivall here, she fell acquainted with a new disease that is common in\r\n    this towne, called here the newe acqayntance, which passed also\r\n    throughe her whole courte, neither sparinge lordes, ladies nor\r\n    damoysells, not so much as ether Frenche or English. It ys a plague in\r\n    their heades that have yt, and a sorenes in their stomackes, with a\r\n    great coughe, that remayneth with some longer, with others shorter\r\n    tyme, as yt findeth apte bodies for the nature of the disease. The\r\n    queen kept her bed six days. There was no appearance of danger, nor\r\n    manie that die of the disease, excepte some olde folkes. My lord of\r\n    Murraye is now presently in it, the lord of Lidingeton hathe had it,\r\n    and I am ashamed to say that I have byne free of it, seinge it seketh\r\n    acquayntance at all men’s handes[547].”\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that the interval between 1558 and 1562 may have been\r\noccupied with milder revivals of the original great epidemic, the one at\r\nEdinburgh counting in the series.\r\n\r\nIt appears from a Brabant almanack for the year 1561 that a sudden\r\ncatarrhal epidemic was quite on the cards in those years: the astronomer\r\nforetells for the month of September, 1561: “Coughs innumerable, which\r\nshall show such power of contagion as to leave few persons unaffected,\r\nespecially towards the end of the month[548].” There is an actual record\r\nfrom more than one country (Italy, Barcelona, as well as Edinburgh) of\r\nsuch universal catarrhs and coughs a year later than the one foretold. The\r\nItalian writers assign the universal catarrhs and coughs to the autumn of\r\n1562, the Barcelona writer to the winter solstice of that year, and the\r\nletter from Edinburgh to “the laste of November.”\r\n\r\nThe next undoubted influenza, that of 1580, was compared abroad to the\r\nEnglish sweat:\r\n\r\n    “In some places,” says Boekel, “the sick fell into sweats, flowing\r\n    more copiously in some than in others, so that a suspicion arose in\r\n    the minds of some physicians of that English sweat which laid waste\r\n    the human race so horribly in 1529;” and again, “the bodies were\r\n    wonderfully attenuated in a short time as if by a malignant sudden\r\n    colliquation, which made an end of the more solid parts, and took away\r\n    all strength[549].” The season of it was the summer.\r\n\r\n    The outbreak attracted much attention from its universality, and was\r\n    described by many abroad.\r\n\r\n    Boekel says that it was of such fierceness “that in the space of six\r\n    weeks it afflicted almost all the nations of Europe, of whom hardly\r\n    the twentieth person was free of the disease, and anyone who was so\r\n    became an object of wonder to others in the place.... Its sudden\r\n    ending after a month, as if it had been prohibited, was as marvellous\r\n    as its sudden onset.” It came up, he says, from Hungary and Pannonia\r\n    and extended to Britain. The principal English account of this\r\n    epidemic comes from Ireland[550]. In the month of August, 1580, during\r\n    the war against the Desmonds, an English force had advanced some way\r\n    through Kerry for the seizing of Tralee and Dingle; “but suddenlie\r\n    such a sicknes came among the soldiers, which tooke them in the head,\r\n    that at one instant there were above three hundred of them sicke. And\r\n    for three daies they laie as dead stockes, looking still when they\r\n    should die; but yet such was the good will of God that few died; for\r\n    they all recovered. This sicknesse not long after came into England\r\n    and was called the gentle correction.”\r\n\r\n    This outbreak among the troops in Ireland is said to have been in\r\n    August, before the sickness came to England. But it can be shown to\r\n    have been at its height in London in the month of July. The year 1580\r\n    was almost free from plague in London; the weekly deaths are at a\r\n    uniform low level (a good deal below the births) from January to\r\n    December, except for the abrupt rise shown in the following\r\n    table,--the kind of rise which we shall see from many other instances\r\n    to be the infallible criterion of an influenza[551]:\r\n\r\n    _Weekly Deaths in London._\r\n\r\n    1580.\r\n\r\n                        Deaths by     Dead of\r\n        Week ending     all causes    plague      Baptised\r\n\r\n        June  23           55           2           59\r\n         \"    30           47           4           57\r\n        July   7           77           4           65\r\n         \"    14          133           4           66\r\n         \"    21          146           3           61\r\n         \"    28           96           5           64\r\n        Aug.   4           78           5           73\r\n         \"    11           51           4           53\r\n         \"    18           49           1           72\r\n\r\n    As in 1557-58, the English references are to agues, both before and\r\n    after the Gentle Correction of July-August, 1580. Cogan says that for\r\n    a year or two after the Oxford gaol fever (1577) “the same kind of\r\n    ague raged in a manner all over England and took away many of the\r\n    strongest sort in their lustiest age, etc.” And he seems to have the\r\n    name “gentle correction” in mind when he says: “This kind of sickness\r\n    is one of those rods, and the most common rod, wherewith it pleaseth\r\n    God to brake his people for sin.” Cogan’s dates are indefinite. But\r\n    there is a letter of the Earl of Arundel to Lord Burghley, 19th\r\n    October, 1582, which shows that “hot ague” was epidemic as late as the\r\n    second autumn after the influenza proper: “The air of my house in\r\n    Sussex is so corrupt, even at this time of the year, as when I came\r\n    away I left twenty-four sick of hot agues.”\r\n\r\nTwo such epidemics in England as those of 1557-8 and 1580-82, of hot agues\r\nor strange fevers, taking the forms of simple tertian or double tertian or\r\nquartan or other of the classical types, would have made ague a familiar\r\ndisease, and its name a household word. For not only were there two or\r\nmore aguish seasons (usually the summer and autumn) in succession, but to\r\njudge by later experience there would have been desultory cases in the\r\nyears following, and in many of the seizures acquired during the height of\r\nthe epidemic, relapses or recurrences would have happened from time to\r\ntime or lingering effects would have remained. Hence it is unnecessary to\r\nassume that the agues that we hear casual mention of had been acquired by\r\nresidence in a malarious locality. They may have been, and most probably\r\nwere, the agues of some epidemic prevalent in all parts of the country.\r\nThese epidemics were the great opportunities of the ague-curers, as we\r\nshall see more fully in the sequel. It is to the bargaining of such an\r\nempiric with a patient that Clowes refers in 1579: “He did compound for\r\nfifteen pound to rid him within three fits of his ague, and to make him as\r\nwhole as a fish of all diseases.”\r\n\r\nThere were more sicknesses of that kind, perhaps not without a sweating\r\ncharacter, in the last ten years of the 16th century[552]. But they are\r\nindefinitely given as compared with earlier and later epidemics, and I\r\nshall pass to the next authentic instance.\r\n\r\n    The autumn of 1612 was undoubtedly a season of epidemic ague or “new\r\n    disease” in England[553]. When Prince Henry, eldest son of James I.,\r\n    fell ill in November, in London, during the gaieties attending the\r\n    betrothal of his sister the Princess Elizabeth to the Count Palatine\r\n    of the Rhine, a letter-writer of the time said of his illness: “It is\r\n    verily thought that the disease was no other than the ordinary ague\r\n    that hath reigned and raged almost all over England since the latter\r\n    end of summer[554].” The attack began in the end of October. The\r\n    spirited and popular prince had been leading the gaieties in place of\r\n    his father, who could not stand the fatigue, and was “seized by a\r\n    fever that came upon him at first with a looseness, but hath continued\r\n    a quotidian ever since Wednesday last [before the 4th of November],\r\n    and with more violence than it began, so that on Saturday he was let\r\n    blood by advice of most physicians, though Butler, of Cambridge, was\r\n    loth to consent. The blood proved foul: and that afternoon he grew\r\n    very sick.... I cannot learn that he had either speech or perfect\r\n    memory after Wednesday night, but lay, as it were, drawing on till\r\n    Friday between eight and nine of the evening that he departed. The\r\n    greatest fault is laid on Turquet, who was so forward to give him a\r\n    purge the day after he sickened, and so dispersed the disease, as\r\n    Butler says, into all parts; whereas if he had tarried till three or\r\n    four fits had been passed, they might the better have judged of the\r\n    nature of it; or if, instead of purging, he had let him blood before\r\n    it was so much corrupted, there had been more probability.” At the\r\n    dissection, the spleen was found “very black, the head full of clear\r\n    water and all the veins of the head full of clotted blood. Butler had\r\n    the advantage, who maintained that his head would be found full of\r\n    water, and Turquet that his brains would be found overflown and as it\r\n    were drowned in blood[555].” Butler, it appears, was “a drunken sot.”\r\n    When King James asked him what he thought of the prince’s case, he\r\n    replied “in his dudgeon manner” with a tag of verse from Virgil ending\r\n    with “et plurima mortis imago.” The Princess Elizabeth could not be\r\n    admitted to see her brother “because his disease was doubted to be\r\n    contagious[556].” It was at least epidemic, for in the same week\r\n    alderman Sir Harry Row and Sir George Carey, master of the wards, died\r\n    “of this new disease[557].” The earliest reference to it that I find\r\n    is the death, previous to 11 September, of Sir Michael Hicks at his\r\n    house Rackholt in Essex, “of a burning ague,” which came, as was\r\n    thought, by his often going into the water this last summer, he being\r\n    a man of years[558]; but much more probably was a case of “the\r\n    ordinary ague that hath reigned and raged almost all over England\r\n    since the latter end of summer.” The next year was still more\r\n    unhealthy, to judge by samples of parish registers; agues are\r\n    mentioned also in letters; thus, one going on 25 March, 1613, to visit\r\n    Sir Henry Savile, found him “in a fit, an ague having caught hold of\r\n    him[559].”\r\n\r\n    The winter of 1613-14 was marked by most disastrous floods in Romney\r\n    Marsh, in Lincolnshire, in the Isle of Ely, and about Wisbech, and\r\n    most of all in Norfolk[560]; but the malarious conditions so brought\r\n    about, being subsequent to, were not conceivably the cause of, the\r\n    epidemics of ague in the autumn of 1612 and 1613, which made so great\r\n    an excess of burials over christenings in the parish registers.\r\n\r\n    A curious record remains of an aguish sickness in a child, which had\r\n    begun about January, 1614. On 18 March, of that year, the dowager\r\n    Countess of Arundel wrote from Sutton, near Guildford, to her son Earl\r\n    Thomas, who was making the grand tour to Rome and elsewhere with his\r\n    wife, and had left the children to the care of their grandmother:\r\n    “Your two elder boys be very well and merry, but my swett Willm.\r\n    continueth his tersion agu still. This day we expect his twelfth fitt.\r\n    I assur myselfe teeth be the chefe cause. I look for so spedy ending\r\n    of it, he is so well and merry on his good days, and so strong as I\r\n    never saw old nor yonge bear it so well. I thank Jesu he hath not any\r\n    touch of the infirmity of the head, but onely his choler and flushe\r\n    apareth, but he is as lively as can be but in the time of his fits\r\n    onely, which continueth some eight hours[561].”\r\n\r\n    The epidemic of ague or “new disease,” which began to rage all over\r\n    England in the end of the summer, 1612, had probably recurred in the\r\n    years following, down to 1616. There is not a trace of plague during\r\n    those years in any known record; and yet they are among the most\r\n    unhealthy years in Short’s abstracts of town and country parish\r\n    registers[562].\r\n\r\nThe first half of the 17th century is a period which is almost a blank in\r\nthe conventional annals of “influenza” in Europe. But that period, which\r\nwas the period of the Thirty Years’ War, had many widespread sicknesses. I\r\ndo not wish to claim these as influenzas, or to contend that they were\r\ninfections equivalent thereto in diffusiveness. We may, however, find a\r\nplace for them in this context; for they were certainly as mysterious as\r\nany epidemics admitted into the canon of influenzas. So far as concerns\r\nBritain, the first was the epidemic ague, or “new disease,” of 1612 and\r\n1613, probably recurring until 1616. The second was the universal spotted\r\nfever of 1623 and 1624, of which I have given an account in the chapter on\r\ntyphus. That was followed by the plague of 1625, and that again by a\r\nharvest ague in the country in the end of the same year. The next epidemic\r\nague or “general sickness, called the new disease,” fell mostly in England\r\nupon the two years 1638 and 1639. It was in part a harvest ague, “a\r\nmalignant fever raging so fiercely about harvest that there appeared\r\nscarce hands enough to take in the corn[563]”; but it was also a winter\r\ndisease. I pass over the war-typhus of 1643, to which the name of “new\r\ndisease” was also given, and the widespread fever of the year following.\r\nIn 1651 we hear again of a strange ague, which “first broke out by the\r\nseaside in Cheshire, Lancashire and North Wales,” eighty or a hundred\r\nbeing sick of it at once in small villages. Whitmore, who saw this\r\nepidemic in Cheshire, identified it with the Protean disease which he\r\ndescribed in 1657-58, and hazarded the theory that the former was a\r\ndiluted or “more remiss” infection carried by the wind from Ireland, where\r\nthe plague was then raging, in Dublin, Galway, Limerick and other places,\r\nafter their sieges or occupations by the army of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThus in the first half of the 17th century we have more or less full\r\nevidence of epidemics of “new disease” in 1612-13, 1623-24, 1625, 1638-9,\r\n1643-4 and 1651, not one of which was an influenza as we understand the\r\nterm[564].\r\n\r\nWe come at length to the years 1657-59, in the course of which one\r\ncatarrhal epidemic, or perhaps two, did prevail for a few weeks. The hot\r\nagues or “new disease” had been raging all over the country from the\r\nsummer of 1657; then in April, 1658, there came suddenly universal coughs\r\nand catarrhs, “as if a blast from the stars”; they ceased, and the hot\r\nagues dragged on through the summer and autumn. A letter from London, 26\r\nOctober, 1658, says: “A world of sickness in all countries round about\r\nLondon: London is now held to be the wholesomest place,” and adds that\r\n“there is a great death of coach-horses almost in every place, and it is\r\ncome into our fields[565].” It was after this, in the spring of 1659, if\r\nWhitmore has made no mistake in his dates, that coughs and catarrhs\r\n“universally infested London, scarce leaving a family where any store\r\nwere, without some being ill of this distemper.” The details have been\r\ngiven fully in the former volume[566]. I wish merely to remark here that\r\nthe two catarrhal epidemics, or influenzas proper, in two successive\r\nsprings, were sharply defined episodes in the midst of a period of\r\nepidemic agues, and that the “new disease” as a whole, during the two or\r\nthree years that it lasted, had such an effect in the way of ill health\r\nand mortality that it was afterwards viewed as a “little plague” worthy of\r\nbeing set in comparison with the Great Plague of 1665.\r\n\r\nWillis does not say that the epidemic agues lasted after 1658, perhaps\r\nbecause his essay was printed early in 1659; but Whitmore, whose preface\r\nis dated November, 1659, says, without distinguishing the hot ague from\r\nthe catarrhal fever but speaking of them both as one Protean malady: “it\r\nnow begins again, seizing on all sorts of people of different nature,\r\nwhich shows that it is epidemic.” Sydenham does not appear upon the scene\r\nuntil 1661; but when his epidemic constitutions do begin, it is with\r\nintermittents or agues, which lasted, according to him, until 1664.\r\nPerhaps if Sydenham’s experience had extended back to 1657 he would have\r\nmade his aguish constitution to begin with that year, and to go on\r\ncontinuously until 1664. At all events it does not appear that the year\r\n1660 was a clear interval between Willis’s and Whitmore’s period of\r\n1657-59, Sydenham’s period of 1661-64; for it so happens that John Evelyn\r\nhas left the following note of his own illness:\r\n\r\n    “From 17 February to 5 April [1660] I was detained in bed with a kind\r\n    of double tertian, the cruell effects of the spleene and other\r\n    distempers, in that extremity that my physicians, Drs Wetherburn,\r\n    Needham and Claude were in great doubts of my recovery.” Towards the\r\n    decline of his sickness he had a relapse, but on the 14th April “I was\r\n    able to go into the country, which I did to my sweete and native aire\r\n    at Wooton.” On the 9th of May he was still so weak as to be unable to\r\n    accompany Lord Berkeley to Breda with the address inviting Charles II.\r\n    to assume the crown.\r\n\r\nSydenham makes the “constitution” which began for him in 1661 to decline\r\ngradually, and to end definitely in 1664, after which he finds\r\nintermittents wholly absent for thirteen years, or until 1677. This clear\r\ninterval will make a convenient break in the chronology, whereat we may\r\nbring in the popular and professional notions of ague then current, and\r\nthe popular practice in that disease by empirics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ague-Curers of the 17th Century.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that all the respectable writers of the profession\r\nspeak of agues or intermittents as epidemic over the country for a\r\ndefinite period, and as disappearing thereafter for years together. At the\r\nsame time they say little or nothing of the endemic malarious fevers of\r\nmarshy localities. Further, it appears that the professed ague-curers,\r\nalthough they would wish to represent ague as a perennial disease, are\r\nreally basing upon the same experiences of occasional epidemics which\r\nWillis, Whitmore and Sydenham recorded as occasional. The best instance of\r\nthis is the ‘Pyretologia’ by Drage of Hitchin. It was published for\r\npractice in 1665, being designed to show forth the author’s skill as an\r\nague-curer[567]. When we examine its generalities closely, we find that\r\nthey all come from the sickly season of 1657, the first of those described\r\nby Willis.\r\n\r\n    The great autumnal epidemic of that year (and the following), which we\r\n    know from other sources to have been reckoned a “little plague,” he\r\n    describes as “a malignant sickness,” which was followed in the winter\r\n    by quartans. He himself escaped the autumnal fever but he incurred the\r\n    quartan later in the year. In his own case, while the original\r\n    paroxysm of this ague was still going on, a new one arose towards\r\n    evening, and again, on the following day, a new paroxysm gathered\r\n    vigour and supplanted the old, becoming the substantive paroxysm. Many\r\n    of those who died of the quartan in 1657 had either the paroxysms\r\n    duplicated, or a total want of them, or, in another passage, “the\r\n    quartan which followed the autumnal disease of heterogeneous quality\r\n    in 1657, cut off divers old people, the fever being erratic,\r\n    duplicated or triplicated.” It was a bad sign when the quartan became\r\n    doubled or trebled; regularity of the paroxysm was a sign of a good\r\n    recovery. The symptoms of a quartan are various; but it is not easy to\r\n    pronounce that these all are the symptoms of an intermittent fever, or\r\n    the prodromal signs thereof, unless intermittent fevers be epidemic at\r\n    the time. He gives the case of a civil and pious priest who had a\r\n    tedious quartan from being struck with lightning; he was confined to\r\n    bed for two years, with loss of hearing, but, strangely enough,\r\n    retaining the use of his eyes; sometimes he was vexed with\r\n    convulsions, sometimes with quartan fever. The “plebs medicorum” say\r\n    that a quartan fever comes of melancholy, a tertian of choler, a\r\n    quotidian of putrefied pituitous matter. The “plebs plebis” think that\r\n    the cause is wind or flatus, and that they get rid of the ague by\r\n    belching. In his own case he observed that if he drank more cold ale\r\n    than usual, he was seized with distension in the loins and with\r\n    palpitation, and belched up “flatus and crass vapours infected with\r\n    the quality of a quartan.” He knew a man who, in the fourth or fifth\r\n    month of a quartan, drank wine too freely, so that the paroxysms came\r\n    every day, and that violently; after a week he had an especially\r\n    severe paroxysm, and then no more for three weeks, when the fever\r\n    returned under the type of an exquisite quartan. One case, which he\r\n    mentions twice, led him to doubt whether quartans were not catching:\r\n    a certain girl suffering from a quartan asked her father, who was\r\n    skilled in the art, to open a vein; her parent declared that during\r\n    the blooding the morbid smell of the flowing blood reached his\r\n    nostrils, so that he was seized of his daughter’s fever at the proper\r\n    time of her paroxysms, having three or four ague fits in due order;\r\n    meanwhile the girl was free from the paroxysms for a whole week, but\r\n    no longer. The singular nature of quartans is further brought out in\r\n    the fact that papules, pustules and exanthems breaking out on the skin\r\n    were quite common in the quartan fever which followed the malignant\r\n    epidemic of the autumn of 1657. “In the fevers hardly any heat is\r\n    perceived; and so the unskilled vulgar say ‘This is an ague’ (Hoc est\r\n    anglicè _Ague_), and ‘This is fever and ague’ (Et hoc est febris et\r\n    anglicè _Ague_) when cold and heat are mixed equally or combined\r\n    regularly.” Peruvian bark does not evacuate the morbific matter unless\r\n    by chance it provokes vomiting; cases treated by it often relapse, and\r\n    are not well in the intervals. Bark does not occur in his own\r\n    prescriptions; but he had cured many with “pentaphyllum.” He knew\r\n    several physicians in the epidemic of quartans in 1657 who trusted to\r\n    narcotics entirely.\r\n\r\nDrage must have had a real experience of aguish distempers of one kind or\r\nanother during the sickly seasons of 1657-59. But it is clear from the\r\nessays or advertisements of empirics that agues were discovered in many\r\nforms of sickness that were neither intermittent fevers nor fevers of any\r\ndistinctive type. One of these practitioners in the time of Charles I.\r\nclaims to be “the king’s majesty’s servant in ordinary[568]”; which is not\r\nincredible, as Sir Robert Talbor, whom Charles II. deigned to honour, was\r\nan ague-curer of the same class.\r\n\r\n    “An ague, which hitherto amongst all sorts hath been accounted the\r\n    physitian’s shame, both for definition and cure (thus farre hath\r\n    ignorance prevailed), but that the contrary is manifest appeareth\r\n    sufficiently by this following definition: and shall be cured whether\r\n    tertian, quartern or quotidian, by me Aaron Streater, physitian of\r\n    Arts in Oxford, approved by Authority, the King’s Majesties servant in\r\n    ordinary, and dwelling against the Temple, three houses up in\r\n    Chancerie Lane, next house to the Golden Anchor.” An ague, he goes on,\r\n    “is either interpolate (intermittent) or continual; it is either\r\n    engendered of a melancholic humour or it is a splenetic effect; the\r\n    liver is obstructed by abundance of choler proceeding from a salt\r\n    rheum that cometh from the brain” etc. Agues are to be dreaded most\r\n    for their remote effects: “Say not therefore, ‘It is but an ague, but\r\n    a feaver; I shall wear it out.’ Dally not with this disease;” and he\r\n    adds a case to show what people may come to if they neglect an ague at\r\n    the beginning: “Being carried downe from London to South-hampton by\r\n    Master Thomas Mason,--September 1640, word was brought me of a Mayd\r\n    dead, 16 years of age: and being requested to see what disease she\r\n    dyed of, I took my chirurgion with me and went. And after section or\r\n    search, I found as followeth: a gallon and a half of green water in\r\n    the belly, that stunk worse than carrion; under the lyver an impostume\r\n    as bigg as my fist, full of green black corrupted matter, and the\r\n    lyver black and rot. The spleen and kidneys wholly decayed, and the\r\n    place as black as soot; the bowels they were fretted, ulcerated and\r\n    rotten. In the chesse was two great handfuls of black burnt blood in\r\n    dust or powder; the heart was all sound, but not a drop of blood in\r\n    it; nor one spoonfull in the whole body.\r\n\r\n    Here was an Annatomy indeed, skinne and bone; and I verily beleeve\r\n    that there was no braine left, but that she lived while that was\r\n    moyst: the sent was so ill, and I not well, that I forbore to search\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    God that knowes the secrets of all hearts knowes this is a truth, and\r\n    nothing else here written. Arthur Fauset, chirurgion at Southampton,\r\n    was the man I employed to cut her up, as many there can witness that\r\n    were present.\r\n\r\n    And what of all this, may some say? Why this. An eight weeks’ ague in\r\n    the neglect of it breeds all these diseases, and finally death.”\r\n\r\nLet us take next the advertisement of an apothecary a generation after,\r\nwho professed to cure Kentish agues,--“the description and cure of Kentish\r\nand all other agues ... and humbly showing (in a measure) the author’s\r\njudgment why so many are not cured, with advice in relation thereunto,\r\nwhether it be Quotidian, Tertian or Quartan, simple, double or\r\ntriple[569].” Before the Fire of London he had practised in Mark Lane, but\r\nafter his house was destroyed he removed to Kent, attending Maidstone\r\nmarket every Thursday, and residing at Rochester, a city which, “besides\r\nbeing subject to diseases in common with others, hath two diseases more\r\nepidemical, namely, the Scurvey for one but the Ague in special.” The\r\nsymptoms of scurvy, as he gives them, cover perhaps the one moiety of\r\ndisease, and those of ague the other.\r\n\r\n    Agues are of two sorts, curable and incurable; the curable are those\r\n    that come in a common way of Providence, the incurable those that are\r\n    sent more immediately from God in the way of special judgment, as\r\n    instances adduced from Scripture show. What is an ague? Some think it\r\n    is a strange thing, they know not what; the more ignorant think it is\r\n    an evil spirit, but coming they know not whence. Agues have their seat\r\n    in the humours either within the vessels or without them; those\r\n    residing within are continual quotidians, continual tertians,\r\n    continual quartans; those without are intermittent ditto. (This\r\n    distinction of within and without the vessels is traditional, and is\r\n    found in Jones’s _Dyall of Agues_ as well as in Dutch medical books a\r\n    century later.) The paroxysms of the intermittents are really the\r\n    uprising of the Archaeus [of van Helmont], or spirit, to oppose the\r\n    rottenness of the humours. A quartan is harder to cure than any other\r\n    ague; part of its cure is an old 14th-century rule of letting blood in\r\n    the plague; “let blood in the left hand in the vein between the ring\r\n    finger and the little finger, which said thing to my knowledge was\r\n    done about sixteen years ago [to say nothing of three hundred years\r\n    ago] by the empiric Parker in this country, with very good success and\r\n    to his great honour and worldly advancement.” This ague-curer says\r\n    little of Peruvian bark; his specific is the powder of Riverius, “the\r\n    preparation of which, as well as some of the powder itself is lately\r\n    and providentially come to my hands.” Three doses cost not above five\r\n    shillings, “and I never yet gave more in the most inveterate of these\r\n    diseases.... My opinion is that he that will not freely part with a\r\n    crown out of his pocket to be eased of such a disease in his body\r\n    deserves to keep it.”\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated ague-curer of the Restoration period was Sir Robert\r\nTalbor, who thus describes the high motives that made him a\r\nspecialist[570]:\r\n\r\n    “When I first began the study and practice of Physick, amongst other\r\n    distempers incident to humane bodies I met with a quartan ague, a\r\n    disease that seemed to me the _ne plus ultra_ of physic, being\r\n    commonly called Ludibrium et Opprobrium Medicorum, folly and derision\r\n    of my profession, did so exasperate my spirit that I was resolved to\r\n    do what study or industry could perform to find out a certain method\r\n    for the cure of this unruly distemper.... I considered there was no\r\n    other way to satisfy my desire but by that good old way, observation\r\n    and experiment. To this purpose I planted myself in Essex near to the\r\n    seaside, in a place where agues are the epidemical diseases, where you\r\n    will find but few persons but either are, or have been afflicted with\r\n    a tedious quartan. In this place I lived some years, making the best\r\n    use of my time I could for the improving my knowledge.”\r\n\r\nTalbor’s first chapter is a fluent account of how agues are produced by\r\n“obstructions” of the spleen. This was a matter of theoretical pathology\r\nwhich an empiric could make a show with as well as another. But the\r\nempiric betrays himself as soon as he comes to practice. The enlarged\r\nspleen of repeated agues, or of the malarial cachexia, is commonly known\r\nas the ague-cake. There is no doubt that much of the unhappiness of the\r\naguish habit resides in the ague-cake, and that one of the best pieces of\r\ntreatment is to apply counter-irritants or the actual cautery to the left\r\nside, against which the enlarged spleen presses as a cake-like mass.\r\nTalbor, however, desired to free the patient from his “ague-cake”\r\naltogether:\r\n\r\n    “I have observed these in four patients: two were cast out the stomach\r\n    by nature, and the other two by emetic medicines. One of them was like\r\n    a clotted piece of phlegm, about the bigness of a walnut, pliable like\r\n    glue or wax, weighing about half an ounce; another about the bigness\r\n    of the yolk of a pullet’s egg, and like it in colour, but stiffer,\r\n    weighing about five drachms; the other two of a dark colour, more\r\n    tough, about the like bigness, and heavier. It is a general\r\n    observation amongst them that their ague comes away when they see\r\n    those ague-cakes[571].”\r\n\r\nHaving followed this “good old way of observation and experiment” for\r\nseveral years among the residents of the Essex marshes, Talbor came to\r\nLondon, and set up his sign next door to Gray’s Inn Gate in Holborn. In\r\n1672 (14th July) he issued a small work with a Greek title--the quacks\r\nwere fond of the Greek character on their title-pages--“Πυρετολογια, a\r\nrational account of the cause and cure of agues, with their signs:\r\nwhereunto is added a short account of the cause and cure of feavers.” He\r\nmade a bid also for practice in “scurvy,” a disease of landsmen in those\r\ntimes which was more a bogey than ague itself--“a strange monster acting\r\nits part upon the stage of this little world in various shapes,\r\ncounterfeiting the guise of most other diseases ... sometimes it is\r\ncouchant, other times rampant, so alternately chronic and acute.”\r\n\r\nMost of the agues which Talbor professed to have met with in London in\r\nthose years must have been equally factitious: for Sydenham, who makes\r\nmore of “intermittents” than other writers of repute, was of opinion that,\r\nfor thirteen years from 1664 to 1677, fevers of that type had not been\r\nseen in London, except some sporadic cases or cases in which the attack\r\nhad begun in the country. But the air was then full of talk and\r\ncontroversy about Peruvian bark, or Jesuits’ powder (_pulvis patrum_), or\r\n“the cortex,” which was cried up as a specific in agues by some, and cried\r\ndown by others. Talbor had seized upon this specific, and claimed to have\r\nan original way of administering it, whereby its success was assured. We\r\nget a glimpse of his practice from Dr Philip Guide, a Frenchman who came\r\nto London and practised for many years as a member of the College of\r\nPhysicians[572]. Talbor had cured the daughter of Lady Mordaunt of an\r\nague, and the cure had reached the ears of Charles II. One of the French\r\nprincesses having been long afflicted with a quartan ague,\r\n\r\n    “The king commanded Mr Talbor to take a turn at Paris, and as a mark\r\n    of distinction he honoured him with the title of knight. He succeeded\r\n    wonderfully. But he could not cure Lady Mordaunt’s daughter a second\r\n    time, whom he had cured once before at London, by whom he gained most\r\n    of his reputation.” He tried for two months, but did not relieve the\r\n    symptoms. Dr Guide was called in, and being asked to give his opinion\r\n    of the ague that the young lady was afflicted with, “after some\r\n    inquiry I found her distemper was complicated and quite different from\r\n    the ague, which made me lay the thought of the ague aside, and apply\r\n    myself wholly to the complicated disease, which I effectually cured in\r\n    twelve days, together with her ague, without having any further need\r\n    of the infallible specific of Sir Robert Talbor.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peruvian Bark Controversy.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be doubted that the conflicting opinions as to the benefit\r\nof Peruvian bark in ague, which have been often cited in disparagement of\r\nmedicine and as an example of its intolerance, arose from the\r\nindiscriminate use of it in “agues” diagnosed as such by quacks and\r\npushing practitioners. The bark had been brought first to Spain in 1632\r\nand had been tried medicinally in 1639[573]. It was under the powerful\r\npatronage of the Jesuits, especially of Cardinal de Lugo, and most of it\r\nat that time found its way to Rome, the centre of a malarious district. In\r\n1652 it failed to cure a “double quartan” in an Austrian archduke, and\r\nthereafter fell into some disrepute. A violent controversy on its specific\r\nuse in agues arose in the Netherlands; it had failed in every case at\r\nBrussels, it had not failed in a single case at Delft. Meanwhile it\r\nremained, very dear, sixty florins having been paid at Brussels in 1658\r\nfor as much as would make twenty doses, to be sent to Paris. The London\r\n‘Mercurius Politicus’ of the week 9-16 December, 1658, contained an\r\nadvertisement[574] that a supply of it had been brought over by James\r\nThompson, merchant of Antwerp, and was to be had either at his own\r\nlodgings at the Black Spotted Eagle in the Old Bailey or at Mr John\r\nCrook’s, bookseller, at the sign of the Ship in St Paul’s Churchyard. The\r\nLondon physicians such as Prujean and Brady countenanced it, and Willis,\r\nin reprinting his essay on Fevers in 1660, spoke of it as coming into\r\ndaily use. Sydenham, whose publisher was the same Crook at the sign of the\r\nShip, made a brief reference to it in the first edition (1666) of his\r\n_Observationes Medicae_, in the section upon the epidemic constitution of\r\nintermittents during the years 1661-64. He admits that the bark could keep\r\ndown fermentation for the time being; but the _materies_ which the\r\nfermentation would have dissipated if it had been allowed its way, will\r\nremain in the system and quickly renew its power. He had known a quartan\r\ncontinue for several years under the use of bark. It had even killed some\r\npatients when given immediately before the paroxysm. Prudently and\r\ncautiously given, in the decline of such fevers, it had been sometimes\r\nuseful and had stopped the paroxysms altogether, especially if the aguish\r\nfits were occurring at a season when the malady was less epidemical. But\r\nit is clear that Sydenham in 1666 inclined strongly to non-interference\r\nwith the natural depuratory action of the fever upon the _materies_ of the\r\ndisease. His teaching that the cortex, while it kept down the fermentation\r\nof the blood for a time, left the dregs of the fever behind, was thus\r\npopularly stated some years after by Roger North in relating the fatal\r\nillness of his brother the Lord Keeper Guilford in the summer of\r\n1685[575].\r\n\r\n    The fever of Lord Guilford was not an intermittent at all, but a\r\n    “burning acute fever without any notable remissions and no\r\n    intermissions,” a case of the epidemic typhus of that and the\r\n    succeeding year, elsewhere described. The treatment was first in the\r\n    hands of Dr Masters, pupil and successor of Dr Willis, whose cardinal\r\n    doctrine of fevers was that they were a natural fermentation of the\r\n    blood. He ordered phlebotomy. Next Dr Short, of another school, was\r\n    sent for: “So to work with his cortex to take it off: and it was so\r\n    done; but his lordship continued to have his headache and want of\r\n    sleep. He gave him quieting potions, as they called them, which were\r\n    opiates to make him sleep; but he ranted and renounced them as his\r\n    greatest tormentors, saying ‘that they thought all was well if he did\r\n    not kick off the clothes and his servant had his natural rest; but all\r\n    that while he had axes and hammers and fireworks in his head, which he\r\n    could not bear.’ All these were very bad signs; but yet he seemed to\r\n    mend considerably; and no wonder, his fever being taken off by the\r\n    cortex. And it is now found that, without there be an intermission of\r\n    the fever, the cortex doth but ingraft the venom to shoot out again\r\n    more perniciously.” The Lord Keeper’s illness dragged on, and at\r\n    length the physicians “found he had a lent fever which was growing up\r\n    out of the dregs which the cortex had left; and if it were not taken\r\n    off, they knew he would soon perish. So they plied him with new doses\r\n    of the same under the name of cordial powders, whereof the quantity he\r\n    took is scarce credible; but they would not touch his fever any more\r\n    than so much powder of port. And still he grew worse and worse. At\r\n    length the doctors threw up[576].”\r\n\r\nSydenham having indicated in his edition of 1666 that bark was dangerous\r\nwhen given immediately before a paroxysm, but that it was sometimes useful\r\nin the decline of the fever, and that its benefits were greatest in those\r\ndesultory agues which appeared at, or continued into, a season when agues\r\nhad become less epidemical, he proceeded in his third edition of 1675 to\r\nenlarge these indications for giving bark in ague. He begins, as Talbor\r\nhad begun in his essay of 1672, and as the empiric Streater had in his\r\nadvertisement of 1641, by calling quartans the _opprobrium medicorum_, and\r\nhe then lays down precisely how bark was to be given in those obstinate\r\nfevers, as well as in tertians of the aged or feeble: namely, after the\r\nfever had exhausted itself _suo Marte_, in the intervals between two\r\nparoxysms, an ounce of bark (in two ounces of syrup of roses) to be taken\r\nin the course of the two free days, a fourth part at a time morning and\r\nevening. The dosage may have been borrowed from Talbor, as Sir George\r\nBaker alleges[577]; it matters little for anyone’s fame. Sydenham,\r\nhowever, in a letter of October, 1677, thus claimed to have been\r\nindependent of Talbor so far as concerned the directions for giving bark\r\nwhich he inserted in his edition of 1675:\r\n\r\n    “I have had but few trials, but I am sure that an ounce of bark, given\r\n    between the two fits, cures; which the physicians in London not being\r\n    pleased to take notice of in my book, or not believing me, have given\r\n    an opportunity to a fellow that was but an apothecary’s man, to go\r\n    away with all the practice on agues, by which he has gotten an estate\r\n    in two months, and brought great reproach on the faculty[578].”\r\n\r\nTalbor was patronised by Charles II., who caused him to be made one of his\r\nphysicians. On 2 May, 1678, a few months after the date of Sydenham’s\r\nletter, Lord Arlington wrote to the president of the College of\r\nPhysicians[579]: “His Majesty, having received great satisfaction in the\r\nabilities and success of Dr Talbor for the cure of agues, has caused him\r\nto be admitted and sworn one of his physicians.” Next year, 1679, the king\r\nhad an attack of the reigning ague, and a recurrence of it in 1680. It is\r\nprobably to the occasion of one or other of these attacks that an undated\r\nletter belongs from the Marquis of Worcester to the marchioness: “The\r\nphysicians came to the Council to acquaint them that they intend to give\r\nthe king the Jesuit’s powder five or six times before he goes to\r\nNewmarket, which they agreed to. He looks well, eats two meals of meat a\r\nday, as he used to do[580].” Evelyn has preserved a story told him by the\r\nMarquis of Normanby, which probably relates to the same aguish attack of\r\nCharles II.[581]:\r\n\r\n    “The physicians would not give the _quinquina_ to the king, at a time\r\n    when, in a dangerous ague, it was the only thing that could cure him\r\n    (out of envy, because it had been brought into vogue by Mr Tudor\r\n    [Talbor] an apothecary), till Dr Short, to whom the king sent to know\r\n    his opinion of it privately, sent word to the king that it was the\r\n    only thing which could save his life, and then the king enjoined his\r\n    physicians to give it to him, which they did, and he recovered. Being\r\n    asked by this lord [Normanby] why they would not prescribe it, Dr\r\n    Lower said it would spoil their practice, or some such expression.”\r\n\r\nWhat Dr Lower was most likely to have said was, that it went against his\r\nprinciples to give bark in fevers. He was a physiologist, in the sense of\r\nan anatomist, the pupil of Willis at Oxford and his successor in practice\r\nin London. It was the teaching of Willis that blood was like the juice of\r\nvegetables, particularly the juice of the grape, in respect of fermenting,\r\njust as it was like milk in respect of curdling. Fever was a sudden access\r\nof fermentation, apt to arise in spring and autumn, from internal or\r\nconstitutional occasions, as well as to come at any time by infection; by\r\nthis febrile ferment, ebullition or commotion, the blood was purged of\r\ncertain impurities, comparable to the lees of wine, which were removed\r\nfrom the body in the sweat, the urine or other critical evacuation.\r\nJesuit’s bark was believed to check fermentation, or, in the later phrase\r\nof Pringle and others, it was antiseptic; and it was probably because he\r\nthought it would check the natural defaecating action of the blood in an\r\nague that Lower refused to prescribe it. Sydenham was more tentative,\r\npliant, empirical. He cavilled at Willis’s doctrine of the ebullition or\r\nfermentation of the blood without actually rejecting it; for he held\r\npractically the same view of the salutary or depuratory nature of fever,\r\nwhich was indeed the Hippocratic view of it. Accordingly in his first\r\nreference to bark, in 1666, he sustains the objection to it, that it\r\ninterfered with a natural depuratory action; and it was only in following\r\nthe lead of Talbor, a more empirical person than himself, that Sydenham\r\novercame his doctrinal scruples. Dr Short, to whom Charles II. sent\r\nprivately for advice, was of Sydenham’s party; soon after that occasion,\r\nthe latter dedicated to Short his ‘Tractate on Gout and Dropsy’ (1683). It\r\nwas Short who “went to work with his cortex” upon the Lord Keeper in 1685,\r\nafter Dr Masters, of the school of Willis, had tried his hand with\r\nphlebotomy. The king’s experiences, a few months before the Lord Keeper’s\r\ndeath, had been just the same, and with the same result: the deathbed of\r\nCharles II., it is well known, was the scene of ecclesiastical rivalries;\r\nbut the physicians at the bedside of the king had their rivalries too.\r\n\r\nOn Monday the 2nd of February, at eight in the morning, the king had a\r\nseizure of some kind in his bed-chamber, which was currently said to have\r\nbeen an “apoplectic fit[582],” although there is nothing said of\r\nparalysis. A letter of the 3rd February[583] says the king “was seized in\r\nhis chair and bed-chamber with a surprising convulsion fit which lasted\r\nthree hours.” Dr King, an expert operator who had assisted Lower in the\r\ndelicate operation before the Royal Society on 23 November, 1667, of\r\ntransfusing blood from one body to another, happened to be at hand, and,\r\nat once drawing his lancet, bled the king. His promptitude in action,\r\nwhich probably left him little time for diagnosis, was much applauded, and\r\nthe Privy Council voted him a reward of a thousand pounds, which Burnet\r\nsays he never received.\r\n\r\n    “This rescued his Majesty for the instant,” says Evelyn, (who came up\r\n    from Wooton on hearing the news, and is probably correct in his\r\n    narrative), “but it was only a short reprieve. He still complained,\r\n    and was relapsing, often fainting, with sometimes epileptic symptoms,\r\n    till Wednesday, for which he was cupp’d, let blood in both jugulars,\r\n    had both vomit and purges, which so reliev’d him that on Thursday\r\n    hopes of recovery were signified in the public Gazette; but that day,\r\n    about noone, the physitians thought him feverish. This they seem’d\r\n    glad of, as being more easily allay’d and methodically dealt with than\r\n    his former fits; so as they prescribed the famous Jesuit’s powder: but\r\n    it made him worse, and some very able doctors who were present did not\r\n    think it a fever, but the effect of his frequent bleeding and other\r\n    sharp operations us’d by them about his head, so that probably the\r\n    powder might stop the circulation, and renew his former fits, which\r\n    now made him very weake. Thus he pass’d Thursday night with greate\r\n    difficulty, when, complaining of a paine in his side, they drew 12\r\n    ounces more of blood from him; this was by 6 in the morning on Friday,\r\n    and it gave him reliefe; but it did not continue, for being now in\r\n    much paine, and struggling for breath, he lay dozing, and after some\r\n    conflicts, the physitians despairing of him, he gave up the ghost at\r\n    halfe an houre after eleven in the morning, being 6 Feb. 1685, in the\r\n    36th yeare of his reigne, and 54th of his age.... Thus died King\r\n    Charles II. of a vigorous and robust constitution, and in all\r\n    appearance promising a long life[584].”\r\n\r\nWhether the bark would have saved him if the aguish nature of the\r\nparoxysms (such as he had in 1679 and again in 1680) had been clear from\r\nthe first, may be doubted. But his chances of recovery were certainly made\r\nworse by the halting and stumbling diagnosis, (according to Evelyn)--now\r\napoplexy, now epilepsy, now fever[585].\r\n\r\nThe true value of cinchona bark in medicine was not seen until much that\r\nwas vague in the use of the term “ague” had been swept away. In the last\r\ngreat epidemic period of agues in this country, as we shall see, from 1780\r\nto 1786, bark was found, for some reason, to be ineffective. It is not in\r\nthe treatment of epidemic agues, but of agues in malarious countries, that\r\nthe benefits of Jesuits’ bark have been from first to last most obvious.\r\n\r\nThe practice in so-called agues was long in the hands of empirics, who,\r\nlike their class in general, made business out of ignorant or lax\r\ndiagnosis. I shall add here what remains to be said of specialist\r\nague-curers in later times. They are heard of in London in the Queen Anne\r\nperiod, and as late as 1745.\r\n\r\n    Swift writes in his Journal to Stella, 25 December, 1710, from Bury\r\n    Street, St James’s: “I tell you a good pun: a fellow hard by pretends\r\n    to cure agues, and has set out a sign, and spells it _egoes_; a\r\n    gentleman and I observing it, he said, ‘How does that fellow pretend\r\n    to cure agues?’ I said, I did not know, but I was sure it was not by a\r\n    _spell_. That is admirable.” In 1745, Simon Mason, of Cambridge,\r\n    published by subscription and dedicated to Dr Mead an essay, _The\r\n    Nature of an Intermitting Fever and Ague considered_ (Lond. 1745), in\r\n    which he has the following on “charm-doctors”:--“When one of these\r\n    poor wretches apply to a doctor of this stamp, he enquires how many\r\n    fits they have had; he then chalks so many strokes upon a heater as\r\n    they tell him they have had fits, and useth some other delusions to\r\n    strengthen the conceit of the patient” (p. 167). Francis Fisher, who\r\n    had been upper hostler in a livery stable in Crutched Friars near\r\n    forty years, “told me he seldom missed a week without several ague\r\n    patients applying to him, and he cured great numbers by a charm they\r\n    wore in their bosoms” (p. 239). Another, who kept a public-house near\r\n    St George’s Fields, Southwark, sold “febrifuge ale” at a shilling a\r\n    pint. It was a small ale brewed without hops, but with bark,\r\n    serpentery, rhubarb and cochineal mixed in the brewing. The receipt\r\n    was given him by an old doctor who was a prisoner in the King’s Bench.\r\n    His customers came in the morning fasting, and drank their shilling’s\r\n    worth after the publican had given them faith by a cordial grip of the\r\n    hand. “By this means,” he told Mason, “I got a good trade to my house,\r\n    and a comfortable maintenance too.”\r\n\r\nWe may now return to the actual history of the epidemic fevers upon which\r\nthe Peruvian bark was first tried on a large scale in England. The\r\n“intermittent” constitution which began in 1677 and lasted year after year\r\nuntil 1781 or even longer was a very remarkable one. It was called at the\r\ntime the new fever, or the new ague, and it had at least one short\r\ninterlude of influenza or epidemic catarrhal fever in the winter of 1679,\r\njust as the last epidemic of the kind, in 1657-59, had at least one, and\r\nprobably two, short and swift epidemic catarrhs in spring. But before we\r\ncome to that epidemic of 1678-81, there falls to be noticed an epidemic in\r\nthe month of November, 1675, which has always been counted among the\r\ninfluenzas proper. After giving the particulars of it from Sydenham and\r\nfrom the London bills of mortality, I shall show from Sydenham and the\r\nbills of mortality that there was an exactly similar epidemic in the month\r\nof November, 1679, which has not been admitted into the conventional list\r\nof influenzas. Thereafter I shall proceed to the epidemic constitution of\r\n1678-81 as a whole, which has been reckoned among the epidemic agues or\r\nmalarious epidemics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1675.\r\n\r\nThe first that we hear of the universal cold of 1675 is an entry which\r\nEvelyn makes in his diary under 15 October: “I got an extreme cold, such\r\nas was afterwards so epidemical as not only to afflict us in this island,\r\nbut was rife over all Europe, like a plague. It was after an exceeding dry\r\nsummer and autumn.” It was not until November that the epidemic cold made\r\nan impression upon the death-rate in London; the deaths mounted up from\r\n275 in the week ending 2 November, to 420 and 625 in the two weeks\r\nfollowing, and thereafter gradually declined to an ordinary level. Part of\r\nthe excess, but by no means the greater part of it, was set down under\r\nfevers, as the following section from the weekly bills of the year will\r\nshow:\r\n\r\n1675\r\n\r\n                                Griping in\r\n  Week Ending  Fever  Smallpox  the Guts    All causes\r\n\r\n      Nov. 2    42        9        29          275\r\n           9    60       12        42          420\r\n          16   130       13        43          625\r\n          23    99        2        28          413\r\n          30    61        6        29          349\r\n      Dec. 7    54        7        25          308\r\n          14    43        5        12          266\r\n\r\nThis shows the characteristic rise and fall of an epidemic catarrh both\r\nin the article of fever deaths and in the column of deaths from all\r\ncauses. The other excessive articles besides fever in the two worst weeks\r\nare also characteristic of influenza mortality:\r\n\r\n              Week ending   Week ending\r\n               9 Nov.        16 Nov.\r\n\r\n  Consumption    68            99\r\n  Aged           40            67\r\n  Tissick        10            35\r\n\r\nSydenham’s account bears out the figures[586]. At the end of October, he\r\nsays, the mild, warm weather turned to cold, while catarrhs and coughs\r\nbecame more frequent than at any time within his memory. They lasted until\r\nthe end of November, when they ceased suddenly. Afterwards he gives a\r\nspecial chapter to the “Epidemic Coughs of the year 1675, with Pleurisies\r\nand Pneumonias supervening.” The epidemic spared, he says, hardly anyone\r\nof whatever age or temperament; it went through whole families at once. A\r\nfever which he calls _febris comatosa_ had been raging far and wide since\r\nthe beginning of July, with which in the autumn dysenteric and diarrhoeal\r\ndisorders were mingled (it was an exceedingly dry season). This\r\nconstitution held the mastery all the autumn, affecting now the head, now\r\nthe bowels, until the end of October, when catarrhs and coughs became\r\nuniversal and continued for a month. Sydenham’s view of the sequence of\r\nevents was his usual one, namely, that one constitution, by change of\r\nseason, passed by transition into another. Whatever the constitution of\r\n“comatose” fevers may have been, which prevailed “far and near,” it has\r\nleft no trace upon the bills of mortality in London, which are remarkably\r\nlow until the beginning of November. But as soon as the epidemic of coughs\r\nbegins, the weekly deaths mount up in an unmistakeable manner, so that for\r\ntwo or three weeks in November, the mortality is nearly double that of the\r\nweeks preceding or following.\r\n\r\nThe “severe cold and violent cough,” of 1675, says Thoresby of Leeds[587],\r\nwho was then a boy, “too young or unobservant to make such remarks as\r\nmight be of use,” was known in the north of England “profanely” by the\r\nname of the “jolly rant.” Thoresby well remembered that it affected all\r\nmanner of persons, and that so universally that it was impossible, owing\r\nto the coughing, to hear distinctly an entire sentence of a sermon. He\r\ngives December as the month of it in Leeds, and says that it affected\r\nYork, Hull, and Halifax, as well as the counties of Westmoreland, Durham,\r\nand Northumberland. In Scotland also we find a trace of a strange epidemic\r\nsickness. It was the time of the persecution of the Covenanters, whose\r\npreachers moved hither and thither among the farm-houses. One of them,\r\nJohn Blackadder, was at the Cow-hill in the parish of Livingstown in\r\nAugust, 1675. He came in one evening from the fields very melancholy, and\r\nin reply to questions, he said he was afraid of a very dangerous\r\ninfectious mist to go through the land that night. He desired the family\r\nto close doors and windows, and keep them closed as long as they might,\r\nand to take notice where the mist stood thickest and longest, for there\r\nthey would see the effects saddest. “And it remained longest upon that\r\ntown called the Craigs, being within their sight, and only a few families;\r\nand within four months thereafter, thirty corpses went out of that\r\nplace[588].” The prophecy was fulfilled within four months, which would\r\nbring us to the date of the influenza, although the mortality for a small\r\nplace is somewhat excessive.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1679.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of comparison, I pass at once to an epidemic of coughs and\r\ncolds in the month of November, 1679, which Sydenham has chronicled, but\r\nno one except Cullen[589] has thought of including among the influenzas.\r\nIt produced the characteristic effect of influenza on the London weekly\r\nbills, and it came in the midst of epidemic agues, just as the epidemic\r\ncatarrhs of 1658 and 1659 had done. The following rise and fall are just\r\nas distinctive of an influenza as on the last occasion in 1675:\r\n\r\n1679\r\n\r\n                                      Griping of\r\n  Week ending    Fever    Smallpox    the Guts   All causes\r\n\r\n  Nov. 11          50        18           34        328\r\n       18          89        27           39        541\r\n       25         126        21           55        764\r\n  Dec.  2          82        27           38        457\r\n        9          63        12           38        388\r\n\r\nSydenham’s account[590] of this remarkable November outburst of sickness\r\nin London, written within a few weeks of its occurrence, is almost exactly\r\na repetition of his language concerning the epidemic coughs of November,\r\n1675. The prevailing intermittent fevers, he says, gave place to a new\r\nepidemic depending upon a manifest crasis of the air. The new epidemic was\r\none of coughs, which were so much more general than at the same season in\r\nother years that in nearly every family they affected nearly every person.\r\nIn some cases of the cough, the aid of a physician was hardly needed; but\r\nin others the chest was so shaken by the violent convulsive cough as to\r\nbring on vomiting, and the head was affected with vertigo. For the first\r\nfew days the cough was almost dry, and so purely paroxysmal as to remind\r\nSydenham of the whooping-cough of children. Everyone was surprised, he\r\nsays, at the frequency of these coughs in this season. His own suggestion\r\nwas that the rains of October[591] had filled the blood with crude and\r\nwatery particles, that the first access of cold had checked transpiration\r\nthrough the skin, and that Nature had contrived to eliminate this serous\r\ncolluvies either by the branches of the “vena arteriosa” or (as some will\r\nhave it) by the glands of the trachea, and to explode it by the aid of a\r\ncough. Phlebotomy and purging were the best cures; diaphoretics he\r\nconsidered less safe, and he ascribed to their abuse the fever into which\r\nsome fell, and the pleurisies which were apt to attack patients with great\r\nviolence during the subsidence of the epidemic catarrh.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Epidemic Agues of 1678-80.\r\n\r\nThe other English writer on the epidemic constitution of 1678-79 is Dr\r\nChristopher Morley[592]. Like Sydenham, he is occupied almost exclusively\r\nwith the epidemic agues; but he also records the extraordinary rise of the\r\nmortality in London for a few weeks in the last months of the year, and\r\nthe causes thereof, although it did not occur to him to count that as a\r\nseparate part of “the new disease,” still less as the principal part,\r\nwhich it really was in London so far as concerned the death-rate. Dating\r\nhis preface from London, the 31st of December, 1679, he says in the text:\r\n“Within the very days of my present writing, it happens that as many as\r\nfour hundred deaths more than usual have taken place in a fortnight,” the\r\nexcessive mortality having been due to “coryza, bronchitis, catarrh, cough\r\nand fever,” which were the effects of “most pernicious destillations.”\r\n\r\nI shall now go back to the beginning of the epidemic constitution in the\r\nmidst of which this November interlude occurred, and I shall follow it\r\nseason after season to the end, so as to set forth in historical\r\nprominence that which was regarded at the time as “the new disease.” When\r\nSydenham returned to London in the autumn of 1677, after six months’ rest\r\nfrom practice, he was told by his professional friends that intermittents\r\nwere being seen here and there (after a clear interval of thirteen years),\r\nbeing more frequent in the country than in the city. In the letter of\r\nOctober, 1677, cited above, he speaks of Talbor having made a fortune in\r\ntwo months by his cures of agues with bark.\r\n\r\n    The first particular notice of the “new fever” occurs in a London\r\n    letter of 23 February, 1677/78: “Lady Katherin Brudenhall has been in\r\n    great danger of death by the new feaver[593].” A severe aguish illness\r\n    of Roger North, fully described in his ‘Autobiography,’ was probably\r\n    another instance of the reigning malady; it came upon him in the hot\r\n    weather of 1678, while he was residing with his brother, Lord\r\n    Guilford, at Hammersmith[594]. In the autumn of 1678, the “new fever”\r\n    came more into notice. On the 8th of September, a letter was brought\r\n    to Evelyn in church, from Mr Godolphin (afterwards celebrated as the\r\n    minister of William III.), to say that his wife was exceedingly ill\r\n    and to ask Evelyn’s prayers and assistance. Evelyn and his wife took\r\n    boat at once to Whitehall, and found the young and much-beloved Mrs\r\n    Godolphin “attacqu’d with the new fever then reigning this excessive\r\n    hot autumn, and which was so violent that it was not thought she could\r\n    last many hours.” She died next day, in her twenty-ninth year; but, as\r\n    she had been brought to bed of a son six days before, her fever may\r\n    have been more from puerperal causes than from “the new fever then\r\n    reigning.” Other known cases of ague the next season were those of Sir\r\n    James Moore, his majesty’s engineer, who, in August, 1679, coming from\r\n    Portsmouth “was seized with an ague, and had two or three violent\r\n    fits, which carried him off[595];” and of the king, Charles II., who\r\n    was congratulated on his recovery by the lord mayor and aldermen, on\r\n    15 September, and had a recurrence of the aguish attack (“two or three\r\n    fits”) on 15 May, 1680[596]. There are also references to the agues of\r\n    1679 in the country, in the letters of Lady North[597].\r\n\r\nSydenham wrote his account of this epidemic of intermittents in compliance\r\nwith a request from Dr Brady, Master of Gonville and Caius College,\r\nCambridge, that he would continue the method of his ‘Observationes\r\nMedicae’ into the years following, and in particular give an account of\r\nhis method of administering bark. He occupied most of his space with\r\ntreatment; but he gives here and there the following epidemiological\r\ndetails. The agues were mostly tertians, or quotidians, or duplex forms of\r\nthese, whereas on a former occasion they had been mostly quartans; after\r\ntwo or three intermissions they were apt to become continual fevers. The\r\nagues, which had occurred in the spring of 1678, became more common in the\r\nsummer and autumn, when they raged so extensively that no other disease\r\ndeserved the name of epidemic so much. In winter smallpox took the lead;\r\nbut early in July, 1679, the agues began again, and so increased day by\r\nday that in August they were raging excessively and destroying many. It\r\nwas in August that the king had his “great cold” at Windsor, which\r\nafterwards changed to an ague. Sydenham then comes to the November\r\ninterlude of epidemic catarrhs, which was followed by “a fever without\r\ncough” (_non penitus deleta, sed manente adhuc in sanguine, malae crasis\r\nimpressione_), lasting to the beginning of 1680. As that year wore on, the\r\nintermittent fevers began again, and continued more or less until 1685,\r\nbecoming indeed less common in London, and less severe, than in the first\r\nfour years of the constitution, but in other places, now here, now there,\r\nnot less so than at first[598].\r\n\r\nI have kept to the last the special account of this epidemic written by\r\nMorley at the end of the second year of it, namely, in December, 1679. He\r\nhad been a witness of this fever, first at Leyden in the autumn of 1678,\r\nand next in England in the autumn of 1679, and he made it the subject of a\r\ntreatise at the request of an eminent physician in London. It was not so\r\nsevere by half in England as in Holland, but the English made a great deal\r\nmore of it, calling it the New Disease, the New Ague, the New Fever, the\r\nNew Ague Fever, and, in Derbyshire sarcastically, the New Delight. In\r\nHolland they called it neither new nor old, neither intermittent nor\r\ncontinued, nor a conjunction of both, but simply _morbus epidemicus_, or\r\n_febris epidemica_. His master at Leyden, Professor Lucas Schacht, taught\r\nvery decidedly that it was of a scorbutic nature, and as early as the\r\nmonth of June, 1678, had prophesied the arrival of such an epidemic fever\r\nbecause “tertians were becoming more and more scorbutic,” just as they had\r\ndone before the great epidemic of fever in Holland in 1669. Morley claims,\r\nhowever, that the fever of 1678 was in some respects different from that\r\nof 1669, as well as from that of the year immediately preceding, 1677,\r\nwhen “an incredible multitude of people all over Belgium, and in every\r\ncity and town, fell sick.” The Dutch, it appears, called these occasional\r\noutbreaks simply “the epidemic fever,” neither intermittent nor continued;\r\nand certainly that of 1669, which is sometimes counted among the epidemic\r\nagues, was a very remarkable “ague.” (See Chapter I. p. 19.)\r\n\r\nThe epidemic fever of 1678, wherever it may have been bred or engendered,\r\nwas prevalent in England at the same time as in Holland--in an exceedingly\r\nhot and dry autumn. The most constant symptoms, says Morley (and he writes\r\nboth for Holland[599] in 1678 and for the country districts of England in\r\nthe autumn of the following year), were nausea, severe vomiting,\r\nincredible tightness about the breast, weight in all the limbs, weariness,\r\ngiddiness, vigils, thirst, restless tossing, and languor remaining after\r\nthe disease was gone. Among the more remarkable symptoms were the\r\nfollowing: Many had aphthae of the mouth, some twice or thrice, some being\r\nendangered by the severity and closeness of the patches of thrush. In some\r\nthere occurred bleeding from the nose, or from piles, stranguary, etc.\r\nRound worms were observed, issuing both by the mouth and anus. In some few\r\nthere were spots on the skin, but hardly ever petechiae or tumours near\r\nthe ears. It affected all classes equally, all ages and both sexes. Some\r\nsaid it was easier to children than to adults, but others denied this.\r\nSome said it was more pernicious in the country than in the towns. In\r\nLeyden, the deaths never exceeded 150 in the week, being about twenty in a\r\nweek above the ordinary level. More died from the coughs, anginas,\r\nperipneumonies and pleurisies that followed, than from the disease itself.\r\nSchacht says that the wind for nearly two years had been steadily from the\r\nNorth, or veering to the East or West. The Leyden faculty, and the Dutch\r\ngenerally, did not think the disease a malignant one; it was very freely\r\ncalled so, however, in England, the chorus being led by empirics and\r\nilliterate persons: “Ac indicio est,” says Morley, “libellus perexiguus\r\nnostra lingua ab Empirico conscriptus de hoc morbo.” This seems to refer\r\nto the tract by one Simpson, which I shall notice briefly[600].\r\n\r\n    Simpson styles himself a Doctor of Physic, and denies that he is an\r\n    empiric. One sign of his affinity to that order, however, is that he\r\n    objects to the orthodox treatment--emetics, drenches, a too cooling\r\n    regimen, and purges, while he thinks blood-letting of doubtful\r\n    utility. The symptoms were chills at the outset, pains in the head and\r\n    back (in some with shaking), then intense burning heat, thirst,\r\n    profuse immoderate sweats and great debility, a general lassitude,\r\n    dulness, and stupor which in many were followed by delirium and a\r\n    comatose state. Sometimes the fever simulated a quotidian, sometimes a\r\n    tertian. He calls it “this new fever so grassant in city and country”\r\n    and says that in many it assumed “the guise of a morbus cholera, known\r\n    by the much vomitings or often retchings to vomit; and in others under\r\n    the livery of the gripes with looseness, or, in some, looseness\r\n    without gripes.” This choleraic tendency concurring with other usual\r\n    causes from the late season of fruit-eating etc., had swelled the\r\n    bills of mortality. The morbus cholera and the gripes were to the new\r\n    fever “like the circumjoviales that move in the same sphere with (but\r\n    at some distance from) their master-planet.”\r\n\r\nThe meaning of all this is obvious on turning to the London weekly, bills\r\nof mortality. In the months of August and September for three years in\r\nsuccession, 1678-80, the deaths from “griping in the guts” and from\r\n“convulsions” rose greatly. These were, indeed, three successive seasons\r\nof fatal diarrhoea, mostly infantile, as I shall show in the chapter on\r\nthat disease.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from the London weekly bills of mortality show how\r\n“fevers,” as well as other diseases, contributed to the great rise in the\r\nautumns of 1678, 1679, and 1680.\r\n\r\n_Autumnal London Mortality in 1678._\r\n\r\n1678\r\n\r\n                                    Griping\r\n  Week ending    Fever   Smallpox   in Guts   All causes\r\n\r\n      Aug. 20     77       31         87        459\r\n           27     79       37        130        510\r\n      Sept. 3     82       37        121        530\r\n           10    103       27        164        621\r\n           17     82       23        178        580\r\n           24     83       20        152        528\r\n       Oct. 1     82       25        117        485\r\n            8     77       27        106        456\r\n\r\n_Summer and Autumnal London Mortality in 1679._\r\n\r\n1679\r\n\r\n                                    Griping\r\n  Week ending    Fever   Smallpox   in Guts   All causes\r\n\r\n      July 22     42       55        101        442\r\n           29     60       50        134        565\r\n      Aug.  5     78       63        143        531\r\n           12     62       43        161        579\r\n           19     55       64        149        545\r\n           26     68       53        112        514\r\n      Sept. 2     96       40         97        466\r\n            9     92       47         75        471\r\n           16     85       50         87        462\r\n\r\n(For the Influenza weeks, see former Table.)\r\n\r\n_Autumnal London Mortality in 1680._\r\n\r\n1680\r\n\r\n                                    Griping\r\n  Week ending    Fever   Smallpox   in Guts   All causes\r\n\r\n      Aug. 10     70       17        108        427\r\n           17     90        6        132        494\r\n           24     98       17        127        552\r\n           31    140       18        228        816\r\n      Sept. 7    101       14        215        671\r\n           14     94       13        173        635\r\n           21    106        9        175        628\r\n           28    130        9        159        615\r\n       Oct. 5    125       16        138        597\r\n           12    121       10         94        530\r\n           19    109       14         68        488\r\n           26     93        5         58        407\r\n       Nov. 2     77       10         53        396\r\n\r\nThe last of the three autumnal seasons, 1680, is one of the few in the\r\nbills with high deaths from fever along with high deaths from choleraic\r\ndisease; and that excess of fever mortality may have been due in part to\r\nthe ague epidemic, then in its third season.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from Short’s summation of parish registers show the\r\ngreat excess of burials over baptisms in various parts of England during\r\nthe years of the aguish epidemic constitution.\r\n\r\n_Country Parishes._\r\n\r\n           Registers   Sickly    Baptisms   Burials\r\n  Year     examined   parishes   in do.     in do.\r\n\r\n  1678        136       17         312        527\r\n  1679        137       44         800       1203\r\n  1680        137       54        1093       1649\r\n  1681        137       41         679       1156\r\n  1682        140       30         632        975\r\n\r\n_Market Towns._\r\n\r\n           Registers   Sickly    Baptisms   Burials\r\n  Year     examined   parishes   in do.     in do.\r\n\r\n  1678         22        5         578        789\r\n  1679         23        7         877       1371\r\n  1680         24        7         946       1494\r\n  1681         24        9         945       1333\r\n  1682         25        9         795       1092\r\n  1683         25        8        1109       1398\r\n  1684         25        8         865       1243\r\n  1685         25        4         741       1191\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1688.\r\n\r\nThe seasons continued, according to Sydenham, to produce epidemic agues\r\nuntil 1685, when the constitution radically changed to one of pestilential\r\nfevers, affecting many in all ranks of society and reaching a height in\r\n1686. Sydenham records nothing beyond that date, having shortly after\r\nfallen into ill health and ceased to write or even to practise. One would\r\nwish to have known what he made of the “new distemper” in the summer of\r\n1688, for it was a sudden universal fever, and yet not a catarrh or a\r\n“great cold.” It is thus referred to in a letter of the month of June,\r\nfrom Belvoir, Rutlandshire[601]: “The man that dos the picturs in inemaled\r\nis gon up to London for a weke.... I wish the man dos not get this new\r\ndistemper and die before he comes agane.” On turning to the London weekly\r\nbills of mortality we find in the first weeks of June the characteristic\r\nrise of one of those sudden epidemic fevers or new diseases, of which the\r\nearliest with recorded figures was the “gentle correction” of July, 1580.\r\nThe following are the weekly London figures corresponding to the “new\r\ndistemper” of 1688:\r\n\r\n_Weekly London Mortalities._\r\n\r\n1688\r\n\r\n  Week ending   Fevers   All causes\r\n\r\n  May 29          58        368\r\n  June 5          76        518\r\n      12         101        559\r\n      19          65        435\r\n      26          66        437\r\n\r\nThe contemporary London notice of this “influenza” comes from Dr Walter\r\nHarris, who mentioned it in a book written the year after[602]:\r\n\r\n    “From the middle of the month of May in the year 1688, for some weeks,\r\n    a slight sort of fever became epidemical. It affected the joints of\r\n    the patients with slight pains, and they complained of a pain in their\r\n    heads, especially in the fore-part, and of a sort of giddiness. It was\r\n    more rife than any that I ever observed before, from any cause\r\n    whatsoever, or in any time of the year. A great many whole families\r\n    were taken at once with this fever, so that hardly one out of a great\r\n    number escaped this general storm. Now this so epidemical or febrile\r\n    insult seemed plainly to me to depend upon the variety of the season\r\n    of the year, the most intense heat of some days being suddenly changed\r\n    to cold.... Never were so many people sick together: never did so few\r\n    of them die. They recovered under almost any regimen,--almost everyone\r\n    of them.”\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, however, that the bills rose very considerably for four\r\nweeks, and that, too, in the healthiest season of the year.\r\n\r\nA somewhat fuller account of its symptoms is given by Molyneux for\r\nDublin[603]. He had been informed by a learned physician from London that\r\nit had been as general there as in Dublin, which we know to have been the\r\ncase from Harris’s account. Both Molyneux and Harris call it a slight\r\nfever, without mentioning catarrhal symptoms. The spring months\r\nimmediately preceding had been remarkable for drought.\r\n\r\n    At Dublin this “short sort of fever” was first observed about the\r\n    beginning of July, or some six weeks later than in London. “It so\r\n    universally seized all sorts of men whatever, that I then made an\r\n    estimate not above one in fifteen escaped. It began, as generally\r\n    fevers do, with a chilness and shivering all over, like that of an\r\n    ague, but not so violent, which soon broke out into a dry burning\r\n    heat, with great uneasiness that commonly confined them to their beds,\r\n    where they passed the ensuing night very restless; they commonly\r\n    complained likewise of giddiness, and a dull pain in their heads,\r\n    chiefly about the eyes, with unsettled pains in their limbs, and about\r\n    the small of their back, a soreness all over their flesh, a loss of\r\n    appetite, with a nausea or aptness to vomit, an unusual ill taste in\r\n    their mouths, yet little or no thirst. And though these symptoms were\r\n    very violent for a time, yet they did not continue long: for after the\r\n    second day of the distemper the patient, usually of himself, fell into\r\n    a sweat (unless ’twas prevented by letting blood, which, however\r\n    beneficial in other fevers, I found manifestly retarded the progress\r\n    of this): and if the sweat was encouraged for five or six hours by\r\n    laying on more cloaths, or taking some sudorifick medicine, most of\r\n    the disorders before mentioned would entirely disappear or at least\r\n    very much abate. The giddiness of their head and want of appetite\r\n    would often continue some days afterwards, but with the use of the\r\n    open fresh air they certainly in four or five days at farthest\r\n    recovered these likewise and were perfectly well. So transient and\r\n    favourable was this disease that it seldom required the help of a\r\n    physician; and of a thousand that were seized with it, I believe\r\n    scarce one dyed. By the middle of August following, it wholly\r\n    disappeared, so that it had run its full course through all sorts of\r\n    people in seven weeks time.... This fever spread itself all over\r\n    England; whether it extended farther I did not learn.”\r\n\r\nThis short fever of men was preceded by a slight but universal\r\nhorse-cold[604].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1693.\r\n\r\nMolyneux considered the strange transient fever of the summer of 1688 to\r\nhave been the most universal fever that perhaps had ever appeared, and he\r\nthought the universal catarrh of five years’ later date (1693) to have\r\nbeen “the most universal cold.” We have thus a means of contrasting in the\r\ndescriptions of the same author a universal slight fever and a universal\r\ncatarrh, which happened within five years of each other, and were neither\r\nof them called at the time by the name of influenza,--a name not known in\r\nBritain until half a century later. Before coming to Molyneux’s\r\ndescription, it should be said that the London bills of mortality bear no\r\ndecided trace of an influenza in the end of the year 1693, the following\r\nbeing the highest weekly mortalities nearest to the date given for the\r\nepidemic at Dublin[605]:\r\n\r\n_London Weekly Mortalities._\r\n\r\n1693\r\n\r\n  Week ending   Fever    All causes\r\n\r\n  October 10      43        353\r\n          17      62        353\r\n          24      53        384\r\n          31      69        457\r\n  November 7      68        455\r\n          14      48        365\r\n\r\nMolyneux’s account of the flying epidemic of 1693 is as follows[606]:\r\n\r\n    “The coughs and colds that lately so universally prevailed gave us a\r\n    most extraordinary instance how liable at certain times our bodies\r\n    are, however differing in constitution, age and way of living, to be\r\n    affected much in the same manner by a spreading evil.... ’Twas about\r\n    the beginning of November last, 1693, after a constant course of\r\n    moderately warm weather for the season, upon some snow falling in the\r\n    mountains and country about the town [Dublin], that of a sudden it\r\n    grew extremely cold, and soon after succeeded some few days of very\r\n    hard frost, whereupon rheums of all kinds, such as violent coughs that\r\n    chiefly affected in the night, great defluxion of thin rheum at the\r\n    nose and eyes, immoderate discharge of the saliva by spitting,\r\n    hoarseness in the voice, sore throats, with some trouble in\r\n    swallowing, whesings, stuffings and soreness in the breast, a dull\r\n    heaviness and stoppage in the head, with such like disorders, the\r\n    usual effects of cold, seized great numbers of all sorts of people in\r\n    Dublin.\r\n\r\n    “Some were more violently affected, so as to be confined awhile to\r\n    their beds; those complained of feverish symptoms, as shiverings and\r\n    chilness all over them, that made several returns, pains in many parts\r\n    of their body, severe head-aches, chiefly about their foreheads, so as\r\n    any noise was very troublesome: great weakness in their eyes, that the\r\n    least light was offensive; a perfect decay of all appetite; foul\r\n    turbid urine, with a brick-coloured sediment at the bottom; great\r\n    uneasiness and tossing in their beds at night. Yet these disorders,\r\n    though they very much frightened both the sick and their friends,\r\n    usually without help of remedy would abate of themselves, and\r\n    terminate in universal sweats, that constantly relieved.... When the\r\n    cold was moderate, it usually was over in eight or ten days; but with\r\n    those in whom it rose to a greater height, it continued a fortnight,\r\n    three weeks, and sometimes a month. One way or other it universally\r\n    affected all kinds of men; those in the country as well as city; those\r\n    that were much abroad in the open air, and those that stay’d much\r\n    within doors, or even kept close in their chambers; those that were\r\n    robust and hardy, as well as those that were weak and tender--men,\r\n    women and children of all ranks and conditions.... Not one in thirty,\r\n    I may safely say, escaped it. In the space of four or five weeks it\r\n    had its rise, growth, and decay; and though from first to last it\r\n    seized such incredible numbers of all sorts of men, I cannot learn\r\n    that any one truly dyed of it, unless such whose strength was before\r\n    spent by some tedious fit of sickness, or laboured under some heavier\r\n    disease complicated with it.... It spread itself all over England in\r\n    the same manner it did here, particularly it seized them at London and\r\n    Oxford as universally and with the same symptoms as it seized us in\r\n    Dublin; but with this observable difference that it appeared three or\r\n    four weeks sooner in London, that is, about the beginning of\r\n    October.... Nor was its progress, as I am credibly informed, bounded\r\n    by these Islands for it spread still further and reached the\r\n    Continent, where it infested the northern parts of France (as about\r\n    Paris) Flanders, Holland, and the rest of the United Provinces with\r\n    more violence and no less frequency than it did in these countries.”\r\n\r\nYet no other writer, English or foreign, appears to have mentioned it. Its\r\nexistence rests on the authority of Molyneux alone, according to the above\r\nvery circumstantial narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1712.\r\n\r\nThere were so many fevers from 1693 to the end of the century that it is\r\nnot easy to distinguish epidemic agues or catarrhs among them. If we\r\nfollow the continental writers, it is not until 1709 and 1712 that there\r\nis any concurrence of testimony for such widespread maladies. Evelyn,\r\nhowever, says that in the remarkably dry and fine months of February and\r\nMarch, 1705, “agues and smallpox prevail much in every place” (21st\r\nFebruary). The very general coughs and catarrhs of 1709 seem to have been\r\nreally caused by the severity of the memorable hard winter, the frost\r\nhaving begun in October, 1708 and lasted until March, 1709. The evidences\r\nof a truly epidemic infectious catarrh or influenza all over Europe in\r\n1709 are scanty and ambiguous. It is probably to this “universal cold”\r\nthat Molyneux refers under the year 1708[607]; but English writers have\r\nnot otherwise mentioned an epidemic in 1709.\r\n\r\nThe next, in 1712, was a “new ague” of the kind without catarrhal\r\nsymptoms, like that of 1688. One German writer called it the\r\n“Galanterie-Krankheit,” another the “Mode-Krankheit,” and it was about the\r\nsame time that the French name “la grippe” came into use. These names all\r\nmean “the disease _a la mode_” or the reigning fashion[608]; they remind\r\none of the earlier “trousse galante” and “coqueluche” (a kind of bonnet),\r\nand of the “grande gorre” of 1494. It appears to have made little or no\r\nimpression on the mortality, and would hardly have been noticed but for\r\nits wide prevalence. In England it was the subject of a brief essay by Dr\r\nJohn Turner under the title of “Febris Britannica Anni 1712[609]”--a\r\ncertain epidemic fever, of the milder kind, fatal to none, but prevalent\r\nfar and wide and leaving very few families untouched. It was marked by\r\naching and heaviness of the head, burning or lancinating pains in the\r\nback, pains in the joints like those of rheumatism, loss of appetite,\r\nvomiting, pains of the stomach and intestines. The venom though not sharp,\r\nacted quickly. Turner ascribed it to malign vapours from the interior of\r\nthe earth (_malignos terrae matris halitus_). Its season in England, as in\r\nGermany, was probably the summer or autumn. Turner begins his discourse\r\nwith a reference to the plague in the East of Europe, which, he says, had\r\nbeen kept out of England by quarantine, to the murrain which was then\r\nraging in Italy (and appeared in England in 1714), and to fevers of a bad\r\ntype which had traversed all France during the past spring, invading noble\r\nhouses and even the royal palace. Having begun his discourse thus, he ends\r\nit by remarking that the slight British fever did not, in his opinion,\r\nforebode a plague to follow. It may have been a recurrence of this\r\nepidemic next year that Mead speaks of under the name of the “Dunkirk\r\nrant” (supposed to have been brought over from Dunkirk by returning troops\r\nafter the Peace of Utrecht) in September, 1713; it was, he says, a mild\r\nfever, which began with pains in the head and went off easily in large\r\nsweats after a day’s confinement[610]. The weekly bills of mortality in\r\nLondon are no help to us to fix the date of the one or more slight fevers\r\nor influenzas about 1712-13. The great fever-years of the period were 1710\r\nand 1714; but the fever was typhus, probably mixed with relapsing fever,\r\naccording to the evidence in another chapter. Even compared with the\r\nuniversal fever or influenza of 1688, that of 1712 must have been\r\nunimportant; for the former sent up the London mortality considerably,\r\nwhereas there is no characteristic rise to be found in any month of 1712\r\nor 1713.\r\n\r\nEither to this period, or to the undoubted aguish years 1727-28, belongs a\r\ncurious statement as to “burning agues, fevers never before heard of to be\r\nuniversal and mortal,” in Scotland, the same having been a “sad stroke and\r\ngreat distress upon many families and persons.” The authority is Patrick\r\nWalker, who traces these hitherto unheard of troubles to the Union of the\r\nCrowns (1707)[611].\r\n\r\nOn other and perhaps better authority, it does appear that Scotland before\r\nthat period was reputed to be remarkably free from agues; and it is\r\nprobable that the universal and mortal burning agues some time between\r\n1707 and 1728, had come in one of those strange epidemic visitations, just\r\nas the agues of 1780-84 did. It would be erroneous to conclude from such\r\nreferences to ague that Scotland had ever been a malarious country. Robert\r\nBoyle refers in two places to the rarity of agues in Scotland in the time\r\nof Charles II.; the Duke of York, he says[612], on his return out of\r\nScotland, 1680, mentioned that agues were very unfrequent in that country,\r\n“which yet that year were very rife over almost all England”--to wit, the\r\nepidemic of 1678-80. Again, agues, especially quartans, are rare in many\r\nparts of Scotland, “insomuch that a learned physician answered me that in\r\ndivers years practice he met not with above three or four[613].” However,\r\nSir Robert Sibbald, while he admits the rarity of quartans, does allege\r\nthat quotidians, tertians and the anomalous forms occurred, that agues\r\nmight be epidemic in the spring, with different symptoms from year to\r\nyear, and that certain malignant fevers, not called agues, were wont to\r\nrage in the autumn[614].\r\n\r\n\r\nEpidemic Agues and Influenzas, 1727-29.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary annalist of epidemics in England is Wintringham, of York,\r\nwho enters remittents and intermittents almost every year from 1717 to the\r\nend of his first series of annals in 1726; but none of his entries points\r\nvery clearly to an epidemic of ague[615]. It is not until the very\r\nunwholesome years 1727-29 that we hear of intermittent fevers being\r\nprevalent everywhere, with one or more true influenzas or epidemic\r\ncatarrhs interpolated among them. To show how unhealthy England was in\r\ngeneral, I give a table compiled from Short’s abstracts of the parish\r\nregisters, showing the proportion of parishes, urban and rural, with\r\nexcess of burials over christenings:\r\n\r\n_Country Parishes._\r\n\r\n                      Registers\r\n         Registers   showing high   Births     Deaths\r\n  Year   examined     death-rate    in ditto   in ditto\r\n\r\n  1727     180           55           1091      1368\r\n  1728     180           80           1536      2429\r\n  1729     178           62           1442      2015\r\n  1730     176           39           1022      1302\r\n\r\n_Market Towns._\r\n\r\n                      Registers\r\n         Registers   showing high   Births     Deaths\r\n  Year   examined     death-rate    in ditto   in ditto\r\n\r\n  1727      33           19           2441      3606\r\n  1728      34           23           2355      4972\r\n  1729      36           27           3494      6673\r\n  1730      36           16           2529      3445\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the accounts by Huxham, Wintringham, Hillary, and Warren,\r\nof Bury St Edmunds[616], that much of the excessive sickness in 1727-29\r\nwas aguish, although much of it, and probably the most fatal part of it,\r\nwas the low putrid fever so often mentioned after the first quarter of the\r\n18th century. At Norwich, where the burials for three years, 1727-29, were\r\nnearly double the registered baptisms, many were carried off, says\r\nBlomefield, “by fevers and agues, and the contagion was general.” In\r\nIreland also, a country rarely touched by true agues, Rutty enters\r\nintermittent fever as very frequent in May, 1728; and again, in the spring\r\nof 1729: “Intermittent fevers were epidemic in April; and some of the\r\npetechial kind. Nor was this altogether peculiar to us; for at that same\r\ntime we were informed that intermittent and other fevers were frequent in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Gloucester and London; and very mortal in the country\r\nplaces, but less in the cities.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this epidemic constitution of agues and other fevers there\r\noccurred one or more horse-colds, and one or more epidemic catarrhs of\r\nmankind. The most definitely marked or best recorded of these was the\r\ninfluenza of 1729.\r\n\r\nThe universal cold or catarrh of 1729 fell upon London in October and\r\nNovember, and upon York, Plymouth and Dublin about the same time. It\r\nprevailed in various parts of Europe until March, 1730, its incidence upon\r\nItaly being entirely after the New Year. The rise in the London deaths was\r\ncharacteristic: the level was high when the epidemic began, but the\r\nepidemic nearly doubled the already high mortality during the worst week\r\nand trebled the deaths from “fever.”\r\n\r\n_London Weekly Mortalities._\r\n\r\n1729\r\n\r\n  Week ending    Fever   All causes\r\n\r\n  October   21     88       564\r\n            28    118       603\r\n  November   4    213       908\r\n            11    267       993\r\n            18    166       783\r\n            25    124       635\r\n\r\nThe high mortalities of the weeks following may be taken as due to the\r\nsequelae of the epidemic (pneumonias, pleurisies, malignant fevers) and\r\nare indeed so explained in one contemporary account:\r\n\r\n  Week ending  Fever   All causes\r\n\r\n  December 2     92       678\r\n           9    132       779\r\n          16    116       707\r\n          23    123       710\r\n          30    109       628\r\n\r\nThe influenza of October and November, 1729, was the occasion of a London\r\nessay[617], which appears to treat solely of the epidemic catarrh and its\r\nafter-effects, and not of the two years’ previous sicknesses, which are\r\nthe subject of another essay, by Strother, written before the influenza\r\nbegan. London, says this author, as well as Bath, and foreign parts, have\r\nbeen on a sudden seized universally with the disorders named in his title\r\n(fevers, coughs, asthmas, rheumatisms, defluxions etc.). These had come in\r\nthe course of an unusually warm and wet, or relaxing, winter; “we have for\r\nsome time past dwelt in fogs, our air has been hazy, our streets loaden\r\nwith rain, and our bodies surrounded with water.” So many different\r\nsymptoms attend the “New Disease” that a volume, he says, would not\r\nsuffice to describe them, but he thus summarizes them:\r\n\r\n    Sudden pain in the head, heaviness or drowsiness, and anon their noses\r\n    began to run; they coughed or wheezed, and grew hoarse; they felt an\r\n    oppression and load on their breasts, and turned vapourish, either\r\n    because they apprehended ill consequences, or because their spirits\r\n    were oppressed with a load of humours. The victims of the epidemic, he\r\n    says again, were very subject to vapours; they are, upon the least\r\n    fatigue or emotion of mind, dispirited, and flag upon every emergency.\r\n    Among other symptoms were, quick pulse, thirst, loss of appetite and\r\n    vertigo: the mouth and jaws hot, rough and dry, the thrush raising\r\n    blisters thereon; the throat hoarse; a fierce brutal cough, which\r\n    weakens by bringing on profuse sweats; the urine, muddy and white, “if\r\n    they who are seized have been old asthmaticks.”\r\n\r\nHe speaks of cases that had proved suddenly fatal and says that all who\r\ndied of “epidemical catarrhs” had been found to have polypuses in their\r\nhearts. If reference be made to the Table, it will be seen that the high\r\nmortality continued in London for at least a month after the epidemic had\r\npassed through its ordinary course of rise, maximum and decline; and it is\r\nprobably to that post-epidemic mortality that the author refers in the\r\nfollowing passages:\r\n\r\n    “Numbers, as appears by our late bills, are taken with malignant\r\n    fevers, or malignant pleurisies or with pleuritic fevers....\r\n    Whosoever, then, would prevent a defluxion from turning into a fever,\r\n    or from anything yet worse, if worse can be, must keep warm and\r\n    observe a diluting regimen so long as till their water subsides and\r\n    the symptoms are vanquished.... I am convinced by experience that many\r\n    poor creatures have perished under these late epidemical fevers, from\r\n    the fatal mistake of never retiring from their usual employments till\r\n    they have rivetted a fever upon them, and till they have neglected\r\n    twelve or fourteen days of their precious time.” This was fully\r\n    endorsed by Huxham for the influenza of 1733: “Morbus raro lethalis,\r\n    quem tamen, multi, vel ob ipsam frequentiam, temeri spernentes, seras\r\n    dedêre poenas stultitiae, asthmatici, hectici, tabidi.”\r\n\r\nHillary’s account for Ripon is very brief[618]:\r\n\r\n    “The season continuing very wet, and the wind generally in the\r\n    southern points, about the middle of November [1729] an epidemical\r\n    cough seized almost everybody, few escaping it, for it was\r\n    universally felt over the kingdom; they had it in London and Newcastle\r\n    two or three weeks before we had it about Ripon.”\r\n\r\nWintringham, of York, says the epidemic in the early winter of 1729 was “a\r\nfebricula with slight rigors, lassitude, almost incessant cough, pain in\r\nthe head, hoarseness, difficulty in breathing, and attended with some\r\ndeaths among feeble persons, from pleuritic and pulmonary\r\naffections[619].” There was a tradition at Exeter as late as 1775 that two\r\nthousand were seized in one night in the epidemic of 1729. Huxham, of\r\nPlymouth, says of the epidemic in November:\r\n\r\n    “A cartarrhal febricula, with incessant cough, slight dyspepsia,\r\n    anorexia, languor, and rheumatic pains, is raging everywhere. When it\r\n    is more vehement than usual, it passes into bastard pleurisy or\r\n    peripneumony; but for the most part it is easily got rid of by letting\r\n    blood and by emetics.” In December, the coughs and catarrhal fever\r\n    continued, while mania was more frequent than usual, and in January,\r\n    1730, the cartarrhal fever still infested some persons.\r\n\r\nRutty, of Dublin, merely says: “In November raged an universal epidemic\r\ncatarrh, scarce sparing any one family. It visited London before us[620].”\r\n\r\nThese references to the unusual catarrhal febricula in November, 1729, are\r\nall that occur in the epidemiographic records kept by some four British\r\nwriters who recorded the weather and prevalent diseases of those years.\r\nThe epidemic catarrh made a slight impression upon them beside some other\r\nepidemics, and hardly a greater impression than another of the same kind,\r\nwhich seems to have occurred in the beginning of 1728. Thus, Rutty says,\r\nunder November, 1727: “In Staffordshire and Shropshire their horses were\r\nsuddenly seized with a cough and weakness. In December, it was in Dublin\r\nand remote parts of Ireland; some bled at the nose.” On December 25th, he\r\nenters: “The horses growing better, a cough and sore throat seized mankind\r\nin Dublin[621].” Huxham, for Devonshire, under Oct.-Nov. 1727 confirms\r\nthis: “a vehement cough in horses, which lasted to the end of December;\r\nthe greater number at length recovered from it.” He does not say in that\r\ncontext that an epidemic cough followed among men, as Rutty does say for\r\nDublin; but in a subsequent note upon horse-colds, he says: “In 1728 and\r\n1733 it [the precedence of the horse-cold] was most manifest; in which\r\nyears a most severe cough seized almost all the horses, one or two months\r\nearlier than men.” From which it would appear that the influenza of\r\nNov.-Dec. 1729, was not the only one during the aguish years 1727-29.\r\n\r\nIn the weekly London bills the other series of mortalities that look most\r\nlike those of an influenza are in the month of February, 1728 (748, 889,\r\n850 and 927 in four successive weeks, being more than double the average).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1733.\r\n\r\nThe next influenza was three years after that of 1729--in January, 1733.\r\nIn London, it raised the weekly deaths for a couple of weeks to a far\r\ngreater height than the preceding had done. Also the purely catarrhal\r\nsymptoms of running from the eyes and nose are more prominent in the\r\naccounts for 1733 than for the influenza of 1729. The first notice of it\r\ncomes from Edinburgh. The horses having been “attacked with running of the\r\nnose and coughs towards the end of October and beginning of November,” the\r\nsame symptoms began suddenly among men on the 17th December, 1732[622]. By\r\nthe 25th the epidemic was general in Edinburgh, very few escaping, and it\r\ncontinued in that city until the middle of January, 1733. In a great many\r\nit began with a running of lymph at the eyes and nose, which continued for\r\na day. Generally the patients were inclined to sweat, and some had profuse\r\nsweats. It was noted as remarkable that the prisoners in the gaol escaped;\r\nalso the boys in Heriot’s Hospital, as well as the inhabitants of houses\r\nnear to that charity. The Edinburgh deaths rose as in the following table;\r\nthe bulk of these extra burials are said to have been at the public\r\ncharges, the epidemic having swept away a great number of poor, old, and\r\nconsumptive people:\r\n\r\n  Buried in November, 1732   89\r\n    \"    \"  December, 1732  109\r\n    \"    \"  January,  1733  214\r\n    \"    \"  February, 1733  135\r\n\r\nHillary[623] fixes the date of its beginning at Leeds on 3 February, one\r\nweek later than at York, three weeks later than at Newcastle, or than in\r\nLondon and the south of England generally. At Leeds in three days’ time\r\nabout one-third part of the people were seized with chills, catarrh,\r\nviolent cough, sneezing and coryza; the epidemic lasted five or six weeks\r\nin the town and country near. Dr John Arbuthnot, who was then living in\r\nDover Street, is clear that the outbreak in London was later than in\r\nEdinburgh, which indeed appears also from the paragraph in the\r\n_Gentleman’s Magazine_, dated Wednesday the 11th January, and from a\r\ncomparison of the dates of highest mortalities in London (p. 349) and\r\nEdinburgh. It was in Saxony from the 15th November to the 29th of that\r\nmonth, and in Holland before it broke out in England. But it had begun in\r\nNew England in the middle of October, and had broken out soon after in\r\nBarbados, Jamaica, Mexico and Peru. Its outbreak in Paris was at the\r\nbeginning of February, 1733, and at Naples in March. The symptoms, says\r\nArbuthnot, were uniform in every place--small rigors, pains in the back, a\r\nthin defluxion occasioning sneezing, a cough with expectoration. In France\r\nthe fever ended after several days in miliary eruptions, in Holland often\r\nin imposthumations of the throat. In some, the cough outlasted the fever\r\nsix weeks or two months. The horses were seized with the catarrh before\r\nmankind[624].\r\n\r\n    The account of the influenza of 1733 in London in the _Gentleman’s\r\n    Magazine_ is under the date of 11 January: “About this time coughs and\r\n    colds began to grow so rife that scarce a family escaped them, which\r\n    carried off a good many, both old and young. The distemper discovered\r\n    itself by a shivering in the limbs, a pain in the head, and a\r\n    difficulty of breathing. The remedies prescribed were various, but\r\n    especially bleeding, drinking cold water, small broths, and such thin\r\n    liquids as dilute the blood[625].”\r\n\r\nHuxham says that it was in Cornwall and the west of Devon in February,\r\n1733, and that at Plymouth, on the 10th of that month, some were suddenly\r\nseized: “the day after they fell down in multitudes, and on the 18th or\r\n20th of March, scarce anyone had escaped it.”\r\n\r\n    It began with slight shivering, followed by transient erratic heats,\r\n    headache, violent sneezing, flying pains in the back and chest,\r\n    violent cough, a running of thin sharp mucus from the nose and mouth.\r\n    A slight fever followed, with the pulse quick, but not hard or tense.\r\n    The urine was thick and whitish, the sediment yellowish-white, seldom\r\n    red. Several had racking pain in the head, many had singing in the\r\n    ears and pain in the meatus auditorius, where sometimes an abscess\r\n    formed: exulcerations and swelling of the fauces were likewise very\r\n    common. The sick were in general much given to sweating, which, when\r\n    it broke out of its own accord and was very plentiful, continuing\r\n    without striking in again, did often in the space of two or three days\r\n    carry off the fever. The disorder in other cases terminated with a\r\n    discharge of bilious matter by stool, and sometimes by the breaking\r\n    forth of fiery pimples. It was rarely fatal, and then mostly to\r\n    infants and old worn out people. Generally it went off about the\r\n    fourth day, leaving a troublesome cough often of long duration, “and\r\n    such dejection of strength as one would hardly have suspected from the\r\n    shortness of the time.” The cough in all was very vehement, hardly to\r\n    be subdued by anodynes: and it was so protracted in some as to throw\r\n    them into consumption, which carried them off within a month or\r\n    two[626].\r\n\r\nHuxham is unusually full on the coughs and anginas of horses for several\r\nmonths before the influenza of men. In August, 1732, coughs were troubling\r\nsome horses; in September, a coughing angina (called “the strangles”)\r\neverywhere among horses which almost suffocates most of them; in October\r\nthe disease of horses is raging at its worst; and in December it is still\r\namong them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1737.\r\n\r\nAfter several years, unhealthy in other ways, the influenza came again in\r\nthe autumn of 1737. In Devonshire, according to Huxham, the horses began\r\nto suffer from cough and angina, and some of them to die, as early as\r\nJanuary, 1737, the epizootic being mentioned again in February, but not\r\nsubsequently. The same observer says the influenza began at Plymouth in\r\nNovember and lasted to the end of December, 1737, seizing almost everyone,\r\nand proving much more severe than the epidemic catarrhal febricula of\r\n1733[627]. In London it must have begun in the end of August, to judge by\r\nthe characteristic rise in the weekly bills, and in the item of “fevers”\r\nmore especially; and although the deaths kept high for a longer period\r\nthan in 1733, yet no single week of 1737 had much more than half the\r\nhighest weekly mortality of the preceding influenza season.\r\n\r\n_London Weekly Mortalities._\r\n\r\n1733\r\n\r\n  Week ending  Fevers  All causes\r\n\r\n  January  16    69      531\r\n           23    83      783\r\n           30   243     1588\r\n  February  6   170     1166\r\n           13   110      628\r\n           20    66      591\r\n\r\n1737\r\n\r\n  Week ending  Fevers  All causes\r\n\r\n  August   30   117      611\r\n  September 6   161      720\r\n           13   201      837\r\n           20   229      861\r\n           27   167      770\r\n  October   4   143      687\r\n           11   114      551\r\n\r\nIn Dublin the worst week’s mortality in 1737, in the month of October, was\r\n144, whereas in the influenza of 1733 the highest weekly bill had been\r\nonly 98[628]. Hardly any particulars of the influenza of 1737 remain,\r\nalthough it appears to have been widely diffused, being recorded for\r\nBarbados and New England. The only source of English information is Huxham\r\nof Plymouth, who mentions some symptoms which should serve to characterize\r\nthis outbreak, namely: violent swelling of the face, the parotids and\r\nmaxillary glands, followed by an immense discharge of an exceedingly acrid\r\npituita from the mouth and nose; toothache and, in some, hemicrania; “in\r\nmultitudes,” wandering rheumatic pains; in others violent sciatics; in\r\nsome griping of the bowels. Huxham makes one interesting statement: “This\r\ncatarrhal fever has prevailed more or less for several winters past;” or,\r\nin other words, the interval between the severe influenza of 1733 and the\r\nmilder influenza of 1737 was not altogether clear of the disease. He adds\r\nthat it put on various forms, according to the different constitutions of\r\nthose it attacked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1743.\r\n\r\nSix years after, in 1743, came another influenza, which presents some\r\ninteresting points. A writer in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ for May, 1743,\r\nsays that the epidemic began in September last in Saxony, that it\r\nprogressed to Milan, Genoa, and Venice, and to Florence and Rome, where it\r\nwas called the Influenza; in February last (1743) no fewer than 80,000\r\nwere sick of it [? in Rome] and 500 buried in one day. At Messina it was\r\nsuspected to be the forerunner of a plague--which did, indeed, ensue. It\r\nis now (May) in Spain, depopulating whole villages. The outbreak in Italy\r\nis authenticated by many notices collected by Corradi, Brescia having had\r\nthe epidemic in October, 1742, Milan and Venice in November, Bologna in\r\nDecember, Rome, Pisa, Leghorn, Florence and Genoa in January, 1743, Naples\r\nand the Sicilian towns in February. The English troops, in cantonments\r\nnear Brussels, were little touched by it when it reached that capital\r\nabout the end of February, but, strangely enough, “many who in the\r\npreceding autumn had been seized with intermittents then relapsed[629].”\r\n\r\nIn London the epidemic appears to have begun in the end of March, and had\r\ntrebled the deaths in the week ending 12th April; by the beginning of May\r\nit was practically over.\r\n\r\n_London Weekly Mortalities._\r\n\r\n1743\r\n\r\n  Week ending  Fevers  All causes\r\n\r\n  March 29       94      579\r\n  April  5      189     1013\r\n        12      300     1448\r\n        19      223     1026\r\n        26      115      629\r\n  May    3       82      537\r\n\r\nThe familiar view of the influenza in London is given in a letter by\r\nHorace Walpole from Arlington Street, 25 March, 1743[630]:\r\n\r\n    “We have had loads of sunshine all the winter: and within these ten\r\n    days nothing but snows, north-east winds and _blue plagues_. The last\r\n    ships have brought over all your epidemic distempers; not a family in\r\n    London has scaped under five or six ill; many people have been forced\r\n    to hire new labourers. Guernier, the apothecary, took two new\r\n    apprentices, and yet could not drug all his patients. It is a cold and\r\n    fever. I had one of the worst, and was blooded on Saturday and Sunday,\r\n    but it is quite gone; my father was blooded last night; his is but\r\n    slight. The physicians say there has been nothing like it since the\r\n    year thirty-three, and then not so bad [the bill of mortality almost\r\n    the same]; in short our army abroad would shudder to see what streams\r\n    of blood have been let out! Nobody has died of it [as yet, but later\r\n    some 1000 in a week above the usual bill] but old Mr Eyres of Chelsea,\r\n    through obstinacy of not bleeding; and his ancient Grace of York;\r\n    Wilcox of Rochester succeeds him, who is fit for nothing in the world\r\n    but to die of this cold too.”\r\n\r\nThe account in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ confirms the vast shedding of\r\nblood: “In the last two months it visited almost every family in the city;\r\nso that the surgeons and all the phlebotomists had full employment.\r\nBleeding, sweating and blistering were the remedies usually prescribed.\r\nAll over the island it cut off old people. At Greenwich upwards of twenty\r\nhospital men and boys were buried in a night[631].” In Edinburgh, as in\r\nLondon, the weekly burials were trebled. On Sunday, May 6th, fifty sick\r\npersons were prayed for in the Edinburgh churches, and in the preceding\r\nweek there had been seventy burials in the Greyfriars, being three times\r\nthe usual number[632]. It reached Dublin in May, proving milder and less\r\nfatal than in London (perhaps that is why the writer in the _Gentleman’s\r\nMagazine_ says it did not visit Ireland at all); it visited, also, the\r\nremote parts of Ulster and Munster, scarce sparing a family[633].\r\n\r\nIt had reached Plymouth in the end of April. Huxham, who is again the\r\nchief witness to its symptoms, says that it was much less severe there\r\nthan in the south of Europe or even than in London.\r\n\r\n    Innumerable persons were seized at once with a wandering kind of\r\n    shiver and heaviness in the head; presently also came on a pain\r\n    therein, as well as in the joints and back; several, however, were\r\n    troubled with a universal lassitude. Immediately there ensued a very\r\n    great and acrid defluxion from the eyes, nostrils and fauces, and very\r\n    often falling upon the lungs, which occasioned almost perpetual\r\n    sneezings, and commonly a violent cough. The tongue looked as if\r\n    rubbed with cream. The eyes were slightly inflamed; and, being\r\n    violently painful in the bottom of the orbit, shunned the light. The\r\n    greater part of the sick had easy, equal and kindly sweats the second\r\n    or third day, which, with the large spitting, gave relief. Great loss\r\n    of strength, however, remained. Frequently towards the end of this\r\n    “feveret,” several red angry pustules broke out: often, likewise, a\r\n    sudden, nay a profuse, diarrhoea with violent griping. In many cases\r\n    Huxham was astonished at the vast sediment (yellowish white), which\r\n    the urine threw down, “than which there could not be a more favourable\r\n    symptom[634].” One remarkable feature of the epidemic of 1743 was\r\n    recalled by W. Watson in a letter to Huxham on the epidemic of 1762:\r\n    “In the disorder of 1743 the skin was very frequently inflamed when\r\n    the fever ran high; and it afterwards peeled off in most parts of the\r\n    body[635].”\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Localized Influenzas and Horse-colds.\r\n\r\nFor the space of nineteen years, from 1743 to 1762, there occurred no\r\nuniversal cold common to all the countries of Europe; the convergence of\r\npositive testimony, which is so remarkable on many occasions from the 16th\r\ncentury onwards, is found on no occasion during that interval. And yet the\r\nperiod is not wanting in instructive notices of epidemic catarrh, which I\r\nshall take from English writings only. British troops occupied Minorca\r\nduring some of those years, and the epidemics of the island were carefully\r\nnoted by Cleghorn. Under the year 1748 he writes:\r\n\r\n    “About the 20th April there appeared suddenly a catarrhal fever, which\r\n    for three weeks raged so universally that almost everybody in the\r\n    island was seized with it. This disease exactly resembled that which\r\n    was so epidemical in the year 1733. For in most part of the sick the\r\n    feverish symptoms went off with a plentiful sweat in two or three\r\n    days; while the cough and expectoration continued sometime longer. In\r\n    a few athletic persons, who were not blooded in time, it terminated in\r\n    a fatal pleurisy or phrensy[636].”\r\n\r\nAnother English epidemiographist, Hillary, who had begun his records at\r\nRipon, was in those years resident in Barbados; and in that island, as in\r\nMinorca, we hear of unmistakeable universal colds, although none of them\r\nat the same time as the one recorded by Cleghorn. The Barbados annalist\r\nrecords a general catarrhous fever in September, 1752[637], and a\r\nrecurrence of the same in the end of December, lasting until February 1753\r\n(catarrh and coryza, cough, hoarseness, a great defluxion of rheum, some\r\nhaving fever with it). As it ceased in February, 1753, a slow nervous\r\nfever began, and continued epidemic for eighteen months, until September,\r\n1784, when it totally disappeared, and was not seen again so long as\r\nHillary remained in the island (1758). In 1755 there was another epidemic\r\ncatarrhal fever, first in February and again in the end of the year. In\r\nthe earlier outbreak, few escaped having more or less of it, the symptoms\r\nbeing cold ague for a few hours, followed by a hot fever with great pain\r\nin the head, or pains in the back and all over the body, which lasted two\r\nor three days, or longer, and then went off in some by a critical sweat.\r\nIn the October outbreak it affected children mostly. Once more, in 1757,\r\nthe same catarrhous fever returned, with almost the same\r\ncircumstances[638]. That year there was a universal catarrh in North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nNot less remarkable than the epidemic catarrhal fever in Minorca in 1748,\r\nor those in Barbados in 1752-3, 1755 and 1757, was the epidemic of 1758 in\r\nScotland[639]. It was first noticed with east winds from the 16th to 20th\r\nSeptember, several children having taken fever like a cold. In the last\r\nweek of September thirty out of sixty boys at the Grammar School of\r\nDalkeith were seized with it in two or three days. In October it became\r\nmore general, among old and young, and increased till about the 24th, when\r\nit began to abate. In Edinburgh not one in six or seven escaped. It was in\r\nmost parts of Scotland in October--Kirkaldy, St Andrews, Perthshire (where\r\nmany died of it), Ayrshire, Glasgow, Aberdeenshire, Rossshire (end of\r\nOctober). A gentleman told Dr Whytt that in the Carse of Gowrie, in\r\nSeptember, “before this disease was perceived, the horses were observed to\r\nbe more than usually affected with a cold and a cough.”\r\n\r\nThe symptoms in Scotland were of the Protean kind of “influenza”: there\r\nmight be fever with no cold; or a coryzal attack with little or no fever;\r\nor some had bleeding at the nose for several days, which might be profuse;\r\nor the soreness and pains in the bones might be in all parts of the body,\r\nor confined to the cheekbones, teeth and sides of the head. Others had a\r\nfever without any distinctive concomitant, but a cough when the fever\r\nsubsided[640]. One of Whytt’s patients, a lady aged thirty, had been\r\nfeverish for four days, when a scarlet rash appeared, but did not come\r\nfully out; the fall of the pulse and fever coincided with the beginning of\r\na troublesome tickling cough, “so that the cough might be said to have\r\nbeen truly critical.” Those who exposed themselves too soon frequently\r\nrelapsed. Few died of the disease, except some old people. “In some parts\r\nof the country, when the disease was not taken care of in the beginning,\r\nas being attended with no alarming symptoms, it assumed the form of a slow\r\nfever, which sometimes proved mortal.”\r\n\r\nThe year after the localised influenza of Scotland there was an epidemic\r\nof the same kind in Peru and Bolivia, that year, 1759, being one in which\r\nno universal fever or catarrh is reported from any other country. It\r\nextended from south to north, along the coast as well as over the high\r\ntable-lands of Bolivia and the sierra region of Peru, invading, among\r\nothers, the populous towns of Chuquisaca, Potosi, La Paz, Cuzco and Lima.\r\nIn five or six days hardly one inhabitant of a place had escaped it,\r\nalthough some had it very slightly. As it was swift in its attack, so it\r\nwas soon over, lasting about a month in each place. Its symptoms were\r\ngreat dizziness and heaviness of the head (vertigo and gravedo),\r\nfeebleness of all the senses, deafness, strong pains over all the body,\r\nmoderate fever, weariness, great prostration, complete loss of appetite,\r\nbleeding from the mouth and nostrils (this had been noted in Scotland the\r\nyear before), and a long convalescence. Dogs shared the disorder, and\r\nmight have been seen lying stretched out in the streets, unable to stand.\r\nIt will be observed that the symptoms given do not include catarrh[641].\r\n\r\nBefore we come to the next general influenza in Britain, that of 1762,\r\nthere are some facts to be mentioned as to agues and horse-colds in the\r\ninterval since 1743. In Rutty’s Dublin chronology, agues are entered as\r\nprevalent in 1745. In 1750, about the middle or end of December, the most\r\nepidemic and universally spreading disease among horses that anyone living\r\nremembered made its appearance in Dublin, and in Ulster and Munster almost\r\nas soon. It had been in England in November, and was like that which\r\npreceded the universal catarrhs of mankind in 1737 and 1743. In 1751,\r\nirregular agues were frequent in March, as were also tumours of the face,\r\njaws and throat. Agues also continued to be frequent in April, both in\r\nDublin and in several parts of the country. In December, 1751, and\r\nJanuary, 1752, there was another horse-cold, the same as a twelvemonth\r\nbefore. In 1754 the spring agues were frequent in Kilkenny and Carlow,\r\nthough rare in Dublin. In 1757, “intermittent fevers, which had not\r\nappeared since April, 1746,” came in the end of February. In 1760, a great\r\ncatarrh among horses became general in Dublin in April. Coughs and tumours\r\nabout the fauces and throat, with a slight fever, often occurred in March;\r\nand regular intermittents, tertians or quotidians, were more frequent than\r\nfor some years past. These, according to Sims, of Tyrone, abated after\r\n1762, so that he had not seen an intermittent since 1764 until the date of\r\nhis writing, 1773.\r\n\r\nThe horse-cold of 1760 was observed in London in January. The _Annual\r\nRegister_ says under date 27 Jan.: “A distemper which rages amongst horses\r\nmakes great havock in and about town. Near a hundred died in one week.” In\r\na letter a day later (28 Jan.) Horace Walpole writes: “All the horses in\r\ntown are laid up with sore throats and colds, and are so hoarse you cannot\r\nhear them speak.... I have had a nervous fever these six or seven weeks\r\nevery night, and have taken bark enough to have made a rind for\r\nDaphne[642].” This same horse-cold is reported from the Cleveland district\r\nof Yorkshire: “In February, [1760] horses were invaded by the most\r\nepidemic cold or catarrh that has ever happened in the remembrance of the\r\noldest men living[643].” The same authority for Cleveland says that\r\nintermittents were frequent and obstinate in the spring of 1760.\r\n\r\nAmong these miscellanies of the history may be mentioned an outbreak of\r\n“violent pleuritic fever or peripneumene” in the spring of 1747, which was\r\nfatal to a comparatively large number in the parish of George Ham, North\r\nDevon. Thirteen died of it from the 20th to the 31st March, four in April,\r\nfour in May, and one in June, “most of them in four or five days after the\r\nfirst seizure.” The same family names recur in the list[644].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1762.\r\n\r\nThe universal slight fever or catarrhal fever of 1762 was, in London, much\r\nless mortal than those of 1733 and 1743.\r\n\r\n_London Weekly Mortalities._\r\n\r\n1762\r\n\r\n  Week ending  Fevers  All causes\r\n\r\n  May  4         72       467\r\n      11        104       626\r\n      18        159       750\r\n      25        162       659\r\n  June 1        121       516\r\n       8         85       504\r\n\r\nIt began in London about the 4th of April, and by the 24th of that month\r\n“pervaded the whole city far and wide, scarcely sparing anyone.” It was in\r\nEdinburgh by the beginning of May, and in Dublin about the same time, but\r\ndid not reach some parts of Cumberland until the end of June. Short, who\r\nwas then living at Rotherham, says that it “continued most of the\r\nsummer[645].” It had the usual variety of symptoms in the individual\r\ncases, of which only a few need be again particularized. Where the fever\r\nwas sharp, it usually remitted during the day, having its exacerbation in\r\nthe night. Sometimes it proved periodical, and of the tertian type: “it\r\nusually returned every night with an aggravation of the feverish symptoms”\r\n(Rutty). Perspiration was a constant symptom; the tongue was as if covered\r\nwith cream (Baker repeats this figure of Huxham’s in 1743). “Depression of\r\nmind and failure of strength were in all cases much greater than was\r\nproportionate to the amount of disease. A great number of those affected\r\nwere very slowly restored to health, languishing for months, and some even\r\nfor a whole year with cough and feverishness--relics of the disease which\r\nit was difficult to shake off. Some, after struggling long with impaired\r\nhealth, fell victims to pulmonary consumption. In some there were pains in\r\nall the joints and in the head, with lassitude and vehement fever, but\r\nwith little signs of catarrh.” Rutty, of Dublin, says that in some a\r\nmeasly efflorescence or a red rash was seen, attended by violent\r\nitching[646]. Among labourers in the country, the pestilence was so\r\nviolent as to destroy many within four days, from complications of\r\npneumonia, pleurisy and angina. Sometimes it took the form of a slow\r\nfever, “and approximated to that form of malady which the ancients\r\ndenominated ‘cardiac’[647].”\r\n\r\nThe mortality is said to have varied much. White, of Manchester, declared\r\nthat fewer died there than in ordinary while the epidemic lasted. On the\r\nother hand Offley, of Norwich, said there were more victims there than by\r\nthe epidemic of 1733 “or by the more severe visitation called influenza in\r\n1743”--the two visitations which were incomparably the worst in the whole\r\nhistory, according to the London bills. Baker says that it infested cities\r\nand the larger towns crowded with inhabitants earlier than the surrounding\r\nvillages, and is inclined to think that it was mostly brought by persons\r\ncoming from London[648].\r\n\r\nThe progress of this epidemic over Europe had been peculiar. It was seen\r\nin the end of February, 1762, at Breslau, where the deaths rose from 30 or\r\n40 in a week to 150. It was in Vienna at the end of March, and in North\r\nGermany about the same time as in England--April and May. There were at\r\nthat time British troops in Bremen, among whom the epidemic appeared\r\nshortly after the 10th April[649].\r\n\r\n    “It looked at first as if they were going to have agues, but soon they\r\n    were attacked with a cough and a difficulty of breathing and pain of\r\n    the breast, with a headache, and pains all over the body, especially\r\n    in the limbs. The first nights they commonly had profuse sweats. In\r\n    several it had the appearance of a remitting fever for the two or\r\n    three first days.” The cough in many was convulsive. The epidemic\r\n    seized most of the people in the town of Bremen: very few of the\r\n    British escaped, but none of them died, except one or two, from a\r\n    complication of drunkenness and pneumonia.\r\n\r\nIt is said to have been nowhere in France except in Strasburg and the rest\r\nof Alsace, in June. Baker says, “Whilst it raged everywhere else, it did\r\nnot reach Paris or its vicinity, a fact which I learned from trustworthy\r\npersons.” On board British ships of war in the Mediterranean it occurred\r\nin July. Its severity appears to have varied greatly in different cities\r\nof the same country. Rutty, for Ireland, agrees with Baker, for England,\r\nthat it was more fatal in the country than in the towns.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1767.\r\n\r\nThe next influenza, that of 1767, was so unimportant that its existence in\r\nEngland would hardly have been known but for Dr Heberden’s paper, “The\r\nEpidemical Cold in June and July 1767[650].” Those few who were affected\r\nby a cold in London early in June observed that it differed from a common\r\ncold, and resembled the epidemical cold of the year 1762, on account of\r\nthe great languor, feverishness, and loss of appetite. It became more\r\ncommon, was at its height in the last week of June or beginning of July,\r\nand before the end of July had entirely ceased. It was less epidemical and\r\nfar less dangerous than the cold of 1762, so much so that the London bills\r\nof mortality hardly witness at all to its existence. The attack began with\r\nseveral chills; then came a troublesome and almost unceasing cough, very\r\nacute pains in the head, back, and abdomen under the left ribs,\r\noccasioning want of sleep. Many of the symptoms hung upon several for at\r\nleast a week, and sometimes lasted a month. The fever might be great\r\nenough to bring on deliriousness, yet had plain remissions and\r\nintermissions. The same disorder was reported to be common about the same\r\ntime in many other parts of England, and more fatal than it was in London.\r\nHeberden did not anticipate from it the lingering effects in the\r\nindividual, for months or years, which marked so many of the cases in\r\n1762[651].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1775.\r\n\r\nHeberden invited physicians in the provinces to send in accounts of the\r\nepidemic of June and July, 1767, but no one seems to have responded.\r\nHowever, the next epidemic catarrh, of November and December, 1775, was\r\nmade the subject of many communications from all parts of Britain, in\r\nresponse to a circular drawn up by Dr John Fothergill. This was a\r\ndistinctly catarrhal epidemic, running of the nose and eyes, cough and\r\n(or) diarrhoea, being commonly noted.\r\n\r\nAt Northampton some had “a severe pain in one side of the face, affecting\r\nthe teeth and ears, and returning periodically at certain hours in the\r\nevening, or about midnight, attended with vertigo, delirium and limpid\r\nurine during the exacerbation. Some whose cases were complicated with the\r\nabove symptoms had a general rash, but without its proving critical....\r\nMany of those who escaped the catarrh have been more or less sensible of\r\ngiddiness, or pains in the head or face,” with limpid urine, etc., as if\r\nthey had a full attack[652]. The epidemic began in London about the 20th\r\nOctober, and made a slight impression upon the bills of mortality in some\r\nweeks of November and December[653]. Grant says that it lasted nearly five\r\nmonths in London, having been attended by the same “comatose” fever which\r\nSydenham associated with the epidemic catarrh of 1675. The fatalities in\r\nGrant’s practice occurred late in the epidemic:\r\n\r\n    “On the 23rd December [1775] I had lost one patient, and soon after\r\n    two others; all died comatous, owing, as I then imagined, to the\r\n    remains of the comatose fever of Sydenham, which had raged all the\r\n    autumn, was complicated with the catarrhous fever, and continued by\r\n    the wet, warm uncommon weather for the season of the year; and I still\r\n    [1782] am of opinion that this complication is the reason why the\r\n    epidemic catarrh of 1775 proved much more fatal than it did in 1782--a\r\n    fact known to all of us[654].”\r\n\r\nA Liverpool writer also says that the catarrh of 1782 “distinguished by\r\nthe same title,” was a much slighter complaint than the “influenza” of\r\n1775. The latter, however, was a summer epidemic, and was naturally less\r\ncomplicated with pneumonia and bronchitis, whatever the “comatose” fever\r\nof 1775 may have been. Grant’s statement that the influenza of 1775 lasted\r\nfive months in London is borne out by the Foundling Hospital records: on\r\n11 November, there were 16 in the Infirmary with “epidemic fever and\r\ncough,” next week 22 with “fevers, coughs and colds,” and so on week by\r\nweek under the same names until the 9th of March, 1776[655]. At Dorchester\r\nit was general after 10th November; about the same time it was in Exeter,\r\nwhere within a week it seized all the inmates, but two children, in the\r\nDevon and Exeter Hospital, to the number of 173 persons. The middle of\r\nNovember is also the date of its decided outbreak at Birmingham, at\r\nWorcester, and at Chester, where Howard found the prisoners suffering from\r\nit. At York in the north, as at Blandford in the south, it is claimed to\r\nhave begun earlier than in London. At Lancaster it was not seen until\r\nthree weeks after the accounts of its prevalence in London began to come\r\nin, but only three days after it was first heard of in Liverpool. At\r\nAberdeen it was fully a month later than in London. It did not visit\r\nFraserburgh, though there was a putrid fever there very fatal at that\r\ntime[656].\r\n\r\nIn many cases the disease assumed the type of an intermittent towards its\r\ndecline, but bark was not useful (Fothergill, Ash, while Baker says that\r\nbark did good when the fever was spent). All the observers agree both as\r\nto its slight fatality and its universality. At Chester it attacked 73 out\r\nof 97 affluent persons, neighbours in the Abbey Square; at the Cross,\r\ninhabited by people in trade, 109 had the disease out of 144; in the\r\nHouse of Industry, not one escaped out of 175; it attacked people in the\r\ncountry rather later than in the town, and less generally, but it was in\r\nvillages and even in solitary houses.\r\n\r\nThe unusual prevalence of catarrh among horses (and dogs) is asserted by\r\nJohn Fothergill (“during this time”), Cuming (“after the middle of August\r\nvery generally in Yorkshire”), Glass (in September), Haygarth (in North\r\nWales, about August and September), Pulteney (“before we heard of it among\r\nthe human race”). The fullest statement is by Dr Anthony Fothergill, of\r\nNorthampton:\r\n\r\n    “This distemper prevailed some time among horses before it attacked\r\n    the human species. The cough harassed them severely and rendered them\r\n    unfit for work, though few died. About the same time also it infested\r\n    the canine species and with great fatality, especially hounds. An\r\n    experienced huntsman informed me that it ran through whole packs in\r\n    many parts of England and that several dogs died[657].”\r\n\r\nThe progress of influenza from other countries towards Britain was so much\r\na matter of rumour or vague statement in the earlier periods that it has\r\nnot seemed worth while to make a point of it under each epidemic. It\r\nhappens, however, that there is good evidence of the line of progress of\r\nthe epidemic of 1775. The afterwards celebrated Professor Gregory, of\r\nEdinburgh, encountered it in Italy in the autumn, and followed it all the\r\nway home to Scotland. He saw it successively in Genoa, in the south of\r\nFrance, in the north of France, in London, and last of all in Edinburgh,\r\nwhere he himself at length fell ill with it, several of his travelling\r\ncompanions having taken it in Italy two or three months before. In his\r\nlectures long after (as reported by Christison, who heard them about 1817)\r\nhe traced the influenza of 1775 from south to north: “It appears to have\r\nbroken out somewhere on the north and west coast of Africa, whence it\r\nspread not only north into Europe, but likewise eastward to Arabia, Egypt,\r\nSyria, Palestine, Asia Minor, Hindostan, China, and was ascertained to\r\nhave spread over the whole immense empire of the Chinese. From China it\r\nreturned westward by a northern route through the extensive dominions of\r\nRussia and from that country it was sent again over Europe in 1782[658].”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1782.\r\n\r\nSeven years after, in the early summer of 1782, there came another swift\r\nand brief wave of catarrhal fevers over England, Scotland and Ireland, in\r\nthe midst of a great “constitution” of epidemic agues which continued for\r\nseveral years. This was the occasion when the Italian name of “influenza”\r\nwas formally adopted by the College of Physicians. Perhaps the first\r\nappearance of the name in English was in an account of the epidemic in\r\nItaly in 1729, given by a London periodical devoted to political news from\r\nforeign countries, and called, “The Political State of Great\r\nBritain[659].” In 1743 the news of the Italian epidemic under its native\r\nname reached London before the infection itself, the Italian name being\r\nfrequently given to it while it lasted that season in England. When the\r\nnext epidemic came, in 1762, it was not called the influenza as a matter\r\nof course, but was compared to the disease in 1743 “called the influenza.”\r\nIn the epidemic of 1775, “influenza” came more into use, and in 1782 it\r\nwas the name usually given to the epidemic malady. The adoption of this\r\nname put an end at length to the ambiguity between epidemic agues and\r\ninfluenzas, leaving the curious correspondences between them in time and\r\nplace, or the nosological affinities between them, as interesting as ever.\r\n\r\nAs late as the very fatal aguish years 1727-29, there was no clear\r\nseparation of the epidemic agues from the influenzas, of which latter\r\nthere were two or more, the one in the end of 1729 being easy to identify.\r\nIn the great aguish constitution of 1678-81, Sydenham distinguished the\r\nepidemic coughs and catarrhs in Nov. 1679; but Morley made no such\r\ndistinction, describing the whole series of agues for two seasons (and he\r\nmight have done so for two seasons more) as the “new fever,” “new ague,”\r\nor “new delight,” as in Derbyshire, without a suspicion that the universal\r\ncoughs, catarrhs and fevers in November, 1679, were something\r\nnosologically distinct, which the future would identify as “influenza.” In\r\nlike manner Whitmore, in the great aguish period immediately preceding,\r\nthat of 1658-59, had described the “new disease” as one single Proteus. In\r\nthe still earlier epidemic seasons of 1557-58 and 1580-82, everything was\r\n“ague,” although we now discover influenza mixed therewith. I do not say\r\nthat this inclusive naming was the better scientifically; nor do I uphold\r\nWillis and Sydenham in their teaching that the intermittent constitution\r\npassed into the catarrhal, in 1658 and 1679 respectively. But it is\r\nnecessary to bear in mind the matter of fact, namely, that those agues,\r\namidst which the “great colds” occurred, were epidemic agues, and not the\r\nendemic fevers of malarious places; and I have now to show that the\r\n“influenza” of 1782 was in like manner a brief episode in the midst of\r\nseveral successive seasons of agues, which were as much “new” or “strange”\r\nas any of those in the earlier history. Whether the epidemic agues of\r\n1780-85 were the last of the kind in Britain had better be left an open\r\nquestion until our most recent and most strange experiences in 1890-93 are\r\nread in the light of history.\r\n\r\nThe influenza of 1782 was a very definite incident of a few weeks--_teres\r\natque rotundus_. It is easily discoverable in the weekly bills of\r\nmortality in London to have fallen in the month of June:\r\n\r\n_London Weekly Mortalities._\r\n\r\n1782\r\n\r\n  Week ending   Fevers   All causes\r\n\r\n  May   21        45        336\r\n        28        49        390\r\n  June   4        57        385\r\n        11       121        560\r\n        18       110        473\r\n        25        89        434\r\n  July   2        49        296\r\n\r\nThe sudden rise and fall of the deaths and the height reached are much the\r\nsame as in other such epidemics in the summer--the “gentle correction” of\r\n1580, the “transient slight fever” of 1688, and the epidemic catarrh of\r\n1762. On the other hand the epidemics of autumn, winter or spring in 1729,\r\n1733, 1737 and 1743 were far more severe, while the winter epidemics of\r\n1675 and 1679 had figures almost the same as the summer epidemics.\r\n\r\nThe influenza of 1782 was not remarkable, whether in its fatality or in\r\nits characters; but it received far more attention than any that had\r\npreceded it. Two collective inquiries were held upon it, one by a Society\r\nfor promoting Medical Knowledge[660], the other by a committee of the\r\nCollege of Physicians of London[661], many physicians all over England,\r\nScotland and Ireland contributing to one or other. There were also three\r\nor more separate essays[662].\r\n\r\nThe epidemic appeared in 1782 at Newcastle in the end of April, and raged\r\nthere all May and part of June. In London it appeared between the 12th and\r\n18th of May, in the Eastern Counties about the middle of May, in Surrey\r\nand at Portsmouth, Oxford and Edinburgh, also about the third week of May,\r\nbut not in Musselburgh until the 9th or 10th of June. It was at Chester on\r\nthe 26th of May, at Plymouth on the 30th, at Ipswich, Yarmouth, York,\r\nLiverpool and Glasgow in the first week of June. In Northumberland it was\r\nraging in July, and did not cease until the third week of August. In\r\nScotland it was at a height in July, during the haymaking[663]. The most\r\ncurious fact in its incidence comes from North Devon; it was prevalent in\r\nBarnstaple at the usual time, the month of June; but the neighbouring town\r\nof Torrington was not then affected by it, having previously gone through\r\nthe epidemic, it is said, from a date as early as the 24th of March[664].\r\nIn all places it spread quickly, affecting from three-fourths to\r\nfour-fifths of the adult inhabitants, but children not so much. At\r\nChrist’s Hospital, London, only fourteen out of seven hundred boys had it.\r\nWherever it attacked children, it did so mildly. It lasted under six weeks\r\nin each place that it came to. There were some strange attacks of it in\r\nLondon in September, “two months after the late epidemical catarrh had\r\nentirely disappeared from England.” The king’s ships ‘Convert’ and\r\n‘Lizard’ arrived in the Thames from the West Indies in September. Their\r\ncrews were perfectly healthy till they reached Gravesend, where they took\r\non board three custom-house officers; and in a very few hours after that\r\nthe influenza began to make its appearance. Hardly a man in either ship\r\nescaped it; and many both of the officers and common seamen had it in a\r\nsevere degree[665]. Others who came to London from the West Indies in\r\nmerchantmen in the end of September were attacked by influenza in their\r\nlodgings in the beginning of October[666]. To this epidemic belong also\r\nthe strange experiences of the Channel Fleet in its two divisions under\r\nHowe and Kempenfelt; but I postpone for the present the whole question of\r\ninfluenza at sea.\r\n\r\nGray thus sums up the great variety of symptoms as related by his numerous\r\ncorrespondents:\r\n\r\n    Chilliness and shivering, sometimes succeeded by a hot fit, the\r\n    alternation continuing for some hours; languor and lassitude,\r\n    sneezing, discharge from the nose and eyes, pain in the head\r\n    (particularly between or over the eyes), cough, sometimes dry,\r\n    sometimes accompanied with expectoration, inflammation in one or both\r\n    eyes, oppression and tightness about the praecordia, difficulty of\r\n    breathing, pain in the breast or side, pain in the loins, neck,\r\n    shoulders or limbs, sense of heat or soreness in the throat and\r\n    trachea, hoarseness, bleeding from the nose, spitting of blood and\r\n    loss of smell and taste, nausea, flatulence. Also watery blisters\r\n    about the upper parts of the body, and swellings in the face and other\r\n    parts, attended with considerable soreness, apparently erysipelatous.\r\n    In some the catarrhal symptoms were very slight, or entirely wanting,\r\n    the disorder in those cases being like a common fever.\r\n\r\nThe committee of the College of Physicians said that “the universal and\r\nalmost pathognomonic symptom was a distressing pain and sense of\r\nconstriction in the forehead, temples, and sometimes in the whole face,\r\naccompanied with a sense of soreness about the cheek-bones under the\r\nmuscles,” reminding one of the _fierro chuto_ or “iron cap” of the South\r\nAmerican epidemic in 1719. Sometimes no catarrhous affection followed\r\nthese strange head pains. The languor of body and depression of spirits\r\nwere thought to be more protracted than in 1762, but the fatalities at the\r\ntime were fewer than in the earlier epidemic, and there were fewer\r\nconsumptions following. Sweating, also, was said by some to be less\r\nremarkable than in 1762; but Carmichael Smyth said: “The late influenza\r\n[1782] might very properly have been named the sweating sickness, as\r\nsweating was the natural and spontaneous solution of it[667].” One\r\ndistinctive thing in the epidemic of 1762 was missed by most in 1782,\r\nnamely, the peculiar constriction of the breast, with heat and soreness of\r\nthe trachea, as if excoriated; but Hamilton describes that very thing for\r\n1782 in Bedfordshire[668]. As in other epidemics of the kind, especially\r\nthose which have been least catarrhal, there were hardly two cases quite\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Epidemic Agues of 1780-85.\r\n\r\nLet us now take up the strange history of epidemic agues for two or three\r\nyears preceding and following the influenza of June, 1782. Sir George\r\nBaker begins his account of them thus[669]: “The predominance of certain\r\ndiseases observable in some years, and the total or partial disappearance\r\nof the same in other years, constitute a subject worthy of our\r\ncontemplation.”\r\n\r\n    These agues were first noticed in London in the spring and autumn of\r\n    1780, but they infested various parts of England a little earlier. In\r\n    the more inland counties the agues were “often attended with\r\n    peculiarities extraordinary and alarming. For the cold fit was\r\n    accompanied by spasm and stiffness of the whole body, the jaws being\r\n    fixed, the eyes staring and the pulse very small and weak.” When the\r\n    hot fit came on the spasms abated, and ceased in the sweating stage;\r\n    but sometimes the spasm was accompanied by delirium, both lasting to\r\n    the very end of the paroxysm. Even in the intermissions a convulsive\r\n    twitching of the extremities continued to such a degree that it was\r\n    not possible to distinguish the motion of the artery at the wrist.\r\n    “This fever had every kind of variety, and whether at its first\r\n    accession it were a quotidian, a tertian or a quartan, it was very apt\r\n    to change from one type to another. Sometimes it returned two days\r\n    successively, and missed the third day; and sometimes it became\r\n    continual. I am not informed that any died of this fever whilst it\r\n    intermitted. It is, however, certain that many country people whose\r\n    illness had at its beginning put on the appearance of intermission,\r\n    becoming delirious, sank under it in four or five days.”\r\n\r\nReynolds, another London physician, in a letter to Sir George Baker\r\nconfirms all that the latter says of these singular epidemic agues: “No\r\ntwo cases resembled each other except in very few circumstances[670]”--the\r\nremark commonly made about the influenza itself. If these descriptions of\r\nthe epidemic ague had not been given by physicians living as late as 1782,\r\nand altogether modern in their methods, we might have supposed that they\r\nwere confusing influenzas with agues, or using the latter term inexactly.\r\n“The ague with a hundred names” is the striking phrase of Abraham Holland,\r\nin his poem on the plague of 1625. Whitmore, describing the fatal epidemic\r\nague (with an episode of influenza) in 1658-59, does not say that it had a\r\nhundred names, but that it assumed a hundred shapes, “which render it such\r\na hocus-pocus to the amazed and perplexed people, they being held after\r\nmost strange and diverse ways with it.... So prodigious in its alterations\r\nthat it seems to outvie even Proteus himself[671].”\r\n\r\nAs farther showing the anomalous character of these epidemic agues, or\r\ntheir difference from the endemic, Baker adds:--\r\n\r\n    “It is a remarkable fact, and well attested, that in many places,\r\n    whilst the inhabitants of the high grounds were harassed by this\r\n    fever, in its worst form, those of the subjacent valleys were not\r\n    affected by it. The people of Boston and of the neighbouring villages\r\n    in the midst of the Fens were in general healthy at a time when fever\r\n    was epidemic in the more elevated situations of Lincolnshire.” Women\r\n    were nearly exempt, but few male labourers in the fields escaped it.\r\n\r\nBaker heard from all parts that the same constitution continued through\r\n1781 and 1782; and that since that time, though it seemingly abated,\r\nyet agues had been much more prevalent than usual, and had even been\r\nfrequent in places where before that period they were uncommon. They\r\nwere very noticeable in London from 1781 to 1785, not least so during\r\nthe very severe cold of the winter and spring of 1783-84. We hear\r\nof great numbers attacked at Hampstead with common intermittents in\r\nFebruary and the following months of 1781, during which time even\r\nthe measles, in the greater number of cases, “ended in very troublesome\r\nintermittents[672]”--just as they were apt to end often in troublesome\r\ncoughs.\r\n\r\nThe annals of Barker, of Coleshill, are full of references to agues, among\r\nother fevers, from 1780 onwards. Under 1781 he writes:--\r\n\r\n    “This spring that very peculiar, irregular, dangerous and obstinate\r\n    disease, the burning, or as the people in Kent properly enough called\r\n    it, the Plague-ague, made its appearance, became very epidemical in\r\n    the eastern part of the kingdom, and raged in Leicestershire, the\r\n    lower part of Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, and in the fens\r\n    throughout the year.... This strongly pestilential disease had such\r\n    an effect upon them that the complexion of their faces continued for a\r\n    time as white as paper, and they went abroad more like walking corpses\r\n    than living subjects.”\r\n\r\nAs many as five persons in an evening were buried from it in some large\r\ntowns in Northamptonshire; and about Boston it was so general and grievous\r\nthat out of forty labourers hired for work in harvest, half of them, it\r\nwas said, would be laid up in three days[673]. In 1783 the “pestilential\r\nagues” were as bad in Northamptonshire and eastern parts as the year\r\nbefore. A Liverpool writer says:\r\n\r\n    “In the autumn of 1782 the quartan ague was very prevalent on the\r\n    opposite shore of the river in Cheshire: it was universal in the\r\n    neighbourhood of Hoylake, where many died of it. Yet it was scarcely\r\n    heard of in Liverpool, although from the uncommon wetness of the\r\n    season it prevailed throughout the kingdom[674].”\r\n\r\nOn October 25, 1783, a correspondent of the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ offered\r\nan explanation of the “present epidemic disorder, which has so long\r\nravaged this country, and that in the most healthy situations of it,”\r\nnamely, “the putrescent air caused by the number of enclosures, and the\r\nmany inland cuts made for navigation[675].” Next year, 1784, appears to\r\nhave been the principal season of epidemic agues on both sides of the\r\nSevern valley, one practitioner at Bridgenorth making them the subject of\r\na special essay[676].\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Fowler brought into use his solution of arsenic\r\nas a substitute for bark in agues, the latter having notably failed in the\r\nepidemics since 1780.\r\n\r\nBaker says: “The distinguishing character of this fever was its obstinate\r\nresistance to the Peruvian bark; nor, indeed, was the prevalence of the\r\ndisease more observable than the inefficacy of the remedy:” in that\r\nrespect the epidemic agues had belied the experience with bark in ordinary\r\nagues. Again, it is singular that bark had failed most, and arsenic been\r\nespecially useful in those parts of England where ordinary malarious agues\r\nwere never seen. One practitioner in Dorset laid in a large stock of\r\narsenic, wherewith he “hardly ever failed to stop the fits soon[677].”\r\nAnother, at Painswick, in Gloucestershire, used it successfully in two\r\nhundred cases of epidemic agues from 1784 onwards. He gives the following\r\naccount of these unusual agues at Painswick:\r\n\r\n    “This town, which is situated on the side of a hill, and is remarkable\r\n    for the purity of its air, is very populous. In the year 1784 the\r\n    epidemic ague, that prevailed in many parts of the kingdom, made its\r\n    appearance in this place, and has continued till the present time\r\n    [Nov. 1787], although previously to that period the disease was hardly\r\n    ever seen here, unless a stranger came with it for the recovery of his\r\n    health, on account of the healthy situation of the place. It affected\r\n    whole families, and appeared to be most violent in spring and autumn.\r\n    In the summer of 1786 it was followed by a fever of the kind called\r\n    typhus, or low nervous fever, which not unfrequently degenerated into\r\n    a putrid fever and proved very fatal[678].” In May, 1785, at a general\r\n    inoculation of smallpox, “many had been afflicted with intermittents\r\n    of several months’ duration attended with anasarcous swellings[679].”\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the following table of cases treated at the Newcastle\r\nDispensary, under the direction of Dr John Clark, during twelve years from\r\n1 October, 1777, to 1 September, 1789, that influenza makes the smallest\r\nshow among them, being far surpassed by the intermittent fevers and\r\ndysenteries, while all three together are greatly exceeded by the\r\nperennial typhus fever:\r\n\r\n                                       Cases treated\r\n\r\n  Putrid fever                            1920\r\n  Intermitting fever                       313\r\n  Epidemic dysentery in 1783 and 1785      329\r\n  Influenza of 1782                         53\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, also, agues became epidemic about the year 1780. There is no\r\nreason to suppose that their prevalence in these years was less\r\nexceptional there than in England and Ireland. It will be seen, indeed,\r\nfrom the following table compiled from the books of the Kelso Dispensary\r\nthat the only years of their considerable prevalence were the same as the\r\nyears of epidemic ague in England.\r\n\r\n_Kelso Dispensary_[680].\r\n\r\n             All    Cases\r\n  Year      Cases  of Ague\r\n\r\n  1777       302      17\r\n  1778       306      33\r\n  1779       460      70\r\n  1780       675     161\r\n  1781       510     103\r\n  1782       440      61\r\n  1783       510      73\r\n  1784       459      40\r\n  1785       573      62\r\n  1786       563      48\r\n  1787       525      24\r\n  1788       577      25\r\n  1789       546      48\r\n  1790       640      18\r\n  1791       715      13\r\n  1792       570      16\r\n  1793       666      19\r\n  1794       447       9\r\n  1795       513      23\r\n  1796       355      12\r\n  1797       318       9\r\n  1798       415       7\r\n  1799       558       2\r\n  1800       665       4\r\n  1801       433       9\r\n  1802       377       5\r\n  1803       308       2\r\n  1804       422       5\r\n  1805       469       0\r\n  1806       318       1\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless the recollection of these epidemic agues that led the\r\nparish ministers who wrote in the ‘Statistical Account of Scotland’ from\r\n1791 to 1799 to remark upon a supposed progressive decline of endemic\r\nague, which they set down to drainage of the land[681]. It is probable,\r\nhowever, that each tradition of ague in Scotland dated from one of its\r\nepidemic periods; it has been shown, indeed, in the foregoing that\r\nScotland in the end of the 17th century was reputed tolerably free from\r\nague, and that the severe agues previous to 1728, which belonged to the\r\nepidemical kind, were thought to be something new.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1788.\r\n\r\nAccording to Barker, of Coleshill, who kept systematic notes of the\r\nepidemic maladies from year to year, there were several recurrences of the\r\ninfluenza of 1782[682]. But there is only one of these seasons, the\r\nsummer of 1788, that other English writers have singled out as a time of\r\ninfluenza. It was undoubtedly of a very mild type, producing hardly any\r\neffect upon the bills of mortality; but it attracted the notice of\r\nseveral. Dr Simmons, the editor of the _London Medical Journal_, became\r\nthe recorder of it, collecting reports from various parts, as others had\r\ndone in 1782. He himself treated 160 cases at the Westminster General\r\nDispensary, and 65 more elsewhere. It was most prevalent in London from\r\nthe second to the fourth week of July, but the mortalities for those weeks\r\nshow no abrupt rise. It was at Chatham, Dover, Plymouth and Bath about the\r\nsame time, at Manchester in the beginning of August, in Cornwall in the\r\nmiddle of August, and at Montrose about the end of August, or perhaps most\r\ncertainly in October. On 5 August, a physician at York wrote: “We have not\r\nhad the slightest appearance of a catarrh in our city or neighbourhood\r\nduring the year.” The epidemic was undoubtedly a partial one in Britain,\r\nand so slight as to have made little impression where it did occur. It is\r\nsaid to have been very general at Warsaw in April or May, at Vienna in\r\nApril (20,000 cases before the 20th), at Munich in June, at Paris in the\r\nend of August and still continuing on the 24th October, at Geneva on the\r\n10th October. Its most constant symptom in England was pain in the\r\nfore-part of the head, with vertigo; next most constant was a pain at the\r\npit of the stomach and along the breast-bone; cough was wanting in perhaps\r\na third of the cases and was always slight, diarrhoea was somewhat\r\ngeneral, running from the eyes exceptional, sore-throat in perhaps\r\none-sixth of the cases[683]. At Plymouth where it was seen earliest and\r\nclearest among the regiment of artillery and in the guardships, the\r\nsymptoms were pain in the head and limbs, soreness of the throat, pain in\r\nthe breast, a feeling of coldness all over the skin, and these followed by\r\ncough, a great discharge from the nose and eyes, and slight nausea. It was\r\nmuch less noticeable among the townspeople than among the troops and\r\nsailors[684]. It occurred chiefly among soldiers or sailors also at Dover\r\nand Chatham. At Bath it was marked by chills, headache, swelling of the\r\nthroat, difficult swallowing, quick pulse, hot, dry skin (but not pungent\r\nas in malignant fever), ending in a sweat; no delirium, but broken sleep\r\nor vigil; the eyes scarcely affected, cough in some, but not vehement; in\r\nsome, sublingual swellings which suppurated[685]. At Manchester it looked\r\nas if it had been brought in by travellers who had acquired it in\r\nLondon[686].\r\n\r\nAt Portsmouth a singular thing happened two or three months after the\r\nepidemic had passed. The frigate ‘Rose’ arrived on 4 November from\r\nNewfoundland; within a short time all the dogs on board were seized with\r\ncough and catarrh, and soon after the whole ship’s company were affected\r\nin the same way[687]. Simmons says of the epidemic of 1788 in general:\r\n“During the progress of the influenza, a complaint which was evidently an\r\ninflammatory affection of the mucous membrane of the fauces, etc. was\r\nfrequently observed among horses and other cattle, and was generally as\r\nviolent among them as it was mild among their rational neighbours”--many\r\ndying after four or six days.\r\n\r\nThe very slight and partial influenza of July and August, 1788, happened\r\nat a time when there was much fever of a more serious kind in the country.\r\nThe history of the latter belongs to another chapter; but there was in\r\nCornwall, in the same season as the influenza, an epidemic fever which\r\nmight in former times have been described as a part, and the most fatal\r\npart, of the “new disease,” and may be taken in this context rather than\r\nin the chapter on typhus. The same physician, Dr William May, of Truro,\r\ngave an account of the influenza first[688] and of the other fever\r\nafterwards[689].\r\n\r\n    The latter began at Truro in the end of April, 1788, and was also at\r\n    St Ives and other small towns in various parts of the county. A\r\n    malignant fever had for near two years before been exceedingly rife\r\n    among the poor (owing to distress from loss of pilchard fishing), and\r\n    had carried off a great number of them; but this was something new.\r\n    Yet it was “truly a fever of the typhus type,” one of its symptoms\r\n    being constant wakefulness. It passed through whole families,\r\n    affecting all ages and constitutions. It ended on the 17th day,\r\n    whereas the influenza (says May in his other paper) ended with a sweat\r\n    on the fourth or fifth day. In one small neighbourhood this epidemic\r\n    fever affected chiefly the aged, who were blooded owing to dyspnoea:\r\n    out of ten or eleven so affected, not one recovered, an experience\r\n    that reminded May of what Willis said of the village elders being\r\n    swept off by the “new fever” of 1658. Surgeons at St Austel, East Looe\r\n    and Falmouth are cited as having seen much of the same fever. In like\r\n    manner the Manchester chronicler of the influenza of 1788 says:\r\n    “Fevers of different kinds, but chiefly of the type now distinguished\r\n    by the appellation of typhus, were exceedingly prevalent after the\r\n    epidemic catarrh had in great measure ceased to be general; but from\r\n    which, by tracing the symptoms, the fever might usually be found to\r\n    have originated[690].”\r\n\r\nFor a good many years after the period last dealt with, nothing is heard\r\nin Britain either of epidemic agues or of influenza[691]. Writing in 1800,\r\nWillan said that intermittents had not, to his knowledge, been epidemic in\r\nLondon at any time within twenty years. He explains this by “the practice\r\nof draining, and the improved modes of cultivating land in Essex, Kent,\r\nand some other adjoining counties, from which either agues were formerly\r\nimported, or the effluvia causing them were conveyed by particular\r\nwinds”--the latter being the doctrine of Lancisi for the country round\r\nRome. But he forgets that their appearance nearly twenty years before was\r\na strange phenomenon to the practitioners of that generation, and that\r\nSydenham, whom he cites to prove agues in London in former times, had also\r\nremarked their absence, except in occasional cases, for as long a period\r\nas thirteen years. Of such occasional agues acquired in London, Willan\r\nand Bateman had each one or two examples in the autumn of 1794, and the\r\nspring of 1805.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of epidemic agues, so also in the case of influenzas, there\r\nwas immunity in Britain for a good many years after 1788; and, as the\r\nslight epidemic catarrh of 1788 was something less than universal, the\r\nclear interval may almost be reckoned from the summer of 1782, a space of\r\nover twenty years. Willan’s monthly reports of the weather and diseases in\r\nLondon from March, 1796, to December, 1800, twice mention epidemic\r\ncatarrhs,--in February and March, 1797, and in February, 1800, the latter\r\nchiefly among children. But to neither of them will he concede the name of\r\n“influenza,” as the complaint was merely epidemical from a particular\r\nstate of the atmosphere, and not propagated by contagion, nor quite\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n    The symptoms, however, were headache, sometimes attended with vertigo,\r\n    a thin acrid discharge from the nostrils, slight inflammation of the\r\n    throat, a sense of constriction in the chest, with a frequent dry\r\n    cough, pains in the limbs, a white tongue, a quick and small pulse,\r\n    with a sensation of languor and general debility. These symptoms,\r\n    fairly complete for influenza of the correct type, lasted about eight\r\n    days and ended in a gentle sweat or in a diarrhoea. Coughs had been\r\n    remarkably severe and obstinate; they were frequently attended with\r\n    painful stitches and spitting of blood[692].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1803.\r\n\r\nThe number of the _Medical and Physical Journal_ for March, 1803,\r\nannounced that “a cold attended by symptoms of a very alarming nature has\r\nbeen general in the city of Paris for some time”; but it said nothing of\r\nthe alarming disorder being in London. It is in the next number, under the\r\ndate of Soho Square, March 11th, that a correspondent identifies the Paris\r\nepidemic with “the complaint now general in this metropolis, and called by\r\nsome the Influenza.” In a report upon the diseases “in an Eastern District\r\nof London from February 20 to March 20, 1803,” the “catarrhal fever” is\r\nthus described:\r\n\r\n    “This disease has been so general as to claim the title of the\r\n    reigning epidemic, and is very similar to one which prevailed a few\r\n    years ago, and was denominated Influenza. It has generally been\r\n    introduced by chilliness and shivering, which have been succeeded by\r\n    violent pains in the head, with some discharge from the eyes and\r\n    nostrils, as in a common catarrh, together with hoarseness and cough.\r\n    The pains in the head have in some cases been the first symptoms and\r\n    have been succeeded by giddiness, sickness and vomiting” &c. There\r\n    were also rheumatic pains in the limbs, intercostals &c.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the information from various sources showed that the old\r\ninfluenza was once more really in this country. Two collective inquiries\r\nwere made on the influenza of 1803: one by Dr Beddoes of Bristol, who\r\nissued a circular of five queries, and received answers to them (with\r\nother information) from one hundred and twenty-four correspondents[693];\r\nthe other by the Medical Society of London[694]. The _Medical and Physical\r\nJournal_ and Duncan’s _Annals_ each received a few independent papers on\r\nit; and several pamphlets were issued, mostly devoted to treatment--two in\r\nLondon[695], one at Edinburgh[696], one at Bath[697], and one at\r\nBristol[698].\r\n\r\nIn these abundant data there is little novelty and not much variety.\r\n\r\n    The attack began with chills and severe pain in the head, along with\r\n    slight running of the eyes and nose, as typhus fever might have begun.\r\n    After the slightly catarrhal onset the malady was mostly a fever, with\r\n    dry cough, dry and hot skin, pain in the forehead and about the\r\n    eyeballs, pains in the limbs, “spontaneous” weariness and extreme\r\n    prostration--a group of symptoms which led Hooper to find a rheumatic\r\n    character in the malady. Among other symptoms were vertigo, nausea,\r\n    vomiting and diarrhoea. Much sweating is not reported; but there was\r\n    often a gentle sweat in recovering after about a week, less or more.\r\n    There was the usual range from mildness to severity. Pneumonia and\r\n    pleurisy were not rare, and were commonly the cause of fatalities.\r\n\r\nThe deaths were for the most part among the phthisical, the asthmatic and\r\nthe aged; but these were not many, certainly not so many as in 1729, 1733\r\nand 1743, and probably in about the same proportion as in 1762, 1775 and\r\n1782. In the London bills the weekly deaths rose in March, to an average\r\nof 537 from an average of 429 in February, and of 375 in January, falling\r\nto an average of 417 in April. In Ireland the epidemic is said to have\r\nbeen seen among the troops in garrisons as early as December, 1802; it\r\nbecame universal in spring and summer. In Edinburgh the rise in the\r\nburials at Greyfriars churchyard was in the weeks ending 5th and 12th\r\nApril, making them about a half more than usual for the brief period. When\r\nthe wave of influenza was past, the public health in nearly all places\r\nbecame unusually good, as had happened immediately after the influenza of\r\n1782.\r\n\r\nThe question most to the front in the influenza of 1803 was its manner of\r\nspreading. Beddoes, who believed in personal contagion, had this in view\r\nin his five queries:\r\n\r\n    1. When did the influenza appear and disappear with you?\r\n\r\n    2. Was its date different in remote places within your reach?\r\n\r\n    3. After being general, did it occur for some time in single\r\n    instances?\r\n\r\n    4. Did it ever seem to pass from person to person?\r\n\r\n    5. If so, is it likely that clothes or fomites conveyed it in any\r\n    case?\r\n\r\nThe dates of commencement were earlier or later according to no rule of\r\ndirection or of distance from London. In some large towns of Yorkshire it\r\nappeared to be unusually late, in Chester unusually early; Edinburgh,\r\ncertainly, was as long behind London as London was behind Paris. Haygarth,\r\nwho took the most narrow view of contagion, made out the incidence thus:\r\nLondon first, then the towns which have the greatest intercourse with\r\nLondon, such as Bath and Chester, then smaller towns, and last of all the\r\nvillages around each of the more populous centres. Several towns had the\r\nbrunt of the epidemic in the same weeks (of March) as London; in very few\r\nwas it later than the first weeks of April. In some towns it attracted\r\nlittle notice. In North Devon, it was said to have been at Hartland and\r\nClovelly a fortnight before it was seen in Bideford; the first of it seen\r\nby one of the doctors of that town was in a solitary potter’s house four\r\nmiles to the eastward, on a peninsula made by the confluence of a small\r\nstream with the Torridge, all the inmates of the house being attacked; in\r\nthe town itself from first to last he saw but few cases, whereas there\r\nwere many in the adjacent country[699].\r\n\r\nThe general rule seems to have been that the more sparse populations had\r\nit later, the nearer they were to the extremities of the kingdom, as in\r\nCornwall, the north of Scotland, and in Ireland. Opinion was divided as to\r\nthe part played by persons in carrying contagion from place to place, some\r\nholding that the facts of diffusion could be explained on no other\r\nhypothesis, while most held that the influenza was in the air. Beddoes got\r\nas many answers favouring the doctrine of personal contagion as made a\r\nrespectable show for it; but when these had all been set forth to the best\r\nadvantage, a practitioner wrote to say that, after all, nine-tenths of\r\nprofessional opinion was against the contagiousness of influenza. The\r\npractical question for Haygarth, Beddoes, and other contagionists was\r\nwhether influenza was not a disease, like smallpox or scarlet fever, which\r\ncould be kept from spreading by means of isolation, disinfection (with the\r\nfumes of mineral acids) and other precautions.\r\n\r\nSome curious facts came out, showing the effect of influenza upon other\r\nepidemic diseases, or the effect of other epidemic diseases upon\r\ninfluenza. One writer applied to influenza what used to be said of the\r\nplague or pestilential fever, that these Leviathan constitutions swallowed\r\nup all other reigning epidemics. Holywell, a town in Flintshire, with a\r\nlarge cotton-weaving industry, had not been free from a bad kind of typhus\r\nfor two years. “On the appearance of the influenza the typhus entirely\r\nceased, and only one case of fever has occurred since. I have not for many\r\nyears known this country so healthy as since the influenza\r\ndisappeared[700].” The influenza was said also to have superseded typhus\r\nfever at Navan, in Meath[701]. At St Neots typhus was peculiarly prevalent\r\nfor three months before the influenza, but ceased thereafter[702]. Another\r\nrelation to typhus was seen at Clifton: “In the low, confined, and\r\nill-ventilated houses in the Hot Well road, where typhus often abounds,\r\nthe influenza was very unfrequent; while in the exposed high-lying\r\nbuildings on Clifton Hill it was almost universal[703].” As to ague, which\r\nhad often before stood in a remarkable relation to epidemics of catarrhal\r\nfever, there is one possibly relevant fact related from the Lincolnshire\r\nfens. A Wisbech physician writes:\r\n\r\n    “The influenza which ceased here about the middle of April made its\r\n    appearance again in May; the leading symptoms were the same as in the\r\n    first attack. About the same time also a most malignant fever, having\r\n    some symptoms in common with the influenza, began to rage in that part\r\n    of Lincolnshire contiguous to us, which has proved fatal to\r\n    hundreds[704].”\r\n\r\nFrom 1803 to 1831, nothing is heard in England of a universal influenza,\r\nalthough there was one such in the end of 1805 and beginning of 1806 in\r\nRussia, Germany, France and Italy; and there were four great influenzas\r\nin the Western Hemisphere (1807, 1815-16, 1824-25, and 1826). Catarrhs\r\nwere perhaps commoner than usual in England and Scotland in the winter of\r\n1807-8, but they cannot be reckoned an epidemic of influenza[705]. The\r\nsummer following (1808) was unusually hot and agues became more epidemic\r\nin the fens than at any time since the great aguish period of 1780 and\r\nfollowing years[706]. Agues were again unusually rife in England in 1826,\r\n1827 and 1828, at the same time as the remarkable epidemics of them, from\r\ninundations and subsequent drought, in Holland and along the German coast\r\nof the North Sea. Dr John Elliotson, of London, met with cases of agues in\r\nhis practice in those years in the following scale:\r\n\r\n  Year  Cases\r\n\r\n  1823    8\r\n  1824   14\r\n  1825   15\r\n  1826   44\r\n  1827   53\r\n  1828   27\r\n  1829    8\r\n\r\nThey had increased, he says, throughout the country as well as in London,\r\nowing, as he thought, in agreement with Macmichael, to the higher mean\r\ntemperature of the respective years; and he would apply the same law of\r\nincrease to the epidemic periods of ague in Britain in former times[707].\r\nChristison saw his first case of ague at Edinburgh in the autumn of 1827,\r\nin a labourer who had caught it working at the harvest in the fen-country\r\nof Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1831.\r\n\r\nThe next influenza in Britain fell in the early summer of 1831. It was a\r\nmild epidemic of the catarrhal type, which attracted hardly any notice in\r\nEngland. In one of the London medical journals there is no other notice of\r\nit but this, dated 2 July, 1831[708]: “In consequence of the sudden\r\nvariations of temperature which have prevailed since the last fortnight of\r\nMay an epidemic bronchitis has shown itself in Paris.” Another London\r\njournal[709], on the very same day, wrote: “Influenza in a severe form is\r\nat present prevailing in London and some of the provincial towns. It\r\ncommences like a common cold, but is soon discovered to be more serious,\r\n&c.” The physician to the public dispensary in Chancery Lane found that\r\nmore than half of the seventy applicants on 23 June came with the symptoms\r\nof influenza--severe, harsh, dry cough, in paroxysms, pain behind the\r\nsternum, a fixed pain in one side, congested state of the throat, nose and\r\neyes, heaviness of the head, languor, debility, hot skin, foul tongue,\r\nimpaired sense of taste. The symptoms went off after three or four days\r\nwith a sweat in the night and a discharge from the nostrils[710].\r\n\r\nThis epidemic hardly affected the London bills of mortality, according to\r\nthe following figures:\r\n\r\n  Four weeks, 25 May to 21 June, 1579 births, 1430 deaths.\r\n  Five weeks, 22 June to 26 July, 2153 births, 2010 deaths.\r\n  Four weeks, 27 July to 23 Aug., 1997 births, 1652 deaths.\r\n\r\nThe rise in the last four weeks was due to summer diarrhoea, or choleraic\r\ndiarrhoea, which was unusually common in 1831. This slight influenza was\r\nalso reported from Plymouth by a surgeon who had seen the disease, and\r\nsuffered from it, at Manilla in September, 1830[711], and by a Plymouth\r\npractitioner, who wrote, on 14 July, that it had been extensively\r\nprevalent there and in the neighbouring towns and villages[712]. It is\r\nrecorded also from the Isle of Man, Glasgow[713], and Ayr[714], and it is\r\nsupposed to have been in Aberdeen[715]. But, while there are many\r\naccounts of this epidemic in Germany in May and June, and undoubted\r\nevidence of it in France and Italy, as well as in Sweden, and in Poland\r\nand Russia earlier in the year, the accounts of it in Britain are so\r\nmeagre and casual as to make one doubt whether it really was an influenza\r\nworth reckoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1833.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1832, which was the first great season of Asiatic cholera\r\nin Britain, is absolutely free from records of influenza in all Europe. It\r\nwas in the spring of the year following, 1833, that the really serious\r\ninfluenza came. The continental literature of the epidemic of 1833 is\r\nimmense, the English literature of it is all but non-existent: and yet it\r\nwas a very severe influenza with us, just as with other European peoples.\r\nThere was no collective inquiry in Britain on this occasion, such as had\r\nbeen made first by Fothergill in 1775, by the College of Physicians and\r\nanother Society in 1782, by Simmons in 1788, and by Beddoes and the\r\nMedical Society of London in 1803, or such as was made in the next\r\ninfluenza, that of 1837, by a committee of the Provincial Medical\r\nAssociation. But enough is known of it to place it among the severer\r\ninfluenzas. In London the bills of mortality, which relate only to a part\r\nof London, showed the characteristic sudden rise and fall:\r\n\r\n                                   Baptisms Burials\r\n\r\n  Four weeks, 20 Feb. to 16 March   2310     2352\r\n  Five   \"    17 March to 23 April  1955     2105\r\n  Four   \"    24 April to 21 May    2016     3350\r\n  Four   \"    22 May to 18 June     2070     1685\r\n\r\nFor a whole month the burials in London were nearly doubled, and for the\r\ntwo worst weeks they were nearly quadrupled. This mortality, by all\r\naccounts, fell most on the richer classes, to whom it was a much more\r\nserious calamity than the Asiatic cholera of the year before. The\r\npresident of the Medical Society said, on the 22nd April, that he had\r\n“heard of nine lords or ladies who had been carried off by it or by its\r\nindirect agency, in the course of last week[716].” Its type in the month\r\nof May was worse than in April[717]. When it was first seen it was a\r\nsomewhat short catarrhal attack, ending in a sweat after two, three or\r\nfour days, with the usual head-pains, soreness of the ribs and limbs,\r\nlanguor and prostration. Later, it became a more “adynamic” illness,\r\nbeginning indeed with slight catarrhal symptoms, but soon passing into\r\nsubacute nervous fever which might last for three weeks, involving much\r\nrisk to life[718]. Hence arose the warnings, just as in 1890-92, that the\r\ninfluenza was a much more serious thing than it had been thought when the\r\nepidemic began, and hence the delay, as it were, in the bills of mortality\r\nto show the effects of the epidemic until it had been two or three weeks\r\nprevalent. It is to the month of April, before the highest death-rate was\r\nreached in London, that the following, in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_,\r\napplies[719]:\r\n\r\n    “During the month a severe form of catarrhal epidemic, generally\r\n    termed influenza, has been extremely prevalent in London. It has laid\r\n    up at once all the members of many large households, and has attacked\r\n    great numbers in several public offices, particularly the Bank of\r\n    England and some divisions of the new police. The performers at the\r\n    theatres have much suffered, and their houses have been closed for\r\n    several nights. It commences suddenly with headache and feeling of\r\n    general discomfort, attended or soon followed by cough, hoarseness, or\r\n    loss of voice; oppression, and sometimes severe pain in the chest,\r\n    tenderness about the ribs, and sense of having been bruised about the\r\n    limbs or muscles.... The disease is generally attributed to the\r\n    constant north-east winds; but by some of the learned is regarded as\r\n    the epidemic influenza which has lately prevailed in the eastern parts\r\n    of Europe, and that is travelling, like many of its predecessors, to\r\n    the west.”\r\n\r\nIt would have been in this earlier stage of the epidemic, when it was\r\nlaying up whole households, thinning workshops and closing theatres, that\r\na practitioner was heard to say (as reported by the _Lancet_): “Best thing\r\nI ever had! Quite a godsend! Everybody ill, nobody dying!” The seriousness\r\nof the disease was, however, at length recognized, so that the members of\r\nthe Medical Society debated the subject at three successive meetings. One\r\nof the questions was, whether the malady called for blooding--a question\r\nthat had divided opinion as long ago as 1658[720]. On 13 May, the\r\nfollowing passed at the Medical Society:\r\n\r\n    Mr Williams remembered the similar influenza of 1803, and said that\r\n    depletion was then regarded as an injurious plan of treatment.\r\n\r\n    Mr Proctor:--Yes, but the Brunonian doctrines were then in full fling,\r\n    and practitioners had not learned the full use of the lancet.\r\n\r\nGraves states very fairly the reasons that induced them to take blood in\r\nthe influenza of 1833, as well as the results of the practice[721]:\r\n\r\n    “The sudden manner in which the disease came on, the great heat of\r\n    skin, acceleration of pulse, and the intolerable violence of the\r\n    headache,--together with the oppression of the chest, cough, and\r\n    wheezing--all encouraged us to the employment of the most active modes\r\n    of depletion; and yet the result was but little answerable to our\r\n    expectations; for these means were found to induce an awful\r\n    prostration of strength, with little or no alleviation of the\r\n    symptoms.”\r\n\r\nThe prostration, be it said, was probably as great and as frequent in the\r\nepidemics of 1890-93, when bleeding had gone out altogether; still it was\r\nnot understood that all these signs of sthenic action in the attack were\r\nreally paradoxical, as Whitmore, in the passage cited in the note, saw\r\nclearly two centuries before.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic became rapidly prevalent all over England, Scotland and\r\nIreland in April and May, following no very definite order of progression.\r\nThe Liverpool newspapers asserted that ten thousand were down with it in\r\nthat town in one week. A doctor at Lincoln wrote, on 13 May, that few\r\nfamilies there had escaped it[722]. Other towns in which it is said to\r\nhave been “more or less” prevalent were Portsmouth, Sheffield, Birmingham,\r\nLeeds, York, Halifax, Glasgow, Edinburgh[723], Dublin and Armagh; so that\r\nwe may fairly assume, although we are without the detailed evidence\r\navailable for earlier epidemics, that it was ubiquitous in town and\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAt Birmingham[724], among the outpatients of the Infirmary, the cases of\r\ninfluenza were as follows, the 25th and 26th April being the days when\r\ncases came first in rapid succession, while the middle of May was\r\npractically the limit:\r\n\r\n          Cases of\r\n          Influenza    Males    Females\r\n\r\n  April      151         52        99\r\n  May        464        159       305\r\n  June        28          9        19\r\n             ---        ---       ---\r\n             643        220       423\r\n\r\nThe great excess of females is remarkable, but was probably due to some\r\nlocal circumstances. Of the 643 cases, 122 were under ten years of age. Of\r\nthe females, 9 died, of the males 3. But the deaths in Birmingham caused\r\nby the epidemic directly or indirectly were many; the burial registers of\r\nfour churches and chapels showed a marked increase of burials above those\r\nof the corresponding months of 1832:\r\n\r\n           1832      1833\r\n\r\n  April     205       245\r\n  May       211       434\r\n  June      193       230\r\n            ---       ---\r\n            609       909\r\n\r\nMedical opinion in 1833 was decidedly adverse to the contagiousness of\r\ninfluenza. The common remark was that it was just as little contagious as\r\nthe cholera of the year before had proved to be. As in 1837 and 1847, when\r\nthe doctrine of contagiousness was equally out of favour, the disease was\r\nobserved to spread rapidly, in no very definite line, affecting most parts\r\nof the country in the same two or three weeks, affecting the population\r\nwithin a considerable radius almost at once, and the inmates of houses all\r\ntogether. These, it was said, are not the marks of a disease that persons\r\nhand on one to another, _quasi cursores_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1837.\r\n\r\nBetween the influenza of April-May, 1833, and that of January-February,\r\n1837, it seems probable that there were minor catarrhal outbreaks,\r\ndistinguishable from ordinary colds. One writer on the influenza of 1837\r\nrefers to those “who had it in 1834 or in the intervening period between\r\nthe two epidemics.” The table of diseases of the outpatients at the\r\nBirmingham Infirmary for the year 1836 contains a large total of catarrhs,\r\nand, in another line, 24 cases of “epidemic catarrh” in the summer months.\r\nThe _Gentleman’s Magazine_ begins its notice of the epidemic of 1837 by\r\ncalling it “an influenza of a peculiar character,” which shows that\r\ninfluenza of the ordinary kind was a familiar thing. Probably the name was\r\na good deal misapplied in the years following every great epidemic from\r\n1782 onwards: thus in ‘St Ronan’s Well,’ which was written in 1823, or\r\ntwenty years from the last general influenza, a tradesman’s widow in easy\r\ncircumstances and given to good living comes to the Spa on account of a\r\nsupposed malady which she calls the _influenzy_. But our recent\r\nexperiences of four great influenza seasons in succession from 1889-90 to\r\n1893, although it is without precedent in the history, will incline us the\r\nmore to credit what is recorded of influenza cases in the intervals\r\nbetween the years of great historical epidemics[725]. However that may be\r\nfor the years following 1833, the influenza of January, 1837, was sudden,\r\nsimultaneous, universal.\r\n\r\nThe first cases, which Watson compares to the first drops of a\r\nthunder-shower, were seen earlier in some places than in others; but from\r\nall parts of England it was reported that the influenza was at its height\r\nfrom the middle of January to the end of the first week of February.\r\nPossibly it was a few days earlier in London than in most other towns,\r\ninasmuch as the great increase of the deaths that is shown in the\r\nfollowing table, in the second and third weeks of January, would imply a\r\nprevalence of the epidemic for at least a fortnight before.\r\n\r\n_Weekly Mortalities in London (by the old Bills)._\r\n\r\n1837\r\n\r\n  Week ending   Influenza   All causes\r\n\r\n  Jan.  10         0          284\r\n        17        13          477\r\n        24       106          871\r\n        31        99          860\r\n  Feb.   7        63          589\r\n        14        35          558\r\n        21        20          350\r\n        28         8          321\r\n  March  7         4          262\r\n\r\nThis sudden rise in the deaths from all causes is a characteristic\r\ninfluenza bill, comparable with those already given from 1580 onwards.\r\nBut the bill is far from showing the whole of the mortality in London in\r\n1837. The London bills of mortality compiled by the Parish Clerks’ Company\r\nhad fallen into the last stage of inadequacy, and were on the eve of being\r\nsuperseded by the general system of registration for all England and\r\nWales[726].\r\n\r\nThe London bills, so long as they existed, never took in the great\r\nparishes of St Pancras, Marylebone, Kensington and Chelsea. The area\r\n“within the bills of mortality” was that of London about the middle of the\r\n18th century. But, instead of becoming more and more crowded as time went\r\non, it had actually become much less populous, especially in the old City\r\nand Liberties, owing to the erection of warehouses, workshops,\r\ncounting-houses and other non-residential buildings where dwelling houses\r\nused to be; so that the decrease of mortality “within the bills” in the\r\n19th century is in part due to the decrease of population within the same\r\narea. This has to be kept in mind when the above table is compared with\r\none of those for former influenzas, such as that of 1737, exactly a\r\nhundred years before.\r\n\r\nIt was thought that the 1837 influenza in London was worse than that of\r\n1833, but the figures show the contrary as regards the number of deaths\r\nfrom all causes[727]. Both of them, however, were in the first rank of\r\nseverity, finding their nearest parallels in the three great influenzas of\r\nthe 18th century, in 1733, 1737 and 1743, when the deaths from all causes\r\nduring the influenza rose, indeed, to a much larger total within the\r\nbills, but rose from a much higher mean level.\r\n\r\nIn Dublin the great increase of burials from the influenza of 1837 fell\r\nat the same time as in London, according to the following comparison with\r\nthe year before for Glasnevin Cemetery[728]:\r\n\r\n1835-36\r\n\r\n  Dec. 1835     355\r\n  Jan. 1836     392\r\n  Feb.   \"      362\r\n  Mar.   \"      392\r\n               ----\r\n               1501\r\n\r\n1836-37\r\n\r\n  Dec. 1836     413\r\n  Jan. 1837     821\r\n  Feb.   \"      537\r\n  Mar.   \"      477\r\n               ----\r\n               2248\r\n\r\nAt Glasgow the deaths from influenza were as follows[729]:\r\n\r\n1837\r\n\r\n              Males   Females   Total\r\n\r\n  January      111      118      229\r\n  February      37       62       99\r\n  March          9       20       29\r\n               ---      ---      ---\r\n               157      200      357\r\n\r\nBut the heading of “influenza” did not nearly show the full effects of the\r\nepidemic upon the mortality, which was enormous in Glasgow in January, as\r\ncompared with the same month of 1836:\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n            || All causes||Catarrh| Aged| Asthma| Fever| Decline\r\n  ----------||-----------||-------|-----|-------|------|---------\r\n  Jan. 1836 ||    790    ||    4  |  73 |   31  |   45 |   124\r\n  Jan. 1837 ||   1972    ||  229  | 274 |  185  |  201 |   247\r\n\r\nThere was also a great increase in the deaths of infants by bowel\r\ncomplaint. The only period of life which did not show a great rise of\r\nmortality was from five to twenty; the greatest rise was between the ages\r\nof forty and seventy, corresponding to the London experience in the\r\nepidemic of 1847.\r\n\r\nAt Bolton, Lancashire, the great rise in the deaths, as compared with the\r\naverage of five years before, was in February:\r\n\r\n              Average of\r\n              five years\r\n               1831-36     1837\r\n\r\n  January       111·2       115\r\n  February       79·0       205\r\n  March          97·8       100\r\n                -----       ---\r\n                288·0       420\r\n\r\nAt Exeter, the burials in the two chief graveyards were 227 in January\r\nand February, 1837, as compared with 125 in the same months of 1836. These\r\nmortalities, although large, were but a small ratio of the attacks. In\r\n2347 cases enumerated in the collective inquiry, there were 54 deaths, a\r\nratio of two deaths in a hundred cases being considered a full average.\r\nThe attacks were mostly in middle life, and the deaths nearly all among\r\nthe asthmatic, the consumptive and the aged. The ages of one hundred\r\npersons attacked at Birmingham were as follows[730]:\r\n\r\n  Ages   1-   5-   10-   20-   30-   40-   50-   60-   70-   80-90\r\n\r\n  Cases   3    2    12    23    21    19    12     7     0      1\r\n\r\nAt Evesham only five out of 93 were under five years. At Leamington, in a\r\nlist of 170 cases, there were 26 under fourteen years, 119 from fourteen\r\nto sixty-five years, and 25 above the age of sixty-five[731]. In some\r\nplaces males seemed to be most attacked, just as at Birmingham in 1833\r\nthere was a great excess of female cases; but the collective inquiry\r\nshowed that the sexes shared about equally all over. The type of the\r\nmalady was on the whole catarrhal, as in 1833. Nearly all the cases had\r\nsymptoms of sneezing, coughing, and defluxions; many cases had nothing\r\nmore than the symptoms of a severe feverish cold; the more dangerous cases\r\nhad dyspnoea, pneumonia and the like; while all had the languor,\r\nweariness, and soreness in the bones which mark every influenza, whether\r\nit incline more to the moist type of catarrhal fever or to the dry type of\r\nthe old “hot ague.”\r\n\r\nThe influenza of 1837 having been remarkably simultaneous, sudden and\r\nbrief, the doctrine of personal contagiousness found little favour, just\r\nas in 1833. The 12th query sent out by the committee of the Provincial\r\nMedical Association was: “Are you in possession of any proof of its having\r\nbeen communicated from one person to another?” The answers are said to\r\nhave been nearly all negative; namely, that there was “no proof of the\r\nexistence of any contagious principles by which it was propagated from one\r\nindividual to another.” Shapter, a learned physician at Exeter, inclined\r\nto a certain modified doctrine of contagion by persons. Blakiston, of\r\nBirmingham, an exact mathematician, declared that the question as\r\nordinarily stated did not admit of an answer.\r\n\r\nAt Liverpool there was an interesting observation made, exactly parallel\r\nwith those made at Gravesend in 1782 and Portsmouth in 1788. The influenza\r\nof 1837 was practically over by the first or second week of March; but\r\n“that the atmosphere of Liverpool was still contaminated by the epidemic\r\ninfluence up to the middle and latter end of April was apparent from the\r\nfact that many of the officers and men of the American ships, and\r\ngenerally the most robust, were violently attacked shortly after their\r\narrival in port,”--the same being the case also with black sailors on\r\nships arriving from the Brazils and the West Coast of Africa[732]. At the\r\nnaval stations of Sheerness, Portsmouth, Plymouth and Falmouth, every one\r\nof the ships of war had been attacked in January, the ships cruising on\r\nthe south coast of Spain, or lying at Barcelona, in February, the ships at\r\nGibraltar in April, and those at Malta in May. The ‘Thunderer,’ on the\r\npassage from Malta to Plymouth, had the first cases of influenza at sea on\r\nthe 3rd of January, four days before reaching Plymouth[733], as if she had\r\nsailed into an atmosphere of it somewhere near the coast of Brittany.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor fully ten years, from March or April 1837 to November 1847, there was\r\nno great and universal influenza in England. But there were several\r\nundoubted minor, and perhaps localized, outbreaks of an epidemic malady\r\nwhich was in each case judged to be truly the influenza, and not a common\r\ncold. The earliest of these was in the spring of 1841. It was recognized\r\nby the Registrar-General to have been in London from 20 February to 24\r\nApril, the mortality having been little affected by it. It was also\r\nrecognized in Dublin in March, and remarked upon by two physicians to the\r\nCork Street Fever Hospital; it was characterized by the usual languor,\r\nweariness, and pains in the head, by defluxions of the eyes, nose and\r\nthroat, but not by any affection of the lungs, and was in all respects\r\nmild[734]. Exactly a year after, in March, 1842, influenza was described\r\nas epidemic at York[735]: it was noted also in London in March[736], and\r\nis mentioned as having been again in Ireland in 1842[737]. The next\r\nundoubted influenza is reported from a rural part of Cheshire (Holme\r\nChapel) in January, 1844, in the wake of an epidemic of scarlatina; it\r\ncontinued in all kinds of weather until June, and had a remarkable\r\nintercurrent episode, for some weeks from the middle of March, in the form\r\nof an epidemic of pneumonia among young children, which passed into mild\r\nbronchitis in the cases last attacked[738]. Coincidently with the\r\ninfluenza in Cheshire, there is a report of a series of catarrhal cases in\r\nDublin about the beginning of January, 1844, in which the sense of\r\nconstriction and suffocation under the sternum and the paroxysmal\r\ncharacter of the attacks seemed to point to influenza[739]. Two years\r\nafter, a Dublin physician in extensive practice among the rich wrote, at\r\nthe request of a medical editor, an account of an epidemic of influenza in\r\nJanuary and February, 1847; he had sixty cases among children under\r\nfourteen in his private practice, usually several children in one house,\r\nand sometimes the adults in the house[740]. This was in the midst of the\r\ngreat epidemic of relapsing fever in Dublin and all over Ireland, due to\r\nthe potato famine. The same prevalence of influenza to a slight extent is\r\nrecorded also for London at the end of 1846 and beginning of 1847[741]. It\r\nis easy to object that these “influenzas” between 1837 and 1847 were but\r\nthe ordinary catarrhal maladies of the seasons. But the physicians who\r\ntook the trouble to record them--probably more might have done so--were,\r\nof course, aware of the distinction that had to be made between many\r\ncommon feverish colds concurring in the ordinary way, and a truly epidemic\r\ninfluenza, however slight.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenza of 1847-48.\r\n\r\nThe great influenza of 1847 began in London about the 16th or 18th of\r\nNovember, was at its height from the 22nd to the 30th, had “ceased to be\r\nvery prevalent” by the 6th or 8th of December, but affected the bills of\r\nmortality for some time longer, as in the following table:\r\n\r\n_Weekly Mortalities in London._\r\n\r\n1847\r\n\r\n  Week ending All causes  Influenza  Pneumonia  Bronchitis  Asthma  Typhus\r\n\r\n  Nov. 20      1086          4         95         61        12      86\r\n       27      1677         36        170        196        77      87\r\n  Dec.  4      2454        198        306        343        86     132\r\n       11      2416        374        294        299        78     136\r\n       18      1946        270        189        234        52     131\r\n       25      1247        142        131        107        14      83\r\n  Jan.  1      1599        127        148        138        26      74\r\n\r\nIn the thirteen weeks of the first quarter of 1848 the influenza deaths\r\ndeclined as follows: 102, 102, 89, 56, 59, 47, 27, 33, 18, 11, 10, 16, 8.\r\n\r\nThis was the first great epidemic of influenza under the new system of\r\nregistration. According to the Superintendent of Statistics, it caused an\r\nexcess of 5000 deaths during the six weeks that it lasted, of which about\r\na fourth part only were set down to influenza, and the rest to pneumonia,\r\nbronchitis, asthma, etc. During the three worst weeks it raised the deaths\r\nin the age of childhood 83 per cent., in the age of manhood 104 per cent.,\r\nin old age 247 per cent., whereas the deaths between fifteen years and\r\ntwenty-five were but little raised by it, and those between ten and\r\nfifteen hardly at all. It raised the deaths during six weeks in St\r\nGeorge’s-in-the East to a rate per annum of 73 per 1000 living: in some\r\nother parishes it increased the death-rate very little. But it had the\r\nusual effect of lengthening enormously the obituary columns of the\r\nnewspapers, which shows that it fell, as usual, to a large extent upon the\r\nricher classes. It went all over England in a short time, the month of\r\nDecember being the time of excessive mortality in the towns, according to\r\nthe following sample totals of deaths from all causes:\r\n\r\n1847\r\n\r\n             Manchester   Sheffield     York      Places in\r\n             (Ancoats)     (West)    (Walmgate)   Scotland\r\n\r\n  October       169          27          61          521\r\n  November      135          27          52          728\r\n  December      270          85          99         1001\r\n\r\nIn some parts of England, as in Kendal, a district of Anglesea and in the\r\nIsle of Wight, the mortality of the last quarter of 1847 was actually\r\nlower than that of the year before. From St Albans the sub-registrar\r\nreported that there had been “no epidemic.” In most parts of the country,\r\nincluding the medium-sized towns, the mortality directly or indirectly due\r\nto influenza was lower than in London. The principal returns did not come\r\nin from the country until after the new year, the effects of the epidemic\r\nhaving been, as usual, later in rural districts. Hence, while London had\r\n1253 deaths put down to “influenza” in 1847 (nearly all in December), and\r\n659 in 1848 (nearly all in the first quarter), the rest of England had\r\n4881 influenza deaths before the New Year, and 7963 after it[742]. This\r\ninfluenza in the mid-winter of 1847-8 made a great impression\r\neverywhere[743]. As regards its range and its fatality, it was like those\r\nof 1833 and 1837; and it had once more so much of the catarrhal type, that\r\nthe name of influenza became still more firmly joined to the idea of a\r\nfeverish cold or defluxion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the year 1847, agues had almost ceased to be written of in England,\r\nalthough they still occurred in the Fens. But Peacock begins his account\r\nof the influenza of that winter with an enumeration of prevailing\r\ndiseases, which reads somewhat like an old “constitution” by Sydenham or\r\nHuxham. The summers and autumns of 1846 and 1847, he says, were both\r\nhighly choleraic, and dysentery (as well as enteric fever) was unusually\r\ncommon in the former year. Fatal cases of “ague and remittent fever” were\r\nalso more numerous than usual. Then came much enteric fever, “not\r\nunfrequently complicated with catarrhal symptoms.” Throughout the spring\r\nand early summer of the influenza year, 1847, “intermittent fevers were\r\ncommon, and in March, April and May, purpura was frequently met with,\r\neither as a primary or secondary disease. Scurvy also, owing to the\r\ndeficiency of fresh vegetables, and from the general failure of the\r\npotato crop in the previous year was occasionally seen.” Then follows much\r\nconcerning a fever called remittent, which reads more like relapsing fever\r\nthan anything else[744]. “The remittent form of fever was frequent in the\r\ncourse of the epidemic [of influenza], though seldom registered as the\r\ncause of death.” Peacock says truly that the rather unusual concurrence of\r\nso many sicknesses was “not peculiar to the recent influenza alone;” and\r\nhe can “scarcely refrain from acknowledging that these several affections\r\nare not merely coetaneous but correlative, and types and modifications of\r\none disease, with which they have a common origin. Assuming this inference\r\nto be admitted, we may advance to the solution of the further question of\r\nwhat is the essential nature or proximate cause of the disease.” But the\r\ninquiry led him to no result: the precise cause he leaves “involved in the\r\nobscurity that veils the origin of epidemics generally”--which are surely\r\nnot all equally obscure[745].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInfluenza having continued epidemic for a few weeks in the beginning of\r\n1848, ceased thereafter to attract popular notice in Britain during a\r\nperiod of more than forty years. But a certain number of “influenza”\r\ndeaths continued to appear steadily year after year in the registration\r\ntables. In 1851 this number was nearly doubled, in 1855 it was more than\r\ntrebled; and those two years were undoubtedly seasons (about January and\r\nFebruary) of real influenza epidemics in Europe, recorded by several but\r\nnot by English writers. A slight epidemic was described for Scotland in\r\n1857, and one for Norfolk in 1878, neither of which seems to have\r\ninfluenced the registration returns in an obvious degree. After the\r\nundoubted influenza of 1855, the annual total of deaths in England set\r\ndown to that cause steadily declined from four figures, to three figures,\r\nand then to two figures, standing at 55 in the bill of mortality for 1889.\r\nIt is improbable that those small annual totals of deaths in all England\r\nand Wales were caused by the real influenza; the name at that time was\r\nsynonymous with a feverish cold, and would have been given here or there\r\nto fatalities from some such ordinary cause. An epidemic ague was reported\r\nfrom Somerset in 1858[746].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenzas of 1889-94.\r\n\r\nMore than a generation had passed with little or no word of epidemic\r\ninfluenza in this country, when in the early winter of 1889 the newspapers\r\nbegan to publish long telegrams on the influenza in Moscow, St Petersburg,\r\nBerlin, Paris, Madrid and other foreign capitals. This epidemic wave, like\r\nthose immediately preceding it in the Eastern hemisphere, in 1833, 1837\r\nand 1847, and like one or more, but by no means all, of the earlier\r\ninfluenzas, had an obvious course from Asiatic and European Russia towards\r\nWestern Europe[747]. In due time it reached London, and produced a decided\r\neffect upon the bills of mortality for the first and second weeks of\r\nJanuary, 1890, but a moderate effect compared with that of 1847, which was\r\nthe first to be recorded under the same system of registration. It spread\r\nall over England, Scotland and Ireland in the months of January and\r\nFebruary, 1890, proving itself everywhere a short and sharp influenza of\r\nthe old kind, but with catarrhal symptoms on the whole a less constant\r\nfeature than in the epidemics of most recent memory. At the end of\r\nFebruary it looked as if Great Britain and Ireland had got off lightly\r\nfrom the visitation which had caused high mortalities in many countries of\r\nContinental Europe. But this epidemic in the beginning of 1890 was only\r\nthe first of four, and less severe than the second and third. It returned\r\nin the spring and early summer of 1891, in the first weeks of 1892, and in\r\nthe winter of 1893-94.

All but the second, which\r\nfell in early summer, are strictly comparable as regards season\r\n(mid-winter). But although the second, in 1891, had the advantage of\r\nfalling in some of the healthiest weeks of the year, it was more\r\nprotracted than the original outbreak, much more fatal than it in the\r\narticle influenza, more fatal also in the article pneumonia, and less\r\nfatal only in the article bronchitis. The third outbreak was not only more\r\nprotracted than the first, in the same season of the year, but much more\r\nfatal in all the associated articles. As to the deaths referred to\r\ninfluenza (whether as primary or secondary cause), the numbers are not\r\nstrictly comparable in all the outbreaks; they are probably too few in the\r\nfirst table, more nearly exact in the second, third, and fourth, the\r\ndiagnosis having at length become familiar and the fashion of nomenclature\r\nestablished. It is undoubted that many of the deaths from bronchitis and\r\npneumonia in January, 1890, were due to the epidemic; for, “while the\r\nordinary rise of mortality in cold seasons is mainly among the very aged,\r\nthe increased mortality in this fatal month was mainly among persons\r\nbetween 20 and 60 years” (Ogle).\r\n\r\nWhile the first epidemic of the series was universal and of short duration\r\nall over the kingdom, the second and third were more partial in their\r\nincidence and more desultory or prolonged. The second, which began in Hull\r\n(and at the same time on the borders of Wales), produced the following\r\nhighest weekly death-rates per annum from all causes among 1000 persons\r\nliving:\r\n\r\n_Highest Weekly Death-rates in the Second Influenza._\r\n\r\n1891\r\n\r\n                        Annual death-rate\r\n                            from all\r\n                Week       causes per\r\n               ending     1000 living\r\n\r\n  Hull        Apr. 11        42·5\r\n  Sheffield     May 2        70·5\r\n  Halifax        \"  2        42·1\r\n  Leeds          \"  9        48·5\r\n  Manchester     \"  9        43·6\r\n  Bradford       \" 16        56·7\r\n  Huddersfield   \" 16        54·5\r\n  Leicester      \" 16        44·6\r\n  Oldham         \" 23        50·4\r\n  London         \" 30        28·9\r\n  Salford        \" 30        45·9\r\n  Blackburn    June 6        48·5\r\n\r\nThe third was heard of first in the west of Cornwall and in the east of\r\nScotland, in the last quarter of 1891. It was in the following English\r\ntowns that it produced the maximum weekly death-rates per annum from all\r\ncauses:\r\n\r\n_Highest Weekly Death-rates in the Third Influenza._\r\n\r\n1892\r\n\r\n                             Annual death-rate\r\n                  Week        from all causes\r\n  Town           ending       per 1000 living\r\n\r\n  Portsmouth    Jan. 16           57·0\r\n  London         \"   23           46·0\r\n  Norwich        \"   23           44·7\r\n  Brighton       \"   23           60·9\r\n  Croydon        \"   30           47·2\r\n\r\nThese highest death-rates in the third successive season of influenza were\r\nall in the southern or eastern counties; in the latter, Colchester also\r\nhad a maximum death-rate during one week of about 80 per 1000 per annum.\r\nLiverpool, among the northern great towns, appears to have had most of the\r\nthird influenza. The fourth outbreak, in the end of 1893, was noticed\r\nfirst in the Midlands (Birmingham especially), and was afterwards heard of\r\nin the mining and manufacturing districts of Staffordshire, South Wales,\r\nLancashire, Yorkshire and Durham, as well as in Scotland and Ireland,\r\nLondon, as in the table, having a share of it. The tables given of the\r\nLondon mortality in each of the four outbreaks, from influenza and the\r\nchest-complaints which were its most usual secondary effects, are a fair\r\nindex both of the period and of the severity of the disease all over the\r\nkingdom in each of its successive appearances[748]. Everywhere the first\r\nand the fourth were the mildest, the second and third the most fatal.\r\nDeaths from “influenza” were reported from all the counties of England and\r\nWales in the first and second epidemics, the highest rates of mortality\r\nper 1000 inhabitants in the corresponding calendar years having been in\r\nthe following counties, while in all the counties the greater fatality of\r\nthe second epidemic is equally marked:\r\n\r\n1890\r\n\r\n  Cumberland            ·35\r\n  North Wales           ·28\r\n  Herefordshire         ·28\r\n  Salop                 ·28\r\n  Wilts                 ·28\r\n  Somerset              ·26\r\n  Dorset                ·25\r\n  Bucks                 ·25\r\n\r\n1891\r\n\r\n  Rutland              1·36\r\n  Lincolnshire         1·19\r\n  North Wales          1·09\r\n  Westmoreland         1·02\r\n  Monmouth             1·00\r\n  E. Riding Yorks       ·98\r\n  Herefordshire         ·98\r\n  Northamptonshire      ·95\r\n\r\nIn London the entry of influenza is in the weekly bills of mortality\r\nthroughout the whole period, with the exception of a few weeks; but the\r\ndeaths were often reduced to unity, and there was perhaps only one\r\noccasion, besides the four great outbursts, namely the months of March and\r\nApril, 1893, when cases were so numerous or so close together in\r\nhouseholds or neighbourhoods as to constitute a minor epidemic.\r\n\r\nThe type of the influenza of 1890-93 was not quite the same as on the last\r\nhistorical occasions. When it was announced as approaching from the\r\nContinent, everyone looked for “influenza colds”; but the catarrhal\r\nsymptoms, although not wanting, were soon found to be unimportant beside\r\nthe nameless misery, prostration and ensuing weakness. Some, indeed,\r\ncontended that the disease was not influenza but dengue, so pronounced\r\nwere the symptoms of break-bone fever[749]. Many cases had a decided\r\naguish or intermittent character. The name of ague itself was once more\r\nheard in newspaper paragraphs, and more freely used in private talk; but,\r\nas we have long ceased to write of epidemic agues, equally as of marsh\r\nintermittents, in this country, it is not probable that there will remain\r\nany record of agues in Britain accompanying the influenzas of the years\r\n1890-94. On the other hand the complications and after-effects of our\r\nlatest influenza, more especially as affecting the nervous system, have\r\nbeen very fully studied[750].\r\n\r\nThat which chiefly distinguishes the influenza of the end of the 19th\r\ncentury from all other invasions of the disease is the revival of the\r\nepidemic in three successive seasons, the first recurrence having been\r\nmore fatal than the original outbreak, and the second recurrence more\r\nfatal (in London at least) than the first. The closest scrutiny of the old\r\nrecords, including the series of weekly bills of mortality issued by the\r\nParish Clerks of London for nearly two hundred years, discovers no such\r\nrecurrences of influenza on the great scale in successive seasons. It is\r\ntrue that several of the old influenzas came in the midst of sickly\r\nperiods of two or more years’ duration, such as the years 1557-58,\r\n1580-82, 1657-59, 1678-80, 1727-29 and 1780-85. But in those periods the\r\nbulk of the sickness was aguish, the somewhat definite episodes of\r\ncatarrhal fever having been distinguished from the epidemic agues by\r\nWillis in 1658, by Sydenham in 1679, by several in 1729, and by Baker,\r\namong others, in 1782. It is probable, indeed, that there were two\r\nstrictly catarrhal epidemics in successive years in the periods 1657-59\r\nand 1727-29, just as we know that, in New England, there was a catarrhal\r\nepidemic in the autumn of 1789 and an equally severe influenza, less\r\ncatarrhal in type, in the spring of 1790[751]. But history does not appear\r\nto supply a parallel case to the four successive influenzas in the period\r\n1889-94, unless we count the seasonal epidemic agues of former\r\n“constitutions” as equivalent to influenzas for the purpose of making out\r\na series.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Theory of Influenza.\r\n\r\nInfluenza is not an infection which lends itself to a simple theory of its\r\nnature or a neat formula of its cause. All that one can do is to indicate\r\nthe direction in which the truth lies. Something broad, comprehensive,\r\nsteady from age to age, telluric if not cosmic, must be sought for. Some\r\nhave thought that the legendary or representative universal sickness at\r\nthe siege of Troy was influenza, because it began upon the horses and\r\ndogs, as so many historical influenzas have done. But it will be\r\nsufficient to show that influenza was the same in the Middle Ages as now;\r\nfor what circumstances make a broader contrast than medieval and modern?\r\nThe first writer in England to mention influenza--of course not under that\r\nname--was a dean of St Paul’s in the reign of Henry II., Radulphus de\r\nDiceto[752]. He is narrating the journey to Rome of the archbishop-elect\r\nof Canterbury: his election in England was in June, 1173, he had got as\r\nfar as Placentia by Christmas, whence he turned aside to Genoa, and at\r\nlength reached Rome, to have his election confirmed by the pope in the\r\nnones of April, 1174. It is in the midst of this account of the\r\narchbishop’s journey, that reference is made to an influenza, otherwise\r\nknown, from German and Italian chronicles, to have happened in December,\r\n1173: “In those days the whole world was infected by a nebulous corruption\r\nof the air, causing catarrh of the stomach and a general cough, to the\r\ndetriment of all and the death of many”--_universus orbis infectus ex\r\naeris nebulosa corruptione_. What kind of infection can that be which has\r\nbefallen men on both sides of the Alps within the same short time in the\r\n12th century as in the 19th? And what kind of infection is it which has\r\noutlived so many changes in the great pestilences of mankind, has seen the\r\nextinction of plague and the rise of cholera, and all other variations,\r\nmost of them for the better, in the reigning types of epidemic sickness?\r\nTo have lasted unchanged through so many mutations of things, from\r\nmedieval to modern, and from modern to ultra-modern, and to have become\r\nmore inveterate or protracted at the end of the 19th century than it had\r\never been, is unique in this history. Influenza appears to correspond with\r\nsomething broadly the same in human life at all times. Or is it rather a\r\nthing telluric, of the crust of the earth or the bowels of the earth? Or\r\nis it perhaps cosmic, affecting men as the vintage is affected by a comet,\r\nor as if it came from the upper spheres? My belief is that we need not\r\ntranscend the globe to look for its source, and that, upon the earth, we\r\nneed not go deeper than the surface, nor beyond the inhabited spots. I\r\nshall come back to this from giving the history of English opinion upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe best known influenzas of the 16th century all came in summer, as some\r\nof the later ones have done, so that no one thought of them as exaggerated\r\ncommon colds. But it happened that the influenzas observed by Willis in\r\n1658, and by Sydenham in 1675 and 1679, came in spring or winter and in\r\nsuch weather as to suggest to each of those physicians that the catarrhal\r\nsymptoms corresponded to the season. Robert Boyle, their great\r\nphilosophical contemporary, was also a witness of one or more of these\r\ninfluenzas, and it appeared to him that there was more than season and\r\nweather in them.\r\n\r\n    “I have known a great cold,” he says, “in a day or two invade\r\n    multitudes in the same city with violent, and as to many persons,\r\n    fatal symptoms; when I could not judge (as others also did not), that\r\n    the bare coldness of the air could so suddenly produce a disease so\r\n    epidemical and hurtful; and it appeared the more probable that the\r\n    cause came from under ground, by reason that it began with a very\r\n    troublesome fog[753].”\r\n\r\nI am unable to say whether Boyle was the first to apply the doctrine of\r\ntelluric or subterranean emanations to influenza; he was certainly not the\r\nfirst to apply it to pestilences in general, for it is found in Seneca\r\namong the ancients[754], and it is clearly stated in Ambroise Paré’s essay\r\n“Sur les Venins,” having been probably a familiar notion of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, although a mystical and undefined one. Sydenham also, who must\r\nhave discussed these questions with Boyle, referred all the more obscure\r\nor “stationary” epidemic constitutions to effluvia discharged into the air\r\nfrom “the bowels of the earth”: those hypothetical miasmata were for him\r\nthe τὸ θεῖον of Hippocrates, the mysterious something which had to be\r\nassumed so as to explain plague, pestilential fever, intermittent and\r\nremittent fevers, the “new fever” of 1685-6, and all other epidemic\r\nconstitutions which were not caused by obvious changes of season and\r\nweather. But it does not appear, and it is not probable, that he ascribed\r\nto that mysterious cause the two transient waves of influenza which fell\r\nwithin his own experience, those of November, 1675, and of November, 1679.\r\nOn the other hand, Boyle certainly did so; he included influenza in his\r\nhypothesis explicitly; and if one examines its general terms, it will\r\nappear as if it had been made specially for influenza.\r\n\r\nBoyle’s general expression, for both endemial and epidemic maladies, is\r\nthat they are due to subterranean effluvia sent up into the air. As a\r\nchemist, and as dealing with the new knowledge then most in vogue, he\r\nassumed the sources of these miasmata to be for the most part mineral\r\ndeposits in the crust of the globe, especially “orpimental and other\r\nmischievous fossiles”; but later in his writing he says:\r\n\r\n    “To speak candidly I do not think that these minerals are the causes\r\n    of even all those pestilences whose efficients may come from under\r\n    ground”; there were many mischievous fossils of which physicians and\r\n    even chymists had no knowledge, and “the various associations of\r\n    these, which nature may, by fire and menstruums, make under ground and\r\n    perhaps in the air itself, may very much increase the number and\r\n    variety of hurtful matters.”\r\n\r\nHe makes provision, also, for the hurtful matters multiplying in their\r\nunderground seats, according to a principle which we know now to be true\r\nfor organic, instead of mineral matters, and to be true for them above\r\nground, or in the air, as well as under ground:\r\n\r\n    “I think it possible that divers subterraneal bodies that emit\r\n    effluvia may have in them a kind of propagative or self-multiplying\r\n    power. I will not here examine whether this proceeds from some seminal\r\n    principle, which many chymists and others ascribe to metals and even\r\n    to stones; or (which is perhaps more likely) to something analogous to\r\n    a ferment, such as, in vegetables, enables a little sour dough to\r\n    extend itself through the whole mass, or such as, when an apple or\r\n    pear is bruised in one part, makes the putrefied part by degrees to\r\n    transmute the sound into its own likeness; or else some maturative\r\n    power ... as ananas in the Indies, and medlars ... after they are\r\n    gathered, acquire (as it were spontaneously) in process of time a\r\n    consistence and sweetness and sometimes colour and odour, and, in\r\n    short, such a state as by one word we call maturity or ripeness.”\r\n\r\nOther of Boyle’s fruitful principles (I am separating them out from amidst\r\nmuch other matter not specially related to influenza) are these:\r\n\r\n    “It is possible that these effluvia may be, in their own nature,\r\n    either innocent enough, or at least not considerably hurtful, and yet\r\n    may become very noxious if they chance to find the air already imbued\r\n    with certain corpuscles fit to associate with them.”\r\n\r\n    Again, the effluvia sent up into the air may pass by certain places\r\n    without causing an epidemic, because these “are not inhabited enough\r\n    to make their ill qualities taken notice of; but, more frequently,\r\n    because by being diffused through a greater tract of air, they are\r\n    more and more dispersed in their passage, and thereby so diluted (if I\r\n    may so speak) and weakened as not to be able to do any notorious\r\n    mischief.”\r\n\r\n    Again, the effluvia may not produce epidemic disease at the part of\r\n    the globe where they had emerged from under ground; an illustration of\r\n    which may be intended in the case of the Black Death, which, as he\r\n    says, came from China, yet plague is little heard of in that country,\r\n    a Jesuit, Alexander de Rhodes, who spent thirty years in those parts,\r\n    testifying that the plague is not so much as spoken of there. Again,\r\n    why are some epidemics of so short duration at a given place? Either,\r\n    he answers, because the morbific expiration from under ground had\r\n    ascended almost at once, and been easily spent; or the subterraneal\r\n    commotion which sends up the miasmata “may pass from one place to\r\n    another and so cease to afford the air incumbent on the first place\r\n    the supplies necessary to keep it impregnated with noxious exhalation;\r\n    and it agrees well with this conjecture that sometimes we may observe\r\n    certain epidemical diseases to have, as it were, a progressive motion,\r\n    and leaving one town free, pass on to another”--as notably in the case\r\n    of sweating sickness and influenza.\r\n\r\n    Lastly there are ever new forms of epidemic disease appearing, not to\r\n    count every variation of an autumnal ague “which the vulgar call a New\r\n    Disease.” Of the really new types Boyle offers the following\r\n    explanation: “Some among the emergent variety of exotick and hurtful\r\n    steams may be found capable to disaffect human bodies after a very\r\n    uncommon way, and thereby to produce new diseases, whose duration may\r\n    be greater or smaller according to the lastingness of those\r\n    subterraneal causes that produce them. On which account it need be no\r\n    wonder that some new diseases have but a short duration, and vanish\r\n    not long after their appearing, the sources or fumes being soon\r\n    destroyed or spent; whereas some others may continue longer upon the\r\n    stage, as having under ground more settled and durable causes to\r\n    maintain them.”\r\n\r\nAs a chemist, Boyle sought for the source of the pestilential emanations\r\nin underground minerals, in the new combinations of these under the action\r\nof “fire and menstruums,” in their self-multiplying power as if by\r\nsubterraneous fermentation (“which many chymists and others ascribe to\r\nmetals and even to stones”), and in their meeting with suitable\r\n“corpuscles” in the air of an inhabited spot wherewith to combine for\r\ntheir morbific effects. He assumed, also, their discharge into the air at\r\nparticular spots of the globe (where they might not be directly morbific\r\nin their effects), or in a series of localities from the wave-like\r\nprogress of the underground commotion; in which assumption he seems to be\r\napplying the very old idea of classical times that earthquakes and\r\nvolcanic eruptions were a cause or antecedent of epidemics. Sometimes his\r\nmineral fossils were deep in the crust of the globe, touched only by the\r\ngreater cataclysms; and then we might expect novelties in the forms of\r\nepidemic disease. But he does not exclude emanations from the earth’s\r\nsurface proceeding more gently or insensibly.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to set aside Boyle’s hypothesis of epidemical\r\nmiasmata as made altogether void by his choosing strange minerals to be\r\nthe source of them, and by his assuming a kind of fermentation in these\r\ninorganic matters so as to explain the continuance and spreading of the\r\ninfections. Substitute organic matters in the soil for minerals in the\r\ncrust of the earth, and read a modern meaning into the doctrine of\r\nunderground or aërial fermentation or leavening, and we shall find Boyle’s\r\nhypothesis, especially as applied to influenza, far from obsolete. Some\r\nsuch adaptation of the doctrine of miasmata was made two generations later\r\nby Dr John Arbuthnot in his ‘Essay concerning the Effects of Air upon\r\nHuman Bodies,’ the immediate occasion of which was the London influenza of\r\n1733. There is nothing to note between Boyle and Arbuthnot; for Willis\r\nand Sydenham, using the Hippocratic language of “constitutions,”\r\nexplained, as we have seen, the epidemic catarrhs of the spring or winter\r\nas the reigning febrile constitution modified to suit the season and\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nArbuthnot’s essay makes more modern reading than Boyle’s. He assumes\r\nemanations from the ground, but they are no longer from the bowels of the\r\nearth, or from deposits of strange minerals requiring earthquakes to set\r\nthem free, or “fire and menstruums” to give potency to them. Of all the\r\nthings that pass into the atmosphere, he makes most of the various steams\r\nand other volatile decomposing matters of men and animals; and when he\r\nbrings in the earth, it is as the storehouse or receptacle of such\r\nmatters, in a surface stratum no deeper than the effects of drought and\r\nrainfall could reach. While he accepts the Hippocratic doctrine of\r\nepidemic constitutions, and recognizes the air with its various organic\r\ncontents as the τὸ θεῖον, the _quid divinum_ or mysterious something of\r\nepidemical causation, he does not forget that the earth is inhabited by\r\ncreatures, human and other, who befoul the atmosphere by “their own\r\nsteams”; again, he lays stress upon alternations of drought and moisture\r\nin the soil and subsoil as a cause of morbific emanations, not, indeed,\r\nstating the matters of fact in the very terms of Pettenkofer’s law, but\r\nassuming the presence of special organic matters in the soil as much as\r\nthat does. Although Arbuthnot was hardly a serious epidemiologist, any\r\nmore than Boyle, yet in the growth of opinion on the subject of morbific\r\nmatters in the air, he may be said to have shifted the interest from\r\ninorganic or mineral substances and gases, to organic matters chiefly of\r\nhuman or animal origin, and from the deeper regions of the globe, such as\r\nonly earthquakes reach, to the surface stratum of soil and subsoil which\r\nis affected by every rise and fall of the ground-water. I shall now give a\r\nfew extracts, to bear out the above summary, from Arbuthnot’s essay.\r\n\r\n    “Air,” he says, “is the τὸ θεῖον in diseases, which Hippocrates takes\r\n    notice of. Air is what he means by the powers of the universe, which,\r\n    he says, human nature cannot overcome; and he lays it down as a maxim\r\n    ‘that whoever intends to be master of the art of physick must observe\r\n    the constitution of the year; that the powers and influence of the\r\n    seasons (what are seldom uniform) produce great changes in human\r\n    bodies.’” He then pays a compliment to Sydenham as “endowed with the\r\n    genius of Hippocrates,” and passes on to his own analytic method.\r\n    “Many great effects must follow, and many sudden changes may happen in\r\n    human bodies by absorbing outward air with all its qualities and\r\n    contents. Nothing accounts more clearly for epidemical diseases\r\n    seizing human creatures inhabiting the same tract of earth, who have\r\n    nothing in common that affects them except air: such as that\r\n    epidemical catarrhous fever of 1728 and of this present year\r\n    [1733].... It seems to be occasioned by effluvia, uncommon either in\r\n    quantity or quality, infecting the air.... It is likewise evident that\r\n    these effluvia were not of any particular or mineral nature, because\r\n    they were of a substance that was common to every part of the surface\r\n    of the earth: and therefore one may conclude that they were watery\r\n    exhalations, or, at least, such mixed with other exhalable substances\r\n    that are common to every spot of ground.”\r\n\r\n    In his account of the qualities and contents of the air, he enumerates\r\n    them, not so much as detected in the air on analysis, but as having of\r\n    necessity passed into it, and in some instances been deposited again\r\n    from it, as in strange dews. One class of substances that pass into\r\n    the air are the oils, salts, seeds and insensible abrasions of\r\n    vegetables. Also all excrements and all the carcases of animals vanish\r\n    into air. Another ingredient of the air is the perspirable matters of\r\n    animals, the amount of which for human beings he works out by a\r\n    curious calculation of a column of their own steams raised so many\r\n    feet high in so many days. Perhaps there are insects in the air\r\n    invisible to human eyes: one may observe, in that part of a room which\r\n    is illuminated with the rays of the sun, flies sometimes darting like\r\n    hawks as if it were upon a prey. Some have imagined the plague to\r\n    proceed from invisible insects: this system agrees with many of the\r\n    appearances in the progress or manner of propagation of that disease,\r\n    but is altogether inconsistent with others. Air replete with the\r\n    steams of animals, especially such as are rotting, has often produced\r\n    pestilential fevers in that place: of which there are many instances.\r\n\r\n    But why should certain years or seasons have a pestilential\r\n    atmosphere, for example the season of the catarrhous fever of 1733?\r\n    There had been, he says, an unusual drought for these two years past,\r\n    the best estimate of the dryness of the surface of the earth being\r\n    taken from the falling of the springs, “the consequence of which has\r\n    been unusual diseases amongst several animals, and a great mortality\r\n    amongst mankind. It is true, this did not happen during the dry\r\n    weather.... The previous great drought must have been particularly\r\n    hurtful to mankind. Great droughts exert their effects after the\r\n    surface of the earth is again opened by moisture, and the perspiration\r\n    of the ground, which was long suppressed, is suddenly restored. It is\r\n    probable that the earth then emits several new effluvia hurtful to\r\n    human bodies: this appeared to be the case by the thick and stinking\r\n    fogs which succeeded the rain that had fallen before.”\r\n\r\nArbuthnot knew the progress of the influenza of 1732-33. Its worst week in\r\nLondon was from the 23rd to the 30th January, 1733; but he tells us that\r\nit had been at a height in Saxony from the 15th to the 29th November,\r\n1732, had been earlier in Holland than in England, earlier in Edinburgh\r\nthan in London, in New England before Great Britain. Again, it appeared in\r\nParis in February, somewhat later than in London, and in Naples in March.\r\nThis progress, he says, was often against the wind. Nor does he assume a\r\nprogressive infection of regions of atmosphere. The effluvia, he says,\r\nwere of a substance that was common to every part of the surface of the\r\nearth; they were exhalable substances that were common to every spot of\r\nground; the excessive drought of two years, followed by heavy rains in the\r\nend of 1732, is also assumed to have been common, for, in Germany and\r\nFrance, especially in November, 1732, the air was filled with frequent\r\nfogs. It is clear that Arbuthnot traced the universality of influenza, the\r\nuniform symptoms of which he recognized, to certain conditions of soil and\r\natmosphere common to all the countries visited by the epidemic.\r\n\r\nThroughout the rest of the 18th century there were numerous and varied\r\nexperiences of influenza, in summer and winter, spring and autumn, coming\r\nup from the south as if from Africa, or from the east as if from Central\r\nAsia, or appearing in America sooner than in Europe--experiences which\r\nmade a theory of the disease difficult. Some inclined to Arbuthnot’s view\r\nof unusual seasons and weather producing the same effects everywhere;\r\nothers favoured the hypothesis of contagion from a remote source, which\r\nmight be China or might be some other territory. Geach, a surgeon at\r\nPlymouth who was a Fellow of the Royal Society, actually went back to the\r\nastrological cause, pointing out that Jupiter and Saturn were in a certain\r\nconjunction during the influenza of 1775. The only elaborate theory of the\r\nstrange disease that calls for notice, besides those of Boyle and\r\nArbuthnot, is that of Noah Webster, the famous lexicographer of Hartford,\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\nWhile Webster was a journalist in New York about the years 1794-6, the\r\nsubject of yellow fever, which was then of great practical moment, set him\r\nreading and speculating about pestilences in general. Writing to\r\nPriestley, he said that in the course of his inquiries he found the\r\nAmerican libraries ill supplied with books[755]; but he certainly made\r\ndiligent and skilful use of his literary materials, and produced in his\r\n‘Brief History of Epidemic and Pestilential Diseases,’ a work which was\r\nbetter than any before it in the chronological part, and remains to the\r\npresent time unique in its philosophical part for the boldness of its\r\ngeneralities[756]. He saw that influenza was the crux of epidemiology, and\r\npaid special attention to it.\r\n\r\nIn looking for the antecedents of influenza, he kept in view the greater\r\ntelluric changes and convulsions, such as earthquakes and volcanic\r\neruptions. He did not regard these as the cause of influenza, but as the\r\nindex of some hidden cause to which both they and the universal catarrh\r\nwere due.\r\n\r\n    “It is probable to me,” he says, “that neither seasons, earthquakes,\r\n    nor volcanic eruptions are the causes of the principal derangements we\r\n    behold in animal and vegetable life, but are themselves the _effects_\r\n    of those motions and invisible operations which affect mankind. Hence\r\n    catarrh and other epidemics often appear _before_ the visible\r\n    phenomena of eruptions and earthquakes[757].” As to influenza, he\r\n    found “reason to conclude the disease to be the effect of some access\r\n    of stimulant powers to the atmosphere by means of the electrical\r\n    principle. No other principle in creation, which has yet come under\r\n    the cognizance of the human mind, seems adequate to the same effects.”\r\n\r\n    And again: “It is more probable that it is to be ascribed to an\r\n    insensible action of atmospheric fire, which is more general and\r\n    violent about the time of eruptions, and which fire is probably\r\n    agitated in all parts of the globe, although it produces visible\r\n    effects in explosions in some particular places only.” It is due to\r\n    Webster to give his reason for preferring a physical force to an\r\n    organic poison: “If a deleterious vapour were the cause, I should\r\n    suppose its effects would be speedy, and its force soon expended, the\r\n    atmosphere being speedily purified by the winds. But if stimulus is\r\n    the cause, it may exist for a long time in the atmosphere, and the\r\n    human body not yield to its force in many weeks or months. This would\r\n    better accord with facts. For, although diseases appear soon after an\r\n    earthquake, yet the worst effects are often many months or years\r\n    after[758].”\r\n\r\nDr Blagden also saw a difficulty in “the prodigious quantity of matter\r\nrequired in the air to infect the space not only of the Chinese land, but\r\nto a hundred leagues of the coast, or, as in this instance [1782] all\r\nEurope and the circumjacent sea,” and was accordingly driven to\r\nArbuthnot’s view of an origin in the unusual weather of each locality.\r\n\r\nWebster drew up a chronological table of influenzas in either Hemisphere,\r\nwith the volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, comets, etc., to suit[759]. A\r\nfew instances from near the beginning may serve as samples:\r\n\r\n    1647. First catarrh mentioned in American annals, in the same year\r\n    with violent earthquakes in South America, and a comet.\r\n\r\n    1655. Influenza in America, in the same year with violent earthquakes\r\n    in South America and an eruption of Vesuvius. It began about the end\r\n    of June.\r\n\r\n    1658. Influenza in Europe after a severe winter: the summer cool.\r\n\r\n    1675. Influenza in Europe while Etna was still in a state of\r\n    explosion: the winter mild.\r\n\r\n    1679-80. Influenza in Europe during or just after the eruption of\r\n    Etna: the season wet: a comet.\r\n\r\n    1688. Influenza in Europe in the same year with an eruption of\r\n    Vesuvius, after a severe winter, and earthquakes: it began in a hot\r\n    summer.\r\n\r\n    1693. Influenza in Europe in the same year with an eruption in Iceland\r\n    and great earthquakes: the season cool.\r\n\r\n    1697-98. Influenza in America after a great earthquake in Peru: a\r\n    comet the same year: the winter severe.\r\n\r\nIn most instances the region of the earthquake is not specified in the\r\ntable; but it is sometimes named in the text of the annals under the\r\nrespective years. Volcanoes are on the whole made more of than\r\nearthquakes, Webster’s object being to find evidence of “electrical\r\nstimulus,” and not of material miasmata discharged into the air. Etna and\r\nHecla are much in request. Any earthquake suits, as if “earthquake” and\r\n“volcano” were like algebraic symbols, always _a_ and _b_, and never\r\nanything but _a_ and _b_, “influenza” being always _x_. One begins to\r\nrealize the difficulties of the volcano or earthquake theory of influenza\r\non turning to Mallet’s Catalogue of Earthquakes[760]. Here, indeed, is an\r\nembarrassing choice between China and Peru, Asia Minor and North Africa,\r\nPortugal and Sicily or Calabria, Iceland and Jamaica, the Azores and the\r\nPhilippines, Caracas or Acapulco and Valparaiso, Hungary and Savoy,\r\nKamtschatka and Amboina; between earthquakes great and small; between\r\nearthquakes and volcanoes. Any influenza year might be suited with one or\r\nmore earthquakes, perhaps in either Hemisphere; but there are some long\r\nclear intervals between the greater influenzas in Europe, for example the\r\ninterval from 1803 to 1831, which seem to occupy as many pages of the\r\ncatalogue of earthquakes as the years wherein influenzas came thickest,\r\nfor example from 1729 to 1743, or from 1831 to 1847.\r\n\r\nNone the less, Webster, like Boyle, obeyed a true impulse when he looked\r\nfor the cause of influenzas in something telluric, occasional, phenomenal.\r\nA wave of influenza comes up unexpectedly from a particular point of the\r\ncompass, passes quickly over many degrees of latitude and longitude,\r\nlasting a few weeks at any given place, disappears in the distance, and\r\ndoes not return again perhaps for a whole generation. Influenza has the\r\nqualities of suddenness, swiftness, transitoriness; it has a certain\r\nsameness in its symptoms; it can be identified as certainly in the brief\r\nphrases of medieval chronicles as in elaborate modern descriptions; it has\r\nhad no season for its own, as plague and cholera have had the summer and\r\nautumn, but has reached a height in Europe sometimes in midsummer,\r\nsometimes in midwinter. No other epidemic malady can compare with it in\r\nthese respects; all the rest seem to have been provoked more or less by\r\nthe turns and changes in human affairs, some being of a medieval colour,\r\nothers of a modern, each in its own way admitting of explanation from\r\nunwholesome living, or from famine, or from over-population, or from\r\nsomething more recondite but still within the sphere of things insanitary\r\nin an intelligible sense. Other plagues besides influenza were, it is\r\ntrue, once reckoned mysterious, or associated in the popular mind with\r\nearthquakes and comets. But several such plagues have disappeared from\r\namong us, while their alleged causes, the earthquakes or comets, continue\r\nas before. Influenza alone returns at intervals as of old, untouched by\r\ncivilization, by sanitation, by the immense differences between medieval\r\nand modern, making the same impression upon England in the year 1890 as it\r\ndid in 1173, or 1427, or 1580, or, if changed at all, then changed for the\r\nworse inasmuch as the epidemic came back more severely in 1891, and still\r\nmore severely in 1892. It is not surprising that for such a disease\r\nsomething telluric or even cosmic should have been assigned as the cause,\r\nsomething as occasional as itself, phenomenal, if not cataclysmic. It may\r\nbe proper, therefore, that we should try over again the philosophic\r\ngeneralities of Boyle, Arbuthnot and Webster, peradventure a combination\r\nof them may yield a true theory. From Boyle we may take the great\r\nprinciple of a progressive infection through regions of air (or leagues of\r\nground), which was expressed once for all by Lucretius in the sixth book\r\nof the ‘De Rerum Natura’:\r\n\r\n        ... atque aer inimicus serpere coepit;\r\n  Ut nebula ac nubes paulatim repit, et omne\r\n  Qua graditur, conturbat et immutare coactat;\r\n  Fit quoque ut in nostrum quum venit denique coelum\r\n  Corrumpat reddatque sui simile atque alienum.\r\n\r\nFrom Arbuthnot we may take the organic source and nature of the influenzal\r\nmiasmata, and the association with changes in the level of the water in\r\nthe soil. From Webster we may take the idea that the historic influenzas,\r\nhaving been sudden, occasional or phenomenal, must have had phenomenal\r\ncauses somewhere in either Hemisphere. Instead of sketching a theory in\r\nthe abstract, and safeguarding it by following all its ramifications, I\r\nshall proceed by the way of instances, choosing them so as to bring out\r\nparticular points in order.\r\n\r\nThe only generality which may be indicated at starting is one that has\r\npresented itself time after time in the foregoing history, namely that\r\nthere is something more than accident in the association between epidemics\r\nof influenza and epidemics of ague. So close was this association in\r\nformer times that both the influenza and the widely prevalent ague were\r\nincluded together under such names as “the new ague,” “the new fever,”\r\n“the new distemper.” As late as 1679, Morley did not distinguish the\r\nepidemic of influenza from the epidemic agues in the midst of which it was\r\nset, although the distinction was real, and was actually made by Sydenham\r\non that occasion, as it had been made by Willis and in a manner by\r\nWhitmore on the occasion immediately preceding, and as it was made by\r\neveryone on the last great occasion when an influenza made an interlude\r\namong epidemic agues in the year 1782. It has often been suspected that\r\ninfluenza was related to some other infection: at one time it was taken\r\nfor a volatile emanation of plague, in our own time it has been regarded\r\nas a volatile emanation of Asiatic cholera. In a wider historical view the\r\nquestion may arise, whether the real relation is not rather to those\r\nremarkable agues which have been epidemic in company with influenza when\r\nthere was no plague and no cholera.\r\n\r\nI come now to certain influenzas, as illustrating particular points of\r\ntheory, in order.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Webster’s theory of influenza as related to\r\nearthquakes and volcanoes, first published in 1799, was suggested to him\r\nby a communication to the Royal Society on the volcanic waves seen at\r\nBarbados on the 31st of March, 1761, and on the epidemic of influenza\r\nthereafter ensuing all over the island. At Bridgetown, in the afternoon of\r\nthe 31st of March, 1761, the water in the bay and harbour ebbed and flowed\r\nto the extent of eighteen inches or two feet at intervals of eight\r\nminutes, and continued to do so for the space of three hours, the\r\noscillation regularly decreasing till night when it was no more\r\nobservable. These tidal waves were due to volcanic upheavals somewhere;\r\nand it was found that the centre of disturbance had been in the Atlantic\r\nnear the coast of Portugal, and the time some hours earlier than the waves\r\nwere felt at Bridgetown. The Barbados chronicler proceeds:\r\n\r\n    “It is very remarkable that since that time the island has been in a\r\n    very deplorable condition, having suffered under the severest colds\r\n    that have been ever known. The distress has been so general that I may\r\n    venture to assert (with confidence) that nineteen twentieths of the\r\n    inhabitants of the island have felt the effects of the contagion; and\r\n    to some it has been repeated several times. It has puzzled all the\r\n    adepts in pharmacy to find out the cause and cure of it. One\r\n    favourable circumstance has attended it, viz. few have died with it.\r\n    The Leeward Islands have not escaped, it having raged there more\r\n    violently and more fatal. His Majesty’s ships have severely felt the\r\n    effects of it, some of them not being capable of keeping the seas for\r\n    want of men fit for service. This happening at a season of the year\r\n    remarkably the healthiest, makes it the more surprising[761].”\r\n\r\nThis is as good an instance as we shall find, of explaining something\r\nsudden, swift, and phenomenal, by something else sudden, swift, and\r\nphenomenal, in a purely empirical way and without pausing to ask whether\r\nthe latter could have been a _vera causa_ of the former. That the\r\ninfluenza came to Barbados in the wake, as it were, of the volcanic waves,\r\nhad been a common subject of talk among the residents; and that common\r\nopinion of the colony had found expression in the paper sent to the Royal\r\nSociety. The influenza was not only in Barbados, in the Leeward Islands,\r\nand in the ships on the West Indian Station, but also in New England and\r\n“over the whole country” of the North American Colonies. Dr Tufts, of\r\nWeymouth, New England, wrote to Webster that “it began in April, and in\r\nMay ran into a malignant fever which proved fatal to aged persons. It\r\nspread over the whole country and the West India Islands[762].” It was not\r\nuntil some nine months after that influenza appeared in Europe, at first\r\nin the east of that continent,--Hungary, Vienna, Breslau, Copenhagen--in\r\nFebruary and March, 1762, in central Germany and Scotland in April, in\r\nLondon about the first of May and all over England and Ireland thereafter,\r\nbut not in France until June and July.\r\n\r\nPrecisely the same order was followed by the influenza twenty years after:\r\nit began in North America in March, 1781, and, says Webster, spread over\r\nthat continent; it appeared in the East Indies in October and November,\r\n1781, and on the eastern confines of Europe in January, 1782, having been\r\ntraced from Tobolsk, made a slow progress westwards, and was at its height\r\nin London about the end of May or beginning of June. Assuming, says\r\nWebster, that the American influenza of 1781 had been continuous with the\r\nEuropean of 1782, it must have “passed the Pacific in high northern\r\nlatitudes,” traversed Siberia and Tartary, and so reached Russia in\r\nEurope. In like manner, if the European influenza of 1762 were continuous\r\nwith the American of 1761, it must have made the circuit of the globe in\r\nthe same order, as if it were following the first impulse of the volcanic\r\nwaves across the Atlantic from the coast of Portugal westwards, and so\r\nround the earth until it came back to Europe on its eastern frontier. So\r\nmuch may be fairly advanced on the ground of a particular set of facts.\r\nBut then there were many other facts, both in 1761-62, and in 1781-82.\r\nMeanwhile let us take another instance of volcanic waves felt at Barbados\r\nsix years before, on the same afternoon as the great earthquake of Lisbon.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAt Bridgetown, on the 1st November, 1755, Dr Hillary saw the peculiar flux\r\nand reflux of the water in the harbour from 2.20 p.m. to 9 p.m. and\r\npronounced that there must have been an earthquake somewhere. The waves\r\ncame at first at intervals of five minutes, and at last at intervals of\r\ntwenty minutes. The day was calm, and the ships in the bay were not\r\ntouched; but small craft lying in the channel over the bar were driven to\r\nand fro with great violence. There was no motion of the earth, and no\r\nnoise. The distance from Lisbon was 3400 miles, the vibrations having\r\ntaken seven and a half hours to reach Barbados. The one notable effect in\r\nthe harbour of Bridgetown was that the water flowed in and out with such a\r\nforce that it tore up the black mud in the bottom of the channel, so that\r\na great stench was sent forth and the fishes caused to float on the\r\nsurface, many of them being driven a considerable distance on to the dry\r\nland where they were taken up by the negroes[763].\r\n\r\nIt so happened that there was an epidemic catarrh prevalent at that very\r\ntime all over the island of Barbados, chiefly among children, few or none\r\nof whom, white or black, escaped it. It had begun in October, says\r\nHillary[764] (who chronicled the epidemiology very exactly), and continued\r\ninto November, so that it both preceded and followed the great convulsion\r\nin the bed of the Atlantic, which destroyed Lisbon and tore up the mud in\r\nthe harbour of Bridgetown, disengaging a great stench therefrom and\r\npoisoning the fish. Webster’s theory of a relation between earthquakes and\r\ninfluenzas provides for such discrepancies in the dates of each: it is\r\nprobable, he says, that seasons, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are\r\nthemselves the effects of those motions and invisible operations which\r\naffect mankind, so that catarrh and other epidemics often appear _before_\r\nthe visible phenomena of eruptions and earthquakes. In like manner, the\r\nchronicler of the earthquake of Lisbon in the _Philosophical Transactions_\r\ndrew attention to the fact that there had been a remarkable drought for\r\nseveral years before, and that some of the springs near Lisbon were\r\nactually dried up at the time. That droughts precede earthquakes is\r\nperhaps the most instructive generality that has yet been reached as to\r\nthe cause of the latter.\r\n\r\nLet us see, then, whether any such remote antecedents, in a possible\r\nrelation to the influenza epidemics, hold good for the island of Barbados.\r\nHillary’s chronicle is sufficiently full to let us answer the question.\r\n\r\n    Following the seasons and prevalent maladies backwards from the\r\n    influenza of children in October-November, 1755, we find a catarrhal\r\n    fever all over Barbados in February of the same year, which “few\r\n    escaped having more or less of.” The immediate precursor of that\r\n    influenza had been a very definite constitution, eighteen months long,\r\n    of a “slow nervous fever,” from February, 1753 to September, 1754,\r\n    which corresponds in every respect to the “remittent” fever of nearly\r\n    the same period in England and Ireland, described by Fothergill,\r\n    Rutty, Huxham and Johnstone, and to the famous Rouen fever described\r\n    by Le Cat. Hillary is clear that the “slow nervous fever” was not seen\r\n    again so long as he remained in the colony (1758). Just before it\r\n    began, there had been an influenza so general in December, 1752, and\r\n    January, 1753, “that few people, either white or black, escaped having\r\n    it,” and that, in turn, was preceded by a season of agues, which, says\r\n    Hillary, “are never seen in Barbados now [1758], unless brought hither\r\n    from some place of the Leeward Islands.”\r\n\r\nSo many influenzas in Barbados, and so many things possibly relevant to\r\nthem among their antecedents. So also in New England, the influenza which\r\nseemed to follow the earthquake along the coast of Portugal on the 31st\r\nof March, 1761, had the same remittent and intermittent fevers among its\r\nantecedents.\r\n\r\n    In the winter and spring of 1760-61 there had been much fever in New\r\n    England, which was believed to be malarious. Webster, however, says:\r\n    “There is no necessity of resorting to marsh exhalations for the\r\n    source of this malady. The same species of fever [as at Bethlem]\r\n    prevailed in that winter and the spring following in many other parts\r\n    of Connecticut where no marsh existed. In Hartford it carried off a\r\n    number of robust men, in two or three days from the attack.... In\r\n    North Haven it attacked few persons, but everyone of them died. In\r\n    East Haven died about forty-five men in the prime of life, mostly\r\n    heads of families. The same disease prevailed in New Haven among the\r\n    inhabitants and students in college.” In Bethlem the sickness began in\r\n    November, 1760, and carried off about forty of the inhabitants in the\r\n    winter following. This was the fever, generally reckoned malarious,\r\n    which preceded the influenza of April and May, 1761[765].\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe next great influenza, twenty years after, which was in America in the\r\nspring of 1781 and in Europe in the winter and spring following, will\r\nrepay the same kind of scrutiny. There had been influenza here or there in\r\nEurope since the beginning of 1780, but no great epidemic of it; and in\r\nEngland, as elsewhere, there had been epidemic agues and dysenteries since\r\nthat year, or the autumn before. The epidemic agues became worse in\r\nEngland in 1783, 1784, and 1785, appearing in places which had never been\r\nthought malarious. The whole period from 1780 to 1784 was remarkable for\r\nhot and dry summers and great earthquakes. Italy and Sicily were troubled\r\nby earthquakes to an unusual extent in 1780, 1781, 1782, and 1783; they\r\nwere so frequent in 1781 that the pope ordered public prayers. The great\r\nearthquake of the period was in Calabria at half an hour after noon of the\r\n5th of February, 1783, about six months after the great influenza of the\r\nperiod was over. Sir William Hamilton, the British ambassador at Naples,\r\nvisited the numerous scenes of the earthquake in Calabria and Sicily in\r\nthe first fortnight of May, 1783, and sent to the Royal Society an account\r\nof what he saw. At several places he found fever epidemic, part of it from\r\nthe overcrowding and filth of the temporary barracks in which the people\r\nwere living, part of it malarious from the damming of water by changes in\r\nthe river beds. At Palmi the spilt oil mixed with the corn of the\r\noverthrown granaries, and the corrupted bodies, had a sensible effect on\r\nthe air, which threatened an epidemic; at the village of Torre del\r\nPezzolo an epidemical disorder had already manifested itself[766].\r\n\r\nBut the most striking effect of the earthquake was that a dry fog began in\r\nCalabria in February, and overspread until autumn the greater part of\r\nEurope, extending even to the Azores. This fog, though not consisting\r\napparently of moisture, was so dense that the sky was quite obscured,\r\nappearing a light grey colour instead of blue, while the sun became a\r\nblood-red disc. In Calabria the darkness was so great that lights were\r\nneeded in the houses, and ships came into collision at sea. There was a\r\nmost disagreeable odour[767]. The fog spreading over all Europe from\r\nCalabria was not at all mythical, as we are apt to suppose that similar\r\nrecorded phenomena of the wonder-loving Middle Ages may have been. The\r\nphenomenon was independently reproduced in Iceland the same year, from the\r\n1st to the 11th of June, causing the same darkness at sea, the same\r\natmospheric effects at a distance, but not to so great a distance, and\r\nsome amount of sickness, but seemingly not aguish or febrile, among the\r\npopulation[768].\r\n\r\nThose two great convulsions of the year 1783, each of them the cause of a\r\nwidely spreading dry fog, may have been conceivably the cause of\r\npestiferous miasmata in the air, such as the corresponding hypothesis of\r\ninfluenza requires; but how little comparable or equivalent were the\r\nmiasmata--in the one case from the ancient and well-peopled soil of\r\nSouthern Italy, in the other from the inhospitable Danish colony just\r\nwithout the Arctic Circle! In any case, the earthquakes of 1783 were both\r\ntoo late for the great influenza of the period. The antecedent common\r\nalike to the influenza and the earthquakes was the extraordinary droughts,\r\nwhich caused famine and famine-fever in Iceland, and, according to old\r\nexperience, was probably related to the epidemic prevalence of agues in\r\nBritain and on the continent of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nWhat kind or kinds of epidemic sickness earthquakes may produce as an\r\neffect immediate and at the place, will appear from other instances. One\r\nof the most remarkable of earthquakes was that which destroyed Port Royal\r\nand nearly all the planters’ houses and sugar-works throughout the island\r\nof Jamaica on the 7th of June, 1692. Jamaica had been an English colony\r\nfor little more than thirty years, during which time it had passed from\r\nits state of lethargy under the Spaniards into an emporium of commerce\r\nwith a rapidly growing population of slaves and whites. The business\r\ncapital was at Port Royal, wholly built since the British occupation. The\r\nsite of it was a sandy key or shoal which was said to have risen\r\nperceptibly within the memory of original settlers; a writer in September,\r\n1667, said of it: “wherever you dig five or six feet, water will appear\r\nwhich ebbs and flows as the tide. It is not salt, but brackish[769].” A\r\nquay had been built along this spit of land, at which vessels of 700 tons\r\ncould lie afloat. It was here that the havoc of the earthquake was most\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nSloane, who had visited Jamaica a few years before, said that the\r\ninhabitants expect an earthquake every year, and that some of them were of\r\nopinion that they follow their great rains[770]. The year 1692 began in\r\nJamaica with very dry and hot weather which continued until May: then came\r\ngales and heavy rains until the end of the month, and from that time until\r\nthe day of the earthquake, the 7th of June, the weather was excessively\r\nhot, calm and dry. The shakes began at 11.40 a.m., and at the third shake,\r\nthe ground of nearly all Port Royal fell in suddenly, so that in the\r\ncourse of a minute or two most of the houses were under water and the\r\nwhole wharf was covered by the sea to the depth of several fathoms. The\r\nloss of life was, of course, greatest where population was densest; but in\r\nthe interior of the island the effects on the soil were greater than at\r\nthe shore: in the north a thousand acres of land sank and thirteen people\r\nwith it; mountains on either side of a narrow gorge came together and\r\nblocked the way; wide chasms appeared in the ground, and on one mountain\r\nside there were some dozen openings from which brackish water spouted\r\nforth. The first effect in the streets of Port Royal was that men and\r\nwomen seemed all at once to be floundering up to the neck in the wet\r\nshifting sand, and were speedily drowned or floated away by the inrushing\r\nwater. The shakes ceased for days at a time, and then began again, five or\r\nsix perhaps in twenty-four hours; so that those who had escaped to ships\r\nin the bay remained on board for two months, being afraid to come ashore.\r\nThe weather was hotter after the earthquake than before, and mosquitoes\r\nswarmed in unheard of numbers.\r\n\r\nDuring the upheavals or subsidences in Port Royal, and the rushing of\r\nwater into or from the gapings in the ground, “ill stenches and offensive\r\nsmells” arose, so that “by means of the openings and the vapours at that\r\ntime belcht forth from the earth into the air, the sky, which before was\r\nclear and blue, was in a minute’s time become dull and reddish looking (as\r\nI have heard it compared often) like a red-hot oven.” A very great\r\nmortality followed among those who had escaped the earthquake. Some of\r\nthem settled at Leguanea, others at the place on the bay which became the\r\nKingston of later history, enduring many hardships in their hastily built\r\nshelters, from the heavy rains that followed the earthquake, and from want\r\nof clothes, food and comforts.\r\n\r\n    One writes: “Our people settled a town at Leguanea side; and there is\r\n    about five hundred graves already [20th September, 1692], and people\r\n    every day is dying still. I went about once to see it, and I had like\r\n    to have tipt off.” Another says: “Almost half the people that escaped\r\n    upon Port Royal are since dead of a malignant fever”: and another,\r\n    referring to the hasty settlement on the bay at Kingston, says “they\r\n    died miserably in heaps.” But the most interesting information is his\r\n    next sentence: “Indeed there was a general sickness (supposed to\r\n    proceed from the hurtful vapours belched from the many openings of the\r\n    earth) all over the island, so general that few escaped being sick:\r\n    and ’tis thought it swept away in all parts of the island three\r\n    thousand souls, the greatest part from Kingstown, only yet an\r\n    unhealthy place[771].”\r\n\r\nThat great mortality from a malignant fever after the earthquake of 7th\r\nJune, 1692, is usually counted an epidemic of the yellow fever which\r\nbecame established at Kingston and Port Royal from that time for at least\r\na century and a half. I have not found any contemporary medical account of\r\nit, but all the later writers on yellow fever at Kingston and Port Royal\r\nhave accepted the tradition that it was yellow fever. But there was one\r\npeculiarity, which marks it off from all subsequent epidemics of yellow\r\nfever--the sickness was all over the island, so general that few escaped\r\nbeing sick, and was supposed to proceed from the hurtful vapours belched\r\nfrom the many openings of the ground in and near Port Royal. In all\r\nsubsequent experience yellow fever has been almost confined to the shore\r\nor to the ships in the bay[772]. Certainly it has never been all over the\r\nisland as in 1692, “so general that few escaped being sick”: that is\r\nrather in the manner of influenza, although there is nothing to show that\r\nthe sickness of the interior was so different from that of the shore as to\r\nbe counted an influenza, or that the mortality of the sick was other than\r\nthat of a “malignant fever.”\r\n\r\nThe earthquake at Port Royal in 1692 produced “ill stenches and offensive\r\nsmells.” The tidal waves, or the subterranean vibrations which caused\r\nthem, in tearing up the mud at the bottom of the channel at Bridgetown,\r\nBarbados, in 1755, had in like manner sent forth a great stench which\r\npoisoned the fish. Such offensive vapours were supposed in former times to\r\ncome, as in a figure, from “the bowels of the earth”; and undoubtedly the\r\nsulphurous fumes which have overhung the region of Sicilian earthquakes\r\nmust have had a source as deep as the strange minerals or “fossils” of\r\nBoyle’s hypothesis. But, while the commotion of an earthquake is deep, it\r\nis also superficial; whatever miasmata issue from the ground in the\r\nordinary alternations of wet and drought, would be discharged into the\r\natmosphere in unusual quantity and with unusual force in such disturbances\r\nof soil as sunk Port Royal in 1692 or were felt at Barbados across the\r\nwhole width of the Atlantic in 1755. Nor is that effect upon miasmata\r\ninstantaneous or quickly past; in Jamaica the rumblings and shakes lasted\r\nfor nearly two months, during which time the pressure upon the gases in\r\nthe subsoil must have been such as to make them pass into the atmosphere\r\nin stronger ascending currents than the mere alternations of moisture and\r\ndrought would have done. And just as the ordinary seasonal changes in the\r\nlevel of the ground-water are of little or no account for\r\nmiasmatic-infective disease unless the soil in which they occur be full of\r\norganic impurities from human occupancy, so one may reason that the great\r\ncataclysmic changes of the earth’s crust are, in this hypothesis of\r\ninfluenza, of most account as touching the stratum of soil wherein lie\r\norganic impurities, and as touching those areas of the surface,--the sites\r\nof cities, the populous plains, the shores of bays, the bottoms of\r\nharbours or any other definite spots--in which the products of organic\r\ndecomposition are present in largest amount and, perhaps, of somewhat\r\nspecial kind. Such impurities of the soil are indeed a _vera causa_ of\r\ninfective disease, known to be capable of the effect which has to be\r\naccounted for; and, as discharged into the air in great volume and with\r\ngreat force by some upheaval, they would make a local beginning of that\r\n“aer inimicus” which the Roman poet figures as creeping like a mist from\r\none region of the heavens to another so that it corrupts each successive\r\ntract of air with its own baleful qualities, “reddatque sui simile atque\r\nalienum.”\r\n\r\nBut, as soon as we begin to apply this formula to particular historic\r\ncases, difficulties and ambiguities arise[773]. To come back to the\r\ninstance of Jamaica in 1692, did the general sickness of the island,\r\nmanifestly miasmatic as it was, and due to disturbances of soil, become an\r\ninfluenza for other regions of the globe? About fifteen months after there\r\nwas, indeed, a universal catarrh in Britain and Ireland, of no great\r\nfatality, which is said by Molyneux, of Dublin, to have prevailed also in\r\nthe northern parts of France, Flanders, and Holland, but is not reported\r\nin the usual way from Europe generally nor from America. Let us suppose a\r\nmiasmatic cloud formed over the island of Jamaica in June, July, August\r\nand September, a cloud of infective particles which might produce\r\ninfluenza at a distance from its place of origin, whatever disease the\r\nmiasmata after the earthquake may have produced in Jamaica itself. Let\r\nthis invisible cloud, or emanation, get into the warm atmosphere over the\r\ngreat oceanic current that sets out from the Gulf of Mexico. The vehicle\r\nlies ready to hand,--to receive the miasmata not far from their place of\r\norigin, to carry them far into the Atlantic, and to bring them, perhaps,\r\nto the shores of Britain. This may seem a sufficiently plausible source of\r\nthe influenza of October and November, 1693, which appears to have been\r\nfelt only in the British Isles and on the opposite shores of the North\r\nSea. But Webster’s own choice is the volcanic eruption in Iceland in the\r\nsame year as the influenza; and if we prefer, in this hypothesis, an\r\nearthquake to an active volcano, there is a rival source for the British\r\ninfluenza of 1693, nearer both in place and time than that of Jamaica in\r\n1692, and not less important in respect of miasmatic disease in its own\r\nlocality. This was the disastrous series of earthquakes in Calabria and\r\nSicily, culminating on the 9th of January, 1693. The following extracts\r\nfrom the account sent to the Royal Society will show how great was the\r\ncommotion of soil, of underground water, and of atmosphere, and how close\r\nthe connexion of these with the sickness ensuing[774]:\r\n\r\n    “In the plain of Catania, an open place, it is reported that from one\r\n    of the clefts in the ground, narrow but very long and about four miles\r\n    off the sea, the water was thrown forth altogether as salt as that of\r\n    the sea, [as in Jamaica the year before]. In Syracuse and other places\r\n    near the sea, the waters in many wells, which at first were salt, are\r\n    become fresh again.... The fountain Arethusa for the space of some\r\n    months was so brackish that the Syracusans could make no use of it,\r\n    and now that it is grown sweeter the spring is increased to near\r\n    double. In the city of Termini all the running waters are dried up....\r\n    It was contrary with the hot-baths, which were augmented by a third\r\n    part.\r\n\r\n    Darkness and obscurity of the air has always been over us, but still\r\n    inferior to that on the 10th and 11th of January; and often these\r\n    clouds have been thin and light, and of a great extent, such as the\r\n    authors call _rarae nubeculae_. The sun often and the moon always\r\n    obscured at the rising and setting, and the horizon all day long\r\n    dusky....\r\n\r\n    The effects it has had on humane bodies (although I do not believe\r\n    they have all immediately been caused by the earthquake) have (yet)\r\n    been various: such as foolishness (but not to any great degree),\r\n    madness, dulness, sottishness, and stolidity everywhere:\r\n    hypochondriack, melancholick and cholerick distempers. Every-day\r\n    fevers have been common, with many continual and tertian: malignant,\r\n    mortal and dangerous ones in a great number, with deliria and\r\n    lethargies. Where there has been any infection caused by the natural\r\n    malignity of the air, infinite mortality has followed. The smallpox\r\n    has made great destruction among children.”\r\n\r\nThus we find in Sicily a great disturbance of soil followed, as in\r\nJamaica, by a great increase of local sickness, and by an atmosphere\r\nvisibly charged with products of the earthquake for months after. This is\r\na nearer source than the Jamaican for the British influenza of Oct.-Nov.\r\n1693,--nearer in time, if that be any advantage for the theory, nearer\r\nalso in place. There are, however, no intermediate stages to connect the\r\ninfluenza on the northern edge of the European continent with the\r\ndisturbance of soil and the miasmata arising therefrom in Sicily and\r\nCalabria. If there had been any such dry fog as spread all over Europe\r\nfrom the Calabrian earthquake of January, 1783, it would have been a help\r\nat least to the imagination in bridging over a gulf of space and time.\r\n\r\nAs to the interval of time, it should at all events be kept in mind that\r\nthe same difficulty has to be reckoned with in any hypothesis of influenza\r\nand in every great historic instance. In the instance still before us, the\r\ninfection began in England, according to Molyneux, in October, 1693, and\r\nwas in Dublin a month later. But we must assume it to have been in the air\r\nfor some time before it became effective upon mankind. Influenza has been\r\nobserved, with curious uniformity, to attack the horses, say of London, of\r\nPlymouth, of Edinburgh, or of Dublin (as on the occasion before this,\r\n1688) two months or more in advance of the inhabitants of the respective\r\nplaces; and if it had waited, so to speak, for two months before it showed\r\nits effects upon men, it may have waited equally long, or longer, before\r\nit showed its effects upon horses. That would give at least four months;\r\nand then we know, from such an influenza as that of 1743, that there may\r\nbe weeks, perhaps months, between its prevalence in Naples, Rome or Milan,\r\nand its prevalence in London or Edinburgh, and, from the influenza of 1693\r\nitself, that it was a month later in Dublin than in London. An earthquake\r\nin Sicily on the 9th of January, 1693, with effects there for months after\r\nupon the water, the air, and the prevalent diseases, is not excluded by\r\nlapse of time from being a _vera causa_ of an influenza in England in\r\nOctober of the same year, and in Ireland in November. The sort of proof\r\nwhich most men desire, a proof such as we rarely get, and one that is\r\nsuspiciously neat when we do get it, would be to find an influenza in\r\nSicily and Calabria following the earthquake, and to trace the same step\r\nby step over Europe. But the miasmatic sickness in the countries of the\r\nearthquakes was not influenza, so far as is known; and there was no\r\nepidemic catarrh, so far as is known, in any other part of Europe but the\r\nBritish Isles and the neighbouring shores of the North Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nMolyneux, who recorded with a good deal of circumstance the influenza of\r\n1693, is the principal authority, along with Dr Walter Harris, of London,\r\nfor another influenza in 1688, seemingly peculiar to the British Isles.\r\nIts effects can be discovered with the utmost certainty in the London\r\nbills of mortality for two or three weeks at the end of May and beginning\r\nof June, and it is mentioned as “the new distemper” in letters of the\r\ntime. Is it possible to find an earthquake for it? Webster’s note is: “in\r\nthe same year with an eruption of Vesuvius, after a severe winter and\r\nearthquakes”--which is somewhat general. Turning to Evelyn’s diary, where\r\nthese matters are often recorded, we find, in the very weeks when the\r\ninfluenza was at a height in London, this entry: “News arrived of the most\r\nprodigious earthquake that was almost ever heard of, subverting the city\r\nof Lima and country in Peru, with a dreadfull inundation following it”--as\r\nif the influenza and the news of the earthquake had reached London at the\r\nsame time. This was the earthquake of 20th October, 1687, which destroyed\r\nLima, Callao and an immense district along the coast of Peru. The rocking\r\nof the earth was most violent, the sea retreated like a sudden immense ebb\r\nand filled again like a sudden immense flood, the effect of the commotion\r\nbeing felt on board ships a hundred and fifty leagues out in the Pacific.\r\nIt was remarked that wheat and barley would not thrive in Peru after that\r\nearthquake[775]. Here was undoubtedly a great disturbance of soil and of\r\nsubsoil, almost certainly attended with the discharge of effluvia or\r\nmiasmata into the air, as in other great earthquakes. But the universal\r\nslight fever of the British Isles in the months of June and July, 1688, is\r\nremote from the earthquake of Lima in place; and, if it be a question of\r\nearthquakes at all, there are others nearer to it both in place and time,\r\nsuch as that in the Basilicata province of Naples in January, 1688, and\r\nthe Jamaica earthquake, felt through all the island, on the 1st of March,\r\n1688. The greatest of them all, that of Smyrna, on the 10th of July, was a\r\nfew weeks too late for the hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nA continent so subject to earthquakes as South America might be expected,\r\nin this hypothesis, to have had some corresponding influenzas. It has\r\nindeed had influenzas, some of them peculiar to itself. The Western\r\nHemisphere as a whole has, on several great occasions, had influenzas\r\nwhich were not felt in the Old World. Again, there are one or two\r\ninstances in which the infection, while it spread widely over the\r\ntable-lands of Bolivia and Peru, does not appear by existing testimony to\r\nhave been carried north of the Isthmus. One of these was the influenza of\r\n1720, as special to a region of South America as that of 1688 was to the\r\nBritish Isles. The account of it was given in an essay by Botoni ‘On the\r\nCirculation of the Blood,’ published at Lima in 1723[776]. He calls it\r\n_catarro maligno_; it was popularly known as _fierro chuto_ or “iron cap.”\r\nIt appeared at Cuzco in the end of March, or beginning of April, 1720, and\r\nwas over about November. Four thousand are said to have died of it in the\r\ndiocese of Cuzco, and it is said to have made so great a scarcity of hands\r\nthat the first harvest after it was imperfectly gathered. It had all the\r\nmarks of an influenza, with the addition of bleeding from the nose and\r\nlungs. It had also the grand characteristic common to influenza and\r\nepidemic ague: “the symptoms were so diverse and even contradictory that\r\nno correct diagnosis, or curative plan, could be fixed.” The Lima writer\r\nof 1723 says that it followed an eclipse of the sun on the 15th of August,\r\n1719, having begun on the eastern side of the Andes, in the basin of La\r\nPlata, about that time, and travelled northwards and westwards, as the\r\nSouth American influenza of 1759 did.\r\n\r\nThis is a localized influenza in a country of earthquakes. But the two\r\ngreat earthquakes in 1719 are not South American. They both happened in\r\nJuly: one along the coast of Fez and Morocco, which ruined many villages\r\nand a part of the city of Morocco (there is also a later disturbance in\r\nthe Azores in December, followed by the upheaval of a new island), the\r\nother in North China. Here we have the choice of following the “aer\r\ninimicus” of Lucretius either from China or from the African coast; and if\r\nit be the case that the influenza began in the latter part of the year\r\n1719 in the basin of the La Plata, to cross the Andes next year, it may\r\nseem, in this hypothesis, that a course from east to west, bringing the\r\ninfection across the Atlantic from Africa, is to be preferred to a course\r\nfrom west to east, bringing it across the Pacific from North China. In\r\neither case there need be no difficulty in finding local clouds of\r\nmiasmata. Some traces of the corresponding great earthquake in China were\r\nfound in November of the following year, by Bell, an English traveller who\r\ncrossed from Moscow to Peking:\r\n\r\n    “Jumy,” he says, “suffered greatly by the earthquakes that happened in\r\n    the month of July the preceding year [1719], above one half of it\r\n    being thereby laid in ruins. Indeed more than one half of the towns\r\n    and villages through which we travelled this day had suffered much on\r\n    the same occasion, and vast numbers of people had been buried in the\r\n    ruins. I must confess it was a dismal scene to see everywhere such\r\n    heaps of rubbish[777].”\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric effects of Chinese earthquakes have been pictured since\r\nmedieval times, in obviously superstitious colours; and there are reasons\r\nwhy a great disturbance of soil in that country should produce remarkable\r\nmiasmata. The surface soil of China is peculiar in having the bodies of\r\nthe dead dispersed at large in it, insomuch that excavations for the\r\nfoundations of houses, or for roads and railway cuttings, can hardly be\r\nmade without the constant risk of exposing graves[778].\r\n\r\nIf the soil of China is peculiar in one way, that of the West Coast of\r\nAfrica is peculiar in another. Without entering on the large question of\r\n“malaria” in each of them, I shall take an old illustration of the\r\nmiasmata of the West Coast of Africa as a cause of dengue-fever, a\r\ndisease curiously like influenza in its symptoms, and like it also in its\r\noccasional wave-like dispersion over wide regions. The authority is Dr\r\nAubrey, who resided many years on the coast of Guinea, saw much of the\r\nslave-trade, and wrote a very sensible book in 1729, called ‘The Sea\r\nSurgeon, or the Guinea Man’s Vade Mecum.’ He describes quite clearly the\r\nfever which was long after described by West Indian physicians as dengue,\r\nor three-days’ fever, or break-bone fever, including in his description\r\nthe characteristic exanthems of it and the penetrating odour of the sweat.\r\nHe gives also, in clinical form, a series of cases on board the galley\r\n‘Peterborough’ in December, 1717, which are exquisite examples of\r\nbreak-bone fever. This disease, he says, “many times runs over the whole\r\nship, as well negroes as white men, for they infect one the other, and the\r\nship is then in a very deplorable condition unless they have an able man\r\nto take care of them.” But the original source of infection, he believed,\r\nwas the fogs that hung at nightfall over the estuaries of the rivers; and\r\nhe gives an experimental proof, remarkable but not quite incredible, of\r\nthe poisonous nature of the miasmata:\r\n\r\n    “But to let you see the evil, malevolent, contagious, destructive\r\n    quality of those fogs that fall there in the night, and how far they\r\n    are inimical to human nature, I will tell you of an experiment of my\r\n    own. I made a lump of paste with oat-meal somewhat hard, and about the\r\n    bigness of a hen’s egg, which was exposed to the fog from twilight to\r\n    twilight, i.e. from the dusk of the evening till daybreak in the\r\n    morning; after which I crumbled it, and gave it to fowls, which we had\r\n    on board, and soon after they had eaten it, they turned round and in a\r\n    kind of vertigo dropt down and expired.”\r\n\r\nA great mortality in Guinea in 1754 or 1755 was ascribed by Lind, the\r\nleast credulous in such matters, to “a noxious stinking fog[779].”\r\n\r\nWhat the alternations of heat and chill, of moisture and drought, produce\r\nordinarily in the way of miasmata, the same, we may suppose, is produced\r\non the great scale, as a phenomenon at some particular time and place, by\r\none of those cataclysms which break the surface of the earth or the bed of\r\nthe sea, lower or raise the level of wells and springs, and fill the air\r\nwith particles of dust or vapour which may overhang the locality for\r\nmonths and visibly disperse themselves to a great distance. Nothing\r\nrelating to miasmata in the air need be hard for belief after the\r\nwonderful diffusion and permanence in the atmosphere of the whole globe,\r\nfor two years or more, of finely divided particles shot up by the\r\nearthquakes and eruptions of Krakatoa in the Straits of Sunda on the 27th\r\nand 28th of August, 1883[780].\r\n\r\nA theory of influenza constructed from such generalities as those of\r\nBoyle, Arbuthnot and Webster will have attractions for many over the\r\ntheory that influenza is always present in some remote country and becomes\r\ndispersed now and then over the world by contagion from person to person:\r\nit will have superior attractions, for the reason that influenza is a\r\nphenomenal thing which needs a phenomenal cause to account for it. But if\r\nanyone were to attempt to fit each historic wave of influenza with its\r\nparticular earthquake, or to find the precise locality where clouds of\r\ninfective matter had arisen, or the particular circumstances in which they\r\narose, he would certainly find his fragile structure of probabilities\r\npulled to pieces by the professed discouragers and depravers. I make no\r\nsuch attempt; but I am not the less persuaded of the direction in which\r\nthe true theory of influenza lies.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluenza at Sea.\r\n\r\nThere is no point more essential to a correct theory of influenza than to\r\nfind out in what circumstances it has occurred among the crews of ships on\r\nthe high seas. If it be true that a ship may sail into an atmosphere of\r\ninfluenza, just as she may sail into a fog, or an oceanic current, or the\r\ntrack of a cyclone, then the possible hypotheses touching the nature,\r\nsource, and mode of diffusion of influenza become narrowed down within\r\ndefinite limits.\r\n\r\n    One of the first observations was made in the case of a Scotch vessel\r\n    in the influenza of 1732-33[781]. The epidemic was earlier in Scotland\r\n    than in England; it began suddenly in Edinburgh on 17 December, 1732,\r\n    the horses having been attacked with running of the nose towards the\r\n    end of October. About the time when the disease began among mankind,\r\n    in December, a vessel, the ‘Anne and Agnes’ sailed from Leith for\r\n    Holland. One sailor was sick on this voyage. She sailed on the return\r\n    voyage to Leith, with the other ten of her crew in perfect health.\r\n    Just as she made the English coast at Flamborough Head on the 15th of\r\n    January, 1733, six of the sailors fell ill together, two more the next\r\n    day, and one more on the day after that, so that when the vessel\r\n    anchored in Leith Roads there was only one man well, and he fell ill\r\n    on the day following the arrival. The symptoms were the common ones of\r\n    the reigning epidemic. The dates are not given more precisely or fully\r\n    than as above. Influenza was prevalent in Germany and Holland somewhat\r\n    earlier than in Scotland or England; the men may, of course, have\r\n    imbibed the infection when they were in the Dutch port, just as it is\r\n    almost certain that the crews of Drake’s fleet in 1587 had received\r\n    during a ten days’ stay upon the island of St Jago, of the Cape de\r\n    Verde group, the miasmatic infection of which they suddenly fell sick\r\n    in large numbers together in mid-Atlantic some six days after sailing\r\n    to the westward.\r\n\r\nThis early case of the ‘Anne and Agnes’ in 1733 may pass as an ambiguous\r\none. The next occasion when influenza on board ship attracted much notice\r\nwas the epidemic of 1782.\r\n\r\n    On the 6th of May, Admiral Kempenfelt sailed from Spithead with seven\r\n    ships of the line and a frigate, on a cruize to the westward; on the\r\n    18th May, he came into Torbay, and sailed again soon after; on the\r\n    30th May he came again into Torbay with eight sail of the line and\r\n    three frigates, and on 1 June sailed again to the westward. Sometime\r\n    before his squadron put into Torbay for the second time, influenza had\r\n    appeared among them at sea, it is said in the ‘Goliath’ on the 29th of\r\n    May[782]. A letter from Plymouth, of the 2nd June, after referring to\r\n    the violence of influenza in that town, at the Dock, and on board the\r\n    men-of-war lying there, says that the ‘Fortitude’ of 74 guns, and\r\n    ‘Latona’ frigate came in that afternoon with 250 sick men from the\r\n    fleet under Admiral Kempenfelt, mostly with fevers. Another Plymouth\r\n    letter two days later (4 June) says: “Kempenfelt is returning to\r\n    Torbay: he could keep the sea no longer, on account of the sickness\r\n    that rages on board his fleet. More than 400 men have been brought to\r\n    the hospital this morning. Our men drop down with it by scores at a\r\n    time. The ‘Latona’ frigate, that sailed the other day is returned, the\r\n    officers being the only hands that could work the ship[783].”\r\n\r\nThis outbreak on board ships in the Channel was fully as early as the\r\ngreat development of influenza in 1782 on shore, whether in London or\r\nPlymouth; but there were almost certainly cases of it at the latter port\r\nbefore the ‘Latona’ sailed to join Kempenfelt’s squadron. Robertson,\r\nhowever, who was surgeon on the ‘Romney’ in the Channel service at that\r\ntime, says that “hundreds in different ships, towns, and counties, which\r\nhad _no_ communication with one another, were seized nearly as suddenly\r\nand so nigh the same instant as if they had been electrified.... The\r\ncompanies of many of the ships were very well at bed-time, and in the\r\nmorning there were hardly enough able to do the common business of the\r\nship[784].” This is confirmed by McNair, surgeon of the ‘Fortitude,’ who\r\ntold Trotter that two hundred of her men, as she lay in Torbay, were\r\nseized in one night and were unable to come on deck in the morning[785].\r\n\r\nThere was another English fleet in the North Sea at the same time, under\r\nLord Howe, watching the Dutch fleet or seeking to intercept the Dutch East\r\nIndiamen.\r\n\r\n    Howe sailed from St Helen’s on the 9th May, with twelve ships of the\r\n    line. Towards the end of that month he had his fleet in the Texel; the\r\n    men were in excellent health, “when a cutter arrived from the\r\n    Admiralty, and the signal was given for an officer from each ship [to\r\n    come on board the admiral]. An officer was accordingly sent with a\r\n    boat’s crew from every vessel, and returned with orders, carrying with\r\n    them also, however, the influenza”--which soon prostrated the crews to\r\n    the same extraordinary extent as in the ships under Kempenfelt at the\r\n    other end of the Channel. This was the oral account given to Professor\r\n    Gregory of Edinburgh, by a lieutenant on board a sixty-four gun\r\n    ship[786]. Another account says that the disorder first appeared in\r\n    Howe’s fleet on the Dutch coast about the end of May, on board the\r\n    ‘Ripon,’ and in two days after in the ‘Princess Amelia’; other ships\r\n    of the same fleet were affected with it at different periods, some\r\n    indeed, not until their return to Portsmouth about the second week of\r\n    June. “This fleet, also, had no communication with the shore until\r\n    their return to the Downs, on their way back to Portsmouth, towards\r\n    the 3d and 4th of June[787].”\r\n\r\nBut, apart from the story of the Admiralty despatch-boat carrying the\r\ninfluenza to Howe’s squadron, it appears that both Kempenfelt and Howe\r\nwere joined from time to time by additional ships, which might have\r\ncarried an atmosphere of influenza with them[788]. Still, it was an\r\ninfluenza atmosphere that they had carried, and not merely so many sick\r\npersons. The doctrine of contagion from person to person would have to be\r\nso widened as to become meaningless, if all those experiences of the fleet\r\nin 1782 were to be brought within it. In the history both of sweating\r\nsickness and of influenza, there are instances of the disease breaking out\r\nsuddenly in a place after someone’s arrival; but the new arrival may not\r\nhave had the disease, it was enough that he came from a place where the\r\ndisease was[789]. That was, perhaps, the reason why Beddoes, in his\r\ninquiry of 1803, framed one of his questions so as to elicit information\r\nabout the dispersal of influenza by _fomites_.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to prove that a ship may meet with an atmosphere of\r\ninfluenza on the high seas; but many have believed that ships have done\r\nso. Webster says: “The disease invades seamen on the ocean in the same\r\n[western] hemisphere, when a hundred leagues from land, at the same time\r\nthat it invades people on shore. Of this I have certain evidence from the\r\ntestimony of American captains of vessels, who have been on their passage\r\nfrom the continent to the West India Islands during the prevalence of this\r\ndisease[790].” There are several instances of this, authenticated with\r\ntimes, places, and other data of credibility.\r\n\r\n    The best known of these is the voyage of the East Indiaman ‘Asia’ in\r\n    September, 1780, through the China Sea from Malacca to Canton: “When\r\n    the ship left Malacca, there was no epidemic disease in the place;\r\n    when it arrived at Canton it was found that at the very time when they\r\n    had the _Influenza_ on board the Atlas (_sic_) in the China seas, it\r\n    had raged at Canton with as much violence as it did in London in June,\r\n    1782, and with the very same symptoms[791].”\r\n\r\nIn the present century, the cases nearly all come from the medical reports\r\nof the navies of Great Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands, and\r\nthey relate to ships on foreign service--in the East Indies, the Pacific,\r\nAfrica, or other foreign stations. In some of the instances influenza went\r\nthrough a ship’s company in port or in a roadstead, others are examples of\r\noutbreaks at sea:\r\n\r\n    1837: “The ship’s company of the ‘Raleigh,’ were attacked by epidemic\r\n    catarrh--influenza--first in March, while at sea between Singapore and\r\n    Manilla, and again, although less severely, in June and July while on\r\n    the coast of China.... Influenza also made its appearance amongst the\r\n    crew of the ‘Zebra’ in April while she lay at Penang; it was supposed\r\n    to have been contracted by infection from the people on shore, as they\r\n    were then suffering from it. No death occurred under this head[792].”\r\n\r\n    1838: In the ‘Rattlesnake,’ at Diamond Harbour, in the Hooghly River,\r\n    a large proportion of the men were suffering from epidemic catarrh.\r\n    Intermittent fever made its appearance; “the change from the catarrhal\r\n    to the febrile form was sudden and complete, the one entirely\r\n    superseding the other[793].”\r\n\r\n    1842: In the ‘Agincourt’ on a voyage from the Cape of Good Hope to\r\n    Hongkong in August and September, the greater part of 102 cases of\r\n    catarrh occurred; many of these were accompanied with inflammation of\r\n    tonsils and fauces, and in some there was deafness with discharge from\r\n    the ear. This is not claimed as an instance of epidemic influenza, but\r\n    as an aggregate of common colds, due to cold weather in the Southern\r\n    Ocean and to wet decks[794].\r\n\r\n    1857: “Influenza broke out in the ‘Monarch’ while at sea, on the\r\n    passage from Payta [extreme north of Peru] to Valparaiso. She left the\r\n    former place on the 23d August, and arrived at the latter on the last\r\n    day of September. About the 12th of the month [twenty days out], the\r\n    wind suddenly changed to the south-west, when nearly every person in\r\n    the ship began to complain of cold, although the thermometer did not\r\n    show any marked change in the temperature. On the 12th and 13th seven\r\n    patients were placed on the sick list with catarrhal symptoms; and\r\n    during the following ten days, upwards of eighty more were added, but\r\n    by the end of the month the attacks ceased. [She carried 690 men, and\r\n    had 191 cases of “influenza and catarrh,” in the year 1857.] Some of\r\n    the cases were severe, ending either in slight bronchitis or\r\n    pneumonia, accompanied with great prostration of the vital powers. On\r\n    the arrival of the ship at Valparaiso, the surgeon observes: ‘We found\r\n    the place healthy, but in the course of a few days some cases of\r\n    influenza made their appearance, and very soon afterwards the disease\r\n    extended over the whole town. It was generally believed that we\r\n    imported it, and the authorities took the trouble to send on board a\r\n    medical officer to investigate the matter.’ He further observes that\r\n    the whole coast, from Vancouver’s Island southward to Valparaiso was\r\n    visited by the epidemic.” It made its appearance on board the\r\n    ‘Satellite’ at Vancouver’s Island in September, and among the\r\n    residents ashore, both on the island and mainland, at the same\r\n    time[795].\r\n\r\n    1857: Catarrh “assumed the form of influenza in the ‘Arachne’ [149\r\n    men, 114 cases] while the vessel was cruizing off the coast of Cuba,\r\n    with which, however, she had no communication. There was nothing in\r\n    the state of the atmosphere to attract special attention. A question\r\n    therefore arises whether it might not have been caused by infection\r\n    wafted from the shore.” It was prevalent at the time at Havana[796].\r\n\r\n    1857: “Australian Station:--An eruption of epidemic catarrh occurred\r\n    in the ‘Juno’ [200 men, 131 cases], but long after she left the\r\n    station[797].”\r\n\r\n    Whilst the influenza was on the American Pacific coast in September,\r\n    1857, it was on the coast of China three months earlier--on board the\r\n    ‘Inflexible’ at Hongkong on the 18th of May, and in the ‘Amethyst’ and\r\n    ‘Niger’ in a creek near Hongkong early in June[798]. But it had been\r\n    on the Pacific coast of South America the year before, according to\r\n    the following:\r\n\r\n    “1856: Epidemic catarrh broke out in the ‘President’ when lying off\r\n    the island of San Lorenzo in the bay of Callao, first on the 20th\r\n    October, and the last cases were placed on the sick list on 1st\r\n    November,--the usual period which influenza takes to pass through a\r\n    frigate ship’s company. About sixty required to be placed on the sick\r\n    list.” It had occurred on board English ships of war at Rio de\r\n    Janeiro, on the other side of the continent, some two months before,\r\n    in August, 1856[799].\r\n\r\n    1863: The following, in the experience of the French navy, has been\r\n    elaborately recorded[800]: The frigate ‘Duguay-Trouin’ left Gorée,\r\n    Senegambia, for Brest, in February. There were no cases of influenza\r\n    in Gorée when she left; but four days out, an epidemic of influenza\r\n    began on board, the weather being fine and the temperature genial at\r\n    the time. Another French frigate, which had left Gorée, on the same\r\n    voyage to Brest, two days earlier, did not have a single case.\r\n\r\nThe following instance, here published for the first time, belongs to the\r\nmost recent pandemics of influenza, 1890-93. It relates to only a single\r\ncase of influenza, in the captain of a merchantship; it would have been a\r\nmore satisfactory piece of evidence, if there had been several cases in\r\nthe ship; but among the comparatively small crew of a merchantman, the\r\nsame groups of cases are not to be looked for that we find on board\r\ncrowded men of war; and in this particular case the only other occupants\r\nof the quarter-deck were the first mate and the steward.\r\n\r\n    The ship ‘Wellington,’ sailed from the Thames, for Lyttelton, New\r\n    Zealand, on the 19th December, 1891. The epidemic of influenza in\r\n    London in that year had been in May, June and July; the mate of the\r\n    ‘Wellington’ had had an attack of it ashore, on that occasion, but not\r\n    the captain nor the steward. On the 2nd of March, 1892, when\r\n    seventy-four days out and in latitude 42° S., longitude 63 E., near\r\n    Kerguelen’s Land, the captain began to have lumbago and bilious\r\n    headaches, for which he took several doses of mercurial purgative\r\n    followed by saline draughts. The treatment at length brought on\r\n    continual purging, which, together with three days’ starving from the\r\n    22nd to the 24th of March, caused him a loss of weight of eight\r\n    pounds. The navigation had meanwhile been somewhat difficult and\r\n    anxious, owing to a long spell of easterly head winds. Quite suddenly,\r\n    on the 26th March, when the ship was in latitude 44 S., longitude 145\r\n    E., or about two hundred miles to the south of Tasmania, he had an\r\n    aguish shake followed by prolonged febrile heat, which sent him to his\r\n    berth. The symptoms were acute from the 26th to the 30th\r\n    March,--intense pain through and through the head, as if it were being\r\n    screwed tight in an iron casing, pain behind the eyeballs, a\r\n    perception of yellow colour in the eyes when shut, a feeling of\r\n    soreness all over the body, which he set down at the time to his\r\n    uneasy berth while the ship was ploughing through the seas at about\r\n    twelve knots, and a pulse of 110. The head pains were by far the worst\r\n    symptom, and were so unbearable as to make the patient desperate. This\r\n    acute state lasted for four days, and suddenly disappeared leaving\r\n    great prostration behind. The captain, who had long experience with\r\n    crews and passengers, and a considerable amateur knowledge of\r\n    medicine, summed up his illness as a bilious attack, passing into\r\n    “ague” with “neuralgia of the head.” While the acute attack lasted the\r\n    ship had covered the distance from Tasmania to the southern end of New\r\n    Zealand, and on the 31st of March the captain by an effort came on\r\n    deck to navigate the vessel in stormy weather up the coast to\r\n    Lyttelton, which was reached on the 2nd of April. The pilot coming on\r\n    board found the captain ill in his berth, and on being told the\r\n    symptoms, at once said, “It is the influenza: I have just had it\r\n    myself.” The doctor who was sent for found the captain “talking\r\n    foolishly,” as he afterwards told him, and had him removed to the\r\n    convalescent home at Christchurch, where he remained a fortnight\r\n    slowly regaining strength. The doctor[801] could find no other name\r\n    for the illness but influenza, although he had not supposed such a\r\n    thing possible in mid-ocean. They had just passed through an epidemic\r\n    of it in New Zealand, and it is reported about the same time in New\r\n    South Wales, afterwards in the Tonga group, and still later in the\r\n    summer in Peru. The symptoms of this case are sufficiently\r\n    distinctive: the intense constricting pain of the head is exactly the\r\n    “_fierro chuto_” or “iron cap” of South American epidemics; the pain\r\n    in the eyeballs, the soreness of the limbs and body, and the\r\n    unparalleled depression and despair, are the marks of influenza\r\n    without catarrh. The patient was of abstemious habits, and had made\r\n    the same voyage year after year for a long period without any illness\r\n    that he could recall. He had reduced himself by purging and starving,\r\n    on account of a bilious attack during a fortnight of foul winds from\r\n    the eastward, and had doubtless become peculiarly susceptible of the\r\n    influenza miasm before the ship came into the longitude of Tasmania on\r\n    the 26th March.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influenzas of Remote Islands.\r\n\r\nThe full and correct theory of influenza will not be reached by the great\r\npandemics only. On the other hand some very localized epidemics may prove\r\nto be signal instances for the pathology, although they do not bear upon\r\nthe source of the great historic waves of influenza. The instances in view\r\nare the influenzas started among a remote community on the arrival of\r\nstrangers in their ordinary health. This phenomenon has been known at the\r\nisland of St Kilda, in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, since the year\r\n1716, when it was recorded in the second edition of an essay upon the\r\nisland by Martin. Some thought these “strangers’ colds” mythical, so much\r\nso that Aulay Macaulay, in preparing a work upon St Kilda, was advised to\r\nleave them out; he declined to do so, and Dr Johnson commended him for his\r\nmagnanimity in recording this marvel of nature. There is now no doubt\r\nabout the fact. H.M.S. ‘Porcupine’ visited the island in 1860; a day or\r\ntwo after she sailed again, the entire population, some 200 souls, were\r\nafflicted with “the trouble,” and another visitor, who landed ten days\r\nafter the ‘Porcupine’s’ visit, saw the epidemic of influenza in progress.\r\nThe same thing happened in 1876, on the occasion of the factor landing,\r\nand again in 1877 on the occasion of a crew coming ashore from a wrecked\r\nAustrian ship. A medical account of this epidemic catarrh was given in\r\n1886: The patient complains of a feeling of tightness, oppression and\r\nsoreness of the chest, lassitude in some cases, pains in the back and\r\nlimbs, with general discomfort and lowness of spirits. In severe cases\r\nthere is marked fever, and great prostration. A cough ensues, at first\r\ndry, then attended with expectoration, which may go on for weeks[802].\r\n\r\nIn the remote island of Tristan d’Acunha, in the South Atlantic midway\r\nbetween the River Plate and the Cape of Good Hope, the same thing happens\r\n“invariably” on the arrival of a vessel from St Helena[803]. It is\r\nreported also as a common phenomenon of the island of Wharekauri, of the\r\nChatham Group, about 480 miles to the eastward of New Zealand. Residents,\r\nboth white and coloured, suddenly fall into an illness, one symptom of\r\nwhich is that they feel “intensely miserable.” It lasts acutely for about\r\nfour days, and gradually declines. It resembles influenza in all respects,\r\nand is known by the name of _murri-murri_, which is curiously like the old\r\nEnglish name of _mure_ or _murre_. “The mere appearance of murri-murri is\r\nproof to the inhabitants, even at distant parts of the island, which is\r\nthirty miles long, that a ship is in port, insomuch that, on no other\r\nevidence, people have actually ridden off to Waitangi to fetch their\r\nletters[804].”\r\n\r\nAbout equally distant in the Pacific from Brisbane, as Wharekauri from\r\nChristchurch, lies Norfolk Island, originally colonized by the mutineers\r\nof the ‘Bounty.’ A writer in a newspaper says:\r\n\r\n    “During a seven years’ residence in Norfolk Island, I had\r\n    opportunities of verifying the popular local tradition that the\r\n    arrival of a vessel was almost invariably accompanied by an epidemic\r\n    of influenza among the inhabitants of the island. In spite of the\r\n    apparent remoteness of cause and effect, the connexion had so strongly\r\n    impressed itself on the mind of the Norfolk Islanders that they were\r\n    in the habit of distinguishing the successive outbreaks by the name of\r\n    the vessel during whose visit it had occurred[805].”\r\n\r\nSomething similar has long been known in connexion with the Danish trade\r\nto Iceland, the first spring arrivals from the mother country bringing\r\nwith them an influenza which the crews did not suffer from during the\r\nvoyage, nor, in most cases, during the progress of the epidemic in\r\nReikjavik. The experience at Thorshaven, in the Faröe Islands, has been\r\nthe same[806].\r\n\r\nThese are important indications for the pathology of influenza in general.\r\nThey point to its inclusion in that strange class of infections which fall\r\nmost upon a population, or upon those orders of a population, who are the\r\nleast likely to breed disease by anything that they do or leave undone.\r\nVeterinary as well as human pathology presents instances of the\r\nkind[807]. In seeking for the source of such an infectious principle, we\r\nare not to look for previous cases of the identical disease, but for\r\nsomething else of which it had been an emanation or derivative or\r\nequivalent, something which may have amounted to no more than a disparity\r\nof physical condition or a difference of race. And as the countries of the\r\nglobe present now as formerly contrasts of civilized and barbarous, nomade\r\nand settled, rude and refined, antiquated and modern, with the aboriginal\r\nvarieties of race, it may be said, in this theory of infection, that mere\r\njuxtaposition has its risks. But, in the theory of influenza, the first\r\nrequisite is an explanation of its phenomenal uprisings and wave-like\r\npropagation, at longer or shorter intervals, during a period of many\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSMALLPOX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of smallpox in Britain is that of a disease coming gradually\r\ninto prominence and hardly attaining a leading place until the reign of\r\nJames I. In this respect it is unlike plague and sweating sickness, both\r\nof which burst upon the country in their full strength, just as both made\r\ntheir last show in epidemics which were as severe as any in their history.\r\nIn the former volume of this work I have shown that smallpox in the first\r\nTudor reigns was usually coupled with measles, that in the Elizabethan\r\nperiod the Latin name _variolae_ was rendered by measles, and that\r\nsmallpox, where distinguished from measles, was not reputed a very serious\r\nmalady[808]. From the beginning of the Stuart period, smallpox is\r\nmentioned in letters, especially from London, in such a way as to give the\r\nimpression of something which, if not new, was much more formidable than\r\nbefore; and that impression is deepened by all that is known of the\r\ndisease later in the 17th century, including the rising figures in the\r\nLondon bills of mortality.\r\n\r\nAn early notice of a particular outbreak of smallpox is found in the Kirk\r\nSession records of Aberdeen in 1610, under the date of 12 August: “There\r\nwas at this time a great visitation of the young children with the plague\r\nof the pocks[809].” In 1612 there are various references to deaths from\r\nsmallpox in London in rich houses. In 1613, the Lord Harrington, who is\r\nsaid in a letter of Dr Donne’s to be suffering from “the pox and measles\r\nmingled,” died of smallpox (probably haemorrhagic) on the Sunday before 3\r\nMarch, at which date also the Lady Burghley and two of her daughters were\r\nsick of the same disease. Those two years were probably an epidemic\r\nperiod. Another epidemic is known from a letter of December, 1621: “The\r\nsmallpox brake out again in divers places, for all the last hard winter\r\nand cool summer, and hitherto we have had no sultry summer nor warm winter\r\nthat might invite them. The Lord Dudley’s eldest son is lately dead of\r\nthem, and the young Lady Mordaunt is now sick.” On 28 January, 1623, “the\r\nspeech that the smallpox be very rife there [Newmarket] will not hinder\r\nhis [James I.’s] journey.” The years 1623 and 1624 were far more\r\ndisastrous by the spotted fever all over England; but smallpox attended\r\nthe typhus epidemic, as it often did in later experience, the two together\r\nhaving “taken away many of good sort as well as mean people.”\r\n\r\nThe first epidemic of smallpox in London, from which some figures of the\r\nweekly mortalities have come down, was in 1628: this was the year before\r\nthe Parish Clerks began to print their annual bills, but they had kept the\r\nreturns regularly since 1604, and appear to have made known in one way or\r\nanother the weekly mortality and the chief diseases contributing thereto.\r\nThe smallpox deaths in London in the week ending 24 May, 1628, were\r\nforty-one, in the following week thirty-eight, and in the third week of\r\nJune fifty-eight[810]. Such weekly mortalities in a population of about\r\n300,000 belong to an epidemic of the first degree; and it is clear from\r\nletters of the time that the London smallpox of 1628 made a great\r\nimpression. Lord Dorchester, in a letter of 30 August, calls it “the\r\npopular disease[811].” Several letters relating to a fatal case of\r\nsmallpox in June in the house of Sir John Coke in the city (Garlick Hill)\r\nbear witness to the dread of contagion through all that circle of\r\nsociety[812]. One of the letters may be cited:\r\n\r\n    “It pleased God to visit Mrs Ellweys [Coke’s stepdaughter] with such a\r\n    disease that neither she nor any other of her nearest and dearest\r\n    friends durst come near her, unless they would hazard their own\r\n    health. The children and almost all our family were sent to Tottenham\r\n    before she fell sick, and blessed be God are all in health. Mrs\r\n    Ellweys was sick with us of the smallpox twelve days or thereabouts.”\r\n    Before she was out of the smallpox, she was taken in labour on 15\r\n    June, and died the next morning at five o’clock, being buried the same\r\n    night at ten, with only Sir Robert Lee and his lady of her kindred at\r\n    the funeral. The letter proceeds: “God knows we have been sequestered\r\n    from many of our friends’ company, who came not near us for fear of\r\n    infection, and indeed we were very circumspect, careful, and unwilling\r\n    that any should come to us to impair their health.” Lady Coke was\r\n    fearful to go to Tottenham because of the children who had been\r\n    removed thither.\r\n\r\nAll the indications, whether from letters of the time, from poems and\r\nplays, or from statistics, point to the two first Stuart reigns as the\r\nperiod when smallpox became an alarming disease in London among adults and\r\nin the upper class. The reference to smallpox at Aberdeen in 1610 is to\r\nthe disease among children; and so also is an unique entry, opposite the\r\nyear 1636, on the margin of the register of Trinity parish, Chester: “For\r\nthis two or three years, divers children died of smallpox in\r\nChester[813].” In London, the disease had not yet settled down to that\r\nsteady prevalence from year to year which characterized it after the\r\nRestoration. On the other hand, the periodic epidemics were very severe\r\nwhile they lasted. The epidemic of 1628 was followed by three years of\r\nvery slight smallpox mortality in London; then came a moderate epidemic in\r\n1632 and a severe one in 1634, with again two or more years of comparative\r\nimmunity, as in the following table from the earliest annual printed\r\nbills:\r\n\r\n_Smallpox deaths in London, 1629-36_[814].\r\n\r\n            Smallpox     Deaths from\r\n  Year       deaths      all causes\r\n\r\n  1629         72           8771\r\n  1630         40          10554\r\n  1631         58           8532\r\n  1632        531           9535\r\n  1633         72           8393\r\n  1634       1354          10400\r\n  1635        293          10651\r\n  1636        127          23359\r\n\r\nFor the next ten years, 1637-46, the London figures are lost[815],\r\nexcepting the plague-deaths and the totals of deaths from all causes, but\r\nit is known from letters that there was a great epidemic of smallpox in\r\none of them, the year 1641: the deaths were 118 in the week ending 26\r\nAugust, and 101 in the week ending 9 September[816], totals seldom reached\r\na century later, when the population had nearly doubled. In those weeks of\r\n1641, it was second only to the plague as a cause of dread, and was, along\r\nwith the latter, the reason that “both Houses grow thin,” for all the\r\npolitical excitement of the time. The next London epidemic was in 1649,\r\nwhen the annual bill gives 1190 deaths from smallpox. Willis says that the\r\nepidemic was also at Oxford that year, not so very extensive, “yet most\r\ndied of it” owing to the severe type of the disease[817]. Five years\r\nafter, in 1654, “at Oxford, about autumn, the smallpox spread abundantly,\r\nyet very many escaped with them.” The London deaths from smallpox for a\r\nseries of years were as follows:\r\n\r\n            Smallpox\r\n  Year       deaths\r\n\r\n  1647        139\r\n  1648        401\r\n  1649       1190\r\n  1650        184\r\n  1651        525\r\n  1652       1279\r\n  1653        139\r\n  1654        832\r\n  1655       1294\r\n  1656        823\r\n  1657        835\r\n  1658        409\r\n  1659       1523\r\n  1660        354\r\n  1661       1246\r\n\r\n\r\nSmallpox after the Restoration.\r\n\r\nThe period which must now concern us particularly, from the Restoration\r\nonwards, opens with two deaths from smallpox in the royal family within a\r\nfew months of the return of the Stuarts. When Charles II. left the Hague\r\non 23 May, 1660, to assume the English crown, his two brothers, the Duke\r\nof York and the Duke of Gloucester, accompanied him in the fleet. In the\r\nfirst days of September, the Duke of Gloucester was seized at Whitehall\r\nwith an illness of which various accounts are given in letters of the\r\ntime[818]. On 4 September, “the duke hath been very sick, and ’tis thought\r\nhe will have the smallpox.” On the 8th “the doctors say it is a disease\r\nbetween the smallpox and the measles; he is now past danger of death for\r\nthis bout, as the doctors say”; or, by another account, “the smallpox come\r\nout full and kindly, and ’tis thought the worst is past.” On the 11th the\r\nduke is “in good condition for one that has the smallpox.” But a day or\r\ntwo afterwards his symptoms took an unfavourable turn; the doctors left\r\nhim, apparently with a good prognosis, one evening at six o’clock, but\r\nshortly after he bled at the nose three or four ounces, then fell asleep,\r\nand on awaking passed into an unconscious state, in which he died. When\r\nhis body was opened, the lungs were full of blood, “besides three or four\r\npints that lay about them, and much blood in his head, which took away his\r\nsense.” Pepys says his death was put down to the great negligence of the\r\ndoctors; and if we can trust a news-letter of the time, their negligence\r\nwas such as would have been now approved, for “the physicians never gave\r\nhim anything from first to last, so well was he in appearance to\r\neveryone[819].” Three days after his funeral, the king and the Duke of\r\nYork went to Margate to meet their sister, the princess Mary of Orange, on\r\nher arrival from the Hague. Her visit to the Court extended into the\r\nwinter, and about the middle of December she also took smallpox, of which\r\nshe died on the 21st. Pepys, dining with Lady Sandwich, heard that “much\r\nfault was laid upon Dr Frazer and the rest of the doctors for the death of\r\nthe princess.” Her sister, the princess Henrietta, who had come on a visit\r\nto Whitehall with the Queen-mother in October, was removed to St James’s\r\non 21st December, “for fear of the smallpox”; but she must have been\r\nalready sickening, for on the 16th January it is reported that she “is\r\nrecovered of the measles.”\r\n\r\nThese deaths at Whitehall of a brother and sister of Charles II. happened\r\nin the autumn and winter of 1660; but it was not until next year that the\r\nsmallpox rose to epidemic height in London, the deaths from it having been\r\nonly 354 in 1660, rising to 1246 in 1661, and 768 in 1662. In 1661 it\r\nappears to have been epidemic in other parts of England: Willis, who was\r\nthen at Oxford, says that smallpox began to rage severely before the\r\nsummer solstice (adding that it was “a distemper rarely epidemical”), and\r\nthere are letters from a squire’s wife in Rutlandshire to her husband in\r\nLondon, which speak of the disease raging in their village in May and\r\nJune[820].\r\n\r\nThere was much fever of a fatal type in London in 1661, which is more\r\nnoticed than smallpox itself in the diary of Pepys. The town was in a very\r\nunhealthy state; and it would have been in accordance with all later\r\nexperience if the “pestilential constitution” of fevers, which continued\r\nmore or less until the plague burst forth in 1665, had been accompanied by\r\nmuch fatal smallpox. The occasion was used by two medical writers to\r\nremark upon the fatality of smallpox as something new. The second of the\r\ntwo essays (1663), was anonymous, and bore the significant title of\r\n_Hactenus Inaudita_, the hitherto unheard of thing being that smallpox\r\nshould prove so fatal as it had been lately. The author adopts the dictum\r\nof Mercurialis, with which, he says, most men agree: “Smallpox and measles\r\nare wont for the most part to terminate favourably”; and he makes it clear\r\nin the following passage that the blame of recent fatalities was laid,\r\njustly or unjustly, at the door of the doctors, as, indeed, we know that\r\nit was from the gossip of Pepys:\r\n\r\n    “And I know not by what fate physicians of late have more lost their\r\n    credit in these diseases than ever: witness the severe judgment of the\r\n    world in the cases of the Duke of Gloucester and the Princess Royal:\r\n    so that now they stick not to say, with your Agrippa, that at least in\r\n    these a physician is more dangerous than the malady[821].”\r\n\r\nThe other essay was by one of the king’s physicians, Dr Tobias Whitaker,\r\nwho had attended the Court in its exile at St Germain and the Hague. He\r\nwas by no means an empiric, as some were whom Charles II. delighted to\r\nhonour; and, although he protests warmly against the modish injudicious\r\ntreatment of smallpox by blooding and cooling, he has little of the\r\nrecriminating manner of the time, which Sydenham used from the one side\r\nand Morton from the other. He is, indeed, all for moderation: “upon this\r\nhinge of moderation turneth the safety of every person affected with this\r\ndisease.” His moderation is somewhat like that of Sir Thomas Browne (whose\r\ncolleague he may have been for a few years at Norwich), and is apt to run\r\ninto paradox. In 1634 he wrote in praise of water, including the waters of\r\nspas and of the sea, and in 1638 he wrote with even greater enthusiasm in\r\npraise of wine[822]. He says of his “most learned predecessor” at Court,\r\nHarvey, that his demonstration of the circular motion of the blood was a\r\nfarther extension of what none were ignorant of “though not expert in\r\ndissection of living bodies.” On his return to London in 1660, he seemed\r\nto find as great a change in smallpox as in the disposition of the people\r\ntowards the monarchy. His statement as to the change for the worse that\r\nhad come over smallpox within his memory would be of the highest\r\nhistorical importance if we could be sure it was not illusory; it is\r\ndifficult to reconcile with the London experiences of smallpox in 1628 and\r\n1641, but, such as it is, we must take note of it:\r\n\r\n    “It is not as yet a complete year since my landing with his Majesty in\r\n    England, and in this short time have observed as strange a difference\r\n    in this subject of my present discourse as in the variety of opinions\r\n    and dispositions of this nation, with whom I have discoursed.” This\r\n    disease of smallpox, he proceeds, “was antiently and generally in the\r\n    common place of _petit_ and _puerile_, and the cure of no moment....\r\n    But from what present constitution of the ayre this childish disease\r\n    hath received such pestilential tinctures I know not; yet I am sure\r\n    that this disease, which for hundreds of yeares and before the\r\n    practice of medicine was so exquisite, hath been as commonly cured as\r\n    it hapned, therefore in this age not incurable, as upon my own\r\n    practice I can testifie.... Riverius will not have one of one thousand\r\n    of humane principles to escape it, yet in my conjecture there is not\r\n    one of one thousand in the universe that hath any knowledge or sense\r\n    of it, from their first ingress into the world to their last egress\r\n    out of this world; which could not be, if it were so inherent or\r\n    concomitant with maternal bloud and seed,” referring to the old\r\n    Arabian doctrine, which Willis adhered to, that every child was\r\n    tainted in the womb with the retained impure menstrual blood of the\r\n    mother, and that smallpox (or measles) was the natural and regular\r\n    purification therefrom. “But smallpox,” he continues, “is dedicated to\r\n    infants more particularly which are moist, and some more than others\r\n    abounding with vitious humours drawn from maternal extravagancy and\r\n    corrupt dyet in the time of their gestation; and by this aptitude are\r\n    well disposed to receive infection of the ayre upon the least\r\n    infection[823].”\r\n\r\nWhen Whitaker calls smallpox a “childish disease,” a disease that was\r\n“antiently and generally in the common place of _petit_ and _puerile_, and\r\nthe cure of no moment,” he says no more than Willis and others say of\r\nsmallpox as it affected infants and children. Says Willis: “there is less\r\ndanger if it should happen in the age of childhood or infancy”; and again:\r\n“the sooner that anyone hath this disease, the more secure they are,\r\nwherefore children most often escape”; and again: “the measles are so much\r\nakin to the smallpox that with most authors they have not deserved to be\r\nhandled apart from them,” although he recognizes that measles is sooner\r\nended and with less danger. Nor was Willis singular among\r\nseventeenth-century physicians in his view--“the sooner that anyone hath\r\nthis disease the more secure they are.” Morton in two passages remarks\r\nupon the greater mildness of smallpox in “infants”: “For that they are\r\nless anxious about the result, infants feel its destructive force more\r\nrarely than others”; and again: “Hence doubtless infants, being of course\r\nἀπαθεῖς, are afflicted more rarely than adults with the severe kinds of\r\nconfluent and malignant smallpox[824].”\r\n\r\nIn the very first treatise written by an English physician specially on\r\nthe Acute Diseases of Infants, the work by Dr Walter Harris, there is a\r\nstatement concerning the mildness of “smallpox and measles in infants”\r\n(who are defined as under four years of age), which goes even farther than\r\nMorton’s:\r\n\r\n    “The smallpox and measles of infants, being for the most part a mild\r\n    and tranquil effervescence of the blood, are wont to have often no bad\r\n    character, where neither the helping hands of physicians are called in\r\n    nor the abounding skill of complacent nurses is put in\r\n    requisition[825].”\r\n\r\nIt has to be said, however, that Morton’s statement about infants is made\r\nto illustrate a favourite notion of his that apprehension as to the\r\nresult, which infants were not subject to, made smallpox worse; and that\r\nHarris’s assertion of the natural mildness of the “smallpox and measles”\r\nof infants comes in to illustrate the evil done by the heating regimen of\r\nphysicians and nurses, who are mentioned in obviously sarcastic terms. So\r\nalso Sydenham says that “many thousands” of infants had perished in the\r\nsmallpox through the ill-timed endeavours of imprudent women to check the\r\ndiarrhoea which was a complication of the malady, but was in Sydenham’s\r\nview, although not in Morton’s, at the same time a wholesome relieving\r\nincident therein. If we may take it that infants and young children had\r\nsmallpox in a mild form, or more rarely confluent than in adults, we may\r\nalso conclude that many of them died, whether from the alexipharmac\r\nremedies which Morton advised and Sydenham (with his follower Harris)\r\ndenounced, or from the attendant diarrhoea which Sydenham thought a\r\nnatural relief to the disease and Morton thought a dangerous complication.\r\n\r\nMaking every allowance for motive or recrimination in the statements, from\r\ntheir several points of view, by Willis, Sydenham, Morton, Harris (Martin\r\nLister might have been added), as to the naturally mild course of smallpox\r\nin infants, or when not interfered with by erroneous treatment, it cannot\r\nbut appear that infantile smallpox at that time was more like measles in\r\nits severity or fatality than the infantile smallpox of later times. It is\r\nperhaps of little moment that Jurin should have repeated in 1723 the\r\nstatements of Willis and others (“the hazard of dying of smallpox\r\nincreases after the birth, as the child advances in age”)[826], for he had\r\nlittle intimate knowledge of epidemics, being at that time mainly occupied\r\nwith mathematics, and with smallpox from the arithmetical side only. But\r\nit is not so easy to understand why Heberden should have said the same a\r\ngeneration after[827]; or how much credit should attach to the remark of\r\n“an eminent physician from Ireland,” who wrote to Dr Andrew, of Exeter, in\r\n1765: “Infants usually have the natural pock of as benign a kind as the\r\nartificial[828].”\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been its fatality or severity among infants and\r\nchildren, it was chiefly as a disease of the higher ages that smallpox in\r\nthe Stuart period attracted so much notice and excited so much alarm. The\r\ncases mentioned in letters and diaries are nearly all of adults; and these\r\nwere the cases, whatever proportion they may have made of the smallpox at\r\nall ages, that gave the disease its ill repute. About the middle of the\r\n18th century we begin to have exact figures of the ages at which deaths\r\nfrom smallpox occurred: the deaths are then nearly all of infants, so much\r\nso that in a total of 1622, made up from exact returns, only 7 were above\r\nthe age of ten, and only 92 between five and ten; while an age-incidence\r\nnearly the same continued to be the rule until after the great epidemic of\r\n1837-39, when it began gradually to move higher[829]. But we should err in\r\nimagining that state of things the rule for the 17th century, just as we\r\nshould err in carrying it forward into our own time. Not only are we told\r\nthat smallpox of infants was like measles in that the cure was of no\r\nmoment (which is strange), but we do know from references to smallpox in\r\nthe familiar writings of the Stuart period that many of its attacks, with\r\na high ratio of fatalities, must have happened to adults. Thus, to take\r\nthe diary of John Evelyn, he himself had smallpox abroad when he was a\r\nyoung man, his two daughters died of it in early womanhood within a few\r\nmonths of each other, and a suitor for the hand of one of them died of it\r\nabout the same time. Medical writings leave the same impression of\r\nsmallpox attacking many after the age of childhood. Willis gives four\r\ncases, all of adults. Morton gives sixty-six clinical cases of smallpox,\r\nthe earliest record of the kind, and one that might pass as modern: twelve\r\nof the cases are under six years of age, nine are at ages from seven to\r\ntwelve, eleven from thirteen years to twenty, seven from twenty-two to\r\nforty, and all but two of the remaining twenty-four clearly indicated in\r\nthe text, in one way or another, as adolescents or adults, the result\r\nbeing that 23 cases are under twelve and 43 cases over twelve[830].\r\n\r\nThat ratio of adults to children may have been exceptional. Morton was\r\nless likely to be called to infants than to older persons, even among the\r\nmiddle class; and no physician in London at that time knew what was\r\npassing among the poorer classes, except from the bills of mortality. But\r\nif Morton had practised in London two or three generations later, say in\r\nthe time of Lettsom, when “most born in London have smallpox before they\r\nare seven,” his casebook would not have shown a proportion of forty-three\r\ncases over twelve years to twenty-three under that age. Whatever things\r\ncontributed to the growing evil repute of smallpox among epidemic\r\nmaladies, there is so much concurrent testimony to the fact itself that we\r\ncan hardly take it to have been wholly illusion. In some parts the\r\nmildness of smallpox was still asserted as if due to local advantages.\r\nThus Dr Plot, who succeeded Willis in his chair of physics at Oxford,\r\nwrote in 1677: “Generally here they are so favourable and kind that, be\r\nthe nurse but tolerably good, the patient seldom miscarries[831].”\r\n\r\nThe reason commonly assigned for the large number of fatalities in\r\nsmallpox after the Restoration was erroneous treatment. That is the charge\r\nmade, not only in the gossip of the town, as Pepys reported it, but in\r\nSydenham’s animadversions on the heating regimen, in Morton’s on the\r\ncooling regimen, and in the sarcasms of both physicians upon the practice\r\nof “mulierculae” or nurses. One may easily make too much of this view of\r\nthe matter; it is certain that the incidence of smallpox, its fatality and\r\nits frequency in general, were determined in the Stuart period, as at\r\nother times, by many things besides. Still, the treatment of smallpox has\r\nalways had the first place in its epidemiological history. The fashion of\r\nit that concerns us at this stage was the famous cooling regimen,\r\ncommonly joined with the name of Sydenham.\r\n\r\n\r\nSydenham’s Practice in Smallpox.\r\n\r\nSydenham occupied his pen largely with smallpox, and gained much of his\r\nreputation by his treatment of it. At the root of his practice lay the\r\ndistinction that he made between discrete smallpox and confluent. His\r\npractice in the discrete form was to do little or nothing, leaving the\r\ndisease to get well of itself. Whether the eventual eruption were to be\r\ndiscrete or confluent, he could not of course tell for certain until two\r\nor three days after the patient sickened; but in no case was the sick\r\nperson to be confined to bed until the eruption came out. If the latter\r\nwere sparse or discrete, the patient was to get up for several hours every\r\nday while the disease ran its course, the physician having small occasion\r\nto interfere with its progress: “whoever labours under the distinct kind\r\nhardly needs the aid of a physician, but gets well of himself and by the\r\nstrength of nature.” One may see how salutary a piece of good sense this\r\nwas at the time, by taking such a case as that of John Evelyn, narrated by\r\nhimself[832]. He fell ill at Geneva in 1646, and was bled, leeched and\r\npurged before the diagnosis of smallpox was made. “God knows,” he says,\r\n“what this would have produced if the spots had not appeared.” When the\r\neruption did appear, it was only the discrete smallpox; the pimples, he\r\nsays, were not many. But he was kept warm in bed for sixteen days, during\r\nwhich he was infinitely afflicted with heat and noisomeness, although the\r\nappearance of the eruption had eased him of his pains. For five whole\r\nweeks did he keep his chamber in this comparatively slight ailment. When\r\nhe suggested to the physician that the letting of blood had been uncalled\r\nfor, the latter excused the depletion on the ground that the blood was so\r\nburnt and vicious that the disease would have turned to plague or spotted\r\nfever had he proceeded by any other method[833].\r\n\r\nAs there were many such cases, Sydenham’s radical distinction between\r\ndiscrete and confluent smallpox, with his advice to leave the former to\r\nitself, was of great value, and is justly reckoned to his credit. But in\r\nthe management of confluent smallpox he advised active interference. If\r\nthere were the slightest indication that the disease was to be confluent\r\n(that is to say, the eruption copious and the pocks tending to run\r\ntogether), he at once ordered the patient to receive a vomit and a purge,\r\nand then to be bled, with a view to check the ebullition of the blood and\r\nmitigate the violence of the disease. Even infants and young children were\r\nto have their blood drawn in such an event. This heroic treatment at the\r\noutset was according to the rule of _obsta principiis_; by means of it he\r\nthought to divert the attack into a milder course. The initial depletion\r\nonce over, Sydenham had resort to what is known as the cooling regimen. He\r\nset his face against the “sixteen days warm in bed,” which Evelyn had to\r\nendure even in a discrete smallpox. It was usually a mistake for the\r\npatient to take to bed continually before the sixth day from his sickening\r\nor the fourth day from the appearance of the eruption; after that stage,\r\nwhen all the pustules would be out, the regimen would differ in different\r\nconfluent cases, and, of course, in some a continuance in bed would be\r\ninevitable as well as prudent. In like manner cardiac or cordial remedies,\r\nwhich were of a heating character, were indicated only by the patient’s\r\nlowness. The more powerful diaphoretic treacles, such as mithridate, were\r\nalways a mistake. The tenth day was a critical time, and then paregoric\r\nwas almost a specific. In the stage of recovery it was not rarely prudent\r\nto prescribe cordial medicines and canary wine. Thus, on a fair review of\r\nSydenham’s ordinances for smallpox in a variety of circumstances, it will\r\nappear that he did not carry the cooling regimen to fanatical lengths and\r\nthat he was sufficiently aware of the risks attending a chill in the\r\ncourse of the disease[834].\r\n\r\nApart from his rule of leaving cases of discrete smallpox to recover of\r\nthemselves, Sydenham’s management of the disease was neither approved\r\ngenerally at the time, nor endorsed by posterity. His phlebotomies in\r\nconfluent cases, usually at the outset, but sometimes even after the\r\neruption was out if the patient had been under the heating regimen before,\r\nwere an innovation borrowed from the French Galenists. The earlier writers\r\nhad, for the most part, excepted smallpox among the acute maladies in\r\nwhich blood was to be drawn. But the Galenic rules of treatment were made\r\nmore rigorous in proportion as they were challenged by the Paracelsist or\r\nchemical physicians, and it was among the upholders of tradition that\r\nblood-letting was extended to smallpox. Whitaker says that, when he was at\r\nSt Germain with the exiled Stuarts, the French king was blooded in\r\nsmallpox ten or eleven times, and recovered; “and upon this example they\r\nwill ground a precept for universal practice.”\r\n\r\n    The ambiguity of the diagnosis at the outset, and the desire to lose\r\n    no time, may have been the original grounds of this indiscriminate\r\n    fashion of bleeding. Evelyn’s doctor at Geneva in 1646, “afterwards\r\n    acknowledged that he should not have bled me had he suspected the\r\n    smallpox, which brake out a day after,” but eventually he defended his\r\n    practice as having made the attack milder. In like manner Sir Robert\r\n    Sibbald, of Edinburgh, (1684) took four ounces of blood from a child\r\n    of five, who was sickening for some malady; when it turned out to be\r\n    smallpox, the mother expressed her alarm that blood should have been\r\n    drawn; but Sibbald pointed to the favourable character of the eruption\r\n    as justifying what he had done: “Optime enim eruperunt variolae, et ab\r\n    earum eruptione febris remissit[835].”\r\n\r\nThe ill effects of blood-letting, says Whitaker, may be observed in French\r\nchildren, which by this frequent phlebotomizing are “withered in\r\n_juvenile_ age.” Therefore, he concludes, blooding in smallpox should not\r\nbe a common remedy, “but in such extremity as the person must lose some\r\npart of his substance to save the whole.” He calls it the rash and\r\ninconsiderate practice of modish persons; “and if the disease be conjunct\r\n[confluent], with an undeniable plethory of blood, which is the proper\r\nindication of phlebotomy, yet such bleeding ought to be by scarification\r\n[upon the arms, thighs or back] and cupping-glasses, without the cutting\r\nof any major vessel.” Another English physician of the time, Dr Slatholm,\r\nof Buntingford in Hertfordshire, who wrote in 1657[836], says that he had\r\nknown physicians in Paris not to abstain from venesection in children of\r\ntender age, even in sucklings. He had never approved the letting of blood\r\nin such cases, lest nature be so weakened as to be unable to drive the\r\npeccant matter to the skin. For the most part, he says, an ill result\r\nfollows venesection in smallpox; and although it sometimes succeeds, yet\r\nthat is more by chance than by good management. As to exposing the sick in\r\nsmallpox to cold air, he declares that he had known many in benign\r\nsmallpox carried off thereby, instancing the case of his brother-in-law,\r\nthe squire of Great Hornham, near Buntingford, whose death from smallpox\r\nin November, 1656, in the flower of his age, he set down to a chill\r\nbrought on “ejus inobedientia et mulierum contumacia[837].”\r\n\r\nThe cooling regimen, as well as the danger of it, was familiar long before\r\nSydenham’s time. There could be no better proof of this than a bit of\r\ndialogue in Beaumont and Fletcher’s ‘Fair Maid of the Inn’ (Act II. scene\r\n2), a comedy which was licensed in January, 1626:\r\n\r\n    _Host._ And you have been in England? But they say ladies in England\r\n    take a great deal of physic.... They say ladies there take physic for\r\n    fashion.\r\n\r\n    _Clown._ Yes, sir, and many times die to keep fashion.\r\n\r\n    _Host._ How! Die to keep fashion?\r\n\r\n    _Clown._ Yes: I have known a lady sick of the smallpox, only to keep\r\n    her face from pit-holes, take cold, strike them in again, kick up the\r\n    heels, and vanish.\r\n\r\nSydenham says that the heating regimen was the practice of empirics and\r\nsciolists. Per contra his distinguished colleague Morton says that every\r\nold woman and apothecary practised the cooling regimen, and he points the\r\nmoral of its evil consequences in a good many of his sixty-six clinical\r\ncases[838]. He pronounces the results of the cooling regimen to have been\r\ndisastrous; he had been told that Sydenham himself relaxed the rigour of\r\nhis treatment in his later years. There was so little smallpox for some\r\nfifteen years after the date of Morton’s book (1694) that the\r\ncontroversies on its treatment appear to have dropped. But, on the revival\r\nof epidemics in 1710 and 1714, essays were written against blooding,\r\nvomits and purges in smallpox[839].\r\n\r\nIn 1718, Dr Woodward, the Gresham professor of physic and an eminent\r\ngeologist, published some remarks on “the new practice of purging” in\r\nsmallpox, which were directed against Mead and Freind. In 1719 Freind\r\naddressed a Latin letter to Mead on the subject (the purging was in the\r\nsecondary fever of confluent smallpox), and a lively controversy arose in\r\nwhich Freind referred to Woodward anonymously as a well-known empiric. On\r\nthe 10th of June, 1719, about eight in the evening, Woodward was entering\r\nthe quadrangle of Gresham College when he was set upon by Mead. Woodward\r\ndrew his sword and rested the point of it until Mead drew his, which he\r\nwas long in doing. The passes then began and the combatants advanced step\r\nby step until they were in the middle of the quadrangle. Woodward declared\r\n(in a letter to the _Weekly Journal_) that he was getting the best of it,\r\nwhen his foot slipped and he fell. He found Mead quickly standing over him\r\ndemanding that he should beg his life. This Woodward declined to do, and\r\nthe combat degenerated to a strife of tongues[840]. Next year the\r\ncontroversy over the treatment of smallpox assumed a triangular form. The\r\nthird side was represented by Dr Dover, who had been something of a\r\nbuccaneer on the Spanish main and was now in practice as a physician. An\r\nold pupil of Sydenham’s, he still adhered to blood-letting in smallpox;\r\nand in the spring of 1720, when the disease was exceedingly prevalent\r\namong persons of quality in London, he claimed to have rescued from death\r\na lady whom Mead had given over, by pulling off the latter’s blisters and\r\nordering a pint of blood to be drawn. “He hath observed the same method\r\nwith like success with several persons of quality this week, and is as yet\r\nin very great vogue.... He declaims against his brethren of the faculty\r\n[especially Mead and Freind], with public and great vehemence, and\r\nparticularly against purging and blistering in the distemper, which he\r\naffirms to be the death of thousands[841].”\r\n\r\nHuxham, another Sydenhamian, appears to have practised not only blooding\r\nin smallpox, but also blistering, purging and salivating[842]. But in that\r\ngeneration the practice was exceptional; so much so that when it revived\r\nin some hands about 1752 (including Fothergill’s), it was thus referred to\r\nin a letter upon the general epidemic of smallpox in that year: “I have\r\nheard that bleeding is more commonly practised by some of the best\r\nphysicians nowadays than it was formerly, even after the smallpox is come\r\nout[843].” In smallpox the lancet, like other methods, has been in fashion\r\nfor a time, and then out of fashion; but the old teaching that smallpox\r\ndid not call for blood-letting was ultimately restored. When Barker, in\r\n1747, gave a discourse before the College of Physicians on the “Agreement\r\nbetwixt Ancient and Modern Physicians,” he did not venture to defend\r\nSydenham’s blooding in smallpox, although he would not admit that he was\r\n“a bloodthirsty man[844].”\r\n\r\n\r\nCauses of Mild or Severe Smallpox.\r\n\r\nBesides the errors of the heating or the cooling regimen respectively,\r\nthere is another thing that may have had something to do with the greater\r\nfatality of smallpox, as remarked by many, about the middle of the 17th\r\ncentury. “How is it,” asks Sydenham, “that so few of the common people die\r\nof this disease compared with the numbers that perish by it among the\r\nrich[845]?” Sydenham may not have known how much smallpox mortality there\r\nwas in the poorer quarters of London. But the Restoration was certainly a\r\ngreat time of free living in the upper classes of society, and it is\r\nequally certain that smallpox was apt to prove a deadly disease to a\r\nbroken constitution. Willis believed that excesses even predisposed people\r\nto take the infection: “I have known some to have fallen into this disease\r\nfrom a surfeit or immoderate exercise, when none besides in the whole\r\ncountry about hath been sick of it.” There were, of course, families in\r\nwhich smallpox was for some unknown reason peculiarly fatal. Again, the\r\norigins of constitutional weakness are lost in ancestry, the poor stamina\r\nof children being often determined by the lives of their grandfathers or\r\ngreat-grandfathers. In the royal family of Stuart smallpox proved more\r\nthan ordinarily fatal, but it was among the grand-children and great\r\ngrand-children of James I. that those fatalities happened. Of the children\r\nof Charles I., the Duke of Gloucester and the Princess of Orange died of\r\nsmallpox within a few months of each other in the year of the Restoration.\r\nThe disease was not less fatal a generation after in the family of the\r\nDuke of York (James II.). Dr Willis fell into disgrace with that prince\r\nbecause he bluntly told him that the ailment of one of his sons was “mala\r\nstamina vitae.” All his sons, says Burnet, died young and unhealthy, one\r\nof them by smallpox. Of his two daughters, Queen Mary died of haemorrhagic\r\nsmallpox in 1694, and the Duke of Gloucester, only child of the other,\r\nPrincess Anne of Denmark (afterwards Queen Anne), died at the age of\r\neleven, of a malady which was called smallpox by some, and malignant\r\nsore-throat by others[846].\r\n\r\nAmong the medical writers of this period, who gave reasons why smallpox\r\nshould be so severe or deadly in some while it was so slight in others,\r\nMorton was the most systematic. He made three degrees of smallpox--benign,\r\nmedium and malignant: these did not answer quite to the discrete,\r\nconfluent and haemorrhagic of other classifiers, for his malignant class\r\nincluded so many confluent cases that in one place he uses _malignae_ as\r\nthe equivalent of _confluentes seu cohaerentes_, while his middle class\r\nwas made up of some confluent cases,--perhaps such medium cases as had\r\nconfluent pocks on the face but not elsewhere,--and a certain proportion\r\nof discrete. The medium kind were the most common (_frequentissimae sunt\r\net maxime vulgares variolae mediae_). Still, it was the benign type that\r\nhe made the _norma_ or standard of smallpox, from which the disease was\r\n“deflected” towards the medium type, or still farther deflected towards\r\nthe malignant. He gives a list of fourteen things that may serve to\r\ndeflect an attack of smallpox from the _norma_ of mildness to the degrees\r\nof mean severity or malignity:\r\n\r\n    1. If the eruption come out too soon or too late.\r\n\r\n    2. If the patient be sprung from a stock in which smallpox is wont to\r\n    prove fatal, as if by hereditary right.\r\n\r\n    3. If the attack fall in the flower of life, when the spirits are\r\n    keener and more inclined to febrile heats.\r\n\r\n    4. If the patient be harassed by fever, or by sorrow, love or any\r\n    other passion of the mind.\r\n\r\n    5. If the patient be given to spirituous liquors, vehement exercise or\r\n    anything else of the kind that tends to irritate the spirits.\r\n\r\n    6. If the attack come upon women during certain states of health\r\n    peculiar to them.\r\n\r\n    7. If cathartics, emetics and blooding had been used.\r\n\r\n    8. If the heating regimen had been carried to excess, or other\r\n    ill-judged treatment followed.\r\n\r\n    9. If the patient had met a chill at the outset, checking the\r\n    eruption.\r\n\r\n    10. If the attack happen in summer.\r\n\r\n    11. If the attack happen during a variolous epidemic constitution of\r\n    the air.\r\n\r\n    12. If the patient be pregnant or newly married.\r\n\r\n    13. If the patient be consumptive or syphilitic.\r\n\r\n    14. If the patient be apprehensive as to the result.\r\n\r\nMorton having made the benign type the norm, made the medium type the\r\ncommonest; and that was really true of the first great epidemic in London\r\nin his experience, in the years 1667-68. Sydenham says of it that the\r\ncases were more than he ever remembered to have seen, before or after:\r\n“nevertheless, as the disease was regular and of a mild type, it cut off\r\ncomparatively few among the immense number of those who took it.” Pepys\r\nenters this epidemic under the date of 9 Feb. 1668: “It also hardly ever\r\nwas remembered for such a season for the smallpox as these last two months\r\nhave been, people being seen all up and down the streets newly come out\r\nafter the smallpox.” Let us pause here for a moment to ask what Pepys may\r\nhave meant by recognising the people all up and down the streets newly\r\ncome out after the smallpox. Did he mean that they were pock-marked? We\r\nmay answer the question by the testimony of Dr Fothergill for a\r\ncorrespondingly mild and extensive prevalence of smallpox in London some\r\nthree generations later, which I shall take out of its order because it\r\nbears upon the question of pitting. His report for December 1751 is:[847]\r\n\r\n    “Smallpox began to make their appearance more frequently than they had\r\n    done of late, and became epidemic in this month. They were in general\r\n    of a benign kind, tolerably distinct, though often very numerous. Many\r\n    had them so favourably as to require very little medical assistance,\r\n    and perhaps a greater number have got through them safely than has of\r\n    late years been known.” The January (1752) report is: “A distinct\r\n    benign kind of smallpox continued to be the epidemic of this month; a\r\n    few confluent cases, but rarely.” In February he writes: “Children and\r\n    young persons, unless the constitution is very unfavourable, get\r\n    through it very well; and the height to which the weekly bills are\r\n    swelled ought to be considered, in the present case, as an argument of\r\n    the frequency, not the fatality, of this distemper.” In June the type\r\n    was still favourable: “Crowds of such whom we see daily in the streets\r\n    without any other vestige than the remaining redness of a distinct\r\n    pock.”\r\n\r\nThis was an epidemic such as Sydenham alleges that of 1667-68 to have\r\nbeen; and the vestiges of smallpox by which Pepys recognized those who\r\nwere newly come out of the disease were probably the same that Fothergill\r\nsaw in 1752.\r\n\r\nA practitioner at Chichester does indeed say as much of those treated by\r\nhimself about the same date: “when the distemper did rage so much in and\r\nabout Chichester, ten or a dozen years since [written in 1685], it was a\r\ngreat many that fell under my care, I believe sixty at the least, and yet\r\nI lost but one person of the disease. Nor was one of my patients marked\r\nwith them to be seen but half a year after[848].” As these experiences\r\nmust have been somewhat exceptional I shall give a section to the general\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\r\nPockmarked Faces in the 17th Century.\r\n\r\nThe smallpox of 1667-68 had among its numerous victims one of the king’s\r\nmistresses, the beautiful Frances Stewart, duchess of Richmond, residing\r\nin Somerset House, who caught the disease in March 1668 and was “mighty\r\nfull of it.” Pepys, who records the fact, had seen her portrait taken\r\nshortly before: “It would make a man weep,” he exclaims, “to see what she\r\nwas then and what she is likely to be by people’s discourse now.” Happily\r\nthe worst fears were not realized. Pepys saw her driving in the Park in\r\nAugust, and remarks, without a strict regard to grammar, that she was “of\r\na noble person as ever I did see, but her face worse than it was\r\nconsiderably by the smallpox.” The king, unlike the Lord Castlewood of\r\nromance, suffered no loss of ardour for his mistress, having visited her\r\nover the garden wall, as Mr Pepys relates, on the evening of Sunday, the\r\n10th of May. It is rather the idea, and especially the historical idea, of\r\nthese horrors that “would make a man weep,” and it has moved a great and\r\neloquent historian of our own time to deep pathos[849]. If there be\r\nanything that can counteract the effects of agreeable rhetoric it is\r\nperhaps statistics. The following numerical estimate of the proportion of\r\npockmarked faces in London after the Restoration is accordingly offered\r\nwith all deference. It applies mainly to the criminal and lower classes,\r\nwho were as likely as any to bear the marks of smallpox.\r\n\r\n    In the _London Gazette_, the first advertisement of a person “wanted”\r\n    appears in December, 1667; and thereafter until June, 1774, there are\r\n    a hundred such advertisements of runaway apprentices, of footmen or\r\n    other servants who had robbed their masters, of horse-stealers, of\r\n    highwaymen, and the like. There is always a description more or less\r\n    full; and in the consecutive hundred I have included only such persons\r\n    as are so particularly described in feature that pock-pits would have\r\n    been mentioned if they had existed. It is not until the ninth case\r\n    that “pock-holes in his face” occurs in the description, the eleventh\r\n    case following close, with the same mark of identity. Then comes a\r\n    long interval until the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth cases, both\r\n    with pock-holes, two of a band of highwaymen concerned in an attempt\r\n    to rob the Duke of Ormond’s coach near London, one of them having\r\n    emerged from Frying-pan Alley in Petticoat Lane. Fifteen cases follow,\r\n    all described by distinctive features, without mention of pock-marks,\r\n    until we come to the fortieth, a boy of twelve or thirteen, who “hath\r\n    lately had the smallpox.” The next is the forty-ninth, a Yorkshireman,\r\n    long-visaged, and “hath had the smallpox,” and close upon him the\r\n    fiftieth “marked with smallpox.” Then come four in quick succession,\r\n    the 56th, 59th, 61st and 63d; next the 71st; and then a long series\r\n    with no marks of smallpox, until the 95th, 97th, 99th and 100th, three\r\n    of these last four having been negroes.\r\n\r\nThe result is that sixteen in the hundred are marked more or less with\r\nsmallpox, four of them being black men or boys. One had “lately had the\r\nsmallpox,” another had “newly recovered of the smallpox.” One was a\r\ncherry-cheeked boy of twelve, “somewhat disfigured with smallpox,” who had\r\nrun away from Bradford school. Two are described as much disfigured, some\r\nas a little disfigured, several others as “full of pock-holes.” The same\r\nmark of identity is occasionally mentioned in the advertisements beyond\r\nthe hundred tabulated, but not more frequently than before, the usual term\r\nin the later period being “pock-broken.” This proportion of pock-marked\r\npersons among the London populace, sixteen in the hundred, or about twelve\r\nin the hundred excluding negroes, does not err on the side of\r\nunder-statement, if it errs at all. Some such small ratio is what we might\r\nhave expected in the antecedent probabilities, arising out of the varying\r\ndegrees of severity of smallpox and the various textures of the human\r\nskin. Pitting after smallpox has always been a special risk of a certain\r\ntexture of the skin, namely, a sufficient thickness of the vascular layer\r\nto afford the pock a deep base. Such complexions are common enough even in\r\nour own latitudes; and those are the faces that have always borne the most\r\nobvious traces of smallpox. It was some of the confluent cases, or rather,\r\nof such of them as recovered, that became pock-marked: the babe that\r\nbecame a changeling was not likely to survive. Adults retained the marks\r\nmore than children, so that there must always have been a good many\r\npock-marked faces in a population where the incidence of the disease was\r\nlargely upon grown persons, as in the 17th century and in our own time.\r\nWhen smallpox was something of a novelty at the end of the Elizabethan\r\nperiod, a poet addressed a pathetic lyric to his mistress’s pock-marked\r\nface. A medical writer of the same period reproduces the old Arabian\r\nprescription against pitting, to open the pocks on the face with a golden\r\npin, and adds: “I have heard of some, which, having not used anythinge at\r\nall, but suffering them to drie up and fall of themselves, without picking\r\nor scratching, have done very well, and not any pits remained after\r\nit[850].” Whitaker, in 1661, dismisses the risk of pitting very briefly,\r\nremarking that the means of prevention was “commonly the complement of\r\nevery experienced nurse[851].” Morton, in his sixty-six clinical cases and\r\nin his commentary, makes but slight reference to pitting. In his 14th\r\ncase, a severe one, “no scars remained”; in his general remarks he treats\r\npitting as a bugbear: “women set the fairness of their faces above life\r\nitself,” which may mean, as in Beaumont and Fletcher’s comedy, that they\r\nwould chill themselves at all risks by the cooling regimen so they might\r\ndrive the pocks in[852].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Epidemiology continued to the end of the 17th century.\r\n\r\nWhat little remains to be said of smallpox in England to the end of the\r\nseventeenth century may be introduced by the following table of the deaths\r\nin London.\r\n\r\n_Smallpox Deaths in London 1661 to 1700._\r\n\r\n               Total      Smallpox\r\n  Year         deaths     deaths\r\n\r\n  1661         16,665      1246\r\n  1662         13,664       768\r\n  1663         12,741       411\r\n  1664         15,453      1233\r\n  1665         97,306       655\r\n  1666         12,738        38\r\n  1667         15,842      1196\r\n  1668         17,278      1987\r\n  1669         19,432       951\r\n  1670         20,198      1465\r\n  1671         15,729       696\r\n  1672         18,230      1116\r\n  1673         17,504       853\r\n  1674         21,201      2507\r\n  1675         17,244       997\r\n  1676         18,732       359\r\n  1677         19,067      1678\r\n  1678         20,678      1798\r\n  1679         21,730      1967\r\n  1680         21,053       689\r\n  1681         23,951      2982\r\n  1682         20,691      1408\r\n  1683         20,587      2096\r\n  1684         23,202      1560\r\n  1685         23,222      2496\r\n  1686         22,609      1062\r\n  1687         21,460      1551\r\n  1688         22,921      1318\r\n  1689         23,502      1389\r\n  1690         21,461       778\r\n  1691         22,691      1241\r\n  1692         20,874      1592\r\n  1693         20,959      1164\r\n  1694         24,100      1683\r\n  1695         19,047       784\r\n  1696         18,638       196\r\n  1697         20,972       634\r\n  1698         20,183      1813\r\n  1699         20,795       890\r\n  1700         19,443      1031\r\n\r\nSydenham’s remarks throw some light on the smallpox of the several years.\r\nWhile the epidemic of 1667-68 was of a regular and mild type, that of\r\n1670-72, which has fewer deaths in the bills, was of the type of black\r\nsmallpox complicated with flux. The year 1674 has the highest figures yet\r\nreached; the type of the disease was confluent, and so severe that it\r\n“almost equalled the plague”; while the smallpox of the year 1681, with a\r\nstill higher total, was “confluent of the worst kind.”\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to make out what the differences of “type” described by\r\nSydenham depended on; but it may be hazarded that those who fell into\r\nsmallpox in an otherwise unhealthy season would die in larger numbers,\r\nbeing weakened by antecedent disease, such as measles or epidemic\r\ndiarrhoea, influenza or typhus fever. An epidemic of measles in the first\r\nsix months of 1674 was most probably the reason of the great fatality of\r\nsmallpox in the second half of that year (see the chapter on Measles). The\r\nhigh figures of smallpox mortality in 1681 followed two hot summers,\r\nunhealthy with infantile diarrhoea, and coincided with a third season\r\nunhealthy in the same way. The deaths by smallpox in the last week of\r\nAugust, 1681, reached the very high figure of 168, the next highest cause\r\nof death that week, and the highest the week after, being “griping in the\r\nguts,” or infantile diarrhoea. The smallpox of 1685 was more uniformly\r\ndistributed over the months of the year, which was one of malignant\r\ntyphus, the worst week for fever having 114 deaths (ending 29 Sept.), and\r\nthe worst week for smallpox 99 deaths (ending 18 Aug.).\r\n\r\nThe deaths by smallpox in the London bills are the only 17th century\r\nfigures of the disease. According to later experience, a high mortality in\r\nLondon in a certain year meant an epidemic general in England in that or\r\nthe following year; and the same appears to have held good for the period\r\nfollowing the Restoration. In the parish register of Taunton, a weaving\r\ntown, the smallpox deaths are many in 1658 (“all the year,” which was one\r\nof agues and influenza), in 1670, 1677, and 1684 (“very mortal,” the year\r\nbeing noted for a very hot summer and for fevers and dysenteries[853]).\r\nThe highest total of deaths in London to the end of the 17th century fell\r\nin 1681, which is known to have been a year of very fatal smallpox at\r\nNorwich[854] and at Halifax. Thoresby’s friend Heywood lost three children\r\nby it at the latter town in the epidemic of 1681, which does not appear to\r\nhave visited Leeds. In 1689 Thoresby himself lost his two children at\r\nLeeds within a few days. In 1699 the epidemic returned, and he again lost\r\ntwo of the four children that had been born to him in the interval[855].\r\nSimilar calamities befell country houses, of which the following from the\r\ncorrespondence of a titled family in Cumberland is an instance:\r\n\r\n    “17th April, 1688,--Captaine Kirkby came hither, and told me that Mrs\r\n    Skelton, my god-daughter, of Braithwaite, dyed the last week, and her\r\n    two children, of the smallpockes[856].”\r\n\r\nRumours of “smallpox and other infectious disease” at Cambridge in the\r\nsummer of 1674[857], and at Bath in the summer of 1675[858], threatened to\r\ninterfere with the studies of the one place and the gaieties of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmallpox in London in 1694: the death of the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of smallpox in London in 1694 was made memorable by the death\r\nof the queen. On 22 November Evelyn notes, “a very sickly time, especially\r\nthe smallpox, of which divers considerable persons died”; on 29 December:\r\n“the smallpox increased exceedingly, and was very mortal,” the queen\r\nhaving died of it the day before. Queen Mary came of a stock to which\r\nsmallpox had been peculiarly fatal, a brother and sister of her father,\r\nJames II., having died of it at Whitehall in 1660. Some of the particulars\r\nof her illness and death come from bishop Burnet[859], who saw her in the\r\nfirst days of the attack and was about the Court until the end of it; the\r\nauthentic medical details are by Dr Walter Harris, one of the physicians\r\nin attendance, who published them, by leave of his superiors, in order to\r\nmeet the censures passed on the doctors “by learned men at a great\r\ndistance[860].”\r\n\r\n    The symptoms of illness on the first day did not prevent the queen\r\n    from going abroad; but, as she was still out of sorts at bedtime, she\r\n    took a large dose of Venice treacle, a powerful diaphoretic which her\r\n    former physician, the famous physiologist Dr Lower, had recommended\r\n    her to take as often as she found herself inclined to a fever[861].\r\n    Finding no sweat to appear as usual, she took next morning a double\r\n    quantity of it, but again without inducing the usual effect of\r\n    perspiration. Up to that time she had not asked advice of the\r\n    physicians. To this severe dosing with one of the most powerful\r\n    alexipharmac or heating medicines, the malignant type of the ensuing\r\n    smallpox was mainly ascribed by Harris, who was a follower of Sydenham\r\n    and a partizan of the cooling regimen. On the third day from the\r\n    initial symptoms the eruption appeared, with a very troublesome cough;\r\n    the eruption came out in such a manner that the physicians were very\r\n    doubtful whether it would prove to be smallpox or measles. On the\r\n    fourth day the smallpox showed itself in the face and the rest of the\r\n    body “under its proper and distinct form.” But on the sixth day, in\r\n    the morning, the variolous pustules were changed all over her breast\r\n    into the large red spots “of the measles”; and the erysipelas, or\r\n    rose, swelled her whole face, the former pustules giving place to it.\r\n    That evening many livid round petechiae appeared on the forehead above\r\n    the eyebrows, and on the temples, which Harris says he had foretold in\r\n    the morning. One physician said these were not petechiae, but\r\n    sphacelated spots; but next morning a surgeon proved by his lancet\r\n    that they contained blood. During the night following the sixth day,\r\n    Dr Harris sat up with the patient, and observed that she had great\r\n    difficulty of breathing, followed soon after by a copious spitting of\r\n    blood. On the seventh day the spitting of blood was succeeded by blood\r\n    in the urine. On the eighth day the pustules on the limbs, which had\r\n    kept the normal variolous character longest, lost their fulness, and\r\n    changed into round spots of deep red or scarlet colour, smooth and\r\n    level with the skin, like the stigmata of the plague. Harris observed\r\n    about the region of the heart one large pustule filled with matter,\r\n    having a broad scarlet circle round it like a burning coal, under\r\n    which a great deal of extravasated blood was found when the body was\r\n    examined after death. Towards the end, the queen slumbered sometimes,\r\n    but said she was not refreshed thereby. At last she lay silent for\r\n    some hours; and some words that came from her shewed, says Burnet,\r\n    that her thoughts had begun to break. She died on the 28th of\r\n    December, at one in the morning, in the ninth day of her illness.\r\n\r\nThe case of Queen Mary was one of discrete smallpox turning to the\r\nhaemorrhagic form; and it had from first to last the most striking\r\nresemblance to that of her uncle, the Duke of Gloucester, in September,\r\n1660[862]. The smallpox, says Burnet, came out, but the pustules “sunk so\r\nthat there was no hope of raising them”; and in sinking they turned to\r\nlivid spots or blotches. It is quite possible that the repeated doses of\r\nVenice treacle at the outset, which failed in their usual effect of\r\ninducing sweat, may have had something to do with the result, as Dr Harris\r\ncertainly believed and afterwards publicly said with the leave of his\r\nsuperiors. But the queen, with eminent qualities of mind and heart, was\r\nnot physically of good constitution. She was one of those children of\r\nJames II. whom Willis had brusquely pronounced, some twenty-five years\r\nbefore, to be affected with _mala stamina vitae_; and her father’s\r\nbrother, the Duke of Gloucester, who was not treated in the same way, and,\r\nby one account, not treated at all, died in exactly the same kind of\r\nhaemorrhagic smallpox[863].\r\n\r\n\r\nCircumstances of the great Epidemic in 1710.\r\n\r\nFor fifteen years after the year of Queen Mary’s death by haemorrhagic\r\nsmallpox, there was comparatively little of the disease in London. In\r\nseven of the years the deaths were counted by hundreds, while the average\r\nof the whole period from 1695 to 1710, which included the years of\r\nMarlborough’s campaigns, was unaccountably low. There was a corresponding\r\nlull in the fever mortality in London; and as precisely the same kind of\r\nlull took place both in fever and smallpox during the next great war with\r\nFrance a century after, it may seem as if a state of war, instead of\r\nspreading infectious disease as it did in the countries where the war\r\nraged, had the effect in England of reducing it. The period of comparative\r\nimmunity came to an end, both for fever and smallpox, with the great\r\nepidemic of each disease in 1710, in which year smallpox cut off 3138 in\r\nLondon and “great numbers in Norwich[864].” In 1714 there was another\r\nsevere epidemic of smallpox in London, again in company with one of fever,\r\nand thereafter a high average for many years.\r\n\r\n_Smallpox deaths in London, 1701-1720._\r\n\r\n        Deaths from   Deaths from\r\n  Year   smallpox      all causes\r\n\r\n  1701       1099          20,471\r\n  1702        311          19,481\r\n  1703        398          20,720\r\n  1704       1501          22,684\r\n  1705       1095          22,097\r\n  1706        721          19,847\r\n  1707       1078          21,600\r\n  1708       1687          21,291\r\n  1709       1024          21,800\r\n  1710       3138          24,620\r\n  1711        915          19,833\r\n  1712       1943          21,198\r\n  1713       1614          21,057\r\n  1714       2810          26,589\r\n  1715       1057          22,232\r\n  1716       2427          24,436\r\n  1717       2211          23,446\r\n  1718       1884          26,523\r\n  1719       3229          28,347\r\n  1720       1442          25,454\r\n\r\nThe marked increase of smallpox deaths in 1710 and 1714, after an interval\r\nof low or moderate annual mortalities, caused the same cry to be raised\r\nas in the Restoration period, namely, that the medical treatment was to\r\nblame. Lynn, writing in 1714, says that many complaints were made of the\r\ndestructiveness of smallpox in the epidemic four years before (1710), and\r\nof “the great want of better help, care or advice therein[865].” Woodward\r\nalso ascribed the great increase of smallpox fatalities from 1710 onwards\r\nto erroneous treatment[866]. All the lives that might have been saved by\r\nbetter medical treatment or by more assiduous visiting of the sick would,\r\nin the then circumstances of the London populace, have made little\r\ndifference to the bills of mortality. The causes that made fever so mortal\r\nin the same years were in great part the causes that made smallpox mortal,\r\nthe former chiefly among those in the prime or maturity of life, the\r\nlatter chiefly among the children. London had nearly reached its maximum\r\nof overcrowding; its population advanced but little for a good many years,\r\nand its mortality from all causes was so great that the numbers were only\r\nkept up by a constant recruit from the country. The necessity of doing\r\nsomething for the health of the poorer classes was felt, but nothing\r\nadequate was done or could be done[867]. So far as concerned the richer\r\nclasses, they incurred constant danger of smallpox infection. In one of\r\nthose fatal years, probably 1720, when there was smallpox among persons of\r\nquality in London, the Duchess of Argyll wrote to the Countess of Bute, to\r\ncongratulate her on the birth of a daughter and on having two fine boys in\r\nher family already, “and he that has had the smallpox as good as two, so\r\nmortal as that distemper has been this year in town was never known[868].”\r\n\r\nThe domestics also of great houses frequently caught smallpox and spread\r\nit, a trouble which gave occasion at length, in 1746, to the first\r\nSmallpox Hospital for the admission of such of them as brought\r\nsubscribers’ letters. Before that it had been the practice of the rich to\r\nsend their domestics to private houses kept by nurses[869].\r\n\r\nIt was in these circumstances, and for the benefit of the upper classes\r\nand their domestics, that a project of getting through smallpox on easy\r\nterms was brought to the notice of London society in 1721.\r\n\r\n\r\nInoculation brought into England.\r\n\r\nThe first that was heard in England of engrafting the smallpox was through\r\na communication by Dr Timoni, a Greek of Constantinople, to Dr Woodward,\r\nGresham professor of physic, who had the paper printed in the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_ of the Royal Society[870]. After a statement\r\nthat “the Circassians, Georgians and other Asiatics” had brought the\r\npractice to Constantinople, and that it had been followed there for forty\r\nyears by “the Turks and others” (statements never confirmed but on inquiry\r\ncontradicted by those who knew), he proceeds to matters more within his\r\nown competence. During these eight years past “thousands” of subjects have\r\nbeen inoculated, and the value of the practice has now been put beyond all\r\nsuspicion and doubt. The practice is to take fluid smallpox matter from\r\nthe pustules of a discrete case of the natural disease, and convey it warm\r\nin a stopped phial to the scene of inoculation. A few punctures with a\r\nthree-edged surgeon’s needle are made in any of the fleshy parts (but\r\npreferably over the muscles of the arm or forearm) until the blood comes;\r\na drop of the fluid matter of smallpox is then to be mixed with the blood,\r\nand the inoculated part to be protected by a walnut shell bound over it.\r\nThe symptoms that follow are very slight, some being scarce sensible that\r\nthey are ill. The pocks that ensue are for the most part distinct, few,\r\nand scattered; commonly ten or twenty break out; now and then the patient\r\nmay have only two or three; few have a hundred. The matter is hardly a\r\nthick pus, as in the common sort, but a thinner kind of _sanies_. There\r\nare some in whom no pustules appear except at the points of insertion,\r\nwhere purulent tubercles arise; yet these have never had the smallpox\r\nafterwards in their whole lives, though they have consorted with persons\r\nhaving it. On one occasion fifty were inoculated together, and of these\r\nfour developed smallpox which was nearly confluent; but there was a\r\nsuspicion that they must have been already infected by contagion. Timoni\r\nhad never observed any mischievous accident from this incision hitherto;\r\nreports of such had sometimes spread abroad among the vulgar, “yet having\r\ngone on purpose to the houses whence such rumours have arisen I have found\r\nthe whole to be absolutely false.” But, to keep nothing back, he will\r\nmention two fatalities of children inoculated; both of them were cases of\r\nhereditary _lues_ with marasmus, and it was about the fortieth day from\r\ntheir inoculation that death ensued. The rest of Timoni’s paper is printed\r\nin the original Latin, being devoted to a theory of engrafting which\r\nafterwards passed current:--one attack of smallpox secures from a second,\r\na mild attack serves as well as a severe, as also in the natural way, the\r\nreason being that smallpox, in whatever degree, causes a fermentation of\r\nthe mass of the blood.\r\n\r\nA year after this, in 1715, there was published in London _An Essay on\r\nExternal Remedies_, of which the 37th chapter was “Of the Variolae or\r\nSmall Pox, the manner of ingrafting or giving them, and of their Cure.”\r\nThe author was Peter Kennedy, Chir. Med., a Scot of good but impoverished\r\nfamily, who had spent several years in various parts of Europe visiting\r\nthe schools of medicine and surgery, and had found his way to\r\nConstantinople[871]. His account of the engrafting of smallpox, which he\r\nhad seen or heard of there, differs somewhat from that of Timoni, whom he\r\njust refers to: “Dr Timoni, a Grecian who resides there, had taken or\r\nfollowed this same method with his two sisters a little before my arrival\r\nat Constantinople.”\r\n\r\nKennedy says that engrafting the smallpox was practised in the\r\nPeloponnesus or Morea, “and at this present time is very much used both in\r\nTurkey and Persia, where they give it in order to prevent its more severe\r\neffects by the early knowledge of its coming; as also probably to prevent\r\nthem being troubled with it a second time.” In Persia, however, the\r\nsmallpox was taken internally in a dose of dried powder. In Constantinople\r\nthe matter was inserted at scarifications upon the forehead, wrists, and\r\nankles. After eight or ten days the smallpox came forward in a kindly\r\nmanner, and not nearly so numerous as if naturally taken. “The greatest\r\nobjection commonly proposed is, whether or not it hinders the patient from\r\nbeing infected a second time. But, in answer to this, it is advanced that\r\nwe do rarely or never find any to have been troubled with this distemper\r\ntwice in the same manner or the same fulness of malignity”--i.e. we rarely\r\nfind this in the natural way.\r\n\r\nKennedy’s object was, not to recommend the engrafting of smallpox in\r\nEngland, but to show how easily distempers or contagions, “as well as\r\nmedicines,” may be communicated to the blood from the surface of the body:\r\n“and this is more confirmed by some of the country people in Italy, in the\r\nmore remote parts from towns, so also in some parts of the highlands of\r\nScotland, where they infect their children by rubbing them with a kindly\r\npock, as they term it.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Timoni’s essay in the _Philosophical Transactions_ had stirred\r\nup Sir Hans Sloane to make farther inquiries[872]. He applied to the\r\nBritish consul at Smyrna, Dr Sherrard, who was fortunately able to get\r\ninformation at first hand from an old Smyrna colleague, Dr Pylarini,\r\nconsul for Venice, who had practised inoculation at Constantinople in the\r\nfirst years of the century. Pylarini, who had retired to Venice, was\r\ninduced to draw up an account of what he knew of the beginnings and\r\noriginal methods of engrafting, which was printed at Venice, with a\r\ndedication to Sherrard, in 1715, and at once copied into the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_[873]. This, the most trustworthy account of\r\nthe Constantinople practice, ignores the earlier essay of Timoni\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nPylarini carries the authentic history of the practice at Constantinople\r\nback to the year 1701. Its history before that was obscure; but it is most\r\ncertain, he says, that it began in Greece, more particularly in Thessaly,\r\nand crept gradually from place to place until it reached Constantinople,\r\nwhere it attracted little notice for several years, being rarely practised\r\nand only among the lower class. A noble Greek having spoken of it to him\r\nin 1701, with a view to the protection of his children from the epidemic\r\nthen raging, Pylarini had to confess his entire ignorance of it, but being\r\nat the Greek’s house four days after he there met a Greek woman who\r\nexpounded the practice clearly in detail and gave him many instances of\r\npersons who had gone through it safely. Pylarini inquired into some of\r\nthese cases and found them to be genuine; but in that great city he could\r\nnot search them all out. Soon after this interview, the woman came and\r\noperated on the four children of the rich Greek, of whom the three younger\r\nhad a very mild disease, but the eldest a severe attack, which nearly cost\r\nher life. Many other rich Greek families followed suit, so that, says\r\nPylarini in 1715, “every one wishes to have the advantage of\r\ntransplantation.” He adds, however, that “the Turks have hitherto\r\nneglected it.” He confirms Timoni in saying that the pocks raised by\r\ntransplantation were nearly always of the distinct kind and few in\r\nnumber--ten to twenty or thirty, rarely a hundred, very rarely two\r\nhundred,--although he does not reach Timoni’s minimum of “two or three,”\r\nor the pustules only at the punctured spots.\r\n\r\nThese accounts from Constantinople, printed in London in 1714, 1715 and\r\n1716 were regarded, says Douglass, “as virtuoso amusements[874]” until the\r\nspring of 1721, when inoculation began to be tried tentatively in London,\r\nand in a bold and confident way during the very same weeks at Boston, New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nDr Pitcairn, of Edinburgh, had received an account of inoculation from\r\nBellini, an Italian physician, who had read Pylarini’s essay. Douglass\r\nsays that Pitcairn “was very fond of it, but could not persuade himself to\r\nventure it in practice[875].” Sometime in March, 1721, one à Castro had\r\nissued in London a pamphlet on inoculation, full of inaccuracies and of no\r\nmoment[876]. In a lecture on the plague given at the College of Physicians\r\non the 17th of April, 1721, Dr Walter Harris made a passing reference to\r\nthe Constantinople practice of engrafting smallpox[877]; and shortly after\r\nthat, or shortly before, the Lady Mary Wortley Montagu set about having\r\nher younger child inoculated in London, her elder child having been\r\ninoculated at Constantinople three or four years before. This lady had, in\r\n1717, accompanied her husband as ambassador to the Porte, where the\r\nembassy remained about a year. During her residence at Pera she heard of\r\nthe Greek practice of engrafting or transplanting the smallpox; the French\r\nambassador had said in pleasantry to her: “They take the smallpox here by\r\nway of diversion, as they take the waters in other countries.” According\r\nto her information, there was a set of old women who made it their\r\nbusiness to perform the operation every autumn, in the month of September,\r\nwhen the great heat is abated. People send to one another to know if any\r\nof their family has a mind to have the smallpox; they make parties for\r\nthis purpose, and when they are met (commonly fifteen or sixteen together)\r\nthe old woman comes with a nut-shell full of matter. Every year thousands\r\nundergo the operation (but according to the information of the British\r\nembassy in 1755 not more than twenty in a year, which may perhaps mean\r\nthat it had fallen into disuse[878]). There is no example of anyone that\r\nhas died of it. She intended to have it performed upon her little son, and\r\nhad patriotic visions of bringing “this useful invention” into fashion in\r\nEngland. Accordingly her boy, aged five, was inoculated in March, 1717/18,\r\nby a Greek woman, under the direction of Maitland, a Scots surgeon who\r\nattended the embassy. The child suffered very little inconvenience and,\r\naccording to Maitland, “had about an hundred pox all upon his body.”\r\n\r\nLady Mary returned to London in 1718; but it was not until some three\r\nyears after, in the spring of 1721, that she stirred the matter again.\r\nWhether it was that she herself was the cause of the talk about\r\ninoculation in London in April, 1721, or that she merely had the subject\r\nbrought back to her mind by the essay of à Castro, the lecture by Harris,\r\nor by what others were saying, she sent sometime in April for Maitland,\r\nwho had assisted at the inoculation of her elder child at Pera, with a\r\nview to having the operation done on the younger, who was now four or five\r\nyears old. In a week or two Maitland found suitable smallpox matter and\r\nengrafted the child on both arms; on the tenth night she was a little\r\nfeverish, but the smallpox began to appear next morning and in a few days\r\nshe was perfectly recovered. Three physicians of the College visited the\r\ncase, as well as several ladies and other persons of distinction. One of\r\nthose physicians, Dr Keith, resolved to have a boy of his own, aged six,\r\nengrafted, which was done by Maitland on both arms on the 11th of May,\r\n1721, five ounces of blood having been drawn before the operation.\r\n\r\nAmong Lady Mary’s intimates was the Princess of Wales, who became\r\ninterested in the project for the sake of her own children[879]. She\r\nproposed to the king (George I.) that he should remit the capital sentence\r\nof six Newgate felons on condition that they would submit to be\r\ninoculated. The king consulted Sir Hans Sloane, who applied to Dr Terry of\r\nEnfield, formerly in practice at Constantinople. Terry’s report was that\r\nnot more than one in eight hundred had died from the effects of\r\ninoculation in Turkey. The upshot was that the six Newgate convicts, three\r\nmen and three women, were inoculated by Maitland on the 9th of August,\r\n1721, in the presence of several eminent physicians, surgeons, Turkey\r\nmerchants, and others. The matter was inserted on both arms and on the\r\nright leg of each, and the insertion was repeated on the arms of five of\r\nthem three days after. Dr Mead, having heard that the Chinese procured\r\nsmallpox by stuffing the matter up their noses, got a pardon for a seventh\r\nconvict under sentence of death, a young woman, on condition that she\r\nwould submit to a pledget of cotton dipped in smallpox matter being\r\ninserted in her nostril: it produced, besides a fair smallpox, much\r\nsevere pain along the Schneiderian membrane and the frontal sinuses, and\r\nwas not thought a satisfactory experiment. The trial upon the other six\r\nwas reassuring; they all escaped with the slightest possible eruption;\r\n“the most that anyone had was sixty pustules.”\r\n\r\nThe next step was on the part of the Princess of Wales, who procured the\r\ninoculation of six charity children of the parish of St James’s. Four of\r\nthem had smallpox “very favourably”; one did not have it at all, “having\r\nevidently had the smallpox before”; and the sixth had not only the\r\nprolonged effects of inoculation, but also an attack of the natural\r\nsmallpox, of a favourable kind, eleven weeks after. This experiment was\r\nfollowed by the inoculation of five more hospital children, from eight to\r\nfourteen weeks old, of whom three had no effects, their bodies being\r\n“morbid.” The Princess of Wales was at length resolved in April, 1722, to\r\nrun the risk of the operation on her two daughters, the princess Amelia,\r\naged eleven, and the princess Caroline, aged nine, being urged by the fact\r\nthat another daughter, the princess Anne, afterwards princess royal of\r\nOrange, had just had the natural smallpox so dangerously that Sloane\r\nfeared for her life. The inoculations were done on the 19th of April, by\r\nserjeant-surgeon Amyand under the direction of Sir Hans Sloane. What\r\npassed between that physician and the king shows at once the apprehension\r\nof danger from a novel operation and the temper in which it was\r\nundertaken:\r\n\r\n    “I told his Majesty,” says Sloane, “that it was impossible to be\r\n    certain but that, raising such a commotion in the blood, there might\r\n    happen dangerous accidents not foreseen; but he replied that such\r\n    might, and had happened, to persons who had lost their lives by\r\n    bleeding in a pleurisy, and taking physic in any distemper, let never\r\n    so much care be taken. I told his Majesty that I thought this to be\r\n    the same case; and the matter was concluded upon, and succeeded as\r\n    usual, without any danger during the operation, or the least ill\r\n    symptom or disorder since.”\r\n\r\nThe news of the successful inoculation of the two princesses had hardly\r\ntime to create a vogue for the practice, when there came word, in the same\r\nmonth of April, of the death by inoculation of the Earl of Sunderland’s\r\nson, aged two and a half, and of Lord Bathurst’s footman, aged nineteen.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the autumn of 1721, Maitland had gone down to Hertford,\r\nwhere smallpox would seem to have been more rife than elsewhere, and had\r\ndone several inoculations. In the family of a Quaker, near Hertford, an\r\ninfant of two and a half years developed no more than twenty pustules,\r\nwhich lasted only three or four days; but six domestics of the house, four\r\nmen and two maids, “who all in their turn were wont to hug and caress this\r\nchild whilst under the operation and the pustules were out upon her”\r\n(Maitland), caught natural smallpox in varying degrees of severity, some\r\nof them having a narrow escape, while one of the maids died.\r\n\r\nThe question that people were really anxious about was the immediate risk\r\nto the inoculated; and as there were occasional fatalities, especially to\r\nthe age of childhood, inoculation made little progress. In the first year\r\nof its trial in England it was done on the greatest scale by Dr Nettleton,\r\nof Halifax, whose practice remains for more particular notice. Apart from\r\nhis cases, which numbered sixty-one, the following are all that were known\r\nin England from the month of April, 1721, to the end of 1722[880]:\r\n\r\n  By Mr Amyand, surgeon, London                     17\r\n  \"  Mr Maitland, surgeon, London and elsewhere     57\r\n  \"  Dr Dover, London                                4\r\n  \"  Mr Weymish, London                              3\r\n  \"  Rev.

Maitland\r\nhad also 16 cases in Scotland. Sir Thomas Lyttelton had 4 at Hagley. All\r\nthe known cases in those two years, including Nettleton’s at Halifax, came\r\nto 256, with four deaths of somewhat conspicuous persons. In 1727 the\r\ninoculations fell to 87, and in 1728 to 37. The total in eight years was\r\n897, with 17 deaths. For the next ten or twelve years none were heard of\r\nin Britain. The check, however, was only temporary. The practice revived,\r\nextended among the rich, at length reached the common people in some\r\ncounties, and gave rise to important developments of scientific doctrine.\r\nThe greater these developments the more interesting the origins, which we\r\nshall now examine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe popular Origins of Inoculation.\r\n\r\nSix years before the Greek inoculation was tried in London, Kennedy, the\r\ntravelled Scot, had compared the Constantinople practice with one that he\r\nknew of in his native country: “So also in some parts of the highlands of\r\nScotland they infect their children by rubbing them with a kindly pock.”\r\nThis indigenous Scots practice was confirmed by Professor Monro, the\r\nfirst, of Edinburgh, in 1765:\r\n\r\n    “When the smallpox appears favourable in one child of a family, the\r\n    parents generally allow commerce of their other children with the one\r\n    in the disease; nay, I am assured that in some of the remote highland\r\n    parts of this country it has been an old practice of parents whose\r\n    children have not had the smallpox to watch for an opportunity of some\r\n    child having a good mild smallpox, that they may communicate the\r\n    disease to their own children by making them bedfellows to those in\r\n    it, and by tying worsted threads wet with the pocky matter round their\r\n    wrists.”\r\n\r\nAnd, to make it clear that this was not the same as the method afterwards\r\nused of procuring the smallpox, he adds that the latter was not known in\r\nScotland until Maitland introduced it, in 1726[881]. In Wales the curious\r\npractice of buying the smallpox was found to be indigenous[882]. One young\r\nwoman in a village near Milford Haven testified in 1722 that, some eight\r\nor nine years before, she had bought twenty pocky scabs of one in the\r\nsmallpox, and had held them in her hand, with the result that she sickened\r\nwith the infection in ten or twelve days and had upwards of thirty large\r\npustules in her face and elsewhere--at least ten more than she had\r\nbargained for. A schoolboy of Oswestry, who had since become an attorney\r\nand must have known the nature of an affidavit, bought, as he positively\r\naffirmed, for three-pence of a certain lady twelve pustules of smallpox\r\n(at a farthing each), and rubbed the matter into his hand with the back of\r\nhis pocket-knife; a sore remained on the hand as well as pockpits in his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing remarkable in these methods of procuring smallpox except\r\nan occasional element of superstition or freak. It was not unusual in\r\nEngland for educated persons to let smallpox go through all their children\r\nafter it had attacked one of them, just as it is regarded an economy by\r\nmany to have done with the measles. On 15 September, 1685, Evelyn\r\ntravelling to Portsmouth in the company of Pepys, stopped to make a call\r\nat Bagshot at the house of Mrs Graham, a former maid of honour to the\r\nqueen. “Her eldest son was now sick of the smallpox, but in a likely way\r\nto recover, and others of her children ran about and among the infected,\r\nwhich she said she let them do on purpose that they might whilst young\r\npass that fatal disease she fancied they were to undergo one time or\r\nother, and that this would be for the best.” It would be for the best\r\nbecause children from five to ten or fifteen (the older writers said even\r\ninfants) ran far less risk from the attack than at the higher ages, and\r\nseldom died of it.\r\n\r\nSimilar means of procuring smallpox for children were used in other\r\ncountries. La Motraye, who rode through the Caucasus in 1712, was told\r\nthat children, to give them the smallpox, were placed in the same bed with\r\none who had it, the mothers sometimes carrying them a whole day’s journey\r\nto any village where they heard of someone being attacked. He professes\r\nalso to have seen a child of four inoculated with smallpox matter at five\r\nplaces (the region of the heart, the pit of the stomach, the navel, the\r\nright wrist and the left foot) by an old woman who used “three needles\r\ntied together[883].” The idea of barter was widely spread in those\r\npractices of procuring smallpox on favourable terms. We have seen that the\r\nWelsh had it. Bruce found it in his travels to the sources of the\r\nNile[884]. African negroes are known also to have carried with them to the\r\nWest Indies the practice of “buying the yaws,” which is also a contagious\r\nand inoculable disease of the skin. The earliest medical notices of buying\r\nthe smallpox come from Poland in 1671 and 1677. A case having been\r\npublished in the _Miscellanea Curiosa_ of the Imperial German Academy, in\r\nwhich a quartan ague was alleged to have been got rid of by transferring\r\nit to a brute animal, Dr Vollgnad, of Warsaw wrote: “There is a similar\r\nsuperstition not uncommon among our nurses, who instruct the children\r\nunder their charge to buy for a few farthings a certain number of pocks\r\nfrom one infected with the smallpox, in the belief that those who purchase\r\nthat disagreeable commodity will be affected with a more scanty eruption\r\nand will be the sooner freed from the disease and with the less\r\nrisk[885].” Six years after, Dr Simon Schultz, of Thorn, physician to the\r\nking of Poland, wrote that the same practice of buying the smallpox\r\nobtained also in that part of Poland: “What I have first to remark,” he\r\nsays, “is that, in most cases if not in all, those infants that buy of the\r\ninfected (whether in their proper persons or through others), while they\r\nmay have few pocks, yet fall into a more serious illness than otherwise\r\n(_gravius reliquis decumbant_): which I remember to have happened to my\r\nyounger brother Johannes, to say nothing of others[886].”\r\n\r\nThese early references to buying the smallpox were made _à propos_ of the\r\n17th century practice of sympathetic transference of disease from one to\r\nanother, or from man to brute, or to plants, stones, holes in the ground,\r\netc.[887], and were published as instances of “a similar superstition.”\r\nThe case of a transferred ague which called them forth had been sent to\r\nthe _Curiosa_ of the Academy by Thomas Bartholin, the celebrated anatomist\r\nof Copenhagen. Ten years before, he had written in the _Theatrum\r\nSympatheticum Auctum_[888] (to which also Dr Sylvester Rattray, of\r\nGlasgow, and Sir Kenelm Digby contributed): “I disclose a great mystery of\r\nnature. The transplantation of diseases is a stupendous remedy, by means\r\nof which the ailments of this or that person are transferred to a brute\r\nanimal, or to another person, or to some inanimate thing”--various methods\r\nbeing instanced. He returned to the subject in 1673 under the title of the\r\nTransplantation of Disease, the name by which Pylarini first described the\r\nengrafting of smallpox[889]. It was the transfusion of blood, a foible of\r\nthe time, especially at the Royal Society in London, which set Bartholin\r\nto his second essay. He expected that health, in the one case, or disease\r\nin the other, might be transplanted to another’s veins with the blood. It\r\nwould be an incomparable addition to the amenities of life to be able to\r\ndraw off in a syringe the diseased blood of a familiar friend and bring it\r\nto a better coction by one’s own juices[890].\r\n\r\nBartholin discovered the germ of these scientific developments in the\r\nscape-goat of the Israelites and in the miracle of the swine of\r\nGadara[891]. In his own doctrine of transplantation, others in turn have\r\nfound the germ of inoculation, Pylarini having actually adopted the 17th\r\ncentury name, with the proviso that the transplantation of smallpox was\r\nnot sympathetic but _res vera mera pura_. The older idea of transplanting\r\nsmallpox was to get rid of it. “Some persons in the smallpox,” says\r\nSlatholm, of Buntingford, in 1657, “keep a sheep or a wether beside them\r\nin the chamber, those animals being apt to receive the envenomed matter\r\nand to draw it to themselves[892].” The developments of folk-lore are\r\nerratic; one thing leads to another, but not necessarily in a logical\r\nsequence. Transference had somehow become the inoculation which Pylarini\r\nfirst found in the practice of a woman from the Morea or from Bosnia,\r\nbeing still in its superstitious stage. The woman drew blood and rubbed\r\nthe smallpox matter into the bleeding points; but whether she did so with\r\na physiological or a symbolical intent we shall probably never know. She\r\ntold Dr Le Duc[893], who submitted to inoculation at her hands, that she\r\nhad received the secret from the Virgin; during the operation she muttered\r\nprayers to the Virgin, and, on finishing it, requested an oblation of two\r\nwax candles to be sent to the shrine of the Virgin her patroness in\r\nThessaly. She pricked the skin of the face at the four points which are\r\ntouched in making the sign of the Cross, and at the points of the hands\r\nand feet which are pierced by the nails in the Crucifix. Voltaire says\r\nthat Lady Mary Wortley Montagu’s chaplain objected to inoculation because\r\nit was an un-Christian practice. He must have been strangely ill-informed\r\nif he did so; for at Constantinople it was practised by the Christians\r\nonly and not at all by the Mussulmans, who, by Kennedy’s account, were\r\nsomewhat doubtful of its utility.\r\n\r\nPylarini and Timoni very properly dropped the symbolism of the Greek\r\nwoman, and inserted the matter at any convenient spot, choosing usually\r\nthe skin of the forearm. Therewith they took the practice under\r\nscientific protection. At the same time Pylarini was careful to explain\r\nthat this transference of disease, although he called it by Bartholin’s\r\nold name of “transplantation,” was a real thing, and in no way akin to the\r\nsympathetic or magnetic transference whose name it bore. A real thing it\r\nundoubtedly was: a visible effect did follow in most cases--some ten, or\r\ntwenty or thirty watery pimples on the skin. The effect being thus real,\r\nPylarini and Timoni laid down at the outset the doctrine that the smallpox\r\nmatter inserted in minute quantity was a ferment, which produced an\r\nebullition in the mass of the blood. The common people, who had been\r\nprocuring the smallpox for their children in other ways than by puncture\r\nand insertion, also knew that the transplanting was a real thing: it was\r\nsmallpox, and nothing else, that they designed to procure, peradventure it\r\nmight be mild smallpox.\r\n\r\nWhile Pylarini used the name of Transplantation, Timoni used the name of\r\nInoculation. Both names were figures of speech taken from the gardener’s\r\nart. Inoculation, or ineying, was a form of grafting, the taking of the\r\n“eye” or resting-bud of one kind of fruit-tree and fixing it upon the\r\nstock of another kind. The effect of a graft upon a fruit-tree is one of\r\nthe most remarkable in nature: the incorporation of a bud from a nearly\r\nallied species at a particular part of the stock causes the whole tree to\r\nassume some characters of the other tree, the change being greatest in the\r\nfruit. An effect at once so real, so useful, and so familiar could not\r\nfail to take hold of the imagination. Accordingly we find the ineying or\r\ngrafting of trees used in a correct figure, as in Hamlet’s “for virtue\r\ncannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it.” Between a\r\nfruit-tree modified as to its fruit by the permanent incorporation of a\r\nstrange shoot, and an animal body infected of purpose with diseased\r\nmatter, there is no very exact analogy. Figurative names, as well as\r\nmetaphors, are apt to be mixed ideas. Correct science avoids the one vice,\r\nas correct style avoids the other. Transplantation had in any case too\r\nmany fanciful associations to be retained as the name for the new practice\r\nin smallpox; inoculation, on the other hand, was still unspoiled as a\r\nmedical term, while its wonderful effects were obvious in the familiar art\r\nof the gardener.\r\n\r\nIn all the developments or modifications of this practice, the intention\r\nwas still to procure the smallpox by art. The idea of antidote or\r\ncounter-poison did not enter into it at all. Yet the idea of a\r\ncounter-poison was quite familiar, as in the following passage from a\r\nmedical writer of the time of James I.[894]:\r\n\r\n    “But here a great doubt and controversie may arise: whether, as\r\n    sometimes we see one poyson to be the expeller of another poyson, so\r\n    in like sort, whether one stinking savour, and graveolent or ill\r\n    odour, and vapour of some pestilent breath or ayre, may bee the proper\r\n    amulet or preservative against any such poyson, to bee hanged about\r\n    the necke: for at this time let it bee granted (to please some) that\r\n    tabacco is of no good smell or sent, and that it is a little\r\n    poysonous. For wee see some daily in the time of any generall or\r\n    grievous infection of the plague, for avoidance thereof, and for\r\n    preservation sake, will smell unto the stinking savour of some\r\n    loathsome privie, or filthy camerine and sinke; and this they make\r\n    reckoning is one of the best counter-poysons that may be devised\r\n    against any pestiferous infection: for their nature being inured to\r\n    these, they will afterwards not seeme to passe for any pestilent\r\n    malignitie of the ayre, and dare boldly adventure without any\r\n    prejudice, or impeachment to their health, into any place or companie\r\n    whatsoever. And to perswade us the more easily to this, they object to\r\n    us for example sake, those women that spend their dayes continually in\r\n    hospitals for pilgrims, and for poore travellers, who are accustomed\r\n    to every abominable savour of the sicke; whereof we shall never see,\r\n    or very seldome, any of them either to be taken or die with any\r\n    pestiferous infection though never so dangerous.”\r\n\r\nWhile he admits these to be instances of counter-poisons having a\r\nprophylactic effect against epidemic sickness, he denies, what some had\r\nmaintained, that “either the French Pockes or the quartan ague is a\r\n_Superseder_ of the plague[895].”\r\n\r\n\r\nResults of the first Inoculations; the Controversy in England.\r\n\r\nThus far we have traced the rise of inoculation as an idea. It was one way\r\nof procuring the smallpox, which had gradually arisen out of other\r\nfanciful or real modes of infection. The populace for long retained a\r\npreference for giving their children the smallpox by exposing them to the\r\ncontagion of it; in the last quarter of the 18th century, Haygarth found\r\nthe common people of Chester still following the earlier practice of\r\ninviting the smallpox in the natural way[896]. It is even more remarkable\r\nthat Huxham, the ablest epidemiologist in England during the first period\r\nof inoculation, preferred that children should take the disease naturally,\r\nbelieving that they might be so “prepared” to receive the seeds of it by\r\nthe breath as to have always a sufficiently mild but effective dose of it.\r\nStill, the insertion of smallpox matter at a puncture or wound of the arm\r\nappeared to many to have advantages over the natural way. In London it was\r\ntaken up by the Court, by the Court doctors, and by the Royal Society, the\r\nleading physicians in favour of it having been Sloane, Mead, Arbuthnot and\r\nJurin. It appears that Freind, a more learned physician than any of these,\r\nwas adverse to it. It was to him that Wagstaffe, physician to St\r\nBartholomew’s Hospital, dedicated a hostile essay on inoculation when it\r\nwas new; and Freind himself brought into his _History of Physic_,\r\npublished in 1725-26, the following sarcastic passage upon John of\r\nGaddesden, whom he regarded as a high-placed charlatan:\r\n\r\n    “He had an infallible plaster and caustick for a rupture; could cure a\r\n    cancer from an outward cause with red dock. And if he had lived in our\r\n    day, he would, I don’t question, have been at the head of the\r\n    Inoculators; and in this case the position he lays down, contrary to\r\n    the experience of the best physicians, that one may have the smallpox\r\n    _twice_, might have served him in good stead for salvo’s upon many\r\n    occasions.”\r\n\r\n--which means that, in Freind’s opinion, the inoculated smallpox was no\r\nsecurity against a subsequent attack in the natural way[897].\r\n\r\nWagstaffe, in his printed letter to Freind, sums up the objections to\r\ninoculated smallpox as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Some have had the distemper not at all, others to a small degree,\r\n    others the worst sort, and some have died of it. I have given\r\n    instances of those who have had it after inoculation in the common\r\n    way; and consequently as it is hazardous, so ’twill neither answer the\r\n    main design of preventing the distemper for the future. I have\r\n    considered what the effects may be of inoculating on an ill habit of\r\n    body, and how destructive it may prove to spread a distemper that is\r\n    contagious: and how widely at length the authors in this subject\r\n    disagree among themselves, and how little they have seen of the\r\n    practice:--all which seem to me to be just and necessary consequences\r\n    of these new-fangled notions, as well as convincing reasons for the\r\n    disuse of the practice[898].”\r\n\r\nThese objections were shared by several, including Blackmore, Clinch, and\r\nMassey, the apothecary to Christ’s Hospital.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Jurin, who took the lead in defending inoculation,\r\nreduced the issues to two[899]:\r\n\r\n1. Whether the distemper given by inoculation be an effectual security to\r\nthe patient against his having the smallpox afterwards in the natural way?\r\n\r\n2. Whether the hazard of inoculation be considerably less than that of the\r\nnatural smallpox?\r\n\r\nThese questions, thus put forward as of equal moment, did not receive\r\nequally full handling. Jurin dismissed the former question in a brief\r\nsentence: “Our experience, so far as it goes, has hitherto strongly\r\nfavoured the affirmative side”--a conditional assent which became an\r\nabsolute affirmative after a short time. Having thus disposed of the\r\nquestion which has all the scientific or pathological interest, he turned\r\nwith his whole energy to give a precise arithmetical demonstration of what\r\nno one could doubt, namely, that inoculated smallpox was many times less\r\nfatal than smallpox in the natural way,--having got the idea of such a\r\ncomparison from Nettleton as well as a large part of the statistics\r\nnecessary for it. Jurin’s statement of the questions at issue, and his\r\nmanner of answering them, became the received mode, so much so that even\r\ntowards the end of the eighteenth century one finds capable medical men\r\ncontrasting the almost infinitesimal mortality from inoculation, as then\r\npractised, with the high mortality from the natural smallpox, as if that\r\nwere the question at issue. The permanent impression in favour of\r\ninoculation made by Jurin’s arithmetic was shown a generation later, when\r\nDr George Baker pronounced an eulogy upon him in the Harveian Oration\r\nbefore the College of Physicians in 1761[900]. “It was his special glory,”\r\nsaid the orator, to have “confirmed the practice of inoculation by his\r\nexperiments and his authority.” There was only one experiment, and it was\r\na remarkable one. The Princess of Wales had begged George I. to pardon six\r\nNewgate criminals under sentence of death on condition that they would\r\nsubmit to be inoculated. It was assumed that those six had not had\r\nsmallpox in infancy or childhood, and Sloane, relating the facts in a\r\nletter to Ranby some years after, does in fact call them “six condemned\r\ncriminals who had not had the smallpox[901].” The concurrence of six\r\npersons belonging to the criminal classes and about to be hanged together\r\nin Newgate, of whom none had already gone through the common infantile\r\ntrouble of London and other large towns, was singular. They were\r\ninoculated, and it was found that they had escaped the death penalty on\r\nvery easy terms: John Alcock, aged twenty, had most smallpox, but even he\r\nhad “not more than sixty pustules”; Richard Evans, aged nineteen, had\r\nnone, but his antecedents were inquired into, and then it was found that\r\nhe had had smallpox in gaol only six months before. One of the others, a\r\nwoman named Elizabeth, was chosen for the grand crucial experiment. Sir\r\nHans Sloane and Dr Steigerthal clubbed together to pay her expenses to\r\nHertford where smallpox was then very prevalent; thither Elizabeth went\r\nand ministered among the sick; she lay in bed with one in the smallpox, or\r\nshe lay in bed with various in the smallpox; at all events she exposed\r\nherself to contagion and did not catch it, according to certificates from\r\nthe woman she lodged with and from another person, which certificates were\r\npublished with much formality and lawyer-like precision[902]. This was the\r\nsingle experiment in which Jurin had any part. What were the chances of\r\nher having had smallpox in childhood? What were the chances of her knowing\r\nanything about it, or telling the truth about it if she knew? (One of her\r\nfellows in the experiment upon the pardoned convicts had smallpox only six\r\nmonths before, but the fact was not discovered until it was wanted.) What\r\nwere the chances of her taking smallpox at Hertford, supposing that she\r\nhad hitherto escaped it? These questions do not appear to have been\r\ndebated[903].\r\n\r\nSuch was the experiment by which Jurin “confirmed the practice of\r\ninoculation.” As for his authority, it was doubtless considerable; but it\r\nwas more as a follower of the Newtonian mathematics than as a pathologist\r\nor physician, and most of all as one of the secretaries of the Royal\r\nSociety in the last years of Newton’s presidency, that he spoke with\r\nauthority[904]. His influence, such as it was, availed little. The\r\npractice of inoculation fell into total disuse in England after a few\r\nyears’ trial, so that in 1728 Jurin himself was prepared to see it\r\n“exploded.”\r\n\r\nThe principal reason of inoculation having been tried upon decreasing\r\nnumbers in England after the first year or two, and of its having been\r\ndropped absolutely for a time, was the death of some persons of good\r\nfamily, both adults and children--a sacrifice of life which could not but\r\nseem gratuitous. Those deaths were not from the fulness of the eruption\r\nbut from anomalous effects. When inoculation began in London in 1721, it\r\nwas according to the Greek method of inserting a minute quantity of matter\r\nat two or more places. In the case of the Newgate felons, Maitland had\r\nreason to do the inoculations over again after three days, being\r\ndissatisfied with the appearance of the original punctures. They are\r\nadmitted to have had a slight disease (the man who had most had only some\r\nsixty pustules on his whole body), so that Dr Wagstaffe, who went to see\r\nthem, said in his letter to Dr Freind: “Upon the whole, Sir, in the cases\r\nmentioned, there was nothing like the smallpox, either in symptoms,\r\nappearances, advance of the pustules, or the course of the distemper.”\r\nMany of the other early cases had likewise a slight eruption; when numbers\r\nare given, the pocks are “not more than eleven to eighteen” (as in\r\nMaitland’s case of Prince Frederick at Hanover in 1724), or “not above\r\ntwenty in all upon her” (as in Maitland’s case of a child near Hertford,\r\nin 1721). Of the first six charity children inoculated, one had no\r\neruption; of the next five, three had no smallpox from inoculation. The\r\ncases that died after inoculation during the first seven years of the\r\npractice--seventeen in England and Scotland and two in Dublin, most of\r\nthem children--owed the fatal result for the most part to some peculiar\r\nprostration or lowered vitality, in two cases actually to pyaemia, the\r\neruption being kept back altogether or but feebly thrown out[905]. This\r\nwas the danger of arbitrarily procuring the smallpox which Dr Schultz\r\nremarked upon in 1677, with reference to the Polish practice of “buying”\r\nthe disease; most, if not all the cases known to him, although they may\r\nhave had few pocks, yet fell into more serious illness (_gravius reliquis\r\ndecumbant_). The risk of arbitrarily forcing infection upon a child at a\r\ntime when it might not be ready for it, or in a position to deal with it\r\nin its blood, was afterwards recognized, and was provided against in the\r\nlong and tedious preparation which the subject for inoculation had to\r\nundergo.\r\n\r\nWhile those in England who followed Maitland in inoculating after the\r\nGreek fashion produced for the most part an infinitesimal number of\r\npustules or watery pimples, there were others at a distance from London\r\nwho inoculated by a method of their own and gave their patients a more\r\nreal smallpox. The chief of these were Dr Thomas Nettleton of Halifax, and\r\nDr Zabdiel Boylston, of Boston, New England[906]. Nettleton made a long\r\nincision through the whole thickness of the skin of one arm and of the\r\nopposite leg, and laid therein a small piece of cotton soaked in smallpox\r\nmatter, which he secured in the wound with a plaister for twenty-four\r\nhours. Boylston says: “The Turkey way of scarifying and applying the\r\nnutshell &c., I soon left off, and made an incision through the true\r\nskin,” the rest also of his procedure being the same as Nettleton’s. And\r\njust as those two inoculators devised for themselves a more real method of\r\ngiving the smallpox by insertion, taking means to ensure the absorption of\r\nthe matter into the blood, so they procured in many cases, although not in\r\nall, an eruption of pustules on the skin which came near to being the same\r\nas that of natural smallpox of the average discrete type.\r\n\r\nIn the Boston practice, “the number of the pustules is not alike in all;\r\nin some they are very few; in others they amount to an hundred; yea in\r\nmany they amount unto several hundreds, frequently unto more than what the\r\naccounts from the Levant say is usual there[907].” Nettleton’s account,\r\nwhich was printed in the same number of the _Philosophical Transactions_\r\nas that from New England, says of the pustules on the skin at large: “The\r\nnumber was very different: in some not above ten or twenty, most\r\nfrequently from fifty to two hundred; and some have had more than could\r\nwell be numbered, but never of the confluent sort.... They commonly come\r\nout very round and florid, and many times rose as large as any I have\r\nobserved of the natural sort, going off with a yellow crust or scab as\r\nusual[908].”\r\n\r\nThe smallpox procured by inoculation in these English and American trials\r\nwas thus a more real form of that disease than at Constantinople; compared\r\nwith the number of pustules given by Timoni and Pylarini, the Boston and\r\nHalifax numbers are multiplied ten times.\r\n\r\nNettleton thus expressed his belief that inoculated smallpox saved from\r\nthe natural disease, at the same time grounding that belief on the reality\r\nor substantial nature of the artificial disease:\r\n\r\n    “Some of those who have been inoculated, that are grown up, have\r\n    afterwards attended others in the smallpox, and it has often happen’d\r\n    that in families where some children have been inoculated, others have\r\n    been afterwards seized in the natural way, and they have lain together\r\n    in the same bed all the time; but we have not yet found that ever any\r\n    had the distemper twice; neither is there any reason to suppose it\r\n    possible, there being no difference that can be observed betwixt the\r\n    natural and artificial sort, but only that in the latter the pustules\r\n    are fewer in number, and all the rest of the symptoms are in the same\r\n    proportion more favourable[909].”\r\n\r\n    Nettleton returned to the question of the reality of inoculated\r\n    smallpox, which is the root of the whole matter, in his second letter,\r\n    to Jurin[910]: “The question whether the distemper raised by\r\n    inoculation is really the smallpox is not so much disputed now as it\r\n    was at first.... There is usually no manner of difference to be\r\n    observed betwixt the one sort and the other, when the number of\r\n    pustules is nearly the same; but in both there are almost infinite\r\n    degrees of the distemper according to the difference of that number.\r\n    All the variation that can be perceived of the ingrafted smallpox from\r\n    the natural is, that in the former the pustules are commonly fewer in\r\n    number, and all the rest of the symptoms are in the same proportion\r\n    more favourable. They exactly resemble what we call the distinct\r\n    sort.... It will follow as a corollary, that those who have been\r\n    inoculated are in no more danger of receiving the distemper again than\r\n    those who have had it in the ordinary way. And this is also thus far\r\n    confirmed by experience.”\r\n\r\n    It does not appear that Nettleton based so much upon the subsequent\r\n    experience as upon the antecedent probability. Thus he says of some\r\n    cases:\r\n\r\n    “These had the eruptions so imperfect as to leave me a little in\r\n    doubt, but two of these have since been sufficiently try’d by being\r\n    constantly with those who had the smallpox, without receiving any\r\n    infection; which makes me inclined to believe they will always be\r\n    secure from any danger. As to all the rest, neither I nor anybody else\r\n    who saw them did in the least question that they had the true\r\n    smallpox.”\r\n\r\nNettleton began his inoculations in and around Halifax during a\r\nconsiderable epidemic of smallpox in the winter of 1721-22, of which the\r\nfollowing figures were collected by himself (as well as statistics for\r\nLeeds, Bradford, Rochdale and other places):\r\n\r\n                                           Cases   Deaths\r\n\r\n  Halifax                                   276      43\r\n  Part of Halifax parish towards Bradford   297      59\r\n  Another part of Halifax parish            268      28\r\n\r\nIn the town of Halifax the smallpox was of a more favourable type than\r\nusual, whereas in Leeds at the same time (792 cases and 189 deaths) it was\r\nmore than usually mortal. In the country round Halifax there was more\r\nsmallpox than in the town; but the epidemic in general ceased in the\r\nspring of 1722. As the people mostly disliked the idea of inoculation,\r\nNettleton did not urge it upon them, but inoculated only the children of\r\nthose who favoured it. Down to the 22nd of April, 1722, he had inoculated\r\nabout forty, with one death; at the date of 16 June, he had done fifteen\r\nmore, his total to the end of 1722 being 61. In 1723 he did nineteen\r\ninoculations, in 1724 none, in 1725 and 1726 about forty (in an epidemic\r\nof 230 cases, and 28 deaths in Barstand Ripponden and another part of\r\nHalifax parish), and in writing to Hartley of Bury St Edmunds in 1730, he\r\ngave his total at that date as 119, from which it appears that he had\r\nceased to inoculate after 1726. His name does not appear again in the\r\ncontroversy, and it is probable that he acquiesced in the tacit verdict\r\nagainst inoculation which Jurin himself, in 1728, seemed to think was\r\nimminent.\r\n\r\nBesides this centre of inoculation in Yorkshire in the midst of epidemic\r\nsmallpox, the only other of importance in the first trials of the practice\r\nwas at Boston, New England. The smallpox epidemic there in 1721 was a very\r\nsevere one. There had been no smallpox in Boston since 1702, so that a\r\nlarge part of the population were susceptible of it. The infection was\r\nbrought by a ship from Barbados in the middle of April, 1721, and made\r\nslow progress at first, according to the following table of deaths from\r\nit[911]:\r\n\r\n_Deaths from Smallpox in Boston._\r\n\r\n1721-1722\r\n\r\n  May           1\r\n  June          8\r\n  July         20\r\n  August       26\r\n  September   101\r\n  October     402\r\n  November    249\r\n  December     31\r\n  January       6\r\n             ----\r\n  Total       844\r\n\r\nIn the course of the epidemic some 5989 persons were attacked, or more\r\nthan half the population (10,565). All the rest, save about 750, had been\r\nthrough the smallpox before. Inoculation played a very subordinate part\r\namidst these dreadful scenes of smallpox. Its instigator was the Rev. Dr\r\nCotton Mather, who had been shown by Dr Douglass the numbers of the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_ with Timoni’s and Pylarini’s papers in them.\r\nThe reverend doctor “surreptitiously” employed Douglass’s rival, Dr\r\nBoylston, to begin inoculating, in July, 1721, or a few months after the\r\nfirst trials in London. Boylston inoculated 244, whites and negroes, and\r\nadmitted the deaths of six of them, probably by inhaled infection[912].\r\nBut Douglass says:\r\n\r\n    “The precise number of those who dyed by inoculation in Boston, I am\r\n    afraid will never be known because of the crowd of the sick and dead\r\n    whilst inoculation prevailed most, the inoculator and relations\r\n    inviolably keeping the secret.... Some porters who at that time were\r\n    employed to carry the dead to their graves say that it was whispered,\r\n    in sundry houses where the dead were carried from, that the person had\r\n    been inoculated. I could name some who are suspected, but having only\r\n    hearsay and conjectural evidence, I forbear to affront the surviving\r\n    relations. I myself am certain of one more who died ‘after\r\n    inoculation’ as they express it.”\r\n\r\nHe then gives the case, which was clearly one of the natural contagion of\r\nsmallpox acquired at the same time as the inoculation. In the Charleston\r\ninoculations of 1738, which were also done in the midst of an epidemic,\r\nthere is little doubt that the fatalities were mostly from natural\r\nsmallpox which the inoculated infection had failed to anticipate or\r\nprevent. The inoculators were often in that dilemma with their fatal\r\ncases: either the inoculation had killed the patient or it had been\r\npowerless to keep off the contagion; sometimes they confess the former as\r\nan untoward accident, at other times they plead the latter, which appears\r\nto me to have been the more usual of the two in a time of epidemic\r\nsmallpox[913].\r\n\r\nDouglass, for all his bitterness against his rival Boylston, and his\r\nseverity against the extravagant assertions and loose reasoning of the\r\nfirst inoculators, was far from denying the merits of inoculation, whether\r\nin theory or in practice. “We may confidently pronounce,” he says, “that\r\nthose who have had a genuine smallpox by inoculation never can have the\r\nsmallpox again in a natural way, both by reason and experience; but there\r\nare some who have had the usual feverish symptoms, a discharge by their\r\nincisions, with a few _imperfect_ eruptions, that may be obnoxious to the\r\nsmallpox,”--of which he gives instances. In like manner Nettleton, in\r\nYorkshire, who took pains to make his smallpox a real thing, and succeeded\r\nin doing so as well as any inoculator ever did succeed, was persuaded that\r\ninoculated smallpox counted for a natural attack. He admitted only one\r\nfailure, a case at Halifax which had been inoculated without an eruption\r\nensuing and took smallpox by contagion a month after. Failures in England,\r\nin that sense, were fewer than the deaths directly from inoculation. The\r\ndeaths were freely admitted, but any alleged failure of inoculation to\r\nward off the natural smallpox was challenged, investigated, and denied, so\r\nthat Mead, writing in 1747, declared that he knew of none. There were,\r\nhowever, a few cases recorded, which appear to be authentic. One of the\r\nsix charity children inoculated at the instance of the Princess of Wales\r\nhad taken natural smallpox twelve weeks after. The child of one Degrave, a\r\nsurgeon, had a similar experience. Another familiar case was the son of a\r\nperson of distinction, inoculated on 7 May, 1724, by the Rev. Mr Johnson.\r\n\r\n    On the 14th a rash came out, on the 15th there was fever, on the 16th,\r\n    very little eruption to be seen and the fever gone, and on the 18th he\r\n    was pronounced “secure.” On that day (18th May), his sister was\r\n    inoculated in the same place, both children remaining together at the\r\n    inoculator’s house until the 2nd of June, when the boy went home. For\r\n    a day or two before the 8th of June the boy was ill, and on the 9th he\r\n    began to have smallpox in the natural way, of a good sort, the disease\r\n    keeping its natural course. He was supposed to have caught it from his\r\n    sister, who was inoculated after his own protection was over, and was\r\n    “very full of smallpox” until the 27th of May, her brother being with\r\n    her[914].\r\n\r\nAnother case of failure, which must have been known to some at the time,\r\nwas not published until some ten years after, when Deering brought it to\r\nlight[915]:\r\n\r\n    “I was an eyewitness of the inoculation of a little boy, the child of\r\n    Dr Craft, who is now a sugar-baker in the Savoy. He was inoculated by\r\n    one Ahlers under the direction of Dr Steigerthal, the late king’s\r\n    physician in ordinary; and notwithstanding the great care there was\r\n    taken in the choice of the pus, had the confluent kind severely; and\r\n    twelve months after had them naturally, and though a favourable sort,\r\n    yet was very full.”\r\n\r\nA boy aged three, the son of Mr Richards, M.P. for Bridport, was\r\ninoculated in 1743, and had fifty to sixty pocks which maturated and\r\nscabbed. About two years after (“one year ago”) he had smallpox again, the\r\npustules numbering from 200 to 300; when the eruption came out the fever\r\ndeclined and did not return. These facts are given in a letter to Dr Dod\r\nfrom Dr Brodrepp, grandfather of the child, who attended him on both\r\noccasions[916].\r\n\r\nSuch cases were not often heard of. As Mead said, “If such a thing\r\nhappened once, why do we not see it come to pass oftener?” There was,\r\nhowever, little encouragement for anyone to come forward with adverse\r\nevidence; witness the case of an unfortunate Welshman, one Jones, of\r\nOswestry, who had innocently mentioned, in writing to his son in London,\r\nthat natural smallpox had followed an inoculation done by him, on 9th\r\nAugust, 1723, and was frightened out of his wits by the _apparatus\r\ncriticus_ which Jurin brought to bear upon him[917]. Another reason why so\r\nfew failures could be discovered was that the inoculated were not kept\r\nlong in sight. A child of Dr Timoni, the first writer on inoculation, was\r\ninoculated at Constantinople in December, 1717, at the age of six months,\r\nand had an average effect, namely ten small _boutons_. She died of\r\nsmallpox in 1741, at the age of twenty-four. This failure came to light by\r\nthe vigilance of the celebrated De Haën, of Vienna, an opponent of\r\ninoculation, who had been told of it by a Scots physician at\r\nConstantinople[918].\r\n\r\nA good instance of the same thing came to light long after in the practice\r\nof the celebrated Dr Rush of Philadelphia. “I lately attended a man in the\r\nsmallpox,” he wrote to Lettsom, “whom I inoculated six-and-twenty years\r\nago. He showed me a deep and extensive scar upon his arm made by the\r\nvariolous matter”--without which evidence, and the man’s own reminder,\r\nconfirmed by his mother’s recollection, Dr Rush would probably have had no\r\nreason to believe that this particular one of his inoculations had\r\nfailed[919].\r\n\r\nIn the nature of the case, such evidence of failure would seldom be\r\nopportune. It would have needed a more dramatic presentation of these\r\ncases, and many more of them, to discredit the practice of inoculation. It\r\nwas, indeed, discredited, so much so that it was not practised at all in\r\nEngland from 1728 until about 1740; but that was owing to the disasters\r\ndirectly resulting from it. No amount of evidence as to the inoculated\r\ntaking natural smallpox afterwards could have touched the popular\r\nimagination like the following paragraphs in the London newspapers in\r\n1725:\r\n\r\n    March 16, died Mrs Eyles, niece of Sir John Eyles, alderman of London,\r\n    of the smallpox contracted by inoculation. June 17, died of the\r\n    smallpox contracted by inoculation Arthur Hill, esquire, eldest son of\r\n    Viscount Hilsborough. August 12, died of the smallpox by\r\n    inoculation--Hurst, of Salisbury, esquire.\r\n\r\nInoculation seemed hardly worth having on these terms, granting all that\r\nwas alleged of its protective power; so that it fell in England into total\r\ndisuse[920]. It came on again after a time and had a long career, at first\r\namong the richer classes, and at length among the common people, who did\r\nnot cease to use it for their children until it was made a felony by the\r\nAct of 1840. After its first brief success, it was revived about 1739-40,\r\nin consequence of highly favourable accounts from Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, and from Barbados and St Christopher. This second period of\r\ninoculation brings in certain modifications of the practice by which the\r\ncasualties of the earlier period were avoided. The danger from\r\nblood-poisoning, pyaemia, or the like, was surmounted. At the same time\r\nthe inoculated smallpox ceased to have anything of that reality, or\r\napproximation to the natural disease, which Nettleton succeeded for a time\r\nin giving to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevival of Inoculation in 1740: a New Method.\r\n\r\nAs early as the Boston inoculations of 1721, the matter had now and again\r\nbeen taken, not from a case of the natural smallpox, but from the\r\npustules of a previous inoculation[921]. But at Charleston in 1738 there\r\nreally began, doubtless in the way of empirical trial, a systematic\r\nattenuation of virus, which has had great scientific developments in our\r\ntime and has come to be considered as of the essence of the inoculation\r\nprinciple. Describing the South Carolina practice, Kilpatrick says[922]:\r\n\r\n    “Some persons were of opinion that _the pock of the inoculated_ would\r\n    be too mild to convey the disease; or, at least, that it must become\r\n    effete by a second or third transplantation. Experience manifested the\r\n    contrary. I have inoculated from those who were infected by the matter\r\n    taken from others of the inoculated, and found no defect. Mr Mowbray,\r\n    who inoculated many more than any other practitioner, assured me he\r\n    had infused matter in the fifth or sixth succession from the natural\r\n    pock, and observed no difference.... The smallest violation of the\r\n    surface, if it was stained with blood, was a sufficient entrance for\r\n    the matter, and the least matter was sufficient.”\r\n\r\nThe last point was a return to the Greek practice, and an abandonment of\r\nthe more severe method of Nettleton and Boylston.\r\n\r\nThe Charleston smallpox of 1738, imported by slave-ships from Africa,\r\nbecame extensively epidemic and mortal. It had been last in Charleston\r\nfourteen or fifteen years before, but only one or two died on that\r\noccasion, and hardly more than ten were attacked. But for that small\r\noutbreak, it had not been known in the South Carolina port for a\r\ngeneration previous to 1738. The number of victims in that year is not\r\nknown precisely. As at Boston in 1721, the epidemic dragged through the\r\nspring months, and became very extensive and mortal in the hot weather of\r\nJune and July. It was then that Mowbray began inoculating, most of the\r\nCharleston faculty being opposed to it. He was soon followed by\r\nKilpatrick, who had lost one of his children in the epidemic, and was\r\nmoved thereby to inoculate the other two. No exact account was kept of the\r\ninoculations, nor, we may be sure, of the protective effects; some said a\r\nthousand were inoculated, Kilpatrick says eight hundred, but the total of\r\nfour hundred is also given. Eight died after inoculation, six whites and\r\ntwo negresses. One child of ten months died in convulsions on the ninth\r\nday after inoculation, with few signs of smallpox; a minister, aged 40,\r\nsickened on the third or fourth day, which was too soon for the artificial\r\ndisease, and was almost certainly the effects of the inhaled virus; two\r\nother adult whites died in such circumstances as to make it doubtful\r\nwhether they died of inoculation or of coexistent natural smallpox; one\r\nnegress died of confluent smallpox, having treated herself unwisely; while\r\ntwo other children and a negress died after inoculation, of whom no\r\nparticulars are known. Besides the fatal cases after inoculation, some\r\n“had an eruption that might be called a moderate confluence”; but in these\r\ncases also it is not clear that infection was not taken in the natural\r\nway: as regards one gentlewoman who had confluent smallpox, it was not\r\ncertain in what manner she received the infection, whilst “Miss Mary\r\nRhett’s eruption did not appear until the 14th day, yet was supposed to be\r\neffected by art.” To meet such cases Kilpatrick adopted the doctrine that\r\nthere was “no precise term for the artificial eruption.” Among those\r\n“hardly dealt with” by the disease, supposed to have been given by art,\r\nwere two ladies who had their eyes permanently injured. “With regard to a\r\nsecond infection of the inoculated _who took_, this was asserted by some\r\nwho wished for it, but were as soon refuted.” Nineteen in twenty of the\r\ninoculated had an exceedingly slight eruption, so slight indeed that they\r\nthought the confinement indoors irksome and unnecessary. As to the\r\nnegroes, who had all been born in Africa (and commonly have smallpox there\r\nor in the voyage across), it was not easy, he admits, to find out whether\r\nthey had had smallpox before or not, the pits on their faces being less\r\nobvious than in whites, and the marks of other distempers easily mistaken\r\nfor them. On the whole Kilpatrick was confident that inoculation in this\r\nepidemic had saved many lives; and it was the rumour of its success,\r\ntogether with corresponding reports from the plantations in the West\r\nIndies relating the valuable lives of negroes saved, that gave a fresh\r\nimpulse to the practice in England. In 1743 Kilpatrick came to London,\r\nwhere he republished his Charleston essay, with an historical appendix,\r\nand soon got into the leading practice as an inoculator, having proceeded\r\nto the degree of M.D. and changed the spelling of his name to Kirkpatrick.\r\nWoodville says “he was esteemed the most scientific inoculator in\r\nLondon.” During the eleven years from his setting up in practice there\r\nuntil the publication of his _Analysis of Inoculation_ (1754), he had\r\nalmost certainly been applying the arm-to-arm method which he learned from\r\nMowbray in Charleston, having briefly indicated it in his first essay and\r\navowed it more explicitly in his second. The establishment of Kirkpatrick\r\nin London, to practise the Charleston method of inoculation, corresponds,\r\nas nearly as one can trace it, with the revival of the practice in the\r\nsouth of England, to the extent of some two thousand cases in the counties\r\nof Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire and Dorset. We have a glimpse of that\r\npractice in the essay on inoculation published in 1749 by Dr Frewen, of\r\nRye in Sussex[923], a physician of considerable learning (of the school of\r\nBoerhaave), whose theories of the effects of inoculation are reflected in\r\nKirkpatrick’s _Analysis_ of 1754. In 350 cases, Frewen had only one\r\nfatality, the death of a child, aged four, from worm fever on the eighth\r\nday of a discrete eruption. He still used the incision on the arm, but\r\nless deep than Nettleton’s, keeping the pledget of lint, moistened with\r\nmatter, bound upon it for twenty-four hours; also he encouraged the\r\nrendering from the incision for some weeks, giving the same reason as\r\nbefore, that “Nature by means of a continual drain is greatly aided in her\r\nattempts to throw off the matter of the disease.” In his general account\r\nof the effects of inoculation, we seem to be reading of as real symptoms\r\nand as many pocks as Nettleton described--the eruption, always of the\r\nsimple distinct kind, beginning on the 9th day, all out in three or four\r\ndays after, the pocks filling and turning yellow for the next four or five\r\ndays, then scabbing and falling, leaving temporary shallow marks. But it\r\nis clear that he had other results than these from trying new ways of\r\nprocuring matter. “Experience,” he says, “has convinced me that it is in\r\nreality of no consequence from what kind of smallpox it [the matter] is\r\nprocured.” If taken from the natural smallpox, it should be taken from\r\nripe pustules: “yet I have sometimes applied it sooner, while only a\r\nlimpid water.” Oftentimes it happened that an inoculation produced too\r\n“slight” pustules to furnish matter for the succeeding operations. The\r\nquestion then arose whether the matter rendering from the incisions on the\r\narms in these cases was merely common pus or whether it had the property\r\nof “variolosity.” This abstract quality, as it were the essence or\r\nquiddity of the pustular exanthem, was assumed to be present if the pus of\r\nthe rendering incision could be made to raise a pustule on another arm,\r\nand if the person so infected could stand exposure to natural smallpox\r\nwith impunity. One person so inoculated did have an attack of smallpox by\r\ncontagion, so that Frewen concluded that the matter used for his\r\nprotection had “run off all its variolosity.” But others inoculated with\r\nthe same, “in whom the symptoms were remarkably light, and in some few no\r\npustules at all,” were equally exposed to contagion without catching it,\r\nso that they were “judged to be secure from ever taking the smallpox\r\nagain.” Frewen’s general conclusion, if it be not very logical, is at\r\nleast modest:\r\n\r\n    “However, it may be worth the attention to reflect seriously whether\r\n    it be not highly probable, from the success attending the numbers I\r\n    have been concerned for, that inoculation has been often times a\r\n    security against taking the most dangerous kinds of the natural\r\n    smallpox.”\r\n\r\nWhether Frewen got the ideas of these novelties of method from\r\nKirkpatrick’s first account of the South Carolina practice, or struck them\r\nout for himself, it is clear that Kirkpatrick, in his next essay of 1754,\r\nhas adopted variolosity as an abstract doctrine to surmount certain\r\ndifficulties in the concrete reason. Many of his inoculated cases had only\r\na few bastard pustules of smallpox, some had none. Was their disease\r\nsmallpox? Did it warrant their future security?\r\n\r\n    “As many of the inoculated have very few pustules, and they are\r\n    sometimes disposed to scab and wither away with very little\r\n    suppuration, it might be of service to discover that the matter from\r\n    the incisions would infect. But it would be certainly satisfactory to\r\n    find it would where there was no eruption from inoculation, as its\r\n    variolosity would greatly warrant the future security of the person it\r\n    was taken from. That it is variolous is now evinced by the fact that\r\n    it infected others to the like slight degree[924].”\r\n\r\nThe movement towards attenuating the virus used for inoculation was\r\ngeneral in Europe. One of the mild methods, invented by Tronchin, of\r\nAmsterdam and afterwards of Paris, was to raise a small blister on the arm\r\nand to pass through the fluid a thread moistened with smallpox matter.\r\nThis became one of the most common continental methods and was in use\r\nuntil the beginning of the 19th century. Kirkpatrick, who went to see the\r\npractice of Tronchin, found the method by blister to produce as slight\r\neffects in the way of eruption as he describes for his own method:\r\n\r\n    “I attended and infected five poor children:--three, about seven years\r\n    old, by incision; and two, about five years old, by vesication. Of the\r\n    first three, one, a girl, had a pretty moderate but very kindly\r\n    sprinkling; the two boys very few. The two by blisters, a boy and a\r\n    girl, had rather less,--the boy Dudin, a very fair delicate little\r\n    child, not having above three or four, all which had not matter enough\r\n    to infect one patient[925].”\r\n\r\nEverywhere after the middle of the eighteenth century inoculation was\r\ncoming into fashion again. In France it was lauded by the _philosophes_,\r\nwhile it was scouted by the medical faculty. La Condamine, a mathematician\r\nwho had acquired fame by his journey to the Amazon to measure the three\r\nfirst degrees of the meridian, became interested in the subject by hearing\r\nfrom a credulous Carmelite missionary at Para how he had saved half of his\r\nIndian converts by inoculation after the other half had been destroyed by\r\nthe natural smallpox. The mathematical philosopher on his return became an\r\nenthusiast for inoculation, and twice harangued the Académie des Sciences\r\nthereon. “The practice of inoculation,” he said, “was improved during the\r\ntime of its disgrace.” What this improvement consisted in he also\r\nexplained: “Neither the eruption is essential to the natural nor the\r\npustules to the artificial smallpox: and perhaps art will one day come to\r\neffect what one hopes for and what Boerhaave and Lobb have even tried--I\r\nmean a change in the external form of this malady without any increase of\r\nits danger[926].”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Suttonian Inoculation.\r\n\r\nDaniel Sutton, though an empiric, has given his name to the slight and\r\nsafe method of inoculation which had been used in England for a good many\r\nyears before his advent. So completely was his name joined to the practice\r\nof smallpox inoculation in its later period that in a Bill before\r\nParliament in 1808 it is called “the Suttonian inoculation,” to\r\ndistinguish it from cowpox inoculation. The idea of attenuating the virus\r\nused for inoculation, and of making the effects minimal, was not his. It\r\nhad been reached empirically years before by Mowbray, of Charleston, in\r\n1738, who carried inoculation from arm to arm to the fifth remove, by\r\nFrewen, of Rye, in 1749, who was satisfied with an abstract “variolosity”\r\nof the incisions, in cases where there was no eruption at all or only a\r\nfew pustules that did not fill, by Kirkpatrick, “the most scientific\r\ninoculator in London,” who endorsed the doctrine of variolosity, by La\r\nCondamine, and most of all by Gatti of Paris.\r\n\r\nGatti used the unripe matter from a previous inoculation and inserted a\r\nmost minute quantity of it at a very small puncture; and, to make sure\r\nthat no general eruption should follow, he used the cooling regimen in\r\nvarious ways, including the prolonged immersion of the hands in cold\r\nwater. Thus he promised his clients “the benefits of inoculation without\r\nits risks.” But Gatti’s career of prosperity was cut short by a series of\r\nconspicuous failures of his artificial smallpox to prevent the natural or\r\nreal disease when it was epidemic. One of his patients, the Duchess de\r\nBoufflers, a great lady whose _salon_ was frequented by the _philosophes_\r\nand _beaux esprits_, fell into the natural smallpox two years and a half\r\nafter her inoculation[927]. So many others in Paris had the same\r\ndisappointment that a discussion arose in the Faculty of Medicine, the\r\nresult of which was that the Parliament of Paris prohibited the practice\r\nof inoculation, for various reasons, within the limits of the capital.\r\n\r\nGatti’s friend and correspondent in London was Dr Maty, who, “though born\r\nin Holland might be considered a Frenchman, but he was fixed in London by\r\nthe practice of physic and an office in the British Museum[928].” Having\r\nconducted the foreign correspondence of the Royal Society, he became in\r\n1765 its secretary in ordinary, and about the same time Principal\r\nLibrarian of the British Museum. His interest in inoculation, which was\r\nshown by his translating La Condamine’s first discourse on that subject in\r\n1755, led him in 1765 to suggest to Gatti that he should write an essay\r\nfor publication in England, “both to reclaim the thinking part of Paris,\r\nand to vindicate his own operations from the contemptuous treatment of his\r\nantagonists.” The essay was written in due course, and Maty brought it out\r\nin English[929].\r\n\r\nGatti’s own experiments and those which had previously been made in\r\nEngland by the most experienced inoculators had satisfied him of the truth\r\nof what he had long suspected, namely, that the operation could be made\r\n“still more harmless, though not less efficacious” (p. 29). There would be\r\nhardly any fever, certainly a very slight eruption and perhaps none at all\r\n(p. 68), It had, indeed, been questioned whether a patient who had but\r\nvery few pustules, or only one, has had the smallpox as truly as one who\r\nhas been very full, and whether he is equally safe from catching it. He\r\nanswers in the affirmative, according to the doctrine of variolosity: “No\r\nreason can be alleged, why we should have the smallpox but once, that will\r\nnot equally hold good for one as for ten thousand pustules” (p. 69). Some,\r\nhowever, will not believe that one pustule is as good as ten thousand,\r\n“notwithstanding the obviousness of this truth.” If one were absolutely\r\nbent upon giving a certain number of pustules, he would advise to\r\ninoculate according to his method (insertion with a needle) at twenty,\r\nthirty, or fifty places: “then you would be sure of one pustule at least\r\nat each puncture, and, probably, of many more in other parts.” He would do\r\nthis, however, only to humour prejudice, and with a feeling that he was\r\ndoing the patient “more harm than was necessary.” He was seriously\r\nsatisfied of the “sufficiency of a single pustule,” and believed that\r\nevery wise man should run the venture of it and “embrace the method here\r\nlaid down.”\r\n\r\nThere was no theoretical objection to this method, but there was the\r\npractical one, that it might be _too_ slight in its effects. Patients\r\ncould hardly rest satisfied with so little to show for smallpox; and\r\ninoculators themselves found that they might have all their work to do\r\nover again. An eminent Irish physician wrote in 1765 to Dr Andrew, of\r\nExeter, that crude matter from a previous inoculation was “less\r\ncommunicative of the disorder and more apt to disappoint us” than matter\r\nfrom a natural smallpox eruption taken “five or six days before the\r\nmaturation of it[930].” It was also the experience of Salmade, of Paris,\r\nin 1798, that serous matter, taken from arm to arm through a long\r\nsuccession of cases, was apt to go off altogether, or to be “weakened to\r\nthe point of nullity,” whereby it disappointed the operator[931]. Reid, of\r\nChelsea Hospital, was said to have carried the succession to thirty\r\nremoves from the natural smallpox. Bromfeild knew for certain of matter\r\nbeing used at the sixteenth remove.\r\n\r\nSo long as the operation held at all, and had not to be repeated, Dr\r\nAndrew believed that effects which “no one would have taken for the\r\nsmallpox,” were “sufficient security against any future infection[932].”\r\nHeberden, indeed, has recorded a case adverse to that view; but one case\r\nis not enough, even if it had been in as eminent a person as Madame de\r\nBoufflers[933].\r\n\r\nDaniel Sutton, who gave his name to the slighter kind of smallpox\r\ninoculation, was not a regular practitioner. His father, a doctor of\r\nmedicine in Suffolk, was a specialist inoculator, as others of the regular\r\nprofession here and there were becoming, and had operated upon 2514\r\npatients from 1757 to 1767. In 1763 Daniel began business on his own\r\naccount at Ingatestone in Essex, where patients from all parts were\r\nboarded and subjected to his regimen, as at a water-cure. In 1764 he made\r\n2000 guineas, and in 1765 £6300. In the three years 1764-66 he inoculated\r\n13,792 persons, and his assistants some 6000 more--without a single death.\r\nSutton kept his method at first a secret, and for that reason was looked\r\nat askance by eminent physicians. He used pills and powders, which were\r\nfound, by the analysis of Ruston, to be a preparation of antimony and\r\nmercury, the drugs supposed to be antidotes to natural smallpox, or the\r\nmeans of preventing its pustular eruption. But the essence of his method\r\nwas found to be, in Chandler’s words, “the taking of the infective humour\r\nin a crude state [from a previous inoculation] before it has been, if I\r\nmay allow the expression, variolated by the succeeding fever[934],” or, in\r\nDimsdale’s words, “inoculating with _recent_ fluid matter,” or in Sir\r\nGeorge Baker’s words, “with the moisture taken from the arm before the\r\neruption of the smallpox, nay, within four days after the operation has\r\nbeen performed[935].”\r\n\r\nSutton made it known that the effects of this method were exceedingly\r\nmild--no keeping of bed, no trouble at all: “if any patient has twenty or\r\nthirty pustules, he is said to have the smallpox very heavy.” Being put on\r\nhis trial at Chelmsford for spreading abroad the contagious particles of\r\nsmallpox by the number of his inoculations, his defence was to have been\r\n(if the bill had not been thrown out by the grand jury), that he “never\r\nbrought into Chelmsford a patient who was capable of infecting a\r\nbystander.” The mildness of his artificial smallpox was acknowledged with\r\nsatisfaction by some, with dissatisfaction by others. Dr Giles Watts, an\r\ninoculator in Kent, says it was “a most extraordinary improvement. The art\r\nof inoculation is enabled to reduce the distemper to almost as low a\r\ndegree as we could wish.... There is now an opportunity of seeing what a\r\nvery small number of the multitude of persons of all ages, habits and\r\nconstitutions, who have been inoculated in these parts, have been ill\r\nafter it.” Comparing it with the method which he had practised before, he\r\nsays that he never knew ten or twelve inoculated together “in the old way”\r\nbut one or more had the distemper in a pretty severe manner; on the other\r\nhand, he had inoculated four of his children in the new way and all of\r\nthem together had not so many as eighty pustules. He adds that sometimes\r\nthe inoculated had not even a single pustule (besides the one at the point\r\nof insertion) or at other times not more than two or three[936].\r\n\r\nThe Suttonian practice was objected to by Bromfeild in an essay dedicated\r\nto Queen Charlotte. Tracing it to Gatti, whose manifesto had been\r\npublished in England two years before, he said that it was mere credulity\r\n“to have given credit to a man who should assert, that he would give them\r\na disease which should not produce one single symptom that could\r\ncharacterize it from their usual state of health.... Inoculation, though\r\nhitherto a great blessing to our island, will in a very short time be\r\nbrought into disgrace,” if it were assumed “that health and security from\r\nthe disease can be equally obtained by reducing the patients so low as\r\nonly to produce five to fifteen pimples[937].”\r\n\r\nBromfeild was not openly supported except by Dr Langton, of Salisbury, who\r\ncontended that “the matter communicated is not the smallpox, because\r\nnumbers have been inoculated a second, third and fourth time, that\r\ntherefore it is no security against a future infection.” He cites Gatti’s\r\ncase of the Duchess de Boufflers, and declares, as to the English\r\ninoculations, that not above one in ten have so many variolous symptoms as\r\nmay be remarked in her case. “The old method of inoculating,” he says,\r\n“was to take the infection from a good subject where the pustules were\r\nwell maturated, whereby the operation was sure of succeeding; but the\r\npresent practice is to take the matter from the incision the fourth day\r\nafter the incision is made [this was Sutton’s avowed practice]. By this\r\nmeans you have a contagious caustic water instead of laudable pus, and a\r\nslight ferment in the lymph is raised, producing a few watery blotches in\r\nthe place of a perfect extrusion of the variolous matter[938].”\r\n\r\nThere was no difference of opinion as to the exact purport and upshot of\r\nthe new method; it was to reduce the eruption to the lowest point or to a\r\nvanishing point. Nothing can be more emphatic than Gatti’s profession of\r\nbelief that a single pustule, at the place of insertion, was as effectual\r\nas ten thousand; and it is not only likely, on the face of it, that such a\r\nmitigation as Reid’s to the thirtieth remove from natural smallpox, would\r\nproduce merely the local pustule, but it is clear that Gatti saw no way of\r\nensuring more by his method, supposing he were to gratify the prejudices\r\nof the laity in favour of more, than by puncturing the skin at twenty,\r\nthirty, or fifty separate points. It is not to be supposed, however, that\r\nthe minimum result was obtained in all cases, or that all inoculators were\r\nequally adroit in procuring it; even Sutton had to admit that some of his\r\nthirteen thousand patients had more pustules on the skin than he desired.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most exact record of the number of pustules produced in a\r\ncomparative trial of various methods is that of Sir William Watson at the\r\nFoundling Hospital in 1768[939]. Of 74 children inoculated in October and\r\nNovember, twelve had no eruption at all, but yet were held to have been\r\nprotected by the operation. The remaining sixty-two had a very small\r\naverage of pustules in addition to the local pustules, which average,\r\nsmall as it was, came mostly from two or three severer cases (e.g. one\r\nwith 440 pustules, one with 260, and one with near 200), the most having\r\nthree or four or a dozen or perhaps two dozen (e.g. three had only 7\r\npustules among them, or, in another batch of ten done with crude or\r\nichorous matter, “the most that any boy had was 25, the least 4, the most\r\nthat any girl had was 6, the least 3,” or, in another batch of ten, also\r\nwith crude lymph, two had no eruption, seven had 35 pustules among them,\r\nand one had 30). Of the amount of smallpox upon the whole sixty-two cases\r\nwhich had some eruption Watson says: “Physicians daily see in one limb\r\nonly of an adult person labouring under the coherent, not to say confluent\r\nsmallpox, a greater quantity of variolous matter than was found in all\r\nthese persons put together.”\r\n\r\nWatson’s sole measure of “success” in inoculating was the slightness of\r\nthe effect produced; and as he found that crude or watery matter from the\r\npunctured spot of a previous inoculation had the least effect, he decided\r\nto use that kind of matter always in future at the Foundling Hospital. On\r\nthe other hand, Mudge, of Plymouth, raised a different issue and put it to\r\nthe test of experiment on a large scale. Did crude matter infect the\r\nconstitution? Did it make the patient insusceptible of the effects of a\r\nsecond inoculation with purulent matter? The experiment came out thus:\r\n\r\nAt Plympton, in Devonshire, in the year 1776, thirty persons were\r\ninoculated with crude or watery matter from the arm of a woman who had\r\nbeen inoculated five days before, and ten persons were at the same time\r\ninoculated with purulent matter from the pustules of a case of natural\r\nsmallpox. The thirty done with crude matter had each “a large prominent\r\npustule” at the place of puncture, “but not one of them had any eruptive\r\nfever or subsequent eruption on any part of the body.” Matter taken from\r\ntheir local pustules produced exactly the same result in the next remove,\r\nnamely, a local pustule, but no eruptive fever nor eruptive pustules. The\r\nthirty were inoculated again, this time with purulent matter (five from\r\nnatural smallpox, twenty-five from inoculated smallpox), and all of them\r\nhad, besides the local pustule, an eruptive fever and an eruption “in the\r\nusual way of inoculated patients.” The ten who were originally inoculated\r\nwith purulent matter had that result at first[940].\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent history of inoculation it would appear that the method\r\nknown by the name of Sutton, of using crude or watery matter from a\r\nprevious inoculated case, was the one commonly preferred. But it was not\r\nalways preferred. One of the medical neighbours of the afterwards\r\ncelebrated Dr Jenner took matter from the pustules and kept it in a phial;\r\nhis patients inoculated therewith had somewhat active effects, even\r\n“sometimes eruptions.” But “many of them unfortunately fell victims to the\r\ncontagion of smallpox, as if they had never been under the influence of\r\nthis artificial disease,” so that Jenner, who had probably not heard of\r\nMudge’s experiment, was confirmed in his preference for the crude matter\r\n(before the eruptive fever) from a previous inoculation. It was of great\r\nimportance, he said, to attend to that point, as it would “prevent much\r\nsubsequent mischief and confusion[941].” Of course there were many more\r\nchances of getting matter from natural smallpox than from inoculated; but\r\nit would appear that in the former also it was taken in the ichorous or\r\nunripe stage of the eruption, according to the practice of Sutton, and\r\ndespite the experimental proof that Mudge gave of its merely superficial\r\nor formal effects.\r\n\r\nMudge’s experiment was on a large scale, and designed to test a general or\r\nscientific issue. The testing experiment usually made was merely for the\r\nsake of the particular case; the patient was inoculated a second time,\r\nshortly after the first, with the same matter as before, or a third time,\r\nor even a fourth time. Whatever the significance of this for the doctrine\r\nof inoculation in general (as in the issue raised by Mudge), the\r\nindividual was both reassured and fortified so far as concerned his own\r\nsafety. The experiment of the former generation that was usually cited was\r\nthat of the Hon. John Yorke. On his leaving the university at the age of\r\none and twenty it was thought prudent that he should be inoculated for\r\nsmallpox before entering on the great world. He was inoculated by serjeant\r\nsurgeon Hawkins, and had the local suppuration, some fever, but little or\r\nno eruption. The inoculator was satisfied, but not so the youth: he\r\ninsisted upon a second inoculation, which had no effect. This was\r\nconsidered a leading case. When the Suttonian method came in, and the\r\nabsence of eruption (barring a few pimples or bastard pustules) became the\r\nusual thing, the occasions for a second inoculation became more common,\r\nowing to the prejudice, as Gatti said, of the laity in favour of something\r\ntangible although not excessive[942].\r\n\r\nDimsdale inoculated many of his patients a second time, and produced the\r\nlocal pustule again, as at first. Of the 74 foundlings in Watson’s\r\nexperiment of Oct.-Nov. 1767, there were twelve who had no eruption, of\r\nwhom four were re-inoculated with no better result or with no result. Of\r\nthe whole twelve he says: “Although they had no eruption, I consider them\r\nas having in all probability gone through the disease, as the punctures of\r\nalmost all of them were inflamed and turgid many days.” It was so unusual\r\nfor a second inoculation, in a doubtful case, to produce more than the\r\nfirst, that Kite, of Gravesend, communicated to the Medical Society of\r\nLondon two cases where that had happened, as being “anomalous.” He had\r\nnever before been able to communicate the smallpox, on a second attempt,\r\n“to any patient whose arm had inflamed, and who had even a much less\r\ndegree of fever” than Case 1, who had only the local pustule and “on the\r\neighth day was quite well:” and he cites Dimsdale to the same effect[943].\r\n\r\nPerhaps enough has been said to illustrate the subtle casuistry that had\r\ngradually arisen out of the old problem of procuring the smallpox by\r\nartifice. I make one more citation, from a Hampshire inoculator in 1786,\r\nto show how fine were the distinctions, depending, one might suppose, upon\r\nthe subjective state of the practitioner, drawn between effective and\r\nnon-effective inoculation:\r\n\r\n    “The incisions sometimes have a partial inflammation for a few days,\r\n    which then vanishes without producing any illness; in this case the\r\n    patient is certainly still liable to infection; but I believe it very\r\n    rarely happens that there is any matter, or even ichor, in the present\r\n    slight manner they are made, without producing the smallpox.... I have\r\n    constantly remarked that when the punctured part inflames properly,\r\n    and is attended with an efflorescence, rather inclining to a crimson\r\n    colour, for some distance round the same, about the eleventh or\r\n    twelfth day from the inoculation, although the patient should have\r\n    very little illness and no eruption, yet that he is secure from all\r\n    future infection[944].”\r\n\r\n\r\nExtent of Inoculation in Britain to the end of the 18th Century.\r\n\r\nFrom 1721 to 1727 the inoculations in all England were known with\r\nconsiderable accuracy to have been 857; in 1728 they declined to 37; and\r\nfor the next ten or twelve years they were of no account. The southern\r\ncounties led the revival in the fifth decade of the century, so that\r\nbefore long some two thousand had been inoculated in Surrey, Kent, Sussex\r\nand Hampshire. Frewen, however, who could point to 350 cases done by\r\nhimself in Sussex previous to 1749, says that it “gained but little credit\r\namong the common sort of people, who began to dispute about the lawfulness\r\nof propagating diseases, and whether or no the smallpox produced by\r\ninoculation would be a certain security against taking it by infection,”\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIn London, after the revival under Kirkpatrick’s influence in 1743,\r\ninoculation became a lucrative branch of surgical practice, and was done\r\nby the heads of the profession--Ranby, Hawkins, Middleton and others, and\r\nalmost exclusively among the well-to-do. In 1747 Ranby had inoculated 827\r\nwithout losing one; in 1754 his total, still without a death, had reached\r\n1200. In 1754 Middleton had done 800 inoculations, with one death. The\r\noperation was by no means so simple as it looked. It required the combined\r\nwits of a physician, a surgeon, and an apothecary; while the preparation\r\nof the patient to receive the matter was an affair of weeks and of much\r\nphysicking and regimen. Thus inoculation was for a long time the privilege\r\nof those who could pay for it. As late as 1781, when a movement was\r\nstarted for giving the poor of Liverpool the benefits of inoculation, it\r\nwas stated in the programme of the charity that, “as the matter now\r\nstands, inoculation in Liverpool is confined almost exclusively to the\r\nhigher ranks,” the wealthier inhabitants having generally availed\r\nthemselves of it for many years[945].\r\n\r\nThe first project in London for gratuitous inoculation took shape, along\r\nwith the plan of a smallpox hospital, at a meeting held in February, 1746,\r\nin the vestry-room of St Paul’s, Covent Garden[946]. The original house of\r\nthe charity, called the Middlesex County Hospital for Smallpox, was opened\r\nin July, 1746, in Windmill Street, Tottenham Court Road, but was shortly\r\nremoved to Mortimer Street, and again, to Lower Street, Islington. The\r\ncharity opened also a smallpox hospital in Bethnal Green, which eventually\r\ncontained forty-four beds. The Inoculation Hospital proper, used for the\r\ntedious preparation of subjects, was a house in Old Street, St Luke’s,\r\nwith accommodation for fifteen persons. Besides the smallpox hospital at\r\nIslington, the charity had, in 1750, a neighbouring house in Frog Lane,\r\nfor the reception of patients after they had been inoculated in the Old\r\nStreet house. Down to the middle of 1750 there had been admitted 620\r\npatients in the natural smallpox, while only 34 had gone through the\r\nprocess of inoculation. The latter involved a month’s preparation, and\r\nabout a fortnight’s detention after the operation was done; so that a new\r\nbatch of subjects was inoculated but once in seven weeks. In 1752 the\r\ngovernors of the charity purchased a large building in Coldbath Fields,\r\nwhich they fitted with one hundred and thirty beds, as a hospital both for\r\ncases of the natural smallpox and for preparing subjects to undergo\r\ninoculation (the Old Street house being still retained for the latter\r\npurpose). The next important change was in 1768, when a large new hospital\r\nwas opened at St Pancras, to be solely a house of preparation, the old\r\nhospital in Coldbath Fields being now turned to the double purpose of\r\nreceiving the patients from St Pancras after their inoculation and of\r\nreceiving patients in the natural smallpox. Thus the inoculation business\r\nof the charity, which had begun with being subordinate to the treatment of\r\nthose sick of the natural smallpox, gradually encroached upon the latter\r\nand became paramount. The inoculations, which had been only 112 in the\r\nyear 1752, reached the total of 1084 in the year 1768, while the\r\nadmissions for smallpox “in the natural way” from 24 March, 1767, to 24\r\nMarch, 1768, were 700.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1762-63, the admissions for natural smallpox had been 844, and\r\nfor inoculations 439. One reason of the great increase of patients\r\nreceived for inoculation after that date was the rise of the Suttonian\r\npractice, which had vogue enough to attract numbers, and at the same time\r\nwas so much simplified in the matter of preparation and in its results\r\nthat many more could go through the hospitals in a given time. The\r\ninoculations by the Smallpox Charity were done in batches, men and boys at\r\none time, women and girls at another, on some eight or twelve occasions in\r\nthe year, of which public notice was given.\r\n\r\nThe following table is taken from the annual report of the Smallpox and\r\nInoculation Hospitals for the year 1868.\r\n\r\n      Period            Inoculations\r\n\r\n  Previous to\r\n      Oct. 1749             17\r\n  Oct. 1749-Oct. 1750       29\r\n  Oct. 1750-Oct. 1751       85\r\n      1752                 112\r\n      1753                 129\r\n      1754                 135\r\n      1755                 217\r\n      1756                 281\r\n      1757                 247\r\n      1758 }               446\r\n      1759 }\r\n      1760                 372\r\n      1761                 429\r\n      1762                 496\r\n      1763                 439\r\n      1764                 383\r\n      1765                 394\r\n      1766                 633\r\n      1767                 653\r\n      1768                1084\r\n\r\nThese charitable efforts to keep down smallpox in London hardly touched\r\nthe mass of the people, and did not touch at all the infants and young\r\nchildren among whom nearly all the cases occurred. The charity admitted no\r\nsubjects for inoculation under the age of seven years. It aimed at giving\r\nto a certain number of the working class, or of the domestics or other\r\ndependents of the rich, the same individual protection that their betters\r\npaid for. Meanwhile there were on an average about twelve thousand cases\r\nof smallpox in London from year to year, mostly in infants and young\r\nchildren. The first proposal to apply inoculation to these came in 1767,\r\nfrom Dr Maty, in a paper on “The Advantages of Early Inoculation.” This\r\nphysician, distinguished in letters and now become a librarian, sought to\r\nrecommend inoculation for infants by glorifying the purity of their juices\r\nand the natural vigour of their constitutions, which was something of a\r\nparadox at a time when half the infants born in London were dying before\r\nthe end of their third year. He saw as in a vision how smallpox would be\r\nextinguished by making inoculation universal:\r\n\r\n    “When once all the adults susceptible of the infection should either\r\n    have received it or be dead without suffering from it, the very want\r\n    of the variolous matter would put a stop to both the natural and\r\n    artificial smallpox. Inoculation then would cease to be necessary, and\r\n    therefore be laid aside[947].”\r\n\r\nEight years after, in 1775, Dr Lettsom seriously took up the project of\r\ninoculating infants in London[948]. He started a Society for Inoculation\r\nat the Homes of the People, which effected nothing besides some\r\ninoculations done by Lettsom himself during an epidemic “in confined\r\nstreets and courts.” In 1779 he launched another scheme for a “General\r\nInoculation Dispensary for the benefit of the poor throughout London,\r\nWestminster and Southwark, without removing them from their own\r\nhabitations[949].” That also was frustrated by the active opposition of\r\nDimsdale[950]. The objection to it was that there was no prospect of\r\nmaking the practice universal, and that partial inoculations in the\r\ncrowded quarters of London would merely serve to keep the contagion of\r\nsmallpox more active than ever. Lettsom answered that the danger of\r\ncontagion from inoculated smallpox was more theoretical than real,\r\ninasmuch as the amount of smallpox matter produced upon the inoculated was\r\na mere trifle[951].\r\n\r\nAt Newcastle, Lettsom’s design had at least a trial, under the influence\r\nof his friend Dr John Clark[952]. The Dispensary, founded in 1777, was\r\ndesigned from the outset to undertake gratuitous inoculations; but it was\r\nnot until 13 April, 1786, that it got to work. The “liberality of the\r\npublic” enabled the managers in that year to offer premiums to parents, to\r\ncover the expense of having their children sick from inoculation--five\r\nshillings for one child, seven shillings for two, nine shillings for\r\nthree, and ten shillings for four or more of a family. On the first\r\noccasion, 208 children were inoculated, and all recovered. From 1786 to\r\n1801, the cases numbered 3268. It was the aim of Dr Clark to get the\r\noperation done in infancy; accordingly in the space of four and a half\r\nyears (1786-1790), of 1056 inoculations 460 were on infants under one\r\nyear, 270 from one to two, 122 from two to three, 69 from three to four,\r\n62 from four to five, 66 from five to ten, and 7 from ten to fifteen. This\r\nwas perhaps the most systematic attempt at infant inoculation from year to\r\nyear. The other dispensaries at which inoculation was steadily offered to\r\nthe children of the poor were at Whitehaven (1079 inoculations from 1783\r\nto 1796), at Bath, and at Chester.\r\n\r\nBefore the society was started at Chester for the purpose, the\r\ninoculations were some fifteen or twenty in a year, and these, we may\r\nsuppose, in the richer families. The society got to work in 1779, but its\r\noperations were stopped in 1780 by a singular cause--the general diffusion\r\nof smallpox in the town by a regiment of soldiers. The whole inoculations\r\nof poor children from the spring of 1780 until September, 1782, were 213,\r\nbesides which 203 were done in private practice. The year 1781 was\r\ntolerably free from epidemic smallpox (8 deaths), but in January, 1782, a\r\nvery mortal kind prevailed in several parts of the town.\r\n\r\nAt Liverpool the first gratuitous general inoculation was in the autumn of\r\n1781, to the number of about 517. “The affluent,” says Currie, “being\r\nalarmed at the advertisement for this purpose, presented their children\r\nalso in great numbers, and 161 passed through the disease.” There was a\r\nsecond gratuitous inoculation in the spring of 1782 (to which some of the\r\nabove numbers may have belonged), and it was intended to continue the same\r\nat regular intervals; but there is no record of more than those two[953].\r\n\r\nAlthough Dimsdale opposed “general” inoculations in the large towns, for\r\nthe reasons mentioned, he was in favour of inoculating together all the\r\nsusceptible subjects in a smaller place or country district; and that kind\r\nof general inoculation was not unfrequently undertaken, sometimes\r\nhurriedly at the beginning of an epidemic, at other times after an\r\nepidemic had been running its course for months, and here or there, it\r\nwould seem, during a free interval and by way of general precaution.\r\n\r\nDimsdale himself, with the help of Ingenhousz, carried out on one\r\noccasion, in Berkhamstead and three or four other villages of\r\nHertfordshire, a general inoculation to the number, he guesses, of some\r\nsix hundred persons of all ages, including some quite old persons. In 1765\r\nor 1766 Daniel Sutton at Maldon, Essex, inoculated in one morning 417 of\r\nall ages, who were said to be all those in the town that had not had\r\nsmallpox in the natural way. Some hundreds were also inoculated by him at\r\none time in Maidstone.\r\n\r\nIn the small Gloucestershire town of Painswick in 1786, a very violent and\r\nfatal smallpox broke out during a time of typhus and intermittent fever.\r\nIn consequence of the epidemic, one surgeon inoculated 738 persons from\r\nthe 26th of May to the end of June[954]. In another Gloucestershire\r\nparish, Dursley, a single surgeon in the spring of 1797 inoculated 1475\r\npersons of all ages, “from a fortnight to seventy years.” But in certain\r\nvillages near Leeds in 1786-7 a general inoculation, organised by a\r\nzealous clergyman and paid for by a nobleman, mustered only eighty. About\r\nthe same time, during an epidemic of malignant smallpox at Luton,\r\nBedfordshire, 1215 were inoculated, and thereafter about 700 more; the\r\naverage number annually attacked by smallpox during a period of nine years\r\nhad been about twenty-five[955].\r\n\r\nInoculation was tried first in Scotland in 1726 by Maitland, during a\r\nvisit to his native Aberdeenshire, but was not persevered with owing to\r\none or two fatalities among the half-dozen cases. About 1733 it was begun\r\nat Dumfries by Gilchrist, who practised it during the next thirty years\r\nupon 560 persons, most of them, doubtless, paying patients. The returns\r\nmade to Professor Monro, of Edinburgh, showed in the chief medical\r\npractices 5554 inoculations down to 1765; of which 703 were in Edinburgh\r\nand Leith, 950 in Glasgow, 208 in Stirling, 260 in Irvine, 157 in\r\nAberdeen, 310 in Banff, 243 in Thurso, and 560 in Dumfries as above[956].\r\nSeventy-two deaths are put down to the practice. When the Statistical\r\nAccount of the 938 parishes was compiled in the last decade of the\r\ncentury, a few of the parish ministers made reference to inoculation.\r\n\r\n    Thus, in Applecross, Ross-shire, and three neighbouring parishes, an\r\n    uneducated man is said to have inoculated 700 after a very fatal\r\n    epidemic in 1789; it happened, however, that the pestilence\r\n    reappeared, whereupon inoculation was “generally adopted[957].”\r\n    Applecross may have been populous then; now there is not a smoke to be\r\n    seen in it for miles. Again, the practice is said to have become\r\n    “universal” in Skye from about 1780[958]. In Durness parish, which the\r\n    tourist may now traverse for thirteen miles to Cape Wrath without\r\n    seeing anyone but a shepherd, inoculation was rendered “general” about\r\n    1780 by the benevolence of a gentleman belonging to the parish[959].\r\n    From October, 1796, to July, 1797, a surgeon of Thurso inoculated 645\r\n    in that town and in country parishes of Caithness during a very severe\r\n    epidemic[960]. In the parish of Jedburgh the cost of an inoculation\r\n    was defrayed by the heritors, in that of Kirkwall by the kirk session,\r\n    in another by the commissioners of annexed estates, in Earlstown,\r\n    Berwickshire (on 70 children) by the chief proprietor. The ministers\r\n    who mention it at all were mostly strong advocates of it, but they\r\n    usually imply that the common people were (or had been) apathetic or\r\n    prejudiced. It was sometimes recommended from the pulpit, and actually\r\n    done by the ministers; it was even recommended that students of\r\n    divinity should be instructed in the art. Statements that it had\r\n    become “general” or “universal” are made for several parishes, mostly\r\n    in the Highlands or Islands. The very full and trustworthy account of\r\n    the parish of Banff says that “inoculation is by no means become\r\n    general among the lower ranks[961];” which is perhaps about the truth\r\n    for the country at large.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an epidemic at Leeds, in 1781, which had attacked 462 and\r\nkilled 130 during six months, “in the next six months there were\r\ninoculated 385, of whom four died” (two by contagious smallpox). A second\r\ngeneral inoculation was carried out in Leeds sometime previous to 1788.\r\nLucas, writing in that year, says: “The result of two general inoculations\r\nin Leeds has been that the smallpox has since been less frequent and less\r\nfatal[962].” This will be a convenient opportunity of considering the\r\ngross effects of inoculation upon the prevalence of smallpox.\r\n\r\nThe first and most obvious consideration is that it usually came too late.\r\n“Most born in London,” said Lettsom quite correctly, “have smallpox before\r\nthey are seven”--i.e. before the age for admission to the inoculation\r\nhospital. He might have added that, if they had run the gauntlet of\r\nsmallpox in London until they were seven, they were little likely to take\r\nit at all. The inoculations in London were therefore done upon a very\r\nselect class (they were, in fact, a very small number), who may be assumed\r\nto have escaped the perils of smallpox in London in their childhood, or to\r\nhave come to London (as many did) from country places where smallpox broke\r\nout as an epidemic only at long intervals. In other large towns as well as\r\nthe capital the inoculated must have been a residual class. At Leeds, with\r\na population of 17,117, “the number of those who were still uninfected was\r\nfound on a survey to be 700” at the end of an epidemic, of whom 385 were\r\ninoculated. If a general inoculation had been tried at Chester after the\r\nepidemic of 1774, there would have been only 1060, in a population of\r\n14,713, to try it on. How many of these, above the age of childhood, were\r\nconstitutionally proof against smallpox? The case of Ware, in\r\nHertfordshire, after the epidemic in the summer of 1777, is so related by\r\nLettsom as to bring out the ambiguity of much that was claimed for\r\ninoculation. “After about eighty had been carried off by it, a general\r\ninoculation was proposed, to prevent those who had not yet been attacked,\r\nand whose number was still considerable, from sharing the same fate. The\r\nalarm which had been excited induced most of the survivors to adopt this\r\nproposition, after which not one died, and the infection was wholly\r\neradicated.” Eighty deaths in one epidemic is a large mortality for such a\r\nplace as Ware in any circumstances; the smallpox for once had done its\r\nworst. But, says Lettsom, there were a few families of those hitherto\r\nuntouched by the epidemic who did not submit to inoculation. Not one of\r\nthem caught the disease--from their inoculated neighbours (Lettsom is\r\narguing that there was no danger in that way), nor, of course, from the\r\nepidemic contagion. It cannot but appear strange to us that the natural\r\ncessation or exhaustion of an epidemic should not have been thought of. Dr\r\nCurrie, of Liverpool, records that in the first general inoculation there\r\nin 1781 there were 417 inoculated gratuitously and about 100 more in\r\nprivate practice, and that “about three or four thousand liable to the\r\ndisease were scattered in the same manner [as the inoculated], not one of\r\nwhom caught the infection.” For a few weeks there was not a case of\r\nsmallpox known in Liverpool, so that no matter could be got for\r\ninoculation. He adds, in the most ingenuous manner: “An important\r\nparticular has been recalled to my mind by Mr Park; that previous to this\r\nfirst general inoculation, which extinguished the smallpox in so\r\nextraordinary a way, the disease raged in town with much violence and was\r\nvery fatal[963].”\r\n\r\nThe general inoculations were often carried out in so haphazard a manner\r\nas to make them valueless for a scientific as well as for a practical\r\npurpose. A Bath surgeon of long experience wrote in 1800: “Whenever the\r\ninoculating rage once takes place whole parishes are doomed, without the\r\nleast attention to age, sex, or temperament--no previous preparation, no\r\nafter treatment or concern.... Are not scores and hundreds seized upon at\r\nonce, for the incisions, scratchings, puncturings and threadings, without\r\neven a possibility of their being properly attended to? and whether they\r\nmay or may not receive the infection is just as little known or cared\r\nabout[964].” It must have been equally little known or cared about whether\r\nthey had had smallpox in the natural way before. What Dimsdale found to\r\nobtain at St Petersburg would have been the rule elsewhere: “The general\r\nmethod was to search for marks, and, if none were found, it was concluded\r\nthe party had not had the disease[965].”\r\n\r\nThus in any attempt to estimate the gross advantages of inoculation in the\r\n18th century we are met on every hand by sources of fallacy. Whatever its\r\ntheoretical correctness, it does not follow that the inoculation of\r\nsmallpox was a practical success to the extent of its trial; and even its\r\ntheoretical correctness will be thought by some, and was so thought at the\r\ntime, to have gone by the board when the artificial disease was brought\r\ndown to a pustule at the point of puncture, with or without a few bastard\r\npocks on the skin near. I have found two instances in the 18th century\r\nhistory in which there are data for a rough practical judgment, although\r\nnot for a precise statistical one. The first is the town of Blandford, in\r\nDorset; the other is the Foundling Hospital in London.\r\n\r\n    During the smallpox year 1766, smallpox of a very malignant type broke\r\n    out at Blandford in the first week of April[966]. It was estimated\r\n    that 700 persons in the town (population 2110 in 1773) had not had the\r\n    natural smallpox, and a general inoculation was resolved upon on the\r\n    13th April. “A perfect rage for inoculation,” says Dr Pulteney[967],\r\n    “seized the whole town,” and in the week following the 16th April some\r\n    300 were inoculated, the total rising to 384 before the panic ceased;\r\n    of these, 150 were paid for by the parish. There were thirteen deaths\r\n    among the inoculated, but most of these confluent or haemorrhagic\r\n    cases, seem to have been due to the epidemic contagious smallpox,\r\n    which had been peculiarly fatal, with haemorrhagic symptoms, to the\r\n    few that were seized before the inoculation began, and continued to be\r\n    fatal to many. The mortality from smallpox for the year in the parish\r\n    register was 44, and from all causes 104, or more than twice the\r\n    normal[967]. The last epidemic of smallpox in Blandford had been in\r\n    1753, when 40 died of it, the deaths from all causes being 96. In that\r\n    year also there had been a general inoculation to the number of 309.\r\n    The parish register gives the deaths in an earlier epidemic, in 1741,\r\n    which was a year of great distress and typhus fever all over England:\r\n    76 deaths are ascribed to smallpox (102 to all causes), which is a\r\n    larger total from smallpox than in either of the subsequent occasions\r\n    when general inoculations were tried. Comparing these three epidemics\r\n    in a Table, with the associated circumstances, we get the following:\r\n\r\n    _Statistics of Blandford in three Smallpox Years (Population in 1773,\r\n    2110)._\r\n\r\n                |      |        |            |   Annual Averages of\r\n        Year of |Deaths| Deaths |Inoculations|  eight previous years\r\n        Epidemic| from |  from  |            |-----------------------\r\n                | all  |Smallpox|            |         |      |\r\n                |causes|        |            |Marriages|Births|Deaths\r\n        --------|------|--------|------------|---------|------|------\r\n          1741  | 102  |   76   |    ---     |  24·87  |63·37 | 49·25\r\n          1753  |  96  |   40   |    309     |  19·37  |50·62 | 49·62\r\n          1766  | 104  |   44   |    384     |  20·62  |54·12 | 49·12\r\n\r\n    It will be seen that the higher mortality from smallpox in 1741 was\r\n    associated with other things besides the absence of inoculation. The\r\n    annual average of deaths for eight years preceding each of the three\r\n    epidemics is almost the same. But the marriages and births for eight\r\n    years preceding 1741 were much in excess of those in the periods\r\n    preceding the other two epidemic years. In the former there was a much\r\n    larger susceptible population of children, upon which the smallpox\r\n    mainly fell; and that alone would account for more deaths from\r\n    smallpox in the epidemic of 1741. But the year 1741 was peculiar in\r\n    another way; it was the worst year of typhus fever and general\r\n    distress in the whole of the 18th century, and in the circumstances\r\n    the deaths from smallpox would have been unusually numerous for the\r\n    cases. Another epidemic of smallpox without inoculation, in 1731,\r\n    showed how mild smallpox could be. At a time when sixty families had\r\n    the disease among them, a fire broke out on 4 June, and burned down\r\n    the town. It is said that 150 ill of smallpox were removed to gardens,\r\n    hedgerows and the arches of bridges, and that only one of the whole\r\n    number died[968]. This is usually cited to show the benefits of fresh\r\n    air; but if it be true, it shows more than that.\r\n\r\nThe Foundling Hospital may seem to offer all the conditions for a fair\r\ntrial of the question. It had been a standing rule of the Governors, since\r\nthe opening of the charity in 1749, that all children received into it\r\nshould be inoculated. Sir William Watson, who states the fact, adds that\r\nhe himself was “in a situation of superintending every year the\r\ninoculation of some hundreds.” Still, the rule may not have been uniformly\r\ncarried out; and even in this community of children, it was not always\r\npossible to learn on their admission whether they had had smallpox before\r\nin the natural way[969].\r\n\r\n    The lists of the inoculated are longer in the later periods than in\r\n    the earlier: thus, from March, 1759 to May, 1766, the annual average\r\n    is something under a hundred, the inmates having been 312 in 1763; but\r\n    from May, 1766 to July, 1769, the annual average is some two hundred\r\n    and fifty, the inmates in 1768 having been 438. Sir William Watson, in\r\n    his essay upon the inoculations at the Foundling, breathes no hint\r\n    that such a thing as natural smallpox ever happened there[970]; but in\r\n    another context he does casually mention that there was an epidemic of\r\n    sixty cases, with four deaths, in the end of 1762, and another\r\n    epidemic in the following summer, of “many” cases, nineteen of which,\r\n    with eleven fatalities, occurred in children who had lately been\r\n    through the measles and were weakened in consequence[971]. Another\r\n    epidemic, as I find by the apothecary’s book of weekly admissions to\r\n    the infirmary, happened in the winter of 1765-66, twenty-six names\r\n    being entered as admitted for “natural smallpox.” After that date all\r\n    the great epidemics appear to have been of measles, whooping-cough,\r\n    influenza or scarlatina; but almost every year smaller groups of\r\n    “natural smallpox” occur, of which the following have been collected\r\n    from the available records:\r\n\r\n    _Foundling Hospital, London._\r\n\r\n                Natural\r\n        Year   Smallpox\r\n\r\n        1766       8\r\n        1767       2\r\n        1768       8\r\n        1769       7\r\n        1770       1\r\n        1771       2\r\n        1772       3\r\n        1773       1\r\n        1774       4\r\n        1775       3\r\n        1783       1\r\n        1784       0\r\n        1785       8 (or 16?)\r\n        1786       0\r\n        1787       5\r\n        1788       4\r\n\r\n    The occurrence of one or more cases seems to have been the signal for\r\n    a general inoculation; or, again, it may be that the few cases of\r\n    natural smallpox in the infirmary at one time had followed a general\r\n    inoculation. Thus, in June-July, 1767, one case is entered on the\r\n    second day from the inoculation (of a large number), and another on\r\n    the fourth day. Again, in Nov.-Dec., 1768, one of the four cases of\r\n    natural smallpox is marked “soon after his inoculation.”\r\n\r\nThe received cases in which inoculation failed to save individuals from\r\nthe natural smallpox are few. Besides those already given for the first\r\nperiod of the practice, and the case from Heberden, there are six fully\r\ndetailed by Kite of Gravesend, in two groups of three each, all in the\r\nspring of 1790[972]. Apart from exact records, there are various\r\ntestimonies more or less trustworthy. The Marquis of Hertford is said to\r\nhave told Dr Jenner that his father, having been inoculated by Caesar\r\nHawkins, the serjeant surgeon, and thereafter attended by him during a\r\ntour abroad, caught smallpox at Rheims and died[973]. Bromfeild, surgeon\r\nto Queen Charlotte, is said to have “abandoned the practice of inoculation\r\nin consequence of its failure[974].” Jenner and his friends made a\r\ncollection of cases in which inoculation had failed, to the number of\r\n“more than one thousand, and fortunately seventeen of them in families of\r\nthe nobility[975].” A Bath surgeon said he had heard of “innumerable”\r\ncases of attacks of natural smallpox long after inoculation, and had\r\nhimself professionally seen “not a few[976].” A surgeon of Frampton on\r\nSevern knew of four cases, out of five inoculated together in 1784, that\r\ntook smallpox afterwards in the natural way, of whom one died[977]. In an\r\nepidemic of smallpox at Enmore Green, a suburb of Shaftesbury, in 1808, a\r\nsurgeon from Shaston found that “nearly twenty” of the victims had been\r\ninoculated “by the late Mr John White” about ten years before, and were\r\nsupposed to have had it “very fine[978].” Dr John Forbes learned that some\r\nnineteen cases of natural smallpox in and around Chichester in 1821-22\r\nwere of inoculated persons[979]. It would be incorrect to say that such\r\ncases could be multiplied indefinitely; on the contrary, they are hard to\r\nfind. Whether that shows that inoculation was on the whole a success, to\r\nthe extent that it was tried, or that its failures are in part unrecorded,\r\nI am not competent to decide. But it cannot be doubted that the usual\r\nestimates of the saving of life by inoculation were extravagant and\r\nfallacious. La Condamine, a mathematician, counted up the saving to the\r\nslave-owner in an ideal plantation of three hundred negroes[980]. Watson,\r\nwith the epidemics in the Foundling fresh in his memory, estimated that\r\ninoculation might have saved 23,000 out of the 23,308 who had died of\r\nsmallpox in London in ten years, 1758-68[981]. Haygarth[982] reckoned that\r\n351 might have been saved by inoculation of the 378 children who died of\r\nsmallpox at Chester from 1772 to 1777. Woodville, who wrote the history of\r\ninoculation down to the advent of Sutton, declared in 1796 that the art of\r\ninoculation, originally a fortuitous discovery, “is capable of saving more\r\nlives than the whole _materia medica_[983].” Arnot, the historian of\r\nEdinburgh (1779), asserted inoculation to be “a remedy so compleat that we\r\nhesitate not in the least to pronounce those parents, who will not\r\ninoculate their children for the smallpox, accessory to their death[984].”\r\nThe College of Physicians, in a formal minute of 1754, pronounced it\r\n“highly salutary to the human race.”\r\n\r\nDespite all those academic pronouncements, inoculation was somehow not a\r\npractical success. It cannot be maintained that it failed because the\r\npeople were averse to it; for it continued to be in popular request far\r\ninto the 19th century, until it was at length suppressed by statute. For\r\nthe present we may return to the proper subject of epidemic smallpox,\r\npremising, on the ground of what has been said, that inoculation made but\r\nlittle difference to the epidemiological history.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Epidemiology continued from 1721.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary course of smallpox in Britain was little touched by\r\ninoculation. The inoculators were like the fly upon the wheel, with the\r\nimportant difference that they did indeed raise the dust. The writers who\r\nkept up the old Hippocratic or Sydenhamian habit of recording the\r\nprevalent maladies of successive seasons, such as Huxham, Hillary[985],\r\nand Barker, of Coleshill, while they dealt with epidemics impartially and\r\ncomprehensively, were as if by a common instinct adverse to the fuss made\r\nabout inoculation. Says Barker, in an essay against inoculation during the\r\nSuttonian enthusiasm, “It is undoubtedly a great error that the smallpox\r\nis now considered the only bugbear in the whole list of diseases, which,\r\nif people can get but over, they think they are safe.” This hits fairly\r\nenough the disproportionate share given to inoculation in the medical\r\nwritings of the time, while it is made more pointed by the author’s\r\nsuggestions for a scientific study of the conditions of smallpox\r\nitself[986]. It is still possible, with much trouble, to bring together\r\nthe data for a scientific handling of the disease in the 18th century,\r\nthanks most of all to the exact school of observers or statisticians which\r\nbegan with Percival, of Manchester, and was continued to the end of the\r\ncentury by Haygarth, Heysham, Ferriar, Aikin and others. The best of the\r\noriginal English inoculators, Nettleton of Halifax, has also left a large\r\nnumber of interesting statistics relating to epidemics in Yorkshire and\r\nother northern counties in the years 1721-23; also, upon his suggestion,\r\nthe figures were procured from many more smallpox epidemics in other parts\r\nof England down to 1727. It will be convenient to resume the history with\r\nthese, as they come next in order after the London epidemic of 1720, at\r\nwhich point the interlude of inoculation came in. The following is a\r\ncomplete table of the figures collected from various sources: it will be\r\nobserved that most parts of England are represented, the fullest\r\nrepresentation being of the northern counties.\r\n\r\n_Censuses of Smallpox Epidemics in England, 1721-30._\r\n\r\n                                                                Percentage\r\n  Locality of the                                           Deaths      of\r\n     Epidemic           Period         Authority       Cases    Fatalities\r\n\r\n  Halifax[987]       winter of 1721    Nettleton,       276    43     15·9\r\n                     to April 1722   _Phil.

In Short’s abstracts of the\r\nparish registers those years stand out very prominently by reason of the\r\nexcess of deaths over births in a large proportion of country parishes\r\n(see above, p. 66); and, according to Wintringham’s annals, it was not\r\nfever that made them fatal years, but smallpox, along with autumnal\r\ndysenteries and diarrhoeas. Of one epidemic centre in the winter of\r\n1721-22, which is not in the table, the district of Hertford, we obtain a\r\nglimpse from Maitland, who repaired thither from London to practise\r\ninoculation.\r\n\r\n    “I own that it seem’d probable that the six persons in Mr Batt’s\r\n    family might have catched the smallpox of the girl that was\r\n    inoculated; but it is well-known that the smallpox were rife, not only\r\n    at Hertford but in several villages round it, many months before any\r\n    person was inoculated there: witness Mr Dobb’s house in Christ’s\r\n    Hospital buildings, where he himself died of the worst sort with\r\n    purples, and his children had it; some other families there, and\r\n    particularly Mr Moss’s, (where the above-named Elizabeth Harrison,\r\n    inoculated in Newgate, attended several persons under it to prove\r\n    whether she would catch the distemper by infection); both Latin\r\n    boarding-schools, Mr Stout’s and Mr Lloyd’s families, Mr John\r\n    Dimsdale’s coachman and his wife, and Mr Santoon’s maid-servant, who\r\n    was brought to the same house and died of the confluent kind of the\r\n    smallpox[993].”\r\n\r\nHere we have the same indication of adults attacked as well as children,\r\nwhich we find in Dover’s practice in London in 1720 and in all the 17th\r\ncentury and early 18th century references to smallpox. The most detailed\r\naccount is that given for the epidemic of 1724-25 at Plymouth by Huxham,\r\nwho was not an inoculator but purely an epidemiologist and practitioner in\r\nthe old manner.\r\n\r\n    The epidemic was a very severe one and of an anomalous type. Adults,\r\n    according to his particular references and his general statement, must\r\n    have been freely attacked. The major part of the adult cases, he says,\r\n    proved fatal, including one of an old gentlewoman of 72,--“a very\r\n    uncommon exit for a person of her years”! When the disease raged most\r\n    severely, some children had it very favourably and required no other\r\n    physic than to be purged at the end of the attack. The pustules were\r\n    apt to be small and to remain unfilled. In some there were miliary\r\n    vesicles, dark red or filled with limpid serum, in the interstices\r\n    between the smallpox pustules. Some had abundance of purple petechiae\r\n    among the pocks, the latter also being livid. Only one person survived\r\n    of all who had that haemorrhagic type. Swelling of the face and throat\r\n    was also seldom recovered from; in such cases that did well, the\r\n    maxillary and parotid glands would remain swollen for some time. “It\r\n    was a remarkable instance of the extraordinary virulence of these\r\n    smallpox that the women (tho’ they had had the smallpox before and\r\n    some very severely too) who constantly attended those ill of the\r\n    confluent kind, whether children or grown persons, had generally\r\n    several pustules broke out on their face, hands and breast.... I knew\r\n    one woman that had more than forty on one side of her face and breast,\r\n    the child she attended frequently leaning on those parts on that\r\n    side.”\r\n\r\n    Huxham appears to have adopted the whole Sydenhamian practice of\r\n    blooding, blistering, purging, and salivating. For the last he used\r\n    calomel: “Two adults and some children in the confluent sort never\r\n    salivated. Some very young children drivelled exceedingly through the\r\n    course of the distemper. A diarrhoea very seldom happened to\r\n    children[994].”\r\n\r\nCorresponding very nearly in time to Huxham’s malignant and anomalous\r\nconstitution of smallpox at Plymouth, and agreeing exactly with his\r\ngeneralities as to children and adults, there is an interesting table of\r\nthe ages and fatalities of those who were attacked at Aynho, in\r\nNorthamptonshire, six miles from Banbury. It was then a small market town,\r\nand its smallpox for some fifteen months of 1723-24, as recorded by the\r\nrector of the parish, may be taken as a fair instance of what happened at\r\nintervals (usually long ones) in the rural districts in the earlier years\r\nof the 18th century[995]:\r\n\r\n                                                            above\r\n  Ages  0-1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -10 -15 -20 -25 -30 -40 -50 -60 -70  70   Total\r\n\r\n  Cases   0  0  3  4  6  15  33  14  16   9  12  10   4   4   2    132\r\n  Deaths  0  0  2  1  0   1   3   1   3   3   3   4   1   2   1     25\r\n\r\nThe small fatality of the disease between the ages of five years and\r\ntwenty is according to the experience of all times. But the considerable\r\nproportion of attacks at the higher ages would hardly have been found\r\nanywhere in England, not even in a country parish, a generation or two\r\nlater, although it is consistent with all that is known of smallpox in the\r\n17th century and in the first years of the 18th[996].\r\n\r\nAnother glimpse of a prolonged smallpox epidemic of the same period in a\r\ntown is given in Frewen’s census of Hastings, with a population of 1636\r\n(males 782, females 854). The disease was prevalent for about a year and a\r\nhalf, and had ceased previous to 28 January, 1732[997]. The table accounts\r\nfor the whole population:\r\n\r\n  The number of those that recovered of the smallpox\r\n    (including four that were inoculated)                     608\r\n  Died of it                                                   97\r\n  Escaped it                                                  206\r\n  Died of other diseases since the smallpox raged there        50\r\n  The whole number of inhabitants in that town are           1636\r\n\r\nLeaving out the fifty who died of other diseases as persons who may or may\r\nnot have had smallpox, it appears that 725 of the inhabitants of Hastings\r\nhad been through the smallpox in previous epidemics, that 705 were\r\nattacked in this epidemic, and that 206 had hitherto escaped, some of them\r\nto be attacked, doubtless, in the future. The proportion of attacks above\r\nthe age of childhood in the epidemic of 1730-31 would have depended on the\r\nlength of time since the last great epidemic; the interval was probably a\r\nlong one, by the large number of susceptible persons in the town, just as\r\nat Boston, Massachusetts, in 1721 and 1752, and at Charleston, Carolina,\r\nin 1738[998]; and, as the fact is known for these places, so it is\r\nprobable that the epidemic at Hastings had included many adolescents and\r\nadults.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, where smallpox came in epidemics at short intervals, or\r\nwhere it was always present, the incidence, even in the first half of the\r\n18th century, was much more exclusively upon childhood. Thus at Nottingham\r\nthere was always some smallpox, with a great outburst perhaps once in five\r\nyears. The year 1736 was one of those fatal periods of smallpox, the\r\nvictims being “mostly children.” From the end of May to the beginning of\r\nSeptember, great numbers were swept away; the burials in St Mary’s\r\nchurchyard were 104 in May; the burials from all causes for the whole year\r\nexceeded the baptisms by 380; there had been no such mortality since\r\nthirty years. Such excessive incidence of smallpox upon the earliest years\r\nof life happened in places where the infant mortality was high from all\r\ncauses. Nottingham was one of those places. Leaving out the great smallpox\r\nyear, 1736, the other seven years of the period 1732-39 had a total of\r\n2590 baptisms to 2226 burials, of which burials no fewer than 1072 were of\r\n“infants,” meaning probably children under five years, although the work\r\nof Harris on the Acute Diseases of Infants, which was current at that\r\ntime, defines the infantine age as under four years[999].\r\n\r\nThe years of distress and typhus fever in England, Scotland, and Ireland\r\nfrom 1740 to 1742 were another great period of smallpox epidemics\r\nthroughout the country. The mortality from that cause is known to have\r\nbeen excessive in Norwich, Blandford, Edinburgh and Kilmarnock, which may\r\nbe taken as samples of a larger number of epidemics in the same years. The\r\nassociation of much smallpox of a fatal type with much typhus fever, which\r\ncan be traced in the London bills from an early period, is at length seen\r\nto be the rule for the country at large. After 1740-42, the next instances\r\nof it were in 1756 and 1766: it is most definitely indicated again in\r\n1798-1800, very clearly in 1817-19, and in 1837-39. In all the later\r\ninstances smallpox was the peculiar scourge of the infants and children in\r\ntimes of distress, while the contagious fever was as distinctively fatal\r\nto the higher ages. There is some reason to think that the law of\r\nincidence was the same in populous cities in 1740-42.\r\n\r\nThus at Edinburgh there died in the two worst years of the distress\r\n(population in 1732 estimated at 32,000)[1000]:\r\n\r\n_Edinburgh Mortalities._\r\n\r\n                    1740    1741\r\n\r\n   Under two years   439     562\r\n   From two to five  198     269\r\n   From five to ten   53      93\r\n   Above ten         547     687\r\n                    ----    ----\r\n                    1237    1611\r\n\r\n   Fever             161     304\r\n   Flux                3      36\r\n   Consumption       278     349\r\n   Aged              102     156\r\n   Suddenly           56      62\r\n  {Smallpox          274     206\r\n  {Measles           100     112\r\n  {Chincough          26     101\r\n  {Convulsions        22      16\r\n  {Teething          111     141\r\n  {Stillborn          29      50\r\n   Other diseases     77      78\r\n\r\nMore than half the deaths were under five years, and among those deaths it\r\nwill be necessary to include most of the smallpox mortality. That disease\r\nin the two exceptional years made 17 per cent. of all deaths, or one in\r\nsix. But in its somewhat steady prevalence among children in Edinburgh\r\nfrom year to year, smallpox accounted for one death in about ten, as in\r\nthe following[1001]:\r\n\r\n_Deaths by Smallpox and all causes in Edinburgh, including St Cuthbert’s\r\nparish, 1744-63._\r\n\r\n          All       Dead of\r\n  Year  Burials    Smallpox\r\n\r\n  1744   1345         167\r\n  1745   1463         141\r\n  1746   1712         128\r\n  1747   1200          71\r\n  1748   1286         167\r\n  1749   1132         192\r\n  1750   1038          64\r\n  1751   1241         109\r\n  1752   1187         147\r\n  1753   1105          70\r\n        -----        ----\r\n        12709        1256\r\n                  or 1 in 9·6\r\n\r\n  1754   1215         104\r\n  1755   1187          89\r\n  1756   1316         126\r\n  1757   1267         113\r\n  1758   1001          52\r\n  1759   1136         232\r\n  1760   1123          66\r\n  1761    903           6\r\n  1762   1305         274\r\n  1763   1160         123\r\n        -----        ----\r\n        11613        1185\r\n                  or 1 in 9·8\r\n\r\nAs in other epidemics, it was not until its second year that the smallpox\r\nreached Norwich. The mortality had been enormous in 1741, owing to the\r\ndistress and the fever, 1456 burials to 851 baptisms; but in 1742 the\r\nburials were 1953 (to 825 baptisms), the excess over the previous year\r\nbeing ascribed, in general terms, to the smallpox[1002]. It is probable\r\nthat the enormous excess of burials over baptisms at Newcastle in 1741 was\r\ndue in great part to the same disease among the children; but the\r\nstatistics do not show it.\r\n\r\nNorthampton is an instance of a town with very moderate mortality for the\r\n18th century; for that and other reasons its bills were used by Price as\r\nthe basis of a table of the expectation of life. It had certainly shared\r\nin the fever epidemic of 1741 and 1742, for in the latter of those years\r\nthe annual bill shows the very high fever-mortality of 37 in 130 deaths\r\nfrom all causes in All Saints’ parish, which had fully one-half of the\r\npopulation. But in that year there are no smallpox deaths recorded, and\r\nonly nine in the next four years. The great periodic outburst of smallpox\r\ncame in 1747[1003]:\r\n\r\n_Smallpox in Northampton, 1747._\r\n\r\n                                      Percentage\r\n  Parish          Cases    Deaths    of Fatalities\r\n\r\n  All Saints       485       76           15·6\r\n  St Sepulchre     175       21           12·0\r\n  St Giles         131       23           17·5\r\n  St Peter          30        6           20·0\r\n                  -----     ----         ------\r\n                   821      126           15·3 or 1 in 6·5\r\n\r\nOf the 76 deaths in All Saints’ parish only 58 were buried there. The\r\ndeaths from all causes in that parish were 189, of which 103, or 54 per\r\ncent., were under five years of age, and 10 between five and ten years.\r\nNext year, when things had improved much, although the mortality was still\r\nhigh, All Saints’ parish had 119 burials, of which 47, or 40 per cent.,\r\nwere under five years, and 4 from five to ten, only three of the deaths\r\nbeing from smallpox. Only a few smallpox deaths appear in the bills of All\r\nSaints’ parish until 1756 and 1757, when an epidemic occurred, part of it\r\nin each year, which produced in that greatest of the four parishes 85\r\nburials, or half as many again as in the epidemic of ten years before. It\r\nis singular that the deaths under and over five are in a very different\r\nratio in the two successive years of the epidemic:\r\n\r\n_All Saints’ Parish, Northampton._\r\n\r\n                     1756  1757\r\n\r\n  All deaths          140   135\r\n  Smallpox deaths      31    54\r\n  All deaths under 2   54    24\r\n   \"    \"      2-5     12    18\r\n   \"    \"      5-10     7    21\r\n   \"    \"     10-20     5     6\r\n   \"    \"     20-30    13    18\r\n   \"    \"     30-40     7    12\r\n   \"    \"     40-50     4     5\r\n   \"    \"   above 50   38    31\r\n\r\nThis looks as if a good many more had died of smallpox at the higher ages\r\nin the second year of its prevalence than in the first; but the great\r\ndifference between the deaths under two in 1756 and 1757 is explained\r\nchiefly by the article “convulsions,” which is 28 in the former year and\r\nonly 10 in the latter.\r\n\r\nIn Boston, Lincolnshire, a town almost as healthy as Northampton, the\r\nintervals between epidemics of smallpox were almost as long, and the\r\neffect in raising the mortality for the year nearly the same. The\r\npopulation in the last year but one of the table was 3470. The deaths\r\naveraged 104 in a year, the smallpox deaths 9·45, or one in eleven[1004].\r\n\r\n_Smallpox in Boston, Lincolnshire, 1749-68._\r\n\r\n                       Died by\r\n  Year Baptised Buried Smallpox\r\n\r\n  1749    68      120     48\r\n  1750    80       93     --\r\n  1751    55       59     --\r\n  1752    88       85     --\r\n  1753    79       73     --\r\n  1754    88      111      1\r\n  1755    74      102     19\r\n  1756    66      110     34\r\n  1757    93       86      4\r\n  1758    83       88      4\r\n  1759   102       91     --\r\n  1760   106       84      2\r\n  1761    80       94     --\r\n  1762    95      134      3\r\n  1763    92      206     69\r\n  1764   130      102      5\r\n  1765   112      113     --\r\n  1766   144      117     --\r\n  1767   129       95     --\r\n  1768   131      117     --\r\n\r\nThis was a favourable instance of urban smallpox in the 18th century,\r\nBoston having “no circumstances of narrow streets, crowded houses,\r\nmanufactories or want of medical assistance.” We may compare with it an\r\nindustrial town only a little larger, the weaving town of Kilmarnock,\r\nAyrshire, the smallpox epidemics of which came as follows[1005]:\r\n\r\n_Smallpox in Kilmarnock, 1728-63._\r\n\r\n                           Died by\r\n  Year  Baptised  Buried  Smallpox\r\n\r\n  1728    111      162      66\r\n  1729     --       --      --\r\n  1730     --       --      --\r\n  1731     --       --      --\r\n  1732     --       --      --\r\n  1733     --       --      45\r\n  1734     --       --      --\r\n  1735     --       --      --\r\n  1736    135      147      66\r\n  1737     --       --      --\r\n  1738     --       --      --\r\n  1739     --       --      --\r\n  1740     95      164      66\r\n  1741     --       --      --\r\n  1742     --       --      --\r\n  1743     --       --      --\r\n  1744     --       --      --\r\n  1745    116      102      74\r\n  1746     --       --       8\r\n  1747     --       --      --\r\n  1748     --       --       2\r\n  1749    134      149      79\r\n  1750     --       --       5\r\n  1751     --       --       1\r\n  1752     --       --      --\r\n  1753     --       --       1\r\n  1754    146      203      95\r\n  1755     --       --      --\r\n  1756     --       --      --\r\n  1757    125      132      37\r\n  1758     --       --       9\r\n  1759     --       --      --\r\n  1760     --       --      --\r\n  1761     --       --      --\r\n  1762    132      173      66\r\n  1763     --       --       2\r\n\r\nAlthough Kilmarnock had an average annual excess of baptisms over burials\r\n(134 to 107), which was more than that of Boston, its smallpox mortality\r\nwas higher than that of the Lincolnshire market town. On an annual\r\naverage, one death in eleven from all causes was by smallpox at Boston,\r\none in six at Kilmarnock. In the former the epidemics came at intervals of\r\nabout five years, in the latter at intervals of three or four. The oftener\r\nthe epidemic came, the earlier in life it attacked children; and in all\r\nsubsequent experience it has been found that smallpox is far more mortal\r\nto the ages below five than to the ages from five to ten or fifteen. More\r\ngenerally, the conditions were worse for young children in a weaving town\r\nthan in a market town of nearly the same size. In the populous weaving\r\nparish of Dunse, 130 children are said to have died of smallpox in 1733,\r\nduring a space of three months[1006].\r\n\r\nThe ages at which deaths from smallpox occurred in Kilmarnock from 1728 to\r\n1763 are strikingly different from those already given for the small\r\nmarket town or village of Aynho, near Banbury, in 1723-24; at the latter\r\nthe greater part of the fatalities, although not of the attacks, happened\r\nto persons between twenty and fifty; at the former nine-tenths of the\r\ndeaths were of infants and young children, as in the following:\r\n\r\n_Ages at Death from Smallpox, Kilmarnock, 1728-63._\r\n\r\n  Deaths\r\n  at all  Under  One to  Two to  Three to  Four to  Five to  Above  Age not\r\n   ages    One    Two    Three    Four      Five      Six     Six   stated\r\n\r\n   622     118    146     136      101       62        23      27     9\r\n\r\nThis almost exclusive incidence of fatal smallpox upon infants and young\r\nchildren in a weaving town during the middle third of the 18th century we\r\nshall find abundantly confirmed for English manufacturing and other\r\npopulous towns in the last third of the 18th century, and thereafter until\r\nthe middle of the 19th century. On the other hand, the less populous towns\r\nand the country districts continued in the 18th century to furnish a fair\r\nshare of adult cases, for the reason that epidemics came to them at longer\r\nintervals, wherein many had passed from infancy to childhood, and even\r\nfrom childhood to youth or maturity, without once encountering the risk of\r\nepidemic contagion.\r\n\r\nOf such less populous places we have an instance in Blandford, Dorset.\r\nParticulars of its smallpox have been given in connexion with general\r\ninoculations; here let us note that in this typical market town of 2110\r\ninhabitants (in 1773), the known epidemics were in 1731, 1741, 1753 and\r\n1766--at intervals of ten or a dozen years. In the villages the intervals\r\nwere longer. Haygarth gives the instance of three parishes in Kent with\r\nonly ten deaths from smallpox in twenty years, and of Seaford, in Sussex,\r\nwith one death “eleven years ago[1007].” An authentic instance is the\r\nparish of Ackworth, Yorkshire, whose register of burials contains only one\r\nsmallpox death in the ten years 1747-57, while there are thirteen such\r\ndeaths in it in the next ten-years period, clearly the effects of an\r\nepidemic, perhaps in 1766[1008]. This parish, judged by the excess of\r\nbirths, was not so healthy as many[1009], while its mortality by “fevers”\r\nwas considerable. The following somewhat general statements are made for\r\nthe parish of Kirkmaiden, Wigtonshire[1010]:\r\n\r\n  1717. “Nearly thirty-seven died of the smallpox.”\r\n  1721. Forty-eight died, “mostly of fevers.”\r\n  1725. Forty-three died, “mostly of the smallpox.”\r\n\r\nBy means of this law of periodic return, at short intervals in the\r\npopulous industrial towns, at longer intervals in the market towns, and at\r\nvery long intervals in the villages, we may realize in a measure what\r\nsmallpox was at its worst. It was the great infective scourge of infancy\r\nand childhood, admitting but few or feeble rivals or competitors, as we\r\nshall see in the historical accounts of measles, whooping-cough and\r\nscarlatina. The table of epidemics from 1721 to 1727, given at p. 518, is\r\nof a kind that might have been furnished by any series of years in the\r\n18th century; they were so much of a commonplace that hardly anyone\r\nthought of chronicling them unless for a special statistical purpose, such\r\nas the inoculation controversy. Thus, the Salisbury epidemic of 1723, with\r\n1244 cases and 165 deaths, must have been only one of a series at\r\nintervals, which may or may not have become more frequent, or of\r\ndifferent age-incidence, or of more fatal type, as the century proceeded.\r\nWe have a glimpse of one of them in 1752-3. Lord Folkestone having given a\r\nhundred pounds to the poor of Salisbury, it was ordered on 15 December,\r\n1752, “that five shillings be given to every inhabitant who hath had the\r\nsmallpox in the natural way since 1 September, or that shall have it\r\nhereafter.” The epidemic went on for months; it was not until the end of\r\n1753 that the mayor advertised the city free of smallpox. In September of\r\nthat year ten guineas were voted to Mr Hall, the apothecary, for his\r\ntrouble during the smallpox, and a like sum to Mr Dennis, the\r\nsurgeon[1011].\r\n\r\nThe year 1753 was also the time of one of the periodical Blandford\r\noutbreaks. For a year or two before there had been much smallpox at\r\nPlymouth, the account of which by Huxham will serve as a sample of his\r\nnumerous references to the disease there from the beginning of his annals\r\nin 1728.\r\n\r\n    In May, 1751, smallpox was brought in by Conway’s regiment; it spread\r\n    in July and August, becoming worse in type in the autumn as it became\r\n    more common. In January 1752 it was still prevalent, the pustules\r\n    often crude, crystalline, undigested to the end; sometimes very\r\n    confluent, small and sessile; sometimes black and bloody, attended now\r\n    and then with petechiae. In March the type grew more mild; in April\r\n    the malady was still up and down, some cases being of a bad sort. It\r\n    became more frequent again in June, and was epidemic all the summer,\r\n    the eruption often confluent, small, sometimes black, with\r\n    haemorrhages from the nose, especially in children. In August it was\r\n    epidemic everywhere, and more fatal, becoming milder in September and\r\n    October. In December, “the crusts of the black confluent kind many\r\n    times remained for at least thirty days after the eruption.” It\r\n    declined from January, 1753, and entirely ceased in May, having had a\r\n    prevalence of two years[1012].\r\n\r\n\r\nSmallpox in London in the middle of the 18th century.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly any epidemic malady in London of which so few particular\r\nrecords remain as of smallpox, except in the bills of mortality. The\r\nmonthly notes in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ from 1751 to 1755 by Dr\r\nFothergill, who practised at that time in White Hart Court, Lombard Street\r\n(having afterwards removed westward to Harpur Street, Red Lion Square),\r\ncontain the following references to it:\r\n\r\n    1751, May. Smallpox uncommonly mild in general, few dying of it in\r\n    comparison of what happens in most years.\r\n\r\n    1751, December. Smallpox began to make their appearance more\r\n    frequently than they had done of late, and became epidemical in this\r\n    month. They were in general of a benign kind, tolerably distinct,\r\n    though often very numerous. Many had them so favourably as to require\r\n    very little medical assistance, and perhaps a greater number have got\r\n    through them safely than has of late years been known.\r\n\r\n    1752, January. A distinct benign kind of smallpox continued to be the\r\n    epidemic of this month.... A few confluent cases, but rarely.\r\n    February--Children and young persons, unless the constitution is very\r\n    unfavourable, get through it very well, and the height to which the\r\n    weekly bills are swelled ought to be considered in the present case as\r\n    an argument of the frequency, not fatality, of this distemper.\r\n\r\n    1752, April. Smallpox continued to be the principal epidemic, as in\r\n    the preceding months; during which time it attacked most of those who\r\n    had not hitherto had the distemper, and it is now spread into the\r\n    suburbs and the neighbouring villages, but still in a favourable way\r\n    in general. Some have the confluent, a few the bleeding kind, but\r\n    these are not very common.\r\n\r\n    1752, June. Smallpox still continues, not many escaping who have not\r\n    had it before.\r\n\r\n    1752, July. Smallpox inclined to become malignant, but the\r\n    constitution on the whole remarkably mild. Children from one to three\r\n    years old have, I believe, suffered more from the distemper during\r\n    this constitution than those of any other ages; at least it has so\r\n    fallen out under the writer’s observation.\r\n\r\n    1753, December. Smallpox of a bad type.\r\n\r\n    1754, August. Smallpox frequent in many parts of the City, and eastern\r\n    suburbs especially. In general the kind was mild, distinct and\r\n    favourable. Out of sixteen who had the disease in a certain district,\r\n    of different ages, one only died. In some it was very virulent, with\r\n    livid petechiae.\r\n\r\n    1754, December. Smallpox not unfrequent. Many had the worst kind seen\r\n    for years.\r\n\r\n    1755, January. Smallpox more favourable.\r\n\r\nFothergill, who pointed out the defects of the London bills of mortality\r\nand made a serious attempt to get them reformed[1013], was disposed to\r\ntake their figures of smallpox deaths as on the whole trustworthy: “The\r\nsmallpox, of all diseases mentioned in the weekly bills, is perhaps the\r\nonly one of which we have any tolerably exact account, it being a disease\r\nwhich the most ignorant cannot easily mistake for another.” Reserving this\r\nopinion for some critical remarks in the sequel, we may now resume the\r\nLondon statistics from the year last given.\r\n\r\n_Smallpox Mortality in London, 1721-60._\r\n\r\n         Deaths   Deaths\r\n         from      from\r\n  Year  smallpox  all causes\r\n\r\n  1721   2,375     26,142\r\n  1722   2,167     25,750\r\n  1723   3,271     29,197\r\n  1724   1,227     25,952\r\n  1725   3,188     25,523\r\n  1726   1,569     29,647\r\n  1727   2,379     28,418\r\n  1728   2,105     27,810\r\n  1729   2,849     29,722\r\n  1730   1,914     26,761\r\n  1731   2,640     25,262\r\n  1732   1,197     23,358\r\n  1733   1,370     29,233\r\n  1734   2,688     26,062\r\n  1735   1,594     23,538\r\n  1736   3,014     27,581\r\n  1737   2,084     27,823\r\n  1738   1,590     25,825\r\n  1739   1,690     25,432\r\n  1740   2,725     30,811\r\n  1741   1,977     32,169\r\n  1742   1,429     27,483\r\n  1743   2,029     25,200\r\n  1744   1,633     20,606\r\n  1745   1,206     21,296\r\n  1746   3,236     28,157\r\n  1747   1,380     25,494\r\n  1748   1,789     23,069\r\n  1749   2,625     25,516\r\n  1750   1,229     23,727\r\n  1751     998     21,028\r\n  1752   3,538     20,485\r\n  1753     774     19,276\r\n  1754   2,359     22,696\r\n  1755   1,988     21,917\r\n  1756   1,608     20,872\r\n  1757   3,296     21,313\r\n  1758   1,273     17,576\r\n  1759   2,596     19,604\r\n  1760   2,181     19,830\r\n\r\nThe year 1752, to which Fothergill refers most fully in the notes cited,\r\nhad the highest total of deaths from smallpox in the period 1721-60,\r\nnamely, 3538, and was exceeded by only two years in the latter part of the\r\ncentury, 1772, with 3992 deaths and 1796 with 3548. Fothergill says twice\r\nthat the disease in 1752 was on the whole mild, but so universal that not\r\nmany escaped it who had not had it before; and that children from one to\r\nthree years suffered most from it. As the year was not an unhealthy one\r\nin general, this epidemic of smallpox may be chosen to show its effect\r\nupon the weekly mortalities, of children in particular.\r\n\r\n_London Weekly Mortalities: Smallpox Epidemic of 1752._\r\n\r\n                    Under   Two   Five           Convulsions\r\n   Week      All     two     to    to   Smallpox  deaths\r\n  Ending    deaths  years   five  ten    deaths\r\n\r\n  March  3   438     162     54    19     64        113\r\n        10   441     165     40    16     63        116\r\n        17   477     177     56    15     76        110\r\n        24   456     161     61    19     87        111\r\n        31   471     169     62     8     96        117\r\n  April  7   500     185     58    14     87        129\r\n        14   431     144     52    27     76         99\r\n        21   397     145     37    18     77        106\r\n        28   458     161     47    25     94         98\r\n  May    5   421     133     52    17     81         85\r\n        12   414     140     62    24     93        101\r\n        19   461     235     52    20    119        104\r\n        26   456     157     66    24    120         92\r\n  June   2   452     159     65    28    125         98\r\n         9   415     172     51    17    113         87\r\n        16   421     165     56    20    120         98\r\n        23   380     160     57    15    102         82\r\n        30   353     127     52    19     92         74\r\n  July   7   390     142     68    19    107         87\r\n        14   339     142     44    12     79         98\r\n        21   351     144     38    23     73         97\r\n        28   368     168     53    14     92         93\r\n  Aug.   4   316     141     37    13     72         90\r\n        11   350     155     44    13     58         99\r\n        18   297     145     26     9     43         98\r\n        25   371     168     46    12     57        109\r\n\r\nThe weeks with highest smallpox mortalities have not always the highest\r\ndeaths from all causes; but they correspond to a marked rise of the deaths\r\nfrom two to five years. If the table were continued to the end of the\r\nyear, to show the decline of smallpox to a fourth or fifth of its highest\r\nweekly figures, the decline in the deaths from two to five, as well as\r\nfrom five to ten, would be seen to correspond more strikingly[1014]. The\r\nother notable suggestion of the figures is that the article “convulsions,”\r\nwhich included at that time nearly the whole of infantile diarrhoea, is\r\nnot so high as usual when the article smallpox rises most. The highest\r\nweekly deaths from convulsions are in the first months of the year, when\r\nthe smallpox epidemic was beginning, and in September and October, the\r\nseason of infantile diarrhoea, when the smallpox epidemic was nearly\r\nspent.\r\n\r\nThe ages at which persons died in the several diseases were not given in\r\nthe Bills, although they were recorded in the books of Parish Clerks’\r\nHall; so that the incidence of smallpox mortality upon infants and young\r\nchildren cannot be proved for the capital as it can for other great towns\r\nin the 18th century. Not only can it not be proved, but it was not the\r\nfact that the disease was so exclusively an affair of childhood as it was\r\nin the populous provincial centres. The London population was peculiar in\r\nreceiving a constant recruit direct from the country. Many of them came\r\nfrom parishes where, as Lettsom says, “the smallpox seldom appears”; they\r\nmust often have passed their childhood without meeting with it, to\r\nencounter the risk when they came to London[1015]. Many of the class of\r\ndomestic servants were in that position; and it was especially for them\r\nthat the London Smallpox Hospital existed, the admission to it being by\r\nsubscribers’ letters, as in the voluntarily supported hospitals at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIts small accommodation was given up to some extent also to persons in\r\nexceptionally distressed circumstances[1016]. From its opening on 26\r\nSeptember, 1746, to 24 March, 1759, it had admitted 3946 cases, of which\r\n1030 had died; these are stated in the annual reports to have been “mostly\r\nadults, in many cases admitted after great irregularities and when there\r\nwas little hope of a cure”; so that the practice of this hospital alone\r\nmay be taken as evidence of several hundreds of adult cases of smallpox in\r\nthe year in London (the whole annual cases averaging perhaps twelve\r\nthousand).\r\n\r\nThe exact statistics which we shall come to in a later period of the\r\ncentury, for Manchester, Chester, Warrington and Carlisle, show that\r\nnearly all the deaths by smallpox were under five years; and it can\r\nhardly be doubted that the bulk of them in London also, with all its\r\ninflux of country people, were at the same age-period. “Most born in\r\nLondon,” said Lettsom, “have smallpox before they are seven.” It is\r\nsingular, therefore, that smallpox should have caused a much smaller\r\nproportion of the deaths from all causes in London than in the populous\r\nprovincial cities. The annual average for London was one smallpox death to\r\nabout ten or twelve other deaths; in other large towns it was one in about\r\nsix or seven. Lettsom held that the proportion in London would have come\r\nout nearly the same if the classification of deaths in the London bills\r\nhad been correct, the generic article “convulsions” having swallowed up,\r\nin his opinion, a large number of the smallpox deaths of infants. An\r\nassertion such as that is more easily made than refuted. Everyone agreed\r\nthat there was no difficulty in recognising smallpox[1017]. Whoever had\r\nseen confluent smallpox all over an infant’s body was not likely to have\r\nset down its death under any other name, for there is hardly anything more\r\ndistinctive or more loathsome. It is possible, however, that many infants\r\nwith mild smallpox had died of complications, such as autumnal diarrhoea.\r\nSydenham, indeed, says as much under the year 1667, blaming the nurses for\r\nkilling the infants by trying to check the diarrhoea. The truly incredible\r\nsacrifice of infant life in London in the 17th and 18th centuries by\r\nsummer diarrhoea, as shown in another chapter, may have caused a certain\r\nnumber of deaths of infants to be classed under “griping in the guts” in\r\nthe earlier period, and under “convulsions” in the later, which were\r\nprimarily cases of smallpox. But the true probability of the matter--and\r\nit is wholly for us a question of probability--is that London’s smaller\r\nratio of smallpox deaths and greater ratio of infantile deaths from other\r\ncauses, was not artificially made by transferring deaths from the one to\r\nthe other, but was actual, owing to a really greater liability of the\r\nLondon infants to die of other more or less nondescript maladies before\r\nsmallpox could catch them[1018].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Epidemiology continued to the end of the 18th century.\r\n\r\nThe London bills, which are the only continuous series of figures, show\r\nthe following annual mortalities by smallpox from 1761 to the end of the\r\ncentury:\r\n\r\n_Smallpox Mortality in London, 1761-1800._\r\n\r\n        Smallpox    All\r\n  Year   deaths    deaths\r\n\r\n  1761    1,525    21,063\r\n  1762    2,743    26,326\r\n  1763    3,582    26,148\r\n  1764    2,382    23,202\r\n  1765    2,498    23,230\r\n  1766    2,334    23,911\r\n  1767    2,188    22,612\r\n  1768    3,028    23,639\r\n  1769    1,968    21,847\r\n  1770    1,986    22,434\r\n  1771    1,660    21,780\r\n  1772    3,992    26,053\r\n  1773    1,039    21,656\r\n  1774    2,479    20,884\r\n  1775    2,669    20,514\r\n  1776    1,728    19,048\r\n  1777    2,567    23,334\r\n  1778    1,425    20,399\r\n  1779    2,493    20,420\r\n  1780      871    20,517\r\n  1781    3,500    20,709\r\n  1782      636    17,918\r\n  1783    1,550    19,029\r\n  1784    1,759    17,828\r\n  1785    1,999    18,919\r\n  1786    1,210    20,454\r\n  1787    2,418    19,349\r\n  1788    1,101    19,697\r\n  1789    2,077    20,749\r\n  1790    1,617    18,038\r\n  1791    1,747    18,760\r\n  1792    1,568    20,213\r\n  1793    2,382    21,749\r\n  1794    1,913    19,241\r\n  1795    1,040    21,179\r\n  1796    3,548    19,288\r\n  1797      522    17,014\r\n  1798    2,237    18,155\r\n  1799    1,111    18,134\r\n  1800    2,409    23,068\r\n\r\nThe last twenty years of the century show a decrease in the annual\r\naverages of smallpox deaths, along with a decrease of deaths from all\r\ncauses. The health of the capital had undoubtedly improved since the reign\r\nof George II., especially in the saving of infant life. But it is not\r\nworth while instituting a statistical comparison, for the reason that some\r\nlarge parishes, containing poor and unwholesome quarters, had become\r\npopulous in the latter part of the century, but were not included in the\r\nbills, while some of the old parishes, including those of the City, were\r\nprobably become less populous owing to the conversion of dwelling-houses\r\ninto business premises of various kinds. The decrease of fever-deaths in\r\nthe bills is closely parallel with the decrease of smallpox, and it is\r\nprobable that both were real; but as there is an element of uncertainty in\r\nthe data it would be unprofitable to abstract statistical ratios from\r\nthem, or to aim at demonstrating numerically what can only be in a measure\r\nprobable. Perhaps the safest generality from these London figures is that\r\nsmallpox once more fluctuates a good deal from year to year, seldom,\r\nindeed, falling below a thousand deaths, but showing a considerable drop\r\nfor several years after some greater epidemic, as in the earlier history.\r\nThis becomes most obvious by exhibiting the mortality in a graphic\r\ntracing.\r\n\r\nManchester, which was a healthier place than the capital, having an excess\r\nof births over deaths, had a smallpox mortality for six successive years,\r\n1769-1774, as follows, the population, exclusive of Salford, having been\r\n22,481 by a careful survey in 1773[1019]:\r\n\r\n_Smallpox Deaths in Manchester._\r\n\r\n  Year  All deaths  Smallpox deaths\r\n\r\n  1769    549            74\r\n  1770    689            41\r\n  1771    678           182\r\n  1772    608            66\r\n  1773    648           139\r\n  1774    635            87\r\n        -----          ----\r\n        3,807           589\r\n\r\nBetween a seventh and a sixth part of all the deaths in Manchester (15·3\r\nper cent.) were from smallpox. All but one were under the age of ten\r\nyears:\r\n\r\n   All deaths    Under    One to   Two to   Three to   Five to   Ten to\r\n  by smallpox   One year   Two      Three    Five       Ten      Twenty\r\n\r\n      589         140      216       110      93        29         1\r\n\r\nManchester was one of the towns that had smallpox continuously from year\r\nto year at this period. It had a rapidly growing population, and an excess\r\nof births over deaths which was in great part due to the very large number\r\nof new families settling in it. It was probably this rapid increase of\r\nchildren that explained the great height of the smallpox mortality in\r\n1781, namely, 344, rising from three deaths in January and falling to\r\nthirteen in December, the maximum being in the third quarter of the\r\nyear[1020].\r\n\r\nLiverpool, like Manchester, had smallpox among its infants and children\r\nsteadily from year to year, and a higher rate of fatality from that cause\r\nthan Manchester. With a population half as great again as that of\r\nManchester, namely, 34,407 in 1773, it had the following deaths from\r\nsmallpox, according to the figures taken from the registers by Dobson and\r\nsupplied to Haygarth[1021]:\r\n\r\n_Smallpox Deaths in Liverpool._\r\n\r\n                           Dead of\r\n  Year  Baptisms  Burials  smallpox\r\n\r\n  1772    1160     1085      219\r\n  1773    1192     1129      200\r\n  1774    1207     1420      243\r\n\r\nThe smallpox deaths were 1 in 5½ of all deaths. The figures also mean that\r\nnearly all the infants born in Liverpool, who survived the first months,\r\nmust have gone through the smallpox.\r\n\r\nWarrington, with a population (about 9000) one-fourth that of Liverpool,\r\nhad a great periodic outbreak of smallpox in 1773, which caused about the\r\nsame number of deaths that Liverpool had steadily in three successive\r\nyears. The deaths were 207, with an incidence upon infants as remarkable\r\nas at Manchester. I reserve the figures for another section. Whether\r\nWarrington had much or any smallpox in the years between, it is known to\r\nhave had fifty deaths in 1781, most of them in the first half of the year.\r\nChester, in 1774, with a population half as great again as Warrington,\r\nnamely, 14,713, had 1385 cases of smallpox, with 202 deaths, or 1 in 6·85,\r\nall the deaths being of children under five except 22, and those of\r\nchildren from five to ten. At the end of the epidemic a census showed that\r\nthere were only 1060 persons in Chester who had not had smallpox. It was\r\none of the healthier towns, which had a great smallpox mortality only in\r\ncertain years; in 1772 it had 16 deaths, in 1773, only one death; the next\r\ngreat mortality after 1774 falling in 1777, when the deaths were 136, of\r\nwhich only 7 were in children above the age of seven years. In 1781 it had\r\n7 deaths.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1781, when smallpox was so fatal to Manchester, Leeds also had\r\nan epidemic, 462 cases, with no fewer than 130 deaths, the population (in\r\n1775) being 17,111, of whom only some seven hundred (or eleven hundred) at\r\nthe end of the epidemic had not been through the natural smallpox.\r\n\r\nAt Carlisle, where the conditions of a greatly increased population (4158\r\nin 1763 increased to 6299 in 1780) and weaving industries were the same as\r\nat Leeds, the smallpox deaths in a series of years were as follows[1022]:\r\n\r\n_Deaths by Smallpox at Carlisle, 1779-87._\r\n\r\n               Under  Over\r\n               Five   Five\r\n        Total  years  Years\r\n\r\n  1779   90   }\r\n  1780    4   }136      7\r\n  1781   19   }\r\n  1782   30   }\r\n  1783   19     17      2\r\n  1784   10      9      1\r\n  1785   38     39      0\r\n  1786   --     --     --\r\n  1787   30     28      2\r\n        ---    ---     --\r\n        241    229     12\r\n\r\nThe smallpox deaths were 13·37 per cent, of the deaths from all causes.\r\nThe deaths from all causes under five years were 44·13 per cent.\r\n\r\nWhitehaven, which had, like Liverpool, a large part of its labouring\r\npopulation housed in cellars, suffered severely from smallpox in 1783:\r\n“incredible numbers,” says Heysham, of Carlisle, were attacked, of whom\r\n“scarcely one in three survived.” The annual reports of its dispensary,\r\nwhich begin from that year, show a small number of calls to smallpox cases\r\nin most years; but it must have happened there, as Clark found it in\r\nNewcastle, that medical aid was not often sought for the children of the\r\npoor in smallpox unless they were dying. Smallpox was perhaps not peculiar\r\namong infantile troubles in that respect; but it is remarkable that it\r\nshould have fallen so little under the notice of practitioners considering\r\nhow important its aggregate effects were on the death-rate. In 1753 the\r\nreaders of the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ took some interest in the question\r\nwhether smallpox required the aid of a physician or an apothecary, or\r\nwhether a nurse were not sufficient: instances were adduced in support of\r\nthe latter view, while the serious claims of smallpox to regular medical\r\nattendance were elaborately urged in a letter several columns long. At\r\nNewcastle, at all events, the prevalence and fatality of smallpox were\r\nactually unknown to Dr Clark, for all his zeal and statistical accuracy.\r\nAssuming from the experience of some other populous industrial towns, that\r\nit made a sixth part of the deaths from all causes, he estimated its\r\nannual mortality at 130.\r\n\r\nSmallpox in Glasgow towards the end of the 18th century appears to have\r\nbeen more mortal to children than anywhere else in Britain. The figures\r\nare not known previous to 1783, from which year the laborious researches\r\nof Dr Robert Watt in the burial registers begin; but it is probable that\r\nthe conditions were as favourable to smallpox at an earlier period[1023].\r\nIn the year 1755 its mortality is given thus: “buried, men 273, women 206,\r\nchildren 584, total 963[1024].”\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the Glasgow deaths from smallpox, and from all\r\ncauses at all ages and at three age-periods under ten:\r\n\r\n_Glasgow Mortality by Smallpox and all causes, 1783-1800._\r\n\r\n                  Smallpox  All deaths All deaths All deaths\r\n  Year All deaths  deaths    under Two    2-5        5-10\r\n\r\n  1783   1413       155         479       174         66\r\n  1784   1623       425         671       161         45\r\n  1785   1552       218         576       126         42\r\n  1786   1622       348         706       179         56\r\n  1787   1802       410         746       205         65\r\n  1788   1982       399         770       221         68\r\n  1789   1753       366         794       188         76\r\n  1790   1866       336         903       247         86\r\n  1791   2146       607         984       320         63\r\n  1792   1848       202         664       184         54\r\n  1793   2045       389         807       239         80\r\n  1794   1445       235         553       144         62\r\n  1795   1901       402         761       225         62\r\n  1796   1369       177         562       181         54\r\n  1797   1662       354         586       241         57\r\n  1798   1603       309         642       181         41\r\n  1799   1906       370         783       244         78\r\n  1800   1550       257         545       148         53\r\n\r\nDividing the period into three of six years each, and abstracting the\r\nratios, Watt got the following result[1025], by which it appears that\r\nsmallpox made between a fifth and a sixth of the whole mortality, and\r\npresumably a full third of all the deaths under five years:\r\n\r\n                                                    Ratio under\r\n                                Ratio of  Ratio of  five years,\r\n  Six-years period  All deaths  fevers   smallpox   all deaths\r\n\r\n  1783 to 1788        9994      12·65      19·55      50·06\r\n  1789 to 1794       11103       8·43      18·22      53·28\r\n  1795 to 1800        9991       8·24      18·70      51·03\r\n\r\nThe Glasgow figures bear out the rule that the greater the mortality of\r\nchildren from all causes, the greater the mortality from smallpox. The\r\nratio of infantile deaths (under two) was actually higher in Glasgow in\r\nthe end of the 18th century than in London during the very worst period of\r\nits history, the time of excessive drunkenness in the second quarter of\r\nthe 18th century: the London deaths under two years were 38·6, and from\r\ntwo to five 11·37 per cent. of the annual average deaths from 1728 to\r\n1737, while the Glasgow maxima were 42·38 and 11·90.\r\n\r\nThe examples last given are all of crowded industrial towns, the sanitary\r\ncondition of which has been referred to in the chapter on Typhus. The\r\nmarket towns and the villages doubtless had the same relatively favourable\r\nexperiences of smallpox which have been shown for them in the first half\r\nof the 18th century. It happens that the figures for Boston, Lincolnshire,\r\nof which a twenty-years series has been given already, are complete to the\r\nend of the century.\r\n\r\n_Smallpox Deaths in Boston, Lincolnshire, 1769-1800._\r\n\r\n                      All         Smallpox\r\n  Year       Births  deaths        deaths\r\n\r\n  1769        159     120           3\r\n  1770        140     166          78\r\n  1771        150     133           2\r\n  1772        138     130           6\r\n  1773        157     143          27\r\n  1774        160     112          --\r\n  1775        162     186          55\r\n  1776        165     176           7\r\n  1777        165     131           6\r\n  1778        166     174          18\r\n  1779        173     195           3\r\n  1780        137     247[1026]    --\r\n  1781        136     193          19\r\n  1782        133     177          --\r\n  1783        162     149          --\r\n  1784        147     202          58\r\n  1785        168     124           4\r\n  1786        152     114          --\r\n  1787        168     130          --\r\n  1788        181     145          --\r\n  1789        184     185          27\r\n  1790        204     126          --\r\n  1791        218      93           2\r\n  1792        219     152          --\r\n  1793        195     141           1\r\n  1794        197     148          --\r\n  1795        217     161           1\r\n  1796        214     205          64\r\n  1797        240     166          --\r\n  1798        227     112          --\r\n  1799        229     133          --\r\n  1800[1027]  225     147           1\r\n\r\nThe second division of the table covers the same years as the Glasgow\r\ntable, but tells a very different tale. It shows a great excess of births\r\nover deaths, and smallpox coming at the same long and regular intervals as\r\nin the twenty-years period before 1769, but now causing only a fifteenth\r\npart of the whole annual average deaths, or about one-third as many of\r\nthem as in Glasgow. Whether the other market towns and villages of England\r\nhad improved equally cannot be proved, owing to the almost total absence\r\nof smallpox statistics from the country south of the Trent. It was partly\r\nan accident that the best statistics of smallpox all came from the\r\nnorthern half of the country, where population and industries were growing\r\nmost; but it was in part also because there was more epidemic disease\r\nthere than elsewhere in England.\r\n\r\nSome particulars or generalities were recorded for the parishes of\r\nScotland in the last ten years of the 18th century by parish ministers\r\nwriting for the _Statistical Account_:\r\n\r\n    Some of the Highland parishes suffered greatly from time to time by\r\n    epidemics of contagious fever and by smallpox. Kiltearn, in Eastern\r\n    Ross, a parish in which “the greatest number of cottages are built of\r\n    earth, and are usually razed to the ground once in five or seven\r\n    years, when they are added to the dunghill,” was visited at intervals\r\n    by infectious fever which spread from cottage to cottage, and by\r\n    smallpox so disastrously in two successive years, 1777 and 1778, that\r\n    above thirty children died in the first and no fewer than forty-seven\r\n    in the second, owing, the minister thought, in part to improper\r\n    management (_Statistical Account of Scotland_, I. 262). Something\r\n    similar, although the numbers are not given, had happened in 1789 in\r\n    the Western Ross parish of Applecross, which is now one vast\r\n    deer-forest with two or three poor fishing hamlets. Of Kilmuir, in the\r\n    extreme north-west of Skye, it is said, “In former times the smallpox\r\n    prevailed to a very great extent, and sometimes almost depopulated the\r\n    country.”\r\n\r\n    In the parish of Holywood, Dumfriesshire, the yearly average marriages\r\n    were 5, the baptisms 16, and the burials 11; but in 1782, the burials\r\n    rose to 20, “owing to an infectious fever in the west part of the\r\n    parish” (said elsewhere to be “chiefly owing to poor living and bad\r\n    accommodation during the winter season”); and in 1786 “the large\r\n    number of deaths”--namely fourteen all told--“was owing to the ravages\r\n    of the natural smallpox” (I. 22).\r\n\r\n    In Galston parish, Ayrshire, “smallpox makes frequent ravages.” In\r\n    Eaglesham parish, near Glasgow, most of the infectious deaths are by\r\n    fever, but smallpox also carries off great numbers (II. 118).\r\n\r\n    In the parish of Largs, Ayrshire, the number of deaths varied in\r\n    different years “according as the smallpox or any species of dangerous\r\n    fever prevailed”; in such cases the number of deaths were above forty,\r\n    but in ordinary years between twenty and thirty, the mean annual\r\n    average of births being about thirty. (II. 362.) But in Dunoon “we\r\n    have commonly no sickness or fatal distemper except from old age and\r\n    the complaints peculiar to children; and even these last are not in\r\n    general fatal.” (II. 390.) In Forbes and Kearn, Aberdeenshire, “some\r\n    children are lost by the smallpox, measles, and hooping-cough. But as\r\n    the people in a great measure have got over their prejudices against\r\n    inoculation, very few now die of the smallpox,” (IX. 193).\r\n\r\n    In Monquhitter, in the same county: “the chincough, measles and\r\n    smallpox return periodically; but the virulence of these disorders is\r\n    now greatly lessened by judicious management” (VI. 122). In Grange,\r\n    Banffshire, “of late neither the smallpox nor any inflammatory\r\n    disorders have been very prevalent or mortal; the complaints are\r\n    principally nervous” (IX. 563). In Fyvie, Aberdeenshire, “there has\r\n    been no prevalent distemper for some time except the putrid\r\n    sore-throat” (IX. 461). But, in Dron, Perthshire, smallpox owing to\r\n    the prejudice against inoculation, continues to carry off a great\r\n    number of children; the hot regimen, and the keeping of the patients\r\n    too long in their foul linen and clothes, are bad for the disease (IX.\r\n    468). In Fordyce, the ravages of the smallpox are very much abated by\r\n    the practice of inoculation; the most prevalent distemper is fever\r\n    (III. 48). In the sea-board parish of Rathen, smallpox occurred among\r\n    the fishers (VI. 16). The fullest account is under the head of Thurso\r\n    (XX. 502), supplied by John Williamson, surgeon: In December, 1796,\r\n    the confluent smallpox became highly epidemic and fatal in the county\r\n    of Caithness. In Thurso, more particularly, the epidemic was almost\r\n    general, “and by my calculation one in four fell a victim.” The\r\n    mortality became so general that a general inoculation was proposed,\r\n    and more or less carried out in most parishes except Latheron.\r\n\r\nThe most exact record is for the parish of Torthorwald Dumfriesshire; in\r\ntwo ten-year periods and one of seven years the mortality was as follows\r\n(II. 12):\r\n\r\n                                                     Infants under\r\n              All                                      one, cause\r\n            deaths Smallpox Measles  Chincough  Fevers   unknown\r\n\r\n  1764-73    100       2       1         1       10        9\r\n  1774-83    100       5       0         3        7       14\r\n  1784-90     80       7       0         0        8        6\r\n\r\nAges at deaths from all diseases.\r\n\r\n           All   Under  One to  Two to Five to Ten to Forty to   Above\r\n          deaths  One     Two    Five    Ten    Forty  Seventy  Seventy\r\n\r\n  1764-73  100     9       2       1      2       19      28      39\r\n  1774-83  100    16       7       2      2        8      34      31\r\n  1784-90   80     8       2       1      4       12      23      30\r\n\r\nTwelve of the fourteen smallpox deaths occurred after the introduction of\r\ninoculation in 1776, and were ascribed by the parish minister to that\r\nsource. Again, in the parish of Whittinghame, among the Lammermuir hills,\r\n“it is not remembered that this parish has ever been visited with any\r\nepidemical distemper”--its vital statistics for ten years, 1781-90, being\r\n(II. 352):\r\n\r\n  Marriages  Baptisms  Burials\r\n\r\n  54           189       81\r\n\r\nOn the other hand another Berwickshire parish, Dunse, much more populous\r\nand occupied with weaving, had an epidemic of smallpox in 1781, which\r\nbrought the annual deaths up to 85, the births for the year being 54.\r\n\r\nAuthentic accounts of smallpox in Ireland in the 18th century are not easy\r\nto find, but it is clear from such notices of it as do exist that it could\r\nbe widely prevalent and malignant in type. Rogers gives it a bad name in\r\nCork in the first third of the century. During the great famine and fever\r\nof 1740-41 the deaths by smallpox are said to have been twice or thrice as\r\nmany in Dublin as the deaths by fever[1028]. The smallpox mortality, being\r\nchiefly of infants and children, attracted no special notice, just as the\r\nsmallpox deaths in the famine of 1817-18, although more than those by\r\nfever, are all but unmentioned in the various accounts for those years.\r\nRutty, of Dublin, under the year 1745, says: “The smallpox was brought to\r\nus by a conflux of beggars from the north, occasioned by the late scarcity\r\nthere; whose children, full of the smallpox, were frequently exposed in\r\nour streets.” His next mention of smallpox is in the winter of 1757-58,\r\nwhen the disease “kept pace in malignity,” with the prevalent spotted or\r\ntyphus fever. Amidst numerous entries of fevers of all kinds (typhus,\r\nagues, miliary fevers), as well as scarlatina and angina, these are the\r\nonly two references to smallpox in Rutty’s Dublin annals from 1726 to\r\n1766. The annals kept by Sims of Tyrone overlap those of Rutty by a few\r\nyears; and his first reference to smallpox is under the year 1766, which\r\nwas a year of almost universal smallpox in England. Towards the close of\r\n1766 and in the spring of 1767 the smallpox caused unheard-of havoc,\r\nscarcely one-half of all that were attacked escaping death. The disease\r\nhad appeared the year before along the eastern coast, and proceeded slowly\r\nwestward with so even a pace that a curious person might with ease have\r\ncomputed the rate of its progress. It had not visited the country for some\r\nyears, and was not seen again until 1770, when it was less severe than in\r\n1766-7[1029].\r\n\r\nLittle is heard of smallpox in the army and navy in the 18th century.\r\nPringle says, “We have never known it of any consequence in the field.” On\r\nboard ships of war it is mentioned occasionally, but very rarely in\r\ncomparison with fever. Lind says that it prevailed in 1758 in the ‘Royal\r\nGeorge,’ among a ship’s company of 880 men: “it destroyed four or five\r\npersons and left nearly a hundred unattacked[1030].” Trotter has an\r\noccasional reference to it in his naval annals from 1794 to 1797[1031].\r\nOne reason, and doubtless the chief reason, for its rarity in the services\r\nwas that comparatively few escaped having it in childhood. The surgeon to\r\nthe Cheshire Militia told Haygarth in 1781 that he found the whole\r\nregiment of six hundred to have had smallpox, except thirty[1032]. It does\r\nnot appear that so great a ratio of sailors or marines were protected by a\r\nprevious attack; for Trotter counted 70 in a 74-gun ship of war who had\r\nnot had it, and based a calculation thereon that there were about 6000 men\r\nin the navy in the like case. It was comparatively rare, also, in the\r\ngaols, doubtless for the same reason that has been suggested for the army\r\nand navy. Howard mentions it in only three of the prisons visited by\r\nhim[1033].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe range of severity in Smallpox, and its circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt has been abundantly shown in the foregoing, by the figures of Nettleton\r\nand others for Yorkshire and many other parts of England in 1722-27, of\r\nFrewen for Hastings in 1731, by the figures for each of the four parishes\r\nof Northampton in 1747, and by Haygarth’s census of each of the nine (or\r\nten) parishes of Chester in 1774, that the average fatality of smallpox\r\nwas one death in six or seven attacks[1034]. Any average of the kind\r\nrepresents a very wide range, as indeed the table of epidemics on p. 518\r\nsufficiently shows; and as it is a matter of scientific interest to\r\nascertain, if possible for smallpox as for other epidemic infections, the\r\ncircumstances of its greater or lesser fatality, I shall endeavour to\r\nillustrate still farther the fact of its wide range from an extremely mild\r\nto an extremely severe disease, and to inquire into the circumstances or\r\nconditions of the same.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, selected ages were below or above the average. Isaac\r\nMassey, apothecary to Christ’s Hospital school, having boys to deal with\r\nat the most favourable of all ages for smallpox, found that not one had\r\ndied of the 32 children “who are all that have had the smallpox, in the\r\nlast two years, in that family”; and that “upon a strict review of thirty\r\nyears business, and more, I have reason to think not 1 in 40 smallpox\r\npatients of the younger life have died, that is, above five and under\r\neighteen[1035].” On the other hand the London Smallpox Hospital, whose\r\npatients, as the stereotyped phrase in the reports said, were “most of\r\nthem adults, often admitted after great irregularities and when there are\r\nhardly any hopes of a cure,” had to acknowledge about one death in four or\r\nfive cases on an average, which average, again, included such an\r\nunfavourable year as 1762, with 224 deaths in 844 cases.\r\n\r\nSmall groups of cases might perchance incline to mildness or to severity.\r\nThose of the former kind in the practice of one person were the more\r\nlikely to be recorded. Thus Deering says that, in London about the year\r\n1731, his method answered so well that “out of one hundred smallpox\r\npatients who were under my care within the course of two years, I lost but\r\none. However, sincerity obliges me to own that the smallpocks were not\r\nduring that whole time generally malignant, for some had them favourable,\r\nand the matter in others who had the confluent kind came in most by the\r\neighth day to a good suppuration[1036].” This might be matched with an\r\nexperience from the seventeenth century already given on the doubtful\r\nauthority of an empiric[1037]. At Nottingham, in 1737, Deering claimed to\r\nhave treated fifty-one cases with three deaths. Dr Robertson, physician to\r\nthe fleet, says of his practice ashore: “When I arrived at Hythe in the\r\nbeginning of April, 1783, the smallpox was pretty general.... My patients,\r\nabout fifty in number, all did well[1038].”\r\n\r\nThe hold of a slave-ship may not seem a very good place to have smallpox\r\nin; and yet, in the voyage of the ‘Hannibal,’ 450 tons, 36 guns, from\r\nGuinea to Barbados in 1694, with 700 slaves on board, of whom 320 died on\r\nthe passage from dysentery and white flux, the fatality of smallpox was so\r\nslight that “not above a dozen” were lost by it, “though we had a hundred\r\nsick of it at a time, and that it went through the ship[1039].” This gives\r\nsome colour to that remarkable experience in the treatment of smallpox\r\nwhich occupied so much of the attention of Bishop Berkeley and of his\r\nfriend Prior about the years 1746-7. The captain of a slave-ship on his\r\nreturn home made affidavit before the mayor of Liverpool, “in the presence\r\nof several principal persons of that town,” that smallpox attacked the\r\nslaves on board, when on the Guinea Coast, to the number of 170, that 169\r\nof them who were induced to partake of tar-water recovered, and that the\r\none negro who proved recalcitrant against the bishop of Cloyne’s panacea\r\ndied of the disease[1040]. The somewhat low fatality of the Boston\r\nepidemic of 1752 (569 deaths in 5545 attacks not including the attacks\r\namong inoculated persons) was thought possibly due to the use of tar-water\r\nby many[1041].\r\n\r\nSometimes a run of highly favourable cases was followed by a succession of\r\nfatalities, or _vice versa_. Dr Mapletoft, to whom Sydenham dedicated a\r\nbook, was originally in good physician’s practice and Gresham professor of\r\nphysic; but he gave up these emoluments to enter the Church, and it is\r\nrelated by one who conversed with him in his extreme old age that he gave\r\na singular reason for changing his profession, namely that, having treated\r\nsmallpox cases for years without losing one (his treatment being to do\r\nnothing at all), he thereafter found that two or three died under his\r\nhands[1042].\r\n\r\nFothergill’s sixteen cases, in a certain locality of London in 1752, with\r\nonly one death, are an instance of a run of mild cases. At the Whitehaven\r\nDispensary in 1796 there was a good instance of how an average is made up;\r\nof the first seven cases attended from the dispensary three died, and then\r\nfollowed a run of thirty-four cases with only two of them fatal. Again, a\r\nhigh or low degree of fatality might seem to pertain to a particular spot.\r\nBateman gives an instance in 1807 of 28 deaths within a month in a single\r\ncourt off Shoe Lane; also in 1812, “in one small court in Shoe Lane,\r\nseventeen individuals have lately been cut off by this variolous\r\nplague[1043].” One can understand that of the old Shoe Lane; but why\r\nshould Nantwich have been reputed never to have its smallpox mortal? Worse\r\nthings are told of country smallpox in Scotland than in England. In 1758,\r\nit is said, 8 died out of 28 near Cupar Fife, and in some parts of\r\nTeviotdale “three or four died for one that recovered[1044].” Similar\r\nunparalleled mortalities are reported by some parish ministers in the\r\n‘Statistical Account.’\r\n\r\nCleghorn stationed with British troops in Minorca had a good opportunity\r\nof comparing two epidemics of smallpox, one in 1742 and the other in 1746.\r\nThere had been no smallpox since 1725, so that when it did come in March,\r\n1742, it found many susceptible of it: “every house was a hospital”; but\r\n“in proportion to the numbers, not many died; and what mortality there was\r\nhappened chiefly among children at the breast and the common soldiers.\r\nAbout the end of July the disease suddenly disappeared, most of those who\r\nwere susceptible of it having by that time undergone it.” Four and a half\r\nyears after, in December, 1745, the infection was brought in by one of H.\r\nM. ships from Constantinople, and produced in many cases attacks of a bad\r\ntype; which leads Cleghorn to remark that “it is a matter of chance\r\nwhether the best or the worst kind is got in the natural way[1045].”\r\nBarbados had its epidemic maladies noted from season to season for several\r\nyears by Hillary, who enters smallpox once: “May, 1752, smallpox epidemic:\r\nin general of the distinct kind; and in those few who had the confluent\r\nsort, they were generally of a good kind[1046].” Foreign observers were\r\nsometimes struck by the same mildness of a whole epidemic[1047].\r\n\r\nThe often cited remark of Wagstaffe in 1722, that there were cases which a\r\nphysician could not save and cases which a nurse could not lose, had many\r\nillustrations. The cases of Queen Mary, in 1694, with the best physicians\r\nat her bed-side, and of the Duke of Gloucester in 1660, show the one\r\nevent; the following from the _Gentleman’s Magazine_, shows the other:\r\n\r\n    In the parish of Whittington, Derbyshire, seventeen patients in all\r\n    had the smallpox in the year 1752; the first was seized June 7, and\r\n    the last August 12. They were all children, of various ages, and all\r\n    did well. An apothecary was called to one only of them[1048].\r\n\r\nA note added says:\r\n\r\n    “William Cave, a tradesman of Rugby, had twelve children, who, with\r\n    three nephews, were seized with the smallpox; some of them had it\r\n    severely, but all did well through the care of their mothers, without\r\n    the intervention of an apothecary.”\r\n\r\nOr there might be the average fatality in village epidemics left to\r\ndomestic treatment only. At Kelsall and Ashton, two small Cheshire\r\nvillages, sixty-nine persons had smallpox during seven months of 1773, of\r\nwhom twelve died. “No medical practitioner visited any of the patients\r\nduring the whole disease[1049].”\r\n\r\nTo find a single principle of cleavage through the smallpox of the 18th\r\ncentury, dividing it into good and bad, is impossible. The determining\r\nthings were manifold, and they are to us obscure. Things proper to the\r\nindividual constitution or temperament, hidden in what has been called\r\n“the abysmal deeps of personality,” cover a good deal in our reactions\r\ntowards smallpox as in more important relationships. Generalizing such\r\nfacts to the utmost, we do not get beyond the notion that the greater or\r\nlesser degree of proclivity runs in families. Morton could recall no case\r\nof smallpox fatal in his own family, nor, curiously enough, among his\r\nwife’s relations. On the other hand he introduces a case, his 53rd, as if\r\nto illustrate the contrary--a fair and elegant young lady, sprung of a\r\ndistinguished stock, but one to which this disease was wont to prove\r\ncalamitous as if by hereditary right[1050]. The royal family of Stuart had\r\na peculiar fatality in smallpox; and so, it appears, had the family of the\r\nearl of Huntingdon, who wrote to Thomas Coke on 18 June, 1701: “I am\r\ninformed Lord Kilmorey [married to his sister] is ill of a fever, and that\r\nsome think it may prove the smallpox. For the love of God, send for my\r\nsister to your house. She never has had them and they have proved fatal in\r\nour family[1051].” A similar fatality in the family of John Evelyn can be\r\ntraced in the pages of his diary.\r\n\r\nNext to the individual constitution, we may take the epidemic\r\nconstitution, in the Hippocratic sense. No one keeping before him the\r\nstrange diversities of type in whole epidemics of scarlatina and measles\r\nwill say that the Hippocratic doctrine of varying constitutions is not\r\nrequisite to cover a certain element of mystery. But we should rationalize\r\nit wherever we can; and there are some obvious considerations that may be\r\nused to explain why smallpox, throughout a whole epidemic, had so high an\r\naverage fatality in some years or in some localities. Rutty, who noted the\r\nfevers and other prevalent maladies in Dublin and elsewhere in Ireland\r\nfrom year to year, and the associations of the same with famine or the\r\nlike, says that some had dysentery in 1757, “promoted perhaps by the\r\nbadness of their bread, as it was a time of great scarcity,” that a low,\r\nputrid, petechial fever followed in the winter, fatal to not a few of the\r\nyoung and strong both in Dublin and in the country, and that as the cases\r\nof petechial fever increased much beyond the usual number in January,\r\n1758, “it was observable that the smallpox kept pace in malignity with\r\nthe fevers[1052].” That was the same year, 1758, for which Whytt records,\r\nalong with the fatal smallpox of Fifeshire and Teviotdale, a dysentery and\r\npestilential fever a month or two before, disastrous in Argyllshire, less\r\nmortal in Haddington and Newcastle, as well as an influenza all over\r\nScotland[1053]. Again, in the country town and parish of Painswick,\r\nGloucestershire, there was an epidemic of smallpox in the summer of 1785\r\nso fatal that nearly one in three of the infected died. “This fatality,”\r\nsays J. C. Jenner, “may in some measure perhaps be attributed to a\r\ncontagious fever and epidemic ague which prevailed at the same time, and\r\nto the heat of the atmosphere”--many being dropsical from the agues that\r\nhad afflicted them for months, and many reduced by the typhus fever[1054].\r\nA striking instance of the fatality of smallpox among children in a poor\r\nstate of health owing to previous disease is given by Sir William Watson:\r\n\r\nAt the Foundling Hospital of London, containing upwards of 300 children,\r\nthere were 60 cases of smallpox during the last six months of the year\r\n1762, of which only 4 died, or 1 in 15. In April and May of next year\r\n(1763) measles of a bad type broke out among the 312 inmates, attacking\r\n180, of whom 19 died (over 1 in 10), while many who recovered were greatly\r\nweakened, having ulcerations of the lips and mouth for some time after. In\r\nMay and June, when the children were recovering from measles, the smallpox\r\nattacked many in the hospital, including 18 who had lately gone through\r\nthe measles. No fewer than 11 of those 18 died of smallpox. A\r\ncorresponding fatality of smallpox was observed shortly before among\r\nchildren at the Foundling who were recovering from or had lately passed\r\nthrough the dysentery or “dysenteric fever[1055].”\r\n\r\nIt happens that we can compare a mild or average smallpox with an\r\nunusually fatal one, and the conditions on which they respectively\r\ndepended, in the two neighbouring towns of Warrington and Chester in the\r\ntwo successive years 1773 and 1774. Chester in 1774 had the average kind\r\nof epidemic--1385 cases with 202 deaths (1 in 6·85), all in children. The\r\nChester populace, as described by Haygarth, lived for the most part in\r\npoor houses of the newer suburbs; they were filthy in their persons and\r\ntheir houses were often visited by typhus fever (supra, p. 41). But the\r\noccupations of the men were not unhealthy, and the women would seem to\r\nhave been left to their domestic duties in the usual way. At Warrington\r\nthe circumstances were different. A seat of the sailcloth weaving from the\r\nElizabethan period (as early as 1586 the “poledavies” of Warrington are\r\nmentioned), it had retained its repute and extended its industry as\r\nsailcloth came more into demand[1056]. The American War, and the earlier\r\nwar with the French in Canada, caused an immense number of ships to be\r\ncommissioned for the royal navy, and the Warrington looms are said to have\r\nfurnished half of all the sailcloth that the fleets needed[1057]. Its\r\nmanufacturers made their fortunes, new looms were added, population was\r\ndrawn to the town from the country, marriages multiplied and were\r\nunusually prolific, and the swarms of children were hardly into their\r\nteens before they were set to earn wages along with their fathers and\r\ntheir mothers. We have vital statistics from the parish register by\r\nAikin[1058], and an account of the industries by Arthur Young, as he saw\r\nthem in 1769[1059]. During the twenty years from 1702 to 1722, each\r\nmarriage, according to the register, produced only 2·9 children; from 1752\r\nto 1772, the marriages averaged 73 in a year, and the baptisms 237, being\r\n3·25 children to each marriage[1060]. But in the last three years of that\r\nperiod, 1770-72, the marriages had risen rapidly to an annual average of\r\n95, and the baptisms to 331, being about 3·5 children to each marriage.\r\nFrom 1773 to 1781 the marriages averaged 85 and the fecundity reached 4·5\r\nchildren to each. Arthur Young found the whole of this community, men,\r\nwomen, and children, engaged in sailcloth or sacking manufacture,\r\nboot-making, and pin-making.\r\n\r\n    “At Warrington the manufactures of sailcloth and sacking are very\r\n    considerable. The first is spun by women and girls, who earn about\r\n    2_d._ a day. It is then bleached, which is done by men, who earn\r\n    10_s._ a week; after bleaching, it is wound by women, whose earnings\r\n    are 2_s._ 6_d._ a week; next it is warped by men, who earn 7_s._ a\r\n    week; and then starched, the earnings 10_s._ 6_d._ a week. The last\r\n    operation is the weaving in which the men earn 9_s._, the women 5_s._,\r\n    the boys 3_s._ 6_d._ a week. The spinners (women) in the sacking\r\n    branch earn 6_s._ a week. Then it is wound on bobbins by women and\r\n    children, whose earnings are 4_d._ a day.... The sailcloth employs\r\n    about 300 weavers, and the sacking 150; and they reckon 20 spinners\r\n    and 2 or 3 other hands to every weaver.”\r\n\r\nOn that basis of reckoning, Young estimated that the Warrington\r\nmanufactures employed about eleven thousand hands; but as Aikin, in 1781,\r\ncounted the whole inhabitants of the borough and three adjoining hamlets\r\nat 9501, it is clear that a good many spinners of the flax and hemp who\r\nlived in the country near Warrington must be allowed for in the eleven\r\nthousand. At all events Warrington was an early and an extreme instance of\r\nthat hurry and scramble of wage-earning, by fathers, mothers and children,\r\nwhich the growth of manufactures in the latter part of the 18th century\r\ngave rise to, and of which many particulars came to light long after\r\nduring the discussions that preceded the passing of the Factory Act. The\r\nmothers were workers, and all the while breeders at a somewhat high rate.\r\nIt is difficult to imagine how the household duties were got through, and\r\nthe infants reared, in such an industrial hive. Nor was there much\r\nattention given, during those great days of the sailcloth industry, to the\r\nscavenging and lighting of the town, and probably little to the\r\novercrowded state of its old-fashioned streets and lanes. It was in\r\nJanuary and February, 1775, fully a year after the great smallpox epidemic\r\nhad ceased, that Mr Blackburne, who had become lord of the manor in 1764,\r\n“promoted the design of establishing a court of requests at Warrington,\r\ncleansing and lighting the town, and removing the butchers’ stalls.” These\r\nproposals, we are told, gave rise to a paper war[1061].\r\n\r\nFerriar has described what was apt to happen when country people migrated\r\nto manufacturing towns, got married, and had children born to them:\r\n\r\n    “A young couple live very happily, till the woman is confined by her\r\n    first lying-in. The cessation of her employment then produces a\r\n    deficiency in their income, at a time when expenses unavoidably\r\n    increase. She therefore wants many comforts, and even the indulgences\r\n    necessary to her situation: she becomes sickly, droops, and at last is\r\n    laid up by a fever or a pneumonic complaint; the child dwindles, and\r\n    frequently dies; the husband, unable to hire a nurse, gives up most of\r\n    his time to attendance on his wife and child; his wages are reduced to\r\n    a trifle; vexation and want render him diseased, and the whole family\r\n    sometimes perishes, from the want of a small timely supply which their\r\n    future industry would have amply repaid to the public[1062].”\r\n\r\nWhat Ferriar saw so often some years after at Manchester must have been a\r\nnot uncommon case at Warrington during the bustling time that Arthur Young\r\ndescribes. Its infantile mortality was certainly excessive, according to\r\nthe following comparison with that of Chester, from the figures supplied\r\nto Price by Aikin from the Warrington burial registers of nine years,\r\n1773-81, and by Haygarth from the Chester bills for ten years,\r\n1772-81[1063]. The deaths are reduced to annual averages, and those of\r\nWarrington are raised, in the third column, to the ratio of the population\r\nof Chester by making them half as much again.\r\n\r\n_Annual average of deaths from all causes under five years._\r\n\r\n                 Warrington.

Aikin says:\r\n\r\n    “Its victims were chiefly young children, whom it attacked with such\r\n    instant fury that the best-directed means for relief were of little\r\n    avail. In general the sick were kept sufficiently cool, and were\r\n    properly supplied with diluting and acidulous drinks; yet where they\r\n    recovered, it seemed rather owing to a less degree of malignity in the\r\n    disease or greater strength to struggle with it, than any peculiar\r\n    management. When it ended fatally, it was usually before the pustules\r\n    came to maturation; and, indeed, in many they showed no disposition to\r\n    advance after the complete eruption, but remained quite flat and\r\n    pale”--a sure sign of poor _stamina vitae_. “In one neighbourhood I\r\n    found that out of 29 who had the disease, 12 died, or about 2 in 5; in\r\n    others the mortality was still greater, and I have reason to believe\r\n    it was not less on the whole.”\r\n\r\nThe monthly progress of the mortality at Warrington and Chester\r\nrespectively was as follows[1064]:\r\n\r\n              Deaths.

Some such difference Haygarth\r\nsays was well known between the smallpox of great and small towns,\r\nnamely, that it “attacks children at an earlier age, and consequently is\r\nfatal to a larger proportion of people, in great than in small\r\ntowns[1067].” Although Warrington was the smaller town, infants died\r\nearlier there than at Chester (from smallpox and from all causes), or the\r\nprobability of life was less;--a statistical fact which Price made out,\r\nbut was unable to explain. The explanation is the poor stamina of the\r\nWarrington children, which was due most of all to the circumstance that\r\nthe married women were at once wage-earners and prolific breeders.\r\n\r\nIn the smallpox year at Warrington, the deaths from all causes under five\r\nyears of age were 62·5 of the whole mortality, (in infants under two years\r\nthey were 43·5 per cent. of all deaths) smallpox having caused them in the\r\nratio of 199 to 291. Although Aikin’s estimate of two deaths in five cases\r\nis improbable for the whole epidemic, we may admit a rate of one death in\r\nfour, which would give Warrington in 1773 about as many cases in\r\nproportion to its numbers as Chester had in 1774--844 in a population of\r\nsome 9000, as compared with 1385 in a population of 14,713.\r\n\r\nThe epidemics of smallpox at Carlisle in 1779 and Leeds in 1781 were\r\nunusually mortal, for reasons analogous to those assigned in the case of\r\nWarrington. Both towns had increased fast in numbers, owing to the growth\r\nof the weaving and spinning industries, both were overcrowded, ill\r\nventilated, and filthy, and both had high mortalities from typhus fever\r\namong the adults, as described in another chapter. At Carlisle, the great\r\nepidemic of smallpox, which was the children’s special scourge, came in\r\n1779, two years before the typhus fever reached a height. The smallpox\r\ncaused 90 deaths, while “a species of scarlet fever” at the same time\r\ncaused 39 deaths. Heysham estimated somewhat vaguely that these 90 deaths\r\noccurred in 300 cases, or one case fatal in 3·3, which is double the\r\naverage[1068]. Lucas gives the proportion at Leeds more exactly--462\r\ncases, in six months, with 130 fatalities, or 1 in 3·5. The epidemic at\r\nLeeds in 1721-22, which Nettleton described as “more than usually mortal,”\r\ncaused 189 deaths in 792 attacks, or 1 in 4·2. There were fewer attacks in\r\nthe much larger population (17,117) of 1781, perhaps because there were\r\nfewer persons who had not had the disease already, and these almost\r\nexclusively the infants born and the young children who had grown up since\r\nthe last epidemic[1069]. In those circumstances it is hardly surprising\r\nthat the Leeds smallpox of 1781 should have been a degree more mortal than\r\nthat of 1721-22, which was itself “more than usually mortal.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA complete survey of smallpox in its great period, the eighteenth century,\r\nin all places and continuously from year to year, is impossible even if it\r\nwere to be desired. Had it not been for the exact diligence of a few,\r\nespecially in the North of England, we should have been left in doubt on\r\nsome of the main epidemiological generalities. A system of registration\r\nsuch as was applied for the first time in the epidemic of 1837-39 would\r\nhave saved much research and would have made it possible to bring the\r\nfacts within a smaller compass. By comparison and classification of many\r\nscattered particulars we may still acquire a tolerably clear notion of\r\nwhat smallpox was in the 18th century. It was chiefly a disease of infancy\r\nand early childhood. It was always present in one part or another of the\r\ncapital and of the larger towns, rising at intervals to the height of a\r\ngreat and general epidemic[1070]. At its worst, as in Glasgow, it took\r\nabout a third part of the lives under the age of five, and perhaps a sixth\r\npart of the lives at all ages. It came in epidemics at somewhat regular\r\nintervals in the smaller towns, and at longer intervals in the country\r\nparishes. The village epidemics were apt to be very searching when they\r\ndid come. Haygarth gives the instance of Christleton, a small village two\r\nmiles from Chester, in 1778: “The distemper began in March and continued\r\ntill October. At the commencement of the epidemic, 107 poor children had\r\nnever been exposed to the variolous infection; of these 100 had the\r\ndistemper, probably all who were capable of receiving the smallpox.” In\r\nall places, with the possible exception of London where the risks from\r\ninfantile diarrhoea and “convulsions” were peculiar, it cut off the\r\ninfants and young children more than any other single disease, infectious\r\nor other; and indeed it had few rivals among infectious diseases until\r\ntowards the close of the century, being for a time the grand epidemic\r\nscourge of the first years of life just as the plague was once the unique\r\nscourge of youth and mature age. It was more mortal in some seasons than\r\nin others, and at certain places. Towards the end of the 18th century,\r\nmuch more is heard of it in the northern industrial towns than in England\r\nsouth of the Trent. If the statistics of Boston, Lincolnshire, are at all\r\nrepresentative, smallpox certainly declined much in market towns in the\r\nlast twenty years of the century. It appears to have declined also in the\r\ncapital during the same period. In the parishes of Scotland, by the almost\r\nunanimous testimony of the articles which refer to it in the ‘Statistical\r\nAccount,’ it had become much less frequent and less dangerous for some\r\nyears previous to the publication of that work (1792-98). In Glasgow, with\r\nthe worst statistics of children’s deaths in the whole kingdom, the\r\nmaximum had been reached, and passed, in the period between the close of\r\nthe American war and the first years of the great war with France. As the\r\nFrench war proceeded, and vast sums of public money were poured out (the\r\nbill being left to Prince Posterity to pay), the effects of this abundance\r\nwere seen in the remarkable decline, and almost total disappearance, of\r\nfevers all over England, Scotland and Ireland. Corresponding with the lull\r\nin fevers there was a lull in smallpox, not so marked as the former, but\r\nvery significantly covering the same period and lasting until the great\r\ndepression of trade in 1816 which followed the Peace. This will appear in\r\ncontinuing the chronology of epidemics; but before we come to that, it\r\nremains to make clear the scientific or pathological nature of a new kind\r\nof inoculation which became at this juncture the rival of the old. The\r\nextent to which each of the rival methods was practised will become a\r\nsubject of inquiry after the epidemic of 1817-19 has been dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\nCowpox.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said, in previous sections of this chapter, as to the\r\nefforts of inoculators to reduce the effects of inoculated virus “to as\r\nlow a degree as we could wish.” What kind of matter do you use? one\r\ninoculator would ask of another. The comparative trials of Watson had\r\nshown that serous or watery matter from an unripe pustule of smallpox,\r\npreferably from the unripe pustule of a previous inoculation on the arm,\r\nwas most “successful,” the success being measured by the slightness of the\r\neffect produced at the time. The comparative trials of Mudge had confirmed\r\nthat, but had gone a little farther in showing that these slight effects\r\nof crude or unripe matter left the constitution still open to the same\r\neffects by the same means, or to more severe effects by more severe means.\r\nWhat kind of matter to use was, accordingly, still an open question, which\r\noffered some scope for originality and ingenuity. Among other sources of\r\ncrude or watery matter with bland properties was the glassy or watery\r\nvariety of eruption called swinepox, which, like its congener chickenpox,\r\nwas peculiar to man; and among those who tried that source of non-purulent\r\nmatter for inoculation was Jenner, of Berkeley. It was in 1789 that he\r\ninoculated his child, aged eighteen months, with matter from the so-called\r\nswinepox of man. There was still another pox bearing the name of a brute\r\nanimal, which was, however, a true affection of brutes--the cowpox or\r\npap-pox. A farmer at Yetminster, Dorset, named Benjamin Jesty, had used\r\nmatter from that source for the inoculation of his wife and two young\r\nchildren in 1774, with the result that the arm of the former was much\r\ninflamed and had to be treated by a surgeon. There seemed to be no good\r\nreason for preferring matter of such dangerous tendency, and the\r\nexperiment was not repeated. A few years after, an apothecary of Lyme, in\r\nDorset, is said to have heard of another case of the domestic use of\r\ncowpox matter for inoculation by the mistress of a farm house, and to have\r\npressed this fact upon the attention of Sir George Baker; who, although a\r\nsupporter of the mild or Suttonian inoculations with crude lymph, and by\r\nhis own avowal a friend of experiments, did not favour the trial of matter\r\nfrom the pap-pox of cows, probably for the reason that he should have been\r\ndeparting from the ground-principle of inoculating for the smallpox if he\r\nwere to go outside the class of variolous disease for his matter. The true\r\nvirtuoso, however, has no antecedent objection to experimenting with\r\nanything. Sometime after Jenner had used the swinepox matter, he began to\r\ntalk among his medical neighbours of using cowpox matter. But it was known\r\nthat cowpox matter had properties and effects of its own, and that it\r\nwould be a radical innovation to use it, a departure _toto coelo_ from\r\nevery modification hitherto tried in the inoculation procedure. Although\r\nit was also a pox by name, and although cowpox to the apprehension of a\r\nman of words or notions might seem to be in the same class as swinepox,\r\nglasspox, hornpox, waterpox or chickenpox, yet those who had ever seen it\r\non the chapped hands of milkers would hardly admit that matter from such a\r\nsource could serve for inoculation purposes unless upon wholly independent\r\nand original proof of efficacy. Jenner’s colleagues are reported to have\r\ndenied that cowpoxed milkers escaped natural smallpox any more than their\r\nfellows[1071]. About the year 1794 Jenner began to press the subject upon\r\nthe attention of his friends. His clerical neighbour, Worthington,\r\nmentioned it in one of his letters to Haygarth, of Chester, who replied,\r\non 15 April, 1794:\r\n\r\n    “Your account of the cowpox is indeed very marvellous, being so\r\n    strange a history, and so contradictory to all past observations on\r\n    this subject, very clear and full evidence will be required to render\r\n    it credible. You say that this whole rare phenomenon is soon to be\r\n    published, but do not mention whether by yourself or some other\r\n    medical friend. In either case I trust that no reliance will be placed\r\n    upon vulgar stories. The author should admit nothing but what he has\r\n    proved by his own personal observation, both in the brute and human\r\n    species. It would be useless to specify the doubts that must be\r\n    satisfied upon this subject before rational belief can be obtained. If\r\n    a physician should adopt such a doctrine, and much more if he should\r\n    publish it upon inadequate evidence, his character would materially\r\n    suffer in the public opinion of his knowledge and discernment[1072].”\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Haygarth, who was well acquainted with epidemic smallpox\r\nand with inoculation, saw in this Gloucestershire idea something quite new\r\nas well as antecedently improbable. What the real novelty was will appear\r\nfrom the next historical reference to cowpox in an original work upon\r\nMorbid Poisons by Joseph Adams, a writer of the Hunterian school. All that\r\nAdams knew of the nature of cowpox previous to March, 1795, came from\r\nCline, surgeon to St Thomas’s Hospital, who had been a fellow student of\r\nJenner’s five and twenty years before, and kept up some correspondence\r\nwith him. Adams is writing on the peculiar danger of ulceration and\r\nsloughing, or phagedaena, from transferring animal matters from one body\r\nto another, his last illustration having been the notorious phagedaenic\r\nulceration of the gums, with rashes of the skin and constitutional effects\r\nso severe as to be fatal, which followed the transplantation of fresh\r\nteeth from one person to another in a number of cases about the year 1790\r\nand led to the speedy abandonment of that unnatural practice[1073]. He\r\nproceeds to say, “Thus far we have only traced the poisonous effects of\r\nmatter applied from one animal to another of the same class,” and then he\r\nbrings in the illustration of cowpox to finish the chapter:\r\n\r\n    “The cowpox is a disease well known to the dairy-farmers in\r\n    Gloucestershire. The only appearance on the animal is a phagedaenic\r\n    ulcer on the teat, with apparent inflammation. When communicated to\r\n    the human subject, it produces, besides ulceration on the hand, a\r\n    considerable tumour of the arm, with symptomatic fever, both which\r\n    gradually subside. What is still more extraordinary, as far as facts\r\n    have been hitherto ascertained, the person who has been infected is\r\n    rendered insensible to the variolous poison[1074].”\r\n\r\nJenner’s own essay on the cowpox, when it appeared at length in 1798,\r\nconfirmed these statements as to the phagedaenic or corroding ulcerous\r\ncharacter of the milkers’ sores, in his brief accounts of several cases,\r\nof which it will suffice to mention these two: William Stinchcomb, farm\r\nservant, had his left hand severely affected with several corroding\r\nulcers, and a tumour of considerable size appeared in the axilla of that\r\nside; his right hand had only one small sore. A poor girl, unnamed,\r\n“produced an ulceration on her lip by frequently holding her finger to her\r\nmouth to cool the raging of a cowpox sore by blowing upon it[1075].”\r\nInquiries made by Dr George Pearson in various other dairy counties of\r\nEngland brought out the same character of cowpox in milkers: the painful\r\nsores might be as large as a sixpenny piece, and might last a month or\r\ntwo, causing the milker to give up his work[1076].\r\n\r\nAs to the pap-pox itself, or cowpox in the cow, the most circumstantial\r\naccount was obtained, a few months after Jenner’s first essay, by\r\ninterrogating a veterinary surgeon or cow-doctor, one Clayton, who\r\nattended at most of the farms within ten miles of Gloucester:\r\n\r\n    “That the chief diseases of the cow are the lough, swellings of the\r\n    udder, and cowpox; that the two former are the most common, the latter\r\n    being rarely seen except in spring and summer.\r\n\r\n    That cowpox begins with white specks upon the cow’s teats, which, in\r\n    process of time, ulcerate; and, if not stopped, extend over the whole\r\n    surface of the teats, giving the cow excruciating pain.\r\n\r\n    That, if this disease is suffered to continue for some time, it\r\n    degenerates into ulcers, exuding a malignant and highly corrosive\r\n    matter; but this generally arises from neglect in the incipient stage\r\n    of the disease, or from some other cause he cannot explain.\r\n\r\n    That this disease may arise from any cause irritating or excoriating\r\n    the teats; but that the teats are often chapped without the cowpox\r\n    succeeding. In chaps of the teats, they generally swell; but in the\r\n    cowpox, the teats seldom swell at all, but are gradually destroyed by\r\n    ulceration.\r\n\r\n    That this disease first breaks out upon one cow, and is communicated\r\n    by the milker to the whole herd; but if one person was confined to\r\n    strip the cow having this disease, it would go no farther.\r\n\r\n    That the cowpox is a local disease, and is invariably cured by local\r\n    remedies.\r\n\r\n    That he never knew this disease extend itself in the highest degree to\r\n    the udder, unless mortification had ensued; and that he can at all\r\n    times cure the cowpox in eight or nine days[1077].”\r\n\r\nNo account of cowpox in the cow has ever been given which differs\r\nmaterially from that of this experienced Gloucester cow-doctor in\r\n1798[1078]. Cowpox is not only a local disease, but it is peculiar to\r\ncertain individuals of the species, namely cows in milk; in them it occurs\r\non the teats, so that it was correctly known in Norfolk by the name of\r\npap-pox. The common observation has been that one cow starts it, and that\r\nan infection is rubbed into the teats of others by the fingers of the\r\nmilkers. The cow which develops this ulceration of the paps is usually\r\neither a heifer in her first milk, from which the calf has been taken\r\naway, or a cow in milk which has been bought in a market, with the udder\r\n“overstocked” or left distended for appearance sake, but as yet with no\r\nblemish of the paps. The cause of cowpox is the rough handling of a highly\r\nsensitive part, which was originally adapted only for the lips and tongue\r\nof the calf. Ceely, a correct observer in the Vale of Aylesbury, uses no\r\nexaggerated phrase when he speaks of “the merciless manipulations of the\r\nmilkers.” Men milkers are well known to lack the delicate tact of women;\r\nand cowpox has been most common in the great dairying districts where\r\nmen-milkers are employed. But in some animals cowpox may be produced even\r\nunder gentler handling or with slighter provocation, of which I give a\r\nrecent case from my notebook, taken during a visit to the country:\r\n\r\n    27 April, 1891. Case of cowpox. A maid in the service of Mr J. R. has\r\n    on the ulnar side of the fore finger of the right hand, over the joint\r\n    of the first and second phalanges, a collapsed bleb the size of a\r\n    sixpenny piece, pearly white round the margin, bluish towards the\r\n    centre, which is brown. The forefinger, as well as the wrist and hand\r\n    generally, bears traces of recent inflammation, and was said to have\r\n    been greatly swollen and painful, the pain extending up the arm. There\r\n    is a symmetrical rash of bright red papules on both arms as high as\r\n    the elbows, more copious and bright on the right arm but abundant on\r\n    the left also. The papules are elevated and pointed, with a small zone\r\n    of bright redness of the skin round the base of each. The history is\r\n    as follows: A cow was bought four or five weeks ago to supplement the\r\n    supply of milk from the three ordinarily kept. The new comer proved\r\n    “tough” to milk, so that the maid was obliged, contrary to usual\r\n    practice, to take the paps in the cleft of the fore and middle\r\n    fingers; under this mode of “stripping,” the animal would hardly stand\r\n    quiet to be milked. After a time it was found that one of the paps had\r\n    a black crust upon it, which might have covered originally a chap of\r\n    the skin. The crust would have been displaced in the milking, and\r\n    would have grown again; the sore beneath soon healed. Only one pap was\r\n    affected. None of the other cows was infected. The “tough” cow was at\r\n    length sold as an unsatisfactory milker, and had been sent to a\r\n    distance on the morning of the day on which these notes were made. The\r\n    maid’s finger began to be affected after two or three weeks of milking\r\n    the cow, the beginning of the large and tumid bluish-white vaccine\r\n    vesicle having been like a small wart.\r\n\r\nJenner’s opinion that cowpox was a specific disease “coeval with the brute\r\ncreation,” and that it had been the parent of the great historical\r\nsmallpox of mankind, is not now received as correct. His other opinion,\r\nthat cowpox was derived from the hocks of horses affected with “grease,”\r\nwhich held a central place in his original essay, especially in connexion\r\nwith his doctrine of “true” and “spurious” cowpox, was rejected by most of\r\nhis contemporaries, and is perhaps unsupported by anyone at the present\r\ntime[1079].\r\n\r\nIn the title-page of his first essay, Dr Jenner called this singular\r\nmalady of the cow’s paps by a new name--_variolae vaccinae_, or smallpox\r\nof the cow. Pearson, the earliest and most ardent of Jenner’s original\r\nsupporters, and for several years thereafter a convinced vaccinist, at\r\nonce took exception to the name _variolae vaccinae_ “for the sake of\r\nprecision of language and justness in thinking.” It is a palpable\r\ncatachresis, says he, to designate what is called the cowpox by the\r\ndenomination variolae vaccinae, because the cowpox is a specifically\r\ndifferent distemper from the smallpox in essential particulars, namely, in\r\nthe nature of its morbific poison and in its symptoms[1080].\r\n\r\nThat the term _variolae vaccinae_ in Jenner’s title-page is used\r\ntropically can hardly be doubted; but it is not so easy to say which of\r\nthe great classical tropes it is. It may be objected that “catachresis” is\r\ntoo general for the misuse of a word when that word is a scientific one\r\nand occurs in the leading title of a scientific book. Here we have the\r\nsomewhat specific and purposeful use of a word in an unwonted sense,\r\nwhich, if it fall under any of the scholastic figures of speech, ought to\r\nbe a figure more specifically defined than mere catachresis. In a matter\r\nso important as this one should find the exact figure if possible; but at\r\nthe outset a difficulty arises, namely whether we should look for it in\r\nthe usage of the rhetors, as Isocrates teaches, or in the usage of the\r\nlogicians, as Aristotle lays down the definitions of tropes. If among the\r\nformer class, the nearest is perhaps the hypocorisma, or attractive,\r\nagreeable name for something that is not so nice in itself. If among the\r\nlatter, we shall hardly find a better than the metalepsis, which is a\r\nchange more of mood than of meaning, namely the transition without proof\r\nfrom a supposition to an assertion. But in truth no single figure of the\r\nancient teachers suits this modern instance. We require at least two.\r\nMetalepsis carries us so far, but synecdoche must supplement it. The term\r\n_variolae vaccinae_ is a synecdoche in that it names the cause from the\r\neffect; it is a metalepsis in that it passes abruptly from the\r\nhypothetical mood to the categorical; and in respect that it does both at\r\na stroke it is probably unique, and without precedent among the examples\r\nknown to the ancients. Or again, leaving the graver figures, and\r\ntranslating the Latin name of Jenner’s title-page, one may try the\r\nfigurative conversion of cowpox into smallpox by the standard of pure and\r\nlegitimate paronomasia, of which there is a familiar English example in\r\nthe conversion of a plant into an animal by the verbal play of\r\nhorse-chestnut and chestnut horse in the minor premiss.\r\n\r\nSome in more recent times, mistaking the figurative or rhetorical\r\nintention of Jenner, have understood his Latin name of cowpox as if there\r\nreally were a smallpox of the cow (although not of the bull, nor of the\r\nsteer, the maiden heifer or the calf of either sex). Not being able to\r\nfind a smallpox of the cow in the natural way, they have thought to\r\nsatisfy the legitimate requirements of proof by manufacturing it. Certain\r\nGermans of the Lower Rhine, where the cows ordinarily wear blankets, have\r\nwrapped the blankets taken from smallpox beds round the bodies of cows,\r\nafter clipping the hair close; nothing was found to ensue in these\r\ninteresting experiments except an occasional pimple which had probably\r\nbeen caused by the shears in the preliminary clipping. Others in England,\r\nFrance, America and India, have succeeded in raising a smallpox pustule at\r\nthe point of puncture in the epidermis of the cow or in the more delicate\r\ntransitional epithelium, the matter from which has produced smallpox in\r\nits turn[1081]. But these are academic exercises. The natural cowpox of\r\nthe cow has been likened by none to the natural smallpox of man in a\r\nsustained comparison of all the anatomical and epidemiological particulars\r\nof each; nor, I am persuaded, will anyone ever attempt to draw out such a\r\ncomparison. _Variolae vaccinae_ as a name for cowpox was a figure of\r\nspeech, and it is to misunderstand its original use to treat it as\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\nThe proof that cowpox had some power over smallpox consisted in trying to\r\ninoculate with the latter those who had been previously inoculated with\r\nthe former. The accepted mode of testing the power of inoculated smallpox\r\nitself was to inoculate it again; at first the test for cowpox was to\r\ninoculate with smallpox, but after a few years the testing inoculation was\r\ndone with cowpox itself. The effects of Suttonian inoculation with\r\nsmallpox, as we have seen, were nearly always slight, and sometimes\r\ninvisible (as in Watson’s practice at the Foundling Hospital). A previous\r\ninoculation with cowpox made them slighter still; but even with cowpox in\r\nthe system, the pustules of smallpox rose where the matter had been\r\ninserted on the arm. It may be thought that there were only fine shades of\r\ndifference between the effects of inoculation after cowpoxing and the\r\neffects of the same in a virgin soil; but some difference must have been\r\nperceived, for it was upon that, and upon nothing else, that the authority\r\nin favour of cowpox as a substitute for smallpox in inoculation was\r\npromptly established. The relationship between cowpox and smallpox was\r\nadmitted by all to be in the nature of things “extraordinary,” as Jenner\r\nsaid, or a mystery, as others said; but as an empirical fact many believed\r\nit to be true, because the cowpoxed had less to show for the effects of\r\ninoculation with smallpox than if they had not been cowpoxed. Jenner\r\nhimself is known to have made only two variolous tests. He used crude or\r\nwatery matter from the local pustule of inoculated smallpox, and advised\r\nall his readers to do the same. In one of his two trials, a child Mary\r\nJames had nearly the same effects from inoculation after cowpox that her\r\nmother and another child had from it without having been cowpoxed, namely\r\nthe pustule or confluent group of pustules at the place of puncture, and\r\nthe eruptive fever at the ninth day[1082].\r\n\r\nIn the earliest tests made independently of Jenner, five at\r\nStonehouse[1083], near Stroud, and five at Stroud[1084], in the first\r\nmonths of 1799, the cowpoxed received smallpox afterwards by inoculation\r\n“in the usual slight manner.” In the practice at the Smallpox and\r\nInoculation Hospital, London, in the spring and summer of 1799, many of\r\nthe cowpoxed took smallpox by contagion from the atmosphere of the\r\nhospital, so that Woodville, after a period of perplexity, at length\r\nconcluded that cowpox, while it was still active upon the arm, did not\r\nshut out the action of the smallpox virus in the constitution[1085].\r\n\r\nThe antecedent objections to cowpox, arising out of its non-variolous\r\nnature, were met by appealing to the results of experiments. The authority\r\nin favour of cowpox was speedily established on that ground, and has been\r\ncontinuous to the present time. The experimenters had to decide very nice\r\npoints both in the way of observation and of reasoning. They had to\r\nappraise the margin of difference between the effects of Suttonian\r\ninoculation where cowpox had preceded and where it had not preceded. They\r\nhad to allow for the first virus causing a swelling in the absorbent\r\nglands, which would obstruct the entrance of the second testing virus into\r\nthe blood. They had to average the varying effects of Suttonian\r\ninoculation for its own sake, and the equally varying effects of it as the\r\nvariolous test, and to find a broad difference between the two averages.\r\nHaving decided that preceding cowpox infection did make a real and\r\nappreciable difference to the number of pustules resulting, at the spot or\r\nelsewhere, from the insertion of inoculated smallpox matter, or to the\r\namount of fever, they had next to consider whether that degree of\r\nresistance by a cowpoxed person to inoculation were a good measure of his\r\npower to resist contagion reaching his vitals in the natural way. Their\r\ndiligence and acumen may or may not have been equal to these things--it\r\nwas a slack tide in medical science. Also they received little or no help\r\nfrom Dr Jenner himself, whose inventive genius was of the kind that is apt\r\nto leave the practical value, and even the theoretical probability, of the\r\nproject to be tried by others. The inventor made interest with great\r\npersonages--with the king, the duke of York, and the aristocracy of his\r\ncounty. His priority, and the merits of his project, were referred in 1802\r\nto a Committee of the House of Commons, with Admiral Berkeley as\r\nchairman, which entered on its labours with a strong recommendation from\r\nthe king, endorsed by Addington, the prime minister. They decided in\r\nfavour of Dr Jenner’s claim for remuneration on all the issues, and on 2\r\nJune, 1802, the Committee of the whole House unanimously voted: “That it\r\nis the opinion of the Committee that a sum not exceeding £10,000 be\r\ngranted to his Majesty to be paid as a remuneration to Dr Edward Jenner\r\nfor promulgating the discovery of the Vaccine Inoculation, by which mode\r\nthat dreadful malady the smallpox was prevented[1086].” On 29 July, 1807,\r\na farther sum of £20,000 was voted to him; and on 8 June, 1808, a National\r\nVaccine Establishment was appointed, at an annual cost of about £5,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nChronology of epidemics resumed from 1801.\r\n\r\nIn resuming the history of smallpox from the beginning of the present\r\ncentury, we come first to the deaths in the London Bills of Mortality,\r\nwhich are the only continuous figures. The bills of Parish Clerks’ Hall\r\nhad failed, before they ceased, to include more than two-thirds, perhaps\r\nnot much more than a half, of all the deaths in the capital. The great\r\nparishes of St Pancras and St Marylebone, which returned a somewhat\r\nexcessive share of the deaths both from smallpox and from fever in the\r\nfirst two or three years of the Registration Act (1837-39), as well as the\r\nparishes of Chelsea and Kensington, were never included within the Bills;\r\nalso much of the suburban extension on the other sides of London was never\r\ntaken in. Meanwhile the area of the old Bills had actually become less\r\npopulous owing to the displacement of dwelling houses by warehouses,\r\nworkshops, counting houses, and the like, in the City, the Liberties and\r\nin certain out-parishes such as those bordering the Thames at the east\r\nend.\r\n\r\nStill, the bills of mortality may be taken as showing on the whole fairly\r\nthe proportion of smallpox deaths to other deaths, and the years of its\r\ngreater outbursts.\r\n\r\n_Smallpox in the London Bills of Mortality, 1801-37._\r\n\r\n          Smallpox     All\r\n           deaths     deaths\r\n\r\n  1801      1461      19,374\r\n  1802      1579      19,379\r\n  1803      1202      19,582\r\n  1804       622      17,034\r\n  1805      1685      17,565\r\n  1806      1158      17,938\r\n  1807      1297      18,334\r\n  1808      1169      19,954\r\n  1809      1163      16,680\r\n  1810      1198      19,983\r\n  1811       751      17,043\r\n  1812      1287      18,295\r\n  1813       898      17,322\r\n  1814       638      19,283\r\n  1815       725      19,560\r\n  1816       653      20,316\r\n  1817      1051      19,968\r\n  1818       421      19,705\r\n  1819       712      19,928\r\n  1820       722      19,348\r\n  1821       508      18,451\r\n  1822       604      18,865\r\n  1823       774      20,587\r\n  1824       725      20,237\r\n  1825      1299      21,026\r\n  1826       503      20,758\r\n  1827       616      22,292\r\n  1828       598      21,709\r\n  1829       736      23,524\r\n  1830       627      21,645\r\n  1831       563      25,337\r\n  1832       771      28,606\r\n  1833       574      26,577\r\n  1834       334      21,679\r\n  1835       863      21,415\r\n  1836       536      18,229\r\n  1837       217      21,063\r\n\r\nThe 18th century had ended with a severe epidemic of smallpox (2409\r\ndeaths) in the year 1800; and excepting in the year 1804, the deaths kept\r\nat a somewhat high level for ten years longer. The rise at the end of the\r\nlast century corresponded to a time of distress and a severe epidemic of\r\ntyphus fever. The fever declined after 1803, and remained for a dozen\r\nyears at so low a level that Bateman, in his quarterly reports on the\r\npractice of the Carey Street Dispensary, expresses surprise that there\r\nshould have been so little of it. The same writer, however, has occasion\r\nto remark upon the fatality of smallpox; twice he mentions large\r\nmortalities from it in courts adjoining Shoe Lane[1087]. According to the\r\nfigures, also, smallpox declined less than fever. This means that, in the\r\nsame circumstances, adult lives fared better than infancy and childhood.\r\nBut, on the whole, smallpox shared with fever the advantageous conditions\r\nfor health which obtained in all parts of the kingdom (in Ireland as well\r\nas in Britain) from the decline of the epidemics of 1799-1803 until the\r\nrise of the next epidemics in 1816-19. This period of comparative freedom\r\nfrom smallpox and fever corresponded to the second period of the great\r\nFrench War from its resumption after the failure of the Peace of Amiens\r\nuntil its termination with the Peace of Paris. It may seem surprising that\r\nthis should have been a time of comparatively good public health in Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, inasmuch as it was a time of dear food and heavy\r\ntaxes. The amount of typhus or relapsing fever is the best test; and those\r\ndiseases, by all accounts, were at a lower level in all parts of the\r\nUnited Kingdom from 1804 to 1817 than they had been for many years before\r\nor than they were for many years after. Again, if precedents count for\r\nanything, the same kind of lull in smallpox and fever together is shown in\r\nthe London bills during the war of the Allies against Louis XIV., and\r\nduring the Seven Years War.\r\n\r\nIn Glasgow the decline of smallpox deaths for a few years in the 19th\r\ncentury was perhaps more marked than elsewhere because it was a decline\r\nfrom an excessively high level in the end of the 18th century.\r\n\r\n_Glasgow Mortalities, 1801-12._\r\n\r\n          Smallpox   Measles   All\r\n  Year    deaths     deaths   deaths\r\n\r\n  1801     245         8       1434\r\n  1802     156       168       1770\r\n  1803     194        45       1860\r\n  1804     213        52       1670\r\n  1805      56        90       1671\r\n  1806      28        56       1629\r\n  1807      97        16       1806\r\n  1808      51       787       2623\r\n  1809     159        44       2124\r\n  1810      28        19       2111\r\n  1811     109       267       2342\r\n  1812      78       304       2348\r\n\r\nHere it is not until 1805 that a marked fall in the smallpox deaths takes\r\nplace. In Norwich there was a clear interval from the last severe period\r\nin the end of the 18th century, until the year 1805, when smallpox, “after\r\nbeing for a time almost extinct,” became prevalent again. At the\r\nWhitehaven Dispensary, the contrast between the last years of the 18th\r\ncentury and first years of the 19th is not striking[1088]:\r\n\r\n_Smallpox at Whitehaven Dispensary._\r\n\r\n         Cases    Deaths\r\n\r\n  1795     8        0\r\n  1796    41        5\r\n  1797    (no table)\r\n  1798    51        3\r\n  1799     7        1\r\n  1800   120       11\r\n  1801     9        3\r\n  1802    (no table)\r\n  1803    67       16\r\n  1804     1        0\r\n\r\nCarlisle, which used to share in smallpox as much as Whitehaven, seems to\r\nhave been almost wholly free from it in the first twelve years of the\r\ncentury: at least Dr Heysham, who was no longer statistical, “had reason\r\nto believe” that no person died there of smallpox from the autumn of 1800\r\n(when cowpox inoculation was introduced) until November, 1812[1089].\r\n\r\nThe Newcastle Dispensary, like that of Whitehaven, treated a small\r\nfraction of all the cases of smallpox in the town; but it continued to\r\nhave a fair average of cases and deaths after the century was turned:\r\n\r\n_Smallpox cases attended from Newcastle Dispensary._\r\n\r\n         Cases    Deaths\r\n\r\n  1795      7        1\r\n  1796     19        3\r\n  1797     12        0\r\n  1798     15        3\r\n  1799     --       --\r\n  1800     --       --\r\n  1801     14        4\r\n  1802     --       --\r\n  1803      7        4\r\n  1804      0        0\r\n  1805      7        0\r\n  1806     16        6\r\n\r\nMost places continued to have their periodical epidemics of smallpox as\r\nbefore, although both measles and scarlatina were becoming more and more\r\nits rivals. Boston, Lincolnshire, had its sexennial epidemic in 1802 with\r\nthirty-three deaths. Besides the year 1805, there were two periods in\r\nwhich smallpox was somewhat general, 1807-9 and 1811-13. At Norwich from\r\n1807 to the end of 1809 the bills of mortality showed 203 deaths from\r\nsmallpox[1090]. In 1808 we happen to hear of it also at Sherborne, in\r\nDorset, at Ringwood, in Hampshire, at Cheltenham, at Cambridge and at\r\nEdinburgh, although the great epidemic malady of children in that year was\r\nmeasles[1091]. Lettsom wrote on 25 January, 1808: “The smallpox\r\n(infanticides) and measles have been prevalent and fatal. The coffins for\r\nthe parish poor in England for the smallpox deaths alone have cost\r\n£10,000[1092].”\r\n\r\nIn 1811 it began to be somewhat general again, and rose in London to a\r\nconsiderable epidemic in 1812, the deaths in summer rising to sixty in a\r\nweek[1093]. A village epidemic of 46 cases and 7 deaths is reported from\r\nNorth Queensferry, near Edinburgh, from 14 December, 1811 to 7 March,\r\n1812[1094]. At Norwich from 10 February to 3 September, 1813, there were\r\n65 deaths[1095]. The rise from 1811 to 1813 coincided with an increase of\r\nfever, the winter of 1811-12 having been a time of dearth and depressed\r\ntrade, especially in the manufacturing districts. After that came a\r\nnotable lull both in fever and smallpox, which was at length broken by the\r\nepidemics of each in 1817 in Ireland, Scotland and England, coincidently\r\nwith the depression of trade and dislocation of commerce that began\r\neverywhere as soon as the great war was over.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Smallpox Epidemic of 1817-19.\r\n\r\nThe same things that favoured the prevalence of typhus and relapsing fever\r\nin times of distress, favoured also the rise of smallpox to the height of\r\nan epidemic. Hence the greater epidemics of smallpox in the first half of\r\nthe 19th century coincided somewhat closely with epidemics of relapsing or\r\ntyphus fever,--in 1817-19, in 1825-27, in 1837-40, and in 1847-49. That\r\nwhich fever was to the adolescents and adults in times of distress, the\r\nsame was smallpox to the infants and young children. The young children of\r\na family did, indeed, take fever sometimes as well as the parents or the\r\nyoung persons in it; but the children seldom died of it. They died of\r\nsmallpox (or of measles or whooping cough or the like), perhaps all the\r\nmore readily that they would have been weakened by the fever, and by the\r\nwant of food and comforts which attended it. Thus, while fever and\r\nsmallpox went somewhat closely hand in hand during times of distress, it\r\nwas the adolescents and adults that died of fever, the infants and young\r\nchildren that died of smallpox. The following table, compiled from the\r\nreports of the Whitehaven Dispensary from 1783 to 1800, will show how many\r\nchildren survived attacks of continued fever in comparison with their\r\nelders[1096]:\r\n\r\n_Continued Fever at Whitehaven Dispensary, 1783-1800._\r\n\r\n                Under\r\n         Total 2 years 2-5  -10  -15  -20  -30  -40  -50  -60  -70 -80\r\n\r\n  Cases  1712    40    142  240  223  150  240  236  202   92   47  15\r\n  Deaths   85     0      0    5    2    6   14   20   19   12    7   0\r\n\r\nThe deaths from smallpox are found nearly always to be high when the\r\ndeaths from fever are high. The correspondence, however, is not always\r\nexact to months or quarters, or half-years; for it is not unusual in the\r\nLondon weekly bills to find a run of weeks with high deaths from smallpox\r\njust before or after a run of weeks with high deaths from fever. The\r\ndomestic circumstances which spread the contagion of fever were such as\r\nmight be expected to spread the contagion of smallpox, namely, the pawning\r\nof clothes, bedding and the like, on a vast scale in times of scarcity,\r\nthe crowding of many in single rooms or in one bed, the wandering of men\r\nand women, attended by their children, in search of work, the exposure of\r\nchildren in the smallpox so as to extort alms. All these things were\r\ncommon in Ireland, Scotland and England during the long periods of\r\ndepressed trade, alternating with periods of speculation and expansion,\r\nfor which the generation following the Peace of Paris was remarkable. We\r\nhear far more of the fever than of the smallpox, because the former\r\ntouched the lives of breadwinners, while the latter was often regarded as\r\na matter of course[1097]. Thus, in the Irish famine of 1817-18, it is\r\npossible to estimate the prevalence of dysentery, relapsing fever and\r\ntyphus fever by the aid of various records, including two treatises and\r\nthe reports of a Parliamentary Committee. There are also two or three\r\nbrief references to smallpox; but no one would have supposed that smallpox\r\ncaused actually more deaths than fever itself, as in the following returns\r\nof burials in the Cathedral churchyard of Armagh, from 1st May to 25th\r\nDecember, 1818[1098]:\r\n\r\n  Smallpox deaths     180\r\n  Fever deaths        165\r\n  All other deaths    118\r\n\r\n--the total of 463 being twice or thrice the numbers for the corresponding\r\nmonths of non-epidemic years. Whether there was as much smallpox in other\r\nprovinces of Ireland as in Ulster, does not appear; but the following\r\nrelating to Strabane and Londonderry will serve to prove that Armagh was\r\nnot exceptional in the north of Ireland. In and around Strabane, smallpox\r\nbegan to spread in May, 1817, having been hardly known in the\r\nneighbourhood for years before; it was often confluent and was “fatal to\r\nhundreds” of children[1099]. The same severity of the epidemic is reported\r\nalso from the county of Derry in 1817: “Cases of smallpox appeared in\r\ngreater numbers than I had ever before witnessed, even previous to the\r\nvaluable discovery of Jenner[1100].”\r\n\r\nThe vagrancy of the Irish peasants, not only cottiers but also many small\r\nfarmers, began in Ulster in the end of the year 1816, after a wet autumn\r\nwhich ruined the crops; and it is probable that the contagion of smallpox\r\nbegan to be spread among their children about the same time. Whether a\r\nmigration set in to England and Scotland at that time is not clear. It\r\nappears, indeed, that the first of the epidemic in England, in Whitehaven,\r\nUlverston, and other places which were in direct communication with the\r\nNorth of Ireland, was at least as early as, and perhaps earlier than, the\r\noutbreak of the malady in that country. The whole of the United Kingdom\r\nwas suffering in 1816 from depression of trade, and many of the labouring\r\nclass were tramping from place to place in search of work. The following\r\nis the account of smallpox being brought to Ulverston[1101]:\r\n\r\n    “The smallpox were brought to Ulverston from Wigan, by the wife of a\r\n    nailer, who, with her child had slept in a house where the family had\r\n    just recovered from them, in the latter end of January, 1816, or\r\n    beginning of February. She immediately returned to Ulverston and the\r\n    eruption appeared on the child about ten days afterwards, when it was\r\n    carried about by the mother and much exposed in different parts of the\r\n    town. They soon removed from this place; and I believe the child died\r\n    between this place and Kendal.”\r\n\r\nA young woman of Ulverston who was much in the company of the nailer’s\r\nwife from Wigan, caught smallpox from her child, and died on 22 February;\r\nher sister sickened soon after, and had the disease favourably. An\r\nepidemic followed in the town, of which some particulars are known down to\r\nOctober, 1816; the disease was very fatal also in Whitehaven at the same\r\ntime. Two things gave a particular interest to the Ulverston smallpox of\r\n1816, two things which were found to characterize the epidemic everywhere\r\nin England and Scotland as it spread in 1817, 1818 and 1819. These were,\r\nfirst the numerous cases of smallpox among those who had been inoculated\r\nwith cowpox, a sequel now obvious on a large scale for the first time; and\r\nsecondly, the admixture of a good many cases of “crystalline” or “hornpox”\r\neruptions among the usual pustular cases. There was nothing new in such\r\ncrystalline eruptions in smallpox; for example Huxham mentions them at\r\nPlymouth in 1752. But they were always curious, and it was always a matter\r\nof wonder that they should happen in one epidemic and not in another. Of\r\nthirty-five cases tabulated from the Ulverston epidemic of 1816, twelve\r\nhad the “horny pox,” or the “small horny kind,” all the rest having the\r\nordinary pustules of smallpox, sometimes discrete, sometimes confluent,\r\nfour being scarred, and one covered by “a complete cake of incrustation.”\r\nAll those thirty-five cases were above five years of age, except one child\r\nof three, and they seem to have nearly all recovered. Nothing is said of\r\nthe infants and children under the age of five, who then contributed\r\nthree-fourths of the mortality in every epidemic of smallpox. The\r\ncrystalline eruption was not chickenpox; for the three first cases of it\r\nhad all gone through chickenpox before.\r\n\r\nAlmost identical in tenour with this account from Ulverston is the\r\nnarrative of an epidemic at Newton Stewart, in Wigton, just across the\r\nSolway from Cumberland, which began in the autumn of 1816, but did not\r\nextend until the following summer[1102]. The first case was one of\r\n“hornpox” in a girl from London; the second case was in a companion of\r\nthe former, in the same family, her disease being ordinary pustular\r\nsmallpox; both had been vaccinated. One hundred cases in the epidemic were\r\nthus assorted:\r\n\r\n                        Cases  Deaths\r\n\r\n  Smallpox                43     13\r\n  Modified hornpox, &c.   47      0\r\n  Varicella               10      0\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the mortality of the whole was thirteen per cent., an\r\nordinary mortality for a country town. There were all extremes, from\r\nconfluent smallpox to discrete, many of the discrete having no proper\r\npustules “but hard vesicles of more or less tubercular appearance....\r\nThese were termed by the people _nerles_ or _hornpox_, and have long been\r\nnoticed by very aged matrons, who pretend to no little skill in the\r\ndiagnostics of smallpox, and who have distinct varieties by name, beyond\r\nthe enumeration of any nosologist.” Their diagnostic skill was natural\r\nenough, for the practice in smallpox had been almost entirely in their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nA certain proportion of hornpox cases was so characteristic of this\r\nepidemic (1816-19) as to have been remarked everywhere--in England as well\r\nas in Scotland. The epidemic was not well reported as a whole at any one\r\nplace. Sometimes, as at Ulverston, only the vaccinated cases were given;\r\nat other times, as at Cupar Fife and Edinburgh, only the “hornpox” cases\r\nwere given; again, in the account of the Norwich epidemic, which is the\r\nfullest, the large number of cases with crystalline or horny eruption were\r\nnot counted in as smallpox cases at all. Dewar’s table of the Cupar Fife\r\nepidemic, in the spring of 1817, included 70 cases, all of crystalline or\r\nhornpox[1103]. The latter variety was part of the epidemic at St\r\nAndrews[1104].\r\n\r\nThe Edinburgh cases which Thomson heard of to the end of the epidemic\r\nnumbered 556, assorted as follows[1105]:\r\n\r\n  310 had been vaccinated.\r\n  41 had had smallpox (doubtless by inoculation).\r\n  205 had neither been vaccinated nor had smallpox.\r\n\r\nA large proportion had the crystalline eruption, while some of the deaths\r\nare put down to “malignant crystalline water-pock.” At Lanark and New\r\nLanark the epidemic was also taken notice of[1106]. At the latter were\r\nsituated the cotton mills managed under Robert Owen’s co-operative system;\r\nand it appears that vaccination had been somewhat generally carried out in\r\nthis socialist community. The following was the incidence of smallpox upon\r\n322 persons:\r\n\r\n  251 had been vaccinated.\r\n  3 were under vaccination at the time.\r\n  11 had been inoculated with smallpox, or had gone through the natural\r\n        smallpox.\r\n  57 had neither been vaccinated nor variolated.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that this was the first severe and general epidemic in\r\nScotland since the beginning of the century, although we have seen that\r\nthe disease had never been out of Glasgow. Thomson saw well enough how\r\nthat epidemiological fact told: “It is to the severity of this epidemic, I\r\nam convinced, that we ought to attribute the greatness of the number of\r\nthe vaccinated who have been attacked by it, and not to any deterioration\r\nin the qualities of cowpox virus, or to any defects in the manner in which\r\nit has been employed. [Dewar said the same for Cupar Fife.] Had a\r\nvariolous constitution of the atmosphere, similar to that which we have\r\nlately experienced, existed at the time Dr Jenner brought forward his\r\ndiscovery, it may be doubted whether it ever could have obtained the\r\nconfidence of the public.” Thomson himself, professor of military surgery\r\nin Edinburgh and a person of high character, drew the most astonishing\r\ninferences from the tolerably simple facts of the epidemic in 1817-19. The\r\ncrystalline was mixed with the ordinary pustular smallpox in this\r\nepidemic, as it had been in some 18th century epidemics; it was common to\r\nthose who had been vaccinated and to those who had not been so; it\r\noccurred in those who had previously gone through the chickenpox. Yet the\r\nprofessor concluded that crystalline or hornpox was smallpox “modified” by\r\nvaccination, that it should be called “varioloid,” and that “modified”\r\nsmallpox and chickenpox were the same disease.\r\n\r\nSeveral cases of smallpox had occurred in the spring of 1816 at Quarndon,\r\ntwo miles from Derby, one or two of the nine cases proving fatal. Several\r\nof the Derby doctors went to see them, some calling them “aggravated\r\nchickenpox,” and others “mild smallpox after vaccination.” In the spring\r\nfollowing (1817), most of the children and young people in the villages of\r\nBreadsall, Smalling, Spondon, Heaver, and others near Derby, were\r\nafflicted with the epidemic, which declined in autumn. It came back in the\r\nspring of 1818, when it spread more generally than before, and was still\r\nprevalent at the end of that year, in Nottinghamshire and Staffordshire as\r\nwell as in Derbyshire. In Herefordshire, also, in February, 1818, “typhus,\r\nmeasles and smallpox were at once raging.” The disease proved fatal in\r\nmany instances among the lower orders in Derbyshire, who still followed\r\nthe heating regimen, giving the children saffron to drink, and holding\r\nthem in blankets before a strong fire, to bring the eruption out; but it\r\nwas fatal also to some who were treated more rationally. In this part of\r\nEngland, as in Lancashire, Wigtonshire, Fifeshire, Edinburgh, and\r\nelsewhere, a large proportion of the cases had the crystalline eruption of\r\nsmallpox, horny or glassy pimples or hard vesicles, which dried about the\r\nsixth day. But, said Dr Bent, the peculiar form “is the same in those\r\npersons who have never had the cowpox and in those who have passed through\r\nthat disease satisfactorily.” His two drawings of the characteristic\r\nhornpox were made from unvaccinated children. On the very day of his\r\nwriting he had seen two children in the same family, both with the\r\ncrystalline eruption, the one vaccinated and the other not. In his\r\npractice at the Derby Infirmary, one in-patient and one out-patient had\r\ndied of smallpox after vaccination, and one out-patient had died of it who\r\nhad not been vaccinated. He was greatly astonished, after all that had\r\nbeen said of the certainty of cowpox protection[1107].\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of 1817-19 was longest in reaching the Eastern Counties, just\r\nas that of 1741-42 had been, and that of 1837-39 was to be. It was also\r\ntowards the close of 1818 and beginning of 1819 that the disease became\r\nfrequent in Canterbury. When it did reach Norwich, Lynn and many other\r\nplaces in Norfolk and Suffolk it became unusually destructive. The history\r\nof smallpox in Norwich from the beginning of the century was a history of\r\nthe usual periodic epidemics, such as the city had been visited by in\r\nformer times, according to the records in Blomefield’s _History_ or other\r\nsources. The first epidemic was in the year 1805, when smallpox was\r\nunusually common in London also. The next, with 203 deaths, lasted from\r\n1807 to 1809. In 1813, the bills again showed many deaths by it from 10\r\nFebruary to 3 September. For fully four years after that there was not a\r\ndeath from smallpox reported in Norwich. In June, 1818, by which time the\r\nepidemic had reached large dimensions in Ireland, Scotland, and part of\r\nEngland, it was brought to Norwich by a girl who had come with her parents\r\nfrom York; it spread little at the time, the deaths to the end of the year\r\nbeing only two. Meanwhile measles was a very frequent and fatal disease\r\namong the children in Norwich throughout the year 1818. The smallpox began\r\nto rage in April, 1819, after which the measles was hardly met with, and\r\nonly a few cases of scarlatina. The following table shows the enormous\r\nrapidity with which smallpox went through the infants and children of the\r\nNorwich populace when it had once fairly begun[1108]:\r\n\r\n                  Deaths from   Deaths from\r\n  1819            smallpox      other diseases   Total\r\n\r\n  January             3              61             64\r\n  February            0              71             71\r\n  March               2              68             70\r\n  April              15              61             76\r\n  May                73              63            136\r\n  June              156              70            226\r\n  July              142              61            203\r\n  August             84              63            147\r\n  September          42              96            138\r\n  October            10              63             73\r\n  November            2              62             64\r\n  December            1              83             84\r\n                   ----            ----           ----\r\n                    530             822           1352\r\n\r\nIn one week of June, there were forty-three burials from smallpox. Half\r\nthe deaths were of infants under two years; nearly all the rest were of\r\nchildren under ten:\r\n\r\n  Total 0-2  -4 -6 -8 -10 -15 -20 -30 -40\r\n\r\n   530  260 132 85 26  17   5   2   2   1\r\n\r\nIf the deaths were at the rate of one in about six cases, there would have\r\nbeen some three thousand children attacked in a population of 50,000 of\r\nall ages. Two hundred cases which Cross kept notes of were classified by\r\nhim thus:\r\n\r\n  Mild         75\r\n  Severe       78\r\n  Confluent    42\r\n  Petechial     5\r\n\r\nForty-six of these died, a rather high rate of 23 per cent., which is due\r\nperhaps to the crystalline or hornpox cases being excluded from the\r\ndefinition of smallpox altogether; all the petechial or haemorrhagic cases\r\ndied, and most of the confluent. Sloughing of the face, lips or labia,\r\noccurred in three children, and bloody stools in many of the worst cases.\r\nThose 200 cases occurred in 112 families, comprising 603 individuals, of\r\nwhom nearly one-half (297) “had smallpox formerly” (including the\r\ninoculated form of it, doubtless).\r\n\r\nThis was a great epidemic for Norwich in the 19th century. The public\r\nhealth there, as elsewhere, had improved greatly since the 18th century.\r\nIn 1742 the deaths had been increased 502 by smallpox; but in that year, a\r\nyear of severe typhus, the deaths from all causes were 1953, against 1352\r\nin 1819. One reason of the enormous smallpox mortality from May to\r\nSeptember, 1819, was the number of susceptible children, all the greater\r\nthat there had been hardly any smallpox for five years, whereas in towns\r\nsuch as Norwich in the 18th century it appears to have been perennial: all\r\nthe greater, also, because “the removal of families from the country to\r\nNorwich, during a flourishing and improving state of our manufactures for\r\ntwo or three preceding years, gave a sudden increase to the number of\r\nthose liable to the disease.” Norwich may have been better off than many\r\nother towns; but the winter of 1816-17, when the smallpox epidemic began,\r\nwas a time of depressed trade, many families being on the move in search\r\nof work; and it does not appear that all those who crowded to Norwich had\r\nfound employment. The epidemic was “confined almost exclusively to the\r\nvery lowest orders of the people;” the contagion was spread abroad among\r\nthem by the shifts they were reduced to in their indigence--“the public\r\nexposure of hideous objects just recovering, loaded with scabs, at the\r\nstreet corners.” Yet this deplorable state of want and beggary does not\r\nseem to have been accompanied with much typhus fever among the adult\r\npopulation, as it certainly was in 1742. Cross describes a petechial\r\nfever, in May, June and July, 1819, which was fatal in all the cases that\r\nhe was called to; but he speaks of it only among children. Whenever the\r\npopulation increases rapidly, as it had been doing in the second decade of\r\nthe 19th century, it is upon the young lives that epidemic mortality falls\r\nmost. The smallpox epidemic at Norwich in 1819 caused rather more deaths\r\nthan in 1742, when the public health was very much worse; but it would\r\nhardly have caused so many had it not been aided by the state of\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of 1819 spread all over East Anglia[1109]. At Lynn there had\r\nbeen a good deal of the disease three years before; in 1819 there were so\r\nmany deaths from it that in June the clergy ordered the smallpox burials\r\nto be specially marked in the register, from which date until the end of\r\nAugust they numbered forty. At Yarmouth the epidemic was still raging at\r\nthe end of 1819. Of ninety-one surgeons in Norfolk and Suffolk who replied\r\nto a circular issued by Cross, all but eleven saw cases of smallpox in\r\n1819, three had had cases in 1818, two had seen the disease in 1817, and\r\none in 1816. Generally speaking, the disease had been in abeyance in those\r\ncounties for seven years; a surgeon of Prudham, whose practice covered\r\neleven parishes, had seen no case of smallpox for twelve years before. The\r\nlargest number of deaths in the practice of any one surgeon was twelve.\r\nTwenty-eight surgeons together had 598 smallpox patients, with 97 deaths;\r\nbut in their districts there had been 180 deaths besides from the same\r\ndisease, in families unvisited by them.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of this epidemic in London are most meagre. In the bills of\r\nmortality, now become quite inadequate to the whole capital, the deaths\r\nrose to 1051 in 1817, fell next year to 421, and in 1819 were 712. But it\r\nwas in the year 1819 that the admissions to the smallpox hospital were\r\nmost numerous, namely, 193, the highest number since the epidemic of 1805,\r\nwhen they were 280 in the year. The horny or crystalline kind of smallpox\r\nwas found in London, as elsewhere[1110].\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1818, “smallpox _post vaccinationem_” was frequent among\r\nthe boys of Christ’s Hospital[1111]. None of the cases proved fatal that\r\nyear, but there was a death in the school from smallpox in 1820, probably\r\nthe last fatality from that cause in the history of the school[1112].\r\n\r\nA few casual notices of smallpox in England in the years following the\r\nepidemic of 1817-19 lead one to suppose that the disease did not again\r\nfall to that apparent extinction which it had reached before the last\r\nepidemic began. It is heard of in and around Chichester in 1821; nineteen\r\nsurgeons who supplied Dr John Forbes with information had seen about 130\r\nto 140 cases, with 20 deaths; about 80 of the cases were in persons\r\npreviously inoculated with cowpox, 19 cases (or the most of 19) were in\r\npersons previously inoculated with smallpox[1113]. This was doubtless the\r\nexperience of paying patients only; according to the East Anglian\r\nprecedent of 1819 there would have been twice as much smallpox in families\r\nwho received no professional treatment. Canterbury is another town from\r\nwhich a rapidly spreading epidemic of smallpox is reported--in the winter\r\nof 1823-4. It continued into the winter and spring of 1824-25, among the\r\npoor, fatal cases being by no means rare. Dr Carter frequently saw\r\nchildren exposed in the streets of Canterbury with smallpox upon them; he\r\nappealed to the mayor to have some check imposed on the spread of\r\ncontagion, but nothing was done, and smallpox was still prevalent at the\r\ndate of his writing in the autumn of 1824[1114]. The same year there was\r\na severe epidemic at Oxford. These were probably only samples of\r\nepidemics filling the interval from 1819 to 1825, when smallpox again\r\nbecame general.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtent of Inoculation with Cowpox or Smallpox, 1801-1825.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years had now passed since cowpox became the rival or\r\nsubstitute of the old matter of inoculation. The history at this point\r\nrequires some notice of the extent to which each of those methods was\r\npractised. Professional opinion, or that part of it which found\r\nexpression, was for the most part in favour of cowpox. The Smallpox and\r\nInoculation Hospital of London took the lead, under Woodville, in\r\nsubstituting cowpox for smallpox, and other public institutions, such as\r\nthe Newcastle and Whitehaven Dispensaries, quickly followed. The new mode\r\nwas practised upon larger numbers than the old. At the Newcastle\r\nDispensary the inoculations of smallpox from 1786 to 1801 had been 3268;\r\nthe inoculations of cowpox from 1801 to 1825 were 20,264. At the\r\nWhitehaven Dispensary 173 children were inoculated with smallpox in 1796,\r\nthe total inoculations before that having been 906. To the end of 1803 the\r\ntotal vaccinations were 490, of which many were done during the severe\r\noutbreak of smallpox in 1803.\r\n\r\nIn Glasgow, where the old inoculation was either little practised or of\r\nlittle use, the Jennerian mode was received with favour, and was offered\r\nto the children of the working classes gratuitously at the Hall of the\r\nFaculty of Physicians and Surgeons. From the 15th of May, 1801, to the\r\n31st of December, 1811, these public vaccinations numbered 14,500, an\r\naverage of about 1400 in the year. In the next seven years they declined\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  1812     950\r\n  1813    1162\r\n  1814     875\r\n  1815     926\r\n  1816     980\r\n  1817     820\r\n  1818     650\r\n\r\nOn the revival of smallpox the Glasgow Cowpock Institution was opened on\r\n28 August, 1818, and vaccinated 146 to the 1st of January, 1819. The\r\nsmaller demand for even gratuitous vaccination of infants after 1812 was\r\nowing to the very small amount of smallpox in Glasgow in those years; in\r\nthe six years, 1813-19, there were said (by Cleland) to have been only 236\r\ndeaths from smallpox in a total of 22,060 deaths from all causes, or 1·07\r\nper cent. of all deaths[1115]. Not more than a fourth part of all the\r\ninfants born in Glasgow had been vaccinated in the years 1812 to 1818, and\r\nthat was the time when smallpox was at its lowest point among the\r\ninfantile causes of death. In some of those years when smallpox was in\r\nabeyance measles was most destructive. It was currently said in Glasgow\r\nthat vaccination, if it discouraged smallpox, predisposed to measles, an\r\nopinion of the populace which Malthus shared from the _à priori_ point of\r\nview. But in a survey of the individual cases in their practice the\r\nGlasgow doctors did not find that those were the relevant circumstances,\r\nwhatever the truly relevant things may have been. Thus, Dr Robert Watt, a\r\ngood observer and cautious reasoner, who became president of the Glasgow\r\nfaculty, wrote: “The only family within my knowledge where three died of\r\nthe measles in 1808 was one where none of the children had been either\r\nvaccinated or had had the smallpox. I met with another family where two\r\ndied in the same circumstances”--that is to say, five children, in two\r\nfamilies, escaped smallpox to die of measles, no artificial interference\r\nhaving been attempted[1116].\r\n\r\nManchester was another populous district where vaccination had been freely\r\noffered to the poorer classes. Roberton, writing in 1827, says that it had\r\nbeen on the decline for several years, and gives the following figures for\r\nthe earlier period, May, 1815, to May, 1823[1117]: At the Manchester\r\nLying-in Charity the annual average of deliveries was 2667, while the\r\nnumber of infants brought back for vaccination averaged 1392 in a year.\r\nDuring the same eight years public vaccinations at the Manchester\r\nInfirmary averaged 1700 annually. Great numbers of infants were said,\r\nalso, to have been vaccinated gratuitously by druggists. The decline in\r\nthe number of vaccinations, which had perhaps begun some time before (as\r\nat Glasgow), was shown conclusively by the returns for the two years May,\r\n1824--May, 1826. The births at the Lying-in Charity averaged 3285 per\r\nannum; but the vaccinations in the infants brought back to the charity,\r\ntogether with those brought to the Manchester Infirmary, averaged only\r\n1309 per annum.\r\n\r\nNewcastle, Glasgow and Manchester were probably favourable instances of\r\nthe extent of public vaccinations in the first quarter of the century. In\r\nLondon the proportion of vaccinations to births is known to have been\r\nsmaller, although there was more money going and at one time four public\r\ncharities--the Vaccine Pock Institution, the Royal Jennerian Society,\r\nWalker’s offshoot from the latter, and the Inoculation Hospital. The\r\nfollowing were the vaccinations at the Inoculation Hospital in four\r\nperiods of five years each from 1806[1118]:\r\n\r\n  1806-10      7,004\r\n  1811-15      9,339\r\n  1816-20      13,348\r\n  1821-25      16,666\r\n               ------\r\n               46,357\r\n\r\n  Annual average 2317.\r\n\r\nAt Norwich, Dr Rigby succeeded in 1812 in persuading the Board of\r\nGuardians to offer half-a-crown premium to parents for each child brought\r\nto be vaccinated. The premiums paid were as follows:\r\n\r\n  1812 (12 Aug.-31 Dec.)   1066\r\n  1813                      511\r\n  1814                       47\r\n  1815                       11\r\n  1816                      348\r\n  1817                       49\r\n  1818                       64\r\n\r\n--the annual births being from a thousand to twelve hundred[1119].\r\n\r\nAt the Canterbury Hospital the applications for free vaccinations\r\nfluctuated as follows:\r\n\r\n  1818                      52\r\n  1819                     249\r\n  1820                     263\r\n  1821                      47\r\n  1822                      35\r\n  1823                      50\r\n  1824 (Jan.-July)         588\r\n\r\nThe sudden rise in 1819-20 and again in 1824 was owing to smallpox being\r\nepidemic in the city. During the severe epidemic of 1824 there were 250\r\nvaccinations at the Dispensary, besides the 588 at the hospital[1120]. At\r\nKendal the following is the Dispensary record of vaccinations for three\r\nyears, the annual average of births being 390[1121]:\r\n\r\n  1819       221\r\n  1820       102\r\n  1821        73\r\n\r\nThese are examples of the spasmodic demand for vaccination in the towns.\r\nThe following is an instance of general vaccination in a village during an\r\nepidemic:\r\n\r\nThe village of North Queensferry, near Edinburgh, had a population of 390.\r\nThere was an epidemic of smallpox from 14 December, 1811, to 7 March,\r\n1812, during which time 46 children, from one to fifteen years, were\r\nattacked, and seven died, the same number that had died in the last\r\nepidemic, in 1797. When the epidemic was over there were only nine persons\r\nin the village, most of them aged, who had neither had smallpox nor\r\ncowpox. Those who had been vaccinated numbered 132; while of those\r\n“formerly vaccinated” only two were included among the 46 children who\r\ncaught smallpox in 1811-12. The adult population must have nearly all gone\r\nthrough smallpox in former epidemics[1122]. These general vaccinations\r\nduring or towards the end of an epidemic were exactly comparable to the\r\ngeneral inoculations by the old method. At Norwich, where a premium of\r\nhalf-a-crown was given to parents for each vaccination, the epidemic of\r\nsmallpox in 1819 stimulated the practice somewhat, the increase in July\r\nand August having followed a public meeting of the inhabitants and a\r\ncombined effort of the doctors:\r\n\r\n                               Progress of\r\n              Progress of       premium\r\n             the mortality     vaccinations\r\n\r\n  January          3               26\r\n  February         0               51\r\n  March            2              101\r\n  April           15              226\r\n  May             73              226\r\n  June           156               92\r\n  July           142              301\r\n  August          84              359\r\n  September       42               14\r\n  October         10                4\r\n  November         2                2\r\n  December         1                0\r\n\r\nCross estimated that a fifth part of the population of Norwich (50,000)\r\nwere vaccinated--8000 before the epidemic of 1819, and 2000 during the\r\nepidemic. Many of the adults had been through the smallpox in the ordinary\r\nway in former epidemics. The state of vaccination throughout Norfolk and\r\nSuffolk was indicated in the answers made by ninety-one practitioners to\r\nthe circular of queries sent out by Cross. Twenty-six had done 13,313\r\nvaccinations during the epidemic of 1819. The whole number in the\r\npractice of those ninety-one from first to last had been 120,000, two of\r\nthe practitioners having vaccinated none.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, as well as the records enable us to do, the extent of the new\r\npractice in the first quarter of the century, it was systematically\r\ncarried out from year to year among the infants of large towns, such as\r\nGlasgow, Newcastle, Manchester and London, and in these the maximum of\r\ngratuitous vaccinations in proportion to the births may have been\r\none-half. In smaller towns and in country parishes the inoculations of\r\ncowpox, like those of smallpox, appear to have been irregular or by fits\r\nand starts, the alarm of smallpox being the occasion for them. But after\r\nthe epidemic of 1817-19, which was the most general since cowpox had been\r\ntried, it was not mere negligence or procrastination that kept parents\r\nback, it was distrust of the new practice and preference for the old.\r\n\r\nThe original mode of inoculation, with the matter of smallpox itself, was\r\nfar from being supplanted by its rival. In Jenner’s first essay the latter\r\nwas put forward tentatively, not indeed because of any want of confidence\r\nin asserting its protective powers, but because it was only in certain\r\ncircumstances that a substitute was desired for the old inoculation. Some\r\nof those who took up the new matter soon discontinued the old altogether,\r\nas at the Newcastle and Whitehaven Dispensaries. At the London Inoculation\r\nHospital the old practice was given up for out-patients after 1807, and\r\nfor in-patients about 1821. In private practice, tastes or preferences\r\ndiffered. While ordinary people left it to the discretion of their medical\r\nadvisers, commissioning them to inoculate their children “with either kind\r\nof pock,” the upper classes “judge for themselves, and those among them\r\nwho are philanthropists and converts to the new faith inoculate their own\r\nchildren and those of the poor together[1123].” Moseley, in 1808, said\r\nthat the “mere operative practice” in cowpox, by which phrase he meant to\r\ncontrast the academic countenance of it by eminent physicians and\r\nsurgeons, had been “chiefly carried on by lady-doctors, wrong-headed\r\nclergymen, and disorderly men-midwives,” Dr Pearson being named as the\r\nonly man of letters or pretensions to science who had been practically\r\nconcerned in it of late[1124].\r\n\r\nThere was really little to choose between the new method and the old so\r\nfar as concerned facility of operating; if anything, the inoculation of\r\nsmallpox was the more difficult of the two, although that also was largely\r\npractised by amateurs[1125]. Again, as regards remunerativeness,\r\ninoculation with smallpox no longer required the combined services of a\r\nphysician, a surgeon and an apothecary; it had become a matter of simple\r\nroutine, just as ill paid (or as well paid, according to circumstances) as\r\ninoculation with the matter from the cow. It was not on such grounds, but\r\non grounds of scientific principle or of sentimental interest, that an\r\nactive propaganda was kept up in favour of the old inoculation. The\r\nleading defenders of the latter, such as Moseley, physician to Chelsea\r\nHospital, and Birch, surgeon to St Thomas’s Hospital, maintained that\r\ncowpox was alien in nature to smallpox and could not be received as its\r\nequivalent. The foreign protagonists, such as Dr Müller, of Frankfort, and\r\nDr Verdier, of Paris, emphasized still more the radical unlikeness of\r\ncowpox to smallpox. Said Verdier: “The vaccinists appeal to experience,\r\nsetting aside all objections based upon the unlikeness of cowpox to\r\nsmallpox. We are to be made invulnerable by vaccine as Achilles was made\r\ninvulnerable by being dipped in the waters of the Styx. Protection by\r\ncowpox contradicts the received principle of inoculation. It is in vain to\r\nappeal to experience against established principles: for true principles\r\nare the result of the experience of all ages, and become the touchstone of\r\neach successive empirical innovation.”\r\n\r\nThe English inoculators by the old method gave all sorts of reasons for\r\ntheir preference, and were doubtless actuated by the usual mixture of\r\nmotives. There were medical families, such as the Lipscombs, who had an\r\nhereditary interest and pride in inoculation. It was a Lipscomb who had\r\nrecited in the Sheldonian Theatre during the Oxford commemoration of\r\n1772, a poem, “On the Beneficial Effects of Inoculation.” Inoculators to\r\nthe third generation, it was not surprising that the Lipscomb family\r\nshould have caused to be printed in 1807, as if to shame the changing\r\nfashion of the day, the prize poem of five-and-thirty years before, which\r\ncontained such spirited lines as these:\r\n\r\n  “When, pierced with grief at sad Britannia’s woes,\r\n   Her country’s guardian Montagu arose:\r\n   Pure patriot zeal her ev’ry thought inspir’d,\r\n   Glow’d on her cheek, and all her bosom fir’d.\r\n   She saw the Tyrant rage without controul,\r\n   While just revenge inflam’d her gen’rous soul.\r\n   Full well she knew, when beauty’s charms decay’d,\r\n   Britannia’s drooping laurels soon would fade:\r\n   Pierc’d with deep anguish at the afflictive thought\r\n   And whelm’d with shame, a heav’n-taught Nymph she sought,\r\n   Whose potent arm, with wondrous power endued,\r\n   Had oft on Turkey’s plains the fiend subdued.\r\n   Obedient to her prayer the willing Maid\r\n   In pity came to sad Britannia’s aid.\r\n   ‘Henceforth, fall’n Tyrant!’ cries the Nymph, ‘no more\r\n   Hope that just Heav’n will thy lost pow’r restore:\r\n   Let now no more thy touch profane defile\r\n   The sacred beauties of Britannia’s isle.\r\n   By me protected shall they now deride\r\n   Thy baffled fury and thy vanquish’d pride[1126].’”\r\n\r\nStill it was just among those classes to whom the _argumentum ad nitorem_\r\ncame home most forcibly that the fashion had changed. Before the end of\r\nthe 18th century, the danger to beauty from an attack of smallpox had\r\nbecome a matter chiefly of historical interest, carrying the mind back to\r\nthe Restoration or the early Georgian era. The richer classes, while they\r\nseem to have countenanced cowpox inoculation as a good thing in general,\r\nwere probably apathetic on their own account. Lord Mulgrave said in the\r\nHouse of Lords on 8 July, 1814; “If their lordships recollected how many\r\npersons of the higher order were reluctant to introduce vaccination into\r\ntheir families, it really must appear to them a harsh and arbitrary\r\nmeasure to lay the poor under the necessity of adopting the practice.” The\r\nworking class had been manifesting a devotion to the old practice which,\r\nindeed, they had never shown so long as it was unchallenged. Perhaps one\r\nreason to account for the undoubted preference of the poorer classes for\r\nthe old inoculation was that they had only lately taken to it. Another was\r\nthat a good deal of inoculation was done by amateurs of their own\r\nclass--blacksmiths, farriers, tradesmen and women. A third reason was that\r\nthe poorer classes, among whom smallpox prevailed most, saw their children\r\ntake smallpox all the same, and cared little for the scientific\r\nexplanation that a false or spurious kind of cowpox matter had been used.\r\nIn October, 1805, a correspondent wrote from London to an Edinburgh\r\njournal: “The many late failures of supposed cowpock to prevent the\r\nsmallpox have excited in some parts so much clamour among the lower orders\r\nof people that they insist upon being inoculated for the smallpox at some\r\nof the public institutions[1127].” A report on vaccination made to\r\nParliament by the College of Physicians in 1807, deplores “the\r\ninconsiderate manner in which great numbers of persons ever since the\r\nintroduction of vaccination are still every year inoculated with the\r\nsmallpox.” When, in consequence of the same report, a vote was brought\r\nforward in Parliament to give Dr Jenner a national reward of twenty\r\nthousand pounds in addition to the ten thousand that he had got five\r\nyears before, the populace were so angry that one of their leaders, John\r\nGale Jones, himself a medical man, sent a message to Jenner at his\r\nlodgings in Bedford Place to advise him “immediately to quit London, for\r\nthere was no knowing what an enraged populace might do[1128].”\r\n\r\nFew particulars remain of the old inoculation at this time. One fact\r\nsignificant of the impression that the criticisms of cowpox had made is\r\nthat Dr John Walker, director of the Royal Jennerian Society, who pushed\r\n“vaccination” among the poorer classes more than anyone in London, was all\r\nthe while an inoculator in the old manner. He wrote to Lettsom, “I have\r\nfrom the first introduction of vaccination entertained an opinion\r\nrespecting its nature different from those who suppose it a _substitute_\r\nonly for smallpox.... I have, from an early part of my practice, been in\r\nthe habit of _diluting_ smallpox virus with water previous to its\r\nintroduction into the system;” and this he had been doing in the name of\r\nJenner, under the influence of a belief that, if cowpox were not smallpox,\r\nit ought to be, that it was a pity the disease had ever been called\r\ncowpox, and that the name (which was a very old one) “has only served to\r\ndebase it in the eyes of the common people, and prevent its general\r\nadoption[1129].” The very director of the Jennerian institute was among\r\nthe prophets of the old inoculation.\r\n\r\nWith the revival of smallpox in general epidemic diffusion in 1816-19 we\r\nbegin to hear more of the old inoculation. The account already cited of\r\nthe outbreak at Ulverston contains a table of fourteen previously cowpoxed\r\nchildren whom it was thought desirable during the epidemic to inoculate\r\nwith smallpox, all of them receiving the infection in one degree or\r\nanother. A practitioner at Dunse, Berwickshire, not only returned to the\r\nold inoculation (thereby incurring “much odium,” as he believed), but\r\nactually took his matter from the natural smallpox of his cowpox\r\nfailures[1130].\r\n\r\nWhen the epidemic reached the Eastern Counties, there were demands for the\r\nold kind of inoculation, not in Norwich only, but in numerous country\r\nparishes. Of ninety-one surgeons in Norfolk and Suffolk, who answered the\r\nqueries of Cross, thirty-eight had practised the inoculation of smallpox\r\nin the epidemic of 1819; five of them, after having refused many private\r\napplications for inoculation in the old way, had at length yielded to the\r\ndesire of the Overseers of the Poor, and had inoculated whole parishes.\r\nCross’s correspondents also testified that there was much inoculation\r\ngoing on at that time in the Eastern Counties by the hands of farriers,\r\nblacksmiths, tailors, shoemakers and women.\r\n\r\nDr John Forbes, who then practised at Chichester, brought to light an\r\nexactly similar state of public feeling in Sussex in 1821-22[1131]. In the\r\nparish of Bosham there lived a farmer named Pearce who had an inherited\r\nskill in inoculating, his father having inserted smallpox into ten\r\nthousand persons in his day, without killing one of them. Pearce offered\r\nto wager with Forbes a considerable sum that he would inoculate any number\r\nof persons and that none of them should have more than twenty pustules. He\r\nbelieved that the smallpox matter became “as weak as water” by an\r\nuninterrupted transmission from one body to another.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1821, the Overseers of the Poor employed him to inoculate the\r\npauper children, and his skill was soon in request for others, so that\r\nfrom two to three hundred in the parish were inoculated by him within a\r\nshort time. He charged half-a-crown or a crown for each. From other\r\nparishes the people flocked to him in such numbers that he inoculated\r\nupwards of a thousand in the winter and spring of 1821-22. Before long he\r\nhad three itinerant rivals, a knifegrinder, a tinsmith and a fishmonger,\r\nwho claimed to have inoculated together a thousand persons, including four\r\nhundred previously cowpoxed. The surgeons of Emsworthy and Havant at\r\nlength joined in the business, and in the space of six or eight weeks\r\ninoculated from twelve to thirteen hundred persons, who had not been\r\npreviously vaccinated. Forbes also received from his medical friends in\r\nand around Chichester “an account of 680 cases of previously vaccinated\r\nindividuals subjected by them to variolous inoculation.” In the great\r\nmajority of these the constitutional symptoms were so slight as to be\r\nonly just observable, the eruption consisting of only a few pustules,\r\nwhich were all that the Pearces, of Bosham, father and son, ever expected\r\nto get with inoculated smallpox where no infection of cowpox had preceded.\r\nDisappointments with the new inoculation had led to a great revival of the\r\nold also at Canterbury, the operators being mostly women.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happened in Cambridgeshire and in Bucks. In a parish within\r\neleven miles of Cambridge several hundred persons were inoculated with\r\nsmallpox in 1824, and in April, 1825, a medical practitioner inoculated a\r\nnumber in a village near[1132]. During a severe epidemic in the parish of\r\nGreat Missenden, Bucks, which followed a general vaccination, and caused a\r\nprejudice against the latter, the old inoculation was generally resorted\r\nto[1133]. It looked for a brief period, about the time of the epidemic of\r\n1824-26, as if the old inoculation were to return to favour even with the\r\nprofession itself. Dr John Forbes wrote of the two kinds of inoculation in\r\na studiously impartial manner. Dr Robert Ferguson, who was also destined\r\nto make a name, addressed in 1825 a letter to Sir Henry Halford in which\r\nhe advocated a singular compromise, namely, two inoculations, one with\r\ncowpox, the other with smallpox, the cowpox to neutralize the\r\ncontagiousness of the smallpox for the occasion, while the latter was to\r\nbe the prophylactic against itself for the future[1134]. This reaction, if\r\nit deserves that name, corresponds in time to the great decline in the\r\nnumber of gratuitous vaccinations at Manchester, a decline which had been\r\nequally remarkable at Glasgow for some years before. There was at least an\r\napathetic spirit towards cowpox inoculation during the epidemic of\r\n1817-19, and for a good many years after it, while there was something\r\nlike toleration, even among medical men, for the old inoculation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Smallpox Epidemic of 1825-26.\r\n\r\nCompared with the epidemic of 1837-40, which was the first in England to\r\nbe recorded under the new system of registration of the causes of death,\r\nthe smallpox of 1825-26 makes a poor figure in the records. Yet there is\r\nreason to believe that it was an epidemic of the same general kind, if not\r\nof the same duration or fatality. At the Newcastle Dispensary far more\r\nchildren in the smallpox were visited in 1825 than in any year since its\r\nopening in 1777, namely, 113 cases, with 28 deaths, which would have been\r\na small fraction of all the cases in Newcastle. At the Rusholme Road\r\nCemetery, Manchester, which received about a fourth part of the burials,\r\n112 children, all under seven years, were buried from smallpox in the six\r\nmonths, 18 June to 18 December, 1826[1135]. At Bury St Edmunds smallpox\r\nbegan to be epidemic about the end of 1824, when the guardians ordered a\r\ngeneral vaccination, and reached its worst in July, 1825, the type being\r\nconfluent in many of the cases[1136]. It was in Cambridgeshire villages\r\nthe same year, and is casually heard of in Bucks[1137]. It had been severe\r\nat Oxford and Canterbury in 1824. At Glasgow the prevalence of fever is\r\nknown for the corresponding years, but the smallpox deaths have not been\r\ntaken out of the burial registers. The evidence from London is perhaps the\r\nbest indication that the smallpox of 1825 was one of the more severe\r\nperiodic visitations.\r\n\r\nThe extensive prevalence of smallpox was heard of in Paris before the\r\nepidemic attracted much notice in London; the news of persons of\r\ndistinction dying by smallpox in the French capital reads like the old\r\nnotices of it in 17th century letters. In the same year it was very severe\r\nalso in Sweden after a long period of quiescence. As to London, Dr George\r\nGregory, physician to the Smallpox Hospital, said[1138]: “It may be\r\ninferred that smallpox has been nearly as general in 1825 as in any of\r\nthe three great epidemics of the preceding century”--the demand for\r\nadmission to the Hospital being, in his opinion, a fair index; while\r\nprivate information confirmed the estimate of its truly epidemic\r\nprevalence, and of its incidence chiefly upon the lower classes[1139]. In\r\nthe years of the 18th century to which he referred, and in four maximum\r\nyears of the 19th century, the cases and deaths at the Smallpox Hospital\r\nhad been as follows[1140]:\r\n\r\n_London Smallpox Hospital._\r\n\r\n  Year    Cases    Deaths\r\n\r\n  1777     497      125\r\n  1781     646      257\r\n  1796     447      148\r\n  1805     280       97\r\n  1819     193       61\r\n  1822     194       57\r\n  1825     419      120\r\n\r\nWhile the demands upon the beds of the hospital pointed, as Gregory\r\nsupposed, to the existence of a great epidemic in London, comparable to\r\nthose of 1777, 1781 or 1796, in which years the smallpox deaths were\r\nreturned by the parish clerks at 2567, 3500 and 3548 respectively, yet in\r\n1825 the bills showed only 1299 deaths from smallpox. Gregory accepted\r\nwithout demur the figures of the parish clerks’ bills in 1825, although it\r\nis well known that they had become more and more defective, even for the\r\noriginal parishes, since the end of the 18th century[1141]. “But for the\r\ngeneral prevalence of vaccination,” he said, the smallpox deaths in 1825\r\nwould have been 4000 in the same number of attacks, the difference being\r\nin the rate of fatality. His conclusion for all London was based upon the\r\nexperience of the Smallpox Hospital. The patients received by that charity\r\nwere of the same class as formerly, most of them being adults, among whom\r\nthe proportion of fatalities was greater than at all ages. Taking the\r\nthree epidemics of the 18th century with which he compared the epidemic of\r\n1825 in respect of extent or number of attacks, we find that 25 per cent.\r\nof the cases admitted died in 1777, 39 per cent. in 1781 (the seasons\r\nwere unwholesome by epidemic agues, dysenteries, and typhus), and 33 per\r\ncent. in 1796. The average of fatalities at the hospital from its opening\r\nin 1746 to the end of the century was about 29 per cent., and that was\r\nexactly the ratio of deaths among the 419 patients in 1825. The rate of\r\nfatality was a little higher than in the epidemic of 1777, and a little\r\nlower than in each of the epidemics of 1781 and 1796. Gregory in 1825 was\r\nenabled to separate the sheep from the goats by the dividing line of\r\ncowpox, the former dying at the rate of 8 per cent., the latter at the\r\nrate of 41 per cent. There are various ways of apportioning a general\r\naverage. The presence or absence of cowpox scars is one principle, which\r\ncould not have been used to break up the 25 per cent of 1777, or the 39\r\nper cent, of 1781, or the 33 per cent. of 1796, into two component parts.\r\nOne thing common to all times is the different rate of fatality at\r\ndifferent ages. All the deaths in the 8 per cent. division of 1825 were\r\nbetween the ages of eighteen and twenty-seven; the ages of the 41 per\r\ncent. division are written in the books of the hospital. In portioning out\r\nthe general rate of fatality from typhus fever at the London Fever\r\nHospital, it is found that the dividing line of age is nearly the same as\r\nthe dividing line of social position; in one table the high ratio of\r\ndeaths to attacks is among persons in the second half of life, and the low\r\nratio among persons in the flower of their age; in another table the many\r\ndeaths to cases are among paupers, and the few fatalities among paying\r\npatients[1142]. However manifold the cutting up of a general average, some\r\ndivisions would be identical, corresponding to natural lines of cleavage.\r\n\r\nHaving indicated the chief points in the vaccination controversy by the\r\ninstance of Gregory’s arguments sixty years since, (to which might have\r\nbeen added the question of efficient or inefficient vaccination according\r\nto the appearance of the scars in after life[1143]), I shall for the rest\r\ndepart from the usual practice of interlocking the history of smallpox\r\nepidemics with the history of vaccination. I shall treat the latter as _ex\r\nhypothesi_ irrelevant, leaving it to each reader to incorporate, as\r\nmatter of his own familiar knowledge or belief, whatever effects of cowpox\r\nupon smallpox, whether temporary effects or permanent, modifying effects\r\nor absolutely prophylactic, may suit his particular creed. I am led to\r\ntake this course for several reasons. It leaves me free to look at the\r\nepidemics of smallpox from the same point of view as the other epidemics\r\ntreated of in this work. It avoids a controversy which, unlike that of\r\ninoculation, is still actual, and unsuited to a historical treatise. It\r\nenables me to omit the excuses for failure, which are apt to be\r\ninterminable and to usurp the whole space available for the epidemiology\r\nproper. Lastly, the irrelevancy which I here conveniently assume happens\r\nto be my real belief,--as elsewhere set forth in an examination of the\r\nantecedent probability arising out of the pathological nature and\r\naffinities of cowpox, and in a study of the grounds on which the authority\r\nof the profession was originally given to Dr Jenner’s teaching.\r\n\r\nThe interval between the epidemic of 1825 and that of 1837-39 was occupied\r\nby a good deal of smallpox steadily from year to year in London, the\r\ndeaths from which, in the following table from the bills of mortality, are\r\nto be understood as only a part of the whole, according to the explanation\r\nalready given:\r\n\r\n        Smallpox\r\n  Year   deaths\r\n\r\n  1826    503\r\n  1827    616\r\n  1828    598\r\n  1829    736\r\n  1830    627\r\n  1831    563\r\n  1832    771\r\n  1833    574\r\n  1834    334\r\n  1835    863\r\n  1836    536\r\n  1837    217\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of these returns will appear from the fact that the 217\r\ndeaths in 1837 rose, under the new system of registration, from 1 July to\r\n31 December, to 762, or to fully three times as many for the last six\r\nmonths as the parish clerks returned for the whole year. Their bills had\r\nbecome most defective when they were about to be, or had been superseded;\r\nbut even on the special occasion of the cholera in 1832 they returned only\r\nsome three-fifths of the known deaths. Besides these London figures there\r\nis little to show the extent of smallpox in England between the epidemic\r\nof 1825 and that of 1837-39. This was the time when many complaints were\r\nmade of the so-called loss of power or strength in the current cowpox\r\nmatter for inoculation. These complaints appear to have arisen from the\r\ngreater frequency of smallpox among the cowpoxed, corresponding to the\r\nincreasing numbers of the whole population who had received that kind of\r\ninoculation. “Secondary smallpox,” says a report from Worcestershire in\r\n1833, “has been very prevalent of late years[1144],” the term “secondary”\r\nreflecting the teaching of Baron, chairman of the Smallpox Committee of\r\nthe Medical Association, that cowpox itself was the primary smallpox. The\r\nincreasing number of the vaccinated who took smallpox was clearly shown in\r\nthe returns from the Smallpox Hospital of London, and was believed to be\r\nin proportion to the increasing number of the rising generation who had\r\nbeen vaccinated[1145].\r\n\r\n\r\nA generation of Smallpox in Glasgow.\r\n\r\nGlasgow had afforded the most striking instance in Britain of the decline\r\nof smallpox after the beginning of the 19th century. The decline was\r\nobserved everywhere, but it was most noticeable in Glasgow, partly because\r\nthe smallpox mortality of infants at the end of the 18th century had been\r\nexcessive there, partly because Dr Watt took the trouble to prove it\r\nstatistically from the burial registers. In the last six years of the 18th\r\ncentury, 1795-1800, smallpox had contributed 18·7 per cent. of the deaths\r\nfrom all causes; from 1801 to 1806, it contributed 8·9 per cent., and from\r\n1807 to 1812 only 3·9 per cent. In the next six years, 1813-19, if\r\nCleland’s search of the registers has been as laborious as Watt’s, the\r\nshare of smallpox was only 1·07 per cent. of the deaths from all causes,\r\nwhich would mean that Glasgow was hardly at all touched by the epidemic of\r\n1817-19, reported from many other parts of Scotland[1146]. But the lull\r\nin smallpox, which corresponded on the whole to the still greater lull in\r\nfevers during the prosperous times of the second half of the French war,\r\nwas broken in Glasgow, if not in 1817, yet before long. Unfortunately\r\nthere is a break in the statistics also. From 1821 the magistrates caused\r\nannual bills of mortality to be published, which did not, however, specify\r\nthe causes of death until 1835[1147]. But we have some intermediate\r\nglimpses of the state of the poorer classes and of the prevalence of\r\nsmallpox in particular. Writing in 1827, Dr Mac Farlane one of the poor’s\r\nsurgeons, remarks upon the feeble stamina, sallow complexions, and the\r\nlike, of all but a few children in the more crowded parts, adding that\r\nsmallpox both in the virulent and “modified” forms had been more prevalent\r\nduring the last three or four years than formerly[1148]. Three years\r\nafter, Drs Andrew Buchanan and Weir gave an account of the state of the\r\npoor in Glasgow, which shows that it had actually deteriorated with the\r\ngrowth of the city. The poorer classes had been in some part displaced\r\nfrom their old dwellings in the heart of the town owing to the building of\r\nwarehouses or the like, and had been provided with no new habitations as\r\ngood as the old. “Apartments originally intended for cellars, and occupied\r\nas such until lately, are now inhabited by large families, and the only\r\nopening for light and air is the door, which when shut encloses the poor\r\ncreatures in a tainted atmosphere and in total darkness. This is well\r\nexemplified in the cellars belonging to the houses on the south side of St\r\nAndrew’s Street.” Not only the notorious region of the Wynds, containing\r\npart of the three parishes of the Tron, St Enoch’s and St James’s, but\r\nalso the Saltmarket and Gallowgate, were crowded with a destitute, vagrant\r\nand often vicious class of people. Many of the houses in the Wynds, with\r\ntheir network of alleys, were only one or two storeys high, in the old\r\nScotch fashion; here were the night lodging-houses, with several beds in\r\none room, two or three persons in a bed, twelve to eighteen people in as\r\nmany square feet: “the extreme misery of these poor people is utterly\r\ninconceivable but to those who have actually witnessed it; it has\r\ncertainly been carried to the very utmost point at which the existence of\r\nhuman beings is capable of being maintained. Some of them are lodged in\r\nplaces where no man of ordinary humanity would put a cow or a horse, and\r\nwhere those animals would not long remain with impunity.” Buchanan found\r\nsometimes a horse, sometimes an ass, sometimes pigs, in the same dungeon\r\nwith one or more families[1149]. Such was the region in which Chalmers\r\nministered from 1815 to 1822, first in the Tron parish, afterwards in the\r\npoor and crowded parish of St John’s. Things got no better, certainly,\r\nafter he left worn out by his exertions, to become professor at St\r\nAndrews. Buchanan thought the best index of the degradation of the people\r\nin 1830 to be that not one in ten ever entered a church (if they had, he\r\nexplains, the respectable congregation would have fled from their filth\r\nand rags). “The people are starving,” he exclaims, “and there is a law\r\nagainst the importation of food[1150].” It took sixteen years longer to\r\nsecure the benefits of free trade, and meanwhile the public health of\r\nGlasgow got worse rather than better. The infantile part of it attracted\r\nfar less notice than that which touched adults, so that we hear little of\r\nsmallpox, while the records of fever and cholera are fairly complete. When\r\nthe curtain is lifted in 1835 by the publication of statistics, the\r\nmortality of infants and children by infectious diseases is found to be\r\nproceeding as follows:\r\n\r\n_Glasgow Mortalities, 1835-39._\r\n\r\n        Deaths    Deaths   Deaths    Deaths\r\n       from all    from     from      from\r\n  Year  causes   smallpox  measles  scarlatina\r\n\r\n  1835   7198       473      426       273\r\n  1836   8441       577      518       355\r\n  1837  10270       351      350        79\r\n  1838   6932       388      405        87\r\n  1839   7525       406      783       262\r\n\r\nAccording to the following table of the ages at death from smallpox, it\r\nwill appear that a higher ratio of infants died of it in their first year\r\nat Glasgow than was the rule elsewhere, whether in the 18th or in the 19th\r\ncentury. It was only in the year 1837, when typhus was at its worst and\r\nsmallpox had somewhat declined, that the deaths by the latter of infants\r\nunder one year were fewer than those of infants in their second year:\r\n\r\n_Glasgow: Table of Deaths from Smallpox 1835 to 1839._\r\n\r\n             Under                                     Above\r\n               1    1-2  2-5  5-10 10-20  20-30  30-40  40    Total\r\n\r\n  1835        204   154   75   17    14     8      1     0      473\r\n  1836        202   174  144   23     6    24      2     2      577\r\n  1837         93   116   94   24    10    11      4     0      352\r\n  1838        111    99  119   28    11    14      4     2      388\r\n  1839        137    98  113   19    15    17      5     2      406\r\n\r\n  Totals of\r\n  five years  747   641  545  111    56    74      16    6     2196\r\n                                     \\---------v---------/\r\n  Percentages 34%   29%  25%   5%              7%\r\n\r\nCowan, who published these figures in 1840, had written eight years\r\nbefore, “I fear that if the list of infantile diseases were still\r\npublished in the mortality bills many deaths from smallpox would annually\r\nbe found.” We do, indeed, hear of epidemics of smallpox not far from\r\nGlasgow. At Stranraer, in Sept.-Nov. 1829, “measles and smallpox attacked\r\nwith scarcely an exception” all the children in the place who had not\r\nacquired immunity either by previous attacks or by the influence of\r\nvaccination; “and even these powerful protectives were, in many instances,\r\nof no avail.” The subjects of “unmodified” smallpox were nearly all\r\ninfants of the poorer class. In St John’s Street, occupied by decent Scots\r\nlabouring people, ten children had “unmodified” smallpox and all\r\nrecovered; in Little Dublin Street, so called from its Irish tenants,\r\nfourteen children had smallpox, of whom six died[1151]. At Ayr, about the\r\nsame time, there was an epidemic, which came to a height in 1830, causing\r\na considerable mortality[1152]. At Edinburgh in the winter of 1830-31, it\r\nwas unusually prevalent and fatal, the epidemic dying out in May,\r\n1831[1153].\r\n\r\nFor three or four years, 1843-46, there was another lull in the prevalence\r\nof smallpox in Glasgow; but the mortality rose again, reaching in the two\r\nyears 1851 and 1852 the total of 1202, in a population of 360,138, which\r\ncontrasted with the 2212 deaths in London in the same two years, and with\r\nthe Paris mortality of 706 in the two years 1850 and 1851, in a population\r\nof about one million, the deaths being still almost wholly infantile in\r\nGlasgow while they were in great part of adults in Paris[1154].\r\n\r\n_Glasgow Smallpox._\r\n\r\n                       Smallpox\r\n  Year                  deaths\r\n\r\n  1840                    455\r\n  1841 (pop. 282,134)     347\r\n  1842                    334\r\n  1843                    151\r\n  1844                     99\r\n  1845                    195\r\n  1846               not recorded\r\n  1847                    592\r\n  1848                    300\r\n  1849                    366\r\n  1850                    456\r\n  1851 (pop. 360,138)     618\r\n  1852                    584\r\n\r\nRegistration of the causes of death began in Scotland in 1855. In the\r\nfirst decennial period, to 1864, the smallpox deaths were 10,548, falling\r\nupon infancy and other age-periods as in the following table[1155]:\r\n\r\n  Age-periods             Smallpox deaths\r\n\r\n  Under three months             774\r\n  Three to six months            668\r\n  Six to twelve months          1543\r\n  One to two years              1765\r\n  Two to three years            1132\r\n  Three to four years            798\r\n  Four to five years             514\r\n  ----------------------------------\r\n  Total under five years        7194\r\n  Above five years              3354\r\n                              ------\r\n                              10,548\r\n\r\n\r\nSmallpox in Ireland, 1830-40.\r\n\r\nBefore coming to the epidemic in England let us glance at the prevalence\r\nof smallpox at this period in Ireland. Dr Cowan, of Glasgow, was struck by\r\nthe fact that among ninety patients in the Infirmary with smallpox, all\r\nadults, only four were from the considerable Irish population of the\r\ncity, the larger number being natives of the Highlands of Scotland. This\r\nleads him to say: “The immunity of the Irish from smallpox is owing to the\r\ngeneral practice of vaccination among the lower classes by the surgeons of\r\nthe county and other dispensaries” (another Glasgow writer ascribes the\r\nprevalence of smallpox to the Irish negligence in the same matter). It\r\nhappens that we can bring one part of this statement to a statistical\r\ntest. The same volume of the _Journal of the Statistical Society_ which\r\ncontained the paper on the vital statistics of Glasgow contained also a\r\nstatistical account of the public health of Limerick, by Dr Daniel\r\nGriffin, physician to the Dispensary[1156]. Dr Griffin’s figures were of\r\nthe only kind that could then be got for an Irish town, and were\r\nrepresentative rather than exhaustive. Struck by the seemingly enormous\r\ndeath-rate of infants in the poorest quarters of Limerick, he sought to\r\nbring out the facts with numerical precision. He provided a register-book\r\nat the Dispensary, in which he entered the results of his observations and\r\nretrospective inquiries among eight hundred families of the poorest class\r\nduring “a good many years” down to 1840. The city of Limerick, and\r\nespecially the parish of St Mary, was full of the misery and destitution\r\nthat characterized Ireland in the years of its greatest over-population.\r\nThe ejected cottiers and broken small farmers of the neighbouring county\r\nflocked to it, living in beggary in wretched lodging-houses with swarms of\r\ninfants and children, the breadwinners finding only an occasional day’s\r\nwork as labourers. Among 800 such families during the years of his\r\ninquiries the chief causes of death among the infants and children were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n_Limerick Dispensary Deaths._\r\n\r\n                         Under Five  Five to  Above\r\n                           years       Ten     Ten   Total\r\n\r\n  Convulsions                569        18       7     594\r\n  Smallpox                   333        55       5     393\r\n  Measles                    187        32       7     226\r\n  Diarrhoea and Dysentery    108        19      24     151\r\n  Whooping cough              84        10       1      95\r\n  Croup                       85         9       1      95\r\n  Scarlatina                   8         2       0      10\r\n  Fever                       70        33      66     169\r\n\r\nThe more exact ages at death from smallpox in male and female children\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n            Under  One and  Three and  Five to  Above\r\n             One     Two      Four       Nine    Nine\r\n\r\n  Males       33      72       37         29       2\r\n  Females     52      92       47         26       3\r\n              --     ---       --         --      --\r\n              85     164       84         55       5\r\n\r\nAs compared with Glasgow, measles at Limerick has a much lower place than\r\nsmallpox in the infantile mortality, while scarlatina hardly counts at\r\nall. Again, only 1·27 per cent. of the smallpox deaths are above the age\r\nof nine, whereas at Glasgow 7 per cent. are above the age of ten.\r\nGriffin’s data for reckoning the probability of life were incomplete, as\r\nhe was well aware; so that the following comparison of the poor attending\r\nLimerick Dispensary with all England and Wales probably errs in making the\r\nIrish town somewhat more fatal to infants of the poor than it really was:\r\n\r\n                       England and Wales  Limerick Dispensary\r\n                        in 1000 deaths     in 1000 deaths\r\n\r\n  Under one year            214·54             327·71\r\n  One and under three       128·00             287·67\r\n  Three and under five       48·51             128·20\r\n  Five and under ten         46·07              97·29\r\n  Ten and under fifteen      25·91              24·93\r\n  Fifteen and under twenty   34·16              20·37\r\n\r\nIn a thousand deaths at all ages, 391·05 occurred before the age of five\r\nyears in England and Wales, but 743·58 before the age of five years among\r\na certain section of the poor of Limerick; and in the latter enormous\r\nsacrifice of infant life smallpox was the greatest single means next to\r\nconvulsions. Perhaps that was the reason why so few of the Irish in\r\nGlasgow were attacked by smallpox in adult age. The experience of Limerick\r\nwas not exceptional in Ireland. In the ten years 1831-40, for which the\r\ncauses of death were ascertained by means of queries in the census returns\r\nof 1841, the total of deaths by smallpox was 58,006, nearly double the\r\nmortality by measles (30,735) and seven times that of scarlatina (7,886).\r\nIt was almost wholly a malady of infants and children, the first and\r\nsecond years of life being its most fatal period. Only 129 of these deaths\r\nwere returned from hospitals. The bulk of the decennial smallpox deaths\r\nfell in the two years 1837 and 1838, corresponding with the high epidemic\r\nmortality in England[1157].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Epidemic of 1837-40 in England.\r\n\r\nThe smallpox epidemic of 1837-40 was already in full force at Liverpool,\r\nBath and Exeter when the mortality returns began to be made on 1st July,\r\n1837, under the new Registration Act. Whether or not the contagion\r\ntravelled from Ireland or the west of Scotland, the epidemic in England\r\nbegan in the west and south-west, and reached the Eastern counties last.\r\nThe following table shows its rise and progress at selected places in the\r\nseveral quarters, beginning with the third quarter (July-September) of\r\n1837[1158]:\r\n\r\n                   1837              1838                    1839\r\n               +---------+ +---------------------+ +---------------------+\r\n                3rd   4th   1st   2nd   3rd   4th   1st   2nd   3rd   4th\r\n                 qr    qr    qr    qr    qr    qr    qr    qr    qr    qr\r\n\r\n  Liverpool     375   132    32    24    18    36    11    29    75   138\r\n  Bath          154    18    15     1     1     2     1    25    17    30\r\n  Exeter         88   131     6    --     2    --    --    --    --    --\r\n  Bristol        21    74    72    44     4     7     6    --    --    --\r\n  Clifton        16    32    49    27     7    --    --    --     1     7\r\n  London        257   506   753  1145  1061   858   364   117    65    60\r\n  Manchester     23    98   127   120   111   180    94    40    33    53\r\n  Birmingham     34    55    85    86    66    47    26    12     7    10\r\n  Sheffield      14    14    27    36    22    12     9     3     4    --\r\n  Leeds           4    11    29    69   134   197    74    55    30    15\r\n  Newcastle      16    17    66    11    --    23    54    24    39    25\r\n  Abergavenny\r\n    and          13    85   102    50    22    21    22    30    26    10\r\n    Pontypool\r\n  Merthyr\r\n    Tydvil        9    54   160    91    10     3    18    16    12    --\r\n  Weymouth,\r\n    Bridport,\r\n    and           4    19    92    31     8     4    10     9     2    --\r\n    Beaminster\r\n  Plymouth       10    15    11    14    37    48     9     8     1    --\r\n  Taunton        --     7    66    40     4     3    --    --    --    --\r\n  Leicester      43     5     3     2     3     3     9    21     5    15\r\n  Norwich         1    --    --    --    --    17   180   204    10     7\r\n  Lynn etc.      --     1     2    10     7     4   127    81     6    --\r\n  Ipswich        --    --     2     6    38    95    23    --     1    --\r\n  Bury St\r\n    Edmunds       1     3    30    24     2     3    --    --    --    --\r\n    etc.\r\n  Woodbridge\r\n    etc.          4     9    27    16     5    11    10     2    --     4\r\n\r\nThe epidemic having begun in the west and south-west in the summer of\r\n1837, spread in the winter of 1837-38, all through the hills and valleys\r\nof Wales, causing high mortalities around Abergavenny, Pontypool, Merthyr\r\nTydvil and other towns in the first quarter of 1838, as well as in the\r\nrural parishes. It was not until the end of 1838 that the contagion spread\r\nwidely over the Eastern counties. The epidemic in Norwich was again short\r\nand sharp, like that of 1819, most of the 418 deaths falling within six\r\nmonths of winter and spring, just as most of the 530 deaths in 1819 fell\r\nwithin six months of summer and autumn. The population in 1821 was 50,288,\r\nand in 1841, 62,344; the increase was only 1228 between 1831 and 1841, so\r\nthat the smallpox of 1839 fell upon a stationary population, whereas that\r\nof 1819 had fallen upon a rapidly increasing one. In the autumn of 1839\r\nand throughout 1840, a second outburst of smallpox took place in the towns\r\nwhere the epidemic had started two years before, namely, Liverpool, Bath,\r\nBristol, Clifton, etc[1159].\r\n\r\nBut the smallpox of 1840, which produced more deaths than that of 1839,\r\nwas mostly centred in the Lancashire manufacturing towns, where also the\r\nmortality from scarlet fever was enormous. The circumstances of the\r\nworking class in Lancashire at this time have been described in the\r\nchapter on fevers. The following shows the large proportion of smallpox\r\ndeaths that fell in 1840 to the North-Western or Lancashire registration\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n_Smallpox Deaths, 1840._\r\n\r\n                          1st qr    2nd qr    3rd qr    4th qr\r\n\r\n  England and Wales         2071      2476      2274      3613\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Of which in the N.-W.\r\n    Division (Lancashire)   1046       986       533       590\r\n\r\nThe epidemic continued in the manufacturing towns into 1841; in the more\r\nrural registration divisions of England it had almost ceased in 1839. From\r\nthe 1st July, 1837 (beginning of registration) until the 31st December,\r\n1840, the epidemic smallpox in England and Wales caused 41,644 deaths. In\r\n1838 it eclipsed both measles and scarlatina as a cause of death among\r\nchildren; but in 1840 scarlatina gained the leading place and kept it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegislation for Smallpox after the Epidemic of 1837-40.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of smallpox in 1837-40, which was fatal chiefly to infants\r\nand young children, was one of the greatest, like the corresponding\r\nepidemic of typhus among adults, in the whole history of England. The\r\ntroubles of the working class had been more or less chronic ever since the\r\nbooming times of the Peninsular War had come to an end; the climax was\r\nreached in the thirties; the enormous sums spent upon railway construction\r\ngave a relief in the forties; and the permanent cheapening of food by Free\r\nTrade made an entirely new era, which became visible in the public health\r\nafter the contagion of the Irish famine had ceased in 1848. The great and\r\nhitherto permanent decrease of typhus was brought about by social and\r\neconomic causes. There, at least, _laissez faire_ was all powerful: “Let\r\nus be saved,” said Burke, “from too much wisdom of our own, and we shall\r\ndo tolerably well.” But there has been at no time since the 18th century\r\nthe same passiveness towards smallpox; that is a disease against which we\r\nmust always be doing something direct and pointed. The legislation against\r\nsmallpox began in England (nothing was done for Ireland and Scotland until\r\nlong after) with the Act of 1840.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular instance of the changes in medical opinion and of the\r\nvicissitudes of things that the first statute against smallpox should have\r\nbeen instigated by a desire to suppress the old inoculation. Parliament\r\nwas first moved to action by the Medical Society of London through a\r\npetition presented by Lord Lansdowne; but things had been moving that way\r\nfor some time before in the councils of the British (then the Provincial)\r\nMedical Association, under the influence of Dr Baron, the executor and\r\nbiographer of Dr Edward Jenner. The Bill of 1840 was brought into the\r\nHouse of Lords by the second Lord Ellenborough, and conducted through the\r\nCommons by Sir James Graham, who was not then in office. It purposed to\r\nenable the poorer classes to get their children vaccinated, if they so\r\ndesired, at the cost of the ratepayers, and to prohibit under penalties\r\nthe practice of the old inoculation by amateurs or empirics. Blomfield,\r\nbishop of London, said in the Lords’ debate that many of the ignorant\r\npoor, in agricultural districts, were strongly prejudiced against\r\ninoculation with cowpox, and that they paid much greater attention to\r\nempirics, meaning inoculators by the old method, than to the advice of the\r\nclergy. In the Commons, Mr Wakley, who was a Radical and the proprietor of\r\none of the weekly medical journals, declared that “no one could be\r\nignorant that the working classes entertained great prejudices against\r\nvaccination,” although he did not explain why they were prejudiced.\r\nAccording to this medical authority, whom the House took seriously on that\r\nsubject if on no other, the epidemic of smallpox which the country had\r\njust passed through had been in effect due to the contagiousness of the\r\nsmallpox matter used in inoculating; and he succeeded in carrying an\r\namendment to put down the old practice, not only in the hands of amateurs\r\nbut also in those of medical men. The eighth clause of the Act decreed\r\nthat any person convicted before two justices in Quarter Sessions of\r\nhaving wilfully procured the smallpox by inoculation shall be liable to a\r\npenalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding one calendar month. The\r\npenal clause against the original inoculation was an indirect compliment\r\nto its vitality. Lord Lansdowne also paid it a compliment by recognizing\r\nthe correctness of its principle; the rival inoculation-matter of cowpox,\r\nhe said, was “perfectly identical” with smallpox, “although the symptoms\r\nwere different.” This will be a convenient point in the history at which\r\nto review the rise and progress of the idea that the inoculation of\r\nsmallpox was a wilful spreading of contagion and therefore a public\r\nnuisance.\r\n\r\n    The risk of spreading the contagion of smallpox by inoculating the\r\n    disease was one of the objections to the practice raised by Wagstaffe\r\n    in his letter to Dr Freind in 1722: “I have considered,” he says, “how\r\n    destructive it may prove to spread a distemper that is contagious.”\r\n    Still more explicit was Dr Douglass of Boston, New England, writing on\r\n    1 May, 1722: “I oppose this novel and dubious practice ... in that I\r\n    reckon it a sin against society to propagate infection by this means,\r\n    and bring on my neighbour a distemper which might prove fatal, and\r\n    which, perhaps, he might escape (as many have done) in the ordinary\r\n    way.... However, many of our clergy have got into it, and they scorn\r\n    to retract[1160].” Within a few months there was a striking instance\r\n    of the alleged danger in one of Maitland’s inoculations at Hertford,\r\n    an inoculated child, with only twenty pustules, having been supposed\r\n    the probable source of the natural smallpox in five domestics, of whom\r\n    one died. The death of the Duchess of Bedford by the natural smallpox\r\n    in 1724 happened “after two of her children were recovered of that\r\n    distemper, which they both had by inoculation[1161].” That risk,\r\n    however, was little made of in the controversy, although it may have\r\n    been one of the tacit reasons that led to the total abandonment of\r\n    inoculation during the ten or twelve years after 1728. On the revival\r\n    of the practice after 1740, when the serjeant-surgeons, the physicians\r\n    and the apothecaries were all making it a considerable part of their\r\n    business among the richer classes, the danger from contagion was\r\n    either non-existent or it was not realized. In 1754 the College of\r\n    Physicians of London, by a formal minute, recommended inoculation as\r\n    “highly salutary to the human race,” without one word of warning on\r\n    the risk of contagiousness. That objection was raised again when\r\n    Sutton’s practice in 1765-67 was drawing large crowds to be\r\n    inoculated. He was put on his trial at the Chelmsford Summer Assizes\r\n    in 1766 on a charge of spreading the contagion of smallpox, which was\r\n    epidemic in the town; but the grand jury, charged by Lord Mansfield,\r\n    threw out the bill. Sutton’s defence was to have been that he never\r\n    brought into Chelmsford a patient capable of spreading the smallpox,\r\n    that is to say, an inoculated person with smallpox enough on him to\r\n    spread contagion[1162]. Shortly after came the controversy between\r\n    Lettsom and Dimsdale as to inoculation of infants at their homes,\r\n    which turned upon the risk of increasing the natural smallpox by a\r\n    constant succession of artificial cases. Lettsom’s position was the\r\n    same as Sutton’s, that the quantity of smallpox matter (he might have\r\n    said the quality also) produced by inoculation was not sufficient to\r\n    create an appreciable risk. As to the matter of fact, the quantity was\r\n    indeed small: Sir William Watson declared that a single limb of an\r\n    adult person in a moderate attack of the natural smallpox had as many\r\n    pustules on it as all the seventy-four children, in one of his\r\n    inoculations at the Foundling Hospital, had on their whole bodies. In\r\n    the theory of contagion, an infinitesimal quantity is sufficient; but\r\n    in reality it appears that contagion must be in excess to be\r\n    effective, just as, in the nearest physiological analogy,\r\n    fertilization seems to depend upon the copiousness of the pollen or\r\n    seminal particles[1163].\r\n\r\n    The opposition to Lettsom’s project of general inoculations among the\r\n    infants of the working classes in cities shows that the risk of\r\n    contagion was made to serve at least an argumentative purpose. As to\r\n    experience, Lettsom in 1778 declared that he knew no instance of\r\n    contagion from that source during two years of inoculations among the\r\n    poor of London[1164]. One writer of the time (1781) appealed boldly to\r\n    the experience of sixty years: “Upon the first introduction of\r\n    inoculation, physicians, divines, and innumerable other writers [who\r\n    were they?] cried out that the infection would be spread, and the\r\n    community suffer a greater loss; but after sixty years’ experience, we\r\n    should expect those arguments, as well as the writers, had all died\r\n    away, and that at this day the same stale dregs of ignorance and\r\n    obstinacy would not be again retailed[1165].” The risk, however, was\r\n    not altogether imaginary. Some cases of smallpox caught from the\r\n    inoculated were known. In Vienna at that time the rule was to allow\r\n    no inoculations except on groups of subjects isolated for the purpose.\r\n    When Jenner, in 1798, enumerated the advantages of cowpox over\r\n    smallpox for inoculation, in certain specified circumstances, one of\r\n    his points was its non-contagiousness[1166].\r\n\r\n    The favourable reception of his project seems to have been determined\r\n    more upon that point than upon any other. The theoretical risk of\r\n    contagion from inoculated smallpox became at once an actual danger to\r\n    the community when it was perceived that they had in “smallpox of the\r\n    cow” a non-contagious variety. Jenner was not slow to use that growing\r\n    sentiment so as to discredit the old practice. As early as 1802 he\r\n    began to urge privately the statutory prohibition of smallpox for\r\n    inoculation, and Wilberforce, among others, took the matter up\r\n    publicly. The College of Physicians, having been asked by Parliament\r\n    in 1807 to inquire into the causes that hindered the progress of\r\n    Jenner’s inoculation, inserted the following paragraph in their\r\n    report:\r\n\r\n    “Till vaccination becomes general, it will be impossible to prevent\r\n    the constant recurrence of the natural smallpox by means of those who\r\n    are inoculated, except it should appear proper to the Legislature to\r\n    adopt, in its wisdom, some measure by which those who still, from\r\n    terror or prejudice, prefer the smallpox to the vaccine disease, may\r\n    in thus consulting the gratification of their own feelings, be\r\n    prevented from doing mischief to their neighbours[1167].” The same\r\n    year, in the court of King’s Bench, a medical practitioner was\r\n    sentenced to fine and imprisonment for having neglected to prevent an\r\n    inoculated person from communicating with others[1168].\r\n\r\n    Next year, 1808, a bill was brought into the House of Commons by Mr\r\n    Fuller, with the following preamble: “Whereas the inoculation of\r\n    persons for the disorder called the Smallpox, according to the old or\r\n    Suttonian method, cannot be practised without the utmost danger of\r\n    communicating and diffusing the infection, and thereby endangering, in\r\n    a great degree, the lives of his Majesty’s subjects.”... This bill,\r\n    which had clauses also for notification and compulsory isolation of\r\n    smallpox cases, the churchwardens to be the authority, was not\r\n    persevered with. The inoculators by the old method opposed it, and\r\n    they were joined by Joseph Adams, who had been the first English\r\n    writer to mention cowpox, in 1795, and had been a staunch vaccinist\r\n    subsequently[1169]. In 1813 another attempt was made to restrict the\r\n    practice of inoculating the smallpox on the ground of danger from its\r\n    contagion, and to get cowpox substituted for it among the poorer\r\n    classes. The Vaccine Board were the promoters, Lord Boringdon\r\n    (afterwards Earl of Morley) having charge of the bill in the House of\r\n    Lords. It was successfully opposed by the Lord Chancellor (Eldon) and\r\n    by the Lord Chief Justice (Ellenborough), the latter contending that\r\n    the common law was a better remedy than a statute against the nuisance\r\n    of contagion from inoculated smallpox. Next year, 1814, Lord Boringdon\r\n    brought in a new bill, which did not directly harass the inoculation\r\n    interest, but made the rival method of cowpox obligatory upon the\r\n    poor. Its provisions were ridiculed by Lord Stanhope, who got help\r\n    from Lords Mulgrave and Redesdale to throw it out. Therewith ceased\r\n    for many years the talk about the contagiousness of inoculated\r\n    smallpox, together with the attempts in Parliament to enforce the\r\n    rival inoculation. The next attempt, in 1840, was successful in making\r\n    variolation a felony, and in throwing on the rates the cost of\r\n    vaccinating the infants of the poorer classes. The danger of contagion\r\n    from inoculated smallpox in 1840 was no greater than it had ever been,\r\n    and it had never been appreciable among the things favouring an\r\n    epidemic.\r\n\r\nThe common-law maxim, “sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas,” which gained\r\nstatutory force as against inoculation by the Act of 1840, was farther\r\nextended and specifically applied in the Act of 1853, which enforced the\r\ninoculation of cowpox upon all infants before they were three months old.\r\nLegislation, as we know, broadens down from precedent to precedent.\r\nParliament in 1853 did not debate the preamble of the Bill, but accepted\r\nthe principle established by the Act of 1840,--in the constructive sense\r\nthat to leave infants without the inoculation of cowpox was, in effect,\r\n“to expose them so as to be infectious,” because they were sure to take\r\nsmallpox, and so to become nuisances to others “unprotected” as well as\r\n(less obviously) to their cowpoxed neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther effects of the epidemic of 1837-40 on medical opinion.\r\n\r\nA second inoculation, except as a mere test of the first and within a few\r\nweeks thereof, was no part of the original 18th century teaching and\r\npractice. The theory of inoculation being based upon the familiar\r\nexperience that we seldom have the same infectious disease twice in a\r\nlifetime, it was held that inoculation, if it were effective, was the\r\ngiving of smallpox once for all, and that it could not really be given a\r\nsecond time unless the first inoculation had been ineffective. As soon as\r\ncowpox was recommended, it was remarked as a strange thing that this\r\ndisease, according to current accounts of it, was actually acquired by\r\nmilkers time after time. That fact in its natural history, said the\r\n_Medical and Physical Journal_ of January, 1799, was “received with\r\ngeneral scepticism merely on account of its improbability.” Dr Pearson was\r\nso troubled by the apparent inconsistency that he wrote to Dr Jenner in\r\n1798 to ask whether it were really so; and although the latter confirmed\r\nthe matter of fact, Pearson went on denying it, and did actually deny it\r\nas late as the Report of the Vaccine Pock Institution for 1803. Again, the\r\nreport of the Whitehaven Dispensary for 1801, while it admitted the matter\r\nof fact, adverted to the anomaly in these words: “As we know from\r\nexperience that the cowpock can be repeatedly introduced by inoculation,\r\nit appears remarkable that it can act as a preventive of a similar equally\r\nspecific but more malignant disease.” Those were theoretical difficulties,\r\nwhich the practical minds of the profession did not stand upon. When we\r\nnext hear of the possibility of having cowpox more than once, it is no\r\nlonger an intellectual stumbling-block but is turned to account in the way\r\nof re-vaccination. _Lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes, hic factus\r\nest in caput anguli._\r\n\r\nThe practice of re-vaccination was usual on the Continent long before the\r\nEnglish took to it. The reason of this was that a second inoculation of\r\ncowpox was not resorted to for the greater security of infants and young\r\nchildren, who were then the principal victims of smallpox in this country,\r\nbut for the protection of adults, who made a great part of the subjects of\r\nthe epidemics in other countries. There were so many adult deaths in the\r\ngreat Paris epidemic of 1825 that the news of it reads like the English\r\nreferences to smallpox in the time of the Stuarts. We obtain exact\r\nstatistics of the ages in the 3323 fatal cases of smallpox in Paris from\r\n1842 to 1851. Reduced to percentages they were as follows:\r\n\r\n  All ages 0-5  5-10  10-20  20-30  30-40  Over 40\r\n\r\n     100   33·8  5·9  13·25  32·95  10·95   3·15\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of the deaths were above the age of five years, an\r\nage-incidence that was not reached in London until a whole generation\r\nafter. The contrast with British experience comes out in concrete form in\r\nthe following table of the age-incidence of 342 fatal attacks of smallpox\r\nin 1850 and 364 in 1851, in Paris (pop. 1,000,000), and of 584 fatal\r\nattacks in Glasgow in the single year 1852 (pop. 370,000)[1170]:\r\n\r\n_Age-incidence of fatal Smallpox in Paris and in Glasgow._\r\n\r\n                         Paris, 1850-51  Glasgow, 1852\r\n                          (706 deaths)   (584 deaths)\r\n\r\n  Under one year              126             188\r\n  One to two                   32             150\r\n  Two to five                  94             189\r\n  Five to ten                  31              20\r\n  Ten to fifteen               20               4\r\n  Fifteen to twenty            51               2\r\n  Twenty to twenty-five       109              19\r\n  Twenty-five to thirty        89               2\r\n  Thirty to forty             128               8\r\n  Forty to fifty               22               1\r\n  Over fifty                    4               1\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the Continent of Europe the frequency of smallpox in\r\nadults was not less remarked than in France in the second quarter of the\r\n19th century. English writers had been able at one time to point to\r\nforeign countries for the success of infantile vaccination. Sweden and\r\nDenmark were for a long time classical illustrations; then it was\r\nGermany’s turn. “In Berlin during 1821 and 1822,” said Roberton, “only one\r\ndied of smallpox in each year. In the German States, vaccination has\r\nbecome universal, and in them as well as in various other countries the\r\nsmallpox is almost unknown.” When we next find German experience appealed\r\nto, it is to enforce the need of re-vaccination: “In 1829,” said Gregory,\r\n“the principal Governments of Germany took alarm at the rapid increase of\r\nsmallpox, and resorted to re-vaccination as a means of checking it. In\r\nPrussia, 300,000 had been re-vaccinated, and the same number in\r\nWürtemberg. In Berlin nearly all the inhabitants had undergone\r\nre-vaccination[1171].” It was about the same time that a second\r\nvaccination became obligatory in the armies of Prussia, Würtemberg, Baden\r\nand other German States, and among the pupils of schools when they reached\r\nthe age of twelve years. Dr Gregory, in his speech at the Medical and\r\nChirurgical Society of London in December, 1838, urged the need of\r\nre-vaccination not only by the example of Germany, but also by the\r\nexperience of Copenhagen, where a thousand cases of smallpox had been\r\nreceived into the hospital (it was nearly always adults that were taken to\r\nthe general hospitals) in twenty-one months of 1833-34, nine hundred of\r\nthem being of vaccinated persons[1172]. Gregory was in advance of his age\r\nin advocating re-vaccination for England. His own cases at the Smallpox\r\nHospital of London were, it is true, nearly all adults, according to the\r\nrules of the charity. But they were not representative even of the\r\nsmallpox of the capital; and in England at large smallpox in 1839 was\r\nstill distinctively a malady of the first years of life. It was not until\r\nyouths and adults began to have smallpox in large numbers in the epidemic\r\nof 1871-72 that the doctrine of re-vaccination was generally apprehended\r\nin England. Medical truth, like every other kind of truth except that of\r\ngeometry, is conditioned by time and place. What was a truth to the\r\nGermans in 1829 was not a truth to us until some forty years after. Dr\r\nGregory, Sir Henry Holland and others advised re-vaccination after the\r\nepidemic of 1837-40; but as late as 1851 the National Vaccine\r\nEstablishment denounced it as incorrect in theory and uncalled-for in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the great epidemic of 1837-40, there was an interval of a whole\r\ngeneration until smallpox broke out again on anything like the same scale,\r\nin 1871 and 1872. But it had risen to a considerable height at shorter\r\nintervals--in 1844-45, which were the years when vast numbers of navvies\r\nwere employed making railroads all over England, in 1847 and successive\r\nyears to 1852, which was the period of the great Irish migration after the\r\npotato-famine, in 1858, for which I find no explanation, and in the period\r\nfrom 1863 to 1865, which was again a time of somewhat high typhus\r\nmortality, not only in the Lancashire cotton-districts but also in London.\r\nThe great epidemic of 1871 and 1872 finds no better explanation than our\r\nneighbourhood to Germany and Belgium, where the mortality from smallpox\r\nwas far greater than in Britain, and was doubtless favoured by the state\r\nof war in 1870-71. The following tables for London, and for England and\r\nWales in comparison with measles, scarlatina and diphtheria, show the\r\nprogress of smallpox from the epidemic of 1837-40 to the present

The disease returned once more as a great\r\nepidemic in 1871-72, after an interval of a whole generation (in which\r\nthere had been, of course, a good deal of smallpox); but the epidemic of\r\n1871-72 was different in several important respects from that of 1837-40.\r\nIt was a more sudden explosion, destroying about the same number in two\r\nyears (in a population increased between a third and a half) that the\r\nepidemic a generation earlier did in four years. It was an epidemic of the\r\ntowns and the industrial counties, more than of the villages and the\r\nagricultural counties; it was an epidemic of London more than of the\r\nprovinces; and it was an epidemic of young persons and adults more than of\r\ninfants and children. The great epidemic of 1871-72 brought out clearly\r\nfor the first time all those changes in the incidence of smallpox; but\r\nthings had been moving slowly that way in the whole generation between\r\n1840 and 1871. Experience subsequent to 1871-72 has shown the same\r\ntendency at work.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the changed incidence upon rural and urban populations, a\r\nglance down the following Table, will show that the counties marked *,\r\nwith a smaller share in 1871-72, in a total of deaths in all England and\r\nWales which was nearly the same as in the great epidemic a generation\r\nbefore, are nearly all those with a population more purely rural[1174]:\r\n\r\n_Incidence of the Smallpox Epidemics of 1837-40 (four years) and 1871-72\r\n(two years) respectively upon the Counties of England and Wales._\r\n\r\n                             1837-40  1871-72\r\n   England and Wales         41,253   42,084\r\n   Metropolis                 6421     9698\r\n  *Surrey (extra-metr.)        383      231\r\n  *Kent (extra-metr.)          817      537\r\n  *Sussex                      161      126\r\n   Hampshire                   348     1103\r\n  *Berkshire                   450       46\r\n  *Middlesex (extra-metr.)     418      306\r\n  *Hertfordshire               260      157\r\n  *Buckinghamshire             268       53\r\n  *Oxfordshire                 199      109\r\n   Northamptonshire            399      563\r\n  *Huntingdonshire              65       14\r\n   Bedfordshire                125      128\r\n  *Cambridgeshire              400      175\r\n  *Essex                       773      583\r\n  *Suffolk                     506      348\r\n  *Norfolk                    1038      895\r\n  *Wiltshire                   548       85\r\n  *Dorsetshire                 329      163\r\n  *Devonshire                 1097      838\r\n  *Cornwall                    767      531\r\n  *Somersetshire              1466      412\r\n  *Gloucestershire            1072      323\r\n  *Herefordshire               191       34\r\n  *Shropshire                  345      161\r\n  *Worcestershire             1002      529\r\n   Staffordshire              1328     3050\r\n  *Warwickshire                957      785\r\n   Leicestershire              528      622\r\n   Rutlandshire                  8        7\r\n   Lincolnshire                482      498\r\n   Nottinghamshire             562      983\r\n  *Derbyshire                  329      297\r\n  *Cheshire                   1141      310\r\n  †Lancashire                 7105     4151\r\n  †Yorkshire W.

In the outbreaks subsequent\r\nto 1871-72, smallpox has almost ceased to be a rural infection in Scotland\r\nand Ireland as well as in England. The great change that has come over it\r\nin that respect is shown in the following table, in which the annual\r\ndeath-rates from smallpox per 100,000 living are contrasted, for children\r\nunder five, in each of several agricultural counties, with the mean of all\r\nEngland and of London, 1871-80, and with the corresponding scarlatinal\r\ndeath-rates in the right-hand column:\r\n\r\n_Annual Death-rates of Children under five, per 100,000 living, 1871-80._\r\n\r\n                        Smallpox   Scarlatina\r\n  All England              53         349\r\n  London                  113         307\r\n  -------------------------------------------\r\n  Sussex                    9         100\r\n  Berkshire                 4         141\r\n  Bucks                     4         160\r\n  Oxfordshire               9         167\r\n  Huntingdonshire           3         205\r\n  Bedfordshire             11         242\r\n  Cambridgeshire           18         112\r\n  Suffolk                  12         136\r\n  Wiltshire                 5         210\r\n  Dorsetshire              15         152\r\n  Herefordshire             5         166\r\n  Shropshire               12         247\r\n\r\nBut the history of smallpox since the great epidemic of 1871-72 has\r\nbrought out still another tendency in the same direction, namely, the\r\nincreasing share of London in the whole smallpox of England. In the\r\nepidemic of 1837-40, which reached to almost every parish of England and\r\nWales, London had 6449 deaths in a total of 41,644, or between a sixth and\r\na seventh part, having rather less than an eighth part of the population.\r\nIn the epidemic of 1871-72, London had between a fourth and a fifth part\r\nof the deaths (9698 in a total of 42,084), having then about a seventh\r\npart of the population. In 1877, more than half of all the smallpox deaths\r\nwere in London, and in the year after as many as 1417 in a total of 1856.\r\nIn 1881, London had about two-thirds of the deaths from smallpox in all\r\nEngland and Wales; but in the epidemic of 1884-85, it had only over a\r\nthird part (1812 in a total of 5043). This excess of London’s share over\r\nthat of the provinces is expressed in the following table, showing the\r\nrespective rates of smallpox mortality per million of the population:\r\n\r\n_Smallpox Deaths in London and the Provinces, per million of population._\r\n\r\n           1847-9 1850-4 1855-9 1860-4 1865-9 1870-4 1875-9 1880-4\r\n\r\n  London     460    300    237    281    276    654    292    244\r\n  Provinces  274    271    192    175    172    339     48     34\r\n\r\nIf the table were continued to the very latest date, it would show the\r\nprovinces recovering their share, but upon a slight prevalence of the\r\nepidemic as a whole, the deaths in London having been mere units from 1886\r\nto 1892, while in 1888 there was a severe epidemic in Sheffield and in\r\n1892-93 a good deal of the disease in a few manufacturing towns of the\r\nNorth-western and Midland divisions. It would be a not incorrect summary\r\nof the incidence of smallpox in Britain to say, that it first left the\r\nricher classes, then it left the villages, then it left the provincial\r\ntowns to centre itself in the capital; at the same time it was leaving the\r\nage of infancy and childhood. Of course it did none of these things\r\nabsolutely; but the movement in any one of those directions has been as\r\nobvious as in any other. Measles and scarlatina have not shown the same\r\ntendency to change or limit their incidence. Smallpox may have surprises\r\nin store for us; but, as it is an exotic infection, its peculiar behaviour\r\nmay not unreasonably be taken to mean that it is dying out,--dying, as in\r\nthe death of some individuals, gradually from the extremities to the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nWith all those changes, the fatality of smallpox, or the proportion of\r\ndeaths to attacks, came out in the great epidemic of 1871-72 curiously\r\nnear that of the 18th century epidemics, namely, one death in about six\r\ncases. This rate comes from the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums\r\nBoard according to the following table:\r\n\r\n_Admissions for Smallpox, with the Deaths, at the hospitals of the\r\nMetropolitan Asylums Board, from the opening of the several hospitals to\r\n30 April, 1872._\r\n\r\n               Males                  Females               Both Sexes\r\n  Age-periods        Percentage             Percentage          Percentage\r\n                         of                     of                    of\r\n           Adm.

Although the general average of deaths in 14,808\r\ncases, namely, 18·65 per cent., is nearly the same as (being slightly\r\nhigher than) that of the equally comprehensive totals of 18th century\r\ncases given at p. 518, yet the average is made up in a different way. In\r\nsome of the 18th century epidemics, such as that of Chester in 1774, all\r\nthe deaths were under ten years of age, and yet the average rate of\r\nfatality was only 14 or 15 per cent. The much higher rate of fatality from\r\nbirth to five years and from five years to ten in the London epidemic of\r\n1871-72 (which is confirmed in part by the Berlin statistics of the same\r\nyears), must have had some special reasons. One reason, doubtless, was\r\nthat the attack of smallpox in recent times has fallen upon comparatively\r\nfew children, whereas in former times it fell upon nearly the whole; and\r\nit may be inferred that the infants who have been in recent times subject\r\nto the attack of smallpox have also been of the class that are most likely\r\nto die of it. The high rates of fatality at the ages above thirty in the\r\ntable agree with the experience of all times.\r\n\r\nThe percentages of fatalities from smallpox in the hospitals of the\r\nMetropolitan Asylums Board have varied as follows from their opening to\r\nthe present time:\r\n\r\n                                       Percentage\r\n                               Cases    of deaths\r\n\r\n  1 Dec. 1870-3 Feb. 1871        582     20·81\r\n  4 Feb. 1871-31 Jan. 1872    13,145     18·95\r\n  1872-3                        2362     17·84\r\n  1873-4                         191}\r\n  1874 (11 mo.)                  120}    17·02\r\n  1875                           111}\r\n  1876                          2150     21·64\r\n  1877                          6620     17·92\r\n  1878                          4654     17·99\r\n  1879                          1688     15·69\r\n  1880                          2032     15·95\r\n  1881                          8671     16·61\r\n  1882                          1854     12·96\r\n  1883                           626     16·06\r\n  1884                          6567     15·98\r\n  1885                          6344     15·8\r\n  1886                           132}\r\n  1887                            59}\r\n  1888                            67}    14·28\r\n  1889                             5}\r\n  1890                            27}\r\n  1891                            64}\r\n  1892                           348     11·29\r\n  1893                          2376      7·75\r\n\r\nThe decline in average fatality in the last two years is remarkable, and\r\nis to be explained chiefly by the mild type of smallpox which has been\r\nprevalent; a very small fraction of the patients attacked between the ages\r\nof ten and twenty-five have died; and these are some two-fifths of the\r\nwhole.

It would appear to have been less diffused through the country\r\nthan in former famines, such as that of 1817-18, or those of the first\r\npart of the 18th century, just in proportion as the vagrancy of\r\nfamine-times was checked by the establishment of workhouses. In the\r\nworkhouses and auxiliary workhouses during the ten years 1841-51, smallpox\r\nis credited with 5016 deaths, while measles has 8943, fever 34,644,\r\ndysentery 50,019, diarrhoea 20,507, and Asiatic cholera 6716.\r\nRegistration began in Ireland in 1864, and showed little smallpox for the\r\nfirst few years. The next great epidemic, of 1871-72, showed the incidence\r\nupon the large towns, and the comparative immunity of the country\r\npopulation, even more strikingly than in England. In a total mortality of\r\n3913 during the two years of 1871 and 1872, the three counties of Dublin,\r\nCork and Antrim had the following enormous share, which fell mostly to the\r\nthree cities of Dublin, Cork and Belfast:\r\n\r\n  Dublin Co.    1825\r\n  Cork Co.      1070\r\n  Antrim         510\r\n               -----\r\n                3405 deaths in 3913 for all Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn that epidemic the whole province of Connaught had only 25 deaths from\r\nsmallpox; but a subsequent visitation, a few years after, fell mainly upon\r\nConnaught.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic which began in Scotland in 1871 was distributed over a\r\nsomewhat longer period than the corresponding outbreak in England; but the\r\nbulk of it fell in the two years 1871 and 1872. The total of 3890 deaths\r\nin those two years was distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n  Eight largest towns         2441\r\n  Next largest towns           259\r\n  Small town districts         574\r\n  Mainland rural districts     586\r\n  Insular rural districts       30\r\n                              ----\r\n                              3890\r\n\r\nGlasgow had a considerably smaller relative share than Edinburgh, and\r\naltogether a much lighter incidence of the disease than in the years\r\n1835-52, for which the figures have been given above (pp. 600-1). In the\r\nfollowing table of the annual deaths in Scotland from the beginning of\r\nregistration, the four other infective diseases of childhood included\r\nalong with smallpox show by comparison the remarkable decline of smallpox\r\nsince 1874, scarlatina being the only other infection of childhood which\r\nhas become greatly less common or less fatal.\r\n\r\n_Scotland.

In\r\nno period of its history has smallpox been so purely an infantile\r\ncomplaint as measles[1175], nor so purely a malady of childhood and early\r\nyouth as scarlatina or diphtheria[1176]. When it first rose to prominence\r\nin England, from the reign of James I. onwards, it attacked adults in a\r\nlarge proportion; of which fact the evidence, although not statistical, is\r\nsufficient. But, as the disease became nearly universal and ubiquitous, it\r\nwas so commonly passed in infancy or childhood, that few grew to maturity\r\nwithout having had it. The number of adult cases diminished in proportion\r\nas the disease became more nearly universal. In the great period of\r\nsmallpox in the 18th century, about nine-tenths of the deaths occurred\r\nunder the age of five, and nearly all the remaining fraction between five\r\nand ten years, at Manchester, Chester, Warrington, Carlisle and\r\nKilmarnock. But in London there were always a good many adult deaths, the\r\nreason commonly given being that there was a steady influx to the capital\r\nof domestic servants and others from country parishes where the epidemics\r\ncame at sufficiently long intervals to let many children grow up without\r\nincurring the risk of it. Also at Geneva and the Hague, in the 18th\r\ncentury, there were many more deaths above the age of five than in the\r\nEnglish provincial towns at the same time.\r\n\r\n_Ages at Death from Smallpox at Geneva (including Measles) and at the\r\nHague (Duvillard)._\r\n\r\n             All   0-1   -2   -3   -4   -5   -6   -7  -8  -9  -10 -15 -20\r\n             ages\r\n\r\n  Geneva\r\n  (1700-83)} 3328  555  608  588  426  346  232  185  99  67   44  84  36\r\n\r\n  The Hague}\r\n  (15 years}\r\n     of    } 1455  172  170  179  224  160  148  114  78  58   23  47  17\r\n    18th   }\r\n   cent.)  }\r\n\r\n                 -25 -30 -35 -40 -45\r\n\r\n      Geneva\r\n      (1700-83)}  26  21   0   0   0\r\n\r\n      The Hague}\r\n      (15 years}\r\n         of    }  24  14  10   8   3\r\n        18th   }\r\n       cent.)  }\r\n\r\nTwenty-four per cent. of the smallpox deaths in the 18th century at Geneva\r\nwere above the age of five years, and at the Hague thirty-seven per cent.,\r\nwhile in the former the ratio would probably have been higher but for the\r\ninclusion of measles. But, with this comparatively high ratio of deaths\r\nabove the age of five, smallpox was a much less important cause of\r\nmortality at Geneva and the Hague than at Manchester, Glasgow, Chester,\r\nand most other provincial cities of this country, making about a fifteenth\r\npart of the deaths from all causes in the former, and as high as a sixth\r\npart in the latter.\r\n\r\nThe infantile character of smallpox was as marked as ever in the epidemic\r\nof 1817-19; of which the Norwich statistics are sufficient proof. As late\r\nas the epidemic of 1837-40, smallpox was still distinctively a malady of\r\ninfants and young children in Britain, although that was by no means the\r\ncase on the continent of Europe at the same time.

(26 in a total of 522). At Glasgow, from 1835 to\r\n1839, twelve per cent. of the smallpox deaths were above the age of five\r\n(see p. 600). These are the rates of provincial cities; but in a total of\r\n8714 deaths in the year 1839, added together from London and the\r\nprovinces, about twenty-five per cent. were over five, and of these a\r\nmoiety were over ten years:\r\n\r\n  All ages   Under five   Five to ten   Above ten\r\n\r\n    8714        6453         1122         1139\r\n\r\nA good deal of that mortality above the age of five must have come from\r\nLondon, according to the probability of the following table, which is of\r\nsix years’ later date, but the nearest that can be got for London alone:\r\n\r\n_London, 1845.

In the three years before the outburst of 1871\r\nthe deaths under five and over five were approaching an equality; in the\r\nepidemic itself the old ratios were suddenly reversed:\r\n\r\n        Smallpox deaths   Smallpox deaths\r\n  Year     under five        over five\r\n\r\n  1868       1234              818\r\n  1869        892              673\r\n  1870       1245             1375\r\n  1871       7770            15356\r\n  1872       5758            13336\r\n\r\nIn the whole generation between 1840 and 1871, in which there was no great\r\nand general epidemic of smallpox, many had passed from childhood to\r\nadolescence and maturity without encountering the risk of it. When the\r\nepidemic of 1871 began, it found many in youth or mature years who had not\r\nbeen through the smallpox, and it attacked a certain proportion of them\r\naccordingly. The proportion above the age of five so attacked in 1871-72\r\nwas greater than it had been in this country since the beginning of the\r\n18th century; indeed, as the information is not in statistical form for\r\nthe earlier period, it may be asserted, and it may happen to be true, that\r\nit was greater than it had ever been in this country at any time. The\r\nreason for the large proportion of adult cases was the same in the rise of\r\nsmallpox as in its decline, namely, that in the respective circumstances\r\nan epidemic found many who had not been through the disease in infancy or\r\nchildhood. The same happened in those parts of the world where the\r\nepidemics of smallpox came at long intervals, during which many had passed\r\nfrom childhood to youth or mature age without once encountering the risk\r\nof smallpox.\r\n\r\n    Such were the epidemics at Boston, New England, and Charleston, South\r\n    Carolina, in the 18th century. Not only do the accounts of them speak\r\n    of the disease as if it were mainly one of the higher ages, but it\r\n    follows from the ratio of attacks to population, known in the case of\r\n    Boston, that adolescence and adult age must have had a full share,\r\n    considering that these age-periods included all who were protected by\r\n    a previous attack. The years of epidemic smallpox at Boston were 1702,\r\n    1721, 1730 and 1752: of these four the two worst were 1721 and 1752,\r\n    the one epidemic following a clear interval of nineteen years, the\r\n    other a more or less clear interval of twenty-two years:\r\n\r\n    _Smallpox in Boston, Massachusetts_[1178].\r\n\r\n              Population,  Attacked    Died      Had       Moved\r\n                whites        by        of     smallpox     out\r\n              and blacks   smallpox  smallpox   before     of town\r\n\r\n        1721   10,565        5989      844      All the      --\r\n                                               rest less\r\n                                                  750\r\n\r\n        1752   15,684        5545      569       5598      1843\r\n\r\n    These enormous mortalities in Boston were comparable to those of the\r\n    old plague itself in European cities, not only in falling upon all\r\n    ages but also in doubling or trebling for a single year at long\r\n    intervals the annual average of deaths:\r\n\r\n                Deaths of    Deaths of\r\n                 whites       blacks      Total\r\n\r\n         1701      146          --         146\r\n        *1702      441          --         441\r\n\r\n         1720      261          68         329\r\n        *1721      968         134        1102\r\n         1722      240          33         273\r\n\r\n        *1730      740         160         909\r\n         1731      318          90         408\r\n\r\n        *1752      893         116        1009\r\n\r\n        * Smallpox years.\r\n\r\nJust as smallpox in its first great outbursts in the London of the\r\nStuarts, or in its rare outbreaks in the American colonies in the 18th\r\ncentury, fell impartially upon children and adults, so in its last\r\noutbursts in the London of Victoria it fell upon persons at all ages. The\r\nnotable thing is, not that smallpox should have of late been attacking\r\nadults, for that it has ever done except in times and places in which\r\nthere were few or no adults who had not been through the disease in\r\nchildhood; but that it should have ceased to so large an extent to attack\r\ninfants and children. It has ceased to attack infants and children because\r\nother infective and non-infective diseases more appropriate to the modern\r\nconditions of the population are attacking them instead. These are measles\r\nand whooping-cough, scarlatina and diphtheria, infantile diarrhoea, and\r\nthe more chronic after-effects of these. The annual death-rate from all\r\ndiseases under the age of five has fluctuated somewhat per million living\r\nfrom 1837 to the present time, but it can hardly be said that it has\r\nfallen much or steadily[1179].\r\n\r\nKeeping still to the epidemic of 1871-72, let us consider whether there\r\nwas any natural or epidemiological reason for its cutting off a smaller\r\nratio of infants and children in its whole mortality than that of 1837-40\r\ndid. There had been a most disastrous epidemic of scarlatina for three\r\nyears just before, which had caused 21,912 deaths in 1868, 27,641 in 1869,\r\nand 32,543 in 1870, a total of 82,096 in three years, about two-thirds of\r\nwhich were under the age of five, or at the age-period which smallpox used\r\nto be fatal to almost exclusively and to be the greatest single epidemic\r\nscourge of. Even in the two smallpox years themselves the scarlatinal\r\ndeaths were 18,567 and 11,922, of which the share that fell to children\r\nunder five was one and a half times the deaths in that age-period from the\r\nco-existing smallpox. The three years of excessive scarlatina, before the\r\nepidemic of smallpox began, had removed large numbers of the class of\r\ninfants and children who succumb to any infectious disease; if we cannot\r\ngive the whole _rationale_ of one infection dispossessing or anticipating\r\nanother, we can at least understand that the earlier and more dominant\r\ninfection takes off the likely subjects. What scarlatina did egregiously\r\nduring the three years just before the great explosion of smallpox, it\r\nhad been doing steadily (along with measles, &c.) throughout a whole\r\ngeneration since the last great sacrifice of infants and children by\r\nsmallpox in 1837-40. But the fact that scarlatina had in great part\r\ndispossessed smallpox among the factors of mortality under the age of\r\nfive, did not prevent the latter infection from attacking those of the\r\nhigher ages who were susceptible of it and were at the same time unvexed\r\nby any other great epidemic malady proper to their time of life. If the\r\nepidemic of smallpox in 1871-72 had cut off as large a ratio under the age\r\nof five years as its immediate predecessor in 1837-40 did, its whole\r\nmortality would have been about 70,000 more than it actually was. But in\r\nno state of the population or of the public health can we suppose that\r\nthree years of excessive mortality of children by one kind of contagion\r\nwould be followed immediately by two years of equally special mortality at\r\nthe same ages by contagion of another kind. It is not only epidemiological\r\nscience that tells us this, but also common sense--_est modus in rebus_.\r\n\r\nThe saving of life by checking the prevalence of smallpox was a favourite\r\nrhetorical topic in the 18th century. Voltaire, La Condamine, Bernoulli,\r\nWatson, Haygarth and others, were fond of estimating how many thousands of\r\nlives might be saved in a year if inoculation were thoroughly carried out.\r\nDr Lettsom, Sir Thomas Bernard and Mr James Neild, who were interested in\r\nprison reforms and in whatever else would reduce the prevalence of typhus,\r\nreckoned the possible saving of life under that head as almost equal to\r\nthe possible saving from smallpox[1180]. For typhus there was no\r\nartificial means of restraint; it had to decline before natural causes, if\r\nit declined at all,--which, indeed, it has done. But no one at that time\r\nthought of keeping down smallpox except by the inoculation of itself or of\r\ncowpox. The economists and statisticians treated each of these artifices\r\nin its turn as a factor having a certain absolute value, which they might\r\nuse like the _a_ and _b_ of a problem in algebra. This they did, of\r\ncourse, in deference to medical authority. What Bernoulli had worked out\r\nfor the old inoculation, Duvillard did for the new, in his “Tables showing\r\nthe Influence of Smallpox on the Mortality of each period of Life, and the\r\nInfluence that such a preservative as Vaccine may have on the Population\r\nand on Longevity[1181].” Malthus fell into the conventional way of\r\nthinking when he assumed that smallpox alone among the epidemic checks of\r\npopulation was to be controlled artificially; but he introduced an\r\nimportant new consideration. “For my own part,” he wrote in 1803, “I feel\r\nnot the slightest doubt, that if the introduction of the cowpox should\r\nextirpate the smallpox, and yet the number of marriages continue the same,\r\nwe shall find a very perceptible difference in the increased mortality of\r\nsome other diseases[1182].”\r\n\r\nFive years after this was written, there came, in 1808, the disastrous\r\nepidemic of measles, which in Glasgow killed more infants in a few months\r\nthan smallpox had ever done at its worst in the same city. In the winter\r\nof 1811-12 there was another severe epidemic of measles in Glasgow; and in\r\n1813, Dr Watt, a leading physician of the place, and a man now famous in\r\nall countries for his vast labours as a bibliographer, gave to the world\r\nhis statistical proof, from the Glasgow burial registers, of that law of\r\nsubstitution which Malthus had found necessary in his deduced principles.\r\n\r\n    “The first thing,” said Watt, “that strikes the mind in surveying the\r\n    preceding Table (1783-1812), is the vast diminution in the proportion\r\n    of deaths by the smallpox, a reduction from 19·55 to 3·90. But the\r\n    increase in the subsequent column [measles] is still more remarkable,\r\n    an increase from 0·95 to 10·76. In the smallpox we have the deaths\r\n    reduced to nearly a fifth of what they were twenty-five years ago [in\r\n    ratio of the deaths from all causes]; in the same period the deaths by\r\n    measles have increased more than eleven times. This is a fact so\r\n    striking that I am astonished it has not attracted the notice of older\r\n    practitioners, who have had it in their power to compare the mortality\r\n    by measles in former periods with what all of them must have\r\n    experienced during the last five years[1183].”\r\n\r\nThe high ratio of measles and the low ratio of smallpox did not remain as\r\nWatt’s researches left them. When Cowan resumed the tabulation of figures\r\nfrom 1835 to 1839 he found the ratios of those two infantile infections\r\nalmost equal, and the two together contributing to the whole mortality of\r\nGlasgow only a little more than half their joint share in the end of the\r\n18th century. The substitution which Watt saw during a few years was only\r\nthe most dramatic part of a general movement forwards of measles among the\r\ncauses of infantile mortality. He supposed, as everyone did at that time,\r\nthat smallpox was forcibly repressed, and that another infectious disease\r\nhad seized the opportunity to become exuberant. The most relevant thing in\r\nthe whole situation was urged by those who thought, with Jenner, that the\r\ndoctrine of substitution had an “evil tendency” as detracting from the\r\nabsolute value of the inoculation principle. In order to discredit Dr Watt\r\naltogether, they pointed out that his ratios of smallpox and measles took\r\nno account of the diminished death-rate of Glasgow by all diseases in the\r\nearlier years of the 19th century.\r\n\r\nGreat changes were proceeding in the old city, the Glasgow of ‘Rob Roy.’\r\nThe population which was reckoned at 45,889 in the year 1785, had\r\nincreased to 66,578 in the year 1791, and thereafter, at a slower rate, to\r\n83,769 in 1801 and to 100,749 in 1811. The first great increase after the\r\nAmerican War meant overcrowding; but in a short time new suburbs spread\r\nover such an extent that, in the year 1798, more than half the burials\r\nwere in the graveyards attached to chapels-of-ease and meeting-houses\r\noutside the original parishes. The modern expansion of Glasgow, like that\r\nof London and of all other large cities, has been an increase of area\r\nstill more than an increase of numbers. The public health improved\r\nsteadily, at all events until 1817, the improvement being shown first in\r\nthe increasing number of infants that survived their second year. That\r\nrise in the probability of life corresponded to the substitution of\r\nmeasles for smallpox, and in part depended upon the ascendancy of the\r\nmilder infection. Still more remarkable was the rise of scarlatina, which\r\nDr Watt did not live to see; so little was made of it at the date of his\r\nwriting that he found “scarlatina, typhus, &c., all comprehended under the\r\nsame head.” The seeds of measles and scarlatina had long existed beside\r\nthe seeds of smallpox, but the ascendancy of each of the two former had to\r\nwait events. Said Banquo to the witches who hailed Macbeth as king and\r\nhimself as the sire of later kings:\r\n\r\n  “If you can look into the seeds of time,\r\n   And say which grain will grow, and which will not--”\r\n\r\nThe succession of reigning infections is the same problem. All we can say\r\nis that each new predominant type is somehow suited to the changed\r\nconditions. In the long period covered by this history we have seen much\r\ncoming and going among the epidemic infections, in some cases a dramatic\r\nand abrupt entrance or exit, in other cases a gradual and unperceived\r\nsubstitution. Some of the greatest of those changes have fallen within the\r\ntwo hundred years since Sydenham kept notes of the prevalent epidemics of\r\nLondon. We are that posterity, or a generation of it, which he expected\r\nwould have its own proper experiences of epidemics and at the same time\r\nwould know all that had passed meanwhile--“posteris quibus integrum\r\nepidemicorum curriculum venientibus annis sibi invicem succedentium\r\nintueri dabitur.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMEASLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the earliest English writings on medicine, measles is the inseparable\r\ncompanion of smallpox; so closely are they joined in pathology and\r\ntreatment that even the statements as to the pustules and scars of the\r\neruption are in some compends made to apply to both without distinction.\r\nThis singular conjunction of two diseases came originally from the Arabian\r\nteaching, which was everywhere authoritative in the medieval period, and\r\nespecially authoritative in all that related to smallpox. In the Latin\r\ncompends based upon Avicenna or other Arabic writers, the two names were\r\n_variolae_ and _morbilli_, the former being as it were the _morbus_ proper\r\nand the latter its diminutive. It can hardly be doubted that we owe the\r\nEnglish name of measles as the equivalent of _morbilli_ to John of\r\nGaddesden. Originally the English word meant the leprous, first in the\r\nLatin form _miselli_ and _misellae_ (diminutive of _miser_), as in the\r\nhistories of Matthew Paris, and later in the Norman-French form of\r\n_mesles_, as in the Acts of Parliament of Edward I. and in the ‘Vision of\r\nPiers the Ploughman.’ In the 15th century the leper-houses in the suburbs\r\nof London were called the “lazarcotes” or “meselcotes.”\r\n\r\nGaddesden, by some unaccountable stretch of similarity, coupled the sores\r\nor tubercular nodules on the legs of “pauperes vel consumptivi,” who were\r\ncalled “_anglicé_ mesles,” with the spotted rash of the Arabian\r\n“morbilli”; and it was doubtless this haphazard bracketting of two unlike\r\ndiseases that led in course of time to the name of mesles being disjoined\r\nfrom its original sense of the leprous and restricted to the second member\r\nof Gaddesden’s strangely assorted couple. In the time of Henry VIII.\r\nsmallpox and mezils are familiarly named together just as _variolae et\r\nmorbilli_ are an inseparable pair in the treatises of the Arabistic\r\nwriters. A still more singular usurpation by “mezils” or “maysilles” or\r\n“measles” is met with in the Elizabethan period. In the vocabulary of\r\nLevins, a schoolmaster who was also a medical graduate of Oxford, the word\r\n_variolae_ is rendered by “ye maysilles,” while _morbilli_ is omitted\r\naltogether among the Latin names and smallpox among the English; and in\r\nthe English translation of Latin aphorisms appended to one of the works of\r\nWilliam Clowes, surgeon to St Bartholomew’s Hospital, _variolae_ is in\r\nlike manner translated “measles” on every occasion. In the English\r\ndictionary by Baret, belonging to the same period, measles is defined as\r\n“a disease with many reddish spottes or speckles in the face and bodie,\r\nmuch like freckles in colour”--which seems to exclude the possibility of a\r\npustular disease having been part of the Elizabethan notion of measles.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this singular usage of the vocabularies and dictionaries,\r\nthe name of smallpox occurs by itself in letters or other memorials of the\r\nElizabethan period, having been doubtless correctly applied to the true\r\npustular _variola_. In the short essay on smallpox by Kellwaye, appended\r\nto his book on the plague (1593), measles and smallpox are distinguished\r\non the whole clearly, according to the definitions of Fracastori or other\r\nforeign writers of the 16th century. The association between measles and\r\nsmallpox that survived longest was a peculiar and somewhat uncommon one;\r\ncertain cases of smallpox, in which the pustules were wholly or partially\r\nrepresented by, or changed into, broad spots level with the skin, red or\r\nlivid in colour, and in which haemorrhages occurred from the nose, lungs,\r\nbowels or kidneys, that is to say, cases of haemorrhagic smallpox, were\r\napt to be called, from the time of James I. until as late as the case of\r\nQueen Mary in 1694, by the name of “smallpox and measles mingled.”\r\n\r\nFrom the date of the annual bills of mortality by the Parish Clerks of\r\nLondon, the year 1629, it is improbable that there was any real confusion\r\nbetween smallpox and measles; there was certainly some ambiguity in the\r\nentry of measles long after, but that later confusion, especially in the\r\nsecond half of the 18th century, was with scarlatina[1184]. The entry of\r\nmeasles is in the bills from the first, apart from that of “flox and\r\nsmallpox:”\r\n\r\n\r\n         Measles    Smallpox\r\n  Year    deaths     deaths\r\n\r\n  1629      42         72\r\n  1630       2         40\r\n  1631       3         58\r\n  1632      80        531\r\n  1633      21         72\r\n  1634      33       1354\r\n  1635      27        293\r\n  1636      12        127\r\n  1647       5        139\r\n  1648      92        401\r\n  1649       3       1190\r\n  1650      33        184\r\n  1651      33        525\r\n  1652      62       1279\r\n  1653       8        139\r\n  1654      52        832\r\n  1655      11       1294\r\n  1656     153        823\r\n  1657      15        835\r\n  1658      80        409\r\n  1659       6       1523\r\n  1660      74        354\r\n\r\nIn the great epidemic of smallpox in 1628, the year before the bills\r\nbegin, Thomas Alured wrote to Sir John Coke that his house in London had\r\nbeen visited “once with the measles and twice with the smallpox, though I\r\nthank God we are now free; and I know not how many households have run the\r\nsame hazard[1185].” In the year 1656, which has the highest total in the\r\nabove table, two cases of measles are mentioned in a letter of 31st May:\r\n“Young Sir Charles Sedley is at this time very sick of a feaver and the\r\nmeazells, of which Sir William dyed”--Charles Sedley being then in his\r\nseventeenth year[1186]. An instance parallel to that of 1628, of measles\r\nand smallpox co-existing in the same household, occurred in the royal\r\npalace at Whitehall in December, 1660. The princess of Orange, sister of\r\nthe king, died of smallpox on the 23rd; on that day, or a day or two\r\nbefore, her sister the princess Henrietta, who had come from France on a\r\nvisit with the queen-mother, Henrietta Maria, removed from Whitehall to St\r\nJames’s, “for fear of infection.” After a few days she embarked on board\r\nthe ‘London’ at Portsmouth to return to France, but the ship had to come\r\nto anchor again owing to the princess being attacked with “the measles.”\r\nHer illness, which delayed the sailing of the vessel until the 24th of\r\nJanuary, 1661, is uniformly spoken of as the measles in the various\r\nletters which make mention of it[1187]. In that year, and in several of\r\nthe next ten years, the measles deaths in London reached a considerable\r\ntotal:\r\n\r\n          Measles\r\n  Year    deaths\r\n\r\n  1661     188\r\n  1662      20\r\n  1663      42\r\n  1664     311\r\n  1665       7\r\n  1666       3\r\n  1667      83\r\n  1668     200\r\n  1669      15\r\n  1670     295\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of 1670 is the subject of a description by Sydenham, the\r\ndiagnostic points of which were doubtless those current at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSydenham’s description of Measles in London, 1670 and 1674.\r\n\r\nSydenham’s account of the epidemic of 1670 is full enough to leave no\r\ndoubt that it was measles of the ordinary kind; the details, indeed, are\r\nas minute for all essential points as they would be in a modern\r\ntext-book[1188]:\r\n\r\n    Measles, he says, is a disease mainly of young children (_infantes_),\r\n    and is apt to run through all that are under one roof. It begins with\r\n    a rigor, followed by heats and chills during the first day. On the\r\n    second day there is fever, with intense malaise, thirst, loss of\r\n    appetite, white tongue (not actually dry), slight cough, heaviness of\r\n    the head and eyes, and constant drowsiness. In most cases a humour\r\n    distils from the nose and eyes, the effusion or suffusion of tears\r\n    being the most certain sign of sickening for measles, more certain\r\n    indeed than the exanthem. The child sneezes as if it had taken cold,\r\n    the eyelids swell, there may be vomiting, more usually there are loose\r\n    green stools (especially during dentition), and there is excessive\r\n    fretfulness. On the fourth or fifth day small red maculae, like\r\n    fleabites, begin to appear on the forehead and the rest of the face,\r\n    which coalesce, as they continue to come out in increasing numbers, so\r\n    as to form racemose clusters. These maculae will be found by the touch\r\n    to be slightly elevated, although they seem level to the eye. On the\r\n    trunk and limbs, to which they gradually extend, they are not\r\n    elevated. About the sixth day the maculae begin to roughen and scale,\r\n    from the face downwards, and by the eighth day are scarcely\r\n    discernible anywhere. On the ninth day the whole body is as if dusted\r\n    with bran. The common people say that the spots had “turned inwards,”\r\n    by which they mean that, if it had been smallpox, they would have\r\n    remained out longer, and have proceeded to suppuration or maturation.\r\n    The rash having thus “gone in,” there is an access of fever, attended\r\n    with laboured breathing and cough, the latter being so incessant as to\r\n    keep the children from sleep day or night. If they had been treated by\r\n    the heating regimen, they are apt to have the chest troubles pass\r\n    into peripneumonia, by which complication measles becomes more\r\n    destructive than smallpox itself, although there is no danger in it if\r\n    it be rightly treated. When peripneumonia threatens, the patient\r\n    should be bled, even if it be a tender infant. Diarrhoea, which\r\n    sometimes continues for weeks after an attack of measles, may be cut\r\n    short by blood-letting, and so also may whooping-cough.\r\n\r\nThis epidemic, says Sydenham, began in January, and was almost ended in\r\nJuly, which agrees exactly with the rise and decline of measles deaths in\r\nthe weekly bills of the Parish Clerks.\r\n\r\nHis account of the epidemic of 1674 is still more important to be set\r\nbeside the figures in the bills; for the type, according to Sydenham, was\r\nanomalous, and the total of deaths entered by the Parish Clerks (795) is\r\nexceptionally large. Like the epidemic four years before, it began in\r\nJanuary, came to a height about the vernal equinox, and was nearly over at\r\nthe summer solstice[1189].\r\n\r\n_Weekly Deaths in London in the first six months of 1674.

But in that week the deaths from all causes\r\nreached the enormous total of 695, which was nearly three hundred above\r\nthe weekly average of the time. This appears to have been the epidemic of\r\nmeasles which Morton declares to have destroyed three hundred in a week, a\r\nmode of reckoning which would claim for measles, directly or indirectly,\r\nthe excess of mortality from all causes during the height of the\r\nepidemic[1190].\r\n\r\nThese high weekly mortalities in February, March, April and May are\r\nremarkable for the season of the year. Usually when the weekly figures\r\nreach six or seven hundred, it is in a hot autumn, and the cause is\r\ninfantile diarrhoea, represented in the bills by the excessive number of\r\ndeaths from “griping in the guts” and “convulsions;” more rarely, and then\r\nonly for three or four weeks, correspondingly high figures are reached in\r\na season of influenza. But in this case the epidemic measles is the only\r\nrelevant thing. The measles deaths by themselves do by no means account\r\nfor the enormous weekly totals; but two of the three columns of figures\r\nwhich help them, and indeed keep pace with the rise of the measles deaths,\r\nnamely, “convulsions” and “teeth,” are infantile deaths obviously related\r\nto the prevailing epidemic; while the third column, “consumption,” which\r\ncontributes most of all, did not in the London bills mean pulmonary\r\nconsumption exclusively, but also the wasting or marasmus which followed\r\nor attended acute fevers in general, and was specially apt to follow or\r\nattend measles[1191].\r\n\r\nSydenham gives no indication that the spring of 1674 was unusually\r\nproductive of pneumonia or pleurisy among adults; the winter, he says, was\r\nunusually warm, the weather in spring turning colder. But, as to the\r\nmeasles, he does say that the epidemic was anomalous or irregular; while\r\nboth he and Morton refer the fatalities more especially to the sequelae of\r\nmeasles,--to the “suffocation” of infants and children by the bronchitis\r\nor peripneumonia, or to “angina,” as Morton says, meaning perhaps the same\r\nas in Scotland was understood by “closing” in infants. Measles itself was\r\na milder disease than smallpox, according to the experience of all times;\r\nand yet, by its sequelae (bronchitis, capillary bronchitis and pneumonia,\r\nincluding what Morton calls “angina,” and excluding, for the present,\r\nwhooping-cough), it raised the weekly mortalities of February, March,\r\nApril and May, 1674, to far above the average. Sydenham said, with\r\nreference to the much milder epidemic of 1670, that these after-effects of\r\nmeasles “destroyed more than even smallpox itself” (_quae_\r\n[_peripneumonia_] _plures jugulat quam aut variolae ipsae_). We shall not\r\ncorrectly understand the part played by measles among the infective\r\nmaladies of children unless we keep that grand character of it in\r\nmind--that its effects upon the mortality of infancy and childhood are\r\nonly in part expressed by the deaths actually appearing under its name.\r\n\r\nThe London bills for 1674 afford us the opportunity of testing Sydenham’s\r\nparadox that measles, by its after-effects, destroyed more than smallpox\r\nitself. The epidemic of measles was nearly over in June; and immediately\r\nthereafter an epidemic of smallpox began (not of course from zero but from\r\nthe usual level of the disease), which reached a maximum of 122 deaths in\r\nthe week ending 20th October. The second half of the year was thus marked\r\nby a sharp outburst of smallpox, as the first half was marked by a sharp\r\noutburst of measles; and those two diseases were the only epidemic\r\nmaladies that gave character to the respective seasons, each being in its\r\nproper season, according to Sydenham--measles in the spring, smallpox in\r\nthe autumn. Although the measles deaths were only 795 for the whole year,\r\nthe smallpox deaths being 2507, yet the former epidemic was attended by so\r\ngreat an excess of deaths under various other heads that the half of the\r\nyear in which it fell was far more unhealthy than the succeeding half in\r\nwhich the smallpox mainly fell, the weekly average of the first six months\r\nhaving been 468 deaths, and of the second six months 349 deaths. The\r\nfollowing table shows the weekly mortalities for the second half of the\r\nyear; it will be observed that no column of figures keeps pace with the\r\nrise of the smallpox deaths, as three columns had kept pace with the rise\r\nof the measles deaths in the first six months of the year.\r\n\r\n_Weekly Deaths in London in the last six months of 1674.

It is open to us to\r\nsuppose that it would not have been so high but for the epidemic of\r\nmeasles preceding. The measles not only made the first half of the year\r\nfar more deadly than the second, within which most of the smallpox fell,\r\nbut its effects may have aided the high mortality of smallpox itself,\r\naccording to the experience of later times that infants and young children\r\nrecovering from measles in a greatly weakened condition fell an easier\r\nprey to smallpox coming after[1192].\r\n\r\nMorton passes from the fatal epidemic of 1674 (or, as he says, 1672), with\r\nthe remark that the malady had not been epidemic again in London from that\r\ntime until the date of his writing, 1692-94, a period of nearly twenty\r\nyears; and that is on the whole borne out by the London bills and by\r\nSydenham’s records so far as they extend. From 1687 to 1700, inclusive,\r\nthe London bills grouped the measles deaths along with the deaths from\r\nsmallpox, under the heading, “Flox, Smallpox and Measles”; in 1701 the\r\ntotal of measles, 4 deaths, is given as a separate item in the same\r\nbracket with smallpox; and in 1702 the heading of “Measles,” is restored\r\nto the place in the alphabetical list which it had held, except for that\r\nunaccountable break, from the beginning of the published bills in 1629.\r\nThe following are the annual totals from and including the great epidemic\r\nof 1674:\r\n\r\n           Death from\r\n  Year      measles\r\n\r\n  1674       795\r\n  1675         1\r\n  1676        83\r\n  1677        87\r\n  1678        93\r\n  1679       117\r\n  1680        49\r\n  1681       121\r\n  1682        50\r\n  1683        39\r\n  1684         6\r\n  1685       197\r\n  1686        25\r\n\r\nThus for a good many years after the general prevalence of measles in 1674\r\nthe deaths from it in London averaged only about one and a half in the\r\nweek, while in no year until 1705-6 is there an epidemic comparable to\r\nthat of 1674. It is clear that the severe epidemics of measles came at\r\nfirst at very long intervals, and that the years between had a very\r\nmoderate mortality from that disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasles in the 18th century.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a reference to be found to measles in medical or other\r\nwritings until the annual accounts of the public health at Ripon, York,\r\nPlymouth, etc. in the third decade of the 18th century. The annual deaths\r\nfrom it in London, according to the bills, were as follows, from 1701,\r\nwhen the disease was restored to its separate place in the classification:\r\n\r\n  Year  Measles\r\n         deaths\r\n\r\n  1701      4\r\n  1702     27\r\n  1703     51\r\n  1704     12\r\n  1705    319\r\n  1706    361\r\n  1707     37\r\n  1708    126\r\n  1709     89\r\n  1710    181\r\n  1711     97\r\n  1712     77\r\n  1713     61\r\n  1714    139\r\n  1715     30\r\n  1716    270\r\n  1717     35\r\n  1718    492\r\n  1719    243\r\n  1720    213\r\n  1721    238\r\n  1722    114\r\n  1723    231\r\n  1724    118\r\n  1725     70\r\n  1726    256\r\n  1727     72\r\n  1728     82\r\n  1729     41\r\n  1730    311\r\n  1731    102\r\n  1732     30\r\n  1733    605\r\n  1734     20\r\n  1735     10\r\n  1736    169\r\n  1737    127\r\n  1738    216\r\n  1739    326\r\n  1740     46\r\n\r\nThe high mortalities of 1705 and 1706 belonged to one continuous epidemic\r\nfrom October, 1705, to April, 1706 (Sir David Hamilton says that smallpox\r\nwas common in London in July, 1705, but the deaths in the bills are not\r\nexcessive). The epidemic followed a great prevalence of the autumnal\r\ndiarrhoea of infants, so that it is probable the high mortality was due as\r\nmuch to a greater fatality of cases from the antecedent weakening, as to\r\nan unusual number of cases[1193]. The following were the weekly deaths in\r\na population about one-sixth that of London now:\r\n\r\n1705-1706\r\n\r\n   Week   Measles\r\n  ending   deaths\r\n\r\n  Oct. 16     9\r\n       23     9\r\n       30    12\r\n  Nov.  6    10\r\n       13    30\r\n       20    34\r\n       27    29\r\n  Dec.  4    37\r\n       11    46\r\n       18    44\r\n       25    22\r\n  Jan.  1    35\r\n        8    33\r\n       15    28\r\n       22    20\r\n       29    18\r\n  Feb.  5    27\r\n       12    11\r\n       19    26\r\n       26    28\r\n  Mar.  5    10\r\n       12    10\r\n       19     9\r\n       26    13\r\n  Apr.  2     9\r\n        9     9\r\n\r\nThe unusually large mortalities from measles in 1718-19 and in 1733 were\r\nagain associated with a “constitution” otherwise sickly. The epidemic in\r\nthe latter year, from the middle of March to the end of July, which had a\r\nmaximum of 47 deaths in each of the two middle weeks of May, followed\r\nclose upon a severe influenza. Like the epidemic of 1674, it was attended\r\nby a high mortality from other causes, especially “convulsions” and\r\n“consumption”; and, as the bills had now begun to give the ages at death,\r\nit is no longer doubtful, or merely conjectural, that the great excess of\r\ndeaths under these and other heads was really among infants, or that a\r\nrise in “consumption” at that time of the year meant an increase in the\r\nwasting diseases of infancy. This was a period when any epidemic malady\r\namong London children was sure to go hard with many of them, the period,\r\nnamely, when spirit drinking, besides ruining the health of the parents,\r\nrendered them, in the opinion of the College of Physicians, “too often the\r\ncause of weak, feeble and distempered children[1194].”\r\n\r\nThe intervals between epidemics of measles in London having been so\r\nconsiderable as the table shows, it is not surprising to find but casual\r\nmention of the disease in the chronicles of Wintringham, Hillary, and\r\nHuxham for England, of Rogers, O’Connell and Rutty for Ireland, and of the\r\nEdinburgh annalists. Wintringham, of York, whose annals extend from 1715\r\nto 1730, records an epidemic of measles in 1721, which began in April and\r\nlasted all the summer, being for the most part of a bad type, attended\r\nwith continual cough and inflammation of the lungs. Hillary, of Ripon,\r\nenters measles in 1726, “very common but mild,” autumn and winter being\r\nthe season of it. Wintringham briefly mentions the same epidemic. Huxham\r\nof Plymouth has an entry of measles in the first year of his annals, 1727,\r\nin the month of July, followed by whooping-cough in December. Wintringham\r\nagain enters measles at York in 1730 in the company of smallpox. In the\r\nannual accounts of the disease at Edinburgh, for a series of years\r\nbeginning with 1731, measles is first mentioned in 1735[1195]. The\r\nepidemic began in June and became universal in December: “The progress of\r\nthese measles along the west road of England towards Edinburgh was very\r\nremarkable, for they could be traced from village to village; and it was\r\nsingular that the first person in Edinburgh who was seized with them was a\r\nlady in childbed, who saw nobody but her nurse and a friend who lived in\r\nthe house with her”--an argument, apparently, for the doctrine of an\r\nepidemic “morbillous” constitution of the air. Five years after, we obtain\r\nthe mortality statistics of Edinburgh, in the two great years of scarcity,\r\ntyphus fever and sicknesses of all kinds, the years 1740 and 1741: in\r\nthose two years measles must have been as general as smallpox if it were\r\nhalf as mortal, for the deaths set down to it in each year are 110 and\r\n112, as compared with 274 and 206 from the more usual infantile infection.\r\nIn like manner the second year of the disastrous epidemic of typhus in\r\n1741-42, had the highest total of measles deaths in London until the great\r\nepidemic of 1808. While the high mortality of that year was due to special\r\ncauses, it is at the same time clear from the following table that measles\r\nhad not yet become a steady or perennial cause of death to the infancy of\r\nthe capital:\r\n\r\n  Year      Measles\r\n            deaths\r\n\r\n  1741        42\r\n  1742       981\r\n  1743        17\r\n  1744         5\r\n  1745        14\r\n  1746       250\r\n  1747        81\r\n  1748        10\r\n  1749       106\r\n  1750       321\r\n  1751        21\r\n  1752       111\r\n  1753       253\r\n  1754        12\r\n  1755       423\r\n  1756       156\r\n  1757        24\r\n  1758       696\r\n  1759       316\r\n  1760       175\r\n  1761       394\r\n  1762       122\r\n  1763       610\r\n  1764        65\r\n  1765        54\r\n  1766       482\r\n  1767        80\r\n  1768       409\r\n  1769        90\r\n  1770       325\r\n  1771       115\r\n  1772       211\r\n  1773       199\r\n  1774       121\r\n  1775       283\r\n  1776       153\r\n  1777       145\r\n  1778       388\r\n  1779        99\r\n  1780       272\r\n  1781       201\r\n  1782       170\r\n  1783       185\r\n  1784        29\r\n  1785        20\r\n  1786       793[1196]\r\n  1787        84\r\n  1788        55\r\n  1789       534\r\n  1790       119\r\n  1791       156\r\n  1792       450\r\n  1793       248\r\n  1794       172\r\n  1795       328\r\n  1796       307\r\n  1797       222\r\n  1798       196\r\n  1799       223\r\n  1800       395\r\n\r\nThe considerable epidemic of 1755 is thus referred to by Fothergill in his\r\nmonthly notes:\r\n\r\n    _May_: the measles more common than for some years, adults, who had\r\n    not before had it, rarely escaping. _June_: measles common, smallpox\r\n    rare. _September and October_: no epidemic disease but measles; few\r\n    perished in proportion to all who took it[1197]. The epidemic of 1758\r\n    was more fatal, but Fothergill’s notes are not continued to that year.\r\n    The elder Heberden says that measles was remarkably epidemical (in\r\n    London) in 1753, which year has only 253 deaths in the bills, whereas\r\n    the year 1755 has 423 deaths and the year 1758 has 696; but, as he\r\n    implies that the type was mild, there would have been a multitude of\r\n    cases to produce that number of deaths. It was a peculiarity of that\r\n    epidemic, he says, that the cough preceded the outbreak of measles by\r\n    seven or eight days, whereas it was usually but two or three days in\r\n    advance of the eruption[1198].\r\n\r\nAt that period there would have been an epidemic of measles in London\r\nevery other year, or once in three years, with a fatality from the direct\r\neffects seldom more than a sixth part that of an epidemic of smallpox. A\r\nLondon writer some twenty years after said that few escaped measles in\r\ninfancy or childhood, while the deaths put down to it were only a tenth\r\npart of those due to smallpox on an average of years[1199]. The proportion\r\nof measles deaths to smallpox deaths was nearly the same in Manchester for\r\ntwenty years from 1754 to 1774, according to Percival’s table of the\r\nburials in the register of the Collegiate Church where most of the poorer\r\nclass were buried[1200]:\r\n\r\n    _Annual averages of Burials from Measles etc. at the Collegiate\r\n    Church, Manchester._\r\n\r\n                                          All deaths  Deaths at\r\n        Period        Measles   Smallpox   under two   all ages   Baptisms\r\n\r\n        1754-58         21         64         209         651        678\r\n        1759-63[1201]   10·6       95         213         639        731\r\n        1764-69          9·6       98         229         659        827\r\n        1770-74         21·6      102         242         651       1062\r\n\r\n    The ages of those who died of measles “in six years from 1768 to\r\n    1774,” to the number of 91, were as follows:\r\n\r\n        Total  3 mo.  -6 mo.  -12 mo.  -2 years  -3  -4  -5  -10  -20  -30\r\n\r\n          91    2       3       10        31     25   7   9   2    1    1\r\n\r\n    Fifty were males, forty-one females--a preponderance of males which is\r\n    according to rule. Of the whole ninety-one, no fewer than fifty-one\r\n    died in June of the several years.\r\n\r\n    In the smaller and more healthy towns, such as Northampton, the\r\n    epidemics of measles came at long intervals and caused but few deaths:\r\n\r\n    _Infantile Causes of Death, All Saints, Northampton_[1202].\r\n\r\n        Year  Measles   Whooping-cough  Convulsions  Teething\r\n\r\n        1742     3           1              10          8\r\n        1743    --          --              21          2\r\n        1744    --           3              14          4\r\n        1745    --          --              22          7\r\n        1746    --           3              19          3\r\n        1747     7          --              29         --\r\n        1748    --          --              24          4\r\n        1749    --           6              15          4\r\n        1750     1          --              17          1\r\n        1751    --          --              14          6\r\n        1752    --           1              13          6\r\n        1753} not published\r\n        1754}\r\n        1755    --           1               8          1\r\n        1756    --           2              10          2\r\n        1757     1           1              28          4\r\n\r\n    In the parish of Holy Cross, a suburb of Shrewsbury, there were 4\r\n    deaths from measles in the ten years 1750-60, and 15 in the ten years\r\n    1760-70, the smallpox deaths having been respectively 33 and 46.\r\n    Ackworth, in Yorkshire, may represent the country parishes. It had no\r\n    deaths from measles from 1747 to 1757, two deaths from 1757 to 1767.\r\n    At Kilmarnock during thirty-six years from 1728 to 1764, there were 93\r\n    deaths from measles, 52 of them in the period 1747-52, and only 11 in\r\n    the next twelve years. Sims, of Tyrone, having described an epidemic\r\n    of smallpox which desolated the close of 1766 and spring of 1767 with\r\n    unheard of havoc (it had been out of the country for some years),\r\n    mentions farther that an epidemic of measles followed immediately:\r\n    “Before the close of the summer solstice the measles sprang up with a\r\n    most luxuriant growth,” and was followed in harvest by whooping-cough.\r\n\r\nWherever we have the means of comparison by figures, it appears that\r\nmeasles caused by its direct fatality not more than a sixth part of the\r\ndeaths by smallpox in Britain generally. But in the colonies, where an\r\nepidemic of smallpox was a rare event of the great seaports, and as much\r\nan affair of adults as of children, measles seems to have been more fatal,\r\ndividing with diphtheria or scarlatina the great bulk of the infectious\r\nmortality of childhood. Thus Webster enters under 1772: “In this year the\r\nmeasles appeared in all parts of America with unusual mortality. In\r\nCharleston died 800 or 900 children”; and under 1773: “In America the\r\nmeasles finished its course and was followed by disorders in the\r\nthroat”--especially in 1775[1203]. It is only among the children of\r\npublic institutions in England that we find in the corresponding period a\r\nsimilar predominance of measles and scarlatina over smallpox. In the\r\nInfirmary Books of the Foundling Hospital the more general outbreaks of\r\nsmallpox cease after 1765, while epidemics of measles, extending to\r\nperhaps a third or more of the inmates, as well as great epidemics of\r\nscarlatina, begin after that date to be common[1204].\r\n\r\n    In the Infirmary Book from which the following extracts are taken, the\r\n    number of deaths is not stated. The number of children in the Hospital\r\n    was 312 in 1763, 368 in 1766 and 438 in 1768.\r\n\r\n    1763. Before the date of the Infirmary Book, Watson records an\r\n    epidemic of putrid measles from 21 April to 9 June, 1763, which\r\n    attacked 180 and caused 19 immediate deaths.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 19. Nine in the infirmary with “morbillous fever”; many cases of\r\n    “fever” until the 17th December.\r\n\r\n    1766. May to July. Many entries in the book; Watson says:\r\n    “Seventy-four had benign measles, and all recovered.”\r\n\r\n    1768. Great epidemic, May to July; one hundred and twelve in the\r\n    infirmary with measles on June 4th; Watson gives the total cases at\r\n    139, of which 6 were fatal.\r\n\r\n    1773. Nov. and Dec. Great epidemic: maximum of 130 cases of measles in\r\n    the infirmary on 27th November. Next week there were 40 with measles,\r\n    and 90 convalescing therefrom.\r\n\r\n    1774. May. A slight outbreak (8 cases at one time).\r\n\r\n    (_Records from 1776-1782 not seen._)\r\n\r\n    1783. March and April. Great epidemic: maximum number of cases in the\r\n    infirmary with measles 94, on March 22nd.\r\n\r\n    1784. June. Eleven cases of measles at once.\r\n\r\n    1786. March and April. Maximum on April 5th--measles 47, recovering\r\n    from measles 19.\r\n\r\n    The records from 1789 to 1805 have not been seen, but Willan gives the\r\n    following dates and numbers, on the information of Dr Stanger,\r\n    physician to the charity[1205].\r\n\r\n    1794. 28 had measles, all recovered.\r\n\r\n    1798. 69 had measles, 6 girls died.\r\n\r\n    1800. 66 had measles, 4 boys died.\r\n\r\n    1802. 8 had measles, one died.\r\n\r\nThe general testimony in the last quarter of the 18th century is that\r\nmeasles, if a common affection, was not usually a severe one. Heysham, of\r\nCarlisle, says that measles came thither in 1786 from the south-west of\r\nNorthumberland, “where, I am informed, they proved very fatal”; the\r\nepidemic began at Carlisle in August, and continued very general until\r\nJanuary, 1787, but extremely mild and favourable, only 28 having died (26\r\nunder five years, 2 from five to ten), out of “some six or seven hundred,\r\nI suppose.” The previous epidemic of measles at Carlisle in 1780\r\n(mortality not stated), had followed a most fatal epidemic of smallpox in\r\n1779; and although the epidemic of mild measles in 1786 did not follow a\r\ngreat epidemic of smallpox, it followed a high and steady annual average\r\nof deaths of infants and young children from that cause year after\r\nyear[1206]. In both years of the measles at Carlisle, there were no deaths\r\nfrom smallpox. In like manner at Leeds, in 1790, measles followed\r\nsmallpox, and was extremely mild; Lucas wrote of it, “I have not seen one\r\ninstance of a fatal termination[1207].” This was the time (1785) when\r\nHeberden said of the disease in London, just as Willis, Harris and others\r\nhad said of it and of smallpox together a century before: “The measles\r\nbeing usually attended with very little danger, it is not often that a\r\nphysician is employed in this distemper.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIncreasing mortality from Measles at the end of the 18th century.\r\n\r\nThere were epidemics of measles with high mortality in the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies, occurring in special circumstances of time and place, of which\r\ninstances have been given. But in general the position of measles was not\r\nthen so high among the causes of death in infancy and childhood as it\r\nafterwards became. It is not easy to demonstrate the exact proportions by\r\nfigures, even for London; the bills of the Parish Clerks are less\r\ntrustworthy for measles than for smallpox, for the reason that deaths from\r\nscarlatina were probably included among the former (see under Scarlatina).\r\nFor example, the ratio of 1·10 per cent. measles deaths for the ten years\r\n1781-90 in the following table should be only 0·70 if the 793 deaths in\r\n1786, supposed scarlatinal, be left out. But, taking the bills as they\r\nstand, they show an increasing ratio of measles (as well as of\r\nwhooping-cough) among the deaths from all causes towards the end of the\r\n18th century.\r\n\r\n_Percentage of Measles and Whooping-cough in all London deaths,\r\n1731-1830._\r\n\r\n  Ten-year     Share of       Share of\r\n  periods      measles     whooping-cough\r\n\r\n  1731-40        0·70         0·41\r\n  1741-50        0·68         0·40\r\n  1751-60        1·15         1·03\r\n  1761-70        1·11         1·12\r\n  1771-80        0·93         1·66\r\n  1781-90        1·10         1·32\r\n  1791-1800      1·34         1·97\r\n  1801-10        3·11         3·14\r\n  1811-20        3·52         3·49\r\n  1821-30        3·17         3·13\r\n\r\nDuring the same period, the ratio of deaths from all causes under two\r\nyears of age had decreased, while the ratio of deaths from two to five,\r\nand at all ages above five, had increased as in the following table, also\r\ncompiled from the London bills beginning with the year 1728 when the ages\r\nat death were first published.\r\n\r\n_Ratios of Deaths from all causes under two years, from two to five, and\r\nabove five, London, 1728-1830._\r\n\r\n                                Ratio       Ratio      Ratio of\r\n                     Total      under       from       all ages\r\n  Period             deaths   Two years  Two to Five  above Five\r\n\r\n  1728-30 (3 yrs.)   84,293      36·7        8·7         54·6\r\n  1731-40           246,925      38·6        8·9         52·5\r\n  1741-50           254,717      33·6        7·9         58·5\r\n  1751-60           204,617      30·9        9·3         59·8\r\n  1761-70           234,412      34·1        9·1         56·8\r\n  1771-80           214,605      34·4        9·6         56·0\r\n  1781-90           192,690      32·5        9·5         58·0\r\n  1791-1800         196,801      31·8       10·9         57·3\r\n  1801-10           185,823      29·3       11·5         59·2\r\n  1811-20           190,768      27·7        9·8         62·5\r\n  1821-30           209,094      28·0        9·7         62·3\r\n\r\nThus, while measles (with whooping-cough) was usurping, so to speak, a\r\nlarger share of all the deaths, the two first years of life were claiming\r\na smaller share of the deaths from all causes as the probability of life\r\nwas improving. The saving of infant life was due to various things, but\r\nespecially due to the decline of smallpox, as described in another\r\nchapter. We may now turn to consider, by a less abstract method, the\r\nincrease of measles mortality from the last years of the 18th century.\r\n\r\nIn Willan’s periodical reports of the prevailing diseases of London[1208],\r\nscarlatina declined in 1795 and became sporadic, after having been\r\nextremely fatal for a long period, while measles and smallpox began to\r\nextend about the end of that year, the former being for the most part mild\r\nin its symptoms and favourable in its termination, the latter often\r\nconfluent, and fatal to children. The report for March and April, 1796, is\r\nthat measles had become more severe, and had been followed by obstinate\r\ncoughs; for May, that “smallpox and measles have prevailed more during\r\nthis spring than has been known for many years past.” However, it was\r\nsmallpox that occasioned the larger share of the deaths among infants and\r\nchildren. The next general view that Willan gives us of the relative\r\nimportance of measles among the infectious diseases is under Oct.-Nov.\r\n1799: “The measles, though extensively diffused, have continued mild and\r\nmoderate. The scarlet fever has increased, since the last report, both in\r\nextent and in the violence of its symptoms; but the contagious malignant\r\nfever [typhus] has been the most frequent, as well as the most fatal, of\r\nall acute diseases.” There is little sign of fatal measles in the London\r\nbills during the years of distress, 1799-1801; but we hear of it in\r\nScotland and Ireland, where there was probably less scarlatina. An\r\nEdinburgh observer of the prevailing diseases says that “several hundreds”\r\ndied of measles there in the winter of 1799[1209]. In the Irish emigration\r\nto America, which took one of its periodic starts owing to the repressive\r\nmeasures following the rebellion of 1798 and the union with England,\r\nmeasles appears to have been the fatal form of infection among the\r\nchildren on board ship. A medical letter from Philadelphia, 10 December,\r\n1801, says that measles had been imported to Newcastle and Wilmington in\r\nthe summer of 1801 by some vessels from Ireland, on board which a great\r\nmany children died during the voyage; the epidemic at length reached\r\nPhiladelphia and had become general throughout the city[1210]. At\r\nWhitehaven large numbers of infants were attended in measles from the\r\nDispensary in 1796 and 1799, but the deaths (2 in 202 cases, and 2 in 266\r\ncases) are probably only a few that came to the knowledge of the visiting\r\nphysician. An epidemic at Uxbridge, Middlesex, in the winter of 1801-2 was\r\ncertainly malignant or fatal more than ordinary, whatever its anomalous\r\ntype may have meant.\r\n\r\n    The epidemic began in September, and was at first of so mild a type as\r\n    to need no medical assistance. Towards November the cases increased in\r\n    number and severity, but still, says the narrator, “I believe every\r\n    case terminated favourably, not in my practice only, but in that of\r\n    other gentlemen also.” Towards the middle of November, the attacks\r\n    were more sudden and more violent while they lasted, and were soon\r\n    over either in death or recovery. In some the eyes became all at once\r\n    as red as blood, the pulse full, quick and hard, the cough incessant,\r\n    with a rattling noise in the throat and quick laboured breathing, the\r\n    skin hot and parched. “Another peculiarity in this epidemic was that\r\n    the cuticle in many children did not separate after the disappearance\r\n    of the eruption, and in several others that I particularly noticed, it\r\n    came off in large flakes instead of branny scales; and the appearance\r\n    of the rash in others assumed so striking a resemblance to the scarlet\r\n    fever that, had it not been for the violent cough and other measly\r\n    symptoms, many such cases occurring singly might, upon a superficial\r\n    view, have been considered and treated as that disorder.” The various\r\n    forms occurred in the same family; thus, of four children, one had\r\n    typical measles, ending in a branny scurf, two others had the sneezing\r\n    and the watery inflamed eyes, but the eruption in the form of an\r\n    universal red fiery rash, after which the skin peeled in large flakes,\r\n    while the fourth had the disease of a low typhoid type and recovered\r\n    with difficulty. The epidemic “continued its destructive career”\r\n    through December and January, after which the type became as mild as\r\n    it had been at first. If the author had not discussed the diagnosis as\r\n    between measles and scarlatina, deciding in favour of the former, one\r\n    might have suspected that there were cases of both. But even the\r\n    sphacelation that followed the application of blisters, the\r\n    pemphigus-like eruption turning gangrenous, and the petechiae, were\r\n    signs of malignancy in more than one of the exanthematous fevers. The\r\n    sequelae of this epidemic of measles were as anomalous as the symptoms\r\n    themselves; instead of the inflamed eyes, and the distressing cough\r\n    (sometimes ending in consumption) there were aphthous fever and\r\n    dysenteric purging[1211].\r\n\r\nThe deaths in the London bills for the first twelve years of the century\r\nwill be found in the table on p. 655. We find the measles deaths for the\r\nfirst time equalling the smallpox deaths in 1804, and in 1808 surpassing\r\nthem, and we may take it that the deaths so entered were almost wholly of\r\nmeasles proper. The epidemic of measles in 1807-8 was, in fact, a great\r\nand clearly defined event in British epidemiology, the first of a series\r\nof epidemics in which that disease established not only its equality with\r\nsmallpox as a cause of infantile deaths but even its supremacy over the\r\nlatter. It would appear, also, to have been more malignant than the\r\nscarlatina that coexisted with it. Thus, Bateman, of London, at the outset\r\nof the great measles epidemic of 1807-8, says: “The most prominent acute\r\ndisorders have been eruptive fevers and particularly the measles, which\r\nduring October and November have been very prevalent, and, when occurring\r\nin young children, have proved very fatal by terminating in violent\r\ninflammation of the organs of respiration.... The scarlatina was generally\r\nmild, presenting the eruption with a slight sore-throat[1212].”\r\n\r\nOther accounts of the epidemic in London show it to have been of the type\r\nwhich Sydenham, in 1674, called anomalous or malignant.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic began in October-November, 1807, and was remarked as\r\nunusually fatal[1213].\r\n\r\n    Several children in the same family had fallen victims to it. Some\r\n    cases were fatal in a few days, either from the intensity of the fever\r\n    or from pneumonic complication. “But when these symptoms have been\r\n    less violent, and the patient has passed without much alarm through\r\n    the different stages of the disorder, and even after all apprehension\r\n    of danger in the mind of parents or friends has been dismissed, a\r\n    continuance or recurrence of pneumonic symptoms has laid a foundation\r\n    for phthisis pulmonalis.” In some cases attended from the Westminster\r\n    Dispensary, death followed from effusion into the chest or from\r\n    membranous inflammation of the trachea. Numbers who recovered from the\r\n    measles were afterwards affected with debility, cough, emaciation and\r\n    oedematous swellings of the face and extremities which proved very\r\n    difficult to remove. These particulars are given mostly for the end of\r\n    1807, but it is under the year 1808 that the great rise in the measles\r\n    deaths appears in the London bills of mortality.\r\n\r\nBesides these accounts for London, we have some details of the same\r\nepidemic at Edinburgh and Aberdeen and exact figures for Glasgow. It began\r\nat Edinburgh in the winter of 1807, and at Aberdeen (as at Glasgow) in the\r\nspring of 1808. At both places it was remarked as unusually fatal, chiefly\r\nfrom a complication of bowel complaint in children and from pulmonary\r\naffections in adults.\r\n\r\n    The Aberdeen observer says that in town (the disease being milder in\r\n    the country) there were troublesome symptoms in almost every case--a\r\n    violent pain in the belly, frequently accompanied with diarrhoea (and\r\n    even with vomiting), and with the dysenteric symptoms of tenesmus and\r\n    mucus in the stools. This bowel complaint usually lasted three or four\r\n    days, and wasted the patients remarkably. There was also the usual\r\n    catarrh with violent tickling cough, and, after the acute attack, a\r\n    tendency to sudden dyspnoea and “fatal coughs.” In some the\r\n    convalescence was lingering and very distressing to the patient: “it\r\n    consists in a slow kind of fever, with evening exacerbations[1214].”\r\n\r\nThe observers at Edinburgh and Aberdeen agree that the epidemic was the\r\nworst that had been seen for many years. Says the former[1215]: “I believe\r\nthat the present epidemic has been more general in this place and its\r\nvicinity than ever happened within the remembrance of any medical man at\r\npresent living, and I am sorry to say it has been very fatal.” The\r\nAberdeen chronicler says the mortality was “greater than we have witnessed\r\nfor a long period,” and that the epidemic was general throughout the whole\r\nof England and Scotland. But, besides this direct testimony, there is a\r\nnot less indirectly significant fact of the epidemic. It affected many\r\nadults--“persons of all ages, who had never had them,” says the Aberdeen\r\nwriter: few persons escaped, says the Edinburgh observer, “who had been\r\npreviously unaffected by this disease.” The deaths from pulmonic\r\ncomplaints did not often happen among children, but among people somewhat\r\nadvanced in life. Significant also was the outbreak in the Invernessshire\r\nMilitia, which marched into Edinburgh in March while the epidemic was\r\nraging. Fifty men, all young recruits newly joined, were attacked in the\r\ncourse of a few days, the others escaping the disease though equally\r\nexposed to it; in some of those who died in the regiment there were found,\r\non opening the thorax, fibrinous pleurisy and pericarditis, with effusion\r\nof fluid, as well as evidences of bronchial catarrh[1216]. The Aberdeen\r\nwriter says: “I always observed that in full-grown persons the eruptions\r\nwere more numerous, quicker in appearing, and longer in going off than in\r\nyoung subjects.... Many full-grown persons were very ill, yet the measles\r\nwere more fatal to the young.” The implication of so many adults in the\r\nsevere epidemic of 1808 would of itself show that measles had not been for\r\nsome time before a steady and universal affection of infancy and\r\nchildhood[1217].\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasles in Glasgow in 1808 and 1811-12: Researches of Watt.\r\n\r\nThe measles epidemic of 1808, which appears to have been somewhat general\r\nin England and Scotland, made an extraordinary impression in Glasgow. That\r\ndisease had never before been nearly so mortal there, nor had any\r\ninfection since the time of the plague, not even smallpox itself,\r\nengrossed the burial registers so much as measles did in the months of May\r\nand June, 1808. Glasgow had been the worst city in the kingdom for\r\nsmallpox; by a somewhat sudden transition the infancy of the city died for\r\na few months in larger numbers by the new disease than by the old. The\r\nhighest monthly mortalities from smallpox had been 114 in October and 113\r\nin November, 1791, the population being 66,578; but in 1808, the\r\npopulation having increased to 100,749 by the census of 1811, measles\r\ncarried off 259 children in May and 260 in June, and in the months before\r\nand after as follows:\r\n\r\n_Measles in Glasgow, 1808._\r\n\r\n  Month     Deaths\r\n\r\n  Jan.         2\r\n  Feb.         2\r\n  March        5\r\n  April       71\r\n  May        259\r\n  June       260\r\n  July       118\r\n  Aug.        32\r\n  Sept.       22\r\n  Oct.        10\r\n  Nov.         4\r\n  Dec.         2\r\n\r\nThe figures were not known at the time; but every doctor in Glasgow, as\r\nwell as the whole populace, knew that measles was cutting off the infants,\r\nwhile smallpox had fallen to insignificance. So dramatic was this turn in\r\nthe public health that the common people set it down to the new practice\r\nof inoculating children with cowpox: ready to believe anything of\r\nvaccination, they concluded that, if it kept off smallpox, it brought on\r\nmeasles. Dr Robert Watt took the trouble to refute this singular notion;\r\nhe found in his own practice that three children in one family, and in\r\nanother two, had died of measles who had neither been vaccinated nor had\r\nsmallpox before. Another great epidemic of measles arose in Glasgow three\r\nyears after, in the winter of 1811-12:\r\n\r\n             Measles\r\n  1811       deaths\r\n\r\n  October      12\r\n  November     76\r\n  December    161\r\n\r\n  1812\r\n\r\n  January     130\r\n  February     61\r\n  March        30\r\n  April        19\r\n  May          15\r\n  June         18\r\n\r\nThose two great epidemics of measles in Glasgow, in 1808 and 1811-12, were\r\nthe occasion of one of the earliest and most memorable inquiries in vital\r\nstatistics in this country, the research by Dr Robert Watt on “the\r\nRelative Mortality of the Principal Diseases of Children, and the numbers\r\nwho have died under ten years of age in Glasgow during the last thirty\r\nyears[1218].” Having begun with a search of the principal Glasgow\r\nburial-registers for deaths by whooping-cough, he extended it to sixteen\r\nfolio volumes of the registers of all the burial-grounds, old and new, and\r\nincluded the mortalities from all causes with the ages at death, and from\r\nfevers and the principal diseases of infancy and childhood. The increase\r\nof population from 1783, when his figures begin, to 1812, the date of his\r\nwriting, was known to him; but as the numbers living at the respective\r\nperiods of life were not known, he was obliged to state the change in the\r\nmortalities at the various ages, and from the various diseases, in ratios\r\nof the annual deaths from all causes,--a perfectly scientific comparison\r\nso long as the nature of the ratios compared was clearly stated. It would\r\nhave been more satisfactory, of course, if the comparison could have been\r\nmade in terms of the annual death-rate, which was much lower (for reasons\r\nalready explained), in the second half of his period than in the first;\r\nbut, in the circumstances, that was impracticable, and Watt did the next\r\nbest thing.

At\r\nthe same time smallpox had almost ceased (but only temporarily, as it\r\nappeared) to be the great infectious scourge of infancy, while measles had\r\ncome in its place. “Now that the smallpox are in great measure expelled,”\r\n(Watt believed that cowpox inoculation had done this), “the measles are\r\ngradually coming to occupy the same ground which they formerly occupied. I\r\nam sorry to make this statement, but the facts, at least with regard to\r\nGlasgow, are too strong to admit of doubt.”\r\n\r\n    In order to explain the enormous increase of deaths by measles, he had\r\n    recourse to the following argument. Formerly nearly all children, say\r\n    nine-tenths, had both smallpox and measles, the attack of smallpox in\r\n    most cases coming first. Children who had survived smallpox were\r\n    fortified by that ordeal, not merely as selected lives, but\r\n    positively fortified, so that measles, when it assailed them in due\r\n    time afterwards, was taken mildly or was “modified,” not one in a\r\n    hundred cases proving fatal. But now (1813), when so few children have\r\n    been through the smallpox, measles has become ten times more fatal to\r\n    them, although it could hardly be more common than it used to be.\r\n    Having found it necessary to assume that children in former times took\r\n    smallpox before they took measles, nine-tenths of them taking both, he\r\n    qualifies this in another passage: “Still, however, as the measles\r\n    came round now and then, as a very general epidemic, they must\r\n    occasionally have had the precedence, and it was perhaps chiefly among\r\n    such patients that the disease proved fatal.”\r\n\r\n    The measles which came round now and then as a general epidemic was\r\n    nearly the whole of it; even in London there were intervals of several\r\n    years with only a few annual deaths, and in smaller towns or country\r\n    districts the clear intervals were longer. The prevalence of measles\r\n    on the great scale being more casual than that of smallpox, it is\r\n    likely that most children had taken smallpox before they incurred\r\n    measles. But it is clear from such instances as the London epidemic of\r\n    1674, and the epidemic in the Foundling Hospital in 1763, that measles\r\n    might attack children just before smallpox, and by its weakening\r\n    effects, increase the number of victims of the latter. As to the\r\n    fatality of measles itself in the 17th and 18th centuries, the\r\n    statement of Watt that it did not amount to one death in a hundred\r\n    attacks, while it can neither be proved nor disproved by an array of\r\n    figures, can be shown to be inconsistent with the language of\r\n    annalists. The epidemics of measles varied in severity then as\r\n    afterwards: that of 1670 in London was regular and mild, that of 1674\r\n    in the very same months of the year was anomalous and fatal; Huxham\r\n    characterizes the measles at Plymouth in the winter of 1749-50 as\r\n    “maximé epidemici, imo et saepe pestiferi”; at Kidderminster, in 1756,\r\n    after fevers had been very fatal to adults, the measles went through\r\n    the town so that an immense number of children “died tabid”; in the\r\n    West of England about 1760 a disease called measles made “a melancholy\r\n    carnage amongst children.”\r\n\r\nWhile Watt’s theory of the working of this principle of substitution is\r\nopen to criticism on some points of detail, the law itself, as enunciated\r\nby him, remains to the present time one of the soundest and most\r\ninstructive generalities in epidemiology. He based it upon a laborious\r\nsearch of the burial registers, such as no one before him in this country\r\nhad undertaken. Next he saw correctly that a great rise in the deaths of\r\ninfants by such a disease as measles could only be accounted for by a\r\ngreat increase in the rate of fatality. Thirdly, he connected the loss\r\nfrom measles with the saving from smallpox. Adopting an old opinion, which\r\nmay be discovered in Willis[1219], he argued that smallpox, when taken\r\nfirst, served to fortify children so that they passed easily through the\r\nmeasles afterwards; but in the following passage he indicated a better\r\nreason why the absence of smallpox gave measles the chance of proving more\r\nfatal: “In this point of view we are not to consider the smallpox as so\r\npeculiarly fatal in their nature. They perhaps prove so fatal merely by\r\nhaving the start of other diseases. The measles, the chincough, the croup,\r\nthe scarlet fever, and perhaps many others, would have proved equally\r\nfatal had they occurred first.” The principle is true to this extent, that\r\na certain proportion of weakly infants, or children of poor stamina, will\r\nsuccumb to almost any disease--if not to smallpox, then to measles, and if\r\nnot to measles directly, then to the sequelae of measles. This was\r\nperceived in the form of a necessary truth by Haygarth in 1793: “A\r\nconsiderable number of those who now die of the smallpox would die in\r\nchildhood of other diseases if this distemper were exterminated[1220].” It\r\nwas commonly believed that smallpox had at length found its real\r\nartificial check, not in the inoculation of itself, but in the inoculation\r\nof cowpox. At all events it had declined greatly in Glasgow. During the\r\nthree years before the measles epidemic of 1808, there could hardly have\r\nbeen more than a thousand children attacked by smallpox, or not one in ten\r\nof all the children born. During several years the infancy of the city had\r\nbeen spared any great ordeal of infectious disease; the first epidemic\r\nthat came along happened to be measles, so that it fell to that infection\r\nto take off the weaklings. In the economy of nature it is impossible to\r\nrear all the young of a species, nor would it be good for the species if\r\nit were possible. It is among the birds that the principle of population,\r\nor of the survival of the fittest, is seen working in the most admirable\r\nway: the annual migration of many species to breed in a remote country\r\nbrings with it an ordeal for the birds of the year in finding their way to\r\nthe winter feeding-grounds--an ordeal which only the strongest come\r\nthrough. For some unexplained reason, the young of the human species are\r\npeculiarly tried by infectious diseases, which multitudes pass through\r\nsafely, while many of poor stamina or of ill tending are cut off.\r\n\r\n    Dr Watt’s teaching, as to the displacement of one infectious cause of\r\n    death by another was resisted at the time as being of “evil tendency”\r\n    for the pretensions of vaccination, although Watt believed as firmly\r\n    in the virtues of cowpox as Jenner himself did. Writing to James Moore\r\n    on 6 Dec. 1813, Jenner says of Watt’s essay (Baron, II. 392): “There\r\n    is nothing in its title that developes its purport or _evil\r\n    tendency_.... Is not this very shocking? Here is a new and unexpected\r\n    twig shot forth for the sinking anti-vaccinist to cling to.” Sir\r\n    Gilbert Blane, who was then president of the Medical and Chirurgical\r\n    Society, having a natural fondness for ideas of all kinds expressed in\r\n    a paper to that society rather more approval of Watt’s view than was\r\n    thought prudent: “An ingenious friend of mine has remarked to me in\r\n    conversation that some light is thrown on this subject by considering\r\n    that whichever of the epidemic maladies attack children first, it will\r\n    be the most fatal, inasmuch as all feeble constitutions will fall in\r\n    its way while the stronger will be left to encounter the attacks of\r\n    the others; and that the smallpox, owing probably to the greater\r\n    abundance and rankness of their effluvia, are generally caught in a\r\n    casual way before measles, hooping cough and scarlet fever, and are\r\n    therefore reckoned more fatal than any of these. But, a new field of\r\n    research being opened,” etc. Efforts were made to correct the effect\r\n    of this, by showing that measles in some parts of the country had not\r\n    been more fatal than usual. Holland, of Knutsford, attributed the\r\n    fatality of the epidemic in 1808 to a change of the wind to the east.\r\n    Writers in the _Edinburgh Med. and Surg. Journal_, pointed out that\r\n    Watt had compared the absolute deaths by smallpox at one time and by\r\n    measles at another without taking account of the increase of\r\n    population, and the rates of mortality from each disease. The best\r\n    criticism of Watt was by Roberton in his _Mortality of Children_,\r\n    1827, p. 49. He offers the following considerations, without seeming\r\n    to know that they were really to be found in Watt’s own essay:\r\n    Smallpox used to be caught first; it swept off the feeble and sickly,\r\n    leaving the strong and vigorous _only_ to encounter the attacks of\r\n    other diseases. “That infectious febrile disease to which in early\r\n    infancy there is the strongest predisposition will of course in\r\n    general make the first attack and prove the most fatal of any.” There\r\n    were reasons why measles used to have comparatively few victims, “and\r\n    why, when they now prevail epidemically, they, as was the case with\r\n    smallpox, are caught at an earlier age than other diseases in general\r\n    and prove so very fatal: which happens not more from their priority in\r\n    attack than from being in their nature what they were ever\r\n    considered--a severe and dangerous disease. We are to recollect,\r\n    however, that measles do not in general attack at so early an age as\r\n    smallpox; nor ever, like the latter, destroy eight or nine-tenths of\r\n    all the children that die in the place where they happen to prevail,\r\n    as was the case in the variolous epidemics of Chester and Warrington\r\n    [this is an error, _vide supra_, p. 554]; consequently we have reason\r\n    to hope that neither measles nor any other infantile disease will, as\r\n    Dr Watt imagined, ‘come to occupy the place which smallpox once\r\n    occupied,’” (p. 58). A feeble echo of Roberton’s criticism, with all\r\n    its scientific candour left out and its points against Watt emphasized\r\n    in a spirit of paltry cavilling, was heard next year in the\r\n    Goulstonian Lectures of Bisset Hawkins on _Elements of Medical\r\n    Statistics_, 1829.\r\n\r\n    Many years after, when the enormous increase of deaths by scarlatina\r\n    was illustrating the doctrine of displacement in a new way, Dr Farr\r\n    gave a full analysis of Watt’s essay in his annual Letter to the\r\n    Registrar-General for the year 1867, and endorsed the Glasgow teaching\r\n    of 1813 with more heartiness than it had hitherto received. Although\r\n    Farr did not take the Malthusian view that the loss of weakly children\r\n    by one means or another was inevitable, yet he could not help seeing,\r\n    in his work upon the registration returns from 1837 onwards, that one\r\n    infection had been taking what another spared. He recurred to Watt’s\r\n    doctrine time after time in his annual reports, and in that of 1872\r\n    (p. 224), expressed his belief thus plainly: “The zymotic diseases\r\n    replace each other; and when one is rooted out, it is apt to be\r\n    replaced by others which ravage the human race indifferently whenever\r\n    the conditions of healthy life are wanting. They have this property in\r\n    common with weeds and other forms of life: as one species recedes,\r\n    another advances.”\r\n\r\nTwo remarks remain to be made under the doctrine of displacement. The\r\nfirst is that the substitution of measles for smallpox was one of a\r\nseries of such changes in the public health of Britain. The great\r\ninfective scourge of medieval and early modern periods had been plague,\r\nwhich destroyed at times immense numbers of the valuable or mature lives.\r\nIts successor was typhus fever, which also cut off the parents more than\r\nthe children, but did not retard population as the plague had done. The\r\nsaving of life by the extinction of plague was in great part balanced by\r\nthe loss from smallpox, which fell, however, more and more upon the\r\nearliest years of life until at length it was almost confined to them. The\r\nfirst great decline of smallpox itself corresponded to a great decline of\r\ntyphus fever during the second half of the French war; but while there was\r\nno great infectious disease in those years to thin the ranks of the\r\nadults, measles took the place of the more loathsome smallpox in cutting\r\noff a certain number of young lives. While the older types of infection\r\nhave disappeared, the incidence has shifted from mature lives to children,\r\nso much so that at the present time enteric fever, and occasional choleras\r\nand influenzas, are almost the only infections that correspond to the old\r\nplague and to typhus fever in their age-incidence.\r\n\r\nThe other remark is that the greater prevalence or fatality of measles, as\r\nif in lieu of smallpox, meant a good deal more for the bills of mortality\r\nthan actually appeared under the name of measles. Smallpox was not an\r\ninfection that did much constitutional damage to those that came through\r\nit, although it sometimes destroyed the vision and spoiled the beauty of\r\nthe face. On the contrary, it was held by many that the general health was\r\nbetter after an attack of smallpox than before; and, if personal\r\nexperience can justify an opinion, that ought to be my own view of the\r\nmatter[1221]. But measles is an infection peculiarly apt to leave mischief\r\nbehind. The bronchial catarrh, which is an integral part of the malady,\r\nand is often the cause of death in the second stage of the attack, may so\r\naffect weakly children that the respiratory organs are permanently\r\ndamaged. Tuberculosis of the lungs is apt to follow measles. Some\r\nchildren, again, fall into mesenteric disease after measles, and die\r\ntabid, the intestinal catarrh being as dangerous in one way as the\r\nbronchial is in another. Another large proportion of the subjects of\r\nmeasles take whooping-cough[1222]. While smallpox did its work summarily,\r\nthe full effects of measles were longer in being realized. This may in\r\npart explain the fact brought out by Watt, that while fewer children died\r\nunder two years of age, measles being the dominant epidemic disease, there\r\nwas an increase in the ratio of deaths from all causes between the years\r\nof two and five and from five to ten.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasles in the Period of Statistics.\r\n\r\nThe history of measles for nearly a generation after the great epidemics\r\nof 1808 and 1811-12 is little known. No one in Glasgow continued Watt’s\r\nlaborious tabulation of the causes of deaths in the numerous burial\r\nregisters[1223]; nor was any regular account kept elsewhere except by the\r\nParish Clerks of London. The following deaths by measles in their bills\r\nfrom 1813 to 1837, when the modern registration began, were probably no\r\nmore than from a third to a half of the deaths in all London:\r\n\r\n          Measles\r\n  Year    deaths\r\n\r\n  1813     550\r\n  1814     817\r\n  1815     711\r\n  1816    1106\r\n  1817     725\r\n  1818     728\r\n  1819     695\r\n  1820     720\r\n  1821     547\r\n  1822     712\r\n  1823     573\r\n  1824     966\r\n  1825     743\r\n  1826     774\r\n  1827     525\r\n  1828     736\r\n  1829     578\r\n  1830     479\r\n  1831     750\r\n  1832     675\r\n  1833     524\r\n  1834     528\r\n  1835     734\r\n  1836     404\r\n  1837     577\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of these figures to the whole of London will appear from\r\nthe fact that the registration returns under the new Act gave for the last\r\nsix months of 1837 the measles deaths at 1354, while the bills of the\r\nParish Clerks gave them at 577 for the whole year. But the old bills\r\nenable us to compare the deaths from different diseases within the same\r\narea and under the same system of collection, and to compare the deaths\r\n“within the bills” in a series of years since the last of the new parishes\r\nwere taken in about the middle of the 18th century. Using the bills so far\r\nlegitimately, we find that measles at length came to be of equal\r\nimportance with smallpox itself as a cause of death in childhood, and that\r\nit had become a larger and steadier total from year to year.\r\n\r\nSo far as concerns Glasgow, the high mortality from 1807 to 1812, making\r\n10·76 on an annual average of the deaths from all causes, was not\r\nmaintained. When the tabulation of the causes of death was resumed from\r\n1835, the annual average of measles for the five years ending 1839 was\r\nfound to be only 6 per cent. of the deaths from all causes, the average of\r\nsmallpox having come back to 5·3 per cent. During that unwholesome period,\r\nin which there was much distress among the working class and a great\r\nepidemic of typhus, measles and smallpox were dividing the infectious\r\nmortality of childhood somewhat equally, the age-incidence of measles\r\nbeing only a little lower than that of smallpox:\r\n\r\n_Ages of the Fatal Cases of Measles in Glasgow, 1835-39_[1224].\r\n\r\n        Under one  1-2  2-5  5-10  10-20  20-30  30-40  40-50  Total\r\n\r\n  1835      116    141  121   34    10      4      -      -     426\r\n  1836       86    209  183   38     1      1      -      -     518\r\n  1837       77    133  122   16     2      1                   350\r\n  1838       76    124  161   39     3      1      1            405\r\n  1839      165    259  275   73     7      2             1     783\r\n           --------------------------------------------------------\r\n            520    866  863  200    23      9      1      1    2482\r\n\r\nIn Limerick, which may stand for a typically unhealthy Irish city in the\r\nworst period of over-population, there were many more deaths from smallpox\r\namong children than from measles, the age-incidence being nearly the same,\r\naccording to the following dispensary statistics for a number of years\r\nbefore 1840[1225]:\r\n\r\n_Limerick Dispensary Deaths._\r\n\r\n              Age 0-5  5-10  10-15  15-20  Total\r\n\r\n  Smallpox      333     55     5      0     393\r\n  Measles       187     32     6      1     226\r\n  Scarlatina      8      2                   10\r\n\r\nAlthough it is impossible to prove it, yet the indications all point to\r\nmeasles having kept for a whole generation after 1808 the leading place\r\namong infantile causes of death which it then for the first time\r\ndefinitely took[1226]. Almost the only direct references to the subject\r\nwere made by way of controverting the doctrine of Watt; but these are too\r\nmeagre, or too general in their terms, to be of any use[1227]. The\r\nepidemics of measles seem to have travelled then, as they do now, from\r\ncounty to county in successive years. Thus in 1818, while most parts of\r\nEngland were or had recently been suffering from smallpox, the Eastern\r\ncounties were suffering from measles “very frequent and fatal.” Smallpox\r\nat length reached Norwich in 1819, and became the reigning epidemic in the\r\nplace of measles, which was “hardly met with” so long as the enormous\r\nmortality of the other disease proceeded[1228]. At Exeter in the spring of\r\n1824 measles became epidemic after a long interval; many susceptible\r\nchildren had accumulated, and of these few escaped. The mortality was very\r\ngreat, and was caused by severe pulmonary inflammation, the catarrhal\r\nsymptoms being mild. In one day seventeen children were buried in one of\r\nthe five parish churchyards of the city; but that high mortality,\r\naccording to the parochial surgeon, did not on an average stand for more\r\nthan four deaths in one hundred cases[1229].\r\n\r\nWhen the curtain rises, in the summer of 1837, upon the prevalence and\r\ndistribution of diseases in England, as ascertained by the new system of\r\nregistration of the causes of death, measles is found in the first place\r\namong the infectious maladies of childhood, thereafter yielding its place\r\nto smallpox for a year or more, and taking the lead again until it was\r\npassed by scarlatina.\r\n\r\n_Deaths by Measles and Smallpox in London, 1837-39._\r\n\r\n               1837                  1838                       1839\r\n          3rd Qr. 4th Qr.  1st Qr. 2nd Qr. 3rd Qr. 4th Qr.

In the same year measles took the lead in four\r\nout of six great English towns, scarlatina being the dominant infection in\r\none (Sheffield), and smallpox in one (Bradford):\r\n\r\n_Deaths in 1839 by the three chief infections of Childhood._\r\n\r\n              Liverpool  Manchester  Leeds  Birmingham  Sheffield  Bradford\r\n\r\n  Measles        401        773       383       170         33        70\r\n  Scarlatina     374        264        35       133        419         7\r\n  Smallpox       259        237       171        56         16       208\r\n\r\nIn all England and Wales during fully half-a-century of registration,\r\nmeasles has fluctuated somewhat from year to year but has not experienced\r\na notable decline among the causes of infantile mortality (see the table\r\nat p. 614). In the decennial period 1871-80, its annual average death-rate\r\nwas 377 per million living; in the next decennium it rose to 441, the\r\npreviously high rates of scarlatina having fallen greatly. Among the\r\nhighest rates for the ten years 1871-80, were those of Plymouth, 1·13 per\r\n1000, East Stonehouse 1·79, and Devonport 1·19 (owing to a great epidemic\r\nin 1879-80), Exeter, 0·82, Liverpool ·91, Bedwelty (Tredegar and\r\nAberystruth collieries) 0·88, Wigan 0·74, Whitehaven 0·71, Alverstoke\r\n0·81. In the most recent period there have been some very high\r\ndeath-rates; thus at Jarrow the annual rate, which was only ·27 per 1000\r\nfrom 1871 to 1880, rose in the nine years 1881 to 1889 to an annual\r\naverage of ·94, having been made up almost wholly by great epidemics every\r\nother year--in 1883 (2·9), 1885 (2·4), 1887 (1·4), and 1889 (·9)[1230]. In\r\nthe year 1888, an epidemic at Stoke-on-Trent, Hanley, &c. with 342 deaths,\r\nmade a rate of 2·8 for the year; in Wolstanton, Burslem, &c., 221 deaths\r\nwere equivalent to a rate of 2·6.\r\n\r\nThe latest reports of the Registrar-General have traced a progression of\r\nthe epidemic of measles from county to county or from district to district\r\nin successive years, such as was remarked, both for smallpox and measles,\r\nby some of the 18th century epidemiologists in England, Scotland and\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n    Thus in 1890, measles was epidemic in Cheshire, South Lancashire and\r\n    North Staffordshire; in 1891 it ceased in these, but became epidemic\r\n    in North Lancashire, South Staffordshire and the West Riding; in 1892\r\n    it ceased in its last-mentioned area, and became epidemic in\r\n    Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire, the East and North Ridings,\r\n    Westmoreland and Durham. During the same three years a similar\r\n    progression or cycle was observable (on looking over the tables) in\r\n    the South-west of England. The epidemic year of measles in Devonshire\r\n    was 1889. It ceased there, and became epidemic in 1890 in Cornwall on\r\n    the one side and in Somerset on the other, sparing Dorset. In 1891 it\r\n    ceased to be epidemic in those parts of Cornwall and Somerset which it\r\n    occupied in 1890, and became prevalent in the extreme west of\r\n    Cornwall, in parts of Somerset, in Wiltshire and in Gloucestershire.\r\n    In 1892 it ceased in all the last-mentioned excepting Gloucestershire,\r\n    and became epidemic in Dorset, where there had been no severe\r\n    prevalence of measles since 1888[1231].\r\n\r\nMeasles has no such decided preference for a season of the year as\r\nscarlatina and enteric fever have for autumn or infantile diarrhoea has\r\nfor summer. But it often happens that most deaths are recorded from May to\r\nJuly, owing, doubtless, to the greater number of attacks in summer and not\r\nto any excessive fatality of that season. In London and the great\r\nindustrial towns the deaths are spread somewhat uniformly over the year;\r\nor, in the language of statisticians, the maxima do not rise far above the\r\nmean of the year. In a tabulation of the weekly deaths in London from 1845\r\nto 1874[1232], it appears that they touch a higher point in mid-winter\r\n(Nov.-Jan.) than in summer, a fact which may be readily accounted for by\r\nthe injurious effects of the London air in winter upon a disease which is\r\nlargely a trouble of the respiratory organs. In the great industrial\r\npopulations of Lancashire, which resemble London in their high death-rate\r\nfrom measles, the rise of the deaths in mid-winter is almost the same as\r\nthe summer increase[1233].\r\n\r\nMost of the deaths from measles fall at present upon the ages from six\r\nmonths to three years, just as they did when the deaths were comparatively\r\nfew, as at Manchester from 1768 to 1774. Deaths of adults, which were not\r\naltogether rare in the first great epidemic of modern times in 1808, are\r\nseldom heard of at present, for the same reason that adult deaths used to\r\nbe uncommon in smallpox, namely, that the disease is passed by almost\r\neveryone in infancy or childhood. Although the deaths from measles\r\nsometimes reach large totals--in London during the spring of 1894 they\r\nwere in some weeks as high as one hundred and fifty--yet it is the common\r\nexperience of practitioners that a strong or healthy child rarely dies of\r\nmeasles, that the fatalities occur among the infants of weakly\r\nconstitution, and especially in the numerous families of the working class\r\nin the most populous centres of mining, manufactures and shipping.\r\n\r\nTo bring these various characteristics of measles together in a concrete\r\ninstance, I shall give briefly the facts of a recent epidemic in a town in\r\nScotland of some twelve thousand inhabitants. There had been only five\r\ndeaths from measles for two years. There had not been a case of smallpox\r\nfor at least ten years. The measles epidemic, when its triennial\r\nopportunity came, reached a height in July, on a certain day of which\r\nmonth there were seven or eight burials from measles or its direct\r\nsequelae. Nearly all the children in the place who had not been through\r\nthe measles in the corresponding epidemics of 1889 or 1887 suffered from\r\nit on this occasion, excepting the class of very young infants. The deaths\r\nin the whole epidemic numbered about fifty, which would not all be\r\nregistered, however, as from measles. Yet this high mortality was not due\r\nto any unusual malignancy of the disease, but to the feeble stamina of a\r\ncertain number of infants, or to the indifferent housing and tending of\r\nthe poorer class. One did not hear of a death in the well-to-do families\r\n(probably there was none), although they had their full share of attacks.\r\nThe frequency of the burials for a short time, and the effects of the\r\nepidemic on the mortality from first to last, must have been very nearly\r\nthe same as in an epidemic of smallpox a century before, when the\r\npopulation was only a third or fourth part as large. But in the period\r\nwhen smallpox was in the ascendant, having few rivals among the infective\r\ncauses of death in childhood, the general conditions of health in this\r\ntown were altogether different. One or two specimens of the thatched huts\r\nof the poorer class had been left standing into the era of photography, so\r\nthat we could compare past with present, in externals at least; also, of\r\nthe houses of the richer class some still remained, perhaps turned into\r\ntenement-houses, with small windows, low doorways, and crow steps on their\r\ngables; and it was on record by the parish minister at the end of the 18th\r\ncentury, that within the memory of that generation there had been peat\r\nstacks and dunghills before the doors on the High Street of the burgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nWHOOPING-COUGH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is singular that a malady so distinctively marked as whooping-cough is\r\nshould figure so little in the records of disease from former times.\r\nAstruc could find no traces of it in the medical writings of antiquity or\r\nof the Arabian period. In modern times the first known account of an\r\nepidemic of it is under the year 1578, when Baillou of Paris included a\r\nprevalent convulsive cough as part of the epidemic constitution of that\r\nyear, remarking in the same context that he knew of no author who had\r\nhitherto written of the malady[1234]. Yet, if whooping-cough had been as\r\ncommon in former times as it has been in quite recent times, it deserved a\r\nhigh place among the causes of infantile mortality. Doubtless it occurred\r\nin former times in the same circumstances in which it occurs now. Baillou\r\nin 1578 speaks of it as a familiar thing; and it can be shown from an\r\nEnglish prescription-book of the medieval period that remedies were in\r\nrequest for a malady called “the kink,” a name which survives in Scotland\r\n(like other obsolete English words of the 15th century) in the form of\r\n“kink host[1235].”\r\n\r\nIn Phaer’s _Booke of Children_ (1553) chincough is not named. It is\r\nperhaps more singular that the disease should be omitted from the list in\r\nSir Thomas Elyot’s _Castel of Health_ (1541), of maladies proper to three\r\nperiods of childhood; for that list has every appearance of being an\r\nexhaustive enumeration[1236]. Still, it would be erroneous to suppose that\r\nthe convulsive cough of children which is so common an epidemic incident\r\nin our time, and in some impressionable subjects is the almost necessary\r\nsequel of a coryza or catarrh, did not then occur in the same\r\ncircumstances as now. When Willis, in his _Pharmaceutice Rationalis_ of\r\n1674, remarks that pertussis was left to the management of old women and\r\nempirics, he suggests the real reason why so little is said of it in the\r\nmedical compends. Sydenham mentions it twice, and on both occasions in a\r\nsignificant context. Under the name of pertussis, “quem nostrates vocant\r\n_Hooping Cough_,” he brings it in at the end of his account of the measles\r\nepidemic of 1670, without actually saying that it was a sequel of the\r\nmeasles. His other reference to it, under the name of the convulsive cough\r\nof children, comes in his account of the influenza of 1679. In both\r\ncontexts it is adduced as an instance of a malady much more amenable to\r\nbloodletting than to pectoral remedies, the depletion being a sure means\r\nof cutting short an attack that was else very apt to be protracted, if not\r\naltogether uncontrollable[1237]. One glimpse of it we get among the\r\nchildren of a squire’s family in Rutlandshire in the summer of 1661. On\r\nthe 26th of May the mother of the children writes to her husband then on a\r\nvisit to London[1238]:\r\n\r\n    “I am in a sad condition for my pore children, who are all so trobled\r\n    with the chincofe that I am afraid it will kill them. There is many dy\r\n    out in this town, and many abroad that we heare of. I am fane to have\r\n    a candell stand by me to goo in too them when the fitt comes.” On 2\r\n    June, the children are still “all sadly trobeled with the chincofe.\r\n    Moll is much the worst. They have such fits that it stopes theare\r\n    wind, and puts me to such frits and feares that I am not myselfe.” In\r\n    a third letter, the children “are getting over the chincofe. I desire\r\n    a paper of lozenges for them”; and on 30 June, the children are\r\n    better, but the smallpox is still in the village. It was probably from\r\n    the latter disease that many were dying.\r\n\r\nIn Dr Walter Harris’s _Acute Diseases of Infants_[1239], the convulsive or\r\nsuffocative coughs are mentioned in one place without being identified as\r\nchincough, while in two or three other places the malady is briefly\r\nreferred to under its name. Thus, “corpulent and fat infants troubled with\r\ndefluxions, and having an open mould, are most subject to the rickets,\r\nchincough, king’s evil, and almost incurable thrushes.” Again, chincough\r\nof infants is one of the inflammatory diseases that are “not altogether\r\nfree from contagion”; and again: “Albeit that any notable translation of\r\nthe subject matter of the fever into the lungs, and chincoughs, do advise\r\nbloodletting for the youngest infants, yet it is most evident that it is\r\nnot a remedy naturally convenient for them.... And therefore its help is\r\nnot to be invoked for all the diseases of infants except in the chincough\r\nor any other coughs that do attend and are concomitants of fevers that do\r\nsuddenly begin”--showing his deference to Sydenham, his master.\r\n\r\nProbably the “any other coughs” are those that he thus describes in\r\nanother place (p. 26):\r\n\r\n    “Moreover he is often troubled with a slight, dry cough, though\r\n    sometimes it is strangling and suffocative: with a dry cough because\r\n    of the sharpness and acrimony of the humours that continually prickle\r\n    the most sensible branches of the windpipe; but the choaking doth\r\n    proceed from the abundance of serous and watry humours that so fill up\r\n    and burden the small vesicles of the lungs that it cannot be cast off\r\n    and discharged. But also they being endued with a great debility and\r\n    weakness of nerves, and a superlative softness and delicacy of\r\n    constitution, they are not able to subsist with that violent trouble\r\n    of coughing, but do succumb under that unnatural and excessive motion\r\n    of their breast, and their face is blackish as that of strangled\r\n    people.”\r\n\r\nThese were cases of whooping-cough, although they are not so called. Among\r\nhis eleven cases, Harris gives two in infants of the Marquis of Worcester;\r\none had been “very often troubled with an acute fever,” and was found to\r\nbe much weakened by a chincough when the physician was called to him; the\r\nother, an infant of eleven months, had at the same time an acute fever\r\n“and a cough almost convulsive.”\r\n\r\nThis inclusion, under the generic name of cough, of cases that had all the\r\nsigns of whooping-cough, namely, the paroxysmal seizures, choking fits,\r\nand blackness of the face, is found also in the London bills of mortality.\r\nAlthough “coughs” are entered as the cause of a not very large number of\r\ndeaths in the earlier annual bills, with an occasional special mention of\r\nwhooping-cough among them, it is not until 1701 that “hooping cough and\r\nchincough” becomes a separate item, with six deaths in the year; next year\r\nthe entry is “hooping cough” alone, with a single death, and so on for a\r\nnumber of years in which the deaths are counted by units; in 1716 they\r\nrise to eleven, and continue to be counted by tens until 1730, when 152\r\ndeaths are set down to “cough, chincough, and whooping-cough.” It would be\r\na mistake to suppose that these figures during the first thirty years of\r\nthe 18th century are anything like a correct measure of the number of\r\ninfants in London who suffered from whooping-cough, or are at all near the\r\nnumber who might have reasonably been returned as dying from it. It was in\r\nthat generation that the entries of the Parish Clerks became most\r\nindefinite as to the causes of death in infants, five-sixths of the\r\nenormous total of deaths under two years being entered under the generic\r\nhead of “convulsions” and “teeth,” while the item “chrysoms” received the\r\ndeaths under one month old.\r\n\r\nThe increase of whooping-cough in the following table, from units to tens,\r\nfrom tens to hundreds, and thereafter to a somewhat steady total of\r\nhundreds year after year, can hardly be explained except on the hypothesis\r\nof more exact classification of infantile deaths, corresponding to the\r\nactual decline of the article “convulsions” in the second half of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n  Years  Whooping-cough\r\n\r\n  1701          6\r\n  1702          1\r\n  1703          5\r\n  1704          0\r\n  1705          0\r\n  1706          2\r\n  1707          3\r\n  1708          3\r\n  1709          1\r\n  1710          5\r\n  1711          7\r\n  1712          3\r\n  1713          6\r\n  1714          6\r\n  1715          7\r\n  1716         11\r\n  1717         15\r\n  1718         24\r\n  1719         17\r\n  1720         33\r\n  1721         20\r\n  1722         21\r\n  1723         38\r\n  1724         25\r\n  1725         53\r\n  1726         37\r\n  1727         67\r\n  1728         21\r\n  1729         35\r\n  1730        152\r\n  1731         33\r\n  1732         65\r\n  1733         97\r\n  1734        139\r\n  1735         81\r\n  1736        130\r\n  1737        160\r\n  1738         69\r\n  1739         72\r\n  1740        280\r\n  1741        109\r\n  1742        122\r\n  1743         92\r\n  1744         46\r\n  1745        135\r\n  1746         95\r\n  1747        151\r\n  1748        150\r\n  1749         82\r\n  1750         55\r\n  1751        275\r\n  1752        188\r\n  1753         65\r\n  1754        336\r\n  1755         93\r\n  1756        199\r\n  1757        239\r\n  1758         84\r\n  1759        227\r\n  1760        414\r\n  1761        197\r\n  1762        300\r\n  1763        291\r\n  1764        251\r\n  1765        225\r\n  1766        213\r\n  1767        364\r\n  1768        262\r\n  1769        318\r\n  1770        218\r\n  1771        249\r\n  1772        385\r\n  1773        235\r\n  1774        554\r\n  1775        206\r\n  1776        181\r\n  1777        529\r\n  1778        379\r\n  1779        268\r\n  1780        573\r\n  1781        165\r\n  1782         78\r\n\r\n  (Continued in the table of measles deaths, p. 655)\r\n\r\nIt is not without significance that the vital statistics of Sweden were\r\nthe first to give whooping-cough something like its rightful place among\r\ninfantile causes of death: from 1749 to 1764 the deaths set down to that\r\ncause were 42,393, or an annual average of 2600, the epidemic year 1755\r\nhaving 5832. In this we should find merely the influence of systematic\r\nnomenclature. Nosology, or the scientific classification of diseases, may\r\nbe said to have begun under Linnaeus, who was for many years professor of\r\nmedicine at Upsala before he became professor of botany, and was teaching\r\na somewhat rudimentary nosology to the Swedish students of medicine before\r\nthe great work of his friend and correspondent Sauvages made\r\nclassifications general.\r\n\r\nConcerning the year 1751, which has 275 deaths from whooping-cough in the\r\nLondon bills, Fothergill writes in May: “Great numbers of children had the\r\nhooping cough, both in London and several adjacent villages, in a violent\r\ndegree. Strong, sanguine, healthy children seemed to suffer most by it;\r\nand to some of them it proved fatal where it was neglected or improperly\r\nmanaged”--the deaths having become more numerous towards the end of the\r\nyear[1240]. At Edinburgh, during the second year of high mortalities in\r\nthe famine-period 1740-41, whooping-cough has 101 deaths to 112 from\r\nmeasles, having had only a fourth part as many the year before (see p.\r\n523). In the Kilmarnock register from 1728 to 1763, “kinkhost” is credited\r\nwith a total of 116 deaths, about 3 on an annual average, measles having a\r\ntotal of 93 during the same thirty-six years. In Holy Cross parish, a\r\nsuburb of Shrewsbury, chincough has 9 deaths in the ten years 1750-60, and\r\n6 in the next ten years, measles having 4 and 15 in the respective\r\nperiods, and convulsions 9 and 31. In Ackworth parish, chincough has no\r\ndeaths in the ten years 1747-57, and 2 in the next ten years, “infancy”\r\nhaving 13 in each decade, “convulsions” and measles none in the first, 6\r\nand 2 respectively in the second. Warrington, in the disastrous smallpox\r\nyear, 1773, had 16 deaths from chincough and 34 from convulsions. In the\r\ntwo years 1772 and 1773, Chester had 33 and 10 deaths from chincough, 70\r\nand 69 from convulsions, 17 and 13 from “weakness of infancy.”\r\n\r\nWatt’s researches in the registers of all the Glasgow burial-grounds\r\nbrought out the fact that whooping-cough during a period of thirty years,\r\n1783 to 1812, had been a common and somewhat steady cause of death among\r\ninfants, having made 4·51 per cent. of the annual total of deaths at all\r\nages in the first six years of the period, and 5·57 per cent. in the last\r\nsix years[1241]. This was a higher annual average ratio than in the London\r\nbills for the same period (see the tables at p. 647 and p. 655), and was\r\nprobably the maximum in Britain, inasmuch as the Glasgow death-rate of\r\ninfants was the worst from all causes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhooping-Cough in Modern Times.\r\n\r\nWhen the causes of death began to be registered, in July, 1837,\r\nwhooping-cough was found to have the following relative place among the\r\nprincipal maladies of children during the latter six months of the year in\r\nLondon and in all England and Wales.\r\n\r\n_Mortality by diseases of Children, last six months of 1837._\r\n\r\n                     London    England and Wales\r\n\r\n  Convulsions         1717          10729\r\n  Measles             1354           4732\r\n  Whooping-Cough      1066           3044\r\n  Smallpox             763           5811\r\n  Scarlatina           418           2550\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole registration period, whooping-cough has kept its\r\nplace steadily among the chief causes of infant mortality, neither\r\ndecreasing nor increasing notably in the successive periods from 1837 to\r\nthe present time. Its mortality has varied a good deal from year to year,\r\nowing to occasional great epidemic years such as 1866 and 1878; but on the\r\nmean annual average of decennial periods, it has varied little:\r\n\r\n_Annual Deaths by Whooping-cough per million living at all ages._\r\n\r\n           Males    Females    Both sexes\r\n\r\n  1851-60   460       545         503\r\n  1861-70   487       566         527\r\n  1871-80   474       547         512\r\n  1881-90    --        --         451\r\n\r\nNo other epidemic malady has shown the same excess of female deaths in\r\nproportion to the numbers of the sex living, diphtheria being the only\r\nother that shows an excess at all.\r\n\r\nThe excess of deaths by whooping-cough among female infants was roughly\r\nshown by Watt in 1813, viz. 975 females to 842 males in the registers of\r\nthe Glasgow High Church, College Church and the North-Western Cemetery,\r\nthe relative numbers of the sexes living at the respective ages being then\r\nunknown. In all Scotland in 1889 the ratio was 1043 male deaths to 1225\r\nfemale. The singular difference between the sexes in this respect is\r\nalmost certainly related to the corresponding differences in the formation\r\nand development of the larynx, the organ which gives character, at least,\r\nto the convulsive cough of children. The expansion of the larynx in boys,\r\nwhich becomes so obvious at puberty and remains so distinctive of the male\r\nsex, is one of those secondary sexual characters which begin to\r\ndifferentiate quite early in life, and are probably congenital to some\r\nextent. It is not known whether female children are more often attacked\r\nthan males; but it is probable that they are predisposed both to acquire\r\ncoughs of the convulsive suffocative kind and to have their lives\r\nshattered by the attack--for the same anatomical and physiological\r\nreasons, namely, the imperfect development of the posterior space of the\r\nglottis with the spasmodic closure by reflex action[1242]. The deaths have\r\nbeen nearly all under the age of five.\r\n\r\n_Deaths by Whooping-cough per million living at the respective\r\nage-periods._\r\n\r\n                0-5     5-10\r\n\r\n  1851-60      3624      174\r\n  1861-70      3766      152\r\n  1871-80      3652      135\r\n\r\nThese proportions are almost the same as those given by Watt in 1813 from\r\nthree of the Glasgow registers.\r\n\r\n                Deaths by\r\n  Period      whooping-cough  Under five   Five to ten   Above ten\r\n\r\n  1783-1812       1817           1713          98            3\r\n\r\nMost of the deaths are in the first year, and in a rapidly declining ratio\r\nuntil the fifth, according to the following rates per million of male\r\nchildren living at each age-period (these figures are for a single year,\r\n1882):\r\n\r\n  Under one    One to two    Two to three    Three to four    Four to five\r\n\r\n     3039         2115           826              433              248\r\n\r\nThe mortality from whooping-cough falls very unequally on town and\r\ncountry. Thus, in Scotland in 1889, it caused 2268 deaths, being 3·13 per\r\ncent. of the deaths from all causes, and equivalent to a rate of ·58 per\r\n1000 living. The death-rate varied as follows: ·91 in the eight principal\r\ntowns, ·46 in the group of large towns, ·45 in the group of small towns,\r\n·25 in the mainland rural districts, and ·08 in the insular rural\r\ndistricts. In England, the capital has more than its share of deaths from\r\nwhooping-cough, Lancashire coming next, while the death-rates of\r\nMonmouthshire, Cornwall and Warwickshire are also a good deal above the\r\nmean of the whole country. The lowest death-rates are found in the purely\r\nagricultural counties.\r\n\r\nDuring the last half-century there has been a decline in the death-rate\r\nfrom all causes, including the infectious diseases as a group; but it can\r\nhardly be said that whooping-cough has had a due share in this decline.\r\nNotably in Ireland, where the decline of infectious disease has been most\r\nmarked, it has been, as it were, pushed to the front of its class by the\r\nshrinkage of the other items. In Scotland it is now decidedly at the head\r\nof the list, and in England it has shared the first place with measles\r\nsince the great diminution of scarlatina deaths.\r\n\r\n_Annual average Death-rates per 100,000 living._\r\n\r\n                     Whooping-cough   Measles   Scarlatina\r\n\r\n  England   { 1871-80     51·2         37·7        71·6\r\n            { 1881-90     45·1         44·1        33·8\r\n\r\n  Scotland  { 1871-80     63·1         37·0        79·5\r\n            { 1881-90     60·7         38·3        28·8\r\n\r\n  Ireland   { 1871-80     34·8         21·0        43·5\r\n            { 1881-90     28·5         19·2        20·8\r\n\r\nThere is a small decrease in the death-rate of whooping-cough within the\r\nlast decennial period, whereas in that of measles there is a slight\r\nincrease (except in Ireland). The comparative steadiness of whooping-cough\r\namong the causes of death is doubtless owing to the fact that the bulk of\r\nits fatalities are among infants, and that there appears to be an\r\nirreducible minimum of the deaths from all causes at that age-period.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhooping-Cough as a Sequel of other Maladies.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is convenient to group whooping-cough among the infectious\r\ndiseases, and although it is a clear case of a malady that comes in\r\nepidemics, yet its pathology is peculiar. It seems to be more a sequel of\r\nother diseases than an independent or primary affection. The whoop of the\r\nbreath, from which it is named, is really proper to any convulsive cough\r\nof some infants or children. Adults, having undergone the change in the\r\nform and relative size of the larynx at puberty, have the convulsive cough\r\nusually without the whoop if they have it at all. After the successive\r\ninfluenzas of recent years (1889-92), many adults suffered from convulsive\r\nparoxysmal cough which was whooping-cough in all respects but the whoop,\r\nthe choking fits, the blackness of the face, and the vomiting being, of\r\ncourse, all kept in subjection by the greater control of adults over their\r\nreflex actions.\r\n\r\nIt has been often remarked that the ordinary whooping-cough of children\r\nhas followed epidemics of influenza, or widely prevalent catarrhs. Thus,\r\nHillary records in July, 1753, an epidemic of whooping-cough, or “the\r\nfertussis,” all over the island of Barbados following the epidemic catarrh\r\nwhich was at a height in January of the same year. Whooping-cough had not\r\nbeen known in the island for many years past, “neither could I find by the\r\nstrictest inquiry that I could make that any child or elder person did\r\nbring it hither[1243].” Willan, in his corresponding records of the\r\nsuccession of diseases at the Carey Street Dispensary, London, from 1796\r\nto 1800, has the following:\r\n\r\n    “There was also among infants and children during the month of January\r\n    [1796], an epidemic catarrh attended with a watery discharge from the\r\n    eyes and nostrils, a frequent though slight cough, a shortness of\r\n    breath, or rather panting, a flushing of the cheeks, great languor\r\n    with disposition to sleep, and a quick small irregular pulse.... It\r\n    was succeeded in February by the hooping cough.”\r\n\r\nMeasles, which is usually a catarrhal malady, has undoubtedly been\r\nfollowed by whooping-cough in many individual cases and in epidemics as a\r\nwhole; and it may be that there is a closer association of whooping-cough\r\nwith measles than with any other infectious disease. In the table on p.\r\n647, the deaths by whooping cough in London from 1731 to 1830 have been\r\nreduced to ratios per cent. of the deaths from all causes, in a parallel\r\ncolumn with the ratios of measles; it will be seen that the increase of\r\nboth is equally remarkable towards the end of the table. But the Glasgow\r\nratios abstracted by Watt show no such decided increase of whooping-cough\r\nfrom 1783 to 1812, side by side with the astonishing increase of measles;\r\nwhile his annual bills for the same period show that there were many\r\ndeaths from whooping-cough in Glasgow for years before measles began to\r\nreplace smallpox or to divide the mortality with it. The first high\r\nmonthly mortalities from whooping-cough in Watt’s bills were from\r\nNovember, 1785, to the end of 1786; but there had been so little measles\r\nfor twenty-four months before that epidemic began, that only one death\r\nfrom it is recorded all the time. Again, the great measles epidemic of\r\n1808 in Glasgow was indeed followed by many deaths from whooping-cough in\r\n1809; but, while the height of the measles epidemic was in May and June,\r\n1808, it was not until April, 1809, that whooping-cough began to cause\r\nmany deaths.\r\n\r\n_Glasgow: Deaths by measles and whooping-cough._\r\n\r\n            Whooping-cough  Measles\r\n\r\n  1807\r\n    Nov.         18           2\r\n    Dec.         18           1\r\n\r\n  1808\r\n    Jan.         10           2\r\n    Feb.         20           2\r\n    March        12           5\r\n    April        18          71\r\n    May           9         259\r\n    June          9         260\r\n    July          2         118\r\n    Aug.          2          32\r\n    Sept.         2          22\r\n    Oct.          2          10\r\n    Nov.          4           4\r\n    Dec.          2           2\r\n\r\n  1809\r\n    Jan.          7           4\r\n    Feb.          6           4\r\n    March         7           2\r\n    April        16           1\r\n    May          22           4\r\n    June         25           4\r\n    July         22           6\r\n    Aug.         15           2\r\n    Sept.        35           4\r\n    Oct.         23           1\r\n    Nov.         36           2\r\n    Dec.         45          10\r\n\r\n  1810\r\n    Jan.         33           4\r\n    Feb.         32           4\r\n    March        19           3\r\n\r\nWhatever correspondence or relation there may be between measles and\r\nwhooping-cough, (and it has been remarked by many in the ordinary way of\r\nexperience), it eludes the method of statistics[1244]. As for the\r\ncatarrhs of infants and children other than those which are part of the\r\nactual attack of measles or influenza, they are so common from year to\r\nyear, and even from month to month, (perhaps coincident with teething, or\r\nwith chicken-pox or other slight febrile disturbance), that a statistical\r\nstudy of whooping-cough in relation to them could lead only to an\r\nempirical, and possibly bewildering, result. It may be more useful to\r\nconsider the antecedent probability of some such relationship, arising out\r\nof the pathology of the convulsive cough.\r\n\r\nWhooping-cough is not only a paroxysmal cough coming on in convulsive fits\r\nat intervals, but the paroxysms, as they recur for many weeks, or, as they\r\nsay in Japan, “for a hundred days,” have none of the obvious occasions of\r\ncoughing, such as catarrh of the mucous membrane, congestion of the lungs\r\nfrom hot or close air, irritation of the bronchial tubes from dusty\r\nparticles or vapours, or the presence of tubercles in the substance of the\r\nlungs. Such irritants can, indeed, produce whooping-cough, as in the\r\nfollowing instance of “artificial chincough” related by Watt:\r\n\r\n    Two children having quarelled in their play, one of them thrust a\r\n    handful of sawdust into the mouth of the other. Some of the sawdust\r\n    passed into the windpipe. After a short time the child began to have\r\n    violent convulsive fits of coughing, in which the whoop was very\r\n    distinctly formed. Expectoration in the course of a few hours removed\r\n    all the irritation, and the coughing thereupon ceased.\r\n\r\nBut in natural or ordinary whooping-cough there is no mechanical\r\nirritation, there is nothing to cough up, the reflex action, violent and\r\nparoxysmal though it be, has apparently no motive. I have, in another\r\nwork, offered an original explanation of the paroxysmal cough of children\r\nas being the deferred reaction, the postponed liability, the stored-up\r\nmemory, of some past catarrhal or otherwise irritated state of the\r\nrespiratory organs, to which I refer without attempting to summarize it\r\nhere[1245].\r\n\r\nThe epidemicity of whooping-cough presents no more difficulty if the\r\nmalady be viewed as the sequel or dregs of something else than if it be\r\ntaken for an independent primary affection. The many infants and children\r\nthat suffer from it together may have equally been suffering together from\r\none or other of the various things of which it is assumed to be the\r\nsequel--influenza, measles, sore-throat, the bronchitis of rickets, simple\r\nbronchial catarrh of the winter, simple coryza. Again, it may be a\r\nsecondary or residual affection with many, but a communicable disease to\r\nothers. Much of the whooping-cough of an epidemic is believed by good\r\nauthorities, such as Bouchut and Struges[1246], to be simply mimetic, or a\r\nhabit of coughing acquired by hearing other children coughing in a\r\nparticular way, just as chorea is sometimes acquired in schools or\r\nhospital-wards through the mere spectacle of it. But it may be doubted\r\nwhether much of the whooping-cough which swells the bills of mortality is\r\nacquired in that way. The children that die of it are probably most of\r\nthem such as had only escaped dying of the measles or other infective\r\ndisease, or of the non-specific catarrh, which had preceded the\r\nwhooping-cough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSCARLATINA AND DIPHTHERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarlatina and diphtheria have to be taken together in a historical work\r\nfor the reason that certain important epidemics of the 18th century, both\r\nin Britain and in the American colonies, which were indeed the first of\r\nthe kind in modern English experience, cannot now be placed definitely\r\nunder the one head or the other, nor divided between the two. It may be\r\nthat this ambiguity lies actually in the complex or undifferentiated\r\nnature of the throat-distemper at that time, or that it arises out of the\r\ncontemporary manner of making and recording observations upon the\r\nprevalent maladies of seasons. The older or Hippocratic method was not\r\nunlike the mason’s rule of lead, said to have been in use in the island of\r\nLesbos for measuring uneven stones; it took account of gradations,\r\nmodifications, affinities, being careless of symmetry, of definitions or\r\nclean-cut nosological ideas, or the dividing lines of a classification.\r\nSydenham was the great English exponent of this method; but, in one of his\r\nmore discursive passages, he sketched out another method of describing\r\ndiseases as if they were species or natural kinds[1247]. He did no more\r\nthan indicate this analogy, at the same time declining to put it in\r\npractice; so that Sauvages correctly described his great Nosology of 1763\r\nas being constructed “juxta Sydenhami mentem et Botanicorum ordinem.” The\r\nidentification of scarlatina in its modern sense, including scarlatina\r\nsimplex and scarlatina anginosa, falls really in the time of the\r\nnosologies in the generation following the work of Sauvages, although both\r\nthe name and definition in the modern sense were used in England as early\r\nas 1749. On the other hand, the name and definition of diphtheria were\r\nlittle known until about the years 1856-59, when the form of\r\nthroat-distemper which is now quite definitely joined to that name became\r\nsuddenly common, having been almost unheard of for at least two\r\ngenerations before. The only English writer who has attempted to unravel\r\nthe accounts of the 18th century epidemics of throat-disease was Dr Willan\r\nin his unfinished work on Cutaneous Diseases, 1808; he swept the whole of\r\nthose epidemic types into the species of scarlatina, to which also he\r\nreduced the great Spanish epidemics of “garrotillo” in the 16th and 17th\r\ncenturies. Whether he would have used so summary a method if he had seen\r\nthe sudden return of diphtheria in 1856, may well be doubted; at all\r\nevents the German writers who brought their erudition to bear upon the\r\nquestion of identity some thirty years ago have discovered true diphtheria\r\namong the 18th century throat-distempers, although no two of them agree as\r\nto which of these should be called diphtheria and which scarlatina\r\nanginosa. It is one advantage of a historical method that the complexities\r\nof things may be stated just as they are, with due criticism, naturally,\r\nof the matters of fact and of the relative credit of observers. The result\r\nis more an impression than a logical conclusion,--an impression which will\r\ntake a colour from the pre-existing views or theoretical preferences of\r\nindividual readers on such points as fixity of type or the incompetence of\r\nthe earlier observers. An author who has puzzled over these difficulties\r\nin detail can hardly help having a tolerably definite impression of the\r\nreal state of the case; and I do not seek to conceal mine, namely, that\r\nscarlatina anginosa and diphtheria were not in nature so sharply\r\ndifferentiated in the 18th century as they have been since 1856.\r\n\r\nThe significant name of _pestis gutturuosa_ or plague of the throat is\r\ngiven by the St Albans chronicler to the great pestilence, or some part of\r\nit, in 1315-16, during one of the worst periods of famine and murrain in\r\nthe whole English history. But those two words being all that we have to\r\nbase upon, there is no use speculating whether the disease was scarlatina\r\nanginosa, or diphtheria, or something different from either. This is\r\nperhaps the only reference to an epidemic throat-distemper in England for\r\nseveral centuries in which bubo-plague was the grand infection. In the\r\npopular medical handbooks of the Tudor period one naturally looks for\r\nscarlatina among the diseases of children. In Elyot’s _Castel of Health_\r\n(1541), “the purpyles” is mentioned among children’s maladies in company\r\nwith smallpox and measles, and the same name is in the London bills of\r\nmortality from their beginning in 1629, although it does not appear\r\nwhether the deaths assigned to it were of children or adults. Perhaps the\r\nmost common use of purples in the 17th and 18th centuries was for a form\r\nof childbed fever often attended with discoloured miliary vesicles. In\r\nScotland, according to Sibbald (1684), “the fevers called purple” were any\r\nfevers, even measles or smallpox, in which livid or dark spots occurred as\r\nan occasional thing. Unless a few scarlatinal deaths are included under\r\n“purples” in the London bills (they could not have been many in any case),\r\nthere is no other evidence of their existence until 1703, when the entry\r\nof scarlet fever appears for the first time, with seven deaths to it in\r\nthe year. The heading remains in the bills until 1730 (the deaths never\r\nmore than one figure), after which it is merged with fevers in general.\r\nThe same indications of the insignificance of scarlatina among the causes\r\nof death in the 17th century may be got from the medical writers in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nSydenham introduced into the third edition (1675) of his _Observationes\r\nMedicae_ a short chapter entitled “Febris Scarlatina[1248].” It was a\r\ndisease that might occur at any time of the year, but occurred mostly in\r\nthe end of summer, sometimes infesting whole families, the children more\r\nthan the elders. It began with a rigor, as other fevers did, the malaise\r\nbeing but slight. Then the whole skin became interspersed with small red\r\nspots, more numerous, broader, redder and less uniform than in measles;\r\nthey persisted for two or three days and then vanished, and, as the\r\ncuticle returned to its natural state, there were successive desquamations\r\nof fine branny scales, which he compares elsewhere to those following the\r\nmeasles of 1670. Sydenham took it to be a moderate effervescence of the\r\nblood from the heat of the summer just over, or from some such excitement.\r\nIt was a mild affair, not calling for blood-letting nor cardiac remedies,\r\nand requiring no other regimen than abstinence from flesh and spirituous\r\nliquors, and that the patient should keep in doors, but not all day in\r\nbed. The disease, he says, amounted to hardly more than a name (_hoc morbi\r\nnomen, vix enim altius assurgit_); but it appears that it was sometimes\r\nfatal; and in those cases Sydenham was inclined, after his wont, to blame\r\nthe fussiness of the medical attendant (_nimia medici diligentia_). If\r\nconvulsions or coma preceded the eruption, a large epispastic should be\r\napplied to the back of the neck and paregoric administered. Whether\r\nSydenham was describing true scarlatina simplex, or a “scarlatiniform\r\nvariety of contagious roseola,” it is from him that we derive the name of\r\nscarlatina by continuous usage to the present time[1249].\r\n\r\nA few years after Sydenham had thus described scarlatina, Sir Robert\r\nSibbald, physician and naturalist of Edinburgh, professed to have\r\ndiscovered the same as a new species of disease. “Just as the luxury of\r\nmen,” he says, “increases every day, so there grow up new diseases, if not\r\nunknown to former generations, yet untreated of by them. Nor is this\r\nsurprising, since new depravations of the humours arise from unwonted\r\ndiets and from various mixtures of the same. Among the many diseases which\r\nowe their origin to this age, there has been most recently (_nuperrime_)\r\nobserved a fever which is called _Scarlatina_, from the carmine colour\r\n(named by our people in the vernacular _scarlet_) with which almost the\r\nwhole skin is tinged. Of this disease the observations are not so many\r\nthat an accurate theory can be delivered or a method of cure constructed.”\r\nHe proceeds to append one case--a child of eight, daughter of one of the\r\nsenators of the College of Justice, who fell ill with redness of the face\r\n(thought at first to indicate smallpox coming on), became delirious and\r\nrestless, then had the redness all over, which disappeared and left the\r\nchild well about the fifth day. He had heard from some of his colleagues\r\nthat the scarlet rash was sometimes interspersed with vesicles--perhaps\r\nthe _miliaria_ so much in evidence a generation or two later. In adults,\r\nSibbald had seen the cuticle fall from nearly the whole body. But\r\nextremely few (_paucissimi_) had died of this fever. Like Sydenham, he\r\nomits to mention sore-throat and dropsy[1250].\r\n\r\nAnother 17th century reference is by Morton, who practised in London, in\r\nNewgate Street, from about 1667 to the end of the century, and was\r\nfrequently called to consult with apothecaries or other physicians in\r\ncases of sickness in middle-class families. In the second volume of his\r\n_Pyretologia_, published in 1694, he has a chapter “De Morbillis et Febre\r\nScarlatina,” and a separate chapter “De Febre Scarlatina.” His position\r\ntowards scarlet fever is peculiar. He uses the name, he says, in deference\r\nto the common consent of physicians, but, for his own part, he thinks\r\nscarlatina different from measles only in the form of the rash, so-called\r\nscarlatina being confluent measles just as there is a confluent smallpox.\r\nExcept in that sense he sees no reason for retaining scarlatina in the\r\ncatalogue of diseases. Both arise from the same cause, both have hacking\r\ncough, heaviness of the brain, sneezing, diarrhoea; the single difference\r\nis that in scarlatina the rash is continuous. He gives eleven cases, most\r\nof which are clearly enough cases of measles; but the fourth case, that of\r\nhis own daughter, Marcia, aged seven, in 1689, “in quo febris dicta\r\nScarlatina, tempore praesertim aestivo, quadantenus publice grassabatur,”\r\nhad no cough, nor redness of the eyes, nor diarrhoea, nor any other\r\ncatarrhal symptoms (such as her sister had in 1685), but on the fourth day\r\na continuous scarlet rash over the whole skin, which ended, not in a\r\ndesquamation of fine branny scales, but in parchment-like peeling. The\r\neleventh instance is complex enough to show that Morton had some reason,\r\nat that early stage in the history of scarlatina, for hesitating to make\r\nthe disease a distinct type under a name of its own.\r\n\r\n    About midsummer, 1689, he was called to the house of his friend Mr\r\n    Hook, merchant, of Pye Alley, Fenchurch Street, and found the whole\r\n    household, three young girls, one little boy, and their aunt Mrs\r\n    Barnardiston, a matron aged seventy, all suffering from the effects of\r\n    some infection of as deleterious a kind as synochus, the symptoms\r\n    being hacking cough, coma, delirium, and other signs of malignity. But\r\n    on the 4th, 5th, or 6th day, each had a scarlatinal rash all over the\r\n    skin, which lasted until the 7th, 8th or 10th day. Two of the girls,\r\n    and the boy, had “on the 4th or 5th day of the efflorescence”\r\n    extensive parotid swellings, difficulty of swallowing, vibrating\r\n    arteries, and other urgent symptoms, for which they were blooded. The\r\n    parotid abscesses burst, and discharged a copious acrid, corrosive pus\r\n    by the nostrils, ears and throat, for the space of thirty days, during\r\n    which the patients gradually got well. The third girl had, on the 3rd\r\n    or 4th day of the rash, a painful swelling in the left armpit, not\r\n    unlike a bubo; she also was blooded, and recovered completely, the\r\n    swelling having broken and discharged pus for many days. The case of\r\n    the aunt, aged seventy, was somewhat different; she neglected her\r\n    medicines, acquired a “carcinoma” or slough over the pubes, which\r\n    became gangrenous, recovered with difficulty, and lived three years\r\n    longer.\r\n\r\nMorton calls these cases a veritable _pestis_ or plague; and he goes on in\r\nthe same context to say: “what swellings have I seen of the uvula, fauces,\r\nnares, and how protracted! At other times, what turgid lips, covered with\r\nsordid crusts and ulcerated!”--instancing the child of Mr Blaney, who had\r\nthese symptoms long after the efflorescence, together with fever and\r\ncoma[1251]. These cases, all given under the eleventh history illustrating\r\nthe chapter on Scarlatina, are perhaps not different from those which\r\nHuxham, next in order, described in 1735, but not under the same name. It\r\nwould appear from a reference in Hamilton’s essay on Miliary Fever,\r\npublished in 1710, that scarlet fever continued to be seen in London: “If,\r\nin a scarlet fever, miliary pustules should arise, dying away with a red\r\ncolour, they promise safety[1252].”\r\n\r\nSeveral of the annalists of epidemic constitutions agree as to fatal\r\nanginas in the year 1727, with an exanthem of the miliary kind.\r\nWintringham, of York, mentions the two things apart--in one place a putrid\r\nfever with cutaneous eruptions of a fuscous colour, sometimes dry,\r\nsometimes filled with a clear serum; in another place, “about this time\r\nmany anginas were prevalent, attended with extreme suffocation, which\r\nproved fatal unless they were speedily relieved.” He mentions the same\r\nputrid fever in the summer of 1728, and again anginae. Hillary, who was\r\nthen at Ripon, gives the same fever in 1727 (or perhaps in 1726) with\r\nmiliary eruption, and chronicles “a fatal suffocative quinsey” in the\r\nwinter of 1727-28, of which many died, especially those that had been\r\nreduced by the fever. Huxham’s account of an epidemic malady of the throat\r\nand neck at Plymouth in January and February, 1728, might relate to mumps\r\n(which Hillary and an Edinburgh observer describe clearly enough under\r\n1731); and under October, 1728, he describes an erysipelatous and\r\npetechial fever, often relieved by an eruption of red miliary vesicles\r\naccompanied by sweats, the same miliary fever being again common in the\r\nautumn of 1729. This association of “putrid” fever with sore-throat\r\nbecame still more notable in the period 1750-60.\r\n\r\nThese anginas of 1727-28 are unimportant compared with the outbreak a few\r\nyears later. We hear first from Edinburgh in June, 1733, of scarlet fever\r\nand sore throats frequent in several parts of the country near the city,\r\nand continuing all through the summer into the winter and spring of\r\n1734[1253]. Then in April, 1734, begins a series of important notes by\r\nHuxham at Plymouth[1254]. In that month, he says, there began a certain\r\nanginose fever (“for so I shall call it”), raging more and more every day.\r\nIt mostly affected children and young people. Among other symptoms were\r\nvomiting and diarrhoea, pain and swelling of the fauces, languor, anxiety,\r\ndelirium or stupor, a favourable issue being attended with sweats and red\r\npustules. In May it was raging worse, with more severe angina and most\r\ntroublesome “aphthae.” In June it was now miliary-pustular, and not seldom\r\nerysipelatous, while the throat was “less oppressed.” On the 6th or 7th\r\nday the cuticle looked rough and broken as if thickly sprinkled with bran;\r\nat length the whole desquamated--sometimes the entire skin of the sole of\r\nthe foot coming off. The more copious the rash, the better the chance for\r\nlife. It was contagious, affecting several in the same house. In July it\r\ncut off several within six days of the onset. Huxham’s references to this\r\nputrid miliary fever in Devon and Cornwall go on for some time, without\r\nfarther mention of the throat complication. In April, 1735, “raro nunc\r\nadest strangulans faucium dolor, paucaeque nunc erumpunt pustulae.” But,\r\nin September, 1736, he enters again, “febres miliares, scarlatinae,\r\npustulosae,” often attended with swelling of the parotid glands and of the\r\nfauces, and with profuse sweats.\r\n\r\nThe most important scene of fatal angina with rash in the same period\r\n(1734-35) was the North American colonies. Before coming to that\r\nremarkable outburst, I shall mention one curious coincident outbreak in\r\nthe island of Barbados. Dr Warren, who occupies his pen chiefly with\r\nyellow fever, says[1255]: “In this space of time [1734 to 1738], there\r\narose here a few other diseases, that were really epidemical and of the\r\ncontagious kind too, few escaping them in families where they had once\r\ngot a footing. The first was an obstinate and ill-favour’d erysipelatous\r\nquinsey. The second a very anomalous scarlet fever, in which almost all\r\nthe skin, even of the hands and feet, peeled off,”--just as Huxham\r\ndescribed for Devonshire.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond our purpose to include the evidence from foreign countries;\r\nbut it may be noted in this context that Le Cat, in tracing the\r\nantecedents of the great Rouen fever in his paper of 1754, refers to many\r\nfatal anginas in that city about twenty years before[1256]. Thus we find\r\nabout the year 1735 evidence of the beginning of a remarkable\r\n“constitution” of throat-disease both in the old world and in the new. But\r\nthe facts in America stand out with peculiar prominence, and shall be\r\ngiven on the threshold of the subject as fully as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Throat-distemper of New England, 1735-36.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the great wave of “throat-distemper” that spread over the\r\ntowns and villages of New England in 1735 are singularly clear and even\r\nnumerically precise. The arrival of this sickness is one of the most\r\ndefinite incidents in the whole history of epidemics; it was hardly\r\npossible for the common belief, whether popular or professional, to have\r\nbeen mistaken about it. Just a hundred years had passed since the first\r\nsettlement of the Puritans on Massachusetts Bay and along the Connecticut\r\nriver; Boston had grown to a town of some 12,000 inhabitants, and many\r\nsmall towns and townships had sprung up along the coast and in the\r\ninterior. The population was still sparse, although it was growing rapidly\r\nfrom within; it is difficult to believe that even the largest towns could\r\nthen have deserved the strictures which Noah Webster passed upon them two\r\ngenerations later[1257].\r\n\r\nIn the mother country at that time, smallpox was the great infectious\r\nmalady of infancy and childhood. It was not unknown in the colonies,\r\nBoston having had epidemics in 1721, 1730 and 1752, and Charleston an\r\nepidemic in 1738 after an almost free interval of thirty years. Even in\r\nthe chief cities of the colonies such epidemics were only occasional,\r\naffecting adults and adolescents perhaps more than infants and as much as\r\nchildren; while in such a town as Hampton, for which the register was well\r\nkept from 1735, it is known that there were no smallpox deaths in the\r\ntwenty years following, or until the period 1755-63, when four died of the\r\ndisease, and that only one death from it occurred in the next recorded\r\nperiod of ten years, 1767 to 1776. It was in these circumstances of a\r\ngrowing population, almost untouched, at least in the inland towns, by the\r\ngreat infantile infectious malady of the old country, that the\r\nthroat-distemper broke out and raged in the manner now to be described.\r\n\r\nThe disease “did emerge,” as Douglass says, on the 20th of May, 1735, at\r\nKingston township, some fifty miles to the east of Boston[1258]. The first\r\nchild seized died in three days; in about a week after three children in a\r\nfamily some four miles distant were successively seized, and all died on\r\nthe third day; it continued to spread through the township, and Douglass\r\nwas informed that of the first forty cases none recovered. It was vulgarly\r\ncalled the “throat illness” or “plague in the throat.” Some died quickly\r\nas if from prostration, but most had “a symptomatic affection of the\r\nfauces or neck: that is, a sphacelation or corrosive ulceration in the\r\nfauces, or an infiltration and tumefaction in the chops and forepart of\r\nthe neck, so turgid as to bring all upon a level between the chin and\r\nsternum, occasioning a strangulation of the patient in a very short time.”\r\nIn August it was at Exeter, a town six miles distant, but it did not\r\nappear at Chester, six miles to the westward, until October. After the\r\nfirst fatal outburst in Kingston township it became somewhat milder; but\r\nin the country districts of New Hampshire it was fatal to 1 in 3, or 1 in\r\n4 of the sick, and in scarce any place to less than 1 in 6. This average\r\nwas made up by its excessive fatality in some families; Boynton of Newbury\r\nFalls lost his eight children; at Hampton Falls twenty-seven died in five\r\nfamilies. The following table, compiled by Fitch, minister of Portsmouth,\r\nshows the deaths from it in various towns and townships of New Hampshire\r\nduring fourteen months from May, 1735, to 26 July, 1736, with the\r\nages[1259]:\r\n\r\n_Deaths from the throat-distemper in 14 months, 1735-36_ (Fitch).\r\n\r\n                Under      Ten to     Twenty       Thirty     Above\r\n              ten years    twenty    to thirty    to forty    forty  Total\r\n\r\n  Portsmouth     81          15          1           --         2     99\r\n  Dover          77           8          3           --        --     88\r\n  Hampton        37           8          8            1         1     55\r\n  Hampton\r\n    Falls       160          40          9            1        --    220\r\n  Exeter        105          18          4           --        --    127\r\n  Newcastle      11          --         --           --        --     11\r\n  Gosport        34           2         --           --         1     37\r\n  Rye            34          10         --           --        --     44\r\n  Greenland      13           2          3           --        --     18\r\n  Newington      16           5         --           --        --     21\r\n  Newmarket      20           1         --            1        --     22\r\n  Stretham       18          --         --           --        --     18\r\n  Kingston       96          15          1            1        --    113\r\n  Durham         79          15          6           --        --    100\r\n  Chester        21          --         --           --        --     21\r\n                ---         ---        ---          ---       ---    ---\r\n                802         139         35            4         4    984\r\n\r\nThe meaning of these figures in the townships of New Hampshire will appear\r\nfrom the case of Hampton. In the year 1736 its burials from all causes\r\nwere 69, and its baptisms 50; while the throat-distemper alone, during\r\nfourteen months of that and the previous year, cut off 55. As we have\r\nseen, Hampton had no smallpox to ravage its children; but the\r\nthroat-disease of 1735-36 had almost the same effect as the occasional\r\ndisastrous epidemics of smallpox had upon English towns of a corresponding\r\npopulation or annual average of births.\r\n\r\nThis plague in the throat attacked the children of the most sequestered\r\nhouses, especially those situated near rivers or lakes. It was least fatal\r\nto those who lived well, both Douglass and Colden assigning the salt diet,\r\nand other things likely to produce _psora_, as the reason of its greater\r\nseverity. In the country districts or townships, in which the fatalities\r\nwere most numerous, it would appear that an eruption, scarlet or other,\r\nwas not only not the rule but even something of a rarity. Douglass, who\r\nwas familiar with the exanthem in the Boston cases, assigns its absence in\r\nthe country to a mistaken evacuant treatment, by which “the laudable and\r\nsalutary cuticular eruption has been so perverted as to be noticeable only\r\nin a few, and in these it was called a scarlet fever.”\r\n\r\nWhen the disease broke out in due course at Boston it proved much less\r\nmalignant than in the country. The first case, on the 20th August, had\r\nwhite specks in the throat and an efflorescence of the skin. A few more\r\nsoon followed in the same locality, of which none were fatal; they had\r\nsoreness in the throat, the tonsils swelled and speckt, the uvula relaxed,\r\na slight fever, a flush in the face and an erysipelas-like efflorescence\r\non the neck and extremities. The first death was not until October, the\r\ndisease becoming more frequent and more fatal in November, and reaching\r\nits worst in the second week of March, when the burials from all causes\r\nrose to 24, the average per week in an ordinary season being 10. The\r\nfatalities in Boston were so few for the enormous number of cases that\r\nmany could scarce be persuaded that it was the same disease as in the\r\nTownships. In the corresponding weeks (1 Oct. to 11 May) of eight ordinary\r\nyears preceding, the average deaths were 268, whites and slaves; during\r\nthis sickness they were 382, or an excess of 114, which were probably all\r\ndue to the throat-distemper, as many as 76 fatal cases having come to the\r\nknowledge of Douglass himself. He estimates the whole number of attacks at\r\n4000, giving a ratio of one death in thirty-five cases; but it is clear\r\nthat very slight cases of sore-throat were counted in.\r\n\r\n    The fatal cases in Boston seem to have shown a great range of\r\n    malignant symptoms: “We have anatomically inspected persons who died\r\n    of it with so intense a foetor from the violence of the disease that\r\n    some practitioners could not continue in the room.” Among the bad\r\n    symptoms were the coming and going of the miliary eruption, dark livid\r\n    colour of the same, the vesicles large, distinct and pale, like\r\n    crystalline smallpox; an ichorous discharge from the nose; many mucous\r\n    linings expectorated, resembling the cuticle raised by blisters; pus\r\n    brought up where no sloughs could be seen in the fauces; extension to\r\n    the bronchi, with symptoms of a New England quinsey (? croup); in some\r\n    children, spreading ulcers behind the ears; the tongue throwing off a\r\n    complete slough with marks of the papillae. Among the after-effects in\r\n    severe cases were anasarca or dropsy of the skin, haemorrhages,\r\n    urtications, serpiginous eruptions chiefly in the face, purulent\r\n    pustules, boils, or imposthumations in the groins, armpits and other\r\n    parts of the body, indurations of the front of the neck (the same by\r\n    which many in the country were suffocated, and a few in Boston),\r\n    hysteric symptoms in women, and epileptic fits.\r\n\r\n    Douglass gives special attention to the eruption, which he calls\r\n    miliary in his title-page. Some had a sore-throat without any\r\n    eruption, and a very few had an eruption with no affection of the\r\n    throat beyond the tonsils and uvula swollen. In some the eruption\r\n    preceded the soreness of the throat, in some the two came together,\r\n    but in the general case the eruption was a little later than the\r\n    affection in the throat. The ordinary course was a chill and\r\n    shivering, spasmodic wandering pains, vomiting or at least nausea,\r\n    pain, swelling and redness of the tonsils and uvula, with some white\r\n    specks: then followed a flush in the face, with some miliary\r\n    eruptions, attended by a benign mild fever; soon after, the miliary\r\n    efflorescence appears on the neck, chest and extremities; on the third\r\n    or fourth day the rash is at its height and well defined, with fair\r\n    intervals; the flushing goes off gradually with a general itching, and\r\n    in a day or two more the cuticle scales or peels off, especially in\r\n    the extremities. At the same time the cream-coloured sloughs or specks\r\n    on the fauces become loose and are cast off, and the swelling goes\r\n    down. Where the miliary eruptions were considerable the extremities\r\n    peeled in scraps or strips like _exuviae_; in one or two, the nails of\r\n    the fingers and toes were shed. Some who had little or no obvious\r\n    eruption underwent a scaling or peeling of the cuticle.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic having spent its force upon the New England towns from the\r\nautumn of 1735 until the summer of 1736, gradually travelled westward, and\r\nwas two years in reaching the Hudson River, distant only two hundred miles\r\nin a straight line from Kingston, where it first appeared in May, 1735. It\r\ncontinued its progress, with some interruptions, until it spread over the\r\ncolonies from Pemaquid in 44°N. latitude to Carolina; and as Douglass,\r\nwriting in 1736, had heard that “it is in our West India Islands,” it was\r\nprobably the same disease that Warren recorded for Barbados in the same\r\nyears under the names of “an obstinate and ill-favour’d erysipelatous\r\nquinsey,” and “a very anomalous scarlet fever”; and the same as the\r\nepidemic “sore-throats” that another records for the Virgin Islands in\r\n1737[1260].\r\n\r\nAlthough it usually attacked several children in the same house, it did\r\nnot seem to be communicable, like smallpox, from person to person or by\r\nthe medium of infected clothes. The Boston physicians held a consultation\r\non the point, and published their opinion that it proceeded entirely from\r\n“some occult quality of the air.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis was the first appearance of sore-throat with efflorescence of the\r\nskin among the English colonists of North America. For at least two\r\ngenerations after, the disease remained in the country, breaking out\r\nunaccountably from time to time at one place or another and often cutting\r\noff many children, but never so malignantly as at first[1261]. Colden,\r\nwriting from near New York in 1753, says:[1262]\r\n\r\n    “Ever since I came into this part of the country where I live (now\r\n    about fourteen years), it frequently breaks out in different families\r\n    and places, without any previous observable cause, but does not spread\r\n    as it did at first. Sometimes a few only have it in a considerable\r\n    neighbourhood. It seems as if some seeds or leaven or secret cause\r\n    remains wherever it goes; for I hear of the like observations in other\r\n    parts of the country. Several have been observed to have it more than\r\n    once.... In different years and different persons the symptoms are\r\n    various. In some seasons it has been accompanied with miliary\r\n    eruptions all over the skin; and at such times the symptoms about the\r\n    throat have been mild and the disease generally without danger if not\r\n    ill treated. Some have had sores, like those on the tonsils, with a\r\n    corrosive humour behind their ears, on the private and other parts of\r\n    the body, sometimes without any ulceration in the throat” (case given\r\n    of a child of ten with sores on the pudenda).\r\n\r\nIt was in 1754, the very next year after Colden wrote as above, that the\r\nsecond great epidemic of throat-distemper arose in New Hampshire and the\r\nneighbouring parts of Massachusetts. The figures of its mortality which\r\nhave been preserved for the town of Hampton, New Hampshire, may serve as a\r\nsample of its prevalence subsequent to the original explosion of 1735-36.\r\nIn the first epidemic, 1735-36, there died at Hampton of the\r\nthroat-distemper, 55 persons, mostly children. In the second, from January\r\n1754 to July 1755, there died of it 51 persons. The deaths from all causes\r\nin those two years were 85, and the births 70.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the proportion of deaths from throat-distemper\r\nto the deaths from all causes in Hampton from 1735 to 1791[1263].\r\n\r\n              Deaths from        Deaths from\r\n  Period     throat-distemper    all causes\r\n\r\n  1735-44        91                216\r\n  1745-54        60                221\r\n  1755-63        30                187\r\n  1764-66        --                 --\r\n  1767-76         3                115\r\n  1777-86         7                 99\r\n  1787-91         0                 46\r\n\r\nIt was once more described, for New York city, by Dr Samuel Bard in\r\n1771[1264]. He identifies it with the disease described by Douglass in\r\n1735, and gives an account of it on the whole like Colden’s.\r\n\r\n    It was “uncommon and very dangerous,” mostly a malady of children\r\n    under ten. They drooped for several days, had a watery eye, then a\r\n    bloated livid countenance, and a few red eruptions here and there on\r\n    the face. This went on for three or four days, the throat meanwhile\r\n    showing white specks on the tonsils. Sudden and great prostration\r\n    ensued, with a peculiar hollow cough and tone of voice, or loss of\r\n    voice, constant fever, especially nocturnal, and a degree of\r\n    drowsiness. In fatal cases there was great restlessness and tossing of\r\n    the limbs towards the end. In one family all the seven children took\r\n    it one after another; three died out of the four elder; the three\r\n    younger recovered, having had ulceration behind the ears, which\r\n    continued for several weeks and rendered an acrid, corrosive ichor.\r\n    Many other children had these ulcerations behind the ears, sometimes\r\n    with swelling of the parotid and sublingual glands. The same\r\n    ulcerations might occur also “in different parts of the body.” Sloughs\r\n    of the fauces and epiglottis extended as a membranous exudation into\r\n    the trachea. Two cases occurred in women, one of them having assisted\r\n    to lay out two children dead of the distemper.\r\n\r\nThe last time of its general spreading (within the period covered by\r\nBelknap’s _History of New Hampshire_, 1791) was in 1784-85-86 and -87. It\r\nwas first seen at Sandford in the county of York, and thence diffused\r\nitself very slowly through most of the towns of New England; but its\r\nvirulence and the mortality which it caused were comparatively\r\nsmall[1265].\r\n\r\n\r\nAngina maligna in England from 1739.\r\n\r\nAlthough there had been an extensive prevalence of angina with miliary or\r\nscarlet or erysipelatous rash in Devon and Cornwall in 1734 and following\r\nyears, a slight amount of sore-throat with scarlet fever in and near\r\nEdinburgh in 1733, a great prevalence of throat-distemper with scarlet or\r\nmiliary rash in the North American colonies in 1735-37, and an\r\nill-favoured erysipelatous quinsy as well as an anomalous scarlet fever in\r\nBarbados, St Christopher, &c., during the same period, yet it was not\r\nuntil the end of the year 1739 that cases more or less similar occurred in\r\nLondon. The incident that first drew attention to the throat-distemper in\r\nthe capital was the death of the two sons of Henry Pelham, the colleague\r\nof his relative the Duke of Newcastle in the premiership[1266]. Horace\r\nWalpole, writing twenty years after concerning similar calamities in the\r\nfamily of the Earl of Bessborough, says that not only Mr Pelham’s two\r\nsons, but also two daughters and a daughter of the Duke of Rutland all\r\ndied together. Chandler, writing in 1761, says that he well remembered the\r\ndisease at the end of 1739. Early in 1740 he had in his own practice as an\r\napothecary two cases of children sick in one family; the first died, and\r\nas he was at a loss to account for the death, there being “something in\r\nthe whole of the case quite new and unknown to me,” he called in Dr\r\nLetherland to see the other, who declared that the child would die also,\r\nas it did. Letherland then spoke to Chandler of the death of the two\r\nPelhams shortly before, “of the alarm it caused all over this great city,\r\nboth from its novelty and fatality,” and of his own care and pains in\r\nturning over ancient and modern writers to see if he could trace any\r\nfootsteps of this remarkable and terrible disease: at last, after long\r\nsearch, he had been so happy as to discover the identical disease\r\ncircumstantially described in the Spanish writers[1267].\r\n\r\nThe identification of the English throat-distemper of the 18th century\r\nwith the _garrotillo_ of Spain in the 16th and 17th centuries was thus\r\nundoubtedly due to Letherland, so far as English learning was concerned,\r\nand he received due credit for it in the Harveian Oration at the College\r\nof Physicians on the first occasion after his death[1268].\r\n\r\nChandler thus described the state of the disease at its first breaking out\r\nin 1739:\r\n\r\n    “The first and common appearances are feverishness, sickness, vomiting\r\n    or purging; the proper and diagnostic signs which follow are an\r\n    ulcerous slough in some part of the fauces, discharging a fœtid\r\n    matter.... The nostrils are glandered.... From the absorption of the\r\n    fœtid pus, the blood is contaminated; crimson efflorescences and\r\n    small putrid pustules break out on the skin of the neck and breast, a\r\n    quick depressed pulse, with a tendency rather to stupor than violent\r\n    perturbations accompanying all, and, if not relieved, terminate in\r\n    delirium, languor, clammy sweats and death.”\r\n\r\nFothergill, whose name is so closely associated with the outbreak of\r\ngangrenous sore-throat a few years after, makes little of the earlier\r\nepidemic in London; besides the cases in the Pelham family and some others\r\nin the same part of the town, there were, he says, very few observed, so\r\nthat “the disease and the remembrance of it”--including Letherland’s\r\npriority--“seemed to vanish altogether.” The winter of 1739-40, in which\r\nthese cases had occurred, was one of intense frost and the beginning of a\r\ntwo years’ sickly period in which typhus in Britain, dysentery and typhus\r\nin Ireland, reached a height unprecedented in the 18th century.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn epidemic of Throat-disease in Ireland, 1743.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the dysenteries, typhus and relapsing fevers, attendant on and\r\nfollowing the famine, were hardly over when the plague of the throat began\r\namong the children. It was seen first in the summer of 1743 (an influenza\r\nhaving preceded in May and June), it raged through the autumn and winter,\r\nand was not extinct for many years after. There were but few instances of\r\nit in Dublin, but it was prevalent in the adjoining counties, and\r\nexceedingly so in Wicklow, Carlow, Queen’s County, Kilkenny, Cavan,\r\nRoscommon, Leitrim, Sligo “and perhaps many others, carrying off\r\nincredible numbers, and sweeping away the children of whole villages in a\r\nfew days.” The country doctors, who knew most of it, were not apt to\r\nrecord their experiences; so that the following account, which Rutty\r\nextracted from Dr Molloy, is all the record that remains of an epidemic\r\nconcerning which one would wish to have known more[1269]:\r\n\r\n    “It is peculiar to children, and those chiefly of from a month to\r\n    three, four, five, six, eight or nine years old. They commonly for a\r\n    day or two, or more, had a little hoarseness, sometimes a little\r\n    cough; then in an instant they were seized with a great suffocation\r\n    lasting a minute or two, and their face became livid; they have\r\n    frequent returns of these fits of suffocation like asthmatic persons.\r\n    The said suffocation is ever followed by one symptom which continues\r\n    till they die, viz. a prodigious rattling in the upper part of the\r\n    aspera arteria [windpipe] resembling that sound which attends colds\r\n    when there is phlegm that cannot be got up. It is scarce sensible when\r\n    they are awake but very great when they are asleep.”\r\n\r\nWhile there is little in this account to suggest the malignant\r\nsore-throat, and no mention of a miliary or scarlet rash, yet Rutty made\r\nno doubt that it was the malignant angina, comparing it rather to that\r\ndescribed by Starr for Cornwall in 1748 than to that of Fothergill’s\r\ndescription. He adds, from some other source of information, that children\r\nhad generally clammy sweats upon them, with foetor of the breath. Many\r\ndied in twenty-four hours; none lived above five days. Some had tumours\r\nbehind the ears, which mortified. Many had a prodigious weeping behind the\r\nears, which was very corrosive. A case is given of a child recovering\r\nafter a profuse sweat, which suggested diaphoretic treatment by warm baths\r\nand sack-whey. Swellings of the tonsils and uvula were not observed.\r\n\r\n    It will be convenient to give here what remains to be said of the 18th\r\n    century history of sore-throat in Ireland. In 1744 Rutty enters\r\n    “mortal anginas” in Dublin. In March, 1751, tumours of the face, jaws,\r\n    and throat, following an epidemic among horses in December, 1750. In\r\n    the spring of 1752 “the pestilential angina” made great havoc among\r\n    children. In the spring of 1755, “the gangrenous sore-throat” (same as\r\n    in 1743) was fatal to some children. In the winter of 1759-60 he\r\n    records “scarlet fever,” and a singular form of the same in May, 1762,\r\n    noticed under Influenza (p. 356). This must serve for the Irish\r\n    experiences, although it is far from satisfactory. But it should be\r\n    added that Dr James Sims, of Tyrone, who came to London afterwards and\r\n    there wrote on the Scarlatina Anginosa (1786), says in an account of\r\n    his Irish practice: “During all my practice here I have not seen one\r\n    instance of the malignant ulcerous sore-throat as described by\r\n    authors” (_op. cit._ 1773, p. 86).\r\n\r\n\r\nMalignant Sore-throat in Cornwall, 1748.\r\n\r\nDr Starr, of Liskeard, calls the Cornish throat-disease the Morbus\r\nStrangulatorius. Writing in January, 1750, he said it had raged in several\r\nparts of Cornwall “within a few years,” with great severity[1270]: “Many\r\nparishes have felt its cruelty, and whole families of children been swept\r\noff: few, very few, have escaped.” Cases given by himself belong to the\r\nyear 1748; and Huxham, who did not meet with it at Plymouth until 1750-51,\r\nsays that it had been raging with great fatality for a year or two before\r\nin and about Lostwithiel, St Austel, Fowey and Liskeard. In the account of\r\nthe Cornish epidemic the emphasis falls upon the affection of the larynx\r\nand trachea; while there are so many other symptoms enumerated, including\r\neruptions and brawny swelling of the neck, that it is clearly impossible\r\nto distinguish between exanthematous fever with sore-throat and laryngeal\r\ndiphtheria pure and simple. Starr says: “Dr Fothergill’s sore-throat with\r\nulcers and Dr Cotton’s St Albans scarlet fever are, in my opinion, but its\r\nshadows.”\r\n\r\nThe symptoms generally pointed to the glottis.\r\n\r\n    Agonized breathing for a time was followed by the spitting up of\r\n    jelly-like, glairy and somewhat transparent matter, mixed with white\r\n    opaque thready matter, which might resemble more or less a rotten body\r\n    or slough. The paroxysm returned, and the patient either died suddenly\r\n    or sank away gradually, and died worn out, with or without\r\n    convulsions. A plate is given of a whitish membrane loosened from the\r\n    velum by means of hydrochloric acid on a silver probe; it was not a\r\n    slough, but a strong tenacious membrane which would bear handling and\r\n    stretching without breaking. In the same case, the child’s father\r\n    afterwards pulled from the mouth a complete cast of the trachea\r\n    including the bifurcation of the bronchi, of which a figure is given:\r\n    “what sweated from it was as sticking as bird-lime”; he lived\r\n    twenty-one hours after this second cast was drawn from him and died\r\n    somewhat suddenly in his perfect senses. Such formations Starr clearly\r\n    believed to be the essence of the disease; but he gives many\r\n    variations of it. The train of symptoms was not the same in every\r\n    subject: “Some, I am informed, have had corrosive pustules in the\r\n    groin and about the anus, eating quick and deep, and threatening a\r\n    mortification even in the beginning [as Colden described for the\r\n    sore-throat in New York State]. Others after a few days’ illness have\r\n    had numbers of the worst and deepest petechiae break out in various\r\n    parts of their body: such I have not seen.” But he gives cases of his\r\n    own at Liskeard in 1748: “A child here and there had red pustules\r\n    which broke out in the nape of the neck and threw off a surprising\r\n    quantity of thin transparent ichor”; these pustules sloughed when\r\n    poulticed; in another case sloughs followed where blisters had been\r\n    applied to the neck and arm. Many had swelling of the tonsils,\r\n    parotids, submaxillary and sublingual glands. A few had oedema from\r\n    the chin to the thyroid, and up the side of the face. In one case, a\r\n    tumour of the fauces broke and yielded some ounces of coffee-coloured\r\n    foetid matter, to the patient’s relief and ultimate recovery. Not a\r\n    few had gangrenous sloughs in the mouth, which formed quickly. Some\r\n    had foetor of the breath as an early symptom, but others had it not.\r\n    Some were merely feverish and hoarse.\r\n\r\nWhen Huxham came to describe the disease at Plymouth a year or two later,\r\nhe laid the emphasis on other symptoms than those mostly dwelt upon by\r\nStarr, describing really a sloughing sore-throat with rash. But he has\r\nthis also: “The windpipe itself was sometimes much corroded by it, and\r\npieces of its internal membrane were spit up, with much blood and\r\ncorruption; and the patients lingered on for a considerable time, and at\r\nlength died tabid.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFothergill’s Sore-throat with Ulcers, 1746-48.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we have to overtake Fothergill’s history of the ulcerous\r\nsore-throat in or near London[1271]. It broke out at Bromley, near Bow,\r\nMiddlesex, in the winter of 1746 (Short says that it was in Sheffield in\r\n1745). So many children died suddenly, some losing all and others the\r\ngreater part of their families, that people were reminded of the plague.\r\n\r\n    It began with a chill and rigor, followed by heat. The throat became\r\n    sore, and there were nausea, vomiting and purging. The face turned red\r\n    and swollen, the eyes were inflamed and watery, the patient was\r\n    restless, anxious and prostrated. The seizure was often in the\r\n    forenoon, and in all cases the symptoms became much worse towards\r\n    night, to be relieved by a sweat in the morning, as in an intermittent\r\n    fever. The uvula, tonsils, velum, inside of the cheeks, and the\r\n    pharynx, were florid red, with a broad spot or patch, irregular in\r\n    figure, of pale white colour like the blanched appearance of the gums\r\n    when they have been pressed by the finger. Usually on the second day\r\n    of the disease, the face, neck, breast and hands to the tips of the\r\n    fingers became of a deep erysipelatous colour with perceptible\r\n    swelling, the fingers in particular being often of so characteristic a\r\n    tint as at once to suggest an examination of the throat. A great\r\n    number of small pimples, of a deeper red than the skin around them,\r\n    appear on the arms and other parts; they are larger and more prominent\r\n    in those subjects, and in those parts of the same subject, where the\r\n    redness is least intense, which is generally on the arms, the breast,\r\n    and lower extremities. With the coming out of this rash, the sickness,\r\n    vomiting and purging cease. The white spot or spots on the throat are\r\n    now seen to be sloughs; they come first usually in the angles above\r\n    the tonsils. They are not formed of any foreign matter covering the\r\n    parts but are real mortifications of substance leaving an ulcer with\r\n    corrosive discharge behind. The nocturnal exacerbation now takes the\r\n    form of delirium and incoherent talking. The parotids are commonly\r\n    swelled and painful; and if the disease be violent, the neck and\r\n    throat are surrounded with a large oedematous tumour threatening\r\n    suffocation. The pulse is 120, perhaps hard and small. The urine is at\r\n    first crude and pale like whey; afterwards it is more yellow, as if\r\n    from bile; and towards recovery it is turbid and deposits a\r\n    “farinaceous” sediment. The initial purging having ceased, the bowels\r\n    become irregular. The disease had no crisis, but in general, if the\r\n    patient were to recover, the amendment began on the third, fourth or\r\n    fifth day, when the redness disappeared and the sloughs in the throat\r\n    were cast off.\r\n\r\nSuch is the main outline; the following symptoms have less general value.\r\n\r\n    At the outset, the patient complained of a putrid smell in the throat\r\n    and nostrils, which caused nausea. The nostrils were often inflamed,\r\n    yielding a sanies, and the inside of the lips covered with vesicles\r\n    filled with an excoriating ichor. Some had the parts about the anus\r\n    excoriated. Fothergill was inclined to think that either the\r\n    excoriations or the ichor from them extended down the whole intestinal\r\n    tract, and accounted for the purging, with other bowel symptoms,\r\n    which sometimes remained for weeks after the primary disease and\r\n    caused death by emaciation[1272]. In some there was bleeding at the\r\n    nose, or mouth, which might be fatal; in one case there was a like\r\n    accident from the ear. Several cases are given in which there were no\r\n    sloughs of the throat, but a dry glossy redness or lividity; in these\r\n    cases, there was a general brawny swelling of the neck, a coldness of\r\n    the hands and feet, involuntary evacuations, a glassy eye and certain\r\n    death. Three of Fothergill’s five briefly reported cases are of that\r\n    variety. In one of them, a boy of 14 years, he says there was “deep\r\n    redness of the face, hands and arms, with a plentiful eruption of\r\n    small pimples, which induced those about him to apprehend it was a\r\n    scarlet fever.”\r\n\r\nThat is the only reference to a possible diagnosis of scarlet fever in the\r\nwhole essay. In the New England throat-distemper of 1735, “scarlet fever”\r\nwas in like manner the name given by the laity, and disapproved by the\r\nprofession. Fothergill, adopting the erudition of Letherland, identified\r\nthe ulcerous or gangrenous sore-throat of London in 1746-48 with the\r\n_garrotillo_ of Spain in the 16th and 17th centuries, the famous\r\nthroat-plague of Naples and other places in Italy and Sicily from 1618\r\nonwards, and the “plague in the throat” mentioned by a traveller,\r\nTournefort, in 1701 as occurring among children in the island of Milo,\r\n(Douglass having already identified the Levantine plague in the throat\r\nwith the throat-distemper of New England in 1735.)\r\n\r\nAfter the outbreak at Bromley and Bow in the winter of 1746, the ulcerous,\r\nor putrid or gangrenous angina continued in London and the villages near\r\nuntil the date of Fothergill’s writing (1748). By credible accounts, he\r\nsays, it was also “in several other parts of this nation.” Short, of\r\nRotherham, a professed epidemiologist, says that the malignant angina\r\n“never left Sheffield entirely since the year 1745[1273].” Fothergill\r\nhimself, in his monthly accounts of the weather and diseases of London\r\nfrom 1751 to 1755, refers to the sore-throat once or twice; thus, in\r\nOctober, 1751: “epidemic sore-throat, in both children and adults”; and\r\nagain, in July, 1755: “The ulcerated sore-throat likewise appears in many\r\nfamilies, with the greatest part of its usual symptoms, but gives way\r\nwithout much difficulty, if no improper evacuations have been made, to the\r\nmethod heretofore recommended (XXI. 497)[1274].”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Scarlet Fever” at St Albans, 1748.\r\n\r\nThe same disease that Fothergill described for London and villages near\r\nwas seen at St Albans in the autumn of 1748, and described as “a\r\nparticular kind of scarlet fever,” by Dr Nathaniel Cotton, who kept a\r\nmadhouse there. Among his friends were the poet Cowper (at one time his\r\npatient), and Young, of the ‘Night Thoughts.’ Cotton himself had the same\r\nmelancholy cast of mind, and found the same solace in making verses, which\r\nhave probably served more to keep his memory green than his essay in\r\nmedicine[1275]. He professes to describe “a particular kind of scarlet\r\nfever” in his title-page; and in the text he has this remark: “From this\r\ndiversity of symptoms, I have found some practitioners inclined to think\r\nthat this disease could not with propriety be called a scarlet fever. But\r\nI imagine that such disputes are about words only.” It is, indeed,\r\ndifficult to find any real difference between his particular kind of\r\nscarlet fever and the “sore-throat with ulcers” which Fothergill wrote\r\nupon a few months before, or, again, between his scarlet fever and that of\r\nWithering thirty years after.\r\n\r\nThe sickness began about the end of September, 1748, in St Albans and some\r\ntowns adjacent. At first it attacked children only, afterwards also\r\nadults. The symptoms given are just those detailed by Fothergill, as well\r\nas by Douglass for New England:\r\n\r\n    Sickness with purging at the outset, rapid swelling of the tonsils and\r\n    (or) the parotids and maxillary glands, whitish sloughs on the\r\n    tonsils, small ulcers up and down the fauces, the eyelids puffed as in\r\n    measles, swelling of the neck, arms and hands in many, in some\r\n    swelling of the body also, intense red efflorescence, coming on either\r\n    suddenly or tardily, with thick spots as if dipped in blood. On the\r\n    face, neck and breast, the rash was even with the surface, elsewhere\r\n    it was miliary or shagreen. Some were restless or anxious, and\r\n    delirious, others so drowsy that when awakened to receive a draught or\r\n    the like, they relapsed at once into stupor. The attack, if not\r\n    violent, ended on the fourth or fifth day; there were few in whom the\r\n    fever did not return on one, two or more evenings thereafter, so going\r\n    off gradually. In one or two, the parotids swelled after the fever was\r\n    gone, continuing hard for a fortnight and then suppurating. In nearly\r\n    all, the cuticle peeled off “as in other scarlet fevers.” In some the\r\n    nervous system was much shaken; in particular they dreaded the\r\n    approach of evening with an unusual kind of horror, and started at the\r\n    shadows of the candles on the wall. In convalescence some complained\r\n    of universal soreness. The spots where blisters had been applied\r\n    continued to discharge in some cases eight or ten days or more.\r\n\r\nBesides the reference to swelling of the neck, arms or body among the\r\nearly symptoms, there is no reference to oedema, while the pallid dropsy\r\nof convalescence, which Withering described in 1779, is not mentioned. It\r\nis noteworthy that Cotton, who lays the emphasis on the scarlatina, and\r\nnot on the throat-disease, was of opinion that the copiousness of the\r\neruption was not a measure of the security of the patient, although that\r\nwas clearly the opinion of Huxham and others, who laid the emphasis on the\r\nsore-throat.\r\n\r\n\r\nEpidemics of Sore-throat with Scarlet rash in the period between\r\nFothergill and Withering.\r\n\r\nThe years 1751-52, and indeed the whole of that decade, saw a good deal of\r\nthe same diseases, after which little is heard of them until 1778.\r\nHuxham’s accounts for Plymouth, which are of the first importance, begin\r\nwith 1751[1276]. They are of importance because his memory went back to\r\nthe anginose fever of 1734, in which the miliary eruptions, with sweats,\r\nwere critical or relieving to the throat, and because he could not clearly\r\ndistinguish between them and the sore-throats of 1751-52, although he\r\nfollows Fothergill in identifying the latter with the Spanish\r\n_garrotillo_. The throat affection began in the end of 1751, and became\r\nmost severe in October, November and December, 1752, in Plymouth and at\r\nthe Dock and all around, carrying off a great many adults as well as\r\nchildren. It ceased in May, 1753. He describes the sloughing patches in\r\nthe throat, the excoriated nostrils with acrid dripping discharge, the\r\nswelling of the parotids and sometimes of the whole neck, just as other\r\nwriters had done; and gives the account of laryngeal or tracheal membranes\r\nalready cited (p. 695). It is perhaps more important to dwell upon his\r\naccount of the rash. Most commonly the angina came on before the\r\nefflorescence, but in many instances the cuticular eruption appeared\r\nbefore the sore-throat. “A very severe angina seized some patients that\r\nhad no manner of eruption, and yet even in these a very great itching and\r\ndesquamation of the skin sometimes ensued; but this was chiefly in grown\r\npersons, very rarely in children.” Commonly there was a rash, general or\r\npartial, on the second, third or fourth day.\r\n\r\n    “Sometimes it was of an erysipelatous kind, sometimes more pustular;\r\n    the pustules were frequently very eminent, and of a deep fiery-red\r\n    colour, particularly in the breast and arms, but oftentimes they were\r\n    very small and might be better felt than seen, and gave a very odd\r\n    kind of roughness to the skin. The colour of the efflorescence was\r\n    commonly of a crimson hue, or as if the skin had been smeared over\r\n    with the juice of raspberries, and this even to the fingers’ ends; and\r\n    the skin appeared inflamed and swollen, as it were; the arms, hands\r\n    and fingers were often evidently so, and very stiff and somewhat\r\n    painful. This crimson colour of the skin seemed indeed peculiar to\r\n    this disease.” The eruption seldom failed to give relief; but there\r\n    were also cases of an universal fiery exanthem which proved fatal. An\r\n    early and kindly eruption, when succeeded by a very copious\r\n    desquamation of the cuticle, was one of the most favourable symptoms.\r\n\r\nComparing it with the _febris anginosa_ which he had entered in his annals\r\nunder the year 1734, at a time when the ulcerous or malignant sore-throat\r\nwas still unheard of, he says that the earlier type differed from the\r\nlater in being more inflammatory, and less putrid; the sore-throat of\r\n1751-52 might seem to be a disease _sui generis_, but it differed from the\r\nanginose fever of 1734 only in the above respect: “In a word, the high\r\ninflammatory smallpox differs as much, or more, from the low malignant\r\nkind, as the _febris anginosa_ from the pestilential ulcerous\r\nsore-throat.” In the latter he found the remarkable evidences of putridity\r\nalready cited in connexion with putrid fevers[1277]. He gives the case of\r\na boy of twelve whose tongue, fauces and tonsils were as black as ink; he\r\nswallowed with difficulty, and continually spat off immense quantities of\r\na black, sanious and very foetid matter for at least eight or ten days;\r\nabout the seventh day, his fever being abated, he fell into a bloody\r\ndysentery, but recovered eventually. In a few the face before death became\r\nbloated, sallow, shining and as if greasy, and the whole neck swollen.\r\nEven the whole body might be oedematous in some degree, retaining the\r\nimpression of the finger.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be said that Huxham had really to do with two diseases; and\r\nhe does in one place say: “The anginose fever still continued, and we had\r\nseveral of the malignant sore-throats in September, many more in October,\r\n&c.”--as if the two were not the same. But he generalized the “epidemic\r\nconstitution” of 1751-52, in another way: “In all sorts of fevers there\r\nwas a surprising disposition to eruptions of some kind or other, to\r\nsweats, soreness of the throat and aphthae. The smallpox were more fatal\r\nin August, and sometimes attended with a very dangerous ulceration in the\r\nthroat and difficulty of swallowing. Indeed the malignant ulcerous\r\nsore-throat was now also frequent, probably sometimes complicated with the\r\nsmallpox.” Even pleuritic and peripneumonic disorders were attended during\r\nthis constitution with a sore-throat, aphthae, and some kind of cuticular\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nSome facts about the throat-disease at Kidderminster and other places in\r\nWorcestershire will complete this part of the somewhat perplexing history.\r\nDr Wall says it appeared about the beginning of 1748 chiefly in low\r\nsituations[1278]: “It then went generally under the name of scarlet fever,\r\nthe complaint in the throat not being much attended to, or at least looked\r\nupon only as an accidental symptom.” His first cases were at\r\nStratford-on-Avon--a young lady who recovered with difficulty, and then\r\ntwo sisters who died, all three having been treated by blood-letting and\r\nthe cooling regimen. By these cases Wall was convinced that the disease\r\nwas more putrid than inflammatory, that it was infectious, that the\r\nantiphlogistic treatment was a mistake, that bark was the grand remedy,\r\nthat the throat was the principal seat, and that the scarlet efflorescence\r\nwas rather an accidental symptom than essential to the disease, some\r\nhaving petechiae and purple spots. He adopts Mead’s name of _angina\r\ngangraenosa_. The malady had been rife in the city of Worcester, and most\r\nof all at Kidderminster, where it was in a manner epidemical. He was told\r\nthat nine or ten poor persons had died of it there one after another.\r\nHaving been called to the child of a respectable tradesman, he treated the\r\ncase with bark and the cordial regimen. He persuaded the Kidderminster\r\nsurgeons and apothecaries to adopt the same method, which they did with\r\nsuch success that, as he found afterwards in the books of one of them,\r\nthere were only 7 deaths in 242 cases of the disease, while Dr Cameron did\r\nnot fail once, and Wall himself had fifty recoveries and only two deaths.\r\nIt is said, however, on the authority of the parish register, that a\r\nhundred persons died at Kidderminster of the malignant sore-throat in\r\n1750, “in the months of October and November only[1279].” Dr Wall goes on\r\nto say that the “Kidderminster sore-throat” had a vast variety of\r\nsymptoms, the only certain ones being aphthous ulcers and sloughs on the\r\ntonsils and parts about the pharynx. “Very few here [which may mean\r\nWorcester] have had the scarlet efflorescence on the skin.” Dr Johnstone,\r\nsenior, confirms this in a measure for Kidderminster[1280]: “The anginous\r\nfever was not always, though often, attended with cutaneous eruptions; and\r\nthese, for the most part red, were sometimes also of the christalline\r\nmiliary kind.” And in writing again in 1779, when Withering’s scarlet\r\nfever was dominant in place of Fothergill’s sore-throat, Dr Johnstone\r\nsaid: “A scarlet eruption was a much more frequent symptom of this disease\r\nthan it used to be when I first became acquainted with it nearly thirty\r\nyears ago.” But, as it is known that the rash of true scarlet fever is far\r\nless constant in adults than in children, and as many of the attacks\r\nreferred to by Wall and Johnstone were in adults, the so-called\r\nKidderminster sore-throat may have been a fairly uniform scarlatina.\r\nStill, it is clear that all the leading writers, excepting Cotton, of St\r\nAlbans, distinguished between sore-throat (gangrenous, malignant, or\r\nulcerous) and scarlatina, identifying the former with the old _garrotillo_\r\nof Spain and Italy[1281]. The distinction may have been really between\r\nscarlatina simplex and scarlatina anginosa, as Willan believed; but\r\nwhether the disease were malignant scarlatina, or diphtheria, or a mixture\r\nof the two (as in Cornwall), or an undifferentiated type with the\r\ncharacters of both, it was certainly new as a whole to British experience\r\nin that generation, and, if we except the reference by Morton to certain\r\ncases which may have been sporadic, it was a disease hitherto unheard of\r\nin England since systematic medical writings began. We may realize the\r\nimpression which it made, both in the American colonies and in England in\r\nthe middle third of the 18th century, by recalling the sudden appearance\r\nof diphtheria some thirty-five years ago; but, whereas the diphtheria of\r\n1856-58 came upon a generation of practitioners who had seen much of the\r\nvery worst kinds of scarlatina for twenty years or more, the\r\ncontemporaries of Huxham, Letherland, Fothergill, Johnstone and Wall in\r\nEngland, or of Douglass, Colden and Bard in America, knew no scarlet fever\r\nbut scarlatina simplex. The outbreaks of the 18th century throat-distemper\r\nin certain families were of the same tragic kind as diphtherial outbreaks\r\nin our own time. Instances of whole families swept away have been cited\r\nfrom the New Hampshire epidemic of 1735. Horace Walpole gives the\r\nfollowing instance of a noble family in London:\r\n\r\n    “There is a horrid scene of distress in the family of Cavendish; the\r\n    Duke’s sister, Lady Bessborough, died this morning of the same fever\r\n    and sore throat of which she lost four children four years ago. It\r\n    looks as if it was a plague fixed in the walls of their house; it\r\n    broke out again among their servants, and carried off two a year and a\r\n    half after the children. About ten days ago Lord Bessborough was\r\n    seized with it and escaped with difficulty; then the eldest daughter\r\n    had it, though slightly: my lady attending them is dead of it in three\r\n    days. It is the same sore throat which carried off Mr Pelham’s two\r\n    only sons.... The physicians, I think, don’t know what to make of\r\n    it[1282].”\r\n\r\nThe medical accounts of the sore-throat of those years are none the easier\r\nto interpret in a modern sense owing to the frequent use of the term\r\n“miliary” to describe the rash. Douglass had used this term in the title\r\nof his Boston essay in 1736. Bisset applies it to a Yorkshire epidemic\r\nsome twenty years after[1283]. The disease began among adults at Whitby in\r\nSeptember and October, 1759, and spread over the country between the coast\r\nand Guisborough in the spring of 1760, as well as in some places to the\r\nwestward of the latter; afterwards it became epidemic in all the western\r\nparts of Cleveland in August and September of 1760, the summer months\r\nhaving been almost a clear interval. It was remarkable, he says, that some\r\npersons in the eastern parts of Cleveland who had escaped it when it was\r\nepidemical in the spring, were attacked by it in the autumn after it “had\r\ngot a good way to the westward of them.” This epidemic progression is\r\nspoken of as of a single but composite disease,--“the epidemic\r\nthroat-distemper and miliary fever that appeared in the Duchy of Cleveland\r\nin 1760.” In adults it was mostly an affection of the throat, few having\r\nthe miliary eruption, and only one adult dying “within the circle of my\r\nobservations.” But in children the fever with miliary rash was\r\npredominant, and of it the fatality is put at one death in every thirty\r\ncases. There is no discussion as between the names of scarlet fever and\r\nmiliary fever; but the following on the peeling of the skin is\r\nsignificant: “From the ninth to the thirteenth day the scarf-skin begins\r\nto peel off in cases that were attended by a copious rash; and that of the\r\nhands and feet sometimes came off almost entire.” Soreness of throat often\r\nhappened in this fever of children; and, to repeat, the sore-throat of\r\nadults and the miliary fever of children are described as parts of one and\r\nthe same epidemic[1284]. An account which probably relates to the same\r\ndisease comes from Rotherham or Sheffield in a letter by Dr Short, the\r\nepidemiologist, to Rutty, of Dublin. It was very violent, he says, in\r\nJuly, 1759, and cut off whole families of children. The attack was\r\nattended with diarrhoea, swelled tonsils, oedema of the face, an eruption\r\nlike measles all over the body, and a discharge of sanious humour from the\r\nnostrils. “In some there was an efflorescence on the skin like the scarlet\r\nfever, and these recovered[1285].”\r\n\r\nAnother complication arises owing to the prevalence, in the same period,\r\nof putrid or miliary fevers, which had sometimes an anginous or “throaty”\r\ncharacter. This source of perplexity extends from near the beginning to\r\nnear the end of the 18th century, but it is greatest in the middle period,\r\nwhen the “constitution” was most decidedly “putrid[1286].” The\r\nrelationship was most definitely expressed by Johnstone, of Kidderminster:\r\n“This malignant fever (_vide supra_, p. 123) was very often, though not\r\nconstantly, complicated with, and in general had great analogy with the\r\nmalignant sore-throat which at this time prevailed in many parts of\r\nEngland.” An Oxford practitioner, in 1766, actually wrote a dissertation\r\nto distinguish the “putrid sore-throat” which attended the “putrid”\r\ncontinued fever of the time, from the “gangrenous sore-throat” of\r\nFothergill, Huxham and others: in the former, the aphthae and sloughs of\r\nthe tonsils and uvula, as well as of the mouth, were only symptomatic of\r\nthe putrid fever, and late in showing themselves; in the latter, the\r\nthroat affection was the primary and dominant one, present from the\r\nbeginning of the illness[1287].\r\n\r\nThe last complication of the highly complex circumstances in which\r\nscarlatina first became a great disease in England is with “putrid” or\r\nmalignant measles. In the same years as the epidemic described above for\r\nYorkshire, namely, 1759 and 1760, there occurred an “anomalous malignant\r\nmeasles,” which for some months had made a melancholy carnage amongst\r\nchildren in the west of England. The symptoms were difficult breathing, an\r\namazingly rapid pulse, white or brown tongue, and “some red eruptions\r\nwhich run in irregular groups and splatches on the surface of the skin.”\r\nThe attack was apt to be attended by colliquative diarrhoea. A fatal issue\r\nwas indicated by a sunken and very quick pulse, the abatement of the\r\ndyspnoea, and the eruption coming and going. Some rapid cases in infants\r\nended in convulsions on the third day. Children from one to six years were\r\nattacked most[1288]. Perhaps the only reason for not including this among\r\nepidemics of measles is the author’s remark: “I look upon the poison of\r\nthe disease to be a good deal akin to that of the ulcerated sore-throat so\r\nvery rife and fatal some years since,” although he does not allege\r\nthroat-complications in the malady which he describes.\r\n\r\nThree years later, in 1763, there was an epidemic at the Foundling\r\nHospital, London, which Watson, the physician to the charity, described in\r\na special essay as one of “putrid measles.” Willan, writing in 1808,\r\nchallenged the diagnosis on the ground both of the symptoms as given by\r\nWatson, and of the names given to the malady in the Infirmary Book at the\r\ntime. The first entry in the apothecary’s book is on 23 April, 1763, a\r\ncase of “fever with a rash,” the next on 30 April, a case of “scarlet\r\nfever,” then on 7 May, ten cases of “eruptive fever,” and, for the rest of\r\nMay and all June, very long lists of “eruptive fever,” the name of measles\r\nnot occurring at all in that outbreak, while the names of “morbillous\r\nfever” and “fever” are given to a smaller but still considerable outbreak\r\nin November of the same year. Among the symptoms, Watson mentions that the\r\nfauces were of a deep red colour, that the rash came out on the second\r\nday, and that there was no cough. The most remarkable character of the\r\nepidemic as a whole was a tendency to sloughing in various parts:\r\n\r\n    “Of those who died some sank under laborious respiration: more from\r\n    dysenteric purging, the disease having attacked the bowels; and of\r\n    these one died of mortification in the rectum. Besides this, six\r\n    others died sphacelated in some one or more parts of the body. The\r\n    girls who died most usually became mortified in the pudendum. Two had\r\n    ulcers in their mouth and cheek, which last was so covered by them\r\n    that the cheek, from the ulcers within, sphacelated externally before\r\n    they died. Of these one had the gums and jawbone corroded to so great\r\n    a degree that most of the teeth on one side came out before she died.\r\n    The lips and mouth of many who recovered were ulcerated, and continued\r\n    so for a long time.” The anatomical examination of those who died\r\n    showed the bronchitic affection, in one case pleurisy, and in some a\r\n    gangrenous condition of the lungs. One died of emaciation six weeks\r\n    after the attack. Eleven others succumbed shortly after to smallpox,\r\n    out of eighteen who caught the latter during recovery from the\r\n    preceding epidemic disease[1289].\r\n\r\nLong after, in 1808, when the diagnosis between measles and scarlatina was\r\nfixed, Dr James Clarke saw at Nottingham in several cases of measles “a\r\ngreat tendency to gangrene,” the sites of blisters having mortified in two\r\n(as in scarlet fever) and two having gangrene of the cheek and\r\nmortification of the upper jaw[1290]. Huxham, he says, saw such cases,\r\nWillan never; and that was one of the reasons why Willan claimed the\r\nFoundling cases as scarlatina. The diagnosis is important; for, in the\r\nsame year, 1763, the bills of mortality record 610 deaths from measles in\r\nLondon, and Watson expressly includes the 19 deaths in the Foundling\r\nHospital (in 180 attacks) as part of the general epidemic in London.\r\n\r\nThe confusion between measles and scarlatina is farther shown by the\r\nentries in the Infirmary Book of the Foundling Hospital from the beginning\r\nto the end of an extensive epidemic in 1770: On 31 March, 23 children are\r\nin the infirmary with “measles,” and on 7 April, 37 children still with\r\n“measles”; on 12 May the long list is headed “measles and ulcerated\r\nsore-throat,” on 19 May, “putrid fever,” and on 26 May, “fever and\r\nulcerated sore-throat[1291].”\r\n\r\nWhether or not we agree with Willan in taking the Foundling epidemic of\r\n1763 (and perhaps with it the general epidemic in London) for one of\r\nscarlatina, it can hardly be doubted that the Foundling epidemic of 1770\r\nwas the latter disease, the names of “measles with ulcerated sore-throat,”\r\n“putrid fever,” and “fever and ulcerated sore-throat” clearly indicating\r\nscarlatina anginosa. Grant also records the prevalence of epidemic\r\nsore-throat in London in 1770[1292], and Dr William Fordyce, writing in\r\n1773, dealt with the “ulcerated and malignant sore-throat” as a question\r\nof the day[1293].\r\n\r\n    It was not until forty years ago, he says, that they had become\r\n    acquainted in England with ulcerated and malignant sore-throat, while\r\n    “both kinds” are now very common. His aim is to separate the ulcerated\r\n    from the malignant, and he instances an outbreak in a gentleman’s\r\n    house at Islington, where the worst symptoms of the malignant occurred\r\n    in the children, while only the ulcerous prevailed among the servant\r\n    maids. In 1769 it was reported to be seldom fatal in London and\r\n    Westminster, and in the villages around; but within these last twelve\r\n    months (1773) it had appeared of a bad type in high situations such as\r\n    Harrow, in the months of June and July. In a later note, he adds that\r\n    “it still continues to make a havock so considerable as to keep up the\r\n    alarm about it both in the metropolis and all over England,” his own\r\n    last experience of it having been two fatal cases in a noble family a\r\n    few miles to the west of London. Fordyce identified this disease with\r\n    Fothergill’s sore-throat, and described the eruption as “the general\r\n    erysipelatous colour that comes about the second day on the face,\r\n    neck, breast and hands to the finger ends, which last are tinged in so\r\n    remarkable a manner that the seeing of them only is sufficiently\r\n    pathognomonic of the malady [this is a repetition of Huxham and\r\n    Fothergill]; and finally a great number of small pimples, of a colour\r\n    more intense than that which surrounds them, appearing in the arms and\r\n    other parts of the body.” He gives the following as a case of the\r\n    malignant sore-throat in a young gentleman five or six years old:\r\n    “Every part of the body that bore its own weight was gangrened, as\r\n    well as the orifices where he had been blooded twice before I saw him\r\n    (which was three days after the seizure); the parotid glands were very\r\n    much swelled, the whole body was more or less oedematous, and the skin\r\n    throughout of an erysipelatous purple; he died the third day after I\r\n    saw him.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Fordyce, and probably most others, still adhered to Fothergill’s\r\nview of the sore-throat with ulcers as a disease apart, yet there appear\r\nto have been at this date some who followed the line taken with regard to\r\nit by Dr Cotton in 1749. Sometime about the end of 1771 or beginning of\r\n1772, a physician at Ipswich sent to a London physician, who sent it to\r\nthe _Gentleman’s Magazine_, an account of a “Successful Method of treating\r\nthe Ulcerated Sore Throat and Scarlet Fever,” by tartar emetic, calomel\r\n&c.[1294] He begins: “The ulcerated sore-throat and scarlet fever has been\r\nvery rife in this place and the neighbourhood for some months past, and\r\nhas been in a considerable number of instances fatal. It has in every\r\nrespect answered the description given of it by Dr Fothergill”--so much so\r\nthat he does not give the symptoms, but only the treatment, which, in his\r\nown hands, had been singularly successful: “I have had considerably more\r\nthan one hundred patients, and have not buried one,” his cases, between\r\nthe writing and printing of the paper (3 June) having “increased to near\r\nthree hundred with the same success.” This must have been an interval of\r\nmild scarlatina, during which the prevalence of the malady, however\r\nextensive, had attracted little notice. The outburst in 1777-78, from\r\nwhich the diagnosis and naming of scarlatina anginosa properly date, was\r\nobviously an interruption of a quiet time of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarlatina anginosa in its modern form, 1777-78.\r\n\r\nDr Levison[1295], who was physician to a London charity called the General\r\nMedical Asylum located at No. 4, Tottenham Court-road (afterwards in\r\nWelbeck Street), observed the outbreak, on 15 July, 1777, of a malignant\r\nsore-throat, “nearly such as described by Dr Fothergill and Dr Huxham\r\n(only without the efflorescence and attended with costiveness),” among\r\nchildren from three to seven years, by which many were cut off in the\r\nspace of six to eight days, some by suffocation and others by vomiting of\r\nblood. It became more general in August, and in some was very malignant,\r\nbeing joined with an erysipelatous inflammation and a diarrhoea. It raged\r\nwith great fury in Kentish Town, and at Enfield Chase it swept away many\r\nin twenty-four hours. But on the high ground about London, as at Hampstead\r\nand Highgate, it was of a benign type. It was worse in the villages round\r\nthan in the capital itself.\r\n\r\n    In the milder form, there was only a superficial whiteness of the\r\n    uvula, tonsils and velum; in the more severe, the same parts were\r\n    beset with thick ulcerations, running very deep in the fauces. Both in\r\n    the milder and in the more severe cases the neck became swollen on the\r\n    second or third day. The commencement was usually with shivering and\r\n    nausea, followed by heat, and an efflorescence over the breast, the\r\n    limbs, and often the whole body, of a crimson red. “Some were spread\r\n    over with a kind of little millets, similar to that in the miliary\r\n    fevers, and which scaled off the skin the sixth or seventh day; in\r\n    which cases the ulcerations were very slight, as also all other\r\n    symptoms of malignancy.” The mouth was apt to be full of sloughs, the\r\n    teeth covered with black crusts. The urine was scanty, high-coloured,\r\n    with a thin suspended cloud. Some bled from the nose. The nostrils\r\n    were apt to be stuffed with greenish sanies, which dropped out\r\n    continually. The efflorescence and sore-throat were often met with\r\n    separately. Most had cough throughout, great dejection of spirits, and\r\n    oppressed breathing. The disease had no regular progress and no\r\n    crisis; the whole of the symptoms would often cease suddenly about the\r\n    eighth or ninth day. In one case there was recovery after three weeks’\r\n    illness. Several cases had suppuration of the glands of the neck. In\r\n    one fatal case, a tumour behind the right tonsil was found to contain\r\n    three ounces of fœtid pus.\r\n\r\nOedema was frequent after recovery--the lips, nose and face bloated,\r\nsallow, shining and greasy; the belly also might be swollen. This, says\r\nLevison, was a peculiar kind of dropsy; and as he adds that it had not\r\nbeen remarked by Huxham he intends to distinguish it from the bloated\r\ngreasy appearance which Huxham did remark. Some died of it a month after\r\nthe fever; many recovered from it by the aid of calomel, rhubarb and\r\ndiuretics--the treatment for the scarlatinal dropsy--and full doses of\r\nbark. In the acute disease blisters were sometimes tried, in compliance\r\nwith custom; but they did no good, and occasioned a great discharge of\r\nthick matter. Bleeding and antiphlogistics were seldom called for. This\r\noutbreak, which began in July 1777, abated in November. Next year it came\r\nback about the middle of March, but in a benign form, and unattended with\r\neither the efflorescence or the diarrhoea, and so continued until the date\r\nof writing, the 11th May, 1778. Levison distinguishes two or three\r\ntypes--a malignant sore-throat at the outset early in summer, 1777, to\r\nwhich in autumn two other epidemics were joined, namely, on the one hand,\r\nscarlet fever (or miliary fever), and on the other hand, a purging like\r\nautumnal dysentery.\r\n\r\nThe second season of the epidemic in London[1296], the spring and summer\r\nof 1778, saw the outbreak of malignant sore-throat, with rash, in the\r\nMidlands. It appeared in Birmingham about the middle of May, and in June\r\nit was frequent in many of the towns and villages in the neighbourhood. It\r\ncontinued to the end of October, and revived a little during mild weather\r\nafter the middle of November. It seems to have reached Worcestershire in\r\nthe autumn, cases having been seen first at Stourbridge and afterwards at\r\nKidderminster and Cleobury. According to Johnstone, the younger, it broke\r\nout first in schools, and spread very rapidly among children, attacking\r\nadults sometimes. The summer of 1778 was remarkable for heat, which is\r\ndescribed as West Indian in its intensity.\r\n\r\nThe account of this epidemic which has attracted most attention (and\r\ndeservedly) is that of Withering, of Birmingham, who had written his\r\nthesis at Edinburgh twelve years before (1766) on _angina gangraenosa_. He\r\ncalls it definitely by the name of “scarlet fever and sore-throat, or\r\n_scarlatina anginosa_,” explaining that it was “preceded by some cases of\r\nthe true ulcerated sore-throat,” by which he meant the disease described\r\nby Fothergill in 1748. The elder Johnstone, then of Worcester, who had\r\ndescribed the Kidderminster sore-throat of 1750-51, declared that the\r\nscarlet eruption was a more common symptom of this 1778 disease than it\r\nused to be when he first became acquainted with it near thirty years\r\nbefore; and dealing with the same epidemic as Withering, he makes out\r\nthree varieties:--namely, first the scarlatina simplex of Sydenham, with\r\nno sore-throat, second, the scarlatina anginosa, and third, the ulcerated\r\nsore-throat[1297]. His son, who also wrote upon the epidemic of 1778 as he\r\nsaw it at Worcester, having written his Edinburgh thesis upon malignant\r\nsore-throat several years before, says: “The disease which now prevails is\r\nthe ulcerous malignant sore-throat, combined with the scarlet fever of\r\nSydenham[1298].” Saunders, a retired East Indian surgeon, described the\r\ncorresponding epidemic in the north of Scotland as one of sore-throat and\r\nfever[1299].\r\n\r\nWithering’s account of the symptoms differs little from that given by\r\nLevison the year before, and is chiefly noteworthy for confirming that\r\nwriter as to the occurrence of scanty urine and oedema[1300]:\r\n\r\n    The rash came out on the third day, continued scarlet, the colour of a\r\n    boiled lobster, for two or three days, then turned to brown colour,\r\n    and desquamated in small branny scales. He had been told of three\r\n    instances in which the desquamation was so complete that even the\r\n    nails separated from the fingers. In the colder weather of October the\r\n    scarlet colour was less frequent and less permanent. Many had no\r\n    appearance of it at all; while others, especially adults, had on\r\n    tender parts of the skin a very few minute red pimples crowned with\r\n    white pellucid heads. The worst cases fell into delirium at the\r\n    outset, had the scarlet rash on the first or second day, and might die\r\n    as early as the second day; if they survived, the rash turned to\r\n    brown, and they would lie prostrate for several days, nothing seeming\r\n    to afford them any relief. “At length a clear amber-coloured matter\r\n    discharges in great quantities from the nostrils, or the ears, or\r\n    both, and continues so to discharge for many days. Sometimes this\r\n    discharge has more the appearance of pus mixed with mucus. Under these\r\n    circumstances, when the patients do recover, it is very slowly; but\r\n    they generally linger for a month or six weeks from the first attack,\r\n    and die at length of extreme debility.” These discharges, compared by\r\n    a writer a generation before to glandered secretions, are not to be\r\n    confused, says Withering, with the matter from abscesses on both sides\r\n    of the neck, under the ears, which “heal in a few days without much\r\n    trouble.” The submaxillary glands were generally enlarged. Adults\r\n    usually had a ferretty look of the eyes, and sometimes small circular\r\n    livid spots about the breast, knees and elbows. Some had a succession\r\n    of boils. One man had “lock-jaw.” Most patients had the fauces,\r\n    particularly the tonsils, covered with sloughs, which separated and\r\n    left the parts raw, as if divested of their outer membrane. The most\r\n    troublesome symptom was exulcerations at the sides and towards the\r\n    root of the tongue; these were painful and made it impossible to\r\n    swallow solid food. Some threw out several white ash-coloured sloughs,\r\n    though no such sloughs were visible upon inspecting the throat.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the diagnosis between scarlatina anginosa and angina\r\ngangraenosa (of Fothergill) Withering says: “They are both epidemic, they\r\nare both contagious; the mode of seizure, the first appearances in the\r\nthroat, are nearly the same in both; a red efflorescence upon the skin, a\r\ngreat tendency to delirium and a frequent small unsteady pulse are\r\nlikewise common to both. With features so strikingly alike, and these,\r\ntoo, of the most obvious kind, is it to be wondered that many\r\npractitioners considered them the same disease?” And again: “But perhaps\r\nhe will never be able precisely to draw the line where the light begins\r\nand where the penumbra ends[1301].”\r\n\r\nThe extent of the epidemic of scarlatinal sore-throat, of which we have\r\nparticulars from Middlesex, Warwickshire and Worcestershire in 1778,\r\ncannot be ascertained. It is heard of, as we saw, in the north of Scotland\r\nin 1777. According to Barker, of Coleshill, the scarlet fever which “in a\r\nmanner raged in the neighbouring town of Birmingham,” occurred in only a\r\nfew cases in his own parish, and these mild[1302]. It appears to have been\r\nin Carlisle the year after, 1779, under which date Heysham says that “two\r\nepidemics swept off a great number of children--smallpox and a species of\r\nscarlet fever[1303].” Nothing more is heard of it in Carlisle for the next\r\neight years, during which Heysham kept an account of the diseases. The\r\nepidemic of 1778-9 fell also upon Newcastle:\r\n\r\n    From the month of June, 1778, until the 1st September, 1779, there\r\n    were treated 146 cases of “ulcerated sore-throat,” of which 18 were\r\n    fatal. The epidemic was at its height in September and October. The\r\n    ages were: under ten years, 98, ten to twenty, 25, twenty to thirty,\r\n    18, above thirty, 5. Dropsy followed in 23; 75 were mild scarlatina\r\n    and sore-throat, 33 were angina maligna. During the ten years\r\n    following, until 1789, only 57 more cases were treated from the\r\n    Newcastle Dispensary, of which 8 were fatal[1304].\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory of Scarlatina after the Epidemic of 1778.\r\n\r\nIn London, according to Dr James Sims, scarlatina with sore-throat\r\noccasioned a great mortality in the latter half of 1786. The bills of\r\nmortality assign only 19 deaths to sore-throat, while they give 793 for\r\nthe year to measles. But Sims says that “measles were not present in\r\nLondon during the whole year; at least I saw none, and I saw about two\r\nthousand cases in private and at the General Dispensary.”\r\n\r\nThe deaths from scarlet fever, he thinks, had been given under measles and\r\nalso under “fevers,” which were a large total for the year. The epidemic\r\nwas very virulent, going through families; many lost two children, some a\r\nlarger number; many adults fell victims to it who were supposed to die of\r\ncommon fever.\r\n\r\n    Sims’ first case was of a youth at Camberwell, in March, with scarlet\r\n    rash and sloughs of the throat. He saw no more cases for several\r\n    weeks, and then, on 1 May, he was called to a case of sore-throat in a\r\n    school at Hampstead; the illness was slight, and there was no\r\n    efflorescence; but in June there occurred in the same school an\r\n    explosion of scarlatina, twenty of the girls being seized within a\r\n    short time. It was in other suburban villages in the summer, but did\r\n    not enter London until August, after which Sims saw three hundred\r\n    cases of it; of some two hundred treated by him in a certain way, only\r\n    two died. The symptoms of the epidemic were the usual ones of scarlet\r\n    fever with ulcerated or sloughing throat. In November and December,\r\n    swelling attacked the face and extremities, which were painful but not\r\n    oedematous. The parotids were swollen. Several had the angina without\r\n    the rash; others the rash without the angina[1305].\r\n\r\nThe same epidemic in London was one of the early medical experiences of Dr\r\nRobert Willan, who gave some account of it in the volume ‘On Cutaneous\r\nDiseases’ which he published in 1808, shortly before his death[1306]. It\r\nbegan in the autumn of 1785, was superseded by measles for a time, and\r\nrevived again in 1786, to last into 1787. It was most malignant in the\r\nnarrow courts, alleys and close crowded streets of London, but existed\r\nalso in the villages near. While admitting the existence of measles in the\r\nwinter of 1785-86, he confirms Sims in saying that it was not measles (as\r\nin the Bills) but scarlatina that caused the high mortality in 1786: “The\r\ncases of scarlatina during the year 1786 exceeded in number the sum of all\r\nother febrile diseases within the same period.” The deaths were mostly\r\nbetween the seventh and eighteenth day of the fever. The following is his\r\nclassification of over two hundred cases seen by himself:\r\n\r\n    1786\r\n\r\n                 Scarlatina   Scarlatina   Scarlatina    Sore-throat\r\n                  simplex      anginosa      maligna    without eruption\r\n\r\n        April       --            3            --            --\r\n        May          6           10             2            --\r\n        June         4           12             1             4\r\n        July         2           11             1             3\r\n        August       1           17             4             4\r\n        Sept.        2           29             9            12\r\n        Oct.         3           24             5             7\r\n        Nov.         0           38            12            10\r\n        Dec.         0            8             5             2\r\n                    --          ---            --            --\r\n                    18          152            39            42\r\n\r\n    The infirmary book of the Foundling Hospital has long lists of\r\n    patients sick of “scarlet fever with sore-throat” in August and\r\n    September, 1787, as many as 76 being under treatment in one week, the\r\n    next week 39 sick of scarlet fever, besides 45 recovering from it.\r\n    This is the first unambiguous entry of an epidemic of scarlet fever in\r\n    the Foundling Hospital records[1307]. Under the same year, 1787,\r\n    Barker, of Coleshill, records “scarlet fever, smallpox, and chincough”\r\n    in a neighbouring city, as well as pestilential sore-throats\r\n    “epidemical everywhere in the terrible foul weather of winter.” His\r\n    next entry of “scarlet fever and sore-throat” is under the year\r\n    1791[1308].\r\n\r\n    An account by Dr Denman, of London, dated 28 November, 1790, of “a\r\n    disease lately observed in infants,” but otherwise unnamed, appears to\r\n    relate to diphtheria. Eight cases in young infants were seen, one per\r\n    month from April to October, of which six proved fatal. The signs were\r\n    “thrush in the nose,” fulness of the throat and neck, the tonsils red,\r\n    swelled, and covered by ash-coloured sloughs or extensive ulcerations.\r\n    The skin sloughed at places where blisters were applied. Nothing is\r\n    said of a scarlet rash[1309].\r\n\r\n\r\nScarlatina (1788) and Diphtheria (1793-94) described by the same observer.\r\n\r\nOne good observer at the end of the 18th century, Rumsey, a surgeon at\r\nChesham, in Bucks, has left full accounts of two epidemics in his\r\ndistrict, one in 1788, which he calls “epidemic sore-throat[1310]” and the\r\nother in 1793-94, which he calls “the croup[1311].” The one corresponds to\r\nscarlet fever, the other to diphtheria. The author does not think it\r\nnecessary to enlarge on the distinction between the “epidemic sore-throat”\r\nand “the croup” as it was so obvious; yet the former was “Fothergill’s\r\nsore-throat,” which some English writers of the present time assume to\r\nhave been diphtheria; while the disease which Rumsey calls “the croup”\r\ncorresponds with laryngeal and tracheal diphtheria, not unmixed with\r\ndiphtheritis of the tonsils, uvula and velum. There is hardly anything in\r\nthe history of scarlatina and diphtheria more instructive than the\r\njuxtaposition of those two excellent descriptions by Rumsey, who grudged\r\nthe name of scarlatina to the former epidemic because the rash was not\r\ninvariable, and called the latter by the name of croup although it was not\r\nconfined to the larynx and trachea, and was epidemic in the summer months.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of “sore-throat” in 1788 began in April and lasted until\r\nNovember, attacking those of every age except the very old, but especially\r\nchildren, and mostly women among adults.\r\n\r\n    The throat was slightly sore for twelve or twenty-four hours; it then\r\n    became fiery red, the uvula and tonsils being much swelled. About the\r\n    second or third day there were whitish or yellowish sloughs on the\r\n    tonsils and uvula, which in many cases left deep, ragged ulcers. It\r\n    was many days before the sloughs were all exfoliated. Some spat up an\r\n    astonishing quantity of mucus; in young children there was apt to be a\r\n    discharge of mucus from the nostrils, and in a few cases from the\r\n    eyes. The parotid and submaxillary glands were often enlarged,\r\n    sometimes suppurating or sloughing. A white crust separated from the\r\n    tongue on the third or fourth day, leaving it raw and red. In some\r\n    cases there was sickness with vomiting, in some diarrhoea. In many\r\n    cases there was a scarlet eruption over the whole body, usually on the\r\n    second or third day. The fatal cases had all a very red eruption, and\r\n    the skin burning to the touch. In some the eruption was so rough as to\r\n    be plainly felt. In a few cases, after the efflorescence broke out, a\r\n    number of little pustules made their appearance about the breast,\r\n    arms, &c., of about the size of millet seeds, which died away in\r\n    twenty-four or thirty-six hours. This was not common; but in one\r\n    family the mother and three of the four ailing children had pustules.\r\n    One young man had large white vesicles on the sixth day; another young\r\n    man, in November, had vesicles on the arms, thighs and legs as large\r\n    as a half-crown piece, filled with yellow serous fluid, or gelatinous\r\n    substance, with a good deal of erysipelas round them. The red\r\n    efflorescence was always followed by peeling. Many had the\r\n    throat-disease without rash, but none had the efflorescence without\r\n    the sore-throat.\r\n\r\nRumsey decides against two distinct types of disease; it was the same\r\ncontagion acting on different constitutions; yet he could not help\r\nthinking that scarlatina anginosa was an improper term for it, inasmuch as\r\nthe rash was not constant. It was a less putrid disease than that\r\ndescribed by Fordyce in 1773 (_supra_, p. 707), and carried off but few\r\nconsidering the great numbers who were affected by it. Two of the\r\nfatalities in children were from the anasarca of the whole body, with\r\nscanty urine, which came on a week or two after. He bled only once,\r\napplied leeches to the temples in several, and saw many recoveries with no\r\ntreatment but topical applications.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic five or six years after in the same town in a valley of\r\nBuckinghamshire and on the hills for some six miles round was something\r\nunusual. Rumsey had about forty cases of “the croup” from March, 1793,\r\nuntil January, 1794; whereas his father, who had practised there above\r\nforty years, could not recall more than eight or ten cases of “croup” in\r\nall his experience. The cases were all in children from one to fourteen\r\nyears; there were sometimes three attacked in one family; most of the\r\nfatal cases occurred in summer; the epidemic was distributed impartially\r\nin the valley where Chesham stands and upon the hills enclosing it. Rumsey\r\ngives full details of seventeen cases, eight that died and nine that\r\nrecovered, with post-mortem notes for some.\r\n\r\n    His first case was in March, 1793; then came a succession of cases\r\n    about June and July, of which four that proved fatal were in children\r\n    just recovered from measles. All those earlier cases had the disease\r\n    coming on insidiously, then the peculiar cough and tone of voice, if\r\n    any voice remained, paroxysms of choking, expectoration of shreds of\r\n    membrane, giving relief to the distress, and the trachea found after\r\n    death lined with a coagulated matter[1312]. Among these summer cases\r\n    were three children in one family, of whom two died, both being just\r\n    out of the measles. The later series of cases in the winter of 1793-94\r\n    were less often fatal; the epidemic constitution, he says, became less\r\n    severe towards the end; he also used mercurials freely on the later\r\n    cases; but it is farther noteworthy that “most of the cases which\r\n    occurred in November and afterwards, were attended with inflammation\r\n    and swelling of the tonsils, uvula and velum pendulum palati, and\r\n    frequently large films of a whitish substance were found on the\r\n    tonsils”--so that the disease was in its extension more than cynanche\r\n    trachealis, or croup, even if it had not been also an epidemic\r\n    infection.\r\n\r\nIn only one case, the eighth recorded, does he seem to have hesitated\r\nbetween “the croup” and sore-throat: “ulcerated sore-throats being at this\r\ntime [6 Sept. 1793] somewhat prevalent, induced me to inspect the fauces,\r\nand I observed a swelling and no inconsiderable ulcer on the left tonsil.”\r\nIt was in the autumn and winter that these throat complications of “the\r\ncroup” mostly appeared; and it was because he found “so much disease about\r\nthe tonsils” in the tracheal and laryngeal cases that he forebore to\r\nbleed, and used mercurials. Also in the same season when “the croup” was\r\njoined to disease of the tonsils, uvula and velum, there was a certain\r\nepidemic constitution prevalent: “In the autumn, likewise, and winter,\r\nmany children suffered by erysipelatous inflammation behind the ears, in\r\nthe groins, on the labia of girls, or wherever the skin folded, attended\r\nwith a very acrid discharge”--precisely the complication of the\r\n“throat-distemper” of America described by Douglass and Colden as well as\r\nby Bard, also of the Irish throat-epidemic in 1743 mentioned by Rutty, of\r\nthe morbus strangulatorius in Cornwall described by Starr, and of the\r\nsore-throat described by Fothergill. In systematic nosology, do the\r\ncorrosive pustules behind the ears, in the groins, labia, &c., belong to\r\nscarlatina or to diphtheria?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps the same juxtaposition, or intermixture of scarlatina\r\nanginosa and diphtheria, that we find in the north of Scotland about the\r\nsame time of the 18th century. Various parish ministers who contributed to\r\nthe first edition of the _Statistical Account_ make mention of “the putrid\r\nsore-throat” about 1790 and 1791, without any reference to fever or\r\nscarlet rash. The following relates to three localities in Aberdeenshire:\r\n\r\n    New Deer: “In the autumn of 1791, a putrid kind of sore-throat, which\r\n    first made its appearance about the coast side, found its way into\r\n    this parish. Since that, it has continued to rage in different places\r\n    with great virulence and little intermission, and is peculiarly fatal\r\n    to the young and people of a full constitution[1313].” Crimond, a\r\n    coast parish: “The putrid sore-throat raged with great violence two or\r\n    three years ago [1790 or 1791] in most parishes in the neighbourhood,\r\n    and carried off great numbers: but though a few were seized with it in\r\n    Crimond, none died of that disorder[1314].” Fyvie, an upland\r\n    parish:--“There has been no prevalent distemper for some time except\r\n    the putrid sore-throat, which raged about two years ago [probably\r\n    1791] and proved fatal to several people. It has appeared this winter,\r\n    but is not so violent as formerly[1315].”\r\n\r\nFrom Aberdeen the epidemic is reported in a letter by one of the\r\nphysicians, in May, 1790, in such terms as not to imply that it was\r\nscarlatina: “The malignant sore-throat has been most prevalent and very\r\nfatal, no period of life being exempted.” In children from six months to\r\nthree years there was observed a livid appearance behind the ears which,\r\nin seven or eight cases, spread over the external ear, causing the latter\r\non one or both sides to drop off by sloughing before death[1316].\r\n\r\nThe scarlet fever, with sore-throat, which reappeared in London about\r\n1786-87 (and at Chesham in 1788) is said to have been somewhat steady\r\nuntil 1794. Willan, who began his exact records in 1796, says\r\nretrospectively that the scarlet fever with an ulcerated sore-throat had\r\nbeen prevalent every autumn from the year 1785 to 1794, “and proved\r\nextremely fatal[1317].” Lettsom gave a particular account of it in the\r\nspring of 1793[1318]; it was seen first in the higher villages about\r\nLondon, gradually descended into lower situations, and visited the\r\nmetropolis pretty generally about the end of February. “It has been\r\nremarked for many years that this disease appears in the vicinity of\r\nLondon before it visits the metropolis,” beginning often among the\r\nnumerous boarding-schools in the suburbs, to be carried thence by the\r\ndispersion of pupils to their homes. In some villages private families\r\nsuffered greatly; in a few Lettsom heard of half the children dying, as\r\nwell as of deaths among the domestics and other adults. The same epidemic\r\nof 1793 also called forth one of the numerous essays of Dr Rowley, who had\r\nwritten on the “malignant ulcerated sore-throat” in 1788[1319].\r\n\r\n\r\nScarlatinal Epidemics, 1796-1805.\r\n\r\nThe history of scarlatina in London, as of most epidemic maladies, is\r\nenriched for a few years by Willan’s monthly or quarterly accounts of the\r\ncases treated at the Carey Street Dispensary. From the beginning of 1796\r\nto the end of 1800, scarlet fever is hardly ever wanting, and is\r\noccasionally the principal epidemic. It is only now and then, however,\r\nthat a death from it appears in the Parish Clerks’ bills of mortality.\r\nWillan remarks that they gave only one death from that cause between the\r\n8th and 29th November, 1796, “a period during which there occurred many\r\nfatal cases of that disease.” The bills have only three deaths from it in\r\nthe quarter 27 Sept.-27 Dec. 1796. The Parish Clerks did not adopt scarlet\r\nfever fully into their classification until 1830; long after it had become\r\nan important factor in the mortality, they placed the deaths from it under\r\n“fevers” or under “measles.” According to Willan’s experience, it must\r\nhave been as common as measles from 1796 to 1801. It was, he says, always\r\nmost virulent and dangerous in the month of October and November, but\r\ngenerally ceased on the first appearance of frost. He records a spring\r\nepidemic as an exceptional thing in 1797: “Since the beginning of May, the\r\nscarlatina anginosa has become more frequent than any other contagious\r\ndisease, both in town and in many parts of the country; the disease has\r\ngenerally occurred in its malignant and fatal form, which, at this season\r\nof the year, is very unusual.” The bills give only one death from 18th\r\nApril to 18th May. Willan says that it was rife again in the autumn of\r\n1797 and of 1798. Dr James Sims, who had described the scarlatina of\r\nLondon in 1786, found the epidemic in the end of 1798 so different from\r\nthe former, and attended with so great fatality, that he made it the\r\nsubject of a second paper[1320]. It was preceded in the winter and spring\r\nof 1797-98 by a remarkable epidemic among the cats of London (an angina,\r\nwith sanious discharge from the nostrils and running at the eyes), which\r\nkilled “myriads” of them[1321]. In Sept.-Oct. 1798, he heard that a\r\nscarlet fever had been fatal to some adults about South Lambeth, and\r\nafterwards to several children there, five dying in one family and three\r\nin another. The swellings on each side under the jaw were so great as to\r\nforce the chin up into the horizontal; there was much acrid foetid\r\ndischarge from the nostrils, the pulse sank about the seventh day, and the\r\nscarlet eruption remained out until near death, which took place usually\r\nabout the ninth or tenth day. Along with this malignant type, a mild or\r\nsimple scarlatina was also prevalent. Sims wrote when the epidemic seemed\r\nto be “in its infancy,” and so it proved; for Willan describes it as\r\nprevailing to the end of 1798 and rising still higher in the first months\r\nof 1799, his report for February and March being: “Scarlatina anginosa in\r\nits malignant form has been very prevalent, and has proved in many\r\ninstances fatal; and in those who recovered, it produced after the\r\ncessation of the fever, anasarca, swelling of the abdomen, swelling of the\r\nlips and parotid glands, strumous ophthalmia, with an eruption of the\r\nfavus, and hectical symptoms of long duration. The disease spread from\r\nLondon to the adjacent villages, and was almost universal in Somers Town\r\nduring the month of February.” It continued throughout the year, and into\r\n1800, being second in importance among the epidemic maladies only to\r\ntyphus, which, in that time of distress, was the grand trouble of the\r\npoorer classes in London. Willan’s reports cease with the year 1800; but\r\nit appears from other sources that a very malignant scarlet fever and\r\nsore-throat prevailed in London in the summers and autumns of 1801 and\r\n1802, becoming milder in 1803[1322], and in various parts of England\r\nduring the same three years. The provincial accounts for those years give\r\nthe impression that this was the first general outbreak for some time,\r\nperhaps since the one described by Withering and others in 1778; and that\r\nis also suggested by the statistics of the Newcastle Dispensary: in the\r\ntwo first years of its practice, from 1 October, 1777, it treated 146\r\ncases, with 18 deaths; in the next ten years 1779-1789, it treated only 57\r\ncases, with 8 deaths; and from 1790 to 1802, it treated 152 cases, with 7\r\ndeaths[1323]. Accounts of very general scarlatina come from various\r\nparts of England. In the summer and autumn of 1801 it ran through many\r\nparishes of Cornwall, sparing others. In the parish of Manaccan, twelve\r\nout of the twenty-five burials in the year 1801 were from scarlatina--the\r\nmalignant or putrid form, which was often fatal before the third day. In\r\nmany other cases, the first untoward symptom was the dropsical swelling\r\nwhich came on as the fever went off. Three years after, in 1804, there was\r\nmuch scarlatina in and around Falmouth[1324]. In 1805 it caused 12 in a\r\ntotal of 20 deaths in Revelstoke parish, South Devon.\r\n\r\nIn Northamptonshire in 1801 it was observed “in a form similar to the\r\nepidemic described by Dr Withering[1325].” At Cheltenham in 1802 it was\r\nalso compared to the epidemic described by Withering: “in consequence of\r\nthe number of persons who have gone through the disease, it has for this\r\nmonth past (20th December) been gradually on the decline[1326].” At Derby,\r\nin 1802, it had been the prevailing complaint in the last eight months of\r\nthe year[1327]. In the district of Framlingham, Suffolk, in 1802-3, it had\r\nproved very malignant and fatal in many families[1328]. It is heard of\r\nalso from Lancaster[1329], and from various other parts of England, being\r\ncasually mentioned in reports on the influenza of 1803.\r\n\r\nTo this period also belong several incidents of a kind that had attended\r\nscarlatina from its first appearance, namely, school epidemics of it. One\r\nof these was an outbreak in the Quaker boarding-school for boys and girls\r\nat Ackworth, in Yorkshire, in 1803. Although many of the children\r\ndispersed, yet no fewer than 171, in a total of 298 on the roll, were\r\nattacked with scarlatina in the course of four months, of whom seven\r\ndied[1330]. In the same year Dr Blackburne published a treatise on the\r\npreventive aspect of the disease, with directions for checking the spread\r\nof it “in schools and families[1331].” It broke out in 1804 among the boys\r\nin Heriot’s Hospital, Edinburgh, and in the city generally in 1805[1332].\r\nFerriar makes mention of a “destructive epidemic of scarlet fever” in\r\nManchester in 1805, which he supposed to have been introduced from\r\nLiverpool[1333].\r\n\r\nThe general prevalence of malignant scarlet fever in the first years of\r\nthe 19th century is farther shown by the accounts from Ireland, which were\r\nrecalled by Graves in a clinical lecture of the session 1834-35, during\r\nthe prevalence of a scarlet fever as malignant as that of thirty years\r\nbefore[1334].\r\n\r\n    “In the year 1801,” he says, “in the months of September, October,\r\n    November and December, scarlet fever committed great ravages in\r\n    Dublin, and continued its destructive progress during the spring of\r\n    1802. It ceased in summer, but returned at intervals during the years\r\n    1803-4, when the disease changed its character; and although\r\n    scarlatina epidemics recurred very frequently during the next\r\n    twenty-seven years, yet it was always in the simple or mild form, so\r\n    that I have known an instance where not a single death occurred among\r\n    eighty boys attacked in a public institution. The epidemic of\r\n    1801-2-3-4, on the contrary, was extremely fatal, sometimes\r\n    terminating in death (as appears by the notes of Dr Percival kindly\r\n    communicated to me) so early as the second day. It thinned many\r\n    families in the middle and upper classes of society, and even left not\r\n    a few parents childless. Its characters seem to have answered to the\r\n    definition of the scarlatina maligna of authors.”\r\n\r\nThe long immunity from malignant scarlatina which Graves asserts for\r\nIreland after 1804, is made probable also for England and Scotland after\r\n1805, by the fewness of the references to it in medical writings. Bateman\r\nin 1804 resumed the regular reports on the prevalent diseases of London,\r\nwhich Willan had left off at the end of 1800, and continued them until\r\n1816[1335]; but he makes very few references to scarlatina compared with\r\nhis predecessor. The two occasions when it is said to have been somewhat\r\ncommon were in 1807-8, during the severe epidemic of measles (and then it\r\nwas “generally mild, presenting the eruption with a slight sore-throat”),\r\nand in 1814 when it was “very prevalent” along with measles. In Scotland\r\nduring the same epidemic of malignant measles, in 1808, scarlatina was\r\nonly occasional, and mild. It is heard of in its old malignant form from\r\ntwo localities of England, during the time of distress and typhus fever in\r\n1810-11. At Nottingham it was “very prevalent, passing through whole\r\nfamilies,” in September, 1810, and in October became more violent and\r\noften fatal[1336]. In the district around Debenham, in Suffolk, where it\r\nwas last reported by the same observer in 1803, it made its appearance in\r\nFebruary, 1810, in its very worst forms, causing deaths of children and\r\nadults in many houses, and destroying some children within forty-eight\r\nhours from the first attack. “All the surgeons for ten miles round have\r\nhad to attend to scarlatina maligna in a variety of cases in all ages,\r\nfrom infants to fifty and sixty years.” It was still raging in October,\r\n1810, and was breaking out “in different spots around this country, that\r\nappear to have had no communication with the afflicted[1337].”\r\n\r\nIt is not until 1831 that we begin to hear much of malignant scarlatina\r\nagain. But it is clear that scarlet fever was common enough all through\r\nthat interval, probably in its milder form. It was now the usual epidemic\r\ntrouble of schools. In September and October, 1814, there were fifty-five\r\ncases, mostly mild, in children and two in adults in the Asylum for Female\r\nOrphans at Westminster[1338]. In 1812 it was among the cadets in the Royal\r\nMilitary College at Marlow, having been followed by anasarca in only one\r\ninstance[1339]. Heysham, whose exact records of epidemics at Carlisle were\r\nmade twenty or thirty years earlier, mentions casually in 1814 that\r\nscarlet fever had been “more frequent of late,” but that it did not spread\r\nas formerly[1340]. Other references to it in this interval are to show how\r\nseldom fatal it was under the cold water treatment or the lowering\r\nregimen[1341]. At the Newcastle Dispensary fully twice as many cases of\r\nscarlatina were attended in the twenty-five years 1803-27 (795 cases) as\r\nin the twenty-five years 1777-1802 (355 cases); but in the larger total,\r\nwhich an increasing population might account for, there were actually\r\nfewer fatalities (30) than in the smaller (33); the highest number in any\r\none year was 71 in 1824, of which every one is entered as having\r\nrecovered. This is the impression derived from various sources--that the\r\nscarlatina from about 1803 until about 1830 may have been frequent, but\r\nthat it was mild, or easily treated, or not often fatal. Macmichael,\r\nwriting in 1822, not only testified that the “scarlatina of last summer\r\nwas very mild,” but argued that the malady in general was taken by many in\r\nthose years in so mild a form that it was not recognized as scarlatina, “a\r\nname that sounds so fearfully in the ears of mothers,” and a rare disease\r\nin families compared with measles or even with smallpox. His point is that\r\nscarlet fever was in fact as nearly universal as measles, but that, as it\r\nwas often extremely slight, it passed for rose rash or the like; at the\r\nsame time he identified these slighter forms with true scarlatina by\r\nsimply pointing to the oedema which might follow them[1342].\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Graves, of Dublin, who occupies many pages of his\r\n‘Clinical Medicine’ with the disastrous scarlatina in various parts of\r\nIreland about 1834, is conclusive that the severe type was new in the\r\nexperience of that generation:\r\n\r\n    “I have already mentioned that the disease called scarlet fever\r\n    assumed a very benign type in Dublin soon after the year 1804, and\r\n    continued to be seldom attended with danger until the year 1831, when\r\n    we began to perceive a notable alteration in its character, and\r\n    remarked that the usual undisguised and inflammatory nature of the\r\n    attack was replaced by a concealed and insidious form of fever,\r\n    attended with great debility. We now began occasionally to hear of\r\n    cases which proved unexpectedly fatal, and of families in which\r\n    several children were carried off; still, it was not until the year\r\n    1834 that the disease spread far and wide, assuming the form of a\r\n    destructive epidemic[1343].... Many parents lost three of their\r\n    children, some four, and in one instance which came to my knowledge,\r\n    five very fine children were carried off.” The severe cases were mixed\r\n    with others of scarlatina simplex. The violence of the attack lay in\r\n    the throat-affection, the congestion of the brain, or the irritability\r\n    of the stomach and bowels, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea being early\r\n    symptoms, as in the malignant sore-throat with rash a century before.\r\n\r\nGraves proceeds, with much candour, to show how mistaken had been the\r\nreasons assigned equally for the mild type of scarlatina between 1804 and\r\n1831 and for the severe type of it previous to 1804:\r\n\r\n    “The long continuance of the period during which the character of\r\n    scarlet fever was either so mild as to require little care, or so\r\n    purely inflammatory as to yield readily to the judicious employment of\r\n    antiphlogistic treatment, led many to believe that the fatality of the\r\n    former epidemic was chiefly, if not altogether, owing to the erroneous\r\n    method of cure then resorted to by the physicians of Dublin, who\r\n    counted among their numbers not a few disciples of the Brunonian\r\n    school; indeed, this opinion was so prevalent, that all those whose\r\n    medical education commenced at a much later period, were taught to\r\n    believe that the diminished mortality of scarlet fever was entirely\r\n    attributable to the cooling regimen and to the timely use of the\r\n    lancet and aperients, remedies interdicted by our predecessors. This\r\n    was taught in the schools, and scarlet fever was every day quoted as\r\n    exhibiting one of the most triumphant examples of the efficacy of the\r\n    new doctrines. This I myself learned--this I taught: how erroneously\r\n    will appear from the sequel. It was argued, that had the cases which\r\n    proved fatal in 1801-2 been treated by copious depletion in their very\r\n    commencement, the fatal debility would never have set in, for we all\r\n    regarded this debility as a mere consequence of previous excessive\r\n    reaction. The experience derived from the present [1834-35] epidemic\r\n    has completely refuted this reasoning, and has proved that, in spite\r\n    of our boasted improvements, we have not been more successful in\r\n    1834-5 than were our predecessors in 1801-2.”\r\n\r\nFrom 1829 to 1833 there are numerous references to the scarlatina maligna\r\nin England and Scotland: at Plymouth[1344] in 1829, Bridlington[1345] in\r\n1831, Baddeley Green, Brown Edge, and other places in Staffordshire[1346]\r\nin the summer of 1831, Beaconsfield, Bucks[1347], in 1832, Edinburgh[1348]\r\nin 1832-1833. It is in 1830 that scarlet fever begins to have a line to\r\nitself in the old and inadequate bills of the Parish Clerks of London, the\r\ndeaths that year being 94; in the next seven years they are 143, 388, 481,\r\n523, 445, 261 and 189. In 1835 we begin to have statistics of the deaths\r\nfrom it in Glasgow[1349] for five years, during which they fell much below\r\nthe deaths from either measles or smallpox.\r\n\r\n_Deaths from Scarlatina in Glasgow._\r\n\r\n        Under one  1-2  2-5  5-10 10-20  20-30  30-40  40 and up.

Probably the smaller mortality of\r\nGlasgow in 1837 and 1838 was general; for, when registration of the causes\r\nof death began in England and Wales in the latter half of 1837, it found\r\nthe scarlatina mortality at a much lower figure than it reached in 1839\r\nand continued to keep thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarlatina since the beginning of Registration, 1837.\r\n\r\nThe first returns of the causes of death under the new Registration Act\r\nhappened to correspond with a great epidemic of typhus fever, and with an\r\nequally great epidemic of smallpox which took its victims in largest part\r\namong infants and young children. The deaths from scarlatina were also\r\nconsiderable during those two years and a half; but in 1840 scarlatina\r\nnearly doubled its mortality, and continued year after year for a whole\r\ngeneration to be the leading cause of death among the infectious maladies\r\nof childhood. The figures for England and Wales are given in a table at p.\r\n614, in comparison with the annual deaths by smallpox, measles, and\r\ndiphtheria. The enormous number of deaths from scarlatina during some\r\nthirty or forty years in the middle of the 19th century will appear in the\r\nhistory as one of the most remarkable things in our epidemiology. There\r\ncan be no reasonable doubt that this scarlatinal period was preceded by a\r\nwhole generation with moderate or small mortality from that disease, just\r\nas it is now being followed by annual death-rates which are less than a\r\nhalf, perhaps not more than a third, of the average during forty years\r\nbefore 1880.\r\n\r\nThe first great epidemic all over England was in 1840 (it had reached a\r\nmaximum in London the year before), another came in 1844, a third in 1848\r\n(in which the London death-rate was 2·12 per thousand living). In the next\r\ndecennial period, 1851-60, the worst years for scarlatina were 1858-59,\r\nwhich were also the years of the return of diphtheria; in the period\r\n1861-70, the great scarlatinal years were 1863-64 and 1868-70; in the\r\nperiod 1871-80, the year 1874 was the epidemic year. The annual average\r\ndeath-rates per million inhabitants in all England and Wales were as\r\nfollows in four decennial periods:\r\n\r\n  1851-60      832\r\n  1861-70      972\r\n  1871-80      716\r\n  1881-90      338\r\n\r\nIn the greatest epidemic years since 1863 the death-rates per million for\r\nthe whole country have been:\r\n\r\n  1863      1498\r\n  1864      1443\r\n  1868      1020\r\n  1869      1275\r\n  1870      1461\r\n  1874      1062\r\n\r\nIn those years scarlatina made from four to six and a half per cent. of\r\nthe deaths from all causes.\r\n\r\nWhile no county of England has been free from this infection, the bulk of\r\nthe deaths have fallen upon the capital, the great Lancashire and West\r\nRiding towns, the Black Country of Staffordshire with Warwickshire, the\r\nmining districts of Durham and South Wales, and, in the earlier part of\r\nthe period, upon the south-western counties.\r\n\r\n_Highest Mortalities by Scarlatina in three Epidemics._\r\n\r\n                      /-----------\\     /-----------------\\\r\n                       1863   1864       1868   1869   1870      1874\r\n\r\n  England and Wales   30475  29700      21912  27641  32543     24922\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  London               4955   3244       2916   5841   6040      2648\r\n  Lancashire           4580   4854       4445   4890   3702      6404\r\n  West Riding          2218   3135       1676   2870   3718      3779\r\n  Durham               1216    403       2678   1512    983      1941\r\n  South Wales           501   1990        285    804   1370      1388\r\n  Staffordshire        1147   1134        943   1198   1064      1270\r\n  Devonshire            778   1054         60    155    646        72\r\n  Cornwall              995    572        254    161    587        50\r\n  Somerset              773   1013         55    154    584       173\r\n\r\nIn Lancashire and South Staffordshire there has been less fluctuation of\r\nthe mortality from year to year than elsewhere. The stress of an epidemic\r\nhas not fallen equally on all the principal centres in the same year or\r\nyears: thus Durham has had the epidemic in advance of other centres, while\r\nSouth Wales has had it in arrear. The decline of the south-western\r\ncounties from their leading position in 1863-64 has been remarkable.\r\nPlymouth, Devonport and Stonehouse, which had contributed most to the high\r\nscarlatinal death-rate of Devonshire in 1863-64, were found on the average\r\nof the next decennial period to have low rates from scarlatina, but\r\ndeath-rates from measles which were unapproached in any other region of\r\nEngland. In the following table four Devonshire towns are compared with\r\ncertain Staffordshire registration districts in which the scarlatinal\r\ndeath-rate has remained high.\r\n\r\n_Annual average Death-rates per 1000 living, 1871-80._\r\n\r\n                 All causes   Scarlatina   Measles\r\n\r\n  {Plymouth         22·63        ·25        1·13\r\n  {E.

The\r\nexcessive death-rate from measles in Plymouth, Stonehouse and Devonport\r\nwas due to a disastrous epidemic in the last two years of the decennium,\r\n1879 and 1880 (338 deaths at Plymouth, 121 at Stonehouse, and 235 at\r\nDevonport). Measles remained high in Plymouth all through the next\r\ndecennium, scarlatina still continuing low until the very end of it, when\r\nin 1889 there was a mortality of 270, equal to a death-rate of 3·39 per\r\n1000 living. In like manner Stoke-on-Trent had its great epidemic of\r\nmeasles in 1888, causing 342 deaths, or a rate of 2·8. The high Plymouth\r\ndeath-rate, after nearly twenty years with extremely little scarlet fever,\r\nwas surpassed in 1882 by an epidemic of 346 deaths in the colliery\r\ntownships of Aberystruth and Tredegar, Monmouthshire, equal to a\r\ndeath-rate of 6·1 per 1000. Other high death-rates for single years were\r\nat Wakefield and Swansea in 1889 and at Neath in 1890. The highest\r\ndeath-rates from scarlatina on an average of ten years, 1871-80, were at\r\nDurham 1·70, Todmorden 1·64, Auckland 1·63, Gateshead 1·60, Sheffield\r\n1·49, Leigh 1·41, Wigan 1·30, Newcastle 1·28. The purely agricultural\r\ncounties have the lowest death-rates[1351].\r\n\r\nAs to age-incidence, the proportion of deaths under five has been almost\r\nexactly two-thirds steadily for the last four decennial periods (supra p.\r\n625). The following table by Dr Ogle, the Superintendent of Statistics,\r\nshows both age and sex of the scarlatina mortality[1352]:\r\n\r\n_Mean annual Mortality from Scarlet Fever per million living at successive\r\nage-periods 1859-85.

This was only to be expected. But it was\r\nsomewhat surprising to find that more girls were attacked than boys, while\r\nthe fatalities among boys were more than among an equal number of girls at\r\nall ages until womanhood, when the few females attacked by scarlatina had\r\nmore fatalities among them than the somewhat fewer males of the same ages.\r\nA slight excess of fatality in the female sex over the male between the\r\nages of ten and twenty years, is shown also for smallpox by the table at\r\np. 618. Recent notifications of infectious diseases to medical officers of\r\nhealth have enabled a comparison to be made between the number of cases of\r\nscarlatina notified, with age and sex, and the number of deaths certified\r\nin the corresponding time and place to the Registrar-General; from which\r\nthe above generalities as to the proportions of fatal cases in the several\r\nage-periods of either sex have been confirmed[1353].\r\n\r\nThe enormous mortalities of some years may be taken to have depended in\r\npart upon an increased prevalence of the disease, but still more upon an\r\nincreased fatality among the subjects of it. Since the establishment of\r\nthe Metropolitan Fever Hospitals in 1870 the percentage of deaths to cases\r\nhas ranged from 15·3 in 1879 to 6·6 in 1873 and 6·7 in 1891. Among the\r\nsmaller totals of the London Fever Hospital the percentage of deaths has\r\nranged even more widely from year to year[1354]. What is thus\r\nstatistically proved is also a matter of common experience; there have\r\nbeen whole epidemics, extending perhaps over two or three years, marked by\r\nhigh malignancy, and epidemics just as uniformly marked by mildness of\r\ntype. The severe type has usually been made by the sloughing in the neck\r\nor throat; but there has also been a class of cases tending to a fatal\r\nissue early in the attack by a sunken pulse and with few external\r\nmanifestations. The cause of these variations in the severity of\r\nscarlatina is the old problem of epidemic constitutions: sometimes the\r\nconstitution is “putrid” or “pestilential” or malignant, sometimes it is\r\nmild or benign.\r\n\r\nGraves, in the passage above cited, has sufficiently exposed the fallacy\r\nof attributing changes of type to modes of treatment. On the other hand\r\nthere is reason to think that the percentage of deaths (by which the\r\n“type” is usually judged) is higher in children carried off to hospitals\r\nthan in those treated at home. As the same fact has been uniformly\r\nobserved in epidemics of Asiatic cholera, when the ambulances have been\r\nalmost as busy as those of the Metropolitan Asylums Board during an\r\nordinary autumnal rise of scarlatina, it is probable that the reasons\r\nwhich used to be given in the former case hold good also in the latter.\r\n\r\n_Scarlet Fever in London, 1890 and 1891._\r\n\r\n         All Cases   Treated    Treated in   Fatalities   Fatalities in\r\n  Year    Notified   at Home     Hospital      at Home      Hospital\r\n\r\n  1890    15330       8793        6537          348           510\r\n                                                or 3·95%      or 7·8%\r\n\r\n  1891    11398       6136        5267          232           357\r\n                                                or 3·8%       or 6·8%\r\n\r\nThis is a comparison of two parts of the same epidemic, which had a very\r\nmoderate fatality in any case. The real problem of malignity or severity\r\nof type arises over such epidemics as those of 1840, 1848, 1858-59,\r\n1868-70 and 1874, in which the doubling of the deaths, for one year, or\r\nfor two or even three consecutive years, had depended less upon an\r\nincreased number of seizures than upon a higher ratio of fatalities. An\r\nexplanation for each occasion will have to be sought either in the\r\ncondition of the patients, or in the inherent properties or external\r\nfavouring circumstances of the virus. As to the former, the most fatal\r\nepidemic years of scarlet fever have not been marked in any such uniform\r\nway as the great seasons of typhus or relapsing fever; nor is scarlatina\r\nan infection that keeps mainly within the poorer classes. Among factors of\r\nthe external kind, a rainfall below the average has been thought a\r\nrelevant thing: thus in the three years 1862-64, the annual average\r\nrainfall at Greenwich was only 20·6 inches, the scarlatina death-rate in\r\nLondon for the same years reaching the high figure of 1·33 per 1000\r\ninhabitants; in the next three years, 1865-67, the death-rate fell to ·56\r\n(it would have fallen in any case), while the rainfall reached the very\r\nhigh average of 29 inches; in the three years following, 1868-70, the\r\ndeath-rate reached the excessive annual average of 1·5 per 1000 in London,\r\nthe rainfall of the same period averaging only 22·3 inches. Thereafter for\r\na number of years the rainfall was moderate and the scarlatina death-rate\r\nlow; but in the years 1883-87, they were both low together, the scarlatina\r\ndeath-rate of ·26 being lower than it had ever been since registration\r\nbegan[1355].\r\n\r\nAlthough an empirical correspondence between the great scarlatina periods\r\nand a series of dry years has not been made out without important\r\nexceptions, hitherto unexplained, yet there is a very obvious\r\ncorrespondence between the great rise of scarlatina deaths in London every\r\nyear and the season of late autumn, which is the season when the\r\nground-water touches its lowest level or begins to rise therefrom to the\r\nhigh water-mark of spring. Of all the curves of seasonal rise and fall\r\nconstructed by Buchan and Mitchell from the weekly bills of mortality in\r\nLondon from 1845 to 1874, that of scarlatina is the most decided next to\r\nthat of infantile diarrhoea, the deaths rising in October and November far\r\nabove the mean line of the year, and falling farthest below the mean in\r\nspring and early summer[1356]. This was an old observation--by Sydenham\r\nfor the scarlatina simplex of that age, by Willan in the end of the 18th\r\ncentury (one or two spring epidemics being remarked upon as exceptional).\r\nIt is a very curious fact, and one that is as certain (for London at\r\nleast) as it is curious. Sydenham explained it by the doctrine of his\r\ntime, that the favouring things were in the human body, namely, some\r\nsusceptibility of the humours owing to the heat of the preceding summer;\r\nbut, according to modern views, it should bring scarlatina into the same\r\nclass with the soil-poisons of enteric fever, yellow fever and cholera,\r\nwhich are believed to become more rife owing to the greater activity of\r\ntheir respective miasmatic viruses when the pores of the ground are\r\noccupied to the greatest depth with air in place of water.\r\n\r\nIt would be singular indeed if, after all, we should have to include\r\nscarlatina among the miasmatic diseases; for it is an exquisite instance\r\nof an infection which is passed from person to person, or by the agency of\r\nvolatile contagion, or by fomites in clothes, bed-linen, house-furnishings\r\nand the like. The controversy which has raged so keenly in the past\r\nbetween contagionists and non-contagionists over the instances of plague,\r\nyellow fever and Asiatic cholera, would become still more keen over\r\nscarlatina--and be still more confused if it were not stated in more\r\ncorrect terms at the outset. What we all find so hard to learn is, that\r\nthe one way of infection does not exclude the other. Plague was for the\r\nmost part a miasmatic infection in the air of a plague-stricken town; but\r\nit could be conveyed in clothes or bales, while it was prudent to remain\r\nnot too long in the company of a plague-patient. In like manner contagion\r\nfrom the person was, as Rush said and Blane confirmed, a “contingency” in\r\nyellow fever; and there are some authentic cases of Asiatic cholera which\r\ncannot well be explained except on the hypothesis of contact with the\r\npersons of those sick or dead of the disease. Scarlatina is more\r\ncontagious than any of these, because it shows so much on the surface of\r\nthe body and scatters its infective matter into the atmosphere of a room\r\nwith the fine scales or dust of desquamation. Still, there are conditions\r\nfor the contagiousness of scarlatina, just as there are for the rarer\r\nevent of contagion from the persons of the sick in the plague, yellow\r\nfever and cholera. It is a remarkable fact that scarlet fever should ever\r\nbe sporadic, or that a single case should appear in the midst of a crowded\r\npopulation (as I have seen in a coast town filled with strangers during\r\nthe herring fishery to the extent of one-half more than its usual\r\nnumbers), and no other cases follow for months after, although there had\r\nbeen not the smallest attempt at isolation. Every medical practitioner\r\nknows, if some laymen and legislators do not, that scarlatina is sometimes\r\nhighly contagious, and sometimes hardly contagious at all; and who can say\r\nwhether the mechanical routine of “stamping out” contagion, which certain\r\npersons pursue with more zeal than knowledge, may not be the means of\r\nturning a mere potency into an actuality? The tact of individuals rather\r\nthan the grinding machinery of an Act of Parliament is needed in dealing\r\nwith vagaries such as Willan thus describes:\r\n\r\n    “I have seen in numerous families one child have scarlatina without\r\n    communicating it to any of the rest; yet, perhaps, in the succeeding\r\n    autumn, several of them were infected by only passing near a patient\r\n    recovering from the disease, or by touching those who had a little\r\n    time before visited some persons affected with it[1357].”\r\n\r\nThere are two special forms of epidemic scarlatina which may prove to be\r\nfinger-post instances for the general pathology. It happens from time to\r\ntime in the surgical wards of hospitals for children, where many cases of\r\nsuppurating diseases (especially of the bones or joints) are aggregated\r\nand kept together perhaps for months, that groups of the patients acquire\r\na scarlet rash, or an erysipelatous rash, or a hybrid form of rash, along\r\nwith the constitutional symptoms of scarlatina. Whether it be from the\r\nsuppuration, or from the blood of operations, this disease must be\r\nreckoned a product of so-called “hospitalism.” It is not without\r\nsignificance that there may be an element of erysipelas in such cases.\r\nThey are probably cases of “blood poisoning,” in a double meaning of the\r\nterm--poisoning of the living blood by dead blood or by pus which is\r\nclosely allied to blood[1358].\r\n\r\nThe other special kind of epidemic scarlatina is that which has broken out\r\namong the inmates of houses supplied with milk from a common source. There\r\nhave been many such outbreaks, including one most remarkable instance in\r\nwhich a large number of guests at an evening party, who had partaken of\r\ncream with strawberries, were shortly thereafter attacked by scarlet fever\r\nat their widely scattered homes. There can be no question that milk, or\r\ncream, has been the vehicle of scarlatinal infection. The first hypothesis\r\ntried was that of scarlatina on the dairyman’s premises; the effluvia of a\r\nscarlatinal patient might have become mixed with the milk. In some\r\ninstances, it was actually shown that there had been a case or cases of\r\nscarlet fever among the dairyman’s children; but there were other\r\ninstances in which that could not be shown, and it was, of course,\r\npossible to refer the cases, where they did occur, to a common cause in\r\nthe milk used at the dairy and in the milk distributed from it. As more\r\nand more outbreaks of the kind came to be investigated, it was indeed made\r\nprobable that the infection had got into the milk from the cow[1359].\r\nSomeone threw out the suggestion that the cow suffered from scarlet fever,\r\nthe sign of it being soreness of the paps. Without taking seriously so\r\nrandom a hypothesis as that, we find much agreement as to the fact that\r\nthe cows, to which the contaminated milk has been traced, were affected,\r\none or more of them, with sore paps. In some cases the disease of the\r\nteats had been admitted to be the same as cowpox; in other cases that has\r\nbeen denied; in a third variety, a cow has had cowpox on one teat and\r\nsomething else on another. It matters little what name be given to the\r\naffection of the cow’s paps. All soreness of the skin of the teats has the\r\nsame effect so far as concerns the purity of the milk. Unless the milk be\r\ndrawn off by a catheter (according to a German practice), the paps are\r\nnecessarily made to bleed by being “stripped”; it has been admitted by\r\nmilkers that the blood, pus, and scabs are apt to become mixed with the\r\nmilk; and the discharges from the sore paps have actually been seen, by a\r\nscientific witness, to trickle over the fingers of the milkers into the\r\nmilk-pail[1360]. The contamination of the milk which produces scarlatina\r\nin those who use it is neither more nor less specific than that. The\r\ndisease is blood poisoning in the double sense of the term--poisoning of\r\nthe living blood by dead blood. Blood is a peculiar fluid, and so is milk.\r\nWhen the two come together the result is peculiar. Both are animal fluids\r\nthat curdle by some peculiar ferment-change in their constituents. Again,\r\nmilk is peculiar in its property of taking up organic effluvia; thus the\r\nmilk standing in shallow vessels has been known to acquire the taste and\r\nodour of tar from a tarpaulin in the adjoining farmyard. With such\r\nproperties of the milk, a small quantity of blood or pus in it will go a\r\nlong way.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that connects the scarlatina of surgical wards in children’s\r\nhospitals and the scarlatina of the milk-pail is putrefying blood or pus:\r\nthe disease is a septic effect of blood, just as a scarlet rash is known\r\nto be a toxic effect of very various drugs in peculiarly susceptible\r\nsubjects. The obviously septic varieties of scarlatina make but an\r\ninsignificant part of the whole; but they may be finger-post instances.\r\nThus, if we assume that the infection may be miasmatic from the ground as\r\nwell as contagious from the person, there are certain facts, or\r\nsuspicions, that will fit the hypothesis of putrefying blood. A theory of\r\nscarlatina was put forward in 1871, on the basis of observations near\r\nCroydon, that its virus came from the blood and offal of slaughter-houses\r\ncollected at particular spots to be used as manure[1361]. The first death\r\nin a recent small epidemic within the writer’s knowledge was of a\r\nschool-girl who lived just across the road from a slaughter-house. The\r\nseptic hypothesis of scarlatina might be made to include other corrupting\r\nanimal matters. Some practitioners have a suspicion that scarlet fever is\r\nbred in the atmosphere of a horse-mews. On the greater scale, others have\r\ntraced a connexion between the more signal outbreaks of angina maligna and\r\npreceding murrains of cattle[1362]. The animal matters which may become\r\ntoxic to man, in miasmatic or other form, are indeed many. If scarlatinal\r\ndrug-eruptions are any clue to the mystery of scarlet fever, we need not\r\nbe surprised to find a somewhat uniform disease-effect produced by a\r\nvariety of septic agents[1363]. But, in that hypothesis, the refuse of the\r\nshambles will merit most attention. This was thought the one great\r\nnuisance of London in the sanitary ordinances of Edward III., Richard II.\r\nand Henry VII.; it was then considered a danger to health in the measure\r\nof its offensiveness to sight and smell, but there may still be dangers\r\nfrom it which are subtle and unperceived.\r\n\r\n\r\nReappearance of Diphtheria in 1856-59.\r\n\r\nThe memorable outburst of epidemic throat-disease in Britain about the\r\nyears 1858-59 was part of a sudden uprising of the malady all over the\r\nglobe--in Europe, America, North Africa, India, China, and the\r\nPacific[1364]. It was only in some parts of France, and of Norway and\r\nDenmark, that “diphtheria” had been epidemic in the generation before. Of\r\nits novelty to nearly the whole British profession in 1858, familiar as\r\nthey were with the angina of scarlet fever, there can be no question. Its\r\nappearance among diseases coincided with the publication of Darwin’s\r\nhypothesis of the origin of species by natural selection; and it was in\r\nthe terms of that hypothesis that Farr, of the Registration Department,\r\nspoke of the phenomenon of diphtheria. New diseases, he said, “are only\r\nrecognized as distinct species when they have existed for some time.\r\nDiphtheria is an example. It obtains a distinct line in the Tables of this\r\nyear [1859] for the first time”--with a total of 9587 deaths. For four\r\nyears before that, it had been in a “provisional table” under the names of\r\n“diphtheria” and “cynanche maligna”; but in the general table, the deaths\r\nunder these names had been merged with the scarlatinal deaths. This\r\ninclusion for a time of diphtheria under scarlatina could not have been\r\nbecause practitioners had any difficulty in diagnosing the one from the\r\nother, but probably because scarlatina anginosa seemed the nearest\r\naffinity in the nosological system. Diphtheria in 1858 had no scarlet\r\nrash, and yet it was supposed to be the same disease that had made so much\r\ncommotion in England about the middle of the 18th century: “In\r\nFothergill’s account,” says Farr, “the symptoms are confused by the\r\nintroduction of the eruption of scarlatina into his description”--as if\r\nhis description had been a patchwork of his fancy, with some characters\r\ntaken from “diphtheria” and some from scarlet fever. The greatest of our\r\nnosologists, Cullen, had long before that separated “cynanche maligna”\r\nfrom “scarlatina anginosa,” but the separation was not made on the ground\r\nof absent or present rash. Both had the rash, the cynanche having, besides\r\na general exanthem, very distinctively the peculiar scarlet redness, with\r\nswelling and stiffness, of the fingers which Fothergill described, while\r\nthe scarlatina rash was “commonly more considerable and universal.” Both\r\nalso might have a discharge from the nose; but when the coryza did occur\r\nin scarlatina, “it is less acrid, and has not the foetid smell which it\r\nhas in the other disease.” It was really on the ground of malignancy or\r\nfatality that Cullen separated them. In forty years he had seen scarlatina\r\nanginosa six or seven times prevailing as an epidemic in Scotland, and he\r\nhad seen two or three epidemics of cynanche maligna. He had seen mild\r\ncases in the latter, as well as in the former; but whereas there would be\r\nonly one or two malignant cases in a hundred of scarlatina anginosa, the\r\nmalignant or putrid cases in an epidemic of cynanche were four-fifths of\r\nthe whole[1365]. On the other hand Willan, writing just fifty years before\r\nthe modern diphtheria made its appearance, maintained that “no British\r\nauthor has yet described any epidemical and contagious sore-throat except\r\nthat which attends the scarlet fever,” not even Starr, whose “morbus\r\nstrangulatorius” he held to be “the most virulent form of\r\nscarlatina[1366].”\r\n\r\nThe name diphtheria, which appeared for the first time among the\r\nclassified causes of death in England in the report for the year 1855\r\n(published two years after), had been given originally in 1826, with the\r\ntermination _itis_ according to the then Broussaisian fashion, by\r\nBretonneau in his account of epidemics at Tours in 1818-21 and at La\r\nFerrière in 1824-25[1367]. It was in January, 1855, or just before the\r\ndisease became general in Europe, that he changed the termination to\r\n_diphtherie_[1368]. This name was taken from διφθέρα, a prepared skin or\r\nhide, suggesting in strict correctness, a certain toughness and texture\r\nwhich were actually found in only a small proportion of all the\r\ndiphtheritic deposits or exudations or sloughing infiltrations in the\r\nfirst great epidemic and subsequently.\r\n\r\nThe interval between 1793-94, the date of Rumsey’s diphtheria or “croup”\r\nat Chesham, and the outbreak of diphtheria in England in 1856-59, affords\r\nseveral instances of the disease, some of which were contemporaneous with\r\nBretonneau’s in France, but were still called “croup” in this country.\r\nThese I shall merely enumerate in a note, passing at once to the\r\nbeginnings of the great outbreak[1369].\r\n\r\nThe first public notice of the reappearance of a fatal throat epidemic in\r\nEngland appears to have been in the Registrar-General’s third quarterly\r\nreport of the year 1857, when attention was drawn to the remarks by\r\nvarious local registrars (Thame, Billericay, Maldon, Liskeard, Truro and\r\nChesterfield) as to fatalities from “inflammation of the throat,” “putrid\r\nsore throat,” “malignant sore throat,” “disease in the throat,” and\r\n“throat-fever.” About this time it was also called the “Boulogne sore\r\nthroat.” There had been an epidemic at Launceston from 30 September, 1855,\r\nwhich had come to a height in August, 1856; several deaths had occurred\r\nnear Spalding, in Lincolnshire, in July, 1856, and the disease had been\r\nseen at Ash, in Kent, in November, 1856. When the registered causes of\r\ndeath during the year 1855 were classified (in 1857), “diphtheria” was\r\ncredited with 186 deaths, in the Supplementary Table then first\r\nintroduced, “cynanche maligna” having 199 deaths. The following shows the\r\nprogress of the epidemic during the four first years, and the mode of\r\nentry:\r\n\r\n                                Scarlatina (inclusive\r\n        Cynanche                of columns 1 and 2 in\r\n  Year   maligna   Diphtheria   the general table)\r\n\r\n  1855    199         186            17,314\r\n  1856    374         229            14,160\r\n  1857   1273         310            14,229\r\n  1858   1770        4836            30,317\r\n\r\nIn 1857 and 1858 the deaths from croup were above the average, and\r\nprobably included some of the new disease.\r\n\r\nAccounts of the epidemic began to come into the medical journals[1370]\r\nfrom various localities in the course of 1858,--from Lincolnshire, Essex,\r\nKent, Sussex, etc. A systematic inquiry, conducted by Greenhow and\r\nSanderson for the Medical Department, under the direction of Simon, gave\r\nan exact picture of the several degrees of throat-distemper that\r\nconstituted the epidemic in the year 1858, in certain of the more severely\r\nvisited centres of Lincolnshire, South Staffordshire, Cornwall, Kent, and\r\nother counties[1371]. The numerous cases of throat disease occurred often\r\nin the midst of scarlatina, but sometimes also where there was no\r\nscarlatina. One of the worst centres was in and around Spalding, a market\r\ntown situated in a flat grazing country within the fen district of\r\nLincolnshire. A thousand cases were counted in and near Spalding, many of\r\nthem mild, a small ratio of them gangrenous and mortal; one practitioner\r\nhad 200 cases with 5 deaths, another 200 cases with 2 deaths, another 160\r\ncases with 17 deaths (of 65 tabulated with 9 deaths, which occurred in 35\r\nhouses, the first four all died from gangrene in June, 1858). The doctor\r\nat Pinchbeck, in the same district, had some 500 cases of which 300\r\noccurred in the space of about six weeks; most of the 19 deaths in his\r\nextensive series happened in the first cases (this was observed also in\r\nthe New Hampshire epidemic of 1735). At Launceston, in Cornwall, there\r\nwere about a thousand cases known, the height of the epidemic having been\r\nin the summer and autumn of 1856; among 126 taken as they came in 98\r\nfamilies, 18 died. The mildest and the most severe cases were equally\r\nparts of the epidemic constitution, and occurred side by side in the same\r\nhouseholds; many of them were quinsies, ulcerated sore-throats, or the\r\nlike, others were gangrenous. In this great variety, only a part could be\r\nreckoned “true diphtheria.” From the first, the remarkable sequel of\r\nparalysis, not only of deglutition but of the motor powers generally, was\r\nremarked here and there. Sometimes an eruption of the skin was seen, but\r\ndesquamation did not occur[1372]. Albumen in the urine was somewhat\r\nconstant. It is noteworthy, the more so that the coincidence was not\r\nremarked at the time, that the true diphtheritic pellicle,--tough,\r\nleathery, elastic,--was found most distinctively, if not exclusively,\r\nwhere it was found in 1748, namely in Cornwall[1373].\r\n\r\nAlthough the epidemic was not confined to low and damp situations, yet\r\nthere was no mistaking the severity of it in Lincolnshire; and although it\r\nfell upon both clean and filthy houses, yet it is probable that the cases\r\nwith most pronounced gangrene or foetor happened amidst the most\r\nunwholesome surroundings. The disease was very general in England in 1858.\r\nWhen the deaths from it in 1859 (9587) were tabulated for the first time\r\naccording to counties, it was found that they came from every part of\r\nEngland and Wales. The highest death-rate was in Lincolnshire, 1·2 per\r\n1000 on the annual average of 1859 and 1860 (995 deaths in the two years).\r\nSussex, Kent, Essex and Norfolk had also high death-rates, the\r\nagricultural counties in general having somewhat more than their usual\r\nshare of an infective mortality as compared with the industrial centres.\r\nBut it would be erroneous to suppose that diphtheria was at all specially\r\na country disease. The mining districts of Staffordshire, Durham and South\r\nWales had considerable mortalities, and so had Lancashire and the West\r\nRiding. But the North Riding and East Riding had their full share or even\r\nmore than their share; whereas, if it had been scarlatina or enteric\r\nfever, they would have been far behind the great industrial division of\r\nYorkshire in ratio of their populations. In the more recent prevalence of\r\ndiphtheria the country districts have lost their preeminence, according to\r\nthe following table of death-rates per million living in registration\r\ndistricts classified roughly as sparse, dense and medium[1374]:\r\n\r\n_Diphtheria Death-rates per million, according to density of population._\r\n\r\n  Period    Dense   Medium  Sparse\r\n  1855-60    123     182     248\r\n  1861-70    163     164     223\r\n  1871-80    114     125     132\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, also, the incidence was the same: e.g. in 1862, of 997\r\ndeaths, 360 were in the towns, 617 in the mainland rural and 20 in the\r\ninsular districts[1375].\r\n\r\nThe law of incidence of diphtheria upon town and country respectively has\r\nbecome a good deal confused by the extraordinary severity with which\r\ndiphtheria has fallen in the last two or three years upon most parts of\r\nLondon and upon the adjoining municipal boroughs of Croydon and West Ham.\r\nThe following table compares the annual death-rates per million in all\r\nEngland and Wales and in London from the year of the first recognition of\r\ndiphtheria to the present time.\r\n\r\n_Death-rates from Diphtheria per million, in all England and in London._\r\n\r\n  Year     England     London\r\n\r\n  1855       20          --\r\n  1856       32          --\r\n  1857       82          --\r\n  1858      339          --\r\n  1859      517         284\r\n  1860      261         174\r\n  1861      225         239\r\n  1862      241         288\r\n  1863      315         275\r\n  1864      261         207\r\n  1865      126         144\r\n  1866      140         152\r\n  1867      120         145\r\n  1868      137         155\r\n  1869       47         107\r\n  1870      120         104\r\n  1871      111         105\r\n  1872       93          80\r\n  1873      108          95\r\n  1874      150         122\r\n  1875      142         167\r\n  1876      129         109\r\n  1877      111          88\r\n  1878      140         155\r\n  1879      120         155\r\n  1880      109         144\r\n  1881      121         171\r\n  1882      151         220\r\n  1883      158         241\r\n  1884      185         236\r\n  1885      163         221\r\n  1886      147         205\r\n  1887      157         226\r\n  1888      168         305\r\n  1889      185         371\r\n  1890      179         330\r\n  1891      173         340\r\n  1892      222         460\r\n  1893      302         740\r\n\r\nThe deaths in London in 1893 were 3196, having been 1962 the year before,\r\nbut never more than half the latter total in any year previous to 1888.\r\nBesides Croydon and West Ham, Cardiff is the great town which has come\r\nnearest the London rate, having had O·68 deaths from diphtheria per 1000\r\nliving in 1892, while Swansea had only 0·05, Wolverhampton (including\r\nBilston and Willenhall) only 0·06, Huddersfield 0·03 and Blackburn 0·02.\r\nIn London the very high death-rate of 1893 was distributed not unequally\r\nover all the divisions, the highest mortality corresponding to the highest\r\nfecundity.\r\n\r\n_Diphtheria in London in 1893._\r\n\r\n                 Death-rate                  Diphtheria\r\n  District    from all causes   Birth-rate   death-rate\r\n\r\n  Eastern         25·1            37·3         1·00\r\n  Central         26·6            29·0         0·82\r\n  Southern        19·9            31·7         0·73\r\n  Northern        20·0            29·3         0·73\r\n  Western         18·7            26·4         0·52\r\n\r\nDiphtheria shows no such decided preference for the late autumnal or early\r\nwinter season as scarlatina, but the winter is on the whole its most\r\nfatal season, according to the following annual averages of the quarters\r\nof the year for twenty years from 1870 to 1889 (total of 67,676 deaths in\r\nEngland and Wales).\r\n\r\n_Annual average of Diphtheria deaths in the quarters of the year._\r\n\r\n  1st qr.    2nd qr.    3rd qr.    4th qr.\r\n\r\n   903        713        730        1025\r\n\r\nAccording to some recent returns under the Notification Act, which are of\r\ndoubtful value owing to the laxity of diagnosis (greater perhaps in\r\nthroat-disorders than in any other class of diseases), the second and\r\nthird quarters of the year have also the lowest mortality in proportion to\r\nthe number of attacks[1376]. As to the ages at which diphtheria proves\r\nfatal, they are somewhat similar to those of fatal scarlatina, but\r\nslightly higher all over; thus, while two-thirds of the deaths from\r\nscarlatina are of infants and children under five years, only one-half of\r\nthe deaths from diphtheria are under that age. In the first epidemic\r\nperiod, 1855-61, Farr reckoned that 1553 adults had died of diphtheria\r\nabove the age of twenty-five, while the deaths under that age had been\r\n28,216. In its age-incidence diphtheria is very different from croup,\r\nwhich attacks chiefly children of one, two, and three years of age, the\r\nboys dying in greater numbers than the girls[1377]. But in all comparisons\r\nbetween diphtheria and croup, as regards sex and age, it should be kept in\r\nmind that many cases of angina of the throat, which end in death by\r\nextension to the larynx and trachea, are registered as croup, even in\r\nepidemics. Diphtheria is the only epidemic disease besides whooping-cough\r\nwhich is more fatal to female children than to males in proportion to the\r\nnumbers of each sex living. The following annual average death-rates per\r\nmillion for the period 1855-80 show the higher death-rates of females at\r\ncertain age periods[1378]:\r\n\r\n          All ages  0-    1-    2-    3-    4-    5-    10-   15-20\r\n\r\n  Males     157     490   724   617   667   589   325   107    50\r\n  Females   168     377   673   668   746   694   413   159    57\r\n\r\nIt is not until the third year that female children begin to die of\r\ndiphtheria in excess of males; which means that the usually greater risk\r\nto male infants holds good also in this disease for the two first years,\r\nwhile some difference between the sexes becomes thereafter so marked as to\r\nturn the balance of fatality to the side of the females. Something of the\r\nsame kind happens in whooping-cough; and it is probable that in both\r\nmaladies the cause lies in the earlier acquisition by the male of\r\nsecondary sexual characters in the throat and larynx, as suggested in the\r\nchapter on whooping-cough.\r\n\r\n\r\nConditions Favouring Diphtheria.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the great and sudden explosion of diphtheria in 1858\r\nand 1859 are as likely as any to throw light on the causes or determining\r\nconditions of the disease. Those two years were remarkable for the Thames\r\nrunning so low in summer as to give out a stench, which was thought to\r\nforebode much fever[1379]. The expected epidemic of fever did not come; on\r\nthe contrary the fever deaths in London were much lower than usual in 1858\r\nand 1859, and, to judge from the few admissions of each kind to the London\r\nFever Hospital, enteric fever declined as well as typhus[1380]. It was\r\ndiphtheria that came. The lowness of the rivers was due to a succession of\r\nyears with rainfall below the average:\r\n\r\n    Low rainfall                High rainfall\r\n\r\n  1855     21·1 inches        1865   29·0 inches\r\n  1856     22·2   \"           1866   30·7   \"\r\n  1857     21·4   \"           1867   28·4   \"\r\n  1858     17·8   \"           1868   25·2   \"\r\n  1859     25·9   \"           1869   24·0   \"\r\n           ----                      ----\r\n  Average  21·7   \"          Average 27·4   \"\r\n\r\nThe low state of the rivers was an index of a low level of the\r\nground-water. If diphtheria is to be included among the infections that\r\nhave the habitat of their virus in the soil, it will probably be found to\r\nbe affected by irregularities in the movements of the subsoil water. A\r\nseries of observations have been made which seem to favour that\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\n    At Maidstone in each of the three years 1885, 1886 and 1887, the\r\n    ground-water rose with the greatest regularity and steadiness to its\r\n    highest point towards the end of the first quarter of the year, and\r\n    fell with equal steadiness to its lowest point in the autumn. During\r\n    two of the years there was little diphtheria, and in one of them none.\r\n    But, in the next two years, 1888 and 1889, “the levels of the\r\n    ground-water oscillated to and fro with unwonted frequence,” having\r\n    several maxima in 1888, and a somewhat uniform high level all through\r\n    1889; and during those two years there was a severe outbreak of\r\n    diphtheria, as well as an excessive number of deaths registered as\r\n    “croup[1381].”\r\n\r\n    The relationship with the ground-water, if any, will probably be found\r\n    to be more than ordinarily complex; but some connexion is indicated by\r\n    the remarkable selection of the Fen country of Lincolnshire in 1858.\r\n    Among the 18th century observations, it was remarked in New England in\r\n    1735-36 that the throat distemper was worst near lakes or rivers, as\r\n    at Newbury Falls, Hampton Falls, and the like. The ill-reputed\r\n    “Kidderminster sore throat,” was associated with the low situation of\r\n    weavers’ houses in the valley of the Stour, subject to inundations.\r\n    Practitioners in many parts of England and Scotland have suspected an\r\n    association with water, even if it were only a mill dam, in the more\r\n    recent prevalence of diphtheria[1382].\r\n\r\nDiphtheria has affinities in its pathological nature with enteric fever on\r\nthe one hand and with scarlatina on the other. The process in the throat\r\nand pharynx is comparable to the typhoid process in the ileum, which is\r\noften a truly diphtheritic process in the second half of the fever[1383].\r\nThe affinities to scarlatina are shown best of all in the real ambiguity\r\nof diagnosis in some whole epidemics of the 18th century, if not also in\r\nthe great epidemics of _garrotillo_ in the 16th and 17th centuries.\r\nAnother singular affinity both to scarlatina and to enteric fever lies in\r\nthe fact that diphtheria, as well as each of these, has been distributed\r\nin milk from some particular dairy, and that contamination of the milk by\r\nthe products of disease upon the cows’ teats has been found to be the\r\nrelevant thing both for the scarlatina and the diphtheria[1384]. Again,\r\nwhatever suspicion pertains to slaughter-houses or animal offal for the\r\nproduction of a scarlatinal miasm, pertains to them also for the\r\ndiphtherial. With such more or less real affinities in the pathology and\r\netiology, it may be made a question whether the recent increase of the\r\ndeath-rate by diphtheria in London and some other places has depended, as\r\nif in the way of correlation, upon the decrease in the death-rates of\r\nscarlatina and of enteric fever[1385]. Diphtheria is perhaps the most\r\nobscure and complex of all the infective diseases in its causes and\r\nfavouring conditions. A certain explanation may seem to suit one outbreak\r\nand be wholly irrelevant for another. More particularly there have been\r\ninnumerable cases for which insanitary surroundings cannot be alleged in\r\nany ordinary meaning of the term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nINFANTILE DIARRHOEA, CHOLERA NOSTRAS, AND DYSENTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfantile diarrhoea and the cholera nostras of adults are closely allied\r\nin symptoms and pathology, but they are so unlike in their fatality that\r\nthey are best considered apart. Dysentery is sufficiently distinguished\r\nfrom choleraic disorders even in nosological respects; and except in\r\nIreland, where its history (already given) has been somewhat special, it\r\nmight have been made the subject of a separate chapter in British\r\nepidemiology. But, for the same reason as in the case of influenzas and\r\nepidemic agues and of scarlatina and diphtheria, it is necessary in a\r\nhistorical review to include infantile diarrhoea, cholera nostras of\r\nadults, and dysentery in one chapter, the reason being, that they are not\r\nclearly separated in the earlier records. So little are they separated in\r\nthe London bills of mortality that the younger Heberden, in his fragment\r\nupon ‘The Increase and Decrease of Diseases[1386],’ has understood the\r\nname of “griping in the guts,” under which enormous totals of deaths are\r\nentered in the bills for many years of the earlier period, to mean\r\ndysentery alone: having assigned that meaning to the name, and having\r\nobserved, as everyone must, the very palpable fact that “griping in the\r\nguts” steadily declined in the bills from the end of the 17th century\r\nuntil it had almost disappeared from them in his own time, he has\r\nelaborately proved from the figures that dysentery was at one time among\r\nthe most important causes of death in London, that it declined in the most\r\nregular way, and at length became all but extinct. This illustration of\r\nthe increase or decrease of diseases has seemed so apt, the statistical\r\ndemonstration so complete, that it has become a favourite example of those\r\nbroad contrasts between the public health of past and present times which\r\nare not less pleasing in rhetoric than they are on the whole true in\r\nfact[1387]. But it happens that the particular instance is wholly\r\nfallacious and erroneous. It was not dysentery that the article “griping\r\nin the guts” meant for the most part, it was infantile diarrhoea; which\r\nhas not only not ceased in our own time, but is commonly believed to be\r\ndistinctively a product of the industrial town life of the present age. I\r\nshall show that it was one of the most important causes of London\r\nmortality from the Restoration onwards, and that although it is still one\r\nof the great causes of death in infants, yet that it had weekly\r\nmortalities in some of the hot summers of former times which were far\r\nhigher in ratio of the numbers living than the diarrhoeal death-rates of\r\nour own time. So far as concerns dysentery itself, it is indeed now rare\r\nin England and Scotland, and not common in Ireland; but the real history\r\nof its decrease has been altogether different, both in the period of it\r\nand in the extent of it, from what Heberden supposed. There are two\r\nreasons for the fallacy and error of that writer: the first, that he\r\noverlooked the question of age-incidence in “griping in the guts”; the\r\nsecond, that he failed to observe that enormous annual totals of deaths\r\nunder that head had been gradually transferred in the bills of the Parish\r\nClerks to the head of “convulsions,” until there were only a few of the\r\nold name left[1388].\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer Diarrhoea of Infants in London, 17th century.\r\n\r\nIn the period of twenty-five years which Sydenham’s epidemic constitutions\r\ncover (1661-1686), the first distinctively choleraic season was the late\r\nsummer and autumn of 1669. It was the first of a series of such seasons,\r\nin one or more of which there occurred dysentery, cholera morbus and\r\nbilious colic. In the context of the bilious colic of the years 1670-72,\r\nSydenham remarks that this was a disease which attacked chiefly the young\r\nof a hot and bilious temperament, and was most rife in the summer\r\nseason[1389]. It is in connexion with the smallpox of 1667-69 that he\r\nspeaks of diarrhoea in infants; in that malady, he says, diarrhoea is as\r\nnatural to infants as salivation to adults, and he blames the imprudent\r\nefforts of nurses to check the diarrhoea for the deaths of “many thousands\r\nof infants[1390].” This is perhaps all that can be found in Sydenham to\r\nshow that infants did in fact suffer from diarrhoea, and that it was fatal\r\nto them in large numbers. Equally indirect is the testimony of Willis.\r\nSpeaking of convulsions, he says they occur at two special periods of\r\nlife,--within one month of birth (the “fits of the mother” of 18th century\r\nwriters), and during teething; and with reference to the cause he says:\r\n“As often as the cause of the convulsive distemper seems to be in the\r\nviscera, either worms or sharp humours, stirring up to torments of the\r\nbelly, are understood to be at fault[1391].” It may be thought singular\r\nthat Sydenham and Willis should not have enlarged upon the infantile age\r\nat which the summer diarrhoea of London mostly proved fatal, or that\r\nSydenham should not have elucidated by some comment the enormous weekly\r\ntotals of deaths by “griping in the guts” in the Parish Clerks’ bills\r\nduring many of the summers and autumns that came within the period of his\r\nepidemic constitutions.\r\n\r\nIt should be kept in mind, however, that it was from the populous\r\nliberties and outparishes occupied by the working class,--from\r\nCripplegate, Shoreditch, Spitalfields, Whitechapel, St Olave’s, Southwark,\r\nNewington and Lambeth,--that the largest totals in the bills came.\r\nSydenham in Pall Mall, Willis in St Martin’s Lane, and Morton in Newgate\r\nStreet, were not likely to see much of the maladies of the poorest class,\r\nleast of all the infantile part of these; and the fact that their\r\nillustrative cases of choleraic disease are mostly of adults should not\r\nmean that the age of infancy did not then furnish most of the deaths, as\r\nit certainly did in later times.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the reason of their saying so little of infantile\r\ndiarrhoea, its great frequency or fatality in London in the end of the\r\n17th century rests upon the explicit testimony of Doctor Walter Harris, in\r\nhis book on the Acute Diseases of Infants, written in 1689[1392]: “From\r\nthe middle of July to the middle of September these epidemic gripes of\r\ninfants are so common (being the annual heat of the season doth entirely\r\nexhaust their strength) that more infants, affected with these, do die in\r\none month than in other three that are gentle.” It was probably this\r\nremarkable fatality of the summer diarrhoea of infants that led Sydenham\r\nto say that the cholera morbus of August differed _toto caelo_ from the\r\ndisease with the same symptoms at any other time of the year[1393].\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1669 was excessively hot; it was a season of enormous\r\nmortality from fevers in Holland, of a type very difficult to understand,\r\nand in New England it was remarkable for fluxes, agues and other fevers.\r\nIn that summer, as well as in the following, Sydenham lays stress upon the\r\namount of choleraic and dysenteric sickness, without saying that it was\r\nspecially fatal to children. The following Tables, compiled from the\r\nweekly bills of the Parish Clerks for each of the two summers, show the\r\nenormous rise of the total deaths in August and September, “griping in the\r\nguts” accounting for almost the whole of the increase.\r\n\r\n_Weekly Mortalities supposed of Infantile Diarrhoea in London._\r\n\r\nSummer and Autumn of 1669\r\n\r\n  Week       Convulsions  Griping in   All\r\n  ending                   the guts   causes\r\n\r\n  June 29        30          42       283\r\n  July  6        49          74       365\r\n       13        48         105       391\r\n       20        53         119       389\r\n       27        36         122       368\r\n  Aug.  3        28          96       340\r\n       10        22         129       437\r\n       17        43         173       510\r\n       24        31         182       482\r\n       31        42         269       665\r\n  Sept. 7        45         318       707\r\n       14        34         277       619\r\n       21        33         231       524\r\n       28        29         232       570\r\n  Oct.  5        38         185       553\r\n       12        30         172       518\r\n       19        25         156       473\r\n       26        16         146       421\r\n  Nov.  2        14          89       372\r\n\r\nSummer and Autumn of 1670\r\n\r\n  Week       Convulsions  Griping in   All\r\n  ending                   the guts   causes\r\n\r\n  July  5        37          41       318\r\n       12        40          51       320\r\n       19        43          76       351\r\n       26        40          77       372\r\n  Aug.  2        49         113       470\r\n        9        38         160       485\r\n       16        44         189       555\r\n       23        47         222       629\r\n       30        42         250       629\r\n  Sept. 6        31         253       617\r\n       13        24         239       586\r\n       20        38         225       575\r\n       27        27         150       474\r\n  Oct.  4        16         130       401\r\n       11        13         104       376\r\n       18        17          78       325\r\n       25        15          75       336\r\n  Nov.  1        19          46       283\r\n\r\nThese are the characteristic London bills of a hot autumn; they recur\r\nsometimes two or three years in succession, and on an average perhaps once\r\nor twice in a decennium. Any year with an unusually high total of deaths\r\nfrom all causes is almost certain to show a large part of its excess of\r\ndeaths in the weekly bills of summer and autumn. The proof that these\r\nenormous weekly totals under the head of “griping in the guts” were\r\ninfantile deaths lies in the fact that they were gradually transferred to\r\n“convulsions,” as will appear in the tables of future autumnal epidemics\r\nshowing the transference half made and wholly made. The transference to\r\n“convulsions” was almost complete before the year 1728, when the ages at\r\ndeaths from all causes were first published in the weekly bills. After\r\nthat year it is obvious that any excessive mortality of the six or eight\r\nhot weeks of late summer or autumn corresponds to a great increase of the\r\ndeaths under two years, which is also the increase of deaths from\r\nconvulsions. But those were the “convulsions” of a particular season,\r\noccupying exactly the place which “griping in the guts” held in the weekly\r\nbills of certain years in the earlier period. As most of the deaths from\r\ninfantile diarrhoea are really from convulsions, it is easy to see that\r\nhigh weekly totals of deaths under that generic name must have been from\r\ninfantile diarrhoea--when they began to rise in August far above the\r\nordinary level of convulsions to fall to the level again in October. It is\r\nby precisely the same reading between the lines that we discover, under\r\nthe head of “diarrhoea and dysentery” in the modern registration returns,\r\nthat there is hardly any fatal dysentery, not much fatal diarrhoea of\r\nadults, but an enormous fatality from the diarrhoea of infants, especially\r\nin summer.\r\n\r\nThe sickness of the latter half of 1669, and of the years following to\r\n1672, which we know from Sydenham and Morton to have been choleraic and\r\ndysenteric, was not special to London. The following abstracts of the\r\nburial registers of country parishes,\r\n\r\n_Deaths in Country Parishes of England._\r\n\r\n         Registers    With excess of        Baptisms   Burials\r\n  Years  examined   burials over baptisms   in these   in these\r\n\r\n  1669     118             33                 685        878\r\n  1670     119             53                 781       1403\r\n  1671     121             36                 668       1051\r\n  1672     121             28                 555        741\r\n  1673     124             16                 365        487\r\n\r\nby Short, show an excessive mortality in those years, which would have\r\nbeen in part caused by bowel complaints, as in the general “choleric\r\nlasks” of the 16th century.\r\n\r\nIn the summers of 1671 and 1672 the article of “griping in the guts”\r\ncontinues high in the London bills. It rises again decidedly in the summer\r\nof 1675, reaching a maximum of 129 deaths in the week ending 24 August,\r\nthe deaths from all causes being 460. In the summer of 1676 it almost\r\nequals the high mortality of 1669 and 1670, reaching a maximum of 238\r\ndeaths in the week ending 22 August, the deaths from all causes being 607.\r\nIn 1678 and 1679 there were epidemic agues, complicated with choleraic\r\nflux and gripes, which undoubtedly affected many adults[1394]. The deaths\r\nfrom “griping in the guts” continue high in the summers of 1680 and 1681.\r\nBut by that time the article “convulsions” had steadily increased in the\r\nbills; and in the next great season of bowel complaint, the excessively\r\nhot and dry summer of 1684, the high mortality of the season is divided\r\nmore equally between “griping in the guts” and “convulsions,” a sufficient\r\nindication of the age-incidence of the former:\r\n\r\n_London Weekly Mortalities._\r\n\r\n1684\r\n\r\n                Griping in\r\n  Week ending    the guts   Convulsions   All deaths\r\n\r\n  July   1          56          98           454\r\n         8          71          92           404\r\n        15          65          79           364\r\n        22          74          89           420\r\n        29         116          84           503\r\n  Aug.   5         154         180           720\r\n        12          --          --            --\r\n        19         186         100           609\r\n        26          --          --            --\r\n  Sept.  2         171          95           585\r\n         9         144          82           564\r\n        16         103          58           471\r\n        23          91          59           464\r\n\r\nThe summers and autumns of 1688 and 1689 were again characteristic seasons\r\nof infantile diarrhoea.

In 1720 “fever” and “convulsions” again reached\r\n    a maximum in September, the deaths from all causes in the week ending\r\n    20th September being 592. The winter of 1721 (February) is the first\r\n    of a series when the weekly deaths of the cold season reach the\r\n    enormous height of the most unwholesome summers, the causes being\r\n    “fever,” “aged,” “consumption,” “dropsy,” and the like, with a due\r\n    proportion of infantile deaths. The fatal winters following are 1723\r\n    (January), 1726 (Jan.-March), 1728 (Feb.-March, the end of a great\r\n    epidemic of fever), 1729 (Nov.-Dec., still fever), 1732-33 (Dec.-Feb.)\r\n    and 1738 (November). This was the great period of spirit-drinking,\r\n    crime, and general demoralization in London. In the week ending 30th\r\n    Jan. 1733, the deaths from “dropsy” were 64: it was in the midst of an\r\n    influenza.\r\n\r\nThe next characteristic weekly bills of autumn are found in the year 1723,\r\nwhen the following enormous mortalities occurred in three successive\r\nweeks:\r\n\r\n1723\r\n\r\n              Griping in\r\n  Week ending  the guts  Convulsions  All deaths  Births\r\n\r\n  Sept. 3          23        308          761      396\r\n       10          32        251          705      339\r\n       17          33        262          768      390\r\n\r\nThen comes a succession of four summers and autumns, 1726-29, in which the\r\nweekly mortalities are of the same kind--high totals from all causes and\r\nhigh “convulsions,” while “fevers” are high in several seasons of the\r\nperiod, perhaps from influenzas. Strother, writing in the summer of 1728,\r\nsays there was much diarrhoea in London “last autumn [1727] and this\r\nsummer,” the effects of which upon the bills of mortality are nowhere\r\nvisible except under the enormous weekly totals of “convulsions.”\r\n\r\nI shall take one more example of a season fatal to infants, the autumn of\r\n1734, by which time we find recorded the ages at death:\r\n\r\n_London Weekly Mortalities, with the numbers under five years._\r\n\r\n1734\r\n\r\n                                       All deaths   Total of\r\n                           All deaths    from       deaths\r\n  Week ending  Convulsions  under two  two to five  at all ages\r\n\r\n  Aug. 13          218        240          71          558\r\n       20          217        284          76          547\r\n       27          240        297          80          573\r\n  Sept. 3          260        331          59          638\r\n       10          226        283          61          593\r\n       17          209        253          43          528\r\n       24          169        225          46          515\r\n  Oct.  1          158        224          59          510\r\n        8          190        236          61          558\r\n       15          136        172          42          464\r\n\r\nIn those nine mortal weeks of 1734, it will be seen that the deaths under\r\ntwo years were about 45 per cent. of the deaths at all ages; they were at\r\nthe same time considerably more than half the recorded births. That was\r\nthe characteristic mortality of an unhealthy summer and autumn. It was\r\nchiefly caused by the same cholera infantum or summer diarrhoea which\r\nraises the weekly bills of London in our own time, and the occasions of it\r\nrecurred in a series of hot summers, or at intervals, just as they do now.\r\nI shall not seek to illustrate this point for the rest of the 18th\r\ncentury, and down to the beginning of registration in 1837. The history\r\nof infantile diarrhoea is a continuous and uniform one, with indications\r\nof greatest severity in the first half of the 18th century. Sir William\r\nFordyce, whose general theme is what he calls the hectic fever of children\r\n(rickets), thus reveals some reasons why that should have been the worst\r\nperiod of infantile diarrhoea[1395]:\r\n\r\n    “I speak within the bounds of truth when, judging from the Bills of\r\n    Mortality and the numbers in such circumstances who have been brought\r\n    to my door since the year 1750, I assert that there must be very near\r\n    20,000 children in London, and Westminster and the suburbs (if this be\r\n    questioned, examine the public charity schools and workhouses, the\r\n    purlieus of St Giles’s and Drury Lane, and satisfy yourselves) ill at\r\n    this moment of the hectic fever, attended with tun-bellies, swelled\r\n    wrists and ancles, or crooked limbs, owing to the impure air which\r\n    they breathe, the improper food on which they live, or the improper\r\n    manner in which their fond parents or nurses rear them up: for they\r\n    live in hotbed chambers or nurseries, they are fed even on meat before\r\n    they have got their teeth, and, what is if possible still worse, on\r\n    biscuits not fermented, or buttered rolls, or tough muffins floated in\r\n    oiled butter, or calves-feet jellies, or strong broths yet more\r\n    calculated to load all their powers of digestion; or are totally\r\n    neglected.”\r\n\r\nMistaken regimen among the more comfortable, total neglect among the\r\nlowest class--these general causes of infantile mortality reached their\r\nhighest point in London under George I. and George II., at the time of the\r\ndisastrous mania for spirit-drinking. But the broken constitutions of the\r\nparents were probably a more telling thing for the poor stamina of the\r\nchildren than close nurseries, injudicious food or even total\r\nneglect[1396].\r\n\r\n    While the article “Convulsions” in the London bills gradually\r\n    swallowed up nearly all the deaths of infants under two years, and so\r\n    far extinguished the article “griping in the guts” that the latter in\r\n    the year 1739 had fallen to the merely nominal figure of 280 deaths in\r\n    the year, yet it should be borne in mind that there must have been in\r\n    the same period an excessive mortality from convulsions not specially\r\n    related to cholera infantum. For example, the kind of convulsions in\r\n    new-born infants which nurses called the “nine-day fits,” produced the\r\n    following mortalities in the Lying-in Hospital of Dublin: Of 17,650\r\n    infants born alive in the hospital from 8 Dec. 1757 to 31 Dec. 1782,\r\n    there died 2944 within a fortnight of birth, or 17 per cent. The\r\n    disease of perhaps nineteen in twenty was “general convulsions, or\r\n    what our nurses have been long in the habit of calling the nine-day\r\n    fits[1397].” Corresponding deaths in London would have been included\r\n    under “chrisoms and infants” in the earlier period; but as that\r\n    article gradually ceased, they were naturally transferred to the\r\n    article “convulsions.”\r\n\r\nThe sacrifice of infants’ lives in London by the diarrhoea of summer\r\nhaving been so enormous as the preceding tables show, the question arises\r\nwhether the same disease was a chief factor in the mortality of provincial\r\ncities and towns. There is little positive evidence for, and there is a\r\ngood deal of probability against, its having been so important anywhere as\r\nin London. In the second quarter of the 18th century, when London had\r\n700,000 inhabitants, the larger provincial towns such as Edinburgh,\r\nGlasgow, Manchester, Newcastle had not more than 30,000 to 40,000. A\r\nLiverpool writer in 1784, by which time the population had grown much,\r\ndoes indeed say that young children in large towns during the hot summer\r\nmonths are apt to be fretful and peevish, and that they should have a\r\nchange to the air of the country[1398]. But it is inconceivable that\r\nManchester, with such vital statistics as are shown at p. 644 could have\r\nhad the same death-rates from convulsions in general or from the\r\nsummer-diarrhoea kind of them in particular, that London then had. Still\r\nit had at least a local predisposition, then as now, to epidemic\r\ndiarrhoea. Thus Ferriar, having described certain flagrant nuisances in\r\nthe town, goes on to say that the burning summer of 1794 was followed by\r\nwet warm weather, that a bilious colic raged among all ranks of the\r\npeople, and that thereafter “the usual epidemic fever” became very\r\nprevalent among the poor[1399].\r\n\r\nThe bills of mortality for occasional years at Chester, Warrington,\r\nNorthampton, Carlisle and Edinburgh, which have been cited before in\r\nvarious contexts, throw hardly any light upon this question of infantile\r\ndiarrhoea. The records of the Newcastle dispensary in the end of the 18th\r\ncentury do show a good many cases of diarrhoea to have been attended, with\r\na proportion of fatalities which suggests that some, at least, were in\r\ninfants. Newcastle, as will appear in the sequel, was certainly much\r\nsubject to dysentery and the diarrhoea of adults in the 18th century, and\r\nwas as likely a place as any in England for cholera infantum. In the\r\nrecords of two towns of Scotland it seems probable that a good deal of\r\ninfantile diarrhoea had been entered in the burial registers under the\r\nname of “bowel-hive.” At Kilmarnock, from 1728 to 1764, and at Glasgow\r\nfrom 1783 to 1800, the principal causes of death in infancy had the\r\nfollowing annual average ratios per cent. of the deaths from all causes:\r\n\r\n                 Kilmarnock           Glasgow\r\n                  1728-64            1783-1800\r\n\r\n  Smallpox      16   per cent.     18·8 per cent.\r\n  Bowel-hive     7·0    \"           6·5    \"\r\n  Chincough      3·0    \"           5·0    \"\r\n  Closing        2·8    \"           2·7    \"\r\n  Measles        2·4    \"           1·3    \"\r\n  Teething       1·4    \"           3·5    \"\r\n\r\nThe article “bowel-hive” has a somewhat higher ratio of the deaths from\r\nall causes at Kilmarnock, with about 4000 population, than at Glasgow with\r\nsome 80,000, and was probably a very comprehensive term[1400].\r\n\r\nSo far as concerns systematic medical description, an article by Dr\r\nBenjamin Rush, of Philadelphia, written in 1773, is the first expressly on\r\nthe theme of cholera infantum or the summer diarrhoea of children; but, as\r\nHirsch correctly remarks, the popular names of the disease then current in\r\nAmerican towns, such as “disease of the season,” “summer complaint,” or\r\n“April-and-May disease” (Southern States), indicate that it was well known\r\nbefore the profession began to write upon it[1401]. So far as concerns\r\nLondon, I am disposed to infer that it was more common, relatively to the\r\npopulation, in the end of the 17th century and throughout the 18th than in\r\nour own time. I shall come back to that after giving the modern statistics\r\nof the malady for the capital and other English towns.\r\n\r\n\r\nModern Statistics of Infantile Diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nThe first six months of registration of the causes of death in England and\r\nWales, July-December, 1837, brought to light the following highest\r\nmortalities from diarrhoea, which are mostly in manufacturing towns, and\r\nespecially in those of Lancashire and Yorkshire:\r\n\r\n1837\r\n\r\nDeaths by Diarrhoea\r\n\r\n                   3rd qr.   4th qr.\r\n\r\n  {Manchester        164        47\r\n  {Salford            26        15\r\n  {Chorlton           63        14\r\n  {Liverpool         142        49\r\n  {West Derby         53        15\r\n  Leeds               52        37\r\n  Nottingham          43         4\r\n  (besides dysentery  25         2)\r\n  Dudley              45        52\r\n  Wolverhampton       37        32\r\n  Bolton              40        27\r\n  Newcastle           35        25\r\n  Sheffield           30        23\r\n  Stockport           28        23\r\n  Preston             21        20\r\n  Wakefield           22        10\r\n  Cockermouth         12        14\r\n\r\nThe returns were incomplete at first; and, for London, the figures of only\r\nthree parishes are given:\r\n\r\n                3rd qr. 4th qr.\r\n\r\n  Shoreditch      73      15\r\n  Greenwich       43      19\r\n  Kensington      35      13\r\n\r\nApart from the imperfect machinery of registration in the first years, the\r\nfigures of mortality by infantile diarrhoea are incorrect owing to many\r\nsuch deaths having been certified as from “convulsions,” according to the\r\nold tradition of the Parish Clerks’ bills. Doubtless this goes on still to\r\na considerable extent; but it will appear from the following comparative\r\ntable for London that it masked the real amount of infantile diarrhoea to\r\na much greater extent at the beginning of registration than afterwards.\r\n\r\n_London Mortalities from the beginning of Registration._\r\n\r\n                                    Gastritis and\r\n  Years   Diarrhoea Dysentery Cholera Enteritis Convulsions\r\n\r\n  1838       393        105      15       881       3419\r\n  1839       376         79      36       843       2961\r\n  1840       452         70      60       977       2983\r\n  1841       465         78      28       957       2778\r\n  1842       704        151     118       996       2773\r\n  1843       834        271      85       874       2701\r\n  1844       705        125      65       818       2736\r\n  1845       841         99      43       707       2395\r\n  1846      2152        156     228       648       2086\r\n  1847      1976         --      --        --       2258\r\n\r\nThere is a progressive decline under “convulsions” and a progressive\r\nincrease under diarrhoea. The year 1846 was undoubtedly marked by an\r\nunusual amount of choleraic disease; but the high level of the diarrhoeal\r\ndeaths was maintained from that year, so that it is probable that some\r\nradical change had been made in the mode of entry. The nearly equal\r\nproportion of deaths from diarrhoea and from convulsions in London has\r\ncontinued since that time to the present, the former falling mostly in the\r\nthird quarter of the year, the latter not unequally on all the quarters.\r\n\r\nIn all England and Wales during the first five and a half years of\r\nregistration the deaths from diarrhoea were few compared with the numbers\r\nrelative to population in later periods:\r\n\r\n                            England and Wales\r\n\r\n  Years                  1837 (6 mo.)  1838  1839  1840  1841  1842\r\n  Deaths from Diarrhoea  2755          2482  2562  3469  3240  5241\r\n\r\nThere is a break in the annual tabulations of the returns for four years\r\nfrom 1843 to 1846; when they are resumed in 1847, the diarrhoeal\r\ndeath-rate per million living is found to have apparently risen to an\r\nenormous height, at which it remained somewhat steady for a whole\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n_Annual average Mortalities per million living from Diarrhoea (and\r\nDysentery)._\r\n\r\nEngland and Wales\r\n\r\n  1838-42      254\r\n  1847-50      900\r\n  1851-60      918\r\n  1861-70      968\r\n  1871-80      917\r\n  1881-90      662\r\n\r\nLondon\r\n\r\n  1838-40      274\r\n  1841-50      782\r\n  1851-60     1030\r\n  1861-70     1040\r\n  1871-80      949\r\n  1881-90      749\r\n\r\nFrom year to year the mortality has fluctuated enormously, as in the\r\nfollowing list, the rise or fall depending for the most part on the kind\r\nof summer: e.g. that of 1893 was hot, and had an excessive mortality from\r\ninfantile diarrhoea.\r\n\r\n  1866      18266\r\n  1867      20813\r\n  1868      30929\r\n  1869      20775\r\n  1870      26126\r\n  1871      24937\r\n  1872      23034\r\n  1873      22514\r\n  1874      21888\r\n  1875      24729\r\n  1876      22417\r\n  1877      15282\r\n  1878      25103\r\n  1879      11463\r\n  1880      30185\r\n  1881      14536\r\n  1882      17185\r\n  1883      15983\r\n  1884      26412\r\n  1885      13398\r\n  1886      24748\r\n  1887      20242\r\n  1888      12839\r\n  1889      18434\r\n  1890      17429\r\n  1891      13962\r\n  1892      15336\r\n  1893      28755\r\n\r\nThese large annual totals stand almost wholly for deaths of infants,\r\naccording to the following table of rates per million living at the\r\nrespective ages:\r\n\r\n_Mortality from Diarrhoeal diseases per million living at the\r\nage-periods._\r\n\r\n          All ages 0-5   5-10\r\n\r\n  1851-60   1080   5263  229\r\n  1861-70   1076   5985  160\r\n  1871-80    935   5728   69\r\n\r\nThree-fourths of the deaths are of infants in their first year. The middle\r\nperiod of life is comparatively free from this cause of death, but at\r\nfifty-five the ratio begins to rise again, and at seventy-five and upwards\r\nis almost as high, among the comparatively small number living in extreme\r\nage, as it was in infancy. Male infants die of it in excess of females,\r\naccording to a very general rule of sex mortality. It is also according to\r\nrule that the ratio of female deaths approximates to that of males in\r\nmiddle life and old age.\r\n\r\nThe deaths from infantile diarrhoea fall in great excess upon the towns,\r\nand most of all upon the manufacturing towns and certain seaports. London,\r\nwhich almost certainly had a great pre-eminence in the 18th century in the\r\nmatter of infantile deaths by summer diarrhoea, has lost it to a number of\r\nprovincial towns, of which the following is a list in the order of the\r\npercentage ratios of their diarrhoeal death-rate per 1000 living under\r\nfive years to their death-rates from all causes under five years\r\n(Decennial Period, 1871-80):\r\n\r\n_Percentages of Diarrhoeal death-rate in the death-rates from all causes\r\nunder five years._\r\n\r\n  Yarmouth            19·4\r\n  Leicester           19·2\r\n  Preston             16\r\n  Worcester           16\r\n  {Sculcoates         16\r\n  {Hull               14\r\n  Northampton         15\r\n  Coventry            15\r\n  Goole               14\r\n  Leeds               13·7\r\n  Birmingham          13·5\r\n  Manchester          13\r\n  Salford             13\r\n  Norwich             13\r\n  Wigan               12·7\r\n  Hartlepool          12·5\r\n  Nottingham          12·4\r\n  Sheffield           12\r\n  Hunslet             12\r\n  Bolton              11·6\r\n  Holbeck             11·6\r\n  Stoke-on-Trent      11·3\r\n  Stockport           11·2\r\n  Liverpool           11\r\n  Blackburn           10\r\n  London, St Giles’s  10\r\n  London, Whitechapel  9·6\r\n\r\nThe reasons for placing the towns in the above order will be found in the\r\nTable that follows, the significance of which will be pointed out after\r\nsome other matters have been disposed of.

In the curves formed by Buchan and Mitchell of\r\nthe rise and fall of the deaths by various diseases in London throughout\r\nthe year, that of diarrhoea was the sharpest, rising to a high peak in the\r\nthird quarter of the year (July-Sept.). “Speaking generally,” says Dr\r\nOgle, “it appears from the returns of mortality in London that the\r\ndiarrhoeal mortality becomes high when the mean weekly temperature rises\r\nto about 63°F.[1402]” The season is practically the same throughout the\r\nBritish Isles. But in warmer countries, such as the more southern of the\r\nUnited States of America, infantile diarrhoea is “the April and May\r\ndisease.” It is not the fatalities only, but the cases as a whole, that\r\nfall decidedly upon the third quarter of the year[1403].\r\n\r\n\r\nCauses of the high death-rates from Infantile Diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nSydenham said that the diarrhoea or bilious colic of London in the month\r\nof August differed _toto coelo_ from that of other seasons of the year;\r\nand Harris, writing in the year of Sydenham’s death (1689), said that more\r\ninfants, affected with the epidemic gripes, died in one month of the hot\r\nseason, from mid-July to mid-September, than in other three that are\r\ngentle. If this were taken to mean that the infantile mortality from all\r\ncauses was trebled by the prevalence of diarrhoea during the eight warmest\r\nweeks of the year, it would be nearly borne out by the weekly bills of\r\nmortality, according to the examples given of them from the more fatal\r\nyears. So far from the deaths of infants in London by summer diarrhoea\r\nhaving increased in the present century, they would appear to have\r\ndiminished greatly. The two worst weeks of an unhealthy summer or autumn\r\nraised the London deaths in former times relatively as much as the whole\r\ndiarrhoeal season would do now. If this great change for the better be\r\nadmitted as correct, it may throw some light upon the causes of excessive\r\ninfantile diarrhoeal mortality in London in former times, and in some\r\nother English towns at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe London populace in the 17th and 18th centuries were not only the\r\nsingle great urban community in the kingdom, but they were far more\r\n“urban” than now, in Milton’s sense of being\r\n\r\n                  “long in populous city pent,\r\n  Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air.”\r\n\r\nThe houses stood closer together, many of them back to back in courts and\r\nalleys. The streets were narrower. The inhabited area had few or no open\r\nspaces besides the bed of the Thames. Not only the City and Liberties, but\r\nalso the out-parishes were compact, as if within a ring fence, joining on\r\nto the open country abruptly, and not as now in straggling suburbs. It was\r\nhardly possible to take children out for an airing, except in the west\r\nend. When Lettsom about 1770 applied the fresh-air treatment to\r\nconvalescent cases of typhus, he had to send the patients to loiter on the\r\nbridges spanning the Thames. As Cobbett said, London was a “great wen,” in\r\nthe correct sense of a shut sac which grew by distension. The soil was\r\nfull of organic impurities, including the decompositions of many\r\ngenerations of the dead. A hot summer in former times raised effluvia from\r\nthe ground such as the modern residents have no experience of. The life\r\nindoors was equally adverse to infants. Fustiness was favoured by the\r\nwindow-tax; a tenement-house was apt to be pervaded by the excremental\r\neffluvia from the “vault” at the bottom of the stair. The worst time of\r\nall in London was the great drunken period from about 1720 onwards.\r\nDoubtless drink was then used, as it is sometimes now, to drug the fretful\r\ninfants into torpor; but it told also upon them indirectly, inasmuch as\r\ndissolute parents would have bred children with _mala stamina\r\nvitae_[1404]. In all these respects there has been so great an improvement\r\nin London that, although its population now exceeds four millions, its\r\ndeath-rate from infantile diarrhoea, a distinctively urban disease,\r\nexceeds only by a little the mean of all England and Wales.\r\n\r\nWhile the mortality from infantile diarrhoea in London has undoubtedly\r\ndecreased since the 17th and 18th centuries per head of the population, it\r\nis equally certain that there has been within the present century a great\r\nrelative increase of the deaths from that cause in the country generally.\r\nThe reason is that there has been an enormous increase of population and\r\nthat the increase has been almost wholly urban. The rise of new\r\nmanufacturing towns, with the great extension of the borders of old towns,\r\nas in Lancashire and Yorkshire, has inevitably brought to the front this\r\ndistinctive fatality of town-bred infants. If the additional millions had\r\nbeen dispersed in village communities over the face of the country, as in\r\nBengal, the mere density of population per square mile would have had its\r\neffect on the public health, but not the same effect. There are now two\r\nor three provincial cities comparable in size to 18th century London, and\r\nthere are some twenty more large enough to be in the same group. In most\r\nof these the mortality from infantile diarrhoea has held its ground, for\r\nall the improvements in sanitation and in well-being whereby the\r\ndeath-rate from all causes has been considerably reduced. It is mainly\r\nowing to that disease, and to whooping-cough, that the death-rate in the\r\nfirst year of life, although it has ranged widely from year to year, has\r\nfallen but little in the successive decennial periods. The bad eminence of\r\nsome towns in the list already given is probably due to a composition of\r\ncauses, among which the situation, soil, depth of ground-water, and the\r\nlike, would count. It is remarkable, however, that there are only a few of\r\nthem, such as Liverpool and Hull, that have been the chosen seats of great\r\nepidemics of Asiatic cholera. On the other hand, Leicester and Birmingham\r\nnever had an epidemic of that disease, while Preston and the\r\ncotton-weaving towns of Lancashire generally have had but slight outbreaks\r\nof it. Again, the deaths from diarrhoea have been more purely infantile in\r\nthe group of towns which have had little or no Asiatic cholera[1405].\r\n\r\nThat which distinguishes the Lancashire and West Riding towns with highest\r\nproportions of diarrhoeal death-rates in their infantile death-rates\r\ngenerally, as well as such towns as Leicester, Worcester, Northampton,\r\nCoventry and Norwich, Birmingham, Nottingham and Stoke-on-Trent, is the\r\nextensive employment of women in factory work and other labour of the\r\nfactory kind. The Census returns do not adequately show this for married\r\nwomen, who may be returned simply as of the married rank whether they be\r\nwage-earners or not; but it is well known that the female labour of\r\nindustrial towns is to a large extent the labour of child-bearing women.\r\nAmong the towns that stand highest for infantile diarrhoea, Preston, in\r\nthe Census of 1881, had 32 per cent. of its adult female population\r\noccupied in the cotton mills; Leicester had 20 per cent. of all its women\r\noccupied in various industries, of which the chief are the hosiery and\r\nboot-making; Northampton only 13 per cent., all at boot-making; Worcester,\r\na percentage, unknown for the city, occupied mostly at glove-making;\r\nNorwich about 10 per cent. of its women returned as employed at\r\nboot-making, silk manufacture, and various smaller industries.\r\n\r\nOne obvious result of married women engaging in factory labour, or piece\r\nlabour of the same kind at home, is that they do not suckle their infants;\r\nand it has long been known that infants brought up with milk from a\r\nfeeding-bottle are much more liable to diarrhoea than infants brought up\r\nat the breast. But the feeding-bottle is now too universal an appurtenance\r\nof infancy among all classes and in all places to be a sufficient\r\nexplanation without something else, although there is no doubt that\r\nfeeding-bottles which are not kept very carefully clean are a real danger\r\nin the particular way. Again, young children above the age for suckling or\r\nfeeding by the bottle are attacked by summer diarrhoea in about the same\r\nproportions (e.g. at Leicester) as infants under one year, although they\r\ndo not contribute an equal quota to the death-roll.\r\n\r\nIn the discussions upon this question it has been commonly assumed that\r\nthe fault lies with the mother after the birth of her child, and all the\r\nremedial measures, such as crèches for the infants of workwomen, have that\r\nassumption underlying them[1406]. I believe that this is a very inadequate\r\naccount of the cause of this great modern evil, and that the remedies\r\nproposed are mere palliatives which are destined to fail. The importance\r\nof the matter may justify me for once in making an excursus into\r\nphysiology and pathology.\r\n\r\n    The problem of infantile diarrhoea is in great part the same as the\r\n    problem of rickets. The peculiar summer disease of town-bred infants\r\n    is especially apt to assail the rickety: probably a very large number\r\n    of the infants under one who are cut off by it would have become\r\n    obviously rickety if they had lived a few months longer. But even if\r\n    there were not this well-known correspondence between the subjects of\r\n    infantile diarrhoea and of rickets, we should find analogies in the\r\n    pathology of each. Rickets is an exquisitely congenital disease, or a\r\n    disease acquired by the child in the womb from the kind of\r\n    intra-uterine nutrition that it receives. In recent times it has been\r\n    usual to restrict the term congenital in rickets to the very few cases\r\n    that have rickets developed at birth. This is a typical instance of\r\n    the peculiar narrowness of view in modern pathology. All rickets is\r\n    congenital, although it is rare to find the symptoms made manifest\r\n    until the infant is nearly a year old. Cullen’s reasoning on this\r\n    point a century ago has never been answered nor superseded. The\r\n    theories of that day to explain rickets by injudicious feeding or\r\n    regimen after birth seemed to him beside the mark: “Upon the whole I\r\n    am of opinion that hired nurses seldom occasion this disease unless\r\n    when a predisposition to it has proceeded from the parents.... I am\r\n    very much persuaded that the circumstances in the rearing of children\r\n    have less effect in producing rickets than has been imagined.... I\r\n    doubt if any of the former [dietetic errors and the like] would\r\n    produce it where there was no predisposition in the child’s original\r\n    constitution.... So far as I can refer the disease of the children to\r\n    the state of the parents, it has appeared to me most commonly to arise\r\n    from some weakness, and pretty frequently from a scrofulous habit, in\r\n    the mother,” (Cullen, _First Lines_, Part III. Bk. II. chapter 4). The\r\n    chief exponent of the diathetic views on rickets in our time has been\r\n    Sir William Jenner (_Med. Times and Gaz._, 1860, I. 466); but I\r\n    remember at the Pathological Society on 7 Dec., 1880, how\r\n    unacceptable, or perhaps unintelligible, that part of his exposition\r\n    was to a younger generation who appeared to have forgotten the meaning\r\n    of _mala stamina vitae_.\r\n\r\n    The congenital nature of rickets is not only an empirical fact, based\r\n    upon experience, but it is a doctrine of rational pathology. The\r\n    latter aspect of it rests upon the correct physiology of intra-uterine\r\n    nutrition, for which I refer to my investigations on the structure and\r\n    function of the placenta (_Journal of Anatomy and Physiology_, July,\r\n    1878, and January, 1879). The detailed application of the\r\n    physiological facts to rickets I have attempted deductively in section\r\n    5 of the article “Pathology” in the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_, vol.\r\n    XVIII., 1884. The building up of the placenta by the mother, and the\r\n    due performance of function by that great and wonderful extemporised\r\n    organ, require certain favouring conditions, which have been never\r\n    unperceived by the common sense of mankind. Those conditions are\r\n    certainly not to be found in factory labour. A woman who has to be\r\n    thinking of the time-keeper at the gate and the foreman in the mill,\r\n    who has ever in her ears the din of belts and wheels and mill-stones,\r\n    who has dust in her lungs and weariness in her back, can hardly do\r\n    justice to the child in her womb. The rearing of the child after it is\r\n    born is of small consequence beside the rearing of it before it is\r\n    born. The opportunity comes once (heredity apart) of giving it good\r\n    stamina or bad; and in the circumstances of factory labour the wonder\r\n    is that breeding women provide so well as they do for their unborn\r\n    offspring. It is undoubted that they often tax themselves beyond\r\n    measure to do so, in tacit obedience to the great law of maternity.\r\n\r\nWhile the connexion of rickets in the child with the laborious or anxious\r\npreoccupations of the mother during gestation can be followed out in\r\nphysiological or pathological detail, the connexion with the same of a\r\ndisposition to summer diarrhoea remains empirical, except in so far as it\r\nis a part of the rickety constitution itself. Some congenital weakness, we\r\nmay suppose, attends the functions of digestion and assimilation, and,\r\nunder the relaxing influence of continued high temperature, leads to\r\nvomiting and purging, to which many infants succumb through the eventual\r\nimplication of the cerebral functions.\r\n\r\n    Ballard gives a table to show that of 332 infants (in a total of 340)\r\n    who died of diarrhoea at Leicester in 1881 and 1882, 141, or 42·5 per\r\n    cent. were “healthy,” and 191, or 57·5 per cent. were “weakly,” and\r\n    other tables to show that “our experience of these Leicester epidemics\r\n    by no means supports an opinion commonly held that a summer diarrhoeal\r\n    epidemic makes its first fatal swoop upon the weakliest\r\n    children[1407].” If “weakly” and “healthy” were as determinate as\r\n    bushels of wheat or barley, there would be some fitness in this resort\r\n    to numerical precision. But, in the circumstances, common experience\r\n    will come as near the truth as the statistical method can, and will\r\n    assign poor stamina to a much larger proportion of the infants that\r\n    die. The poor stamina may be more a matter of inference than of direct\r\n    observation. Thus, the last case of a death from infantile summer\r\n    diarrhoea that came under my notice was in a big-boned and well-grown\r\n    infant in the country. But it was the twelfth child of an equally\r\n    large-built country woman, then big with her thirteenth, whose\r\n    husband, a farm labourer, earned on an average not more than ten\r\n    shillings a week. The rate of fecundity has, of course, a direct\r\n    influence upon the stamina of the children. Its bearing upon the\r\n    death-rate from infantile diarrhoea is shown in one of the columns of\r\n    the table at p. 762.\r\n\r\n\r\nCholera Nostras.\r\n\r\nThus far I have considered diarrhoea as the “disease of the season” for\r\nthe age of infancy or early childhood; and undoubtedly the large totals of\r\ndeaths from it in the London bills, whether under the name of “griping in\r\nthe guts” or afterwards under the generic name of “convulsions” were\r\nnearly all infantile deaths, both in earlier and later times. If we had\r\nregard only to the statistics of mortality and the effects upon\r\npopulation, we might now pass from the subject of epidemic diarrhoea,\r\nhaving said all that has to be said of it in those respects. But the\r\ndeaths from epidemic diarrhoea, mostly of the summer and autumn, are far\r\nfrom being a correct measure of its prevalence, whether in our own time or\r\nin earlier times. Adults suffered from it in a fair proportion of the\r\nnumbers living at the higher ages, although few of them died of it, except\r\namong the elderly and aged. It is only for modern times that we have any\r\nfigures of the number of persons attacked at the respective periods of\r\nlife; and these I shall take first in order, as illustrating the\r\nprobabilities or generalities that may be collected from earlier writers\r\nsuch as Willis and Sydenham.\r\n\r\nThe following Table of the ages attacked at Leicester during a recent\r\nseries of years shows a smaller proportion of attacks in infancy than some\r\nother modern tables do; but it is not misleading for general experience,\r\nand it will serve emphatically to correct the illusion that infants,\r\nbecause they contribute the bulk of the deaths, are most obnoxious to the\r\nattacks[1408]:\r\n\r\n_44,678 cases of Summer Diarrhoea at Leicester in seven epidemic seasons,\r\n1881-87._\r\n\r\n        Age                        Cases     Per cent.\r\n\r\n  Under one year                   2,284        5·2\r\n  One year and under five          8,956       20·0\r\n  Five years and upwards          33,438       74·8\r\n                                  ------      -----\r\n                                  44,678      100·0\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the fatalities from diarrhoea in all England during the\r\nsame seven years had the following very different incidence upon the\r\nperiods of life:\r\n\r\n               Under       One year and\r\n              one year      under five      Five years and upwards\r\n\r\n  1881         9408            2476          2852 = 19·3 per cent.\r\n  1882        10680            3555          3050 = 17·6    \"\r\n  1883         9962            2843          3128 = 19·6    \"\r\n  1884        17854            4794          3764 = 14·2    \"\r\n  1885         8821            2023          2524 = 17·9    \"\r\n  1886        16514            4936          3298 = 13·3    \"\r\n  1887        14101            2936          3205 = 15·8    \"\r\n                                                    ----\r\n           Annual average per cent. above five      16·8\r\n\r\nThus, while (at Leicester) the attacks above the age of five years were\r\n74·8 per cent. the fatalities above that age (in all England) were only\r\n16·8 per cent. and the greater part of the deaths in that small fraction\r\nwere of elderly or aged persons. This means that persons attacked by\r\ndiarrhoea between the ages of five and (say) fifty nearly all recover; on\r\nthe other hand a large proportion of infants in their first year succumb\r\nto the attack, and a considerable proportion of elderly or aged persons\r\nsuccumb to it.\r\n\r\nIf we were to judge from the direct testimony of Sydenham and Willis, we\r\nshould say that the cholera nostras of London in the 17th century was\r\nchiefly a malady of the higher ages; there is little in their writings to\r\nsuggest the enormous mortality of infants from that cause, which can be\r\ndeduced from a close study of the bills. One reason for this, as already\r\nsaid, was that the ailments of infants and young children in former times\r\ncame little under the notice of physicians, being left to the\r\n“mulierculae” or nurses, and that among the working class, from which most\r\nof the deaths in the bills came, there was in those times an almost total\r\nlack of the medical experiences now gained through dispensaries, hospitals\r\nand other charities or public institutions. With this proviso we may take\r\nthe accounts of the older writers as giving a correct picture of the\r\nepidemic cholera nostras of a hot and close summer or autumn in former\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe great seasons of choleraic disease in the 16th century were the years\r\n1539-40, (which were remarkable all over Europe for dysentery as well),\r\n1557-58, 1580-82, and probably 1596[1409]. The term commonly used in that\r\nperiod was a choleric lask, which meant _profluvium_. In some, if not in\r\nall, of those seasons there was unusual heat and drought. It is clear that\r\nthese were only the years when cholera nostras of the summer season was\r\nexceptionally common and severe. According to a medical work of the year\r\n1610, dealing with the indications for the use of tobacco by individuals,\r\nincluding the seasons of the year when it was most admissible, midsummer\r\nis characterized in general terms, and perhaps in the stock language of\r\nforeign medical treatises, as the season for “continuall and burning\r\nfevers, bleareyedness, tertian agues, vomiting of yellow choler,\r\ncholericke fluxes of the belly, paines of the eares and ulcerations of the\r\nmouth, putrefactions of the lower parts: especially when the summer,\r\nbesides his heat, is enclined to overmuch moisture, and that no windes\r\nblow, and the weather bee darke, foule, close and rainie.... So that in\r\nthis season, and for these remembered griefes, no man, I trust, will grant\r\ntobacco to be verie holesome[1410].” Consistently with this Sydenham says\r\nthat, while the cholera morbus of August, 1669, was more general than he\r\nhad ever known it, yet in every year, at the end of summer and beginning\r\nof autumn, there was some of it; and he compares its regularity to the\r\ncoming of the swallow in spring or of the cuckoo in early summer. It was\r\nmarked by enormous vomiting, purging, vehement pain in the bowels,\r\ninflation and distension, cardialgia, thirst, a quick pulse, sometimes\r\nsmall and unequal, heat and anxiety, nausea, sweats, spasms of the arms\r\nand legs, faintings, coldness of the extremities, and other symptoms,\r\nalarming to the attendants and sometimes causing death within twenty-four\r\nhours[1411]. Next year, 1670, in the corresponding season, he describes\r\nunder the name of a bilious colic, a prevalent malady which, he says,\r\nshould count rather among chronic diseases[1412]. It was marked by\r\nintolerable pain, the abdomen being now bound as if in a tight bandage,\r\nnow bored through as if by a gimlet. These pains would remit for a time,\r\nand the paroxysm come back, the patient shrinking from the mere idea of it\r\nwith misery expressed in his face and voice. This was evidently somewhat\r\ndifferent from the cholera morbus of the summer of 1669; it was apt to end\r\nin inverted peristaltic action, with vomiting of the matters of enemata,\r\nor in iliac passion[1413]. There was also dysentery in both years, as we\r\nshall see.\r\n\r\nMorton gives the first choleraic and dysenteric season under the year\r\n1666, and says of its recurrence in the following autumn, that hardly any\r\nother disease was to be seen, that the whole town was seized, and that\r\n300, 400 or 500 died of it in a week. This is obviously antedated by two\r\nyears, just as Morton is two years earlier than Sydenham with the great\r\nfatality of measles (1672 instead of 1674). Willis, again, who wrote some\r\ntwenty years nearer to the events than Morton did, places the great\r\ncholeraic seasons in 1670 and 1671, instead of 1669 and 1670. Sydenham’s\r\ndates are undoubtedly correct, both as borne out by the bills of\r\nmortality, and as occurring in consecutive order in the annals which he\r\nkept for a period of twenty-five years. The correctness of his dates\r\napart, Willis may be cited for the symptoms of the London cholera[1414].\r\n\r\n    The onset was sudden, with vomiting and watery purging, accompanied by\r\n    prostration: “I knew a great many that, though the day before they\r\n    were well enough and very hearty, yet within twelve hours were so\r\n    miserably cast down by the tyranny of this disease that they seemed\r\n    ready to expire, in that their pulse was weak and slender, a cold\r\n    sweat came upon them and their breath was short and gasping; and\r\n    indeed many of them, that wanted either fit remedies or the help of\r\n    physicians, died quickly of it. This distemper raged for a whole\r\n    month, but began to decrease about the middle of October, and before\r\n    the first of November was almost quite gone.” The vomitings and\r\n    purgings were copious, watery, almost limpid, not bilious. The\r\n    sickness was peculiar to London or the country within three miles of\r\n    it. It did not seem to be infectious, but to attack only those\r\n    predisposed to it; for it would seize those who kept out of the way of\r\n    the sick and spare those who attended them. Morton, however, declares\r\n    that he was infected in two successive seasons, “dum, mense Augusto,\r\n    sedes dysentericorum minus cauté inspicerem.”\r\n\r\nThese illustrations from the highly choleraic summers of 1669 and 1670\r\nwill serve to show the prevalence of cholera nostras among adults in\r\nLondon in former times. Its great seasons were the same as those of\r\ncholera infantum, of which numerous instances have been given from the\r\nLondon weekly bills of mortality. The years 1727-29 were specially noted\r\nfor cholera by the annalists, such as Wintringham, of York. Hillary, of\r\nRipon, having entered in his annals a “cholera morbus” in 1731, adds:\r\n“which disease I have observed to appear almost every year towards the\r\nlatter end of summer[1415].” A letter from Darlington, 29 July, 1751,\r\nhaving mentioned the death of the earl of Derby by “the cholera morbus,”\r\nadds that the disease usually rages at the close of summer and towards the\r\nbeginning of autumn[1416]. Newcastle was much subject to it, as well as to\r\ndysentery, Wilson, of that town, devoting an essay to dysentery in 1761\r\nand to cholera in 1765. Lind, who went to Haslar Hospital in the very\r\nunwholesome period about 1756-58, found much aguish and choleraic\r\nsickness: “Obstinate agues, and what is called the bilious cholic, from\r\nbeing accompanied with vomitings and a purging of supposed bile, but\r\nespecially the flux, are often at Portsmouth and Gosport in the autumnal\r\nseason highly epidemical. Since I resided here, I have observed those\r\ndistempers to rage among the inhabitants, strangers and troops with an\r\nuncommon degree of mortality; while, during this period of universal\r\ndistress at land, ten thousand men in the ships at Spithead remained\r\nunaffected with them[1417].” At Manchester, in the burning summer of 1794,\r\na bilious colic, says Ferriar, “raged among all ranks of people[1418].”\r\nClarke, of Nottingham, writing in 1807 of the great prevalence of cholera\r\nnostras, calls it “the usual attendant on autumn[1419].”\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Asiatic cholera in England in the end of 1831 gave rise\r\nto much controversial writing for a few months, as to whether the epidemic\r\nwere really the foreign pestilence. Every effort was made by a certain\r\nschool to find native precedents for a disease equally malignant; which,\r\nif they did not prove the point in question, gave more exact particulars\r\nof cholera nostras than we might otherwise have received. The only one of\r\nthese accounts that need concern us here is Thackrah’s for Leeds and its\r\nvicinity in 1825[1420].\r\n\r\n    The weather had been exceptional. In May, three-eighths more rain fell\r\n    than usual, the wind being in the east the whole month. June was\r\n    showery and sultry, the thermometer on the 12th marking 87°. July was\r\n    sultry, with drought for several weeks to the 3rd of August, when\r\n    showers fell. There had been a few cases of cholera in May, June and\r\n    July, but it was not until August that the disease became rife in\r\n    Leeds and still more in certain villages near it. The symptoms were\r\n    purging, vomiting, cramps, prostration, coldness of the extremities,\r\n    shrinking of the features, &c. At Moor Allerton, a parish three or\r\n    four miles north of Leeds, with a poor scattered population occupied\r\n    on the farms, there were found in 60 houses, containing 299 persons,\r\n    no fewer than 114 cases of sickness in July, August and September, 81\r\n    of these from cholera, with 3 deaths. Dysentery was common, both as a\r\n    sequel of the cholera and as a primary malady. At Halton, three or\r\n    four miles east of Leeds, with a population better off than in the\r\n    former, there were found in 60 houses, with 298 persons, 74 cases of\r\n    sickness, of which 63 were choleraic. At Grawthorpe, four miles west\r\n    of Wakefield, with a weaving population not poor but of filthy habits,\r\n    there had been for two months before the visit of inspection more\r\n    sickness than any one remembered. Twenty of all ages had died of the\r\n    epidemic, there having been 7 corpses in the village on one morning.\r\n    Of 70 houses inspected, only 7 had been exempt from cholera and\r\n    dysentery. In one house of 9 persons 7 were ill, 2 with cholera,\r\n    others with dysentery and typhus. This was one of the most unhealthy\r\n    villages, supplied with water from ponds only. In Leeds the choleraic\r\n    epidemic was less than in the adjoining country, and the few deaths\r\n    that occurred from it were all among the poor and debilitated. The hot\r\n    summer of 1825 was unusual for the amount of cholera nostras. It\r\n    prevailed at South Shields that season with unusual severity, the\r\n    cramps and spasms being peculiarly manifest[1421].\r\n\r\n\r\nDysentery in the 17th and 18th centuries.\r\n\r\nThe younger Heberden remarks, “There is scarcely any fact to be collected\r\nfrom the bills of mortality more worthy the attention of physicians than\r\nthe gradual decline of dysentery.” I have shown the fallacy of Heberden’s\r\nproof in the first part of this chapter on Infantile Diarrhoea. It is true\r\nthat dysentery did decline in London, but not on the evidence adduced by\r\nHeberden, nor within the noteworthy limits that he supposed. It was at no\r\ntime one of the greater causes of death in London, and it had already by\r\nthe middle of the 18th century reached as low a point as it stood at when\r\nHeberden wrote. As it is one of the diseases that have become rare in this\r\ncountry, there is a scientific interest in establishing the fact of its\r\ndecrease, even although its prevalence had been at no time more than\r\noccasional.\r\n\r\nHirsch groups the outbreaks of dysentery as of four degrees of extent: (1)\r\nlocalized in a single town or village, or even a single house, or barrack,\r\nor prison, or ship; (2) dispersed over a few neighbouring localities; (3)\r\ndispersed over a large tract of country in the same season; (4)\r\nsimultaneous in many countries, or extending over a great part of the\r\nglobe, and continuing as a pandemic for several years[1422]. The last are\r\nthe most curious; and of these there are at least two in which Britain had\r\na share, the dysenteries of 1539-40 and of 1780-85. Of the next degree,\r\nthere have been several in Ireland and Scotland, including those of the\r\ngreat Irish famines of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the “wame-ill” of\r\nScotland in 1439. Of the two minor degrees of extent, there have been, of\r\ncourse, many instances in the towns, counties or provinces of Britain.\r\n\r\nA considerable decline of dysentery in London before the end of the 17th\r\ncentury is made probable by various facts that can be gathered from the\r\nbills of mortality. When these began to be printed in 1629, dysentery\r\nappeared in them under the unambiguous name of bloody flux; there were 449\r\ndeaths from that cause in 1629, they had decreased to 165 in 1669 (a year\r\nremarkable for dysentery and other forms of bowel-complaint), and to 20 in\r\nthe year 1690, soon after which the article of bloody flux ceased in the\r\nbills. But we are not to judge of the amount of dysentery from the\r\nentries under the name of bloody flux alone. In 1650 there began the\r\narticle of “griping in the guts”; as I have shown, it was mostly infantile\r\ndiarrhoea of the summer and autumn, but, so long as it lasted, it had\r\nprobably included some dysentery. Besides the articles of bloody flux and\r\ngriping in the guts, there was a third article for a time in the bills,\r\nnamely “surfeit,” a term which came at length to mean dysentery[1423].\r\nThus the great plague of 1625 is said to have been preceded by a surfeit\r\nin Whitechapel; and it is clear from other uses of that word, for example\r\nas applied to slaves shipped on the West Coast of Africa for transport to\r\nthe West Indies, that it meant dysentery more than any other form of\r\nbowel-complaint[1424]. Accordingly when we find in the weekly bills of\r\nmortality for London that a series of weeks in the dysenteric summer and\r\nautumn of 1669 had deaths from “surfeit” to the numbers of 9, 11, 10, 12,\r\n9, 15, &c., we may take it that these were dysenteric rather than\r\ncholeraic, the more so as the other name “bloody flux” has fewer deaths to\r\nit than we might have expected from Sydenham’s general language. These\r\nvarious items in the London bills cannot be used for an exact statistical\r\npurpose, but only as indications. Perhaps the most trustworthy indication\r\nis the total of 449 deaths from bloody flux in the year 1629, being a\r\ntwentieth part of the mortality from all causes (8771 deaths). That was a\r\nprevalence of fatal dysentery in London far in excess of anything that is\r\nknown in the 18th century, for example in the dysenteric seasons of 1762\r\nand 1781. So long as plague lasted, dysentery seems to have been somewhat\r\ncommon, and probably most so in the plague years; for, besides the surfeit\r\nin Whitechapel with which the plague of 1625 is said to have begun, we\r\nfind many deaths from bloody flux in the year of the Great Plague itself,\r\n1665. As Sydenham and Willis have left good accounts of the London\r\ndysentery of 1669-72, it will be convenient to take from these sources our\r\nimpressions of the disease in the 17th century.\r\n\r\nReferring to the dysentery of 1669, Sydenham says that there had been\r\ncomparatively little of it for ten years before, not including, doubtless,\r\nthe plague-year of 1665, when Sydenham was out of town[1425]. Both he and\r\nWillis are clear that there was a certain amount of it every year,\r\nalthough it was seldom fatal in ordinary seasons. The ordinary London\r\ndysentery, says Willis, though it be horrid or dreadful by reason of its\r\nbloody stools, and is most commonly of a long continuance, yet it is not\r\nvery contagious nor often mortal[1426]. Sydenham says that it was fatal\r\nmore particularly to aged persons, but highly benign in children, who\r\nmight be subject to it for months _sine quovis incommodo_. However, in\r\ncertain seasons it became malignant and caused a good many deaths.\r\n\r\n    It began usually with chills and shiverings, to which succeeded heat\r\n    of the whole body, and shortly after tormina with dejections; but\r\n    sometimes the griping and stools were the first symptoms. Always there\r\n    was intense suffering and “depression of the intestines,” with\r\n    frequent straining at stool. The stools were mucous, not\r\n    stercoraceous, and with traces of blood. The tongue might be whitish,\r\n    or dry and black; the strength was prostrated and the spirits faint.\r\n    After a time the streaks of blood in the motions would be replaced by\r\n    pure blood, without even mucus, a change which threatened a fatal end.\r\n    Sometimes the bowel became gangrenous, while aphthae would appear in\r\n    the mouth and fauces. If the patient were about to recover, the\r\n    symptoms would gradually be restricted to the rectum, in the form of\r\n    tenesmus. Willis says that the dysentery of the autumn of 1671 was\r\n    really a bloody one, and extraordinarily sharp and severe, hurrying\r\n    many to their graves. At the outset blood was voided plentifully, with\r\n    griping pains; there might be twenty stools in a day. Some were able\r\n    to rise after a week; but the malady would go on for several weeks or\r\n    even months. It was protracted also in fatal cases, the end being\r\n    marked by watchfulness, roughness of the tongue, thirst and thrush in\r\n    the mouth. He gives a case of a strong young man who recovered after\r\n    having had not only terrible bloody stools, but also bloody vomit,\r\n    which, Willis thought, might have come from ulceration of the stomach.\r\n    But with good diet and treatment most of those attacked escaped death.\r\n    Sometimes it became virulent and, as it were, pestilential, destroying\r\n    many and diffusing its infection very largely by contagion.\r\n\r\nIt was most common, says Willis, in camps and in prisons, by reason of the\r\nstench of the places and the evil diet. From what Sydenham was told by Dr\r\nButler, who accompanied Lord Henry Howard in his embassy to Morocco, the\r\ndysentery of North Africa was the same as that which prevailed in London,\r\nas an occasional epidemic, in 1669-70.\r\n\r\nThe dysentery of the siege of Londonderry and of the camp at Dundalk, both\r\nin the year 1689, have been described elsewhere. During the same reign,\r\nDr William Cockburn got fame and wealth by a secret remedy for dysentery,\r\nwhich was tried first on board the king’s ships at Portsmouth[1427]. In\r\n1693-99, there was dysentery in Scotland and in Wales. Of Scotland in\r\n1698, the climax of the “seven ill years,” Fletcher of Saltoun says: “From\r\nunwholesome food diseases are so multiplied among poor people that, if\r\nsome course be not taken, this famine may very probably be followed by a\r\nplague[1428].” A Welsh practitioner, who graduated at Dublin in 1697 said,\r\nin his thesis, that dysentery had raged for the space of three years in\r\nseveral maritime regions of South Wales so severely and had made such\r\nhavock that in not a few houses there were hardly one or two left to bury\r\nthe dead[1429]. Writing before the seven ill years, Sir Robert Sibbald\r\nmentions dysentery as one of the _dira morborum cohors_ that everywhere\r\naffected the Scots peasantry in the end of the 17th century, the causes of\r\nwhich were coarse food and excesses in spirit-drinking. In the century\r\nfollowing we hear of dysentery in Scotland in particular years, which\r\ncorrespond on the whole to the unwholesome seasons in England. Thus in\r\n1717, special mention is made of a fatal bloody flux in Lorn, Argyllshire.\r\nIn 1731 there were dysenteries in Edinburgh in autumn, often tedious,\r\nrarely mortal. In 1733, during the harvest months, dysenteries were\r\nfrequent and mortal in Fife, especially along the shores of the Firth of\r\nForth. In the following autumn (1734) many in Edinburgh were seized with a\r\ndysentery, which continued more or less epidemic all the winter: “It had\r\nthe ordinary symptoms of slight fever, frequent stools, for the most part\r\nbloody and mucous, violent gripes and an almost constant tenesmus”--being\r\nfatal to some and very tedious to others[1430]. This was a well-marked\r\ndysenteric period in Scotland, but just as much a rare or occasional\r\nexperience as the corresponding epidemic a century after in 1827-30. It\r\nappears to have lasted in various parts of Scotland until the end of 1737.\r\nA regimental surgeon, who was stationed at Glasgow in the end of 1735 and\r\nafterwards at Edinburgh, had 190 dysenteric patients (civil and military)\r\nfrom December, 1735, to February, 1738[1431]. The summer and autumn of\r\n1736 appear to have been its more severe seasons; it is heard of at St\r\nAndrews and in the country near it, at Kingsbarns and Crail (where “many\r\nof the boys” were seized), at Dalkeith, and in Glasgow and the\r\nneighbourhood, where one practitioner claims to have treated “some\r\nhundreds” with cerate of antimony[1432]. In the great period of epidemic\r\nfever shortly after, the years 1740 and 1741, flux in the Edinburgh bills\r\nof mortality has respectively 3 and 36 deaths, which would probably have\r\nmeant thirty to fifty times as many cases[1433].\r\n\r\nThe English epidemiographists, Wintringham, Hillary and Huxham, mention\r\ndysentery in certain years, which were the seasons of high general\r\nmortality. Wintringham’s first entry for York is under the year 1717, his\r\nsecond in 1723 (autumnal), a third in 1724 (some fluxus alvi with blood),\r\nin 1726 diarrhoeas and dysenteries “called morbus cholera,” and the same\r\nfor two or three weeks of September, 1727. Wintringham was one of the\r\nfirst in England to emphasize the seasonal connexion between dysenteries\r\nand agues. There was undoubtedly dysentery among the many forms of\r\nsickness in the disastrous years 1727-29. Huxham includes it among the\r\nfluxes which were common at Plymouth in 1734-36. A still greater\r\ndysenteric period followed the influenza epidemic of 1743, Huxham being\r\nagain the chief chronicler of it[1434].\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the 18th century, two periods were specially noted\r\nfor dysentery, the years about 1758-62 and 1780-82. The first of these\r\ncalled forth perhaps the only medical piece written by Dr Mark Akenside,\r\nphysician to St Thomas’s Hospital and author of the ‘Pleasures of the\r\nImagination[1435],’ as well as accounts by Sir G. Baker[1436] and Sir W.\r\nWatson[1437]. All three writers agree that the true epidemic prevalence\r\noccurred in London in the autumn of 1762. It is clear, however, that\r\nAkenside had been treating in St Thomas’s Hospital since 1759 many cases\r\nof true dysentery (which he defines as a bowel complaint with gripes,\r\ntenesmus and bloody or mucous evacuations). He had more than one hundred\r\nand thirty cases of it described in his ward-books in the five or six\r\nyears previous to his writing (1764); he had proved the good effects of\r\nipecacuanha on many in 1759; and he had remarked that the autumnal\r\ndysenteries of 1760, 1761 and 1762 in each case lasted the whole winter,\r\nnot abating until the spring. Perhaps this may have been a special\r\nexperience of the Surrey side of the Thames; for both Watson and Baker are\r\nclear that dysentery was something of a novelty to them in the early\r\nautumn of 1762. Says the former, writing to Huxham on 9 Dec. 1762: “We\r\nhave had here this autumn a disease which has not been in my remembrance\r\nepidemic at London. Very few of our physicians have seen this disorder as\r\nit has appeared of late. You mention it as frequent at Plymouth in the\r\nyear 1743....” And Baker begins his essay by saying that there became\r\nepidemic in London in the end of July, 1762, the disease of\r\ndysentery--“morbi genus hac in civitate novum feré, aut nuperis saltem\r\nannis inauditum[1438].”\r\n\r\n    The three observers agree that it attacked the poorer classes,\r\n    children more than adults, convalescents, lying-in women and the like.\r\n    Akenside says that it was mostly a slow non-febrile disease (in the\r\n    autumnal outburst of 1762, the subjects of it were more fevered), and\r\n    that some patients came to him who had been labouring under it for two\r\n    or three months. His account agrees on the whole with Sydenham’s for\r\n    the years 1669-72: some had vomiting, some had a painless flux\r\n    following the dysentery, some had dropsy as a sequel. In cases about\r\n    to end fatally there was a remission of the griping before the end; in\r\n    some there were aphthae of the mouth, stupor, and somnolence, with\r\n    cold sweats. Watson saw three children (of four or five years) die\r\n    from debility a week or more after the gripings and discharges had\r\n    ceased; they could keep down no food, and were greatly emaciated. In\r\n    another case, a young child, the motions were pure blood, and death\r\n    followed on the third day. Baker gives Hewson’s notes of the anatomy\r\n    in a case that was clearly one of follicular dysentery, as well as\r\n    Charlton Wollaston’s account of two other anatomies (mixed catarrhal\r\n    and follicular), with plates of the dysenteric bowel.\r\n\r\nWatson, physician to the Foundling Hospital, says that the dysentery, or\r\ndysenteric fever, was very prevalent among the children in 1762, the year\r\nof its most general prevalence[1439]. It may have been part of that\r\ndysenteric “constitution” which caused the following outbreak among the\r\nfoundlings at the hospital at Westerham, Kent, a branch of the Guilford\r\nStreet charity: “26 January, 1765. The apothecary visited the children at\r\nthe hospital at Westerham, January 12th, 1765, and found twenty ill with\r\ndysenteries, many of whom had the whooping-cough complicated with it. Two\r\nof them are since dead, which, with six that died before he went down,\r\nmake eight dead of that disease.” Two cases of dysentery were in the\r\ninfirmary of the Foundling Hospital in London on the 2nd of March,\r\n1765[1440]. These accounts of dysentery in London in the middle third of\r\nthe 18th century show it to have been then a very occasional malady and a\r\nvery small contributor to the bills of mortality.\r\n\r\nNext to the capital, the town that seems to have had most dysentery in the\r\n18th century was Newcastle, which had been also the seat of frequent and\r\nsevere plagues. There was much dysentery in it and in the neighbouring\r\nplaces on Tyneside during the autumns of 1758 and 1759, but the disease\r\nwas not epidemic in 1762, the season of the malady in London[1441]. It was\r\nprevalent among the same classes in Newcastle as in London--the poorer\r\nhouseholds, children, weakly persons. It recurred in the harvest quarter,\r\nin fine clear weather, when the days were almost as hot as at midsummer,\r\nbut the evenings and mornings remarkably cold and the nights frequently\r\nfoggy. The reason why the lower class of people were most liable to it\r\nseemed to be their “negligence in the article of cooling after heats by\r\nlabour, exercise, &c.” But there may have been something also in the soil\r\nand situation of Newcastle which made these common risks to be followed by\r\nso special an effect.\r\n\r\nThe Newcastle dysentery of 1758-59, two or three years earlier than the\r\nLondon epidemic, was the occasion of the essay by Dr Andrew Wilson, a work\r\nwhich compares favourably with the writings of the metropolitan\r\nphysicians. Among the symptoms of true autumnal dysentery he gives the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    “Constant fever, drought, parchedness of the mouth and throat,\r\n    dejection of the spirits, prostration of the strength, frequent\r\n    viscid, acid or bilious vomiting, flatulency in the belly, wringing\r\n    pain in the lower part of it, and often in the same region of the\r\n    back; these pains sometimes constant, but always preceding stools; an\r\n    almost constant pressing to stool, with great pain and irresistible\r\n    tendency to it at the same time, called a tenesmus; the stools\r\n    generally bloody, always slimy, and full of glary stuff, sometimes\r\n    mixed with a whitish matter of less tenacity, which appears in\r\n    separate little curdled-like parcels, often with blackish\r\n    corrupted-like bile; the stools always odiously fetid; they are seldom\r\n    natural without the assistance of purgatives, and then they are often\r\n    discharged in hard, dry little lumps; dryness of the skin, except when\r\n    clammy unbenign sweats are raised by the intenseness of the gripings\r\n    and tenesmus; great watchfulness, their sleep, when accidentally they\r\n    drop into any, being short and broken, with recurring pains which\r\n    awake them unrefreshed. These are the principal symptoms which attend\r\n    a true febrile dysentery. When such a disease is epidemic there are\r\n    many slight appearances of it which happily do not extend to all these\r\n    complaints, and which easily yield to proper applications.\r\n\r\n    The signs of danger in this disease are the violence with which all\r\n    the above symptoms appear. But the signs of immediate danger are,\r\n    decrease of pain, great sinking of the spirits, lowness of the pulse,\r\n    beginning coldness of the extremities, parchedness and blackness of\r\n    the tongue, aphthae; white scurf or ulceration of the throat and\r\n    fauces, and constant hiccup. When there is a cessation of pain,\r\n    intolerably fetid and involuntary stools, shiverings, with sometimes a\r\n    sense of coldness in the belly, a slight delirium, and often\r\n    unaccountable fits of agony, or rather anxiety; then the case is\r\n    beyond remedy, and the patient hastens to dissolution. This stage of\r\n    the disease is generally attended with a small obscure pulse and cold\r\n    extremities, but I have seen it in some particular cases otherwise.\r\n\r\n    ... When dysentery is epidemic, it is not uncommon for people who\r\n    escape the dysentery itself to have their stools altered from their\r\n    natural colour to sometimes a greenish hue, as if they had eaten much\r\n    herbs, sometimes of a clay colour, and sometimes quite blackish, as if\r\n    they had eaten a quantity of blood.... In 1759 particularly, it was\r\n    very common for numbers of people who escaped the dysentery to be\r\n    troubled with flatulencies, slight gripings and twitchings in the\r\n    belly, which was generally attended with blackish stools. Stranguaries\r\n    were likewise pretty frequent, and icteric complaints, or the\r\n    jaundice. The stranguary was a very common symptom in many fevers\r\n    which occurred during the prevalency of the dysentery. Another\r\n    complaint which frequently occurred during the last dysenteric season\r\n    was dry gripes.\r\n\r\n    The dysentery this last season [1759] differed in many respects from\r\n    its appearance in the former season. In the latter season greater\r\n    numbers had it in that slight degree which was attended with little\r\n    fever and no danger. In many who were seized with seemingly great\r\n    violence, it was unexpectedly checked when there appeared all reason\r\n    to apprehend it would have run to a much greater length. It was not\r\n    uncommon to find it complicated with agues, rheumatisms, &c., into the\r\n    latter of which it frequently degenerated. In the former season the\r\n    griping pains attending it were confined to the lower belly. In the\r\n    latter they were very ordinarily felt also in the back, along, as\r\n    might be supposed, the windings of the rectum and colon; yet, after\r\n    the dysenteric stools were in a great measure gone, and the disease\r\n    over, these pains often remained, or assumed the appearance of a\r\n    lumbago or sciatic, with pains striking down the thighs.... The more\r\n    the season advances, and the later in the year it is when persons are\r\n    seized with this epidemic, the more chronical do the symptoms of it\r\n    grow.”\r\n\r\nThe last sentence is probably the explanation of Akenside’s original\r\npoint, that dysentery was as much a winter as an autumnal malady, not\r\nreally abating until the spring. Wilson himself claims originality in the\r\nfollowing point relating to the sluggishness of the bowels in dysentery,\r\nhis treatment having been largely determined by that view of the\r\npathology:\r\n\r\n    “During the increase and height of this distemper, it is very\r\n    improperly called a flux. A proper flux, or diarrhoea, is a constant\r\n    flow of immoderately liquid but otherwise natural stools, dissolved by\r\n    too great an irritation upon, or too great a relaxation of, the\r\n    vessels destined for mollifying the faeces and lubricating the\r\n    passages by their humours; by which means they are disposed to dismiss\r\n    a superfluous quantity of them. But in the dysentery the passage of\r\n    the natural discharges is resisted, and their consistence is often\r\n    increased to such a degree that, when they are urged along by the\r\n    assistance of purgatives, they are excluded in unnaturally hard and\r\n    dry little lumps or balls” (p. 3). The question whether scybala were\r\n    an essential character of dysentery was often referred to in later\r\n    writings.\r\n\r\nNothing more is heard of dysentery at Newcastle until the date of the\r\nopening of the dispensary there, 1 October, 1777. From that date to 1\r\nSeptember, 1779, when the disease was not epidemic there, 72 cases were\r\ntreated from the dispensary.\r\n\r\n    Some importance, as regards priority, attaches to one of Dr Andrew\r\n    Wilson’s observations of the Newcastle dysentery of 1759: “It was not\r\n    uncommon to find it complicated with agues, rheumatisms, &c., into the\r\n    latter of which it frequently degenerated.” The pains, he says, were\r\n    not confined to the lower belly, but were felt also in the back; or,\r\n    after the dysentery was gone, the muscular pains remained as a lumbago\r\n    or sciatica, striking down the thighs. This curious relationship of\r\n    dysentery to rheumatism, shadowed forth in the Newcastle essay of 1761\r\n    [1760], was formally stated by Akenside in his essay of 1764, being\r\n    perhaps the best of his various attempted originalities. It was\r\n    afterwards taken up in Germany by Stoll, Richter, Zimmermann and\r\n    others in the 18th century, and was illustrated from the Dublin\r\n    epidemics of the 19th century by O’Brien[1442] and Harty[1443]. The\r\n    doctrine of a relationship between dysentery and acute rheumatism has\r\n    been discovered in the 7th century writer, Alexander of Tralles, but\r\n    erroneously. The Byzantine writer does indeed introduce into two\r\n    paragraphs on bowel-complaint the word ῥευματισμός--one of them\r\n    relating to the alvine profluvium attending fevers or following\r\n    fevers, the other relating to “dysenteria rheumatica[1444].” But it is\r\n    clear that he is merely ascribing to the diarrhoea in the one case and\r\n    to the dysentery in the other a rheumy nature, on certain theoretical\r\n    grounds of humoral pathology; there is no reference to joint pains or\r\n    muscular pains, or to anything else connoted in the later use of the\r\n    word rheumatism. The idea is originally an English one, from the\r\n    middle of the 18th century, and belongs most properly to Akenside,\r\n    although Wilson, a not less trained and capable observer, had recorded\r\n    the empirical fact three or four years earlier. Akenside was led to\r\n    regard dysentery “as a rheumatism of the intestines,” and to maintain\r\n    that “the cause and the _materies_ of each disease were\r\n    similar[1445].” Stoll adopted these phrases, adding that dysentery\r\n    differed from rheumatism of the joints “merely in form and situation.”\r\n    But for a few empirical facts, the relationship would be thought\r\n    fanciful. These, however, may be finger-post instances, pointing to\r\n    the true pathology of a somewhat mysterious malady. They are simple\r\n    enough: e.g. cases of dysentery have “degenerated,” as Wilson said,\r\n    into rheumatism; or cases of acute rheumatism, treated by purging,\r\n    have developed the gripings, tenesmus and stools of dysentery; or, in\r\n    a time of dysentery, cases have occurred in which the symptoms of the\r\n    latter were joined to those of acute rheumatism, or cases in which the\r\n    symptoms of the one disease obtained, say for twenty-four hours, to\r\n    give place to the symptoms of the other. Again there are countries\r\n    such as Lower Egypt where the frequency of dysentery is not more\r\n    remarkable than the frequency of rheumatic fever. Harty points out\r\n    that the rheumatic complications of dysentery seem to have arisen only\r\n    when the latter malady was improperly treated by opium and\r\n    astringents; but, howsoever the signs of affinity were called forth,\r\n    they may prove to be true indications for the pathology. The\r\n    circumstances of taking dysentery are those of taking rheumatic\r\n    fever--exposure to chill after being heated with labour[1446]. In\r\n    rheumatism the effect of the chill falls upon the great groups of\r\n    voluntary muscles, pain being manifested at the surfaces where the\r\n    muscular work is applied, namely the joints; while the redness, heat\r\n    and swelling are as if restricted to the tissues by which the muscles\r\n    become effective, namely the tendons, aponeuroses, ligaments and\r\n    synovial membranes[1447]. In dysentery, it may be said, the effect of\r\n    the chill falls upon the great involuntary muscle, that of the\r\n    intestine, or upon a section of it, a muscle which serves, so to\r\n    speak, as its own tendons and insertions, and is the seat of its own\r\n    pains, while the tissues next to the muscular, the submucosa and\r\n    mucosa with the lymph-follicles, become the seats of congestion,\r\n    inflammation and suppuration. In acute rheumatism, the muscles\r\n    generate heat without doing any work; in dysentery there is often\r\n    febrile heat (although not invariably), and the work of the\r\n    involuntary muscle is paroxysmal and ineffective. In some such way the\r\n    parallel suggested by Akenside might be followed out.\r\n\r\nAfter 1762, the next period of epidemic dysentery in England was from\r\nabout 1779 to 1785, a period when agues also were epidemic, as well as\r\nworkhouse fevers and typhus under its various names. In London it was\r\nprevalent in the autumns of 1779, 1780 and 1781, a strictly autumnal\r\ndisease like the diarrhoea of children or the cholera nostras of adults.\r\nFrom the list of symptoms, the latter disease must have formed part of the\r\ndysenteric epidemic:--“profuse watery evacuations, mucous evacuations\r\nmixed with blood, gripings, tenesmus, pain in the back and loins, fever.”\r\nSome had tormina without flux. Some few old and infirm died; but usually\r\nthe malady yielded to treatment[1448]. It is heard of also at Liverpool\r\nabout 1784[1449], and its prevalence at Plymouth called forth an\r\nessay[1450]. It must have been a considerable disease in the dockyard\r\ntowns; for a body of troops, originally numbering 2800, which arrived at\r\nKingston, Jamaica, in the beginning of August, had been put on board the\r\ntransports in March with much dysentery and putrid fever among them, so\r\nthat the diseases with which they put to sea became more violent during\r\nthe five months’ voyage, and caused many deaths. Arriving at Jamaica, four\r\nhundred were sent on shore sick, exhausted with flux and fever, of whom\r\nscarce the half recovered in the military hospitals[1451]. Here we have\r\nthe singular fact of transports from England bringing dysentery to\r\nJamaica. On the other hand, Clark, of Newcastle, who had seen much of\r\ntropical maladies, says that the dysentery which became epidemic there in\r\n1781 was introduced first into a dockyard by some sailors returned from\r\nabroad ill of the complaint, and that it soon spread among the workmen, of\r\nwhom several died. But it was epidemic in London the same year; and in\r\nNewcastle itself there were extensive epidemics in 1783 and 1785, for\r\nwhich no foreign source was sought or found. In those years it “attacked\r\ngreat numbers of the poor,” as well as some of the richer class, to which\r\nClark’s eleven cases from the epidemic of 1785 mostly belong. In the\r\nTables of diseases treated at the Dispensary, the epidemic dysentery of\r\n1783 and 1785 is credited with 329 cases, of which 17 were fatal; but\r\nthese, of course, were but a fraction of all that occurred in Newcastle\r\nand neighbourhood. Every year until 1805 there are a few cases of\r\ndysentery in the Dispensary books; but they become fewer to that year\r\n(except in 1801 when there were 23 cases), and at length disappear from\r\nthe list altogether. A remarkable outbreak of dysentery, within narrow\r\nlimits, occurred in a fishing village or “town” in the neighbourhood of\r\nAberdeen during some months of the spring and summer of 1789: “It has\r\nproved fatal to numbers. As such a disease could not be admitted into our\r\nhospital, a temporary one has been fitted up for those that are worst, and\r\nthe faculty here have given their attendance by rotation[1452].”\r\n\r\n\r\nDysentery in the 19th century.\r\n\r\nWillan, who was practising in London as early as 1785-6, says that\r\ndysentery had not been epidemic there from the autumn of 1780, until the\r\nautumn of 1800, his position at the Public Dispensary in Carey Street\r\nenabling him to know the prevalent diseases. In the autumn of 1800 the\r\nepidemic was extensive. There were, he says, some sporadic cases every\r\nautumn, but he never saw a fatal case of it[1453]. In Bateman’s\r\ncontinuation of the same records from 1804, dysentery first appears in\r\n1805 and remains sporadic every autumn. It was “very prevalent” in the\r\nautumn and winter of 1808, but not fatal; and it was not unusual among the\r\ndispensary patients every year until these records end in 1816[1454]. The\r\nyears 1800-02 form one of the more distinct dysenteric periods also for\r\nIreland and Scotland. Old Glasgow practitioners in the severe epidemic of\r\n1827-28 recalled the fact that they had last seen the disease about 1802,\r\nand the books of the Glasgow Infirmary bore witness to its prevalence from\r\n1800 to 1803 or 1804. In 1801-2 there was a good deal of it also at\r\nHamilton, among a regiment of dragoons as well as among the people at\r\nlarge[1455]. The troops in various parts of Ireland suffered from it in\r\nthe same years[1456]. In 1808, during a somewhat unwholesome season in\r\nwhich agues also were met with, some cases of dysentery were admitted to\r\nthe General Infirmary of Nottingham[1457]. An altogether exceptional\r\noutbreak of a dysenteric nature occurred in 1823 among the prisoners in\r\nMilbank Penitentiary[1458].\r\n\r\nThe great dysenteric period of the 19th century coincided with, or\r\nfollowed, the two hot summers of 1825 and 1826, the latter of which was\r\nprobably the hottest and driest summer of the century. Of its prevalence\r\nin and near Leeds in 1825, Thackrah says it was “before almost unknown as\r\nan epidemic to the present practitioners of this district.” In the same\r\nsummer it was unusually common in Dublin, and was epidemic the next year\r\nin other parts of Ireland as well (_supra_, p. 271). In Glasgow it began\r\nabout the end of July, 1827, in the flat district to the south of the\r\nClyde, and in the course of the autumn became prevalent in all parts of\r\nthe city. An outbreak of plague itself could hardly have caused more\r\nsurprise, so strange was dysentery to that generation. A few deaths by it\r\nin one crowded street of the Gorbals were mentioned in a newspaper before\r\nthe disease had become general, and “gave rise to that groundless fear\r\nwhich pervaded and distracted the public mind during the whole course of\r\nthe epidemic[1459].”\r\n\r\n    The symptoms were severe and alarming, but the fatalities were few,\r\n    perhaps not more than one in fifty attacks. The proper dysenteric\r\n    symptoms usually lasted from ten to fourteen days, and were followed\r\n    by diarrhoea, it might be, for many weeks. The morbid anatomy showed\r\n    in the mucous membrane of the great intestine the three degrees of\r\n    congestion, follicular ulceration and sloughing of the whole mucous\r\n    coat (in the sigmoid flexure and rectum). The cases were nearly all\r\n    above the age of puberty, and among the poorer classes. September and\r\n    October were the worst months. The weather was remarkably close, damp\r\n    and relaxing. One practitioner saw two cases of genuine ague in\r\n    natives of Glasgow, having never seen a case of ague before. The\r\n    ordinary cholera nostras of summer and autumn was much less frequent\r\n    than for several years before, and it was the general remark that it\r\n    had given place to the dysentery.\r\n\r\nHaving declined in the winter of 1827-28, it revived in May, and again\r\nreached a great height in the autumn of 1828, while cases of it (probably\r\nchronic, or renewals of old attacks) continued to the summer of 1830. The\r\nfollowing table shows the number of cases treated by the poor’s surgeons\r\nin the several seasons, 1827-30; the 435 cases in the autumn of 1827 were\r\nnearly a third part of all the cases so treated (1462):\r\n\r\n_Cases of Dysentery in Glasgow treated by the Surgeons to the Poor._\r\n\r\n  Quarter           1827     1828     1829    1830\r\n\r\n  Feb.-April         --       28       29      26\r\n  May-July           --       62       35      26\r\n  Aug.-Oct.         435      261       50      --\r\n  Nov.-Jan.         143       68       22      --\r\n\r\nIt extended to the villages and country districts all round Glasgow. It\r\nwas believed to be somewhat general in Scotland in 1827-28, but the only\r\nanswers to a circular of queries sent out by the editors of the ‘Glasgow\r\nMedical Journal’ came from Hamilton (and Bothwell), Ayr and Callander\r\n(including the flooded valley of the Teith and the Braes of\r\nBalquhiddar)[1460].\r\n\r\nIn Edinburgh the outbreak of dysentery began about the end of July, 1828,\r\na year later than in Glasgow, just as the epidemic in that city was a year\r\nor more later than in Dublin. Attacks of it were numerous among the\r\npatients admitted to the Edinburgh Infirmary for other diseases; but it\r\noccurred at the same time throughout the city generally and in the country\r\naround; “nor has it been confined entirely to the lower orders.” In the\r\nimperfectly kept register of the Infirmary there were 42 admissions, with\r\n11 deaths, from August to October. Christison, who treated some of these,\r\nhad never seen dysentery before[1461]. The morbid anatomy was the same as\r\nat Glasgow--congestions, numerous small ulcerations especially of the\r\ntransverse colon, or sloughing of considerable portions of the mucous\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\n    In the same years 1827-28 there was much dysentery in the Lunatic\r\n    Asylum at Wakefield. It is well known that aged paupers in workhouses\r\n    or asylums are peculiarly subject to the epidemic influences that\r\n    produce diarrhoeal or choleraic sickness; and there had been much of\r\n    that disease in the West Riding Asylum from its opening in 1819. Some\r\n    cases of dysentery had also occurred, but it was not until after the\r\n    exceptional summer of 1826 that they became common. In 1828 there were\r\n    55 cases among 375 inmates, mostly in old and incurable lunatics, the\r\n    fatalities being at the very high rate of one in four. The morbid\r\n    anatomy was that of true dysentery--follicular ulceration in the\r\n    transverse colon, with occasional sloughing of large pieces of the\r\n    mucous membrane. The whole sewage of the asylum collected in cesspools\r\n    or “tanks of ordure” within a few feet of the wards[1462].\r\n\r\nThe causes of the rare and surprising outbreak of dysentery in 1827-28\r\nwere much debated. In Glasgow it was remarked that the choleraic\r\ncomplaints of the summer and autumn were much less frequent than usual;\r\nalso that the first season of it, the year 1827, was remarkable for rain\r\nevery day for some months, and for a close, oppressive, relaxing\r\natmosphere. Brown, of Glasgow, thought the weather might account for it,\r\nthe labouring class being thereby made peculiarly subject to heats and\r\nchills, which, grafted upon the usual bowel-complaints of the season,\r\neasily turned them to dysentery. Dr Andrew Buchanan was of opinion that\r\nexhalations from the soil were the chief, if not the sole, exciting cause\r\nof dysentery, reserving the question of contagiousness. Other forms of\r\nmiasmatic febrile disease, formerly rare, had, he said, made their\r\nappearance of late years and become epidemic. Christison had already\r\nspoken in the same sense for the Edinburgh outbreak. For five or six\r\nweeks, he said, before the dysentery appeared there in the end of July,\r\n1828, the tendency to bowel affections during the epidemic fever (which\r\nwas chiefly of the relapsing type) was increased in a very marked degree.\r\nThe same tendency continued throughout the whole progress of the\r\ndysentery; “nay in some instances true acute dysentery was formed during\r\nthe height or towards the termination of continued fever; and now that the\r\ndysentery has in great measure disappeared, or assumed a mild form, the\r\ntendency of low gastro-enteric inflammation to accompany continued fever\r\nis very strongly marked, perhaps is more frequent than ever.” This may\r\nrelate to a remarkable outbreak of fever among the richer classes in the\r\nNew Town of Edinburgh, more talked about than written on, which seems to\r\nhave been enteric or typhoid, according to the clinical history of a case\r\nof it that came from Edinburgh to Hamilton and was recorded by a physician\r\nof the latter place[1463]. It was more especially that strange epidemic in\r\nEdinburgh that Dr Andrew Buchanan had in mind when he wrote that the\r\ndysentery of 1827-28 was not the only disease due to exhalations from the\r\nsoil with which Scotland had of late been visited[1464]. This is an\r\ninstructive line to take in seeking an explanation of the dysentery of\r\n1827-28, even if we keep something of the old doctrine of heats and chills\r\nas affecting those who labour in a damp atmosphere. The ground-water\r\ntheory of miasmatic infective diseases was not then formulated; but there\r\nhas rarely been in our latitudes so signal an instance of extreme drought\r\nand heat followed by excessive dampness as in the two years 1825 and 1826,\r\nand the year 1827. The second dry year, 1826, was certainly the season\r\nwhen enteric fever was described and figured for the first time in London.\r\nIt was said, also, that enteric cases occurred among the relapsing fever\r\nand dysentery of Dublin in the same year; and enteric cases are known to\r\nhave occurred in Edinburgh towards the end of the epidemic of relapsing\r\nfever and dysentery, which was one or two years later in that city than in\r\nDublin. In Glasgow, where the dysentery was probably a more extensive\r\noutbreak than elsewhere, there appears to have been at that time no\r\nenteric fever; in London, on the other hand, where there was a good deal\r\nof the latter, there does not appear to have been any notable prevalence\r\nof dysentery.\r\n\r\nAlong with the cholera nostras which was unusually common in the autumn of\r\n1831, just before the outbreak of Asiatic cholera, there was some\r\ndysentery, notably an epidemic at Bolton[1465]. At the end of the Asiatic\r\ncholera of 1832 a succession of cases of dysentery occurred in the\r\nEdinburgh Charity Workhouse[1466].\r\n\r\nThe next occasion of dysentery was the autumn of 1836, which was, like\r\nthat of 1827, a wet season. The outbreak at Glasgow on this occasion is\r\nrecorded only in a few figures (the medical journal of the city having\r\nceased to appear for a time), according to which there were 144 cases\r\nthroughout the year treated by the surgeons to the poor, of which 8 were\r\nfatal, and 15 cases sent to the Infirmary, of which 4 were fatal[1467]. At\r\nDundee also, from October to December, 1836, bowel-complaints were not\r\nunusual among the cases of typhus, which occurred in hundreds. “Many of\r\nthe cases of diarrhoea and dysentery,” said Arrott, “occurred in\r\nDecember, and were accompanied by catarrhal and rheumatic symptoms,\r\nimplying an origin distinct from the bilious diarrhoea and bilious\r\nvomiting of summer.” Of 22 cases of dysentery at the Infirmary, 2 were\r\nfatal[1468].\r\n\r\nNext year, 1837, there occurred in Somersetshire a remarkable epidemic\r\nwhich was for the most part dysenteric. It was seen first at Bridgewater,\r\nand in July it caused two deaths at Taunton, where it afterwards prevailed\r\nwith high malignancy. Of 223 deaths, 206 were set down to dysentery, 16 to\r\ndiarrhoea and 1 to cholera; the high ratio of children’s deaths in the\r\nfollowing table of ages is in accordance with other recent experiences to\r\nbe given in the sequel:\r\n\r\n                                                     Over\r\n    Ages 0-5 -10 -15 -20 -30 -40 -50 -60 -70 -80 -90  90\r\n\r\n  Deaths  93  17  11   7   6   3   7  16  26  24  11   2\r\n\r\nThe monthly mortalities were, 75 in August, 105 in September, 29 in\r\nOctober, 10 in November, 2 in December. The epidemic spread partially\r\namongst the unions around Taunton[1469].\r\n\r\nIn London from the beginning of registration (1837) until 1846, the deaths\r\nset down to dysentery averaged fully a hundred in the year--a statistical\r\nfact to which there is nothing corresponding in contemporary writings:\r\nWatson said it was hardly ever seen in practice except in the chronic form\r\namong sailors and soldiers who had contracted it abroad. During the\r\nprevalence of the “Irish fever” of 1846-48, the disease was truly epidemic\r\nand a cause of many deaths along with typhus itself, especially in\r\nLiverpool and mostly among destitute Irish. In 1846 it was in Milbank\r\nPenitentiary[1470]. A most instructive instance of its connexion with the\r\nIrish emigration occurred at Penzance in the summer and autumn of 1848.\r\n\r\n    The brig ‘Sandwich’ sailed from Cork for Boston, U. S., in the end of\r\n    May, carrying a number of Irish farmers and their families. Having met\r\n    with rough weather and head winds she put in leaky to Penzance on 7\r\n    June, sixteen days out from Cork. The provisions had been bad and\r\n    there was sickness in the ship, with a very filthy state of things.\r\n    Three of the women passengers died on shore of dysentery. The ship\r\n    sailed again on 10 July, two more of the emigrants dying of dysentery\r\n    before she reached Boston, while two of the crew survived the attack.\r\n    On 16 July, two cases of the same disease occurred among the lower\r\n    class in Penzance, and thereafter the epidemic spread widely through\r\n    most parts of the town and the three adjoining parishes of Madron,\r\n    Galval and Paul, causing a great mortality, as in the following table:\r\n\r\n    _Deaths from Dysentery in Penzance and three adjoining parishes._\r\n\r\n    1848\r\n\r\n                                                           Deaths from all\r\n              Deaths from     Deaths from        Total        causes in\r\n             Dysentery in     Dysentery in    deaths from  Penzance and 3\r\n             Penzance town  3 other parishes   Dysentery   other parishes\r\n\r\n    July          5                0               5             31\r\n    August       37                1              38             71\r\n    Sept.        26               12              38             67\r\n    Oct.         13                9              22             48\r\n    Nov.          1                1               2             31\r\n                 --               --             ---            ---\r\n                 82               23             105            248\r\n\r\n    As many as five hundred cases were under medical treatment in the\r\n    town. No death occurred there or in the three parishes within the\r\n    registration district after 10 November, “but very many in the country\r\n    beyond its limits.” Of the 105 deaths in the table, 46 were of young\r\n    children, 35 of aged persons, and 24 between the ages of five and\r\n    sixty years[1471]. There was no resisting the evidence that an\r\n    infection had been introduced by the weather-bound Irish emigrants;\r\n    instances were also known of new foci in the country districts having\r\n    been created by domestics or others suffering from dysentery who had\r\n    been sent from Penzance to their homes. At the same time the summer\r\n    had been exceptionally wet, the rainfall having been as follows:\r\n\r\n             Inches of rain\r\n\r\n        May     0·777\r\n        June    3·287\r\n        July    3·277\r\n        Aug.    4·972\r\n        Sept.   3·042\r\n        Oct.    4·425\r\n        Nov.    3·981\r\n\r\n    A singular epidemic of dysentery occurred between the 14th and 26th\r\n    September, 1853, among the thirty-six inmates of a row of nine\r\n    cottages near the village of Hermiston, five miles west of Edinburgh.\r\n    Seven children were attacked, of whom six died, and six adults, who\r\n    all recovered. Besides these there were three cases among the four\r\n    inmates of a cottage about a hundred yards away, and one case in each\r\n    of two houses in the adjacent village of Hermiston. Christison found\r\n    that a drain which received the sewage or slops of the hamlet was in a\r\n    most offensive state, having been choked probably for years, and that\r\n    the water of a well near it was foetid. These are the conditions that\r\n    have often caused village epidemics of enteric fever in recent times;\r\n    but there was no doubt that the disease in this case was\r\n    dysentery[1472]. Another asylum outbreak of dysentery occurred in 1865\r\n    in the Cumberland and Westmoreland Asylum[1473].\r\n\r\nPerhaps the last general prevalence of dysentery was during the Asiatic\r\ncholera of 1849, when the house-to-house visitations in Leeds and some\r\nother towns brought to light a somewhat surprising number of cases mixed\r\nwith the more ordinary bowel-complaints of the season.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to trace the subsequent history of dysentery in England\r\nby the usual statistical means of the Registrar-General’s tables of the\r\ncauses of death, for the reason that dysentery, a rare and curious disease\r\nof all ages in this country, is merged with diarrhoea, one of the\r\ncommonest causes of infantile mortality. However, it is not likely that\r\nany such epidemic outbursts, local or general, as those described for\r\ncertain years of the 18th and 19th centuries could have occurred without\r\ntheir being otherwise known. It may be safely said that there has been\r\nlittle of it in this country for the last thirty or forty years, except\r\namong a few soldiers, sailors or others returned from abroad; in Ireland\r\nitself, the immemorial “country disease” has now only a small annual total\r\nof deaths.\r\n\r\nOne of the last experiences of dysentery in an English port was\r\ninstructive for the relation of the disease to typhus fever.\r\n\r\n    On 16 February, 1861, an Egyptian frigate, the ‘Scheah Gehaed,’ sent\r\n    from Alexandria to be fitted with new engines, arrived in the Mersey.\r\n    The only European on the ship was her commander, an Austrian. She\r\n    carried 476 men, mostly Arabs, with a small proportion of Nubians and\r\n    Abyssinians. Some two hundred were convicts, who had been brought on\r\n    board in chained gangs. The passage had been long and stormy, and\r\n    attended with much sickness, dysenteric and diarrhoeal; one man died\r\n    and was thrown overboard two or three days before the ship reached\r\n    Liverpool. The pilot who boarded her was at once struck by the\r\n    horrible state of filth of the ’tween decks; he remained two days on\r\n    board, and on returning home said to his wife, “This frigate will be\r\n    heard of yet.” He sickened in about a week of malignant typhus and\r\n    died. Two others who boarded the ship took typhus, of whom one\r\n    recovered. There had been no fever on board during the voyage.\r\n    Thirty-two of the Arabs or Nubians were admitted to the Southern\r\n    Hospital suffering, most of them, from dysentery or diarrhoea. Typhus\r\n    fever attacked 17 of the ordinary patients, 2 nurses, 2 porters, 2\r\n    house-surgeons and 2 others in the hospital, of whom several died. The\r\n    Arabs &c. to the number of 340 were taken in batches of 80 a day to a\r\n    public bath, in which they remained three hours. Typhus broke out\r\n    among the bath attendants. The whole number of cases of typhus traced\r\n    to the ship was 31, of which 8 were fatal. The ship was sunk in the\r\n    graving dock in order to clean her[1474].\r\n\r\nThis is a classical instance of the breeding of typhus from the effluvia\r\nof dysentery, of which other instances, on a greater scale, have been\r\ngiven in connexion with the Jamaica expedition of 1655 (in the former\r\nvolume), the siege of Londonderry and the camp of Dundalk in 1689, the\r\nhospitals after the battle of Dettingen in 1743, and the Irish famine of\r\n1846-48.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nASIATIC CHOLERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indian or Asiatic cholera, which first showed itself on British soil\r\nin one or more houses on the Quay of Sunderland in the month of October,\r\n1831, was a “new disease” in a more real sense than anything in this\r\ncountry since the sweating sickness of 1485. The English profession had\r\nbeen hearing a good deal about it for some years before it reached our\r\nshores. The outbreak in Lower Bengal in 1817, from which the modern\r\nhistory of cholera dates, had been the subject of reports and essays by\r\nAnglo-Indian physicians and surgeons; an extensive prevalence of it in the\r\nMadras Presidency shortly after, as well as in Mauritius in 1819 and 1829,\r\nhad been observed by other medical men in the service of the East India\r\nCompany or of the British army or navy. Many who had seen cholera in\r\nIndia, and some who had written upon it, returned to England in due\r\ncourse, so that the formidable new pestilence of the East began to be\r\nheard of in medical circles at home. Various essays upon it issued from\r\nthe English press between 1821 and 1830[1475]; and in 1825 it appeared for\r\nthe first time, and at considerable length, in the pages of an English\r\nsystematic treatise, the new edition of Dr Mason Good’s ‘Study of\r\nMedicine.’\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1829, Asiatic cholera had obtained no footing in Europe. The\r\nfirst great movement westwards from India through Central Asia, which was\r\ncontinuous with the memorable eruption in Bengal after the rains of 1817,\r\nhad reached to Astrakhan, at the mouths of the Volga, and had there caused\r\nthe deaths of some 144 persons in September, 1823. Another progress\r\nwestwards from India, after an interval of six years, reached the soil of\r\nEuropean Russia in the Government of Orenburg in August 1829, the\r\nmortality in the whole province during the autumn and winter (to February,\r\n1830) amounting to about one thousand. A much more severe epidemic of it\r\narose in the summer of 1830 in the town and province of Astrakhan\r\n(supposed to have been introduced by an infected brig from Baku), which\r\nspread with enormous rapidity, destroying in the course of a month some\r\nfour thousand in Astrakhan itself and upwards of twenty thousand in other\r\nparts of the province[1476]. Thus established in the basin of the Volga,\r\nAsiatic cholera overran the whole of Russia. Before the spring of 1831 it\r\nhad entered Hungary and Poland, and in the end of May had reached Danzig\r\nand other German ports on the Baltic and North Seas. Lord Heytesbury, the\r\nBritish Ambassador at St Petersburg, had sent home a despatch upon it\r\nearly in 1831; in April, the Admiralty issued orders for a strict\r\nquarantine of all arrivals from Russia at British ports, which were\r\nafterwards extended to arrivals from all ports abroad invaded or\r\nthreatened by cholera. On 20 June a royal proclamation ordering various\r\nprecautions was issued, and next day a Board of Health was gazetted,\r\ncomposed of leading physicians in London and of the medical heads of\r\ndepartments, with Sir Henry Halford as president. Local Boards of Health\r\nwere formed voluntarily in many parts of the country during the summer of\r\n1831. Two medical men were at the same time commissioned by the Government\r\nto proceed to Russia to study the disease there, their letters to the\r\nBoard of Health commencing from the 1st of July. The growing interest in\r\nthe disease as it came nearer called forth another crop of writings, some\r\nof them based on old Indian experience, others speculative[1477]. The most\r\nimportant of these was the treatise by Orton, which had been published in\r\nits original form at Madras in 1820. Writing from Yorkshire in August,\r\n1831, he surmised (with a proviso that no one could say confidently what\r\nmight happen) that Asiatic cholera might be expected to be a mild\r\nvisitation upon Britain at large, falling most upon the large\r\nmanufacturing towns in which typhus was common, but that it would be “far\r\notherwise” with Ireland owing to its chronic poverty, distress and\r\nover-population. By a singular chance the only town which he specially\r\nmentioned in England was Sunderland, where, he had been told by Dr Clanny,\r\nthere had been an unusual number of cases of malignant cholera nostras in\r\nthe early part of the autumn: “it is greatly to be feared,” he said, “that\r\nthose are but the skirts of the approaching shower[1478].”\r\n\r\nIn other places besides Sunderland there had been perhaps more than the\r\nusual amount of summer diarrhoea in 1831. Dr Burne, in his London\r\ndispensary reports, entered on the 2nd and 16th July an unusual prevalence\r\nof “dysenteric diarrhoea and cholera,” and cases of scarlet fever of an\r\n“adynamic” type or with a tendency to fatal collapse[1479]. (Clanny\r\nobserved the same type of scarlatina at Sunderland along with some\r\ntyphus.) Choleraic disorders were uncommonly rife on board the ships of\r\nwar in the Medway[1480]. A succession of twenty-four cases at Port\r\nGlasgow, from 2 July to 2 August, chiefly among workers in Riga flax, gave\r\nrise to an alarm of the real Asiatic cholera, the more readily that the\r\nfirst case was fatal (the only death)[1481]. Similar alarms arose at Leith\r\nand Hull.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsiatic Cholera at Sunderland in October, 1831.\r\n\r\nIn the end of July and in August, Sunderland and the adjoining villages\r\nand farms in the valley of the Wear were visited with “a very general\r\nprevalence of the indigenous cholera of the country, bearing in most\r\ninstances its usual leading feature--that of excessive bilious\r\ndischarges[1482].” Few, who were not attacked with actual cholera nostras,\r\nwere altogether free, it was said, from diarrhoea or disordered digestion.\r\nMany of the choleraic cases were unusually malignant, of which the\r\nfollowing are instances:\r\n\r\n    Allison, aged fifty, a painter of earthenware residing in a low\r\n    situation on the bank of the Wear two miles above the town, was\r\n    attacked at 4 a.m. on the 5th of August with vomiting and purging of a\r\n    watery whitish fluid, like oatmeal and water. His hands and feet were\r\n    cold, his skin covered with clammy sweat, his face livid and the\r\n    expression anxious, his eyes sunken, his lips blue, thirst excessive,\r\n    his breath cold, his voice weak and husky, and his pulse almost\r\n    imperceptible. He passed into a stage of reactive fever and got well.\r\n    Arnott, a farm-labourer on the opposite bank of the Wear from the man\r\n    Allison, was seized at 2 a.m. on the 8th August with precisely the\r\n    same symptoms, and died in twelve hours. Neither he nor Allison had\r\n    any intercourse or relation with seamen or the shipping of\r\n    Sunderland[1483]. Another case on the 8th of August came to light\r\n    afterwards. A woman in the village of West Bolden, four miles from\r\n    Sunderland, on the Newcastle road, was found by a surgeon from the\r\n    town to be suffering from choleraic sickness, of which she died twelve\r\n    hours from its onset[1484].\r\n\r\n    A week after these cases in the country not far from Sunderland, there\r\n    occurred the death, on 14 August, of one of the Wear pilots named\r\n    Henry. He had been troubled with diarrhoea for some time before, but\r\n    not so as to keep him from his occupation. Having gone down in the\r\n    direction of Flamborough Head to look for ships, he picked up a vessel\r\n    between that and the Wear, piloted her in, and, a few days after,\r\n    piloted her out again. The identity of the vessel was never traced,\r\n    but it was alleged that she had come from an infected port abroad. The\r\n    last time Henry was in his boat he was seized with violent vomiting\r\n    and purging, and died at his house after an illness of twenty hours. A\r\n    brother pilot, who looked in at the house on the day of his death,\r\n    fell into a similar choleraic disorder, but recovered[1485]. On the\r\n    28th of August a shipwright died of the same; also about the end of\r\n    August two persons at a distance of four or five miles from\r\n    Sunderland. In September, it is said, there were other cases and\r\n    fatalities. Early in October the authentic particulars of cholera in\r\n    Sunderland begin. Dixon attended one case, which was fatal on the 9th\r\n    October. Another case, which came to light three months after, was\r\n    that of a girl of twelve, named Hazard, residing on the Fish Quay, who\r\n    was well enough on Sunday the 16th October to have been twice at\r\n    church. She was seized in the middle of the night following with the\r\n    sudden and appalling symptoms of choleraic disease and died on the\r\n    Monday afternoon[1486]. A few doors off on the same quay lived a\r\n    keelman named Sproat, aged sixty; he occupied a large, clean,\r\n    well-ventilated room on the first-floor of a house in the most open\r\n    part of the quay, opposite to a crowded part of the anchorage. He was\r\n    in failing health, and had been troubled with diarrhoea for a week or\r\n    ten days previous to the 19th October, on which day he had to give up\r\n    work. Next day, Thursday, the 20th, a surgeon who had been sent for\r\n    found him vomiting and purging, but not at all collapsed, with no\r\n    thirst, and in good spirits. He improved so much that on Friday he had\r\n    toasted cheese for supper and on Saturday a mutton chop for dinner,\r\n    after which he went out to his keel on the river for a few minutes. On\r\n    his return he was seized with rigor, cramps, vomiting and purging.\r\n    Medical aid was not sent for until seven on Sunday morning, when he\r\n    was found in a sinking state, pulseless, speaking in a husky whisper,\r\n    his face livid and pinched, his limbs cramped, the purgings like “meal\r\n    washings.” He continued like that for three days, and died on\r\n    Wednesday, the 26th October, at noon.\r\n\r\nThis came to be reckoned the first death from Asiatic cholera in England.\r\n\r\n    His grandchild, a girl of eleven, while moving about the room an hour\r\n    after the death, was suddenly seized with faintness, pains in the\r\n    stomach-region, vomiting and purging of watery matters; she was taken\r\n    to the Infirmary and soon got well. The day after his father’s death,\r\n    Thursday, the 27th October, William Sproat, junior, a fine athletic\r\n    young keelman, who had attended on his parent during his illness, was\r\n    found lying in a low damp cellar near to the Fish Quay, suffering from\r\n    choleraic symptoms; he had been ill only a few hours, and was removed\r\n    (with his daughter as above) to the Infirmary the same evening. He\r\n    became gradually worse: on the 30th he was continually throwing\r\n    himself about, moaning and biting the bedclothes; on the 31st he was\r\n    lying on his back comatose, his eyes open, the pupils wide and\r\n    insensible, and the breathing stertorous, in which state he died the\r\n    same day. An old nurse at the Infirmary (Turnbull) helped to place the\r\n    body in the coffin, went to bed in a state of considerable fear, and\r\n    was seized at one in the morning with symptoms of cholera, of which\r\n    she died after a few hours.\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile there had been two other fatal cases unconnected with the\r\n    Sproats or the Fish Quay. On the quay of Monk Wearmouth, across the\r\n    river, lived a shoemaker named Rodenburg, aged thirty-five. He\r\n    occupied a poor hovel and had a large family, but he was in good work\r\n    and wages. On Sunday, the 30th October, he had pork for dinner, and\r\n    what was left of it for supper. In the middle of the night he was\r\n    seized with vomiting, and with purging of a fluid like water-gruel in\r\n    vast quantities; when visited by the medical men, he spoke in a husky\r\n    whisper, his nails were blue, his skin livid, covered by cold sweat,\r\n    his limbs cramped. The spasms ceased about nine o’clock on Monday\r\n    morning; about noon he asked to be raised in bed, and died as they\r\n    were raising him. On the very same night, between Sunday and Monday, a\r\n    keelman named Wilson, who lived with his wife in a decent room in the\r\n    High Street, and had attended the Methodist chapel on Sunday, was\r\n    seized with cholera at 4 a.m. on Monday, and died the same afternoon\r\n    at three.\r\n\r\nThese six cases within a few days, all fatal but that of the girl of\r\neleven, looked like the real Asiatic disease. Kell, an army\r\nassistant-surgeon stationed at Sunderland with the reserve companies of\r\nthe 82nd Regiment, had suspected that the earlier case of the pilot Henry\r\nwas true Asiatic cholera (which he had seen in Mauritius in 1829), and had\r\nwritten to the Board of Health. At a meeting of the faculty at the\r\nInfirmary on the morning after the admission of Sproat junior and his\r\nchild (28th October), Kell urged upon them that the disease was Asiatic\r\ncholera, but all the twelve present, save Dr Clanny, who was in the chair,\r\nmaintained that it was common indigenous cholera. However, when the\r\nyounger Sproat died, and the nurse after him, and two others in different\r\nparts of the town, a full meeting of medical men at the Exchange came\r\nunanimously to the opinion that these were cases of “spasmodic cholera.” A\r\nmeeting of the Board of Health and leading citizens was at once held, who\r\nwere informed that, in the unanimous opinion of the medical gentlemen of\r\nthe town, “spasmodic cholera prevailed in Sunderland.” The authorities in\r\nLondon having been kept informed (principally by Kell), a surgeon of\r\nIndian experience was sent down by the Board of Health on the 5th\r\nNovember, and a colonel by the lords of the Council on the 6th, to act as\r\ncommissioners.\r\n\r\n    It happened that no more cases occurred for three days after the death\r\n    of the nurse at the Infirmary; so that the doctors, like Pharaoh in\r\n    the intervals between the plagues of Egypt, were beginning to repent\r\n    of their diagnosis. The shipping trade of Sunderland was threatened by\r\n    these newspaper alarms, and by the presence of two Government\r\n    commissioners in the town; while Kell was demanding a ship of war off\r\n    the mouth of the Wear, and a battery on shore, to make the quarantine\r\n    respected. The Marquis of Londonderry, interested in the coal-trade,\r\n    wrote to the _Standard_ that the alarm was false. The magistrates,\r\n    shipowners and leading residents, who had met on the 9th November to\r\n    raise money for a cholera hospital, assembled again in various public\r\n    meetings or caucuses on the 10th and 11th, and passed resolutions that\r\n    there was no Indian or other foreign imported cholera in Sunderland,\r\n    that it was a wicked and malicious falsehood to say there was, and\r\n    that there was no need of quarantine on the Wear. One of these\r\n    meetings was attended by fifteen medical men (most of them from the\r\n    residential suburb of Bishop Wearmouth), who severally expressed the\r\n    opinion in various terms, that the recent fatal cases were aggravated\r\n    cases of English cholera, not contagious or infectious, while three\r\n    more sent letters backing up Lord Londonderry and the shipowners. On\r\n    the 12th of November, twenty-seven medical men signed a declaration to\r\n    the same effect. Some of these remained unconvinced by the progress of\r\n    events, Dixon arguing as late as 23 January, 1832, that the epidemic\r\n    in Sunderland, which was by that time over, had been one of\r\n    “spontaneous malignant cholera.”\r\n\r\nTwo new seizures occurred on the 7th November, none on the 8th, seven on\r\nthe 9th, one on the 10th, and so on for fully six weeks longer until\r\nChristmas, when the cases became very occasional, so that on the 9th of\r\nJanuary, 1832, Sunderland was declared by the Board of Health to be free\r\nof cholera. The largest number of seizures reported on one day was\r\nnineteen on the 8th of December; on the 10th of that month there were\r\nsixty-three cases under treatment at once; the whole number of cases from\r\n23rd October to 31st December was 418, of which 202 were fatal; the whole\r\ndeaths at Sunderland by the cholera of 1831-32 are given at 215, so that\r\nthe epidemic exhausted itself there before it had well begun elsewhere in\r\nthe country. The effect of it upon the death-rate is shown in a comparison\r\nof the burials for November and December in three successive years[1487]:\r\n\r\n_Burials in the parish of Sunderland._\r\n\r\n              November        December\r\n\r\n  1829           29              44\r\n  1830           39              76\r\n  1831          122             127\r\n\r\nThe way by which the virus entered Sunderland was never traced. It was\r\nknown, however, that deaths from cholera had occurred among the crews of\r\nSunderland ships lying at Cronstadt and Riga; and as it was the practice\r\nfor vessels owned in Sunderland to come home from their summer trading\r\ntowards the end of the season, so as to lay up during the winter, it was\r\nsuspected that the clothes of some of the dead men had been brought over\r\nand sent ashore. The quarantine in the Wear was far from effective: the\r\nstation was higher up the river than the loading moorings, so that\r\nsuspected ships had to pass through a crowd of ordinary shipping to get to\r\nit. It appears that hardly any ships were quarantined, except some from\r\nDutch ports where no cholera then existed.\r\n\r\nThis first experience of Asiatic cholera on British soil brought out very\r\nclearly one character of the infection which was seen to attend it\r\neverywhere during the following year, and has always attended it in every\r\nsubsequent invasion of the disease. The virus, for all its opportunities,\r\nshowed a marked preference for, an almost exclusive selection of the\r\nlowest and least cleanly localities, and a considerable preference for\r\npersons of drunken or negligent habits. Sunderland consisted of three\r\nparts--the parish so named, the parish of Bishop Wearmouth, which was the\r\nwest end of Sunderland or the residential quarter of the wealthier class,\r\nand across the river the parish of Monk Wearmouth, with the adjoining\r\nShore. The cholera was almost wholly confined to Sunderland proper;\r\nAinsworth says that no cases occurred, to his knowledge, in the parish of\r\nBishop Wearmouth, and not above six in Monk Wearmouth; another gave six or\r\neight cases in each of these parishes, but increased the estimate to\r\neighteen or twenty in each according to later information. Bishop\r\nWearmouth stood about seventy feet higher than the highest part of\r\nSunderland; it was well built, and its population of 14,462 (with 363 more\r\nin the Pans), included the whole of the wealthier class with the trades\r\ndependent on them. Monk Wearmouth, with a population of 1498, and the\r\nadjoining Shore with a population of 6051, were irregularly built on the\r\nnorth bank, and occupied by the same class (keelmen, sailors, labourers\r\nand workmen in the coal, iron and shipping trades) as Sunderland itself;\r\nbut for some reason, connected perhaps with its soil and elevation, it\r\nescaped with a very few cases of cholera[1488]. The parish of Sunderland,\r\nwith a population of 18,916, was not all visited equally. The focus of the\r\ncholera, says Ainsworth, was the town moor, a large piece of pasture-land\r\nstretching to the sea-shore at the south-east end of the town, having a\r\nsubsoil tenacious of water, marshy in the winter months, and its roads\r\nalmost impassable. Upon this open space was deposited, and left to\r\naccumulate for weeks together, the filth from the narrow lanes and\r\npassages of the low-lying and crowded quarter at the seaward end of the\r\nparish, to the south of the High Street. Some of the streets occupied by\r\nthe poorer class consisted of old residences of the well-to-do, now\r\ndivided into tenements. Certain streets had as many as a dozen or twenty\r\ncommon middens, “let in” to the street fronts of houses and covered by\r\ntrap-doors, in which the domestic refuse and sweepings of the street were\r\ncollected as a source of profit, and sold at stated times to farmers for\r\nmanure. Most of the attacks happened in this low-lying part of Sunderland,\r\nwith a soil and foundations sodden with filth, houses overcrowded and\r\nbadly ventilated, and its residents subject to the alternations of excess\r\nand want (with much pawning of clothes, &c.) peculiar to a port from which\r\none or two hundred sail would leave with a fair wind or arrive in the\r\nriver together[1489]. About four hundred were attacked in a population of\r\neighteen thousand during a space of two months. The cases among the\r\nwealthier classes were nearly all in the households of medical men:--the\r\nmother of one doctor, living with him, died of Asiatic cholera, the wife\r\nof another came safely through an attack, one or more medical men had the\r\nsymptoms in one degree or another. In the end of November, five old people\r\nin the poor’s house were fatally attacked all at once, in different parts\r\nof the building. A cholera hospital had been provided at an early stage of\r\nthe outbreak, but the relatives of those attacked seldom permitted their\r\nremoval to it, a prejudice against it having been aroused by the\r\npost-mortem examination of the first victims. Most of the cases were\r\naccordingly treated at their homes, which were “always crowded to excess\r\nby the immediate attendants or relatives, and by others from mere\r\ncuriosity.” A fund of two thousand pounds was raised for the distressed\r\nfamilies, to which the Government gave one hundred. Sunderland became for\r\ntwo or three weeks a centre of interest to medical men, who came to see\r\nthe cholera from various parts of England, Ireland and Scotland, while MM.\r\nMagendie and Guillot came from Paris, and M. Dubuc from Rouen.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms and morbid anatomy of cholera as it was known in India were\r\nseen without ambiguity in the Sunderland epidemic. In a few cases death\r\nfollowed very quickly without the distinctive intestinal symptoms; but\r\nusually the unmistakeable thing was a sudden seizure, often in the night\r\nafter a hearty supper, marked by profuse “meal-and-water” or\r\n“rice-and-water” purging, by vomiting, faintness or sinking at the pit of\r\nthe stomach, thirst, pulselessness, cramps of the limbs, restless tossing,\r\ncoldness, blueness and clamminess of the surface, and shrunken features.\r\nThe _facies Hippocratica_ had not been seen on so extensive a scale in\r\nEngland since the sweating sickness of three hundred years before. The\r\nend was sometimes in deep coma, at other times in delirium with convulsive\r\nor spasmodic movements. The chief point in the morbid anatomy was the\r\nengorgement of the lungs, great veins, and right side of the heart, from\r\nwhich the disease was named “cholera asphyxia.” The blood was thick and\r\ntarry[1490].\r\n\r\n\r\nExtension of Cholera to the Tyne, December, 1831.\r\n\r\nBefore Sunderland had been declared by the Board of Health to be free of\r\ncholera, on the 7th of January, 1832, the infection had gained a footing\r\nin Newcastle, Gateshead, North Shields, Houghton-le-Spring, and some\r\nplaces on the road to Edinburgh. The mildness of that winter was somewhat\r\nfavourable to its diffusion; in November there had been some days of\r\nsevere frost in the midst of generally mild weather, December was warmer\r\nthan usual, the pastures being green and spring-like, while January was\r\nwarm and dry almost beyond precedent. The first cases in new centres were\r\nusually tramps or others who had come from Sunderland[1491]; but there\r\nwere some puzzling attacks. Thus Dixon says that on 12th December, 1831,\r\nhe visited a woman of fifty who died of cholera after twelve hours, “in a\r\nlonely district unconnected in situation with any previously infected\r\nplace,” and where there had been no personal liability to contagion; a\r\nyoung man lodging in the house died three days after with the same\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\n    At Newcastle, as at Sunderland, fatal cases of choleraic disease were\r\n    discovered from the beginning of autumn; one such, on 4 August, at the\r\n    village of Team, two miles to the south-west of Newcastle, was said to\r\n    have been as little of the nature of bilious cholera, and as truly\r\n    spasmodic cholera, as those in the subsequent great epidemic. Another\r\n    suspicious death occurred a little below Newcastle on the 26th\r\n    October, the same day as the first acknowledged death from the Asiatic\r\n    disease in Sunderland. A month passed before the next death, marked by\r\n    spasmodic and non-bilious symptoms, occurred at Newcastle--on the 26th\r\n    November.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 7th of December, 1831, the Asiatic cholera was declared\r\nto be in the town. The earliest cases of it were found in low-lying poor\r\nhouses along the river[1492]. Gateshead, on the south bank of the Tyne,\r\nhad only two cases until a day or two before Christmas; at length, on\r\nChristmas-day, there was a sudden explosion of the infection\r\nsimultaneously at many points.\r\n\r\n    “On the 25th [December, 1831] about one o’clock,” wrote Brady[1493],\r\n    “we were assailed by a third and fourth example of the disease, and\r\n    before the next morning at ten o’clock, very considerable numbers had\r\n    fallen sacrifices to its pestilential ravages. Within a space of\r\n    twelve hours it spread itself over a diameter of two miles, and\r\n    appeared to pay but very little distinction to altitude of situation,\r\n    for the higher parts of the town were laid under its stroke in an\r\n    equal degree, or nearly so, with the lower. Pipewellgate, Hillgate,\r\n    the banks above Pipewellgate, Oakwellgate, the lanes leading from it,\r\n    Jackson’s chare, Nun’s Lane, Wreckington, Gateshead Low Fell, Low\r\n    Team--situations as different in their external character as can well\r\n    be conceived--were all indiscriminately exposed to its fury.”\r\n\r\nGreenhow’s summary of this remarkable explosion on the afternoon and night\r\nof Christmas-day is that “at nearly fifty different points cases occurred\r\nalmost at the same instant.” The attack at Gateshead was short and severe;\r\nat Newcastle it was less concentrated and of longer duration, affecting\r\nthe population in the low and dissolute localities along the river, such\r\nas Sandgate and the Close, while there were two or three fatalities about\r\nthe 6th January among the wealthier residents. The hospital cases in\r\nNewcastle and Gateshead to the 9th of February were:\r\n\r\n                                Cases      Deaths\r\n\r\n  Sandgate Hospital               55         23\r\n  Castle Hospital                 12          8\r\n  St John’s and St Andrew’s       15          8\r\n  Gateshead Hospital              36         21\r\n                                 ---         --\r\n                                 118         60\r\n\r\nAs at Sunderland, the bulk of the cases were treated at their homes--1330\r\ncases, with 437 deaths, to the 9th of February. As the whole number of\r\ndeaths at Newcastle and Gateshead, while the cholera of 1832 lasted, was\r\n801 in the returns to the Board of Health, it would appear that the\r\nepidemic had dragged on through the spring and perhaps the summer, which\r\nwere its seasons elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe colliers’ villages on both sides of the Tyne for two or three miles\r\nabove and below Newcastle and Gateshead were sharply visited at the same\r\ntime. Below Newcastle, on the north bank, it invaded Dent’s Hole, a dirty\r\nnarrow lane along the margin of the river, overhung by its banks, filled\r\nwith mud and filth rising in heaps above the thresholds of the houses;\r\nalso on the same side, Walker, Howden-Pans, and so on to North Shields; on\r\nthe south side below Gateshead it visited Felling and other villages.\r\nSouth Shields and Westoe escaped for several weeks, but at length about\r\nthe 20th of February the epidemic began there and caused 147 deaths before\r\nit ceased.\r\n\r\nSome of the worst village outbreaks occurred above Newcastle on both sides\r\nof the river. Swalwel, a low dirty village of iron-workers, near the\r\nconfluence of the Derwent with the Tyne had a very virulent attack.\r\nDunston, another low-lying village on the south bank, two miles above\r\nGateshead, subject to inundation from the small tributary stream running\r\nthrough it, had twenty-three deaths among the 400 inhabitants in about a\r\nfortnight, most of the victims being old, dissipated and debilitated. On\r\nthe other hand, Whickam Fell, standing on the hill between Dunston and\r\nSwalwel, escaped with only one case, while Bensham, another elevated\r\nvillage between Gateshead and Dunston, escaped altogether; just as Byker,\r\na high-lying village on the north bank, only half a mile from Dent’s Hole,\r\nhad but a single mild case.\r\n\r\nOn the north bank above Newcastle the disease was most severe in the\r\nvillages of Bell’s Close, Lemington and Newburn. The epidemic in the last\r\nof these was indeed unparalleled. As in all the other villages attacked,\r\nthe epidemic was soon over, but not before two-thirds of the inhabitants\r\nhad suffered either from choleraic diarrhoea or cholera proper. Newburn\r\nwas a village of some 131 houses, built in the face of the high north bank\r\nof the river five miles above Newcastle, its population being 550. The\r\nhouses stood in two rows, one above the other, the church and churchyard\r\nstanding in open ground midway between the lower and upper streets of the\r\nvillage; a small stream ran through it to the Tyne. The inhabitants were\r\nmostly wherrymen, coal labourers, or glassworkers; they were a healthy\r\ncommunity, above indigence, housed in clean, neat, comfortably furnished\r\nclay-floored cottages. The first case of cholera, in a man who lived close\r\nto the brook, proved fatal on the 4th of January, 1832. There was no new\r\ncase until the 10th, after which there were several deaths every day. From\r\nthe night of the 15th until noon of the 16th fifty were attacked, twelve\r\nor thirteen of them with the worst kind of spasmodic cholera, the rest\r\nwith diarrhoea. By the 2nd of February the epidemic was over. Three\r\nhundred and twenty had either cholera or cholerine, of whom fifty-seven\r\ndied (the Board of Health return gives 274 cases and 65 deaths to 25\r\nJanuary), the daily deaths having been as follows[1494]:\r\n\r\n_Cholera in Newburn, near Newcastle, 1832._\r\n\r\n                 Deaths\r\n\r\n  Jan. 4           1\r\n      11           4\r\n      12           3\r\n      13           4\r\n      14           6\r\n      15           5\r\n      16           6\r\n      17           3\r\n      18           5\r\n      19           3\r\n      20           3\r\n      21           2\r\n      22           3\r\n      23           2\r\n      24           2\r\n      25           1\r\n      26           2\r\n      27           1\r\n      28}\r\n      29}          1\r\n\r\nThe other chief centres of cholera in the northern coal district, besides\r\nthose mentioned, were Houghton-le-Spring and Hetton (which had together\r\n311 cases and 66 deaths to the 28 of January), the colliery village of\r\nEarsden, and the port of Tynemouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cholera of 1832 in Scotland.\r\n\r\nIt was not until April that the infection began to show itself on the same\r\nscale in other parts of England. The next parts of the kingdom to be\r\ninvaded after the Wear and the Tyne were the coal and iron districts of\r\nEast Lothian and Lanarkshire, the cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow becoming\r\ninfected soon after. A fatal case, in a destitute tramping sailor occurred\r\nat Doncaster, in the beginning of January, but led to no outbreak; two\r\nfatal cases occurred at Morpeth about the same time, the second of the two\r\nin a bagman who had just spent three days making his rounds in Newcastle\r\nand the infected villages near it. It was on the high road to Edinburgh,\r\nat Haddington, Tranent and Musselburgh, that the next focus of cholera was\r\nestablished. Previous to the 14th of January there had been 47 cases, with\r\n18 deaths, in and near Haddington, among the miners and others of the\r\nlabouring class. At Tranent, seven miles nearer Edinburgh on the main\r\nroad, with a population of 1700 miners and labourers, a boy died of\r\ncholera on the 18th January, the infection spreading so rapidly that\r\nbefore the 25th there had been 61 attacks with 26 deaths, which rose to\r\n205 attacks and 60 deaths by the 8th of February. A few cases occurred\r\nalso at North Berwick and a good many at Preston Pans; while Musselburgh\r\nbecame the scene of one of the most deadly outbreaks in the whole history.\r\n\r\nMusselburgh, with Fisherrow, was not then the place of villas which it\r\nafterwards became, but was occupied by a working class, who combined the\r\nthree industries of coal-mining, weaving or other factory work, and\r\nfishing. To add to the ordinary insanitary risks of such a combination,\r\nsome fifteen hundred hands had been out of work for two months, and were\r\nin “a state of great misery.” The first case of cholera appeared there on\r\nWednesday, the 18th January, three days after the first death at Tranent.\r\nThe virulence and certainty of the infection will appear from the\r\nfollowing by D. M. Moir, the distinguished author of _Mansie Waugh_ and\r\nother writings in prose or verse, who practised his profession at\r\nMusselburgh:\r\n\r\n    “A girl at Musselburgh, whose mother kept a lodging-house, was found\r\n    in a state of complete collapse on the morning of Thursday, the 19th\r\n    January--the day after the first appearance of the pestilence. She\r\n    died on that afternoon, between five and six, and was buried by\r\n    moonlight the same evening.... The mother during the night of Saturday\r\n    was also similarly seized, and fell a victim on the following noon.\r\n    Her sister, who had walked from Leith on the same morning to condole\r\n    with her in her family distress, was immediately affected on entering\r\n    the house; but her symptoms being overlooked in the misery around her,\r\n    medical assistance was not called in, until, on the return of the\r\n    nieces from the interment, their aunt was discovered dead on the floor\r\n    of the dwelling. Her husband, Baxter, a man of intemperate habits,\r\n    came out to enquire into her fate; and immediately on his return home\r\n    to Leith was seized with the distemper and died.”\r\n\r\nIn three weeks there were more deaths from cholera than from all causes in\r\nthe whole of an ordinary year. To the 22nd of February, just over a month\r\nfrom its outbreak, the disease had attacked 435, of whom 193 died. The\r\nmedical profession (the senior of whom was a man of original talent,\r\nThomas Brown, author of an essay on smallpox, in 1808, and one on the\r\nIndian cholera in 1824), were greatly taxed by the numerous calls upon\r\nthem: Moir met one night a young colleague who complained of feeling ill,\r\nand was advised by the former to go home at once; he continued his rounds\r\nfor an hour longer, and died of cholera next morning. Edinburgh, only five\r\nmiles distant, was in constant communication with Musselburgh; and at\r\nlength three or four cases appeared in the city in persons who had been at\r\nthe infected place. The Edinburgh cases, however, did not multiply\r\nrapidly; to the 8th of February, there had been 8 cases with four deaths;\r\nto the 28th of February, 35 cases, with 18 deaths; to the 20th of March,\r\n39 cases, with 20 deaths. On the other hand, the suburb of Water of Leith,\r\nhad 48 cases, with 23 deaths at the same date. On the 6th April, 1832, the\r\nfigures for Edinburgh and certain of its suburbs respectively were:\r\n\r\n                      Cases         Deaths\r\n\r\n  Portobello           44             24\r\n  Water of Leith       58             30\r\n  Canonmills           18             12\r\n  Duddingston          10              3\r\n  Edinburgh            62             38\r\n\r\nOf the border towns, Hawick was infected on the 14th January, probably\r\nfrom Morpeth, and had a not very extensive epidemic, of somewhat mild\r\ntype[1495]. Coldstream, on the Tweed, a few miles above Berwick, had 109\r\ncases and 37 deaths to the 20th of March.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the infection had sought out the weak spots in the west of\r\nScotland--the mining and weaving villages in Lanarkshire, the city of\r\nGlasgow and the manufacturing town of Paisley. On Sunday, the 22nd\r\nJanuary, a boy was taken ill in church at Kirkintilloch (a village on the\r\nForth and Clyde canal, seven miles north-east of Glasgow), and died next\r\nmorning: that was the first case in the west of Scotland. Cases multiplied\r\nin Kirkintilloch, so that by the 6th of March there had been thirty-two\r\ndeaths, but no more for the rest of the season. A few days after the boy\r\nwas seized in church there, a first case occurred in the mining village of\r\nCoatbridge, six or seven miles to the south-east, in an old man living in\r\na “back land” in very poor circumstances, who had not been in\r\nKirkintilloch nor had communication with such as had been there; other\r\ncases followed slowly, and at length there was a more severe outbreak.\r\n\r\nGlasgow at once took precautions. A Board of Health had been formed there\r\nearly in the summer of 1831. In February, it had command of £8000 raised\r\nby voluntary subscriptions, and it made provision of 236 cholera beds in\r\nfive hospitals. The theatres were closed, and “evening sermons”\r\ndiscouraged; while all the passenger boats (for a time also the goods\r\nbarges) on the Forth and Clyde canal, and on the Monkland canal (near to\r\nwhich was Coatbridge) were stopped. District committees were formed in all\r\nparts of the city.\r\n\r\n    The first victim was Janet Lindsay, a drunken old woman who lodged\r\n    with widow Proudfoot and her daughter in Todd’s Close, Goosedubs; she\r\n    was asthmatic, and had not been beyond the Goosedubs for weeks. Her\r\n    seizure, with vomiting and purging, was on the afternoon of Thursday,\r\n    9th February, and her death on Saturday morning. Also on the 9th\r\n    February, in the suburb of Woodside, remote from Goosedubs, the infant\r\n    of one McGie was attacked with cholera, suffered much from cramps on\r\n    the 10th and died on the 11th, the father, mother and others of the\r\n    family afterwards suffering from cholera. The third case, fatal in a\r\n    few hours, appeared early in the morning of Friday the 10th in a boy\r\n    living in Millroad Street, a mile east of the Goosedubs, who had been\r\n    subject to diarrhoea for some weeks. The fourth victim was a gardener\r\n    in Macalpine Street, a locality also remote from the Goosedubs and in\r\n    the opposite direction from Millroad Street, who had walked three\r\n    miles to Pollokshaws on the 9th, and had partaken of tea with friends\r\n    at Crossmyloof on his way back, in excellent health: he was seized at\r\n    midnight with purging, and died on the afternoon of the second day.\r\n    The fifth case was in Partick on the 11th, the sixth in Bridgegate on\r\n    the 12th, not far from the close in the Goosedubs where the first case\r\n    had occurred. On the 17th the first of many cases occurred in Paisley,\r\n    and on the same day there was a case at Maryhill (population of some\r\n    500), followed by six more before the next afternoon. Thus there were,\r\n    besides the case of cholera in the very heart of old Glasgow,\r\n    half-a-dozen other cases the same day or in the next day or two, at\r\n    scattered points all round the city. About fifty of the neighbours had\r\n    visited Janet Lindsay in Todd’s Close, and some had helped to lay her\r\n    out. The next case in the close was of a woman who had stopped in the\r\n    street to talk with the widow Proudfoot shortly after the body had\r\n    been removed; this woman was seized at seven next morning (Sunday, the\r\n    12th Feb.), and died in the hospital after twenty-four hours. Three\r\n    days passed, and then there occurred two other cases, both fatal, in\r\n    Todd’s Close, one of them being the widow Proudfoot herself, who\r\n    refused to be taken to the hospital, and would receive no other\r\n    medicine or cordial but whisky. No other cases occurred in the close\r\n    for several weeks; but within a range of two hundred yards of it there\r\n    were 46 cases from the 13th to the 29th of February. It was, indeed to\r\n    this region of Glasgow, the Goosedubs and the Wynds, that the\r\n    infection was chiefly confined for the first few weeks; it was\r\n    especially severe in Francis’s Close, Broomielaw, a collection of\r\n    small wretched hovels, in which some twenty died of cholera[1496]. The\r\n    state of the three old Wynds of Glasgow and of other the like\r\n    localities has been already referred to under a date a year or two\r\n    before the outbreak of cholera (supra p. 598).\r\n\r\nNo better instance could be given of the inscrutable ways in which the\r\ninfection of cholera found out the weak places and the likely subjects\r\nthan the explosion in the Glasgow Town’s Hospital or pauper infirmary on\r\nthe 22nd of February, some twelve days after the first cases in various\r\nparts of the city and suburbs.\r\n\r\n    The infirmary, built in two blocks on the north bank of the Clyde,\r\n    contained 395 inmates occupying 296 beds, some 60 or 70 of whom were\r\n    insane or fatuous. The fatuous lived in ground-floor cells of the\r\n    north block, from seven to eleven feet square, with a stone vaulted\r\n    roof, a stone floor, no fireplace, damp from situation and want of\r\n    sun, but all the more damp from being often washed owing to the\r\n    uncleanly habits of the inmates. At eight on the morning of the 22nd\r\n    February two fatuous paupers in adjoining cells were found cold and\r\n    pulseless; they had vomited and purged during the night, although they\r\n    had been well the evening before; each of the two cells had three beds\r\n    with five occupants. One of the two seized died next day, the other\r\n    recovered in a week, having had severe spasms and a degree of\r\n    collapse. Cases appeared almost at the same time in various parts of\r\n    the building, most of them in scattered individuals, but in one\r\n    instance in as many as five together in a garret holding twenty-two.\r\n    From the 22nd February to the 9th of March there were 64 attacks of\r\n    cholera in this pauper institution[1497]. Besides the five deaths in\r\n    the Sunderland Workhouse, this was the first of many instances of the\r\n    remarkable invasion of such institutions.\r\n\r\nUntil July the infection had been limited in Glasgow to certain of the\r\nlowest localities, and even in these it had declined almost to extinction\r\nin the last week of May. As the summer advanced it increased somewhat\r\nagain, and in the first days of August it took a sudden start, reaching a\r\nmaximum of 181 attacks in one day, and 817 in a week. It was no longer\r\nconfined to the poorest districts, but became diffused all over Glasgow,\r\nso that “there was scarcely a street where one or more cases did not\r\noccur.” From this enormous prevalence in August, it declined again in\r\nSeptember, but once more took a start in the last few days of that month\r\nand in the first week or two of October. The last outburst was ascribed to\r\nthe effects of the Glasgow public holiday on 28 September, to celebrate\r\nthe passing of the Reform Bill for Scotland, but the course of the\r\nepidemic clearly followed the season, being precisely parallel in\r\nEdinburgh, in Dumfries and in the coast towns of Fife. From the middle of\r\nOctober, the disease declined rapidly and was extinct before the middle of\r\nNovember. The following table shows week by week the number of new cases\r\nreported daily to the Board of Health, and the deaths in each week[1498].\r\n\r\n_Cholera in Glasgow, 1832 (population 202,426)._\r\n\r\n  Week         New\r\n  ending      cases    Deaths\r\n\r\n  Feb.  19      62       21\r\n        26     113       46\r\n  Mar.   4      68       39\r\n        11      85       60\r\n        18      94       50\r\n        25     150       61\r\n  April  1     138       74\r\n         8     112       57\r\n        15      99       50\r\n        22     120       60\r\n        29      71       40\r\n  May    6      71       39\r\n        13      73       39\r\n        20      41       31\r\n        27      21       11\r\n  June   3       6        7\r\n        10      45       17\r\n        17      72       39\r\n        24     168       70\r\n  July   1     127       72\r\n         8     131       62\r\n        15     143       68\r\n        22     229      101\r\n        29     218      113\r\n  Aug.   5     817      356\r\n        12     699      339\r\n  Aug.  19     483      228\r\n        26     419      178\r\n  Sept.  2     231      122\r\n         9     117       50\r\n        16      60       31\r\n        23      84       33\r\n        30     165       90\r\n  Oct.   7     310      140\r\n        14     173       95\r\n        21      95       58\r\n        28      47       29\r\n  Nov.   4      41       18\r\n        11      10       11\r\n              ----     ----\r\n    Total     6208     3005\r\n\r\nThe effect of the epidemic upon the general mortality of Glasgow is shown\r\nin the table of deaths from all causes and from cholera month by month,\r\ncompiled from the burial registers, which make the cholera deaths 161 more\r\nthan the returns to the Board of Health.\r\n\r\n_Glasgow Mortality in 1832._\r\n\r\n            All       Cholera\r\n          deaths      deaths\r\n\r\n  Jan.      824         --\r\n  Feb.      874         87\r\n  March     955        264\r\n  April     816        229\r\n  May       677        125\r\n  June      783        196\r\n  July      990        441\r\n  Aug.     1755       1222\r\n  Sept.     749        243\r\n  Oct.      755        334\r\n  Nov.      529         25\r\n  Dec.      571         --\r\n         ------       ----\r\n         10,278       3166\r\n\r\nWhile the cholera lasted (12 Feb.-11 Nov.) the burials from all other or\r\nordinary causes were 4958; in the corresponding nine months of 1831 they\r\nwere 4862, having been excessive in that year owing to fever. The baptisms\r\nfrom 15 December, 1831, to 14 December, 1832, were 3388; so that the\r\ncholera alone destroyed nearly as many lives, chiefly adult, as there were\r\nchildren born in the year.\r\n\r\nUpwards of a thousand of the cases were treated at the Albion Street\r\nHospital, under the direction of Dr Lawrie, who had had a large experience\r\nof cholera in India. His statistics are as follows[1499]:\r\n\r\n_Albion Street Cholera Hospital, Glasgow, Feb.-Sept. 1832._\r\n\r\n     Males            Females        Both sexes     Percentages\r\n  Cases  Deaths    Cases  Deaths    Cases  Deaths    of deaths\r\n\r\n   370    251       662    419      1032    670        64·9\r\n\r\n                               Percentages\r\n  Ages      Cases    Deaths     of deaths\r\n\r\n  0-7         43        25         58·1\r\n  7-20        93        47         50·5\r\n  20-30      231       112         48·8\r\n  30-40      211       137         64·9\r\n  40-50      204       136         66·1\r\n  50-60      116        95         81·0\r\n  Over 60    134       120         89·5\r\n\r\n_Monthly Cases and Deaths._\r\n\r\n                             Percentages\r\n           Cases    Deaths    of deaths\r\n\r\n  Feb.      40        33         82·5\r\n  March     97        69         71·1\r\n  April    122        81         66·3\r\n  May       56        40         71·4\r\n  June     126        94         74·5\r\n  July     240       143         59·5\r\n  Aug.     273       176         64·4\r\n  Sept.     64        33         51·5\r\n\r\nThe noteworthy points are: first, the great excess of women admitted,\r\nwhich was observed also at Edinburgh; secondly, the higher rate of\r\nfatality at the two extremes of life, which is the rule in some other\r\ninfections; and thirdly, the lower ratio of deaths to cases during the\r\nheight of the epidemic in the end of summer, which is explained, as\r\nCraigie remarked for Edinburgh, simply by the fact that the infection was\r\nno longer in the worst localities, but was attacking “a greater number of\r\npersons, and consequently much better constitutions.”\r\n\r\nThe Glasgow cholera of 1832 was far more destructive than that of\r\nEdinburgh per head of the population, according to the following:\r\n\r\n                        Glasgow           Edinburgh\r\n\r\n  Population            202,426            136,301\r\n  Attacks of Cholera       6208              1886\r\n  Deaths by Cholera        3005              1065\r\n\r\nThe fluctuations of the epidemic in the two cities were closely parallel.\r\nIn Edinburgh from the middle of February to the middle of June the new\r\ncases usually ranged from five to ten or fifteen a day, with an occasional\r\nexcess, as on the 29th of April when there were twenty-six persons seized.\r\nAs in Glasgow, there was a marked lull in the end of May and beginning of\r\nJune, after which the seizures became more common and remained somewhat\r\nsteady to the end of July, some days having as many as twenty attacks. The\r\nlargest number in one day in August was nineteen, the September maximum\r\nsixteen (on the 28th). Edinburgh thus missed the enormous outburst that\r\nGlasgow had in August, while the September experiences were much the same\r\nin the two cities. The first week of October, which was the time of a\r\nsecond maximum in Glasgow (far below that of August), was the worst time\r\nof the whole epidemic in Edinburgh, the cases coming from all parts of the\r\ncity, as in Glasgow they had done in August.\r\n\r\n_Successive days of most extensive Cholera in Edinburgh, 1832._\r\n\r\n         New cases\r\n\r\n  Oct. 1    22\r\n       2    23\r\n       3    44\r\n       4    45\r\n       5    23\r\n       6    30\r\n       7    27\r\n       8    18\r\n       9    13\r\n      10    26\r\n\r\nThis gives 214 cases in the week ending 7th October, as compared with\r\nGlasgow’s 310 in the same week.\r\n\r\nAt the Castle Hill Cholera Hospital, 318 were admitted and 187 died. The\r\nages, with the rates of fatality at each age-period, agree closely with\r\nthose already given for the chief hospital in Glasgow. The smaller ratio\r\nof hospital fatality in the second half of the epidemic was perhaps more\r\nmarked in Edinburgh: 119 cases, with 85 deaths, from the opening of the\r\nhospital to 5 July; 199 cases, with 97 deaths, from 5 July to the closing\r\nof the hospital. That larger proportion of recoveries may have been due in\r\npart, Craigie thinks, to better methods of treatment; but, in his opinion,\r\nit was mainly owing to the greater number of strong constitutions among\r\nthose attacked over a wider area of the city.\r\n\r\nBeyond the statistics and other particulars for Glasgow and Edinburgh, and\r\nthe minute accounts of the first outbreaks in the beginning of the year,\r\nthere is little exactly recorded of the cholera of 1832 in the rest of\r\nScotland; but the following table, compiled according to counties from the\r\nalphabetical list of the London Board of Health, will serve to show the\r\nepidemic in outline.\r\n\r\n_Deaths by Asiatic Cholera in Scotland, 1832._\r\n\r\n                             No. of\r\n                             places      Places with highest mortalities\r\n    Counties         Deaths attacked             in each county\r\n\r\n  Caithness             96    iii    Wick 69, Thurso 26, Latheron 1\r\n  Sutherland            --     --\r\n  Ross and Cromarty    102    vii    Tain 55, Dingwall 17, Avoch 12,\r\n                                         Cromarty 11, Several villages no\r\n                                         return\r\n  Inverness-shire      191    iii    Inverness 177\r\n  Nairnshire             5      i    Nairn 5\r\n  Moray                 --     --\r\n  Banffshire            15      i    Rathven (Buckie) 15\r\n  Aberdeenshire        108     ii    Aberdeen and Footdee 99, Collieston 9\r\n  Kincardine            --     --\r\n  Forfarshire          552     iv    Dundee 512, Cupar Angus 17, Arbroath\r\n                                         13, Liff and Benvie 10\r\n  Perthshire            81      v    Perth 66, Auchterarder 7, Kenmore 4,\r\n                                         Tulliallan 3\r\n  Fife and Kinross     301    xii    Cupar and district 108, Kirkaldy and\r\n                                         Dunnikier 104, Dysart 39, Wester\r\n                                         Wemyss 17, Kinghorn 15,\r\n                                         Burntisland 13, Anstruther 10,\r\n                                         Leven 14, St Andrews 5\r\n  East Lothian         213    vii    Tranent 78, Haddington 65, Dunbar\r\n                                         etc. 38, Prestonpans 28\r\n  Berwickshire           41          Coldstream 41\r\n  Midlothian           1780  xiii    Edinburgh 1065, Suburbs of, 146,\r\n                                         Leith 267, Musselburgh and\r\n                                         Fisherrow 202, Newhaven 52,\r\n                                         Portobello 33\r\n  Linlithgowshire        --    --\r\n  Clackmannanshire       75     i    Clackmannan 75\r\n  Stirlingshire         247     x    Alloa 72, Stirling 35, Falkirk 36,\r\n                                         Larbert 31, Balfron 28, St\r\n                                         Ninian’s 15, Bothkenner 10,\r\n                                         Carriden 13, Grangemouth 8\r\n  Lanarkshire          3575   xii    Glasgow 3005, Pollokshaws 143, Govan\r\n                                         77, Old Monkland 125, Rutherglen\r\n                                         65\r\n  Renfrewshire         1001    xi    Paisley 444, Greenock 436, Port\r\n                                         Glasgow 69\r\n  Dumbartonshire         86   iii    Dumbarton 67, Bonhill 13, Helensburgh\r\n                                         6\r\n  Bute                   14     i    Rothesay 14\r\n  Argyle                 35    ii    Inverary 25, Campbelltown 10\r\n  Ayrshire              466     x    Kilmarnock 205, Ayr 190, Dairy 22,\r\n                                        Irvine 19\r\n  Kirkcudbrightshire    133    iv    Troqueer (Maxwelltown) 125,\r\n                                         Kirkcudbright 3\r\n  Dumfriesshire         441     v    Dumfries 418, Caerlaverock 15\r\n  Roxburghshire          34     i    Hawick 34 (second outbreak only).\r\n\r\nNear Glasgow numerous centres of cholera were established, among which\r\nPaisley, Greenock and Dumbarton suffered heavily during the same space as\r\nGlasgow, from February to November. Rothesay, Campbelltown and Inverary\r\nhad epidemics in spring or early summer. In June and July the infection\r\nwas carried effectually into Ayrshire (an earlier importation to Doura,\r\nnear Kilwinning, in March, having proved abortive) and caused great\r\nmortalities at Kilmarnock[1500] and Ayr[1501], as well as much alarm and a\r\ngood many deaths at Dalry, Irvine and Loudoun. In the latter half of\r\nSeptember a most disastrous outbreak began in Dumfries and in the\r\nneighbouring Maxwelltown[1502].\r\n\r\nThe epidemic in Leith and Newhaven proceeded at the same time as in\r\nEdinburgh. Another important centre was the midland coal-field of\r\nStirlingshire and Lanarkshire, where the mortality was mostly autumnal.\r\nPerth had been reached early in March, Dundee at the end of April, the\r\nlatter having a visitation on the same scale as Glasgow, Edinburgh,\r\nPaisley and Greenock. From Dundee, Cupar Fife was infected about the\r\nmiddle of August, and had a severe epidemic almost confined to\r\npaupers[1503]. In the autumn there was much cholera among the fishing\r\npopulation from Thurso to Dunbar and Berwick. Inverness had been infected\r\nearly in May, and was probably the centre from which the disease spread in\r\nthe end of summer, during the herring fishery, to the coast towns and\r\nfishing villages, as well as to Tain and Dingwall. Only a few of these\r\nplaces made returns to the Board of Health; but it is probable from what\r\nHugh Miller relates of the villages near Cromarty that the disease had\r\nbeen more widely spread. That author has described the condition of things\r\nin his native town. Its landlocked bay had been made a quarantine station,\r\nand was full of shipping flying the yellow flag. Cholera had “more than\r\ndecimated” the villages of Portmahomak and Inver, and was prevalent in the\r\nparishes of Nigg and Urquhart, with the towns of Inverness, Nairn, Avoch,\r\nDingwall and Rosemarkie. The numerous dead at Inver were buried in the\r\nsand, infected cottages had been burned down, the infected hamlets of\r\nHilton and Balintore had been shut off from the neighbouring country by a\r\ncordon[1504]. The citizens of Cromarty, hitherto untouched, followed the\r\nadvice of Miller at a public meeting and took the law into their own\r\nhands, guarding all the approaches to their peninsula and subjecting all\r\narrivals to fumigation with sulphur and to some undescribed application of\r\nchloride of lime. The infection, however, got in by an unguarded channel.\r\nA Cromarty fisherman had died of cholera at Wick; his clothes had been\r\nordered to be burned, but a brother of the dead man, who was in Wick at\r\nthe time, secured some of them and brought them home. He kept them in his\r\nchest for a month before he ventured to open it. Next day he was seized\r\nwith cholera and died in two days. Thereafter the disease crept about the\r\nstreets and lanes for weeks, striking down both the hale and the worn-out.\r\nPitch and tar were kept burning during the night at the openings of the\r\ninfected lanes; the clothes of the dead were burned; many of the fishers\r\nleft their cottages and lived in the caves on the hill until the danger\r\nwas past[1505].\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous fishing villages of the Moray Firth, Buckie is the only\r\none given as severely touched by the infection (fifteen deaths). Only one\r\nsmall village of the Aberdeenshire coast, Collieston, is known to have had\r\ncholera (nine deaths)[1506]. The Aberdeen epidemic was not severe, and\r\nappears to have been mostly in the fishers’ quarter. The Montrose district\r\nescaped altogether in 1832; but in June, 1833, the true Asiatic cholera\r\nbroke out in the fishing villages of Ferryden and Boddin, on the opposite\r\nshore of the South Esk from Montrose. Arbroath had a few deaths in August,\r\n1832, while several of the small towns on the coast of Fife had from that\r\ntime to the end of the year visitations which were only less alarming than\r\nthose on the south side of the Firth of Forth at the beginning of the\r\nyear. To sum up the epidemic in Scotland, it caused nearly ten thousand\r\ndeaths, of which Glasgow and its suburbs had about one-third, Edinburgh,\r\nLeith, Dundee, Greenock, Paisley and Dumfries, another third, while a\r\nlarge part of the remainder occurred among the mining and fishing\r\npopulations[1507].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cholera of 1832 in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe forecast of Orton in the summer of 1831, that Ireland would be the\r\nchosen soil of the Asiatic pestilence owing to the state of misery, at\r\nthat time, of the mass of its people, was realized in a measure. But the\r\ncholera in Ireland, as elsewhere in Europe, showed itself chiefly as an\r\nurban disease, falling disastrously upon the poorest quarters of Dublin,\r\nLimerick, Cork, Galway, Sligo, Drogheda and other towns, but by no means\r\nseriously upon the immense population who occupied the country cabins.\r\nScotland, indeed, had a higher ratio of cholera deaths than Ireland per\r\nhead of the population; whereas Dublin had nearly twice as many deaths as\r\nGlasgow, their populations being almost exactly equal (about 200,000), and\r\nCork had nearly the same number as Liverpool. The following table gives\r\nthe comparison of the three divisions of the United Kingdom, including the\r\ncholera deaths of 1831 in England, but not those of 1833, which were more\r\nnumerous in Ireland than elsewhere.\r\n\r\n                     Population in 1831   Cholera deaths\r\n\r\n  England and Wales        13,897,187        21,882\r\n  Ireland                   7,784,539        20,070\r\n  Scotland                  2,365,114          9592\r\n\r\nThe first undoubted case of Asiatic cholera was found in Dublin on 22\r\nMarch, 1832. On the 25th of that month, Harty, who was physician to all\r\nthe Dublin prisons, notified to the Board of Health cases in the Richmond\r\nBridewell which he believed to be true spasmodic or malignant\r\ncholera[1508]. It was reported from Cork on the 12th of April, from\r\nBelfast on the 14th, Tralee on the 28th, Galway on the 12th of May,\r\nLimerick on the 14th, Tuam the 4th of June, Waterford the 1st of July, but\r\nnot until 21 August from Wexford and about the same time from Londonderry.\r\nDoubtless remoteness from the ordinary routes of vagrants was the reason\r\nwhy the infection was later in some places, such as Wexford. The old\r\nLiberties of Dublin, which harboured crowds of beggars in dilapidated\r\ntenement-houses, became a focus of virulent infection. As the summer\r\nadvanced whole families in some of the most wretched lanes were cut off;\r\nnews from Dublin on 29 June says that the pestilence was worst in Sycamore\r\nAlley, in a single house of which twenty persons had died in the course\r\nof four or five days[1509]. Certain streets sent fifty patients to the\r\nCholera Hospital for one sent by other streets that were seemingly no\r\nbetter off[1510]. The great hospital in Grange Gorman Lane, capable of\r\nholding 700 and sometimes occupied by 500, would on some nights or early\r\nmornings (from midnight to 7 a.m.) receive forty or fifty new cases, and\r\nwithin a week would be having at the same hours only two applications.\r\nDuring four successive days it admitted a total of 285 cases, during the\r\nnext four days 497 cases, and during four days a fortnight later only 134\r\ncases. The worst time was from the 10th to the 14th of July, when 615 were\r\nadmitted. A day or two of rain seemed always to send up the number of\r\ncases carried to the hospital[1511]. Until the beginning of June hardly\r\nanyone under fifteen was attacked; but in July the attacks of children\r\nwere about one in thirteen or fourteen of adults, a case of pure cholera\r\nhaving been observed in an infant three weeks old. As at Glasgow and\r\nEdinburgh, more women than men were taken to the hospital (138·17 females\r\nto 100 males)[1512].\r\n\r\nAs the infection spread in Dublin during the early summer a panic arose in\r\nthe city, and alarm over the whole province of Leinster. Runners, as in\r\nthe old times of the torch of war, were to be seen hurrying everywhere\r\nthrough the neighbouring counties carrying a smouldering peat, of which\r\nthey left a small portion at every cabin in their direct line, with a\r\nsacred obligation upon the inmates to carry the charm to seven other\r\nhouses, and the following exhortation: “The plague has broken out; take\r\nthis, and while it burns offer up seven paters, three aves, and a credo in\r\nthe name of God and the holy St John that the plague may be stopped”! Men,\r\nwomen and children scoured the country with the charmed turf in every\r\ndirection, “each endeavouring to be foremost in finding unserved houses.”\r\nOne man in the Bog of Allen had to run thirty miles before he had\r\ndischarged the obligation laid upon him[1513]. It does not appear,\r\nhowever, that the infection was at all general among the scattered\r\ncabins, hamlets or even considerable villages. In the rural parts of\r\nWicklow there were only eight deaths from it, in Fermanagh four, in county\r\nDerry three, in Armagh thirteen, in Carlow none until the next year. In\r\nClare the deaths in country districts were more than twice as many as in\r\nEnnis and other towns of the county. In Sligo county, again, there were\r\nonly 62 deaths among the peasantry to 698 in the towns, nearly the whole\r\nof the latter total belonging to the county town and seaport. The epidemic\r\nin Sligo town was one of the worst in Ireland. It was reported that forty\r\nor fifty were buried in one day in a trench, one-half of them without\r\ncoffins but wrapped in tarred sailcloth. It is said, also, that seven of\r\nthe medical men died of cholera in the course of three months[1514].\r\nThousands of the population, which numbered about 14,000, fled from the\r\ntown, the wealthier paying large sums for a room or two in a country\r\ncottage, the poorer living in tents or sleeping under the hedges. In\r\nAugust the guard of the mail coach which ran from Sligo by way of Strabane\r\nto Londonderry was taken with cholera on the road and died at the latter\r\ntown, no case having occurred in Londonderry up to that time[1515].\r\n\r\nThe outbreak at Drogheda was as sudden and disastrous as at Sligo. At\r\nBelfast also the disease began with enormous fatality, but, according to\r\nthe table, the deaths eventually were few in proportion to the attacks.\r\nThe other towns which had highest mortalities were Cork, Limerick, Galway\r\nand Kilkenny--all seaports except the last. In Waterford the great\r\noutbreak was delayed until 1833.\r\n\r\nMany of the counties had more deaths among the peasantry in 1833 than in\r\n1832, Limerick county in particular. The following instance is related of\r\na small hamlet about a mile to the south-east of Armagh:\r\n\r\n    The hamlet consisted of five or six dwellings on both sides of the\r\n    road. On the 19th July, 1833, a man in delicate health, who had\r\n    received a jar of sea-water two days before, and had drunk three or\r\n    four pints of it, was seized with cramps, and blueness and collapse,\r\n    after the purging induced by the sea-water; he died on the 20th and\r\n    was buried on the 21st. His brother, who lived next door under the\r\n    same roof, was seized with cholera on the evening of the 21st, having\r\n    attended the funeral, and died comatose after five or six days’\r\n    illness. A man who lived across the road, and had also been at the\r\n    funeral of No. 1, was seized with cholera the same evening (21st), and\r\n    died in forty-eight hours. On the night of his burial his son aged\r\n    thirteen and a married daughter who lived in the house were seized,\r\n    the boy dying the same night “very black,” and the daughter after a\r\n    lingering illness of five or six days. The only other attacked was a\r\n    girl, who recovered under treatment by bleeding &c.[1516]\r\n\r\nIn 1833 the whole number of deaths assigned to cholera in country places\r\nwas 2,756, while 2,552 deaths were reported from the towns. It appears to\r\nbe accepted (by Wilde) that true Asiatic cholera lingered in Ireland until\r\n1834, and that it had caused a considerable part of the 4,419 deaths\r\nassigned to “cholera” under that year in the Census of 1841. There is one\r\nreference to undoubted cases of the Asiatic type in 1834 in Ross, Nenagh\r\nand other places in the same district[1517].\r\n\r\nAssuming that all the deaths so called in the three years 1832, 1833 and\r\n1834 were true Asiatic cholera, that imported infection accounted for 1 in\r\n5·68 deaths from all causes in Munster, 1 in 5·98 in Leinster, 1 in 9·86\r\nin Connaught and 1 in 15·15 in Ulster. The proportion of attacks to\r\nfatalities in eight of the principal towns in the following table varies\r\nmuch, Belfast having comparatively few deaths for all its many cases, and\r\nKilkenny three deaths to about five cases: these differences must have\r\ndepended upon the number of cases of “cholerine” or diarrhoea which\r\nattended the true “spasmodic” or collapse-cholera, and may or may not have\r\nbeen counted in the returns.\r\n\r\n_Deaths from Asiatic Cholera in Ireland, 1832-33._\r\n\r\n                                 1832           1833\r\n                                                               No. of\r\n                          Country   Town   Country  Town    places with\r\n                           deaths  deaths  deaths  deaths     Cholera\r\n  LEINSTER\r\n    Carlow                    --      --      64     116         vi\r\n    Dublin                   460     187      32      17       xxiv\r\n     _Dublin City_            --    5632      --     166\r\n    Kildare                  108      72      55     104         xi\r\n    Kilkenny                  91      14     130      29         ix\r\n     _Kilkenny City_          --     296      --     144\r\n    King’s                    40     288      10      --          v\r\n    Longford                  22      63      --      --        iii\r\n    Louth                    115     189      --      --       viii\r\n    Meath                     61     105      81     113        vii\r\n     _Drogheda Town_          --     491      --      --\r\n    Queen’s                   17     111      16      --         iv\r\n    Westmeath                 18     121      84       5         iv\r\n    Wexford                  126     362      24     150          v\r\n    Wicklow                    8      40      --      23         iv\r\n\r\n  MUNSTER\r\n    Clare                    453     281     166       8       xiii\r\n    Cork                     325    1028     466     240       xxxv\r\n      _Cork City_             --    1385      --     234\r\n    Kerry                     87     440     109     181       viii\r\n    Limerick                  82       4     668     173        xvi\r\n      _Limerick City_         --    1105      --      --\r\n    Tipperary                198     910     224     208        xii\r\n    Waterford                 52      52      48      79         ix\r\n      _Waterford City_        --      24      --     245\r\n\r\n  ULSTER\r\n    Antrim                    70      66      --      75          v\r\n      _Belfast Town_          --     418      --      --\r\n    Armagh                    13      57       2      --         vi\r\n    Cavan                     21      11      70      51         vi\r\n    Donegal                   37     139     141      --        vii\r\n    Down                     110     423      65      37        xiv\r\n    Fermanagh                  4      50      --       9         iv\r\n    Londonderry                3     222      --      --         iv\r\n    Monaghan                  64      50      13      43         iv\r\n    Tyrone                   100     193      17       9         ix\r\n\r\n  CONNAUGHT\r\n    Galway                   141     430      82      --        xii\r\n      _Galway Town_           --     596      --      --\r\n    Leitrim                    1      --     101      --         vi\r\n    Mayo                     151     325      12      68         xi\r\n    Roscommon                 47     105      38      25        vii\r\n    Sligo                     62     698      25      --         iv\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cholera of 1832 in England.\r\n\r\nThe certainty that Asiatic cholera was at Sunderland in November and at\r\nNewcastle in December, 1831, led to quarantine of ships arriving in the\r\nThames from the Wear and the Tyne. The early numbers of the ‘Cholera\r\nGazette’ published lists of vessels from these northern coal ports\r\ndetained at Stangate Creek on the Medway[1518]. At length about the middle\r\nof February, 1832, three suspicious cases occurred together in\r\nRotherhithe, one of them being of a man who had been scraping the bottom\r\nof a Sunderland vessel. Other cases came close upon these in the parishes\r\non both sides of the Thames from Rotherhithe and Limehouse to Lambeth and\r\nChelsea, especially in the Southwark parishes.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of Asiatic cholera was vehemently contested for several\r\nweeks by a section of the profession, who frequented the Westminster\r\nMedical Society and had for their organ the ‘London Medical and Surgical\r\nJournal.’ The slow progress of the disease at first, and the apparent\r\nextinction of it for a week or two at the end of May (as at Glasgow and\r\nelsewhere in Scotland in the same weeks) encouraged these doubts, although\r\nthe 994 fatalities in 1848 cases from 14 February to 15 May were quite\r\nunlike any experience of cholera nostras. After the river-side parishes,\r\ncases were reported most from other crowded parts, such as St Giles’s in\r\nthe Fields. From the middle of June the infection became more severe and\r\nwidely spread, still making the river-side parishes its chief seat, but\r\nextending beyond Southwark on one side, and on the north side to such\r\nlocalities as Fetter Lane, Field Lane and parts of the City. From the 15th\r\nof June to the 31st October the cases in London were 9142 and the deaths\r\n4266; in November and December only thirty more cases were known, of which\r\none half were fatal. The total for the year in London came to 11,020 cases\r\nwith 5275 deaths. This was admitted to have been for Asiatic cholera a\r\nslight and partial visitation of the metropolis. London with a population\r\nof a million and a half had actually fewer deaths than Dublin with its two\r\nhundred thousand inhabitants. Paris had more cholera deaths in one week of\r\nApril (5523 deaths, April 8-14) than London had in all the year.\r\n\r\n_The Asiatic Cholera of 1831-32 in England._\r\n\r\n                             No. of\r\n                             places      Places with highest\r\n                    Deaths  attacked  mortalities in each county\r\n\r\n  London              5275\r\n  Surrey, part of       --    --\r\n  Kent                 135    xi      Minster (Sheerness) 38\r\n  Sussex                --    --\r\n  Hampshire             91    ii      Portsmouth 86, _Southampton no\r\n                                          return_\r\n  Berkshire             52    iv      Wantage 27\r\n  Middlesex, part of    62    iv      Uxbridge 34, Edmonton 11\r\n  Buckinghamshire      105    iv      Aylesbury 60, Olney 22\r\n  Oxfordshire          219   xii      Oxford 86, Bicester 64\r\n  Northamptonshire      --    --\r\n  Huntingdonshire       45   iii      Fenstanton 21, Ramsey 20, St Ives 4\r\n  Bedfordshire          40    ii      Bedford 36\r\n  Cambridgeshire       208    iv      Whittlesea 97, Ely 61, Wisbech 41\r\n  Essex                 38    iv      Barking 18, Chelmsford 10\r\n  Suffolk                1     i      Woodbridge 1\r\n  Norfolk              232    vi      Norwich 129, Lynn 49, Denver 27,\r\n                                          _Yarmouth no return_\r\n  Wiltshire             14    ii      Chippenham 9, Farley 5, _Salisbury\r\n                                          no return_\r\n  Dorset                19    ii      Bridport 16, Charmouth 3\r\n  Devon               1901 xxvii      Plymouth 702, Devonport 228, East\r\n                                          Stonehouse 133, Exeter 386\r\n  Cornwall             308    xi      St Paul 81, Penzance 64\r\n  Somerset             142     v      Paulton 66, Bath 49, Tiverton 23\r\n  Gloucestershire      932  viii      Bristol 630, Clifton 64, Gloucester\r\n                                          123, Tewkesbury 76, Upton 34\r\n  Herefordshire         --    --\r\n  Shropshire           158   vii      Shrewsbury 75, Oldbury 37, Madeley 27\r\n  Staffordshire       1870   xiv      Bilston 693, Tipton 281, Sedgley\r\n                                          231, Wolverhampton 193, King’s\r\n                                          Winsford 83, Wednesbury 78,\r\n                                          Walsall 77, Newcastle-u.-Lyme 60,\r\n                                          W.

The dates of outbreak at each place (omitted in the table) show\r\nthat its great seasons everywhere, except at Sunderland, Newcastle and\r\nMusselburgh, were the summer and autumn. New centres or foci of infection\r\nwere made in all directions, and in a good many small places there were\r\nepidemics which produced much alarm although the figures look\r\ninsignificant in the statistical table. Some counties, such as\r\nLeicestershire, Herefordshire, Derbyshire, Northamptonshire,\r\nLincolnshire, Suffolk, Sussex, Dorset, Wiltshire, and several of the Welsh\r\ncounties, escaped with a few cases at perhaps one village or town. Some\r\ntowns, such as Birmingham, Cheltenham, Cambridge and Hereford, had only a\r\nfew cases (or none) in 1832 as in the later epidemics in England. Most of\r\nthe towns which now head the list of high death-rates by common summer\r\ndiarrhoea, chiefly infantile (as in the preceding chapter), had only a few\r\nimported cases but no real epidemic extension; these were Preston,\r\nBlackburn, Bury, Rochdale, Oldham, Bolton, Halifax, Leicester and\r\nCoventry; while Bradford, Stockport and Wigan had comparatively few. The\r\ngreater epidemics, besides those which started the disease at Sunderland\r\nand Newcastle, were, in order of time, at Hull and Goole, Liverpool,\r\nManchester, Warrington, Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Bristol, Plymouth,\r\nwith Devonport and Stonehouse, Southampton, Portsmouth, Exeter, Salisbury,\r\nvarious towns of the Black Country in South Staffordshire, Dudley, Merthyr\r\nTydvil, Carlisle, Whitehaven, with other ports of the Cumberland\r\ncoal-fields, and Douglas in the Isle of Man. Devonshire, Cornwall, the\r\nWest Riding of Yorkshire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire had each a large\r\nnumber of minor centres, besides the greater foci at Plymouth and Exeter,\r\nand at Leeds and Sheffield. The severity of the disease in some parts of\r\nEngland called forth a few special accounts, from which certain\r\nrepresentative details may be taken.\r\n\r\nThe most disastrous outbreak in all England was at Bilston, in the centre\r\nof the Black Country, near Wolverhampton[1519]. The first cases in that\r\npart of England were at Dudley early in June, in some travelling German\r\nbroom-sellers. In the end of June a canal boatman from Manchester died of\r\ncholera in his boat four miles from Wolverhampton; the boat was sunk. In\r\nthe first week of July another canal boatman died of cholera at Tipton,\r\nafter returning from Liverpool. The infection became established during\r\nJuly in the parish of Tipton, thickly peopled with miners and\r\niron-workers[1520]. At length on the 4th of August a case occurred in the\r\nadjoining town of Bilston, about two and a half miles to the south-east of\r\nWolverhampton.\r\n\r\n    Bilston was a town of 14,492 inhabitants, nearly all of the working\r\n    class. It was irregularly built on high ground, full of forges and\r\n    surrounded by mines. Its soil was perfectly dry “from the water having\r\n    been drawn off for the purpose of getting the mines[1521].” The\r\n    streets were for the most part wide and open; many houses stood in\r\n    courts and back yards, but the town was so irregularly built as not to\r\n    be densely crowded. The Birmingham and Staffordshire Canal passed\r\n    through the whole length of the township, and there was one small\r\n    brook traversing the town. The people usually earned good wages, but\r\n    trade had been depressed since March, 1832. There was a good deal of\r\n    drunkenness among them, and a peculiar addiction to the sports for\r\n    which the Black Country is still celebrated, including at that time\r\n    bull-baiting. The public health was in general good, the deaths having\r\n    been 23 in May, 31 in June, and 25 in July. The churchyard of the\r\n    original chapel was full; a new chapel had been built, and a\r\n    burial-ground consecrated, in 1831. Bilston wake had been held on 29th\r\n    July, 1832, with the usual orgies notwithstanding the depression of\r\n    trade. On the night of Friday the 3rd of August a married woman in\r\n    Temple Street, occupying a poor and filthy house, who had supped\r\n    heartily on pig’s fry and had drunk freely of small beer, was seized\r\n    with purging, which turned to fatal spasmodic cholera. Within an hour\r\n    medical aid was sought for two more cases of the same in poor and\r\n    filthy houses in Bridge Street and Hall Street, about four hundred\r\n    yards from each other and from the house in Temple Street. At the back\r\n    of the latter was a most offensive pigsty, and beyond the pigsty a\r\n    poor cottage in which lived a widow and four children; cholera\r\n    attacked them, two of the children dying on the 6th August and another\r\n    on the 7th. The night of the 9th of August was most oppressively hot.\r\n    In the week ending the 10th August there had been 150 cases and 36\r\n    deaths from cholera. On the 10th the disease appeared in a new quarter\r\n    to the west, called Wynn’s Fold; the 12th was again an oppressively\r\n    hot day, followed by rain over-night. On the 14th the disease began\r\n    its ravages in Etlingshall Lane, at the western end of the township, a\r\n    mile from the scene of the first outbreak. The attacks in the week\r\n    ending 17 August had risen to 616 and the deaths to 133. On the 16th\r\n    it was remarked that the flies had disappeared and the swallows with\r\n    them; both came back together when the epidemic was declining. Whole\r\n    families were now being cut off, father, mother and perhaps three\r\n    children. Mr Leigh, the curate of the parish, went on the 18th to\r\n    Birmingham to secure a supply of coffins and medical aid, the medical\r\n    men of the town being worn out (two of them died a few days after).\r\n    The deaths between the 19th and 26th of August numbered 309. On the\r\n    latter date a dispensary was opened, after which the proportion of\r\n    fatalities to attacks became less. On the 18th of September, the last\r\n    death occurred, and the epidemic was over, having attacked 3568 in a\r\n    population of 14,492, and destroyed 742, of whom 594 were over ten\r\n    years of age. The following is the complete bill:\r\n\r\n    _Cholera at Bilston, 1832._\r\n\r\n           Week                          Deaths under\r\n          ending      Attacks    Death    ten years\r\n\r\n        Aug.   10       150        36         5\r\n               17       616       133        23\r\n               24       924       298        58\r\n               31       832       184        34\r\n        Sept.   7       694        62        18\r\n               14       250        23         6\r\n               21       102         6         4\r\n                       ----       ---       ---\r\n                       3568       742       148\r\n\r\n    No fewer than 450 Bilston children under the age of twelve were left\r\n    orphans by the cholera; for them a national subscription was made to\r\n    the amount of £8536. 8_s._ 7_d._, and applied to the building and\r\n    support of a Cholera Orphan School, which was opened on the 3rd of\r\n    August, 1833, the first anniversary of the outbreak of cholera in the\r\n    town.\r\n\r\n    In the adjoining parish of Sedgley, although the deaths were only 290\r\n    in a larger population (20,577), the infection was as severe in\r\n    certain places. “Sometimes a whole hamlet seemed to be smitten all at\r\n    once, so that, in some of the streets, or rather rows of tenements,\r\n    there was scarcely a house without one sick, or dying, or dead.” At\r\n    Tipton, in one family of 14 no fewer than 12 died; and in eight\r\n    different tenements every inhabitant was swept off. At Dudley one had\r\n    a narrow escape of being buried alive. In twelve parishes or\r\n    townships, with a population of 160,000, cholera attacked about 10,000\r\n    and cut off about 2000. The effects of the pestilence were all the\r\n    more terrible from its swiftness, for in each parish it was in full\r\n    vigour not above a month. The population of miners and iron-workers, a\r\n    rough set addicted to brutal sports and to drunkenness, could not\r\n    believe that brandy was not a specific, and made it circulate at\r\n    funerals to fortify against infection. A reformation of morals and\r\n    revival of religion is said to have followed the scourge[1522]. The\r\n    following is the list of chief centres in the Black Country:\r\n\r\n                              Cholera\r\n                               deaths\r\n\r\n        Bilston                 693\r\n        Tipton                  281\r\n        Sedgley                 231\r\n        Dudley                  277\r\n        Wolverhampton           193\r\n        King’s Winford           83\r\n        Wednesbury               78\r\n        Walsall                  77\r\n        Newcastle-under-Lyme     60\r\n        West Bromwich            59\r\n        Darlaston                57\r\n        Stoke-on-Trent           46\r\n\r\nWolverhampton, which was one of the chief Staffordshire centres of the\r\nnext cholera in 1849, got off somewhat easily in 1832 with 576 attacks\r\n(193 deaths), or one in forty of the population.\r\n\r\n    It was most common and fatal in a lane called Caribee Island, a narrow\r\n    filthy cul-de-sac with an open stagnant ditch down the middle,\r\n    inhabited chiefly by poor Irish. The influence of ground soaked with\r\n    sewage was shown also in the frequency of cases of cholera among\r\n    persons in easy circumstances in the residential locality of\r\n    Darlington Street--“a wide airy street consisting of two rows of\r\n    houses at its upper end, nearest the centre of the town, but of only\r\n    one at the lower part, where it is a raised causeway, open on one side\r\n    to the gardens and meadows beyond. The lower rooms of the houses,\r\n    being below the level of the street, are consequently very damp; and\r\n    within a few yards of the backs of these houses runs a wide ditch, the\r\n    main sewer of that side of the town, which is dammed up and diverted\r\n    into several large cesspools, or receptacles for the mud and filth\r\n    which it deposits. These, in warm weather, emit such offensive\r\n    exhalations as to be almost intolerable to the persons who live near\r\n    them.... It is singular that this was the only part of the town in\r\n    which persons in easy circumstances took the disease[1523].”\r\n\r\nThe cholera had reached Liverpool in the end of April (perhaps from Hull\r\nand York), and attacked 4912 in a population of 230,000, causing 1523\r\ndeaths before the end of autumn. The very large number of cellar-dwellings\r\nand back-to-back houses in the town at that time favoured the infection;\r\nbut Liverpool was on all subsequent occasions one of the worst centres.\r\nTwo incidents in 1832 are connected with ships.\r\n\r\n    On 18 May, 1832, the ‘Brutus,’ of 384 tons, sailed from Liverpool for\r\n    Quebec, with a crew of 19, and 330 emigrants who were pauper families\r\n    from agricultural districts sent to Canada at the cost of their\r\n    respective poor-law Unions. The emigrants were ill-provided with\r\n    bedding and clothes, and the ship was under-provisioned. Two days\r\n    after sailing, or seven days, or nine days (accounts differing), a\r\n    case of cholera occurred in an adult, who recovered. Other cases\r\n    quickly followed, with enormous fatality, until the deaths reached 24\r\n    in a day. On the 3rd of June the captain put back for Liverpool, his\r\n    provisions having run short, and his drugs (laudanum) being exhausted.\r\n    By the time the ship reached Liverpool there had been 117 cases of\r\n    cholera (of which four were among the crew) and 81 deaths, seven cases\r\n    remaining at her arrival, of which two ended fatally, making the\r\n    deaths 83[1524].\r\n\r\nAnother Liverpool incident is noteworthy:\r\n\r\n    “One morning a mate and one or two men, who had gone to bed the\r\n    preceding evening in good health on a vessel lying in one of the\r\n    Liverpool docks, were found suffering from cholera. The men were\r\n    immediately removed to a hospital and the vessel ordered into the\r\n    river; when another vessel, with a healthy crew took its situation in\r\n    the dock: the next morning all the hands on board the second vessel\r\n    fell sick of the cholera. Upon examining the dock in this part, a\r\n    large sewer was found to empty itself immediately under the spot where\r\n    these vessels had been placed[1525].”\r\n\r\nOne of the ablest accounts of the cholera of 1832 was that by Dr Gaulter,\r\nof Manchester. The deaths there were 706, and 216 in Salford; but it\r\nappeared surprising that, being so many and widely spread, they should not\r\nhave been many more.\r\n\r\n    An inspection by the local Board of Health two months before the first\r\n    case appeared “disclosed in the quarters of the poor--a name that\r\n    might be almost taken [at that time] as a synonym with that of the\r\n    working classes--such scenes of filth and crowding and dilapidation,\r\n    such habits of intemperance and low sensuality, and in some districts\r\n    such unmitigated want and wretchedness,” that the picture correctly\r\n    drawn seemed to many a malicious libel. From that picture, “it was\r\n    certainly to have been expected that nearly the whole mass of the\r\n    working population would have been swept away by the disease.” There\r\n    were few good sewers, and it would have required £300,000 to sewer\r\n    Manchester thoroughly. As it was, the infection progressed slowly\r\n    from the first case on 17th May until the end of July[1526]. It was\r\n    the same in Salford, where it “crept about slowly for three or four\r\n    weeks attacking solitary individuals or single families in streets and\r\n    situations the most distant and unconnected, and then suddenly fixing\r\n    itself in the lower and most populous part of the town.” It was in the\r\n    end of July and beginning of August that the sharp outburst took place\r\n    in Manchester also. An old soldier well known in the streets as a\r\n    seller of matches, who “could take a pint of rum without winking,”\r\n    died of cholera in Allen’s Court. His body was allowed to lie in the\r\n    house two days and a half. In four houses of Allen’s Court, 17 cases\r\n    occurred within forty-eight hours, of which 14 were fatal; this court\r\n    was afterwards known as Cholera Court. In the same few days the\r\n    infection was most deadly in Back Hart Street, “infamous as a nest of\r\n    vagabonds and harlots,” and in a street behind it, in which nearly the\r\n    whole of fourteen attacks ended fatally. Blakely Street, a bad fever\r\n    locality in the time of Ferriar (_supra_, p. 150), had the most\r\n    malignant kind of cholera in its lodging-houses. It was remarked that\r\n    few of the factory hands took it: of 1520 employed in Birley and\r\n    Kirk’s mill, only 4 were attacked during the epidemic; more women than\r\n    men took cholera, and generally those that were employed about\r\n    dwelling-houses were the victims[1527].\r\n\r\nThe whole cholera bill at Manchester was as follows:\r\n\r\n_Progress of the Epidemic._\r\n\r\n         Attacks\r\n\r\n  May        4\r\n  June      37\r\n  July     108\r\n  August   650\r\n  Sept.    261\r\n  Oct.     172\r\n  Nov.      33\r\n  Dec.       2\r\n  Jan.       2\r\n\r\n_Ages of the patients._\r\n\r\n             Attacks    Deaths\r\n\r\n  1-15         199       101\r\n  15-25        153        53\r\n  25-35        264        98\r\n  35-45        192        93\r\n  45-55        197       116\r\n  55-65        120        85\r\n  65-80         85        68\r\n\r\nThree cholera hospitals were provided in Manchester, at which about\r\none-half of all the cases were received:\r\n\r\n                                Cases    Deaths\r\n\r\n  Swan Street Hospital           443      234\r\n  Knott Mill Hospital            242      122\r\n  Chorlton on Medlock Hospital    29       17\r\n  At their homes                 697      335\r\n\r\nIn Salford all the patients were treated at their homes--644 with 197\r\ndeaths; there were also 60 cases among the prisoners in the New Bailey,\r\nwith 19 deaths.\r\n\r\n    The Swan Street Hospital was the occasion of a remarkable cholera riot\r\n    on the 2nd of September. A mob numbering several thousand persons\r\n    filled the streets near the hospital; in the thick of it was carried a\r\n    small coffin, from which the headless trunk of a child was taken at\r\n    intervals and shown to the crowd. The child had died of cholera in the\r\n    hospital and the body had been examined _post mortem_. Some rumours of\r\n    this had gone abroad, the body was exhumed, and was found\r\n    unaccountably mangled. This was the time when intense feeling had been\r\n    roused all over the country by the procuring of bodies for anatomical\r\n    dissection, the prejudice extending to the ordinary pathological\r\n    inspection also. At Sunderland the holding of two or three necropsies\r\n    had turned the people against the Cholera Hospital. At Dublin there\r\n    was a rigid rule that no body was to be examined after death in the\r\n    great cholera hospital of some 700 beds. The body of the child exhumed\r\n    at Manchester had been found with the head severed, and the rioters\r\n    declared that it had been murdered. They broke into the hospital,\r\n    carried off the patients to their homes, and wrecked the furniture and\r\n    fittings of the wards. The military was at length called out to clear\r\n    the streets[1528].\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of cholera at Bristol reproduced most of the incidents at\r\nother places. There had been numerous suspicious cases of choleraic\r\ndisease in the early summer, including an outbreak in the gaol in the\r\nfirst week of July.\r\n\r\n    The first unequivocal cases occurred on the 11th July in a filthy\r\n    court, in strangers from Bath where there was then no cholera. About\r\n    the same time the infection showed itself at several places apart,\r\n    especially in the destitute suburb of St Philip, in the south-east of\r\n    the city. One of the worst centres was the city Poorhouse, in which\r\n    268 cases with 94 deaths occurred from the 24th July to the 20th\r\n    August. The largest number of seizures on one day was 79 on the 17th\r\n    August, the largest number of deaths 33 on the 15th. After that it\r\n    gradually declined, and was over by the middle of November. The\r\n    attacks reported were 1612, the deaths 626; but these figures came\r\n    short of the truth, as many cases were not reported, and the burials\r\n    from all causes were in excess of the average for the season after\r\n    deducting the reported cholera deaths. Although it fell at Bristol, as\r\n    elsewhere, upon the poorest quarters and the most abandoned or\r\n    destitute class, yet it showed caprices among these. Marsh Street, the\r\n    abode of the lower Irish, and one of the most thickly peopled parts of\r\n    the city, was the last place visited. Lewin’s Mead, a low and crowded\r\n    quarter, had only a few scattered cases[1529].\r\n\r\nLittle is known of the great epidemic in Plymouth, Devonport, and East\r\nStonehouse, beyond the gross result that it caused 1063 deaths in the town\r\nand the two dockyards[1530]. Of the outbreak at Southampton not even the\r\nfigures are known, the only important omission, besides the epidemic at\r\nSalisbury, in the whole of the cholera of 1832. On the other hand the\r\nExeter cholera has been related at greater length than any[1531].\r\n\r\n    It was mainly an autumnal outbreak, the largest number of attacks on\r\n    one day being 89 on the 13th August, and the maximum daily burials 30\r\n    a few days before. The total attacks were 1135, the deaths 345; they\r\n    were chiefly in the south-western suburb of the city, among the poorer\r\n    class, the two St Mary parishes having 3·65 and 3·26 per cent. of\r\n    their population attacked, the parish of St George 3·41, St John 2·73,\r\n    and Trinity 1·54, while two whole parishes had no cases.\r\n\r\nSomewhat late in the autumn the infection spread through Cornwall. Its\r\ngeneral prevalence was also late in the South Wales mining district\r\n(insignificant compared with its enormous ravages there in the next\r\ncholera of 1849) and in Carlisle, in Whitehaven and the other seaports of\r\nCumberland. Hartlepool, for all its nearness to the original centre of\r\ncholera infection in Sunderland, was one of the last places to be\r\ninfected, in the autumn of 1832[1532].\r\n\r\nThe Central Board of Health made no report upon the cholera of 1832,\r\nunless a document sent to the king (William IV.) may have consisted of\r\nsomething more than the alphabetical list of infected places, with dates\r\nand numbers, which Sir James Clark found some years after in a drawer of\r\nthe royal library. But some lessons of the epidemic were obvious without\r\nthe aid of an official report. The late summer and autumn was undoubtedly\r\nits chief season--except in places where the poison had, as it were, spent\r\nitself in the winter or early spring, such as Sunderland and Musselburgh.\r\nA subsidence and seeming extinction of the epidemic in spring and early\r\nsummer was observed at Glasgow and Edinburgh as well as in London; but it\r\nwas far otherwise in Paris, where sixteen thousand deaths occurred in the\r\nsingle month of April[1533]. As to locality, the infection seemed to\r\nprefer low grounds, such as the shore quarters of seaports and the banks\r\nof rivers. The town moor of Sunderland, around which the infection found\r\nits first habitat in Britain, appeared to be a typical cholera soil--a wet\r\nbottom of tenacious clay, almost impassable in winter from the water\r\nstanding in it, the surface covered with heaps of excremental and other\r\nrefuse from the crowded lanes near it. But the greatest centre of cholera\r\nin England in 1832, the town of Bilston, seemed to be the reverse of\r\nthis--a rising ground from which the water had been drained away by the\r\nnumerous mines of coal, iron and limestone all round it. Again, in towns\r\nor villages built upon a slope or on heights and hollows, such as\r\nGateshead, Newburn and Collieston (most of all in Quebec on the steep bank\r\nof the St Lawrence), the infection did not confine itself to the lower\r\npart only. But it was remarked that among the Tyneside villages several on\r\nhigh ground escaped altogether, although within a mile or two of others\r\nseverely visited. This question of elevation comes up more definitely in\r\nthe cholera of 1849.\r\n\r\nAnother obvious thing in the epidemic of 1832 was that many of the first\r\nvictims were among the destitute, drunken or reckless class. But there\r\nwere innumerable exceptions, notably in Paris, where the multitude of\r\nvictims included several peers, deputies, diplomatic personages and the\r\nprime minister.\r\n\r\n    One of the most striking things in the habits or preferences of\r\n    cholera in 1832 was the early and unaccountable selection of the\r\n    inmates of lunatic asylums, the fatuous paupers of workhouses,\r\n    prisoners, or other immured persons badly housed and ill-fed. In most\r\n    of these cases it was a mystery how the poison of cholera had got\r\n    inside the walls. The earliest important instance was that of the Town\r\n    Hospital or pauper infirmary of Glasgow. Other instances were the\r\n    lunatic wards of Haslar Hospital, Hanwell asylum, Bethnal Green\r\n    lunatic asylum, Lancaster county asylum, the Manchester New Bailey,\r\n    situated in Salford, Coldbath Fields Prison, London, Clerkenwell\r\n    workhouse (65 deaths), Bristol poorhouse (94 deaths). In the remote\r\n    Westmoreland village of Hawkshead, thirteen miles from Kendal, cholera\r\n    appeared unaccountably among the sixteen inmates of the poorhouse,\r\n    attacking eight of them with sudden and severe symptoms so that four\r\n    died; it was impossible to trace the introduction of the virus, but\r\n    the poorhouse was nearly surrounded with stagnant water[1534].\r\n\r\nHardly anything was more keenly debated than the question as to how\r\ncholera spread. It was not difficult to find some instances of infection\r\nseemingly got from contact with living or dead cholera bodies: cases\r\nsuggestive of that occurred at Sunderland at the outset, and later in\r\nIreland more especially[1535]. In the Swan Street cholera hospital at\r\nManchester, eight nurses took the infection, of whom four died. But on the\r\nwhole the immunity of nurses (as in the Great Gorman Lane hospital of\r\nDublin) and of medical men was remarkable. Although constantly in the\r\npresence of cholera patients, sometimes lingering over them, as in the\r\noperation of blood-letting, very few took the disease. In Manchester only\r\none medical practitioner was known to have had an attack, a mild one.\r\nGaulter says that Dr Alsop, of Birmingham, and Mr Keane, of Warrington,\r\nwere the only two medical men known to him to have died of cholera in\r\nEngland; but two of the Bilston doctors died in the height of the epidemic\r\nthere, one died at Musselburgh, seven at Sligo, and two at Enniskillen.\r\nThe truth of the matter in cholera appeared to be the same as in plague\r\nand yellow fever, the two great infections that resembled cholera most\r\nclosely as soil-poisons: namely, that contagion from the persons of the\r\nsick was a contingency, as Rush, of Philadelphia, had taught for yellow\r\nfever in the end of last century, and Blane had taught after him. A\r\nLondon writer stated this very fairly in 1832[1536]:\r\n\r\n    “I believe that this disease, like many other epidemic diseases,\r\n    although communicable by miasma in the atmosphere, and originating or\r\n    being producible from a peculiar state of that acting upon the earth,\r\n    is sometimes contagious (or communicable from person to person) and\r\n    sometimes not contagious. I believe the contagious nature of the\r\n    disease depends: first, upon the number accumulated in one place, and\r\n    the unhealthiness or ill-ventilated state of that place; or, in other\r\n    words, upon the degree in which the miasma is condensed; secondly,\r\n    upon the length of time a person remains exposed to the poison; third,\r\n    upon the debility, or morbid irritability, and consequent\r\n    susceptibility of the person’s frame, especially of the abdominal\r\n    viscera.” The miasmata of an apartment, to be strong enough to become\r\n    contagious, must arrive at a certain degree of concentration.\r\n\r\nCholera was, at all events, very different from typhus fever in the point\r\nof contagiousness: for in the epidemics of the latter many medical men\r\nfell victims, and the susceptibility to contagion was greater in\r\nproportion to the health and vigour of those who mixed with the sick.\r\n\r\nIt was well understood in 1832 that foul linen, bedding and clothes were a\r\nmost certain means of carrying the poison, especially if they had been\r\nkept concealed for a time, or packed away in a chest or bundle. This was\r\nprecisely the old experience of plague. The theory that the poison of\r\ncholera was conveyed in the drinking-water, of which illustrations were\r\ncollected in 1849 and 1854, was not applied to any of the particular\r\noutbreaks in 1832. But one writer made a guess at it, assuming, as Snow\r\ndid in 1849 and 1854, that the stomach and bowels were the organs by which\r\nthe virus entered the system:\r\n\r\n    “From an attentive observation of the course this epidemic has taken\r\n    in those places and countries which it has hitherto visited, I have\r\n    been induced to draw the conclusion that a noxious matter or poison,\r\n    being generated in the earth, has been diffused in the different\r\n    springs in such situations [therefore he suggests the filtering of\r\n    water through charcoal], and that this matter, being conveyed into the\r\n    stomach with the fluid in question, produces that train of symptoms\r\n    which, commencing in this organ, afterwards extends with more or less\r\n    rapidity to the rest of the body[1537].”\r\n\r\n    In the treatment of cholera in 1832 many things were tried. The view\r\n    taken of the pathology naturally determined the means of cure. To\r\n    check the premonitory diarrhoea was seen to be of the first\r\n    importance, and to that end laudanum or other form of opium was the\r\n    familiar means. Lawrie, at Glasgow, found it most satisfactory, at a\r\n    time when the profession in London were, as he says, denouncing it as\r\n    a pernicious error. Towards the end of the epidemic in Dublin, Graves\r\n    combined with the opium acetate of lead in large doses (a scruple of\r\n    acetate of lead with a grain of opium, divided into twelve pills, one\r\n    to be given every half-hour until the rice-water evacuations from the\r\n    stomach and bowels began to diminish)[1538]. Some professed to find\r\n    great benefit from blood-letting at a sufficiently early stage in the\r\n    attack[1539]. The enormous drain of the fluids, leaving the blood\r\n    thick or tarry, suggested to some that saline substances would be\r\n    beneficial. The saline treatment was indeed the principal subject of\r\n    writing during the year 1832. One way was to give saline drugs by the\r\n    mouth; another way was to inject into a vein a large quantity of\r\n    distilled water with some common salt and bicarbonate of soda\r\n    dissolved in it, the vein at the bend of the elbow being usually\r\n    chosen to operate on. Some were confident that they had saved lives in\r\n    this manner, others were equally clear that salines were useless. One\r\n    writer had abandoned salines by the mouth as a “most useless remedy,”\r\n    while he had not lost faith in their intravenous injection, four\r\n    having recovered out of twenty-three in which he had tried it. At\r\n    length, however, the intravenous use of salines was abandoned\r\n    also[1540].\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the greatest of all the lessons taught by cholera\r\nwas the need of sanitary reform. The disease in its successive visitations\r\nso obviously sought out the spots of ground most befouled with excremental\r\nand other filth as to bring home to everyone the dangers of the casual\r\ndisposal of town refuse. It was not until some years after the first visit\r\nof cholera that much was done in the way of extending the main drainage of\r\ntowns, connecting the house-drainage systematically therewith, getting rid\r\nof open nuisances in back yards, and protecting the water-supplies from\r\ncontamination. The Report of the Health of Towns Commission, 1844, was\r\n“the great magazine from which sanitary reformers drew their\r\nweapons[1541].” In the next few years an active school of sanitarians\r\narose, including Sutherland of Liverpool, Grainger of London, and others.\r\nIn 1848 was passed the first Public Health Act, administered by a Board of\r\nHealth, of which Lord Shaftesbury was chairman, Chadwick and Southwood\r\nSmith members. London was excepted from the scope of the Act; but the City\r\nhad a most vigorous medical officer in the person of John Simon, whose\r\nreports dealt with public sanitation on broad principles applicable to the\r\ncapital and the whole kingdom. The movement in favour of sanitation, thus\r\nbegun, received an irresistible impulse from the cholera of 1849, the\r\nlessons of which were as obvious as those of 1832.\r\n\r\nThe cholera which reached Orenburg in 1829 and Astrakhan in 1830 lingered\r\nin one part of Europe or another until 1837, Portugal and Spain having\r\nbeen its chief theatre in 1833, the south of France in 1834, Italy in 1835\r\nand 1836, Austria, the Tyrol, Bavaria and (for the second time) Poland and\r\nthe Baltic ports in 1837. In England, there was some revival of the seeds\r\nof it in 1833, as many as 1454 deaths being put down to Asiatic cholera in\r\nLondon from the 1st of August to the 7th of September. There was an\r\nundoubted epidemic of it at the fishing village of Ferryden, near\r\nMontrose, in June, 1833 (27 deaths during four weeks in a population of\r\n700), the infection having been brought by one or more of the crew of the\r\nsmack ‘Eagle’ from the Thames[1542]. In Glasgow a case occurred in Boar\r\nHead Close, High Street, on 30 May, 1833, which had the blueness, pinched\r\nface, whispering voice and cold clammy skin of Asiatic cholera[1543]. In\r\nIreland there were a good many outbreaks in 1833, especially in villages\r\nor hamlets, and it is believed that these were renewed in 1834. But the\r\nmost singular reappearance of cholera in the British Isles was in the\r\nmonth of December, 1837, some two months after it is believed to have\r\nceased elsewhere in Europe. Outbreaks of true cholera in that month were\r\nobserved at several places in the south of Ireland-around Bere\r\nHaven[1544], at Youghal, at Waterford, and at Dungarvan, where they went\r\nso far as to form a board of health[1545]. It was suspected to have been\r\nin Limehouse, on the Thames, in November. The most remarkable explosion of\r\nit was in the month of January following (1838) among the inmates of the\r\nCoventry House of Industry, of whom no fewer than 55 died in the course of\r\nfour weeks--a mortality from choleraic disease that could hardly be\r\nexplained on the hypothesis of cholera nostras even if the season had been\r\nthe proper one[1546].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cholera of 1848-49 in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of cholera from India, which reached Britain in the autumn of\r\n1848, had progressed as far as Peshawur and Cabul from 1842 to 1844, and\r\nthereafter step by step continuously through Herat, Samarkand, Bokhara,\r\nAstrabad and Teheran by the caravan routes. In the beginning of 1847 it\r\nentered Russia by the two great interior waterways of the Volga and the\r\nDon. Next year, 1848, it reached the German shores of the Baltic and North\r\nSeas, and within a few weeks of its appearance at Hamburg, it was found\r\nestablished on British soil at Edinburgh and Leith in the beginning of\r\nOctober. The severe outburst which followed in the south of Scotland was\r\npurely a winter epidemic, like that of Durham, Northumberland and East\r\nLothian on the last occasion in the winter of 1831-32. It will not be\r\nnecessary to give the details of the cholera of 1848-49 so fully as has\r\nbeen done for 1831-32, but merely to notice special points.\r\n\r\nThe cholera of 1848 broke out almost simultaneously at Newhaven and\r\nEdinburgh, on the 1st and 2nd of October, and at Leith on the 9th. At\r\nNewhaven nearly the whole population was suffering from diarrhoea, in the\r\nmidst of which epidemic the true cholera raged for four weeks only, to the\r\n28th October, attacking 30, of whom 20 died. In Leith the deaths were 185\r\n(males 75, females 110). The Edinburgh outbreak lasted until the 18th of\r\nJanuary, 1849, causing 801 attacks, with 448 deaths (or 478 deaths, of\r\nwhich 196 were males and 282 females). A cholera hospital was opened in\r\nSurgeons’ Square on the 28th of October, the admissions and fatalities to\r\n14th December being as follows:\r\n\r\n              Females Males Total\r\n\r\n  Admitted      152     96   248\r\n  Died           90     64   154\r\n\r\nOf the whole 248 cases, the Grassmarket sent 42, the Cowgate 37, the\r\nCanongate 33, College Wynd 16, High Street 14, and numerous scattered\r\nlocalities of the New and Old towns one or more cases each. Severe\r\noutbreaks took place also at Niddry, Restalrig and Loanhead, villages\r\nclose to Edinburgh[1547]. While this limited epidemic was proceeding in\r\nand around the capital, the infection appeared in the mining region of\r\nCarron at the head of the Firth of Forth, where there were some 400 cases\r\nafter the 6th of December, and in some other mining villages of the Scotch\r\nmidlands.\r\n\r\nGlasgow was infected on the night of the 11th November, in the suburban\r\ndistrict of Springburn, on the north-west of the city close to the Forth\r\nand Clyde Canal. The choice of this spot to begin upon was intelligible\r\nenough in one way, but singular in another. Springburn had come into\r\nexistence as a poor village of weavers about the year 1820; before the\r\ncholera year of 1832 it had grown to a population of 600, and was thought\r\na likely spot for cholera inasmuch as it was one of the most wretched\r\ncommunities in Scotland. It occupied the site of a half-drained bog below\r\nthe level of the canal, from which the water percolated into its subsoil;\r\nits houses were low, always damp, and full of filth. During all the\r\ncholera in Glasgow in 1832 there had not been a case in Springburn until\r\nthe 6th of September, when a girl of the village came home with it and\r\ndied; during her brief illness she was visited by the greater part of the\r\nvillagers, but no other case occurred until six weeks after, on the 15th\r\nof October[1548]. At this spot, where the cholera of 1832 may be said to\r\nhave left off, it began in 1848 with a sudden explosion of numerous\r\nattacks scattered all over the locality; a doctor attended twenty-one\r\ncases before he found two together in the same house or even in the same\r\nlane. There had been forty cases there in November, before any case was\r\ndiscovered in Glasgow; at length it seemed to spread from Springburn all\r\nround as if from a centre, while it also lingered there longer than\r\nanywhere else in the city and suburbs[1549]. On the 5th of December a case\r\nwas reported on the south bank of the Clyde, and another on the 9th in the\r\nwest end. Within a few days the disease fell upon all parts of the city\r\nwith the suddenness of a thunder shower; it reached a height in the\r\nChristmas week, one day, the 30th December, having 158 burials from\r\ncholera. After the orgies of the New Year there was a fresh outburst, 235\r\ncases having been reported on the 5th of January. The proportion of\r\nfatalities was as high as 60 per cent. at the beginning of the epidemic,\r\n50 per cent. about Christmas and the New Year, and thereafter from 30 to\r\n40 per cent. The epidemic was short and sharp, declining irregularly after\r\nthe first or second week of January, and ceasing, but for a few dropping\r\ncases, about the 8th of March.\r\n\r\nThe deaths in Glasgow, which included many among the wealthier class and\r\nmade the festival season of 1848-49 to be long remembered, were about\r\n3800, or 1·06 per cent. of the population (355,800), a higher total but a\r\nlower ratio than in 1832, when the deaths, distributed over many more\r\nweeks of the year and largely due to two revivals in August and October,\r\nwere 1·4 per cent. of the population. At Paisley there were 68 deaths from\r\n26 December to 24 February, and at Charlestown 115 deaths all in some five\r\nweeks from 15 January to 19 February.\r\n\r\nIt was in the same season of midwinter that the cholera burst suddenly\r\nupon many mining villages of Lanarkshire and Ayrshire.\r\n\r\n    In that unlikely season there was an almost universal prevalence of\r\n    diarrhoea. At the mining village of Carnbroe, near Coatbridge, there\r\n    were five sudden attacks on the last night of the old year, one of\r\n    them fatal. On New Year’s day there were forty attacks, thirteen of\r\n    them fatal in a few hours. Terror seized the whole place: one man cut\r\n    his throat in sheer fright. Diarrhoea attacked 1100 of the 1200\r\n    inhabitants, and turned to spasmodic or rice-water cholera in 240 of\r\n    them, of whom 94 died, the rate of fatality being excessive only in\r\n    the first few days. By the end of February the epidemic was over.\r\n\r\n    In the town of Coatbridge, with a population of 4000, the various\r\n    grades of sickness were classified as follows:\r\n\r\n                    Vomiting,\r\n                    purging and   Rice-water            Deaths by\r\n        Diarrhoea   cramp         purging     Cholera    Cholera\r\n\r\n          2659       480            175         107         61\r\n\r\n    In the town of Hamilton, population 9000, the infection was most\r\n    malignant, 440 cases yielding 251 deaths from the 24th of December to\r\n    the 7th of March. The same ravages of winter cholera occurred at some\r\n    of the Ayrshire ironworks, such as Glengarnock, among a very rough and\r\n    drunken class, who were made more than ordinarily reckless and drunken\r\n    by this unaccountable visitation. It was also severe in Riccarton and\r\n    other mining villages round Kilmarnock, but less prevalent in that\r\n    town itself. Dumfries and Maxwelltown, which had been among the last\r\n    places visited by the cholera of 1832, were infected in the middle of\r\n    November, 1848, about the same time as Springburn near Glasgow. One of\r\n    the Dumfries doctors died of rapid cholera on the 10th December, the\r\n    parochial board fell into disputes with the faculty, and the infection\r\n    proceeded amidst great confusion in the poorest parts of the town,\r\n    causing about 250 deaths before Christmas. After that it subsided\r\n    quickly[1550].\r\n\r\n    The other centres in the south of Scotland were Selkirk (13 deaths),\r\n    Kelso (Dec. to end of Jan., maximum of 12 attacks in a day) and\r\n    Jedburgh, which last had escaped in 1832 but had now a very rapid and\r\n    extensive epidemic in its lower parts among drunken people especially.\r\n    A few cases occurred at Moffat, in December; a man who was seized in\r\n    crossing the hills died in a shepherd’s hut eight miles from Moffat\r\n    after twenty-one hours illness[1551].\r\n\r\nThe only recorded epidemic in the north of Scotland in the proper cholera\r\nseason, the summer of 1849, was at Dundee. But there was a small outbreak\r\nin March and April at Campbelton (41 cases, 14 deaths) and Inverness (23\r\ncases, 12 deaths)[1552].\r\n\r\n    The infection began in Dundee on the 29th of May, 1849, in Fish\r\n    Street, the filthiest part of the town. It prevailed in high and low\r\n    situations, but usually in the old localities of typhus fever. One\r\n    group of houses, said to have had a population of 100, had 40 deaths.\r\n    Dudhope Crescent, consisting of seventeen large five-storied tenement\r\n    houses occupied by clean and respectable people, had 57 deaths. In\r\n    about a fourth part of all the fatalities, death was from sudden\r\n    collapse; this was a feature of the 1849 cholera also in Ireland; but\r\n    in Dundee, as elsewhere, there was usually premonitory diarrhoea, and\r\n    a very general prevalence of diarrhoea which never came to true\r\n    cholera[1553].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cholera of 1849 in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe cholera of 1849 found Ireland in a state of exhaustion and confusion.\r\nThe fever and dysentery that followed the great potato famines of 1845 and\r\n1846 were still far from extinct; the workhouses, which had not existed in\r\n1832, were full of paupers. The mortality of nearly half a million in the\r\nfamine years, and the emigration of perhaps three times as many, had\r\nreduced greatly the population of the scattered cabins, hamlets and\r\nvillages; but the towns were more populous than ever from the immense\r\nnumber of destitute persons that had gravitated to them. In these\r\ncircumstances it was not surprising that the cholera of 1849 should have\r\nbeen more disastrous than that of 1832. The infection appeared first in\r\nBelfast in November, 1848, in a man who had come with his family from\r\nEdinburgh and had been admitted into the workhouse. Some thirty cases of\r\ncholera among the inmates followed his death, and at length the infection\r\nwas started at large in the town, probably by a man who had been\r\ndischarged from the workhouse[1554]. The cholera of 1849 in the capital of\r\nUlster was more fatal than that of 1832, causing 969 deaths in 2705\r\nattacks. Over Ireland generally its great season appears to have been, as\r\nin England, the summer, and in part also the spring. Excepting Belfast,\r\nthe principal cities and towns had fewer deaths than in 1832; Dublin\r\nhaving only 1664 as compared with 5632, Cork 1329, or nearly the same\r\nnumber as in 1832, Limerick 746, which was about a fourth less, Galway\r\nless, Waterford about the same as in 1832 and 1833 together, and Drogheda\r\nas severe an epidemic as last time. But the smaller towns and the rural\r\ndistricts generally suffered more. The deaths for all Ireland returned to\r\nthe Board of Health were 19,325, nearly the same total as in 1832; but\r\nthere were no returns included from Wicklow, Cavan, Fermanagh and Donegal,\r\nand it is probable that the returns were otherwise incomplete, the census\r\ntaken in 1851 giving 30,156 cholera deaths under the year 1849, and 35,989\r\nin the whole decennial period from 1841. The larger total was distributed\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  Urban    Rural    In hospitals In workhouses\r\n\r\n  10,653   10,656       7964         6716\r\n\r\nThe number of rural deaths is much larger than in 1832. There were only a\r\nfew towns with over 2000 inhabitants that escaped--one in Connaught, six\r\nin Munster, one out of forty-one in Leinster, while seventeen towns were\r\nvisited in Ulster. The counties of Dublin, Carlow, Clare and Galway\r\nsuffered most; of the smaller towns, Tralee and Dingle lost heavily, both\r\namong the poor and the rich. The town of Ballinasloe, near the confluence\r\nof the Suck with the Shannon, had 756 deaths from 23 April to 19 August, a\r\ngreat part of them in the workhouse. In clinical characters, the cholera\r\nof 1849 was noted in Ireland, as in Scotland and England, for the high\r\nproportion of sudden fatalities, about one-third, without the warnings of\r\ndiarrhoea or the usual choleraic symptoms. It was remarked also that many\r\nchildren under the age of seven died of cholera, about one in ten of all\r\nages. There was a second season in 1850, with 1768 deaths (according to\r\nthe census), but hardly comparable to the return of cholera in 1833 in the\r\ncountry districts more particularly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cholera of 1849 in England.\r\n\r\nThe brief but very severe epidemic of cholera in the south of Scotland in\r\nmidwinter was all over and done with for good before the disease really\r\nbegan in England. Hull, which had a few cases on board ship in the end of\r\n1848, about the same time as the infection began to rage in Edinburgh and\r\nLeith, was spared its great visitation, the greatest in all England, until\r\nthe late summer and autumn[1555]. The progress of the infection in London\r\nalso was strangely different from that in Scotland. There were undoubted\r\ncases in Bethnal Green and other out-parishes in the autumn of 1848, and\r\nthere seemed no reason why the infection should not run through the\r\npopulation and exhaust itself at once, as in Glasgow. But it will appear\r\nfrom the following table of the deaths in London that the real outburst\r\nwas delayed until the summer and autumn of 1849:\r\n\r\n             Cholera\r\n              deaths\r\n\r\n  1848\r\n    Sept.       11\r\n    Oct.       122\r\n    Nov.       215\r\n    Dec.       131\r\n\r\n  1849\r\n    Jan.       262\r\n    Feb.       181\r\n    March       73\r\n    April        9\r\n    May         13\r\n    June       246\r\n    July      1952\r\n    Aug.      4251\r\n    Sept.     6644\r\n    Oct.       464\r\n    Nov.        27\r\n\r\nAlthough a certain number of deaths were returned in October and November,\r\n1848, they came in twos or threes from many parishes of the metropolis and\r\nmade no great impression upon any one locality. It was not until the\r\nbeginning of December that the presence of cholera was fully realized,\r\nowing to an extraordinary explosion of the disease in a huge pauper\r\ninstitution at Tooting. The school contained about a thousand children, of\r\nwhom some three hundred took Asiatic cholera, with one hundred and eighty\r\ndeaths, in the course of three or four weeks: this was the whole cholera\r\nmortality that the parish of Streatham had from first to last. In the\r\nspring months the cases declined all over London in a very remarkable way,\r\nso that it looked for a time as if the infection were extinct, just as in\r\n1832. But in June there was a revival, and thereafter a steady increase to\r\nthe maximum of 6644 deaths in September. The table given under the year\r\n1866 shows upon what parishes the mortality fell most--those of Southwark,\r\nBermondsey, Rotherhithe, Greenwich, Newington, Lambeth and Battersea on\r\nthe south side, of Westminster, the City and Liberties, Shoreditch,\r\nBethnal Green and Whitechapel on the north side of the Thames. It was a\r\nmore severe visitation per head of the inhabitants than that of 1832,\r\ncutting off many beyond the limits of the destitute and reckless class who\r\nwere its most usual victims on the first occasion. Many of the respectable\r\nclass of workmen and small shopkeepers were among the victims. Several\r\nmedical men died of it, including one well-known surgeon, Mr Aston Key,\r\nat his house in St Helen’s Place, Bishopsgate, on 23 August, after a few\r\nhours’ illness. As in Ireland, and at Dundee, an unusually large\r\nproportion of the London deaths, perhaps a fourth part, were from sudden\r\ncollapse and blueness, without premonitory diarrhoea or predominant\r\nintestinal symptoms. Opinion was strongly against contagiousness in this\r\nepidemic. There were 478 cases treated in St Bartholomew’s Hospital, but\r\nnot one of the nurses took cholera.\r\n\r\nThe infection seemed to find out the insanitary spots and to act\r\nmiasmatically upon the residents. The common remark in all parts of\r\nEngland, Scotland and Ireland was that the localities that suffered most\r\nfrom the typhus fever of 1847-48 suffered most also from cholera. The one\r\nblack spot in Kensington was a poor district on the north side of the\r\nparish known as the Potteries, where an immense number of pigs were kept.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable features of the cholera-seasons of 1848-49 was\r\nthe extensive prevalence of common bowel-complaints. Evidence of this has\r\nbeen given for the south of Scotland just before or during the cholera of\r\nmidwinter, a season when diarrhoea is not usual. It was equally remarked\r\nin England in the course of 1849. In the Taunton workhouse, where true\r\nAsiatic cholera broke out in November, there had been many cases of\r\nbowel-complaint, as well as of fever, in the spring (7 deaths from\r\ndysentery and diarrhoea, 5 from fever). In the Exeter workhouse there were\r\neighteen deaths from dysentery in the end of the year, although there is\r\nnothing said of cholera, which caused only 44 deaths in the whole city.\r\nThe efforts of the inspectors sent by the Board of Health were in great\r\npart directed to finding out the cases of “premonitory” diarrhoea, by\r\nhouse-to-house visitation, and insisting upon the importance of checking\r\nit before it could turn to true cholera. Leeds will serve as an example of\r\nEnglish towns. In an incomplete survey after the month of July there were\r\nfound 5129 cases of simple diarrhoea, 1484 cases of dysentery, 1273 cases\r\nof choleraic diarrhoea, and 1090 cases of true cholera[1556]. It was\r\nsomething of a paradox that, with such excessive prevalence of ordinary\r\nbowel-complaints, an unusual proportion of the cases of true cholera\r\nproved quickly fatal with symptoms of collapse and asphyxia only.\r\n\r\nJust as the first startling indication of the presence of Asiatic cholera\r\nin London was the enormous fatality in the pauper school at Tooting in the\r\nwinter, so in some other towns the infection seemed to pick out workhouses\r\nor prisons to begin upon. At Belfast there were forty cases in the\r\nworkhouse before there was one in the town. At Liverpool there were 28\r\ncholera deaths in the first quarter of 1849, of which 8 were in the\r\nworkhouse. At Wakefield, 19 died of cholera in January, 16 of these in the\r\nHouse of Correction. Among the people at large the infection made little\r\nprogress until the summer. In the first and second quarters of the year it\r\nis heard of, but to a moderate extent, in the towns and colliery districts\r\nof Durham and Northumberland, which were the scene of its earliest\r\noutbreak in the winter of 1831-32.

The\r\nminers suffered most, the lower class in the seaports next most severely.\r\nThe Black Country in the south of Staffordshire, which had been the worst\r\ncentre of the 1832 cholera, was again one of its chief centres in 1849,\r\nthe mortality falling most, as before, upon the town of Bilston, and next\r\nto it upon Willenhall and Wolverhampton. But a great rival to the\r\nStaffordshire coal and iron mining had sprung up since 1832 in Glamorgan;\r\nand it was in this comparatively new region of miners that cholera in 1849\r\nreproduced the Black Country horrors of 1832 and, indeed, surpassed them.\r\n\r\n    Merthyr Tydvil had sprung up more like a vast miners’ camp than like a\r\n    well-ordered municipality. Along the eastern side of the Taff valley,\r\n    on the slopes and in bottoms of the hills, but everywhere at an\r\n    elevation of some four or five hundred feet above the level of Cardiff\r\n    docks, were numerous groups of mean-looking miners’ cottages, with\r\n    their attendant ale-houses, small retail shops, schools and\r\n    meeting-houses. This peculiar township had drawn to itself the special\r\n    notice of the Health of Towns Commission in 1844: “From the poorer\r\n    inhabitants (who constitute the mass of the population) throwing all\r\n    slops and refuse into the nearest open gutter before their houses,\r\n    from the impeded course of such channels, and the scarcity of privies,\r\n    some parts of the town are complete networks of filth emitting noxious\r\n    exhalations.... During the rapid increase of the town no attention\r\n    seems to have been paid to its drainage.”\r\n\r\n    In this district the registrar had returned 162 deaths from “cholera”\r\n    in the year 1841, which must have been from an unusually severe type\r\n    of cholera nostras or British cholera. A first case of Asiatic cholera\r\n    occurred at Cardiff in a sailor on the 13th of May, 1849, a week after\r\n    there was a case at Lower Merthyr, and a week after that another at\r\n    Upper Merthyr. In the course of the summer the ravages of the disease\r\n    were enormous in the hilly mining regions of the interior of Glamorgan\r\n    and Monmouth, as well as severe in the seaports:\r\n\r\n        Merthyr Tydvil          1682\r\n        Cardiff                  396\r\n        Neath                    738\r\n        Swansea                  262\r\n        Abergavenny district     438\r\n        Pontypool                 69\r\n        Newport                  246\r\n\r\n    The peculiar selection of the mining townships was well shown in the\r\n    district of Abergavenny: of 378 deaths from cholera in the third\r\n    quarter of 1849, only 9 occurred in Abergavenny town, while 157 were\r\n    at the iron-works of Tredegar and 210 at those of Aberystruth, just\r\n    as, in the winter preceding, the villages of the iron-works all round\r\n    Kilmarnock had been ravaged by cholera while there was little of it in\r\n    that town itself.\r\n\r\nAnother chief centre of cholera in 1849 was the port of Hull. Including\r\nthe district of Sculcoates, it had the following enormous mortalities from\r\ncholera in four weeks of September: 398, 507, 524 and 171, the whole\r\nepidemic from July to the 18th of October producing 2534 deaths[1557]. Its\r\nneglect of scavenging became a classical instance of the favouring\r\nconditions of cholera. An open space at Witham called the “muckgarths,”\r\nfrom the refuse deposited upon it, was one of the worst centres, just as\r\nthe town moor of Sunderland, used for the same purpose, had been in\r\n1831[1558]. In the other ports, Liverpool, with West Derby, Bristol with\r\nClifton, and Plymouth with East Stonehouse and Devonport, the infection\r\nwas most severe (see Table), and was observed to choose the poorest\r\nstreets, lanes and houses, where there had been most typhus for a year or\r\ntwo before[1559]. On the Tyne, the greatest centre on this occasion was\r\nnot Newcastle, but Tynemouth. The city of Durham, which escaped the\r\ncholera of 1832, had a severe visitation. The chief inland centres,\r\nbesides the mining districts of Staffordshire and Glamorgan, were\r\nManchester and the cloth-making towns of Airedale,--Leeds, Hunslet,\r\nBradford, Dewsbury, and some others in the West Riding. Most of the\r\nLancashire towns occupied with the cotton industry again escaped with\r\nlittle cholera--Preston, Clitheroe, Oldham, Bury, Rochdale, Bolton,\r\nBlackburn, Ashton and Chorley. Wigan had nearly twenty times as many\r\ndeaths as in 1832; on the other hand Sheffield had only a quarter of its\r\nformer cholera mortality, while Nottingham and Norwich had this time very\r\nlittle. Birmingham, Leicester, Cheltenham, Hereford, Stafford, Ipswich,\r\nCambridge and Colchester were again almost or altogether free from\r\ninfection. The agricultural counties, notably the Eastern counties,\r\nescaped once more with few centres of infection, and these unimportant.\r\nCumberland as a whole had fewer deaths than in 1832, while Cockermouth had\r\nmore. Exeter, which was severely visited on the former occasion, escaped\r\nalmost wholly, while Totnes and Tavistock, with the surrounding Dartmoor\r\ncountry and other towns in Devon, had epidemics of the first degree for\r\ntheir size. In England as a whole the cholera of 1849 was more severe\r\nrelatively to the numbers living than that of 1832, its great centres\r\nhaving been the same, or of the same kind, on both occasions[1560].\r\n\r\nThe cholera of 1849 reproduced very closely the former characteristics.\r\nThe attacks were often in the night, especially in persons who had supped\r\nheartily on the coarser kinds of savoury meat. With the same undoubted\r\npreference for the poorer and more filthy quarters of towns, the infection\r\nshowed also a certain apparent caprice in fixing on some places and\r\navoiding others.\r\n\r\n    Thus at Leeds it was most malignant in the locality of York Street and\r\n    Marsh Lane (an old centre of plague and typhus), which had lately been\r\n    drained at a cost of some thousands of pounds, “whilst in the\r\n    adjoining district, which lies nearly level with the river, and will\r\n    scarcely admit of any sewerage, I have not heard,” writes the\r\n    registrar, “of a single case of cholera”--an experience similar to\r\n    that of a low-lying district of Bristol in 1832. At Liverpool, where\r\n    much had been undertaken for sanitation since the disastrous Irish\r\n    fever of 1847-48, the cholera appeared to Dr Duncan, the medical\r\n    officer of health, to attack sewered and unsewered streets\r\n    impartially. Another singular thing, which used to be noticed in the\r\n    plague and is observed in the malarial fevers of towns abroad, was the\r\n    choice of one side of a street only: thus, at Rotherhithe, in a street\r\n    where numerous deaths occurred, they were nearly all one side of the\r\n    street, in houses occupied by respectable private families, only one\r\n    house having been infected on the other side; at Bedford, two streets\r\n    showed the same thing.\r\n\r\nIn London, the least elevated parishes on both sides of the Thames were\r\nagain its chief seats. Dr Farr, the superintendent of statistics, deduced\r\nthe law that the death-rate from cholera in London was inversely as the\r\naltitude of the parish, and he showed, by a somewhat rough grouping of the\r\ncholera deaths, that the law applied to all England[1561]. An empirical\r\ngenerality such as that may have some value; but it is the exceptions to\r\nit that show the inward meaning of the fact.\r\n\r\n    Merthyr Tydvil, which was the worst cholera-spot in England with the\r\n    possible exception of Hull, was five hundred feet above the level of\r\n    Cardiff, its seaport, where the death-rate was much lower. Neath,\r\n    also, had much more cholera than Swansea. Newcastle-under-Lyme,\r\n    situated near the source of the Trent, and the highest town in the\r\n    course of that river, had a far more severe visitation of cholera than\r\n    any other town upon it all the way to its mouth. At Tavistock among\r\n    the Dartmoor hills, cholera “sat for many a week,” as Kingsley says,\r\n    “amid the dull brown haze, and sunburnt bents and dried-up\r\n    watercourses, of white dusty granite.” But the poorer and more\r\n    populous part of Tavistock was a somewhat peculiarly shut-in basin,\r\n    which was “very often involved in fog during the night.” The town had\r\n    escaped cholera in 1832, but one of its physicians, writing in 1841,\r\n    and recalling its dreadful plague of 1626, did not feel sure that it\r\n    would escape if cholera came back[1562]. Again, one thinks of\r\n    Salisbury as standing among high downs; but it had a wet subsoil, bad\r\n    sewerage, and bad water supply, and in 1849 it had 200 deaths from\r\n    cholera among all classes in two months[1563].\r\n\r\n    In the not very extensive outbreak at Sheffield, one of its chosen\r\n    seats was an elevated district called the Park, inhabited by colliers.\r\n    At Bedlington colliery, near Morpeth, the cholera deaths in November\r\n    were in the miners’ houses on the hill side. The elevated, airy and\r\n    clean village of Loanhead, near Edinburgh, had 46 deaths in its\r\n    population of 1200, during a few weeks of midwinter. In Dundee, built\r\n    upon a steep slope at the waterside, there were bad centres of cholera\r\n    in the higher parts as well as in the lower.\r\n\r\nThe determining thing appears to have been not so much the elevation as\r\nthe configuration of the ground; any basin, or cup, or shelving terrace,\r\nany natural collecting-ground of moisture and organic refuse in the soil,\r\nmay become a seat of cholera, whether it be at the sea-level or several\r\nhundred feet above it, provided it have a sufficient number of human\r\noccupants and a mode of drainage inadequate to its peculiar needs. Such\r\nwas the situation of Merthyr Tydvil, of Neath, of Newcastle-under-Lyme, of\r\nTavistock, of some colliery villages, and of certain localities in towns\r\nsuch as Dundee. Such, of course, was also the situation of the London\r\nparishes next the river on the south and east, of Hull, of Plymouth, of\r\nLiverpool, and of other seaports on estuaries. Neither altitude nor\r\nconfiguration means anything for cholera unless the ground itself be full\r\nof rotting filth. In all England and Scotland the cholera chose, as if by\r\nan unerring instinct, those not very extensive mining parts of the\r\ncounties of Stafford, Glamorgan, Durham, Lanark and Ayr, which had as many\r\nhundreds of inhabitants to the square mile, and as little provision for\r\nthe safe disposal of their excrements, as those village communities of\r\nLower Bengal in which the infection had become established since 1817 as\r\nif it were an annual product of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Board of Health brought to light many instances in which\r\nit seemed probable that cholera had been favoured, if not induced, by the\r\nwater of wells contaminated with organic filth soaking through the ground\r\nor entering with the surface water. This was especially the case at\r\nMerthyr Tydvil. It was during the next cholera, that of 1854, that the\r\nquestion of contaminated water came into great prominence, in connexion\r\nboth with wells and with the vast volumes of water supplied through the\r\nmains of water companies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cholera of 1853 at Newcastle and Gateshead.\r\n\r\nThe third visitation of Great Britain and Ireland by Asiatic Cholera was\r\nin 1853-54. There had been none of it in any part of the kingdom since\r\n1850; but it is not so clear that all other European countries, especially\r\nPoland, were equally free from it. Whether due to a new approach from\r\nAsia, or to a rekindling of smouldering fires, cholera appeared in the\r\nBaltic ports in the summer of 1853, and soon after reached the Tyne. For\r\nthe third time a severe but localized epidemic was the prelude--this time\r\nat Newcastle and Gateshead, just as in 1848 at Edinburgh, Glasgow and the\r\nsouth of Scotland, and in 1831 at Sunderland and Newcastle.\r\n\r\nIn the cholera of 1849, which was the most general and the most severe\r\nvisitation that England has had, Newcastle escaped with a light visitation\r\nand Gateshead with a moderate or average one, while Tynemouth (with North\r\nShields) had about twice as many deaths as Newcastle and Gateshead\r\ntogether (12·9 deaths per 1000 inhabitants). In 1853 it was the turn of\r\nNewcastle--for no better reason, perhaps, than its escape last time. The\r\nvery thorough and masterly inquiry by Messrs Simon, Bateman and Hume did,\r\nindeed, reveal a most unwholesome state of things; but the town was no\r\nworse or only a little worse than in 1849, when the cholera had dealt\r\nlightly with it, and it was probably an average sample of the insanitary\r\ncondition of the greater English industrial towns in the time of their\r\nrapid growth and before the period of well-ordered local government had\r\narrived. In some parts, such as Sandgate, the dwellings of the labouring\r\nclass were “not fit to live in”; in the newer mean suburbs, it was found,\r\nas in Glasgow twenty years before, that cellars had become the\r\ndwelling-places of a class who in former times lived above ground. Those\r\nwho had been dispossessed by the railways and other public structures had\r\nnot been provided for elsewhere; so that, with more trade and better\r\nwages, the working class were worse housed than before. Overcrowding, for\r\nwhich the ports on the Tyne and Wear are still pre-eminent, was then most\r\nexcessive. Only the better-class houses had the water laid on. Excremental\r\noffences to sight and smell were everywhere. There was a system of main\r\nsewers, passably good; but house-drainage or connexions with the main\r\ndrains were quite casual. The scavenging of the town was greatly\r\nneglected. Piggeries, slaughter-houses and other such nuisances, were\r\nuncontrolled. The burial-grounds were over-full. With all this the\r\ndeath-rate of Newcastle could be low enough in a good year, such as 1844,\r\nwhen it was 20·9 per 1000; in the year of the Irish fever, 1847, it rose\r\nto 32·8; and in other years it fluctuated between those extremes,\r\naccording to the nature of the seasons[1564].\r\n\r\nThe cholera of 1853 was a sudden explosion in the heavy stagnant\r\natmosphere of the month of September. No one knew where the infection came\r\nfrom; there were, of course, ships arriving from the Baltic, but no\r\nparticular source was ever traced. On the 30th or 31st of August, a case\r\noccurred of the rapidly fatal kind; before a week there were about a\r\nhundred attacks daily all over the town. From the 13th of September the\r\ndeaths in Newcastle mounted up rapidly as follows:\r\n\r\n               Cholera\r\n                deaths\r\n\r\n  Sept. 13         59\r\n        14         90\r\n        15        106\r\n        16        114\r\n        17        103\r\n        18        103\r\n        19        111\r\n        20         85\r\n        21         68\r\n        22         82\r\n        23         60\r\n        24         56\r\n\r\nIn the thirty days of September there were 1371 deaths, and some one or\r\ntwo hundreds more in the first part of October, when the infection ceased\r\nalmost abruptly, the total of deaths to the 4th of November having been\r\n1533. During the same time Gateshead with a population of 26,000, had 433\r\ndeaths, or in a ratio nearly equal to that of Newcastle. On the other hand\r\nTynemouth, with a population of 30,000, had only twelve deaths, several of\r\nthem in vagrants or other arrivals from Newcastle, the rest in a cluster\r\nof pitmen’s cottages on the outskirts of North Shields.\r\n\r\n    It was freely rumoured at the time, and was even repeated with much\r\n    unction in so dry and deliberate a work as the report of the\r\n    Registrar-General, that the cholera at Newcastle and Gateshead in\r\n    September, 1853, was owing to the sudden contamination of the town’s\r\n    water with sewage. The facts about the water-supply are as follows:\r\n    Previous to 1848, Newcastle was supplied with Tyne water pumped up at\r\n    Elswick, and passed through the settling tanks and filtering beds. In\r\n    1848 the Whittle Dean Water Company, incorporated in 1845, had their\r\n    new supply ready, and the old company, with its pumping station at\r\n    Elswick, was superseded. The new supply was collected from landward\r\n    sources, and was apt to be peaty. There was a great demand upon it,\r\n    especially for public works (it was supplied to comparatively few\r\n    houses), so that the distribution in 1853 had increased 2½ times since\r\n    the company began in 1848. They had extended their collecting area to\r\n    meet this demand; but, owing probably to the drought, they found it\r\n    necessary on the 6th of July, 1853, to resort to the old\r\n    pumping-station at Elswick for about a third part of all the water\r\n    that flowed daily through the mains. This had gone on for eight weeks\r\n    before the epidemic began, and was promptly discontinued on 15\r\n    September, as soon as the possible danger from Tyne water was\r\n    realized. The pumping-station was higher up the river than the only\r\n    one of the Newcastle sewers that discharged in its vicinity. There\r\n    were complaints about the water, but these appear to have been chiefly\r\n    of the peaty colour or flavour, which came from the Whittle Dean part\r\n    of the mixture. The water from the mains was not equally bad at all\r\n    points, as if the suspected contamination might have occurred in its\r\n    transit through the town. Also the water of some wells was complained\r\n    of as offensive at the same time, which was the season of the year\r\n    when the springs are lowest. Gateshead was also supplied by the mains\r\n    of the Whittle Dean Company. It is clear from the report of the\r\n    Commissioners that they considered the water of Newcastle and\r\n    Gateshead to have been a very subordinate factor, if a factor at all,\r\n    in the epidemic of cholera.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cholera of 1854 in England.\r\n\r\nThe great epidemic at Newcastle and Gateshead was over by November, 1853,\r\nthose towns having no share in the general epidemic in England in 1854,\r\nalthough it visited their near neighbour Tynemouth. The interest of the\r\ncholera of 1854 centres chiefly in London[1565]. Few of the great foci of\r\ninfection in 1849 were visited severely. Liverpool, which never escaped,\r\nhad a moderate epidemic, Merthyr Tydvil also had about a fourth part of\r\nits 1849 mortality, Dudley had the disease somewhat severely, while some\r\ntowns, such as Norwich, Wisbech and Sheffield, had more than usual. But\r\nPlymouth, Hull, Bristol, Manchester, Leeds, the towns of the Black Country\r\nand nearly all the populous places that had suffered heavily either in\r\n1832 or in 1849, or on both occasions, escaped in 1854 with little cholera\r\nor none[1566]. The table shows the incidence of the epidemic (as well as\r\nthat of 1866) according to counties.\r\n\r\n_Cholera Mortality in England and Wales in 1854 and 1866._\r\n\r\n                          1854            1866\r\n                             Rate            Rate\r\n                             per             per\r\n                     Deaths  1000    Deaths  1000\r\n\r\n  England and Wales  20097            14378\r\n  -----------------------------------------------\r\n  London             10738    4·3      5596   1·9\r\n  Surrey, part of      252    1·2        82\r\n  Kent, part of       1056    2·1       284\r\n  Sussex                94     ·3        79\r\n  Hampshire            130     ·3       417    ·9\r\n  Berkshire             49     ·2         3\r\n  Middlesex, part of   380    2·4        51\r\n  Hertfordshire         97     ·5         9\r\n  Buckinghamshire       68     ·5        10\r\n  Oxfordshire          183    1·0         4\r\n  Northamptonshire     152     ·7         7\r\n  Huntingdonshire       18     ·3         1\r\n  Bedfordshire          61     ·4        22\r\n  Cambridgeshire       270    1·3         7\r\n  Essex                513    1·4       471   1·0\r\n  Suffolk               67     ·2        15\r\n  Norfolk              381     ·8        15\r\n  Wiltshire             60     ·2        11\r\n  Dorset                45     ·2         6\r\n  Devon                188     ·3       525    ·9\r\n  Cornwall              24    ·06        21\r\n  Somerset              21    ·04        68\r\n  Gloucestershire      260     ·6        39\r\n  Herefordshire          1    ·01         2\r\n  Shropshire            13    ·05        17\r\n  Staffordshire        426     ·6        30\r\n  Worcestershire       103     ·4        36\r\n  Warwickshire          89     ·2        15\r\n  Leicestershire        14    ·06         3\r\n  Rutlandshire           9    ·08        --\r\n  Lincolnshire         134     ·3        48\r\n  Nottinghamshire       80     ·3        1\r\n  Derbyshire            17    ·06        20\r\n  Cheshire             141     ·3       391\r\n  Lancashire          1775     ·8      2600   1·0\r\n  West Riding          470     ·3       283\r\n  East Riding           70     ·3        54\r\n  North Riding          84     ·4        21\r\n  Durham[1567]                2·9       352    ·6\r\n  Northumberland[1568]        5·7       224\r\n  Cumberland            35     ·2        32\r\n  Westmoreland           1    ·02         1\r\n  Monmouth              18     ·1       204\r\n  South Wales          887    1·4      2033   2·9\r\n  North Wales           34    ·08       256\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Principal centres in each county\r\n                           1854                            1866\r\n\r\n  England and Wales\r\n\r\n  London              South of Thames, Eastern    Eastern parishes 3691\r\n                        parishes\r\n  Surrey, part of\r\n  Kent, part of\r\n  Sussex\r\n  Hampshire           Portsea Island 20,          Portsea Island 129,\r\n                        Southampton 48              Southampton 41\r\n  Berkshire\r\n  Middlesex, part of  Brentford 196\r\n  Hertfordshire\r\n  Buckinghamshire\r\n  Oxfordshire\r\n  Northamptonshire    Towcester 86\r\n  Huntingdonshire\r\n  Bedfordshire\r\n  Cambridgeshire      Wisbech 176, Ely 46\r\n  Essex               West Ham 124, Romford       West Ham 389\r\n                        113, Maldon 102\r\n  Suffolk\r\n  Norfolk             Norwich 193, Yarmouth 41\r\n  Wiltshire\r\n  Dorset\r\n  Devon               Plymouth 59, Stonehouse     Exeter and St Thomas 247,\r\n                        15, Devonport 2,            Newton Abbot 57,\r\n                        Bideford 46                 Totnes 146\r\n  Cornwall\r\n  Somerset\r\n  Gloucestershire     Bristol 76, Clifton 92,\r\n                        Gloucester 48\r\n  Herefordshire\r\n  Shropshire\r\n  Staffordshire       Dudley 256,\r\n                        Wolverhampton 80\r\n\r\n  Worcestershire      Worcester 45\r\n  Warwickshire\r\n  Leicestershire\r\n  Rutlandshire\r\n  Lincolnshire        Great Grimsby 68\r\n  Nottinghamshire     Worksop 27,\r\n                        Nottingham 16\r\n  Derbyshire\r\n  Cheshire                                        Chester\r\n  Lancashire          Liverpool 1084, W.

But it fell somewhat unequally upon these; and for Southwark and\r\nLambeth the water supply was seized upon as the thing that made the\r\ndifference. There were two water companies in South London, the Lambeth\r\ncompany and the Southwark and Vauxhall company. The parish of Christ\r\nChurch, Lambeth, chiefly supplied by the Lambeth company, had a death-rate\r\nfrom cholera in 1854 of only 0·43 per 1000 inhabitants; whereas the parish\r\nof St Saviour, supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall company, had a\r\ndeath-rate of 2·27 per 1000. In 1849 there had been no such disparity\r\nbetween them, the death-rate of Christ Church being if anything the higher\r\nof the two. Now it happened that in the interval of the two epidemics of\r\ncholera the Lambeth company had removed their intake works from opposite\r\nHungerford Market to Thames Ditton, whilst the Southwark and Vauxhall\r\ncompany still continued to draw their supply from the Thames near\r\nVauxhall. Here was a fine instance of the logical method of difference.\r\nFarther, within the parish of Christ Church itself, it was sought to show\r\nthat the cholera followed the lines of old water supplies, and did not\r\nfollow the mains from Thames Ditton. After 1854 the Southwark and Vauxhall\r\ncompany also made their intake at Thames Ditton. According to the\r\nwater-hypothesis of cholera, it is not surprising, as we shall duly find,\r\nthat the whole of the South London parishes, which had been the chief\r\nseats of the cholera in 1832, 1849, and 1854, escaped in 1866 with a very\r\nslight visitation. Newcastle was another chosen instance of cholera\r\ndistributed by the water mains; but, as we have seen, that was improbable.\r\nAnother instance was Exeter: its water supply in 1832, when part of it had\r\na disastrous epidemic of cholera, was taken from the Exe, and was impure;\r\nin 1849, when it had only a tenth part of its last cholera mortality, its\r\nwater supply had been greatly improved; in 1854 it had 10 deaths; but in\r\n1866, Exeter with the registration district of St Thomas had 247 deaths,\r\nand Totnes had 146,--for their size about the most severely visited towns\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nIn the London cholera of 1854 a very sudden and simultaneous explosion in\r\nthe district of Soho attracted much notice[1569]. The district stands\r\nhigh, which did not save it from being the scene of the first outbreak in\r\nthe great plague of 1665. In the subdistricts of St Anne, Golden Square\r\nand Berwick Street, with a population of 42,000, many of them well-to-do\r\nfamilies, there were 537 deaths from cholera, a rate of 12·8 per 1000,\r\ncontrasting with the rate of 6 per 1000 for all London. The attacks and\r\nfatalities were remarkably numerous for one or two days, falling at once\r\nthereafter to about a half. There was a pump in Broad Street, in the\r\ncentre of this district, which was supposed to have dispersed cholera\r\nbroadcast in its contaminated water; a death had occurred in Swain’s Lane,\r\nat the foot of Highgate Hill, of a person who had drank the water of the\r\nBroad Street pump. The whole incident was seized upon and worked up by Dr\r\nSnow, who had written a speculative essay in 1849 upon the probability of\r\ncholera being conveyed by water, according to the similar theory of Parkin\r\nin 1832[1570]. The Board of Health, having very full data before them of\r\nthe Soho outbreak in all its aspects (including a whole biological\r\ntreatise upon the organisms found in water), did not adopt Snow’s\r\nconclusion, although he had enthusiastic followers at the time, and has\r\nprobably more now[1571]:\r\n\r\n    “In explanation of the remarkable intensity of this outbreak within\r\n    very definite limits, it has been suggested by Dr Snow that the real\r\n    cause of whatever was peculiar in the case lay in the general use of\r\n    one particular well, situate at Broad Street in the middle of the\r\n    district, and having (it was imagined) its waters contaminated by the\r\n    rice-water evacuations of cholera patients. After careful inquiry we\r\n    see no reason to adopt this belief. We do not find it established that\r\n    the water was contaminated in the manner alleged; nor is there before\r\n    us any sufficient evidence to show whether inhabitants of the\r\n    district, drinking from that well, suffered in proportion more than\r\n    other inhabitants of the district who drank from other sources.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cholera of 1853-54 in Scotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe cholera of 1853-54 in Scotland has not been so fully recorded as\r\neither of the two preceding epidemics. It is said to have caused about six\r\nthousand deaths, of which 3892 were in Glasgow alone, and a considerable\r\npart of the remainder in Edinburgh and Dundee. The infection began to\r\nappear in the end of September, having been derived probably from the\r\ndreadful explosion at Newcastle. A few early cases occurred at Dunse, in\r\nBerwickshire. On the 16th September, 1853, the old Cholera Hospital at\r\nEdinburgh, in Surgeons’ Square, was opened, but received only 45 cases\r\nuntil the beginning of June, 1854, when it was closed. In the autumn of\r\n1854 the real epidemic began, the hospital being re-opened on 24th August,\r\nfrom which date until the 30th November the admissions were 198. These\r\nhospital figures indicate for Edinburgh a milder epidemic than that of the\r\nwinter of 1848, which was itself milder than that of 1832. The cases came\r\nmostly from the very same localities of the old town as in 1848. There\r\nwere 145 females to 97 males; the deaths were 117 in 243 cases\r\nadmitted[1572].\r\n\r\nThe epidemic at Dundee was a late autumnal or winter one, in the end of\r\n1853, and of great severity, the mortality having probably exceeded 500.\r\nThe Glasgow epidemic had a course very nearly parallel to that of 1832,\r\nand quite unlike the extraordinary winter explosion of 1848-9. It began,\r\nindeed, in winter--about the 15th of December, 1853, and had caused 849\r\ndeaths to the 27th of February; there was a sharp rise of the mortality\r\nfrom the 13th to the 24th of March, the total deaths to that date being\r\n1306. As in 1832, the infection appeared to die out in the late spring and\r\nearly summer; but in June it revived and increased in virulence until\r\nAugust, after which it subsided gradually until November, the whole\r\nmortality having been 3892, or ·98 per cent. of the population, nearly the\r\nsame ratio as in 1848-9, (1·06) and a lower ratio than in 1832 (1·4). The\r\nfirst part of the epidemic fell chiefly on the north and east of the city,\r\nthe second part, in summer and autumn, was all over the city, as in 1832,\r\nand among all classes, as in the winter of 1848-49, but perhaps less\r\ndisastrously in the best quarters of the city than the last had been. The\r\ncholera hospital received a comparatively small part of all the cases--600\r\nof cholera, 253 of diarrhoea, the deaths being 306, or less than a tenth\r\npart of the whole mortality[1573].\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the mortalities in Scotland on this occasion, besides\r\nthose in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee, were neither so general nor so\r\ngreat as in 1832. One remarkable outbreak happened at the village of\r\nSymington, in Ayrshire: in a population of 240 there were 110 attacks and\r\n30 deaths; nearly all the cases were in houses on one side of the village\r\nstreet, which got their water from a public well; the houses on the other\r\nside, having private wells (and differing, doubtless, in other respects),\r\nwere notably free from the infection[1574].\r\n\r\nThe cholera of 1854 was unimportant in Ireland. Cases appeared among\r\nemigrants on board ships in Belfast Lough and at Queenstown in the end of\r\n1853, but no diffusion took place until 1854, and then only to a moderate\r\nextent. It is supposed that some 1706 persons died of it in Ireland in\r\nthat year, according to the retrospective figures of the census of 1861;\r\nbut a good many deaths from “cholera” were returned for every year of the\r\ndecennium, so that it is improbable that the whole 1706 in 1854 were of\r\nthe true Asiatic type. Ulster had 895 of these, Leinster 453, Munster 324,\r\nand the whole of Connaught only 34[1575].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cholera of 1865-66.\r\n\r\nAsiatic cholera reached Europe by a new route in 1865--by the way of Egypt\r\nwith the pilgrims returning from the Hâj at Mecca. In the course of the\r\nautumn it appeared at Southampton and caused 35 deaths from 24 September\r\nto 4 November. A strange extension from Southampton (or from Weymouth)\r\ntook place to the village of Theydon Bois in Epping Forest, where nine\r\ndeaths were traced to one house from 28 September to 31 October, unhappily\r\nincluding the death of a most estimable medical gentleman who tasted the\r\nwater of a well into which the evacuations of the sick had probably\r\npercolated.\r\n\r\nThe cholera having become established on the continent of Europe in the\r\nend of 1865, was brought into England by emigrants passing from Hull and\r\nGrimsby to Liverpool on their way to America. On board one of the emigrant\r\nsteamships, the ‘England,’ a very severe epidemic arose in mid-Atlantic in\r\nApril. Liverpool had once more a severe epidemic (2122 deaths); but the\r\nonly other important centres in England, besides London, were Swansea,\r\nNeath, Llanelly and Merthyr Tydvil, Chester and Northwich, a group of\r\ntowns on the Exe in Devonshire, and Portsmouth with other places in\r\nHampshire. Still, the deaths in all England made the large total of\r\n14,378, no county excepting Rutland being absolutely free. That means that\r\nthe infection, although widely diffused, now wanted the conditions\r\nfavourable to its development and effectiveness; and that, again, seems to\r\nmean that a vast improvement had been made in the sewering of towns, in\r\nscavenging, and in all other matters of municipal police by which the soil\r\nof inhabited spots is preserved from saturation with excremental and other\r\nfilth.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the cholera of 1866 centres in London, and chiefly in the\r\nfact that three-fourths of the deaths, to the number of 3696, took place\r\nin the eastern parishes, Whitechapel, Bethnal Green, Poplar, Stepney, Mile\r\nEnd, St George’s in the East, and Greenwich. These had in former epidemics\r\na fair share; but hitherto they had been surpassed by the Southwark\r\nparishes and others on the south of the Thames from Battersea to\r\nRotherhithe, and nearly equalled by Shoreditch and the Liberties of the\r\nCity. The comparative table of the four great choleras of London shows how\r\nremarkably the infection in 1866 had left its old principal seats,\r\nremaining, as if a residue, only in the East End, with death-rates\r\ncomparable to those of 1849.\r\n\r\n_Comparative view of the Four Epidemics of Cholera in the several parishes\r\nof London_[1576].\r\n\r\n                            1832          1849          1854         1866\r\n                                                (17 wks. end. 4 Nov.)\r\n\r\n                         Rate         Rate         Rate         Rate\r\n                         per  Deaths   per  Deaths  per  Deaths  per Deaths\r\n                       10,000       10,000        10,000       10,000\r\n\r\n  Kensington               10    52      24   260    35   490    3·7   85\r\n  Chelsea                  80   272      46   247    47   300    3·3   22\r\n  St George, Hanover Sq.   10    74      18   131    38   295    1·7   18\r\n  Westminster              50   450      68   437    60   423    6·2   43\r\n  St Martin in the Fields  --    --      37    91    24    58    4·2   10\r\n  St James, Westminster    --    --      16    57   152   485    3·5   13\r\n  Marylebone               30   355      17   261    16   347    3·0   54\r\n  Hampstead                --    --       8     9    11    14     ·8    2\r\n  Pancras                  20   230      22   360    13   248    6·0  138\r\n  Islington                10    39      22   187     8    97    4·3  120\r\n  Hackney                   2     8      25   139    11    73   10·6  103\r\n  St Giles                 50   280      53   285    21   115    9·2   49\r\n  Strand                    1    26      35   156    24   111    6·6   29\r\n  Holborn                  10    46      35   161     5    25    5·2   22\r\n  Clerkenwell              10    65      19   121     9    59    7·0   45\r\n  St Luke                  30   118      34   183     9    52    8·1   46\r\n  East City              }               45   182    23    85   15·7   59\r\n  West City              } 50   605      96   429    10   126   18·8   60\r\n  City                   }               38   207    14    71    5·0   20\r\n  Shoreditch               10    57      76   789    20   237   10·7  139\r\n  Bethnal Green            50   345      90   789    20   192   60·4  611\r\n  Whitechapel             110   736      64   506    40   330   84·2  909\r\n  St George in the East    30   123      42   199    30   154   87·9  385\r\n  Stepney                  50   358      47   501    32   388  107·6  559\r\n  Mile End Old Town        --    --      --    --    --    --   67·7  501\r\n  Poplar                   40   101      71   313    38   208   90·8  837\r\n  St Saviour            } 120  1128     153   539   134   495    7·4   32\r\n  St Olave              }               181   349   162   315    8·5   21\r\n  Bermondsey               70   210     161   734   158   845    5·3   35\r\n  St George, Southwark     --    --     164   836   101   546    6·6   38\r\n  Newington                40   200     144   907   101   696    2·8   26\r\n  Lambeth                  40   337     120  1618    63   941    6·5  114\r\n  Wandsworth               10    46     100   484    77   422    4·8   40\r\n  Camberwell               30   107      97   504    91   553    5·6   46\r\n  Rotherhithe              10    19     205   352   147   285    8·7   25\r\n  Greenwich                20   149      75   718    53   576   19·5  284\r\n  Lewisham                 --    --      30    96    20    81    6·1   56\r\n  Stratford                --    --      --    --    --    --    77·6  --\r\n  West Ham                 --    --      --    --    --    --    49·3  --\r\n  Leyton                   --    --      --    --    --    --    13·1  --\r\n\r\nThere was one significant thing associated with the peculiar incidence of\r\nthe cholera of 1866 upon the East End. The main drainage of London,\r\nconsisting of a high level and a low level sewer on each side of the\r\nThames, was commenced in 1859, and was formally opened on 4 April, 1865.\r\nThe two levels on each side of the river made together a length of\r\neighty-two miles; the cost, with pumping station, was £4,200,000. When the\r\ncholera of 1866 broke out, only one part of the system was incomplete and\r\nnot yet in working, namely, the low level main drainage on the northern\r\nside, which served the whole of the cholera-stricken parishes from Aldgate\r\nto Bow. However, the official mind in this country has somehow become\r\nprejudiced against the well-known and usually accepted generalities of von\r\nPettenkofer, which make more of a foul soil in the causation of miasmatic\r\ninfections, than of contaminated surface water or contaminated water from\r\nreservoirs. Accordingly, the somewhat remarkable fact that the East End of\r\nLondon alone retained its old proclivity for choleraic infection was not\r\njoined to the fact of its being the only great division of the capital\r\nstill unsewered, but to the fact that it was supplied by water taken in\r\nfrom the river Lea in Hertfordshire and (it was alleged) insufficiently\r\nfiltered or otherwise purified at the Old Ford waterworks[1577].\r\n\r\nThe extension to Scotland in 1866 was late in the season and insignificant\r\ncompared with former epidemics. It was heard of about the end of summer in\r\nFraserburgh and one or two other ports or fishing places on the East\r\nCoast, but it was not until October and November that it attracted notice\r\nin the eight principal towns, the whole mortality from it in Glasgow being\r\n53, in Edinburgh 154, in Dundee 105, in Aberdeen 62, in Paisley 2, in\r\nGreenock 14, in Leith 95, and in Perth 15. Besides these deaths there were\r\n435 more in smaller towns or villages. The year was a very healthy one,\r\nthe death-rates of Glasgow, Greenock and Perth having been below the mean\r\nof the previous ten years.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the cholera of 1866 was even slighter than in Scotland, the\r\nonly considerable epidemic having been at Belfast.\r\n\r\nCholera has never obtained a footing in London since the epidemic of 1866.\r\nIn 1873, while the disease was unusually active in some parts of Europe, a\r\nfew cases occurred in Wapping among Scandinavian emigrants on their way to\r\nAmerica, who had been landed for a few days. But the infection did not\r\nspread. In 1884, when cholera came from Cochin China to Toulon and\r\nMarseilles, two or three cases occurred on board steamships arriving at\r\nCardiff and Liverpool. In 1893, when the disease raged in Hamburg, a\r\nnumber of choleraic cases occurred at Grimsby in August, which were\r\nconsidered certainly Asiatic owing to their high degree of fatality. In\r\nAugust-October, the deaths from cholera, whether cholera nostras or the\r\nAsiatic type, or both together, were about thirty in Grimsby, eighteen in\r\nHull, and about fifty more in various other places, chiefly in the south\r\nof Yorkshire. The autumn of that year was favourable to bowel-complaints\r\nand to enteric fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Antecedents of Epidemic Cholera in India.\r\n\r\nThe antecedents and circumstances that made the year 1817 so critical for\r\ncholera in India, and for its diffusiveness far beyond India, constitute\r\none of the greatest problems in epidemiology. A full and minute\r\nexamination of them cannot be attempted here; but the chapter would be\r\nincomplete without some statement on the subject, which, if summary, need\r\nnot be dogmatic. Cholera with the same symptoms and a similar degree of\r\nfatality was certainly not new to India about the year 1817; it can be\r\ntraced from the earliest records of the Portuguese and other Europeans in\r\nIndia, if not also in other countries in ancient times[1578]. The\r\nmortalities among troops during the military operations in the Northern\r\nCircars in 1781 and 1790, and the deaths of some 20,000 pilgrims in eight\r\ndays during the Hurdwar festival of 1783, were undoubtedly from the same\r\nepidemic infective cholera that was seen fifty years after in Europe. But\r\nthese were occasional great explosions, which arose suddenly and ceased\r\nabruptly; whereas from about 1817 onwards the infection became, as it\r\nwere, a seasonal product of the soil of Lower Bengal year after year, and\r\nat the same time began to range widely beyond its “endemic area” to other\r\nprovinces of India, beyond the North-Western frontier to Central Asia and\r\nto Europe, and across the ocean to America. It was not by any sudden\r\nchange in the year 1817, we may be sure, that cholera began to be endemic\r\nat various places far apart in the valley of the Ganges. Things must have\r\nbeen tending towards that manifestation for some time before, and those\r\nthings must have been of the same kind that made the great explosion at\r\nHurdwar in 1783 and have made many other great explosions at the Indian\r\nreligious festivals in later times. Briefly the opinion may be hazarded,\r\nthat it was the permeation with excremental matters of the soil at large\r\nin and around Bengali villages that gave rise to the endemic miasmatic\r\ninfection of cholera. The _odor stercoreus_ of those innumerable village\r\ncommunities is, or used to be, a familiar fact, just as it is well known\r\nto be the custom there to dispense with latrines or other systematic\r\nprovision for the disposal of faecal matters. But it may seem improbable\r\nthat personal habits of the peasantry, not unknown in other countries, and\r\nimmemorial in Lower Bengal itself, should have led to a definite\r\ndisease-effect in a certain year of the 19th century and perennially\r\nthereafter. As to the special risk of engendering such a soil-poison in\r\nthe valley of the Ganges, it has to be said that the region is peculiar in\r\nits alternations from extreme saturation to extreme dryness, within a\r\nstratum of alluvial or other porous soil which has a bed of impervious\r\nblue clay beneath it at a depth seldom more than 10 feet. It is just where\r\nsuch extreme fluctuations of the ground-water within a limited range occur\r\nfrom season to season, that organic matters in the soil are most apt to\r\ndevelop a miasmatic infective property. But why should the year 1817 have\r\nbeen, by the general consent of Anglo-Indian observers, the beginning of a\r\nnew era in the history of cholera? The guiding principle in all such cases\r\nis, that things must have been moving that way before, and that in the\r\nparticular season there had been reached at length such a degree of\r\naggravation as to make a specific result manifest or the cumulative causes\r\neffective. Two things may be indicated as relevant to this assumed\r\naggravation, or integration of accumulating causes. One was a certain\r\ngradual change in the beds of rivers, especially in the province of Behar,\r\nwhich entirely altered the relative amount of water flowing above ground\r\nand under ground, and must have made a difference in kind and in degree to\r\nthe decomposition-processes in the soil. (In Burdwan these changes in the\r\nground-water have caused much miasmatic fever since about thirty years\r\nago.) The other thing was the increase of the number of cultivators per\r\nsquare mile under British rule. The latter cannot be stated with even\r\napproximate exactness for periods before the census of 1872; but there can\r\nbe no reasonable doubt that the increase was great and progressive from\r\nthe end of last century, owing to the cessation of intertribal wars, and\r\nof famines which were chiefly caused by the overflow of rivers now no\r\nlonger subject to floods, and of wilful and barbarous checks to\r\npopulation. Among the cholera localities of 1817 were some that have now\r\nthe greatest pressure of inhabitants on the soil, not in cities, but in\r\nuniformly dispersed rural communities--such as the division of Patna with\r\n637 inhabitants per square mile, the district of Jessore with 693, and of\r\nDacca with 756. This is of course a very general account of the matter,\r\nwhich a minute study of localities and seasons might show to be highly\r\ninadequate; but in seeking for some circumstances of aggravation at the\r\nparticular juncture, the two things that have been mentioned, both of them\r\ncoincident historical matters of fact, will appear to be not irrelevant\r\naccording to the received teaching on the favouring conditions of\r\ncholera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ON CEREBRO-SPINAL FEVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish experience, or the records of it, afford so little material for\r\nthe history of epidemic cerebro-spinal fever (very abundant for France,\r\nGermany and the United States of America, see Hirsch, III. 547) that it\r\nhas not seemed desirable to interpolate the subject in the chapter on\r\nTyphus and other Continued Fevers. Although our experience of it has\r\nfallen perhaps wholly within the period of exact statistics of the causes\r\nof death (saving some doubtful identifications in the 18th century), yet\r\nthe registration tables contain so few deaths from it that it hardly seems\r\nas if a new and remarkable type of fever of the typhus kind had really\r\nbeen in our midst. There are, however, two periods when a good many papers\r\nwere written upon it in Ireland and England, the years 1865-67 and the\r\nyear 1876. When the first cases were seen in London in 1865 Murchison\r\npronounced the new fever to be closely allied to typhus (_Lancet_, 1865,\r\np. 1417). At the same time in Ireland it was sometimes called “the black\r\ndeath,” from the dark or livid vibices of the skin, or purpura maligna, or\r\npurpuric fever (J. T. Banks, _Dubl. Quart. Journ. Med. Sc._ XLIII. 98; E.\r\nW. Collins, _ibid._ XLVI. 170; Cogan, _ibid._ XLIV. 172; Gordon, _ibid._\r\nXLIV. 408; H. Wilson, _ibid._ XLIII.; Haverty, _ibid._; T. W. Belcher,\r\n_Med. Press_, N. S. III. 167; J. H. Benson, _ibid._ III. 387; editor,\r\n_ibid._ 506. For England, S. Wilks, _Lancet_, 1865, I. 388, _Brit. Med.\r\nJourn._ 1868, I. 427; F. J. Brown, _Trans. Epid. Soc._ II. (1865), 391; J.\r\nN. Radcliffe in Reynolds’ _System of Medicine_, 1st ed. II. 676; H. Day,\r\n_Lancet_, 1867, I. 731). In the second period, 1876, there were many cases\r\nin England, especially in the Midlands, but it is said that they were\r\nusually diagnosed as typhoid fever (Sir Walter Foster, _Brit. Med. Journ._\r\n1892, II. 278, and _Lancet_, 1876, I. 849; Neville Hart (for Birmingham),\r\n_St Barth. Hosp. Rep._ XII. (1876), 105; H. Thompson, _Lancet_, 1876, I.\r\n849. The Irish papers in the second period are by T. W. Grimshaw, _Dub.\r\nJourn. Med. Sc._ LXI. 520, and LVII. 375; E. H. Bennett, _ibid._ LIX.;\r\nBrabazon, _Brit. Med. Journ._ 1876, I. 509). An epidemic of cerebro-spinal\r\nfever, resembling typhoid, was described for a Shropshire village in May,\r\n1891 (Monk, _Brit. Med. Journ._ 1892, II. 278). A case which came under my\r\nnotice on 19 March, 1894, in an eastern parish of London, has led me to\r\ndoubt whether the half-dozen or so of deaths annually certified in London\r\nas from cerebro-spinal fever (contrasting with as many hundreds in New\r\nYork), are of the slightest statistical value.\r\n\r\nA young woman, aged 16, an artificial flower maker, became ill with pains\r\nin the limbs and was taken as an out-patient to a hospital. Thereafter she\r\nbecame light-headed. A private practitioner (M.R.C.S.) was called in, who\r\nfound her with a temperature of 103°, excited, and inclined to clutch\r\nspasmodically at his arms; her coarse black hair was full of pediculi and\r\nnits. She died next day, having had sent her by the practitioner a draught\r\nof chlorodyne on account of her extreme restlessness. An inquest was\r\nappointed, and the practitioner ordered to make a post-mortem examination.\r\nHe attended the inquest and gave evidence that death was due to\r\n“congestion of the brain.” The jury were dissatisfied, and the coroner\r\nadjourned the inquest for a second examination by a skilled pathologist.\r\nAfter spending two hours looking for the cause of death (there was no\r\ncongestion of the brain), I discovered that the base of the brain had been\r\nleft in the skull intact, the hemispheres having been sliced off by a\r\nhorizontal section in the plane of the saw-draught round the cranium. On\r\nraising the frontal lobes I saw green flaky lymph lying on the orbital\r\nplates and on the corresponding surfaces of the arachnoid; the same was\r\nfound on the optic commissure, the surface of the pons, the medulla and\r\nover a small area of the under convexities of the lateral lobes of the\r\ncerebellum, where it amounted to little more than whitish opacity. The\r\nlymph was purely basal, solely on the arachnoid, not in the fissures or\r\nsulci. The examination having already lasted over two hours, it was found\r\nimpracticable to expose the spinal cord. The facts previously found were:\r\nan extensive blood-shot state of the left conjunctiva with oedema of the\r\nupper lid (there was no obvious intra-orbital disease); round dusky-red\r\nspots on the outer sides of the thighs and on the shoulders; both lungs in\r\na state of solid purple congestion at the bases, crepitant at the apices,\r\nthe costal pleura dark red or livid; the tongue large and flabby,\r\ncongested around the broad papillae; the stomach at the cardiac end,\r\nexactly corresponding to the pressure of a mass of hard undigested food,\r\ndotted with numerous small round ecchymoses under the serosa; six inches\r\nof the lower end of the jejunum, corresponding to a mass of hard impacted\r\nfaeces, dotted with the same subserous ecchymoses; a narrow belt of deep\r\ncongestion round the broad ends of the kidney pyramids; the mucosa of the\r\nfundus uteri haemorrhagic. There was no herpetic eruption. At the\r\nadjourned inquest the cause of death was found to be cerebro-spinal fever,\r\nand was so certified by the coroner to the Registrar-General. The\r\npractitioner who attended the deceased was unable to say whether the most\r\ndistinctive of all the symptoms, the violent retraction of the occiput\r\nupon the shoulders, was present or absent. It is improbable that this was\r\na solitary case of epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis in the East End of\r\nLondon in the spring of 1894, (the early spring being the distinctive\r\nseason of the infection). Even if it were the only case, it narrowly\r\nmissed being returned as a death from “congestion of the brain,” and that,\r\ntoo, after post-mortem inquisition. The practitioner’s statutory fees were\r\nthree guineas. There has lately been collected much evidence upon\r\ncertificates of death, and upon diagnosis under the Notification Act,\r\nwhich makes it doubtful whether our mortality statistics are as correct in\r\nsubstance as they are methodical and exhaustive in form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aberdeen, famine of 1622, 30,\r\n    relapsing fever of 1818, 175,\r\n    typhus of 1838-40, 189, 192,\r\n    relapsing of 1843, 204,\r\n    ratio of enteric in 1864, 210,\r\n    influenza of 1831, 379 _note_,\r\n    smallpox in 1610, 434,\r\n    measles of 1808, 651-2,\r\n    putrid sore-throat in 1790, 718,\r\n    dysentery near, 784,\r\n    cholera in 1832, 815\r\n\r\n  Aberystruth, cholera in 1849, 845\r\n\r\n  Ackworth bill of mortality, 528 _note_\r\n\r\n  Acland, Sir H.

There hardly ever appeared a fever in any season\r\nwhere the signs so constantly answered one another, that those which you\r\nfound collected in one person should unite after the same manner in\r\nanother; however upon this account you would not deny their labouring\r\nunder the same distemper.”\r\n\r\n[39] _Tractatus de Podagra_, § 35.

In an\r\nhydropsical body, ten years buried in the churchyard, we met with a fat\r\nconcretion [adipocere] where the nitre of the earth and the salt and\r\nlixivious liquor of the body had coagulated large lumps of fat into the\r\nconsistence of the hardest Castille soap, whereof part remaineth with us.\r\nThe body of the Marquis of Dorset seemed sound and handsomely cereclothed,\r\nthat after seventy-eight years was found uncorrupted. Common tombs\r\npreserve not beyond powder: a firmer consistence and compage of parts\r\nmight be expected from arefaction, deep burial, or charcoal.”\r\n\r\n[62] One may allege poverty on general grounds, as well as on particular.\r\nThus, in 1636, the mayor was unpopular: “He was a stout man and had not\r\nthe love of the commons. He was cruel, and not pitying the poor, he caused\r\nmany dunghills to be carried away; but the cost was on the poor--it being\r\nso hard times might well have been spared.” Ormerod, I. 203.\r\n\r\n[63] Printed plague-bill, with MS. additions, Harl.

In Duthil and Rothimurchus, Invernessshire,\r\nthe famine is referred to 1680, “as nearly as can be recollected:” “A\r\nfamine in this and the neighbouring counties, of the most fatal\r\nconsequence. The poorer sort of people frequented the churchyard to pull a\r\nmess of nettles, and frequently struggled about the prey, being the\r\nearliest spring greens....

A\r\nletter of 18 April, 1701, from Chilcote, in Derbyshire, says that it has\r\nbeen a sickly time in these parts and that a certain lady and her daughter\r\nwere both dead and to be buried the same day.

I begged Mr Harley [the Lord President] for the love of God to\r\ntake some care about it, or we are all ruined. There have been orders for\r\nall ships from the Baltic to pass their quarantine before they land; but\r\nthey neglect it. You remember I have been afraid these two years.” The\r\norders referred to were probably the Order of Council of 9 Nov. 1710.\r\nParliament met on the 25th Nov. and passed the first Quarantine Act (9\r\nAnne, cap. II.). Swift had a good deal to say with Ministers on many\r\nsubjects, and it is not impossible, however absurd, that his had been the\r\nfirst suggestion to Harley of a quarantine law. I had purposed including a\r\nhistory of quarantine in Britain, but can find no convenient context for\r\nit. I shall therefore refer the reader to the historical sketch which I\r\nhave appended to the Article “Quarantine” in the _Encyclopaedia\r\nBritannica_, 9th ed.\r\n\r\n[92] _Essay on Epidemic Diseases._ Dublin, 1734, p. 34.\r\n\r\n[93] Dr Guide, a Frenchman, who had been in practice in London for many\r\nyears, says in his _Kind Warning to a Multitude of Patients daily\r\nafflicted with different sorts of Fevers_ (1710) “the British physicians\r\nand surgeons are lately fallen into an unhappy and terrible confusion and\r\nmixture of honest and fraudulent pretenders.” Another writer of 1710, Dr\r\nLynn, quoted in the chapter on Smallpox, implies that physicians were\r\ntaking an unusually cynical view of their business. The most interesting\r\nessay of the time on fevers is by J. White, M.D. (_De recta Sanguinis\r\nMissione &c._ Lond. 1712), a Scot who had been in the Navy and afterwards\r\nin practice at Lisbon; but it throws no light upon the London fevers.\r\n\r\n[94] Elizabeth, Lady Otway, to Benj.

The price of wheat was both\r\nlow and steady. Wages, if they advanced slowly, appear to have commanded\r\nan increased proportion of the necessaries of life, and there were all the\r\nsigns of growing material well-being. It was noticed that wheat bread, and\r\nthat made of the finest flour, which at the beginning of the period had\r\nbeen confined to the upper and middle classes, had become before the close\r\nof it over the greater part of England the universal food, and that the\r\nconsumption of cheese and butter in proportion to the population in many\r\ndistricts almost trebled.

The annual\r\ndeaths under the old _régime_ exceeded by a good deal the annual births:\r\nin the seven years 1728-35, according to the figures from the parish\r\nregisters in Drake’s _Eboracum_, the burials from all causes were 3488,\r\nand the baptisms 2803, an annual excess of 98 deaths over the births in an\r\nestimated population of 10,800 (birth-rate 37 per 1000, death-rate 46 per\r\n1000). But in the seven years, 1770-76, the balance was the other way: the\r\npopulation had increased by two thousand (to 12,800), and the births were\r\non an average 20 in the year more than the deaths (474 births, 454\r\ndeaths), the birth-rate being still 37 per 1000, and the death-rate fallen\r\nto 35 per 1000. But the correctness of these rates depends on the\r\npopulation being exactly given.\r\n\r\n[102] “There has been very great mobbing by the weavers of this town, as\r\nthey pretend, because they are starved for want of trade; and they pull\r\nthe calico cloaths off women’s backs wherever they see them. The\r\nTrainbands have been up since last Friday, and they were forced to fire at\r\nthe mobb in Moor Fields before they would disperse, and four or five were\r\nshott and as many wounded.” (Benjamin Browne to his father, 16 June, 1719:\r\nMr Browne’s MSS. _Hist. MSS. Com._ X. pt. 4, p. 351.) The calicoes which\r\nthe London weavers tore from the backs of women were doubtless the Indian\r\nfabrics brought home by the ships of the East India Company. These imports\r\nwere so injurious to home manufactures that an Act had been passed in 1700\r\nprohibiting (with some exceptions) the use in England of printed or dyed\r\ncalicoes or any other printed or dyed cotton goods. This prohibition was\r\nre-enacted in 1721, two years after the rioting at Moorfields. (7 Geo. I.\r\ncap. 7). Blomefield (_Hist. of Norfolk_, III. 437) says that at Norwich\r\nalso there was tearing of calicoes, “as pernicious to the trade” of that\r\ncity. On the 20th of September, 1720, a great riot arose there, the rabble\r\ncutting several gowns in pieces on women’s backs, entering shops to seize\r\nall calicoes found there, beating the constables, and opposing the\r\nsheriff’s power to such a degree that the company of artillery had to be\r\ncalled out.\r\n\r\n[103] Ambrose Warren to Sir P.

The district, says Defoe, was “a rich enclosed\r\ncountry, full of rivers and towns, and infinitely populous, in so much\r\nthat some of the market towns are equal to cities in bigness, and superior\r\nto many of them in numbers of people.” Taunton had 1100 looms. Tiverton in\r\nthe seven years 1700-1706 had 331 marriages, 1116 baptisms, 1175 burials\r\n(a slight excess), and an estimated population of 8693, which kept nearly\r\nat that level for about twenty years longer (from 1720 to 1726 the\r\nmarriages were 284, the baptisms 1070 and the burials 1175).\r\n\r\n[135] _Gent.

Even in the latter it was freely satirized by the\r\nlaity. When the surgeon in _Tom Jones_ complained bitterly that the\r\nwounded hero would not be blooded though he was in a fever, the landlady\r\nof the inn answered: “It is an eating fever, then, for he hath devoured\r\ntwo swingeing buttered toasts this morning for breakfast.” “Very likely,”\r\nsays the doctor, “I have known people eat in a fever; and it is very\r\neasily accounted for; because the acidity occasioned by the febrile matter\r\nmay stimulate the nerves of the diaphragm, and thereby occasion a craving\r\nwhich will not be easily distinguishable from a natural appetite....\r\nIndeed I think the gentleman in a very dangerous way, and, if he is not\r\nblooded, I am afraid will die.”\r\n\r\n[144] Munk, _Roll of the College of Physicians_, II. 53.\r\n\r\n[145] _Gentleman’s Magaz._ III. 1733, Sept., p. 492.\r\n\r\n[146] _Effects of Air on Human Bodies_, 1733, pp. 11, 17.

But this common field, I say, being sometime the beauty of this\r\ncity on that part, is so encroached upon by building of filthy cottages,\r\nand with other purprestures, enclosures and laystalls (notwithstanding all\r\nproclamations and Acts of Parliament made to the contrary) that in some\r\nplaces it scarce remaineth a sufficient highway for the meeting of\r\ncarriages and droves of cattle. Much less is there any fair, pleasant or\r\nwholesome way for people to walk on foot, which is no small blemish to so\r\nfamous a city to have so unsavoury and unseemly an entrance or passage\r\nthereunto.” Stow’s _Survey of London_, section on “Suburbs without the\r\nWalls.”\r\n\r\n[148] The line of an old field walk can still be followed from\r\nAldermanbury Postern to Hackney, Goldsmiths’ Row being one of the wider\r\nsections of it.\r\n\r\n[149] Luttrell’s _Diary_ 10 June, 1684.\r\n\r\n[150] Roger North’s “Autobiography,” in _Lives of the Norths_, new ed. 3\r\nvols., 1890, III. 54.\r\n\r\n[151] Willan, 1801: “The passage filled with putrid excremental or other\r\nabominable effluvia from a vault at the bottom of the staircase.” See also\r\nClutterbuck, _Epid.

A lady from a city in the\r\nnorth of Scotland travelled direct to Switzerland to reside for a few\r\nweeks at one of the hotels in the High Alps. Within an hour or two of the\r\nend of her journey she began to feel ill, and was confined to her room\r\nfrom the time she entered the hotel. An English physician diagnosed the\r\neffects of the sun; the German doctor of the place, from his reading only,\r\ndiagnosed typhus fever, which proved to be right, the patient dying with\r\nthe most pronounced signs of malignant typhus. An explanation of the\r\nmystery was soon forthcoming. The lady had been a district visitor in an\r\nold and poor part of the Scotch city; she had, in particular, visited in a\r\ncertain tenement-house in a court, from which half-a-dozen persons had\r\nbeen admitted to the Infirmary with typhus (an unusual event) at the very\r\ntime when she was ill of it on the Swiss mountain.\r\n\r\n[179] Blane, _Select Dissertations_.

His chief point, that\r\nthe strongest and lustiest were most obnoxious to malignant fevers, had\r\nbeen urged by Cockburn in 1696.\r\n\r\n[184] Lind (_Two Papers on Fevers and Infection_, London, 1763, p. 113)\r\ngives an instance where the poisonous effluvia of the ship’s well did not\r\nspread through the ’tween decks: “The following accident happened lately\r\n[written in 1761] in the Bay of Biscay. In a ship of 60 guns, by the\r\ncarpenter’s neglecting to turn the cock that freshens the bilge-water,\r\nwhich had not been pumped out for some time, a large scum, as is usual, or\r\na thick tough film was collected a-top of it. The first man who went down\r\nto break this scum in order to pump out the bilge-water was immediately\r\nsuffocated. The second suffered an instantaneous death in like manner. And\r\nthree others, who successively attempted the same business, narrowly\r\nescaped with life: one of whom has never since perfectly recovered his\r\nhealth. Yet that ship was at all times, both before and after this\r\naccident, remarkably healthy.” It was the contention of Renwick, a naval\r\nsurgeon who wrote in 1794, that it was the stirring of the bilge-water in\r\nbeing discharged from the ship’s well, or the adding of fresh water to the\r\nfoul, that caused the offensive emanations. “Hence the first cause of\r\nfebrile sickness in all ships recently commissioned.” Renwick made so much\r\nof the foul bilge-water as a cause that he thought the fevers ought to be\r\ntermed “bilge-fevers.” _Letter to the Critical Reviewer_, p. 42.\r\n\r\n[185] These particulars are not given in Freind’s special work on\r\nPeterborough’s campaign, which deals only with the military and political\r\nhistory, but in his _Nine Commentaries on Fever_ (Engl. ed. by Dale,\r\nLondon, 1730), and in a Latin letter to Cockburn, dated Barcelona, 9 Sept.\r\n1706, which was first printed in _Several Cases in Physic_.

Here I saw about fifty miserable\r\ndistempered wretches, suspended in rows, so huddled one upon another that\r\nnot more than fourteen inches space was allowed for each with his bed and\r\nbedding; and deprived of the light of the day, as well as of fresh air;\r\nbreathing nothing but a noisome atmosphere of the morbid steams exhaling\r\nfrom their own excrements and diseased bodies, devoured with vermin\r\nhatched in the filth that surrounded them, and destitute of every\r\nconvenience necessary for people in that helpless condition.” Chap.

Referring to the winter of\r\n1788-89, he says: “At this time there were dreadful fevers in London,\r\nfatal to many, and a very infectious one in Coventry, of which many among\r\nthe poor died, most of them being delirious, and many phrenetical.”\r\n\r\n[248] Robert Willan, M.D., _Reports on the Diseases of London,\r\nparticularly during the years 1796-97-98-99 and 1800_.

A house, notorious for dirt and infection,\r\nnear Clare-market, afforded a farther proof of negligence: it was\r\nobstinately tenanted till the wall and floors, giving way in the night,\r\ncrushed to death the miserable inhabitants.”\r\n\r\n[250] _Medical Reports on the Effects of Water, Cold and Warm, as a Remedy\r\nin Fever and other Diseases._ 2nd ed., 1798. It need hardly be explained\r\nthat Dr Currie was competent on fevers, his use of the clinical\r\nthermometer marking him as a man of precision. He is best known to the\r\nlaity as the biographer of Robert Burns and the generous helper of the\r\npoet’s widow and family.\r\n\r\n[251] “If it be supposed,” says Currie, “that some cases may be\r\ndenominated typhus by mistake, let it be considered how many cases of this\r\ndisease do not appear in the books of the Dispensary, though occurring\r\namong the poor, being attended by the surgeons and apothecaries of the\r\nBenefit Clubs to which they belong.”\r\n\r\n[252] Moss (_A Familiar Medical Survey of Liverpool_, 1784), who had not\r\nthe same means of knowing the prevalence of typhus in Liverpool as Currie,\r\ndeclares that “there has been but one instance of a _truly_ malignant\r\nfever happening in the town for many years; it was in the autumn of 1781,\r\nand appeared in Chorley Street, which is one of the narrowest and most\r\npopulous streets in the town, and nine died of it in one week; it was only\r\nof short duration, and did not spread in any other part of the town.” He\r\nadmits that the habitations of the poorer class were confined, being\r\nchiefly in cellars; yet the diet of the _sober_ and _industrious_ is\r\nwholesome and sufficient, the comfortable artizans being ship-carpenters,\r\ncoopers, ropers and the like.\r\n\r\n[253] John Clark, M.D., _Observations on the Diseases which prevail in\r\nLong Voyages_, &c. 2nd ed., Lond. 1792; _Account of the Newcastle\r\nDispensary from its Commencement in 1777 to March 1789_, Newcastle, 1789;\r\nand subsequent Annual Reports.\r\n\r\n[254] Haygarth, _Phil.

Our markets are exceedingly high, oatmeal\r\n17_d._ and 18_d._ per boll, and not to be got even at that price. We have,\r\nindeed, been pretty well supplied with quantities of white peas from\r\nEngland and elsewhere; but that resource is likely to fail us, and what\r\nwill become of us then, particularly the very poorest sort, heaven only\r\nknows.” The lately flourishing silk and carpet weaving had declined during\r\nthe American War, and the seasons had been adverse to farmers. The lines\r\nin Burns’ poem, “Death and Dr Hornbook”:\r\n\r\n  ‘This while ye hae been mony a gate\r\n      At mony a house.’\r\n  ‘Ay, Ay,’ quoth he, and shook his head.--\r\n\r\nare explained by a note, “An epidemical fever was then raging in the\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\n[282] Account by Rev.

It pleased heaven to add\r\n   A worse affliction in the plague of war, &c.”\r\n\r\nTrotter, _Medicina Nautica_, I. 182, 1797, gives these real\r\ncases:--“During the short time that I attended the dispensary at\r\nNewcastle, just at the beginning of the [French] war, I was sent for to a\r\npoor man in a miserable and low part of the town called Sandgate. He was\r\nill with what is called a spotted fever.” Six children were standing round\r\nhis bed, the oldest not more than nine. They had been ill first, then his\r\nwife, who was recovered and had gone out to pawn the last article they had\r\nto buy meal for the children. The man worked on the quay at 1_s._ 2_d._\r\nper diem. Again, “When I practised as a surgeon and apothecary at the end\r\nof the late [American] war in a small town in Northumberland, with an\r\nextensive country business, some similar scenes came under my view. Two\r\nservants of two opulent farmers applied to me for relief. The first had\r\nseven children, who took the fever one by one till the whole became sick.\r\nHis wages were 1_s._ per diem. His master, a rich man, thought himself\r\ncharitable by allowing them to pull turnips from his field for food. The\r\nother servant was a shepherd; but his herding, as the saying is, was a\r\npoor one. The first and second of six children were able to work a little,\r\ntill they got a fever in a severe winter, and down they fell, one after\r\nanother, the father and mother at last.” They wanted to sell the cow; but\r\nsome charitable ladies raised a small subscription, by which means the\r\ncomforts of wine and diet came within their reach; their master, for his\r\npart, sent them the carcase of a sheep, which had been found dead in a\r\nfurrow, with a request that the skin should be returned.\r\n\r\n[285] Jenner to Shrapnell, Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, I. 106-7.\r\n\r\n[286] John Barker, _Epidemicks_, pp. 201-6.\r\n\r\n[287] The dearth of 1794-95 called forth one notable piece, the ‘Thoughts\r\nand Details on Scarcity,’ drawn up by Mr Burke, from his experience in\r\nBuckinghamshire, originally for the use of Mr Pitt, in November, 1795.\r\nBurke takes an optimist line, and preaches the economic doctrine of\r\n_laissez faire_: “After all,” he asks, “have we not reason to be thankful\r\nto the Giver of all good? In our history, and when ‘the labourer of\r\nEngland is said to have been once happy,’ we find constantly, after\r\ncertain intervals, a period of real famine; by which a melancholy havock\r\nwas made among the human race. The price of provisions fluctuated\r\ndreadfully, demonstrating a deficiency very different from the worst\r\nfailures of the present moment. Never, since I have known England, have I\r\nknown more than a comparative scarcity. The price of wheat, taking a\r\nnumber of years together, has had no very considerable fluctuation, nor\r\nhas it risen exceedingly within this twelvemonth. Even now, I do not know\r\nof one man, woman, or child, that has perished from famine; fewer, if any,\r\nI believe, than in years of plenty, when such a thing may happen by\r\naccident. This is owing to a care and superintendence of the poor, far\r\ngreater than any I remember.... Not only very few (I have observed that I\r\nknow of none though I live in a place [Beaconsfield] as poor as most) have\r\nactually died of want, but we have seen no traces of those dreadful\r\nexterminating epidemicks, which, in consequence of scanty and unwholesome\r\nfood, in former times not unfrequently wasted whole nations. Let us be\r\nsaved from too much wisdom of our own, and we shall do tolerably well.”\r\nThe last sentence is his favourite principle of “a wise and salutary\r\nneglect” on the part of Government.\r\n\r\n[288] A labourer at Bury St Edmunds, receiving a weekly wage of five\r\nshillings, was able to buy therewith at the old prices:\r\n\r\n                        Cost of same in 1801\r\n                              £ _s._ _d._\r\n       {A bushel of wheat     0  16   0\r\n       {A bushel of malt      0   9   0\r\n  5_s._{A pound of butter     0   1   0\r\n       {A pound of cheese     0   0   4\r\n       {Tobacco, one penny    0   0   1\r\n                            -----------\r\n                             £1   6   5\r\n  {Weekly wage in 1801, 9_s._\r\n  {Parish bonus         6_s._    15   0\r\n                             ----------\r\n                              0  11   5 deficiency\r\n\r\n[289] _Loidis and Elmete_, 1816, p. 85.\r\n\r\n[290] Thorp, Tract of 1802, cited by Hunter, _Ed.

The prejudice against fresh air appeared to be\r\nuniversal.... The doctor did not think it probable that he would live\r\nabove three days; but said, the only chance he had was in removing him\r\nfrom that close box in which he was shut up, and admitting as much air as\r\npossible into the apartment.... While the farmer yet hovered on the brink\r\nof death, his wife and Robert, his second son, were both taken ill....\r\nPeter MacGlashan had taken to his bed on going home and was now\r\ndangerously ill of the fever.... All the village indeed offered their\r\nservices; and Mrs Mason, though she blamed the thoughtless custom of\r\ncrowding into a sick room, could not but admire the kindness and good\r\nnature with which all the neighbours seemed to participate in the distress\r\nof this afflicted family.”\r\n\r\n[295] Charlotte Brontë’s story of _Shirley_ falls in this period and turns\r\nupon the industrial crisis in Yorkshire; but it is on the whole a happy\r\nidyllic picture. Harriet Martineau wrote in _Household Words_, vol. I.\r\n1850, Nos. 9-12, a story entitled “The Sickness and Health of the People\r\nof Bleaburn,” a Yorkshire village supposed to have been Osmotherly. It is,\r\nin substance, an account of a terrible epidemic of fever in the year 1811,\r\nthe story opening with the news of the victory of Albuera and the\r\nrejoicings thereon. It appears to have been constructed very closely from\r\nthe real events of the plague of 1665-66 in the village of Eyam, in the\r\nNorth Peak of Derbyshire, and had probably a very slender foundation in\r\nany facts of fever in Yorkshire or elsewhere in the year 1811. “Ten or\r\neleven corpses,” says the novelist, “were actually lying unburied,\r\ninfecting half-a-dozen cottages from this cause.” Cf. infra, Leyburn, p.\r\n167.\r\n\r\n[296] T.

It was marked by rigors at the onset, pain in the\r\nback, headache, dry skin, loaded very red tongue, quick fluttering pulse,\r\nwatchfulness, delirium-like fatuity, abdominal pain in many, foetid\r\nstools, great prostration, gradual recovery after fifteen or sixteen days\r\nwithout manifest crisis, and relapses in some. In this fever Murchison\r\ndiscovers enteric or typhoid. Its limitation to a part of one of the\r\nsuburbs of Paisley is, of course, in the manner of enteric fever; on the\r\nother hand, only one of those 32 cases died, which is a rate of fatality\r\nperhaps not unparalleled in typhoid but much more often matched in typhus\r\nor relapsing fever of young and old together; while the length of the\r\nfever, fifteen or sixteen days or sometimes more, is too great for the\r\nabortive kind of enteric and too little for enteric fever completing both\r\nits first and second stages.

Relapses have been noticed as of frequent occurrence in the\r\ninstances of the late epidemic. To what are these to be attributed? Are we\r\nto ascribe them to the influence of the atmosphere, to anything in the\r\nnature of the disorders themselves, or to the vigorous plans of treatment\r\nwhich are adopted for their removal? These relapses are more common in\r\nhospital than in private practice.... It has recently become the fashion\r\nto consider the state of recovery from fever as one which will do better\r\nwithout than with the interposition of the cinchona bark.

I had nearly six days of the primary attack, then a week of\r\ncomfort, repose and feebleness, and next the secondary attack, or relapse,\r\nfor three days more. My pulse rose to 160, and continued hard and\r\nincompressible even at that rate. My temperature under the tongue was 107°\r\n&c.” He was bled to 30 oz. and next day to 20 oz. more. Before the end of\r\nthe epidemic, in August, 1819, he had another attack of relapsing fever,\r\nfor which he was bled to 24 oz. and a third, after exposure to chill, the\r\nsame autumn, which last was a simple five-days’ fever without relapse,\r\nalso treated by the abstraction of 24 oz. of blood. In 1832 he had two\r\nattacks of the same _synocha_ without relapses, and throughout the rest of\r\nhis life many more: e.g. 16 June, 1861, “I have had something like the\r\nrelapsing fever of my youth”--a five-days’ fever with a relapse on the\r\n18th day; and again, on 19 March, 1868, “Incomprehensible return of mine\r\nancient enemy.” These experiences coloured Christison’s view of relapsing\r\nfever, the so-called relapses being, in his opinion, comparable to the\r\nreturning paroxysms of ague.\r\n\r\n[325] Cleland.\r\n\r\n[326] Report signed A.

The Leeds House of Recovery, with fifty beds,\r\nwas opened on 1 November, 1804, the epidemic of fever being then about\r\nover. One of its officers was an inspector, whose duty was “to detect the\r\nfirst appearance of infection, to cause the removal of the patient to the\r\nHouse of Recovery, and to superintend the fumigating and whitewashing of\r\nthe apartment from which he is removed. So great is the solicitude of the\r\nphysicians to promote early removal that rewards are offered to such as\r\nshall first give information of an infectious fever in their\r\nneighbourhoods.” It was claimed that this had been a great success, Leeds\r\nhaving been for twelve years previous to the epidemic of 1817 nearly\r\nexempted from two of the most infectious and fatal diseases, namely,\r\ntyphus and scarlet fever. (It happened, however, that the whole of\r\nEngland, Scotland and even Ireland were exempted to the same remarkable,\r\nand of course gratifying degree.) Whitaker, _Loidis and Elmete_, 1816, p.\r\n85.\r\n\r\n[338] A strange epidemic of the early summer of 1824 in a semi-charitable\r\ngirls’ school at Cowan Bridge, between Leeds and Kendal, which is the\r\nsubject of a moving chapter in ‘Jane Eyre,’ was inquired into by Mrs\r\nGaskell, the biographer of Charlotte Brontë. Forty girls were attacked\r\nwith fever. A woman who was sent to nurse the sick, saw when she entered\r\nthe school-room from twelve to fifteen girls lying about, some resting\r\ntheir heads on the table, others on the ground; all heavy-eyed and\r\nflushed, indifferent and weary, with pains in every limb, the atmosphere\r\nof the room having a peculiar odour. The symptoms, so far as known, and\r\nthe circumstances of the school, point more to relapsing fever than to\r\ntyphus, which is the name given to it by Charlotte Brontë. None died of\r\nthe fever (it is otherwise in the tale), but one girl died at home of its\r\nafter-effects. Dr Batty, of Kirby, who was called in, did not consider the\r\ntype of fever to be alarming or dangerous. The dietary of the school had\r\nundoubtedly been most meagre for growing girls, and its discipline severe.\r\nThe house was old and unsuited for the purposes of a boarding-school.\r\n\r\n[339] Cowan, _Journ.

At this\r\ntime it was the practice at Guy’s to examine the bodies after death; but\r\npermission was refused in the case in question, so that Burne was unable\r\nto say “whether the bowels were affected.” The case, therefore, may have\r\nbeen one of relapsing enteric fever. A similar ambiguity is discussed by\r\nHughes Bennett in his _Principles and Practice of Physic_ (p. 923), and\r\ndecided in favour of relapsing fever proper, or relapsing synocha.\r\n\r\n[345] Sir William Jenner, M.D., _Lectures and Essays on Fevers and\r\nDiphtheria_, 1849 to 1879.

Sc._ XV. p. 3, note): “In the\r\nepidemic of 1826 and 1827 we observed the follicular ulceration\r\n(dothienenteritis of the French) in the greater number of cases.” As the\r\nepidemic of 1826-27 was almost wholly one of relapsing fever, the\r\nstatement is at least puzzling. It was made twelve years after the\r\nepidemic, at a time when the discrepancies between British and French\r\nobservers, as to the occurrence of ulceration of the ileum in continued\r\nfever, were much discussed. Dr Lombard, of Geneva, having visited Glasgow,\r\nDublin and other places, and confirmed the fact that the characteristic\r\nlesion of enteric fever was at that time only occasional, went on to say\r\nthat Irish typhus was a species of disease by itself, a _morbus miseriae_.\r\nWhereupon the editor of the ‘Dublin Journal of Medical Science’ (XII. 503,\r\nin a review of Cowan’s Glasgow Statistics) gave the following truly Irish\r\nreply: “Had Dr Lombard made more inquiries, he would have found that\r\nIreland is not so sunk in misery and debasement but that she can produce\r\noccasionally a fever which, in abdominal ulcerations, can compete with the\r\nsporadic diseases of her wealthier and more enlightened neighbours.” It\r\nmay have been in the same patriotic spirit that Stokes declared “the\r\ngreater number of cases” in the epidemic of 1826 and 1827 to have had\r\nfollicular ulceration.\r\n\r\n[355] G. L. Roupell, M.D., _Some Account of a Fever prevalent in 1831_.\r\nLond. 1837.\r\n\r\n[356] In addition to what has been said on this point already, for\r\nparticular epidemics, I shall give a statement for ordinary years by Dr\r\nCarrick, of Bristol, in his ‘Medical Topography’ of that city: _Trans.\r\nProv. Med. Assocn._ II. (1834), p. 176. “Continued fever is common enough,\r\nbut nine-tenths of the cases are of a simple character, terminating for\r\nthe most part within seven days, and unaccompanied with anything more\r\nserious than slight catarrhal or rheumatic disorder. Typhus gravior is\r\nrare--much more so than might be expected.”\r\n\r\n[357] Charles West, M.D., “Historical Notices designed to illustrate the\r\nquestion whether Typhus ought to be classed among the Exanthematous\r\nFevers.” _Edin.

Some gave much more complete returns\r\nthan others. There was a reluctance to register births, and the marriages\r\nwere not all registered. But the totals of deaths came out very nearly as\r\nthe actuaries had expected.\r\n\r\n[376] The Third Report of the Registrar-General gives the mortality in all\r\nparts of England from typhus in 1839 (as well as from scarlatina) in an\r\nelaborate table of the registration districts and sub-districts.\r\n\r\n[377] W. Budd, M.D., _Lancet_, 27 Dec. 1856, and 2 July, 1859. Dr Budd,\r\nwho had been studying in Paris and seeing much typhoid fever, but little\r\nor no typhus, in the service of Louis at La Pitié hospital, took the whole\r\nof these cases for enteric or typhoid, and insisted, in his later life, on\r\nthe ground of his North Tawton experiences in 1839, that typhoid fever\r\nspread by contagion. He published numerous papers on this theme (_Lancet_,\r\n27 Dec. 1856, another series in the same journal from 2 July to Nov. 1859,\r\n_Brit. Med. Journ._ Nov.-Dec. 1861, and, finally, a volume of reprints\r\nwith additions, _Typhoid Fever, its Nature, Mode of Spreading and\r\nPrevention_, London, 1873). But he published no clinical cases nor\r\npost-mortem notes, to make good his 1839 diagnosis, on which the whole\r\nmatter turned, contenting himself with an assurance that he knew typhoid\r\nwell from studying it under Louis (who, at that time, believed that the\r\ntyphus of armies, gaols, &c. and of the British writers, was the same as\r\nthe fever which he, and others after him, named typhoid). He also made the\r\nfollowing six statements, as if he were making affidavit: (1) that the\r\ngreat majority of the cases had early diarrhoea, (2) that three had\r\nprofuse intestinal haemorrhage, (3) that more or less of tympanitis was\r\nalmost universal in the epidemic, (4) that in nearly every case he found\r\nthe rose-coloured lenticular spots, (5) that one case, which was the only\r\none examined post-mortem, had the characteristic ulceration of the\r\nintestine, and (6) that one fatal case had the symptoms of perforation of\r\nthe gut. This summary manner, asking in effect to be taken on trust, is\r\nnot usually accepted from innovators, none of the great discoverers having\r\nresorted to it. Hitherto, however, no one has thought proper to question\r\nBudd’s diagnosis of the epidemic fever in his North Tawton practice, nor\r\neven to remark upon his strange error of treating the epidemic of 1838-39\r\nall over Britain as purely one of typhoid (_Lancet_, 27 Dec. 1856). But\r\neveryone knew that typhoid fever did not spread in the way that he\r\ndescribed (doubtless correctly for the above cases). After the publication\r\nof his book in 1873 an attempt was made by an influential layman in the\r\n_Times_ (9 Nov. 1874) to popularize Budd’s fallacies or paradoxes on the\r\ncontagiousness of typhoid. “How,” it was asked, after a summary of the\r\nNorth Tawton epidemic in 1839, “could a disease whose characters are so\r\nseverely demonstrable, have ever been imagined to be non-contagious? How\r\ncould such a doctrine be followed, as it has been, to the destruction of\r\nhuman life?”\r\n\r\n[378] “For three years past trade had been getting worse and worse, and\r\nthe price of provisions higher and higher. This disparity between the\r\namount of the earnings of the working classes and the price of their food\r\noccasioned, in more cases than could well be imagined, disease and death.\r\nWhole families went through a gradual starvation. They only wanted a Dante\r\nto record their sufferings. And yet even his words would fall short of the\r\nawful truth; they could only present an outline of the tremendous facts of\r\nthe destitution that surrounded thousands upon thousands in the terrible\r\nyears 1839, 1840, and 1841. Even philanthropists who had studied the\r\nsubject were forced to own themselves perplexed in their endeavour to\r\nascertain the real causes of the misery; the whole matter was of so\r\ncomplicated a nature that it became next to impossible to understand it\r\nthoroughly.... The most deplorable and enduring evil that arose out of the\r\nperiod of commercial depression to which I refer, was this feeling of\r\nalienation between the different classes of society. It is so impossible\r\nto describe, or even faintly to picture, the state of distress which\r\nprevailed in the town [Manchester] at that time, that I will not attempt\r\nit; and yet I think again that surely, in a Christian land, it was not\r\nknown even so feebly as words could tell it, or the more happy and\r\nfortunate would have thronged with their sympathy and their aid. In many\r\ninstances the sufferers wept first, and then they cursed. Their vindictive\r\nfeelings exhibited themselves in rabid politics. And when I hear, as I\r\nhave heard, of the sufferings and privations of the poor, of provision\r\nshops, where ha’porths of tea, sugar, butter, and even flour, were sold to\r\naccommodate the indigent--of parents sitting in their clothes by the\r\nfireside during the whole night for seven weeks together, in order that\r\ntheir only bed and bedding might be reserved for the use of their large\r\nfamily--of others sleeping upon the cold hearthstone for weeks in\r\nsuccession, without adequate means of providing themselves with food or\r\nfuel--and this in the depth of winter--of others being compelled to fast\r\nfor days together, uncheered by any hope of better fortune, living,\r\nmoreover, or rather starving, in a crowded garret, or damp cellar, and\r\ngradually sinking under the pressure of want and despair into a premature\r\ngrave; and when this has been confirmed by the evidence of their careworn\r\nlooks, their excited feelings, and their desolate homes--can I wonder that\r\nmany of them, in such times of misery and destitution, spoke and acted\r\nwith ferocious precipitation?” Mrs Gaskell, _Mary Barton_.\r\n\r\n[379] John Goodsir, “On a Diseased Condition of the Intestinal Glands,”\r\n_Lond. and Edin.

The appearance of comfort was\r\ncertainly due in part to the district visitors, who were numerous and\r\nactive during the epidemic.\r\n\r\n[401] Spear, “Typhus Fever in various parts of England, 1886-87.” _Rep.\r\nMed.

B. Longstaff, M.D., _Trans. Epid. Soc._ 1884-5, p. 72, reprinted\r\nin his _Studies in Statistics_, Lond. 1891, p. 402. The seasonal curve for\r\nthe typhoid admissions to the London Fever Hospital over a longer period\r\nis nearly the same, as well as that of the registered deaths by typhoid in\r\nall London, 1869-84.\r\n\r\n[404] The following large registration districts besides those in the\r\nTable, had enteric-fever death rates of ·5 and upwards per 1000 persons\r\nliving, in the ten years 1871-80; in nearly all of them there has been a\r\nmarked decline in the ten years 1881-90:--Durham, Hartlepool, Easington,\r\nHoughton-le-Spring, Darlington, Gateshead (county Durham); Morpeth\r\n(Northumberland); Aysgarth, Todmorden, Dewsbury, Pontefract, Barnsley,\r\nRotherham (Yorkshire); Dudley, Leigh, Ormskirk (Lancashire); Crickhowell\r\n(Wales); Worksop, Radford (Nottingham); Shrewsbury; Peterborough; Portsea\r\nIsland (Hants). Of the London districts, Hackney had the highest enteric\r\nfever, 0·46 per 1000 in a general death-rate of 20·78. The high rate of a\r\ndecennium is not unfrequently brought up by one great explosion. In many\r\nof the Lancashire, Yorkshire and Midland towns, with rates about ·4 per\r\n1000 persons, the rate has been somewhat steady from year to year. In the\r\ndecennium 1871-80, many special outbreaks, some of them in villages, were\r\nreported on by the inspectors of the Medical Department, and traced for\r\nthe most part to water-supplies tainted by the percolation of excrement.\r\n\r\n[405] The Registration District of Middlesborough was carved out of\r\nStockton and Guisborough in 1875.\r\n\r\n[406] Registration District containing a population of 72,707 on a mean\r\nbetween the census of 1871 and that of 1881. In 1891 the population was\r\n146,812.\r\n\r\n[407] F. W. Barry, M.D., in _Rep. Med. Off. Loc. Gov. Board for 1882_, p.\r\n72. The contention of the inspector was that the water-supply had been\r\ntainted by enteric-fever evacuations from a case which began on 22 May in\r\na cottage some half-mile distant from the reservoir but in communication\r\nwith it through ditches and brooks. The area of the water-supply did not\r\ncorrespond with the area of the fever.\r\n\r\n[408] The report for the Medical Department by F. W. Barry, M.D. (_Enteric\r\nFever in the Tees Valley_, 1890-91, Parl. papers, Nov. 1893), is an\r\nelaborate argument to prove that the flooded state of the Tees was indeed\r\nthe relevant antecedent, not as indexing the rise of the ground-water in\r\nthe respective towns, but as dislodging and sweeping down the slops,\r\nsewage and dry refuse of the market town of Barnard Castle, in upper\r\nTeesdale, whereby the water taken in from the Tees two miles above\r\nDarlington to the tanks, filters and reservoirs of the Darlington\r\nCorporation, and of the Stockton and Middlesborough Water Board, was\r\ntainted in some unusual degree--a hypothesis the more remarkable that the\r\nrefuse, such as it was, had been suspended or dissolved in an unusual\r\nvolume of water, that little refuse could have collected between the first\r\nfloods and the second, and that no cases of enteric fever were known in\r\nthe upper valley of the Tees. This judicial deliverance has not been\r\naccepted by the authorities of Darlington, Stockton and Middlesborough,\r\nnor by the Royal Commission on Water Supply, before whom it was laid.\r\n\r\n[409] Besides the epidemic at Worthing in 1893, which is still _sub\r\njudice_, the best known instance of typhoid following a certain\r\nwater-supply is the explosion at Redhill and Caterham in Jan.-Feb. 1879,\r\n_Rep. Med. Off. Loc. Gov. Board, for 1879_, Parl. papers, 1880, p. 78. The\r\nfirst instance alleged of the distribution by milk was the Islington\r\nexplosion in July-August 1870 (Ballard, _Med. Times and Gaz._ 1870, II.\r\n611). It was soon followed by the Marylebone explosion in the summer of\r\n1873 (_Rep. Med. Off. L. G. B._, N. S. II. 193); but such instances have\r\nbecome less common, while instances of scarlatina and diphtheria following\r\na milk-supply have become more common.\r\n\r\n[410] _Second Letter to Sir Hercules Langrishe_, May, 1795.\r\n\r\n[411] Berkeley’s _Querist_, Q. 362.\r\n\r\n[412] Radulphus de Diceto, _Imag.

The first historical occasion of\r\nsickness was in 1566. The troops of Elizabeth were landed on Loch Foyle in\r\nOctober and built their huts on the site of the old monastery. In the\r\ncourse of the winter the greater part of a force of 1100 men perished by\r\ndysentery and the infection which it breeds (see former volume, p. 372).\r\nOn 12 Dec. 1642, a year after the outbreak of the Rebellion of Confederate\r\nCatholics, a petition of the agents of the distressed city of Londonderry\r\nto the Commons represented that there were 6059 persons in the city,\r\nwhereof 5123 were women and children, or sick, aged or impotent; only 2000\r\nwere inhabitants of the city, the rest having fled there for safety.\r\nSpotted fever had broken out.

There is no need to invoke ergotism\r\nfor an explanation of it, as some have done.\r\n\r\n[426] At that time there was little systematic knowledge of military\r\nhygiene. Nearly two generations after, the experiences of Pringle, Donald\r\nMonro and Brocklesby in the campaigns of 1743-48 and 1758-63 in Germany\r\nand the Netherlands, yielded many valuable hints, some of which Virchow\r\nmade use of in compiling his “Rules of Health for the Army in the Field,”\r\nin the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71.

The butchers, therefore, most of whom\r\nlive in the narrow streets near the shambles, have their slaughter-houses\r\nimmediately behind their dwellings. The garbage is thrown into a large\r\npit, which is generally cleaned but once in the year, at the season when\r\nthe manure is required for planting potatoes, and at this time an\r\noffensive smell pervades the whole town, and is perceptible for a\r\nconsiderable distance around. The families exposed constantly to the\r\neffluvia arising from these heaps of putrid offal might have been expected\r\nto suffer severely from fever; but on the contrary, they were found to be\r\nmuch less liable to it than others in the same rank of life. This was no\r\ndoubt owing to their living chiefly on animal food, and thus escaping the\r\ndebility induced by deficient nourishment, which certainly had the chief\r\nshare in creating a predisposition to the disease.”\r\n\r\n[431] Bp.

His father had changed his holding three times before William,\r\nthe youngest child, was fourteen years old; the last of the four was a\r\nfarm of sixteen or eighteen acres in the north of Clogher parish, and\r\n“nearer the mountains.” Carleton says that he “lived among the people as\r\none of themselves” until he was twenty-two, which would have been until\r\nthe year 1820; so that he probably saw the famine and fever of 1817-18\r\namong that very Tyrone peasantry whom Dr Rogan brings before us from the\r\nmedical side. The scenes of famine and fever in the ‘Black Prophet’ are\r\nthose “which he himself witnessed in 1817, 1822, and other subsequent\r\nyears,” having been recalled by him in the form of a tale which was\r\npublished in 1846, at the beginning of the Great Famine of that and the\r\nfollowing year. His early recollections of famine and fever come into\r\nother tales, such as the ‘Clarionet,’ the ‘Poor Scholar’ and ‘Tubber\r\nDerg,’ in which last is related the almost inevitable reduction to poverty\r\nand at length to beggary of a most upright and industrious farmer owing to\r\nthe fall of prices, without fall of rents, after the Peace of 1815.\r\nCarleton’s work has always the quality of fidelity, and he may be credited\r\nwhen he says that the scenes of famine and fever are not exaggerated.\r\n\r\n[467] Rogan, u. s. p. 95: “A farmer within my knowledge, who holds fifteen\r\nacres of arable land, with nearly an equal quantity of cut-out bog, for\r\nwhich he pays £28 per annum, has erected six cabins for labourers. They\r\nare built with mud, instead of lime, and are thatched, so that they cannot\r\neach have cost more than three or four pounds. For some time he received\r\nfrom three of his tenants six guineas per annum, and from the others two\r\nguineas each, the latter only holding a cottage and a small garden [the\r\nformer three having also grazing for a milch cow, half a rood of land for\r\nflax, and half an acre for oats, with privileges of cutting turf and\r\nplanting as many potatoes as they could each provide manure for]; but they\r\nhave been all so reduced in circumstances by the late scarcity as to be\r\nnow unable to keep a cow, and for the two last years have rented their\r\ncabins and potato gardens alone. All the straw raised on the farm would\r\nscarcely suffice to keep the houses water-fast if applied solely to this\r\npurpose.” One of the first things that the Marquis of Abercorn did in the\r\nepidemic of 1817 was to call upon the subletting farmers on his manors to\r\nrepair the roofs of their cottiers’ cabins.\r\n\r\n[468] Carleton, in one of his tales, has given a vivid picture of the\r\nlurid or gloomy appearance of the country in the late autumn of 1816, as\r\nif it foreboded the distress of the following spring.\r\n\r\n[469] Probably their cattle had been impounded for rent and tithe. The\r\nauthor of the pamphlet _Lachrymae Hiberniae_ (Dublin, 1822), a resident on\r\nthe western coast, says (p. 8), with reference to the seizures for rent\r\nand tithe: “Oh what scenes of misery were exhibited in Ireland in this way\r\nduring the years 1817, ’18 and ’19; by that time the people were left\r\nwithout cattle; after this their potatoes and corn were seized and sold,\r\nand in some cases their household furniture, even to their blankets.” The\r\nhardness of landlords in general is alleged by Dr Rogan, with an exception\r\nin favour of the Marquis of Abercorn in his own district.\r\n\r\n[470] There was dysentery also in the autumn of 1818. Cheyne, _Dubl. Hosp.\r\nRep._ III. 1.\r\n\r\n[471] Rogan, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[472] The following is an instance, from Boyle, in Roscommon: “In the\r\nmiddle of June, 1817, or a little earlier, a soup-shop was established\r\nhere by subscription, where soup was daily given out to one thousand\r\npersons, who, naturally anxious to procure it in time, crowded together\r\nduring its distribution, though every pains was taken to keep order\r\namongst them. From the 16th to the 23rd of that month the weather became\r\nsuddenly and unusually hot, and the disease about that period spread\r\nrapidly among those persons, the greater number of whom attributed the\r\norigin of their complaint to attendance at the soup-shop; among that\r\ncrowd, many of whom I have seen faint from absolute want during exposure\r\nto the sun, there were persons from houses where the disease existed.”\r\nReport by Dr Verdon of Boyle, 26 June, 1818, in Barker and Cheyne, I. 325.\r\n\r\n[473] Dr King of Tralee (Barker and Cheyne, I. p. 177) wrote as follows:\r\n“It is a custom in this country for very poor persons, living in the\r\ncountry parts, and possessing a miserable hovel with a small garden, after\r\nthey have sowed their potatoes, to shut up their hut and carrying their\r\nfamilies with them, to roam about the country, trusting to the known\r\nhospitality of the towns and villages for shelter and subsistence till the\r\ntime for digging the potatoes shall have arrived.”\r\n\r\n[474] Barker and Cheyne, I. 60.\r\n\r\n[475] In Carleton’s tale of ‘The Poor Scholar,’ it is related how the\r\nhay-mowers stopped in their work to erect a hut for the fever-stricken\r\nyouth, and a much larger hut not far from the first for the numerous\r\npersons who ministered to his wants under a kind of quarantine\r\narrangement. The stealing of milk from rich men’s cows for the sick youth\r\nis the subject of a dialogue between the Roman Catholic bishop and the\r\nleader of the kindly party of mowers, in which the latter shows a skill in\r\ncasuistry creditable to his religious instructors.\r\n\r\n[476] William Harty, M.D., _Historic Sketch of the Contagious Fever\r\nEpidemic in Ireland during 1817-19_.

It was undertaken by Dr Harty at the instance of\r\nSir John Newport, M.P. for Waterford. The work by Barker and Cheyne on the\r\nsame epidemic took longer to prepare, having been published in 1821. See\r\nalso Cheyne, _Dubl. Hosp. Rep._ II. 1-147.\r\n\r\n[477] Barker and Cheyne, p. 65. A similar incident comes into Carleton’s\r\ntale of ‘The Clarionet’: “At length, out of compassion, the few neighbours\r\nwho feared not to attend a feverish death-bed, acting on the popular\r\nbelief that children under a certain age are not liable to catch a fever,\r\nplaced the boy in her arms.” This popular belief was well founded.\r\n\r\n[478] Accounts from various places in Barker and Cheyne, and in Harty.\r\nRogan (u. s. p. 45) says: “The cases of typhus gravior were infinitely\r\nmore numerous among the rich and well-fed than among the poor; and with\r\nthem also the head was most frequently the seat of diseased action.”\r\n\r\n[479] _Report on the Present State of the Distressed District in the South\r\nof Ireland: with an Enquiry into the Causes of the Distresses of the\r\nPeasantry and Farmers._ Dublin, 1822.\r\n\r\n[480] _Lachrymae Hiberniae, or the Grievances of the Peasantry of Ireland,\r\nespecially in the Western Counties._ By a Resident Native.

This was a startling fact, and a thousand different\r\nexplanations of it were given at the time.” He cites Fletcher\r\n(_Pathology_, p. 27) an Edinburgh observer, as follows: “The rich are less\r\nfrequently affected with epidemic fevers than the poor, but more\r\nfrequently die of them. Good fare keeps off diseases, but increases their\r\nmortality when they take place.”\r\n\r\n[519] _Dub. Quart. Journ. Med. Sc._ N. S.

The following by Dr Robert Williams (_Morbid Poisons_,\r\nII. 423) is absolutely erroneous: “In Sydenham’s time, intermittent fever\r\nand dysentery were constantly endemic in London; and the mortality from\r\nthe former cause alone averaged, in a comparatively small population, from\r\none to two thousand persons annually.” What Sydenham says is that\r\ndysentery was endemic in Ireland (on the authority of Boate, no doubt),\r\nthat it was epidemic in London in the end of 1669 and in the three years\r\nfollowing, and that for the space of ten years it had appeared quite\r\nsparingly (_quae per decennium jam parcius comparuerat_). As to\r\nintermittents, he says they were absent from London for thirteen years,\r\nfrom 1664 to 1677, except in sporadic or imported cases. In the London\r\nbills the deaths from “agues” are sometimes distinguished from “fevers,”\r\nand are then seen to be only some dozen or twenty in two thousand.\r\n\r\n[538] It is used in the Latin title of an Edinburgh graduation thesis, “De\r\nCatarrho epidemio, vel Influenza, prout in India occidentali sese\r\nostendit,” by J. Huggar, which is assigned in Häser’s bibliography to the\r\nyear 1703.

The explanation seems\r\nto be that the contemporary Irish name _slaedan_ was rendered by\r\nMacgeoghegan, in his translation of the Annals of Clonmacnoise, by the\r\n15th century English term “murre.” The “mure” of 1427 was a universal\r\ninfluenza; but the word was afterwards used for a common cold, along with\r\nposs, as in Gardiner’s _Triall of Tabacco_, 1610, fol. 12 and 15:\r\n“stuffings in the head, murres and pose, coughs”; and “the poze, murre,\r\nhorsenesse, cough” etc.\r\n\r\n[540] _Cal.

On the very verge of the period to which the history\r\nof malarial epidemics can be traced back, we meet with a pandemic of that\r\nsort, in the years 1557 and 1558, which is said to have overrun all Europe\r\n(Palmarius, _De morbis contagiosis_. Paris, 1578, p. 322).... It is not\r\nuntil the years 1678-82 that we again meet with definite facts relating to\r\nan epidemic extending over a great part of Europe....” (Eng. Transl.

In 1575 Dr Richard Foster (who became president\r\nof the College of Physicians in 1601) issued an almanack in which he\r\nforetold “sweating fevers” for the month of July (_Ephemer. meteorol. ad\r\nann. 1575._ Lond. 1575).

Helmstadtii, 1580.\r\n\r\n[550] Hoker’s “Irish historie ... to the present year 1587,” p. 165a in\r\nHolinshed’s _Chronicles_.\r\n\r\n[551] This very moderate increase of the deaths in London in 1580 may be\r\ncompared with the probably fabulous figures which Webster (I. 163) gives\r\nfor continental cities the same year: Rome, 4000 deaths, Lübeck, 8000\r\ndeaths, Hamburg, 3000 deaths. I have given the weekly deaths and baptisms\r\nin London for five years, 1578-82, in my former volume, p. 341.\r\n\r\n[552] There is a curious reference to “the sweat” in Shakespeare’s\r\n_Measure for Measure_, Act I. scene 2, where the bawd, in an aside, says:\r\n“Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what with the gallows, and\r\nwhat with poverty, I am custom-shrunk.” It is known that Shakespeare\r\nadapted and condensed his play from Whetstone’s _Promus and Cassandra_,\r\nprinted in 1578, who took it from an Italian romance. But Whetstone’s\r\ndialogue, which is pointless and verbose beside Shakespeare’s, gives an\r\nentirely different speech to the bawd at the same place in the action,\r\nmaking no reference to “the sweat.” The date of _Measure for Measure_ is\r\nnot certain; but it seems to belong to the earlier period of Shakespeare’s\r\nwork, when he was adapting old plays most freely. Whatever its date, the\r\nwar, the sweat, the gallows and poverty are evidently topical allusions\r\npointed enough for the audience to have taken up.\r\n\r\n[553] The year 1610 is mentioned by Short as a season of universal\r\ncatarrhal fever abroad; but that epidemic is not in the modern\r\nchronologies of influenza.\r\n\r\n[554] Chamberlain to Carleton in _Court and Times of James I._ I.\r\n\r\n[555] Same to same 4 Nov. 1612. _Ibid._ I. p. 201.\r\n\r\n[556] _Court and Times of James I._ I. p. 206.\r\n\r\n[557] _Ibid._ p. 208.\r\n\r\n[558] _Court and Times of James I._ p. 197.\r\n\r\n[559] _Ibid._ p. 237.\r\n\r\n[560] _Ibid._ Letter of 25 Nov. 1613.\r\n\r\n[561] _Cal.

But it was the name commonly given to the epidemics of\r\ncatarrhal fever among others, and it does not appear, when the history is\r\nexamined closely, that it was ever given except to some epidemic separated\r\nby several years from the last of the kind.\r\n\r\n[565] Sir R.

His\r\nfather, he said, once had the complaint, and a fit came on while he was on\r\na visit to him, the coachman, at Ramsgate.

On 5 October, “all my little ones are very\r\nwell, but some of my servants have quartan agues.” _Lives of the Norths_,\r\nLetters of Anne, Lady North.\r\n\r\n[598] An authentic case of these lingering epidemic agues was that of John\r\nEvelyn in the beginning of 1683. On 7th February, 1687, he writes: “Having\r\nhad several violent fits of an ague, recourse was had to bathing my legs\r\nin milk up to the knees, made as hot as I could endure it; and sitting so\r\nin a deep churn or vessel, covered with blankets, and drinking carduus\r\nposset, then going to bed and sweating. I not only missed that expected\r\nfit, but had no more, only continued weak that I could not go to church\r\ntill Ash Wednesday, which I had not missed, I think, so long in twenty\r\nyears”--in fact, since his “double tertian” in 1660, which kept him in bed\r\nfrom 17th February to 5th April.\r\n\r\n[599] Ralph Thoresby caught it at Rotterdam, suffered from it, in the\r\ntertian form, for several weeks of October and November, 1678, and brought\r\nit home with him to Leeds.

At the same time that the\r\nacute rheumatism prevailed, a fever showed itself, like it; the patients\r\nfor two or three days were languid, chilly, with pains in the bones,\r\nheadache, stupor, dry tongue, costiveness.

Christison pointed out very\r\nfairly the difficulties in the way of accepting the drainage-theory for\r\nthe decline of ague (p. 98), but he had not realized the fact that the\r\ndisease used to come in epidemics at long intervals.\r\n\r\n[681] e.g. parish of Dron, Perthshire (IX. 468): “The return of spring and\r\nautumn never failed to bring along with them this fatal disease [ague],\r\nand frequently laid aside many of the labouring hands at a time when their\r\nwork was of the greatest consequence and necessity.” That had now ceased,\r\nowing to drainage.

Influenza in the latter end of spring. Nine out\r\nof ten in Lichfield and other towns had violent defluxions of the nose,\r\nthroat and lungs, bringing on violent sneezings, soreness of the throat,\r\ncoughs, &c. attended with a pestilential fever, of which many were\r\nrelieved by perspiration.... Some had swelled faces, and violent pains in\r\nthe teeth.... Some, giddiness and violent headaches, accompanied with a\r\nslow fever, and even loss of memory.... By its running through whole\r\nfamilies it appeared also to be communicable by infection.\r\n\r\n1783. The influenza also began to appear again; and those who had coughs\r\nlast year began now to be afflicted with them again, the disorder at\r\nlength frequently ending in a consumption. Also dogs in this year and the\r\nnext had running at the eyes and a loss of the use of their hind legs,\r\nwhich in the end killed most of those that were seized with it. Horses\r\nalso suffered.\r\n\r\n1786. In the middle of this season the influenza returned, and colds and\r\ncoughs were epidemical.\r\n\r\n1788 [spring]. A species of influenza of the pestilential kind, akin to\r\nthat of 1782, has almost constantly returned in spring and autumn since\r\nthat time ... [summer] A species of influenza, as in the spring, and it is\r\nalso at Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n1789 [spring]. Influenza returned. Even dogs affected.\r\n\r\n1791.

Royston, “On a Medical Topography,” _Med. and Phys. J._ XXI.\r\n1809, (Dec. 1808), p. 92: “After the unusual heat of the last summer, the\r\nfrequency of intermittents in the autumn was increased in the fens of\r\nCambridgeshire to an almost unprecedented degree; and even quadrupeds were\r\nnot exempt, for distinctly marked cases of _tertian_ were observed in\r\nhorses. In the year 1780 a similar prevalence of this disease occurred in\r\nthe same part; and though in an interval of 28 years many and frequent\r\nsporadic cases have arisen, yet its universality during that period was\r\nsuspended. We have to regret that a correct record of the constitution of\r\nthe year 1780, as applying to this particular district, has not been\r\npreserved in such a manner as to admit of a direct comparison with that of\r\n1808. If it were possible, from authentic documents to compare the history\r\nof these two seasons, much light might be thrown on the obscure cause of\r\nintermittents.” Clarke, of Nottingham, (l. c.) says there were some cases\r\nof irregular ague among a few privates of the regiment there, who had all\r\ncome from a marshy quarter, some of them with the fever on them. The\r\nparoxysms came at unusually long intervals. Bark increased the fever.\r\n\r\n[707] Lecture on Agues, in the _Lond. Med.

Graves, in a clinical lecture upon that of\r\n1837, speaks two or three times of the last as that of 1834, and, in\r\nanother place, he calls it the epidemic of 1833-34. But these, I think,\r\nare mere laxities of dating, of which there are many other instances where\r\nthe date is recent and not yet historical.\r\n\r\n[726] As early as 1612 a proposal had been made to James I. for “a grant\r\nof the general registrarship of all christenings, marriages and burials\r\nwithin this realm.” _State Papers_, Rolls House, Ja.

No. 54.\r\nIt was a device for raising money.\r\n\r\n[727] The account in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ for February, 1837, p.\r\n199, is almost identical with the paragraph in the number for April, 1833:\r\n“An influenza of a peculiar character has been raging throughout the\r\ncountry, and particularly in the Metropolis. It has been attended by\r\ninflammation of the throat and lungs, with violent spasms, sickness and\r\nheadache. So general have been its effects that business in numerous\r\ninstances has been entirely suspended. The greater number of clerks at the\r\nWar Office, Admiralty, Navy Pay Office, Stamp Office, Treasury,\r\nPost-Office and other Government Offices have been prevented from\r\nattending to their daily avocations.... Of the police force there were\r\nupwards of 800 incapable of doing duty. On Sunday the 13th the churches\r\nwhich have generally a full congregation presented a mournful scene &c.\r\n... the number of burials on the same day in the different cemeteries was\r\nnearly as numerous as during the raging of the cholera in 1832 and 1833.\r\nIn the workhouses the number of poor who have died far exceed any return\r\nthat has been made for the last thirty years.”\r\n\r\n[728] Graves, u. s., p. 545.\r\n\r\n[729] Robert Cowan, M.D., _Journ.

One of the new letters related to the death of Colonel\r\nPickering from the camp-sickness among the troops of Fairfax at Ottery St\r\nMary in December, 1645. Carlyle’s comment is: “has caught the epidemic\r\n‘new disease’ as they call it, some ancient _influenza_ very prevalent and\r\nfatal during those wet winter operations.” “New disease” was the name\r\ngiven by Greaves to the war-typhus in Oxfordshire and Berkshire in 1643,\r\nbut neither that nor the sickness at Ottery (which is not called “new\r\ndisease” in the documents) had anything of the nature of influenza.\r\n\r\n[744] But Dr Rose Cormack, who had known relapsing fever well in\r\nEdinburgh, wrote from Putney, near London, in October, 1849: “For some\r\nmonths past the majority of cases of all diseases in this neighbourhood\r\nhave ... presented a well-marked tendency to assume the remittent and\r\nintermittent types.” “Infantile Remittent Fever,” _Lond.

These papers bring together and discuss the Russian\r\nopinions, official and other. The Army Medical Report favoured the view\r\nthat the birthplace of this pandemic in the autumn of 1889 was an\r\nextensive region occupied by nomadic tribes in the northern part of the\r\nKirghiz Steppe. There is evidence of its rapid progress westwards over\r\nTobolsk to the borders of European Russia. Influenza is said to be\r\nconstantly present in many parts of the Russian Empire; but the\r\ncircumstances that have, on four or five occasions in the 19th century,\r\nset the infection rolling in a great wave westwards from the assumed\r\nsource are wholly unknown.\r\n\r\n[748] The collective inquiry on the epidemics was made by the medical\r\ndepartment of the Local Government Board, the result being given in two\r\nreports: _Report on the Influenza Epidemic of 1889-90, Parl. Papers_,\r\n1891, and _Further Report and Papers on Epidemic Influenza, 1889-92, Parl.\r\nPapers_, Sept. 1893. By H. Franklin Parsons, M.D. Statistical tables\r\ncomparing the epidemics in London with those in some other capitals were\r\npublished by F. A. Dixey, M.D., _Epidemic Influenza_, Oxford, 1892.\r\n\r\n[749] The notable difference between the type of this epidemic and that of\r\nthe epidemics of 1833, 1837 and 1847, from which the conventional notion\r\nof “influenza cold” was derived, is perhaps the explanation of the\r\nfollowing apt and erudite remark by Buchanan, on “influenza proper,” in\r\nhis introduction to the first departmental report, 1891: “It would be no\r\nsmall gain to get more authentic methods of identifying influenza proper\r\nfrom among the various grippes, catarrhs, colds and the like--in man,\r\nhorse, and other animals--that take to themselves the same popular title”\r\n(p. xi).\r\n\r\n[750] The volume by Julius Althaus, M.D., _Influenza: its Pathology,\r\nComplications and Sequelae_, 2nd ed., Lond. 1892, includes a summary and\r\nbibliography of recent observations.\r\n\r\n[751] Noah Webster, _Brief History of Epidemick Diseases_, I. 288; Warren,\r\nof Boston, to Lettsom, 30 May, 1790, _Lettsom’s Memoirs_, III. 238:\r\n“whether this [the second] is a variety of influenza, or a new disease\r\nwith us, I am at a loss to determine.”\r\n\r\n[752] In Twysden’s _Decem Scriptores_, col. 579.\r\n\r\n[753] Boyle’s _Works_, 6 vols., London, 1772, V. 52.\r\n\r\n[754] Seneca, _Nat.

Dr Robert Williams, in his work on _Morbid\r\nPoisons_ (II. 670) argues for Webster’s electrical theory of influenza\r\nwithout knowing, or at least without saying, that it was Webster’s. The\r\nmuch-advertised writings of Mr John Parkin on _The Volcanic Theory of\r\nEpidemics_ (or other title) follow Webster very closely both in the main\r\nidea and in its ramifications, but without acknowledgment to the American\r\n_philosophe_. Milton’s rule was that one might take from an old author if\r\none improved upon him; but neither Williams nor Parkin has improved upon\r\nWebster.\r\n\r\n[759] _Ibid._ II. 30.\r\n\r\n[760] “Catalogue of Recorded Earthquakes from 1606 B.C. to A.D. 1850.”\r\n_British Assocn.

The real\r\nsickness of Iceland in those years had been before the volcanic eruptions,\r\nin 1781 and 1782, when some parts of the island were almost depopulated by\r\nthe famine and pestilential fevers that followed the unusual seasons.\r\n\r\n[769] _Phil.

Series of reports\r\nfrom Jamaica collected by Sloane.\r\n\r\n[772] A few cases have been exceptionally seen at Spanish Town, six miles\r\nfrom the head of the bay, the infection of which was supposed to have been\r\nbrought from the shore by sailors, and it has also prevailed in the\r\nbarracks on the high ground of Newcastle not far from the shore.\r\n\r\n[773] Without seeking to argue for the connexion between particular\r\nearthquakes and influenzas, but merely to illustrate the possibilities, I\r\nappend here an instance that ought not to be overlooked. On the 1st of\r\nNovember, 1835, there was a great earthquake in the Moluccas, which so\r\ncompletely changed the soil of the island of Amboina, that it became\r\nnotably subject to deadly miasmatic or malarious fevers from that time\r\nforth. For three weeks before the earthquake the atmosphere had been full\r\nof a heavy sulphurous fog, so that miasmata were rising from the soil by\r\nsome unwonted pressure before the actual cataclysm. There is no doubt at\r\nall that Amboina became “malarious” in a most marked degree from the date\r\nof the earthquake; it is a classical instance of the sudden effect of\r\ngreat changes in the earth’s crust upon the frequency and malignity of\r\nremittent and intermittent fevers, according to the testimony of\r\nphysicians in the Dutch East Indian service. The influenza nearest to the\r\nearthquake was about a year after, at Sydney, Cape Town, and in the East\r\nIndies, during October and November, 1836. The epidemic appeared about the\r\nsame time in the north-east of Europe, spread all over the continent, and\r\nreached London in January, 1837. There was again influenza in Australia\r\nand New Zealand in November, 1838, two years after the last outbreak in\r\nthat region.\r\n\r\n[774] _Phil.

MS., No. 2177.\r\n\r\n[814] The original heading in the Bills of Mortality was “flox and\r\nsmallpox.” “Flox” meant flux, or confluent smallpox, which was so\r\ndistinguished, as if in kind, from the ordinary discrete form, seldom\r\nfatal. Huxham, in 1725, _Phil. Trans._ XXXIII. 379, still used these\r\nterms: “When the pustules broke out in less than twenty-four hours from\r\nthe seizure, they were always of the flux kind, as is commonly\r\nobserved.... Pocks which at first were distinct would flux together during\r\nsuppuration.” Dover, _Physician’s Legacy_, 1732, p. 101, has “the flux\r\nsmallpox, or variolae confluentes,” as one of the varieties: and again,\r\npustules “fluxing in some parts, in others distinct.”\r\n\r\n[815] Having been omitted by Graunt in his table. _Op. cit._ 1662.\r\n\r\n[816] _Cal.

From 1561 to 1600, in every hundred\r\nchildren born, 30·9 died before nine months, on an annual average, and 50\r\nbefore five years. From 1601 to 1700 the ratios were 27·7 under nine\r\nmonths, and 46 before five years. From 1701 to 1760 the deaths under nine\r\nmonths had fallen to 17·2 per cent., and under five years to 33·6 per\r\ncent. (Calculated from a table in the _Bibliothèque Britannique_, Sciences\r\net Arts, IV. 327.) Thus, with an increasing probability of life, the\r\nage-incidence of fatal smallpox may have varied a good deal within the\r\nperiod from 1580 to 1760. It is given by Duvillard separately for the\r\nyears 1700-1783 (inclusive of measles): during which limited period a\r\nsmaller ratio died under nine months, and a larger ratio above the age of\r\nfive years, than in the aggregate of the whole period from 1580 to 1760.\r\nWhatever may have been the rule at Geneva, it cannot be applied to English\r\ntowns; for, while some 30 per cent. of the smallpox deaths were at ages\r\nabove five in the Swiss city (1700-1783), only 12 per cent. were above\r\nfive in English towns such as Chester and Warrington in 1773-4.\r\n\r\n[830] _Pyretologia_, 2 vols.

In the beginning\r\nI lost twenty ounces of blood. He gave me a vomit, but I find by\r\nexperience purging much better. I went abroad, by his direction, till I\r\nwas blind, and then took to my bed. I had no fire allowed in my room, my\r\nwindows were constantly open, my bedclothes were ordered to be laid no\r\nhigher than my waist. He made me take twelve bottles of small beer,\r\nacidulated with spirit of vitriol, every twenty-four hours. I had of this\r\nanomalous kind to a very great degree, yet never lost my senses one\r\nmoment.” _The Ancient Physician’s Legacy._ London, 1732, p. 114.\r\n\r\n[835] _Scotia Illustrata._ Lib.

Therefore let him\r\nbe kept in a room well closed, into which cold air is in no manner to\r\nenter, and let him be sedulously covered up in bed.... I desire the more\r\nto admonish my friends in this matter, for that Robert Cage, esquire, my\r\ndear sister’s husband,” etc.\r\n\r\n[838] Besides cases to show the ill effects of blooding, vomits, purges\r\nand cooling medicines such as spirit of vitriol, he gives examples as if\r\nto refute Sydenham’s favourite notion that salivation, diarrhoea and\r\nmenstrual haemorrhage were relieving or salutary. Morton’s chief object\r\nwas to bring out the eruption, and to get it to maturate kindly; an\r\neruption which languished, or did not rise and fill, was for him the most\r\nuntoward of events. Sydenham, on the other hand, argued that the danger\r\nwas in proportion to the number of pustules and to the total quantity of\r\nmatter contained in them; and he sought, accordingly, to restrain cases\r\nwhich threatened to be confluent by an evacuant treatment or repressive\r\nregimen.\r\n\r\n[839] Walter Lynn, M.B., _A more easy and safe Method of Cure in the\r\nSmallpox founded upon Experiments, and a Review of Dr Sydenham’s Works_,\r\nLond. 1714; _Some Reflections upon the Modern Practice of Physic in\r\nRelation to the Smallpox_, Lond. 1715.

Dr\r\nJames Johnstone, junr., of Worcester, in his _Treatise on the Malignant\r\nAngina_, 1779, p. 78, claims the death of the Duke of Gloucester as from\r\nthat cause, on the evidence of Bishop Kennet’s account.\r\n\r\n[847] In the _Gentleman’s Magazine_, under the dates.\r\n\r\n[848] _A Direct Method of ordering and curing People of that Loathsome\r\nDisease the Smallpox, being the twenty years’ practical experience of John\r\nLamport alias Lampard_, London, 1685. The writer was probably an empiric,\r\n“Practitioner in Chyrurgery and Physick,” dwelling at Havant, and\r\nattending the George at Chichester on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, the\r\nHalf Moon at Petersfield on Saturdays. He says: “One great cause of this\r\ndisease being so mortal in the country is because the infection doth make\r\nmany physicians backward to visit such patients, either for fear of taking\r\nthe disease themselves or transferring the infection to others.” He has\r\nanother fling at the regular faculty: “Do not run madding to Dr Dunce or\r\nhis assistance to be let bloud.” Empirics, although they were commonly\r\nright about blood-letting, were under the suspicion of not speaking the\r\ntruth about their cures.\r\n\r\n[849] Macaulay, _History of England_, IV. 532. The moving passage on the\r\nformer horrors of smallpox, _à propos_ of the death of Queen Mary in 1694,\r\nis familiar to most, but it may be cited once more in the context of a\r\nprofessional history: “That disease, over which science has since achieved\r\na succession of glorious and beneficent victories, was then the most\r\nterrible of all the ministers of death. The havoc of the plague had been\r\nfar more rapid: but plague had visited our shores only once or twice\r\nwithin living memory; and the smallpox was always present, filling the\r\nchurchyards with corpses, tormenting with constant fears all whom it had\r\nnot yet stricken, leaving on those whose lives it spared the hideous\r\ntraces of its power, turning the babe into a changeling at which the\r\nmother shuddered, and making the eyes and cheeks of the betrothed maiden\r\nobjects of horror to the lover.” It is not given to us all to write like\r\nthis; but it is possible that the loss of picturesqueness may be balanced\r\nby a gain of accuracy and correctness.\r\n\r\n[850] Kellwaye, u. s., 1593.\r\n\r\n[851] Dr Richard Holland in 1730 (_A Short View of the Smallpox_, p. 75),\r\nsays: “A lady of distinction told me that she and her three sisters had\r\ntheir faces saved in a bad smallpox by wearing light silk masks during the\r\ndistemper.”\r\n\r\n[852] As I do not intend to come back to the subject of pockmarked faces,\r\nI shall add here that I have found nothing in medical writings of the 18th\r\ncentury, nor in its fiction or memoirs, to show that pockpitting was more\r\nthan an occasional blemish of the countenance. At that time most had\r\nsmallpox in infancy or childhood, when the chances of permanent marking\r\nwould be less. The disappearance of pockpitted faces was discovered long\r\nago. The report of the National Vaccine Board for 1822 says: “We\r\nconfidently appeal to all who frequent theatres and crowded assemblies to\r\nadmit that they do not discover in the rising generation any longer that\r\ndisfigurement of the human face which was obvious everywhere some years\r\nsince.” The members of this board were probably seniors who remembered the\r\n18th century; and it is quite true that the first quarter of the 19th\r\ncentury was singularly free from smallpox in England except in the\r\nepidemic of 1817-19. But the above passage became stereotyped in the\r\nreports: exactly the same phrase, appealing to what they all remembered\r\n“some years since,” was used in the report for 1825, a year which had more\r\nsmallpox in London than any since the 18th century, and again in the\r\nreport for 1837, the first year of an epidemic which caused forty thousand\r\ndeaths in England and Wales. These stereotyped reminiscences are apt to be\r\nas lasting a blemish as the pockholes themselves.\r\n\r\n[853] Collinson, _Hist. of Somerset_, III. 226, citing Aubrey’s\r\n_Miscellanies_, 33.\r\n\r\n[854] Blomefield, _Hist. of Norfolk_, III. 417.\r\n\r\n[855] Thoresby, _Ducatus Leodiensis_, ed.

The disease was measles; it was scarlet fever; it was\r\nspotted fever; it was erysipelas.... Radcliffe’s opinion proved to be\r\nright.” There had been some doubt on the first appearance of the eruption\r\nwhether it would turn to measles or smallpox. Sydenham says that it was\r\noften difficult to make the diagnosis at that stage, and in the queen’s\r\ncase the first signs were anomalous as well. Next day, however, the\r\neruption all over the body became “smallpox in its proper and distinct\r\nform.” But it did not long remain so; the livid spots, into which the\r\npustules subsided, again raised doubts in the minds of some of the\r\nphysicians whether it was not measles after all; and there was undoubtedly\r\nerysipelas of the face. Harris took the middle course of diagnosing\r\n“smallpox and measles mingled,” a name by which the form that we now call\r\nhaemorrhagic smallpox had been known from the early part of the\r\nseventeenth century. It was at this late and ominous stage of the illness\r\nthat Radcliffe was called in; it is not correct to say, as the historian\r\nsays, that he was the first to pronounce “the more alarming name of\r\nsmallpox.” The diagnosis was then a matter of little moment, for the queen\r\nwas dying. He declared that “her majesty was a dead woman, for it was\r\nimpossible to do any good in her case when remedies had been given that\r\nwere so contrary to the nature of her distemper; yet he would endeavour to\r\ndo all that lay in his power to give her ease.” (Munk’s _Roll of the\r\nCollege of Physicians_, II. 458.) For some unexplained reason Radcliffe\r\nwas made to bear the blame of the queen’s death, an accusation which he\r\ndeserved as little as he deserved the credit given him by the historian of\r\nhaving been the only physician to make the correct diagnosis.\r\n\r\nMacaulay is equally unfortunate in his remark that smallpox “was then the\r\nmost terrible of all the ministers of death,” in his comparison of it to\r\nplague, and in his rhetoric generally. The haemorrhagic form, of which the\r\nqueen died, was rare. Dover adds it as a fourth variety, but admits that\r\nhe had seen only five cases of it. Ferguson, of Aberdeen, as late as 1808,\r\nin a paper on measles (_Med. and Phys. Journal_, XXI. 359), described a\r\nhaemorrhagic case of smallpox which he once saw, without knowing that it\r\nwas a recognized variety of smallpox at all. However terrible a minister\r\nof death smallpox may sometimes have been, it happened that there was\r\ncomparatively little of it in London during the period covered by\r\nMacaulay’s history; and it certainly did not “fill the churchyards,” as he\r\nmight have found out by referring to that not altogether recondite source,\r\nthe bills of mortality. From 1694 to 1700 fevers caused three and a half\r\ntimes more deaths than smallpox. In the year 1696, when “the distress of\r\nthe common people was severe,” the smallpox deaths in London were 196, or\r\nabout one-hundredth part of the mortality from all causes.\r\n\r\n[864] Blomefield, III. 432. The following are two cases from the London\r\nepidemic of 1710: June, 15.--“Lord Ashburnham’s brother has the smallpox,\r\nand the first, concluding he had had it, went to him, and now himself very\r\nill of them. Doctor Garth, who says none has them twice, examined the\r\nservants, and they tell him he was but six days ill then; so he concludes\r\nthat was not the smallpox.” _Cal. Belvoir MSS._, II. 190.\r\n\r\n[865] Lynn, u. s. He recalls a remark made by a writer in 1710 that the\r\nseverity of that epidemic “was not due to a peculiar state of the air, but\r\nto a defect in some of our great physicians, who, being too fully\r\nemployed, could not give due attendance to all or even to any of their\r\npatients through the multiplicity of them: for want of which, and the\r\nseverity of their injunctions, which hindered others from applying\r\nanything in their absence, many persons were lost who might otherwise have\r\nbeen saved with due care.”\r\n\r\n[866] John Woodward, M.D., _The State of Physick and Diseases, with an\r\ninquiry into the causes of the late increase of them, but more\r\nparticularly of the Smallpox; with some considerations on the new practice\r\nof purging in that disease_.

He saw Timoni at Constantinople on his return from the\r\nCaucasus. Timoni used “a three-edged surgeon’s needle,” which is more\r\nintelligible than three needles tied together. La Motraye’s travellers’\r\ntales have not enjoyed the best credit. But this of the inoculation in\r\nCircassia has been made by Voltaire the sole basis of his spirited account\r\nof inoculation as the national practice of that country (_Lettres sur les\r\nAnglais_, Lettre XI. “Sur l’insertion de la petite-vérole,” 1727,\r\nreprinted as the article “Inoculation” in his _Dict. Philosophique_,\r\n1764). There has never been a grosser instance of a myth constructed in\r\ncold blood. The fable does not need refutation because it is mere\r\nassertion, in the manner of a _philosophe_. But the British ambassador at\r\nConstantinople made inquiries concerning the alleged Georgian or\r\n“Circassian” practice in 1755, at the instance of Maty, the foreign\r\nsecretary of the Royal Society (_Phil. Trans._ XLIX. 104). A Capuchin\r\nfriar, “a grave sober man” who had returned shortly before from a sixteen\r\nyears’ residence in Georgia and “gives an account of the virtues and\r\nvices, good and evil, of that country with plainness and candour,”\r\nsolemnly declared to Mr Porter that he never heard of inoculation “at\r\nAkalsike, Imiritte or Tiflis,” and was persuaded that it had never been\r\nknown in the Caucasus. It was impossible that either the public or private\r\npractice of inoculation could have been concealed from him, as he went in\r\nand out among the people practising physic. He had often attended them in\r\nthe smallpox, which, he said, was unusually severe there. On the other\r\nhand La Motraye says: “I found the Circassians becoming more beautiful as\r\nwe penetrated into the mountains. As I saw no one marked with the\r\nsmallpox, it occurred to me to ask if they had any secret to protect them\r\nfrom the ravages which this enemy of beauty makes among all nations. They\r\ntold me, Yes; and gave me to understand that it was inoculating, or\r\ncommunicating it to those whom they wished to preserve by taking the\r\nmatter from one who had it and mixing the same with the blood at incisions\r\nwhich they made. On this I resolved to see the operation, if it were\r\npossible, and made inquiry in every village that we passed through if\r\nthere was anyone about to have it done. I soon found an opportunity in a\r\nvillage named Degliad, where I heard that they were going to inoculate a\r\nyoung girl of four or five years old just as we were passing.” This was\r\npublished fifteen years after, Timoni’s account being given in an\r\nAppendix.\r\n\r\n[884] _Travels_, IV. 484.

Again (_Sketch of a Plan, &c._, 1793, p.\r\n491), “They neither feared it nor shunned it.

This was written at a\r\ntime when the novelty of inoculation had passed off, and may be taken as\r\nFreind’s mature opinion. Douglass, of Boston, writing in 1730, implies\r\nthat Freind’s objections had been overcome; which may mean no more than he\r\nsays in general: “Yet from repeated tryals the Anti-Inoculators do now\r\nacknowledge that inoculation, generally speaking, is a more easy way of\r\nundergoing the smallpox.” Condamine, in his French essay of 1755, counts\r\nFreind among the original supporters of inoculation, and ridicules the\r\nopposition to it. Munk, in citing the title of Wagstaffe’s _Letter to Dr\r\nFreind showing the danger and uncertainty of Inoculating the Smallpox_\r\n(London, 1722), omits the words “to Dr Freind,” at the same time\r\ndescribing the pamphlet as “specious.” There seems no reason to doubt that\r\nFreind shared Wagstaffe’s views.\r\n\r\n[898] Hecquet, of Paris, who is supposed to have been the original of Dr\r\nSangrado in ‘Gil Bias,’ gave the following reasons against inoculation\r\n(_Raisons de doutes contre l’Inoculation_): “Its antiquity is not\r\nsufficiently ascertained: the operation rests upon false facts: it is\r\nunjust, void of art, destitute of rules: ... it doth not prevent the\r\nnatural smallpox: ... it bears no likeness to physic, and savours strongly\r\nof magic.”\r\n\r\n[899] James Jurin, M.D., _Account of the Success of Inoculation_, 1724, p.\r\n3.\r\n\r\n[900] G.

He became a schoolmaster at Newcastle, where he also gave\r\nscientific lectures. Coming to London, with a Leyden medical degree, he\r\ndevoted himself to the Newtonian mathematics and was made one of the\r\nsecretaries of the Royal Society, Newton being the president. He was one\r\nof the original physicians of the new hospital founded in the Borough by\r\nGuy, the rich bookseller. He made a fortune by medical practice, and was\r\nelected president of the College of Physicians a few weeks before he died.\r\nIn medicine his name is associated with the inoculation statistics, the\r\nidea of which, as well as most of the substance, he got from Nettleton,\r\nand with “Jurin’s Lixivium Lithontripticum,” or solvent for the stone, the\r\nidea of which belonged originally to Mrs Johanna Stevens, and was sold by\r\nher to the State for five thousand pounds on the 16th of June, 1739, the\r\nprescriptions having been made public in the _London Gazette_ of 19th\r\nJune. On the 15th of December, 1744, Jurin was called to see the Earl of\r\nOrford (Sir Robert Walpole), who was suffering from stone, either renal or\r\nvesical. He began administering his alkaline solvent, “four times stronger\r\nthan the strongest capital soap-lye,” and during the six weeks of his\r\nattendance had given his patient thirty-six ounces of it. Horace Walpole\r\nmade him angry by arguing on the medicine: “It is of so great violence\r\nthat it is to split a stone when it arrives at it, and yet it is to do no\r\ndamage to all the tender intestines through which it must first pass. I\r\ntold him I thought it was like an admiral going on a secret expedition of\r\nwar with instructions which are not to be opened till he arrives in such a\r\nlatitude.” (_Letters of Horace Walpole_, Cunningham, I. 339.) His services\r\nwere at length dispensed with, and the earl, whose case was probably\r\nhopeless before, died in a few weeks. A war of pamphlets followed, Ranby,\r\nthe serjeant-surgeon, maintaining that the patient had “died of the\r\nlixivium.” Mead, also, expressed himself strongly upon the attempt to use\r\na modification of Mrs Stevens’s solvent.\r\n\r\n[905] The fatalities are given somewhat fully in Jurin’s annual accounts\r\nof the _Success of Inoculation_, 1723-27.\r\n\r\n[906] John Wreden, body-surgeon to the Prince of Wales, author of _An\r\nEssay on the Inoculation of the Smallpox_ (Lond. 1779), may also be\r\ncounted among those who gave a more real smallpox.

T. Prince, _Gent. Magaz._ Sept. 1753, p. 414. The\r\nepidemic attacked 5545 (in a population of 15,684), and cut off 569. The\r\nnumbers inoculated were 2124 (including 139 negroes), of which number 30\r\ndied and were included in the total of 569. Many of the inoculated, says\r\nPrince, were not careful to avoid catching the infection in the natural\r\nway; “for I have known some, as soon as inoculated, receive visits from\r\ntheir friends, who had been with the sick of the same disease and ’tis\r\nlikely carried infection with them; it seems highly probable that the\r\ninoculated received the infection from them into their vitals.” It may be\r\nsupposed that the inoculated who were more careful formed a part of the\r\n1843 who “moved out of town.” More than a third of the population took\r\nnatural smallpox in some four months (April to July) of 1752, more than a\r\nthird had had it before, a severe epidemic having occurred in 1730 as well\r\nas in 1721.\r\n\r\n[914] Clinch, _Rise and Progress of the Smallpox, with an Appendix to\r\nprove that Inoculation is no Security from the Natural Smallpox_. 2nd ed.\r\n1725.\r\n\r\n[915] C.

But it does\r\nnot appear that Boerhaave ever tried to get rid of the eruption of\r\nsmallpox by means of drugs. In the chapter of his _Aphorisms_, “De\r\nVariolis” (§ 1392) he says that he imagines a specific might be found, in\r\nthe class of antidotes, to correct and destroy the variolous virus,\r\nindicating antimony and mercury as likely agents for the purpose owing to\r\ncertain physical properties of the medicinal preparations of them. Ruston\r\n(_An Essay on Inoculation_, 3rd ed. 1768) says that Boerhaave, who died in\r\n1738, “never practised it himself; nor seems to have understood the manner\r\nin which these medicines operate to produce their salutary effects.”\r\nHowever they were known as the Boerhaavian antidotes to smallpox, and were\r\nused in Rhode Island, it is said with great success and as a secret.\r\nRuston used them in England, and discovered by an analysis that Sutton’s\r\nsecret powders were the same. They seem also to have been used by Cheyne\r\nto prevent the development of smallpox in persons who had been exposed to\r\ncontagion and had presumably taken the contagion. Frewen, in 1759,\r\npublished a pamphlet to show the improbability of antimony and mercury\r\nhaving any such action, and the fallacy of the claims made for their\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n[927] The Duchess gave the following account of her own case (_Gent.\r\nMagaz._ Nov. 1765, p. 495, sent by Gatti to a friend in London): “On the\r\n12th of March, 1763, I was inoculated for the smallpox, and about four or\r\nfive days afterwards a redness appeared round the orifice, which Mons.\r\nGatti called an inflammation, and assured me was a sign that the smallpox\r\nhad taken effect: these were the very terms he used. The redness or\r\ninflammation increased every day, and about the seventh or eighth day, the\r\nwound began to suppurate. There appeared also about the wound six small\r\nrisings, or pimples, which successively suppurated and disappeared the\r\nnext day. Mons. Gatti, upon their appearance, again assured me that the\r\nsmallpox had taken effect. In the afternoon of the eleventh or twelfth day\r\nof my inoculation I felt a general uneasiness and emotion, a pain in my\r\nhead and my back, and about my heart, in consequence of which I went to\r\nbed sooner than ordinary. I slept well, however, and rose without any\r\ndisorder in the morning. These symptoms Mons. Gatti assured me were the\r\nforerunners of the eruption. The next day a pretty large rising or pimple\r\nappeared in my forehead, turned white, and then died away, leaving a mark\r\nwhich continued many days.\r\n\r\n“The wound in my arm continued to suppurate seven or eight days, and Mons.\r\nGatti now assured me that I had nothing to fear from the smallpox; and\r\nupon this assurance I relied without the least doubt, and continued in\r\nperfect confidence of my security till the natural smallpox appeared. I\r\ncontinued very well during the whole time of my inoculation, except one\r\nday, as mentioned above, and I went out every day.\r\n\r\n  “Monmorency, D. de Boufflers.”\r\n\r\n[928] Gibbon’s _Autobiography_. It was to Dr Maty that Gibbon, in 1759,\r\nsubmitted his French essay on the Study of Literature, having had a fair\r\ncopy of it transcribed by one of the French prisoners at Petersfield. Of\r\nMaty he says: “His reputation was justly founded on the eighteen volumes\r\nof the _Journal Britannique_, which he had supported almost alone, with\r\nperseverance and success. This humble though useful labour, which had once\r\nbeen dignified by the genius of Bayle and the learning of Le Clerc, was\r\nnot disgraced by the taste, the knowledge and the judgment of Maty.”\r\n\r\n[929] Angelo Gatti, M.D., _New Observations on Inoculation_.

I attended one in a very full smallpox,\r\nwhich ran through all its stages in the usual manner; yet this patient had\r\nbeen inoculated ten years before, and, on the 5th day after inoculation,\r\nbegan to be feverish, with a headache, followed by a slight eruption,\r\nwhich eruption soon went off without coming to suppuration; the place of\r\ninoculation had inflamed and remained open ten days, leaving a deep scar,\r\nwhich I saw.” William Heberden, Senr., M.D., _Commentaries on Disease_ (p.\r\n436).

Whenever this has been supposed to have\r\nhappened, I am certain the operation has failed, which not being\r\ndiscovered by the operator, proves to me that he was not experienced in\r\nthe practice; for it may always be determined in four, five, or six days,\r\nsometimes sooner; and if there is the least reason to doubt, it is very\r\neasy to inoculate a second, third or fourth time, which may be done\r\nwithout the least inconvenience.

The ages are in\r\nthe original communication of the Rev. Mr Wasse, among the MS. papers\r\nwhich Jurin had deposited with the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n[996] The most singular thing in the Aynho experience is that there should\r\nhave been no cases in infants under two years. It was observed, however,\r\nsome two generations after this, that smallpox attacked children at the\r\nearliest ages in the great towns (Haygarth, _Sketch of a Plan, &c._, 1793,\r\np. 31), and even in the worst conditions of infancy it has attacked\r\nrelatively few in the first three months of life. Again, it is nearly as\r\nremarkable that there should have been only three cases at Aynho in the\r\nthird year of life and only four in the fourth. However, the fewness of\r\ncases in the five first years of life must be taken as exceptional, even\r\nfor a village epidemic. If Nettleton, who made the first of these censuses\r\nof smallpox epidemics and suggested to Jurin that they should be carried\r\nout elsewhere, had given the ages, he would certainly have included some\r\nin infancy, for he mentions, in the course of his inoculation experiences,\r\nparticular cases at nine months, eighteen months, etc.\r\n\r\n[997] Frewen, _Phil.

(Jan. 1752), p. 333.\r\n\r\n[1014] The weekly average deaths for eight weeks of September and October\r\nis 30·5 from two to five years and 11·1 from five to ten, which are about\r\nhalf the average at each age period during the maximum prevalence of\r\nsmallpox.\r\n\r\n[1015] W. Black, M.D. (_Observations Medical and Political on the\r\nSmallpox, etc._ London, 1781, p. 100) says: “I am induced by various\r\nconsiderations to believe that whatever share of smallpox mortality takes\r\nplace in London amongst persons turned of twenty years of age, is almost\r\nsolely confined to the new annual settlers or recruits, who are necessary\r\nto repair the waste of London, and the majority of whom arrive in the\r\ncapital from twenty to forty years of age.”\r\n\r\n[1016] Maddox, bishop of Worcester, preaching a sermon in 1752 for the\r\nSmallpox and Inoculation Charity, enforced his pleading by relating the\r\nrecent case of “a poor man sick of this distemper, of which his wife lay\r\ndead in the same room, with four children around her catching the dreadful\r\ninfection, but destitute of all relief, till they found _some_ in that too\r\nnarrow building which now importunately begs your compassionate bounty to\r\nenlarge its dimensions.”\r\n\r\n[1017] The _Gent. Magaz._ Sept. 1752, p. 402, contains a long letter to\r\nrefute the very prevailing notion among many people that there is very\r\nlittle occasion for doctors and apothecaries in smallpox, but that a good\r\nnurse is all the assistance that is usually wanted. “Whence this notion\r\ntook its rise I cannot conceive, unless it was from the disease being\r\nvisible, so that every one who has been at all used to it knows it when\r\nthey see it.”\r\n\r\n[1018] This was an argument used in the first writings on Inoculation, so\r\nas to prove the real hazard of dying by the natural smallpox. Thus,\r\nMaitland in his _Vindication_ of 1722, which Arbuthnot is said to have had\r\na hand in, deducts a quarter of the annual London deaths before he begins\r\nto estimate the ratio of smallpox among them, for the reason that eight\r\nout of nine infants who die in their first year are “non-entities” _quâ_\r\nsmallpox, other causes of death having had the priority (p. 19). Jurin\r\nused the same argument for the same purpose in his _Letter to Caleb\r\nCotesworth, M.D._, 1723, p. 11: “It is notorious that great numbers,\r\nespecially of young children, die of other diseases without ever having\r\nthe smallpox”; and again, “very young children, or at most not above one\r\nor two years of age,” including the stillborn, abortives and overlaid,\r\nchrisoms and infants, and those dead of convulsions. “It is true, indeed,\r\nthat in all probability some small part of these must have gone through\r\nthe smallpox, and therefore ought not to be deducted out of the account”;\r\nbut he does deduct 386 in every 1000 London deaths before he estimates the\r\nratio of smallpox deaths, which so comes out 2 in 17.\r\n\r\n[1019] Percival, _Med.

In his\r\n_Second Letter to Thomas Prior, Esq._ 1746 (in _Works_. 4 vols.

I maintained, as an original opinion,\r\nthat the true affinity of cowpox was to the great pox of man, and that the\r\noccasional cases of so-called vaccinal syphilis were not due to the\r\ncontamination of cowpox with venereal virus but to inherent (although\r\nmostly latent) properties of the cowpox virus itself. This opinion was at\r\nfirst received with incredulity, but is now looked upon with more favour.\r\nSee Hutchinson, _Archives of Surgery_, Oct. 1889, and Jan. 1891, p. 215.\r\nThe concessions hitherto made are only for cases that have arisen since my\r\nbook was published, such as the case at the Leeds Infirmary in 1889.

C. Jenner, _Monthly Magazine_, 1799, p.\r\n671, in reply to Dr Turton, of Swansea: “It is possible that variolous\r\nvirus inserted into the nipples of a cow, might produce inflammation and\r\nsuppuration, and that matter from such a source might produce some local\r\naffection on the human subject by inoculation. But all this tends only to\r\nshow, what was well known before, that virus taken from one ulcer is\r\ncapable of producing another by its being inserted into any other part of\r\nthe body.”\r\n\r\n[1082] Jenner, _Further Observations on the Variolae Vaccinae_, 1799.\r\n\r\n[1083] Thornton, in Beddoes’ _Contributions to Physical and Medical\r\nKnowledge_.

William Woodville, M.D., _Reports of a\r\nSeries of Inoculations for the Variolae Vaccinae or Cowpox; with remarks\r\non this disease considered as a substitute for the Smallpox_. London,\r\n1799. In a subsequent letter (_Med. Phys. Journ._ V., Dec. 1800), he thus\r\nexplained the occurrence of smallpox among those recently inoculated with\r\ncowpox: “If a person who has been exposed to the contagion of smallpox for\r\nfour or five days be then inoculated for this disease, the inoculation\r\nprevents the effects of the contagion, and the _inoculated_ smallpox is\r\nproduced. But if the vaccine inoculation be employed in a case thus\r\ncircumstanced, the smallpox is not prevented, although the tumour produced\r\nby the cowpox inoculation advance to maturation. It was not before the\r\ncommencement of the present year [1800], that I ascertained that the\r\ncowpox had not the power of superseding the smallpox. For, though from the\r\nfirst trials that I made of the new inoculation it appeared that these\r\ndiseases, as produced in the same subject from inoculation, did not\r\ninterrupt the progress of each other; yet as the casual does not act in\r\nthe same manner as the inoculated smallpox, and may be anticipated by the\r\nlatter, I thought it still probable that the cowpock infection might have\r\na similar effect. Numerous facts have, however, proved this opinion to be\r\nunfounded, and that the variolous effluvia, even after the vaccine\r\ninoculation has made a considerable progress, have in several instances\r\noccasioned an eruption resembling that of smallpox.”\r\n\r\n[1086] _European Magazine_, XLIII. 137.\r\n\r\n[1087] Bateman, u. s. 1819, Aug.-Nov. 1807: “In a court adjoining Shoe\r\nLane, in the course of one month, twenty-eight persons had died of\r\nsmallpox.” Autumn, 1812: “In one small court in Shoe Lane, seventeen have\r\nlately been cut off by this variolous plague.” Also in the summer of 1812,\r\n“perhaps universally through the metropolis.”\r\n\r\n[1088] Extracted from the Annual Reports of the Dispensary.\r\n\r\n[1089] Heysham to Joshua Milne, in the latter’s _Treatise on the Valuation\r\nof Annuities_.

The object of\r\nthe paper appears to be to confuse the issues with a view to a verdict of\r\n_non liquet_. The _Edinburgh Review_ thought Thomson’s book on the\r\nepidemic of 1817-19 important enough for an article, which has been\r\nattributed to Jeffrey. The article pronounced vaccination to be a very\r\ngreat blessing to mankind, but not a complete protection. This was not\r\nenough for Jenner, who wrote of the article: “It will do incalculable\r\nmischief: I put it down at 100,000 deaths at least.”\r\n\r\n[1108] John Green Cross, _A History of the Variolous Epidemic which\r\noccurred in Norwich in the year 1819_.

In some other years of the latter half of the 18th century there\r\nwere one or two deaths from that cause. There must have been some special\r\nreason for the four deaths in 1761. According to Massey (_supra_, p. 545),\r\nthe apothecary in the beginning of the 18th century, not one death\r\nhappened in forty attacks, the ages from five to eighteen being the most\r\nfavourable of all for smallpox to fall in. In the present century\r\nscarlatina has displaced smallpox as an infectious cause of death in that\r\nschool as in others.

In the report\r\nfor 1796, when smallpox matter was in use, it is said that “173 were\r\ninoculated, all of whom, soliciting little medical assistance, recovered.”\r\nIn 1801, when cowpox matter had been substituted in every case, the same\r\nphrase is used: “We seldom find any medical assistance required in this\r\ndisease.”\r\n\r\n[1126] _The Beneficial Effects of Inoculation._ Oxford University Prize\r\nPoem. Oxford, 1807. It seems probable that this was the “Oxford copy of\r\nverses on the two Suttons” that Coleridge (_Biographia Literaria_ (1817),\r\nPickering’s ed. II. 89) professed to quote from in the following passage;\r\nat least it would be remarkable if there had been printed another Oxford\r\npoem on the same subject and in the same manner: “As little difficulty do\r\nwe find in excluding from the honours of unaffected warmth and elevation\r\nthe madness prepense of pseudopoesy, or the startling hysteric of weakness\r\nover-exerting itself, which bursts on the unprepared reader in sundry odes\r\nand apostrophes to abstract terms. Such are the Odes to Jealousy, to Hope,\r\nto Oblivion, and the like, in Dodsley’s collection and the magazines of\r\nthe day, which seldom fail to remind me of an Oxford copy of verses on the\r\ntwo Suttons, commencing with\r\n\r\n  ‘Inoculation, heavenly maid! descend!’”\r\n\r\nIt appears that Coleridge himself contemplated a poem on Cowpox\r\nInoculation, which was to have exemplified what poetry should be, just as\r\nthe 18th century Oxford poem on Smallpox Inoculation exemplified what\r\npoetry should not be. It was clearly more than the difference ’twixt\r\ntweedle-dum and tweedle-dee. Writing to Dr Jenner on 27 Sept. 1811, from\r\n7, Portland-place, Hammersmith, he said: “Dear Sir, I take the liberty of\r\nintruding on your time, first, to ask you where and in what publication I\r\nshall find the best and fullest history of the vaccine matter as the\r\npreventive of the smallpox. I mean the year in which the thought first\r\nsuggested itself to you (and surely no honest heart would suspect me of\r\nthe baseness of flattery if I had said, inspired into you by the\r\nAll-preserver, as a counterpoise to the crushing weight of this unexampled\r\nwar), and the progress of its realization to the present day. My motives\r\nare twofold: first and principally, the time is now come when the\r\n‘Courier’ ... is open and prepared for a series of essays on this subject;\r\nand the only painful thought that will mingle with the pleasure with which\r\nI shall write them is, that it should be at this day, and in this the\r\nnative country of the discoverer and the discovery, be even _expedient_ to\r\nwrite at all on the subject. My second motive is more selfish. I have\r\nplanned a poem on this theme, which after long deliberation, I have\r\nconvinced myself is capable in the highest degree of being poetically\r\ntreated, according to our divine bard’s [Milton’s] own definition of\r\npoetry, as ‘_simple_, _sensuous_, (i.e. appealing to the senses by\r\nimagery, sweetness of sound, &c.) and _impassioned, &c._’” _The Life of\r\nEdward Jenner, M.D._ By John Baron, M.D. 2 vols.

Great prejudice prevailed\r\nagainst vaccination, in consequence of the parish having some years ago\r\nbeen vaccinated by a gentleman who knew nothing of the matter, and\r\ncontaminated the people with decomposed virus, when it was good for\r\nnothing but to make ulcers and produced very wretched arms, and left them\r\nall liable to smallpox, which they were all inoculated for the same year.”\r\nThis clergyman subsequently vaccinated 500 cases, and the parish surgeon\r\n300: “and here,” says the former, “I had the happiness of seeing the\r\nplague and destruction of a most horrid smallpox completely stopped.”\r\n\r\n[1134] Robert Ferguson, M.D. _A Letter to Sir Henry Halford, proposing a\r\nmethod of Inoculating the Smallpox, which deprives it of all its Danger,\r\nbut preserves all its Power of Preventing a Second Attack._ London, 1825.\r\n\r\n[1135] John Roberton, _Observations on the Mortality and Physical\r\nManagement of Children_.

(2) It is\r\nnot fact, but conjecture, that a person successfully re-vaccinated is less\r\nliable to smallpox than he was before.

Med._ 3rd ed. (1675), Bk. IV. chap. 5.\r\n\r\n[1189] Sydenham, _Obs. Med._ 1675, V. 3. “Morbilli anni 1674.” It entered\r\nalmost every household, as on the last occasion, attacking infants more\r\nespecially. It had some points of difference from the measles of 1670. The\r\nrash was less uniformly on the fourth day, now sooner, now later; it would\r\ncome on the arms or trunk before the face; nor was it followed by the\r\nbranny powdering which was as obvious in the measles of 1670 as it was\r\nusual to see it after scarlatina. Along with these anomalies of the rash,\r\nthe consecutive fever and peripneumonia were also more severe, and a more\r\nfrequent cause of death. But in the principal characters of measles the\r\ndisease of 1674 was the same as that of 1670, and called for no fresh\r\ndescription. Among Sydenham’s patients were the children of the Countess\r\nof Salisbury, who all took measles in turn, and all passed through the\r\nattack and its sequelae without danger, under a particular regimen which\r\nis detailed. It is of great interest to see how this season of anomalous\r\nmeasles looks in the weekly bills, as in the above table.\r\n\r\n[1190] Richard Morton, M.D. _Pyretologia._ 2 vols. Lond. 1692-94, I. 427.\r\nHe places it in the year 1672 and in the six months of autumn and winter;\r\nand in another place (II. 71), where he cites clinical cases, he again\r\ngives the year 1672 as that in which measles “epidemice Londini publice\r\ngrassabantur.” He compares the epidemic to a _pestis mitior_, and says\r\nthat the disease had never been epidemic again to the date of his writing\r\n(1692-94). It is tolerably clear that, in writing twenty years after, he\r\nhad forgotten the year and even the season--not the only error in dates in\r\nhis work. Sydenham’s account of the great measles epidemic of spring and\r\nsummer, 1674, was published the year after, and is exactly borne out by\r\nthe weekly bills of mortality. Morton’s obvious mistake of the date is the\r\nsubject of a refutation four pages long by Thomas Dickson, M.D., F.R.S.,\r\nphysician to the London Hospital, in _Med. Obs. and Inquiries_, IV.\r\n(1771), p. 266.\r\n\r\n[1191] Fothergill (_Gentleman’s Magazine_, Dec. 1751) says, in a criticism\r\nof the Bills of Mortality: “If the body is emaciated, which may happen\r\neven from an acute fever, ’tis enough for them to place it to the article\r\nof consumption.” And of course they would do so the more readily if the\r\nacute fever, say measles, were past, and its sequelae had been the cause\r\nof death. Referring to Kidderminster in 1756, Johnstone says: “Measles at\r\nthis time went through our town and neighbourhood: vast numbers of\r\nchildren died tabid.” It is to be remarked that the fever column is\r\naugmented but little during the measles of 1674, a fact which shows that\r\nthe inflammatory causes of death, such as capillary bronchitis and\r\npneumonia (specially recorded by Sydenham for this epidemic), were more\r\napt to be entered under “consumption” than under “fevers.”\r\n\r\n[1192] See Watson’s account of smallpox following measles at the Foundling\r\nHospital, _supra_, p. 550.\r\n\r\n[1193] It may have been this high mortality that Dover had in mind when he\r\nwrote, in 1733: “I do not remember I ever heard of anyone’s dying of this\r\ndisease [measles] till about twenty-five years since; but of late, by the\r\nhelp of Gascoin’s powder and bezoartic bolusses, together with blisters\r\nand a hot regimen, the blood is so highly inflamed and the fever encreased\r\nto that degree that it is become equally mortal with the smallpox.”\r\n_Physician’s Legacy_, 1733, p. 116.\r\n\r\n[1194] Memorial to the House of Commons, _supra_, p. 84.\r\n\r\n[1195] _Edin.

Stark, a former Superintendent of Statistics for Scotland (_Rep.\r\nReg. Gen. Scot. for 1856_, p. xxxviii), has raised the question thus: “The\r\ncauses of this greater liability of the female sex to death while\r\nsuffering from whooping-cough are worthy of being investigated. So far as\r\none’s own limited experience goes, it would appear to be produced by the\r\ngreater tendency which the female sex exhibits to have fits or convulsions\r\nwhen attacked by a paroxysm or fit of coughing in that disease.”\r\n\r\n[1243] _Changes in the Air, &c. ... in Barbadoes._ Lond. 1760.\r\n\r\n[1244] In the Irish Decennial Summary for 1871-80 (_Suppl. to 17th Report\r\nof Reg.-Gen.

A comparison of the figures in Table XV. does not point to\r\nany very close relationship.

Hecker\r\nfinds in the malady described by Douglass the form of _Frieselbräune_, or\r\nmiliary diphtheria, a somewhat rare and sporadic malady; in the account by\r\nBard, he finds _häutige Brandbräune_, or membranous angina maligna; while\r\nhe finds in an account by Chalmers for Charleston, S. Carolina, in 1770, a\r\nthird variety, _Friesel-Scharlachbräune_, or miliary scarlet angina.\r\nAgain, Jaffe finds in the account by Bard “many analogies with the\r\ndiphtheria of our own day.” Hirsch identifies the throat-distemper of\r\nDouglass and Colden as “exquisite scarlet fever” and the disease described\r\nby Bard as diphtheria. Häser identifies the epidemic described by Douglass\r\nas diphtheria. Bard himself did not doubt that the disease which he saw in\r\nNew York previous to 1771 was the same that Douglass saw at Boston in\r\n1735-36. Hecker, _Geschichte der neueren Heilkunde_. Bk.

At the other end of the century, Willan (_Cutaneous Diseases_,\r\n1808, p. 333), said of fever in 1786: “The title ‘angina maligna’ would\r\nhave applied with equal, if not with more propriety, to the sore-throat\r\nconnected with a different species of contagion, namely, that of the\r\ntyphus or malignant fever originating in the habitations of the poor where\r\nno attention is paid to cleanliness or ventilation.”\r\n\r\n[1287] Francis Penrose, _A Dissertation on the Inflammatory, Gangrenous\r\nand Putrid Sore-Throat.

(1772), Nov. p. 541: “The measles have lately been\r\nvery rife and fatal in this metropolis. They are of a very different kind\r\nfrom those described by the great Doctor Sydenham, being of a malignant\r\nputrid nature, such as visited London in 1763 and 1768, where bleeding\r\nseemed of so little service, but small doses of emetic tartar, cordial\r\nmedicines and blisters, were very efficacious. The above disorder was\r\nepidemic at Plymouth and parts adjacent in the years 1745 and 1750, and so\r\nlong since as the year 1762 [1672] was described by Dr Morton, who says it\r\nraged so severely during the autumn of that year that it appeared like a\r\ngentle kind of plague, sparing neither sex nor age, and that 300 died\r\nweekly of it.”\r\n\r\n[1292] W.

London,\r\n1779; preface dated 1st January.\r\n\r\n[1301] Withering was perhaps too desirous to be thought the first in\r\nEngland to have described scarlatina anginosa. “The scarlet fever in its\r\nsimple state,” he says, “is not a very uncommon disease in England, but\r\nits combination with a sore-throat, as described above, the violence of\r\nits attack, and the train of fatal symptoms that follow, are circumstances\r\nhitherto unnoticed by English writers.” It is probable from this that he\r\nhad not seen Levison’s essay, with preface dated 11 May, 1778, his own\r\nbeing dated 1 January, 1779; but Cotton’s essay of 1749 actually bore the\r\nname of scarlet fever on its title-page, and described the\r\nthroat-affection, glandular swellings, and the like quite correctly.\r\n\r\nThe name of the elder Heberden is frequently brought into the history of\r\nthe identification of scarlatina, with a reference to his _Commentaries on\r\nDiseases_, which were not published until 1802, some time after his death\r\nat a very advanced age. The following are among his remarks: “In the fever\r\nwhich has just been described there is always some degree of redness in\r\nthe skin, and the throat is not without an uneasy sensation. Where it\r\nhappens that the throat is full of little ulcers attended with\r\nconsiderable pain, there the disease, though the skin be ever so red, is\r\nnot denominated from the colour, but from the soreness of the throat, and\r\nobtains the name of _malignant sore-throat_; and many suppose that the two\r\ndisorders differ in nature as well as in name,” p. 23. “The enfeebled and\r\ndisordered state of all the functions of the body evidently points out\r\nsuch a malignity of the fever as cannot be owing to the affection of the\r\nuvula or tonsils, which in other distempers we often see ulcerated and\r\neaten away, without any danger of the patient’s life. These sores,\r\ntherefore, like pestilential buboes, point out the nature of the disorder;\r\nbut the danger arises, not from them, but from the fever,” p. 25.\r\n\r\nIn 1790 an elaborate attempt was made by William Lee Perkins, M.D. (dating\r\nfrom Hampton Court, 1 March) to distinguish between cynanche maligna and\r\nscarlatina anginosa, in _An Essay for a Nosological and Comparative View\r\nof the Cynanche Maligna or Putrid Sore-Throat, and the Scarlatina\r\nAnginosa_. London, 1790. He proceeds by the nosological method of Sauvages\r\nand Cullen, erecting genera, species and varieties. The result is not\r\nclear after all; for on p. 43 (note) we read that _scarlatina_ is\r\nfrequently accompanied with inflammatory and ulcerous appearances in the\r\nfauces or throat, and that _angina maligna_ or ulcerated sore-throat is\r\noften attended with red efflorescence on the skin; this had led to their\r\nbeing regarded as one and the same, and treated by the same method of\r\ncure.\r\n\r\n[1302] J.

But\r\nthe sweeping assertion as to frightful scarlatina mortality in all Europe\r\nwithout interruption since 1799 is clearly a flight of rhetoric, and is as\r\nnearly as possible the reverse of the truth so far as concerns Britain and\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n[1344] Blackmore, _Lond.

Two women with cancer of the breast were\r\noperated on, the one after the other, in the same operating theatre. Their\r\nbeds were in the same hospital ward, but separated by the whole length of\r\nthe ward. A few days after the operations, one of the women developed\r\nerysipelas, which was most extensive on the back; very soon after the\r\nother woman got the disease in a precisely similar way; they both died of\r\nit. As it seemed improbable that No. 1 had been infected in the ward, or\r\nthat No. 2 had been infected from No. 1, (some dozen surgical cases\r\nbetween them escaping,) the suggestion arises of a common source of both\r\ninfections in the operating theatre. The operating table was covered by a\r\nwoollen cloth, of red colour so as not to show blood stains; it must have\r\ncontained a good deal of putrid invisible blood from former operations.\r\n\r\n[1359] The first instance showing this came from a dairy at Hendon. See\r\nJames Cameron, M.D. _Trans. Epid. Soc._ V. (1885-6), p. 104; and _ibid._\r\nVIII. 40. One of the latest and most fully investigated came from a dairy\r\nnear Glasgow, J. B.

Hirsch (u. s.)\r\nand Max Jaffe (“Die Diphtherie in epidemiologischer und nosologischer\r\nBeziehung vornehmlich nach Französischen und Englischen Autoren\r\nzusammengestellt,” Originalabhandlung in _Schmidt’s Jahrbücher_, CXIII.,\r\n1862, pp. 97-120) do not seem to doubt the diphtheritic nature of the\r\n_garrotillos_ of Spain and Italy in the 16th and 17th centuries, but they\r\nagree with Willan in classing most of the 18th century throat-distempers\r\nof English and American writers as scarlatinal, reserving as diphtheritic,\r\nor as more nearly allied to diphtheria, Starr’s “morbus strangulatorius”\r\nof Cornwall, some cases of infants recorded by Denman (_supra_, p. 714),\r\nRumsey’s cases of “croup” (_supra_, p. 716), and the epidemic described by\r\nBard, of New York (_supra_, p. 690). These matters of identification\r\nappear to be like matters of taste, for which the best rule is _non\r\ndisputandum_. I have already pointed out that Bard himself did not\r\nhesitate to identify the epidemic throat-disease of his time with that\r\nwhich Douglass had described in New England thirty years before.\r\n\r\n[1367] P.

The disease which\r\nMackenzie called croup, was generally known in Glasgow at that time as\r\n“croupy sore throat.” It was very fatal, attacking several children in the\r\nsame family, was reckoned contagious, was not a modification of\r\nscarlatina, was very different from idiopathic croup as it began on the\r\ntonsils and descended to the larynx and trachea, and, lastly, was\r\nsometimes marked by gangrenous foetor.\r\n\r\nRobertson, _Edin.

Wade (1858), Ernest Hart\r\n(1859), Edward Copeman (Norwich, 1859). Christison, J. W. Begbie and\r\nothers wrote upon it in Scotland.\r\n\r\n[1372] Mr Jones, of Fletching, Sussex, wrote that scores of cases\r\n(probably at least 50 or 60) have had more or less eruption. In one case\r\nit was general and bright.... It was like scarlatina ... but the whole\r\nsurface was covered with minute miliary vesicles of clear fluid, ‘one mass\r\nof small vesications.’ There was a great deal of itching and no subsequent\r\ndropsy. In other cases the eruption was partial. _Rep. Med. Off. Privy\r\nCouncil_, II.

Among historians Lecky (I. 573) has thought it worthy\r\nof mention among the progressive improvements of the 18th century.\r\n\r\n[1388] Heberden (l. c. p. 42) accounted for the enormous increase of the\r\narticle “convulsions” in the Bills by the inclusion under that term of\r\nmost of the deaths originally entered under “chrisomes and infants,” which\r\nwere infants under one month. But the latter had been mostly transferred\r\nat an early period while convulsions was still a small total; and even at\r\nthe worst period of the public health in London, about 1730-40, they would\r\nnot have accounted for a sixth part of the deaths under convulsions. The\r\nprobability of the deaths from “griping in the guts” having been\r\ntransferred to “convulsions” was pointed out in a review of Heberden’s\r\nessay in the _British Critic_ on its appearance, without reasons given\r\nsuch as I adduce in the sequel.\r\n\r\n[1389] _Observ.

Ballard, following the method of Pfeiffer (1871)\r\nfor Asiatic cholera, has shown that the correspondence is closest with the\r\ntemperature of the ground four feet deep.\r\n\r\n[1403] Ballard, _Report to the Local Government Board upon the Causation\r\nof Summer Diarrhoea_, 1889, p. 32.\r\n\r\n[1404] Willis mentions an instance (_Pathol. Cerebri_, Pordage’s transl.\r\np. 25) which can hardly mean anything but congenital feebleness as a cause\r\nof infantile convulsions. A neighbour of his (in St Martin’s Lane) had\r\nlost all his children by convulsions within the space of three months.\r\nAnother child was born, and Willis was sent for to advise what regimen\r\nshould be followed so as to save it from the same fate.\r\n\r\n[1405] This is clearly seen in comparing ages at death in Liverpool, and\r\nin Preston or Salford. Again in the ten years 1871-80, there were 4530\r\ndeaths from diarrhoea in the group of shipping towns, Yarmouth, Hull (with\r\nSculcoates), Goole and Hartlepool, of which 70 per cent. were under one\r\nyear, 19 per cent. from one to five, and 11 per cent. above five, chiefly\r\nin old age. In the group of Leicester, Worcester, Northampton and Coventry\r\nin the same period, there were 5001 deaths, of which 74 per cent. were\r\nunder one year, 17 per cent. from one to five, and 9 per cent. above five,\r\nchiefly in old age.\r\n\r\n[1406] Ballard, _Report, &c._ u. s. says that “occupation of females from\r\nhome,” which had been often assigned by medical officers of health and\r\nothers as a fruitful cause of infantile fatal diarrhoea, “resolves itself\r\nmainly into the question of maternal neglect, with the substitution more\r\nor less of artificial feeding for feeding at the breast.” Tatham, _Brit.\r\nMed. Journ._ 1892, II. 277, is of opinion that the rate of infant\r\nmortality was considerably increased by the practice, which obtained in\r\nmost manufacturing towns, of allowing women to return to work within a\r\nweek or ten days after their confinement, so that the duties of the mother\r\nwere necessarily delegated. The paper by Dr G. Reid, _ibid._ p. 275, which\r\ncalled forth that and similar opinions as to the kind of maternal neglect\r\nthat favoured the mortality by infantile diarrhoea, bore the title, “Legal\r\nrestraint upon the employment of women in factories before and after\r\nchildbirth”; but the emphasis falls almost wholly upon restraint of the\r\nmother’s industrial occupation after the child is born.\r\n\r\n[1407] L. c. pp. 43-45.\r\n\r\n[1408] Ballard, u. s.

In the latter he includes both cholera nostras and\r\nbilious colic, (as well as dry colic) as Sydenham had done, and makes the\r\nfollowing distinction between the two forms, which “are very nearly allied\r\nin their nature”:--“The vomiting of bile in the cholera is not so early as\r\nit is in the other; neither is it so constant, nor in so large quantities.\r\nThough a purging generally attends the bilious colic, yet it does not\r\ncorrespond so regularly as it does in the cholera, in which there\r\ngenerally is a call to stool soon after every paroxysm of vomiting.... The\r\nbilious colic is not generally so quickly hazardous as the cholera is. The\r\nintervals between the sick fits are often longer, and when it is attended\r\nwith danger, it does not become so so suddenly as the cholera does.”\r\nBilious colic was not so strictly an autumnal complaint as cholera. It was\r\nnot so soon relieved by medicines. It resembled cholera in the remarkable\r\ncharacter of exciting cramps in other muscles than the abdominal.\r\n\r\n[1414] _Pharmaceutice rationalis._\r\n\r\n[1415] Appendix to _Essay on Smallpox_, 1740.\r\n\r\n[1416] _Gent.

That was the popular belief from an early period,\r\nwhich nearly all the medical writers on autumnal diarrhoea and dysentery\r\ntook occasion to combat as either inadequate or erroneous.\r\n\r\n[1424] See Vol. 1. of this History, p. 626.

As our knowledge of this fever is not derived from any source on\r\nwhich we can certainly rely, it is possible that we may have formed an\r\nerroneous opinion respecting it; but from all we have heard of its\r\nsymptoms and mode of distribution, we are disposed to consider it as\r\ntotally different in nature from the common fever of this country. The\r\nlatter circumstance alone, the mode of distribution of the disease, is, we\r\nthink, perfectly sufficient to demonstrate our proposition. Instead of\r\noccupying the Cowgate, the Grassmarket, and the High Street, the usual\r\nhaunts of typhus, this fever had its head-quarters in Heriot Row and Great\r\nKing Street; and, according to our information, it extended from the last\r\nmentioned street in the direction of the Water of Leith, and from Leith,\r\nalong the shore, to Musselburgh. We do not vouch for the accuracy of these\r\nminute details, but we believe the important fact to be beyond doubt that\r\nthis fever prevailed chiefly, not in the districts where typhus is\r\ninvariably to be met with, but in the most fashionable parts of the New\r\nTown.”\r\n\r\n[1465] James Black, M.D., _Edin.

Opposite his house was a large stable dunghill in a\r\nvery foetid state. On the evening of the 16th May he had eaten a heavy\r\nsupper of lambs’ fry, and had been ill thereafter, the symptoms becoming\r\nthose of Asiatic cholera on the night of the 18th, death ensuing at 2 p.m.\r\n20th.\r\n\r\n[1527] In the hamlet adjoining a cotton-mill at Hinds, near Bury,\r\nconsisting of thirty cottages in a row between the mill lade and the\r\ncanal, wretchedly built, without chimneys, with windows that would not\r\nopen, the inmates sleeping four or five in a bed, there were 32 cases of\r\ncholera with 7 deaths, but none of these were in persons who worked in the\r\nmill. Gaulter, u. s. citing Goodlad. He cites also Flint, of Stockport,\r\nfor the rarity of attacks among the mill workers in that town. See also\r\nSamuel Gaskell, “Malignant Cholera in Manchester,” _Edin. Med. and Surg.\r\nJourn._ XL. 52. The microbic theory, or, as it was then called by Sir\r\nHenry Holland and others, the “hypothesis of insect life,” was happily\r\nthought of by a working cotton-spinner in Manchester to explain the\r\nimmunity of the mill-workers in 1832. Gaulter (u. s. p. 120) gives in\r\ncorrect English what would probably have been said in the vernacular as\r\nfollows: “I’ve been thinkin’, Maister,” said a spinner to Mr Sowden,\r\nmillowner, “as how th’ cholery comes o’ hinsecks that smo’ as we corn’d\r\nsee ’em, an’ they corn’d live i’ factories for th’ ’eät and th’ ile. Me\r\nan’ my mates wor speakin’ o’t last neet, an’ we o’ on us thowt th’ saäm\r\nthing.” Hahnemann, cited by the _Times_, 17 July, 1831, believed that the\r\ncholera insect escaped from the eye, and fastened upon the hair, skin,\r\nclothes, &c. of other persons. The common microscopic objects uniformly\r\nfound in the choleraic discharges by later observers have been vibrios, of\r\nwhich half-a-dozen, or perhaps a dozen, varieties have been distinguished.\r\nOne of these was somewhat audaciously named the “cholera germ” or “comma\r\nbacillus of cholera” by Dr R. Koch, who went to Calcutta in 1884. All\r\nvibrios, which have a corkscrew form when in motion, are apt to assume the\r\ncomma form when at rest.\r\n\r\n[1528] _Times_, Sept. 5, 1832.\r\n\r\n[1529] John Addington Symonds, “Progress and Causes of Cholera in Bristol,\r\n1832.” _Trans.

The year 1847, in which there was no\r\ncholera, had been much more fatal in the chief towns of Scotland, than\r\neither 1848 or 1849, owing to the great prevalence of typhus (Stark):\r\n\r\n_Deaths from all causes._\r\n\r\n                  1846       1847       1848       1849\r\n\r\n  Edinburgh       4594       6706       5475       4807\r\n  Glasgow        10854      18071      12475      12231\r\n  Dundee          1531       2520       2146       2312\r\n  Paisley         1429       2068       1552       1712\r\n  Leith            801        955       1212       1066\r\n  Greenock        1087       2214       1289       2344\r\n  Aberdeen        1315       1466       2366\r\n\r\n[1554] H. MacCormac to Graves, _Dub. Journ. Med. Sc._ N. S. VII. 245.\r\n\r\n[1555] Most of the information on the cholera of 1849 in England comes\r\nfrom two sources: (1) the _Report of the General Board of Health on the\r\nEpidemic Cholera of 1848 and 1849_ (Parl. papers, 1850), containing the\r\ndetailed reports of Mr R. D. Grainger for London, and of Dr John\r\nSutherland for various other towns; and (2) the _Quarterly Reports of the\r\nRegistrar-General for the year 1849_. See also note 3, p. 846.\r\n\r\n[1556] Sutherland, _Report_, u. s. p. 121. At Sheffield (_ibid._ p. 108) a\r\nsudden outbreak of diarrhoea occurred on 26 August over the whole town;\r\n5319 cases of it were known, with only 76 cases of cholera and 46 deaths.\r\n\r\n[1557] Henry Cooper, “On the Cholera Mortality in Hull during the epidemic\r\nof 1849,” _Journ. Statist. Soc._ XVI. 347. The total is higher than that\r\nin the Table.\r\n\r\n[1558] Sutherland, _Report_, u. s., with map.\r\n\r\n[1559] For Bristol, Sutherland (p. 126) cites Goldney: “In a certain\r\nlodging-house there were 35 attacks and 33 deaths during the epidemic of\r\n1832.... Out of the same house in 1849, 64 people were turned, of whom 49\r\nwere sent to the House of Refuge.” Not one case of cholera occurred among\r\nthese, but many attacks of diarrhoea, which was general all through the\r\nepidemic, especially along the Frome.\r\n\r\n[1560] The epidemic in the small Devonshire fishing village of Noss Mayo\r\nnear Plympton St Mary, was very fully investigated by A. C. Maclaren,\r\n_Journ. Statist. Soc._ XIII. (1850), p. 103. The Oxford epidemic (75\r\ndeaths) was described by Greenhill and Allen in the _Ashmolean Society\r\nReports_. For Tynemouth, see Greenhow, _Trans. Epid. Soc._ The volume by\r\nBaly and Gull, _Reports on Epidemic Cholera drawn up at the desire of the\r\nCholera Committee Roy. Col. Phys._ London, 1854, is in great part a review\r\nof the epidemic of 1849, in the form of a general discussion of the whole\r\nproblem of Asiatic cholera. A subcommittee of the College also published a\r\n_Report on the nature of the microscopic bodies found in the intestinal\r\ndischarges of Cholera_, London, 1849.\r\n\r\n[1561] Farr, “Influence of elevation on the mortality of Cholera.” _Journ.\r\nStatist. Soc._ XV. (1852), p. 155, and in the Reports of the\r\nRegistrar-General.\r\n\r\n[1562] C. Barham, M.B., “Tavistock Parish Register,” _Journ. Statist.\r\nSoc._ IV. 37.\r\n\r\n[1563] Middleton, “Sanitary Statistics of Salisbury,” _ibid._ XXVII.\r\n(1864), p. 541.\r\n\r\n[1564] _Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the late\r\noutbreak of Cholera in Newcastle, Gateshead and Tynemouth._ Parl. papers,\r\n1854, pp. xl and 580.\r\n\r\n[1565] The most elaborate and minute account of an epidemic on this\r\noccasion was that for Oxford, _Memoir on the Cholera at Oxford in the year\r\n1854_. By H. W. Acland, M.D., in which all the points in the problem of\r\ncholera are illustrated from the easily surveyed local circumstances.\r\n\r\n[1566] The registration district of Bideford had 46 deaths in 1854, the\r\nonly large total in the West country. Kingsley’s graphic picture of the\r\ncholera of 1854 in _Two Years Ago_ may have corresponded to these naked\r\nfigures in the registration tables; but no place in Cornwall, in which\r\ncounty the scene appears to be laid, could have furnished so considerable\r\nan epidemic as the novelist describes, a few places in it having had each\r\nsome half-dozen deaths.\r\n\r\n[1567] More than half in the end of 1853.\r\n\r\n[1568] Nearly all in the end of 1853.\r\n\r\n[1569] It was reported on by three commissioners, Dr Donald Fraser and\r\nMessrs Thomas Hughes and J. M. Ludlow, in the _Report of the Committee for\r\nScientific Inquiries, Cholera Epidemic of 1854_. Appendix.\r\n\r\n[1570] John Snow, M.D., _On the mode of communication of Cholera_.

Gairdner on the diffusion of cholera in the remote districts of\r\nScotland. Information on the subject is invited, but it does not appear\r\nthat any full account of the cholera of 1854 in Scotland was published.
