WATERS\r\n\r\n\"To be content that times to come should only know there was such a man,\r\nnot caring whether they knew more of him, was a frigid ambition in\r\nCardan.\"--SIR THOMAS BROWNE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLAWRENCE & BULLEN, Limited,\r\n\r\n16 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London, MDCCCXCVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  RICHARD CLAY & SONS, LIMITED,\r\n  LONDON & BUNGAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nNo attempt is made in the following pages to submit to historical\r\ntreatment the vast and varied mass of printed matter which Cardan left as\r\nhis contribution to letters and science, except in the case of those works\r\nwhich are, in purpose or incidentally, autobiographical, or of those which\r\nfurnish in themselves effective contributions towards the framing of an\r\nestimate of the genius and character of the writer. Neither has it seemed\r\nworth while to offer to the public another biography constructed on the\r\nlines of the one brought out by Professor Henry Morley in 1854, for the\r\nreason that the circumstances of Cardan's life, the character of his work,\r\nand of the times in which he lived, all appeared to be susceptible of more\r\nsuccinct and homogeneous treatment than is possible in a chronicle of the\r\npassing years, and of the work that each one saw accomplished. At certain\r\njunctures the narrative form is inevitable, but an attempt has been made\r\nto treat the more noteworthy episodes of Cardan's life and work, and the\r\ncontemporary aspect of the republic of letters, in relation to existing\r\ntendencies and conditions, whenever such a course has seemed possible.\r\n\r\nProfessor Morley's book, _The Life of Girolamo Cardano, of Milan,\r\nphysician_, has been for some time out of print. This industrious writer\r\ngathered together a large quantity of material, dealing almost as fully\r\nwith the more famous of the contemporary men of mark, with whom Cardan\r\nwas brought into contact, as with Cardan himself. The translations and\r\nanalyses of some of Cardan's more popular works which Professor Morley\r\ngives are admirable in their way, but the space they occupy in the\r\nbiography is somewhat excessive. Had sufficient leisure for revision and\r\ncondensation been allowed, Professor Morley's book would have taken a high\r\nplace in biographical literature. As it stands it is a noteworthy\r\nperformance; and, by reason of its wide and varied stores of information\r\nand its excellent index, it must always prove a valuable magazine of\r\n_mémoires pour servir_ for any future students who may be moved to write\r\nafresh, concerning the life and work of the great Milanese physician.\r\n\r\nAn apology may be needed for the occurrence here and there of passages\r\ntranslated from the _De Vita Propria_ and the _De Utilitate ex Adversis\r\ncapienda_, passages which some readers may find too frequent and too\r\nlengthy, but contemporary opinion is strongly in favour of letting the\r\nsubject speak for himself as far as may be possible. The date and place of\r\nCardan's quoted works are given in the first citation therefrom; those of\r\nhis writings which have not been available in separate form have been\r\nconsulted in the collected edition of his works in ten volumes, edited by\r\nSpon, and published at Lyons in 1663.\r\n\r\nThe author desires to acknowledge with gratitude the valuable assistance\r\nin the way of suggestion and emendation which he received from Mr. R.C.\r\nChristie during the final revision of the proofs.\r\n\r\n_London, October 1898._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEROME CARDAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nLIKE certain others of the illustrious personages who flourished in his\r\ntime, Girolamo Cardano, or, as he has become to us by the unwritten law of\r\nnomenclature, Jerome Cardan, was fated to suffer the burden and obloquy of\r\nbastardy.[1] He was born at Pavia from the illicit union of Fazio Cardano,\r\na Milanese jurisconsult and mathematician of considerable repute, and a\r\nyoung widow, whose maiden name had been Chiara Micheria, his father being\r\nfifty-six, and his mother thirty-seven years of age at his birth. The\r\nfamily of Fazio was settled at Gallarate, a town in Milanese territory,\r\nand was one which, according to Jerome's contention, could lay claim to\r\nconsiderable antiquity and distinction. He prefers a claim of descent from\r\nthe house of Castillione, founding the same upon an inscription on the\r\napse of the principal church at Gallarate.[2] He asserts that as far back\r\nas 1189 Milo Cardano was Governor of Milan for more than seven years, and\r\naccording to tradition Franco Cardano, the commander of the forces of\r\nMatteo Visconti,[3] was a member of the family. If the claim of the\r\nCastillione ancestry be allowed the archives of the race would be still\r\nfarther enriched by the name of Pope Celestine IV., Godfrey of Milan, who\r\nwas elected Pope in 1241, and died the same year.\r\n\r\nCardan's immediate ancestors were long-lived. The sons of Fazio Cardano,\r\nhis great-grandfather, Joanni, Aldo, and Antonio, lived to be severally\r\nninety-four, eighty-eight, and eighty-six years of age. Of these Joanni\r\nbegat two sons: Antonio, who lived eighty-eight years, and Angelo, who\r\nreached the age of eighty-six. To Aldo were born Jacopo, who died at\r\nseventy-two; Gottardo, who died at eighty-four; and Fazio, the father of\r\nJerome, who died at eighty.[4]\r\n\r\nFazio, albeit he came of such a long-lived stock, and lived himself to be\r\nfourscore, suffered much physical trouble during his life. On account of a\r\nwound which he had received when he was a youth, some of the bones of his\r\nskull had to be removed, and from this time forth he never dared to remain\r\nlong with his head uncovered. When he was fifty-nine he swallowed a\r\ncertain corrosive poison, which did not kill him, but left him toothless.\r\nHe was likewise round-shouldered, a stammerer, and subject to constant\r\npalpitation of the heart; but in compensation for these defects he had\r\neyes which could see in the dark and which needed not spectacles even in\r\nadvanced age.\r\n\r\nOf Jerome's mother little is known. Her family seems to have been as\r\ntenacious of life as that of Fazio, for her father Jacopo lived to be\r\nseventy-five years of age. Of his maternal grandfather Jerome remarks that\r\nhe was a highly skilled mathematician, and that when he was about seventy\r\nyears of age, he was cast into prison for some offence against the law. He\r\nspeaks of his mother as choleric in temper, well dowered with memory and\r\nmental parts, small in stature and fat, and of a pious disposition,[5] and\r\ndeclares that she and his father were alike in one respect, to wit that\r\nthey were easily moved to anger and were wont to manifest but lukewarm and\r\nintermittent affection for their child. Nevertheless they were in a way\r\nindulgent to him. His father permitted him to remain in bed till the\r\nsecond hour of the day had struck, or rather forbade him to rise before\r\nthis time--an indulgence which worked well for the preservation of his\r\nhealth. He adds that in after times he always thought of his father as\r\npossessing the kindlier nature of the two.[6]\r\n\r\nIt would seem from the passage above written, as well as from certain\r\nothers subsequent, that Jerome had little affection for his mother; and\r\nalbeit he neither chides nor reproaches her, he never refers to her in\r\nterms so appreciative and loving as those which he uses in lamenting the\r\ndeath of his harsh and tyrannical father. In the _Geniturarum Exempla_[7]\r\nhe says that, seeing he is writing of a woman, he will confine his remarks\r\nto saying that she was ingenious, of good parts, generous, upright, and\r\nloving towards her children. Perhaps the fact that his father died early,\r\nwhile his mother lived on for many years, and was afterwards a member of\r\nhis household--together with his wife--may account for the colder tone of\r\nhis remarks while writing about her. She was the widow of a certain\r\nAntonio Alberio,[8] and during her marriage had borne him three children,\r\nTommaso, Catilina, and Joanni Ambrogio; but when Jerome was a year old all\r\nthree of these died of the plague within the space of a few weeks.[9] He\r\nhimself narrowly escaped death from the same cause, and this attack he\r\nattributes to an inherited tendency from his mother, she having suffered\r\nfrom the same disease during her girlhood. There seems to have been born\r\nto Fazio and Chiara another son, who died at birth.[10]\r\n\r\nJerome Cardan was born on September 24, 1501, between half-past six\r\no'clock and a quarter to seven in the evening. In the second chapter of\r\nhis autobiography he gives the year as 1500, and in _De Utilitate_, p.\r\n347, he writes the date as September 23, but on all other occasions the\r\ndate first written is used. Before he saw the light malefic influences\r\nwere at work against him. His mother, urged on no doubt by the desire to\r\nconceal her shame, and persuaded by evil counsellors, drank a potion of\r\nabortive drugs in order to produce miscarriage,[11] but Nature on this\r\noccasion was not to be baulked. In recording the circumstances of his\r\nbirth he writes at some length in the jargon of astrology to show how the\r\ncelestial bodies were leagued together so as to mar him both in body and\r\nmind. \"Wherefore I ought, according to every rule, to have been born a\r\nmonster, and, under the circumstances, it was no marvel that it was found\r\nnecessary to tear me from the womb in order to bring me into the world.\r\nThus was I born, or rather dragged from my mother's body. I was to all\r\noutward seeming dead, with my head covered with black curly hair. I was\r\nbrought round by being plunged in a bath of heated wine, a remedy which\r\nmight well have proved hurtful to any other infant. My mother lay three\r\nwhole days in labour, but at last gave birth to me, a living child.\"[12]\r\n\r\nThe sinister influences of the stars soon began to manifest their power.\r\nBefore Jerome had been many days in the world the woman into whose charge\r\nhe had been given was seized with the plague and died the same day,\r\nwhereupon his mother took him home with her. The first of his bodily\r\nailments,--the catalogue of the same which he subsequently gives is indeed\r\na portentous one,[13]--was an eruption of carbuncles on the face in the\r\nform of a cross, one of the sores being set on the tip of the nose; and\r\nwhen these disappeared, swellings came. Before the boy was two months old\r\nhis godfather, Isidore di Resta of Ticino, gave him into the care of\r\nanother nurse who lived at Moirago, a town about seven miles from Milan,\r\nbut here again ill fortune attended him. His body began to waste and his\r\nstomach to swell because the nurse who gave him suck was herself\r\npregnant.[14] A third foster-mother was found for him, and he remained\r\nwith her till he was weaned in his third year.\r\n\r\nWhen he was four years of age he was taken to Milan to be under the care\r\nof his mother, who, with her sister, Margarita, was living in Fazio's\r\nhouse; but whether she was at this time legally married to him or not\r\nthere is no evidence to show. In recording this change he remarks that he\r\nnow came under a gentler discipline from the hands of his mother and his\r\naunt, but immediately afterwards proclaims his belief that the last-named\r\nmust have been born without a gall bladder, a remark somewhat difficult to\r\napply, seeing he frequently complains afterwards of her harshness. It must\r\nbe remembered, however, that these details are taken from a record of the\r\nwriter's fifth year set down when he was past seventy.[15] He quotes\r\ncertain lapses from kindly usage, as for instance when it happened that he\r\nwas beaten by his father or his mother without a cause. After much\r\nchastisement he always fell sick, and lay some time in mortal danger.\r\n\"When I was seven years old my father and my mother were then living\r\napart--my kinsfolk determined, for some reason or other, to give over\r\nbeating me, though perchance a touch of the whip might then have done me\r\nno harm. But ill-fortune was ever hovering around me; she let my\r\ntribulation take a different shape, but she did not remove it. My father,\r\nhaving hired a house, took me and my mother and my aunt to live with him,\r\nand made me always accompany him in his rounds about the city. On this\r\naccount I, being taken at this tender age with my weak body from a life of\r\nabsolute rest and put to hard and constant work, was seized at the\r\nbeginning of my eighth year with dysentery and fever, an ailment which was\r\nat that time epidemic in our city. Moreover I had eaten by stealth a vast\r\nquantity of sour grapes. But after I had been visited by the physicians,\r\nBernabo della Croce and Angelo Gyra, there seemed to be some hope of my\r\nrecovery, albeit both my parents, and my aunt as well, had already bewept\r\nme as one dead.\r\n\r\n\"At this season my father, who was at heart a man of piety, was minded to\r\ninvoke the divine assistance of San Girolamo (commending me to the care of\r\nthe Saint in his prayers) rather than trust to the working of that\r\nfamiliar spirit which, as he was wont to declare openly, was constantly in\r\nattendance upon him. The reason of this change in his treatment of me I\r\nnever cared to inquire. It was during the time of my recovery from this\r\nsickness, that the French celebrated their triumph after defeating the\r\nVenetians on the banks of the Adda, which spectacle I was allowed to\r\nwitness from my window.[16] After this my father freed me of the task of\r\ngoing with him on his rounds. But the anger of Juno was not yet exhausted;\r\nfor, before I had fully recovered my health, I fell down-stairs (we were\r\nthen living in the Via dei Maini), with a hammer in my hand, and by this\r\naccident I hurt the left side of my forehead, injuring the bone and\r\ncausing a scar which remains to this day. Before I had recovered from this\r\nmishap I was sitting on the threshold of the house when a stone, about as\r\nlong and as broad as a nut, fell down from the top of a high house next\r\ndoor and wounded my head just where my hair grew very thickly on the left\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\"At the beginning of my tenth year my father changed this house, which had\r\nproved a very unlucky one for me, for another in the same street, and\r\nthere I abode for three whole years. But my ill luck still followed me,\r\nfor my father once more caused me to go about with him as his _famulus_,\r\nand would never allow me on any pretext to escape this task. I should\r\nhesitate to say that he did this through cruelty; for, taking into\r\nconsideration what ensued, you may perchance be brought to see that this\r\naction of his came to pass rather through the will of Heaven than through\r\nany failing of his own. I must add too that my mother and my aunt were\r\nfully in agreement with him in his treatment of me. In after times,\r\nhowever, he dealt with me in much milder fashion, for he took to live with\r\nhim two of his nephews, wherefore my own labour was lessened by the amount\r\nof service he exacted from these. Either I did not go out at all, or if we\r\nall went out together the task was less irksome.\r\n\r\n\"When I had completed my sixteenth year--up to which time I served my\r\nfather constantly--we once more changed our house, and dwelt with\r\nAlessandro Cardano next door to the bakery of the Bossi. My father had two\r\nother nephews, sons of a sister of his, one named Evangelista, a member of\r\nthe Franciscan Order, and nearly seventy years of age, and the other Otto\r\nCantone, a farmer of the taxes, and very rich. The last-named, before he\r\ndied, wished to leave me his sole heir; but this my father forbad, saying\r\nthat Otto's wealth had been ill gotten; wherefore the estate was\r\ndistributed according to the directions of the surviving brother.\"[17]\r\n\r\nThis, told as nearly as may be in his own words, is the story of Cardan's\r\nbirth and childhood and early discipline, a discipline ill calculated to\r\nlet him grow up to useful and worthy manhood. It must have been a wretched\r\nspring of life. Many times he refers to the hard slavery he underwent in\r\nthe days when he was forced to carry his father's bag about the town, and\r\ntells how he had to listen to words of insult cast at his mother's\r\nname.[18] Like most boys who lead solitary lives, unrelieved by the\r\ncompanionship of other children, he was driven in upon himself, and grew\r\nup into a fanciful imaginative youth, a lover of books rather than of\r\ngames, with an old head upon his young shoulders. After such a training it\r\nwas only natural that he should be transformed from a nervous hysterical\r\nchild into an embittered, cross-grained man, profligate and superstitious\r\nat the same time. Abundant light is thrown upon every stage of his career,\r\nfor few men have left a clearer picture of themselves in their written\r\nwords, and nowhere is Cardan, from the opening to the closing scene, so\r\nplainly exhibited as in the _De Vita Propria_, almost the last work which\r\ncame from his pen. It has been asserted that this book, written in the\r\ntwilight of senility by an old man with his heart cankered by misfortune\r\nand ill-usage, and his brain upset by the dread of real or fancied\r\nassaults of foes who lay in wait for him at every turn, is no trustworthy\r\nguide, even when bare facts are in question, and undoubtedly it would be\r\nundesirable to trust this record without seeking confirmation elsewhere.\r\nThis confirmation is nearly always at hand, for there is hardly a\r\nnoteworthy event in his career which he does not refer to constantly in\r\nthe more autobiographic of his works. The _De Vita Propria_ is indeed ill\r\narranged and full of inconsistencies, but in spite of its imperfections,\r\nit presents its subject as clearly and effectively as Benvenuto Cellini is\r\ndisplayed in his own work. The rough sketch of a great master often\r\nperforms its task more thoroughly than the finished painting, and Cardan's\r\nautobiography is a fragment of this sort. It lets pass in order of\r\nprocession the moody neglected boy in Fazio's ill-ordered house, the\r\nstudent at Pavia, the youthful Rector of the Paduan Gymnasium, plunging\r\nwhen just across the threshold of life into criminal excess of\r\nSardanapalean luxury, the country doctor at Sacco and afterwards at\r\nGallarate, starving amongst his penniless patients, the University\r\nprofessor, the famous physician for whose services the most illustrious\r\nmonarchs in Europe came as suppliants in vain, the father broken by family\r\ndisgrace and calamity, and the old man, disgraced and suspected and\r\nharassed by persecutors who shot their arrows in the dark, but at the same\r\ntime tremblingly anxious to set down the record of his days before the\r\nnight should descend.\r\n\r\nUntil he had completed his nineteenth year Jerome continued to dwell under\r\nthe roof which for the time being might give shelter to his parents. The\r\nemoluments which Fazio drew from his profession were sufficient for the\r\nfamily wants--he himself being a man of simple tastes; wherefore Jerome\r\nwas not forced, in addition to his other youthful troubles, to submit to\r\nthat _execrata paupertas_ and its concomitant miseries which vexed him in\r\nlater years. To judge from his conduct in the matter of Otto Cantone's\r\nestate, Fazio seems to have been as great a despiser of wealth as his son\r\nproved to be afterwards. His virtue, such as it was, must have been the\r\noutcome of one of those hard cold natures, with wants few and trifling,\r\nand none of those tastes which cry out daily for some new toy, only to be\r\nprocured by money. The fact that he made his son run after him through the\r\nstreets of Milan in place of a servant is not a conclusive proof of\r\navarice; it may just as likely mean that the old man was indifferent and\r\ncallous to whatever suffering he might inflict upon his young son, and\r\nindisposed to trouble himself about searching for a hireling to carry his\r\nbag. The one indication we gather of his worldly wisdom is his\r\ndissatisfaction that his son was firmly set to follow medicine rather than\r\njurisprudence, a step which would involve the loss of the stipend of one\r\nhundred crowns a year which he drew for his lectureship, an income which\r\nhe had hoped might be continued to a son of his after his death.[19]\r\n\r\nAmidst the turmoil and discomfort of what must at the best have been a\r\nmost ill-regulated household, the boy's education was undertaken by his\r\nfather in such odds and ends of time as he might find to spare for the\r\ntask.[20] What with the hardness and irritability of the teacher, and the\r\npeevishness inseparable from the pupil's physical feebleness and morbid\r\noverwrought mental habit, these hours of lessons must have been irksome to\r\nboth, and of little benefit. \"In the meantime my father taught me orally\r\nthe Latin tongue as well as the rudiments of Arithmetic, Geometry, and\r\nAstrology. But he allowed me to sleep well into the day, and he himself\r\nwould always remain abed till nine o'clock. But one habit of his appeared\r\nto me likely to lead to grave consequences, to wit the way he had of\r\nlending to others anything which belonged to him. Part of these loans,\r\nwhich were made to insolvents, he lost altogether; and the residue, lent\r\nto divers persons in high places, could only be recovered with much\r\ntrouble and no little danger, and with loss of all interest on the same. I\r\nknow not whether he acted in this wise by the advice of that familiar\r\nspirit[21] whose services he retained for eight-and-thirty years. What\r\nafterwards came to pass showed that my father treated me, his son, rightly\r\nin all things relating to education, seeing that I had a keen\r\nintelligence. For with boys of this sort it is well to make use of the bit\r\nas though you were dealing with mules. Beyond this he was witty and\r\ndiverting in his conversation, and given to the telling of stories and\r\nstrange occurrences well worth notice. He told me many things about\r\nfamiliar spirits, but what part of these were true I know not; but\r\nassuredly tales of this sort, wonderful in themselves and artfully put\r\ntogether, delighted me marvellously.\r\n\r\n\"But what chiefly deserved condemnation in my father was that he brought\r\nup certain other youths with the intention of leaving to them his goods in\r\ncase I should die; which thing, in sooth, meant nothing less than the\r\nexposure of myself to open danger through plots of the parents of the boys\r\naforesaid, on account of the prize offered. Over this affair my father and\r\nmy mother quarrelled grievously, and finally decided to live apart.\r\nWhereupon my mother, stricken by this mental vexation, and troubled at\r\nintervals with what I deem to have been an hysterical affection, fell one\r\nday full on the back of her neck, and struck her head upon the floor,\r\nwhich was composed of tiles. It was two or three hours before she came\r\nround, and indeed her recovery was little short of miraculous, especially\r\nas at the end of her seizure she foamed much at the mouth.\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime I altered the whole drift of this tragedy by a pretended\r\nadoption of the religious life, for I became for a time a member of the\r\nmendicant Franciscan brotherhood. But at the beginning of my twenty-first\r\nyear[22] I went to the Gymnasium at Pavia, whereupon my father, feeling my\r\nabsence, was softened towards me, and a reconciliation between him and my\r\nmother took place.\r\n\r\n\"Before this time I had learnt music, my mother and even my father having\r\nsecretly given me money for the same; my father likewise paid for my\r\ninstruction in dialectics. I became so proficient in this art that I\r\ntaught it to certain other youths before I went to the University. Thus he\r\nsent me there endowed with the means of winning an honest living; but he\r\nnever once spake a word to me concerning this matter, bearing himself\r\nalways towards me in considerate, kindly, and pious wise.\r\n\r\n\"For the residue of his days (and he lived on well-nigh four more years)\r\nhis life was a sad one, as if he would fain let it be known to the world\r\nhow much he loved me.[23] Moreover, when by the working of fate I returned\r\nhome while he lay sick, he besought, he commanded, nay he even forced me,\r\nall unwilling, to depart thence, what though he knew his last hour was\r\nnigh, for the reason that the plague was in the city, and he was fain that\r\nI should put myself beyond danger from the same. Even now my tears rise\r\nwhen I think of his goodwill towards me. But, my father, I will do all the\r\njustice I can to thy merit and to thy paternal care; and, as long as these\r\npages may be read, so long shall thy name and thy virtues be celebrated.\r\nHe was a man not to be corrupted by any offering whatsoever, and indeed a\r\nsaint. But I myself was left after his death involved in many lawsuits,\r\nhaving nothing clearly secured except one small house.\"[24]\r\n\r\nFazio contracted a close intimacy with a certain Galeazzo Rosso, a man\r\nclever as a smith, and endowed with mechanical tastes which no doubt\r\nhelped to secure him Fazio's friendship. Galeazzo discovered the principle\r\nof the water-screw of Archimedes before the description of the same,\r\nwritten in the books of the inventor, had been published. He also made\r\nswords which could be bent as if they were of lead, and sharp enough to\r\ncut iron like wood. He performed a more wonderful feat in fashioning iron\r\nbreast-plates which would resist the impact of red-hot missiles. In the\r\n_De Sapientia_, Cardan records that when Galeazzo perfected his\r\nwater-screw, he lost his wits for joy.\r\n\r\nFazio took no trouble to teach his son Latin,[25] though the learned\r\nlanguage would have been just as necessary for the study of jurisprudence\r\nas for any other liberal calling, and Jerome did not begin to study it\r\nsystematically till he was past nineteen years of age. Through some whim\r\nor prejudice the old man refused for some time to allow the boy to go to\r\nthe University, and when at last he gave his consent he still fought hard\r\nto compel Jerome to qualify himself in jurisprudence; but here he found\r\nhimself at issue with a will more stubborn than his own. Cardan writes:\r\n\"From my earliest youth I let every action of mine be regulated in view of\r\nthe after course of my life, and I deemed that as a career medicine would\r\nserve my purpose far better than law, being more appropriate for the end I\r\nhad in view, of greater interest to the world at large, and likely to last\r\nas long as time itself. At the same time I regarded it as a study which\r\nembodied the nobler principles, and rested upon the ground of reason (that\r\nis upon the eternal laws of Nature) rather than upon the sanction of human\r\nopinion. On this account I took up medicine rather than jurisprudence, nay\r\nI almost entirely cast aside, or even fled from the company of those\r\nfriends of mine who followed the law, rejecting at the same time wealth\r\nand power and honour. My father, when he heard that I had abandoned the\r\nstudy of law to follow philosophy, wept in my presence, and grieved amain\r\nthat I would not settle down to the study of his own subject. He deemed\r\nit the more salutary discipline--proofs of which opinion he would often\r\nbring forward out of Aristotle--that it was better adapted for the\r\nacquisition of power and riches; and that it would help me more\r\nefficiently in restoring the fortunes of our house. He perceived moreover\r\nthat the office of teaching in the schools of the city, together with its\r\naccompanying salary of a hundred crowns which he had enjoyed for so many\r\nyears, would not be handed on to me, as he had hoped, and he saw that a\r\nstranger would succeed to the same. Nor was that commentary of his\r\ndestined ever to see the light or to be illustrated by my notes. Earlier\r\nin life he had nourished a hope that his name might become illustrious as\r\nthe emendator of the 'Commentaries of John, Archbishop of Canterbury on\r\nOptics and Perspective.'[26] Indeed the following verses were printed\r\nthereanent:\r\n\r\n    'Hoc Cardana viro gaudet domus: omnia novit\r\n    Unus: habent nullum saecula nostra parem.'\r\n\r\n\"These words may be taken as a sort of augury referring rather to certain\r\nother men about to set forth to do their work in the world, than to my\r\nfather, who, except in the department of jurisprudence (of which indeed\r\nrumour says that he was a master), never let his mind take in aught that\r\nwas new. The rudiments of mathematics were all that he possessed, and he\r\ngathered no fresh knowledge from the store-houses of Greek learning. This\r\ndisposition in him was probably produced by the vast multitude of subjects\r\nto be mastered, and by his infirmity of purpose, rather than by any lack\r\nof natural parts, or by idleness or by defect of judgment; vices to which\r\nhe was in no way addicted. But I, being firmly set upon the object of my\r\nwishes, for the reasons given above, and because I perceived that my\r\nfather had achieved only moderate success--though he had encountered but\r\nfew hindrances--remained unconvinced by any of his exhortations.\"[27]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Bayle is unwilling to admit Cardan's illegitimate birth. In _De\r\nConsolatione_, Opera, tom. i. p. 619 (Lyons, 1663), Cardan writes in\r\nreference to the action of the Milanese College of Physicians: \"Medicorum\r\ncollegium, suspitione obortâ, quòd (tam malè à patre tractatus) spurius\r\nessem, repellebat.\" Bayle apparently had not read the _De Consolatione_,\r\nas he quotes the sentence as the work of a modern writer, and affirms that\r\nthe word \"suspitio\" would not have been used had the fact been notorious.\r\nBut in the _Dialogus de Morte_, Opera, tom. i. p. 676, Cardan declares\r\nthat his father openly spoke of him as a bastard.\r\n\r\n[2] _De Utilitate ex adversis Capienda_ (Franeker, 1648), p. 357.\r\n\r\n[3] Matteo Visconti was born in 1250, and died in 1322.

He had spent much time in the convent\r\nof his Order at Oxford, and there is a legend connecting him with a\r\nJohannes Juvenis or John of London, a youth who had attracted the\r\nattention and benevolence of Roger Bacon. This Johannes became one of the\r\nfirst mathematicians and opticians of the age, and was sent to Rome by\r\nBacon, who entrusted to him the works which he was sending to Pope Clement\r\nIV. There is no reason for this view beyond the fact that both were called\r\nJohn, and distinguished in the same branches of learning. The _Perspectiva\r\nCommunis_ was his principal work; it does not deal with perspective as now\r\nunderstood, but with elementary propositions of optics. It was first\r\nprinted in Milan in or about 1482.\r\n\r\n[27] _De Vita Propria_, ch. x. p. 34. A remark in _De Sapientia_, Opera,\r\ntom. i. p. 578, suggests that Fazio began life as a physician: \"Pater meus\r\nFacius Cardanus Medicus primò, inde Jurisconsultus factus est.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE University of Pavia to which Jerome now betook himself was by\r\ntradition one of the learned foundations of Charlemagne.[28] It had\r\ncertainly enjoyed a high reputation all through the Middle Ages, and had\r\nrecently had the honour of numbering Laurentius Valla amongst its\r\nprofessors. In 1362, Galeazzo Visconti had obtained a charter for it from\r\nthe Emperor Charles IV., and that it had become a place of consequence in\r\n1400 is proved by the fact that, besides maintaining several professors in\r\nthe Canon Law, it supported thirteen in Civil Law, five in Medicine, three\r\nin Philosophy, and one each in Astrology, Greek, and Eloquence. Like all\r\nthe other Universities of Northern Italy, it suffered occasional eclipse\r\nor even extinction on account of the constant war and desolation which\r\nvexed these parts almost without intermission during the years following\r\nthe formation of the League of Cambrai. Indeed, as recently as 1500, the\r\nfamous library collected by Petrarch, and presented by Gian Galeazzo\r\nVisconti to the University, was carried off by the French.[29]\r\n\r\nTo judge from the pictures which the Pavian student, writing in after\r\nyears, gives of his physical self, it may be inferred that he was\r\nill-endowed by the Graces. \"I am of middle height. My chest is somewhat\r\nnarrow and my arms exceedingly thin: my right hand is the more grossly\r\nfashioned of the two, so that a chiromantist might have set me down as\r\nrude or doltish: indeed, should such an one examine my hand, he would be\r\nashamed to say what he thought. In it the line of life is short, and that\r\nnamed after Saturn long and well marked. My left hand, however, is seemly,\r\nwith fingers long, tapering, and well-set, and shining nails. My neck is\r\nlonger and thinner than the rule, my chin is divided, my lower lip thick\r\nand pendulous, my eyes are very small, and it is my wont to keep them\r\nhalf-closed, peradventure lest I should discern things over clearly. My\r\nforehead is wide and bare of hair where it meets the temples. My hair and\r\nbeard are both of them yellow in tint, and both as a rule kept close cut.\r\nMy chin, which as I have said already is marked by a division, is covered\r\nin its lower part with a thick growth of long hair. My habit is to speak\r\nin a highly-pitched voice, so that my friends sometimes rebuke me\r\nthereanent; but, harsh and loud as is my voice, it cannot be heard at any\r\ngreat distance while I am lecturing. I am wont to talk too much, and in\r\nnone too urbane a tone. The look of my eyes is fixed, like that of one in\r\ndeep thought. My front teeth are large, and my complexion red and white:\r\nthe form of my countenance being somewhat elongated, and my head is\r\nfinished off in narrow wise at the back, like to a small sphere. Indeed,\r\nit was no rare thing for the painters, who came from distant countries to\r\npaint my portrait, to affirm that they could find no special\r\ncharacteristic which they could use for the rendering of my likeness, so\r\nthat I might be known by the same.\"[30]\r\n\r\nAfter giving this account of his person, Cardan writes down a catalogue of\r\nthe various diseases which vexed him from time to time, a chapter of\r\nautobiography which looks like a transcript from a dictionary of Nosology.\r\nMore interesting is the sketch which he makes of his mental state during\r\nthese early years. Boys brought up in company of their elders often show a\r\ntendency to introspection, and fall into a dreamy whimsical mood, and his\r\ncase is a striking example. \"By the command of my father I used to lie\r\nabed until nine o'clock,[31] and, if perchance I lay awake any time before\r\nthe wonted hour of rising, it was my habit to spend the same by conjuring\r\nup to sight all sorts of pleasant visions, nor can I remember that I ever\r\nsummoned these in vain. I used to behold figures of divers kinds like airy\r\nbodies. Meseemed they were made up of tiny rings, like those in coats of\r\nchain-armour, though at this time I had seen nought of the kind. They\r\nwould rise at the bottom of the bed, from the right-hand corner; and,\r\nmoving in a semi-circle, would pass slowly on and disappear in the left.\r\nMoreover I beheld the shapes of castles and houses, of horses and riders,\r\nof plants, trees, musical instruments, theatres, dresses of men of all\r\nsorts, and flute-players who seemed to be playing upon their instruments,\r\nbut neither voice nor sound was heard therefrom. And besides these things\r\nI beheld soldiers, and crowds of men, and fields, and certain bodily\r\nforms, which seem hateful to me even now: groves and forests, and divers\r\nother things which I now forget. In all this I took no small delight, and\r\nwith straining eyes I would gaze upon these marvels; wherefore my Aunt\r\nMargaret asked me more than once whether I saw anything. I, though I was\r\nthen only a child, deliberated over this question of hers before I\r\nreplied, saying to myself: 'If I tell her the facts she will be wroth at\r\nthe thing--whatever it may be--which is the cause of these phantasms, and\r\nwill deprive me of this delight.' And then I seemed to see flowers of all\r\nkinds, and four-footed beasts, and birds; but all these, though they were\r\nfashioned most beautifully, were lacking in colour, for they were things\r\nof air. Therefore I, who neither as a boy nor as an old man ever learned\r\nto lie, stood silent for some time. Then my aunt said--'Boy, what makes\r\nyou stare thus and stand silent?' I know not what answer I made, but I\r\nthink I said nothing at all. In my dreams I frequently saw what seemed to\r\nbe a cock, which I feared might speak to me in a human voice. This in\r\nsooth came to pass later on, and the words it spake were threatening ones,\r\nbut I cannot now recall what I may have heard on these occasions.\"[32]\r\n\r\nWith a brain capable of such remarkable exercises as the above-written\r\nvision, living his life in an atmosphere of books, and with all games and\r\nrelaxations dear to boys of his age denied to him, it was no marvel that\r\nJerome should make an early literary essay on his own account. The death\r\nof a young kinsman, Niccolo Cardano,[33] suggested to him a theme which he\r\nelaborated in a tract called _De immortalitate paranda_, a work which\r\nperished unlamented by its author, and a little later he wrote a treatise\r\non the calculation of the distances between the various heavenly\r\nbodies.[34] But he put his mathematical skill to other and more sinister\r\nuses than this; for, having gained practical experience at the\r\ngaming-tables, he combined this experience with his knowledge of the\r\nproperties of numbers, and wrote a tract on games of chance. Afterwards he\r\namplified this into his book, _Liber de Ludo Aleæ_.\r\n\r\nWith this equipment and discipline Jerome went to Pavia in 1520. He found\r\nlodging in the house of Giovanni Ambrogio Targio, and until the end of his\r\ntwenty-first year he spent all his time between Pavia and Milan. By this\r\ndate he had made sufficiently good use of his time to let the world see of\r\nwhat metal he was formed, for in the year following he had advanced far\r\nenough in learning to dispute in public, to teach Euclid in the Gymnasium,\r\nand to take occasional classes in Dialectics and Elementary Philosophy. At\r\nthe end of his twenty-second year the country was convulsed by the wars\r\nbetween the Spaniards and the French under Lautrec, which ended in the\r\nexpulsion of the last-named and the establishment of the Imperial power in\r\nMilan. Another result of the war, more germane to this history, was the\r\nclosing of the University of Pavia through lack of funds. In consequence\r\nof this calamity Jerome remained some time in Milan, and during these\r\nmonths he worked hard at mathematics; but he was not destined to return to\r\nPavia as a student. The schools there remained some long time in\r\nconfusion, so in 1524 he went with his father's consent to Padua. In the\r\nautumn of that same year he was summoned back to Milan to find Fazio in\r\nthe grip of his dying illness. \"Whereupon he, careful of my weal rather\r\nthan his own, bade me return to Padua at once, being well pleased to hear\r\nthat I had taken at the Venetian College the Baccalaureat of Arts.[35]\r\nAfter my return to Padua, letters were brought to me which told me that he\r\nhad died on the ninth day after he had refused nourishment. He died on the\r\ntwenty-eighth of August, having last eaten on Sunday the twentieth of the\r\nmonth. Towards the close of my twenty-fourth year I was chosen Rector of\r\nthe Academy at Padua,[36] and at the end of the next was made Doctor of\r\nMedicine. For the first-named office I came out the victor by one vote,\r\nthe suffrages having to be cast a second time; and for the Doctorate of\r\nMedicine my name had already twice come forth from the ballot with\r\nforty-seven votes cast against me (a circumstance which forbade another\r\nvoting after the third), when, at the third trial, I came out the winner,\r\nwith only nine votes against me (previously only this same number had been\r\ncast for me), and with forty-eight in my favour.\r\n\r\n\"Though I know well enough that affairs like these must needs be of small\r\naccount, I have set them down in the order in which they came to pass for\r\nno other reason than that I give pleasure to myself who write these words\r\nby so doing: and I do not write for the gratification of others. At the\r\nsame time those people who read what I write--if indeed any one should\r\never be so minded--may learn hereby that the beginnings and the outcomes\r\nof great events may well be found difficult to trace, because in sooth it\r\nis the way of such things to come to the notice of anybody rather than of\r\nthose who would rightly observe them.\"[37]\r\n\r\nPadua cannot claim for its University an antiquity as high as that which\r\nmay be conceded to Pavia, but in spite of its more recent origin, there is\r\nno little obscurity surrounding its rise. The one fact which may be put\r\ndown as certain is that it sprang originally from the University of\r\nBologna. Early in the thirteenth century violent discords arose between\r\nthe citizens of Bologna and the students, and there is a tradition that\r\nthe general school of teaching was transferred to Padua in 1222. What\r\nhappened was probably a large migration of students, part of whom remained\r\nbehind when peace between town and gown in Bologna was restored. The\r\northodox origin of the University is a charter granted by Frederic II. in\r\n1238. Frederic at this time was certainly trying to injure Bologna,\r\nactuated by a desire to help on his own University at Naples, and to crush\r\nBologna as a member of the Lombard League.[38] Padua, however, was also a\r\nmember of this league, so his benevolent action towards it is difficult to\r\nunderstand. In 1228 the students had quarrelled with the Paduan citizens,\r\nand there was a movement to migrate to Vercelli; but, whether this really\r\ntook place or not, the Paduan school did not suffer: its ruin and\r\nextinction was deferred till the despotism of the Ezzelini. In 1260 it\r\nwas again revived by a second migration from Bologna, and this movement\r\nwas increased on account of the interdict laid by the Pope upon Bologna in\r\n1306 after the expulsion of the Papal Legate by the citizens.\r\n\r\nIn the early days Medicine and Arts were entirely subordinate to the\r\nschools of canon and civil law; but by the end of the fourteenth century\r\nthese first-named Faculties had obtained a certain degree of independence,\r\nand were allowed an equal share in appointing the Rector.[39] The first\r\nCollege was founded in 1363, and after 1500 the number rapidly increased.\r\nThe dominion of the Dukes of Carrara after 1322 was favourable to the\r\ngrowth of the University, which, however, did not attain its highest point\r\ntill it came under Venetian rule in 1404. The Venetian government raised\r\nthe stipends of the professors, and allowed four Paduan citizens to act as\r\n_Tutores Studii_; the election of the professors being vested in the\r\nstudents, which custom obtained until the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury.[40] The Rector was allowed to wear a robe of purple and gold;\r\nand, when he retired, the degree of Doctor was granted to him, together\r\nwith the right to wear the golden collar of the order of Saint Mark.\r\n\r\nPadua like Athens humanized its conquerors. It became the University town\r\nof Venice, as Pavia was of Milan, and it was for a long time protected\r\nfrom the assaults of the Catholic reaction by its rulers, who possibly\r\nwere instigated rather by political jealousy of the Papacy as a temporal\r\npower, than by any enthusiasm for the humanist and scientific studies of\r\nwhich Padua was the most illustrious home south of the Alps; studies which\r\nthe powers of the Church began already to recognize as their most\r\ndangerous foes.\r\n\r\nSuch was the University of Padua at the height of its glory, and it will\r\nbe apparent at once that Padua must have fallen considerably in its\r\nfortunes when it installed as its Rector an obscure student, only\r\ntwenty-four years of age, and of illegitimate birth, and conferred upon\r\nhim the right to go clad in purple and gold, and to claim, as his\r\nretiring gift, the degree of Doctor and the cross of Saint Mark. In 1508\r\nthe League of Cambrai had been formed, and Venice, not yet recovered\r\nfrom the effects of its disastrous wars with Bajazet II., was forced to\r\nmeet the combined assault of the Pope, the Emperor, and the King of\r\nFrance. Padua was besieged by the Imperial forces, a motley horde of\r\nGermans, Swiss, and Spaniards, and the surrounding country was pillaged\r\nand devastated by these savages with a cruelty which recalled the days\r\nof Attila. It is not wonderful that the University closed its doors in\r\nsuch a time. When the confederates began to fight amongst themselves the\r\nclass-rooms were reopened, intermittently at first, but after 1515 the\r\nteaching seems to have been continuous. Still the prevalent turmoil and\r\npoverty rendered it necessary to curtail all the mere honorary and\r\nornamental adjuncts of the schools, and for several years no Rector was\r\nappointed, for the good and sufficient reason that no man of due\r\nposition and wealth and character could be found to undertake the\r\nrectorial duties, with the Academy just emerging from complete\r\ndisorganization. These duties were many and important, albeit the Rector\r\ncould, if he willed, appoint a deputy, and the calls upon the purse of\r\nthe holder must have been very heavy. It would be hard to imagine any\r\none less fitted to fill such a post than Cardan, and assuredly no office\r\ncould befit him less than this pseudo-rectorship.[41] It must ever\r\nremain a mystery why he was preferred, why he was elected, and why he\r\nconsented to serve: though, as to the last-named matter, he hints in a\r\npassage lately cited from _De Utilitate_, that it was through the\r\npersuasions of his mother that he took upon himself this disastrous\r\nhonour. Many pasages in his writings suggest that Chiara was an\r\nindulgent parent. She let Fazio have no peace till he consented to allow\r\nthe boy to go to college; she paid secretly for music-lessons, so that\r\nJerome was enabled to enjoy the relaxation he loved better than anything\r\nelse in the world--except gambling; she paid all his charges during his\r\nstudent life at Padua; and now, quite naturally, she would have shed her\r\nheart's blood rather than let this son of hers--ugly duckling as he\r\nwas--miss what she deemed to be the crowning honour of the rectorship;\r\nbut after all the sacrifices Chiara made, after all the misfortunes\r\nwhich attended Jerome's ill-directed ambition, there is a doubt as to\r\nwhether he ever was Rector in the full sense of the term. Many times and\r\nin divers works he affirms that once upon a time he was Rector, and over\r\nand beyond this he sets down in black and white the fact, more than\r\nonce, that he never told a lie; so it is only polite to accept this\r\nlegend for what it is worth. But it must likewise be noted that in the\r\nextant records of the University there is no mention of his name in the\r\nlists of Rectors.[42]\r\n\r\nJerome has left very few details as to his life at Padua. Of those which\r\nhe notices the following are the most interesting: \"In 1525, the year in\r\nwhich I became Rector, I narrowly escaped drowning in the Lago di Garda. I\r\nwent on board the boat, unwillingly enough, which carried likewise some\r\nhired horses; and, as we sailed on, the mast and the rudder, and one of\r\nthe two oars we had with us, were broken by the wind. The sails, even\r\nthose on the smaller mast, were split, and the night came on. We landed at\r\nlast safe and sound at Sirmio, but not before all my companions had given\r\nup hope, and I myself was beginning to despair. Indeed, had we been a\r\nminute later we must have perished, for the tempest was so violent that\r\nthe iron hinges of the inn windows were bent thereby. I, though I had been\r\nsore afraid ever since the wind began to blow, fell to supper with a good\r\nheart when the host set upon the board a mighty pike, but none of the\r\nothers had any stomach for food, except the one passenger who had advised\r\nus to make trial of this perilous adventure, and who had proved to be an\r\nable and courageous helper in our hour of distress.\r\n\r\n\"Again, once when I was in Venice on the birthday of the Virgin, I lost\r\nsome money at dicing, and on the day following all that was left me went\r\nthe same way. This happened in the house of the man with whom I was\r\ngambling, and in the course of play I noticed that the cards were marked,\r\nwhereupon I struck him in the face with my dagger, wounding him slightly.\r\nTwo of his servants were present at the time; some spears hung all ready\r\nfrom the beams of the roof, and besides this the house door was fastened.\r\nBut when I had taken from him all the money he had about him--his own as\r\nwell as that which he had won from me by cheating, and my cloak and the\r\nrings which I had lost to him the day before--I was satisfied that I had\r\ngot back all my possessions. The chattels I sent home by my servant at\r\nonce, but a portion of the money I tossed back to the fellow when I saw\r\nthat I had drawn blood of him. Then I attacked the servants who were\r\nstanding by; and, as they knew not how to use their weapons and besought\r\nmy mercy, I granted this on the condition that they should unlock the\r\ndoor. Their master, taking account of the uproar and confusion, and\r\nmistrusting his safety in case the affair should not be settled forthwith\r\n(I suspect he was alarmed about the marked cards), commanded the servants\r\nto open the door, whereupon I went my way.\r\n\r\n\"That very same evening, while I was doing my best to escape the notice of\r\nthe officers of justice on account of the wound I had given to this\r\nSenator, I lost my footing and fell into a canal, having arms under my\r\ncloak the while. In my fall I did not lose my nerve, but flinging out my\r\nright arm, I grasped the thwart of a passing boat and was rescued by those\r\non board. When I had been hauled into the boat I discovered--wonderful to\r\nrelate--that the man with whom I had lately played cards was likewise on\r\nboard, with his face bandaged by reason of the wounds I had given him.\r\nNow of his own accord he brought out a suit of clothes, fitted for\r\nseafaring, and, having clad myself in them, I journeyed with him as far as\r\nPadua.\"[43]\r\n\r\nCardan's life from rise to set cannot be estimated otherwise than an\r\nunhappy one, and its least fortunate years were probably those lying\r\nbetween his twenty-first and his thirty-first year of age. During this\r\nperiod he was guilty of that crowning folly, the acceptance of the\r\nRectorship of the Gymnasium at Padua, he felt the sharpest stings of\r\npoverty, and his life was overshadowed by dire physical misfortune. He\r\ngives a rapid sketch of the year following his father's death. \"Then, my\r\nfather having breathed his last and my term of office come to an end, I\r\nwent, at the beginning of my twenty-sixth year, to reside at Sacco, a town\r\ndistant ten miles from Padua and twenty-five from Venice. I fixed on this\r\nplace by the advice of Francesco Buonafidei, a physician of Padua, who,\r\nalbeit I brought no profit to him--not even being one of those who\r\nattended his public teaching--helped me and took a liking for me, being\r\nmoved to this benevolence by his exceeding goodness of heart. In this\r\nplace I lived while our State was being vexed by every sort of calamity.\r\nIn 1524 by a raging pestilence and by a two-fold change of ruler. In 1526\r\nand 1527 by a destructive scarcity of the fruits of the earth. It was hard\r\nto get corn in exchange for money of any kind, and over and beyond this\r\nwas the intolerable weight of taxation. In 1528 the land was visited by\r\ndivers diseases and by the plague as well, but these afflictions seemed\r\nthe easier to bear because all other parts were likewise suffering from\r\nthe same. In 1529 I ventured to return to Milan--these ill-starred\r\ntroubles being in some degree abated--but I was refused membership by the\r\nCollege of Physicians there, I was unable to settle my lawsuit with the\r\nBarbiani, and I found my mother in a very ill humour, so I went back to my\r\nvillage home, having suffered greatly in health during my absence. For\r\nwhat with cruel vexations, and struggles, and cares which I saw impending,\r\nand a troublesome cough and pleurisy aggravated by a copious discharge of\r\nhumour, I was brought into a condition such as few men exchange for aught\r\nelse besides a coffin.\"[44]\r\n\r\nThe closing words of his eulogy on his father tell how the son, on the\r\nfather's death, found that one small house was all he could call his own.\r\nThe explanation of this seems to be that the old man, being of a careless\r\ndisposition and litigious to boot, had left his affairs in piteous\r\ndisorder. In consequence of this neglect Jerome was involved in lawsuits\r\nfor many years, and the one afore-mentioned with the Barbiani was one of\r\nthem. This case was subsequently settled in Jerome's favour.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[28] Pavia, like certain modern universities, did not spend all its time\r\nover study. \"Aggressus sum Mediolani vacationibus quadragenariæ, seu\r\nBacchanalium potius, anni MDLXI.

The record of his life during\r\nthese years gives the impression that he must have been one of the most\r\nwretched of living mortals. The country was vexed by every sort of\r\nmisfortune, by prolonged warfare, by raging pestilence, by famine, and by\r\nintolerable taxation;[46] but while he paints this picture of misery and\r\ndesolation in one place, he goes on to declare in another that the time\r\nwhich he spent at Sacco was the happiest he ever knew.[47] No greater\r\ninstance of inconsistency is to be found in his pages. He writes: \"I\r\ngambled, I occupied myself with music, I walked abroad, I feasted, giving\r\nscant attention the while to my studies. I feared no hurt, I paid my\r\nrespects to the Venetian gentlemen living in the town, and frequented\r\ntheir houses. I, too, was in the very flower of my age, and no time could\r\nhave been more delightful than this which lasted for five years and a\r\nhalf.\"[48]\r\n\r\nBut for almost the whole of this period Cardan was labouring under a\r\nphysical misfortune concerning which he writes in another place in terms\r\nof almost savage bitterness. During ten years of his life, from his\r\ntwenty-first to his thirty-first year, he suffered from the loss of virile\r\npower, a calamity which he laments in the following words: \"And I maintain\r\nthat this misfortune was to me the worst of evils. Compared with it\r\nneither the harsh servitude under my father, nor unkindness, nor the\r\ntroubles of litigation, nor the wrongs done me by my fellow-townsmen, nor\r\nthe scorn of my fellow-physicians, nor the ill things falsely spoken\r\nagainst me, nor all the measureless mass of possible evil, could have\r\nbrought me to such despair, and hatred of life, and distaste of all\r\npleasure, and lasting sorrow. I bitterly wept this misery, that I must\r\nneeds be a laughing-stock, that marriage must be denied me, and that I\r\nmust ever live in solitude. You ask for the cause of this misfortune, a\r\nmatter which I am quite unable to explain. Because of the reasons just\r\nmentioned, and because I dreaded that men should know how grave was the\r\nill afflicting me, I shunned the society of women; and, on account of this\r\nhabit, the same miserable public scandal which I desired so earnestly to\r\navoid, arose concerning me, and brought upon me the suspicion of still\r\nmore nefarious practices: in sooth it seemed that there was no further\r\ncalamity left for me to endure.\"[49] After reading these words, it is hard\r\nto believe that a man, afflicted with a misfortune which he characterizes\r\nin these terms, could have been even moderately happy; much less in that\r\nstate of bliss which he sits down to describe forty years afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut the end of his life at Sacco was fated to be happier than the\r\nbeginning, and it is possible that memories of the last months he spent\r\nthere may have helped to colour with rosy tint the picture of happiness\r\nrecently referred to. In the first place he was suddenly freed from his\r\nphysical infirmity, and shortly after his restoration he met and married\r\nthe woman who, as long as she lived with him, did all that was possible to\r\nmake him happy. Every momentous event of Cardan's life--and many a\r\ntrifling one as well--was heralded by some manifestation of the powers\r\nlying beyond man's cognition. In writing about the signs and tokens which\r\nserved as premonitions of his courtship and marriage, he glides easily\r\ninto a description of the events themselves in terms which are worth\r\nproducing. \"In times past I had my home in Sacco, and there I led a joyful\r\nlife, as if I were a man unvexed by misfortune (I recall this circumstance\r\nsomewhat out of season, but the dream I am about to tell of seems only too\r\nappropriate to the occasion), or a mortal made free of the habitations of\r\nthe blest, or rather of some region of delight. Then, on a certain night,\r\nI seemed to find myself in a pleasant garden, beautiful exceedingly,\r\ndecked with flowers and filled with fruits of divers sorts, and a soft air\r\nbreathed around. So lovely was it all that no painter nor our poet Pulci,\r\nnor any imagination of man could have figured the like. I was standing in\r\nthe forecourt of this garden, the door whereof was open, and there was\r\nanother door on the opposite side, when lo! I beheld before me a damsel\r\nclad in white. I embraced and kissed her; but before I could kiss her\r\nagain, the gardener closed the door. I straightway begged him earnestly\r\nthat he would open it again, but I begged in vain; wherefore, plunged in\r\ngrief and clinging to the damsel, I seemed to be shut out of the garden.\r\n\r\n\"A little time after this there was a rumour in the town of a house on\r\nfire, and I was roused from sleep to hurry to the spot. Then I learned\r\nthat the house belonged to one Altobello Bandarini,[50] a captain of the\r\nVenetian levies in the district of Padua. I had no acquaintance with him,\r\nin sooth I scarcely knew him by sight. Now it chanced that after the fire\r\nhe hired a house next door to my own, a step which displeased me somewhat,\r\nfor such a neighbour was not to my taste; but what was I to do? After the\r\nlapse of a few days, when I was in the street, I perceived a young girl\r\nwho, as to her face and her raiment, was the exact image of her whom I had\r\nbeheld in my dream. But I said to myself, 'What is this girl to me? If I,\r\npoor wretch that I am, take to wife a girl dowered with naught, except a\r\ncrowd of brothers and sisters, it will be all over with me; forasmuch as I\r\ncan hardly keep myself as it is. If I should attempt to carry her off, or\r\nto have my will of her by stealth, there will of a surety be some\r\ntale-bearers about; and her father, being a fellow-townsman and a soldier\r\nto boot, would not sit down lightly under such an injury. In this case, or\r\nin that, it is hard to say what course I should follow, for if this\r\naffair should come to the issue I most desire, I must needs fly the\r\nplace.' From that same hour these thoughts and others akin to them\r\npossessed my brain, which was only too ready to harbour them, and I felt\r\nit would be better to die than to live on in such perplexity. Thenceforth\r\nI was as one love-possessed, or even burnt up with passion, and I\r\nunderstood what meaning I might gather from the reading of my dream.\r\nMoreover I was by this time freed from the chain which had held me back\r\nfrom marriage. Thus I, a willing bridegroom, took a willing bride, her\r\nkinsfolk questioning us how this thing had been brought about, and\r\noffering us any help which might be of service; which help indeed proved\r\nof very substantial benefit.\r\n\r\n\"But the interpretation of my dreams did not work itself out entirely in\r\nthe after life of my wife; it made itself felt likewise in the lives of my\r\nchildren. My wife lived with me fifteen years, and alas! this ill-advised\r\nmarriage was the cause of all the misfortunes which subsequently happened\r\nto me. These must have come about either by the working of the divine\r\nwill, or as the recompense due for some ill deeds wrought by myself or by\r\nmy forefathers.\"[51]\r\n\r\nThe dream aforesaid was not the only portent having reference to his\r\nmarriage. After describing shakings and tremblings of his bed, for which\r\nindeed a natural cause was not far to seek, he tells how in 1531 a certain\r\ndog, of gentle temper as a rule, and quiet, kept up a persistent howling\r\nfor a long time; how some ravens perched on the house-top and began\r\ncroaking in an unusual manner; and how, when his servant was breaking up a\r\nfaggot, some sparks of fire flew out of the same; whereupon, \"by an\r\nunlooked-for step I married a wife, and from that time divers misfortunes\r\nhave attended me.\"[52] Lucia, the wife of his choice, was the eldest\r\ndaughter of Altobello Bandarini, who had, besides her, three daughters and\r\nfour sons. Jerome, as it has been already noted, was possessed with a fear\r\nlest he should be burdened by his brothers- and sisters-in-law after his\r\nmarriage; but, considering that he was a young unknown physician, without\r\neither money or patients, and that Bandarini was a man of position and\r\nrepute, with some wealth and more shrewdness, the chances were that the\r\nburden would lie on the other side. Cardan seems to have inherited Fazio's\r\ncontempt for wealth, or at least to have made a profession thereof; for,\r\nin chronicling the event of his marriage, he sets down, with a certain\r\ndegree of pomposity, that he took a wife without a dower on account of a\r\ncertain vow he had sworn.[53] If the bride was penniless the father-in-law\r\nwas wealthy, and the last-named fact might well have proved a powerful\r\nargument to induce Cardan to remain at Sacco, albeit he had little scope\r\nfor his calling. That he soon determined to quit the place, is an evidence\r\nof his independence of spirit, and of his disinclination to sponge upon\r\nhis well-to-do connections. Bandarini, when this scheme was proposed to\r\nhim, vetoed it at once. He was unwilling to part with his daughter, and\r\npossibly he may have taken a fancy to his son-in-law, for Cardan has left\r\nit on record that Bandarini was greatly pleased with the match; he ended,\r\nhowever, by consenting to the migration, which was not made without the\r\nintervention of a warning portent. A short time before the young couple\r\ndeparted, it happened that a tile got mixed with the embers in Bandarini's\r\nbed-chamber; and, in the course of the night, exploded with a loud\r\nreport, and the fragments thereof were scattered around. This event\r\nBandarini regarded as an augury of evil, and indeed evil followed swiftly\r\nafter. Before a year had passed he was dead, some holding that his death\r\nhad been hastened by the ill conduct of his eldest son, and others\r\nwhispering suspicions of poison.\r\n\r\nJerome and his young wife betook themselves to Milan, but this visit seems\r\nto have been fully as unprofitable as the one he had paid in 1529. In that\r\nyear he had to face his first rejection by the College of Physicians, when\r\nhe made application for admission; and there is indirect evidence that he\r\nnow made a second application with no better result.[54] In any case his\r\naffairs were in a very bad way. If he had money in his pocket he would not\r\nkeep long away from the gaming-table; and, with the weight of trouble ever\r\nbearing him down more and more heavily, it is almost certain that his\r\nspirits must have suffered, and that poor Lucia must have passed many an\r\nunhappy hour on account of his nervous irritability. Then the gates of his\r\nprofession remained closed to him by the action of the College. The\r\npretext the authorities gave for their refusal to admit him was his\r\nillegitimate birth; but it is not unlikely that they may have mistrusted\r\nas a colleague the son of Fazio Cardano, and that stories of the\r\nprofligate life and the intractable temper of the candidate may have been\r\nbrought to them.[55] His health suffered from the bad air of the city\r\nalmost as severely as before, and Lucia, who was at this time pregnant,\r\nmiscarried at four months, and shortly afterwards had a second misfortune\r\nof the same kind. His mother's temper was not of the sweetest, and it is\r\nquite possible that between her and her daughter-in-law there may have\r\nbeen strained relations. Cardan at any rate found that he must once more\r\nbeat a retreat from Milan, wherefore, at the end of April 1533, he made up\r\nhis mind to remove to Gallarate.\r\n\r\nThis town has already been mentioned as chief place of the district, from\r\nwhich the Cardan family took its origin. Before going thither Jerome had\r\nevidently weighed the matter well, and he has set down at some length the\r\nreasons which led him to make this choice. \"Thus, acting under the reasons\r\naforesaid (the family associations), I resolved to go to Gallarate, in\r\norder that I might have the enjoyment of four separate advantages which it\r\noffered. Firstly, that in the most healthy air of the place I might shake\r\noff entirely the distemper which I had contracted in Milan. Secondly, that\r\nI might earn something by my profession, seeing that then I should be free\r\nto practise. Thirdly, that there would be no need for me to pine away\r\nwhile I beheld those physicians, by whom I reckoned I had been despoiled,\r\nflourishing in wealth and in the high estimation of all men. Lastly, that\r\nby following a more frugal way of life, I might make what I possessed last\r\nthe longer. For all things are cheaper in the country, since they have to\r\nbe carried from the country into the town, and many necessaries may be had\r\nfor the asking. Persuaded by these arguments, I went to this place, and I\r\nwas not altogether deceived, seeing that I recovered my health, and the\r\nson--who was to be reft from me later on by the Senate--was born to\r\nme.\"[56]\r\n\r\nEmployment at Gallarate was, however, almost as scarce as it had been at\r\nSacco, wherefore Jerome found leisure in plenty for literary work. He\r\nbegan a treatise on Fate; but, even had this been completed, it would\r\nscarcely have filled the empty larder by the proceeds of its sale. More\r\nprofitable was some chance employment which was given to him by Filippo\r\nArchinto,[57] a generous and accomplished young nobleman of Milan, who was\r\nambitious to figure as a writer on Astronomy, and, it may be remarked,\r\nArchinto's benefactions were not confined to the payment for the hack work\r\nwhich Jerome did for him at this period. Had it not been for his\r\nsubsequent patronage and support, it is quite possible that Cardan would\r\nhave gone under in the sea of adversity.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the cheapness of provisions at Gallarate, and of occasional\r\nmeals taken gratis from the fields, complete destitution seemed to be only\r\na matter of days, and just at this crisis, to add to his\r\nembarrassments--though he longed earnestly for the event--Lucia was\r\nbrought to bed with her first-born living child on May 14, 1534. The\r\nchild's birth was accompanied by divers omens, one of which the father\r\ndescribes, finding therein some premonition of future disaster. \"I had\r\ngreat fear of his life until the fifteenth day of June, on which day,\r\nbeing a Sunday, he was baptized. The sun shone brightly into the\r\nbed-chamber: it was between the hours of eleven and twelve in the\r\nforenoon; and, according to custom, we were all gathered round the\r\nmother's bed except a young servant, the curtain was drawn away from the\r\nwindow and fastened to the wall, when suddenly a large wasp flew into the\r\nroom, and circled round the infant. We were all greatly afeard for the\r\nchild, but the wasp did him no hurt. The next moment it came against the\r\ncurtain, making so great a noise that you would have said that a drum was\r\nbeing beaten, and all ran towards the place, but found no trace of the\r\nwasp. It could not have flown out of the room, because all eyes had been\r\nfixed upon it. Then all of us who were then present felt some foreboding\r\nof what subsequently came to pass, but did not deem that the end would be\r\nso bitter as it proved to be.\"[58]\r\n\r\nThe impulse which drives men in desperate straits to seek shelter in the\r\nstreets of a city was as strong in Cardan's time as it is to-day. At\r\nGallarate the last coin was now spent, and there was an extra mouth to\r\nfeed. There seemed to be no other course open but another retreat to\r\nMilan. Archinto was rich in literary ambitions, which might perchance\r\nstimulate him to find farther work for the starving scholar: and there was\r\nChiara also who would scarcely let her grandchild die of want. The\r\nrevelation which Cardan makes of himself and of his way of life at this\r\ntime is not one to enlist sympathy for him entirely; but it is not wanting\r\nin a note of pathetic sincerity. \"For a long time the College at Milan\r\nrefused to admit me, and during these days I was assuredly a spendthrift\r\nand heedless. In body I was weakly, and in estate plundered by thieves on\r\nall sides, yet I never grudged money for the buying of books. My residence\r\nat Gallarate brought me no profit, for in the whole nineteen months I\r\nlived there, I did not receive more than twenty-five crowns towards the\r\nrent of the house I hired. I had such ill luck with the dice that I was\r\nforced to pawn all my wife's jewels, and our very bed. If it is a wonder\r\nthat I found myself thus bereft of all my substance, it is still more\r\nwonderful that I did not take to begging on account of my poverty, and a\r\nwonder greater still that I harboured in my mind no unworthy thoughts\r\nagainst my forefathers, or against right living, or against those honours\r\nwhich I had won--honours which afterwards stood me in good stead--but bore\r\nmy misfortunes with mind undisturbed.\"[59]\r\n\r\nCardan's worldly fortunes were now at their lowest ebb. Burdened with a\r\nwife and child, he had found it necessary to return, after a second futile\r\nattempt to gain a living by his calling in a country town, to Milan, his\r\n\"stony-hearted step-mother.\" If he had reckoned on his mother's bounty he\r\nwas doomed to disappointment, for Chiara was an irritable woman, and as\r\nher son's temper was none of the sweetest, it is almost certain that they\r\nmust have quarrelled occasionally. It is hard to believe that they could\r\nhave been on good terms at this juncture, otherwise she would scarcely\r\nhave allowed him to take his wife and child to what was then the public\r\nworkhouse of the city;[60] but this place was his only refuge, and in\r\nOctober 1534 he was glad to shelter himself beneath its roof.\r\n\r\nThere was in Cardan's nature a strong vein of melancholy, and up to the\r\ndate now under consideration he had been the victim of a fortune\r\ncalculated to deepen rather than disperse his morbid tendencies. A proof\r\nof his high courage and dauntless perseverance may be deduced from the\r\nfact that neither poverty, nor the sense of repeated failure, nor the\r\nflouts of the Milanese doctors, prevailed at any time to quench in his\r\nheart the love of fame,[61] or to disabuse him of the conviction that he,\r\npoverty-stricken wretch as he was, would before long bind Fortune to his\r\nchariot-wheels, and would force the adverse world to acknowledge him as\r\none of its master minds. The dawn was now not far distant, but the last\r\nhours of his night of misfortune were very dark. The worst of the\r\nstruggle, as far as the world was concerned, was over, and the sharpest\r\nsorrows and the heaviest disgrace reserved for Cardan in the future were\r\nto be those nourished in his own household.\r\n\r\nWriting of his way of life and of the vices and defects of his character,\r\nhe says: \"If a man shall fail in his carriage before the world as he fails\r\nin other things, who shall correct him? Thus I myself will do duty for\r\nthat one leper who alone out of the ten who were healed came back to our\r\nLord. By reasoning of this sort, Physicians and Astrologers trace back the\r\norigin of our natural habits to our primal qualities, to the training of\r\nour will, and to our occupations and conversation. In every man all these\r\nare found in proper ratio to the time of life of each individual;\r\nnevertheless it will be easy to discern marked variations in cases\r\notherwise similar. Therefore it behoves us to hold fast to some guiding\r\nprinciple chosen out of these, and I on my part am inclined, as far as it\r\nmay be allowed, to say with respect to all of them, [Greek: gnôthi\r\nseauton].\r\n\r\n\"My own nature in sooth was never a mystery to myself. I was ever\r\nhot-tempered, single-minded, and given to women. From these cardinal\r\ntendencies there proceeded truculence of temper, wrangling, obstinacy,\r\nrudeness of carriage, anger, and an inordinate desire, or rather a\r\nheadstrong passion, for revenge in respect to any wrong done to me; so\r\nthat this inclination, which is censured by many, became to me a delight.\r\nTo put it briefly, I held _At vindicta bonum vita jucundius ipsa_. As a\r\ngeneral rule I went astray but seldom, though it is a common saying,\r\n'_Natura nostra prona est ad malum_.' I am moreover truthful, mindful of\r\nbenefits wrought to me, a lover of justice and of my own people, a\r\ndespiser of money, a worshipper of that fame which defies death, prone to\r\nthrust aside what is commonplace, and still more disposed to treat mere\r\ntrifles in the same way. Still, knowing well how great may be the power of\r\nlittle things at any moment during the course of an undertaking, I never\r\nmake light of aught which may be useful. By nature I am prone to every\r\nvice and ill-doing except ambition, and I, if no one else does, know my\r\nown imperfections. But because of my veneration for God, and because I\r\nrecognize the vanity and emptiness of all things of this sort, it often\r\nhappens that, of my own free will, I forego certain opportunities for\r\ntaking revenge which may be offered to me. I am timid, with a cold heart\r\nand a hot brain, given to reflection and the consideration of things many\r\nand mighty, and even of things which can never come to pass. I can even\r\nlet my thoughts concern themselves with two distinct subjects at the same\r\ntime. Those who throw out charges of garrulity and extravagance by way of\r\ncontradicting any praise accorded to me, charge me with the faults of\r\nothers rather than my own. I attack no man, I only defend myself.\r\n\r\n\"And what reason is there why I should spend myself in this cause since I\r\nhave so often borne witness of the emptiness of this life of ours? My\r\nexcuse must be that certain men have praised me, wherefore they cannot\r\ndeem me altogether wicked. I have always trained myself to let my face\r\ncontradict my thoughts. Thus while I can simulate what is not, I cannot\r\ndissimulate what is. To accomplish this is no difficult task if a man\r\ncultivates likewise the habit of hoping for nothing. By striving for\r\nfifteen years to compass this end and by spending much trouble over the\r\nsame I at last succeeded. Urged on by this humour I sometimes go forth in\r\nrags, sometimes finely dressed, sometimes silent, sometimes talkative,\r\nsometimes joyful, sometimes sad; and on this account my two-fold mood\r\nshows everything double. In my youth I rarely spent any care in keeping my\r\nhair in order, because of my inclination for other pursuits more to my\r\ntaste. My gait is irregular. I move now quickly, now slowly. When I am at\r\nhome I go with my legs naked as far as the ankles. I am slack in duty and\r\nreckless in speech, and specially prone to show irritation over anything\r\nwhich may disgust or irk me.\"\r\n\r\nThe above-written self-description does not display a personality\r\nparticularly attractive. Jerome Cardan was one of those men who experience\r\na morbid gratification in cataloguing all their sinister points of\r\ncharacter, and exaggerating them at the same time; and in this picture, as\r\nin many others scattered about the _De Vita Propria_, the shadows may have\r\nbeen put in too strongly.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages reference was made to certain acts of benevolence\r\ndone to Cardan by the family of Archinto. It is not impossible that the\r\npromises and persuasions of his young patron Filippo may have had some\r\nweight in inducing Jerome to shift his home once more. Whatever befell he\r\ncould hardly make his case worse; but whether Filippo had promised help or\r\nnot, he showed himself now a true and valuable friend. There was in Milan\r\na public lectureship in geometry and astronomy supported by a small\r\nendowment left by a certain Tommaso Plat, and to this post, which happened\r\nopportunely to be vacant, Cardan was appointed by the good offices of\r\nFilippo Archinto. Yet even when he was literally a pauper he seems to have\r\nfelt some scruples about accepting this office, but fortunately in this\r\ninstance his poverty overcame his pride. The salary was indeed a very\r\nsmall one,[62] and the lecturer was not suffered to handle the whole of\r\nit, but it was at least liberal enough to banish the dread of starvation,\r\nand his duties, which consisted solely in the preparation and delivery of\r\nhis lectures, did not debar him from literary work on his own account.\r\nWherefore in his leisure time he worked hard at his desk.\r\n\r\nAny differences which may have existed between him and his mother were now\r\nremoved, for he took her to live with him, the household being made up of\r\nhimself, his wife, his mother, a friend (a woman), a nurse, the little\r\nboy, a man- and maidservant, and a mule.[63] Possibly Chiara brought her\r\nown income with her, and thus allowed the establishment to be conducted on\r\na more liberal scale. The Plat lectureship would scarcely have maintained\r\nthree servants, and Jerome's gains from other sources must have been as\r\nyet very slender. His life at this time was a busy one, but he always\r\ncontrived to portion out his days in such wise that certain hours were\r\nleft for recreation. At such times as he was called upon to teach, the\r\nclass-room, of course, had the first claims. After the lecture he would\r\nwalk in the shade outside the city walls, then return to his dinner, then\r\ndivert himself with music, and afterwards go fishing in the pools and\r\nstreams hard by the town. In the course of time he obtained other\r\nemployment, being appointed physician to the Augustinian friars. The Prior\r\nof this Order, Francesco Gaddi, was indeed his first patient of note. He\r\ntells how he cured this man of a biennial leprosy after treating him for\r\nsix months;[64] adding that his labour was in vain, inasmuch as Gaddi died\r\na violent death afterwards. The refusal of the College of Milan to admit\r\nhim to membership did not forbid him to prescribe for whatever patients\r\nmight like to consult him by virtue of his Paduan degree. He read\r\nvoraciously everything which came in his way, and it must have been during\r\nthese years that he stored his memory with that vast collection of facts\r\nout of which he subsequently compounded the row of tomes which form his\r\nlegacy to posterity. Filippo Archinto was unfailing in his kindness, and\r\nJerome at this time was fortunate enough to attract the attention of\r\ncertain other Milanese citizens of repute who afterwards proved to be\r\nvaluable friends; Ludovico Madio, Girolamo Guerrini a jeweller, Francesco\r\nBelloti, and Francesco della Croce. The last-named was a skilled\r\njurisconsult, whose help proved of great service in a subsequent\r\nlitigation between Jerome and the College of Physicians.\r\n\r\nAll his life long Cardan was a dreamer of dreams, and he gives an account\r\nof one of his visions in this year, 1534, which, whether regarded as an\r\nallegory or as a portent, is somewhat remarkable. \"In the year 1534, when\r\nI was as it were groping in the dark, when I had settled naught as to my\r\nfuture life, and when my case seemed to grow more desperate day by day, I\r\nbeheld in a dream the figure of myself running towards the base of a\r\nmountain which stood upon my right hand, in company with a vast crowd of\r\npeople of every station and age and sex--women, men, old men, boys,\r\ninfants, poor men and rich men, clad in raiment of every sort. I inquired\r\nwhither we were all running, whereupon one of the multitude answered that\r\nwe were all hastening on to death. I was greatly terrified at these words,\r\nwhen I perceived a mountain on my left hand. Then, having turned myself\r\nround so that it stood on my right side, I grasped the vines (which, here\r\nin the midst of the mountains and as far as the place wherein I stood,\r\nwere covered with dry leaves, and bare of grapes, as we commonly see them\r\nin autumn) and began to ascend. At first I found this difficult, for the\r\nreason that the mountain was very steep round the base, but having\r\nsurmounted this I made my way upward easily. When I had come to the summit\r\nit seemed that I was like to pass beyond the dictates of my own will.\r\nSteep naked rocks appeared on every side, and I narrowly escaped falling\r\ndown from a great height into a gloomy chasm. So dreadful is all this that\r\nnow, what though forty years have rolled away, the memory thereof still\r\nsaddens and terrifies me. Then, having turned towards the right where I\r\ncould see naught but a plain covered with heath, I took that path out of\r\nfear, and, as I wended thither in reckless mood, I found that I had come\r\nto the entrance of a rude hut, thatched with straw and reeds and rushes,\r\nand that I held by my right hand a boy about twelve years of age and clad\r\nin a grey garment. Then at this very moment I was aroused from sleep, and\r\nmy dream vanished.\r\n\r\n\"In this vision was clearly displayed the deathless name which was to be\r\nmine, my life of heavy and ceaseless work, my imprisonment, my seasons of\r\ngrievous terror and sadness, and my abiding-place foreshadowed as\r\ninhospitable, by the sharp stones I beheld: barren, by the want of trees\r\nand of all serviceable plants; but destined to be, nevertheless, in the\r\nend happy, and righteous, and easy. This dream told also of my lasting\r\nfame in the future, seeing that the vine yields a harvest every year. As\r\nto the boy, if he were indeed my good spirit, the omen was lucky, for I\r\nheld him very close. If he were meant to foreshadow my grandson it would\r\nbe less fortunate. That cottage in the desert was my hope of rest. That\r\noverwhelming horror and the sense of falling headlong may have had\r\nreference to the ruin of my son.[65]\r\n\r\n\"My second dream occurred a short time after. It seemed to me that my soul\r\nwas in the heaven of the moon, freed from the body and all alone, and when\r\nI was bewailing my fate I heard the voice of my father, saying: 'God has\r\nappointed me as a guardian to you. All this region is full of spirits, but\r\nthese you cannot see, and you must not speak either to me or to them. In\r\nthis part of heaven you will remain for seven thousand years, and for the\r\nsame time in certain other stars, until you come to the eighth. After\r\nthis you shall enter the kingdom of God.' I read this dream as follows. My\r\nfather's soul is my tutelary spirit. What could be dearer or more\r\ndelightful? The Moon signifies Grammar; Mercury Geometry and Arithmetic;\r\nVenus Music, the Art of Divination, and Poetry; the Sun the Moral, and\r\nJupiter the Natural, World; Mars Medicine; Saturn Agriculture, the\r\nknowledge of plants, and other minor arts. The eighth star stands for a\r\ngleaning of all mundane things, natural science, and various other\r\nstudies. After dealing with these I shall at last find my rest with the\r\nPrince of Heaven.\"[66]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[45] \"Nec ullum mihi erat relictum auxilium nisi latrunculorum\r\nLudus.\"--_Opera_, tom. i. p. 619.\r\n\r\n[46] From the formation of the League of Cambrai in 1508 to the\r\nestablishment of the Imperial supremacy in Italy in 1530, the whole\r\ncountry was desolated by the marching and counter-marching of the\r\ncontending forces.

The very title\r\nof his first book, _De Malo Recentiorum Medicorum Medendi Usu_, gives\r\nplain indication of the humour which possessed him, when he formulated his\r\nsubject and put it in writing. With his temper vexed by the persistent\r\nneglect and insult cast upon him by the Milanese doctors he would\r\nnaturally sit down _con amore_ to compile a list of the errors perpetrated\r\nby the ignorance and bungling of the men who affected to despise him, and\r\nif his object was to sting the hides of these pundits and arouse them to\r\nhostility yet more vehement, he succeeded marvellously well. He was\r\nenabled to launch his book rather by the strength of private friendship\r\nthan by the hope of any commercial success. Whilst at Pavia he had become\r\nintimate with Ottaviano Scoto, a fellow-student who came from Venice, and\r\nin after times he found Ottaviano's purse very useful to his needs. Since\r\ntheir college days Ottaviano's father had died and had left his son to\r\ncarry on his calling of printing. In 1536 Jerome bethought him of his\r\nfriend, and sent him the MS. of the treatise which was to let the world\r\nlearn with what little wisdom it was being doctored.[67]\r\n\r\nOttaviano seems to have expected no profit from this venture, which was\r\nmanifestly undertaken out of a genuine desire to help his friend, and he\r\ngenerously bore all the costs. Cardan deemed that, whatever the result of\r\nthe issue of the book might be, it would surely be to his benefit; he\r\nhazarded nothing, and the very publication of his work would give him at\r\nleast notoriety. It would moreover give him the intense pleasure of\r\nknowing that he was repaying in some measure the debt of vengeance owing\r\nto his professional foes. The outcome was exactly the opposite of what\r\nprinter and author had feared and hoped. The success of the book was rapid\r\nand great.\r\n\r\nOttaviano must soon have recouped all the cost of publication; and, while\r\nhe was counting his money, the doctors everywhere were reading Jerome's\r\nbrochure, and preparing a ruthless attack upon the daring censor, who,\r\nwith the impetuosity of youth, had laid himself open to attack by the\r\ncareless fashion in which he had compiled his work. He took fifteen days\r\nto write it, and he confesses in his preface to the revised edition that\r\nhe found therein over three hundred mistakes of one sort or another. The\r\nattack was naturally led by the Milanese doctors. They demanded to be told\r\nwhy this man, who was not good enough to practise by their sanction, was\r\ngood enough to lay down the laws for the residue of the medical world.\r\nThey heaped blunder upon blunder, and held him up to ridicule with all the\r\nwealth of invective characteristic of the learned controversy of the age.\r\nCardan was deeply humbled and annoyed. \"For my opponents, seizing the\r\nopportunity, took occasion to assail me through the reasoning of this\r\nbook, and cried out: 'Who can doubt that this man is mad? and that he\r\nwould teach a method and a practice of medicine differing from our own,\r\nsince he has so many hard things to say of our procedure.' And, as Galen\r\nsaid, I must in truth have appeared crazy in my efforts to contradict this\r\nmultitude raging against me. For, as it was absolutely certain that either\r\nI or they must be in the wrong, how could I hope to win? Who would take my\r\nword against the word of this band of doctors of approved standing,\r\nwealthy, for the most part full of years, well instructed, richly clad and\r\ncultivated in their bearing, well versed in speaking, supported by crowds\r\nof friends and kinsfolk, raised by popular approval to high position, and,\r\nwhat was more powerful than all else, skilled in every art of cunning and\r\ndeceit?\"\r\n\r\nCardan had indeed prepared a bitter pill for his foes, but the draught\r\nthey compelled him to swallow was hardly more palatable. The publication\r\nof the book naturally increased the difficulties of his position, and in\r\nthis respect tended to make his final triumph all the more noteworthy.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1536 that Cardan made his first essay as an author.[68] The next\r\nthree years of his life at Milan were remarkable as years of preparation\r\nand accumulation, rather than as years of achievement. He had struck his\r\nfirst blow as a reformer, and, as is often the lot of reformers, his sword\r\nhad broken in his hand, and there now rested upon him the sense of failure\r\nas a superadded torment. Yet now and again a gleam of consolation would\r\ndisperse the gloom, and advise him that the world was beginning to\r\nrecognize his existence, and in a way his merits. In this same year he\r\nreceived an offer from Pavia of the Professorship of Medicine, but this he\r\nrefused because he did not see any prospect of being paid for his\r\nservices. His friend Filippo Archinto was loyal still, and zealous in\r\nworking for his success, and as he had been recently promoted to high\r\noffice in the Imperial service, his good word might be very valuable\r\nindeed. He summoned his _protégé_ to join him at Piacenza, whither he had\r\ngone to meet Paul III., hoping to advance Cardan's interests with the\r\nPope; but though Marshal Brissac, the French king's representative,[69]\r\njoined Archinto in advocating his cause, nothing was done, and Jerome\r\nreturned disappointed to Milan.\r\n\r\nIn these months Cardan, disgusted by the failure of his late attack upon\r\nthe fortress of medical authority, turned his back, for a time, upon the\r\nstudy of medicine, and gave his attention almost entirely to mathematics,\r\nin which his reputation was high enough to attract pupils, and he always\r\nhad one or more of them in his house, the most noteworthy of whom was\r\nLudovico Ferrari of Bologna, who became afterwards a mathematician of\r\nrepute, and a teacher both at Milan and Bologna. While he was working at\r\nthe _De Malo Medendi_, he began a treatise upon Arithmetic, which he\r\ndedicated to his friend Prior Gaddi; but this work was not published till\r\n1539. In 1536 he first heard a report of a fresh and important discovery\r\nin algebra, made by one Scipio Ferreo of Bologna; the prologue to one of\r\nthe most dramatic incidents in his career, an incident which it will be\r\nnecessary to treat at some length later on.\r\n\r\nCardan was well aware that his excursions into astrology worked to his\r\nprejudice in public esteem, but in spite of this he could not refrain\r\ntherefrom. It was during the plentiful leisure of this period that he\r\ncast the horoscope of Jesus Christ, a feat which subsequently brought upon\r\nhim grave misfortune; a few patients came to him, moved no doubt by the\r\nspirit which still prompts people suffering from obscure diseases to\r\nconsult professors of healing who are either in revolt or unqualified in\r\npreference to going to the orthodox physician. In connection with this\r\nirregular practice of his he gives a curious story about a certain Count\r\nBorromeo. \"In 1536, while I was attending professionally in the house of\r\nthe Borromei, it chanced that just about dawn I had a dream in which I\r\nbeheld a serpent of enormous bulk, and I was seized with fear lest I\r\nshould meet my death therefrom. Shortly afterwards there came a messenger\r\nto summon me to see the son of Count Carlo Borromeo. I went to the boy,\r\nwho was about seven years old, and found him suffering from a slight\r\ndistemper, but on feeling his pulse I perceived that it failed at every\r\nfourth beat. His mother, the Countess Corona, asked me how he fared, and I\r\nanswered that there was not much fever about him; but that, because his\r\npulse failed at every fourth beat, I was in fear of something, but what it\r\nmight be I knew not rightly (but I had not then by me Galen's books on the\r\nindications of the pulse). Therefore, as the patient's state changed not,\r\nI determined on the third day to give him in small doses the drug called\r\n_Diarob: cum Turbit_: I had already written my prescription, and the\r\nmessenger was just starting with it to the pharmacy, when I remembered my\r\ndream. 'How do I know,' said I to myself, 'that this boy may not be about\r\nto die as prefigured by the portent above written? and in that case these\r\nother physicians who hate me so bitterly, will maintain he died through\r\ntaking this drug.' I called to the messenger, and said there was wanting\r\nin the prescription something which I desired to add. Then I privately\r\ntore up what I had written, and wrote out another made of pearls, of the\r\nhorn of unicorn,[70] and certain gems. The powder was given, and was\r\nfollowed by vomiting. The bystanders perceived that the boy was indeed\r\nsick, whereupon they called in three of the chief physicians, one of whom\r\nwas in a way friendly to me. They saw the description of the medicine, and\r\ndemanded what I would do now. Now although two of these men hated me, it\r\nwas not God's will that I should be farther attacked, and they not only\r\npraised the medicine, but ordered that it should be repeated. This was the\r\nsaving of me. When I went again in the evening I understood the case\r\ncompletely. The following morning I was summoned at daybreak, and found\r\nthe boy battling with death, and his father lying in tears. 'Behold him,'\r\nhe cried, 'the boy whom you declared to ail nothing' (as if indeed I could\r\nhave said such a thing); 'at least you will remain with him as long as he\r\nlives.' I promised that I would, and a little later the boy tried to rise,\r\ncrying out the while. They held him down, and cast all the blame upon me.\r\nWhat more is there to say? If there had been found any trace of that drug\r\n_Diarob: cum Turbit_: (which in sooth was not safe) it would have been all\r\nover with me, since Borromeo all his life would either have launched\r\nagainst me complaints grave enough to make all men shun me, or another\r\nCanidia, more fatal than African serpents, would have breathed poison upon\r\nme.\"[71]\r\n\r\nIn this same year, 1536, Lucia brought forth another child, a daughter,\r\nand it was about this time that Cardan first attracted the attention of\r\nAlfonso d'Avalos, the Governor of Milan, and an intimacy began which,\r\nalbeit fruitless at first, was destined to be of no slight service to\r\nJerome at the crisis of his fortunes.[72] In the following year, in 1537,\r\nhe made a beginning of two of his books, which were subsequently found\r\nworthy of being finished, and which may still be read with a certain\r\ninterest: the treatises _De Sapientia_ and _De Consolatione_. Of the\r\nlast-named, he remarks that it pleased no one, forasmuch as it appealed\r\nnot to those who were happy, and the wretched rejected it as entirely\r\ninadequate to give them solace in their evil case. In this year he made\r\nanother attempt to gain admission to the College at Milan, and was again\r\nrejected; the issue of the _De Malo Medendi_ was too recent, and it needed\r\nother and more potent influences than those exercised by mere merit, to\r\nappease the fury of his rivals and to procure him due status. But it would\r\nappear that, in 1536 or 1537, he negotiated with the College to obtain a\r\nquasi-recognition on conditions which he afterwards describes as\r\ndisgraceful to himself, and that this was granted to him.[73]\r\n\r\nWhatever his qualifications may have been, Cardan had no scruples in\r\ntreating the few patients who came to him. The first case he notes is that\r\nof Donato Lanza,[74] a druggist, who had suffered for many years with\r\nblood-spitting, which ailment he treated successfully. Success of this\r\nsort was naturally helpful, but far more important than Lanza's cure was\r\nthe introduction given by the grateful patient to the physician,\r\ncommending him to Francesco Sfondrato, a noble Milanese, a senator, and a\r\nmember of the Emperor's privy council. The eldest son of this gentleman\r\nhad suffered many months from convulsions, and Cardan worked a cure in his\r\ncase without difficulty. Shortly afterwards another child, only ten months\r\nold, was attacked by the same complaint, and was treated by Luca della\r\nCroce, the procurator of the College of Physicians, of which Sfondrato was\r\na patron. As the attack threatened to be a serious one, Della Croce\r\nrecommended that another physician, Ambrogio Cavenago, should be called\r\nin, but the father, remembering Cardan's cure of Lanza, wished for him as\r\nwell. The description of the meeting of the doctors round the sick child's\r\nbed, of their quotations from Hippocrates, of the uncertainty and\r\nhelplessness of the orthodox practitioners, and of the ready resource of\r\nthe free-lance--who happens also to be the teller of the story--is a\r\nrichly typical one.[75] \"We, the physicians and the father of the child,\r\nmet about seven in the morning, and Della Croce made a few general\r\nobservations on death, for he knew that Sfondrato was a sensible man, and\r\nhe himself was both honoured and learned. Cavenago kept silence at this\r\nstage, because the last word had been granted to him. Then I said, 'Do you\r\nnot see that the child is suffering from Opisthotonos?' whereupon the\r\nfirst physician stood as one dazed, as if I were trying to trouble his\r\nwits by my hard words. But Della Croce at once swept aside all uncertainty\r\nby saying, 'He means the backward contraction of the muscles.' I confirmed\r\nhis words, and added, 'I will show you what I mean.' Whereupon I raised\r\nthe boy's head, which the doctors and all the rest believed was hanging\r\ndown through weakness, and by its own weight, and bade them put it into\r\nits former position. Then Sfondrato turned to me, and said, 'As you have\r\ndiscovered what the disease is, tell us likewise what is the remedy\r\ntherefor.' Since no one else spoke, I turned towards him and--careful lest\r\nI should do hurt to the credit I had gained already,--I said, 'You know\r\nwhat Hippocrates lays down in a case like this--_febrem convulsioni_'--and\r\nI recited the aphorism. Then I ordered a fomentation, and an application\r\nof lint moistened with linseed-oil and oil of lilies, and gave directions\r\nthat the child should be gently handled until such time as the neck\r\nshould be restored; that the nurse should eat no meat, and that the child\r\nshould be nourished entirely by the milk of her breast, and not too much\r\nof that; that it should be kept in its cradle in a warm place, and rocked\r\ngently till it should fall asleep. After the other physicians had gone, I\r\nremember that the father of the child said to me, 'I give you this child\r\nfor your own,' and that I answered, 'You are doing him an ill turn, in\r\nthat you are supplanting his rich father by a poor one.' He answered, 'I\r\nam sure that you would care for him as if he were your own, fearing naught\r\nthat you might thereby give offence to these others' (meaning the\r\nphysicians). I said, 'It would please me well to work with them in\r\neverything, and to win their support.' I thus blended my words, so that he\r\nmight understand I neither despaired of the child's cure, nor was quite\r\nconfident thereanent. The cure came to a favourable end; for, after the\r\nfourteenth day of the fever--the weather being very warm--the child got\r\nwell in four days' time. Now as I review the circumstances, I am of\r\nopinion that it was not because I perceived what the disease really was,\r\nfor I might have done so much by reason of my special practice; nor\r\nbecause I healed the child, for that might have been attributed to chance;\r\nbut because the child got well in four days, whereas his brother lay ill\r\nfor six months, and was then left half dead, that his father was so much\r\namazed at my skill, and afterwards preferred me to all others. That he\r\nthought well of me is certain, because Della Croce himself, during the\r\ntime of his procuratorship, was full of spite and jealousy against me, and\r\ndeclared in the presence of Cavenago and of Sfondrato, that he would not,\r\nunder compulsion, say a word in favour of a man like me, one whom the\r\nCollege regarded with disfavour. Whereupon Sfondrato saw that the envy\r\nand jealousy of the other physicians was what kept me out of the College,\r\nand not the circumstances of my birth. He told the whole story to the\r\nSenate, and brought such influence to bear upon the Governor of the\r\nProvince and other men of worship, that at last the entrance to the\r\nCollege was opened to me.\"\r\n\r\nUp to the time of his admission to the College, Jerome had never felt that\r\nhe could depend entirely upon medicine for his livelihood. He now\r\ndetermined to publish his _Practica Arithmeticæ_, the book which he had\r\nprepared _pari passu_ with the ill-starred _De Malo Medendi_. It seems to\r\nhave been thoroughly revised and corrected, and was finally published in\r\n1539, in Milan; Cardan only received ten crowns for his work, but the\r\nsudden fame he achieved as a mathematician ought to have set him on firm\r\nground. His friends were still working to secure for him benefits yet more\r\nsubstantial. Alfonso d'Avalos, Francesco della Croce, the jurisconsult\r\nwhose name has already been mentioned, and the senator Sfondrato, were\r\ndoing their best to bring the physicians of the city into a more\r\nreasonable temper, and they finally succeeded in 1539; when, after having\r\nbeen denied admission for twelve years, Jerome Cardan became a member of\r\nthe College, and a sharer in all the privileges appertaining thereto.\r\n\r\nThough Cardan was now a fully qualified physician, he spent his time for\r\nthe next year or two rather with letters than with medicine. He worked\r\nhard at Greek, and as the result of his studies published somewhat\r\nprematurely a treatise, _De Immortalitate Animorum_, a collection of\r\nextracts from Greek writers which Julius Cæsar Scaliger with justice\r\ncalls a confused farrago of other men's learning.[76] He published also\r\nabout this period the treatise on Judicial Astrology, and the Essay _De\r\nConsolatione_, the only one of his books which has been found worthy of an\r\nEnglish translation.[77] In 1541 he became Rector of the College of\r\nPhysicians, but there is no record of any increase in the number of his\r\npatients by reason of this superadded dignity. A passage in the _De Vita\r\nPropria_, written with even more than his usual brutal candour, gives a\r\ngraphic view of his manner of life at this period. \"It was in the summer\r\nof the year 1543, a time when it was my custom to go every day to the\r\nhouse of Antonio Vicomercato, a gentleman of the city, and to play chess\r\nwith him from morning till night. As we were wont to play for one real, or\r\neven three or four, on each game, I, seeing that I was generally the\r\nwinner, would as a rule carry away with me a gold piece after each day's\r\nplay, sometimes more and sometimes less. In the case of Vicomercato it was\r\na pleasure and nothing else to spend money in this wise; but in my own\r\nthere was an element of conflict as well; and in this manner I lost my\r\nself-respect so completely that, for two years and more, I took no thought\r\nof practising my art, nor considered that I was wasting all my\r\nsubstance--save what I made by play--that my good name and my studies as\r\nwell would suffer shipwreck. But on a certain day towards the end of\r\nAugust, a new humour seized Vicomercato (either advisedly on account of\r\nthe constant loss he suffered, or perhaps because he thought his decision\r\nwould be for my benefit), a determination from which he was to be moved\r\nneither by arguments, nor adjurations, nor abuse. He forced me to swear\r\nthat I would never again visit his house for the sake of gaming, and I, on\r\nmy part, swore by all the gods as he wished. That day's play was our last,\r\nand thenceforth I gave myself up entirely to my studies.\"[78]\r\n\r\nBut these studies unfortunately were not of a nature to keep the wolf from\r\nthe door; and Jerome, albeit now a duly qualified physician, and known to\r\nfame as a writer on Mathematics far beyond the bounds of Italy, was\r\nwell-nigh as poor as ever. His mother had died several years before, in\r\n1537; but what little money she may have left would soon have been wasted\r\nin gratifying his extravagant taste for costly things,[79] and at the\r\ngaming-table. He found funds, however, for a journey to Florence, whither\r\nhe went to see d'Avalos, who was a generous, open-handed man, and always\r\nready to put his purse at the service of one whom he regarded as an honour\r\nto his city and country. There can be little doubt that he helped Cardan\r\nliberally at this juncture. The need for a loan was assuredly urgent\r\nenough. The recent resumption of hostilities between the French and the\r\nImperialists had led to intolerable taxation throughout the Milanese\r\nprovinces, and in consequence of dearth of funds in 1543, the Academy at\r\nPavia was forced to close its class-rooms, and leave its teachers unpaid.\r\nThe greater part of the professors migrated to Pisa; and the Faculty of\r\nMedicine, then vacant, was, _pro formâ_, transferred to Milan. This chair\r\nwas now offered to Cardan. He was in desperate straits--a third child had\r\nbeen born this year--and, though there must have been even less chance of\r\ngetting his salary paid than when he had refused it before, he accepted\r\nthe post, explaining that he took this step because there was now no need\r\nfor him to leave Milan, or danger that he would be rated as an itinerant\r\nteacher. It is not improbable that he may have been led to accept the\r\noffice on account of the additional dignity it would give to him as a\r\npractising physician. When, a little later on, the authorities began to\r\ntalk of returning to Pavia, he was in no mind to follow them, giving as a\r\nreason that, were he to leave Milan, he would lose his stipend for the\r\nPlat lectureship, and be put to great trouble in the transport of his\r\nhousehold, and perhaps suffer in reputation as well. The Senate was\r\nevidently anxious to retain his services. They bade him consider the\r\nmatter, promising to send on a certain date to learn his decision; and, as\r\nfate would have it, the question was conveniently decided for him by a\r\nportent.\r\n\r\n\"On the night before the day upon which my answer was to be sent to the\r\nSenate to say what course I was going to take, the whole of the house fell\r\ndown into a heap of ruins, and no single thing was left unwrecked, save\r\nthe bed in which I and my wife and my children were sleeping. Thus the\r\nstep, which I should never have taken of my own free will or without some\r\nsign, I was compelled to take by the course of events. This thing caused\r\ngreat wonder to all those who heard of it.\"[80]\r\n\r\nThis was in 1544. Jerome hesitated no longer, and went forthwith to Pavia\r\nas Professor of Medicine at a salary of two hundred and forty gold crowns\r\nper annum; but, for the first year at least, this salary was not paid;\r\nand the new professor lectured for a time to empty benches; but, as he was\r\nat this time engaged in the final stage of his great work on Algebra, the\r\nleisure granted to him by the neglect of the students must have been most\r\nacceptable. He published at this time a treatise called _Contradicentium\r\nMedicorum_, and in 1545 his _Algebra_ or _Liber Artis Magnæ_ was issued\r\nfrom the press by Petreius of Nuremberg. The issue of this book, by which\r\nalone the name of Cardan holds a place in contemporary learning, is\r\nconnected with an episode of his life important enough to demand special\r\nand detailed consideration in a separate place.\r\n\r\nHis practice in medicine was now a fairly lucrative one, but his\r\nextravagant tastes and the many vices with which he charges himself would\r\nhave made short work of the largest income he could possibly have earned,\r\nconsequently poverty was never far removed from the household. Hitherto\r\nhis reputation as a man of letters and a mathematician had exceeded his\r\nfame as a doctor; for, even after he had taken up his residence as\r\nProfessor of Medicine at Padua, many applications were made to him for his\r\nservices in other branches of learning. It was fortunate indeed that he\r\nhad let his reading take a somewhat eclectic course, for medicine at this\r\ntime seemed fated to play him false. At the end of 1544 no salary was\r\nforthcoming at Pavia, so he abandoned his class-room, and returned to\r\nMilan.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence there, in the summer of 1546, Cardinal Moroni, acting\r\non behalf of Pope Paul III., made an offer for his services as a teacher\r\nof mathematics, accompanied by terms which, as he himself admits, were not\r\nto be despised; but, as was his wont, he found some reason for demur, and\r\nultimately refused the offer. In his Harpocratic vein he argued, \"This\r\npope is an old man, a tottering wall, as it were. Why should I abandon a\r\ncertainty for an uncertainty?\"[81] The certainty he here alludes to must\r\nhave been the salary for the Plat lectureship; and, as this emolument was\r\na very small one, it would appear that he did not rate at a high figure\r\nany profits which might come to him in the future from his acceptance of\r\nthe Pope's offer; but, as he admits subsequently, he did not then fully\r\nrealize the benevolence of the Cardinal who approached him on the subject,\r\nor the magnificent patronage of the Farnesi.[82] It is quite possible that\r\nthis refusal of his may have been caused by a reluctance to quit Milan,\r\nthe city which had treated him in such cruel and inhospitable fashion,\r\njust at the time when he had become a man of mark. In the arrogance of\r\nsuccess it was doubtless a keen pleasure to let his fellow-townsmen see\r\nthat the man upon whom they had heaped insult after insult for so many\r\nyears was one who could afford to let Popes and Cardinals pray for his\r\nservices in vain. But whatever may have been his humour, he resolved to\r\nremain in Milan; and, as he had no other public duty to perform except the\r\ndelivery of the Plat lectures, he had abundant leisure to spend upon the\r\nmany and important works he had on hand at this season.\r\n\r\nCardan had now achieved European fame, and was apparently on the high\r\nroad to fortune, but on the very threshold of his triumph a great sorrow\r\nand misfortune befell him, the full effect of which he did not experience\r\nall at once. In the closing days of 1546 he lost his wife. There is very\r\nscant record of her life and character in any of her husband's\r\nwritings,[83] although he wrote at great length concerning her father; and\r\nthe few words that are to be found here and there favour the view that she\r\nwas a good wife and mother. That Jerome could have been an easy husband to\r\nlive with under any circumstances it is hard to believe. Lucia's life, had\r\nit been prolonged, might have been more free of trouble as the wife of a\r\nfamous and wealthy physician; but it was her ill fortune to be the\r\ncompanion of her husband only in those dreary, terrible days at Sacco and\r\nGallarate, and in the years of uncertainty which followed the final return\r\nto Milan. In the last-named period there was at least the Plat lectureship\r\nstanding between them and starvation; but children increased the while in\r\nthe nursery, and manuscripts in the desk of the physician without\r\npatients, and Lucia's short life was all consumed in this weary time of\r\nwaiting for fame and fortune which, albeit hovering near, seemed destined\r\nto mock and delude the seeker to the end. Cardan was before all else a man\r\nof books and of the study, and it is not rare to find that one of this\r\nsort makes a harsh unsympathetic husband. The qualities which he\r\nattributes to himself in his autobiography suggest that to live with a man\r\ncursed with such a nature would have been difficult even in prosperity,\r\nand intolerable in trouble and privation. But fretful and irascible as\r\nCardan shows himself to have been, there was a warm-hearted, affectionate\r\nside to his nature. He was capable of steadfast devotion to all those to\r\nwhom his love had ever been given. His reverence for the memory of his\r\ntyrannical and irascible father had been noted already, and a still more\r\nremarkable instance of his fidelity and love will have to be considered\r\nwhen the time comes to deal with the crowning tragedy of his life. If\r\nCardan had this tender side to his nature, if he could speak tolerant and\r\neven laudatory words concerning such a father as Fazio Cardano, and show\r\nevidences of a love strong as death in the fight he made for the life of\r\nhis ill-starred and unworthy son, it may be hoped--in spite of his almost\r\nunnatural silence concerning her--that he gave Lucia some of that\r\ntenderness and sympathy which her life of hard toil and heavy sacrifice so\r\nrichly deserved; and that even in the days when he sold her trinkets to\r\npay his gambling losses, she was not destined to weep the bitter tears of\r\na neglected wife. If her early married life had been full of care and\r\ntravail, if she died when a better day seemed to be dawning, she was at\r\nleast spared the supreme sorrow and disgrace which was destined to fall so\r\nsoon upon the household. Judging by what subsequently happened, it will\r\nperhaps be held that fate, in cutting her thread of life, was kinder to\r\nher than to her husband, when it gave him a longer term of years under the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[67] _De Libris Propriis_, Opera, tom. i. p. 102.\r\n\r\n[68] Besides the _De Malo Medendi Usu_, he published in 1536 a tract upon\r\njudicial astrology. This, in an enlarged form, was reprinted by Petreius\r\nat Nuremburg in 1542.\r\n\r\n[69] Cardan writes of Brissac: \"Erat enim Brissacus Prorex singularis in\r\nstudiosis amoris et humanitatis.\"--_De Vita Propria_, ch. iv. p. 14.\r\n\r\n[70] \"Mirumque in modum venenis cornu ejus adversari creditur.\"--_De\r\nSubtilitate_, p. 315. Sir Thomas Browne (_Vulgar Errors_, Bk. iii. 23)\r\ndeals at length with the pretended virtues of the horn, and in the\r\nBestiary of Philip de Thaun (_Popular Treatises on Science during the\r\nMiddle Ages_) is given an account of the many wonderful qualities of the\r\nbeast.\r\n\r\n[71] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xxxiii. p. 105. He also alludes to this case\r\nin _De Libris Propriis_ (Opera, tom. i. p. 65), affirming that the other\r\ndoctors concerned in the case raised a great prejudice against him on\r\naccount of his reputation as an astrologer. \"Ita tot modis et insanus\r\npaupertate, et Astrologus profitendo edendoque libros, et imperitus casu\r\nillustris pueri, et modum alium medendi observans ex titulo libri nuper\r\nedito, jam prope ab omnibus habebar. Atque hæc omnia in Urbe omnium\r\nnugacissima, et quæ calumniis maximè patet.\"\r\n\r\n[72] The founder of this family was Indico d'Avalos, a Spanish gentleman,\r\nwho was chosen by Alfonso of Naples as a husband for Antonella, the\r\ndaughter and heiress of the great Marchese Pescara of Aquino. This\r\nd'Avalos Marchese dal Guasto was the grandson of Indico. He commanded the\r\nadvanced guard at the battle of Pavia, and took part in almost every\r\nbattle between the French and Imperialists, and went with the Emperor to\r\nTunis in 1535. Though he was a brave soldier and a skilful tactician, he\r\nwas utterly defeated by d'Enghien at Cerisoles in 1544. He has been taxed\r\nwith treachery in the case of the attack upon the messengers Rincon and\r\nFregoso, who were carrying letters from Francis I. to the Sultan during a\r\ntruce, but he did little more than imitate the tactics used by the French\r\nagainst himself; moreover, neither of the murdered men was a French\r\nsubject, or had the status of an ambassador. D'Avalos was a liberal patron\r\nof letters and arts, and was very popular as Governor of Milan. He was a\r\nnoted gallant and a great dandy. Brantôme writes of him--\"qu'il était si\r\ndameret qu'il parfumait jusqu'aux selles de ses chevaux.\"--He died in\r\n1546.\r\n\r\n[73] \"Violentia quorundam Medicorum adactus sum anno MDXXXVI, seu XXXVII,\r\nturpi conditione pacisci cum Collegio, sed ut dixi, postmodum dissoluta\r\nest, anno MDXXXIX et restitutus sum integrè.\"--_De Vita Propria_, ch.\r\nxxxiii. p. 105.\r\n\r\n[74] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xl. p. 133.--He gives a long list of cases of\r\nhis successful treatment in _Opera_, tom. i. p. 82.\r\n\r\n[75] There is a full account of this episode in _De Libris Propriis_, p.\r\n128, and in _De Vita Propria_, ch. xl. p. 133.\r\n\r\n[76] Exotericarum exercitationum, p. 987.\r\n\r\n[77] _Cardanus Comforte, translated into Englishe_, 1573.

It is quite possible that Paul III. may have\r\ndesired to have Cardan about him on account of his reputation as an\r\nastrologer, the Pope being a firm believer in the influence of the\r\nstars.--_Vide_ Ranke, _History of the Popes_ i. 166.\r\n\r\n[82] \"Neque ego tum Moroni probitatem, nec Pharnesiorum splendorem\r\nintelligebam.\"--_De Vita Propria_, ch. iv. p. 15.\r\n\r\n[83] In writing of his own horoscope (_Geniturarum Exempla_, p. 461) he\r\nrecords that she miscarried thrice, brought forth three living children,\r\nand lived with him fifteen years. He dismisses his marriage as follows:\r\n\"Duxi uxorem inexpectato, a quo tempore multa adversa concomitata\r\nsunt.\"--_De Vita Propria_, ch. xli. p. 149. But in _De Rerum Subtilitate_,\r\np. 375, he records his grief at her death:--\"Itaque cum a luctu dolor et\r\nvigilia invadere soleant, ut mihi anno vertente in morte uxoris Luciæ\r\nBandarenæ quanquam institutis philosophiæ munitus essem, repugnante tamen\r\nnatura, memorque vinculi c[o=]jugalis, suspiriis ac lachrymis et inedia\r\nquinque dierum, a periculo me vindicavi.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAT this point it may not be inopportune to make a break in the record of\r\nCardan's life and work, and to treat in retrospect of that portion of his\r\ntime which he spent in the composition of his treatises on Arithmetic and\r\nAlgebra. Ever since 1535 he had been working intermittently at one or\r\nother of these, but it would have been impossible to deal coherently and\r\neffectively with the growth and completion of these two books--really the\r\nmost important of all he left behind him--while chronicling the goings and\r\ncomings of a life so adventurous as that of the author.\r\n\r\nThe prime object of Cardan's ambition was eminence as a physician. But,\r\nduring the long years of waiting, while the action of the Milanese doctors\r\nkept him outside the bounds of their College, and even after this had been\r\nopened to him without inducing ailing mortals to call for his services, he\r\nwould now and again fall into a transport of rage against his persecutors,\r\nand of contempt for the public which refused to recognize him as a master\r\nof his art, and cast aside his medical books for months at a time,\r\ndevoting himself diligently to Mathematics, the field of learning which,\r\nnext to Medicine, attracted him most powerfully. His father Fazio was a\r\ngeometrician of repute and a student of applied mathematics, and, though\r\nhis first desire was to make his son a jurisconsult, he gave Jerome in\r\nearly youth a fairly good grounding in arithmetic and geometry, deeming\r\nprobably that such training would not prove a bad discipline for an\r\nintellect destined to attack those formidable tomes within which lurked\r\nthe mysteries of the Canon and Civil Law. Mathematical learning has given\r\nto Cardan his surest title to immortality, and at the outset of his career\r\nhe found in mathematics rather than in medicine the first support in the\r\narduous battle he had to wage with fortune. His appointment to the Plat\r\nlectureship at Milan has already been noted. In the discharge of his new\r\nduties he was bound, according to the terms of the endowment of the Plat\r\nlecturer, to teach the sciences of geometry, arithmetic, and astronomy,\r\nand he began his course upon the lines laid down by the founder. Few\r\nlisteners came, however, and at this juncture Cardan took a step which\r\nserves to show how real was his devotion to the cause of true learning,\r\nand how lightly he thought of an additional burden upon his own back, if\r\nthis cause could be helped forward thereby. Keenly as he enjoyed his\r\nmathematical work, he laid a part of it aside when he perceived that the\r\nbenches before him were empty, and, by way of making his lectures more\r\nattractive, he occasionally substituted geography for geometry, and\r\narchitecture for arithmetic. The necessary research and the preparation of\r\nthese lectures led naturally to the accumulation of a large mass of notes,\r\nand as these increased under his hand Jerome began to consider whether it\r\nmight not be worth his while to use them in the composition of one or more\r\nvolumes. In 1535 he delivered as Plat lecturer his address, the _Encomium\r\nGeometriæ_, which he followed up shortly after by the publication of a\r\nwork, _Quindecim Libri Novæ Geometriæ_. But the most profitable labour of\r\nthese years was that which produced his first important book, _The\r\nPractice of Arithmetic and Simple Mensuration_, which was published in\r\n1539, a venture which brought to the author a reward of ten crowns.[84] It\r\nwas a well-planned and well-arranged manual, giving proof of the wide\r\nerudition and sense of proportion possessed by the author. Besides dealing\r\nwith Arithmetic as understood by the modern school-boy, it discusses\r\ncertain astronomical operations, multiplication by memory, the mysteries\r\nof the Roman and Ecclesiastical Calendars, and gives rules for the\r\nsolution of any problem arising from the terms of the same. It treats of\r\npartnership in agriculture, the Mezzadria system still prevalent in\r\nTuscany and in other parts of Italy, of the value of money, of the strange\r\nproperties of certain numbers, and gives the first simple rules of Algebra\r\nto serve as stepping-stones to the higher mathematics. It ends with\r\ninformation as to house-rent, letters of credit and exchange, tables of\r\ninterest, games of chance, mensuration, and weights and measures. In an\r\nappendix Cardan examines critically the work of Fra Luca Pacioli da Borgo,\r\nan earlier writer on the subject, and points out numerous errors in the\r\nsame. The book from beginning to end shows signs of careful study and\r\ncompilation, and the fame which it brought to its author was well\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nCardan appended to the Arithmetic a printed notice which may be regarded\r\nas an early essay in advertising. He was fully convinced that his works\r\nwere valuable and quite worth the sums of money he asked for them; the\r\nworld was blind, perhaps wilfully, to their merits, therefore he now\r\ndetermined that it should no longer be able to quote ignorance of the\r\nauthor as an excuse for not buying the book. This appendix was a\r\nnotification to the learned men of Europe that the writer of the _Practice\r\nof Arithmetic_ had in his press at home thirty-four other works in MS.\r\nwhich they might read with profit, and that of these only two had been\r\nprinted, to wit the _De Malo Medendi Usu_ and a tract on _Simples_. This\r\nadvertisement had something of the character of a legal document, for it\r\ninvoked the authority of the Emperor to protect the copyright of Cardan's\r\nbooks within the Duchy of Milan for ten years, and to prevent the\r\nintroduction of them from abroad.\r\n\r\nThe Arithmetic proved far superior to any other treatise extant, and\r\neverywhere won the approval of the learned. It was from Nuremberg that its\r\nappearance brought the most valuable fruits. Andreas Osiander,[85] a\r\nlearned humanist and a convert to Lutheranism, and Johannes Petreius, an\r\neminent printer, were evidently impressed by the terms of Cardan's\r\nadvertisement, for they wrote to him and offered in combination to edit\r\nand print any of the books awaiting publication in his study at Milan. The\r\nresult of this offer was the reprinting of _De Malo Medendi_, and\r\nsubsequently of the tract on Judicial Astrology, and of the treatise _De\r\nConsolatione_; the _Book of the Great Art_, the treatises _De Sapientia_\r\nand _De Immortalitate Animorum_ were published in the first instance by\r\nthese same patrons from the Nuremberg press.\r\n\r\nBut Cardan, while he was hard at work on his Arithmetic, had not forgotten\r\na certain report which had caused no slight stir in the world of\r\nMathematics some three years before the issue of his book on Arithmetic,\r\nan episode which may be most fittingly told in his own words. \"At this\r\ntime[86] it happened that there came to Milan a certain Brescian named\r\nGiovanni Colla, a man of tall stature, and very thin, pale, swarthy, and\r\nhollow-eyed. He was of gentle manners, slow in gait, sparing of his words,\r\nfull of talent, and skilled in mathematics. His business was to bring word\r\nto me that there had been recently discovered two new rules in Algebra for\r\nthe solution of problems dealing with cubes and numbers. I asked him who\r\nhad found them out, whereupon he told me the name of the discoverer was\r\nScipio Ferreo of Bologna. 'And who else knows these rules?' I said. He\r\nanswered, 'Niccolo Tartaglia and Antonio Maria Fiore.' And indeed some\r\ntime later Tartaglia, when he came to Milan, explained them to me, though\r\nunwillingly; and afterwards I myself, when working with Ludovico\r\nFerrari,[87] made a thorough study of the rules aforesaid. We devised\r\ncertain others, heretofore unnoticed, after we had made trial of these new\r\nrules, and out of this material I put together my _Book of the Great\r\nArt_.\"[88]\r\n\r\nBefore dealing with the events which led to the composition of the famous\r\nwork above-named, it may be permitted to take a rapid survey of the\r\ncondition of Algebra at the time when Cardan sat down to write. Up to the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century the knowledge of Algebra in Italy,\r\noriginally derived from Greek and Arabic sources, had made very little\r\nprogress, and the science had been developed no farther than to provide\r\nfor the solution of equations of the first or second degree.[89] In the\r\npreface to the _Liber Artis Magnæ_ Cardan writes:--\"This art takes its\r\norigin from a certain Mahomet, the son of Moses, an Arabian, a fact to\r\nwhich Leonard the Pisan bears ample testimony. He left behind him four\r\nrules, with his demonstrations of the same, which I duly ascribe to him in\r\ntheir proper place. After a long interval of time, some student, whose\r\nidentity is uncertain, deduced from the original four rules three others,\r\nwhich Luca Paciolus put with the original ones into his book. Then three\r\nmore were discovered from the original rules, also by some one unknown,\r\nbut these attracted very little notice though they were far more useful\r\nthan the others, seeing that they taught how to arrive at the value of the\r\n_cubus_ and the _numerus_ and of the _cubus quadratus_.[90] But in recent\r\ntimes Scipio Ferreo of Bologna discovered the rule of the _cubus_ and the\r\n_res_ equal to the _numerus_ (_x^3 + px=q_), truly a beautiful and\r\nadmirable discovery. For this Algebraic art outdoes all other subtlety of\r\nman, and outshines the clearest exposition mortal wit can achieve: a\r\nheavenly gift indeed, and a test of the powers of a man's mind. So\r\nexcellent is it in itself that whosoever shall get possession thereof,\r\nwill be assured that no problem exists too difficult for him to\r\ndisentangle. As a rival of Ferreo, Niccolo Tartaglia of Brescia, my\r\nfriend, at that time when he engaged in a contest with Antonio Maria\r\nFiore, the pupil of Ferreo, made out this same rule to help secure the\r\nvictory, and this rule he imparted to me after I had diligently besought\r\nhim thereanent. I, indeed, had been deceived by the words of Luca\r\nPaciolus, who denied that there could be any general rule besides these\r\nwhich he had published, so I was not moved to seek that which I despaired\r\nof finding; but, having made myself master of Tartaglia's method of\r\ndemonstration, I understood how many other results might be attained; and,\r\nhaving taken fresh courage, I worked these out, partly by myself and\r\npartly by the aid of Ludovico Ferrari, a former pupil of mine. Now all the\r\ndiscoveries made by the men aforesaid are here marked with their names.\r\nThose unsigned were found out by me; and the demonstrations are all mine,\r\nexcept three discovered by Mahomet and two by Ludovico.\"[91]\r\n\r\nThis is Cardan's account of the scheme and origin of his book, and the\r\nsucceeding pages will be mainly an amplification thereof. The earliest\r\nwork on Algebra used in Italy was a translation of the MS. treatise of\r\nMahommed ben Musa of Corasan, and next in order is a MS. written by a\r\ncertain Leonardo da Pisa in 1202. Leonardo was a trader, who had learned\r\nthe art during his voyages to Barbary, and his treatise and that of\r\nMahommed were the sole literature on the subject up to the year 1494, when\r\nFra Luca Pacioli da Borgo[92] brought out his volume treating of\r\nArithmetic and Algebra as well. This was the first printed work on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAfter the invention of printing the interest in Algebra grew rapidly. From\r\nthe time of Leonardo to that of Fra Luca it had remained stationary. The\r\nimportant fact that the resolution of all the cases of a problem may be\r\ncomprehended in a simple formula, which may be obtained from the solution\r\nof one of its cases merely by a change of the signs, was not known, but in\r\n1505 the Scipio Ferreo alluded to by Cardan, a Bolognese professor,\r\ndiscovered the rule for the solution of one case of a compound cubic\r\nequation. This was the discovery that Giovanni Colla announced when he\r\nwent to Milan in 1536.\r\n\r\nCardan was then working hard at his Arithmetic--which dealt also with\r\nelementary Algebra--and he was naturally anxious to collect in its pages\r\nevery item of fresh knowledge in the sphere of mathematics which might\r\nhave been discovered since the publication of the last treatise. The fact\r\nthat Algebra as a science had made such scant progress for so many years,\r\ngave to this new process, about which Giovanni Colla was talking, an\r\nextraordinary interest in the sight of all mathematical students;\r\nwherefore when Cardan heard the report that Antonio Maria Fiore, Ferreo's\r\npupil, had been entrusted by his master with the secret of this new\r\nprocess, and was about to hold a public disputation at Venice with Niccolo\r\nTartaglia, a mathematician of considerable repute, he fancied that\r\npossibly there would be game about well worth the hunting.\r\n\r\nFiore had already challenged divers opponents of less weight in the other\r\ntowns of Italy, but now that he ventured to attack the well-known Brescian\r\nstudent, mathematicians began to anticipate an encounter of more than\r\ncommon interest. According to the custom of the time, a wager was laid on\r\nthe result of the contest, and it was settled as a preliminary that each\r\none of the competitors should ask of the other thirty questions. For\r\nseveral weeks before the time fixed for the contest Tartaglia studied\r\nhard; and such good use did he make of his time that, when the day of the\r\nencounter came, he not only fathomed the formula upon which Fiore's hopes\r\nwere based, but, over and beyond this, elaborated two other cases of his\r\nown which neither Fiore nor his master Ferreo had ever dreamt of.\r\n\r\nThe case which Ferreo had solved by some unknown process was the equation\r\n_x^3 + px = q_, and the new forms of cubic equation which Tartaglia\r\nelaborated were as follows: _x^3 + px^2 = q_: and _x^3 - px^2 = q_. Before\r\nthe date of the meeting, Tartaglia was assured that the victory would be\r\nhis, and Fiore was probably just as confident. Fiore put his questions,\r\nall of which hinged upon the rule of Ferreo which Tartaglia had already\r\nmastered, and these questions his opponent answered without difficulty;\r\nbut when the turn of the other side came, Tartaglia completely puzzled the\r\nunfortunate Fiore, who managed indeed to solve one of Tartaglia's\r\nquestions, but not till after all his own had been answered. By this\r\ntriumph the fame of Tartaglia spread far and wide, and Jerome Cardan, in\r\nconsequence of the rumours of the Brescian's extraordinary skill, became\r\nmore anxious than ever to become a sharer in the wonderful secret by means\r\nof which he had won his victory.\r\n\r\nCardan was still engaged in working up his lecture notes on Arithmetic\r\ninto the Treatise when this contest took place; but it was not till four\r\nyears later, in 1539, that he took any steps towards the prosecution of\r\nhis design. If he knew anything of Tartaglia's character, and it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that he did, he would naturally hesitate to make any\r\npersonal appeal to him, and trust to chance to give him an opportunity of\r\ngaining possession of the knowledge aforesaid, rather than seek it at the\r\nfountain-head. Tartaglia was of very humble birth, and according to report\r\nalmost entirely self-educated. Through a physical injury which he met with\r\nin childhood his speech was affected; and, according to the common Italian\r\nusage, a nickname[93] which pointed to this infirmity was given to him.\r\nThe blow on the head, dealt to him by some French soldier at the sack of\r\nBrescia in 1512, may have made him a stutterer, but it assuredly did not\r\nmuddle his wits; nevertheless, as the result of this knock, or for some\r\nother cause, he grew up into a churlish, uncouth, and ill-mannered man,\r\nand, if the report given of him by Papadopoli[94] at the end of his\r\nhistory be worthy of credit, one not to be entirely trusted as an\r\nautobiographer in the account he himself gives of his early days in the\r\npreface to one of his works. Papadopoli's notice of him states that he was\r\nin no sense the self-taught scholar he represented himself to be, but that\r\nhe was indebted for some portion at least of his training to the\r\nbeneficence of a gentleman named Balbisono,[95] who took him to Padua to\r\nstudy. From the passage quoted below he seems to have failed to win the\r\ngoodwill of the Brescians, and to have found Venice a city more to his\r\ntaste. It is probable that the contest with Fiore took place after his\r\nfinal withdrawal from his birthplace to Venice.\r\n\r\nIn 1537 Tartaglia published a treatise on Artillery, but he gave no sign\r\nof making public to the world his discoveries in Algebra. Cardan waited\r\non, but the morose Brescian would not speak, and at last he determined to\r\nmake a request through a certain Messer Juan Antonio, a bookseller, that,\r\nin the interests of learning, he might be made a sharer of Tartaglia's\r\nsecret. Tartaglia has given a version of this part of the transaction;\r\nand, according to what is there set down, Cardan's request, even when\r\nrecorded in Tartaglia's own words, does not appear an unreasonable one,\r\nfor up to this time Tartaglia had never announced that he had any\r\nintention of publishing his discoveries as part of a separate work on\r\nMathematics. There was indeed a good reason why he should refrain from\r\ndoing this in the fact that he could only speak and write Italian, and\r\nthat in the Brescian dialect, being entirely ignorant of Latin, the only\r\ntongue which the writer of a mathematical work could use with any hope of\r\nsuccess. Tartaglia's record of his conversation with Messer Juan Antonio,\r\nthe emissary employed by Cardan, and of all the subsequent details of the\r\ncontroversy, is preserved in his principal work, _Quesiti et Inventioni\r\nDiverse de Nicolo Tartalea Brisciano_,[96] a record which furnishes\r\nabundant and striking instance of his jealous and suspicious temper. Much\r\nof it is given in the form of dialogue, the terms of which are perhaps a\r\nlittle too precise to carry conviction of its entire sincerity and\r\nspontaneity. It was probably written just after the final cause of quarrel\r\nin 1545, and its main object seems to be to set the author right in the\r\nsight of the world, and to exhibit Cardan as a meddlesome fellow not to be\r\ntrusted, and one ignorant of the very elements of the art he professed to\r\nteach.[97]\r\n\r\nThe inquiry begins with a courteously worded request from Messer Juan\r\nAntonio (speaking on behalf of Messer Hieronimo Cardano), that Messer\r\nNiccolo would make known to his principal the rule by means of which he\r\nhad made such short work of Antonio Fiore's thirty questions. It had been\r\ntold to Messer Hieronimo that Fiore's thirty questions had led up to a\r\ncase of the _cosa_ and the _cubus_ equal to the _numerus_, and that\r\nMesser Niccolo had discovered a general rule for such case. Messer\r\nHieronimo now especially desired to be taught this rule. If the inventor\r\nshould be willing to let this rule be published, it should be published as\r\nhis own discovery; but, if he were not disposed to let the same be made\r\nknown to the world, it should be kept a profound secret. To this request\r\nTartaglia replied that, if at any time he might publish his rule, he would\r\ngive it to the world in a work of his own under his own name, whereupon\r\nJuan Antonio moderated his demand, and begged to be furnished merely with\r\na copy of the thirty questions preferred by Fiore, and Tartaglia's\r\nsolutions of the same; but Messer Niccolo was too wary a bird to be taken\r\nwith such a lure as this. To grant so much, he replied, would be to tell\r\neverything, inasmuch as Cardan could easily find out the rule, if he\r\nshould be furnished with a single question and its solution. Next Juan\r\nAntonio handed to Tartaglia eight algebraical questions which had been\r\nconfided to him by Cardan, and asked for answers to them; but Tartaglia,\r\nhaving glanced at them, declared that they were not framed by Cardan at\r\nall, but by Giovanni Colla. Colla, he declared, had sent him one of these\r\nquestions for solution some two years ago. Another, he (Tartaglia) had\r\ngiven to Colla, together with a solution thereof. Juan Antonio replied by\r\nway of contradiction--somewhat lamely--that the questions had been handed\r\nover to him by Cardan and no one else, wishing to maintain, apparently,\r\nthat no one else could possibly have been concerned in them, whereupon\r\nTartaglia replied that, supposing the questions had been given by Cardan\r\nto Juan Antonio his messenger, Cardan must have got the questions from\r\nColla, and have sent them on to him (Tartaglia) for solution because he\r\ncould not arrive at the meaning of them himself. He waved aside Juan\r\nAntonio's perfectly irrelevant and fatuous protests--that Cardan would not\r\nin any case have sent these questions if they had been framed by another\r\nperson, or if he had been unable to solve them. Tartaglia, on the other\r\nhand, declared that Cardan certainly did not comprehend them. If he did\r\nnot know the rule by which Fiore's questions had been answered (that of\r\nthe _cosa_ and the _cubus_ equal to the _numerus_), how could he solve\r\nthese questions which he now sent, seeing that certain of them involved\r\noperations much more complicated than that of the rule above written? If\r\nhe understood the questions which he now sent for solution, he could not\r\nwant to be taught this rule. Then Juan Antonio moderated his demand still\r\nfarther, and said he would be satisfied with a copy of the questions which\r\nFiore had put to Tartaglia, adding that the favour would be much greater\r\nif Tartaglia's own questions were also given. He probably felt that it\r\nwould be mere waste of breath to beg again for Tartaglia's answers. The\r\nend of the matter was that Tartaglia handed over to the messenger the\r\nquestions which Fiore had propounded in the Venetian contest, and\r\nauthorized Juan Antonio to get a copy of his own from the notary who had\r\ndrawn up the terms of the disputation with Fiore. The date of this\r\ncommunication is January 2, 1539, and on February 12 Cardan writes a long\r\nletter to Tartaglia, complaining in somewhat testy spirit of the reception\r\ngiven to his request. He is aggrieved that Tartaglia should have sent him\r\nnothing but the questions put to him by Fiore, thirty in number indeed,\r\nbut only one in substance, and that he should have dared to hint that\r\nthose which he (Cardan) had sent for solution were not his own, but the\r\nproperty of Giovanni Colla. Cardan had found Colla to be a conceited fool,\r\nand had dragged the conceit out of him--a process which he was now about\r\nto repeat for the benefit of Messer Niccolo Tartaglia. The letter goes on\r\nto contradict all Tartaglia's assertions by arguments which do not seem\r\nentirely convincing, and the case is not made better by the abusive\r\npassages interpolated here and there, and by the demonstration of certain\r\nerrors in Tartaglia's book on Artillery. In short a more injudicious\r\nletter could not have been written by any man hoping to get a favour done\r\nto him by the person addressed.\r\n\r\nIn the special matter of the problems which he sent to Tartaglia by the\r\nbookseller Juan Antonio, Cardan made a beginning of that tricky and\r\ncrooked course which he followed too persistently all through this\r\nparticular business. In his letter he maintains with a show of indignation\r\nthat he had long known these questions, had known them in fact before\r\nColla knew how to count ten, implying by these words that he knew how to\r\nsolve them, while in reality all he knew about them was the fact that they\r\nexisted. Tartaglia in his answer is not to be moved from his belief, and\r\ntells Cardan flatly that he is still convinced Giovanni Colla took the\r\nquestions to Milan, where he found no one able to solve them, not even\r\nMesser Hieronimo Cardano, and that the mathematician last-named sent them\r\non by the bookseller for solution, as has been already related.\r\n\r\nThis letter of Tartaglia's bears the date of February 13, 1539, and after\r\nreading it and digesting its contents, Cardan seems to have come to the\r\nconclusion that he was not working in the right way to get possession of\r\nthis secret which he felt he must needs master, if he wanted his\r\nforthcoming book to mark a new epoch in this History of Mathematics, and\r\nthat a change of tactics was necessary. Alfonso d'Avalos, Cardan's friend\r\nand patron, was at this time the Governor of Milan. D'Avalos was a man of\r\nscience, as well as a soldier, and Cardan had already sent to him a copy\r\nof Tartaglia's treatise on Artillery, deeming that a work of this kind\r\nwould not fail to interest him. In his first letter to Tartaglia he\r\nmentions this fact, while picking holes in the writer's theories\r\nconcerning transmitted force and views on gravitation. This mention of the\r\nname of D'Avalos, the master of many legions and of many cannons as well,\r\nto a man who had written a Treatise on the management of Artillery, and\r\ndevised certain engines and instruments for the management of the same,\r\nwas indeed a clever cast, and the fly was tempting enough to attract even\r\nso shy a fish as Niccolo Tartaglia. In his reply to Jerome's scolding\r\nletter of February 12, 1539, Tartaglia concludes with a description of the\r\ninstruments which he was perfecting: a square to regulate the discharge of\r\ncannon, and to level and determine every elevation; and another instrument\r\nfor the investigation of distances upon a plane surface. He ends with a\r\nrequest that Cardan will accept four copies of the engines aforesaid, two\r\nfor himself and two for the Marchese d'Avalos.\r\n\r\nThe tone of this letter shows that Cardan had at least begun to tame the\r\nbear, who now seemed disposed to dance _ad libitum_ to the pleasant music\r\nof words suggesting introductions to the governor, and possible patronage\r\nof these engines for the working of artillery. Cardan's reply of March 19,\r\n1539, is friendly--too friendly indeed--and the wonder is that Tartaglia's\r\nsuspicions were not aroused by its almost sugary politeness. It begins\r\nwith an attempt to soften down the asperities of their former\r\ncorrespondence, some abuse of Giovanni Colla, and an apology for the rough\r\nwords of his last epistle. Cardan then shows how their misunderstanding\r\narose chiefly from a blunder made by Juan Antonio in delivering the\r\nmessage, and invites Tartaglia to come and visit him in his own house in\r\nMilan, so that they might deliberate together on mathematical questions;\r\nbut the true significance of the letter appears in the closing lines. \"I\r\ntold the Marchese of the instruments which you had sent him, and he showed\r\nhimself greatly pleased with all you had done. And he commanded me to\r\nwrite to you forthwith in pressing terms, and to tell you that, on the\r\nreceipt of my letter, you should come to Milan without fail, for he\r\ndesires to speak with you. And I, too, exhort you to come at once without\r\nfurther deliberation, seeing that this said Marchese is wonted to reward\r\nall men of worth in such noble and magnanimous and liberal fashion that\r\nnone of them ever goes away dissatisfied.\"\r\n\r\nThe receipt of this letter seems to have disquieted Tartaglia somewhat;\r\nfor he has added a note to it, in which he says that Cardan has placed him\r\nin a position of embarrassment. He had evidently wished for an\r\nintroduction to D'Avalos, but now it was offered to him it seemed a burden\r\nrather than a benefit. He disliked the notion of going to Milan; yet, if\r\nhe did not go, the Marchese d'Avalos might take offence. But in the end he\r\ndecided to undertake the journey; and, as D'Avalos happened then to be\r\nabsent from Milan on a visit to his country villa at Vigevano, he stayed\r\nfor three days in Cardan's house. As a recorder of conversations Tartaglia\r\nseems to have had something of Boswell's gift. He gives an abstract of an\r\neventful dialogue with his host on March 25, 1539, which Cardan begins by\r\na gentle reproach anent his guest's reticence in the matter of the rule of\r\nthe _cosa_ and the _cubus_ equal to the _numerus_. Tartaglia's reply to\r\nthis complaint seems reasonable enough (it must be borne in mind that he\r\nis his own reporter), and certainly helps to absolve him from the charge\r\nsometimes made against him that he was nothing more than a selfish\r\ncurmudgeon who had resolved to let his knowledge die with him, rather than\r\nshare it with other mathematicians of whom he was jealous. He told Cardan\r\nplainly that he kept his rules a secret because, for the present, it\r\nsuited his purpose to do so. At this time he had not the leisure to\r\nelaborate farther the several rules in question, being engaged over a\r\ntranslation of Euclid into Italian; but, when this work should be\r\ncompleted, he proposed to publish a treatise on Algebra in which he would\r\ndisclose to the world all the rules he already knew, as well as many\r\nothers which he hoped to discover in the course of his present work. He\r\nconcludes: \"This is the cause of my seeming discourtesy towards your\r\nexcellency. I have been all the ruder, perhaps, because you write to me\r\nthat you are preparing a book similar to mine, and that you propose to\r\npublish my inventions, and to give me credit for the same. This I confess\r\nis not to my taste, forasmuch as I wish to set forth my discoveries in my\r\nown works, and not in those of others.\" In his reply to this, Cardan\r\npoints out that he had promised, if Tartaglia so desired, that he would\r\nnot publish the rules at all; but here Messer Niccolo's patience and good\r\nmanners gave way, and he told Messer Hieronimo bluntly that he did not\r\nbelieve him. Then said Cardan: \"I swear to you by the Sacred Evangel, and\r\nby myself as a gentleman, that I will not only abstain from publishing\r\nyour discoveries--if you will make them known to me--but that I will\r\npromise and pledge my faith of a true Christian to set them down for my\r\nown use in cypher, so that after my death no one may be able to understand\r\nthem. If you will believe this promise, believe it; if you will not, let\r\nus have done with the matter.\" \"If I were not disposed to believe such\r\noaths as these you now swear,\" said Tartaglia, \"I might as well be set\r\ndown as a man without any faith at all. I have determined to go forthwith\r\nto Vigevano to visit the Signor Marchese, as I have now been here for\r\nthree days and am weary of the delay, but I promise when I return that I\r\nwill show you all the rules.\" Cardan replied: \"As you are bent on going to\r\nVigevano, I will give you a letter of introduction to the Marchese, so\r\nthat he may know who you are; but I would that, before you start, you show\r\nme the rule as you have promised.\" \"I am willing to do this,\" said\r\nTartaglia, \"but I must tell you that, in order to be able to recall at any\r\ntime my system of working, I have expressed it in rhyme; because, without\r\nthis precaution, I must often have forgotten it. I care naught that my\r\nrhymes are clumsy, it has been enough for me that they have served to\r\nremind me of my rules. These I will write down with my own hand, so that\r\nyou may be assured that my discovery is given to you correctly.\" Then\r\nfollow Tartaglia's verses:\r\n\r\n    \"Quando chel cubo con le cose apresso\r\n    Se agualia à qualche numero discreto\r\n    Trouan dui altri differenti in esso\r\n    Dapoi terrai questo per consueto\r\n    Ch'el lor' produtto sempre sia eguale\r\n    Al terzo cubo delle cose neto\r\n    El residuo poi suo generale\r\n    Delli lor lati cubi ben sottratti\r\n    Varra la tua cosa principale.\r\n    In el secondo de cotesti atti\r\n    Quando chel cubo restasse lui solo\r\n    Tu osseruarai quest' altri contratti\r\n    Del numer farai due tal part 'a uolo\r\n    Che luna in l'altra si produca schietto\r\n    El terzo cubo delle cose in stolo\r\n    Delle qual poi, per commun precetto\r\n    Torrai li lati cubi insieme gionti\r\n    Et cotal summa sara il tuo concetto\r\n    Et terzo poi de questi nostri conti\r\n    Se solve col recordo se ben guardi\r\n    Che per natura son quasi congionti\r\n    Questi trouai, et non con passi tardi\r\n    Nel mille cinquecent' e quatro è trenta\r\n    Con fondamenti ben sald' è gagliardi\r\n    Nella citta del mar' intorno centa.\"\r\n\r\nHaving handed over to his host these rhymes, with the precious rules\r\nenshrined therein, Tartaglia told him that, with so clear an exposition,\r\nhe could not fail to understand them, ending with a warning hint to Cardan\r\nthat, if he should publish the rules, either in the work he had in hand,\r\nor in any future one, either under the name of Tartaglia or of Cardan, he,\r\nthe author, would put into print certain things which Messer Hieronimo\r\nwould not find very pleasant reading.\r\n\r\nAfter all Tartaglia was destined to quit Milan without paying his respects\r\nto D'Avalos. There is not a word in his notes which gives the reason of\r\nthis eccentric action on his part. He simply says that he is no longer\r\ninclined to go to Vigevano, but has made up his mind to return to Venice\r\nforthwith; and Cardan, probably, was not displeased at this exhibition of\r\npetulant impatience on the part of his guest, but was rather somewhat\r\nrelieved to see Messer Niccolo ride away, now that he had extracted from\r\nhim the coveted information. From the beginning to the end of this affair\r\nCardan has been credited with an amount of subtle cunning which he\r\nassuredly did not manifest at other times when his wits were pitted for\r\ncontest with those of other men. It has been advanced to his disparagement\r\nthat he walked in deceitful ways from the very beginning; that he dangled\r\nbefore Tartaglia's eyes the prospect of gain and preferment simply for the\r\npurpose of enticing him to Milan, where he deemed he might use more\r\nefficaciously his arguments for the accomplishment of the purpose which\r\nwas really in his mind; that he had no intention of advancing Tartaglia's\r\nfortunes when he suggested the introduction to D'Avalos, but that the\r\nGovernor of Milan was brought into the business merely that he might be\r\nused as a potent ally in the attack upon Tartaglia's obstinate silence.\r\nWhether this may have been his line of action or not, the issue shows that\r\nhe was fully able to fight his battle alone, and that his powers of\r\npersuasion and hard swearing were adequate when occasion arose for their\r\nexercise. It is quite possible that Tartaglia, when he began to reflect\r\nover what he had done by writing out and handing over to Cardan his\r\nmnemonic rhymes, fell into an access of suspicious anger--at Cardan for\r\nhis wheedling persistency, and at himself for yielding thereto--and packed\r\nhimself off in a rage with the determination to have done with Messer\r\nHieronimo and all his works. Certainly his carriage towards Cardan in the\r\nweeks ensuing, as exhibited in his correspondence, does not picture him in\r\nan amiable temper. On April 9 Jerome wrote to him in a very friendly\r\nstrain, expressing regret that his guest should have left Milan without\r\nseeing D'Avalos, and fear lest he might have prejudiced his fortunes by\r\ntaking such a step. He then goes on to describe to Tartaglia the progress\r\nhe is making in his work with the Practice of Arithmetic, and to ask him\r\nfor help in solving one of the cases in Algebra, the rule for which was\r\nindeed contained in Tartaglia's verses, but expressed somewhat obscurely,\r\nfor which reason Cardan had missed its meaning.[98] In his reply,\r\nTartaglia ignores Jerome's courtesies altogether, and tells him that what\r\nhe especially desires at the present moment is a sight of that volume on\r\nthe Practice of Arithmetic, \"for,\" says he, \"if I do not see it soon, I\r\nshall begin to suspect that this work of yours will probably make manifest\r\nsome breach of faith; in other words, that it will contain as\r\ninterpolations certain of the rules I taught you.\" Niccolo then goes on to\r\nexplain the difficulty which had puzzled Cardan, using terms which showed\r\nplainly that he had as poor an opinion of his correspondent's wit as of\r\nhis veracity.\r\n\r\nCardan was an irascible man, and it is a high tribute to his powers of\r\nrestraint that he managed to keep his temper under the uncouth insults of\r\nsuch a letter as the foregoing. The more clearly Tartaglia's jealous,\r\nsuspicious nature displays itself, the greater seems the wonder that a man\r\nof such a disposition should ever have disclosed such a secret. He did not\r\nbelieve Cardan when he promised that he would not publish the rules in\r\nquestion without his (the discoverer's) consent--why then did he believe\r\nhim when he swore by the Gospel? The age was one in which the binding\r\nforce of an oath was not regarded as an obligation of any particular\r\nsanctity if circumstances should arise which made the violation of the\r\noath more convenient than its observance. However, the time was not yet\r\ncome for Jerome to begin to quibble with his conscience. On May 12, 1539,\r\nhe wrote another letter to Tartaglia, also in a very friendly tone,\r\nreproaching him gently for his suspicions, and sending a copy of the\r\n_Practice of Arithmetic_ to show him that they were groundless. He\r\nprotested that Tartaglia might search from beginning to end without\r\nfinding any trace of his jealously-guarded rules, inasmuch as, beyond\r\ncorrecting a few errors, the writer had only carried Algebra to the point\r\nwhere Fra Luca had left it. Tartaglia searched, and though he could not\r\nput his finger on any spot which showed that Messer Hieronimo had broken\r\nhis oath, he found what must have been to him as a precious jewel, to wit\r\na mistake in reckoning, which he reported to Cardan in these words:\r\n\r\n\"In this process your excellency has made such a gross mistake that I am\r\namazed thereat, forasmuch as any man with half an eye must have seen\r\nit--indeed, if you had not gone on to repeat it in divers examples, I\r\nshould have set it down to a mistake of the printer.\" After pointing out\r\nto Cardan the blunders aforesaid, he concludes: \"The whole of this work of\r\nyours is ridiculous and inaccurate, a performance which makes me tremble\r\nfor your good name.\"[99]\r\n\r\nEvery succeeding page of Tartaglia's notes shows more and more clearly\r\nthat he was smarting under a sense of his own folly in having divulged his\r\nsecret. Night and day he brooded over his excess of confidence, and as\r\ntime went by he let his suspicions of Cardan grow into savage resentment.\r\nHis ears were open to every rumour which might pass from one class-room to\r\nanother. On July 10 a letter came to him from one Maphio of Bergamo, a\r\nformer pupil, telling how Cardan was about to publish certain new\r\nmathematical rules in a book on Algebra, and hinting that in all\r\nprobability these rules would prove to be Tartaglia's, whereupon he at\r\nonce jumped to the conclusion that Maphio's gossip was the truth, and that\r\nthis book would make public the secret which Cardan had sworn to keep. He\r\nleft many of Cardan's letters unanswered; but at last he seems to have\r\nfound too strong the temptation to say something disagreeable; so, in\r\nanswer to a letter from Cardan containing a request for help in solving an\r\nequation which had baffled his skill, Tartaglia wrote telling Cardan that\r\nhe had bungled in his application of the rule, and that he himself was now\r\nvery sorry he had ever confided the rule aforesaid to such a man. He ends\r\nwith further abuse of Cardan's _Practice of Arithmetic_, which he declares\r\nto be merely a confused farrago of other men's knowledge,[100] and with a\r\nremark which he probably intended to be a crowning insult. \"I well\r\nremember when I was at your house in Milan, that you told me you had never\r\ntried to discover the rule of the _cosa_ and the _cubus_ equal to the\r\n_numerus_ which was found out by me, because Fra Luca had declared it to\r\nbe impossible;[101] as if to say that, if you had set yourself to the task\r\nyou could have accomplished it, a thing which sets me off laughing when I\r\ncall to mind the fact that it is now two months since I informed you of\r\nthe blunders you made in the extraction of the cube root, which process is\r\none of the first to be taught to students who are beginning Algebra.\r\nWherefore, if after the lapse of all this time you have not been able to\r\nfind a remedy to set right this your mistake (which would have been an\r\neasy matter enough), just consider whether in any case your powers could\r\nhave been equal to the discovery of the rule aforesaid.\"[102]\r\n\r\nIn this quarrel Messer Giovanni Colla had appeared as the herald of the\r\nstorm, when he carried to Milan in 1536 tidings of the discovery of the\r\nnew rule which had put Cardan on the alert, and now, as the crisis\r\napproached, he again came upon the scene, figuring as unconscious and\r\nindirect cause of the final catastrophe. On January 5, 1540, Cardan wrote\r\nto Tartaglia, telling him that Colla had once more appeared in Milan, and\r\nwas boasting that he had found out certain new rules in Algebra. He went\r\non to suggest to his correspondent that they should unite their forces in\r\nan attempt to fathom this asserted discovery of Colla's, but to this\r\nletter Tartaglia vouchsafed no reply. In his diary it stands with a\r\nsuperadded note, in which he remarks that he thinks as badly of Cardan as\r\nof Colla, and that, as far as he is concerned, they may both of them go\r\nwhithersoever they will.[103]\r\n\r\nColla propounded divers questions to the Algebraists of Milan, and\r\namongst them was one involving the equation _x^4 + 6x^2 + 36 = 60x_, one\r\nwhich he probably found in some Arabian treatise. Cardan tried all his\r\ningenuity over this combination without success, but his brilliant pupil,\r\nLudovico Ferrari, worked to better purpose, and succeeded at last in\r\nsolving it by adding to each side of the equation, arranged in a certain\r\nfashion, some quadratic and simple quantities of which the square root\r\ncould be extracted.[104] Cardan seems to have been baffled by the fact\r\nthat the equation aforesaid could not be solved by the recently-discovered\r\nrules, because it produced a bi-quadratic. This difficulty Ferrari\r\novercame, and, pursuing the subject, he discovered a general rule for the\r\nsolution of all bi-quadratics by means of a cubic equation. Cardan's\r\nsubsequent demonstration of this process is one of the masterpieces of the\r\n_Book of the Great Art_. It is an example of the use of assuming a new\r\nindeterminate quantity to introduce into an equation, thus anticipating by\r\na considerable space of time Descartes, who subsequently made use of a\r\nlike assumption in a like case.\r\n\r\nHow far this discovery of Ferrari's covered the rules given by Tartaglia\r\nto Cardan, and how far it relieved Cardan of the obligation of secresy, is\r\na problem fitted for the consideration of the mathematician and the\r\ncasuist severally.[105] An apologist of Cardan might affirm that he cannot\r\nbe held to have acted in bad faith in publishing the result of Ferrari's\r\ndiscovery. If this discovery included and even went beyond Tartaglia's, so\r\nmuch the worse for Tartaglia. The lesser discovery (Tartaglia's) Cardan\r\nnever divulged before Ferrari unravelled Giovanni Colla's puzzle; but it\r\nwas inevitable that it must be made known to the world as a part of the\r\ngreater discovery (Ferrari's) which Cardan was in no way bound to keep a\r\nsecret. The case might be said to run on all fours with that where a man\r\nconfides a secret to a friend under a promise of silence, which promise\r\nthe friend keeps religiously, until one day he finds that the secret, and\r\neven more than the secret, is common talk of the market-place. Is the\r\nobligation of silence, with which he was bound originally, still to lie\r\nupon the friend, even when he may have sworn to observe it by the Holy\r\nEvangel and the honour of a gentleman; and is the fact that great renown\r\nand profit would come to him by publishing the secret to be held as an\r\nadditional reason for keeping silence, or as a justification for speech?\r\nIn forming a judgment after a lapse of three and a half centuries as to\r\nCardan's action, while having regard both to the sanctity of an oath at\r\nthe time in question, and to the altered state of the case between him and\r\nTartaglia consequent on Ludovico Ferrari's discovery, an hypothesis not\r\noverstrained in the direction of charity may be advanced to the effect\r\nthat Cardan might well have deemed he was justified in revealing to the\r\nworld the rules which Tartaglia had taught him, considering that these\r\nisolated rules had been developed by his own study and Ferrari's into a\r\nprinciple by which it would be possible to work a complete revolution in\r\nthe science of Algebra.\r\n\r\nIn any case, six years were allowed to elapse before Cardan, by publishing\r\nTartaglia's rules in the _Book of the Great Art_, did the deed which, in\r\nthe eyes of many, branded him as a liar and dishonest, and drove\r\nTartaglia almost wild with rage. That his offence did not meet with\r\nuniversal reprobation is shown by negative testimony in the _Judicium de\r\nCardano_, by Gabriel Naudé.[106] In the course of his essay Naudé lets it\r\nbe seen how thoroughly he dislikes the character of the man about whom he\r\nwrites. No evil disposition attributed to Cardan by himself or by his\r\nenemies is left unnoticed, and a lengthy catalogue of his offences is set\r\ndown, but this list does not contain the particular sin of broken faith in\r\nthe matter of Tartaglia's rules. On the contrary, after abusing and\r\nridiculing a large portion of his work, Naudé breaks out into almost\r\nrhapsodical eulogy about Cardan's contributions to Mathematical science.\r\n\"Quis negabit librum de Proportionibus dignum esse, qui cum pulcherrimis\r\nantiquorum inventis conferatur? Quis in Arithmetica non stupet, eum tot\r\ndifficultates superasse, quibus explicandis Villafrancus, Lucas de Burgo,\r\nStifelius, Tartalea, vix ac ne vix quidem pares esse potuissent?\" It seems\r\nhard to believe, after reading elsewhere the bitter assaults of\r\nNaudé,[107] that he would have neglected so tempting an opportunity of\r\ndarkening the shadows, if he himself had felt the slightest offence, or if\r\npublic opinion in the learned world was in any perceptible degree\r\nscandalized by the disclosure made by the publication of the _Book of the\r\nGreat Art_.\r\n\r\nThis book was published at Nuremberg in 1545, and in its preface and\r\ndedication Cardan fully acknowledges his obligations to Tartaglia and\r\nFerrari, with respect to the rules lately discussed, and gives a catalogue\r\nof the former students of the Art, and attributes to each his particular\r\ncontribution to the mass of knowledge which he here presents to the world.\r\nLeonardo da Pisa,[108] Fra Luca da Borgo, and Scipio Ferreo all receive\r\ndue credit for their work, and then Cardan goes on to speak of \"my friend\r\nNiccolo Tartaglia of Brescia, who, in his contest with Antonio Maria\r\nFiore, the pupil of Ferreo, elaborated this rule to assure him of victory,\r\na rule which he made known to me in answer to my many prayers.\" He goes on\r\nto acknowledge other obligations to Tartaglia:[109] how the Brescian had\r\nfirst taught him that algebraical discovery could be most effectively\r\nadvanced by geometrical demonstration, and how he himself had followed\r\nthis counsel, and had been careful to give the demonstration aforesaid for\r\nevery rule he laid down.\r\n\r\nThe _Book of the Great Art_ was not published till six years after Cardan\r\nhad become the sharer of Tartaglia's secret, which had thus had ample time\r\nto germinate and bear fruit in the fertile brain upon which it was cast.\r\nIt is almost certain that the treatise as a whole--leaving out of account\r\nthe special question of the solution of cubic equations--must have gained\r\nenormously in completeness and lucidity from the fresh knowledge revealed\r\nto the writer thereof by Tartaglia's reluctant disclosure, and, over and\r\nbeyond this, it must be borne in mind that Cardan had been working for\r\nseveral years at Giovanni Colla's questions in conjunction with Ferrari,\r\nan algebraist as famous as Tartaglia or himself. The opening chapters of\r\nthe book show that Cardan was well acquainted with the chief properties of\r\nthe roots of equations of all sorts. He lays it down that all square\r\nnumbers have two different kinds of root, one positive and one\r\nnegative,[110] _vera_ and _ficta_: thus the root of 9 is either 3. or -3.\r\nHe shows that when a case has all its roots, or when none are impossible,\r\nthe number of its positive roots is the same as the number of changes in\r\nthe signs of the terms when they are all brought to one side. In the case\r\nof _x^3 + 3bx = 2c_, he demonstrates his first resolution of a cubic\r\nequation, and gives his own version of his dealings with Tartaglia. His\r\nchief obligation to the Brescian was the information how to solve the\r\nthree cases which follow, _i.e. x^3 + bx = c. x^3 = bx + c._ and\r\n_x^3 + c = bx_, and this he freely acknowledges, and furthermore admits\r\nthe great service of the system of geometrical demonstration which\r\nTartaglia had first suggested to him, and which he always employed\r\nhereafter. He claims originality for all processes in the book not\r\nascribed to others, asserting that all the demonstrations of existing\r\nrules were his own except three which had been left by Mahommed ben Musa,\r\nand two invented by Ludovico Ferrari.\r\n\r\nWith this vantage ground beneath his feet Cardan raised the study of\r\nAlgebra to a point it had never reached before, and climbed himself to a\r\nheight of fame to which Medicine had not yet brought him. His name as a\r\nmathematician was known throughout Europe, and the success of his book\r\nwas remarkable. In the _De Libris Propriis_ there is a passage which\r\nindicates that he himself was not unconscious of the renown he had won, or\r\ndisposed to underrate the value of his contribution to mathematical\r\nscience. \"And even if I were to claim this art (Algebra) as my own\r\ninvention, I should perhaps be speaking only the truth, though Nicomachus,\r\nPtolemæus, Paciolus, Boetius, have written much thereon. For men like\r\nthese never came near to discover one-hundredth part of the things\r\ndiscovered by me. But with regard to this matter--as with divers others--I\r\nleave judgment to be given by those who shall come after me. Nevertheless\r\nI am constrained to call this work of mine a perfect one, seeing that it\r\nwell-nigh transcends the bounds of human perception.\"[111]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[84] It was published at Milan by Bernardo Caluschio, with a\r\ndedication--dated 1537--to Francesco Gaddi, a descendant of the famous\r\nfamily of Florence. This man was Prior of the Augustinian Canons in Milan,\r\nand a great personage, but ill fortune seems to have overtaken him in his\r\nlatter days. Cardan writes (_Opera_, tom. i. p. 107):--\"qui cum mihi\r\namicus esset dum floreret, Rexque cognomine ob potentiam appellaretur,\r\nconjectus in carcerem, miseré vitam ibi, ne dicam crudeliter, finivit: nam\r\nper quindecim dies in profundissima gorgyne fuit, ut vivus sepeliretur.\"\r\n\r\n[85] There is a reference to Osiander in _De Subtilitate_, p. 523. Cardan\r\ngives a full account of his relations with Osiander and Petreius in\r\n_Opera_, tom. i. p. 67.\r\n\r\n[86] November 1536.\r\n\r\n[87] Ferrari was one of Cardan's most distinguished pupils. \"Ludovicus\r\nFerrarius Bononiensis qui Mathematicas et Mediolani et in patria sua\r\nprofessus est, et singularis in illis eruditionis.\"--_De Vita Propria_,\r\nch. xxxv. p. 111. There is a short memoir of Ferrari in _Opera_, tom. ix.\r\n\r\n[88] _Opera_, tom. i. p. 66.\r\n\r\n[89] Fra Luca's book, _Summa de Arithmetica Geometria Proportioni é\r\nProportionalita_, extends as far as the solution of quadratic equations,\r\nof which only the positive roots were used. At this time letters were\r\nrarely used to express known quantities.\r\n\r\n[90] The early writers on Algebra used _numerus_ for the absolute or known\r\nterm, _res_ or _cosa_ for the first power, _quadratum_ for the second, and\r\n_cubus_ for the third. The signs + and - first appear in the work of\r\nStifelius, a German writer, who published a book of Arithmetic in 1544.\r\nRobert Recorde in his _Whetstone of Wit_ seems first to have used the sign\r\nof equality =. Vieta in France first applied letters as general symbols of\r\nquantity, though the earlier algebraists used them occasionally, chiefly\r\nas abbreviations. Aristotle also used them in the _Physics.--Libri. Hist.\r\ndes Sciences Mathématiques_. i. 104.\r\n\r\n[91] _Opera_, tom. iv. p. 222.\r\n\r\n[92] In the conclusion of the Treatise on Arithmetic, Cardan points out\r\ncertain errors in the work of Fra Luca. Fra Luca was a pupil of Piero\r\ndella Francesca, who was highly skilled in Geometry, and who, according to\r\nVasari, first applied perspective to the drawing of the human form.\r\n\r\n[93] Tartaglia, _i.e._ the stutterer.\r\n\r\n[94] Papadopoli, _Hist.

Ibi persenex decessit.\"--Papadopoli, _Hist.\r\nGymn. Pata.,_ ii. p. 210.\r\n\r\n[96] This work is the chief authority for the facts which follow. The\r\nedition referred to is that of Venice, 1546. There is also a full account\r\nof the same in Cossali, _Origine dell' Algebra_ (Parma, 1799). vol. ii. p.\r\n96.\r\n\r\n[97] _Quesiti et Inventioni_, p. 115.\r\n\r\n[98] Cardan writes: \"Vi supplico per l'amor che mi portati, et per\r\nl'amicitia ch'è tra noi, che spero durara fin che viveremo, che mi mandati\r\nsciolta questa questione. 1 cubo piu 3. cose egual à 10.\" Cardan had\r\nmistaken (1/3 _b_)^3 for 1/3 _b_^3, or the cube of 1/3 of the co-efficient\r\nfor 1/3 of the cube of the co-efficient.--_Quesiti et Inventioni_ p. 124.\r\n\r\n[99] _Quesiti et Inventioni_, p. 125.\r\n\r\n[100] \"Non ha datta fora tal opera come cose composto da sua testa ma come\r\ncose ellette raccolte e copiate de diverse libri a penna.\"--_Quesiti et\r\nInventioni_, p. 127.\r\n\r\n[101] Cardan repeats the remark in the first chapter of the _Liber Artis\r\nMagnæ_ (_Opera_, tom. iv. p. 222). \"Deceptus enim ego verbis Lucæ\r\nPaccioli, qui ultra sua capitula, generale ullum aliud esse posse negat\r\n(quanquam tot jam antea rebus a me inventis, sub manibus esset) desperabam\r\ntamen invenire, quod quærere non audebam.\" Perhaps he wrote them down as\r\nan apology or a defence against the storm which he anticipated as soon as\r\nTartaglia should have seen the new Algebra.\r\n\r\n[102] Subsequently Tartaglia wrote very bitterly against Cardan, as the\r\nlatter mentions in _De Libris Propriis_. \"Nam etsi Nicolaus Tartalea\r\nlibris materna lingua editis nos calumniatur, impudentiæ tamen ac\r\nstultitiæ suæ non aliud testimonium quæras, quam ipsos illius libros, in\r\nquibus nominatim splendidiorem unumquemque e civibus suis proscindit: adeò\r\nut nemo dubitet insanisse hominem aliquo infortunio.\"--_Opera_, tom. i. p.\r\n80.\r\n\r\n[103] _Quesiti et Inventioni_, p. 129.\r\n\r\n[104] Montucla, _Histoire de Math._ i. 596, gives a full account of\r\nFerrari's process.\r\n\r\n[105] In the _De Vita Propria_, Cardan dismisses the matter briefly: \"Ex\r\nhoc ad artem magnam, quam collegi, dum Jo. Colla certaret nobiscum, et\r\nTartalea, à quo primum acceperam capitulum, qui maluit æmulum habere, et\r\nsuperiorem, quam amicum et beneficio devinctum, cum alterius fuisset\r\ninventum.\"--ch. xlv. p. 175.\r\n\r\n[106] Prefixed to the _De Vita Propria_.\r\n\r\n[107] In a question of broken faith, Cardan laid himself open especially\r\nto attack by reason of his constant self-glorification in the matter of\r\nveracity.\r\n\r\n[108] Leonardo knew that quadratic equations might have two positive\r\nroots, and Cardan pursued this farther by the discovery that they might\r\nalso have negative roots.\r\n\r\n[109] \"Caput xxviii. De capitulo generali cubi et rerum æqualium numero,\r\nMagistri Nicolai Tartagliæ, Brixiensis--Hoc capitulum habui à prefato viro\r\nante considerationem demonstrationum secundi libri super Euclidem, et\r\næquatio hæc cadit in [Symbol: Rx]. cu v binomii ex genere binomii secundi\r\net qunti [m~]. [Symbol: Rx]. cuba universali recisi ejusdem\r\nbinomii.\"--_Opera_, tom. iv. p. 341.\r\n\r\n[110] Montucla, who as a historian of Mathematics has a strong bias\r\nagainst Cardan, gives him credit for the discovery of the _fictæ radices_,\r\nbut on the other hand he attributes to Vieta Cardan's discovery of the\r\nmethod of changing a complete cubic equation into one wanting the second\r\nterm.--Ed. 1729, p. 595.\r\n\r\n[111] _Opera_, tom. i. p. 66.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nIT has been noted that Cardan quitted Pavia at the end of 1544 on account\r\nof the bankruptcy of the University, and that in 1546 a generous offer was\r\nmade to him on condition of his entering the service of Pope Paul III.; an\r\noffer which after some hesitation he determined to refuse. In the autumn\r\nof this same year he resumed his teaching at Pavia, a fact which sanctions\r\nthe assumption that this luckless seat of learning must have been once\r\nmore in funds. In the year following, in 1547, there came to him another\r\noffer of employment accompanied by terms still more munificent than the\r\nPope's, conveyed through Vesalius[112] and the ambassador of the King of\r\nDenmark. \"The emolument was to be a salary of three hundred gold crowns\r\nper annum of the Hungarian currency, and in addition to these six hundred\r\nmore to be paid out of the tax on skins of price. This last-named money\r\ndiffered in value by about an eighth from the royal coinage, and would be\r\nsomewhat slower in coming in. Also the security for its payment was not so\r\nsolid, and would in a measure be subject to risk. To this was farther\r\nadded maintenance for myself and five servants and three horses. This\r\noffer I did not accept because the country was very cold and damp, and the\r\npeople well-nigh barbarians; moreover the rites and doctrines of religion\r\nwere quite foreign to those of the Roman Church.\"[113]\r\n\r\nCardan was now forty-six years of age, a mathematician of European fame,\r\nand the holder of an honourable post at an ancient university, which he\r\nmight have exchanged for other employment quite as dignified and far more\r\nlucrative. In dealing with a character as bizarre as his, it would be as a\r\nrule unprofitable to search deeply for motives of action, but in this\r\ninstance it is no difficult matter to detect upon the surface several\r\ncauses which may have swayed him in this decision to remain at Pavia.\r\nHowever firmly he may have set himself to win fame as a physician, he was\r\nin no way disposed to put aside those mathematical studies in which he had\r\nalready made so distinguished a name, nor to abandon his astrology and\r\nchiromancy and discursive reading of all kinds. At Pavia he would find\r\nleisure for all these, and would in addition be able to make good any\r\narrears of medical and magical knowledge into which he might have fallen\r\nduring the years so largely devoted to the production of the _Book of the\r\nGreat Art_. Moreover, the time in question was one of the prime epochs in\r\nthe history of the healing art. A new light had just arisen in Vesalius,\r\nwho had recently published his book, _Corporis Humani Fabrica_, and was\r\nlecturing in divers universities on the new method of Anatomy, the actual\r\ndissection of the human body. He went to Pavia in the course of his\r\ntravels and left traces of his visit in the form of a revived and\r\nre-organized school of Anatomy. This fact alone would have been a\r\npowerful attraction to Cardan, ever greedy as he was of new knowledge, but\r\nthere was another reason which probably swayed him more strongly still, to\r\nwit, the care of his eldest son's education and training. Gian Battista\r\nCardano was now in his fourteenth year, and, according to the usages of\r\nthe time, old enough to make a beginning of his training in Medicine, the\r\nprofession he was destined to follow. It is not recorded whether or not he\r\nchose this calling for himself; but, taking into account the deep and\r\ntender affection Jerome always manifested towards his eldest son, it is\r\nnot likely that undue compulsion was used in the matter. The youth,\r\naccording to his father's description, strongly favoured in person his\r\ngrandfather Fazio.[114] He had come into the world at a time when his\r\nparents' fortunes were at their lowest ebb, during those terrible months\r\nspent at Gallarate,[115] and in his adolescence he bore divers physical\r\nevidences of the ill nurture--it would be unjust to call it neglect--which\r\nhe had received. At one time he was indeed put in charge of a good nurse,\r\nbut he had to be withdrawn from her care almost immediately through her\r\nhusband's jealousy, and he was next sent to a slattern, who fed him with\r\nold milk, and not enough of that; or more often with chewed bread. His\r\nbody was swollen and unhealthy, he suffered greatly from an attack of\r\nfever, which ultimately left him deaf in one ear. He gave early evidence\r\nof a fine taste in music, an inheritance from his father, and was,\r\naccording to Cardan's showing, upright and honest in his carriage, gifted\r\nwith talents which must, under happier circumstances, have placed him in\r\nthe first rank of men of learning, and in every respect a youth of the\r\nfairest promise. The father records that he himself, though well furnished\r\nby experience in the art of medicine, was now and again worsted by his son\r\nin disputation, and alludes in words of pathetic regret to divers\r\nproblems, too deep for his own powers of solution, which Gian Battista\r\nwould assuredly have mastered in the course of time. He does not forget to\r\nnotice certain of the young man's failings; for he remarks that he was\r\ntemperate of speech, except when he was angered, and then he would pour\r\nforth such a torrent of words that he scarce seemed in his right mind.\r\nCardan professes to have discerned a cause for these failings, and the\r\ncalamities flowing therefrom, in the fact that Gian Battista had the third\r\nand fourth toes of his right foot united by a membrane; he declares that,\r\nif he had known of this in time, he would have counteracted the evil by\r\ndividing the toes.[116] Gian Battista eventually gained the _baccalaureat_\r\nin his twenty-second year, and two years after became a member of the\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nThe life which Cardan planned to lead at Pavia was unquestionably a full\r\none. He had several young men under his care as pupils besides his son,\r\namongst them being a kinsman of his, Gasparo Cardano, a youth of sterling\r\nvirtue and a useful coadjutor in times to come. He was at this time\r\nengaged on his most important works in Medicine and Physical Science. He\r\nworked hard at his profession, practising occasionally and reading\r\nvoraciously all books bearing on his studies. He wrote and published\r\nseveral small works during the four years--from 1547 to 1551--of his\r\nProfessorship at Pavia; the most noteworthy of which were the Book of\r\nPrecepts for the guidance of his children, and some Treatises on the\r\nPreservation of Health. He also wrote a book on Physiognomy, or as he\r\ncalled it Metoposcopy, an abstract of which appears as a chapter in _De\r\nUtilitate_ (lib. iii. c. 10), but the major part of his time must have\r\nbeen consumed in collecting and reducing to form the huge mass of facts\r\nout of which his two great works, _De Subtilitate_ and _De Varietate\r\nRerum_, were built up.\r\n\r\nA mere abstract of the contents of these wonderful books would fill many\r\npages, and prove as uninteresting and unsuggestive as abstracts must\r\nalways be; and a commentary upon the same, honestly executed, would make a\r\nheavy draft on the working life-time of an industrious student. In\r\nreference to each book the author has left a statement of the reasons\r\nwhich impelled him to undertake his task, the most cogent of which were\r\ncertain dreams.[117] Soon after he had begun to write the _De Astrorum\r\nJudiciis_ he dreamt one night that his soul, freed from his body, was\r\nranging the vault of heaven near to the moon, and the soul of his father\r\nwas there likewise. But he could not see this spirit, which spake to him\r\nsaying, \"Behold, I am given to you as a comrade.\" The spirit of the father\r\nthen went on to tell the son how, after various stages of probation, he\r\nwould attain the highest heaven, and in the terms of this discourse Cardan\r\nprofessed to discern the scheme of his more important works.\r\n\r\nThe _De Subtilitate_ represents Cardan's original conception of a\r\ntreatise dealing with the Cosmos, but during the course of its preparation\r\na vast mass of subsidiary and contingent knowledge accumulated in his\r\nnote-books, and rendered necessary the publication of a supplementary\r\nwork, the _De Varietate_,[118] which, by the time it was finished, had\r\ngrown to a bulk exceeding that of the original treatise. The seminal ideas\r\nwhich germinated and produced such a vast harvest of printed words, were\r\nsubstantially the same which had possessed the brains of Paracelsus and\r\nAgrippa. Cardan postulates in the beginning a certain sympathy between the\r\ncelestial bodies and our own, not merely general, but distributive, the\r\nsun being in harmony with the heart, and the moon with the animal humours.\r\nHe considers that all organized bodies are animated, so that what we call\r\nthe Spirit of Nature is present everywhere. Beyond this everything is\r\nruled by the properties of numbers.[119] Heat and moisture are the only\r\nreal qualities in Nature, the first being the formal, and the second the\r\nmaterial, cause of all things; these conceptions he gleaned probably from\r\nsome criticisms of Aristotle on the archaic doctrines of Heraclitus and\r\nThales as to the origin of the universe.\r\n\r\nIt is no marvel that a writer, gifted with so bizarre and imaginative a\r\ntemper, so restless and greedy of knowledge, sitting down to work with\r\nsuch a projection before him, should have produced the richest, and at\r\nthe same time the most chaotic, collection of the facts of Natural\r\nPhilosophy that had yet issued from the press. The erudition and the\r\nindustry displayed in the gathering together of these vast masses of\r\ninformation, and in their verification by experiment, are indeed amazing;\r\nand, in turning over his pages, it is impossible to stifle regret that\r\nCardan's confused method and incoherent system should have rendered his\r\nwork comparatively useless for the spread of true knowledge, and qualified\r\nit only for a place among the _labores ineptiarum_.\r\n\r\nCardan begins with a definition of Subtilty. \"By subtilty I mean a certain\r\nfaculty of the mind by which certain phenomena, discernible by the senses\r\nand comprehensible by the intellect, may be understood, albeit with\r\ndifficulty.\" Subtilty, as he understood it, possesses a threefold\r\ncharacter: substance, accident, and manifestation. With regard to the\r\nsenses he admits but four to the first rank: touch, sight, smell, and\r\nhearing; the claims of taste, he affirms, are open to contention. He then\r\npasses on to discuss the properties of matter: fire, moisture, cold,\r\ndryness, and vacuum. The last-named furnishes him with a text for a\r\ndiscourse on a wonderful lamp which he invented by thinking out the\r\nprinciple of the vacuum. This digression on the very threshold of the work\r\nis a sample of what the reader may expect to encounter all through the\r\ntwenty-one books of the _De Subtilitate_ and the seventeen of the _De\r\nVarietate_. Regardless of the claims of continuity, he jumps from\r\nprinciple to practice without the slightest warning. Intermingled with\r\ndissertations on abstract causes and the hidden forces of Nature are to be\r\nfound descriptions of taps and pumps and syphons, and of the water-screw\r\nof Archimedes, the re-invention of which caused poor Galeazzo Rosso,\r\nFazio's blacksmith friend, to go mad for joy. There are diagrams of\r\nfurnaces, of machinery for raising sunken ships, and of the common\r\nsteelyard. Cardan finds no problem of the universe too recondite to essay,\r\nand in like manner he sets down information as to the most trivial details\r\nof every-day economy: how to kill mice, why dogs bay the moon, how to make\r\nvinegar, why a donkey is stupid, why flint and steel produce fire, how to\r\nmake the hands white, how to tell good mushrooms from bad, and how to mark\r\nhousehold linen. He treats of the elements, Earth, Air, and Water,\r\nexcluding Fire, because it produces nothing material; of the heavens and\r\nlight: metals, stones, plants, and animals. Marvellous stories abound, and\r\nthe most whimsical theories are advanced to account for the working of\r\nNature. He tells how he once saw a man from Porto Maurizio, pallid, with\r\nlittle hair on his face, and fat in person, who had in his breasts milk\r\nenough to suckle a child. He was a soldier, and this strange property\r\ncaused him no slight inconvenience. Sages, he affirms, on account of their\r\nstudious lives, are little prone to sexual passion. With them the vital\r\npower is carried from the heart to a region remote from the genitals,\r\n_i.e._ to the brain, and for this reason such men as a rule beget children\r\nweak and unlike themselves. Diet has a valid effect on character, as the\r\nGermans, who subsist chiefly on the milk of wild cows, are fierce and bold\r\nand brutal. Again, the Corsicans, who eat young dogs, wild as well as\r\ndomestic, are notably fierce, cruel, treacherous, fearless, nimble, and\r\nstrong, following thus the nature of dogs. He argues at length to show\r\nthat man is neither an animal nor a plant, but something between the two.\r\nA man is no more an animal than an animal is a plant. The animal has the\r\n_anima sensitiva_ which the plant lacks, and man transcends the animal\r\nthrough the gift of the _anima intellectiva_, which, as Aristotle\r\ntestifies, differs from the _sensitiva_. Some maintain that man and the\r\nanimals must be alike in nature and spirit, because it is possible for man\r\nto catch certain diseases from animals. But animals take certain\r\nproperties from plants, and no one thinks of calling an animal a plant.\r\nMan's nature is threefold: the Divine, which neither deceives nor is\r\ndeceived; the Human, which deceives, but is not deceived; the Brutish,\r\nwhich does not deceive, but is deceived. Dissertations on the various\r\nsciences, the senses, the soul and intellect, things marvellous, demons\r\nand angels, occupy the rest of the chapters of the _De Subtilitate_.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the last book of _De Varietate_, Cardan gives a table\r\nshowing the books of the two works arranged in parallel columns so as to\r\nexhibit the relation they bear to each other. A comparison of the\r\ntreatment accorded to any particular branch of Natural Philosophy in the\r\n_De Subtilitate_ with that given in the _De Varietate_, will show that in\r\nthe last-named work Cardan used his most discursive and anecdotic method.\r\nMechanics are chiefly dealt with in the _De Subtilitate_, and all through\r\nthis treatise he set himself to observe in a certain degree the laws of\r\nproportion, and kept more or less to the point with which he was dealing,\r\na system of treatment which left him with a vast heap of materials on his\r\nhands, even after he had built up the heavy tome of the _De Subtilitate_.\r\nPerhaps when he began his work upon the fresh volume he found this _ingens\r\nacervus_ too intractable and heterogeneous to be susceptible of\r\nsymmetrical arrangement, and was forced to let it remain in confusion. Few\r\nmen would sit down with a light heart to frame a well-ordered treatise out\r\nof the _débris_ of a heap of note-books, and it would be unjust to\r\ncensure Cardan's literary performance because he failed in this task.\r\nProbably no other man living in his day would have achieved a better\r\nresult. It is certain that he expended a vast amount of labour in\r\nattempting to reduce his collected mass of facts even to the imperfect\r\nform it wears in the _De Varietate Rerum_.[120]\r\n\r\nConsidering that this book covers to a great extent the same ground as its\r\npredecessor, Cardan must be credited with considerable ingenuity of\r\ntreatment in presenting his supplementary work without an undue amount of\r\nrepetition. In the _De Varietate_ he always contrives to bring forward\r\nsome fresh fact or fancy to illustrate whatever section of the universe he\r\nmay have under treatment, even though this section may have been already\r\ndealt with in the _De Subtilitate_. The characteristic most strongly\r\nmarked in the later book is the increased eagerness with which he plunges\r\ninto the investigation of certain forces, which he professes to appreciate\r\nas lying beyond Nature, and incapable of scientific verification in the\r\nmodern sense, and the fabled manifestations of the same. He loses no\r\nopportunity of trying to peer behind the curtain, and of seeking--honestly\r\nenough--to formulate those various pseudo-sciences, politely called\r\noccult, which have now fallen into ridicule and disrepute with all except\r\nthe charlatan and the dupe, who are always with us. Where he occupies in\r\nthe _De Subtilitate_ one page in considering those things which lie\r\noutside Nature--demons, ghosts, incantations, succubi, incubi,\r\ndivinations, and such like--he spends ten in the _De Varietate_ over\r\nkindred subjects. There is a wonderful story[121] told by his father of a\r\nghost or demon which he saw in his youth while he was a scholar in the\r\nhouse of Giovanni Resta at Pavia. He searches the pages of Hector\r\nBoethius, Nicolaus Donis, Rugerus, Petrus Toletus, Leo Africanus, and\r\nother chroniclers of the marvellous, for tales of witchcraft, prodigies,\r\nand monstrous men and beasts, and devotes a whole chapter to\r\nchiromancy,[122] a subject with which he had occupied his plenteous\r\nleisure when he was waiting for patients at Sacco. The diagram of the\r\nhuman hand given by him does not differ greatly from that of the\r\ncontemporary hand-books of the \"Art,\" and the leading lines are just the\r\nsame. The heavenly bodies are as potent here as in Horoscopy. The thumb is\r\ngiven to Mars, the index finger to Jupiter, the middle finger to Saturn,\r\nthe ring finger to the Sun, and the little finger to Venus. Each\r\nfinger-joint has its name, the lowest being called the procondyle, the\r\nmiddle the condyle, and the upper the metacondyle. He passes briefly over\r\nas lines of little import, the _via combusta_ and the _Cingulus Orionis_,\r\nbut lays some stress on the character of the nails and the knitting\r\ntogether of the hand, declaring that hands which can be bent easily\r\nbackward denote effeminacy or a rapacious spirit. He teaches that lines\r\nare most abundant in the hands of children, on account of the tenderness\r\nof the skin, and of old men on account of the dryness, a statement which\r\nmight suggest the theory that lines come into existence through the\r\nopening and closing of the hand. But the adoption of this view would have\r\nproved more disastrous to chiromancy than ridicule or serious criticism;\r\nso he straightway finds an explanation for this fact in the postulate that\r\nlines in young people's hands speak as to the future, and in old men's as\r\nto the past. Later he goes on to affirm that lines in the hand cannot be\r\ntreated as mere wrinkles arising from the folding of the skin, unless we\r\nare prepared to admit that wrinkled people are more humorous than others,\r\nalluding no doubt to the lines in the face caused by laughter, a\r\nproposition which does not seem altogether convincing or consequential,\r\nunless we also postulate that all humorous men laugh at every joke. There\r\nis a line in the hand which he calls the _linea jecoraria_, and the\r\ntriangle formed by this and the _linea vitæ_ and the _linea cerebri_,\r\nrules the disposition of the subject, due consideration being given to the\r\nacuteness or obtuseness of the angles of this triangle. Cardan seems to\r\nhave based his treatise on one written by a certain Ruffus Ephesius, and\r\nit is without doubt one of the dullest portions of his work.[123]\r\n\r\nIt is almost certain that Cardan purposed to let the _De Varietate_ come\r\nforth from the press immediately after the _De Subtilitate_, but before\r\nthe MS. was ready, it came to pass that he was called to make that\r\nmemorable journey to Scotland in order to find a remedy for the ailment\r\nwhich was troubling the Archbishop of St. Andrews, a journey which has\r\ngiven to Britons a special interest in his life and work. In dealing with\r\nthe Cosmos in the _De Subtilitate_ he had indeed made brief mention of\r\nBritain; but, writing then, he had no personal relations with either\r\nEngland or Scotland, or the people thereof; and, but for his subsequent\r\nvisit, he would not have been able to set down in the pages of his second\r\nbook so many interesting and suggestive notes of what he had seen and\r\nheard, and his ideas of the politics of the time. Again, if he had not\r\nbeen urged by the desire all men feel to read what others may have to say\r\nabout places they have visited, it is not likely that he would have\r\nsearched the volumes of Hector Boethius and other early writers for\r\nlegends and stories of our island. Writing of Britain[124] in the _De\r\nSubtilitate_ he had praised its delicate wool and its freedom from\r\npoisonous beasts: a land where the wolf had been exterminated, and where\r\nthe sheep might roam unvexed by any beast more formidable than the fox.\r\nThe inordinate breeding of rooks seems even in those days[125] to have led\r\nto a war of extermination against them, carried on upon a system akin to\r\nthat which was waged against the sparrow in the memory of men yet living.\r\nBut besides this one, he records, in the _De Subtilitate_, few facts\r\nconcerning Britain. He quotes the instances of Duns Scotus and Suisset in\r\nsupport of the view that the barbarians are equal to the Italians in\r\nintellect,[126] and he likewise notices the use of a fertilizing\r\nearth--presumably marl--in agriculture,[127] and the longevity of the\r\npeople, some of whom have reached their hundred and twentieth year.[128]\r\nThe first notice of us in the _De Varietate_ is in praise of our forestry,\r\nforasmuch as he remarked that the plane tree, which is almost unknown in\r\nItaly through neglect, thrives well in Scotland, he himself having seen\r\nspecimens over thirty feet high growing in the garden of the Augustinian\r\nconvent near Edinburgh. The lack of fruit in England he attributes rather\r\nto the violence of the wind than to the cold; but, in spite of our cruel\r\nskies, he was able to eat ripe plums in September, in a district close to\r\nthe Scottish border. He bewails the absence of olives and nuts, and\r\nrecommends the erection of garden-walls in order to help on the\r\ncultivation of the more delicate fruits.\r\n\r\nIn a conversation with the Archbishop of St. Andrews he was told that the\r\nKing of Scots ruled over one hundred and sixty-one islands, that the\r\npeople of the Shetland Islands lived for the most part on fish prepared by\r\nfreezing or sun-drying or fire, and had no other wealth than the skins of\r\nbeasts. Cardan pictures the Shetlanders of that time as leading an ideal\r\nlife, unvexed by discord, war, or ambition, labouring in the summer for\r\nthe needs of winter, worshipping Christ, visited only once a year by a\r\npriest from Orkney, who came over to baptize the children born within the\r\nlast twelve months, and was remunerated by a tenth of the catch of fish.\r\nHe speaks of the men of Orkney as a very lively, robust, and open-hearted\r\ncrew, furnished with heads strong enough to defy drunkenness, even after\r\nswallowing draughts of the most potent wine. The land swarms with birds,\r\nand the sheep bring forth two or even three lambs at a time. The horses\r\nare a mean breed, and resemble asses both as to their size and their\r\npatience. Some one told him of a fish, often seen round about the islands,\r\nas big or even bigger than a horse, with a hide of marvellous toughness,\r\nand useful for the abundance of oil yielded by its carcase. He attributes\r\nthe bodily strength of these northerners to the absence of four\r\ndeleterious influences--drunkenness, care, heat, and dry air. Cardan seems\r\nto have been astonished at the wealth of precious stones he found in\r\nScotland--dark blue stones, diamonds, and carbuncles[129]--\"maxime juxta\r\nacademiam Glaguensis oppidi in Gludisdalia regione,\" and he casts about to\r\nexplain how it is that England produces nothing of the kind, but only\r\nsilver and lead. He solves the question by laying down an axiom that the\r\nharder the environment, the harder the stone produced. The mountains of\r\nScotland are both higher and presumably harder than those of England,\r\nhence the carbuncles.\r\n\r\nHe was evidently fascinated with the wealth of local legend and story\r\nwhich haunted the misty regions he visited. In dealing with demons and\r\nfamiliar spirits he cites the authority of Merlin, \"whose fame is still\r\ngreat in England,\" and tells a story of a young woman living in the\r\ncountry of Mar.[130] This damsel was of noble family and very fair in\r\nperson, but she displayed a great unwillingness to enter the marriage\r\nstate. One day it was discovered that she was pregnant, and when the\r\nparents went to make inquisition for the seducer, the girl confessed that,\r\nboth by day and night, a young man of surpassing beauty used to come and\r\nlie with her. Who he was and whence he came she knew not. They, though\r\nthey gave little credit to her words, were informed by her handmaid, some\r\nthree days afterwards, that the young man was once more with her;\r\nwherefore, having broken open the door, they entered, bearing lights and\r\ntorches, and beheld, lying in their daughter's arms, a monster, fearsome\r\nand dreadful beyond human belief. All the neighbours ran quickly to behold\r\nthe grisly sight, and amongst them a good priest, well acquainted with\r\npagan rites. When he had come anear, and had said some verses of the\r\nGospel of Saint John, the fiend vanished with a terrible noise, bearing\r\naway the roof of the chamber, and leaving the bed in flames. In three\r\ndays' time the girl gave birth to a monstrous child, more hideous than\r\nanything heretofore seen in Scotland, wherefore the nurses, to keep off\r\ndisgrace from the family, caused it to be burnt on a pile of wood. There\r\nis another story of a youth living about fourteen miles from Aberdeen, who\r\nwas visited every night by a demon lady of wonderful loveliness, though he\r\nbolted and locked his chamber-door; but by fasting and praying and\r\nkeeping his thoughts fixed on holy things he rid himself at last of the\r\nunclean spirit.[131] He quotes from Boethius the whole story of\r\nMacbeth,[132] and tells how \"Duffus rex\" languished and wasted under the\r\nmalefic arts of certain witches who made an image of the king in wax and,\r\nby using various incantations, let the same melt slowly away before the\r\nfire. The unhappy king came near to die, but, as soon as these nefarious\r\npractices were discovered, the image was destroyed, whereupon the king was\r\nrestored to health.[133]\r\n\r\nWhen Cardan received the first letter from Scotland the manuscript of the\r\n_De Varietate_ must have been ready or nearly ready for the printer; but,\r\nfor some reason or other, he determined to postpone the publication of the\r\nwork until he should have finished with the Archbishop, and took his\r\nmanuscript with him when he set forth on his travels. In 1550 there came\r\nanother break in Cardan's life as Professor at Pavia, the reason being the\r\nusual one of dearth of funds.[134] In 1551 he went back for a short time,\r\nbut the storms of war were rising on all sides, and the luckless city of\r\nPavia was in the very centre of the disturbance. The French once more\r\ncrossed the Alps, pillaging and devastating the country, their ostensible\r\nmission being the vindication of the rights of Ottavio Farnese to the\r\nDuchy of Parma. Ottavio had quarrelled with Pope Julius III., who called\r\nupon the Emperor for assistance. War was declared, and Charles set to work\r\nto annex Parma and Piacenza as well to the Milanese. Cardan withdrew to\r\nMilan at the end of the year. Gian Battista had now completed his medical\r\ncourse, so there was now no reason why he should continue to live\r\npermanently at Pavia. Moreover at this juncture he seems to have been\r\nstrongly moved to augment the fame which he had already won in Mathematics\r\nand Medicine by some great literary achievement, and he worked diligently\r\nwith this object in view.[135]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of November 1551, a letter came to him from\r\nCassanate,[136] a Franco-Spanish physician, who was at that time in\r\nattendance upon the Archbishop of St. Andrews, requesting him to make the\r\njourney to Paris, and there to meet the Archbishop, who was suffering from\r\nan affection of the lungs. The fame of Cardan as a physician had spread as\r\nfar as Scotland, and the Archbishop had set his heart on consulting him.\r\nCassanate's letter is of prodigious length. After a diffuse exordium he\r\nproceeds to praise in somewhat fulsome terms the _De Libris Propriis_ and\r\nthe treatises _De Sapientia_[137] and _De Consolatione_, which had been\r\ngiven to him by a friend when he was studying at Toulouse in 1549. He had\r\njust read the _De Subtilitate_, and was inflamed with desire to become\r\nacquainted with everything which Cardan had ever written. But what struck\r\nCassanate more than anything was a passage in the _De Sapientia_ on a\r\nmedical question, which he extracts and incorporates in his epistle.\r\nCardan writes there: \"But if my profession itself will not give me a\r\nliving, nor open out an avenue to some other career, I must needs set my\r\nbrains to work, to find therein something unknown hitherto, for the charm\r\nof novelty is unfailing, something which would prove of the highest\r\nutility in a particular case. In Milan, while I was fighting the battle\r\nagainst hostile prejudice, and was unable to earn enough to pay my way (so\r\nmuch harder is the lot of manifest than of hidden merit, and no man is\r\nhonoured as a prophet in his own country), I brought to light much fresh\r\nknowledge, and worked my hardest at my art, for outside my art there was\r\nnaught to be done. At last I discovered a cure for phthisis, which is also\r\nknown as Phthoe, a disease for many centuries deemed incurable, and I\r\nhealed many who are alive to this day as easily as I have cured the\r\n_Gallicus morbus_. I also discovered a cure for intercutaneous water in\r\nmany who still survive. But in the matter of invention, Reason will be the\r\nleader, but Experiment the Master, the stimulating cause of work in\r\nothers. If in any experiment there should seem to be an element of danger,\r\nlet it be performed gently, and little by little.\"[138] It is not\r\nwonderful that the Archbishop, who doubtless heard all about Cardan's\r\nasserted cure of phthisis from Cassanate, should have been eager to submit\r\nhis asthma to Cardan's skill. After acknowledging the deep debt of\r\ngratitude which he, in common with the whole human race, owed to Cardan in\r\nrespect to the two discoveries aforesaid, Cassanate comes to the business\r\nin hand, to wit, the Archbishop's asthma. Not content with giving a most\r\nminute description of the symptoms, he furnishes Cardan also with a theory\r\nof the operations of the distemper. He writes: \"The disease at first took\r\nthe form of a distillation from the brain into the lungs, accompanied with\r\nhoarseness, which, with the help of the physician in attendance, was cured\r\nfor a time, but the temperature of the brain continued unfavourable, being\r\ntoo cold and too moist, so that certain unhealthy humours were collected\r\nin the head and there remained, because the brain could neither\r\nassimilate its own nutriment, nor disperse the humours which arose from\r\nbelow, being weakened through its nutriment of pituitous blood. After an\r\nattack of this nature it always happened that, whenever the body was\r\nfilled with any particular matter, which, in the form of substance, or\r\nvapour, or quality, might invade the brain, a fresh attack would certainly\r\narise, in the form of a fresh flow of the same humour down to the lungs.\r\nMoreover these attacks were found to agree almost exactly with the\r\nconjunctions and oppositions of the moon.\"[139]\r\n\r\nCassanate goes on to say that his patient had proved somewhat intractable,\r\nrefusing occasionally to have anything to do with his medical attendants,\r\nand that real danger was impending owing to the flow of humour having\r\nbecome chronic. Fortunately this humour was not acrid or salt; if it were,\r\nphthisis must at once supervene. But the Archbishop's lungs were becoming\r\nmore and more clogged with phlegm, and a stronger effort of coughing was\r\nnecessary to clear them. Latterly much of the thick phlegm had adhered to\r\nthe lungs, and consequently the difficulty of breathing was great.\r\nCassanate declares that he had been able to do no more than to keep the\r\nArchbishop alive, and he fears no one would be able to work a complete\r\ncure, seeing that the air of Scotland is so moist and salt, and that the\r\nArchbishop is almost worried to death by the affairs of State. He next\r\nurges Cardan to consent to meet the Archbishop in Paris, a city in which\r\nlearning of all sorts flourishes exceedingly, the nurse of many great\r\nphilosophers, and one in which Cardan would assuredly meet the honour and\r\nreverence which is his due. The Archbishop's offer was indeed magnificent\r\nin its terms. Funds would be provided generous enough to allow the\r\nphysician to travel post the whole of the journey, and the goodwill of all\r\nthe rulers of the states _en route_ would be enlisted in his favour.\r\nCassanate finishes by fixing the end of January 1552 as a convenient date\r\nfor the _rendezvous_ in Paris, and, as time and place accorded with\r\nCardan's wishes, he wrote to Cassanate accepting the offer.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of St. Andrews was John Hamilton, the illegitimate brother\r\nof James, Earl of Arran, who had been chosen Regent of the kingdom after\r\nthe death of James V. at Flodden, and the bar sinister, in this case as in\r\nmany others, was the ensign of a courage and talent and resource in which\r\nthe lawful offspring was conspicuously wanting. Any student taking a\r\ncursory glance at the epoch of violence and complicated intrigue which\r\nmarked the infancy of Mary of Scotland, may well be astonished that a man\r\nso weak and vain and incompetent as James Hamilton--albeit his footing was\r\nmade more secure by his position as the Queen's heir-presumptive--should\r\nhave held possession of his high dignities so long as he did. Alternately\r\nthe tool of France and of England, he would one day cause his great rival\r\nCardinal Beatoun to be proclaimed an enemy of his country, and the next\r\nwould meet him amicably and adopt his policy. After becoming the partisan\r\nof Henry VIII. and the foe of Rome, he finally put the coping-stone to his\r\ninconsistencies by becoming a convert to Catholicism in 1543. But in spite\r\nof his indolence and weakness, he was still Regent of Scotland, when his\r\nbrother, the Archbishop, was seized with that attack of periodic asthma\r\nwhich threatened to change vitally the course of Scottish politics. A very\r\nslight study of contemporary records will show that Arran had been\r\nlargely, if not entirely, indebted to the distinguished talents and to the\r\nambition of his brother for his continued tenure of the chief power of the\r\nState. If confirmation of this view be needed, it will be found in the\r\nfact that, as soon as the Archbishop was confined to a sick-room, Mary of\r\nGuise, the Queen Mother, supported by her brothers in France and by the\r\nCatholic party at home, began to undermine the Regent's position by\r\nintrigue, and ultimately, partly by coaxing, partly by threats, won from\r\nhim a promise to surrender his power into her hands.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Cardan was waiting for further intelligence and directions\r\nas to his journey. The end of January had been fixed as the date of the\r\nmeeting at Paris, and it was not until the middle of February that any\r\nfurther tidings came to him. Then he received a letter from Cassanate and\r\na remittance to cover the expenses of his journey.[140] He set out at once\r\non February 22, undaunted by the prospect of a winter crossing of the\r\nSimplon, and, having travelled by way of Sion and Geneva, arrived at Lyons\r\non March 13. In Cassanate's first letter Paris had been named as the place\r\nof meeting; but, as a concession to Cardan's convenience, Lyons was added\r\nas an alternative, in case he should find it impossible to spare time for\r\na longer journey. Cardan accordingly halted at Lyons, but neither\r\nArchbishop nor physician was there to meet him. After he had waited for\r\nmore than a month, Cassanate appeared alone, and brought with him a heavy\r\npurse of money for the cost of the long journey to Scotland, which he now\r\nbegged Cardan to undertake, and a letter from the Archbishop himself, who\r\nwrote word that, though he had fully determined in the first instance to\r\nrepair to Paris, or even to Lyons, to meet Cardan, he found himself at\r\npresent mastered by the turn of circumstances, and compelled to stay at\r\nhome. He promised Cardan a generous reward, and a reception of a nature to\r\nconvince him that the Scots are not such Scythians as they might perchance\r\nbe deemed in Milan.[141] Cardan's temper was evidently upset by this turn\r\nof affairs, and his suspicions aroused; for he sets down his belief that\r\npatient and physician had from the first worked with the intention of\r\ndragging him all the way to Scotland, but that they had waited till he was\r\nacross the Alps before showing their hand, fearing lest if the word\r\nScotland should have been used at the outset, he would never have moved\r\nfrom Milan.[142] In describing his journey he writes:--\"I tarried in Lyons\r\nforty-six days, seeing nothing of the Archbishop, nor of the physician\r\nwhom I expected, nevertheless I gained more than I spent. I met there\r\nLudovico Birago, a gentleman of Milan, and commander of the King's\r\nfoot-soldiers, and with him I contracted a close friendship, so much so\r\nthat, had I been minded to take service under Brissac, the King's\r\nlieutenant, I might have enjoyed a salary of one thousand crowns a year.\r\nShortly afterwards Guglielmo Cassanate, the Archbishop's physician,\r\narrived in Lyons and brought with him three hundred other golden crowns,\r\nwhich he handed to me, in order that I might make the journey with him to\r\nScotland, offering in addition to pay the cost of travel, and promising me\r\ndivers gifts in addition. Thus, making part of our journey down the\r\nLoire, I arrived at Paris. While I was there I met Orontius; but he for\r\nsome reason or other refused to visit me. Under the escort of\r\nMagnienus[143] I inspected the treasury of the French Kings, and the\r\nChurch of Saint Denis. I saw likewise something there, not so famous, but\r\nmore interesting to my mind, and this was the horn of a unicorn, whole and\r\nuninjured. After this we met the King's physicians, and we all dined\r\ntogether, but I declined to hold forth to them during dinner, because\r\nbefore we sat down they were urgent that I should begin a discussion. I\r\nnext set forth on my journey, my relations with Pharnelius and Silvius,\r\nand another of the King's physicians,[144] whom I left behind, being of a\r\nmost friendly nature, and travelled to Boulogne in France, where, by the\r\ncommand of the Governor of Sarepont, an escort of fourteen armed horsemen\r\nand twenty foot-soldiers was assigned to me, and so to Calais. I saw the\r\ntower of Cæsar still standing. Then having crossed the narrow sea I went\r\nto London, and at last met the Archbishop at Edinburgh on the\r\ntwenty-ninth of June. I remained there till the thirteenth of September. I\r\nreceived as a reward four hundred more gold crowns; a chain of gold worth\r\na hundred and twenty crowns, a noble horse, and many other gifts, in order\r\nthat no one of those who were with me should return empty-handed.\"[145]\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop's illness might in itself have supplied a reason for his\r\ninability to travel abroad and meet Cardan as he had agreed to do; but the\r\nreal cause of his change of plan was doubtless the condition of public\r\naffairs in Scotland at the beginning of 1552. In the interval of time\r\nbetween Cassanate's first letter to Cardan and the end of 1551, the Regent\r\nhad half promised to surrender his office into the hands of the Guise\r\nparty in Scotland, wherefore it was no wonder that the Primate,\r\nrecognizing how grave was the danger which threatened the source of his\r\npower, should have resolved that, sick or sound, his proper place was at\r\nthe Scottish Court.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[112] Vesalius had certainly lectured on anatomy at Pavia, but it would\r\nappear that Cardan did not know him personally, seeing that he writes in\r\n_De Libris Propriis_ (_Opera_, tom. i. p. 138): \"Brasavolum ... nunquam\r\nvidi, ut neque Vesalium quamquam intimum mihi amicum.\"\r\n\r\n[113] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xxxii. p. 99.\r\n\r\n[114] In describing Fazio, Jerome writes: \"Erat Euclidis operum studiosus,\r\net humeris incurvis: et filius meus natu major ore, oculis, incessu,\r\nhumeris, illi simillimus.\"--_De Vita Propria_, ch. iii. p. 8.

In the _Novellino_ of Masuccio, which was first\r\nprinted in 1476, there is a passage in the tenth novel of the first part,\r\nin which a rogue passes as \"grandissimo cognoscitore\" of gems because he\r\nhad spent much time in Scotland.\r\n\r\n[130] _De Varietate_, p. 636.\r\n\r\n[131] _De Varietate_, p. 637.\r\n\r\n[132] _Ibid.,_ p. 637.\r\n\r\n[133] _Ibid.,_ p. 565.\r\n\r\n[134] \"Peracto L anno quod stipendium non remuneraretur mansi\r\nMediolani.\"--_De Vita Propria_, ch. iv. p. 15.\r\n\r\n[135] About this time he wrote the _Liber Decem Problematum_, and the\r\ntreatise _Delle Burle Calde_, one of his few works written in\r\nItalian.--_Opera_, tom. i. p. 109.\r\n\r\n[136] Cassanate's letter is given in full (_Opera_, tom. i. p. 89).\r\n\r\n[137] The quotation from the _De Sapientia_ differs somewhat from the\r\noriginal passage which stands on p. 578 of the same volume.\r\n\r\n[138] _Opera_, tom. i. p. 89.\r\n\r\n[139] In a subsequent interview with Cardan, Cassanate modifies this\r\nstatement.--_Opera_, tom. ix. p. 124.\r\n\r\n[140] \"Accepique antequam discederem aureos coronatos Gallicos 500 et\r\nM.C.C. in reditu.\"--_De Vita Propria_, ch. iv. p. 16.\r\n\r\n[141] \"Difficillimis causis victus venire non potui.\" The Archbishop's\r\nletter is given in _Opera_, tom. i. p. 137.\r\n\r\n[142] _Geniturarum Exempla_, p. 469.\r\n\r\n[143] He mentions this personage in _De Varietate_, p. 672: \"Johannes\r\nManienus medicus, vir egregius et mathematicaram studiosus.\" He was\r\nphysician to the monks of Saint Denis.\r\n\r\n[144] The reception given to Cardan in Paris was a very friendly one.\r\nOrontius was a mechanician and mathematician; and jealousy of Cardan's\r\ngreat repute may have kept him away from the dinner, but the physicians\r\nwere most hospitable. Pharnelius [Fernel] was Professor of Medicine at the\r\nUniversity, and physician to the Court. Sylvius was an old man of a\r\njocular nature, but as an anatomist bitterly opposed to the novel methods\r\nof Vesalius, who was one of Cardan's heroes. With this possibility of\r\nquarrelling over the merits of Vesalius, it speaks well for the temper of\r\nthe doctors that they parted on good terms. Ranconet, another Parisian who\r\nwelcomed Cardan heartily, was one of the Presidents of the Parliament of\r\nParis. He seems to have been a man of worth and distinguished attainments,\r\nand Cardan gives an interesting account of him in _Geniturarum Exempla_,\r\np. 423.\r\n\r\n[145] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xxix. p. 75. Cardan refers more than once to\r\nthe generosity of the Archbishop. He computes (_Opera_, tom. i. p. 93)\r\nthat his visit must have cost Hamilton four talents of gold; that is to\r\nsay, two thousand golden crowns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nCARDAN, as he has himself related, arrived at Edinburgh on June 29, 1552.\r\nThe coming of such a man at such a time must have been an event of\r\nextraordinary interest. In England the Italy of the Renaissance had been\r\nin a measure realized by men of learning and intellect through the reports\r\nof the numerous scholars--John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, Henry Parker,\r\nLord Morley, Howard Earl of Surrey, and Sir Thomas Wyat, may be taken as\r\nexamples--who had wandered thither and come back with a stock of histories\r\nsetting forth the beauty and charm, and also the terror and wickedness, of\r\nthat wonderful land. Some echoes of this legend had doubtless drifted down\r\nto Scotland, and possibly still more may have been wafted over from\r\nFrance. Ascham had taken up his parable in the _Schoolmaster_, describing\r\nthe devilish sins and corruptions of Italy, and now the good people of\r\nEdinburgh were to be given the sight of a man coming thence, one who was\r\nfabled to have gathered together more knowledge, both of this world and of\r\nthat other hidden one which was to them just as real, than any mortal man\r\nalive. Under these circumstances it is not surprising that Cardan should\r\nhave been regarded rather as a magician than as a doctor, and in the\r\n_Scotichronicon_[146] it is recorded that the Primate was cured of a\r\nlingering asthma by the incantations of an astrologer named Cardan, from\r\nMilan. Cardan in his narrative speaks of Edinburgh as the place where he\r\nmet his patient, and does not mention any other place of sojourn, but the\r\nrecord just quoted goes on to say that he abode with the Primate for\r\neleven weeks at his country residence at Monimail, near Cupar, Fife, where\r\nthere is a well called to this day Cardan's Well.\r\n\r\nCardan, as it has been noticed already, refused to commit himself to any\r\nopinion as to the character of the Archbishop's distemper over the\r\ndinner-table where he and Cassanate had been entertained by the French\r\nKing's physicians. Cassanate had set forth his views in full as to the\r\nnature of the asthma which had to be dealt with in his letter to Cardan,\r\nand it is highly probable that he would again bring forward these views in\r\nthe hearing of the Paris doctors. It is certain that some of the French\r\nphysicians had, previous to this, prescribed a course of treatment for the\r\nArchbishop, probably without seeing him, and that the course was being\r\ntried when Cardan arrived in Edinburgh.[147] For the first six weeks of\r\nhis stay he watched the case, and let the treatment aforesaid go\r\non--whether it differed from that which Cassanate recommended or not there\r\nis no evidence to show. But no good result came of it. The Archbishop\r\nwasted in body and became fretful and disturbed in mind, and, at last,\r\nCardan was obliged to let his opinion of the case be known; and, as this\r\nwas entirely hostile to the treatment which was being pursued, the\r\ninevitable quarrel between the doctors burst forth with great violence.\r\nThe Archbishop was irate with his ordinary medical attendant, probably the\r\nphysician who was left in charge during Cassanate's absence--and this man\r\nretaliated upon Cardan for having thus stirred up strife. Cardan's\r\nposition was certainly a very uneasy one. The other physicians were full\r\nof jealousy and malice, and the Archbishop began to accuse him of dilatory\r\nconduct of the case, redoubling his complaints as soon as he found himself\r\ngetting better under the altered treatment. So weary did Cardan become of\r\nthis bickering that he begged leave to depart at once, but this\r\nproposition the Primate took in very ill part.\r\n\r\nCassanate in his first diagnosis had traced the Archbishop's illness to an\r\nexcess of coldness and humidity in the brain. Now Cardan, on the other\r\nhand, maintained that the brain was too hot. He found Cassanate's\r\ntreatment too closely fettered by his theory as to the causes of periodic\r\nasthma, but he did not venture to exhibit his own course of treatment till\r\nafter he had gained some knowledge of the Archbishop's temper and habits.\r\nHe came to the conclusion that his patient was overwrought with the cares\r\nof State, that he ate too freely, that he did not sleep enough, and that\r\nhe was of a temper somewhat choleric. Cardan set forth this view of the\r\ncase in a voluminous document, founding the course of treatment he\r\nproposed to pursue upon the aphorisms of Galen. He altogether rejected\r\nCassanate's view as to the retention of the noxious humours in the head.\r\nThe Archbishop had the ruddy complexion of a man in good health, a\r\ncondition which could scarcely co-exist with the loading of the brain\r\nwith matter which would certainly putrify if retained for any long time.\r\nCardan maintained that the serous humour descended into the lungs, not by\r\nthe passages, but by soaking through the membranes as through linen.[148]\r\nAfter describing the origin and the mode of descent of this humour, he\r\ngoes on to search for an auxiliary cause of the mischief, and this he\r\nfinds in the imperfect digestive powers of the stomach and liver. If the\r\ncause lay entirely in the brain, how was it that all the cerebral\r\nfunctions were not vitiated? In fine, the source of the disease lay, not\r\nin the weakness of the brain, but in an access of heat, caused possibly by\r\nexposure to the sun, by which the matter of the brain had become so\r\nrarefied that it showed unhealthy activity in absorbing moisture from the\r\nother parts. This heat, therefore, must be reduced.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this end three lines of treatment must be followed. First, a\r\nproper course of diet; second, drugs; and third, certain manual\r\noperations. As to diet, the Archbishop was ordered to take nothing but\r\nlight and cooling food, two to four pints of asses' milk in the early\r\nmorning, drawn from an ass fed on cooling herbs, and to use all such foods\r\nas had a fattening tendency; tortoise or turtle-soup,[149] distilled\r\nsnails, barley-water and chicken-broth, and divers other rich edibles. The\r\npurging of the brain was a serious business; it was to be compassed by an\r\napplication to the coronal suture of an ointment made of Greek pitch,\r\nship's tar, white mustard, euphorbium, and honey of anathardus: the\r\ncompound to be sharpened, if necessary, by the addition of blister fly, or\r\nrendered less searching by leaving out the euphorbium and mustard. Cardan\r\nadds, that, by the use of this persuasive application, he had sometimes\r\nbrought out two pints of water in twenty-four hours. The use of the\r\nshower-bath and plentiful rubbing with dry cloths was also recommended.\r\n\r\nThe purging of the body was largely a question of diet. To prevent\r\ngeneration of moisture, perfumes were to be used; the patient was to sleep\r\non raw silk and not upon feathers, and to let an hour and a half come\r\nbetween supper and bed-time. Sleep, after all, was the great thing to be\r\nsought. The Archbishop was counselled to sleep from seven to ten hours,\r\nand to subtract time from his studies and his business and add the same to\r\nsleep.[150]\r\n\r\nCardan's treatment, which seems to have been suggested as much by the man\r\nof common-sense as by the physician, soon began to tell favourably upon\r\nthe Archbishop. He remained for thirty-five days in charge of his patient,\r\nduring which time the distemper lost its virulence and the patient gained\r\nflesh. In the meantime the fame of his skill had spread abroad, and\r\nwell-nigh the whole nobility of Scotland flocked to consult him,[151] and\r\nthey paid him so liberally that on one day he made nineteen golden crowns.\r\nBut when winter began to draw near, Cardan felt that it was time to move\r\nsouthward. He feared the cold; he longed to get back to his sons, and he\r\nwas greatly troubled by the continued ill-behaviour of one of the servants\r\nhe had brought with him--\"maledicus, invidus, avarissimus, Dei\r\ncontemptor;\" but he found his patient very loth to let him depart. The\r\nArchbishop declared that his illness was alleviated but not cured, and\r\nonly gave way unwillingly when Cardan brought forward arguments to show\r\nwhat dangers and inconveniences he would incur through a longer stay.\r\nCardan had originally settled to return by way of Paris, but letters which\r\nhe received from his young kinsman, Gasparo Cardano, and from Ranconet,\r\nled him to change his plans. The country was in a state of anarchy, the\r\nroads being infested with thieves, and Gasparo himself had the bad fortune\r\nto be taken by a gang of ruffians. In consequence of these things Cardan\r\ndetermined to return by way of Flanders and the Empire.\r\n\r\nIt was not in reason that Cardan would quit Scotland and resign the care\r\nof his patient without taking the stars into his counsel as to the future.\r\nHe cast the Archbishop's horoscope, and published it in the _Geniturarum\r\nExempla_. It was not a successful feat. In his forty-eighth year, _i.e._\r\nin 1560, the astrologer declared that Hamilton would be in danger of\r\npoison and of suffering from an affection of the heart. But the time of\r\nthe greatest peril seemed to lie between July 30 and September 21, 1554.\r\nThe stars gave no warning of the tragic fate which befell Archbishop\r\nHamilton in the not very distant future. For the succeeding six years he\r\ngoverned the Church in Scotland with prudence and leniency, but in 1558 he\r\nbegan a persecution of the reformers which kindled a religious strife,\r\nhighly embarrassing to the Catholic party then holding the reins of\r\npower. His cruelties were borne in mind by the reformers when they got the\r\nupper hand. In 1563 he was imprisoned for saying mass. In 1568 Mary, after\r\nher escape from Loch Leven, gave the chief direction of her affairs into\r\nthe hands of the Archbishop, who was the bitter foe of the Regent Murray.\r\nMurray having defeated the Queen's forces at Langside, Hamilton took\r\nrefuge in Dumbarton Castle, which was surprised and captured in 1571, when\r\nthe Archbishop was taken to Stirling and hanged. In the words of the\r\n_Diurnal of Occurrants_: \"as the bell struck six hours at even, he was\r\nhangit at the mercat cross of Stirling upon a jebat.\"[152] His enemies\r\nwould not let him rest even there, for the next day, fixed to the tree,\r\nwere found the following verses:\r\n\r\n    \"Cresce diu, felix arbor, semperque vireto\r\n    Frondibus ut nobis talia poma feras.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to Cardan. Having at last won from his patient leave to depart,\r\nhe set forth laden with rich gifts. In Scotland, Cardan found the most\r\ngenerous paymasters he had ever met. In recording the niggard treatment\r\nwhich he subsequently experienced at the hands of Brissac, the French\r\nViceroy, he contrasts it with the liberal rewards granted to him in what\r\nmust then have been the poorest of the European kingdoms;[153] and in the\r\nPreface of the _De Astrorum Judiciis_ (Basel, 1554) he writes in\r\nsympathetic and grateful terms of the kind usage he had met in the\r\nNorth.[154] It must have been a severe disappointment to him that he was\r\nunable to revisit Paris on his way home, for letters from his friend\r\nRanconet told him that a great number of illustrious men had proposed to\r\nrepair to Paris for the sake of meeting him; and many of the nobles of\r\nFrance were anxious to consult him professionally, one of them offering a\r\nfee of a thousand gold crowns. But Cardan was so terrified by the report\r\ngiven by Gasparo of the state of France, that he made up his mind he would\r\non no account touch its frontiers on his homeward journey.\r\n\r\nBefore he quitted Scotland there had come to him letters from the English\r\nCourt entreating him to tarry there some days on his way home to Italy,\r\nand give his opinion on the health of Edward VI., who was then slowly\r\nrecovering from an attack of smallpox and measles. The young King's\r\nrecovery was more apparent than real, for he was, in fact, slowly sinking\r\nunder the constitutional derangement which killed him a few months later.\r\nCardan could hardly refuse to comply with this request, nor is there any\r\nevidence to show that he made this visit to London unwillingly. But he\r\nsoon found out that those about the Court were anxious to hear from him\r\nsomething more than a statement of his opinion as to Edward's health. They\r\nwanted, before all else, to learn what the stars had to say as to the\r\nprobable duration of the sovereign's life. During his stay in Scotland\r\nCardan would certainly have gained some intelligence of the existing\r\nstate of affairs at the English Court; how in the struggle for the custody\r\nof the regal power, the Lord High Admiral and the Lord Protector, the\r\nKing's uncles, had lost their heads; and how the Duke of Northumberland,\r\nthe son of Dudley, the infamous minion of Henry VII. and the destroyer of\r\nthe ill-fated Seymours, had now gathered all the powers and dignities of\r\nthe kingdom into his own hands, and was waiting impatiently for the death\r\nof Edward, an event which would enable him to control yet more completely\r\nthe supreme power, through the puppet queen whom he had ready at hand to\r\nplace upon the throne. An Italian of the sixteenth century, steeped in the\r\ntraditions of the bloody and insidious state-craft of Milan and the\r\nLombard cities, Cardan would naturally shrink from committing himself to\r\nany such perilous utterance: all the more for the reason that he had\r\nalready formed an estimate of the English as a fierce and cruel people.\r\nWith his character as a magician to maintain he could scarcely keep entire\r\nsilence, so he wrote down for the satisfaction of his interrogators a\r\nhoroscope: a mere perfunctory piece of work, as we learn afterwards. He\r\nbegins by reciting the extraordinary nature of the King's birth, repeating\r\nthe legend that his mother was delivered of him by surgical aid, and only\r\nlived a few hours afterwards; and declares that, in his opinion, it would\r\nhave been better had this boy never been born at all. \"Nevertheless,\r\nseeing that he had come into this world and been duly trained and\r\neducated, it would be well for mankind were he to live long, for all the\r\ngraces waited upon him. Boy as he was, he was skilled in divers tongues,\r\nLatin, English, and French, and not unversed in Greek, Italian, and\r\nSpanish; he had likewise knowledge of dialectics, natural philosophy, and\r\nmusic. His culture is the reflection of our mortal nature; his gravity\r\nthat of kingly majesty, and his disposition is worthy of so illustrious a\r\nprince. Speaking generally, it was indeed a strange experience to realize\r\nthat this boy of so great talent and promise was being educated in the\r\nknowledge of the affairs of men. I have not set forth his accomplishments,\r\ntricked out with rhetoric so as to exceed the truth; of which, in sooth,\r\nmy relation falls short.\" Cardan next draws a figure of Edward's\r\nhoroscope, and devotes several pages to the customary jargon of\r\nastrologers; and, under the heading \"De animi qualitatibus,\" says: \"There\r\nwas something portentous about this boy. He had learnt, as I heard, seven\r\nlanguages, and certainly he knew thoroughly his own, French, and Latin. He\r\nwas skilled in Dialectic, and eager to be instructed in all subjects. When\r\nI met him, he was in his fifteenth year, and he asked me (speaking Latin\r\nno less perfectly and fluently than myself), 'What is contained in those\r\nrare books of yours, _De rerum varietate_?' for I had dedicated these\r\nmanuscripts to his name.[155] Whereupon I began by pointing out to him\r\nwhat I had written in the opening chapter on the cause of the comets which\r\nothers had sought so long in vain. He was curious to hear more of this\r\ncause, so I went on to tell him that it was the collected light of the\r\nwandering stars. 'Then,' said he, 'how is it, since the stars are set\r\ngoing by various impulses, that this light is not scattered, or carried\r\nalong with the stars in their courses?' I replied: 'It does indeed move\r\nwith them, but at a speed vastly greater on account of the difference of\r\nour point of view; as, for instance, when the prism is cast upon the wall\r\nby the sun and the crystal, then the least motion of the crystal will\r\nshift the position of the reflection to a great distance.' The King said:\r\n'But how can this be done when no _subjectum_ is provided? for in the case\r\nyou quote the wall is the _subjectum_ to the reflection.' I replied: 'It\r\nis a similar effect to that which we observe in the Milky Way, and in the\r\nreflection of light when many candles are lighted in a mass; these always\r\nproduce a certain clear and lucent medium. _Itaque ex ungue leonem_.'\r\n\r\n\"This youth was the great hope of good and learned men everywhere, by\r\nreason of his frankness and the gentleness of his manners. He began to\r\ntake an interest in the Arts before he understood them, and to understand\r\nthem before he had full occasion to use them. The production of such a\r\npersonality was an effort of humanity; and, should he be snatched away\r\nbefore his time, not only England, but all the world must mourn his loss.\r\n\r\n\"When he was required to show the gravity of a king, he would appear to be\r\nan old man. He played upon the lyre; he took interest in public affairs;\r\nand was of a kingly mind, following thus the example of his father, who,\r\nwhile he was over-careful to do right, managed to exhibit himself to the\r\nworld in an evil light. But the son was free from any suspicion of such a\r\ncharge, and his intelligence was brought to maturity by the study of\r\nphilosophy.\"\r\n\r\nCardan next makes an attempt to gauge the duration of the King's life, and\r\nwhen it is considered that he was a skilled physician, and Edward a sickly\r\nboy, fast sinking into a decline, it is to be feared that he let sincerity\r\ngive way to prudence when he proclaimed that, in his fifty-sixth year the\r\nKing would be troubled with divers illnesses. \"Speaking generally of the\r\nwhole duration of his life he will be found to be steadfast, firm,\r\nsevere, chaste, intelligent, an observer of righteousness, patient under\r\ntrouble, mindful both of injuries and benefits, one demanding reverence\r\nand seeking his own. He would lust as a man, but would suffer the curse of\r\nimpotence. He would be wise beyond measure, and thereby win the admiration\r\nof the world; very prudent and high-minded; fortunate, and indeed a second\r\nSolomon.\"\r\n\r\nEdward VI. died on July 6, 1553, about six months after Cardan had\r\nreturned to Milan; and, before the publication of the _Geniturarum\r\nExempla_ in 1554, the author added to the King's horoscope a supplementary\r\nnote, explaining his conduct thereanent and shedding some light upon the\r\ntortuous and sinister intrigues which at that time engaged the ingenuity\r\nof the leaders about the English Court. Now that he was safe from the\r\nconsequences of giving offence, he wrote in terms much less guarded as to\r\nthe state of English affairs. It must be admitted that his calculations as\r\nto the King's length of days, published after death, have no special value\r\nas calculations; but his impressions of the probable drift of events in\r\nEngland are interesting as the view of a foreigner upon English politics,\r\nand moreover they exhibit in strong light the sinister designs of\r\nNorthumberland. Cardan records his belief that, in the fourth month of his\r\nfifteenth year, the King had been in peril of his life from the plottings\r\nof those immediately about him. On one occasion a particular disposition\r\nof the sun and Mars denoted that he was in danger of plots woven by a\r\nwicked minister, nay, there were threatenings even of poison.[156] He does\r\nnot shrink from affirming that this unfortunate boy met his death by the\r\ntreachery of those about him. As an apology for the horoscope he drew\r\nwhen he was in England, he lays down the principle that it is inexpedient\r\nto give opinions as to the duration of life in dealing with the horoscopes\r\nof those in feeble health, unless you shall beforehand consult all the\r\ndirections and processes and ingresses of the ruling planets, \"and if I\r\nhad not made this reservation in the prognostic I gave to the English\r\ncourtiers, they might justly have found fault with me.\"\r\n\r\nHe next remarks that he had spent much time in framing this\r\nhoroscope--albeit it was imperfect--according to his usual practice, and\r\nthat if he had gone on somewhat farther, and consulted the direction of\r\nthe sun and moon, the danger of death in which the King stood would\r\nstraightway have manifested itself. If he had still been distrustful as to\r\nthe directions aforesaid, and had gone on to observe the processes and\r\ningresses, the danger would have been made clear, but even then he would\r\nnot have dared to predict an early death to one in such high position: he\r\nfeared the treacheries and tumults and the transfer of power which must\r\nensue, and drew a picture of all the evils which might befall himself,\r\nevils which he was in no mood to face. Where should he look for protection\r\namongst a strange people, who had little mercy upon one another and would\r\nhave still less for him, a foreigner, with their ruler a mere boy, who\r\ncould protect neither himself nor his guest? It might easily come about\r\nthat his return to Italy would be hindered; and, supposing the crisis to\r\ncome to the most favourable issue, what would he get in return for all\r\nthis danger and anxiety? He calls to mind the cases of two soothsayers who\r\nwere foolish enough to predict the deaths of princes, Ascletarion, and a\r\ncertain priest, who foretold the deaths of Domitian and Galeazzo Sforza;\r\nand describes their fate, which was one he did not desire to call down\r\nupon himself. Although his forecast as to Edward's future was incomplete\r\nand unsatisfactory, he foresaw what was coming upon the kingdom from the\r\nfact that all the powers thereof, the strong places, the treasury, the\r\nlegislature, and the fleet, were gathered into the hands of one man\r\n(Northumberland). \"And this man, forsooth, was one whose father[157] the\r\nKing's father had beheaded; one who had plunged into confusion all the\r\naffairs of the realm; seeing that he had brought to the scaffold, one\r\nafter the other, the two maternal uncles of the King. Wherefore he was\r\ndriven on both by his evil disposition and by his dread of the future to\r\nconspire against his sovereign's life. Now in such a season as this, when\r\nall men held their tongues for fear (for he brought to trial whomsoever he\r\nwould), when he had gained over the greater part of the nobles to his side\r\nby dividing amongst them the spoil of the Church; when he, the most bitter\r\nfoe of the King's title and dignity, had so contrived that his own will\r\nwas supreme in the business of the State, I became weary of the whole\r\naffair; and, being filled with pity for the young King, proved to be a\r\nbetter prophet on the score of my inborn common-sense, than through my\r\nskill in Astrology. I took my departure straightway, conscious of some\r\nevil hovering anigh, and full of tears.\"[158]\r\n\r\nThe above is Cardan's view of the machinations of the statesmen in high\r\nplaces in the English Court during the last months of Edward's life.\r\nJudged by the subsequent action of Northumberland it is in the main\r\ncorrect; and, taking into consideration his associations and environment\r\nduring his stay in London, this view bears evident traces of independent\r\njudgment. Sir John Cheke, the King's former preceptor, and afterwards\r\nProfessor of Greek at Cambridge, had received him with all the courtesy\r\ndue to a fellow-scholar, and probably introduced him at Court. Cheke was a\r\nChamberlain of the Exchequer, and just about this time was appointed Clerk\r\nto the Privy Council, wherefore he must have been fully acquainted with\r\nthe aims and methods of the opposing factions about the Court. His\r\nfellow-clerk, Cecil, was openly opposed to Northumberland's designs, and\r\nprudently advanced a plea of ill health to excuse his absence from his\r\nduties: but Cheke at this time was an avowed partisan of the Duke, and of\r\nthe policy which professed to secure the ascendency of the anti-Papal\r\nparty. Cardan, living in daily intercourse with Cheke, might reasonably\r\nhave taken up the point of view of his kind and genial friend; but no,--he\r\nevidently rated Northumberland, from beginning to end, as a knave and a\r\ntraitor, and a murderer at least in will.\r\n\r\nWhen he quitted England in the autumn of 1552 Cardan did not shake himself\r\nentirely free from English associations. In an ill-starred moment he\r\ndetermined to take back to Italy with him an English boy.[159] He was\r\nwindbound for several days at Dover, and the man with whom he lodged seems\r\nto have offered to let him take his son, named William, aged twelve years,\r\nback to Italy. Cardan was pleased with the boy's manner and appearance,\r\nand at once consented; but the adventure proved a disastrous one. The boy\r\nand his new protector could not exchange a word, and only managed to make\r\neach other understand by signs, and that very imperfectly. The boy was\r\nresolute to go on while Cardan wanted to be rid of him; but his conscience\r\nwould not allow him to send him home unless he should, of his own free\r\nwill, ask to be sent, and by way of giving William a distaste for the life\r\nhe had chosen, he records that he often beat him cruelly on the slightest\r\npretext. But the boy was not to be shaken off. He persisted in following\r\nhis venture to the end, and arrived in Cardan's train at Milan, where he\r\nwas allowed to go his own way. The only care for his training Cardan took\r\nwas to have him taught music. He chides the unhappy boy for his\r\nindifference to learning and for his love of the company of other youths.\r\nWhat with his literary work and the family troubles which so soon fell\r\nupon him, Cardan's hands were certainly full; but, all allowance being\r\nmade, it is difficult to find a valid excuse for this neglect on his part.\r\nWilliam grew up to be a young man, and was finally apprenticed to a tailor\r\nat Pavia, but his knavish master set him to work as a vinedresser,\r\nsuspecting that Cardan cared little what happened so long as the young man\r\nwas kept out of his sight. William seems to have been a merry,\r\ngood-tempered fellow; but his life was a short one, for he took fever, and\r\ndied in his twenty-second year.[160]\r\n\r\nBesides chronicling this strange and somewhat pathetic incident, Cardan\r\nsets down in the _Dialogus de Morte_ his general impressions of the\r\nEnglish people. Alluding to the fear of death, he remarks that the\r\nEnglish, so far as he has observed, were scarcely at all affected by it,\r\nand he commends their wisdom, seeing that death is the last ill we have to\r\nsuffer, and is, moreover, inevitable. \"And if an Englishman views his own\r\ndeath with composure, he is even less disturbed over that of a friend or\r\nkinsman: he will look forward to re-union in a future state of\r\nimmortality. People like these, who stand up thus readily to face death\r\nand mourn not over their nearest ones, surely deserve sympathy, and this\r\nboy (William) was sprung from the same race. In stature the English\r\nresemble Italians, they are fairer in complexion, less ruddy, and broad in\r\nthe chest. There are some very tall men amongst them: they are gentle in\r\nmanner and friendly to travellers, but easily angered, and in this case\r\nare much to be dreaded. They are brave in battle, but wanting in caution;\r\ngreat eaters and drinkers, but in this respect the Germans exceed them,\r\nand they are prone rather than prompt to lust. Some amongst them are\r\ndistinguished in talent, and of these Scotus and Suisset[161] may be given\r\nas examples. They dress like Italians, and are always fain to declare that\r\nthey are more nearly allied to us than to any others, wherefore they try\r\nspecially to imitate us in habit and manners as closely as they can. They\r\nare trustworthy, freehanded, and ambitious; but in speaking of bravery,\r\nnothing can be more marvellous than the conduct of the Highland Scots,\r\nwho are wont to take with them, when they are led to execution, one\r\nplaying upon the pipes, who, as often as not, is condemned likewise, and\r\nthus he leads the train dancing to death.\" Like as the English were to\r\nItalians in other respects, Cardan was struck with the difference between\r\nthe two nations as soon as the islanders opened their mouths to speak. He\r\ncould not understand a single word, but stood amazed, deeming them to be\r\nItalians who had lost their wits. \"The tongue is curved upon the palate;\r\nthey turn about their words in the mouth, and make a hissing sound with\r\ntheir teeth.\" He then goes on to say that all the time of his absence his\r\nmind was full of thoughts of his own people in Italy, wherefore he sought\r\nleave to return at once.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[146] _Scotichronicon_, vol. i. p. 286 [ed. G. F. S. Gordon, Glasgow,\r\n1867]. Naudé, in his _Apologie pour les grands hommes soupçonnez_ de\r\nMagie, writes: \"Ceux qui recherchoiant les Mathématiques et les Sciences\r\nles moins communes étoient soupçonnez d'être enchanteurs et\r\nMagiciens.\"--p. 15.\r\n\r\n[147] \"Curam agebat Medicus ex constituto Medicorum Lutetianorum.\"--_De\r\nVita Propria_, ch. xl. p. 137.

Larrey in his _History of England_\r\nseems to have given currency to the legend that Cardan foretold the\r\nArchbishop's death. \"S'il en faut croire ce que l'Histoire nous dit de ce\r\nfameux Astrologe, il donna une terrible preuve de sa science à\r\nl'Archevêque qu'il avoit gueri, lorsque prenait congé de lire, il lui tint\r\nce discours: 'Qu'il avoit bien pu le guerir de sa maladie; mais qu'il\r\nn'étoit pas en son pouvoir de changer sa destinée, ni d'empêcher qu'il ne\r\nfût pendu.'\"--Larrey, _Hist. d'Angleterre_, vol. ii. p. 711.\r\n\r\n[153] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xxxii. p. 101.\r\n\r\n[154] \"Scotic[u=] nomen antea horruer[a=], eorum exemplo qui prius\r\ncoeperunt odisse quam cognoscere.

Of the boy himself he writes:\r\n\"hospes ostendit mihi filium nomine Guglielmum, ætatis annorum duodecim,\r\nprobum, scitulum, et parentibus obsequentem. Avus paternus nomine\r\nGregorius adhuc vivebat, et erat Ligur: pater Laurentius, familia nobili\r\nCataneorum.\"\r\n\r\n[160] _Opera_, tom. i. p. 119. Cardan here calls him \"Gulielmus _Lataneus_\r\nAnglus adolescens mihi charissimus.\" In the _De Morte_, however, he speaks\r\nof him as \"ex familia Cataneorum\" (see last page).\r\n\r\n[161] Cardan writes (_De Subtilitate_, p. 444) that Suisset [Richard\r\nSwineshead], who lived about 1350, was known as the Calculator; but\r\nKästner [_Gesch. der Math._ I. 50] maintains that the title Calculator\r\nshould be applied to the book rather than to the author, and hints that\r\nthis misapprehension on Cardan's part shows that he knew of Suisset only\r\nby hearsay. The title of the copy of Suisset in the British Museum stands\r\n\"Subtilissimi Doctoris Anglici Suiset. Calculationes Liber,\" Padue [1485].\r\nBrunet gives one, \"Opus aureum calculationum,\" Pavia, 1498.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nCARDAN travelled southward by way of the Low Countries. He stayed some\r\ndays at Antwerp, and during his visit he was pressed urgently to remain in\r\nthe city and practise his art. A less pleasant experience was a fall into\r\na ditch when he was coming out of a goldsmith's shop. He was cut and\r\nbruised about the left ear, but the damage was only skin-deep. He went on\r\nby Brussels and Cologne to Basel, where he once more tarried several days.\r\nHe had a narrow escape here of falling into danger, for, had he not been\r\nforewarned by Guglielmo Gratarolo, a friend, he would have taken up his\r\nquarters in a house infected by the plague. He was received as a guest by\r\nCarlo Affaidato, a learned astronomer and physicist, who, on the day of\r\ndeparture, made him accept a valuable mule, worth a hundred crowns.\r\nAnother generous offer of a similar kind was made to him shortly\r\nafterwards by a Genoese gentleman of the family of Ezzolino, who fell in\r\nwith him accidentally on the road. This was the gift of a very fine horse\r\n(of the sort which the English call Obinum), but, greatly as Cardan\r\ndesired to have the horse, his sense of propriety kept him back from\r\naccepting this gift.[162]\r\n\r\nHe went next to Besançon, where he was received by Franciscus Bonvalutus,\r\na scholar of some note, and then by Berne to Zurich. He must have crossed\r\nthe Alps by the Splugen Pass, as Chur is named in his itinerary, and he\r\nalso describes his voyage down the Lake of Como on the way to Milan, where\r\nhe arrived on January 3, 1553. Cardan was a famous physician when he set\r\nout on his northward journey; but now on his return he stood firmly placed\r\nby the events of the last few months at the head of his profession.\r\nWriting of the material results of his mission to Scotland, he declares\r\nthat he is ashamed to set down the terms upon which he was paid, so\r\nlavishly was he rewarded for his services. The offers made to him by so\r\nmany exalted personages to secure his permanent and exclusive attention\r\nwould indeed have turned the heads of most men. There was the offer from\r\nthe King of Denmark; another, in 1552, from the King of France at a salary\r\nof thirteen hundred crowns a year; and yet another made by the agents of\r\nCharles V., who was then engaged in his disastrous attack upon Metz. All\r\nof them he refused: he had no inclination to share the perils of the\r\nleaguer of Metz, and his sense of loyalty forbad him to join himself to\r\nthe power which was at that time warring against his sovereign. He speaks\r\nalso of another offer made to him by the Queen of Scotland of a generous\r\nsalary if he would settle in Scotland; but the country was too remote for\r\nhis taste. There is no authority for this offer except the _De Vita\r\nPropria_, and it is there set down in terms which render it somewhat\r\ndifficult to identify the Queen aforesaid.[163]\r\n\r\nAs soon as he entered Milan, Ferrante Gonzaga, the Governor, desired to\r\nsecure his services as physician to the Duke of Mantua, his brother,\r\noffering him thirty thousand gold crowns as honorarium; but, in spite of\r\nthe Governor's persuasions and threats, he would not accept the office.\r\nWhen the news had come to Paris that Cardan was about to quit Britain,\r\nforty of the most illustrious scientists of France repaired to Paris in\r\norder to hear him expound the art of Medicine; but the disturbed state of\r\nthe country deterred him from setting foot in France. He refers to a\r\nletter from his friend Ranconet as a testimony of the worship that was\r\npaid to him, and goes on to say that, in his journeying through France and\r\nGermany, he fared much as Plato fared at the Olympic games.\r\n\r\nIn a passage which Cardan wrote shortly after his return from Britain, he\r\nlets it be seen that he was not ill-satisfied with the figure he then made\r\nin the world. He writes--\"Therefore, since all those with whom I am\r\nintimate think well of me for my truth and probity, I can let my envious\r\nrivals indulge themselves as they list in the shameful habit of\r\nevil-speaking. With regard to folly, if I now utter, or ever have uttered,\r\nfoolish words, let those who accuse me show their evidence. I, who was\r\nborn poor, with a weakly body, in an age vexed almost incessantly by wars\r\nand tumults, helped on by no family influence, but forced to contend\r\nagainst the bitter opposition of the College at Milan, contrived to\r\novercome all the plots woven against me, and open violence as well. All\r\nthe honours which a physician can possess I either enjoy, or have refused\r\nwhen they were offered to me. I have raised the fortunes of my family, and\r\nhave lived a blameless life. I am well known to all men of worship, and to\r\nthe whole of Europe. What I have written has been lauded; in sooth, I\r\nhave written of so many things and at such length, that a man could\r\nscarcely read my works if he spent his life therewith. I have taken good\r\ncare of my domestic affairs, and by common consent I have come off victor\r\nin every contest I have tried. I have refused always to flatter the great;\r\nand over and beyond this I have often set myself in active opposition to\r\nthem. My name will be found scattered about the pages of many writers. I\r\nshall deem my life long enough if I come in perfect health to the age of\r\nfifty-six. I have been most fortunate as the discoverer of many and\r\nimportant contributions to knowledge, as well as in the practice of my art\r\nand in the results attained; so much so that if my fame in the first\r\ninstance has raised up envy against me, it has prevailed finally, and\r\nextinguished all ill-feeling.\"[164]\r\n\r\nThese words were written before the publication of the _Geniturarum\r\nExempla_ in 1554. Cardan's life for the six years which followed was busy\r\nand prosperous, but on the whole uneventful. The Archbishop of St. Andrews\r\nwrote to him according to promise at the end of two years to give an\r\naccount of the results of his treatment. His letter is worthy of remark as\r\nshowing that he, the person most interested, was well satisfied with\r\nCardan's skill as a physician. Michael, the Archbishop's chief\r\nchamberlain, was the bearer thereof, and as Hamilton speaks of him as\r\n\"epistolam vivam,\" it is probable that he bore likewise certain verbal\r\nmessages which could be more safely carried thus than in writing. A\r\nsentence in the _De Vita Propria_,[165] mixed up with the account of\r\nHamilton's cure, seems to refer to this embassy, and to suggest that\r\nMichael was authorized to promise Cardan a liberal salary if he would\r\naccept permanent office in the Primate's household. Moreover, Hamilton\r\nwrites somewhat querulously about Cassanate's absence abroad on a visit to\r\nhis family, a fact which would make him all the more eager to secure\r\nCardan's services. His letter runs as follows--\"Two of your most welcome\r\nletters, written some months ago, I received by the hand of an English\r\nmerchant; others came by the care of the Lord Bishop of Dunkeld, together\r\nwith the Indian balsam. The last were from Scoto, who sent at the same\r\ntime your most scholarly comments on that difficult work of Ptolemy.[166]\r\nTo all that you have written to me I have replied fully in three or four\r\nletters of my own, but I know not whether, out of all I have written, any\r\nletter of mine has reached you. But now I have directed that a servant of\r\nmine, who is known to you, and who is travelling to Rome, shall wait upon\r\nyou and salute you in my name, and bear to you my gratitude, not only for\r\nthe various gifts I have received from you, but likewise because my health\r\nis well-nigh restored, the ailment which vexed me is driven away, my\r\nstrength increased, and my life renewed. Wherefore I rate myself debtor\r\nfor all these benefits, as well as this very body of mine. For, from the\r\ntime when I began to take these medicines of yours, selected and\r\ncompounded with so great skill, my complaint has afflicted me less\r\nfrequently and severely; indeed, now, as a rule, I am not troubled\r\ntherewith more than once a month; sometimes I escape for two months.\"[167]\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1555) Cardan's daughter Chiara, who seems to have\r\nbeen a virtuous and well-conducted girl, was married to Bartolomeo Sacco,\r\na young Milanese gentleman of good family, a match which proved to be\r\nfortunate. Cardan had now reached that summit of fame against which the\r\nshafts of jealousy will always be directed. The literary manners of the\r\nage certainly lacked urbanity, and of all living controversialists there\r\nwas none more truculent than Julius Cæsar Scaliger, who had begun his\r\ncareer as a man of letters by a fierce assault upon Erasmus with regard to\r\nhis _Ciceronianus_, a leading case amongst the quarrels of authors.\r\nErasmus he had attacked for venturing to throw doubts upon the suitability\r\nof Cicero's Latin as a vehicle of modern thought; this quarrel was over a\r\nquestion of form; and now Scaliger went a step farther, and, albeit he\r\nknew little of the subject in hand, published a book of _Esoteric\r\nExercitations_ to show that the _De Subtilitate_ of Cardan was nothing but\r\na tissue of nonsense.[168] The book was written with all the heavy-handed\r\nbrutality he was accustomed to use, but it did no hurt to Cardan's\r\nreputation, and, irritable as he was by nature, it failed to provoke him\r\nto make an immediate rejoinder, a delay which was the cause of one of the\r\nmost diverting incidents in the whole range of literary warfare.\r\n\r\nScaliger sat in his study, eagerly expecting a reply, but Cardan took no\r\nnotice of the attack. Then one day some tale-bearer, moved either by the\r\nspirit of tittle-tattle or the love of mischief, brought to Julius Cæsar\r\nthe news that Jerome Cardan had sunk under his tremendous battery of\r\nabuse, and was dead. It is but bare charity to assume that Scaliger was\r\ntouched by some stings of regret when he heard what had been the fatal\r\nresult of his onslaught; still there can be little doubt that his mind was\r\nfilled with a certain satisfaction when he reflected that he was in sooth\r\na terrible assailant, and that his fist was heavier than any other man's.\r\nIn any case, he felt that it behoved him to make some sign, wherefore he\r\nsat down and penned a funeral oration over his supposed victim, which is\r\nworth giving at length.[169]\r\n\r\n\"At this season, when fate has dealt with me in a fashion so wretched and\r\nuntoward that it has connected my name with a cruel public calamity, when\r\na literary essay of mine, well known to the world, and undertaken at the\r\ncall of duty, has ensued in dire misfortune, it seems to me that I am\r\nbound to bequeath to posterity a testimony that, sharp as may have been\r\nthe vexation brought upon Jerome Cardan by my trifling censures, the grief\r\nwhich now afflicts me on account of his death is ten times sharper. For,\r\neven if Cardan living should have been a terror to me, I, who am but a\r\nsingle unit in the republic of letters, ought to have postponed my own and\r\nsingular convenience to the common good, seeing how excellent were the\r\nmerits of this man, in every sort of learning. For now the republic is\r\nbereft of a great and incomparable scholar, and must needs suffer a loss\r\nwhich, peradventure, none of the centuries to come will repair. What\r\nthough I am a person of small account, I could count upon him as a\r\nsupporter, a judge, and (immortal gods) even a laudator of my\r\nlucubrations; for he was so greatly impressed by their weighty merits,\r\nthat he deemed he would best defend himself by avoiding all comment on the\r\nsame, despairing of his own strength, and knowing not how great his powers\r\nreally were. In this respect he was so skilful a master, that he could\r\nassuredly have fathomed the depths of every method and every device used\r\nagainst him, and would thereby have made his castigation of myself to\r\nserve as an augmentation of his own fame. He, in sooth, was a man of such\r\nquality that, if he had deemed it a thing demanded of him by equity, he\r\nwould never have hesitated to point out to other students the truth of\r\nthose words which I had written against him as an accusation, while, on\r\nthe other hand, this same constancy of mind would have made him adhere to\r\nthe opinions he might have put forth in the first instance, so far as\r\nthese opinions were capable of proof. I, when I addressed my\r\n_Exercitations_ to him during his life--to him whom I knew by common\r\nreport to be the most ingenious and learned of mortal men--was in good\r\nhope that I might issue from this conflict a conqueror; and is there\r\nliving a man blind enough not to perceive that what I looked for was\r\nhard-earned credit, which I should certainly have won by finding my views\r\nconfirmed by Cardan living, and not for inglorious peace brought about by\r\nhis death? And indeed I might have been suffered to have share in the\r\nbounty and kindliness of this illustrious man, whom I have always heard\r\ndescribed as a shrewd antagonist and one full of confidence in his own\r\nhigh position, for it was an easy task to win from him the ordinary rights\r\nof friendship by any trifling letter, seeing that he was the most\r\ncourteous of mankind. It is scarcely likely that I, weary as I was, one\r\nwho in fighting had long been used to perils of all sorts, should thus\r\ncast aside my courage; that I, worn out by incessant controversies and\r\nconsumed by the daily wear and tear of writing, should care for an\r\ninglorious match with so distinguished an antagonist; or that I should\r\nhave set my heart upon winning a bare victory in the midst of all this\r\ndust and tumult. For not only was the result which has ensued unlooked for\r\nin the nature of things and in the opinion of all men qualified to judge\r\nin such a case; it was also the last thing I could have desired to happen,\r\nfor the sake of my good name. My judgment has ever been that all men (for\r\nin sooth all of us are, so to speak, little less than nothing) may so lose\r\ntheir heads in controversy that they may actually fight against their own\r\ninterests. And if such a mischance as this may happen to any man of\r\neminence--as has been my case, and the case of divers others I could\r\nrecall--it shall not be written down in the list of his errors, unless in\r\naftertimes he shall seek to justify the same. It is necessary to advance\r\nroughness in the place of refinement, and stubborn tenacity for\r\nsteadfastness. No man can be pronounced guilty of offence on the score of\r\nsome hasty word or other which may escape his lips; such a charge should\r\nrather be made when he defends himself by unworthy methods. Therefore if\r\nCardan during his life, being well advised in the matter, should have kept\r\nsilent over my attempts to correct him, what could have brought me greater\r\ncredit than this? He would have bowed to my opinion in seemly fashion, and\r\nwould have taken my censures as those of a father or a preceptor. But\r\nsupposing that he had ventured to engage in a sharper controversy with me\r\nover this question, is there any one living who would fail to see that he\r\nmight have gone near to lose his wits on account of the mental agitation\r\nwhich had afflicted him in the past? But as soon as his superhuman\r\nintellect had thoroughly grasped the question, it seemed to him that he\r\nmust needs be called upon to bear what was intolerable. He could not pluck\r\nup courage enough to bear it by living, so he bore it by dying. Moreover,\r\nwhat he might well have borne, he could not bring himself to bear, to wit\r\nthat he and I should come to an agreement and should formulate certain\r\nwell-balanced decisions for the common good. For this reason I lament\r\ndeeply my share in this affair, I who had most obvious reasons for\r\nengaging in this conflict, and the clearest ones for inventing a story as\r\nto the victory I hoped to gain; reasons which a man of sober temper could\r\nnever anticipate, which a brave man would never desire.\r\n\r\n\"Cardan's fame has its surest foundation in the praise of his adversaries.\r\nI lament greatly this misfortune of our republic: the causes of which the\r\nparliament of lettered men may estimate by its particular rules, but it\r\ncannot rate this calamity in relation to the excellences of this\r\nillustrious personality. For in a man of learning three properties ought\r\nto stand out pre-eminently--a spotless and gentle rule of life; manifold\r\nand varied learning; and consummate talent joined to the shrewdest\r\ncapacity for forming a judgment. These three points Cardan attained so\r\ncompletely that he seemed to have been made entirely for himself, and at\r\nthe same time to have been the only mortal made for mankind at large. No\r\none could be more courteous to his inferiors or more ready to discuss the\r\nscheme of the universe with any man of mark with whom he might chance to\r\nforegather. He was a man of kingly courtesy, of sympathetic loftiness of\r\nmind, one fitted for all places, for all occasions, for all men and for\r\nall fortunes. In reference to learning itself, I beg you to look around\r\nupon the accomplished circle of the learned now living on the earth, in\r\nthis most fortunate age of ours; here the combination of individual talent\r\nshows us a crowd of illustrious men, but each one of these displays\r\nhimself as occupied with some special portion of Philosophy. But Cardan,\r\nin addition to his profound knowledge of the secrets of God and Nature,\r\nwas a consummate master of the humaner letters, and was wont to expound\r\nthe same with such eloquence that those who listened to him would have\r\nbeen justified in affirming that he could have studied nothing else all\r\nhis life. A great man indeed! Great if he could lay claim to no other\r\nexcellence than this; and forsooth, when we come to consider the quickness\r\nof his wit, his fiery energy in everything he undertook, whether of the\r\nleast or the greatest moment, his laborious diligence and unconquerable\r\nsteadfastness, I affirm that the man who shall venture to compare himself\r\nwith Cardan may well be regarded as one lacking in all due modesty. I\r\nforsooth feel no hostility towards one whose path never crossed mine, nor\r\nenvy of one whose shadow never touched mine; the numerous and weighty\r\nquestions dealt with in his monumental work urged me on to undertake the\r\ntask of gaining some knowledge of the same. After the completion of the\r\nCommentaries on Subtlety, he published as a kind of appendix to these that\r\nmost learned work the _De Rerum Varietate_. And in this case, before news\r\nwas brought to me of his death, I followed my customary practice, and in\r\nthe course of three days compiled an Excursus in short chapters. When I\r\nheard that he was dead I brought them together into one little book, in\r\norder that I also might lend a hand in this great work of his, and this\r\nthing I did after a fashion which he himself would have approved,\r\nsupposing that at some time or other he might have held discourse with me,\r\nor with some other yet more learned man, concerning his affairs.\"[170]\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of regret that this cry of _peccavi_ was not published till\r\nall the chief literary contemporaries of Scaliger were in their graves. As\r\nit did not appear till 1621, the men of his own time were not able to\r\nenjoy the shout of laughter over his discomfiture which would surely have\r\ngone up from Paris and Strasburg and Basel and Zurich. Estienne and\r\nGessner would hardly have felt acute sorrow at a flout put upon Julius\r\nCæsar Scaliger. Crooked-tempered as he was, Cardan, compared with\r\nScaliger, was as a rose to a thistle, but there were reasons altogether\r\nunconnected with the personalities of the disputants which swayed the\r\nbalance to Cardan's advantage. The greater part of Scaliger's criticism\r\nwas worthless, and the opinion of learned Europe weighed overwhelmingly on\r\nCardan's side. Thuanus,[171] who assuredly did not love him, and Naudé,\r\nwho positively disliked him, subsequently gave testimony in his favour. He\r\ndid not follow the example of Erasmus, and let Scaliger's abuse go by in\r\nsilence, but he took the next wisest course. He published a short and\r\ndignified reply, _Actio prima in Calumniatorem_, in which, from\r\ntitle-page to colophon, Scaliger's name never once occurs. The gist of\r\nthe book may best be understood by quoting an extract from the criticism\r\nof Cardan by Naudé prefixed to the _De Vita Propria_. He writes: \"This\r\nproposition of mine will best be comprehended by the man who shall set to\r\nwork to compare Cardan with Julius Cæsar Scaliger, his rival, and a man\r\nendowed with an intellect almost superhuman. For Scaliger, although he\r\ncame upon the stage with greater pomp and display, and brought with him a\r\nmind filled with daring speculation, and adequate to the highest flights,\r\nkept closely behind the lattices of the humaner letters and of medical\r\nphilosophy, leaving to Cardan full liberty to occupy whatever ground of\r\nargument he might find most advantageous in any other of the fields of\r\nlearning. Moreover, if any one shall give daily study to these celebrated\r\n_Exercitations_, he will find therein nothing to show that Cardan is\r\nbranded by any mark of shame which may not be removed with the slightest\r\ntrouble, if the task be undertaken in a spirit of justice. For, in the\r\nfirst place, who can maintain that Scaliger was justified in publishing\r\nhis _Exercitations_ three years after the issue of the second edition of\r\nthe _Libri de Subtilitate_, without ever having taken the trouble to read\r\nthis edition, and without exempting from censure the errors which Cardan\r\nhad diligently expunged from his book in the course of his latest\r\nrevision, lest he (Scaliger) should find that all the mighty labour\r\nexpended over his criticisms had been spent in vain? Besides, who does not\r\nknow that Cardan, in his _Actio prima in Calumniatorem_, blunted the point\r\nof all his assailant's weapons, swept away all his objections, and broke\r\nin pieces all his accusations, in such wise that the very reason of their\r\nexistence ceased to be? Cardan, in sooth, was a true man, and held all\r\nhumanity as akin to him. There is small reason why we should marvel that\r\nhe erred now and again; it is a marvel much greater that he should only\r\nhave gone astray so seldom and in things of such trifling moment. Indeed I\r\nwill dare to affirm, and back my opinion with a pledge, that the errors\r\nwhich Scaliger left behind him in these _Exercitations_ were more in\r\nnumber than those which he so wantonly laid to Cardan's charge, having\r\nsweated nine years over the task. And this he did not so much in the\r\ninterests of true erudition as with the desire of coming to blows with all\r\nthose whom he recognized as the chiefs of learning.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the whole dispute Cardan kept his temper admirably. Scaliger was a\r\nphysician of repute; and it is not improbable that the spectacle of\r\nCardan's triumphal progress back to Milan from the North may have aroused\r\nhis jealousy and stimulated him to make his ill-judged attack. But even on\r\nthe ground of medical science he was no match for Cardan, while in\r\nmathematics and philosophy he was immeasurably inferior. Cardan felt\r\nprobably that the attack was nothing more than the buzzing of a gadfly,\r\nand that in any case it would make for his own advantage and credit,\r\nwherefore he saw no reason why he should disquiet himself; indeed his\r\nattitude of dignified indifference was admirably calculated to win for him\r\nthe approval of the learned world by the contrast it furnished to the\r\nraging fury of his adversary.[172]\r\n\r\nAfter the heavy labour of editing and issuing to the world the _De Rerum\r\nVarietate_, and of re-editing the first issue of the _De Subtilitate_,\r\nCardan might well have given himself a term of rest, but to a man of his\r\ntemper, idleness, or even a relaxation of the strain, is usually irksome.\r\nThe _De Varietate_ was first printed at Basel in 1553, and, as soon as it\r\nwas out of the press, it brought a trouble--not indeed a very serious\r\none--upon the author. The printer, Petrus of Basel (who must not be\r\nconfused with Petreius of Nuremberg) took it upon him to add to Chapter\r\nLXXX of the work some disparaging remarks about the Dominican\r\nbrotherhoods, making Cardan responsible for the assertion that they were\r\nrapacious wolves who hunted down reputed witches and despisers of God, not\r\nbecause of their offences, but because they chanced to be the possessors\r\nof much wealth. Cardan remonstrated at once--he always made it his\r\npractice to keep free from all theological wrangling,--but Petrus treated\r\nthe whole question with ridicule,[173] and it does not seem that Cardan\r\ncould have had any very strong feeling in the matter, for the obnoxious\r\npassage is retained in the editions of 1556 and 1557. The religious\r\nauthorities were however fully justified in assuming that the presence of\r\nsuch a passage in the pages of a book so widely popular as the _De\r\nVarietate_ would necessarily prove a cause of scandal, and give cause to\r\nthe enemy to blaspheme. For Reginald Scot, in the eighth chapter of\r\n_Discoverie of Witchcraft_, alludes to the passage in question in the\r\nfollowing terms: \"Cardanus writeth that the cause of such credulitie\r\nconsisteth in three points: to wit in the imagination of the melancholike,\r\nin the constancie of them that are corrupt therewith, and in the deceipt\r\nof the Judges; who being inquisitors themselves against heretikes and\r\nwitches, did both accuse and condemne them, having for their labour the\r\nspoile of their goods. So as these inquisitors added many fables hereunto,\r\nleast they should seeme to have doone injurie to the poore wretches, in\r\ncondemning and executing them for none offense. But sithens (said he) the\r\nspringing up of Luther's sect, these priests have tended more diligentlie\r\nupon the execution of them; bicause more wealth is to be caught from them;\r\ninsomuch as now they deale so looselie with witches (through distrust of\r\ngaines) that all is seene to be malice, follie, or avarice that hath beene\r\npractised against them. And whosoever shall search into this cause, or\r\nread the cheefe writers hereupon, shall find his words true.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1554 Cardan published also with Petrus of Basel the _Ptolemæi de\r\nastrorum judiciis_ with the _Geniturarum Exempla_, bound in one volume,\r\nbut he seems to have written nothing but a book of fables for the young,\r\nconcerning which he subsequently remarks that, in his opinion, grown men\r\nmight read the same with advantage. It is a matter of regret that this\r\nwork should have disappeared, for it would have been interesting to note\r\nhow far Cardan's intellect, acute and many-sided as it was, was capable of\r\ndealing with the literature of allegory and imagination. He has set down\r\none fact concerning it, to wit that it contained \"multa de futuris\r\narcana.\" The next year he produced only a few medical trifles, but in 1557\r\nhe brought out two other scientific works which he characterizes as\r\nadmirable--one the _Ars parva curandi_, and the other a treatise _De\r\nUrinis_. In the same year he published the book which, in forming a\r\njudgment of him as a man and a writer, is perhaps as valuable as the _De\r\nVita Propria_ and the _De Utilitate_, to wit the _De Libriis Propriis_.\r\nThis work exists in three forms: the first, a short treatise, \"cui titulus\r\nest ephemerus,\" is dedicated to \"Hieronymum Cardanum medicum, affinem\r\nsuum,\" and has the date of 1543. The second has the date of 1554, and,\r\naccording to Naudé, was first published \"apud Gulielmum Rovillium sub\r\nscuto Veneto, Lugduni, 1557.\" The third was begun in 1560,[174] and\r\ncontains comments written in subsequent years. The first is of slight\r\ninterest, the second is a sort of register of his works, amplified from\r\nyear to year, while the third has more the form of a treatise, and\r\npresents with some degree of symmetry the crude materials contained in the\r\nfirst. Having finished with his writings up to the year 1564, Cardan\r\nlapses into a philosophizing strain, and opens his discourse with the\r\nominous words, \"Sed jam ad institutum revertamur, déque ipso vitæ humanæ\r\ngenere aliquo dicamus.\" He begins with a disquisition on the worthlessness\r\nof life, and repeats somewhat tediously the story of his visit to\r\nScotland. He gives a synopsis of all the sciences he had ever\r\nstudied--Theology, Dialectics, Arithmetic, Music, Optics, Astronomy,\r\nAstrology, Geometry, Chiromancy, Agriculture, Medicine, passing on to\r\ntreat of Magic, portents and warnings, and of his own experience of the\r\nsame at the crucial moments of his life. He ends by a reference to an\r\nincident already chronicled in the _De Vita Propria_,[175] how he escaped\r\ndeath or injury from a falling mass of masonry by crossing the street in\r\nobedience to an impulse he could not explain, and speculates why God, who\r\nwas able to save him on this occasion with so little trouble, should have\r\nlet him rush on and court the overwhelming stroke which ultimately laid\r\nhim low.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[162] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xxxii. p. 100.\r\n\r\n[163] _De Vita Propria_, ch. iv. p. 16: \"cum Scotorum Regina cujus levirum\r\ncuraveram.\" Cardan had probably prescribed for a brother of the Duc de\r\nLongueville, the first husband of Mary of Guise, during his sojourn in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n[164] _Geniturarum Exempla_, p. 459.\r\n\r\n[165] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xl. p. 137.\r\n\r\n[166] _Commentaria in Ptolemæi de Astrorum Judiciis_ (Basil, 1554). He\r\nwrote these notes while going down the Loire in company with Cassanate on\r\nhis way from Lyons to Paris in 1552.--_De Vita Propria_, ch. xlv. p. 175.\r\n\r\nHe gives an interesting account (_Opera_, tom. i. p. 110) as to how the\r\nbook first came under his notice. The day before he quitted Lyons with\r\nCassanate, a school-master came to ask for advice, which Cardan gave\r\ngratis. Then the patient, knowing perhaps the physician's taste for the\r\nmarvellous, related how there was a certain boy in the place who could see\r\nspirits by looking into an earthen vessel, but Cardan was little impressed\r\nby what he saw, and began to talk with the school-master about Archimedes.\r\nThe school-master brought out a work of the Greek philosopher with which\r\nwas bound up the _Ptolemæi Libri de Judiciis_. Cardan fastened upon it at\r\nonce, and wanted to buy it, but the school-master insisted that he should\r\ntake it as a gift. He declares that his Commentaries thereupon are the\r\nmost perfect of all his writings. The book contains his famous Nativity of\r\nChrist. A remark in _De Libris Propriis_ (cf. _Opera_, tom. i. p. 67)\r\nindicates that there was an earlier edition of Ptolemy, printed at Milan\r\nat Cardan's own cost, because when he saw the numerous mistakes made by\r\nOttaviano Scoto in printing the _De Malo Medendi_ and the _De\r\nConsolatione_, he determined to go to another printer.\r\n\r\n[167] _Opera_, tom. i. p. 93.\r\n\r\n[168] Cardan notices the attack in these words--\"His diebus quidam\r\nconscripserat adversus nostrum de Subtilitate librum, Opus ingens.\r\nAdversus quem ego Apologiam scripsi.\"--_Opera_, tom. i. p. 117. Scaliger\r\nabsurdly calls his work the _fifteenth_ book of _Exercitations_, and\r\nwished the world to believe that he had written, though not printed, the\r\nfourteen others.\r\n\r\n[169] It was not printed until many years after the deaths of both\r\ndisputants, and appeared for the first time in a volume of Scaliger's\r\nletters and speeches published at Toulouse in 1621, and it was afterwards\r\naffixed to the _De Vita Propria_.\r\n\r\n[170] \"Si Scaliger avoit eu un peu moins de démangeaison de contre dire,\r\nil auroit acquis plus de gloire, qu'il n'a fait dans ce combat: mais, ce\r\nque les Grecs ont apellé [Greek: ametria tês antholkês], une passion\r\nexcessive de prendre le contrepied des autres, a fait grand tort à\r\nScaliger. C'est par ce principe qu'il a soutenu que le perroquet est une\r\ntrès laide bête. Si Cardan l'eût dit, Scaliger lui eût opposé ce qu'on\r\ntrouve dans les anciens Poètes touchant la beauté de cet oiseau. Vossius a\r\nfait une Critique très judicieuse de cette humeur contrariante de\r\nScaliger, et a marqué en même temps en quoi ces deux Antagonistes étoient\r\nsupérieurs et inférieures, l'un à l'autre.\"--(Scaliger, in _Exercitat.,_\r\n246.) \"Quia Cardanus psittacum commendarat a colorum varietate ac præterea\r\nfulgore, quod et Appuleius facit in secundo Floridorum, contra contendit\r\nesse deformem, non modo ob foeditatem rostri, ac crurum, et linguæ, sed\r\netiam quia sit coloris fusci ac cinericii, qui tristis. Quid faciamus\r\nsummo Viro? Si Cardanus ea dixisset, provocasset ad judicia poëtarum,\r\natque adeo omnium hominum. Nunc quia pulchri dixit coloris, ille deformis\r\ncontendit. Hoc contradictionis studium, quod ubique in hisce\r\nexercitationibus se prodit, sophista dignius est, quamque\r\nphilosopho.\"--Bayle: Article \"Cardan.\" (Sir Thomas Browne, in one of his\r\nCommonplace Books, observes--\"If Cardan saith a parrot is a beautiful\r\nbird, Scaliger will set his wits on work to prove it a deformed animal.\")\r\n\r\nNaudé (_Apologie_, ch. xiii.) says that of the great men of modern times\r\nScaliger and Cardan each claimed the possession of a guardian spirit, and\r\nhints that Scaliger may have been moved to make this claim in order not to\r\nbe outdone by his great antagonist. It should, however, be remembered that\r\nCardan did not seriously assert this belief till long after his\r\ncontroversy with Scaliger. Naudé sums up thus: \"D'où l'on peut juger\r\nasseurement, que lui et Scaliger n'ont point eu d'autre Genie que la\r\ngrande doctrine qu'ils s'étoient acquis par leurs veilles, par leurs\r\ntravaux, et par l'expérience qu'ils avoient des choses sur lesquelles\r\nvenant à élever leur jugement ils jugeoint pertinemment de toutes\r\nmatières, et ne laissoient rien échapper qui ne leur fust conneu et\r\nmanifeste.\"\r\n\r\n[171] Thuanus, ad Annum MDLXXVI, part of the Appendix to the _De Vita\r\nPropria_.\r\n\r\n[172] Cardan does not seem to have harboured animosity against Scaliger.\r\nIn the _De Vita Propria_, ch. xlviii. p. 198, he writes: \"Julius Cæsar\r\nScaliger plures mihi titulos ascribit, quam ego mihi concedi postulassem,\r\nappellans _ingenium profundissimum, felicissimum, et incomparabile_.\"\r\n\r\n[173] \"Quid tua interest quod quatuor verba adjecerim? an hoc tantum\r\ncrimen est! quid facerem absens absenti?\" Cardan writes on in meditative\r\nstrain: \"Coeterum cum non ignorem maculatos fuisse codices B. Hieronimi,\r\natque aliorum patrum nostrorum, ab his qui aliter sentiebant, erroremque\r\nsuum auctoritate viri tegere voluerunt: ut ne quis in nostris operibus\r\nhallucinetur vel ab aliis decipiatur, sciant omnes me nullibi Theologum\r\nagere, nec velle in alienam messem falcem ponere.\"--_Opera_, tom. i. p.\r\n112.\r\n\r\nJohannes Wierus, one of the first rationalists on the subject of\r\nwitchcraft, has quoted largely from Chapter LXXX of _De Varietate_ in his\r\nbook _De Præstigiis Dæmonum_, in urging his case against the orthodox\r\nview.\r\n\r\n[174] _Opera_, tom. i. p. 96. \"Annus hic est Salutis millesimus\r\nquingentesimus ac sexagesimus.\"\r\n\r\n[175] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xxx. p. 78.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE year 1555 may be held to mark the point of time at which Cardan\r\nreached the highest point of his fortunes. After a long and bitter\r\nstruggle with an adverse world he had come out a conqueror, and his rise\r\nto fame and opulence, if somewhat slow, had been steady and secure. He\r\nlonged for wealth, not that he might figure as a rich man, but so that he\r\nmight win the golden independence which permits a student to prosecute the\r\ntask which seems to subserve the highest purposes of true learning, and\r\nfrees him from the irksome battle for daily bread. He loved, indeed, to\r\nspend money over beautiful things, and there are few more attractive\r\ntouches in the picture he draws of himself than the confession of his\r\npassion for costly penholders, gems, rare books, vessels of brass and\r\nsilver, and painted spheres.[176] In this brief season of ease and\r\nsecurity, there were no flaming portents in the sky to foretell the cruel\r\nstroke of evil fortune which was destined so soon to fall upon him.\r\n\r\nCardan has left a very pathetic sketch of his own miserable boyhood in the\r\nstrangely ordered home in Milan, with his callous, tyrannical father, his\r\nquick-tempered mother, and the superadded torment of his Aunt Margaret's\r\npresence. Fazio Cardano was a man of rigorous sobriety, and he seems\r\nmoreover to have atoned for his early irregularities by the practice of\r\nthat austere piety which Jerome notices more than once as a characteristic\r\nof his old age.[177] The discipline was hard, and the life unlovely, but\r\nthe home was at least decent and orderly, and no opportunities or\r\nprovocations to loose manners or ill doing existed therein. In Cardan's\r\nown case it is to be feared that, after Lucia's death, the affairs of his\r\nhousehold fell into dire confusion, in spite of the presence of his\r\nmother-in-law, Thadea, who had come to him as housekeeper--her husband,\r\nAltobello, having died soon after the marriage of his daughter with\r\nCardan. He was an ardent lover of music, and, as a consequence, his house\r\nwould be constantly filled with singing men and boys, a tribe of somewhat\r\nsinister reputation.[178] Then, when he was not engaged with music, he\r\nwould be gambling in some fashion or other. After lamenting the vast\r\namount of time he has wasted over the game of chess, he goes on: \"But the\r\nplay with the dice, an evil far more noxious, found its way into my house;\r\nand, after my sons had learned to play the same, my doors always stood\r\nopen to dicers. I can find no excuse for this practice except the trivial\r\none, that, what I did, I did in the hope of relieving the poverty of my\r\nchildren.\"[179] In a home of this sort, ruled by a father who was\r\nassuredly more careful of his work in the study and class-room than of his\r\nduties as paterfamilias, it is not wonderful that the two young men, Gian\r\nBattista and Aldo, should grow up into worthless profligates. It has been\r\nrecorded how Cardan, during a journey to Genoa, wrote a Book of Precepts\r\nfor his children,[180] a task the memory of which afterwards wrung from\r\nhim a cry of despair. There never was compiled a more admirable collection\r\nof maxims; but, excellent as they were, it was not enough to write them\r\ndown on paper; and the young men, if ever they took the trouble to read\r\nthem, must have smiled as they called to mind the difference between their\r\nfather's practices and the precepts he had composed for their guidance.\r\nFurthermore, he had written at length, in the _De Consolatione_, on the\r\nfolly which parents for the most part display in the education of their\r\nchildren. \"They show their affection in such foolish wise, that it would\r\nbe nearer the mark to say they hate, rather than love, their offspring.\r\nThey bring them up not to follow virtue, but to occupy themselves with all\r\nmanner of hurtful things; not to learning, but to riot; not to the worship\r\nof God, but to foster in them the desire to drain the cup of lustful\r\npleasure; not for the life eternal, but to the enticements of\r\nlechery.\"[181]\r\n\r\nAt this time Gian Battista had gained the doctorate of medicine at Pavia,\r\nand had made his contribution to medical knowledge by the publication of\r\nan insignificant tract, _De cibis foetidis non edendis_. Cardan was\r\nevidently full of hope for his elder son's career, but Aldo seems to have\r\nbeen a trouble from the first. Yet, in casting Aldo's horoscope (probably\r\nat the time of his birth) Cardan predicts for him a flourishing\r\nfuture.[182] Never was there made a worse essay in prophecy. Aldo's\r\nchildhood had been a sickly one. He had well-nigh died of convulsions, and\r\nlater on he had been troubled with dysentery, abscesses of the brain, and\r\na fever which lasted six months. Moreover, he could not walk till he was\r\nthree years old. With a weakly body, his nature seems to have put forth\r\nall sorts of untoward growths. There is a story which Naudé brings forward\r\nas part of his indictment against Cardan, that the father being irritated\r\nbeyond endurance by some ill conduct of his younger son during supper, cut\r\noff his ear by way of punishment. It was a most barbarous act; one going\r\nfar beyond the range of any tradition of the early _patria potestas_,\r\nwhich may have yet lingered in Italy; and scarcely calculated to bring\r\nabout reformation in the youth thus punished. In any case, Aldo went on\r\nfrom bad to worse; at one time his father found it necessary to place him\r\nunder restraint, and the last record of him is that one in Cardan's\r\ntestament, by which he was disinherited.\r\n\r\nGian Battista's failings were doubtless grave and numerous, but he had at\r\nleast sufficient industry to qualify himself as a physician. He was\r\ncertainly his father's favourite child, and on this account the eulogies\r\nwritten of him in those dark hours when Cardan's reason was reeling under\r\nthe accumulated blows of private grief and public disgrace, must be\r\naccepted with caution. There is no evidence to show he was in intellect\r\nanything like the budding genius his father deemed him; as to conduct and\r\nmanner of life, his carriage was exactly what the majority of youths,\r\nbrought up in a similar fashion, would have adopted. There must have been\r\nsomething in the young man's humours which from the first made his father\r\napprehensive as to the future, for Cardan soon came to see that an early\r\nmarriage would be the surest safeguard for Gian Battista's future. With\r\nhis mind bent on this scheme, he pointed out to his son various damsels of\r\nsuitable station, any one of whom he would be ready to welcome into his\r\nfamily, but Gian Battista always found some excuse for declining\r\nmatrimony. He declared that he was too closely engaged with his work; and,\r\nover and beyond this, it would not be seemly to bring home a bride into a\r\nhouse like their own, full of young men, for Cardan, as usual, had several\r\npupils living with him. It was at the end of 1557 that the first\r\nforebodings of misfortune appeared. To Cardan, according to custom, they\r\ncame in the form of a portent, for he records how he lay awake at midnight\r\non December 20, and was suddenly conscious that his bed was shaking. He at\r\nonce attributed this to a shock of an earthquake, and in the morning he\r\ndemanded of the servant, Simone Sosia, who occupied the truckle bed in the\r\nroom, whether he had felt the same. Simone replied that he had, whereupon\r\nCardan, as soon as he arose, went to the piazza and asked of divers\r\npersons he met there, whether they had also been disturbed, but no one had\r\nfelt anything of the shock he alluded to. He went home, and while the\r\nfamily were at table, a messenger, sent, as he afterwards records, by a\r\ncertain woman of the town,[183] entered the room, and told him that his\r\nson was going to be married immediately after breakfast. Cardan asked who\r\nthe bride might be, but the messenger said he knew not, and departed. It\r\nis not quite clear whether Gian Battista was present or not, but as soon\r\nas ever the messenger had departed, Cardan let loose an indignant outburst\r\nover his son's misconduct, reproaching him with undutiful secresy, and\r\nsetting forth how he had introduced to him four young ladies of good\r\nfamily, of whom two were certainly enamoured of him. Any one of the four\r\nwould have been acceptable as a daughter-in-law, but he declared that now\r\nhe would insist upon having full information as to the antecedents of any\r\nother bride his son might have selected, before admitting her to the\r\nshelter of his roof. Over and over again had he counselled Gian Battista\r\nthat he must on no account marry in haste, or without his advice, or\r\nwithout making sure that his income would be sufficient to support the\r\nresponsibilities of the married state; rather than this should happen, he\r\nwould willingly allow the young man to keep a mistress in the house for\r\nthe sake of offspring, for he desired beyond all else to rear\r\ngrandchildren from Gian Battista, because he nursed the belief that, as\r\nthe son resembled his grandfather Fazio, so the son's children would\r\nresemble their grandfather--himself. When he was questioned, Gian Battista\r\ndeclared he knew nothing about the report, and was fully as astonished as\r\nhis father; but two days later Gian Battista's own servant came to the\r\nhouse, and announced that his master had been married that same\r\nmorning,[184] but that he knew not the name of the bride. Cardan now\r\nascertained that Gian Battista's disinclination for matrimony had arisen\r\nfrom the fact that he had been amusing himself with a girl who was nothing\r\nelse than an attractive and finely-dressed harlot, named Brandonia Seroni,\r\nthe last woman in all Milan whom he could with decency receive into his\r\nhouse. And the pitiful story was not yet complete. In marrying her the\r\nfoolish youth had burdened himself with her mother, two or more sisters,\r\nand three brothers, the last-named being rough fellows without any calling\r\nbut that of common soldiers. The character of the girl herself may be\r\njudged by the answer given by her father Evangelista Seroni to Cardan\r\nduring the subsequent trial. When Seroni was asked whether he had given\r\nhis daughter as a virgin in marriage, he answered frankly in the negative.\r\n\r\nCardan at once made up his mind to shut his door upon the newly-married\r\npair; but the unconquerable tenderness he felt for Gian Battista urged him\r\non to send to the young man all the ready money he had saved. After two\r\nyears of married life, two children, a boy and a girl, were born: husband\r\nand wife alike were in ill health, and every day brought its domestic\r\nquarrel. In the meantime sinister whispers were heard, set going in the\r\nfirst instance by the mother and sister of Brandonia, that Gian Battista\r\nwas the father neither of the first nor of the second child. They even\r\nwent so far as to designate the men to whom they rightly belonged, and\r\ncontrived that this rumour should come to the ears of the injured husband.\r\nThe consequence of their malignant tale-bearing was a quarrel more violent\r\nthan ever, and the rise of a resolution in Gian Battista's mind to rid\r\nhimself at all hazard of the accursed burden he had bound upon his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nUntil the end of 1559 Cardan continued to live in Milan, vexed no doubt by\r\nthe ever-present spectacle of the wretched case into which his beloved son\r\nhad fallen. He records how the young wife, unknown to her husband, handed\r\nover to her father the wedding-ring which he (Cardan) had given to his\r\nson, along with a piece of silken stuff, in order to pledge them for\r\nmoney. This outrage, joined to the certain conviction that his wife was\r\nfalse to him, proved a provocation beyond the limits of Gian Battista's\r\npatience, and finally incited him to make a criminal attempt upon\r\nBrandonia's life. Hitherto he had been earnest enough in his desire to rid\r\nhimself of his wife so long as she raged against him; but, on the\r\nrestoration of peace, his anger against her would vanish. Now he had lost\r\nall patience; he laid his plans advisedly, and set to work to execute them\r\nby enlisting the cooperation of the servant who had been with him ever\r\nsince his marriage, and by taking to live with him in his own house\r\nSeroni, his wife, and son and daughter.[185] It cannot be said that the\r\nwould-be murderer displayed at this juncture any of the traditional\r\nItalian craft in setting about his deadly task. The day before the attempt\r\nwas made he took out of pawn the goods which Evangelista Seroni had\r\npledged, and promised his servant a gift of clothes and money if he would\r\ncompass the death of Brandonia, who was still ailing from the effects of\r\nher second confinement. To this suggestion the servant, who had also\r\nwarned Gian Battista of his wife's misconduct, at once assented.\r\n\r\nBut even on the very day when he had fully determined to make his essay in\r\nmurder he vacillated again and again, and it seemed likely that Brandonia\r\nwould once more be reprieved. When he entered her bed-chamber, full of his\r\nresolve to strike for freedom, he found her lying gravely ill with an\r\nattack of fever, shivering violently, and cold at the extremities. His\r\nanger forthwith vanished, and his hand was stayed; but as if urged on by\r\nruthless fate, the mother-in-law, and the sister, and Brandonia herself,\r\nill as she was, attacked Gian Battista with the foulest abuse and\r\nreproaches; this was the last straw. He went out and sought his servant,\r\nand told the fellow at once to make a cake and put a poison therein. The\r\ndate of this fatal action was some day early in 1560.\r\n\r\nOn October 1, 1559, Cardan had left Milan, and gone back to Pavia to\r\nresume his work as professor, taking Aldo with him. He threw himself into\r\nthe discharge of his office and the life of the city with his customary\r\nardour. Over and above his work of teaching he completed his treatise _De\r\nSecretis_, and likewise found time to hold a long disputation on the\r\ndecisions of Galen with Andrea Camutio, one of the most illustrious\r\nphysicians of the age. Concerning this episode he writes: \"In disputation\r\nI showed myself so keen of wit that all men marvelled at the instances I\r\nbrought forward, but for a long time no one ventured to put me to the\r\nproof. Thus I escaped the trouble of any such undertaking until two\r\naccidents both unforeseen involved me therein. At Pavia, Branda Porro, my\r\nwhilom teacher in Philosophy, interrupted me one day when I was disputing\r\nwith Camutio[186] on some matter of Philosophy, for, as I have said\r\nbefore, my colleagues were wont to lead me on to argue in philosophy\r\nbecause they were well assured that it would be vain to try to get the\r\nbetter of me in Medicine. Now Branda began by advancing Aristotle as an\r\nauthority, whereupon I, when he brought out his citation, said, 'Take\r\ncare, you have left out the \"_non_\" which should stand after \"_album_.\"'\r\nThen Branda contradicted me, and I, spitting out the phlegm with which I\r\nam often troubled, told him quietly that he was in the wrong. He sent for\r\nthe Codex in great rage, and when it was brought I asked that it might be\r\ngiven to me. I then read out the words just as they stood; but he, as if\r\nhe suspected that I was reading falsely, snatched the volume out of my\r\nhands, and declared that I was puting a cheat upon my hearers. When he\r\ncame to the word in dispute he held his tongue forthwith, and all the\r\nothers looked at me in amazement.\"[187]\r\n\r\nIt is certain that Cardan was still vexed in mind by the trouble he had\r\nleft behind him at Milan. If he had not forgiven Gian Battista, he was\r\nfull of kindly thought of him. He sent him from Pavia a new silk cloak,\r\nsuch as physicians wear, so that he might make a better show in his\r\ncalling, and doubtless continued his supplies of money. Just a week before\r\nthe quarrel last recorded, Aldo, against his father's wish, left Pavia and\r\nreturned to Milan. Cardan used every argument he could bring forward to\r\nkeep his younger son with him, but in vain; and, as he was unwilling to\r\nput constraint upon him, Aldo departed. Cardan says that he was within an\r\nace of going with him, for the University was then in vacation: then the\r\ncrowning catastrophe might have been averted, but the same fate which was\r\ndriving on the son to destruction, kept the father at Pavia. Thus it\r\nhappened that Aldo was an inmate of his brother's house when the poisoned\r\ncake was made. Cardan has written down a detailed account of the\r\nperpetration of this squalid tragedy, and no clearer presentation can be\r\ngiven than the one which his own words supply.\r\n\r\nHe writes: \"Thus my son and the servant went together to make the cake,\r\nand the servant put therein secretly some of the poison which had been\r\ngiven him. After the cake had been made, a small piece was given to my\r\nson's wife, who was very ill at the time, but her stomach rejected it at\r\nonce. Her mother ate some of it, and likewise vomited after taking it.\r\nThough Gian Battista saw what happened he did not believe that the cake\r\nwas really poisoned, for two reasons. First, because he had not, in truth,\r\nordered that the poison should be mixed therewith; and second, because his\r\nbrother-in-law (Bartolomeo Sacco) had said to him, before the cake was\r\nfinished, 'See that you make it big enough, for I also am minded to taste\r\nit.' Next he gave some to his father-in-law, who straightway vomited, and\r\ncomplained of a pricking of the tongue. He warned my son; but he, still\r\nholding that the cake was harmless, ate thereof somewhat greedily; and,\r\nafter having been sick, had to lie by for some time. On the second day\r\nafter this Gian Battista, and his brother, and the servant as well were\r\ntaken in hold: and on the Sunday following I, having been informed of what\r\nhad happened, went to Milan in great anxiety as to what I should do.\"\r\n\r\nThe news which had been brought to Cardan at Pavia told him, over and\r\nbeyond what is written above, that his son's wife was dead, poisoned as\r\nevery one believed through having eaten the cake, which had caused nausea\r\nand pain to every one else who had tasted it.[188] The catastrophe was\r\naccompanied by the usual portents. Some weeks previous to the attempt Gian\r\nBattista had chanced to walk out to the Porta Tonsa, clad in the smart\r\nsilk gown which his father had recently given him, and as he was passing a\r\nbutcher's shop, a certain pig, one of a drove which was there, rose up out\r\nof the mud and attacked the young physician and befouled his gown. The\r\nbutcher and his men, to whom the thing seemed portentous, drove off the\r\nhog with staves, but this they could only do after the beast had wearied\r\nitself, and after Gian Battista had gone away. Again, at the beginning of\r\nFebruary following, while Cardan was in residence as a Professor at Pavia,\r\nhe chanced to look at the palm of his hand, and there, at the root of the\r\nthird finger of the right hand, he beheld a mark like a bloody sword. That\r\nsame evening a messenger arrived from Milan with the news of his son's\r\narrest, and a letter from his son-in-law, begging him to come at once. The\r\nmark on his hand grew and grew for fifty-three days, gradually mounting up\r\nthe finger, until the last fatal day, when it extended to the tip of the\r\nfinger, and shone bright like fiery blood. The morning after Gian\r\nBattista's execution the mark had almost vanished, and in a day or two no\r\nsign of it remained.\r\n\r\nCardan hurried to Milan to hear from Bartolomeo Sacco, his son-in-law, the\r\nfull extent of the calamity. Probably there were few people in the city\r\nwho did not regard Gian Battista as a worthless fellow, whose death would\r\nbe a gain to the State and a very light loss to his immediate friends, but\r\nCardan was not of this mind. He turned his back upon his professional\r\nengagements at Pavia, and threw himself, heart and soul, into the fight\r\nfor his son's life. He could not make up his mind as to Gian Battista's\r\nrecent conduct; if he ate of the cake, he surely could not have put in\r\npoison himself, or directed others to do so; if, on the other hand, he had\r\npoisoned the cake, Cardan feared greatly that, in the simplicity of his\r\nnature, he would assuredly let his accusers know what he had done. And his\r\nmind was greatly upset by the prodigies of which he had recently had\r\nexperience. For some reason or other he did not visit the accused in\r\nprison, or give him any advice as to what course he should follow, a piece\r\nof neglect which he cites as a reproach against himself afterwards; but\r\ncertain associates of Gian Battista, and his fellow-captives as well,\r\nurged him to assert his innocence, a course which Cardan recognized as the\r\nonly safe one. At the first examination the accused followed this counsel;\r\nat the second he began to waver when the servant deposed that his master\r\nhad given him a certain powder to mix with Brandonia's food in order to\r\nincrease her flow of milk; and, later on, when confronted with the man\r\nfrom whom he had received the poison, he confessed all; and, simpleton as\r\nhe was, admitted that for two months past his mind had been set upon the\r\ndeed, and that on two previous occasions he had attempted to administer to\r\nher the noxious drug against the advice of his servant. From the first\r\nCardan had placed his hopes of deliverance in the intervention of the\r\nMilanese Governor, the Duca di Sessa, who had not long ago consulted him\r\nas physician,[189] but the Duke refused to interfere. The intervention of\r\nan executive officer in the procedure of a Court of Justice was no rare\r\noccurrence at that period, and Cardan was deeply disappointed at the\r\nsqueamishness or indolence of his whilom patient. He records afterwards\r\nhow the Duke met his full share of the calamities which fell upon all\r\nthose who were concerned in Gian Battista's condemnation;[190] and in the\r\n_Dialogus Tetim_, a work which he wrote immediately after the trial, he\r\nbewails afresh the inaction of this excellent ruler and the consequent\r\nloss of his son.[191]\r\n\r\nFor twenty days and more, while Gian Battista lay in prison, Cardan,\r\nalmost mad with apprehension and suspense, spent his time studying in the\r\nlibrary at Milan. Sitting there one day, he heard a warning voice which\r\ntold him that the thing he most feared had indeed come to pass. He felt\r\nthat his heart was broken, and, springing up, he rushed out into the\r\ncourt, where he met certain of the Palavicini, the friends with whom he\r\nwas staying, and cried out, \"Alas, alas, he was indeed privy to the death\r\nof his wife, and now he has confessed it all, therefore he will be\r\ncondemned to death and beheaded.\" Then having caught up a garment he went\r\nout to the piazza, and, before he had gone half-way he met his son-in-law,\r\nwho asked him in sorrowful tones whither he was going. Cardan answered\r\nthat he was troubled with apprehensions lest Gian Battista should have\r\nconfessed his crime, whereupon Bartolomeo Sacco told him that what he\r\nfeared had indeed come to pass. Gian Battista had admitted the truth of\r\nthe charge against him: he was ultimately put on his trial before the\r\nSenate of Milan,[192] the President of the Court being one Rigone, a man\r\nwhom Cardan afterwards accused of partiality and of a hostile bias towards\r\nthe prisoner. Cardan himself stood up to defend his son; but with a full\r\nconfession staring him in the face, he was sorely puzzled to fix upon a\r\nline of defence. This he perceived must of necessity be largely\r\nrhetorical; and, after he had grasped the entire situation, he set to work\r\nto convince the Court on two main points, first, that Gian Battista was a\r\nyouth of simple guileless character; and, second, there was no proof that\r\nBrandonia had died of poison. A physician of good repute, Vincenzo\r\nDinaldo, swore that she had died of fever (_lipyria_), and not from the\r\neffect of poison; and five others, men of the highest character, declared\r\nthat she bore no signs of poison, either externally or internally. Her\r\ntongue and extremities and her body were not blackened, nor was the\r\nstomach swollen, nor did the hair and nails show any signs of falling,\r\nnor were the tissues eaten away. In the opening of his defence Cardan\r\nattempted to discredit the character of Brandonia. He showed how great\r\nwere the injuries and provocations which Gian Battista had received from\r\nher, and that she was a dissolute wanton; her father himself, when under\r\nexamination, having refused to say that she was a virgin when she left his\r\nhouse to be married. He claimed justification for the husband who should\r\nslay his wife convicted of adultery; and here, in this case, Brandonia was\r\nconvicted by her own confession. He maintained that, if homicide is to be\r\ncommitted at all, poison is preferable to the knife, and then he went on\r\nto weave a web of ineffectual casuistry in support of his view, which\r\nmoved the Court to pity and contempt. He cited the _Lex Cornelia_, which\r\ndoomed the common people to the arena, and the patricians to exile, and\r\nclaimed the penalty last-named as the one fitting to the present\r\ncase.[193] Then he proceeded to show that the woman had really died from\r\nnatural causes; for, even granting that she had swallowed arsenic in the\r\ncake, she had vomited at once, and the poison would have no time to do its\r\nwork; moreover there was no proof that Gian Battista had given specific\r\ndirections to anybody to mix poison with the ingredients of the cake. The\r\nmost he had done was to utter some vague words thereanent to his servant,\r\nwho forthwith took the matter into his own hands.[194] If Gian Battista\r\nhad known, if he had merely been suspicious that the cake was poisoned,\r\nwould he have let a crumb of it pass his lips; and if any large quantity\r\nof poison had been present, would he and the other persons who had eaten\r\nthereof have recovered so quickly? Cardan next went on to argue that,\r\nwhatever motive may have swayed Gian Battista at this juncture, it could\r\nnot have been the deliberate intent to kill his wife, because forsooth the\r\nwretched youth was incapable of deliberate action of any sort. He could\r\nnever keep in the same mood for four-and-twenty hours at a stretch. He\r\nnursed alternately in his heart vengeance and forgiveness, changing as\r\ndiscord or peace ruled in his house. Cardan showed what a life of misery\r\nthe wretched youth had passed since his marriage. Had this life continued,\r\nthe finger of shame would have been pointed at him, he must have lost his\r\nstatus as a member of his profession, and have been cut off from the\r\nsociety of all decent people; nay, he would most likely have died by the\r\nhand of one or other of his wife's paramours. This was to show how\r\npowerful was the temptation to which the husband was exposed, and again he\r\nsang the praises of poison as an instrument of \"removal\"; because if\r\neffectively employed, it led to no open scandal.\r\n\r\nHe next brought forward the simple and unsophisticated character of the\r\naccused, and the physical afflictions which had vexed him all his life,\r\ngiving as illustrations of his son's folly the headlong haste with which\r\nhe had rushed into a marriage, his folly in giving an ineffectual dose, if\r\nhe really meant to poison his wife, in letting his plot be known to his\r\nservant, and in confessing. Lastly, Cardan had in readiness one of his\r\nfavourite portents to lay before the Court. When Brandonia's brother had\r\ncome into the house and found his father and sister sick through eating\r\nthe cake, he suspected foul play and rushed at Gian Battista and at Aldo\r\nwho was also there, and threatened them with his sword; but before he\r\ncould harm them he fell down in a fit, his hand having been arrested by\r\nProvidence. Providence had thus shown pity to this wretched youth, and now\r\nCardan besought the Senate to be equally merciful.\r\n\r\nCardan's pleas were all rejected; indeed such issue was inevitable from\r\nthe first, if the Senate of Milan were not determined to abdicate the\r\nprimary functions of a judicial tribunal. Gian Battista was condemned to\r\ndeath, but a strange condition was annexed to the sentence, to wit that\r\nhis life would be spared, if the prosecutors, the Seroni family, could be\r\ninduced to consent. But their consent was only to be gained by the payment\r\nof a sum of money entirely beyond Cardan's means, their demand having been\r\nstimulated through some foolish boasting of the family wealth by the\r\ncondemned prisoner.[195] Cardan was powerless to arrest the course of the\r\nlaw, and Gian Battista was executed in prison on the night of April 7,\r\n1560.\r\n\r\nIn the whole world of biographic record it would be hard to find a figure\r\nmore pathetic than that of Cardan fighting for the life of his unworthy\r\nson. No other episode of his career wins from the reader sympathy half so\r\ndeep. The experience of these terrible days certainly shook still further\r\noff its balance a mind not over steady in its calmest moments. Cardan\r\nwrote voluminously and laboriously over Gian Battista's fate, but in his\r\ndirges and lamentations he never lets fall an expression of detestation or\r\nregret with regard to the crime itself: all his soul goes out in\r\ncelebrating the charm and worth of his son, and in moaning over the ruin\r\nof mind, body, and estate which had fallen upon him through this cruel\r\nstroke of adverse fate. When he sat down to write the _De Vita Propria_,\r\nCardan was strongly possessed with the belief that all through his career\r\nhe had been subject to continuous and extraordinary persecution at the\r\nhands of his enemies. The entire thirtieth chapter is devoted to the\r\ndescription of these plots and assaults. In his earlier writings he\r\nattributes his calamities to evil fate and the influences of the stars;\r\nhis wit was indeed great, and assuredly it was allied to madness, so it is\r\nnot impossible that these personal foes who dogged his steps were largely\r\nthe creatures of an old man's monomaniacal fancies. The persecution, he\r\naffirms, began to be so bitter as to be almost intolerable after the\r\ncondemnation of Gian Battista. \"Certain members of the Senate afterwards\r\nadmitted (though I am sure they would be loth that men should hold them\r\ncapable of such a wish) that they condemned my son to death in the hope\r\nthat I might be killed likewise, or at least might lose my wits, and the\r\npowers above can bear witness how nearly one of these ills befell me. I\r\nwould that you should know what these times were like, and what practices\r\nwere in fashion. I am well assured that I never wrought offence to any of\r\nthese men, even by my shadow. I took advice how I might put forward a\r\ndefence of some kind on my son's behalf, but what arguments would have\r\nprevailed with minds so exasperated against me as were theirs?\"[196]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[176] _De Vita Propria_, p. 57.\r\n\r\n[177] \"In ore illud semper ei erat: Omnis spiritus laudet Dominum, qui\r\nipse est fons omnium virtutum.\"--_De Vita Propria_, ch. iii. p. 7.\r\nReginald Scot, in the _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, says that the aforesaid\r\nexclamation of Fazio was the Paracelsian charm to drive away spirits that\r\nhaunt any house. There is a passage in _De Consolatione_ (_Opera_, tom. i.\r\np. 600) which gives Fazio's view of happiness after death:--\"Memineram\r\npatrem meum, Facium Cardanum, cum viveret, in ore semper habuisse, se\r\nmortem optare, quod nullum suavius tempus experiretur, qu[a=] id in quo\r\nprofundissime dormiens omnium quæ in hac vita fiunt expers esset.\"\r\n\r\n[178] Cardan gives his impressions of musicians:--\"Unde nostra ætate\r\nneminem ferine musicum invenias, qui non omni redundat vitiorum genere.\r\nItaque hujusmodi musica maximo impedimento non solum pauperi et negotioso\r\nviro est, sed etiam omnibus generaliter. Quin etiam virorum egregiorum\r\nnostræ ætatis neminem musicum agnovimus, Erasmum, Alciatum, Budæum,\r\nJasonem, Vesalium, Gesnerum.

The account given in the _De Vita\r\nPropria_, written twenty years later, differs in some details. \"Venio\r\ndomum, accurrit famulus admodum tristis, nunciat Johannem Baptistam\r\nduxisse uxorem Brandoniam Seronam.\"--_De Vita Propria_, ch. xli. p. 147.\r\n\r\n[185] Cardan in describing this action of Gian Battista, who was then\r\ndetermined to murder his wife, says of him: \"Erat enim natura clemens\r\nadmodum et gratus.\"--_De Utilitate_, p. 834.\r\n\r\n[186] \"Triduana illa disceptatio Papiæ cum Camutio instituta, publicata\r\napud Senatum: ipse primo argumento primæ diei siluit.\"--_De Vita Propria_,\r\nch. xii. p. 37. This does not exactly tally with Camutio's version. With\r\nregard to Cardan's assertion that his colleagues hesitated to meet him in\r\nmedical discussion it may be noted that Camutio printed a book at Pavia in\r\n1563, with the following title: \"Andrææ Camutii disputationes quibus\r\nHieronymi Cardani magni nominis viri conclusiones infirmantur, Galenus ab\r\nejusdem injuria vindicatur, Hippocratis præterea aliquot loca diligentius\r\nmulto quam unquam alias explicantur.\" In his version (_De Vita Propria_,\r\nch. xii. p. 37) Cardan inquires sarcastically: \"Habentur ejusdem imagines\r\nquædam typis excusæ in Camutii monumentis.\"\r\n\r\n[187] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xii. p. 39. The Third Book of the\r\n_Theonoston_ (_Opera_, tom. ii. p. 403) is in the form of a disputation,\r\n\"De animi immortalite,\" with this same Branda.\r\n\r\n[188] In his defence at the trial Cardan affirmed that, while Brandonia\r\nwas lying sick from eating the cake, her mother and the nurse quarrelled\r\nand fought, and finally fell down upon the sick woman. When the fight was\r\nover Brandonia was dead. In _Opera_, tom. ii. p. 311 (_Theonoston_, lib.\r\ni.) he writes: \"Obiit illa non veneno, sed vi morbi atque Fato quo tam\r\ninclytus juvenis morte sua, omnia turbare debuerat.\"\r\n\r\n[189] \"Vocatus sum enim ad Ducem Suessanum ex Ticinensi Academia accepique\r\nC. aureos coronatos et dona ex serico.\"--_De Vita Propria_, ch. xl. p.\r\n138.\r\n\r\n[190] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xli. p. 153.\r\n\r\n[191] _Opera_, tom. i. p. 671. He cites the names of former Governors of\r\nMilan and other patrons, many of them harsh men, and not one as kind and\r\nbeneficent as the Duca di Sessa; to wit Antonio Leva, Cardinal Caracio,\r\nAlfonso d'Avalos, Ferrante Gonzaga, the Cardinal of Trent, and the Duca\r\nd'Alba. Yet the rule of his best friend brought him his worst misfortune.\r\n\r\n[192] There is a full account of the trial in an appendix to the _De\r\nUtilitate ex Adversis Capienda_ (Basel, 1561). It is not included in the\r\nedition hitherto cited.\r\n\r\n[193] Laudabatur ejus benignitas aC simul factum Io.

Sed non potuit filii\r\nstultitia, qui dum jactat opes quæ non sunt, illi quod non erat\r\nexigunt.\"--_De Vita Propria_, ch. x. p. 34.\r\n\r\n[196] _De Vita Propria_, ch. x. p. 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nCARDAN had risen to high and well-deserved fame, and this fact alone might\r\naccount for the existence of jealousy and ill-feeling amongst certain of\r\nthose whom he had passed in the race. Some men, it is true, rise to\r\neminence without making more than a few enemies, but Cardan was not one of\r\nthese. His foes must have been numerous and truculent, the assault they\r\ndelivered must have been deadly and overwhelming to have brought to such\r\npiteous wreck fortunes which seemed to rest upon the solid ground of\r\ndesert. The public voice might accuse him of folly, but assuredly not of\r\ncrime; he was the victim and not the culprit; his skill as a physician was\r\nas great as ever, but these considerations weighed little with the hounds\r\nwho were close upon his traces. Now that the tide of his fortune seemed to\r\nbe on the ebb they gathered around him. He writes: \"And this, in sooth,\r\nwas the chief, the culminating misfortune of my life: forasmuch as I could\r\nnot with any show of decency be kept in my office, nor could I be\r\ndismissed without some more valid excuse, I could neither continue to\r\nreside in Milan with safety, nor could I depart therefrom. As I walked\r\nabout the city men looked askance at me; and whenever I might be forced to\r\nexchange words with any one, I felt that I was a disgraced man. Thus,\r\nbeing conscious that my company was unacceptable, I shunned my friends. I\r\nhad no notion what I should do, or whither I should go. I cannot say\r\nwhether I was more wretched in myself than I was odious to my\r\nfellows.\"[197]\r\n\r\nCardan gathered a certain amount of consolation from meditating over the\r\nills which befell all those who were concerned in Gian Battista's fate.\r\nThe Senator Falcutius, a man of the highest character in other respects,\r\ndied about four months later, exclaiming with his dying breath that he was\r\nundone through the brutal ignorance of a certain man, who had been eager\r\nfor the death sentence. One Hala shortly afterwards followed Falcutius to\r\nthe grave, having fallen sick with phthisis immediately after the trial.\r\nRigone, the President of the Court, lost his wife, and gave her burial\r\nbereft of the usual decencies of the last rite, a thing which Cardan says\r\nhe could not have believed, had he not been assured of the same by the\r\ntestimony of many witnesses. It was reported too, that Rigone himself,\r\nthough a man of good reputation, was forced to feign death in order to\r\nescape accusation on some charge or other. His only son had died shortly\r\nbefore, so it might be said with reason that his house was as it were\r\nthrown under an evil spell by the avenging Furies of the youth whom he had\r\nsent to die in a dungeon. Again, within a few days the prosecutor himself,\r\nEvangelista Seroni, the man who was the direct cause of his son-in-law's\r\ndeath, was thrown into prison, and, having been deprived of his office of\r\ndebt collector, became a beggar. Moreover, the son whom he specially loved\r\nwas condemned to death in Sicily, and died on the gallows. Public and\r\nprivate calamity fell upon the Duca di Sessa,[198] the Governor of Milan,\r\ndoubtless because he had allowed the law to take its course. Indeed every\r\nperson great or small who had been concerned in Gian Battista's\r\ncondemnation, was, by Cardan's showing, overtaken by grave misfortune.\r\n\r\nCardan still held his Professorship at Pavia, and in spite of the\r\ndifficulties and embarrassments of his position he went back to resume his\r\nwork of teaching a few days after the fatal issue of his son's trial and\r\ncondemnation. By the pathetic simplicity of its diction the following\r\nextract gives a vivid and piteous picture of the utter desolation and\r\nmisery into which he was cast: it shows likewise that, after a lapse of\r\nfifteen years, the memory of his shame and sorrow was yet green, and that\r\na powerful stimulus had been given to his superstitious fancies by the\r\nevents lately chronicled. \"In the month of May, in the year MDLX, a time\r\nwhen sleep had refused to come to me because of my grief for my son's\r\ndeath: when I could get no relief from fasting nor from the flagellation I\r\ninflicted upon my legs when I rode abroad, nor from the game of chess\r\nwhich I then played with Ercole Visconti, a youth very dear to me, and\r\nlike myself troubled with sleeplessness, I prayed God to have pity upon\r\nme, because I felt that I must needs die, or lose my wits, or at least\r\ngive up my work as Professor, unless I got some sleep, and that soon. Were\r\nI to resign my office, I could find no other means of earning my bread: if\r\nI should go mad I must become a laughing-stock to all. I must in any case\r\nlavish what still remained of my patrimony, for at my advanced age I could\r\nnot hope to find fresh employment. Therefore I besought God that He would\r\nsend me death, which is the lot of all men. I went to bed: it was already\r\nlate, and, as I must needs rise at four in the morning, I should not have\r\nmore than two hours' rest. Sleep, however, fell upon me at once, and\r\nmeseemed that I heard a voice speaking to me out of the darkness. I could\r\ndiscern naught, so it was impossible to say what voice it was, or who was\r\nthe speaker. It said, 'What would you have?' or 'What are you grieving\r\nover?' and added, 'Is it that you mourn for your son's death?' I replied,\r\n'Can you doubt this?' Then the voice answered, 'Take the stone which is\r\nhanging round your neck and place it to your mouth, and so long as you\r\nhold it there you will not be troubled with thoughts of your son.' Here I\r\nawoke, and at once asked myself what this beryl stone could have to do\r\nwith sleep, but after a little, when I found no other means of escape from\r\nmy trouble, I called to mind the words spoken of a certain man: 'He hoped\r\neven beyond hope, and it was accounted to him as righteousness' (spoken of\r\nAbraham), and put the stone in my mouth, whereupon a thing beyond belief\r\ncame to pass. In a moment all remembrance of my son faded from my mind,\r\nand the same thing happened when I fell asleep a second time after being\r\naroused.\"[199]\r\n\r\nThe record of Cardan's life for the next two years is a meagre one. His\r\nrest was constantly disturbed either by the machinations of his foes or by\r\nthe dread thereof, the evil last-named being probably the more noxious of\r\nthe two. As long ago as 1557 he had begun the treatise _De Utilitate ex\r\nAdversis Capienda_, a work giving evidence of careful construction, and\r\none which, as a literary performance, takes the first rank.[200] This book\r\nhad been put aside, either through pressure of other work or family\r\ntroubles, but now the circumstances in which he found himself seemed\r\nperfectly congenial for the elaboration of a subject of this nature, so he\r\nset to work to finish it, concluding with the chapter _De Luctu_, which\r\nhas been used largely as the authority for the foregoing narrative of Gian\r\nBattista's crime and death. At this period, when his mind was fully stored\r\nand his faculties adequately disciplined for the production of the best\r\nwork, he seems to have realized with sharp regret that the time before him\r\nwas so short, and that whatever fresh fruit of knowledge he might put\r\nforth would prove of very slight profit to him, as author. Writing of his\r\nreplies given to certain mathematical professors, who had sent him\r\nproblems for solution, he remarks that, although he may have a happy knack\r\nof dispatching with rapidity any work begun, he always begins too late. In\r\nhis fifty-eighth year he answered one of these queries, involving three\r\nvery difficult problems, within seven days; a feat which he judges to be a\r\nmarvel: but what profit will it bring him now? If he had written this\r\ntreatise when he was thirty he would straightway have risen to fame and\r\nfortune, in spite of his poverty, his rivals, and his enemies. Then, in\r\nten years' space, he would have finished and brought out all those books\r\nwhich were now lying unfinished around him in his old age; and moreover\r\nwould have won so great gain and glory, that no farther good fortune\r\nwould have remained for him to ask for. Another work which he had begun\r\nabout the same time (1558) was the treatise on _Dialectic_, illustrated by\r\ngeometrical problems and theorems, and likewise by the well-known logical\r\ncatch lines _Barbara Celarent_. During the summer vacation of 1561 he\r\nreturned to Milan, and began a _Commentary on the Anatomy of Mundinus_,\r\nthe recognized text-book of the schools up to the appearance of Vesalius.\r\nIn the preface to this work he puts forward a vigorous plea for the\r\nextended use of anatomy in reaching a diagnosis.[201] He had likewise on\r\nhand the _Theonoston_, a set of essays on Moral subjects written something\r\nin the spirit of Seneca; and, after Gian Battista's death, he wrote the\r\ndialogue _Tetim, seu de Humanis Consiliis_. In the year following, 1561, a\r\nfarther sorrow and trouble came upon him by the death of the English\r\nyouth, William. If he was guilty of neglect in the case of this young\r\nman--and by his own confession he was--he was certainly profoundly grieved\r\nat his death. In the Argument to the _Dialogus de Morte_ he laments that\r\nhe ever let the youth leave his house without sending him back to England,\r\nand tells how he was cozened by Daldo, the crafty tailor, out of a premium\r\nof thirty-one gold crowns, in return for which William was to be taught a\r\ntrade. \"But during the summer, Daldo, who had a little farm in the\r\ncountry, took the youth there and let him join in the village games, and\r\nby degrees made him into a vinedresser. But if at any time it chanced that\r\nWilliam's services were also wanted at the tailor's shop, his master would\r\nforce him to return thereto in the evening (for the farm was two miles\r\ndistant), and sit sewing all the night. Besides this the boy would go\r\ndancing with the villagers, and in the course of their merry-making he\r\nfell in love with a girl. While I was living at Milan he was taken with\r\nfever, and came to me; but, for various reasons, I did not give proper\r\nattention to him, first, because he himself made light of his ailment;\r\nsecond, because I knew not that his sickness had been brought on by\r\nexcessive toil and exposure to the sun; and third, because, when he had\r\nbeen seized with a similar distemper on two or three occasions before\r\nthis, he had always got well within four or five days. Besides this I was\r\nthen in trouble owing to the running away of my son Aldo and one of my\r\nservants. What more is there to tell? Four days after I had ordered him to\r\nbe bled, messengers came to me in the night and begged me to go and see\r\nhim, for he was apparently near his end. He was seized with convulsions\r\nand lost his senses, but I battled with the disease and brought him round.\r\nI was obliged to return to Pavia to resume my teaching, and William, when\r\nhe was well enough to get up, was forced to sleep in the workshop by his\r\nmaster, who had been bidden to a wedding. There he suffered so much from\r\ncold and bad food that, when he was setting out for Pavia to seek me, he\r\nwas again taken ill. His unfeeling master caused him to be removed to the\r\npoor-house, and there he died the following morning from the violence of\r\nthe distemper, from agony of mind, and from the cold he had suffered.\r\nIndeed I was so heavily stricken by mischance that meseemed I had lost\r\nanother son.\"\r\n\r\nIt was partly as a consolation in his own grief, and partly as a monument\r\nto the ill-fated youth, that Cardan wrote the _Dialogus de Morte_, a work\r\nwhich contains little of interest beyond the record of Cardan's\r\nimpressions of Englishmen already quoted. But it was beyond hope that he\r\nshould find adequate solace for the gnawing grief and remorse which\r\noppressed him in this, or any other literary work. He was ill looked upon\r\nat Milan, but his position at Pavia seems to have been still more irksome.\r\nHe grew nervous as to his standing as a physician, for, with the powerful\r\nprejudice which had been raised against him both as to his public and his\r\nprivate affairs, he felt that a single slip in his treatment of any\r\nparticular case would be fatal to him. In Milan he did meet with a certain\r\namount of gratitude from the wealthier citizens for the services he had\r\nwrought them; but in Pavia, his birthplace, the public mind was strongly\r\nset against him; indeed in 1562 he was subjected to so much petty\r\npersecution at the hands of the authorities and of his colleagues, that he\r\ndetermined to give up his Professorship at all cost. He describes at great\r\nlength one of the most notable intrigues against him. \"Now in dealing with\r\nthe deadly snares woven against my life, I will tell you of something\r\nstrange which befell me. During my Professorship at Pavia I was in the\r\nhabit of reading in my own house. I had in my household at that time a\r\nwoman to do occasional work, the youth Ercole Visconti, two boys, and\r\nanother servant. Of the two boys, one was my amanuensis and well skilled\r\nin music, and the other was a lackey. It was in 1562 that I made up my\r\nmind to resign my office of teaching and quit Pavia, a resolution which\r\nthe Senate took in ill part, and dealt with me as with a man transported\r\nwith rage. But there were two doctors of the city who strove with all\r\ntheir might to drive me away: one a crafty fellow who had formerly been a\r\npupil of mine; the other was the teacher extraordinary in Medicine, a\r\nsimple-minded man, and, as I take it, not evil by nature; but covetous and\r\nambitious men will stop at nothing, especially when the prize to be won is\r\nan office held in high esteem. Thus, when they despaired of getting rid\r\nof me through the action of the Senate--what though I was petitioning to\r\nbe relieved of my duties--they laid a plot to kill me, not by the dagger\r\nfor fear of the Senate and of possible scandal, but by malignant craft. My\r\nopponent perceived that he could not be promoted to the post of principal\r\nteacher unless I should leave the place, and for this reason he and his\r\nallies spread their nets from a distance. In the first place, they caused\r\nto be written to me, in the name of my son-in-law[202] and of my daughter\r\nas well, a most vile and filthy letter telling how they were ashamed of\r\ntheir kinship with me; that they were ashamed likewise for the sake of the\r\nSenate, and of the College; and that the authorities ought to take\r\ncognizance of the matter and pronounce me unworthy of the office of\r\nteacher and cause me to be removed therefrom forthwith. Confounded at\r\nreceiving such an impudent and audacious reproof at the hands of my own\r\nkindred, I knew not what to do or say, or what reply I should make; nor\r\ncould I divine for what reason this unseemly and grievous affront had been\r\nput upon me. It afterwards came to light that the letter was written in\r\norder to serve as an occasion for fresh attacks; for, before many days had\r\npassed, another letter came to me bearing the name of one Fioravanti,\r\nwritten in the following strain. This man was likewise shocked for the\r\nsake of the city, the college, and the body of professors, seeing that a\r\nreport had been spread abroad that I was guilty of abominable offences\r\nwhich cannot be named. He would call upon a number of his friends to take\r\nsteps to compel me to consider the public scandal I was causing, and would\r\nsee that the houses where these offences were committed should be pointed\r\nout. When I read this letter I was as one stupefied, nor could I believe\r\nit was the work of Fioravanti, whom I had hitherto regarded as a man of\r\nseemly carriage and a friend. But this letter and its purport remained\r\nfixed in my mind and prompted me to reply to my son-in-law; for I believed\r\nno longer that he had aught to do with the letter which professed to come\r\nfrom him; indeed I ought never to have harboured such a suspicion, seeing\r\nthat both then and now he has always had the most kindly care for me; nor\r\nhas he ever judged ill of me.\r\n\r\n\"I called for my cloak at once and went to Fioravanti, whom I questioned\r\nabout the letter. He admitted that he wrote it, whereupon I was more than\r\never astonished, for I was loth to suspect him of crooked dealing, much\r\nmore of any premeditated treachery. I began to reason with him, and to\r\ninquire where all these wonderful plans had been concocted, and then he\r\nbegan to waver, and failed to find an answer. He could only put forward\r\ncommon report, and the utterances of the Rector of the Gymnasium, as the\r\nsource of them.\"[203]\r\n\r\nCardan goes on to connect the foregoing incident, by reasoning which is\r\nnot very clear, with what he maintained to have been a veritable attempt\r\nagainst his life. \"The first act of the tragedy having come to an end, the\r\nsecond began, and this threw certain light upon the first. My foes made it\r\ntheir special care that I, whom they held up as a disgrace to my country,\r\nto my family, to the Senate, to the Colleges of Milan and Pavia, to the\r\nCouncil of Professors, and to the students, should become a member of the\r\nAccademia degli Affidati, a society in which were enrolled divers\r\nillustrious theologians, two Cardinals, and two princes, the Duke of\r\nMantua, and the Marquis Pescara. When they perceived how loth I was to\r\ntake this step they began to threaten. What was I to do, broken down by\r\nthe cruel fate of my son, and suffering every possible evil? Finally I\r\nagreed, induced by the promise they made me, that, in the course of a few\r\ndays, I should be relieved of my duties as Professor; but I did not then\r\nperceive the snare, or consider how it was that they should now court the\r\nfellowship of one whom, less than fifteen days ago, all ranks of the\r\nCollege had declared to be a monster not to be tolerated. Alas for faith\r\nin heaven, for the barbarity of men, for the hatred of false friends, for\r\nthat shamelessness and cruelty more fell than serpent's bite! What more is\r\nthere to tell? The first time I entered the room of the Affidati I saw\r\nthat a heavy beam had been poised above in such fashion that it might\r\neasily fall and kill whatsoever person might be passing underneath.\r\nWhether this had been done by accident or design I cannot say. But\r\nhereafter I attended as rarely as possible, making excuses for my absence;\r\nand, when I did go, I went when no one looked for me, and out of season,\r\ntaking good heed of this trap the while. Wherefore no evil befell me\r\nthereby, either because my foes deemed it unwise to work such wickedness\r\nin public, or because they had not finally agreed to put their scheme in\r\noperation, or because they were plotting some fresh evil against me.\r\nAnother attempt was made a few days later, when I was called to the ailing\r\nson of one Piero Trono, a surgeon; they placed high over the door a leaden\r\nweight which might easily be made to fall, pretending that it had been put\r\nthere to hold up the curtain. This weight did fall; and, had it struck me,\r\nit would certainly have killed me: how near I was to death, God knows.\r\nWherefore I began to be suspicious of something I could not define, so\r\ngreatly was my mind upset. Then a third attempt was made, which was\r\nevident enough. A few days later, when they were about to sing a new Mass,\r\nthe same rascally crew came to me, asking me whether I would lend them the\r\nservices of my two singing boys, for my enemies knew well enough that\r\nthese boys acted as my cup-bearers, and over and beyond this they made an\r\nagreement with my hired woman that she should give me poison. They first\r\nwent to Ercole and tried to persuade him to go to the function; and he,\r\nsuspecting nothing, at first promised his help; but when he heard that his\r\nfellow was to go likewise, he began to smell mischief and said, 'Only one\r\nof us knows music.' Then Fioravanti, a blunt fellow, was so wholly set on\r\ngetting them out of the house that he said, 'Let us have both of you, for\r\nwe know that the other is also a musician; and, though he may not be one\r\nof the best, still he will serve to swell the band of choristers.' Then\r\nErcole said somewhat vaguely that he would ask his master. He came to me,\r\nhaving fathomed and laid bare the whole intention of the plot, so that, if\r\nI had not been stark mad and stupid, I might easily have seen through\r\ntheir design. Fifteen days or so had passed when the same men once more\r\nsought me out and begged me to let them have the two boys to help them in\r\nthe performance of a comedy. Then Ercole came to me and said, 'Now in\r\nsooth the riddle is plain to read; they are planning to get all your\r\npeople away from your table, so that they may kill you with poison; nor\r\nare they satisfied with plotting your death merely by tricks of this sort;\r\nthey are determined to kill you by any chance which may offer.\"[204]\r\n\r\nHow far these plots were real, and how far they sprang from monomania it\r\nis impossible to say. Cardan's relations with his brother physicians had\r\nnever been of the happiest, and it is quite possible that a set may have\r\nbeen made in the Pavian Academy to get rid of a colleague, difficult to\r\nlive with at the best, and now cankered still more in temper by\r\nmisfortune, and likewise, in a measure, disgraced by the same. Surrounded\r\nby annoyances such as these, and tormented by the intolerable memories and\r\nassociations of the last few years, it is not wonderful that he should\r\nseek a way out of his troubles by a change of scene and occupation.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1536 Cardan had had professional relations with certain\r\nmembers of the Borromeo family, which was one of the most illustrious in\r\nMilan, and in 1560 Carlo Borromeo was appointed Archbishop of Milan. There\r\nis no record of the date when Cardan first made acquaintance with this\r\ngenerous patron, who was the nephew of the reigning Pope, Pius IV.,\r\nhimself a Milanese, but it is certain that Cardan had at an earlier date\r\nsuccessfully treated the mother of the future Cardinal,[205] wherefore it\r\nis legitimate to assume that the physician was _persona grata_ to the\r\nwhole family. As soon as Cardan had determined to withdraw from Pavia he\r\napplied to the Cardinal, who had just made a magnificent benefaction to\r\nBologna in the form of the University buildings. He espoused Cardan's\r\ninterests at once, and most opportunely, for the protection of a powerful\r\npersonage was almost as needful at Bologna, as the sequel shows, as it\r\nwould have been at Pavia. It was evident that Cardan had foes elsewhere\r\nthan in Pavia; indeed the early stages of the negotiation, which went on\r\nin reference to his transfer to Bologna, suggest a doubt whether the\r\nchange would bring him any advantage other than the substitution of one\r\nset of enemies for another. He writes: \"When I was about to be summoned\r\nto teach at Bologna, some persons of that place who were envious of my\r\nreputation sent a certain officer (a getter-up of petitions) to Pavia. Now\r\nthis fellow, who never once entered the class-room, nor had a word with\r\nany one of my pupils, wrote, on what authority I know not, a report in\r\nthese words: 'Concerning Girolamo Cardano, I am told that he taught in\r\nthis place, but got no pupils, always lecturing to empty benches: that he\r\nis a man of evil life, ill regarded by all, and little less than a fool,\r\nrepulsive in his manners, and entirely unskilled in medicine. After he had\r\npromulgated certain of his opinions he found no one in the city who would\r\nemploy him, nor did he practise his art.'\r\n\r\n\"These words were read to the Senate by the messenger on his return in the\r\npresence of the illustrious Borromeo, the Pope's Legate to the city. The\r\nSenate were upon the point of breaking off all further negotiations, but\r\nwhile the man was reading his report, some one present heard the words in\r\nwhich he declared that I did not practise medicine. 'Hui!' he cried, 'I\r\nknow that is not true, for I myself have seen divers men of the highest\r\nconsideration going to him for help, and I--though I am not to be ranked\r\nwith them--have often consulted him myself.' Then the Legate took up the\r\nparole and said, 'I too bear witness that he cured my own mother when she\r\nwas given up by every one else.' Then the first speaker suggested that\r\nprobably the rest of the tale was just as worthy of belief as this one\r\nstatement, the Legate agreeing thereto; whereupon the messenger aforesaid\r\nheld his tongue and blushed for shame. Ultimately the Senate determined to\r\nappoint me Professor for one year, 'for,' they said, 'if he should prove\r\nto be the sort of man the officer describes, or if his teaching should\r\nprofit us nothing, we can let him go; but if it be otherwise, the\r\ncontract may be ratified.' With regard to the salary, over which a dispute\r\nhad already arisen, the Legate gave his consent, and the business came to\r\nan end.\r\n\r\n\"But, disregarding this settlement, my opponents urged one of their number\r\nto wait upon me as a delegate from the Senate, and this man would fain\r\nhave added to the terms already sanctioned by the Senate, others which I\r\ncould not possibly accept. He offered me a smaller stipend, no teaching\r\nroom was assigned to me, and no allowance for travelling expenses. I\r\nrefused to treat with him, whereupon he was forced to depart, and to\r\nreturn to me later on with the terms of my engagement duly set\r\nforth.\"[206]\r\n\r\nIt was in June 1562 that Cardan finally resigned his position at Pavia,\r\nbut it was not until some months after this date that the final agreement\r\nwith the Bolognese Senate, lately referred to, was concluded, and in the\r\ninterim he was forced to suffer no slight annoyance and persecution at the\r\nhands of his adversaries in Pavia, in Bologna, and in Milan as well. Just\r\nbefore he resigned his Professorship he was warned by the portentous\r\nkindling of a fire, seemingly dead,[207] that fresh mischief was afoot,\r\nand he at once determined in his mind that his foes had planned\r\ndestruction against him afresh. So impressed was he at this manifestation\r\nthat he swore he would not leave home on the day following. \"But early in\r\nthe morning there came to my house four or five of my pupils bidding me to\r\na feast, where all the chief Professors of the Gymnasium and the Academy\r\nproposed to be present. I replied that I could not come, whereupon\r\nthey, knowing that it was not my wont to dine in the middle of the day,\r\nand deeming that it was on this score that I refused to join them, said,\r\n'Then for your sake we will make the feast a supper.' I answered that I\r\ncould not on any account make one of their party, and then they demanded\r\nto know the cause of my refusal. I replied it was because of a strange\r\nevent which had befallen me, and of a vow I had made thereanent. At this\r\nthey were greatly astonished, and two of them exchanged significant\r\nglances, and they urged me again and again that I should not be so firmly\r\nset upon marring so illustrious a gathering by my absence, but I gave back\r\nthe same answer as before.\"[208] They came a second time, but Cardan was\r\nnot to be moved. He records, however, that he did break his vow after all\r\nby going out after dusk to see a poor butcher who was seriously ill.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to detect any evidence of deadly intent in what seems, by\r\ncontemporary daylight, to have been a complimentary invitation to dinner;\r\nbut to the old man, possessed as he was by hysterical terrors, this\r\nepisode undoubtedly foreshadowed another assault against his life. He\r\nfinds some compensation, however, in once more recording the fact that all\r\nthese disturbers of his peace--like the men who were concerned in Gian\r\nBattista's condemnation--came to a bad end. His rival, who had taken his\r\nplace as Professor, had not taught in the schools more than three or four\r\ntimes before he was seized with disease and died after three months'\r\nsuffering. \"Upon him there lay only the suspicion of the charge, but I\r\nheard afterwards that a friend of his was certainly privy to the deed of\r\nmurder which they had resolved to work upon me by giving me a cup of\r\npoisoned wine at the supper. In the same year died Delfino, and a little\r\nwhile after Fioravanti.\"[209]\r\n\r\nIn July Cardan withdrew to Milan, where, to add to his other troubles, he\r\nwas seized with an attack of fever. He was now thoroughly alarmed at the\r\nlook of his affairs. Many of his fears may have been imaginary, but the\r\nburden of real trouble which he had to carry was one which might easily\r\nbring him to the ground, and, when once a man is down, the crowd has\r\nlittle pity or scruple in trampling him to death. He set about to review\r\nhis position, and to spy out all possible sources of danger. He writes: \"I\r\ncalled to mind all the books I had written, and, seeing that in them there\r\nwere many obscure passages upon which an unfavourable meaning might be put\r\nby the malice of my enemies, I wrote to the Council, submitting all my\r\nwritings to its judgment and will and pleasure. By this action I saved\r\nmyself from grave danger and disgrace in the future.\"[210] The Council to\r\nwhich Cardan here refers was probably the Congregation of the Index\r\nappointed by the Council at Trent for the authoritative examination of all\r\nbooks before allowing them to be read by the faithful. Before the close of\r\nthe Council (1563) these duties had been handed over to the Pope (Pius\r\nIV.), who published the revised and definite Roman Index in 1564.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[197] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xxvii. p. 71.\r\n\r\n[198] \"Quin etiam dominus ac Princeps alioquin generosus et humanus, cum\r\nipsum ob invidiam meam et accusatorum multitudinem deseruisset, et ipse\r\nmultis modis conflictatus est gravibus morbis, cæde propriæ neptis à\r\nconjuge suo, litibus gravibus: tum etiam subsecuta calamitas publica,\r\nZotophagite insula amissa, classe regia dissipata.\"--_De Vita Propria_,\r\nch. xli. p. 153. The island alluded to must have been _Lotophagites\r\ninsula_, an island near the Syrtes Minor on the African coast, and the\r\nloss of the same probably refers to some disaster during the Imperialist\r\nwars against the Moors.\r\n\r\n[199] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xliii. p. 160.\r\n\r\n[200] Cardan rates it as his best work on an ethical subject.--_Opera_,\r\ntom i. p. 146. And on p. 115 he writes: \"Utinam contigisset absolvere ante\r\nerrorem filii; neque enim ille errasset, nec errandi causam aliquam\r\nhabuisset: nec, etiamsi errasset, periisset.\" He also quotes a letter full\r\nof sound and loving counsels which he had sent to Gian Battista six months\r\nbefore he fell into the snare.\r\n\r\n[201] _Opera_, tom. x. p. 129.\r\n\r\n[202] Bartolomeo Sacco was evidently living at Pavia at this date.\r\n\r\n[203] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xxx. p. 83.\r\n\r\n[204] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xxx. p. 86.\r\n\r\n[205] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xvii. p. 55.\r\n\r\n[206] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xvii. p. 54.\r\n\r\n[207] _Ibid.,_ ch. xxx. p. 88.

The journey under the burning sun\r\nof the hottest summer known for many years aggravated his malady, but he\r\nbrought the child out of danger. He caught erysipelas in the face, and to\r\nthis ailment succeeded severe trouble with the teeth. If it had not been\r\nfor the fact that the time of the new moon had been near, he says that he\r\nmust have submitted to blood-letting; but after the new moon his health\r\nmended, and thus he escaped the two-fold danger--that of the disease, and\r\nthat of the lancet. He tells of an attempt made against his life by a\r\nservant for the sake of robbery, an attempt which came very near success;\r\nand of a severe attack of gout in the knee. After a month's confinement to\r\nhis house he began to practise Medicine; and, finding patients in plenty,\r\nhe nourished a hope that Fortune had done her worst, and that he might be\r\nallowed to repair his shattered fortunes by the exercise of his calling,\r\nbut the activity of his adversaries--which may or may not have been\r\nprovoked solely by malignity--was unsleeping. He hints at further attempts\r\nagainst his good name and his life, and gives at length some painful\r\ndetails of another charge made against him of an infamous character. It\r\nis almost certain that his way was made all the harder for him from the\r\ncomplaints which he had put in print about the indifference of the Duca di\r\nSessa to his interests at the time of Gian Battista's trial. The Milanese\r\ndoctors had no love for him, and every petulant word he might let fall\r\nwould almost surely be brought to the Governor's ears. By Cardan's own\r\nadmission it appears that utterances of this sort were both frequent and\r\nacrid. There was a certain physician of the city who wished to place his\r\nson gratis in Cardan's household. Cardan, however, refused, whereupon the\r\nphysician in question called attention to a certain book in which Cardan\r\nhad made some remarks to the effect that the friendship of the Duca di\r\nSessa had been a fatal one to him, inasmuch as, having trusted too\r\nentirely to this friendship for his support, he had let go other interests\r\nwhich might have served him better. The physician aforesaid made a second\r\napplication to Cardan to receive his son, offering this time to intercede\r\nwith the Governor on his behalf. This proposition roused the old man's\r\nanger, and he exclaimed that he had no need of such friendship or\r\nprotection; that in fact the interruption of their good understanding had\r\ncome about more by his own act than the Governor's, who had been either\r\nunable or unwilling to save Gian Battista's life. The doctor replied, in\r\nthe presence of divers persons, that Gian Battista had perished through\r\nhis own foolishness: if he had not confessed he would never have been\r\ncondemned; that the Senate had condemned him and not the Duca di Sessa,\r\nand that Cardan was now slandering this prince most unjustly. A lot of\r\nbusy-bodies had by this time been attracted by the wrangle, and these\r\nheard the doctor's accusations in full, but gathered a very imperfect\r\nnotion of Cardan's reply. He indignantly denied this charge, and in his\r\nown account of the scene he affirms that he won the approbation of all who\r\nlistened, by the moderation of his bearing and speech.\r\n\r\nFour days after this occurrence he again met this physician, who declared\r\nhe knew for certain that a kinsman of the Duca di Sessa, a hot-tempered\r\nman, had just read some slanders written by Cardan about the Duke, and had\r\ndeclared he would cut the writer in half and throw his remains into the\r\njakes; the physician went on to say that he had appeased this gentleman's\r\nresentment, and that Cardan had now no cause for fear. Cardan at once saw\r\nthrough the dishonesty of the fellow, who was not content with bringing\r\nforward an unjust accusation, but must likewise subject him to these\r\ncalumnies and the consequent dangers. After a bout of wrangling, in which\r\nthe physician sought vainly to win from him an acknowledgment of the\r\nservice he had wrought, the malicious fellow shouted out to the crowd\r\nwhich had gathered around them that Cardan persisted in his infamous\r\nslanders against the Governor. Wanton as the charge was, Cardan felt that\r\nwith his present unpopularity it might easily grow into a fatal danger.\r\nMight was right in Milan as far as he was concerned, but he determined\r\nthat he must make a stand against this pestilent fellow. By good luck he\r\nmet some friends, to whom he told the adventure; and while he was\r\nspeaking, the gentleman who was said to have threatened him, and the\r\nslanderous physician as well, joined the gathering; whereupon one of\r\nCardan's friends repeated the whole story to the gentleman; who, as he was\r\nquite unversed in letters, was hugely diverted at hearing himself set down\r\nas a student, and told the physician that he was a fool, thereby\r\ndelivering Cardan at least from this annoyance.\r\n\r\nHe had refused the terms which the party opposed to him in the Senate at\r\nBologna had sent for his acceptance, and was still waiting to hear whether\r\nthey would carry out their original propositions. It was during this time\r\nof suspense that he was subjected to strange and inexplicable treatment at\r\nthe hands of the Milanese Senate, treatment which, viewed by the light of\r\nhis own report--the only one extant--seems very harsh and unjust. He\r\nwrites: \"At the time when I was greatly angered by the action of the\r\nBolognese agent, four of the Senators persuaded me to seek practice once\r\nmore in Milan, wherefore I, having altered my plans, began to try to earn\r\nan honest living, for I reckoned that the Senate of Milan knew that I had\r\nrejected the offers from Bologna, since these offers were unjust in\r\nthemselves, and put before me in unjust fashion. But afterwards, although\r\nthe same iniquitous terms were offered to me, I accepted them, not indeed\r\nbecause I was satisfied therewith, but because of my necessity, and so\r\nthat I might be free from those dangers which, as I have before stated,\r\npressed upon me in those days. The reason why I took this step was that\r\nthe Senate, by most unexpected action, removed my name from the lists of\r\nthose licensed to teach; nor was this all. They warned me by a message\r\nthat they had recently given hearing to a double charge against me of very\r\ngrave offences, and that nothing but my position, and the interests of the\r\nCollege, kept them back from laying me in hold. Nevertheless, influenced\r\nby these considerations, they had been moved to reduce my punishment to\r\nthat of exile. But neither my good fortune nor God deserted me; for on the\r\nsame day certain things came to pass by means of which I was able, with a\r\nsingle word, to free myself from all suspicion upon either charge, and to\r\nprove my innocence. Moreover, I forced them to admit that no mention of\r\nthis affair had ever been made before the Senate, although two graduates\r\nhad informed me that it had been discussed.\"[211]\r\n\r\nThe Senate, however, was reluctant to stultify its late action, and\r\nrefused to restore Cardan's name to the list of teachers. But he was put\r\nright in the sight of the world by the sharp censure pronounced by the\r\nSenate upon those busy-bodies who had ventured to speak in its name.\r\nCardan's last days in Milan were cheered with a brief gleam of good\r\nfortune. His foes seem to have overshot the mark, and to have aroused\r\nsympathy for the old man, who, whatever his faults, was alike an honour to\r\nhis country and the victim of fortune singularly cruel. The city took him\r\nunder its protection, assured of his innocence as to the widespread\r\ncharges against him, and pitying his misfortunes. His friend Borromeo had\r\nprobably been forwarding his interests at the Papal Court, for he records\r\nthat, just at this time, certain Cardinals and men of weight wrote to him\r\nfrom Rome in kindly and flattering terms. On November 16, 1562, the\r\nmessenger from the Senate of Bologna arrived at Milan, bearing an offer of\r\nslightly more liberal terms. They were not so favourable as Cardan wished\r\nfor; but, even had they been worse, he would probably have closed with\r\nthem. In spite of the benevolent attitude of his well-wishers in Milan, it\r\nirked him to be there; the faces in the streets, the town gossip, all\r\ntended to recall to him the death of his son, so he departed at once to\r\ntake up his duties.\r\n\r\nAt Bologna Cardan went first to live in a hired house in the Via Gombru.\r\nAldo was nominally a member of his household; but his presence must have\r\nbeen a plague rather than a comfort to his father, and he took with him\r\nlikewise his orphan grandson, the son of Gian Battista and Brandonia, whom\r\nhe destined to make his heir on account of Aldo's ill conduct.[212] This\r\nyoung man seems to have been a hopeless scoundrel from the first. The\r\nratio in which fathers apportion their affection amongst their offspring\r\nis a very capricious one, and Cardan may have been fully as wide of the\r\nmark in chiding his younger as he was in lauding the talents and virtues\r\nof his elder son. But it is certain that on several occasions the\r\nauthorities shared Cardan's view of Aldo's ill behaviour. More than once\r\nhe alludes to the young reprobate's shameful conduct, and the intolerable\r\nannoyance caused by the same. Many of the ancient rights of parents over\r\ntheir children, which might to-day be deemed excessive, were still\r\noperative in the cities of Italy, and Cardan readily invoked the help of\r\nthem in trying to work reformation of a sort upon Aldo, whom he caused to\r\nbe imprisoned more than once, and finally to be banished.[213] The\r\nnumerous hitches which delayed his final call to Bologna were probably due\r\nto the fact that a certain party amongst the teachers there were opposed\r\nto his appointment, and things did not run too smoothly after he had taken\r\nup his residence in his new home. It was not in Cardan's nature, however\r\nmuch he may have been cowed and broken down by misfortune, to mix with men\r\ninimical to himself without letting them have a taste of his quality. He\r\nrecords one skirmish which he had with Fracantiano, the Professor of the\r\nPractice of Medicine, a skirmish which, in its details, resembles so\r\nclosely his encounter with Branda Porro, at Pavia, some time before, that\r\nit suggests a doubt whether it ever had a separate existence, and was not\r\nsimply a variant of the Branda legend. \"It happened that he (Fracantiano)\r\nwas giving an account of the passage of the gall into the stomach, and was\r\nspeaking in Greek before the whole Academy (he was making the while an\r\nanatomical dissection), when I cried out, 'There is an \"[Greek: ou]\"\r\nwanting in that sentence.' And as he delayed making any correction of his\r\nerror, and I kept on repeating my remark in a low voice, the students\r\ncried out, 'Let the _Codex_ be sent for.' Fracantiano sent for it gladly.\r\nIt was brought at once, and when he came to read the passage, he found\r\nthat what I had affirmed was true to a hair. He spake not another word,\r\nbeing overwhelmed with confusion and astonishment. Moreover the students,\r\nwho had almost compelled me to come to the lecture, were even more\r\nimpressed by what had happened. But from that day forth my opponent\r\navoided all meeting with me; nay, he even gave orders to his servants that\r\nthey should warn him whenever they might see me approaching, and thus he\r\ncontrived that we should never foregather. One day when he was teaching\r\nAnatomy, the students brought me, by a trick, into the room, whereupon he\r\nstraightway fled, and having entangled his feet in his robe, he fell down\r\nheadlong. This accident caused no little confusion, and shortly afterwards\r\nhe left the place, being then a man well advanced in years.\"[214]\r\n\r\nHe had not lived long in Bologna before he was fated to experience another\r\nrepetition of one of the untoward episodes of his past life, to wit the\r\nfall of a house. It was not his own house this time, but it was\r\nsufficiently near to induce him to change his abode without delay. Next\r\ndoor to the house he had hired in the Via Gombru stood a palace belonging\r\nto a certain Gramigna. \"The entire house fell, and was ruined in a single\r\nnight, and together with the house perished the owner thereof.\" It was\r\nbelieved that this man had divers powerful enemies, and, in order that he\r\nmight secure his position, he contrived to bring certain of his foes into\r\nhis house, having first made a mine of gunpowder under the portico, and\r\nset a match thereto. But for some reason or other the plot miscarried the\r\nnight when he destined to carry it out. Gramigna went to see what was\r\namiss, and at that very moment the mine exploded and brought the house to\r\nthe ground. After this explosion Cardan moved to a house in the Galera\r\nquarter, belonging to the family of Ranucci; but he did not find this\r\ndwelling perfect, as he was forced to vacate the rooms which were most to\r\nhis taste on account of the bad state of the ceilings, the plaster of\r\nwhich, more than once, fell down upon his head.\r\n\r\nIn his _Paralipomena_, \"the last fruit off an old tree,\" which he put\r\ntogether about this time, there are numerous stories of prodigies and\r\nportents; of doors which would not close, and doors which opened of their\r\nown accord; of rappings on the walls, and of mysterious thunderings and\r\nnoises during the night. He tells, at length, the story, already referred\r\nto, of the strange thing which happened to him, on the eve of his\r\ndeparture from Pavia in 1562, while he was awaiting tidings from Rome as\r\nto his appointment at Bologna. \"I wore on the index finger of my right\r\nhand a selenite stone set in a ring, and on my left a jacinth, which I\r\nnever took off my finger, this stone being large and hexagonal in shape.\r\nI took the selenite from my finger and put it beneath my pillow, for I\r\nfancied it kept off sleep, wearing still the jacinth because it appeared\r\nto have the opposite effect. I slept until midnight, when I awoke and\r\nmissed the ring from my left hand. I called Jacopo Antonio, a boy of\r\nfifteen years of age who acted as my servant and slept in a truckle bed,\r\nand bade him look for my rings. He found the selenite at once where I had\r\nplaced it; but though we both of us sought closely for the jacinth we\r\ncould not find it. I was sorrowful to death on account of this omen, and\r\ndespair seized upon my soul when I remembered the dire consequences of\r\nsimilar signs, all of which I had duly noted in my writings. I could\r\nscarcely believe this to be a thing happening in the order of nature.\r\nAfter a short delay I collected my thoughts, and told the servant to bring\r\na light from the hearth. He replied that he would rather not do this, that\r\nhe was afraid of the darkness, and that the fire was always extinguished\r\nin the evening. I bade him light a candle with the flint, when he told me\r\nthat we had neither matches nor tinder nor sulphur. I persisted, and\r\ndetermined that a light should be got by one means or another, for I knew\r\nthat, if I should go to sleep under so dire an omen, I must needs perish.\r\nSo I ordered him to get a light as best he could. He went away and raked\r\nup the ashes, and found a bit of coal about the bigness of a cherry all\r\nalight, and caught hold of it with the tongs. At the same time I had\r\nlittle hope of getting a light, but he applied it to the wick of a lamp\r\nand blew thereon. The wick was lighted without any flame issuing from the\r\nlive coal, which thing seemed to me a further marvel.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a search with the candle the ring was found on the floor under the\r\nmiddle of the bed, but the marvel was not yet worked out: the ring could\r\nnot possibly have got into such a place unless it had been put there by\r\nhand. It could not have rolled there, on account of its shape, nor could\r\nit have fallen from the bed, because the pillow was closely joined to the\r\nhead of the bed, round which ran a raised edge with no rift therein.\r\nCardan concludes: \"I know that much may be said over this matter, but\r\nnothing, forsooth, which will convince a man, ever so little inclined to\r\nsuperstition, that there was no boding sign manifested thereby,\r\nforetelling the ruin of my position and good name. Then, having soothed my\r\nmind, albeit I was well-nigh hopeless, I consoled myself with the belief\r\nthat God still protected me.\" After pondering long and anxiously over the\r\npossible significance of this sign he took a more sanguine view of the\r\nfuture. He next put the jacinth ring on his finger and bade the boy try to\r\npull it off, but he tried in vain, so well and closely did the ring fit\r\nthe finger. From this time forth Cardan laid aside this ring, after having\r\nworn it for many years as a safeguard against lightning, plague,\r\nwakefulness, and palpitation of the heart.[215]\r\n\r\nMany other instances of a like character might be given from the\r\n_Paralipomena_; but the foregoing will suffice to show that the natural\r\ninclination of Cardan's temper towards the marvellous had been aggravated\r\nby his recent troubles. Also the belief that all men's hands were against\r\nhim never slumbered, but for this disposition there may well have been\r\nsome justification. Scarcely had he settled in Bologna before an intrigue\r\nwas set in motion against him. \"After the events aforesaid, and after I\r\nhad gone to teach in Bologna, my adversaries, by a trick, managed to\r\ndeprive me of the use of a class-room, that is to say they allotted to me\r\nan hour just about the time of dinner, or they gave the class-room at the\r\nvery same hour, or a little earlier, to another teacher. When I perceived\r\nthat the authorities were unwilling to accede to three distinct\r\npropositions which I made to them, namely, that this other teacher should\r\nbegin his lecture sooner and leave off sooner: or that he should teach\r\nalternately with me: I so far got my own way at the next election that the\r\nother lecturer had to do his teaching elsewhere.\"[216]\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the intrigues, of which Cardan gives so many\r\ninstances, must have been the work of certain individuals, jealous of his\r\nfame and perhaps smarting under some caustic speech or downright insult,\r\nrather than of the authorities; the Senate of Bologna showed no hostility\r\nto him, but on the other hand procured for him the privileges of\r\ncitizenship. While the negotiations were going on at Bologna for the\r\nfurther regulation of his position as a teacher, he tells a strange story\r\nhow, on three or four different occasions, certain men came to him by\r\nnight, in the name of the Senate and of the Judicial officers, and tried\r\nto induce him to recommend that a certain woman, who had been condemned\r\nfor blasphemy, and for poisoning or witchcraft as well, should be\r\npardoned, both by the temporal and spiritual authorities, bringing forward\r\nspecially the argument that, in the sight of philosophers, such things as\r\ndemons and spirits did not exist. They likewise urged him to procure the\r\nrelease from prison of another woman, who had not yet been condemned,\r\nbecause a certain sick man had died under the hands of some other doctors.\r\nThey brought also a lot of nativities for him to read, as if he had been\r\na soothsayer, and not a teacher of medicine, but he would have nothing to\r\nsay to them.[217]\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat strange that Cardan should have detected no trace of the\r\nsnare of the enemy in this manoeuvre. Bearing in mind the character of the\r\nrequest made, and the fact that Cardan was by no means a _persona grata_\r\nto the petitioners, it seems highly probable that they might have been\r\nmore anxious to draw from Cardan a profession of his disbelief in\r\nwitchcraft, than to procure the enlargement of the accused persons whose\r\ncause they had nominally espoused. At this period it was indeed dangerous\r\nto be a wizard, but it was perhaps still more dangerous to pose as an\r\navowed sceptic of witchcraft. At the end of the fifteenth century the\r\nfrequency of executions for sorcery in the north of Italy had provoked a\r\nstrong outburst of popular feeling against this wanton bloodshed; but\r\nSpina, writing in the interest of orthodox religion, deplores that\r\ndisbelief in the powers of Evil and their manifestations, always\r\nrecognized by the Church, should have led men on to profess by their\r\naction any doubt as to the truth of witchcraft. But in spite of the\r\nfulminations of men of this sort, from this time onwards the more\r\nenlightened scholars of Europe began to modify their opinions on the\r\nsubject of demoniac possession, and of witchcraft in general. The first\r\nbook in which the new views were enunciated was the treatise _De\r\nPræstigiis Dæmonum_, by Johann Wier, a physician of Cleves, published in\r\n1563. The step in advance taken by this reformer was not a revolutionary\r\none. He simply denied that witches were willing and conscious instruments\r\nof the malefic powers, asserting that what evil they wrought came about by\r\nreason of the delusions with which the evil spirits infected the persons\r\nsaid to be possessed. The devil afflicted his victims directly, and then\r\nthrew the suspicion of the evil deed upon some old woman. Wier's book was\r\ncondemned and denounced by the clergy--he himself was a Protestant--but\r\nthe most serious counterblast against it came from the pen of Jean Bodin,\r\nthe illustrious French philosopher and jurist. He held up Wier to\r\nexecration as an impious blasphemer, and asserted that the welfare of\r\nChristendom must needs suffer great injury through the dissemination of\r\ndoctrines so detestable as those set forth in his book.[218]\r\n\r\nSeeing that such a spirit was dominant in the minds of men like Bodin, it\r\nwill be evident that a charge of impiety or atheism might well follow a\r\nprofession of disbelief, or even scepticism, as to the powers of witches\r\nor of evil spirits. A maxim familiar as an utterance of Sir Thomas Browne,\r\n\"Ubi tres medici duo athei,\" was, no doubt, in common use in Cardan's\r\ntime; and he, as a doctor, would consequently be ill-looked upon by the\r\nchampions of orthodoxy, who would certainly not be conciliated by the fact\r\nthat he was the friend of Cardinal Morone. This learned and enlightened\r\nprelate had been imprisoned by the savage and fanatical Paul IV., on a\r\ncharge of favouring opinions analogous to Protestantism, but Pius IV., the\r\neasy-going Milanese jurisconsult, turned ecclesiastic, enlarged him by one\r\nof the first acts of his Papacy, and restored him to the charge of the\r\ndiocese of Modena.\r\n\r\nBesides enjoying at Bologna the patronage of princes of the Church like\r\nBorromeo and Morone, Cardan found there an old friend in Ludovico\r\nFerrari, who was at this time lecturing on mathematics. He also received\r\ninto his house a new pupil, a Bolognese youth named Rodolfo Sylvestro, who\r\nwas destined hereafter to bring as great credit to his teacher's name in\r\nMedicine as Ferrari had already brought thereto in Mathematics. Rodolfo\r\nproved to be one of the most faithful and devoted of friends; he remained\r\nat Bologna as long as Cardan continued to live there, sharing his master's\r\nill-fortune, and ultimately accompanied him to Rome in 1571. He gives the\r\nnames of two other Bolognese students, Giulio Pozzo and Camillo Zanolino,\r\nbut of all his surviving pupils he rates Sylvestro as the most gifted.\r\n\r\nThe records of Cardan's life at this period are scant and fragmentary, few\r\nevents being chronicled except dreams and portents. In giving an account\r\nof one of these manifestations, which happened in September 1563, he\r\nincidentally lets light upon certain changes and vicissitudes in his own\r\naffairs. He was at this time living in an apartment in the house of the\r\nRanucci, next door to a half-ruined palace of the Ghislieri. One night he\r\nawoke from sleep, and found that the neck-band of his shirt had become\r\nentangled with the cord by which he kept his precious emerald and a\r\nwritten charm suspended round his neck. He tried to disentangle the knot,\r\nbut in vain, so he left the complication as it was, purposing to unravel\r\nit by daylight. He did not fall asleep; but, after lying quiet for a\r\nlittle, he determined to attempt once more whether he could undo the knot,\r\nwhen he found that everything was clear, and the stone under his armpit.\r\n\"This sign showed me an unhoped-for solution of certain weighty\r\ndifficulties, and at the same time proved, as I have often said elsewhere,\r\nthat there must have been present something else unperceived by me. For\r\nmy affairs were in this condition: my son-in-law at Milan had the\r\nadministration of the scant remains of my property, and I received no\r\nrents therefrom for a whole year. My literary work was lying at the\r\nprinter's, but it was not printed. Here, at Bologna, I was forced to\r\nlecture without having a fixed hour assigned to me. A crowd of enemies\r\nwere intriguing against me. My son Aldo was in prison, and of little\r\nprofit to me. But immediately after this portent I learned that my two\r\nchief opponents were either dying or about to retire. The question of the\r\nlecture-room was settled amicably, so that for the next year I was able to\r\nlive in quiet. These two matters having come to an issue, I will next\r\ndescribe what came to pass with regard to the others.\r\n\r\n\"During the next July (1564), through the help of Francesco Alciati,[219]\r\nthe secretary of Pope Pius IV., a man to whom I am indebted for almost\r\nevery benefit I have received since 1561, I began to enjoy my own again.\r\nOn August 26 I received from the printer my books all printed with the\r\ngreatest care, and by reason of the dispatch of this business my income\r\nwas greatly increased. The next day my chief opponent resigned his office,\r\nand left vacant a salary of seven hundred gold crowns. The only\r\nmanifestation of adverse fortune left to trouble me was the conspiracy of\r\nthe doctors against me, but there were already signs that this would\r\ndisappear before long, and in sooth it came to an end after the lapse of\r\nanother year.\"[220]\r\n\r\nDuring this portion of his life at Bologna, Cardan seems to have lived\r\ncomparatively alone, and to have spent his weary leisure in brooding over\r\nhis sorrows. He began his long rambling epilogue to the _De Libris\r\nPropriis_, and, almost on the threshold, pours out his sorrow afresh over\r\nGian Battista's unhappy fate. After affirming that Death must necessarily\r\ncome as a friend to those whose lives are wretched, he begins to speculate\r\nwhether, after all, he ought not to rejoice rather than mourn over his\r\nson's death. \"Certes he is rid of this miserable life of danger and\r\ndifficulty, vain, sorrowful, brief, and inconstant; these times in which\r\nthe major part of the good things of the world fall to the trickster's\r\nshare, and all may be enjoyed by those who are backed up by wealth or\r\npower or favour. Power is good when it is in the hands of those who use it\r\nwell, but it is a great evil when murderers and poisoners are allowed to\r\nwield it. To the ill-starred, to the ungodly, and to the foolish, death is\r\na boon, freeing them from numberless dangers, from heavy griefs, from\r\nfatal troubles, and from infamy; wherefore in such cases it ought not to\r\nbe spoken of as something merely good or indifferent, but rated as the\r\nbest of fortune. Shall I not declare to God (for He willed the deed), to\r\nmyself, and to my surviving family, that my son's death was a thing to be\r\ndesired, for God does all justly, wisely, and lovingly? He lets me stand\r\nas an example to show others that a good and upright man cannot be\r\naltogether wretched. I am poor, infirm, and old; bereaved by a cruel wrong\r\nof my best-loved son, a youth of the fairest promise, and left only with\r\nthe faintest hope of any ray of future good fortune, or of seeing my race\r\nperpetuated after my death, for my daughter, who has been nine years\r\nmarried, is barren.\r\n\r\n\"At one time I was prosperous in every relation of life: in my\r\nfriendships, in my children, and in my health. In my youth I seemed to be\r\none raised up to realize the highest hopes. I was accustomed to all the\r\ngood things--nay, to all the luxuries of life. Now I am wretched,\r\ndespised, with foes swarming around me; I not only count myself miserable,\r\nI feel I am far more miserable now than I was happy aforetime. Yet I\r\nneither lose my wits nor make any boast, as my actions prove. I do my work\r\nas a teacher with my mind closely set on the matter in question, and for\r\nthis reason I attract a large number of hearers. I manage my affairs\r\nbetter than heretofore; and, if any man shall compare the book which I\r\nhave lately published with those which I wrote some time ago, he will not\r\nfail to perceive how vastly my intellect has gained in richness, in\r\nvivacity, and in purity.\"\r\n\r\nThough the note of sorrow or even of despair is perceptible in these\r\nsentences, there is no sign that the virile and elastic spirit of the\r\nwriter is broken. But there are manifest signs of an increasing tendency\r\ntowards mental detachment from the world which had used him so ill. With\r\nthe happiest of men the almost certain prospect of extinction at the end\r\nof a dozen years usually tends to foster the growth of a conviction that\r\nthe world after all is a poor affair, and that to quit it is no great\r\nevil. How strongly therefore must reflections of a kindred nature have\r\nworked upon a man so cruelly tried as Cardan!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[211] _Opera_, tom. x. p. 462.\r\n\r\n[212] \"Sed filius minor natu adeò malè se gessit, ut malim transire in\r\nnepotem ex primo filio.\"--_De Vita Propria_, ch. xxxvi. p. 112.\r\n\r\n[213] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xxvii. p. 71.\r\n\r\n[214] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xii. p. 40.\r\n\r\n[215] _Opera_, tom. x. p. 459.\r\n\r\n[216] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xvii. p. 56.\r\n\r\n[217] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xxiii. p. 104.\r\n\r\n[218] This opinion prevailed with men of learning far into the next\r\ncentury. Sir Thomas Browne writes: \"They that doubt of these, do not only\r\ndeny them, but spirits; and are obliquely and upon consequence a sect not\r\nof infidels, but atheists.\"--_Religio Medici, Works_, vol. ii. p. 89.\r\n\r\n[219] This was the Cardinal, the nephew of Andrea the great jurist, who\r\nwas also a good friend of Cardan.\r\n\r\n[220] _Opera_, tom. x. p. 463.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the beginning of the year 1565 Cardan had a narrow escape from death by\r\nburning, for his bed from some unknown cause caught fire twice in the same\r\nnight while he was asleep. The servant was disturbed by the smoke, and\r\nhaving aroused his master, told him what was amiss, whereupon Cardan flew\r\ninto a violent rage, for he deemed that the youth must be drunk. But he\r\nsoon perceived the danger, and then they both set to work to extinguish\r\nthe flames. His own description of the occurrence is highly\r\ncharacteristic. \"Having put out the fire, I settled myself again to sleep,\r\nand, while I was dreaming of alarms, and that I was flying from some\r\ndanger, it happened that either these terrifying dreams, or the fire and\r\nsmoke again aroused me, and, looking around, I found that the bed was once\r\nmore alight, and the greater part of it consumed. The vari-coloured\r\ncoverlet, the leather hangings, and all the covering of the bed was\r\nunhurt. Thus this great alarm and danger and serious disturbance caused\r\nonly a trifling loss; less than half of the bed-linen was burnt, but the\r\nblankets were entirely consumed. On the first alarm the flames burnt out\r\ntwice or thrice with little smoke, and caused scarcely any damage. The\r\nsecond time the fire and the mishap forced me to rise just before dawn,\r\nthe fire lasting altogether about seven hours.\"\r\n\r\nThere was naturally a warning sign to be found in this accident.[221] The\r\nsmoke, Cardan said, denoted disgrace; the fire, peril and fear; the flame,\r\na grave and pressing danger to his life. The smouldering fire signified\r\nsecret plots which were to be put into execution against him by his\r\nservants while he lay in bed. And the fact that he set fire to the bed\r\nhimself, denoted that he would be able to meet any coming danger alone and\r\nwithout assistance. The indictment against him was foreshadowed by the\r\nfire and the flames and the smoke. Poison and assault were not to be\r\nfeared. Men might indeed ask questions as to what kind of danger it could\r\nbe which only arose from those about him, and fell short of poison and\r\nviolence. The fire, he goes on to say, signifies the Magistrate. More than\r\nonce it seemed to be extinct, but it always revived. Danger seemed to\r\nthreaten him less from open hostility than from the cunning flattery of\r\nfoes, and from over-confidence on his own part. His books, which he had\r\nlately caused to be printed, appeared to be in grave peril, but a graver\r\none overhung his life. He deemed that he would quit the tribunal condemned\r\nby the empty scandal of the crowd, suffering no slight loss, and worsted\r\nchiefly through putting faith in false friends, and through his own\r\ninstability. On the whole, the loss would prove inconsiderable; the danger\r\nmoderate, but the vexation exceedingly heavy. These results might have\r\nsprung from causes other than natural ones; but, on the other hand, such\r\nthings often come about through chance. They might prove to be a warning\r\nto him to keep clear of hostile prejudice, and to make friends of those\r\nin authority, care being taken not to let himself become involved in their\r\nprivate affairs, and not to seek too close an acquaintance.[222]\r\n\r\nUp to this date, Cardan, when he visited his patients, had either walked\r\nor ridden a mule. In 1562 he began to use a carriage, but this change of\r\nhabit brought ill luck with it, for, in this same year, his horses ran\r\naway; he was thrown out of the vehicle, and sustained an injury to one of\r\nthe fingers of his right hand, and to the right arm as well.[223] The\r\nfinger soon healed, but the damage to the right arm shifted itself over to\r\nthe left side, leaving the right arm sound. The foregoing details, taken\r\nchiefly from the _Paralipomena_ (Book III. ch. xii.), are somewhat\r\nsignificant in respect to the serious trouble which came upon him soon\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nThough he had now secured a class-room for himself, the malice of his\r\nenemies was not yet abated. Just before the end of his term, certain of\r\nthem went to Cardinal Morone and told him that it would be inexpedient to\r\nallow Cardan to retain his Professorship any longer, seeing that scarcely\r\nany pupils went to listen to him. The terms Cardan used in describing this\r\nhostile movement against him,[224] rouse a suspicion that there may have\r\nbeen some ground for the assertion of his adversaries; but he declares\r\nthat, at any rate, he had a good many pupils from the beginning of the\r\nsession up to the time of Lent. He gives no clue whereby the date of this\r\nintrigue may be exactly ascertained, but it probably happened near the end\r\nof his sojourn at Bologna, because in his account of it he describes\r\nlikewise the cessation of his public teaching, and makes no mention of any\r\nresumption of the same. He declares that he was at last overborne by the\r\nmultitude of his foes, and their cunning plots. Under the pretence that,\r\nin seeking Cardan's removal, they were really acting for his benefit, they\r\nsucceeded in bringing Cardinal Morone round to their views. Cardan's final\r\nwords in dealing with this matter help to fix the date of this episode as\r\nsome time in 1570. Speaking of his enemies, he writes: \"Nay indeed they\r\nhave given me greater leisure for the codification of my books, they have\r\nlengthened my days, they have increased my fame, and, by procuring my\r\nremoval from the work which was too laborious for me, they secured for me\r\nthe pleasure I now enjoy in the discovery and investigation of divers of\r\nthe secrets of Nature. Therefore I constantly tell myself that I do not\r\nhate these men, nor deem them blameworthy, because they wrought me an ill\r\nturn, but because of the malignancy they had in their hearts.\"[225]\r\n\r\nIt is almost certain that this removal of Cardan from his office of\r\nteacher was part and parcel of a carefully-devised plot against him, and a\r\nprelude to more serious trouble in the near future. Early in April 1570 he\r\nhad occasion to put into writing a certain medical opinion which was to be\r\nsent to Cardinal Morone. He describes the episode: \"It chanced that one of\r\nthe sheets of my manuscript fell from the table down upon the floor, and\r\nthen flew by itself up to the cornice of the room, where it hung, fixed to\r\nthe woodwork. Greatly amazed, I called for Rodolfo, and pointed out to him\r\nthis marvel. He did not indeed see it fly up, and at that time I was\r\nignorant as to what it might foretell, for I had no foreboding of the many\r\nills which were about to molest me. But now I see that the meaning of this\r\nportent must have been that, after the approaching shipwreck of my\r\nfortunes, my bark would be sped along with a more favouring breeze. It was\r\nduring the month following, unless I am mistaken, that, when I was once\r\nmore writing a letter to Cardinal Morone, I looked for a certain\r\npowder-box which had been missing for some long time, and, when I lifted\r\nup a sheet of paper in order to powder it with dust gathered up from the\r\nfloor of the room, there was the powder-box, hidden beneath the sheet. How\r\ncould it have come there on the level writing-desk? This sign confirmed\r\nthe hope I had already conceived of the Cardinal's wisdom and humanity;\r\nthat he would plead with the Pope, the best of men, in such wise that I\r\nshould find a prosperous end to my toilsome life.\"[226]\r\n\r\nThe blow thus foreshadowed fell on October 6, 1570, when he was suddenly\r\narrested and put under restraint. He speaks of a bond which he gave for\r\neighteen hundred gold crowns; and says that, while he was in hold, all his\r\nestate was administered by the civil authorities. Rodolfo Sylvestro was\r\nconstantly with him during his incarceration, and on January 1, 1571, he\r\nwas released, just at nightfall, and allowed to return to his own house.\r\nWhile he was in prison in the month of October some mysterious knockings\r\nat the door supplied him with a fulfilment and explanation of the\r\nportents lately chronicled. The knockings appeared furthermore to warn him\r\nof approaching death, and he began to bewail his misery; but, having\r\ngathered courage, he heartened himself to face his doom, which could be\r\nnothing worse than death. Young men, leaders of armies, courted death in\r\nbattle to win the favour of their sovereigns; wherefore he, a decrepit old\r\nman, might surely await his end with calmness. He then wanders off into a\r\nlong disquisition on the philosophy of Polybius, and forgets entirely to\r\nset down further details of his imprisonment, or to explain the cause\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nPius IV. had died at the end of 1565, and had been succeeded by Michele\r\nGhislieri, the Cardinal of Alessandria, as Pius V. Like his predecessor,\r\nthe new Pope was a Milanese by birth, but in character and aims the two\r\nPopes were entirely different. Pius. V. identified himself completely with\r\nthe work of the Holy Office, and straightway set in operation all its\r\npowers for the extirpation of the heretical opinions which, on account of\r\nthe easy-going character of the late Pope, had made much progress in\r\nItaly, and nowhere more than in Bologna. Von Ranke, in the _History of the\r\nPopes_, gives an extract (vol. i. p. 97) from the compendium of the\r\nInquisitors, which sets forth that \"Bologna was in a very perilous state,\r\nbecause there the heretics were especially numerous; amongst them was a\r\ncertain Gian Battista Rotto, who enjoyed the friendship and support of\r\nmany persons of weight, such as Morone, Pole, and the Marchesa Pescara\r\n(Vittoria Colonna). Rotto made himself very active in collecting money,\r\nwhich he distributed amongst the poor folk of Bologna who were heretics.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in 1562, while he was waiting in Milan for the\r\nappointment as Professor at Bologna, Cardan submitted his books to the\r\nCongregation of the Index for approval. He was known to be a\r\nfellow-citizen and friend of the reigning Pope: the _corpus_ of his work\r\nhad by that time reached a portentous size, wherefore it is quite possible\r\nthat the official readers may have been lenient, or cursory, over their\r\nwork; but when Pius V., the strenuous ascetic foe of heresy, stepped into\r\nthe place of the indolent Pius IV., jurist and politician rather than\r\nChurchman, it is more than probable that certain amateur inquisitors at\r\nBologna, fully as anxious to work Cardan's ruin as to safeguard the faith,\r\nmay have busied themselves in hunting through his various works for\r\npassages upon which to base a charge of unorthodoxy. Such passages were\r\nnot hard to find. There was the horoscope of Jesus Christ, which\r\nsubsequently affronted the piety of De Thou. There was the passage already\r\nnoticed in which he said such hard things of the Dominicans (_De Varietate\r\nRerum_, 1557, p. 572). He had indeed disclaimed it, but there it stood\r\nunexpunged in the subsequent editions of the book; and, while considering\r\nthis detail, it may be remarked that Pius V. began his career as a member\r\nof the Dominican Order, the practices of which Cardan had impugned. In the\r\nfirst and second editions of the _De Subtilitate_ was another passage in\r\nwhich the tenets of Islam and the circumstances of the birth of Christ\r\nwere handled in a way which caused grave scandal and offence.[227] This\r\npassage indeed was expunged in the edition of 1560. The _Paralipomena_\r\nwere not in print and available, but what can be read in them to-day\r\ndoubtless reflects with accuracy the attitude of Cardan's mind towards\r\nreligious matters in 1570. Though the _Paralipomena_ were locked in his\r\ndesk, it is almost certain that the spirit with which they were inspired\r\nwould have infected Cardan's brain, and prompted him to repeat in words\r\nthe views on religion and a future state which he had already put on\r\npaper, for he rarely let discretion interfere with the enunciation of any\r\nopinion he favoured. In the _Paralipomena_ are many passages written in\r\nthe spirit of universalism, and treating of the divine principle as\r\nsomething which animates wise men alone, wise men and philosophers of\r\nevery age and every clime, Aristotle being the head and chief. Plato and\r\nSocrates and the Seven Sages adorn this illustrious circle, which includes\r\nlikewise the philosophers of Chaldea and Egypt. Opinions like these were\r\nno longer the passport to Papal favour or even toleration. The age of the\r\nhumanist Popes was past, and the Puritan movement, stimulated into life by\r\nthe active competition of the Reformers, was beginning to show its\r\nstrength, so that a man who spoke in terms of respect or reverence\r\nconcerning Averroes or Plato would put himself in no light peril. Thus for\r\nthose of Cardan's enemies who were minded to search and listen it must\r\nhave been an easy task to formulate against him a charge of heresy,\r\nspecious enough to carry conviction to such a burning zealot as Pius V.\r\nThis Pope, in his new regulations for the maintenance of Church\r\ndiscipline, requisitioned the services of physicians in the detection of\r\nlaxity of religious practices, or of unsoundness. \"We forbid,\" he says in\r\none of his bulls, \"every physician, who may be called to the bedside of a\r\npatient, to visit for more than three days, unless he receives an\r\nattestation that the sick man has made fresh confession of his sins.\"[228]\r\nCardan, with his irritable temper, may very likely have treated this\r\nregulation as an unwarrantable interference with his profession, and have\r\npaid no attention to it. Again, he evidently followed Hippocrates in\r\nrejecting the supernatural origin of disease; a position greatly in\r\nadvance of that held by certain of the leading physiologists of the\r\ntime.[229] Thus in more ways than one he may have laid himself open to\r\nsome charge of disrespect shown to religion or to the spiritual powers.\r\nThe absence of any other specific accusation and the circumstances of his\r\nincarceration, taken in conjunction with the foregoing considerations,\r\nalmost compel the conclusion that his arrest and imprisonment in 1570 were\r\nbrought about by a charge of impiety whispered by some envious tongue\r\nwhich will never now be identified. The sanction given by the authorities\r\nof the Church to his writings in 1562, operated without doubt to mitigate\r\nthe punishment which fell upon him, and suffered him, after due purgation\r\nof his offences, to enjoy for the residue of his days a life comparatively\r\nquiet and prosperous under the patronage of Pius V.\r\n\r\nThough he was let out of prison he was not yet a free man. For some twelve\r\nweeks longer he remained a prisoner in his own house, the bond for\r\neighteen hundred gold crowns having doubtless been given on this account.\r\nAlmost his last reflection about his life at Bologna is one in which he\r\nrecords his satisfaction that all the men who plotted against him there\r\nmet their death soon after their attempt, thus sharing the fate of his\r\nenemies at Milan and Pavia. If he is to be believed in this matter, the\r\nFates, though they might not shield him from attack, proved themselves to\r\nbe diligent and remorseless avengers of his wrongs. At the end of\r\nSeptember he turned his back upon Bologna and the cold hospitality it had\r\ngiven him, and set forth on his last journey. He travelled by easy stages,\r\nand entered Rome on October 7, 1571, the day upon which Don John of\r\nAustria annihilated the Turkish fleet at Lepanto.\r\n\r\nThere are evidences in his later writings beyond those already cited, that\r\nCardan's views on religion had undergone change during his sojourn at\r\nBologna. It was the custom, even with theologians of the time, to\r\nillustrate freely from the classics, wherefore the spectacle of the names\r\nof the great men of Greek and Roman letters, scattered thickly about the\r\npages of any book, would not prove or even suggest unorthodoxy. Cardan\r\nquotes Plato or Aristotle or Plotinus twenty times for any saint in the\r\nCalendar. He does not mention the Virgin more than once or twice in the\r\nwhole of the _De Vita Propria_; and, in discoursing on the immortality of\r\nthe soul, he cites the opinion of Avicenna, but makes no mention of either\r\nsaint or father.[230] The world of classic thought was immeasurably nearer\r\nand more real to Cardan than it can be to any modern dweller beyond the\r\nAlps: to him there had been no solution of continuity between classic\r\ntimes and his own. When he sat down to write in the _Theonoston_ his\r\nmeditations on the death of his son, in the vain hope of reaping\r\nconsolation therefrom, he invoked the golden rule of Plotinus, which lays\r\ndown that the future is foreseen and arranged by the gods. Being thus\r\narranged, it must needs be just, for God is the highest expression of\r\njustice. Against a fate thus settled for us we have no right to complain,\r\nlest we should seem to be setting ourselves into opposition to God's will.\r\nHere, although he writes in the spirit of a Christian, the authority cited\r\nis that of a heathen philosopher, and the form of his meditations is taken\r\nrather from Seneca than from father or schoolman. The devotional bias of\r\nCardan's nature seems to have been strengthened temporarily by the\r\nterrible experiences of Gian Battista's trial and death; but in the course\r\nof his residence at Bologna a marked reaction set in, and the fervent\r\nreligious outburst, in which he sought consolation during his intolerable\r\nsorrow, was succeeded by a calmer mood which regarded the necessary evils\r\nof life as transitory accidents, and death as the one and certain end of\r\nsorrow, and perhaps of consciousness as well. What he wrote during his\r\nresidence in Rome he kept in manuscript; his recent experience at Bologna\r\nwarned him that, living under the shadow of the Vatican with Pius V. as\r\nthe ruler thereof, it behoved him to walk as an obedient son of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nCardan went first to live in the Piazza di San Girolamo, not far from the\r\nPorto del Popolo, but subsequently he lived in a house in the Via Giulia\r\nnear the church of Santa Maria di Monserrato, where probably he died. He\r\nhad not long been settled in Rome before he was able to add a fresh\r\nsupernatural experience to his already overburdened list. In the month of\r\nAugust 1572 he was lying awake one night with a lamp burning, when\r\nsuddenly he heard a loud noise to the right of the chamber, as if a cart\r\nladen with planks was being unloaded. He looked up, and, the door being\r\nopen at the time, he perceived a peasant entering the room. Just as he\r\nwas on the threshold the intruder uttered the words, \"_Te sin casa_,\" and\r\nstraightway vanished. This apparition puzzled him greatly, and he alludes\r\nto it again in chapter xlvii. of the _De Vita Propria_. Ultimately he\r\ndismisses it with the remark that the explanation of such phenomena is\r\nrather the duty of theologians than of philosophers.\r\n\r\nWith regard to matters of religious belief he seems to have taken as a\r\nrule of conduct the remark above written, and left them to the care of\r\nprofessional experts, for very few of his recorded opinions throw any\r\nlight upon his views of the dogmas and doctrines of the Church. Whatever\r\nthe tenor of these opinions may have been, he never proclaimed them\r\ndefinitely. Probably they interested him little, for he was not the man to\r\nkeep silent over a subject which he had greatly at heart. He gave a\r\ngeneral assent to the teaching of the Church, taking up the mental\r\nattitude of the vast majority of the learned men of his time, and expected\r\nthat the Church would do all that was necessary for him in its own\r\nparticular province. If he regarded Erasmus and Luther as disturbers of\r\nthe faith and heretics, he did not say so, nor did he censure their\r\nactivity. (Erasmus he praises highly in the opening words of the horoscope\r\nwhich he drew for him.--_Gen. Ex.,_ p. 496.) But he had certainly no\r\ndesire to emulate them or give them his support. The world of letters and\r\nscience was wide enough even for his active spirit; the world lying behind\r\nthe veil he left to the exploration of those inquirers who might have a\r\ntaste for such a venture. Still every page of his life's record shows how\r\nstrong was his bent towards the supernatural; but the phase of the\r\nsupernatural which he chose for study was one which Churchmen, as a rule,\r\nhad let alone. Spirits wandering about this world were of greater moment\r\nto him than spirits fixed in beatitude or bane in the next; and\r\naccordingly, whenever he finds an opportunity, he discourses of\r\napparitions, lamiæ, incubi, succubi, malignant and beneficent genii, and\r\nthe methods of invoking them. Now that old age was pressing heavily upon\r\nhim and he began to yearn for support, he sought consolation not in the\r\necstatic vision of the fervent Catholic, but in fostering the belief that\r\nhe was in sooth under the protection of some guardian spirit like that\r\nwhich had attended his father and divers of the sages of old. Although he\r\nhad in his earlier days treated his father's belief with a certain degree\r\nof respect and credence,[231] there is no evidence that he was possessed\r\nwith the notion that any such supernatural guardian attended his own\r\nfootsteps at the time when he put together the _De Varietate_; indeed it\r\nwould seem that his belief was exactly the opposite. He writes as follows:\r\n\"It is first of all necessary to know that there is one God, the Author of\r\nall good, by whose power all things were made, and in whose name all good\r\nthings are brought to pass; also, that if a man shall err he need not be\r\nguilty of sin. That there is no other to whom we owe anything or whom we\r\nare bound to worship or serve. If we keep these sayings with a pure mind\r\nwe shall be kept pure ourselves and free from sin. What a demon may be I\r\nknow not, these beings I neither recognize nor love. I worship one God,\r\nand Him alone I serve. And in truth these things ought not to be published\r\nin the hearing of unlearned folk; for, if once this belief in spirits be\r\ntaken up, it may easily come to pass that they who apply themselves to\r\nsuch arts will attribute God's work to the devil.\"[232] And in another\r\nplace: \"I of a truth know of no spirit or genius which attends me; but\r\nshould one come to me, after being warned of the same in dreams, if it\r\nshould be given to me by God, I will still reverence God alone; to Him\r\nalone will I give thanks, for any benefit which may befall me, as the\r\nbountiful source and principle of all good. And, in sooth, the spirit may\r\nrest untroubled if I repay my debt to our common Master. I know full well\r\nthat He has given to me, for my good genius, reason, patience in trouble,\r\na good disposition, a disregard of money and dignities, which gifts I use\r\nto the full, and deem them better and greater possessions than the Demon\r\nof Socrates.\"[233]\r\n\r\nAbout the Demon of Socrates Cardan has much to say in the _De Varietate_.\r\nHe never even hints a doubt as to the veracity and sincerity of Socrates.\r\nHe is quite sure that Socrates was fully persuaded of the reality of his\r\nattendant genius, and favours the view that this belief may have been well\r\nfounded. He takes an agnostic position,[234] confining his positive\r\nstatement to an assertion of his own inability to realize the presence of\r\nany ghostly minister attendant upon himself. In the _De Subtilitate_ he\r\ntells an experience of his own by way of suggesting that some of the\r\ndemons spoken of by the retailers of marvels might be figments of the\r\nbrain. In 1550 Cardan was called in to see a certain woman who had long\r\nbeen troubled with an obscure disease of the bladder. Every known remedy\r\nwas tried in vain, when one day a certain Josephus Niger,[235] a\r\ndistinguished Greek scholar, went to see the patient. Niger, according to\r\nCardan's account, was quite ignorant of medicine, but he was reputed to be\r\na skilled master of magic arts. The woman had a son, a boy about ten years\r\nold, and Josephus having handed him a three-cornered crystal, which he had\r\nwith him, bade the youth secretly to look into it, and then declare, in\r\nhis mother's hearing, that he could see in the crystal three very terrible\r\ndemons going on foot. Then, after Josephus had whispered certain other\r\nwords in the boy's ear, the boy went on to say that he beheld another\r\ndemon, vastly bigger than the first, riding on horseback and bearing in\r\nhis hand a three-tined fork. This monster overthrew the other demons, and\r\nled them away captive, bound with chains to his saddlebow. After listening\r\nto these words the woman rapidly got well, and Cardan, in commenting on\r\nthe event, declares that she must have been cured either by the agency of\r\nthe demons or by the force of the imagination, inasmuch as it would be\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to invent any other reason of her\r\nrecovery.[236] In another passage of the _De Subtilitate_ he displays\r\njudicious reserve in writing of Demons in general.[237]\r\n\r\nDuring those terrible days, when his son had just died a felon's death,\r\nand when he himself was haunted by the real dangers which beset him, and\r\nalmost maddened by the signs and tokens which seemed to tell of others to\r\ncome, the belief which Fazio his father had nourished easily found a\r\nlodgment in his shaken and bewildered brain. In the _Dialogus de Humanis\r\nConsiliis_, one of the speakers tells of a certain man who is clearly\r\nmeant to be Cardan himself. The speaker goes on to say that he is sure\r\nthis man is attended by a genius, which manifested itself to him somewhat\r\nlate in his life. \"Aforetime, indeed, it had been wont to convey to him\r\nwarnings in dreams and by certain noises. What greater proof of his power\r\ncould there be than the cure of this man, without the use of drugs, of an\r\nintestinal rupture on the right side? If indeed it had not fared with him\r\nthus, after his son's death, he would at once have passed out of this\r\nlife, whereby many and great evils might have come to pass. He was freed\r\nalso from another troublesome ailment. In sooth, so many and so mighty are\r\nthe wonderful things which had befallen him, that I, who am very intimate\r\nwith him (and he himself thinks the same), am constrained to believe that\r\nhe is attended by a genius, great and powerful and rare, and that he is\r\nnot the master of his own actions. What he would have, he has not; and\r\nwhat he has, he would not have chosen, or even wished for. This thing\r\ncauses him much trouble, but he submits when he reflects that all things\r\nare God's handiwork.\" The speaker ends by saying that he never heard of\r\nany others thus attended, save this man, and his father before him, and\r\nSocrates.[238]\r\n\r\nBut it is in chapter xlvii. of the _De Vita Propria_, which must have been\r\nwritten shortly before his death, that he lets the reader see most plainly\r\nhow strong was the hold which this belief in a guardian spirit of his own\r\nhad taken upon him. \"It is an admitted truth,\" he writes, \"that attendant\r\nspirits have protected certain men, to wit, Socrates, Plotinus, Synesius,\r\nDion, Flavius Josephus, and myself. All of these have enjoyed prosperous\r\nlives except Socrates and me, and I, as I have said before, was at one\r\ntime offered many and favourable opportunities for the achievement of\r\nhappiness. But C. Cæsar the dictator, Cicero, Antony, Brutus, and Cassius\r\nwere also attended by mighty spirits, albeit malignant. For a long time I\r\nhave been persuaded that I too had one, but by what method it gave me\r\nintelligence as to events about to happen, I could not exactly ascertain\r\nuntil I reached the seventy-fourth year of my age, the season when I began\r\nto write this record of my life. I now perceive that when I was in Milan\r\nin 1557, when my genius perceived what was hanging over me--how that my\r\nson on that same evening had promised to marry Brandonia Seroni, and that\r\nhe would complete the nuptials the following day--it produced in me that\r\npalpitation of the heart of which I have already made mention, a weakness\r\nknown to my genius alone, a manifestation which served to simulate a\r\ntrembling of the bed.\"\r\n\r\nCardan writes at length to show that the mysterious knocking which he and\r\nRodolfo Sylvestro had heard during his imprisonment at Bologna, the\r\npeasant who entered his bed-chamber saying \"_Te sin casa_,\" and divers\r\nother manifestations, going back as far as 1531--croaking of ravens,\r\nbarking of dogs, and the ignition of fire-wood--must all have been brought\r\nabout by the working of this powerful spirit. In 1570 there happened to\r\nhim one of his everyday experiences of the presence of supernatural\r\npowers. In the middle of the night he was conscious of some presence\r\nwalking about the room. It sat down beside him, and at the same time a\r\nloud noise arose from a chest which stood near. This phenomenon, he\r\nadmits, might well have been the figment of a brain overburdened with\r\nthought; but suddenly his memory flies back to an experience of his\r\ntwentieth year, upon which he proceeds to build a story, wild and fanciful\r\neven for his powers of imagination. \"What man was it,\" he asks, \"who sold\r\nme that copy of Apuleius when I was in my twentieth year, and forthwith\r\nwent away? I indeed, at that time, had made only one essay in the literary\r\narena, and had no knowledge of the Latin tongue; but in spite of this, and\r\nbecause the book had a gilded cover, I was imprudent enough to buy it. The\r\nvery next day I found myself just as well versed in Latin as I am now.\r\nMoreover, almost at the same time I acquired knowledge of Greek and\r\nSpanish and French, sufficient for reading books written in these\r\nlanguages.\"\r\n\r\nCardan was by this time completely possessed by the belief in his\r\nattendant genius, and the flash of memory which recalled the purchase of\r\nsome book or other in his youth, suggested likewise the attribution of\r\ncertain mystic powers to this guardian genius, and conjured up some\r\nfanciful explanation as to the way these powers had been exercised upon\r\nhimself; he, the person most closely concerned, being entirely unconscious\r\nof their operation at the time when they first affected him. This recorded\r\nbelief in a gift of tongues is one of the most convincing bits of evidence\r\nto be gleaned from Cardan's writings of the insanity which undoubtedly\r\nafflicted him, at least periodically, at this crisis of his life.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[221] He mentions this matter briefly in the _De Vita Propria_: \"Bis\r\narsisset lectus, prædixi me non permansurum Bononiæ, et prima vice\r\nrestiti, secunda non potui.\"--ch. xli. p. 151. A fuller account of it is\r\nin _Opera_, tom. x. p. 464.\r\n\r\n[222] _Opera_, tom. x. p. 464.\r\n\r\n[223] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xxx. p. 80. He seems to have had many\r\nuntoward experiences in driving. He tells of another mishap (_Opera_, tom.\r\ni. p. 472) in June 1570; how a fellow, some tipstaff of the courts, jumped\r\ninto his carriage and frightened the mares Cardan was driving, jeering at\r\nthem likewise because they were rather bare of flesh.\r\n\r\n[224] \"Demum sub conductionis fine, voces sparserunt, et maxime apud\r\nMoronum Cardinalem, me exiguo auditorio profiteri, quod quanquam non\r\nomnino verum esset, quinimo ab initio Academiæ multos, et usque ad dies\r\njejunii haberem auditores.\"--_De Vita Propria_, ch. xvii. p. 56.\r\n\r\n[225] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xvii. p. 57.\r\n\r\n[226] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xliii. p. 163.\r\n\r\n[227] \"Alii multis diebus abstinent cibo, alii igne uruntur, ac ferro\r\nsecantur, nullum doloris vestigium preferentes; multi sunt vocem e pectore\r\nmittentes, qui olim engastrimuthi dicebantur; hoc autem maxime eis\r\ncontingit cum orgia quædam exercent, atque circumferuntur in orbem. Quæ\r\ntria ut verissima sunt et naturali ratione mira tamen constant, cujus\r\nsuperius mentionem fecimus, ita illud confictum nasci pueros e mulieribus\r\nabsque concubitu.\"--_De Subtilitate_, p. 353.\r\n\r\n[228] Ranke, _History of the Popes_, vol. i. p. 246.\r\n\r\n[229] Mr. Stephen Paget in his life of Ambroise Paré, the great\r\ncontemporary French surgeon, gives an interesting account of Paré's\r\nbeliefs on the divine cause of the plague, p. 269.\r\n\r\n[230] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xxii. p. 63.\r\n\r\n[231] \"Multa de dæmonibus narrabat, quæ quam vera essent nescio.\"--_De\r\nUtilitate_, p. 348.\r\n\r\n[232] _De Varietate_, p. 351.\r\n\r\n[233] _Ibid.,_ p. 658.\r\n\r\n[234] In his counsel to his children, he writes: \"Do not believe that you\r\nhear demons speak to you, or that you behold the dead. Seek not to learn\r\nthe truth of these things, for they are amongst the things which are\r\nhidden from us.\"\r\n\r\n[235] Cardan alludes to Niger in _De Varietate_, p. 641: \"Referebat\r\naliquando Josephus Niger harum rerum maximé peritus, dæmonem pueris se sub\r\nforma Christi ostendisse, petiisseque ut adoraretur.\"\r\n\r\n[236] _De Subtilitate_, p. 530.\r\n\r\n[237] \"Nolim ego ad trutinam hæc sectari, velut Porphyrius, Psellus,\r\nPlotinus, Proclus, Jamblicus, qui copiose de his quæ non videre, velut\r\nhistoriam natæ rei scripserunt.\"--_De Subtilitate_, p. 540.\r\n\r\n[238] _Opera_, tom. i. 672.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER the accusation brought against him at Milan in 1562, Cardan had been\r\nprohibited from teaching or lecturing in that city, and similar\r\ndisabilities had followed his recent imprisonment at Bologna. At Rome no\r\nduties of this kind awaited him, so he had full time to follow his\r\nphysician's calling after taking up his residence there. He records the\r\ncure of a noble matron, Clementina Massa, and of Cesare Buontempo, a\r\njurisconsult, both of whom had been suffering for nearly two years. The\r\ncircumstances of his retirement from Bologna would not affect his\r\nreputation as a physician, and he seems to have had in Rome as many or\r\neven more patients than he cared to treat; and in writing in general terms\r\nconcerning his successes as a healer, he says: \"In all, I restored to\r\nhealth more than a hundred patients, given up as incurable in Milan, in\r\nBologna, and in Rome.\" Of all the friends Cardan had in this closing\r\nperiod of his life, none was more useful or benevolent than Cardinal\r\nAlciati, who, although he had been secretary to Pius IV., contrived to\r\nretain the favour of his successor. This piece of good fortune Alciati\r\nowed to the protection of Carlo Borromeo, who had been his pupil at Pavia,\r\nand had procured for him from Pius IV. a bishopric, a cardinal's hat, and\r\nthe secretaryship of Dataria. Another of Cardan's powerful friends was the\r\nPrince of Matellica, of whom he speaks in terms of praise inflated enough\r\nto be ridiculous, were it not for the accompanying note of pathos. After\r\ncelebrating the almost divine character of this nobleman, his munificence\r\nand his superhuman abilities, he goes on: \"What could there be in me to\r\nwin the kindly notice of such a patron? Certainly I had done him no\r\nservice, nor could he hope I should ever do him any in the future, I, an\r\nold man, an outcast of fortune, and prostrated by calamity. In sooth,\r\nthere was naught about me to attract him; if indeed he found any merit in\r\nme, it must have been my uprightness.\"\r\n\r\nPowerful friends are never superfluous, and Cardan seems to have needed\r\nthem in Rome as much as in Bologna. In 1573 he again hints at plots\r\nagainst his life, but almost immediately after recording his suspicions he\r\ngoes on to suggest that his danger had arisen chiefly from his ignorance\r\nof the streets of Rome, and from the uncouth manners of the populace.\r\n\"Many physicians, more cautious than myself, and better versed in the\r\ncustoms of the place, have come by their death from similar cause.\" The\r\ndanger, whatever its nature, seems to have threatened him as a member of\r\nthe practising faculty at Rome rather than as the persecuted ex-teacher of\r\nPavia and Bologna. Rodolfo Sylvestro was not the only one of his former\r\nassociates near him in his old age, for he notes that Simone Sosia, who\r\nhad been his _famulus_ at Pavia in 1562, was still in his service at Rome.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the machinations of his enemies to bring about his dismissal\r\nfrom the Professorship at Bologna, Cardan indulges in the reflection that\r\nthese men unwillingly did him good service, that is, they procured him\r\nleisure which he might use in the completion of his unfinished works, and\r\nin the construction of fresh monuments which he proposed to build up out\r\nof the vast store of material accumulated in his industrious brain. The\r\nliterary record of his life in Rome shows that this was no vain saying. He\r\nwas at work on the later chapters of the _De Vita Propria_ up to the last\r\nweeks of his life; and, scattered about these, there are records of his\r\nwork of correction and revising. While telling of the books he has lately\r\nbeen engaged with, he wanders off in the same sentence to talk of the\r\ndream which urged him to write the _De Subtilitate_, and of the execution\r\nof the _Commentarii in Ptolomæum_, during his voyage down the Loire. In\r\n1573 he seems to have found the mass of undigested work more than he could\r\nbear to behold; for, after making extracts of such matter as he deemed\r\nworth keeping, he consigned to the flames no less than a hundred and\r\ntwenty of his manuscripts.[239] Before leaving Bologna he had put into\r\nshape the _Proxenata_, a lengthy collection of hints, maxims, and\r\nreflections as to everyday life; he had re-edited the _Liber Artis Magnæ_,\r\nand had added thereto the treatise _De Proportionibus_, and the _Regula\r\nAliza_. He also took in hand two books on Geometry, and one on Music, and\r\nthis last he completed in 1574. On November 16, 1574, he records that he\r\nis at that moment writing an explanation of the more abstruse works of\r\nHippocrates, but that he is yet far from the end of his task.\r\n\r\nIn the _De Libris Propriis_ he gives a list of all his published works,\r\nand likewise a table of the same arranged in the order in which they ought\r\nto be read. He apologizes for the imperfect state in which some of them\r\nare left, and declares that the sight of his unfinished tasks never fails\r\nto awaken in his breast a bitter sense of resentment over that loss which\r\nhe had never ceased to mourn. \"At one time I hoped,\" he writes, \"that\r\nthese works would be corrected by my son, but this favour you see has been\r\ndenied to me. The desire of my enemies was not to make an end of him, but\r\nof me; not by gentle means, in sooth, but by cruel open murder; to let me\r\nfall in the very blood of my son.\" It is somewhat remarkable that in this\r\nmatter Cardan was destined to suffer a disappointment similar to that\r\nwhich he himself brought upon his own father by refusing to qualify\r\nhimself to become the commentator on Archbishop Peckham's _Perspectiva_.\r\nHe next gives the names of all those who had commended him in their works,\r\nand finds a special cause for gratification in the fact that, out of the\r\nlong list set down, only four or five were known to him personally, and\r\nthese not intimately. There is, however, another short list of censors;\r\nand of these he affirms that a certain Brodeus alone is worthy of respect.\r\nOf Buteon, who criticized the treatise on _Arithmetic_, he says: \"_Est\r\nplane stultus et elleboro indiget._\" Tartaglia's name is there, and he,\r\naccording to Cardan, was forced to eat his words; \"but he was ashamed to\r\ndo what he promised, and unwilling to blot out what he had written. He\r\nwent on in his wrong-headed course, living upon the labour of other men\r\nlike a greedy crow, a manifest robber of other men's wealth of study; so\r\nimpudent that he published as his own, in the Italian tongue, that\r\ninvention for the raising of sunken ships which I had made known four\r\nyears before. This he did, understanding the subject only imperfectly,\r\nand making no mention of my name. But men of real learning also attacked\r\nme: Rondeletius, and Julius Scaliger; and Fuchsius, in the proem of his\r\nbook, says that my work _Medicinæ Contradictiones_ should be avoided like\r\ndeadly poison. Julius Scaliger has been fully answered in the _Apologia_\r\nin the Books on Subtlety.\"[240]\r\n\r\nThere is a passage from De Thou's _History of his Own Times_, affixed to\r\nall editions of the _De Vita Propria_,[241] in which is given a\r\ncontemporary sketch of Cardan during his residence at Rome. \"His whole\r\nlife,\" De Thou writes, \"has been as strange as his present manners, and\r\nhe, in sooth, out of singleness of mind or frankness, has written about\r\nhimself certain statements, the like of which have never before been heard\r\nof a man of letters, and these I do not feel bound to unfold to any one,\r\nlet him be ever so curious. I, myself, happening to be in Rome a few years\r\nbefore his death, often spoke to him and observed him with astonishment as\r\nhe took his walks about the city clad in strange garb. When I considered\r\nthe many writings of this famous man, I could perceive in him nothing to\r\njustify his great renown. Wherefore I am all the more inclined to turn to\r\nthat very acute criticism of Julius Cæsar Scaliger, who exercised his\r\nextraordinary genius in making a special examination of the treatise _De\r\nSubtilitate Rerum_. He, having carefully noted everywhere the unequal\r\npowers of this writer, decided that he was one who, in certain subjects,\r\nknew more than a man could know, while in others he seemed more simple\r\nthan a child. In the science of Arithmetic he worked hard and made many\r\ndiscoveries; but he was subject to strange and excessive aberration of\r\nmind, and was guilty of the most impudent blasphemy, in that he was minded\r\nto subject to the artificial laws of the stars the Ruler of the stars\r\nHimself, for this thing he did in the horoscope of our Saviour which he\r\ndrew.\"\r\n\r\nAnother witness of his life in Rome is François d'Amboise, a young French\r\nnobleman, who was engaged on his book _De Symbolis Heroicis_. He says that\r\nhe saw Cardan, who was living in a spacious house, on the walls of which,\r\nin place of elegant paintings or vari-coloured tapestries, were written\r\nthe words, \"_Tempus mea possessio_.\"\r\n\r\nIn his later writings there are farther indications that he was wont to\r\nconjure up omens and portents chiefly at those times when he was in danger\r\nand mental distress. In the case which is given below, the omen showed\r\nitself in a season of trouble, but Cardan, in describing it later, treats\r\nit as if he were a modern scientist. The distressing memories of the\r\nimprisonment had faded, and writing in ease and security at Rome he begins\r\nto rationalize. In the dialogue between himself and his father, written\r\nshortly before his death, Fazio calls his son's attention to certain of\r\nthe omens and portents already noticed; and, after discussing these,\r\nJerome goes on to tell for the first time of another boding event which,\r\nas he affirms, distressed him even more than the loss of his office and\r\nthe prohibition to publish his books. On the day of his incarceration, on\r\ntwo different occasions, he met a cow being driven to the slaughter-house,\r\nwith much shouting and beating with sticks and barking of dogs. The\r\nexplanation of this event which he puts in Fazio's mouth is entirely\r\nconceived in the spirit of rationalism. What was there to wonder at? There\r\nwas a butcher's shop in the street, and animals going to slaughter would\r\nnaturally be met there. Why should a man fear to meet a cow? If it had\r\nbeen a bull there might have been something in it. Then with regard to the\r\nshaking of a window-casement; this might easily have been occasioned by\r\nthe flight of a bird.[242] He was certainly less inclined to put faith in\r\nthe warnings of the stars and in the lines of his hand. His line of life\r\nwas very short and irregular, intersected and bifurcated, while the rest\r\nof the lines were little thicker than hairs. In his horoscope was a\r\ncertain malefic influence which threatened that his life would be cut\r\nshort before his forty-fifth year. \"But,\" he writes in the year before his\r\ndeath, \"here I am, living at the age of seventy-five.\"[243] The one\r\nsupernatural idea which seems to have deepened with old age and remained\r\nundisturbed to the end was his belief in his attendant genius. In what he\r\nwrote during his last years his mood was almost entirely introspective,\r\ncontemplative, and didactic, yet here and there he introduces a sentence\r\nwhich lets in a little light from his way of life and personal affairs,\r\nand helps to show how he occupied himself, and what his humour was. He\r\ntells how one day, in 1576, he was writing about the fennel plant in his\r\ntreatise _De Tuenda Sanitate_, a plant which he praised highly because it\r\npleased his palate. But shortly afterwards, when he was walking one day in\r\nthe Roman vegetable market, an old man, shabbily dressed, met him and\r\ndissuaded him from the use of the plant aforesaid, saying: \"In Galen's\r\nopinion you may as readily meet your death thereby as by eating hemlock.\"\r\n\"I answered that I knew well enough the difference between hemlock and\r\nfennel, but the old man said, 'Take care, I know what I am saying,' and\r\nwent on murmuring something about Galen. Whereupon I went home and found\r\nin Galen a passage I had not hitherto noticed, and, having changed my\r\nformer views, I added many fresh excerpts to my treatise.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough his faith may have been shaken in the ability of the stars to\r\ngovern his own fortunes, he records a case in which he himself filled the\r\npost of _vates_, and which came to a sudden and terrible issue. Cardan was\r\npresent at a supper-party, and in the course of conversation let fall the\r\nremark, \"I should like to say something, were I not afraid that my words\r\nwould disturb the company,\" to which one of the guests replied, \"You mean\r\nthat you would prophesy death to one of us here present.\" Cardan replied,\r\n\"Yes, within the present year,\" and in the next sentence he tells how on\r\nthe first day of December in that same year a certain young man, named\r\nVirgilius, who had been present at the gathering aforesaid, died, and he\r\nsets down this event as a fulfilment of his prophecy.\r\n\r\nBut in the same chapter he lets the reader into the secret of his system\r\nof prophecy, and displays it as simply an affair of common-sense, one\r\nrecommended by Aristotle as the only trustworthy method of divining future\r\nevents. Cardan writes: \"I used to inquire what might be the exact nature\r\nof the business in hand, and began by making myself acquainted with the\r\ncharacter of the locality, the ways of the people, and the quality of the\r\nchief actors. I unfolded a vast number of historical instances, leading\r\nevents and secret transactions as well, and then, when I had confirmed the\r\nfacts set forth by my method of art, I gave my judgment thereupon.\"[244]\r\n\r\nIn his latter years Cardan must have been in easy circumstances. The\r\npension from the Pope--no mention is made of its amount--and the fees he\r\nreceived from his patients allowed him to keep a carriage; and writing in\r\nhis seventy-fifth year, he says that no fees would tempt him to join any\r\nconsultation unless he should be well assured what sort of men he was\r\nexpected to meet.[245]\r\n\r\nIn the _Norma Vitæ Consarcinata_[246] he relates how in April 1576 there\r\nwere two inmates of the Xenodochium at Rome, Troilus and Dominicus. It\r\nseemed that Troilus exercised some strange and malefic influence over his\r\ncompanion, who was taken with fever. He got well of this, but only to fall\r\ninto a dropsy, which despatched him in a week. Shortly before his death,\r\nat the seventh hour, he cried out to two Spaniards who were standing by\r\nthe bed that he had suffered such great torture from the working of\r\nTroilus, and that he was dying therefrom. \"Therefore,\" he cried, \"in your\r\npresence I summon him with my dying words to appear before God's tribunal,\r\nthat he may give an account of all the evil he has wrought against me.\" On\r\nthe following day there came a messenger from Corneto, a few miles from\r\nRome, saying that Troilus, who was sojourning there, had fallen sick. The\r\nphysician inquired at what hour, and the messenger said it was at seven\r\no'clock, a day or two ago. He lay ill some days, an unfavourable case, but\r\nnot a desperate one, and one night shortly afterwards at seven o'clock,\r\nthe top of the mosquito curtains fell, and he died at exactly the same\r\nhour as Dominicus.\r\n\r\nHe tells another long story of an adventure which befell him in May 1576.\r\nOne day he was driving in his carriage in the Forum, when he remembered\r\nthat he wanted to see a certain jeweller who lived in a narrow alley close\r\nby. Wherefore he told his coachman, a stupid fellow, to go to the Campo\r\nAltoviti, and await him there. The coachman drove off apparently\r\nunderstanding the order; but, instead of going to the place designated,\r\nwent somewhere else; so Cardan, when he set about to find his carriage,\r\nsought in vain. He had a notion that the man had gone to a spot near the\r\ncitadel, so he walked thither, encumbered with the thick garments he had\r\nput on as necessary for riding in the carriage. Just then he met a friend\r\nof his, Vincenzio, a Bolognese musician, who remarked that Cardan was not\r\nin his carriage as usual. The old man went on towards the citadel, but saw\r\nnothing of the carriage; and now he began to be seriously troubled, for\r\nthere was naught else to be done but to go back over the bridge, and he\r\nwas wearied with long fasting and his heavy clothes. He might indeed have\r\nasked for the loan of a carriage from the Governor of the castle; but he\r\nwas unwilling to do this, so having commended himself to God, he resolved\r\nto use all his patience and prudence in finding his way back. He set out,\r\nand when he had crossed the bridge, he entered the banking-house of the\r\nAltoviti to inquire as to the alteration in the rate of exchange on\r\nNaples, and there sat down to rest. While the banker was giving him this\r\ninformation, the Governor entered the place, whereupon Cardan went out and\r\nthere he found his carriage, the driver having been informed by Vincenzio,\r\nwhom he had met, of the mistake he had made. Cardan got into the carriage,\r\nand while he was wondering whether or not he had better go home and break\r\nhis fast, he found three raisins in his pocket, and thus made a fortunate\r\nending of all his difficulties.\r\n\r\nAll this reads like a commonplace chapter of accidents; but the events\r\nrecorded did not present themselves to Cardan in this guise. He sits down\r\nto moralize over the succession of momentary events: his meeting with\r\nVincenzio; Vincenzio's meeting with the driver, and directions given to\r\nthe man to drive to the money-changers'; the presence of the Governor, his\r\nexit from the bank, his consequent meeting with the carriage, and his\r\ndiscovery of the raisins, seven occurrences in all, any one of which, if\r\nit had happened a little sooner or a little later, would have brought\r\nabout great inconvenience, or even worse. He does not deny that other men\r\nmay not now and then encounter like experiences, but the experiences of\r\nother men were not fraught with such momentous crises, nor did they\r\nforeshadow so many or grave dangers.\r\n\r\nThe chronicling of this episode and the fanciful coincidence of the deaths\r\nof Dominicus and Troilus may be taken as evidence that his idiosyncrasies\r\nwere becoming aggravated by the decay of his faculties. Writing on October\r\n1, 1576, he makes mention of the various testaments he had already made,\r\nand goes on to say that he had resolved to make a new and final\r\ndisposition of his goods. He would fain have let his property descend to\r\nhis immediate offspring, but with a son like Aldo this was impossible, so\r\nhe left all to Gian Battista's son, who would now be a youth about\r\neighteen years of age, Aldo getting nothing. He desired, for reasons best\r\nknown to himself, that all his descendants should remain _in curatela_ as\r\nlong as possible, and that all his property should be held on trust; if\r\nthe issue of his body should fail, then the succession should pass in\r\nperpetuity to his kinsfolk on the father's side. He desired that his works\r\nshould be corrected and printed, and that, if heirs failed entirely, his\r\nhouse at Bologna should pass to the University, and be styled, after his\r\nfamily, _Collegium Cardanorum_.\r\n\r\nThere is no authentic record of the exact date of Cardan's death. De Thou,\r\nin writing the record of 1576, says that if Cardan's life had been\r\nprolonged by three days he would have completed his seventy-fifth year. As\r\nCardan's birthday was September 24, 1501, this would fix his death on\r\nSeptember 21, 1576. The exact figures given by De Thou are: \"eodem, quo\r\nprædixerat, anno et die, videlicet XI. Kalend. VIII.,\" and he adds by way\r\nof information that a belief was current at the time that Cardan, who had\r\nforetold how he would die on this day and in this year, had abstained from\r\nfood for some days previous to his death in order to make the fatal day\r\nsquare with the prophecy.\r\n\r\nBut the details which Cardan himself has set down concerning the last few\r\nweeks of his life are inconsistent with the facts chronicled by De Thou.\r\nIn the _De Vita Propria_, chapter xxxvi., Cardan records how on October 1,\r\n1576, he set to work to make his last will and testament, wherefore if\r\ncredit is to be given to his version rather than to that of De Thou, he\r\nwas alive and active some days after the date of his death as fixed by the\r\nchronicler. In cases where the record of an event of his early life given\r\nin the _De Vita Propria_ differs from an account of the same in some\r\ncontemporary writing, the testimony of the _De Vita Propria_ may justly be\r\nput aside; but in this instance he was writing of something which could\r\nonly have happened a few days past, and the balance of probability is that\r\nhe was right and De Thou wrong. Bayle notices this discrepancy, and in\r\nthe same paragraph taxes De Thou with a mistake of which he is innocent.\r\nHe states that De Thou placed the date of Cardan's death in 1575, whereas\r\nthe excerpt cited above runs: \"Thuanus ad annum MDLXXVI., p. 136, lib.\r\nlxii. tom. 4. Romæ magni nominis sive Mathematicus, sive Medicus\r\nHieronymus Cardanus Mediol. natus hoc anno itidem obiit.\"\r\n\r\nNo mention is made of the disease to which Cardan finally succumbed. Had\r\nhis frame not been of the strongest and most wiry, it must have gone to\r\npieces long before through the havoc wrought by the severe and continuous\r\nseries of ailments with which it was afflicted; so it seems permissible to\r\nassume that he died of natural decay. His body was interred in the church\r\nof Sant Andrea at Rome, and was subsequently transferred to Milan to be\r\ndeposited finally under the stone which covered the bones of his father in\r\nthe church of San Marco. This tomb, which Jerome had erected after Fazio's\r\ndeath, bore the following inscription:\r\n\r\n                    FACIO  CARDANO\r\n\r\n                          1.C.\r\n\r\n      Mors fuit id quod vixi: vitam mors dedit ipsa,\r\n      Mens æterna manet, gloria tuta quies.\r\n\r\n  Obiit anno MDXXIV.

Some writers have been disposed to treat Naudé as a\r\nhide-bound pedant, insensible to the charm of genius, and the last man who\r\nought to be trusted as the valuator of a nature so richly gifted,\r\noriginal, and erratic as was Cardan's. Such critics are content to regard\r\nas black anything which Naudé calls white and _vice versâ_. Others accept\r\nhim as a witness entirely trustworthy, and adopt as a true description of\r\nCardan the paragraphs made up of uncomplimentary adjectives--applied by\r\nCardan to himself--which Naudé has transferred from the _De Vita Propria_\r\nand the _Geniturarum Exempla_ to his _Judicium de Cardano_.\r\n\r\nIt may be conceded at once that the impression received from a perusal of\r\nthis criticism is in the main an unfavourable one of Cardan as a man,\r\nalthough Naudé shows himself no niggard of praise when he deals with\r\nCardan's achievements in Medicine and Mathematics. But in appraising the\r\nqualifications of Naudé to act as a judge in this case, it will be\r\nnecessary to bear in mind the fact that he was in his day a leading\r\nexponent of liberal opinions, the author of a treatise exposing the\r\nmummeries and sham mysteries of the Rosicrucians, and of an \"Apologie pour\r\nles Grands Hommes soupçonnez de Magie,\" and a disbeliever in supernatural\r\nmanifestations of every kind. With a mind thus attuned it is no matter of\r\nsurprise that Naudé should have been led to speak somewhat severely when\r\ncalled upon to give judgment on a man saturated as Cardan was with the\r\nbelief in sorcery, witches, and attendant demons.\r\n\r\nIf Naudé indeed set to work with the intention of drawing a figure of\r\nCardan which should stand out a sinister apparition in the eyes of\r\nposterity, his task was an easy one. All he had to do was to place Jerome\r\nCardan himself in the witness-box. Reference to the passages already\r\nquoted will show that, in the whole _corpus_ of autobiographic literature,\r\nthere does not exist a volume in which the work of self-dissection has\r\nbeen so ruthlessly and completely undertaken and executed as in Cardan's\r\nmemoirs. It has all the vices of an old man's book; it is garrulous,\r\nvain-glorious, and full of needless repetition; but, whatever portion of\r\nhis life may be under consideration, the author never shrinks from holding\r\nup to the world's gaze the result of his searches in the deepest abysses\r\nof his conscience. Autobiographers, as a rule, do not feel themselves\r\nsubject to a responsibility so deep as this. Memory turns back to the\r\ncontemplation of certain springs of action, certain achievements in the\r\npast, making a judicious selection from these, and excerpting only such as\r\npromise to furnish the possible reader with a pleasing impression of the\r\npersonality of the subject. With material of this sort at hand, the\r\nautobiographer sets to work to construct a fair and gracious monument,\r\nbeing easily persuaded that it would be a barbarous act to mar its\r\nsymmetry by the introduction of loathly and misshapen blocks like those\r\nwhich Cardan, had he been the artist, would have chosen first of all.\r\n\r\nNaudé, after he has recorded the fact that, from his first essay in\r\nletters, he had been a zealous and appreciative student of Cardan's works,\r\nsets down Cardan's picture of himself, taken from his own Horoscope in the\r\n_Geniturarum Exempla_, \"nugacem, religionis contemptorem, injuriæ illatæ\r\nmemorem, invidum, tristem, insidiatorem, proditorem, magum, incantatorem,\r\nfrequentibus calamitatibus obnoxium, suorum osor[e=], turpi libidini\r\ndeditum, solitarium, inamoenum, austerum, spontè etiam divinantem,\r\nzelotypum, lascivum, obscoenum, maledicum, obsequiosum, senum\r\nconversatione se delectantem, varium, ancipitem, impur[u=], et dolis\r\nmulierum obnoxium, calumniatorem, et omnino incognitum propter naturæ et\r\nmorum repugnantiam, etiam his cum quibus assidue versor.\" The critic at\r\nonce goes on to state that in his opinion this description, drawn by the\r\nperson who ought to know best, is, in the main, a correct one. What better\r\naccount could you expect, he asks, of a man who put faith in dreams and\r\nportents and auguries; who believed fully in the utterances of crazy\r\nbeldames, who saw ghosts, and who believed he was attended by a familiar\r\ndemon? Then follows a catalogue of moral offences and defects of\r\ncharacter, all taken from Cardan's own confessions, and a pronunciation by\r\nNaudé that the man who says he never lies, must be of all liars the\r\ngreatest; the charge of mendacity being driven home by references to\r\nCardan's alleged miraculous comprehension of the classic tongues in a\r\nsingle night, and his pretended knowledge of a cure for phthisis. There is\r\nno need to follow Naudé farther in his diatribe against the faults and\r\nimperfections, real and apparent, of Cardan's character; these must be\r\nvisible enough to the most cursory student. Passages like these arouse\r\nthe suspicion that Naudé knew books better than men, that at any rate he\r\ndid not realize that men are to be found, and not seldom, who take\r\npleasure in magnifying their foibles into gigantic follies, and their\r\npeccadilloes into atrocious crimes; while the rarity is to come across one\r\nwho will set down these details with the circumstantiality used by Cardan.\r\nThere is one defect in the _De Vita Propria_--an artistic one--which Naudé\r\ndoes not notice, namely, that in his narrative of his early days Cardan\r\noften over-reaches himself. His show of extreme accuracy destroys the\r\nperspective of the story, and, in his anxiety to be minute over the\r\nsequence of his childish ailments, the most trivial details of his uneasy\r\ndreams, and the cuffs he got from his father and his Aunt Margaret, he\r\nconfuses the reader with multitudinous particulars and ceases to be\r\ndramatic. But the hallucinations which he nourished about himself were not\r\nall the outcome of senility. In the _De Varietate_, the work upon which he\r\nspent the greatest care, and the product moreover of his golden prime, he\r\ngives an account of four marvellous properties with which he was\r\ngifted.[248] The first of these was the power to pass, whenever the whim\r\nseized him, from sense into a kind of ecstasy. While he was in this state\r\nhe could hear but faintly the sound of voices, and could not distinguish\r\nspoken words. Whether he would be sensitive to any great pain he could not\r\nsay, but twitchings and the sharpest attacks of gout affected him not.\r\nWhen he fell into this state he felt a certain separation about the heart,\r\nas if his soul were departing from that region and taking possession of\r\nhis whole body, a door being opened for the passage of the same. The\r\nsensation would begin in the cerebellum, and thence would be diffused\r\nalong the spine. The one thing of which he was fully conscious, was that\r\nhe had passed out of himself. The second property was that, when he would,\r\nhe could conjure up any images he liked before his eyes, real [Greek:\r\neidôla], and not at all to be compared with the blurred processions of\r\nphantoms which he was wont to see when he was a child. At the time when he\r\nwrote, perhaps by reason of his busy life, he no longer saw them\r\nwhensoever he would, nor so perfectly expressed, nor for so long at a\r\ntime. These images constantly gave place one to another, and he would\r\nbehold groves, and animals, and orbs, and whatever he was fain to see.\r\nThis property he attributed to the force of his imaginative power, and his\r\nclearness of vision. The third property was that he never failed to be\r\nwarned in dreams of things about to happen to him; and the fourth was that\r\npremonitory signs of coming events would display themselves in the form of\r\nspots on his nails. The signs of evil were black or livid, and appeared on\r\nthe middle finger; white spots on the same nail portending good fortune.\r\nHonours were indicated on the thumb, riches on the fore-finger, matters\r\nrelating to his studies and of grave import on the third finger, and minor\r\naffairs on the little finger.\r\n\r\nIn putting together the record of his life, Cardan eschewed the narrative\r\nform and followed a method of his own. He collected the details of his\r\nqualities, habits, and adventures in separate chapters; his birth and\r\nlineage, his physical stature, his diet, his rule of life, his\r\nimperfections, his poverty, the misfortunes of his sons, his masters and\r\npupils, his travels, his experiences of things beyond nature, his cures,\r\nthe persecutions of his foes, and divers other categories being grouped\r\ntogether to make up the _De Vita Propria_, which, though it is the most\r\ninteresting book he has left behind him, is certainly the most clumsy and\r\nchaotic from a literary point of view. The chapters for the most part\r\nbegin with his early years, and end with some detail as to his life in\r\nRome, each one being a categorical survey of a certain side of his life;\r\nbut remarks as to his personal peculiarities are scattered about from\r\nbeginning to end. He tells how he could always see the moon in broad\r\ndaylight;[249] of his passion for wandering about the city by night\r\ncarrying arms forbidden by the law; of his practice of self-torture,\r\nbeating his legs with a switch, twisting his fingers, pinching his flesh,\r\nand biting his left arm; and of going about within doors with naked legs;\r\nhow at one time he was possessed with the desire, _heroica passio_, of\r\nsuicide; of his habit of filling his house with pets of all sorts--kids,\r\nlambs, hares, rabbits, and storks. The chapter in which he records all the\r\nmaladies which afflicted him, puts upon the reader's credulity a burden\r\nalmost as heavy as is the catalogue given by another philosopher of the\r\nnumber of authors he mastered before his twelfth year. Two attacks of the\r\nplague, agues, tertian and quotidian, malignant ulcers, hernia,\r\nhæmorrhoids, varicose veins, palpitation of the heart, gout, indigestion,\r\nthe itch, and foulness of skin. Relief in the second attack of plague came\r\nfrom a sweat so copious that it soaked the bed and ran in streams down to\r\nthe floor; and, in a case of continuous fever, from voiding a hundred and\r\ntwenty ounces of urine. As a boy he was a sleep-walker, and he never\r\nbecame warm below the knees till he had been in bed six hours, a\r\ncircumstance which led his mother to predict that his time on earth would\r\nbe brief.\r\n\r\nCardan lived an abstemious life. He broke his fast on bread-and-water and\r\na few grapes. He sometimes dined off bread, the yolk of an egg, and a\r\nlittle wine, and would take for supper a mess of beetroot and rice and a\r\nchicory salad. The catalogue of his favourite dishes seems to exhaust\r\nevery known edible, and it will suffice to remark that he was specially\r\ninclined to sound and well-stewed wild boar, the wings of young cockerels\r\nand the livers of pullets, oysters, mussels, fresh-water crayfish because\r\nhis mother ate greedily thereof when she was pregnant with him; but of all\r\ndishes he rates the best a carp from three pounds weight to seven, taken\r\nfrom a good feeding-ground. He praises all sweet fruit, oil, olives, and\r\nfinds in rue an antidote to poison. Ten o'clock was his hour for going to\r\nbed, and he allowed himself eight hours' sleep. When wakeful he would walk\r\nabout the room and repeat the multiplication table. As a further remedy\r\nfor sleeplessness he would reduce his food by half, and would anoint his\r\nthighs, the soles of his feet, the neck, the elbows, the carpal bones, the\r\ntemples, the jugulars, the region of the heart and of the liver, and the\r\nupper lip with ointment of poplars, or the fat of bear, or the oil of\r\nwater-lilies.\r\n\r\nThese few extracts will show that an intelligible narrative could scarcely\r\nbe produced by the methods Cardan used. The book is a collection of facts,\r\nclassified as a scientific writer would arrange the sections and\r\nsubsections of his subject. In gathering together and grouping the leading\r\npoints of his life, a method somewhat similar to his own will suffice, but\r\nthere will be no need to descend to a subdivision so minute as his own. A\r\ntask of this sort is never an easy one, and in this instance the\r\ndifficulties are increased by the diffuse and complicated nature of the\r\nsubject matter; and because, owing to Cardan's wayward mental habit,\r\nthere is no saying in what corner of the ten large folios which contain\r\nhis writings some pregnant and characteristic sentence, picturing\r\neffectively some aspect of his nature or perhaps exhibiting the man at a\r\nglance, may not be hidden away.\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred, because Cardan himself and his critics after him,\r\nhave laid such great stress upon his vices and imperfections, that he was\r\ndevoid of virtues. The most striking and remarkable of his merits was his\r\nindustry, but even in this particular instance, where his excellence is\r\nmost clearly manifest, he is constantly lamenting his waste of time and\r\nidleness. Again and again he mourns over the precious hours he has spent\r\nover chess and dice and games of chance. In his counsels to his children,\r\nhe compares a gambler to a sink of all the vices, and in writing of his\r\nearly life at Sacco he describes himself as an idle profligate, and tells\r\nhow he entirely neglected his profession. If indeed such monstrous cantles\r\nwere cut out of his time through idleness he must, though his life proved\r\na long one, have possessed extraordinary power of rapid production; for\r\nthe huge mass of his published work, without taking any account of the\r\nmany manuscripts he burned from time to time, would, in the case of most\r\nmen, represent the ceaseless labour of a long life. And the _corpus_ is\r\nnot great by reason of haste or want of finish. He has recorded more than\r\nonce how it was ever his habit to let his work be polished to the utmost\r\nbefore putting it in type. The citations with which his pages bristle\r\nproclaim him to be a reader almost as voracious and catholic as Burton;\r\nand Naudé, with the watchfulness of the hostile critic in his heart and\r\nthe bookworm's knowledge in his brain, would have been ready and able to\r\nconvict him of quoting authors he had not read, if the least handle for\r\nthis charge should have been given, but no accusation of the kind is\r\npreferred. The story of his life shows him to be full of rough candour and\r\nhonesty, and unlikely to descend to subterfuge, while his great love of\r\nreading and his accurate retentive memory would make easy for him a task\r\nwhich ordinary mortals might well regard as hopeless.\r\n\r\nThose critics who pass judgment on Cardan, taken solely as a Physician or\r\nas a Mathematician, will give a presentment more fallacious than imperfect\r\ngeneralizations usually furnish, for in Cardan's case the man, taken as a\r\nwhole, was incomparably greater than the sum of his parts. Naudé remarks\r\nthat a man who knows a little of everything, and that little imperfectly,\r\ndeserves small respect as a citizen of the republic of letters, but Cardan\r\ndid not belong to this category, as Julius Cæsar Scaliger found to his\r\ncost. He was not like the bookmen of the revival of learning--Poliziano,\r\nValla, or Alberti may stand as examples--who after putting on the armour\r\nof the learned language and saturating themselves with the _literæ\r\nhumaniores_, made excursions into some domain of science for the sake of\r\nrecreation. Cardan might rather be compared with Varro or Theophrastus in\r\nclassic, and with Erasmus, Pico, Grotius, or Casaubon in modern times. On\r\nthis point Naudé indulges in something approaching panegyric. He\r\nwrites--\"Investigation will show us that many excelled him in the\r\nhumanities or in Theology, some even in Mathematics, some in Medicine and\r\nin the knowledge of Philosophy, some in Oriental tongues and in either\r\nside of Jurisprudence, but where shall we find any one who had mastered so\r\nmany sciences by himself, who had plumbed so deeply the abysses of\r\nlearning and had written such ample commentaries on the subjects he\r\nstudied? Assuredly in Philosophy, in Metaphysics, in History, in Politics,\r\nin Morals, as well as in the more abstruse fields of learning, nothing\r\nthat was worth consideration escaped his notice.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing eulogy from the pen of an adverse critic gives eloquent\r\ntestimony to Cardan's industry and the catholicity of his knowledge. As to\r\nhis industry, the record of his literary production, chronicled\r\nincidentally in the course of the preceding pages, will be evidence\r\nenough, seeing that, from the time when he \"commenced author,\" scarcely a\r\nyear went by when he did not print a volume of some sort or other; to say\r\nnothing of the production of those multitudinous unpublished MSS., of\r\nwhich some went to build up the pile he burnt in his latter years in Rome,\r\nwhile others, perhaps, are still mouldering in the presses of university\r\nor city libraries of Italy. Frequent reference has been made to the more\r\nnoteworthy of his works. Books like the _De Vita Propria_, the _De Libris\r\nPropriis_, the _De Utilitate ex Adversis Capienda_, the _Geniturarum\r\nExempla_, the _Theonoston_, the _Consilia Medica_, the dialogues _Tetim_\r\nand _De Morte_, have necessarily been drawn upon for biographical facts.\r\nThe _De Subtilitate_ and the _De Varietate Rerum_; the _Liber Artis\r\nMagnæ_, the _Practica Arithmeticæ_, have been noticed as the most enduring\r\nportions of his legacy to posterity; wherefore, before saying the final\r\nword as to his literary achievement, it may not be superfluous to give a\r\nbrief glance at those of his books which, although of minor importance to\r\nthose already cited, engaged considerable attention in the lifetime of the\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\nThe work upon which Cardan founded his chief hope of immortality was his\r\n_Commentary on Hippocrates_. In bulk it ranks first easily, filling as it\r\ndoes one of the large folios of the edition of 1663. Curiously enough, in\r\naddition to a permanent place in the annals of medicine, Cardan\r\nanticipated for this forgotten mass of type a general and immediate\r\npopularity; wider than any which his technical works could possibly enjoy,\r\nseeing that it dealt with the preservation of health, the greatest mortal\r\nblessing, and must on this account be of interest to all men. It will be\r\nenough to remark of these commentaries that no portion of Cardan's work\r\nyields less information as to the author's life and personality; to dilate\r\nupon them, ever so superficially, from a scientific point of view, would\r\nbe waste of time and paper. Another of his works, which he rated highly,\r\nwas his treatise on Music. It was begun during his tenure of office at\r\nPavia, _circa_ 1547, and he was still at work upon it two years before his\r\ndeath.[250] It is not difficult to realize, even at this interval of time,\r\nthat this book at the date of its publication must have been welcomed by\r\nall musical students as a valuable contribution to the literature of their\r\nsubject. It is strongly marked by Cardan's particular touch, that\r\nformative faculty by which he almost always succeeded in stimulating fresh\r\ninterest in the reader, and exhibiting fresh aspects of whatever subject\r\nhe might be treating. This work begins by laying down at length the\r\ngeneral rules and principles of the art, and then goes on to treat of\r\nancient music in all its forms; of music as Cardan knew and enjoyed it; of\r\nthe system of counterpoint and composition, and of the construction of\r\nmusical instruments.\r\n\r\nThe Commentary on _Ptolemæi de Astrorum Judiciis_, the writing of which\r\nbeguiled the tedium of his voyage down the Loire on his journey to Paris\r\nin 1552, is a book upon which he spent great care, and is certainly worthy\r\nof notice. Cardan's gratitude to Archbishop Hamilton for the liberal\r\ntreatment and gracious reception he had recently encountered in Scotland,\r\nprompted him to dedicate this volume to his late patient. He writes in the\r\npreface how he had expected to find the Scots a pack of barbarians, but\r\ntheir country, he affirms, is cultivated and humanized beyond\r\nbelief,--\"and you yourself reflect such splendour upon your nation that\r\nnow, by the very lustre of your name, it must needs appear to the world\r\nmore noble and illustrious than at any time heretofore. What need is there\r\nfor me to speak of the school founded by you at St. Andrews, of sedition\r\nquelled, of your country delivered, of the authority of your brother the\r\nRegent vindicated? These are merely the indications of your power, and not\r\nthe source thereof.\" In the preface he also writes at length, concerning\r\nthe horoscope of Christ,[251] in a strain of apology, as if he scented\r\nalready the scandal which the publication of this injudicious performance\r\nwas destined to raise. In estimating the influence of comets he sets down\r\nseveral instances which had evidently been brought to his notice during\r\nhis sojourn in Scotland: how in 1165, within fourteen days of the\r\nappearance of a great comet, Malcolm IV., known on account of his\r\ncontinence as the virgin king, fell sick and died. Again, in 1214 two\r\ncomets, one preceding and the other following the sun, appeared as\r\nfore-runners of the death of King William after a reign of forty-nine\r\nyears. Perhaps the most interesting of his comments on Ptolemy's text are\r\nthose which estimate the power of the stellar influences on the human\r\nframe, an aspect of the question which, by reason of his knowledge of\r\nmedicine and surgery, would naturally engage his more serious attention.\r\nHe tells of the birth of a monstrous child--a most loathsome\r\nmalformation--at Middleton Stoney, near Oxford, during his stay in\r\nEngland,[252] and gives many other instances of the disastrous effects of\r\nuntoward conjunction of the planets upon infants born under the influence\r\nof the same. He accuses monks and nuns of detestable vices in the plainest\r\nwords, words which were probably read by the emissaries of the spiritual\r\nauthority when the charge of impiety was being got up against him. In the\r\n_Geniturarum Exempla_ the horoscopes of Edward VI., Archbishop Hamilton,\r\nand Cardan himself have been already noticed; that of Sir John Cheke comes\r\nnext in interest to these, and, it must be admitted, is no more\r\ntrustworthy. It declares that Cheke would attain the age of sixty-one\r\nyears, that he would be most fortunate in gathering wealth and friends\r\naround him, that he would die finally of lingering disease, and involve\r\nmany in misfortune by his death--a faulty guess, indeed, as to the future\r\nof a man who died at forty-three, borne down by the weight of his\r\nmisfortunes, neglected and forgotten by his former adherents, stripped of\r\nhis wealth and covered with shame, in that he had abjured his faith to\r\nsave a life which was so little worth preserving.\r\n\r\nNaudé does not neglect to censure Cardan for his maladroit attempts to\r\nread the future. He writes:--\"This matter, forsooth, gave a ready handle\r\nto Cardan's rivals, and especially to those who were sworn foes of\r\nastrology; so that they were able to jibe at him freely because, neither\r\nin his own horoscope, nor in that of his son Giovanni Battista, nor in\r\nthat of Aymer Ranconet, nor in that of Edward VI., king of England, nor\r\nin any other of the schemes that he drew, did he rightly foresee any of\r\nthe events which followed. He did not divine that he himself was doomed to\r\nimprisonment, his son to the halter, Ranconet to a violent death, and\r\nEdward to a brief term of life, but predicted for each one of these some\r\nfuture directly contrary.\"[253]\r\n\r\nThe treatise _De Consolatione_, probably the best known of Cardan's\r\nethical works, was first published at Venice in 1542 by Girolamo Scoto,\r\nbut it failed at first to please the public taste. It was not until 1544,\r\nwhen it was re-issued bound up with the _De Sapientia_ and the first\r\nversion of the _De Libris Propriis_ from the press of Petreius at\r\nNuremberg, that it met with any success. Perhaps the sober tone and\r\ndidactic method of this treatise appealed more readily to the mood of the\r\nGerman than of the Italian reader. From internal evidence it is obvious\r\nthat Cardan was urged to write it by the desire of making known to the\r\nworld the bitter experience of his early literary and professional\r\nstruggles. In the opening paragraph he lets it be seen that he intends to\r\nfollow a Ciceronian model, and records his regret that the lament of\r\nCicero over his daughter's death should have perished in the barbarian\r\nwars. The original title of the book was _The Accuser_, to wit, something\r\nwhich might censure the vain passions and erring tendencies of mankind,\r\n\"at post mutato nomine, et in tres libellos diviso, de Consolatione eum\r\ninscripsimus, quod longe magis infelices consolatione, quam fortunati\r\nreprehensione, indigere viderentur.\" The subsequent success of the book\r\nwas probably due to this change of name, though the author himself\r\npreferred to have discovered a special reason for its early failure.[254]\r\nThe plan of the treatise is the same as that of a dozen others of the same\r\nnature: an effort to persuade men in evil case that they may find relief\r\nby regarding the misfortunes they suffer as transitory accidents in no way\r\naffecting the chief end of life, and by seeking happiness alone in\r\ntrafficking with the riches of the mind.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether any of the books written with this object have ever\r\nserved their purpose, save in the case of their originators. Cardan may\r\nhave found the burden of his failure and poverty grow lighter as he set\r\ndown his woes on paper, but the rest of the world must have read the book\r\nfor some other reason than the hope of consolation. Read to-day in\r\nBedingfield's quaint English, the book is full of charm and interest. It\r\nis filled with apt illustration from Greek philosophy and from Holy Writ\r\nas well, and lighted up by spaces of lively wit. It was accepted by the\r\npublic taste for reasons akin to those which would secure popularity for a\r\nclever volume of essays at the present time, and was translated into more\r\nthan one foreign language, Bedingfield's translation being published some\r\nthirty years after its first appearance.\r\n\r\nThe _De Sapientia_, with which it is generally classed, is of far less\r\ninterest. It is a series of ethical discourses, lengthy and discursive,\r\nwhich must have seemed dull enough to contemporary students: to read it\r\nthrough now would be a task almost impossible. It is only remembered\r\nbecause Cardan has inserted therein, somewhat incongruously, that account\r\nof his asserted cures of phthisis which Cassanate quoted when he wrote to\r\nCardan about Archbishop Hamilton's asthma, and which were afterwards\r\nseized upon by hostile critics as evidence of his disregard of truth.\r\n\r\nAnother of his minor works highly characteristic of the author is the\r\n_Somniorum Synesiorum_, a collection of all the remarkable dreams he ever\r\ndreamt, many of which have been already noticed. To judge from what\r\nspecimens of his epistles are extant, Cardan seems to have been a good\r\nletter-writer. One of the most noteworthy is that which he addressed to\r\nGian Battista after his marriage. It shows Cardan to have been a loving\r\nfather and a master of sapient exhortation, while the son's fate gives\r\nmelancholy testimony of the futility of good counsel unaided by direction\r\nand example. He tells of his grief at seeing the evil case into which his\r\nson had fallen, vexed by poverty, disgrace, and loss of health, how he\r\nwould gladly even now receive the prodigal into his house (he says nothing\r\nabout the wife), did he not fear that such a step would lead to his own\r\nruin rather than to his son's restoration. After showing that any fresh\r\nmisfortune to himself must needs cut away the last hope for Gian Battista,\r\nhe sketches out a line of conduct for the ill-starred youth which he\r\ndeclared, if rightly pursued, might re-establish his fortunes.\r\n\r\nHe begins by advising his son to read and lay to heart the contents of the\r\n_De Consolatione_ and the _De Utilitate_, and then, somewhat more to the\r\npurpose, promises him half his earnings of the present and the coming\r\nyear. Beyond this Gian Battista should have half the salary of any office\r\nwhich his father might get for himself, and half of the piece of silk\r\nwhich he had received from the Venetian Ambassador, supposing that the\r\nyoung man should not be able to get a like piece for himself from the same\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nHe next cites the _De Consolatione_ to demonstrate the futility of\r\nlamentation over misfortune past or present, or indeed over any decree of\r\nfate. He bids Gian Battista reflect that he is human not a brute, a man\r\nnot a woman, a Christian not a Moslem or Jew, an Italian not a barbarian,\r\nsprung from a worthy city and family, and from a father whose name by\r\nitself will prove a title to fame. His only real troubles are a weak body\r\nand infirm health--one a gift of heredity, the other aggravated by\r\ndissolute habits. It may be a vain thing for men to congratulate\r\nthemselves over their happiness, but it is vainer for them to cry out for\r\nsolace over past calamity. Contempt of money is foolish, but contempt of\r\nGod is ten times worse. Cardan concludes this part of his letter by\r\nreciting two maxims given him by his father--one, to have daily\r\nremembrance of God and of His vast bounty, the other, to pursue with the\r\nutmost diligence any task taken in hand.\r\n\r\nCardan then treats the scapegrace to a string of maxims from the _De\r\nUtilitate_, maxims which a model son might have read, but which Gian\r\nBattista would certainly put aside unnoticed, and finishes with some\r\nserviceable practical counsel: \"Keep your mind calm, go early to bed, for\r\nours is a hot-blooded race and predisposed to suffer from stone. Take nine\r\nhours' sleep, rise at six and visit your patients, being careful to use no\r\nspeech unconnected with the case before you. Avoid heating your body to\r\nperspiration; go forth on horseback, come back on foot; and on your return\r\nput on warm clothes. Drink little, break your fast on bread, dried fish,\r\nand meat, and then give four hours to study, for studies bring pleasure,\r\nrelief from care, and mental riches; they are the foundations of renown,\r\nand enable a man to do his duty with credit. See your patients again; and,\r\nbefore you sup, take exercise in the woods and fields adjacent. Should\r\nyou become over-heated or wet with rain, cast off and dry your damp\r\nclothes, and don dry ones. Sup heartily, and go to bed at eight; and when,\r\nby the brevity of the night, this is not convenient, take a corresponding\r\nrest during the day. Abstain from summer fruit, from black wine, from vain\r\noverflow of talk, from falsehood and gaming, from trusting a woman or\r\nover-indulging her, for she is a foolish animal and full of deceit.\r\nOver-fondness towards a woman will surely bring evil upon you. Bleed and\r\npurge yourself as little as possible; learn by experience of other men's\r\nfaults and misfortunes; live frugally; bear yourself suavely to all men;\r\nand let study be your main end. All this and more have I set forth in the\r\nbooks I have named. Trust neither promises nor hopes, for these may be\r\nvain and delusive; and reckon your own only that which you hold in your\r\nhand. Farewell.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that Cardan took part in an unofficial medical conference in\r\nParis, that he afterwards superseded Cassanate as the Archbishop of St.\r\nAndrews' physician, and did not find himself with a dozen or so quarrels\r\non his hands, it may be assumed that he was laudably free from the\r\njealousy attributed by tradition to his profession. This instance becomes\r\nall the more noteworthy when his natural irascibility, and the character\r\nof the learned controversy of the times comes to be considered. He does\r\nnot spare his censure in remarking on the too frequent quarrels of men of\r\nletters,[255] albeit these quarrels must have lent no little gaiety to the\r\nliterary world. No one who reads the account of Gian Battista's fate can\r\ndoubt the sincerity of Cardan's remorse for that neglect of the boy's\r\nyouthful training which helped to bring him to ruin, and the care which he\r\nbestowed upon his grandson Fazio proved that his regret was not of that\r\nsort which exhales itself in empty words. The zeal with which he threw\r\nhimself into the struggle for his son's life, and his readiness to strip\r\nhimself of his last coin as the fight went on, show that he was capable of\r\nwarm-hearted affection, and afraid of no sacrifice in the cause of duty.\r\n\r\nThe brutal candour which Cardan used in probing the weaknesses of his own\r\nnature and in displaying them to the world, he used likewise in his\r\ndealings with others. If he detected Branda Porro or Camutio in a blunder\r\nhe would inform them they were blockheads without hesitation, and plume\r\nhimself afterwards on the score of his blunt honesty. Veracity was not a\r\ncommon virtue in those days, but Cardan laid claim to it with a display of\r\ninsistence which was not, perhaps, in the best taste. Over and over again\r\nhe writes that he never told a lie;[256] a contention which seems to have\r\nroused especially the bile of Naudé, and to have spurred him on to make\r\nhis somewhat clumsy assault on Cardan's veracity.[257] His citation of the\r\ncase of the stranger who came with the volume of Apuleius for sale, and of\r\nthe miraculous gift of classic tongues, has already been referred to; but\r\nthese may surely be attributed to an exaggerated activity of that\r\nparticular side of Cardan's imagination which was specially prone to\r\nseize upon some figment of the brain, and some imperfectly apprehended\r\nsensation of the optic nerve, and fashion from these materials a tale of\r\nmarvel. Delusions of this sort were common in reputed witches, as Reginald\r\nScot writes--\"They learne strange toongs with small industrie (as\r\nAristotle and others affirme).\"[258] The other charge preferred by Naudé\r\nas to the pretended cure of consumption, and the consequent quibbling and\r\ntergiversation, is a more valid one. It has been noted how Cardan,\r\nprevious to his journey to Scotland, had posed as the discoverer of a cure\r\nfor this malady. In the list of his cures successfully treated he includes\r\nseveral in which he restored patients suffering from blood-spitting,\r\nfever, and extreme emaciation to sound health, the most noteworthy of\r\nthese being that of Girolamo Tiboldo, a sea-captain. When the sick man had\r\nrisen from his bed and had become fat and healthy, Cardan deemed that the\r\noccasion justified a certain amount of self-gratulation, but the\r\nphysicians, out of envy, declared that Tiboldo had never suffered from\r\ntrue phthisis. In his account of the case Cardan says that he, and the\r\nphysicians as well, were indeed untruthful over the matter, his own\r\nfalsehood having been the result of over-sanguine hope, and theirs the\r\noutcome of spiteful envy. Tiboldo died after all of chest disease, but not\r\ntill five years later, and then from a chill caught through sitting in wet\r\ngarments.[259] The term consumption has always been applied somewhat\r\nloosely, and Cardan probably would have been allowed the benefit of this\r\nusage if he had not, in an excess of candour, set down the workings of his\r\nmind and conscience with regard to this matter. Writing of his treatment\r\nof Archbishop Hamilton, he says: \"And in truth I cured scarcely any\r\npatients of phthisic disease, though I did find a remedy for many who were\r\nsuffering from similar maladies, wherefore that boast of mine, that\r\nproclamation of merit to which I had no right, worked no small profit to\r\nme, a man very little given to lying. For the people about the Archbishop,\r\nurged on by these and other considerations, persuaded him that he had no\r\nchance of regaining his health except by putting himself under my care,\r\nand that he should fly to me as his last hope.\"[260] It has already been\r\nnoted that Cardan's claim to some past knowledge in the successful\r\ntreatment of chest diseases had weight with the Archbishop and Cassanate,\r\nand the result of his visit surely proved that their confidence was not\r\nill-placed; his boasting may have been a trifle excessive, but it was\r\nbased on hope rather than achievement; and if proof can be adduced that it\r\nwas not prompted by any greed of illegitimate fame or profit, it may\r\njustly be ranked as a weakness rather than as a serious offence. To these\r\ntwo instances of falsehood Naudé adds a third, to wit, Cardan's claim to\r\nthe guidance of a familiar spirit. He refuses to let this rank as a\r\ndelusion; and, urged no doubt by righteous indignation against the ills\r\nspringing from kindred superstitions, he writes down as a liar rather than\r\na dupe the man who, after mastering the whole world of science, could\r\nprofess such folly.\r\n\r\nConsidering the catholicity of Cardan's achievements, and the eager spirit\r\nof inquiry he displayed in fields of learning remote from his own\r\nparticular one, it is worthy of notice that he did not allow this\r\ndiscursive humour, which is not seldom a token of instability, to hold him\r\nback from pursuing the supreme aim of his life, that is, eminence in the\r\nart of Medicine. In his youth the threats and persuasions of his father\r\ncould not induce him to take up Jurisprudence with an assured income and\r\nabandon Medicine. At Sacco, at Gallarate, and afterwards in Milan he was\r\nforced by the necessity of bread-winning to use his pen in all sorts of\r\nminor subjects that had no real fascination for him, but all his leisure\r\nwas devoted to the acquisition of Medical knowledge. Prudence as well as\r\ninclination had a share in directing his energies into this channel, for a\r\nreport, for which no doubt there was some warrant, was spread abroad that\r\nwhat skill he had lay entirely in the knowledge of Astrology; and, as this\r\nrumour operated greatly to his prejudice,[261] he resolved to perfect\r\nhimself in Medicine and free his reputation from this aspersion. He had\r\nquarrelled violently with the physicians over the case of Count Borromeo's\r\nchild which died, and with Borromeo himself, and, almost immediately after\r\nthis, he published his book, _De Astrorum Judiciis_, a step which tended\r\nto identify him yet more closely with Astrology, and to raise a cry\r\nagainst him in Milan, which he declares to be the most scandal-mongering\r\ncity in the Universe. But it is clear that in this instance scandal was\r\nnot far wrong, and that Cardan himself was right in purging himself of the\r\nquasi science he ought never to have taken up.\r\n\r\nMedicine, when Cardan began his studies, was beginning to feel the effects\r\nof the revival of Greek learning. With the restored knowledge of the\r\nlanguage of Greece there arose a desire to investigate the storehouses of\r\nscience, as well as those of literature, and the extravagant assumption\r\nof the dogmatists, and the eccentricities of the Arabic school gave\r\nadditional cogency to the cry for more light. The sects which Galen had\r\nendeavoured to unite sprang into new activity within a century after his\r\ndeath. The Arabian physicians, acute and curious as they were, had\r\nexercised but a very transient influence upon the real progress of the\r\nart, the chief cause of their non-success being their adhesion to\r\narbitrary and empirical tradition. At the end of the fifteenth century,\r\nLeonicinus, a professor at Ferrara, recalled the allegiance of his pupils\r\nto the authority of Hippocrates by the ability and eloquence of his\r\nteaching; and, by his translation of Galen's works into Latin, he helped\r\nstill farther to confirm the ascendency of the fathers of Medicine. The\r\nArabians, sprung from the East, the storehouse of drugs and simples, and\r\nskilled in Chemistry, were the founders of the Pharmacopoeia,[262] but\r\nwith this exception they did nothing to advance Medicine beyond the point\r\nwhere the Greeks had left it. The treatises of Haly, Avicenna, and\r\nMaimonides were little better than faint transcriptions of the writings of\r\nthe great forerunners. Their teaching was random and spasmodic, whereas\r\nthe system of Hippocrates was conceived in the spirit of Greek philosophy,\r\nmoving on by select experience, always observant and cautious, and\r\nascending by slow and certain steps to the generalities of Theory. Indeed\r\nthe science of Medicine in the hands of Hippocrates and his school seems,\r\nmore than any other, to have presented to the world a rudimentary essay, a\r\nfaint foreshadowing of the great fabric of inductive process, subsequently\r\nformulated by the genius of Bacon. At various epochs Medicine had been\r\nspecially stimulated by the vivifying spirit of Greek science; in the\r\nRoman school in the days of Celsus, and in the Arabian teaching likewise.\r\nFuller acknowledgment of the authority of Greek Medicine came with the\r\nRenaissance,[263] but even this long step in advance did not immediately\r\nliberate the art from bondage. A new generation of professors arose who\r\nadded fresh material to the storehouses, already overflowing, of pedantic\r\nerudition, and showed the utmost contempt for any fruit of other men's\r\nlabour which might not square exactly with the utterances of the founders.\r\nThis attitude rendered these professors of Medicine the legitimate objects\r\nof ridicule, as soon as the leaven of the revival began to work, and the\r\ndarts of satire still fly, now and then, at the same quarry. Paracelsus,\r\ndisfigured as his teaching was by mysticism, the arts of the charlatan,\r\nand by his ignorant repudiation of the service of Anatomy, struck the\r\nfirst damaging blows at this illegitimate ascendency, by the frequent\r\nsuccess of his empirical treatment, by the contempt he heaped upon the\r\nscholastic authorities, and by the boldness with which he assailed every\r\nthesis which they maintained. Men of more sober intellect and weighty\r\nlearning soon followed in his track. Fernelius, one of the physicians\r\nCardan met in Paris, boldly rejected what he could not approve by\r\nexperience in the writings of Hippocrates and Galen, and stood forth as\r\nthe advocate for free inquiry, and Joubert of Montpelier, Argentier of\r\nTurin, and Botal of Asti subsequently took a similar course.\r\n\r\nWhen Cardan went to study at Pavia in 1519 this tradition was unshaken. It\r\nwas not until the advent of Vesalius that the doom of the ancient system\r\nwas sounded. Then, when Anatomy sprang to the front as the potent ally of\r\nMedicine, the science of healing entered upon a fresh stage, but this new\r\nforce did not make itself felt soon enough to seduce Cardan from the\r\naltars of the ancients to the worship of new gods. As long as he lived he\r\nwas a follower of the great masters, though at the same time his\r\nadmiration of the teaching of Vesalius was enthusiastic and profound. His\r\nlove of truth and sound learning forbade him to give unreflecting adhesion\r\nto the precepts of any man, however eminent, and when he found that Galen\r\nwas a careless commentator on Hippocrates,[264] and failed to elucidate\r\nthe difficulties with which he professed to deal, he did not spare his\r\ncensure.[265] In the _De Subtilitate_ he speaks of him as \"Verbosus et\r\nstudio contradicendi tædulus ut alterum vix ferre queas, in reliquo gravis\r\njactura artium posita sit, quam nostræ ætatis viri restituere conati\r\nsunt.\"[266] But as Galen's name is quoted as an authority on almost every\r\npage of the _Consilia Medica_, it may be assumed that Cardan's faith in\r\nhis primary theories was unshaken. In his Commentaries on Hippocrates,\r\nGalen professes a profound respect for his master, but the two great men\r\nmust be regarded as the leaders of rival schools; indeed it could hardly\r\nbe otherwise, seeing how vast was the mass of knowledge which Galen added\r\nto the art during his lifetime.\r\n\r\nHippocrates, by denying the supernatural origin of disease, by his method\r\nof diagnosis, by the importance he attached to air and diet, by his\r\ndiscriminating use of drugs, and by the simplicity of his system\r\ngenerally, had placed Medicine on a rational basis. In the six hundred\r\nyears' space which elapsed before the appearance of Galen, Medicine was\r\nbroken up into many rival schools. The Dogmatici and the Empirici for many\r\nyears wrangled undisturbed, but shortly after the Christian era the\r\nMethodici entered the field, to be followed later on by the Eclectici and\r\na troop of other sects, whose wranglings, and whose very names, are now\r\nforgotten. In his _History of Medicine_, Dr. Bostock gives a sketch of the\r\nattitude of Galen towards the rival schools. \"In his general principles he\r\nmay be considered as belonging to the Dogmatic sect, for his method was to\r\nreduce all his knowledge, as acquired by the observation of facts, to\r\ngeneral theoretical principles. These principles he indeed professed to\r\ndeduce from experience and observation,[267] and we have abundant proofs\r\nof his diligence in collecting experience and his accuracy in making\r\nobservations; but still, in a certain sense at least, he regards\r\nindividual facts and the details of experience as of little value,\r\nunconnected with the principles which he laid down as the basis of all\r\nmedical reasoning. In this fundamental point, therefore, the method\r\npursued by Galen appears to have been directly the reverse of that which\r\nwe now consider as the correct method of scientific investigation; and\r\nyet, such is the force of actual genius, that in most instances he\r\nattained the ultimate object in view, although by an indirect path. He was\r\nan admirer of Hippocrates, and always speaks of him with the most profound\r\nrespect, professing to act upon his principles, and to do little more\r\nthan expound his doctrines and support them by new facts and observations.\r\nYet in reality we have few writers whose works, both as to substance and\r\nmanner, are more different from each other than those of Hippocrates and\r\nGalen, the simplicity of the former being strongly contrasted with the\r\nabstruseness and refinement of the latter.\"\r\n\r\nThe antagonism between these two great men was not perhaps more marked\r\nthan might have been expected, considering that an interval of six hundred\r\nyears lay between them. However loyal he may have been to his master,\r\nGalen, with his keen, catholic, and subtle intellect, was bound to fall\r\nunder the sway of Alexandrian influence while he studied in Alexandria as\r\nthe pupil of Heraclianus. The methods of the contemporary school of\r\nphilosophy fascinated him; and, in his endeavour to bring Medicine out of\r\nthe chaotic welter in which he found it, he attempted--unhappily for the\r\nfuture of science--to use the hyper-idealistic Platonism then dominant in\r\nAlexandria, rather than the gradual and orderly induction of Hippocrates,\r\nas a bond of union between professional and scientific medicine; a false\r\nstep for which not even his great services to anatomy and physiology can\r\naltogether atone. Yet most likely it was this same error, an error which\r\npractically led to the enslavement of Medicine till the seventeenth\r\ncentury, which caused Cardan to regard him, and not Hippocrates, as his\r\nmaster. The vastness and catholicity of Galen's scheme of Medicine must\r\nhave been peculiarly attractive to a man of Cardan's temper; and that\r\nGalen attempted to reconcile the incongruous in the teleological system\r\nwhich he devised, would not have been rated as a fault by his Milanese\r\ndisciple.\r\n\r\nGalen taught as a cardinal truth the doctrine of the Hippocratic\r\nelements, heat, cold, moisture, and dryness, and a glance at the Consilium\r\nwhich Cardan wrote out on Archbishop Hamilton's illness, will show how\r\ncompletely he was under the sway of this same teaching. The genius of\r\nHippocrates was perhaps too sober and orderly to win his entire sympathy;\r\nthe encyclopædic knowledge, the literary grace, and the more daring\r\nflights of Galen's intellect attracted him much more strongly. Hippocrates\r\nscoffed at charms and amulets, while Galen commended them, and is said to\r\nhave invented the anodyne necklace which was long known and worn in\r\nEngland. There is no need to specify which of the masters Cardan would\r\nswear by in this matter. The choice which Cardan made, albeit it was\r\nexactly what might have been anticipated, was in every respect an\r\nunfortunate one. He put himself under a master whose teaching could have\r\nno other effect than to accentuate the failings of the pupil, whereas had\r\nhe let his mind come under the more regular discipline of Hippocrates'\r\nmethod, it is almost certain that the mass of his work, now shut in dusty\r\nfolios which stand undisturbed on the shelves for decade after decade,\r\nwould have been immeasurably more fruitful of good. With all his industry\r\nin collecting, and his care in verifying, his medical work remains a heap\r\nof material, and nothing more valuable. Learning and science would have\r\nprofited much had he put himself under the standard of the Father of\r\nMedicine, and still more if fate had sent him into being at some period\r\nafter the world of letters had learned to realize the capabilities of the\r\ninductive system of Philosophy.\r\n\r\nIt may readily be conceded that Cardan during his career turned to good\r\naccount the medical knowledge which he had gathered from the best\r\nattainable sources, and that he was on the whole the most skilful\r\nphysician of his age. He likewise foreshadowed the system of deaf mute\r\ninstruction. A certain Georgius Agricola, a physician of Heidelberg who\r\ndied in 1485, makes mention of a deaf mute who had learnt to read and\r\nwrite, but this statement was received with incredulity. Cardan, taking a\r\nmore philosophic view, declared that people thus afflicted might easily be\r\ntaught to hear by reading, and to speak by writing; writing was associated\r\nwith speech, and speech with thought, but written characters and ideas\r\nmight be connected without the intervention of sounds.[268] This view, put\r\nforward with all the authority of Cardan's name, would certainly rouse\r\nfresh interest in the question, and, whether stimulated by his words or\r\nnot, an attempt to teach deaf mutes was made by Pedro de Ponce, a Spanish\r\nDominican, about 1560. But it would not be permissible to claim for Cardan\r\nany share in the epoch-making discoveries in Medicine. Galen as an\r\nexperimental physiologist had brought diagnosis to a level unattained\r\nbefore. His methods had been abandoned by his successors, and practice had\r\nin consequence suffered deterioration, but Cardan, studying under the\r\nrevived Galenism, called into life by the teaching of Vesalius, went to\r\ndeal with his cures under conditions more favourable than those offered by\r\nany previous period of the world's history. His cure of Archbishop\r\nHamilton's asthma, over which Cassanate and the other doctors had failed,\r\nwas due to a more careful diagnosis and a more judicious application of\r\nexisting rules, rather than to the working of any new discoveries of his\r\nown. Viewed as a soldier in the service of Hygeia, how transient and\r\nslender is the fame of Cardan compared with that of Linacre, Vesalius, or\r\nHarvey! Were his claims to immortality to rest entirely on his\r\ncontribution to Medicine, his name would have gone down to oblivion along\r\nwith that of Cavenago, Camutio, Della Croce, and the multitude of jealous\r\nrivals who, according to his account, were ever plotting his downfall. But\r\nit was rescued from this fate by his excellence as a mathematician, by the\r\ninterest clinging to his personality, by the enormous range of his\r\nlearning, by his picturesque reputation as a dreamer of dreams, and a\r\nsearcher into the secrets of the hidden world. In an age when books were\r\nfew and ill-composed, his works became widely popular; because, although\r\nhe dealt with abstruse subjects, he wrote--as even Naudé admits--in a\r\npassably good style, and handled his subject with a lightness of touch\r\nwhich was then very rare. This was the reason why men went on reading him\r\nlong after his works had ceased to have any scientific value; which\r\ninduced writers like Burton and Sir Thomas Browne to embroider their pages\r\nfreely with quotations from his works, and thus make his name familiar to\r\nmany who have never handled a single one of his volumes.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat strange to find running through the complex web of Cardan's\r\ncharacter a well-defined thread of worldly wisdom and common-sense; to\r\nfind that a man, described by almost every one who has dealt with his\r\ncharacter as a credulous simpleton, one with disordered wits, or a\r\ndown-right madman, should, when occasion demanded, prove himself to be a\r\nsharp man of business. When Fazio died he left his son with a number of\r\nunsettled law-suits on hand, concerning which he writes: \"From my father's\r\ndeath until I was forty-six, that is to say for a space of twenty-three\r\nyears, I was almost continually involved in law-suits. First with\r\nAlessandro Castillione, surnamed Gatico, with respect to certain\r\nplantations, and afterwards with his kinsfolk. Next with the Counts of\r\nBarbiani, next with the college, next with the heirs of Dominico de\r\nTortis, who had held me in his arms when I was baptized. Out of all these\r\nsuits I came victorious. It was indeed a matter for surprise that I should\r\nhave got the better of Alessandro Castillione, seeing that his uncle sat\r\nas judge. Moreover, he had already got a decision against me, a decision\r\nwhich, as the jurisconsults declared, helped my case as the trial went on,\r\nand I was able to force him to pay me all the money which was in dispute.\r\nA like good fortune attended me while my claims were considered by the\r\nheads of the Milanese College, and finally rejected by several votes. Then\r\nafterwards, when they had decided to admit me, and when they tried to\r\nsubject me to certain rules which placed me on a footing inferior to their\r\nown, I compelled them to grant me full membership. In the case of the\r\nBarbiani, after long litigation and many angry words and much trouble, I\r\ncame to terms with them; and, having received the sum of money covenanted\r\nby agreement, I was entirely freed from vexation of the law.\"[269] Writing\r\ngenerally of his monetary dealings, Cardan says: \"Whenever I may have\r\nincurred a loss, I have never been content merely to retrieve the same, I\r\nhave always contrived to seize upon something extra.\"[270] Or again: \"If\r\nat any time I have lost twenty crowns, I have never rested until I have\r\nsucceeded in getting back these and twenty more in addition.\"[271]\r\n\r\nCardan left in his _Dicta Familiaria_ and _Præceptorum ad filios\r\nLibellus_ a long list of aphorisms and counsels, many of which give\r\nevidence of keen insight and busy observation of mankind, while some are\r\ndistinguished by a touch of humour rare in his other writings. He bids his\r\nchildren to be careful how they offend princes, and, offence being given,\r\nnever to flatter themselves that it has been pardoned; to live joyfully as\r\nlong as they can, for men are for the most part worn out by care; never to\r\ntake a wife from a witless stock or one tainted with hereditary disease;\r\nto refrain from deliberating when the mind is disturbed; to learn how to\r\nbe worsted and suffer loss; and to trust a school-master to teach\r\nchildren, but not to feed them. One of the dicta is a gem of quaint\r\nwisdom. \"Before you begin to wash your face, see that you have a towel\r\nhandy to dry the same.\" If all the instances of prodigies, portents,\r\nvisions, and mysterious warnings which Cardan has left on record were set\r\ndown in order, a perusal of this catalogue would justify, if it did not\r\ncompel, the belief that he was little better than a credulous fool, and\r\nraise doubts whether such a man could have written such orderly and\r\ncoherent works as the treatise on Arithmetic, or the book of the Great\r\nArt. But Cardan was beyond all else a man of moods, and it would be unfair\r\nto figure as his normal mental condition those periods of overwrought\r\nnervousness and the hallucinations they brought with them. In his old age\r\nthe nearness of the inevitable stroke, and the severance of all earthly\r\nties, led him to discipline his mind into a calmer mood, but early and\r\nlate during his season of work his nature was singularly sensitive to the\r\nwearing assaults of cares and calamities. In crises of this kind his mind\r\nwould be brought into so morbid a condition, that it would fall entirely\r\nunder the sway of any single idea then dominant; such idea would master\r\nhim entirely, or even haunt him like one of those unclean spectres he\r\ndescribes with such gusto in the _De Varietate_. What he may have uttered\r\nwhen these moods were upon him must not be taken seriously; these are the\r\nmoments to which the major part of his experiences of things _supra\r\nnaturam_ may be referred. But there are numerous instances in which he\r\ndescribes marvellous phenomena with philosophic calm, and examines them in\r\nthe true spirit of scepticism. In his account of the trembling of the bed\r\non which he lay the night before he heard of Gian Battista's marriage, he\r\ngoes on to say that a few nights after the first manifestation, he was\r\nonce more conscious of a strange movement; and, having put his hand to his\r\nbreast, found that his heart was palpitating violently because he had been\r\nlying on his left side. Then he remembered that a similar physical trouble\r\nhad accompanied the first trembling of the bed, and admits that this\r\nmanifestation may be referred to a natural cause, _i.e._ the palpitation.\r\nHe tells also how he found amongst his father's papers a record of a cure\r\nof the gout by a prayer offered to the Virgin at eight in the morning on\r\nthe first of April, and how he duly put up the prayer and was cured of the\r\ngout, but he adds: \"Sed in hoc, auxiliis etiam artis usus sum.\"[272] Again\r\nwith regard to the episode of the ignition of his bed twice in the same\r\nnight, without visible cause, he says that this portent may have come\r\nabout by some supernatural working; but that, on the other hand, it may\r\nhave been the result of mere chance. He tells another story of an\r\nexperience which befell him when he was in Belgium.[273] He was aroused\r\nearly in the morning by the noise made outside his door by a dog catching\r\nfleas. Having got out of bed to see to this, he heard the sound as of a\r\nkey being softly put into the lock. He told this fact to the servants, who\r\nat once took up the tale, and persuaded themselves that they had heard\r\nmany noises of the same kind, and others vastly more wonderful; in short,\r\nthe whole house was swarming with apparitions. The next night the noise\r\nwas repeated, and a second observation laid bare the real cause thereof.\r\nThe scratching of the dog had caused the bolt to fall into the socket, and\r\nthis produced the noise which had disquieted him. He writes in conclusion:\r\n\"Thus many events which seem to defy all explanation have really come to\r\npass by accident, or in the course of nature. Out of such manifestations\r\nas these the unlettered, the superstitious, the timorous, and the\r\nover-hasty make for themselves miracles.\"[274] Again, after telling a\r\nstrange story of a boy who beheld the image of a thief in the neck of a\r\nphial, and of some incantations of Josephus Niger, he concludes:\r\n\"Nevertheless I am of opinion that all these things were fables, and that\r\nno one could have had any real knowledge thereof, seeing that they were\r\nnothing else than vain triflings.\"[275]\r\n\r\nIn a nature so complex and many-sided as Cardan's, strange resemblances\r\nmay be sought for and discovered, and it certainly is an unexpected\r\nrevelation to find a mental attitude common to Cardan, a man tied and\r\nbound by authority and the traditions of antiquity, and such a daring\r\nassailant of the schools and of Aristotle as Doctor Joseph Glanvil. The\r\nconclusions of Cardan as to certain obscure phenomena recently cited show\r\nthat, in matters lying beyond sensual cognition, he kept an open mind. In\r\nsumming up the case of the woman said to have been cured by the\r\nincantations of Josephus Niger, he says that she must have been cured\r\neither by the power of the imagination, or by the agency of the demons.\r\nHere he anticipates the arguments which Glanvil sets forth in _Sadducismus\r\nTriumphatus_. Writing on the belief in witchcraft Glanvil says, \"We have\r\nthe attestation of thousands of eye and ear witnesses, and these not of\r\nthe easily-deceivable vulgar only, but of wise and grave discerners; and\r\nthat when no interest could oblige them to agree together in a common Lye.\r\nI say, we have the light of all these circumstances to confirm us in the\r\nbelief of things done by persons of despicable power and knowledge, beyond\r\nthe reach of Art and ordinary Nature. Standing public Records have been\r\nkept of these well-attested Relations, and Epochas made of those unwonted\r\nevents. Laws in many Nations have been enacted against those vile\r\npractices; those amongst the Jews and our own are notorious; such cases\r\nhave often been determined near us by wise and reverend Judges, upon clear\r\nand convictive Evidence; and thousands of our own Nation have suffered\r\ndeath for their vile compacts with Apostate spirits. All these I might\r\nlargely prove in their particular instances, but that 'tis not needful\r\nsince these did deny the being of Witches, so it was not out of ignorance\r\nof these heads of Argument, of which probably they have heard a thousand\r\ntimes; but from an apprehension that such a belief is absurd, and the\r\nthings impossible. And upon these presumptions they condemn all\r\ndemonstrations of this nature, and are hardened against conviction. And I\r\nthink those that can believe all Histories and Romances; That all the\r\nwiser would have agreed together to juggle mankind into a common belief of\r\nungrounded fables, that the sound senses of multitudes together may\r\ndeceive them, and Laws are built upon Chimeras; That the greatest and\r\nwisest Judges have been Murderers, and the sagest persons Fools, or\r\ndesigning Impostors; I say those that can believe this heap of\r\nabsurdities, are either more credulous than those whose credulity they\r\nreprehend; or else have some extraordinary evidence of their perswasion,\r\nviz.: That it is absurd and impossible that there should be a Witch or\r\nApparition.\"[276] Cardan's argument in the case of the sick woman, that it\r\nwould be difficult if not impossible to invent cause for her cure, other\r\nthan the power of imagination or Demoniac agency, if less emphatic and\r\nlengthy than Glanvil's, certainly runs upon parallel lines therewith, and\r\nsuggests, if it does not proclaim, the existence of such a thing as the\r\ncredulity of unbelief; in other words that those who were disposed to\r\nbrush aside the alternative causes of the cure as set down by him, and\r\nsearch for others, and put faith in them, would be fully as credulous as\r\nthose who held the belief which he recorded as his own.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[248] _De Varietate_, p. 314.\r\n\r\n[249] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xxxvii. p. 115.\r\n\r\n[250] \"Musicam, sed hanc anno post VI. scilicet MDLXXIV. correxi et\r\ntranscribi curavi.\"--_De Vita Propria_, ch. xlv. p. 176.\r\n\r\n[251] This is on p. 164.\r\n\r\n[252] Page 266.\r\n\r\n[253] _Judicium de Cardano_.\r\n\r\n[254] Page 57.\r\n\r\n[255] \"Ita nostra ætate, lapsi sunt clarissimi alioqui viri in hoc genere.\r\nBudæus adversus Erasmum, Fuchsius adversus Cornarium, Silvius adversus\r\nVesalium, Nizolius adversus Maioragium: non tam credo justis contentionum\r\ncausis, quam vanitate quadam et spe augendæ opinionis in\r\nhominibus.\"--_Opera_, tom. i. p. 135.\r\n\r\n[256] He writes in this strain in _De Vita Propria_, ch. xiv. p. 49, in\r\n_De Varietate Rerum_, p. 626, and in _Geniturarum Exempla_, p. 431.\r\n\r\n[257] On the subject of dissimulation Cardan writes: \"Assuevi vultum in\r\ncontrarium semper efformare; ideo simulare possum, dissimulare\r\nnescio.\"--_De Vita Propria_, ch. xiii. p. 42.

Cardan's work had indeed passed the ecclesiastical\r\ncensors in 1562; but in the estimation of Pius V. the smallest lapse from\r\nthe letter of orthodoxy would have seemed grave enough to send to prison,\r\nand perhaps to death, a man as deeply penetrated with the spirit of\r\nreligion as Cardan assuredly was. One of his chief reasons for refusing\r\nthe King of Denmark's generous offer was the necessity involved of having\r\nto live amongst a people hostile to the Catholic religion; and, in writing\r\nof his visit to the English Court, he declares that he was unwilling to\r\nrecognize the title of King Edward VI., inasmuch as by so doing he might\r\nseem to prejudice the rights of the Pope.[277] In spite of this positive\r\ntestimony, and the absence of any utterances of manifest heresy, divers\r\nwriters in the succeeding century classed him with the unbelievers. Dr.\r\nSamuel Parker in his _Tractatus de Deo_, published in 1678, includes him\r\namongst the atheistical philosophers; but a perusal of the Doctor's\r\nremarks leaves the reader unconvinced as to the justice of such a charge.\r\nThe term Atheism, however, was at this time used in the very loosest\r\nsense, and was even applied to disbelievers in the apostolical\r\nsuccession.[278] Dr. Parker writes, \"Another cause which acted, together\r\nwith the natural disposition of Cardan, to produce that odd mixture of\r\nfolly and wisdom in him, was his habit of continual thinking by which the\r\nbile was absorbed and burnt up; he suffered neither eating, pleasure, nor\r\npain to interrupt the course of his thoughts. He was well acquainted with\r\nthe writings of all the ancients--nor did he just skim over the heads and\r\ncontents of books as some do who ought not to be called learned men, but\r\nskilful bookmongers. Every author that Cardan read (and he read nearly\r\nall) he became intimately acquainted with, so that if any one disputing\r\nwith him, quoted the authority of the ancients, and made any the least\r\nslip or mistake, he would instantly set them right.\" Dr. Parker is as\r\ngreatly amazed at the mass of work he produced, as at his powers of\r\naccumulation, and maintains that Cardan believed he was endowed with a\r\nfaculty which he calls _repræsentatio_, through which he was able to\r\napprehend things without study, \"by means of an interior light shining\r\nwithin him. From which you may learn the fact that he had studied with\r\nsuch enduring obstinacy that he began to persuade himself that the visions\r\nwhich appeared before him in these fits and transports of the mind, were\r\nthe genuine inspirations of the Deity.\" This is evidently Dr. Parker's\r\nexplanation of the attendant demon, and he ends by declaring that Cardan\r\nwas rather fanatic than infidel.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the list of his vices and imperfections which\r\nCardan wrote down with his own hand. Out of such a heap of self-accusation\r\nit would have been an easy task for some meddlesome enemy to gather up a\r\nplentiful selection of isolated facts which by artful combination might be\r\nso arranged as to justify a formal charge of impiety. The most definite of\r\nthese charges were made by Martin del Rio,[279] who declares that Cardan\r\nonce wrote a book on the Mortality of the Soul which he was wont to\r\nexhibit to his intimate friends. He did not think it prudent to print this\r\nwork, but wrote another, taking a more orthodox view, called _De\r\nImmortalitate Animorum_. Another assailant, Theophile Raynaud, asserts\r\nthat certain passages in this book suggest, if they do not prove, that\r\nCardan did not set down his real opinions on the subject in hand. Raynaud\r\nends by forbidding the faithful to read any of Cardan's books, and\r\ndescribes him as \"Homo nullius religionis ac fidei, et inter clancularios\r\natheos secundi ordinis ævo suo facile princeps.\" Of all Cardan's books the\r\n_De Immortalitate Animorum_ is the one in which materials for a charge of\r\nimpiety might most easily be found. It was put together at a time when he\r\nhad had very little practice in the Greek tongue, and it is possible that\r\nmany of his conclusions may be drawn from premises only imperfectly\r\napprehended. Scaliger in his Exercitations seizes upon one passage[280]\r\nwhich, according to his rendering, implied that Cardan reckoned the\r\nintelligence of men and beasts to be the same in essence, the variety of\r\noperation being produced by the fact that the apprehensive faculty was\r\ninherent in the one, and only operative upon the other from without. But\r\nall through this book it is very difficult to determine whether the\r\npropositions advanced are Cardan's own, or those of the Greek and Arabian\r\nwriters he quotes so freely: and this charge of Scaliger, which is the\r\nbest supported of all, goes very little way to convict him of impiety. In\r\nthe _De Vita Propria_ there are several passages[281] which suggest a\r\nbelief akin to that of the Anima Mundi; he had without doubt made up his\r\nmind that this work should not see the light till he was beyond the reach\r\nof Pope or Council. The origin of this charge of impiety may be referred\r\nwith the best show of probability to his attempt to cast the horoscope of\r\nJesus Christ.[282] This, together with a diagram, is given in the\r\nCommentaries on Ptolemy, and soon after it appeared it was made the\r\noccasion of a fierce attack by Julius Cæsar Scaliger, who declared that\r\nsuch a scheme must be flat blasphemy, inasmuch as the author proved that\r\nall the actions of Christ necessarily followed the position of the stars\r\nat the time of His nativity. If Scaliger had taken the trouble to glance\r\nat the Commentary he would have discovered that Cardan especially guarded\r\nhimself against any accusation of this sort, by setting down that no one\r\nwas to believe he had any intention of asserting that Christ's divinity,\r\nor His miracles, or His holy life, or the promulgation of His laws were in\r\nany way influenced by the stars.[283] Naudé, in recording the censures of\r\nDe Thou, \"Verum extremæ amentiæ fuit, imo impiæ audaciæ, astrorum\r\ncommentitiis legibus verum astrorum dominum velle subjicere. Quod ille\r\ntamen exarata Servatoris nostri genitura fecit,\" and of Joseph Scaliger,\r\n\"impiam dicam magis, an jocularem audaciam quæ et dominum stellarum\r\nstellis subjecerit, et natum eo tempore putarit, quod adhuc in lite\r\npositum est, ut vanitas cum impietate certaret,\"[284] declares that it was\r\nchiefly from the publication of this horoscope that Cardan incurred the\r\nsuspicion of blasphemy; but, with his free-thinking bias, abstains from\r\nadding his own censure. He rates Scaliger for ignorance because he was\r\nevidently under the impression that Cardan was the first to draw a\r\nhoroscope of Christ, and attacks Cardan chiefly on the score of plagiary.\r\nHe records how divers writers in past times had done the same thing.\r\nAlbumasar, one of the most learned of the Arabs, whose _thema natalium_ is\r\nquoted by Roger Bacon in one of his epistles to Clement V., Albertus\r\nMagnus, Peter d'Ailly the Cardinal of Cambrai, and Tiberius Russilanus who\r\nlived in the time of Leo X., all constructed nativities of Christ, but\r\nCardan makes no mention of these horoscopists, and, according to the view\r\nof Naudé, poses as the inventor of this form of impiety, and is\r\nconsequently guilty of literary dishonesty, a worse sin, in his critics'\r\neyes, than the framing of the horoscope itself.\r\n\r\nThat there was in Cardan's practice enough of curiosity and independence\r\nto provoke suspicion of his orthodoxy in the minds of the leaders of the\r\npost-Tridentine revival, is abundantly possible; but there is nothing in\r\nall his life and works to show that he was, according to the standard of\r\nevery age, anything else than a spiritually-minded man.[285] It would be\r\nhard to find words more instinct with the true feeling of piety, than the\r\nfollowing taken from the fifty-third chapter of the _De Vita Propria_,--\"I\r\nlove solitude, for I never seem to be so entirely with those who are\r\nespecially dear to me as when I am alone. I love God and the spirit of\r\ngood, and when I am by myself I let my thoughts dwell on these, their\r\nimmeasurable beneficence; the eternal wisdom, the source and origin of\r\nclearest light, that true joy within us which never fears that God will\r\nforsake us; that groundwork of truth; that willing love; and the Maker of\r\nus all, who is blessed in Himself, and likewise the desire and safeguard\r\nof all the blessed. Ah, what depth and what height of righteousness,\r\nmindful of the dead and not forgetting the living. He is the Spirit who\r\nprotects me by His commands, my good and merciful counsellor, my helper\r\nand consoler in misfortune.\"\r\n\r\nTwo or three of Cardan's treatises are in the _materna lingua_, but he\r\nwrote almost entirely in Latin, using a style which was emphatically\r\nliterary.[286] His Latin is probably above the average excellence of the\r\nage, and if the classic writers held the first place in his estimation--as\r\nnaturally they would--he assuredly did not neglect the firstfruits of\r\nmodern literature. Pulci was his favourite poet. He evidently knew Dante\r\nand Boccaccio well, and his literary insight was clear enough to perceive\r\nthat the future belonged to those who should write in the vulgar tongue of\r\nthe lands which produced them.[287]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was impossible that a man endowed with so catholic a spirit and\r\nwith such earnest desire for knowledge, should sink into the mere pedant\r\nwith whom later ages have been made acquainted through the farther\r\nspecialization of science. At all events Cardan is an instance that the\r\nman of liberal education need not be killed by the man of science. For him\r\nthe path of learning was not an easy one to tread, and, as it not seldom\r\nhappens, opposition and coldness drove him on at a pace rarely attained by\r\nthose for whom the royal road to learning is smoothed and prepared. For a\r\nlong time his father refused to give him instruction in Latin, or to let\r\nhim be taught by any one else, and up to his twentieth year he seems to\r\nhave known next to nothing of this language which held the keys both of\r\nletters and science. He began to learn Greek when he was about\r\nthirty-five, but it was not till he had turned forty that he took up the\r\nstudy of it in real earnest;[288] and, writing some years later, he gives\r\nquotations from a Latin version of Aristotle.[289] In his commentaries on\r\nHippocrates he used a Latin text, presumably the translation of Calvus\r\nprinted in Rome in 1525, and quotes Epicurus in Latin in the _De\r\nSubtilitate_ (p. 347), but in works like the _De Sapientia_ and the _De\r\nConsolatione_ he quotes Greek freely, supplying in nearly every case a\r\nLatin version of the passages cited. These treatises bristle with\r\nquotations, Horace being his favourite author. \"Vir in omni sapientiæ\r\ngenere admirandus.\"[290] As with many moderns his love for Horace did not\r\ngrow less as old age crept on, for the _De Vita Propria_ is perhaps fuller\r\nof Horatian tags than any other of his works. It would seem somewhat of a\r\nparadox that a sombre and earnest nature like Cardan's should find so\r\ngreat pleasure in reading the elegant _poco curante_ triflings of the\r\nAugustan singer, were it not a recognized fact that Horace has always been\r\na greater favourite with serious practical Englishmen than with the\r\ndescendants of those for whom he wrote his verses.\r\n\r\nIt was a habit with Cardan to apologize in the prefaces of his scientific\r\nworks for the want of elegance in his Latin, explaining that the baldness\r\nand simplicity of his periods arose from his determination to make his\r\nmeaning plain, and to trouble nothing about style for the time being; but\r\nthe following passage shows that he had a just and adequate conception of\r\nthe necessary laws of literary art. \"That book is perfect which goes\r\nstraight to its point in one single line of argument, which neither leaves\r\nout aught that is necessary, nor brings in aught that is superfluous:\r\nwhich observes the rule of correct division; which explains what is\r\nobscure; and shows plainly the groundwork upon which it is based.\"[291]\r\n\r\nThe _De Vita Propria_ from which this extract comes is in point of style\r\none of his weakest books, but even in this volume passages may here and\r\nthere be found of considerable merit, and Cardan was evidently studious to\r\nlet his ideas be presented in intelligible form, for he records that in\r\n1535 he read through the whole of Cicero, for the sake of improving his\r\nLatin. His style, according to Naudé, held a middle place between the\r\nhigh-flown and the pedestrian, and of all his books the _De Utilitate ex\r\nAdversis Capienda_, which was begun in 1557, shows the nearest approach to\r\nelegance, but even this is not free from diffuseness, the fault which\r\nNaudé finds in all his writings. Long dissertations entirely alien from\r\nthe subject in hand are constantly interpolated. In the Practice of\r\nArithmetic he turns aside to treat of the marvellous properties of certain\r\nnumbers, of the motion of the planets, and of the Tower of Babel; and in\r\nthe treatise on Dialectic he gives an estimate of the historians and\r\nletter-writers of the past. But here Cardan did not sin in ignorance; his\r\npoverty and not his will consented to these literary outrages. He was paid\r\nfor his work by the sheet, and the thicker the volume the higher the\r\npay.[292]\r\n\r\nWhen he made a beginning of the _De Utilitate_ Cardan was at the zenith of\r\nhis fortunes. He had lately returned from his journey to Scotland, having\r\nmade a triumphant progress through the cities of Western Europe. Thus,\r\nwith his mind well stored with experience of divers lands, his wits\r\nsharpened by intercourse with the _élite_ of the learned world, and his\r\nhand nerved by the magnetic stimulant of success, he sat down to write as\r\nthe philosopher and man of the world, rather than as the man of science.\r\nHe was, in spite of his prosperity, inclined to deal with the more sombre\r\nside of life. He seems to have been specially drawn to write of death,\r\ndisease, and of the peculiar physical misfortune which befell him in early\r\nmanhood. Like Cicero he goes on to treat of Old Age, but in a spirit so\r\nwidely different that a brief comparison of the conclusions of the two\r\nphilosophers will not be without interest. Old age, Cardan declares to be\r\nthe most cruel and irreparable evil with which man is cursed, and to talk\r\nof old age is to talk of the crowning misfortune of humanity. Old men are\r\nmade wretched by avarice, by dejection, and by terror. He bids men not to\r\nbe deceived by the flowery words of Cicero,[293] when he describes Cato as\r\nan old man, like to a fair statue of Polycleitus, with faculties\r\nunimpaired and memory fresh and green. He next goes on to catalogue the\r\nnumerous vices and deformities of old age, and instances from Aristotle\r\nwhat he considers to be the worst of all its misfortunes, to wit that an\r\nold man is well-nigh cut off from hope; and by way of comment grimly adds,\r\n\"If any man be plagued by the ills of old age he should blame no one but\r\nhimself, for it is by his own choice that his life has run on so long.\" He\r\nvouchsafes a few words of counsel as to how this hateful season may be\r\nrobbed of some of its horror. Our bodies grow old first, then our senses,\r\nthen our minds. Therefore let us store our treasures in that part of us\r\nwhich will hold out longest, as men in a beleaguered city are wont to\r\ncollect their resources in the citadel, which, albeit it must in the end\r\nbe taken, will nevertheless be the last to fall into the foeman's hands.\r\nOld men should avoid society, seeing that they can bring nothing thereto\r\nworth having: whether they speak or keep silent they are in the way, and\r\nthey are as irksome to themselves when they are silent, as they are to\r\nothers when they speak. The old man should take a lesson from the lower\r\nanimals, which are wont to defend themselves with the best arms given them\r\nby nature: bulls with their horns, horses with their hoofs, and cats with\r\ntheir claws; wherefore an old man should at least show himself to be as\r\nwise as the brutes and maintain his position by his wisdom and knowledge,\r\nseeing that all the grace and power of his manhood must needs have\r\nfled.[294]\r\n\r\nIn another of his moral treatises he has formulated a long indictment\r\nagainst old age, that hateful state with its savourless joys and sleepless\r\nnights. Did not Zeno the philosopher strangle himself when he found that\r\ntime refused to do its work. The happiest are those who earliest lay down\r\nthe burden of existence, and the Law itself causes these offenders who are\r\nleast guilty to die first, letting the more nefarious and hardened\r\ncriminals stand by and witness the death of their fellows. There can be no\r\nevil worse than the daily expectation of the blow that is inevitable, and\r\nold age, when it comes, must make every man regret that he did not die in\r\ninfancy. \"When I was a boy,\" he writes, \"I remember one day to have heard\r\nmy mother, Chiara Micheria--herself a young woman--cry out that she wished\r\nit had been God's will to let her die when she was a child. I asked her\r\nwhy, and she answered: 'Because I know I must soon die, to the great peril\r\nof my soul, and besides this, if we shall diligently weigh and examine all\r\nour experiences of life, we shall not light upon a single one which will\r\nnot have brought us more sorrow than joy. For afflictions when they come\r\nmar the recollection of our pleasures, and with just cause; for what is\r\nthere in life worthy the name of delight, the ever-present burden of\r\nexistence, the task of dressing and undressing every day, hunger, thirst,\r\nevil dreams? What more profit and ease have we than the dead? We must\r\nendure the heat of summer, the cold of winter, the confusion of the times,\r\nthe dread of war, the stern rule of parents, the anxious care of our\r\nchildren, the weariness of domestic life, the ill carriage of servants,\r\nlawsuits, and, what is worst of all, the state of the public mind which\r\nholds probity as silliness; which practises deceit and calls it prudence.\r\nCraftsmen are counted excellent, not by their skill in their art, but by\r\nreason of their garish work and of the valueless approbation of the mob.\r\nWherefore one must needs either incur God's displeasure or live in misery,\r\ndespised and persecuted by men.'\"[295] These words, though put into his\r\nmother's mouth, are manifestly an expression of Cardan's own feelings.\r\n\r\nCardan was the product of an age to which there had recently been revealed\r\nthe august sources from which knowledge, as we understand the term, has\r\nflowed without haste or rest since the unsealing of the fountain. He\r\ncounts it rare fortune to have been born in such an age, and rhapsodizes\r\nover the flowery meadow of knowledge in which his generation rejoices, and\r\nover the vast Western world recently made known. Are not the artificial\r\nthunderbolts of man far more destructive than those of heaven? What praise\r\nis too high for the magnet which leads men safely over perilous seas, or\r\nfor the art of printing? Indeed it needs but little more to enable man to\r\nscale the very heavens. With his mind thus set upon the exploration of\r\nthese new fields of knowledge; with the full realization how vast was the\r\ntreasure lying hid therein; it was only natural that a spirit so curious\r\nand greedy of fresh mental food should have fretted at the piteous brevity\r\nof the earthly term allowed to man, and have rated as a supreme evil that\r\nold age which brought with it decay of the faculties and foreshadowed the\r\nspeedy and inevitable fall of the curtain. Cicero on the other hand had\r\nbeen nurtured in a creed and philosophy alike outworn. The blight of\r\nfinality had fallen upon the moral world, and the physical universe still\r\nguarded jealously her mighty secrets. To the eyes of Cicero the mirror of\r\nnature was blank void and darkness, while Cardan, gazing into the same\r\nglass, must have been embarrassed with the number and variety of the\r\nsubjects offered, and may well have felt that the longest life of man ten\r\ntimes prolonged would rank but as a moment in that Titanic spell of work\r\nnecessary to bring to the birth the teeming burden with which the universe\r\nlay in travail. Here is one and perhaps the strongest reason of his hatred\r\nof old age; because through the shortness of his span of time he could\r\nonly deal with a grain or two of the sand lying upon the shores of\r\nknowledge. Cicero, with his more limited vision, conscious that sixty\r\nyears or so of life would exhaust every physical delight, and blunt and\r\nmar the intellectual; ignorant both of the world of new light lying beyond\r\nthe void, and of the rapture which the conquering investigator of the same\r\nmust feel in wringing forth its secrets, welcomed the gathering shades as\r\nfriendly visitants, a mood which has asserted itself in later times with\r\ncertain weary spirits, sated with knowledge as Vitellius was sated with\r\nhis banquets of nightingales' tongues.\r\n\r\nCardan with all his curiosity and restless mental activity was hampered\r\nand restrained in his explorations by the bonds which had been imposed\r\nupon thought during the rule of authority. These bonds held him\r\nback--acting imperceptibly--as they held back Abelard and many other\r\ndaring spirits trained in the methods of the schoolmen, and allowed him to\r\ndo little more than range at large over the fields of fresh knowledge\r\nwhich were destined to be reaped by later workers trained in other schools\r\nand under different masters. Learning was still subject to authority,\r\nthough in milder degree, than when Thomas of Aquino dominated the mental\r\noutlook of Europe, and the great majority of the men who posed as\r\nFreethinkers, and sincerely believed themselves to be Freethinkers, were\r\nunconsciously swayed by the associations of the method of teaching they\r\nprofessed to despise. Their progress for the most part resembled the\r\nmovement of a squirrel in a rotatory cage, but though their efforts to\r\nconquer the new world of knowledge were vain, it cannot be questioned that\r\nthe restrictions placed around them, while nullifying the result of their\r\ninvestigations, stimulated enormously the activity of the brain and gave\r\nit a formal discipline which proved of the highest value when the real\r\nliterary work of Modern Europe began. The futilities of the problems upon\r\nwhich the scholastic thinkers exercised themselves gave occasion for the\r\nsatiric onslaught both of Rabelais and Erasmus. \"Quæstio subtilissima,\r\nutrum Chimæra in vacuo bombinans possit comedere secundas intentiones; et\r\nfuit debatuta per decem hebdomadas in Consilio Constantiensi,\" and \"Quid\r\nconsecrasset Petrus, si consecrasset eo tempore, quo corpus Christi\r\npendebet in cruce?\" are samples which will be generally familiar, but the\r\nvery absurdity of these exercitations serves to prove how strenuous must\r\nhave been the temper of the times which preferred to exhaust itself over\r\nsuch banalities as are typified by the extracts above written, rather than\r\nremain inactive. The dogmas in learning were fixed as definitely as in\r\nreligion, and the solution of every question was found and duly recorded.\r\nThe Philosopher was allowed to strike out a new track, but if he valued\r\nhis life or his ease, he would take care to arrive finally at the\r\nconclusion favoured by authority.\r\n\r\nCardan may with justice be classed both with men of science and men of\r\nletters. In spite of the limitations just referred to it is certain that\r\nas he surveyed the broadening horizon of the world of knowledge, he must\r\nhave felt the student's spasm of agony when he first realized the infinity\r\nof research and the awful brevity of time. His reflections on old age give\r\nproof enough of this. If he missed the labour in the full harvest-field,\r\nthe glimpse of the distant mountain tops, suffused for the first time by\r\nthe new light, he missed likewise the wearing labour which fell upon the\r\nshoulders of those who were compelled by the new philosophy to use new\r\nmethods in presenting to the world the results of their midnight research.\r\nSuch work as Cardan undertook in the composition of his moral essays, and\r\nin the Commentary on Hippocrates put no heavy tax on the brain or the\r\nvital energies; the Commentary was of portentous length, but it was not\r\nmuch more than a paraphrase with his own experiences added thereto.\r\nMathematics were his pastime, to judge by the ease and rapidity with which\r\nhe solved the problems sent to him by Francesco Sambo of Ravenna and\r\nothers.[296] He worked hard no doubt, but as a rule mere labour inflicts\r\nno heavier penalty than healthy fatigue. The destroyer of vital power and\r\nspring is hard work, combined with that unsleeping diligence which must be\r\nexercised when a man sets himself to undertake something more complex than\r\nthe mere accumulation of data, when he is forced to keep his mental powers\r\non the strain through long hours of selection and co-ordination, and to\r\nfix and concentrate his energies upon the task of compelling into symmetry\r\nthe heap of materials lying under his hand. The _De Subtilitate_ and the\r\n_De Varietate_ are standing proofs that Cardan did not overstrain his\r\npowers by exertion of this kind.\r\n\r\nLeaving out of the reckoning his mathematical treatises, the vogue enjoyed\r\nby Cardan's published works must have been a short one. They came to the\r\nbirth only to be buried in the yawning graves which lie open in every\r\nlibrary. At the time when Spon brought out his great edition in ten folio\r\nvolumes in 1663, the mists of oblivion must have been gathering around the\r\nauthor's fame, and in a brief space his words ceased to have any weight in\r\nthe teaching of that Art he had cultivated with so great zeal and\r\naffection. The mathematician who talked about \"Cardan's rule\" to his\r\npupils was most likely ignorant both of his century and his birthplace.\r\nHad it not been for the references made by writers like Burton to his\r\ndabblings in occult learning, his claims to read the stars, and to the\r\nguidance of a peculiar spirit, his name would have been now unknown, save\r\nto a few algebraists; and his desire, expressed in one of the meditative\r\npassages of the _De Vita Propria_, would have been amply fulfilled: \"Non\r\ntamen unquam concupivi gloriam aut honores: imo sprevi, cuperem notum esse\r\nquod sim, non opto ut sciatur qualis sim.\"[297]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[277] _De Vita Propria_, ch. xxix. p. 76.\r\n\r\n[278] Dugald Stewart, _Dissertations_, p. 378.\r\n\r\n[279] The writer, a Jesuit, says in _Disquisitionum Magicarum_ (Louvanii,\r\n1599), tom. i.:--\"In Cardani de Subtilitate et de Varietate libris passim\r\nlatet anguis in herba et indiget expurgatione Ecclesiasticæ limæ.\" Del Rio\r\nwas a violent assailant of Cornelius Agrippa.\r\n\r\n[280] \"Quoniam intellectus intrinsecus est homini, belluis extrinsecus\r\ncollucet: unus etiam satisfacere omnibus, quæ in una specie sunt potest,\r\nhominibus plures sunt necessarii: tertia est quod hominis anima tanquam\r\nspeculum est levigata, splendida, solida, clara: belluarum autem tenebrosa\r\nnec levis; atque ideo in nostra anima lux mentis refulget multipliciter\r\nconfracta, inde ipse Intellectus intelligit.
