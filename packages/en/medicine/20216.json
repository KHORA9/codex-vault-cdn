It seems only fitting then, that when put into more\r\npermanent form it should appear under the patronage of your name and\r\ntell of my cordial appreciation of more than a quarter of a century of\r\nvalued friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When we have thoroughly mastered contemporary science it is time to\r\nturn to past science; nothing fortifies the judgment more than this\r\ncomparative study; impartiality of mind is developed thereby, the\r\nuncertainties of any system become manifest.

Some\r\nof it was developed for a series of addresses at commencements of\r\nmedical schools and before medical societies, on the general topic how\r\nold the new is in surgery, medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy. The\r\ninformation thus presented aroused so much interest, the accomplishments\r\nof the physicians and surgeons of a period that is usually thought quite\r\nsterile in medical science proved, indeed, so astonishing, that I was\r\ntempted to connect the details for a volume in the Fordham University\r\nPress series. There is no pretence to any original investigation in the\r\nhistory of medicine, nor to any extended consultation of original\r\ndocuments. I have had most of the great books that are mentioned in the\r\ncourse of this volume in my hands, and have given as much time to the\r\nstudy of them as could be afforded in the midst of a rather busy life,\r\nbut I owe my information mainly to the distinguished German and French\r\nscholars who have in recent years made deep and serious studies of these\r\nOld Makers of Medicine, and I have made my acknowledgments to them in\r\nthe text as opportunity presented itself.\r\n\r\nThere is just one feature of the book that may commend it to\r\npresent-day readers, and that is that our medieval medical colleagues,\r\nwhen medicine embraced most of science, faced the problems of medicine\r\nand surgery and the allied sciences that are now interesting us, in very\r\nmuch the same temper of mind as we do, and very often anticipated our\r\nsolutions of them--much oftener, indeed, than most of us, unless we have\r\npaid special attention to history, have any idea of. The volume does not\r\nconstitute, then, a contribution to that theme that has interested the\r\nlast few generations so much,--the supposed continuous progress of the\r\nrace and its marvellous advance,--but rather emphasizes that puzzling\r\nquestion, how is it that men make important discoveries and inventions,\r\nand then, after a time, forget about them so that they have to be made\r\nover again? This is as true in medical science and in medical practice\r\nas in every other department of human effort. It does not seem possible\r\nthat mankind should ever lose sight of the progress in medicine and\r\nsurgery that has been made in recent years, yet the history of the past\r\nwould seem to indicate that, in spite of its unlikelihood, it might well\r\ncome about. Whether this is the lesson of the book or not, I shall leave\r\nreaders to judge, for it was not intentionally put into it.\r\n\r\nOUR LADY'S DAY IN HARVEST, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                                              PAGE\r\n\r\nI.

As a matter of fact,\r\nhowever, much more is known about Greek medical writers than those of\r\nany other period except the last century or two. Our histories of\r\nmedicine discuss Greek medicine at considerable length and practically\r\nall of the great makers of medicine in subsequent generations have been\r\ninfluenced by the Greeks. Greek physicians whose works have come down to\r\nus seem nearer to us than the medical writers of any but the last few\r\ncenturies. As a consequence we know and appreciate very well as a rule\r\nhow much Greek medicine accomplished, but in our admiration for the\r\ndiligent observation and breadth of view of the Greeks, we are sometimes\r\nprone to think that most of the intervening generations down to\r\ncomparatively recent times made very little progress and, indeed,\r\nscarcely retained what the Greeks had done. The Romans certainly justify\r\nthis assumption of non-accomplishment in medicine, but then in\r\neverything intellectual Rome was never much better than a weak copy of\r\nGreek thought. In science the Romans did nothing at all worth while\r\ntalking about. All their medicine they borrowed from the Greeks, adding\r\nnothing of their own. What food for thought there is in the fact, that\r\nin spite of all Rome's material greatness and wide empire, her world\r\ndominance and vaunted prosperity, we have not a single great original\r\nscientific thought from a Roman.\r\n\r\nThough so much nearer in time medieval medicine seems much farther away\r\nfrom us than is Greek medicine. Most of us are quite sure that the\r\nimpression of distance is due to its almost total lack of significance.\r\nIt is with the idea of showing that the medieval generations, as far as\r\nwas possible in their conditions, not only preserved the old Greek\r\nmedicine for us in spite of the most untoward circumstances, but also\r\ntried to do whatever they could for its development, and actually did\r\nmuch more than is usually thought, that this story of \"Old-Time Makers\r\nof Medicine\" is written. It represents a period--that of the Middle\r\nAges--that is, or was until recently, probably more misunderstood than\r\nany other in human history. The purpose of the book is to show at least\r\nthe important headlands that lie along the stream of medical thought\r\nduring the somewhat more than a thousand years from the fall of the\r\nRoman Empire under Augustulus (476) until the discovery of America.\r\nAfter that comes modern medicine, for with the sixteenth century the\r\nnames and achievements of the workers in medicine are\r\nfamiliar--Paracelsus, Vesalius, Columbus, Servetus, Caesalpinus,\r\nEustachius, Varolius, Sylvius are men whose names are attached to great\r\ndiscoveries with which even those who are without any pretence to\r\nknowledge of medical history are not unacquainted. In spite of nearly\r\nfour centuries of distance in time these men seem very close to us.\r\nTheir lives will be reserved for a subsequent volume, \"Our Forefathers\r\nin Medicine.\"\r\n\r\nIt is usually the custom to contemn the Middle Ages for their lack of\r\ninterest in culture, in education, in literature, in a word, in\r\nintellectual accomplishment of any and every kind, but especially in\r\nscience. There is no doubt about the occurrence of marked decadence in\r\nthe intellectual life of the first half of this period. This has\r\nsometimes been attributed to what has been called the inhibitory effect\r\nof Christianity on worldly interests. Religion is said to have occupied\r\npeople so much with thoughts of the other world that the beauties and\r\nwonders, as well as much of the significance, of the world around them\r\nwere missed. Those who talk thus, however, forget entirely the\r\ncircumstances which brought about the serious decadence of interest in\r\nculture and science at this time. The Roman Empire had been the guardian\r\nof letters and education and science. While the Romans were not original\r\nin themselves, at least they had shown intense interest in what was\r\naccomplished by the Greeks and their imitation had often risen to\r\nheights that made them worthy of consideration for themselves. They were\r\nliberal patrons of Greek art and of Greek literature, and did not\r\nneglect Greek science and Greek medicine. Galen's influence was due much\r\nmore to the prominence secured by him as the result of his stay in Rome\r\nthan would have been possible had he stayed in Asia. There are many\r\nother examples of Roman patronage of literature and science that might\r\nbe mentioned. As we shall see, Rome drained Greece and Asia Minor of\r\ntheir best, and appropriated to herself the genius products of the\r\nSpanish Peninsula. Rome had a way of absorbing what was best in the\r\nprovinces for herself.\r\n\r\nJust as soon as Rome was cut off from intimate relations with the\r\nprovinces by the inwandering of barbarians, intellectual decadence\r\nbegan. The imperial city itself had never been the source of great\r\nintellectual achievement, and the men whom we think of as important\r\ncontributors to Rome's literature and philosophy were usually not born\r\nwithin the confines of the city. It is surprising to take a list of the\r\nnames of the Latin writers whom we are accustomed to set down simply as\r\nRomans and note their birthplaces. Rome herself gave birth to but a very\r\nsmall percentage of them. Virgil was born at Mantua, Cicero at Arpinum,\r\nHorace out on the Sabine farm, the Plinys out of the city, Terence in\r\nAfrica, Persius up in Central Italy somewhere, Livy at Padua, Martial,\r\nQuintilian, the Senecas, and Lucan in Spain. When the government of the\r\ncity ceased to be such as assured opportunity for those from outside who\r\nwanted to make their way, decadence came to Roman literature. Large\r\ncities have never in history been the fruitful mothers of men who did\r\ngreat things. Genius, and even talent, has always been born out of the\r\ncities in which it did its work. It is easy to understand, then, the\r\ndecadence of the intellectual life that took place as the Empire\r\ndegenerated.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of all that it meant in the Roman Empire to look towards\r\nRome at this time, however, it seemed better to the early Christians to\r\nestablish the centre of their jurisdiction there. Necessarily, then, in\r\nall that related to the purely intellectual life, they came under the\r\ninfluences that were at work at Rome at this time. During the first\r\ncenturies they suffered besides from the persecutions directed against\r\nthem by the Emperors at various times, and these effectually prevented\r\nany external manifestations of the intellectual life on the part of\r\nChristians. It took much to overcome this serious handicap, but\r\nnoteworthy progress was made in spite of obstacles, and by the time of\r\nConstantine many important officials of the Empire, the educated\r\nthinking classes of Rome, had become Christians. After the conversion of\r\nthe Emperor opportunities began to be afforded, but political\r\ndisturbances consequent upon barbarian influences still further weakened\r\nthe old civilization until much of the intellectual life of it almost\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nGradually the barbarians, finding the Roman Empire decadent, crept in on\r\nit, and though much more of the invasion was peaceful than we have been\r\naccustomed to think, the Romans simply disappearing because family life\r\nhad been destroyed, children had become infrequent, and divorce had\r\nbecome extremely common, it was not long before they replaced the Romans\r\nalmost entirely. These new peoples had no heritage of culture, no\r\ninterest in the intellectual life, no traditions of literature or\r\nscience, and they had to be gradually lifted up out of their barbarism.\r\nThis was the task that Christianity had to perform. That it succeeded in\r\naccomplishing it is one of the marvels of history.\r\n\r\nThe Church's first grave duty was the preservation of the old records\r\nof literature and of science. Fortunately the monasteries accomplished\r\nthis task, which would have been extremely perilous for the precious\r\ntreasures involved but for the favorable conditions thus afforded.\r\nLibraries up to this time were situated mainly in cities, and were\r\nsubject to all the vicissitudes of fire and war and other modes of\r\ndestruction that came to cities in this disturbed period. Monasteries,\r\nhowever, were usually situated in the country, were built very\r\nsubstantially and very simply, and the life in them formed the best\r\npossible safeguard against fire, which worked so much havoc in cities.\r\nAs we shall see, however, not only were the old records preserved, but\r\nexcerpts from them were collated and discussed and applied by means of\r\ndirect observation. This led the generations to realize more and more\r\nthe value of the old Greek medicine and made them take further\r\nprecautions for its preservation.\r\n\r\nThe decadence of the early Middle Ages was due to the natural shifting\r\nof masses of population of this time, while the salvation of scientific\r\nand literary traditions was due to the one stable element in all these\r\ncenturies--the Church. Far from Christianity inhibiting culture, it was\r\nthe most important factor for its preservation, and it provided the best\r\nstimulus and incentive for its renewed development just as soon as the\r\nbarbarous peoples were brought to a state of mind to appreciate it.\r\n\r\nBearing this in mind, it is easier to understand the course of medical\r\ntraditions through the Middle Ages, and especially in the earlier\r\nperiod, with regard to which our documents are comparatively scanty,\r\nand during which the disturbed conditions made medical developments\r\nimpossible, and anything more than the preservation of the old authors\r\nout of the question. The torch of medical illumination lighted at the\r\ngreat Greek fires passes from people to people, never quenched, though\r\noften burning low because of unfavorable conditions, but sometimes with\r\nnew fuel added to its flame by the contributions of genius. The early\r\nChristians took it up and kept it lighted, and, with the Jewish\r\nphysicians, carried it through the troublous times of the end of the old\r\norder, and then passed it on for a while to the Arabs. Then, when\r\nfavorable conditions had developed again, Christian schools and scholars\r\ngave it the opportunity to burn brightly for several centuries at the\r\nend of the Middle Ages. This medieval age is probably the most difficult\r\nperiod of medical history to understand properly, but it is worth while\r\ntaking the trouble to follow out the thread of medical tradition from\r\nthe Greeks to the Renaissance medical writers, who practically begin\r\nmodern medicine for us.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that Christianity's influence on medicine,\r\ninstead of hampering, was most favorable. The Founder of Christianity\r\nHimself had gone about healing the sick, and care for the ailing became\r\na prominent feature of Christian work. One of the Evangelists, St. Luke,\r\nwas a physician. It was the custom a generation ago, and even later,\r\nwhen the Higher Criticism became popular, to impugn the tradition as to\r\nSt. Luke having been a physician, but this has all been undone, and\r\nHarnack's recent book, \"Luke the Physician,\" makes it very clear that\r\nnot only the Third Gospel, but also the Acts, could only have been\r\nwritten by a man thoroughly familiar with the Greek medical terms of his\r\ntime, and who had surely had the advantage of a training in the medical\r\nsciences at Alexandria. This makes such an important link in medical\r\ntraditions that a special chapter has been devoted to it in the\r\nAppendix.\r\n\r\nVery early in Christianity care for the ailing poor was taken up, and\r\nhospitals in our modern sense of the term became common in Christian\r\ncommunities. There had been military hospitals before this, and places\r\nwhere those who could afford to pay for service were kept during\r\nillness. Our modern city hospital, however, is a Christian institution.\r\nBesides, deformed and ailing children were cared for and homes for\r\nfoundlings were established. Before Christianity the power even of life\r\nand death of the parents over their children was recognized, and\r\ndeformed or ailing children, or those that for some reason were not\r\nwanted, were exposed until they died. Christianity put an end to this,\r\nand in two classes of institutions, the hospitals and the asylums,\r\nabundant opportunity for observation of illness was afforded. Just as\r\nsoon as Christianity came to be free to establish its institutions\r\npublicly, hospitals became very common. The Emperor Julian, usually\r\nknown as the Apostate, who hoped to re-establish the old Roman Olympian\r\nreligion, wrote to Oribasius, one of the great physicians of this time,\r\nwho was also an important official of his household, that these\r\nChristians had established everywhere hospitals in which not only their\r\nown people, but also those who were not Christians, were received and\r\ncared for, and that it would be idle to hope to counteract the influence\r\nof Christianity until corresponding institutions could be erected by the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, or, at least, just as soon as reasonable\r\nfreedom from persecution gave opportunity for study, Christian interest\r\nin the medical sciences began to manifest itself. Nemesius, for\r\ninstance, a Bishop of Edessa in Syria, wrote toward the end of the\r\nfourth century a little work in Greek on the nature of man, which is a\r\nstriking illustration of this. Nemesius was what in modern times would\r\nbe called a philosopher, that is, a speculative thinker and writer, with\r\nregard to man's nature, rather than a physical scientist. He was\r\nconvinced, however, that true philosophy ought to be based on a complete\r\nknowledge of man, body and soul, and that the anatomy of his body ought\r\nto be a fundamental principle. It is in this little volume that some\r\nenthusiastic students have found a description that is to them at least\r\nmuch more than a hint of knowledge of the circulation of the blood.\r\nHyrtl doubts that the passage in question should be made to signify as\r\nmuch as has been suggested, but the occurrence of any even distant\r\nreference to such a subject at this time shows that, far from there\r\nbeing neglect of physical scientific questions, men were thinking\r\nseriously about them.\r\n\r\nJust as soon as Christianity brought in a more peaceful state of affairs\r\nand had so influenced the mass of the people that its place in the\r\nintellectual life could be felt, there comes a period of cultural\r\ndevelopment represented in philosophy by the Fathers of the Church, and\r\nduring which we have a series of important contributors to medical\r\nliterature. The first of these was Aetius, whose career and works are\r\ntreated more fully in the chapter on \"Great Physicians in Early\r\nChristian Times.\" He was followed by Alexander of Tralles, probably a\r\nChristian, for his brother was the architect of Santa Sophia, and by\r\nPaul of AEgina, with regard to whom we know only what is contained in his\r\nmedical writings, but whose contemporaries were nearly all Christians.\r\nTheir books are valuable to us, partly because they contain quotations\r\nfrom great Greek writers on medicine, not always otherwise available,\r\nbut also because they were men who evidently knew the subject of\r\nmedicine broadly and thoroughly, made observations for themselves, and\r\ncontrolled what they learned from the Greek forefathers in medicine by\r\ntheir own experience. Just at the beginning of the Middle Ages, then,\r\nunder the fostering care of Christianity there is a period of\r\nconsiderable importance in the history of medical literature. It is one\r\nof the best proofs that we have not only that Christianity did not\r\nhamper medical development, but that, directly and indirectly, by the\r\nplace that it gave to the care of the ailing in life as well as the\r\nencouragement afforded to the intellectual life, it favored medical\r\nstudy and writing.\r\n\r\nA very interesting chapter in the story of the early Christian physician\r\nis to be found in what we know of the existence of women physicians in\r\nthe fourth and fifth centuries. Theodosia, the mother of St. Procopius\r\nthe martyr, was, according to Carptzovius, looked upon as an excellent\r\nphysician in Rome in the early part of the fourth century. She suffered\r\nmartyrdom under Diocletian. There was also a Nicerata who practised at\r\nConstantinople under the Emperor Arcadius. It is said that to her St.\r\nJohn Chrysostom owed the cure of a serious illness. From the very\r\nbeginning Christian women acted as nurses, and deaconesses were put in\r\ncharge of hospitals. Fabiola, at Rome, is the foundress of the first\r\nimportant hospital in that city. The story of these early Christian\r\nwomen physicians has been touched upon in the chapter on \"Medieval Women\r\nPhysicians,\" as an introduction to this interesting feature of\r\nSalernitan medical education.\r\n\r\nDuring the early Christian centuries much was owed to the genius and the\r\ndevotion to medicine of distinguished Jewish physicians. Their sacred\r\nand rabbinical writers always concerned themselves closely with\r\nmedicine, and both the Old Testament and the Talmud must be considered\r\nas containing chapters important for the medical history of the periods\r\nin which they were written. At all times the Jews have been\r\ndistinguished for their knowledge of medicine, and all during the Middle\r\nAges they are to be found prominent as physicians. They were among the\r\nteachers of the Arabs in the East and of the Moors in Spain. They were\r\nprobably among the first professors at Salerno as well as at\r\nMontpellier. Many prominent rulers and ecclesiastics selected Jewish\r\nphysicians. Some of these made distinct contributions to medicine, and a\r\nnumber of them deserve a place in any account of medicine in the making\r\nduring the Middle Ages. One of them, Maimonides, to whom a special\r\nchapter is devoted, deserves a place among the great makers of medicine\r\nof all time, because of the influence that he exerted on his own and\r\nsucceeding generations. Any story of the preservation and development of\r\nmedical teaching and medical practice during the Middle Ages would be\r\ndecidedly incomplete without due consideration of the work of Jewish\r\nphysicians.\r\n\r\nWestern medical literature followed Roman literature in other\r\ndepartments, and had only the Greek traditions at second hand. During\r\nthe disturbance occasioned by the invasion of the barbarians there was\r\nlittle opportunity for such leisure as would enable men to devote\r\nthemselves with tranquillity to medical study and writing. Medical\r\ntraditions were mainly preserved in the monasteries. Cassiodorus, who,\r\nafter having been Imperial Prime Minister, became a monk, recommended\r\nparticularly the study of medicine to the monastic brethren. With the\r\nfoundation of the Benedictines, medicine became one of the favorite\r\nstudies of the monks, partly for the sake of the health of the brethren\r\nthemselves, and partly in order that they might be helpful to the\r\nvillages that so often gathered round their monasteries. There is a\r\nwell-grounded tradition that at Monte Cassino medical teaching was one\r\nof the features of the education provided there by the monks. It is\r\ngenerally conceded that the Benedictines had much to do with the\r\nfoundation of Salerno. In the convents for women as well as the\r\nmonasteries for men serious attention was given to medicine. Women\r\nstudied medicine and were professors in the medical department of\r\nSalerno. Other Italian universities followed the example thus set, and\r\nso there is abundant material for the chapter on \"Medieval Women\r\nPhysicians.\"\r\n\r\nThe next phase of medical history in the medieval period brings us to\r\nthe Arabs. Utterly uninterested in culture, education, or science before\r\nthe time of Mohammed, with the growth of their political power and the\r\nfoundation of their capitals, the Arab Caliphs took up the patronage of\r\neducation. They were the rulers of the cities of Asia Minor in which\r\nGreek culture had taken so firm a hold, and captive Greece has always\r\nled its captors captive. With the leisure that came for study, Arabians\r\ntook up the cultivation of the Greek philosophers, especially Aristotle,\r\nand soon turned their attention also to the Greek physicians Hippocrates\r\nand Galen. For some four hundred years then they were in the best\r\nposition to carry on medical traditions. Their teachers were the\r\nChristian and Jewish physicians of the cities of Asia Minor, but soon\r\nthey themselves became distinguished for their attainments, and for\r\ntheir medical writings. Interestingly enough, more of their\r\ndistinguished men flourished in Spain than in Asia Minor. We have\r\nsuggested an explanation for this in the fact that Spain had been one of\r\nthe most cultured provinces of the Roman Empire, providing practically\r\nall the writers of the Silver Age of Latin literature, and evidently\r\npossessing a widely cultured people. It was into this province, not yet\r\nutterly decadent from the presence of the northern Goths, that the Moors\r\ncame and readily built up a magnificent structure of culture and\r\neducation on what had been the highest development of Roman\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Arabs on Western civilization, and especially on\r\nthe development of science in Europe, has been much exaggerated by\r\ncertain writers. Closely in touch with Greek thought and Greek\r\nliterature during the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries, it is easy to\r\nunderstand that the Arabian writers were far ahead of the Christian\r\nscholars of Europe of the same period, who were struggling up out of the\r\npractical chaos that had been created by the coming of the barbarians,\r\nand who, besides, had the chance for whatever Greek learning came to\r\nthem only through the secondary channels of the Latin writers. Rome had\r\nbeen too occupied with politics and aggrandizement ever to become\r\ncultured. In spite of this heritage from the Greeks, decadence took\r\nplace among the Arabs, and, as the centuries go on, what they do becomes\r\nmore and more trivial, and their writing has less significance. Just the\r\nopposite happened in Europe. There, there was noteworthy progressive\r\ndevelopment until the magnificent climax of thirteenth century\r\naccomplishment was reached. It is often said that Europe owed much to\r\nthe Arabs for this, but careful analysis of the factors in that progress\r\nshows that very little came from the Arabs that was good, while not a\r\nlittle that was unfortunate in its influence was borrowed from them with\r\nthe translations of the Greek authors from that language, which\r\nconstituted the main, indeed often the only, reason why Arabian writers\r\nwere consulted.\r\n\r\nWith the foundation of the medical school of Salerno in the tenth\r\ncentury, the modern history of medical education may be said to begin,\r\nfor it had many of the features that distinguish our modern university\r\nmedical schools. Its professors often came from a distance and had\r\ntravelled extensively for purposes of study; they attracted patients of\r\nhigh rank from nearly every part of Europe, and these were generous in\r\ntheir patronage of the school. Students came from all over, from Africa\r\nand Asia, as well as Europe, and when abuses of medical practice began\r\nto creep in, a series of laws were made creating a standard of medical\r\neducation and regulating the practice of medicine, that are interesting\r\nanticipations of modern movements of the same kind. Finally a law was\r\npassed requiring three years of preliminary work in logic and philosophy\r\nbefore medicine might be taken up, and then four years at medicine, with\r\na subsequent year of practice with a physician before a license to\r\npractise for one's self was issued. In addition to this there was a\r\nstill more surprising feature in the handing over of the department of\r\nwomen's diseases to women professors, and the consequent opening up of\r\nlicensure to practise medicine to a great many women in the southern\r\npart of Italy. The surprise that all this should have taken place in the\r\nsouth of Italy is lessened by recalling the fact that the lower end of\r\nthe Italian peninsula had been early colonized by Greeks, that its name\r\nin later times was Magna Graecia, and that the stimulus of Greek\r\ntradition has always been especially favorable to the development of\r\nscientific medicine.\r\n\r\nSalerno's influence on Bologna is not difficult to trace, and the\r\nprecious tradition of surgery particularly, which was carried to the\r\nnorthern university, served to initiate a period of surgery lasting\r\nnearly two centuries, during which we have some of the greatest\r\ncontributions to this branch of medical science that were ever made. The\r\ndevelopment of the medical school at Bologna anticipated by but a short\r\ntime that of a series of schools in the north Italian universities.\r\nPadua, Piacenza, Pisa, and Vicenza had medical schools in the later\r\nMiddle Ages, the works of some of whose professors have attracted\r\nattention. It was from these north Italian medical schools that the\r\ntradition of close observation in medicine and of thoroughly scientific\r\nsurgery found its way to Paris. Lanfranc was the carrier of surgery, and\r\nmany French students who went to Italy came back with Italian methods.\r\nIn the fourteenth century Guy de Chauliac made the grand tour in Italy,\r\nand then came back to write a text-book of surgery that is one of the\r\nmonuments in this department of medical science. Before his time,\r\nMontpellier had attracted attention, but now it came to be looked upon\r\nas a recognized centre of great medical teaching. The absence of the\r\nPopes from Italy and the influence of their presence at Avignon made\r\nitself felt. While culture and education declined in Italy in the midst\r\nof political disturbances, they advanced materially at the south of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nFor our generation undoubtedly the most interesting chapter in the\r\nhistory of medieval medicine is that which tells of the marvellous\r\ndevelopment of surgery that took place in the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies. Considerable space has been devoted to this, because it\r\nrepresents not only an important phase of the history of medicine, and\r\nrecalls the names and careers of great makers of medicine, but also\r\nbecause it illustrates exquisitely the possibility of important\r\ndiscoveries in medicine being made, applied successfully for years, and\r\nthen being lost or completely forgotten, though contained in important\r\nmedical books that were always available for study. The more we know of\r\nthis great period in the history of surgery, the more is the surprise at\r\nhow much was accomplished, and how many details of our modern surgery\r\nwere anticipated. Most of us have had some inkling of the fact that\r\nanaesthesia is not new, and that at various times in the world's history\r\nmen have invented methods of producing states of sensibility in which\r\nmore or less painless operations were possible. Very few of us have\r\nrealized, however, the perfection to which anaesthesia was developed, and\r\nthe possibility this provided for the great surgeons of the later\r\nmedieval centuries to do operations in all the great cavities of the\r\nbody, the skull, the thorax, and the abdomen, quite as they are done in\r\nour own time and apparently with no little degree of success.\r\n\r\nOf course, any such extensive surgical intervention even for serious\r\naffections would have been worse than useless under the septic\r\nconditions that would surely have prevailed if certain principles of\r\nantisepsis were not applied. Until comparatively recent years we have\r\nbeen quite confident in our assurance that antisepsis and asepsis were\r\nentirely modern developments of surgery. More knowledge, however, of\r\nthe history of surgery has given a serious set-back to this\r\nself-complacency, and now we know that the later medieval surgeons\r\nunderstood practical antisepsis very well, and applied it successfully.\r\nThey used strong wine as a dressing for their wounds, insisted on\r\nkeeping them clean, and not allowing any extraneous material of any\r\nkind, ointments or the like, to be used on them. As a consequence they\r\nwere able to secure excellent results in the healing of wounds, and they\r\nwere inclined to boast of the fact that their incisions healed by first\r\nintention and that, indeed, the scar left after them was scarcely\r\nnoticeable. We know that wine would make a good antiseptic dressing, but\r\nuntil we actually read the reports of the results obtained by these old\r\nsurgeons, we had no idea that it could be used to such excellent\r\npurpose. Antisepsis, like anaesthesia, was marvellously anticipated by\r\nthe surgical forefathers of the medieval period.\r\n\r\nIt has always seemed to me that the story of Medieval Dentistry\r\npresented an even better illustration of a great anticipatory\r\ndevelopment of surgery. This department represents only a small surgical\r\nspecialty, but one which even at that period was given over to\r\nspecialists, who were called dentatores. Guy de Chauliac's review of the\r\ndentistry of his time and the state of the specialty, as pictured by\r\nJohn of Arcoli, is likely to be particularly interesting, because if\r\nthere is any department of medical practice that we are sure is\r\ncomparatively recent in origin, it is dentistry. Here, however, we find\r\nthat practically all our dental manipulations, the filling of teeth,\r\nartificial dentures, even orthodontia, were anticipated by the dentists\r\nof the Middle Ages. We have only the compressed account of it which is\r\nto be found in text-books of general surgery, and while in this they\r\ngive mainly a heritage from the past, yet even this suffices to give us\r\na picture very surprising in its detailed anticipation of much that we\r\nhave been inclined to think of as quite modern in invention and\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nMedicine developed much more slowly than surgery, or, rather, lagged\r\nbehind it, as it seems nearly always prone to do. Surgical problems are\r\nsimple, and their solution belongs to a great extent to a handicraft.\r\nThat is, after all, what chirurgy, the old form of our word surgery,\r\nmeans. Medical problems are more complex and involve both art and\r\nscience, so that solutions of them are often merely temporary and lack\r\nfinality. During the Middle Ages, however, and especially towards the\r\nend of them, the most important branches of medicine, diagnosis and\r\ntherapeutics, took definite shape on the foundations that lie at the\r\nbasis of our modern medical science. We hear of percussion for abdominal\r\nconditions, and of the most careful study of the pulse and the\r\nrespiration. There are charts for the varying color of the urine, and of\r\nthe tints of the skin. With Nicholas of Cusa there came the definite\r\nsuggestion of the need of exact methods of diagnosis. A mathematician\r\nhimself, he wished to introduce mathematical methods into medical\r\ndiagnosis, and suggested that the pulse should be counted in connection\r\nwith the water clock, the water that passed being weighed, in order to\r\nget very definite comparative values for the pulse rate under varying\r\nconditions, and also that the specific gravity of fluids from the body\r\nshould be ascertained in order to get another definite datum in the\r\nknowledge of disease. It was long before these suggestions were to bear\r\nmuch fruit, but it is interesting to find them so clearly expressed.\r\n\r\nAt the very end of the Middle Ages came the father of modern\r\npharmaceutical chemistry, Basil Valentine. Already the spirit that was\r\nto mean so much for scientific investigation in the Renaissance period\r\nwas abroad. Valentine, however, owes little to anything except his own\r\ninvestigations, and they were surprisingly successful, considering the\r\ncircumstances of time and place. His practical suggestions so far as\r\ndrugs were concerned did not prove to have enduring value, but then this\r\nhas been a fate shared by many of the masters of medicine. There were\r\nmany phases of medical practice, however, that he insisted on in his\r\nworks. He believed that the best agent for the cure of the disease was\r\nnature, and that the physician's main business must be to find out how\r\nnature worked, and then foster her efforts or endeavor to imitate them.\r\nHe insisted, also that personal observation, both of patients and drugs,\r\nwas more important than book knowledge. Indeed, he has some rather\r\nstrong expressions with regard to the utter valuelessness of book\r\ninformation in subjects where actual experience and observation are\r\nnecessary. It gives a conceit of knowledge quite unjustified by what is\r\nreally known.\r\n\r\nWhat is interesting about all these men is that they faced the same\r\nproblems in medicine that we have to, in much the same temper of mind\r\nthat we do ourselves, and that, indeed, they succeeded in solving them\r\nalmost as well as we have done, in spite of all that might be looked for\r\nfrom the accumulation of knowledge ever since.\r\n\r\nIt was very fortunate for the after time that in the period now known as\r\nthe Renaissance, after the invention of printing, there were a number of\r\nserious, unselfish scholars who devoted themselves to the publication in\r\nfine printed editions of the works of these old-time makers of medicine.\r\nIf the neglect of them that characterized the eighteenth and early\r\nnineteenth centuries had been the rule at the end of the fifteenth and\r\nduring the sixteenth century, we would almost surely have been without\r\nthe possibility of ever knowing that so many serious physicians lived\r\nand studied and wrote large important tomes during the Middle Ages. For\r\nour forefathers of a few generations ago had very little knowledge, and\r\nalmost less interest, as to the Middle Ages, which they dismissed simply\r\nas the Dark Ages, quite sure that nothing worth while could possibly\r\nhave come out of the Nazareth of that time. What they knew about the\r\npeople who had lived during the thousand years before 1500 only seemed\r\nto them to prove the ignorance and the depths of superstition in which\r\nthey were sunk. That medieval scholars should have written books not\r\nonly well worth preservation, but containing anticipations of modern\r\nknowledge, and, though of course they could not have known that, even\r\nsignificant advances over their own scientific conditions, would have\r\nseemed to them quite absurd.\r\n\r\nFortunately for us, then, the editions of the early printed books, so\r\nmany of them monuments of learning and masterpieces of editorial work\r\nwith regard to medieval masters of medicine, were lying in libraries\r\nwaiting to be unearthed and restudied during the nineteenth century.\r\nGerman and French scholars, especially during the last generation, have\r\nrecovered the knowledge of this thousand years of human activity, and we\r\nknow now and can sympathetically study how the men of these times faced\r\ntheir problems, which were very much those of our own time, in almost\r\nprecisely the same spirit as we do ours at the present time, and that\r\ntheir solutions of them are always interesting, often thorough and\r\npractical, and more frequently than we would like to think possible,\r\nresemble our own in many ways. For the possibility of this we are\r\nlargely indebted originally to the scholars of the Renaissance. Without\r\ntheir work that of our investigators would have been quite unavailing.\r\nIt is to be hoped, however, that our recovery of this period will not be\r\nfollowed by any further eclipse, though that seems to be almost the rule\r\nof human history, but that we shall continue to broaden our sympathetic\r\nknowledge of this wonderful medieval period, the study of which has had\r\nso many surprises in store for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nGREAT PHYSICIANS IN EARLY CHRISTIAN TIMES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we know of the life of the Founder of Christianity and how much He\r\ndid for the ailing poor would make us expect that the religion that He\r\nestablished would foster the care and the cure of suffering humanity. As\r\nwe have outlined in the Introduction, the first of the works of\r\nChristian service that was organized was the care of the sick. At first\r\na portion of the bishop's house was given over to the shelter of the\r\nailing, and a special order of assistants to the clergy, the\r\ndeaconesses, took care of them. As Christians became more numerous,\r\nspecial hospitals were founded, and these became public institutions\r\njust as soon as freedom from persecution allowed the Christians the\r\nliberty to give overt expression to their feelings for the poor. While\r\nhospitals of limited capacity for such special purposes as the\r\nsheltering of slaves or of soldiers and health establishments of various\r\nkinds for the wealthy had been erected before Christianity, this was the\r\nfirst time that anyone who was ill, no matter what the state of his\r\npecuniary resources, could be sure to find shelter and care. The\r\nexpression of the Emperor Julian the Apostate, that admission to these\r\nhospitals was not limited to Christians, is the best possible evidence\r\nof the liberal charity that inspired them.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary passing student of the history of medicine or of hospital\r\nfoundation and organization, can have no idea of the magnitude of some\r\nof these institutions, and their importance in the life of the time,\r\nunless it is especially pointed out. St. Basil, about the middle of the\r\nfourth century, erected what was spoken of as \"a city for the sick,\"\r\nbefore the gates of Caesarea. Gregory of Nazianzen, his friend, says\r\n\"that well built and furnished houses stood on both sides of streets\r\nsymmetrically laid out about the church, and contained rooms for the\r\nsick, and the infirm of every variety were intrusted to the care of\r\ndoctors and nurses.\" There were separate buildings for strangers, for\r\nthe poor, and for the ailing, and comfortable dwellings for the\r\nphysicians and nurses. An important portion of the institution was set\r\napart for the care of lepers, which constituted a prominent feature in\r\nBasil's work in which he himself took a special interest. Earlier in the\r\nsame century Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine, had built\r\nsimilar institutions around Jerusalem, and during this same century\r\nnearly everywhere we have evidence of organization of hospitals and of\r\ncare for the ailing poor.\r\n\r\nNot only were hospitals erected, but arrangements were made for the care\r\nof the ailing poor in their own homes and for the visitation of them,\r\nand for the bringing to places adapted for their care and treatment of\r\nsuch as were found on the street, or neglected in their homes. The\r\nChurch evidently considered itself bound to care for men's bodies as\r\nwell as their souls, and many of the expressions in common use among\r\nChristians referred to this fact. Religion itself was spoken of as a\r\nmedicine of the soul and the body. Christianity was defined as the\r\nreligion of healing. The word salvation had a reference to both body and\r\nsoul. Baptism was spoken of as the bath of the soul, the holy Eucharist\r\nas the elixir of immortal life, and penance as the medicine of the soul.\r\nIt is not surprising to find, then, that Harnack has found among the\r\ntexts that illustrate the history of early Christian literature this\r\none: \"In every community there shall be at least one widow appointed to\r\nassist women who are stricken with illness, and this widow shall be\r\ntrained in her duties, neat and careful in her ways, shall not be\r\nself-seeking, must not indulge too freely in wine in order that she may\r\nbe able to take up her duties at night as well as by day, and shall\r\nconsider it her duty to keep the Church officials informed of all that\r\nseems necessary.\"\r\n\r\nThe saving of deformed and ailing infants or children whose parents did\r\nnot care to have the trouble of rearing them, required the establishment\r\nby the Christians of another set of institutions, Foundling Asylums and\r\nHospitals for Children. Until the coming of Christianity parents were\r\nsupposed to have the right of life and death over their children, and no\r\none questioned it. In every country in the world until the coming of\r\nChristianity this had always been the case. Besides, there were\r\ninstitutions for the care of the old. These are the classes of mankind\r\nwho are especially liable to suffer from disease, and the opportunity\r\nto study human ailments in such institutions could scarcely help but\r\nprovide facilities for clinical observation such as had not existed\r\nbefore. Unfortunately the work of Christianity was hampered, first by\r\nthe Roman persecutions, and then later by the invasion of the\r\nbarbarians, who had to be educated and lifted up to a higher plane of\r\ncivilization before they could be brought to appreciate the value of\r\nmedical science, much less contribute to its development.\r\n\r\nHarnack, whose writings in the higher criticism of Scripture have\r\nattracted so much attention in recent years, began his career in the\r\nstudy of Christian antiquities with a monograph on Medical Features of\r\nEarly Christianity.[1] He mentions altogether some sixteen physicians\r\nwho reached distinction in the earliest days of Christianity. Some of\r\nthese were priests, some of them bishops, as Theodotos of Laodicea;\r\nEusebius, Bishop of Rome; Basilios, Bishop of Ancyra, and at least one,\r\nHierakas, was the founder of a religious order. The first Christian\r\nphysicians came mainly from Syria, as might be expected, for here the\r\nold Greek medical traditions were active. Among them must be enumerated\r\nCosmas and Damian, physicians who were martyred in the persecution of\r\nDiocletian, and who have been chosen as the patrons of the medical\r\nprofession. Justinian erected a famous church to them. It became the\r\nscene of pilgrimages. Organizations of various kinds since, as the\r\nCollege of St. Come, and medical societies, have been named after them.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the interest of ecclesiastics in medical affairs may be\r\ngathered from a letter of Bishop Theodoret of Cyrus, directed to the\r\nprefect of the city, when he was about to leave the place. He wrote (see\r\nPuschmann, Vol. I., p. 494): \"When I took up the Bishopric of Cyrus I\r\nmade every effort to bring in from all sides the arts that would be\r\nuseful to the people. I succeeded in persuading skilled physicians to\r\ntake up their residence here. Among these is a very pious priest, Peter,\r\nwho practises medicine with great skill, and is well known for his care\r\nfor the people. Now that I am about to leave the city, some of those who\r\ncame at my invitation are preparing also to go. Peter seems resolved to\r\ndo this. I appeal to your highness, therefore, in order to commend him\r\nto your special care. He handles patients with great skill and brings\r\nabout many cures.\"\r\n\r\nDistinguished Christian writers and scholars, and the Fathers of the\r\nChurch in the early centuries, evidently paid much attention to\r\nmedicine. Tertullian speaks of medical science as the sister of\r\nphilosophy, and has many references to the medical doctrines discussed\r\nin his time. Lactantius, in his work, \"De Opificio Dei,\" has much to say\r\nwith regard to the human body as representing the necessity for design\r\nin creation. His teleological arguments have much more force now than\r\nthey would have had for people generally twenty years ago. We have come\r\nback to recognize the place of teleology. Clement of Alexandria was an\r\nearly Christian temperance advocate, who argued that the use of wine\r\nwas only justified when it did good as a medicine. The problems of\r\nembryology and of diseases of childhood interested him as they did many\r\nother of the early Christian writers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAETIUS\r\n\r\nThe first great Christian physician whose works meant much for his own\r\ntime, and whose writings have become a classic in medicine, was Aetius\r\nAmidenus, that is, Aetius of Amida, who was born in the town of that\r\nname in Mesopotamia, on the upper Tigris (now Diarbekir), and who\r\nflourished about the middle of the sixth century. His medical studies,\r\nas he has told us himself, were made at Alexandria. After having\r\nattracted attention by his medical learning and skill, he became\r\nphysician to one of the emperors at Byzantium, very probably Justinian,\r\n(527-565). He seems to have been succeeded in the special post that was\r\ncreated for him at court by Alexander of Tralles, the second of the\r\ngreat Christian physicians. There is no doubt that Aetius was a\r\nChristian, for he mentions Christian mysteries, and appeals to the name\r\nof the Saviour and the martyrs. He was evidently a man of wide reading,\r\nfor he quotes from practically every important medical writer before his\r\ntime. Indeed, he is most valuable for the history of medicine, because\r\nhe gives us some idea of the mode of treatment of various subjects by\r\npredecessors whose fame we know, but none of whose works have come to\r\nus. His official career and the patronage of the Emperor, the breadth\r\nof his scholarship, and the thoroughly practical character of his\r\nteaching, show how medical science and medical art were being developed\r\nand encouraged at this time.\r\n\r\nAetius' work that is preserved for us is known in medical literature as\r\nhis sixteen books on medical practice. In most of the manuscript it is\r\ndivided into four Tetrabibloi, or four book parts, each of which\r\nconsists of four sections called Logoi in Greek, Sermones in Latin. This\r\nwork embraces all the departments of medicine, and has a considerable\r\nportion devoted to surgery, but most of the important operations and the\r\nchapters on fractures and dislocations are lacking. Aetius himself\r\nannounces that he had prepared a special work on surgery, but this is\r\nlost. Doubtless the important chapters that we have noted as lacking in\r\nhis work would be found in this. He is much richer in pathology than\r\nmost of the older writers, at least of the Christian era; for instance,\r\nGurlt says that he treats this feature of the subject much more\r\nextensively even than Paulus AEginetus, but most of his work is devoted\r\nto therapeutics.\r\n\r\nAt times those who read these old books from certain modern standpoints\r\nare surprised to find such noteworthy differences between writers on\r\nmedicine, who are separated sometimes only by a generation, and\r\nsometimes by not more than a century, in what regards the comparative\r\namount of space given to pathology, etiology, and therapeutics. Just\r\nexactly the same differences exist in our own day, however. We all know\r\nthat for those who want pathology and etiology the work of one of our\r\ngreat teachers is to be consulted, while for therapeutics it is better\r\nto go to someone else. When we find such differences among the men of\r\nthe olden time we are not so apt to look at them with sympathetic\r\ndiscrimination, as we do with regard to our contemporaries. We may even\r\nset them down to ignorance rather than specialization of interest. These\r\ndifferences depend on the attitude of mind of the physician, and are\r\nlargely the result of his own personal equation. They do not reflect in\r\nany way either on his judgment or on the special knowledge of his time,\r\nbut are the index of his special receptivity and teaching habit.\r\n\r\nAetius' first and second books are taken up entirely with drugs. The\r\nfirst book contains a list of drugs arranged according to the Greek\r\nalphabet. In the third book other remedial measures, dietetic,\r\nmanipulative, and even operative, are suggested. In these are included\r\nvenesection, the opening of an artery, cupping, leeches, and the like.\r\nThe fourth and fifth books take up hygiene, special dietetics, and\r\ngeneral pathology. In the sixth book what the Germans call special\r\npathology and therapy begins with the diseases of the head. The first\r\nchapter treats of hydrocephalus. In this same book rabies is treated.\r\nWhat Aetius has consists mainly of quotations from previous authors,\r\nmany of whom he had evidently read with great care.\r\n\r\nConcerning those \"bitten by a rabid dog or those who fear water,\" Gurlt\r\nhas quoted the following expression, with regard to which most people\r\nwill be quite ready to agree with him when he says that it contains a\r\ngreat deal of truth, usually thought to be of much later origin: \"When,\r\ntherefore, any one has been bitten by a rabid dog the treatment of the\r\nwound must be undertaken just as soon as possible, even though the bite\r\nshould be small and only superficial. One thing is certain, that none of\r\nthose who are not rightly treated escape the fatal effect. The first\r\nthing to do is to make the wound larger, the mouth of it being divided\r\nand dilated by the scalpel. Then every portion of it and the surrounding\r\ntissues must be firmly pressed upon with the definite purpose of causing\r\na large efflux of blood from the part. Then the wound should be deeply\r\ncauterized, etc.\"\r\n\r\nThere are special chapters devoted to eye and ear diseases, and to\r\nvarious affections of the face. Under this the question of tattooing and\r\nits removal comes in. It is surprising how much Aetius has with regard\r\nto such nasal affections as polyps and ulcers and bleedings from the\r\nnose. In this book, however, he treats only of their medicinal\r\ntreatment. What he has to say about affections of the teeth is so\r\ninteresting that it deserves a paragraph or two by itself.\r\n\r\nHe had much to say with regard to the nervous supply of the mucous\r\nmembranes of the gums, tongue, and mouth, and taught that the teeth\r\nreceived nerves through the small hole existing at the end of every\r\nroot. For children cutting teeth he advised the chewing of hard objects,\r\nand thought that the chewing of rather hard materials was good also for\r\nthe teeth of adults. For fistulas leading to the roots of teeth he\r\nsuggests various irritant treatments, and, if they do not succeed,\r\nrecommends the removal of the teeth. He seems to have known much about\r\naffections of the gums and recognizes a benignant and malignant epulis.\r\nHe thought that one form of epulis was due to inflammation of a chronic\r\ncharacter, and suggests that if remedies do not succeed it should be\r\nremoved. His work is of interest mainly as showing that even at this\r\ntime, when the desire for information of this kind is usually supposed\r\nto have been in abeyance, physicians were gathering information about\r\nall sorts even of the minor ailments of mankind, gathering what had been\r\nwritten about them, commenting on it, adding their own observations, and\r\nin general trying to solve the problems as well as they could.\r\n\r\nAetius seems to have had a pretty good idea of diphtheria. He speaks of\r\nit in connection with other throat manifestations under the heading of\r\n\"crusty and pestilent ulcers of the tonsils.\" He divides the anginas\r\ngenerally into four kinds. The first consists of inflammation of the\r\nfauces with the classic symptoms, the second presents no inflammation of\r\nthe mouth nor of the fauces, but is complicated by a sense of\r\nsuffocation--apparently our croup. The third consists of external and\r\ninternal inflammation of the mouth and throat, extending towards the\r\nchin. The fourth is an affection rather of the neck, due to an\r\ninflammation of the vertebrae--retropharyngeal abscess--that may be\r\nfollowed by luxation and is complicated by great difficulty of\r\nrespiration. All of these have as a common symptom difficulty of\r\nswallowing. This is greater in one variety than in another at different\r\ntimes. In certain affections even \"drinks when taken are returned\r\nthrough the nose.\"\r\n\r\nHypertrophy of the tonsils--Aetius speaks of them as glands--is to be\r\ntreated by various astringent remedies, but if these fail the structures\r\nshould be excised. His description of the excision is rather clear and\r\ndetailed. The patient should be put in a good full light, and the mouth\r\nshould be held open and each gland pulled forward by a hook and excised.\r\nThe operator should be careful, however, only to excise those portions\r\nthat are beyond the natural size, for if any of the natural substance of\r\nthe gland is cut into, or if the incision is made beyond the projecting\r\nportion of the tonsil, there is grave danger of serious hemorrhage.\r\nAfter excision a mixture of water and vinegar should be kept in the\r\nmouth for some time. This should be administered cold in order to\r\nprevent the flow of blood. After this very cold water should be taken.\r\n\r\nIn this same book, Chapter L, he treats of foreign bodies in the\r\nrespiratory and upper digestive tracts. If there is anything in the\r\nlarynx or the bronchial tubes the attempt must be made to secure its\r\nejection by the production of coughing or sneezing. If the foreign body\r\ncan be seen it should be grasped with a pincers and removed. If it is in\r\nthe esophagus, Aetius suggests that the patient should be made to\r\nswallow a sponge dipped in grease, or a piece of fat meat, to either of\r\nwhich a string has been attached, in order that the foreign body may be\r\ncaught and drawn out. If it seems preferable to carry the body on into\r\nthe stomach, the swallowing of large mouthfuls of fresh bread or other\r\nsuch material is recommended.\r\n\r\nWith regard to goitre, Aetius has some interesting details. He says\r\nthat \"all tumors occurring in the throat region are called bronchoceles,\r\nfor every tumor among the ancients was called a cele, and, though the\r\nname is common to them, they differ very much from one another.\" Some of\r\nthem are fatty, some of them are pultaceous, some of them are cancerous,\r\nand some of them he calls honey tumors, because of a honey-like humor\r\nthey contain. \"Sometimes they are due to a local dilatation of the blood\r\nvessels, and this is most frequently connected with parturition,\r\napparently being due to the drawing of the breath being prevented or\r\nrepressed during the most violent pains of the patient. Such local\r\ndilatation at this point of the veins is incurable, but there are also\r\nhard tumors like scirrhus and malignant tumors, and those of great size.\r\nWith the exception of these last, _all the tumors of this region are\r\neasily cured_, yielding either to surgery or to remedies. Surgery must\r\nbe adapted to the special tumor, whether it be honey-like or fatty, or\r\npultaceous.\" The prognosis of goitrous tumors is much better than might\r\nbe expected, but evidently Aetius saw a number of the functional\r\ndisturbances and enlargements of the thyroid gland, which are so\r\nvariable in character as apparently to be quite amenable to treatment.\r\n\r\nAetius' treatment of the subject of varicosities is quite complete in\r\nits suggestions. \"The term varices,\" he says, \"is applied to dilated\r\nveins, which occur sometimes in connection with the testes and sometimes\r\nin the limbs. Operations on testicular varices patients do not readily\r\nconsent to; those on the limbs may be cured in several ways. First,\r\nsimple section of the skin lying above the dilated vessel is made, and\r\nwith the hook it is separated from the neighboring tissues and tied.\r\nAfter this the dilated portion is removed and pressure applied by means\r\nof a bandage. The patient is ordered to remain quiet, but with the legs\r\nhigher than the head. Some people prefer treatment by means of the\r\ncautery.\" Gurlt, in his \"History of Surgery,\" calls attention to the\r\nfact that two of our modern methods of treating varicose veins are thus\r\ndiscussed in Aetius, that by ligation and that by the cautery. The\r\ncautery was applied over a space the breadth of a finger at several\r\npoints along the dilated veins.\r\n\r\nAetius' chapters on obstetrics and gynaecology are of special interest,\r\nbecause, while we are prone to think that gynaecology particularly is a\r\ncomparatively modern development of surgery, this surgical authority of\r\nthe early Middle Ages treats it rather exhaustively. His sixteenth book\r\nis for the most part (one hundred and eleven chapters of it) devoted to\r\nthese two subjects. He has a number of interesting details in the first\r\nthirty-six chapters with regard to conception, pregnancy, labor, and\r\nlactation, which show how practical were the views of the physicians of\r\nthe time. Gurlt has given us some details of his chapters on diseases of\r\nthe breast. Aetius differentiates phagedenic and rodent ulcers and\r\ncancer. All the ordinary forms of phagedenic ulcer yield to treatment,\r\nwhile malignant growths are rendered worse by them. Where ulcers are\r\nold, he suggests the removal of their thickened edges by the cautery,\r\nfor this hastens cure and prevents hemorrhage. With regard to cancer,\r\nhe quotes from Archigenes and Leonides. He says that these tumors are\r\nvery frequent in women, and quite rare in men. Even at this time cancer\r\nhad been observed and recognized in the male breast. He emphasizes the\r\nfact that cancerous nodules become prominent and become attached to\r\nsurrounding tissues. There are two forms, those with ulcer, and those\r\nwithout. He describes the enlargement of the veins that follows, the\r\nactual varicosities, and the dusky or livid redness of the parts which\r\nseem to be soft, but are really very hard. He says that they are often\r\ncomplicated by very painful conditions, and that they cause enlargement\r\nof the glands and of the arms. The pain may spread to the clavicle and\r\nthe scapula, and he seems to think that it is the pain that causes the\r\nenlargement of the glands at a distance.\r\n\r\nHis description of ulcerative cancer of the breast is very striking. He\r\nsays that it erodes without cause, penetrating ever deeper and deeper,\r\nand cannot be stopped until it emits a secretion worse than the poison\r\nof wild beasts, copious and abominable to the smell. With these other\r\nsymptoms pains are present. This form of cancer is especially made worse\r\nby drugs and by all manner of manipulation. The paragraph from Leonides\r\nquoted by Aetius gives a description of operation for cancer of the\r\nbreast, in which he insists particularly on the extensive removal of\r\ntissue and the free use of the cautery. \"The cautery is used at first in\r\norder to prevent bleeding, but also because it helps to destroy the\r\nremains of diseased tissues. When the burning is deep, prognosis is\r\nmuch better. Even in cases where indurated tumors of the breast occur\r\nthat might be removed without danger of bleeding, it is better to use\r\nthe cautery freely, though the amputation of such a portion down to the\r\nhealthy parts may suffice.\" Aetius quotes this with approval.\r\n\r\nOthers before Aetius had suggested the connection between hypertrophy of\r\nthe clitoris and certain exaggerated manifestations of the sexual\r\ninstinct, and the development of vicious sexual habits. As might be\r\nexpected from this first great Christian physician and surgeon, he\r\nemphasizes this etiology for certain cases, and outlines an operation\r\nfor it. This operation had been suggested before, but Aetius goes into\r\nit in detail and describes just how the operation should be done, so as\r\nto secure complete amputation of the enlarged organ, yet without injury.\r\nHe warns of the danger of removing more than just the structure itself,\r\nbecause this may give rise to ugly and bothersome scars. After the\r\noperation a sponge wet with astringent wine should be applied, or cold\r\nwater, especially if there is much tendency to bleeding, and afterwards\r\na sponge with manna or frankincense scattered over it should be bound\r\non. He treats of other pathological conditions of the female genitalia,\r\nvaricose veins, growths of various kinds, hypertrophy of the _portio\r\nvaginalis uteri_, an operation for which is described, and of various\r\ntumors. He describes epithelioma very clearly, enumerates its most\r\nfrequent locations in their order, lays down its bad prognosis, and\r\nhence the necessity for early operation with entire removal of the new\r\ngrowth whenever possible. He feared hemorrhage very much, however, and\r\nwarns with regard to it, and evidently had had some very unfortunate\r\nexperiences in the treatment of these conditions.\r\n\r\nAetius seems to have had as thoroughly scientific an interest in certain\r\nphases of chemistry apart from medicine as any educated physician of the\r\nmodern time might have. Mr. A.P. Laurie, in his \"Materials of the\r\nPrinter's Craft,\"[2] calls attention to the fact that the earliest\r\nreference to the use of drying oil for varnish is made by the physician\r\nAetius.\r\n\r\nAetius, or Aetios, to use for the nonce the Greek spelling of his name,\r\nwhich sometimes occurs in medical literature, and should be known, has\r\nbeen the subject of very varied estimation at different times. About the\r\ntime of the Renaissance he was one of the first of the early writers on\r\nmedicine accorded the honor of printing, and then was reprinted many\r\ntimes, so that his estimation was very high. With the reawakening of\r\nclinical medicine in the seventeenth century his reputation waxed again,\r\nand Boerhaave declared that the works of Aetius had as much importance\r\nfor physicians as had the Pandects of Justinian for lawyers. This high\r\nestimation had survived almost from the time of the Renaissance, when\r\nCornelius went so far as to say: \"Believe me, that whoever is deeply\r\ndesirous of studying things medical, if he would have the whole of Galen\r\nabbreviated and the whole of Oribasius extended, and the whole of Paulus\r\n(of AEgina) amplified, if he would have all the special remedies of the\r\nold physicians as well in pharmacy as in surgery boiled down to a summa\r\nfor all affections, he will find it in Aetius.\" Naturally enough, this\r\nexaggerated estimation was followed by a reaction, in which Aetius came\r\nto be valued at much less than he deserved. After all is taken into\r\naccount in the vicissitudes of his fame, it is clear, however, that he\r\nis one of the most important links in the chain of medical tradition,\r\nand himself worthy to be classed among makers of medicine for his\r\npersonal observations and efforts to pass on the teachings of the old to\r\nsucceeding generations.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER OF TRALLES\r\n\r\nAn even more striking example than the life and work of Aetius as\r\nevidence for the encouragement and patronage of medicine in early\r\nChristian times, is to be found in the career of Alexander of Tralles,\r\nwhose writings have been the subject of most careful attention in the\r\nRenaissance period and in our own, and who must be considered one of the\r\ngreat independent thinkers in medicine. While it is usually assumed that\r\nwhatever there was of medical writing during the Middle Ages was mere\r\ncopying and compilation, here at least is a man who could not only\r\njudiciously select, but who could critically estimate the value of\r\nmedical opinions and procedure, and weighing them by his own experience\r\nand observation, turn out work that was valuable for all succeeding\r\ngenerations. The modern German school of medical historians have agreed\r\nin declaring him an independent thinker and physician, who represents a\r\ndistinct link in medical tradition.\r\n\r\nHe came of a distinguished family, in which the following of medicine as\r\na profession might be looked upon as hereditary. His father was a\r\nphysician, and it is probable that there were physicians in preceding\r\ngenerations, and one of his brothers, Dioscoros, was also a successful\r\nphysician. Altogether four of his brothers reached such distinction in\r\ntheir life work that their names have come down to us through nearly\r\nfifteen hundred years. The eldest of them was Anthemios, the builder of\r\nthe great church of Santa Sophia in Constantinople. As this is one of\r\nthe world's great churches, and still stands for the admiration of men a\r\nmillennium and a half after its completion, it is easy to understand\r\nthat Anthemios' reputation is well founded. A second brother was\r\nMetrodoros, a distinguished grammarian and teacher, especially of the\r\nyouthful nobility of Byzantium, as it was then called, or\r\nConstantinople, as we have come to call it. A third brother was a\r\nprominent jurist, also in Constantinople. The fourth brother, Dioscoros,\r\nlike Alexander, a physician, remained in his birthplace, Tralles, and\r\nacquired there a great practice.\r\n\r\nIt was with his father at Tralles that Alexander received his early\r\nmedical training. The father of a friend and colleague, Cosmas, who\r\nlater dedicated a book to Alexander, was also his teacher, while he was\r\nin his native city. As a young man, Alexander undertook extensive\r\ntravels, which led him into Italy, Gaul, Spain, and Africa, everywhere\r\ngathering medical knowledge and medical experience. Then he settled down\r\nat Rome, probably in an official position, and practised medicine\r\nsuccessfully until a very old age. He was probably eighty years of age\r\nwhen, some time during the first decade of the seventh century, he died.\r\n\r\nPuschmann, who has made a special study of Alexander's life and work,\r\nsuggests that since some of his books have the form of academic lectures\r\nhe was probably a teacher of medicine at Rome. As might be expected from\r\nwhat we know of the relations of the rest of the family to the nobility\r\nof the time, it is easy to understand, especially in connection with\r\nhints in Alexander's favorite modes of therapeutics, that costliness of\r\nremedies made no difference to his patients, that he must have had the\r\ntreatment of some of the wealthiest families in Rome.\r\n\r\nHis principal work is a Treatise on the Pathology and Therapeutics of\r\nInternal Diseases, in twelve books. The first eleven books were\r\nevidently material gathered for lectures or teaching of some kind. The\r\ntwelfth book, in which considerable use of Aetius' writings is made, was\r\nwritten, according to Puschmann, toward the end of Alexander's life, and\r\nwas meant to contain supplementary matter, comprising especially his\r\nviews gathered from observation as to the pathology of internal\r\ndiseases. A shorter treatise of Alexander is with regard to intestinal\r\nparasites. There are many printed editions of these books, and many\r\nmanuscript copies are in existence. Alexander was often quoted during\r\nthe Middle Ages, and in recent years, with the growth of our knowledge\r\nof medical history, he has come to be a favorite subject of study.\r\n\r\nAlexander's first book of pathology and therapeutics treats of head and\r\nbrain diseases. For baldness, the first symptom of which is falling out\r\nof the hair, he counsels cutting the hair short, washing the scalp\r\nvigorously, and the rubbing in of sulphur ointments. For grey hair he\r\nsuggests certain hair dyes, as nutgalls, red wine, and so forth. For\r\ndandruff, which he described as the excessive formation of small\r\nflake-like scales, he recommends rubbing with wine, with certain salves,\r\nand washing with salt water.\r\n\r\nHe gives a good deal of attention to diseases of the nervous system. He\r\nhas a rather interesting chapter on headache. The affection occurs in\r\nconnection with fevers, after excess in drinking, and as a consequence\r\nof injury to the skull. Besides, it develops as a result of disturbances\r\nof the natural processes in the head, the stomach, the liver, and the\r\nspleen. Headache, as the first symptom of inflammation of the brain, is\r\noften the forerunner of convulsions, delirium, and sudden death. Chronic\r\nor recurrent headache occurs in connection with plethora, diseases of\r\nthe brain, biliousness, digestive disturbances, insomnia, and continued\r\nworry. Hemicrania has its origin in the brain, because of the presence\r\nof toxic materials, and specially their transformation into gaseous\r\nsubstances. It also occurs in connection with abdominal affections. This\r\nlatter remark particularly is directed to the cases which occur in\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nFor apoplexy and the consequent paralysis, Alexander considered\r\nvenesection the best remedy. Massage, rubbings, baths, and warm\r\napplications are recommended for the paralytic conditions. He had\r\nevidently had considerable experience with epilepsy. It develops either\r\nfrom injuries of the head or from disturbances of the stomach, or\r\noccasionally other parts of the body. When it occurs in nursing infants,\r\nnourishment is the best remedy, and he gives detailed directions for the\r\nselection of a wet nurse, and very careful directions as to her mode of\r\nlife. He emphasizes very much the necessity for careful attention to the\r\ngastro-intestinal tract in many cases of epilepsy. Planned diet and\r\nregular bowels are very helpful. He rejects treatment of the condition\r\nby surgery of the head, either by trephining or by incisions, or\r\ncauterization. Regular exercise, baths, sexual abstinence are the\r\nfoundation of any successful treatment. It is probable that we have\r\nreturned to Alexander's treatment of epilepsy much more nearly than is\r\ngenerally thought. There are those who still think that remedies of\r\nvarious kinds do good, but in the large epileptic colonies regular\r\nexercise, bland diet, regulation of the bowels, and avoidance of\r\nexcesses of all kinds, with occupation of mind, constitute the mainstay\r\nof their treatment.\r\n\r\nAlexander has much to say with regard to phrenitis, a febrile condition\r\ncomplicated by delirium, which, following Galen, he considers an\r\naffection of the brain. It is evidently the brain fever of the\r\ngenerations preceding the last, an important element of which was made\r\nup of the infectious meningitises. Alexander suggests its treatment by\r\nopiates after preliminary venesection, rubbings, lukewarm baths, and\r\nstimulating drinks. Every disturbance of the patient must be avoided,\r\nand visitors must be forbidden. The patient's room should rather be\r\nlight than dark. His teaching crops up constantly in the centuries after\r\nhis time, until the end of the nineteenth century, and while we now\r\nunderstand the causes of the condition better, we can do little more for\r\nit than he did.\r\n\r\nAlexander divided mental diseases into two, the maniacal and\r\nmelancholic. Mania was, however, really a further development of\r\nmelancholia, and represented a high grade of insanity. Under melancholy\r\nhe groups not only what we denominate by that term, but also all\r\ndepressed conditions, and the paranoias, as also many cases of\r\nimbecility. The cause of mental diseases was to be found in the blood.\r\nHe counselled the use of venesection, of laxatives and purgatives, of\r\nbaths and stimulant remedies. He insisted very much, however, on mental\r\ninfluence in the disease, on change of place and air, visits to the\r\ntheatre, and every possible form of mental diversion, as among the best\r\nremedial measures.\r\n\r\nAfter his book on diseases of the head, his most important section is on\r\ndiseases of the respiratory system. In this he treats first of angina,\r\nand recommends as gargles at the beginning light astringents; later\r\nstronger astringents, as alum and soda dissolved in warm water, should\r\nbe employed. Warm compresses, venesection from the sublingual veins, and\r\nfrom the jugular, and purgatives in severe cases, are the further\r\nremedies. He treats of cough as a symptom due to hot or cold, dry or wet\r\ndyscrasias. Opium preparations carefully used are the best remedies.\r\nThe breathing in of steam impregnated with various ethereal resins, was\r\nalso recommended.\r\n\r\nHe gives a rather interestingly modern treatment of consumption. He\r\nrecommends an abundance of milk with a strong nutritious diet, as\r\ndigestible as possible. A good auxiliary to this treatment was change of\r\nair, a sea voyage, and a stay at a watering-place. Asses' and mares'\r\nmilk are much better for these patients than cows' and goats' milk.\r\nThere is not enough difference in the composition of these various milks\r\nto make their special consumption of import, but it is probable that the\r\nsuggestive influence of the taking of an unusual milk had a very\r\nfavorable effect upon patients, and this effect was renewed frequently,\r\nso that much good was ultimately accomplished. For hemoptysis,\r\nespecially when it was acute and due as Alexander thought to the rupture\r\nof a blood vessel in the lungs, he recommended the opening of a vein at\r\nthe elbow or the ankle--in order to divert the blood from the place of\r\nrupture to the healthy parts of the circulation. He insisted that the\r\npatients must rest, that they should take acid and astringent drinks,\r\nthat cold compresses should be placed upon the chest (our ice bags), and\r\nthat they should take only a liquid diet at most lukewarm, or, better,\r\nif agreeable to them, cold. When the bleeding stopped, a milk cure was\r\nvery useful for the restoration of these patients to strength.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, then, to find that Alexander suggests a thoroughly\r\nrational treatment for pleurisy. He recognizes this as an inflammation\r\nof the membrane covering the ribs, and its symptoms are severe pain,\r\ndisturbance of breathing, and coughing. In certain cases there is severe\r\nfever, and Alexander knows of purulent pleurisy, and the fact that when\r\npus is present the side on which it is is warmer than the other.\r\nPleurisy can be, he says, rather easily confounded with certain liver\r\naffections, but there is a peculiar hardness of the pulse characteristic\r\nof pleurisy, and there is no expectoration in liver cases, though it\r\nalso may be absent in many cases of pleurisy. Sufferers from liver\r\ndisease usually have a paler color than pleuritics. His treatment\r\nconsists in venesection, purgatives, and, when pus is formed, local\r\nincision. He recommends the laying on of sponges dipped in warm water,\r\nand the internal use of honey lemonade. Opium should not be used unless\r\nthe patient suffers from sleeplessness.\r\n\r\nSome of the general principles of therapeutics that Alexander lays down\r\nare very interesting, even from our modern standpoint. Trust should not\r\nbe placed in any single method of treatment. Every available means of\r\nbringing relief to the patient should be tried. \"The duty of the\r\nphysician is to cool what is hot, to warm what is cold, to dry what is\r\nmoist, and to moisten what is dry. He should look upon the patient as a\r\nbesieged city, and try to rescue him with every means that art and\r\nscience places at his command. The physician should be an inventor, and\r\nthink out new ways and means by which the cure of the patient's\r\naffection and the relief of his symptoms may be brought about.\" The most\r\nimportant factor in his therapeutics is diet. Watering-places and\r\nvarious forms of mineral waters, as well as warm baths and sea baths,\r\nare constantly recommended by him. He took strong ground against the use\r\nof many drugs, and the rage for operating. The prophylaxis of disease is\r\nin Alexander's opinion the important part of the physician's duty. His\r\ntreatment of fever shows the application of his principle: cold baths,\r\ncold compresses, and a cooling diet, were his favorite remedies. He\r\nencouraged diaphoresis nearly always, and gave wine and stimulating\r\ndrugs only when the patient was very weak. He differentiates two kinds\r\nof quartan fever. One of these he attributes to an affection of the\r\nspleen, because he had noticed that the spleen was enlarged during it,\r\nand that, after purgation, the enlarged spleen decreased in size.\r\n\r\nAlexander was a strong opponent of drastic remedies of all kinds. He did\r\nnot believe in strong purgatives, nor in profuse and sudden\r\nblood-lettings. He opposed arteriotomy for this reason, and refused to\r\nemploy extensive cauterization. His diagnosis is thorough and careful.\r\nHe insisted particularly on inspection and palpation of the whole body;\r\non careful examination of the urine, of the feces, and the sputum; on\r\nstudy of the pulse and the breathing. He thought that a great deal might\r\nbe learned from the patient's history. The general constitution is also\r\nof importance. His therapeutics is, above all, individual. Remedies must\r\nbe administered with careful reference to the constitution, the age, the\r\nsex, and the condition of the patient's strength. Special attention must\r\nalways be paid to nature's efforts to cure, and these must be\r\nencouraged as far as possible. Alexander had no sympathy at all with\r\nthe idea that remedies must work against nature. His position in this\r\nmatter places him among the dozen men whose name and writings have given\r\nthem an enduring place in the favor of the profession at all times, when\r\nwe were not being carried away by some therapeutic fad or imagining that\r\nsome new theory solved the whole problem of the causation and cure of\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nGurlt, in his \"History of Surgery,\" has abstracted from Alexander\r\nparticularly certain phases of what the Germans call external pathology\r\nand therapeutics. For instance, Alexander's treatment of troubles\r\nconnected with the ear is very interesting. Gurlt declares that this\r\nchapter alone provides striking evidence for Alexander's practical\r\nexperience and power of observation, as well as for his knowledge of the\r\nliterature of medicine. He considers that only a short abstract is\r\nneeded to show that.\r\n\r\nFor water that has found its way into the external ear, Alexander\r\nsuggests a mode of treatment that is still popularly used. The patient\r\nshould stand upon the leg corresponding to the side on which there is\r\nwater in his ear, and then, with head leaning to that side, should hop\r\nor kick out with the other leg. The water may be drawn out by means of\r\nsuction through a reed. In order to get foreign bodies out of the\r\nexternal auditory canal, an ear spoon or other small instrument should\r\nbe wrapped in wool and dipped in turpentine, or some other sticky\r\nmaterial. Occasionally he has seen sneezing, especially if the mouth and\r\nnose are covered with a cloth, and the head leant toward the affected\r\nside, bring about a dislodgment of the foreign body. If these means do\r\nnot succeed, gentle injections of warm oil or washing out of the canal\r\nwith honey water should be tried. Foreign bodies may also be removed by\r\nmeans of suction. Insects or worms that find their way into the ear may\r\nbe killed by injections of acid and oil, or other substances.\r\n\r\nGurlt also calls attention to Alexander's careful differentiation of\r\ncertain very dangerous forms of inflammation of the throat from others\r\nwhich are rather readily treated. He says, \"Inflammation of the throat\r\nmay, under certain circumstances, belong to the severest diseases. The\r\npatients succumb to it as a consequence of suffocation, just as if they\r\nwere choked or hanged. For this reason, perhaps, the affection bears the\r\nname synanche, which means constriction.\" He then points out various\r\nother forms of inflammation of the throat, acute and chronic, suggesting\r\nvarious names and the differential diagnostic signs.\r\n\r\nOne of the most surprising chapters of Alexander's knowledge of\r\npathology and therapeutics is to be found in his treatment of the\r\nsubject of intestinal worms, which is contained in a letter sent by him\r\nto his friend, Theodore, whose child was suffering from them. He\r\ndescribes the _oxyuris vermicularis_ with knowledge manifestly derived\r\nfrom personal observation. He dwells on the itching in the region of the\r\nanus, caused by the _oxyuris_, and the fact that they probably find\r\ntheir way into the upper part of the digestive tract because of the\r\nsoiling of the hands. He knew that the tapeworms often reached great\r\nlength,--he has seen one over sixteen feet long,--and also that they had\r\na life cycle, so that they existed in two different forms. He describes\r\nthe roundworms as existing in the intestines, but occasionally wandering\r\ninto the stomach to be vomited. His vermifuges were the flowers and the\r\nseeds of the pomegranate, the seeds of the heliotrope, castor-oil, and\r\ncertain herbs that are still used, by country people, at least, as worm\r\nmedicines. For roundworms he recommended especially a decoction of\r\n_artemisia maritima_, coriander seeds, and decoctions of thyme. Our\r\nreturn to thymol for intestinal parasites is interesting. For the\r\n_oxyuris_ he prescribed clysters of ethereal oils. We have not advanced\r\nmuch in our treatment of intestinal worms in the fifteen hundred years\r\nsince Alexander's time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAUL OF AEGINA\r\n\r\nAnother extremely important writer in these early medieval times, whose\r\nopportunities for study in medicine and for the practice of it, were\r\nafforded him by Christian schools and Christian hospitals, was Paul of\r\nAEgina. He was born on the island of AEgina, hence the name AEginetus, by\r\nwhich he is commonly known. There used to be considerable doubt as to\r\njust when Paul lived, and dates for his career were placed as widely\r\napart as the fifth and the seventh centuries. We know that he was\r\neducated at the University of Alexandria. As that institution was broken\r\nup at the time of the capture of the city by the Arabs, he cannot have\r\nbeen there later than during the first half of the seventh century. An\r\nArabian writer, Abul Farag, in \"The Story of the Reign of the Emperor\r\nHeraclius,\" who died 641, says that \"among the celebrated physicians who\r\nflourished at this time was Paulus AEginetus.\" In his works Paul quotes\r\nfrom Alexander of Tralles, so that there seems to be no doubt now that\r\nhis life must be placed in the seventh century.\r\n\r\nThe most important portion of Paul's work for the modern time is\r\ncontained in his sixth book on surgery. In this his personal\r\nobservations are especially accumulated. Gurlt has reviewed it at\r\nconsiderable length, devoting altogether nearly thirty pages to it, and\r\nit well deserves this lengthy abstract. Paul quotes a great many of the\r\nwriters on surgery before his time, and then adds the results of his own\r\nobservation and experience. In it one finds careful detailed\r\ndescriptions of many operations that are usually supposed to be modern.\r\nVery probably the description quoted by Gurlt of the method of treating\r\nfishbones that have become caught in the throat will give the best idea\r\nof how thoroughly practical Paul is in his directions. He says: \"It will\r\noften happen in eating that fishbones or other objects may be swallowed\r\nand get caught in some part of the throat. If they can be seen they\r\nshould be removed with the forceps designed for that purpose. Where they\r\nare deeper, some recommend that the patient should swallow large\r\nmouthfuls of bread or other such food. Others recommend that a clean\r\nsoft sponge of small circumference to which a string is attached be\r\nswallowed, and then drawn out by means of the string. This should be\r\nrepeated until the bone or other object gets caught in the sponge and is\r\ndrawn out. If the patient is seen immediately after eating, and the\r\nswallowed object is not visible, vomiting should be brought on by means\r\nof a finger in the throat or irritation with the feather, and then not\r\ninfrequently the swallowed object will be brought up with the vomit.\"\r\n\r\nIn the chapter immediately following this, XXXIII, there is a\r\ndescription of the method of opening the larynx or the trachea, with the\r\nindications for this operation. The surgeon will know that he has opened\r\nthe trachea when the air streams out of the wound with some force, and\r\nthe voice is lost. As soon as the danger of suffocation is over, the\r\nedges of the wound should be freshened and the skin surfaces brought\r\ntogether with sutures. Only the skin without the cartilage should be\r\nsutured, and general treatment for encouraging union should be employed.\r\nIf the wound fails to heal immediately, a treatment calculated to\r\nencourage granulations should be undertaken. This same method of\r\ntreatment will be of service whenever we happen to have a patient who,\r\nin order to commit suicide, has cut his throat. Paul's exact term is,\r\nperhaps, best translated by the expression, slashed his larynx.\r\n\r\nOne of the features of Paul's \"Treatise on Surgery\" is his description\r\nof a radical operation for hernia. He describes scrotal hernia under the\r\nname enterocele, and says that it is due either to a tearing or a\r\nstretching of the peritoneum. It may be the consequence either of injury\r\nor of violent efforts made during crying. When the scrotum contains\r\nonly omentum, he calls the condition epiplocele; when it also contains\r\nintestine, an epiplo-enterocele. Hernia that does not descend into the\r\nscrotum he calls bubonocele. For operation the patient should be placed\r\non the back, and, the skin of the inguinal region being stretched by an\r\nassistant, an oblique incision in the direction in which the blood\r\nvessels run should be made. The incision should then be stretched by\r\nmeans of retractors, until the contents of the sac can be lifted out.\r\nAll adhesions should be broken up and the fat be removed, and the hernia\r\nreplaced within the abdomen. Care should be taken that no loop of\r\nintestine is allowed to remain. Then a large needle with double thread\r\nmade of ten strands should be run through the middle of the incision in\r\nthe end of the peritoneum, and tied firmly in cross sutures. The outer\r\nstructures should be brought together with a second ligature, and the\r\nlower end of the incision should have a wick placed in it for drainage,\r\nand the site of operation should be covered with an oil bandage.\r\n\r\nThe Arab writer, Abul Farag, to whose references we owe the definite\r\nplacing of the time when Paul lived, said that \"he had special\r\nexperience in women's diseases, and had devoted himself to them with\r\ngreat industry and success. The midwives of the time were accustomed to\r\ngo to him and ask his counsel with regard to accidents that happen\r\nduring and after parturition. He willingly imparted his information, and\r\ntold them what they should do. For this reason he came to be known as\r\nthe Obstetrician.\" Perhaps the term should be translated the\r\nman-midwife, for it was rather unusual for men to have much knowledge of\r\nthis subject. His knowledge of the phenomena of menstruation was as wide\r\nand definite. He knew a great deal of how to treat its disturbances. He\r\nseems to have been the first one to suggest that in metrorrhagia, with\r\nsevere hemorrhage from the uterus, the bleeding might be stopped by\r\nputting ligatures around the limbs. This same method has been suggested\r\nfor severe hemorrhage from the lungs as well as from the uterus in our\r\nown time. In hysteria he also suggested ligature of the limbs, and it is\r\neasy to understand that this might be a very strongly suggestive\r\ntreatment for the severer forms of hysteria. It is possible, too, that\r\nthe modification of the circulation to the nervous system induced by the\r\nshutting off of the circulation in large areas of the body might very\r\nwell have a favorable physical effect in this affection. Paul's\r\ndescription of the use of the speculum is as complete as that in any\r\nmodern text-book of gynaecology.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER CHRISTIAN PHYSICIANS\r\n\r\nAnother distinguished Christian medical scientist was Theophilus\r\nProtosbatharius, who belonged to the court of the Greek Emperor\r\nHeraclius, in the seventh century. He seems to have had a life very full\r\nof interest and surprisingly varied duties. He was a bishop, and, at the\r\nsame time, commander of the imperial bodyguard, and the author of a\r\nlittle work on the fabric of the human body. The most surprising chapter\r\nin the history of the book is that for some two centuries, in quite\r\nmodern times, it was used as a text-book of anatomy at the University of\r\nParis. It was printed in a number of editions early in the history of\r\nprinting, at least one very probably before 1500, and several later.\r\n\r\nThere are very interesting phases of medicine delightfully surprising in\r\ntheir modernity to be found here and there in many of these early\r\nChristian writers on medicine. For instance, in a compend of medicine\r\nwritten by one Leo, who, under the Emperor Theophilus, seems to have\r\nbeen a prominent physician of Byzantium (the compend was written for a\r\nyoung physician just beginning practice), we find the following\r\nclassification of hydrops or abdominal dilatation: \"There are three\r\nkinds; the first is ascites, due to the presence of watery fluid, for\r\nwhich we do paracentesis; second, tympany, when the abdomen is swollen\r\nfrom the presence of air or gas. This may be differentiated by\r\npercussion of the belly. When air is present the sound given forth is\r\nlike that of a drum, while in the first form ascites the sound is like\r\nthat from a sack [the word used is the same as for a wine sack]; the\r\nthird form is called anasarca, when the whole body swells.\"\r\n\r\nIt has often been the subject of misunderstanding as to why medicine\r\nshould have developed among the Latin Christian nations so much more\r\nslowly than among the Arabs during the early Middle Ages. Anyone who\r\nknows the conditions in which Christianity came into existence in Italy\r\nwill not be surprised at that. The Arabs in the East were in contact\r\nwith Greek thought, and that is eminently prolific and inspiring. At the\r\nmost, the Christians in Italy got their inspiration at second hand\r\nthrough the Romans. The Romans themselves, in spite of intimate contact\r\nwith Greek physicians, never made any important contributions to medical\r\nscience, nor to science of any kind. Their successors, the Christians of\r\nRome and Italy, then could scarcely be expected to do better, hampered\r\nespecially, as they were, by the trying social conditions created by the\r\ninvasion of the barbarians from the North. Whenever the Christians were\r\nin contact with Greek thought and Greek medicine, above all, as at\r\nAlexandria, or in certain of the cities of the near East, we have\r\ndistinguished contributions from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nARABIAN CHRISTIAN PHYSICIANS\r\n\r\nThat this is not a partial view suggested by the desire to make out a\r\nbetter case for Christianity in its relation to science will be very\r\nwell understood, besides, from the fact that a number of the original\r\nphysicians of Arab stock who attracted attention during the first period\r\nof Arabian medicine, that is, during the eighth and ninth centuries,\r\nwere Christians. There are a series of physicians belonging to the\r\nChristian family Bachtischua, a name which is derived from Bocht Jesu,\r\nthat is, servant of Jesus, who, from the middle of the eighth to the\r\nmiddle of the eleventh century, acquired great fame. The first of them,\r\nGeorge (Dschordschis), after acquiring fame elsewhere, was called to\r\nBagdad by the Caliph El-Mansur, where, because of his medical skill, he\r\nreached the highest honors. His son became the body-physician of Harun\r\nal-Raschid. In the third generation Gabriel (Dschibril) acquired fame\r\nand did much, as had his father and grandfather, for the medicine of the\r\ntime, by translations of the Greek physicians into Arabian.\r\n\r\nThese men may well be said to have introduced Greek medicine to the\r\nMohammedans. It was their teaching that aroused Moslem scholars from the\r\napathy that had characterized the attitude of the Arabian people toward\r\nscience at the beginning of Mohammedanism. As time went on, other great\r\nChristian medical teachers distinguished themselves among the Arabs. Of\r\nthese the most prominent was Messui the elder, who is also known as\r\nJanus Damascenus. Both he and his father practised medicine with great\r\nsuccess in Bagdad, and his son became the body-physician to Harun\r\nal-Raschid either after or in conjunction with Gabriel Bachtischua. Like\r\nhis colleague or predecessor in official position, he, too, made\r\ntranslations from the Greek into Arabic. Another distinguished Arabian\r\nChristian physician was Serapion the elder. He was born in Damascus, and\r\nflourished about the middle of the ninth century. He wrote a book on\r\nmedicine called the \"Aggregator,\" or \"Breviarium,\" or \"Practica\r\nMedicinae,\" which appeared in many printed editions within the century\r\nafter the invention of printing. During the ninth century, also, we have\r\nan account of Honein Ben Ischak, who is known in the West as\r\nJohannitius. After travelling much, especially in Greece and Persia, he\r\nsettled in Bagdad, and, under the patronage of the Caliph Mamum, made\r\nmany translations. He translated most of the old Greek medical writers,\r\nand also certain of the Greek philosophic and mathematical works. The\r\naccuracy of his translations became a proverb. His compendium of Galen\r\nwas the text-book of medicine in the West for many centuries. It was\r\nknown as the \"Isagoge in Artem Parvam Galeni.\" His son, Ishac Ben\r\nHonein, and his nephew, Hobeisch, were also famous as medical\r\npractitioners and translators.\r\n\r\nStill another of these Arabian Christians, who acquired a reputation as\r\nwriters in medicine, was Alkindus. He wrote with regard to nearly\r\neverything, however, and so came to be called the philosopher. He is\r\nsaid altogether to have written and translated about two hundred works,\r\nof which twenty-two treat of medicine. He was a contemporary of Honein\r\nBen Ischak in the ninth century. Another of the great ninth-century\r\nChristian physicians and translators from the Greek was Kostaben Luka.\r\nHe was of Greek origin, but lived in Armenia and made translations from\r\nGreek into Arabic. Nearly all of these men took not alone medical\r\nscience, but the whole round of physical science, for their special\r\nsubject. A typical example in the ninth century was Abuhassan Ben Korra,\r\nmany of whose family during succeeding generations attracted attention\r\nas scholars. He became the astronomer and physician of the Caliph\r\nMotadhid. His translations in medical literature were mainly excerpts\r\nfrom Hippocrates and Galen meant for popular use. These Christian\r\ntranslators, thoroughly scientific as far as their times permitted them\r\nto be, were wonderfully industrious in their work as translators, great\r\nteachers in every sense of the word, and they are the men who formed\r\nthe traditions on which the greater Arabian physicians from Rhazes\r\nonward were educated.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to think that these men, occupied so much with\r\ntranslations, and intent on the re-introduction of Greek medicine, might\r\nhave depended very little on their own observations, and been very\r\nimpractical. All that is needed to counteract any such false impression,\r\nhowever, is to know something definite about their books. Gurlt, in his\r\n\"History of Surgery,\" has some quotations from Serapion the elder, who\r\nis often quoted by Rhazes. In the treatment of hemorrhoids Serapion\r\nadvises ligature and insists that they must be tied with a silk thread\r\nor with some other strong thread, and then relief will come. He says\r\nsome people burn them _medicinis acutis_ (touching with acids, as some\r\ndo even yet), and some incise them with a knife. He prefers the\r\nligature, however. He calmly discusses the removal of stones from the\r\nkidney by incision of the pelvis of the kidney through an opening in the\r\nloin. He considers the operation very dangerous, however, but seems to\r\nthink the removal of a stone from the bladder a rather simple procedure.\r\nHis description of the technique of the use of a catheter and of a\r\nstylet with it, and apparently also of a guide for it in difficult\r\ncases, is extremely interesting. He suggests the opening of the bladder\r\nin the median line, midway between the scrotum and the anus, and the\r\nplacing of a canula therein, so as to permit drainage until healing\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\nEven this brief review of the careers and the writings of the\r\nphysicians of early Christian times shows how well the tradition of old\r\nGreek medicine was being carried on. There was much to hamper the\r\ncultivation of science in the disturbances of the time, the gradual\r\nbreaking up of the Roman Empire, and the replacement of the peoples of\r\nsouthern Europe by the northern nations, who had come in, yet in spite\r\nof all this, medical tradition was well preserved. The most prominent of\r\nthe conservators were themselves men whose opinions on problems of\r\npractical medicine were often of value, and whose powers of observation\r\nfrequently cannot but be admired. There is absolutely no trace of\r\nanything like opposition to the development of medical science or\r\nmedical practice, but, on the contrary, everywhere among political and\r\necclesiastical authorities, we find encouragement and patronage. The\r\nvery fact that, in the storm and stress of the succeeding centuries,\r\nmanuscript copies of the writings of the physicians of this time were\r\npreserved for us in spite of the many vicissitudes to which they were\r\nsubjected from fire, and war, and accidents of various kinds for\r\nhundreds of years, until the coming of printing, shows in what\r\nestimation they were held. During this time they owed their preservation\r\nto churchmen, for the libraries and the copying-rooms were all under\r\necclesiastical control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nGREAT JEWISH PHYSICIANS[3]\r\n\r\n\r\nAny account of Old-Time Makers of Medicine without a chapter on the\r\nJewish Physicians would indeed be incomplete. They are among the most\r\nimportant factors in medieval medicine, representing one of the most\r\nsignificant elements of medical progress. In spite of the disadvantages\r\nunder which their race labored because of the popular feeling against\r\nthem on the part of the Christians in the earlier centuries and of the\r\nMohammedans later, men of genius from the race succeeded in making their\r\ninfluence felt not only on their own times, but accomplished so much in\r\nmaking and writing medicine as to influence many subsequent generations.\r\nLiving the segregated life that as a rule they had to, from the earliest\r\ntimes (the Ghettos have only disappeared in the nineteenth century), it\r\nwould seem almost impossible for them to have done great intellectual\r\nwork. It is one of the very common illusions, however, that great\r\nintellectual work is accomplished mainly in the midst of comfortable\r\ncircumstances and as the result of encouraging conditions. Most of our\r\ngreat makers of medicine at all times, and never more so than during the\r\npast century, have been the sons of the poor, who have had to earn their\r\nown living, as a rule, before they reached manhood, and who have always\r\nhad the spur of that necessity which has been so well called the mother\r\nof invention. Their hard living conditions probably rather favored than\r\nhampered their intellectual accomplishments.\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that the difficult personal circumstances in which\r\nthe Jews were placed had a good deal to do at all times with stimulating\r\ntheir ambitions and making them accomplish all that was in them. Certain\r\nit is that at all times we find a wonderful power in the people to rise\r\nabove their conditions. With them, however, as with other peoples,\r\nluxury, riches, comfort, bring a surfeit to initiative and the race does\r\nnot accomplish so much. At various times in the early Middle Ages,\r\nparticularly, we find Jewish physicians doing great work and obtaining\r\nprecious acknowledgment for it in spite of the most discouraging\r\nconditions. Later it is not unusual to find that there has been a\r\ndegeneration into mere money-making as the result of opportunity and\r\nconsequent ease and luxury. At a number of times, however, both in\r\nChristian and in Mohammedan countries, great Jewish physicians arose\r\nwhose names have come to us and with whom every student of medicine who\r\nwants to know something about the details of the course of medical\r\nhistory must be familiar. There are men among them who must be\r\nconsidered among the great lights of medicine, significant makers always\r\nof the art and also in nearly all cases of the science of medicine.\r\n\r\nA little consideration of the history of the Jewish people and their\r\ngreat documents eliminates any surprise there may be with regard to\r\ntheir interest in medicine and successful pursuit of it during the\r\nMiddle Ages. The two great collections of Hebrew documents, the Old\r\nTestament and the Talmud, contain an immense amount of material with\r\nreference to medical problems of many kinds. Both of these works are\r\nespecially interesting because of what they have to say of preventive\r\nmedicine and with regard to the recognition of disease. Our prophylaxis\r\nand diagnosis are important scientific departments of medicine dependent\r\non observation rather than on theory. While therapeutics has wandered\r\ninto all sorts of absurdities, the advances made in prophylaxis and in\r\ndiagnosis have always remained valuable, and though at times they have\r\nbeen forgotten, re-discovery only emphasizes the value of preceding\r\nwork. It is because of what they contain with regard to these two\r\nimportant medical subjects that the Old Testament and the Talmud are\r\nlandmarks in the history of medicine as well as of religion.\r\n\r\nBaas, in his \"Outlines of the History of Medicine,\" says: \"It\r\ncorresponds to the reality in both the actual and chronological point of\r\nview to consider the books of Moses as the foundation of sanitary\r\nscience. The more we have learned about sanitation in the prophylaxis of\r\ndisease and in the prevention of contagion in the modern time, the more\r\nhave we come to appreciate highly the teachings of these old times on\r\nsuch subjects. Moses made a masterly exposition of the knowledge\r\nnecessary to prevent contagious disease when he laid down the rules with\r\nregard to leprosy, first as to careful differentiation, then as to\r\nisolation, and finally as to disinfection after it had come to be sure\r\nthat cure had taken place. The great lawgiver could insist emphatically\r\nthat the keeping of the laws of God not only was good for a man's soul\r\nbut also for his body.\"\r\n\r\nWith this tradition familiarly known and deeply studied by the mass of\r\nthe Hebrew people, it is no surprise to find that when the next great\r\nHebrew development of religious writing came in the Talmud during the\r\nearlier Middle Ages, that also contains much with regard to medicine,\r\nnot a little of which is so close to absolute truth as never to be out\r\nof date. Friedenwald, in his \"Jewish Physicians and the Contributions of\r\nthe Jews to the Science of Medicine,\" a lecture delivered before the\r\nGratz College of Philadelphia fifteen years ago, summed up from Baas'\r\n\"History of Medicine\" the instructions in the Talmud with regard to\r\nhealth and disease. The summary represents so much more of genuine\r\nknowledge of medicine and surgery than might be expected at the early\r\nperiod at which it was written, during the first and second century of\r\nour era, that it seems well to quote it at some length.\r\n\r\n     \"Fever was regarded as nature's effort to expel morbific\r\n     matter and restore health; which is a much safer\r\n     interpretation of fever, from a practical point of view, than\r\n     most of the theories bearing on this point that have been\r\n     taught up to a very recent period. They attributed the halting\r\n     in the hind legs of a lamb to a callosity formed around the\r\n     spinal cord. This was a great advance in the knowledge of the\r\n     physiology of the nervous system. An emetic was recommended as\r\n     the best remedy for nausea. In many cases no better remedy is\r\n     known to-day. They taught that a sudden change in diet was\r\n     injurious, even if the quality brought by the change was\r\n     better. That milk fresh from the udder was the best. The\r\n     Talmud describes jaundice and correctly ascribes it to the\r\n     retention of bile, and speaks of dropsy as due to the\r\n     retention of urine. It teaches that atrophy or rupture of the\r\n     kidneys is fatal. Induration of the lungs (tuberculosis) was\r\n     regarded as incurable. Suppuration of the spinal cord had an\r\n     early, grave meaning. Rabies was known. The following is a\r\n     description given of the dog's condition: 'His mouth is open,\r\n     the saliva issues from his mouth; his ears drop; his tail\r\n     hangs between his legs; he runs sideways, and the dogs bark at\r\n     him; others say that he barks himself, and that his voice is\r\n     very weak. No man has appeared who could say that he has seen\r\n     a man live who was bitten by a mad dog.' The description is\r\n     good, and this prognosis as to hydrophobia in man has remained\r\n     unaltered till in our day when Pasteur published his startling\r\n     revelation. The anatomical knowledge of the Talmudists was\r\n     derived chiefly from dissection of the animals. As a very\r\n     remarkable piece of practical anatomy for its very early date\r\n     is the procuring of the skeleton from the body of a\r\n     prostitute by the process of boiling, by Rabbi Ishmael, a\r\n     physician, at the close of the first century. He gives the\r\n     number of bones as 252 instead of 232. The Talmudists knew the\r\n     origin of the spinal cord at the foramen magnum and its form\r\n     of termination; they described the oesophagus as being\r\n     composed of two coats; they speak of the pleura as the double\r\n     covering of the lungs; and mention the special coat of fat\r\n     about the kidneys. They had made progress in obstetrics;\r\n     described monstrosities and congenital deformities; practised\r\n     version, evisceration, and Caesarian section upon the dead and\r\n     upon the living mother. A.H. Israels has clearly shown in his\r\n     'Dissertatio Historico-Medica Inauguralis' that Caesarian\r\n     section, according to the Talmud, was performed among the Jews\r\n     with safety to mother and child. The surgery of the Talmud\r\n     includes a knowledge of dislocation of the thigh bone,\r\n     contusions of the skull, perforation of the lungs,\r\n     oesophagus, stomach, small intestines, and gall bladder;\r\n     wounds of the spinal cord, windpipe, of fractures of the ribs,\r\n     etc. They described imperforate anus and how it was to be\r\n     relieved by operation. Chanina Ben Chania inserted natural and\r\n     wooden teeth as early as the second century, C.E.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a famous summing up of the possibilities of life and happiness\r\nin the Talmud that has been often quoted--its possible wanting in\r\ngallantry being set down to the times in which it was written. \"Life is\r\ncompatible with any disease, provided the bowels remain open; any kind\r\nof pain, provided the heart remain unaffected; any kind of uneasiness,\r\nprovided the head is not attacked; all manner of evils, except it be a\r\nbad woman.\"\r\n\r\nThere are many other interesting suggestions in the Talmud. Sometimes\r\nthey have come to be generally accepted in the modern time, sometimes\r\nthey are only curious notions that have not, however, lost all their\r\ninterest. The crucial incision for carbuncle is a typical example of the\r\nfirst class and the suggestion of the removal of superfluous fat from\r\nwithin the abdomen or in the abdominal wall itself by operation is\r\nanother. That they had some idea of the danger of sepsis may be gathered\r\nfrom the fact that they suspected iron surgical instruments and advised\r\nthe use of others of less enduring character.\r\n\r\nThe Talmud itself was indeed a sort of encyclopedia in which was\r\ngathered knowledge of all kinds from many sources. It was not\r\nparticularly a book of medicine, though it contains so many medical\r\nideas. In many parts of it the authors' regard for science is\r\nemphatically expressed. Landau, in his \"History of Jewish Physicians,\"\r\ncloses his account of the Talmud with this paragraph:\r\n\r\n     \"I conclude this brief review of Talmudic medicine with some\r\n     reference to how high the worth of science was valued in this\r\n     much misunderstood work. In one place we have the expression\r\n     'occupation with science means more than sacrifice.' In\r\n     another 'science is more than priesthood and kingly\r\n     dignity.'\"[4]\r\n\r\nAfter all this of national tradition in medicine before and after\r\nChrist, it is only what we might quite naturally expect to find, that\r\nthere is scarcely a century of the Middle Ages which does not contain at\r\nleast one great Jewish physician and sometimes there are more. Many of\r\nthese men made distinct contributions to medical science and their names\r\nhave been held in high estimation ever since. Perhaps I should say that\r\nthey were held in high estimation until that neglect of historical\r\nstudies which characterized the eighteenth century developed, and that\r\nthere has been a reawakening of interest in our time. We forget this\r\ncurious decadence of the later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\r\nwhich did so much to obscure history and especially the history of the\r\nsciences. Fortunately the scholars of the sixteenth and early\r\nseventeenth centuries accomplished successfully the task of printing\r\nmany of the books of these old-time physicians and secured their\r\npublication in magnificent editions. These were bought eagerly by\r\nscholars and libraries all over Europe in spite of the high price they\r\ncommanded in that era of slow, laborious printing. The Renaissance\r\nexhibits some of its most admirable qualities in its reverence for these\r\nold workers in science and above all for the careful preparation by its\r\nscholars of the text of these first editions of old-time physicians. The\r\nworks have often been thus literally preserved for us, for some of them\r\nat least would have disappeared among the vicissitudes of the\r\nintervening time, most of which was anything but favorable to the\r\npreservation of old-time works, no matter what their content or value.\r\n\r\nDuring the second and third centuries of our era, while the Talmudic\r\nwritings were taking shape, three great Jewish physicians came into\r\nprominence. The first of them, Chanina, was a contemporary of Galen.\r\nAccording to tradition, as we have said, he inserted both natural and\r\nartificial teeth before the close of the second century. The two others\r\nwere Rab or Raw and Samuel. Rab has the distinction of having studied\r\nhis anatomy from the human body. According to tradition he did not\r\nhesitate to spend large sums of money in order to procure subjects for\r\ndissection. At this time it is very doubtful whether Galen, though only\r\nof the preceding generation, ever had the opportunity to study more than\r\nanimals or, at most, a few human bodies. Samuel, the third of the group,\r\nwas an intimate friend of Rab's, perhaps a disciple, and his fame\r\ndepends rather on his practice of medicine than of research in medical\r\nscience. He was noted for his practical development of two specialties\r\nthat cannot but seem to us rather distant from each other. His\r\nreputation as a skilful obstetrician was only surpassed by the\r\nestimation in which he was held as an oculist. He seems to have turned\r\nto astronomy as a hobby, and was highly honored for his knowledge of\r\nthis science. Probably there is nothing commoner in the story of great\r\nJewish physicians than their successful pursuit of some scientific\r\nsubject as a hobby and reaching distinction in it. Their surplus\r\nintellectual energy needed an outlet besides their vocation, and they\r\ngot a rest by turning to some other interest, often accomplishing\r\nexcellent results in it. Like most great students with a hobby, the\r\nmajority of them were long-lived. Their lives are a lesson to a\r\ngeneration that fears intellectual overwork.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourth century we have a number of very interesting\r\ntraditions with regard to a great Jewish physician, Abba Oumna, to whom\r\npatients flocked from all over the world. He seems particularly to have\r\nbeen anxious to make his services available to the scholars of his time.\r\nHe looked upon them as brothers in spirit, fellow-laborers whose\r\ninvestigations were as important as his own and whose labors for mankind\r\nhe hoped to extend by the helpfulness of his profession. In order that\r\nit might be easy for them to come to him without feeling abashed by\r\ntheir poverty, and yet so that they might pay him anything that they\r\nthought they were able to, he hung up a box in his anteroom in which\r\neach patient might deposit whatever he felt able to give. His kindliness\r\ntowards men became the foundation for many legends. Needless to say he\r\nwas often imposed upon, but that seems to have made no difference to\r\nhim, and he went on straightforwardly doing what he thought he ought to\r\ndo, regardless of the devious ways of men, even those whom he was\r\ngenerously assisting. While we do not know much of his scientific\r\nmedicine, we do know that he was a fine example of a practitioner of\r\nmedicine on the highest professional lines.\r\n\r\nWith the foundation of the school at Djondisabour in Arabistan or\r\nKhusistan by the Persian monarch Chosroes, some Jewish physicians come\r\ninto prominence as teachers, and this is one of the first important\r\noccasions in history when they teach side by side with Christian\r\ncolleagues. Djondisabour seems distant from us now, lying as it does in\r\nthe province just above the head of the Persian Gulf, and it is a little\r\nhard to understand its becoming a centre of culture and education, yet\r\naccording to well-grounded historical traditions students flocked here\r\nfrom all parts of the world, and its medical instruction particularly\r\nbecame famous. According to the documents and traditions that we\r\npossess, clinical teaching was the most significant feature of the\r\nschool work and made it famous. As a consequence graduates from here\r\nwere deemed fully qualified to become professors in other institutions\r\nand were eagerly sought by various medical schools in the East.\r\n\r\nWith the rise of the strong political power of the Mohammedans enough of\r\npeace came to the East at least to permit the cultivation of arts and\r\nsciences to some extent again, and then at once the eminence of Jewish\r\nphysicians, both as teachers and practitioners of medicine, once more\r\nbecomes manifest. The first of the race who comes into prominence is\r\nMaser Djawah Ebn Djeldjal, of Basra. To him we owe probably more than to\r\nanyone else the preservation of old scientific writings and the\r\ncultivation of arts and sciences by the Mohammedans. He prevailed on\r\nCaliph Moawia I, whose physician he had become, to cause many foreign\r\nworks, and especially those written in Greek, to be translated into\r\nArabic. He seems to have taken a large share of the labor of the\r\ntranslation on himself and prevailed upon his pupil, the son of Moawia,\r\nto translate some works on chemistry. The translation for which Maser\r\nDjawah is best known is that of the Pandects of Haroun, a physician of\r\nAlexandria. The translation of this work was made toward the end of the\r\nseventh century. Unfortunately the \"Pandects\" has not come down to us,\r\neither in original or translation, but we have fragments of the\r\ntranslation preserved by Rhazes, the distinguished Arabian medical\r\nwriter and physician of the ninth century, and there seems no doubt that\r\nit contained the first good description of smallpox, a chapter in\r\nmedicine that is often--though incorrectly--attributed to Rhazes\r\nhimself. Rhazes quoted Maser Djawah freely and evidently trusted his\r\ndeclarations implicitly.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding Caliphs of the first Arabian dynasty did not exhibit the\r\nsame interest in education, and above all in science, that characterized\r\nMoawia. Political ambition and the desire for military glory seem to\r\nhave filled up their thoughts and perhaps they had not the good fortune\r\nto fall under the influence of physicians so wise and learned as Maser\r\nDjawah. More probably, however, they themselves lacked interest. Toward\r\nthe end of the seventh century they were succeeded by the Abbassides.\r\nAlmansor, the second Caliph of this dynasty, was attacked by a dangerous\r\ndisease and sent for a physician of the Nestorian school. After his\r\nrestoration to health he became a liberal patron of science and\r\nespecially medical science. The new city of Bagdad, which had become the\r\ncapital of the realm of the Abbassides, was enriched by him with a large\r\nnumber of works on medicine, which he caused to be translated from the\r\nGreek. He did not confine himself to medicine, however, but also brought\r\nabout translations of works with regard to other sciences. One of these,\r\nastronomy, was a favorite. He made it a particular point to search out\r\nand encourage the translation of such books as had not previously been\r\ntranslated from Greek into Arabic. While he provided a translation of\r\nPtolemy he also had translations made of Aristotle and Galen.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, then, that the school of Bagdad became celebrated.\r\nJewish physicians seem to have been most prominent in its foundation,\r\nand the most distinguished product of it is Isaac Ben Emran, almost as\r\ncelebrated as a philosopher as he is as a physician. One of his\r\nexpressions with regard to the danger of a patient having two physicians\r\nwhose opinions disagree with regard to his illness has been deservedly\r\npreserved for us. Zeid, an Emir of one of the chief cities of the Arabs\r\nin Barbary, fell ill of a tertian fever and called Isaac and another\r\nphysician in consultation. Their opinions were so widely in disaccord\r\nthat Isaac refused to prescribe anything, and when the Emir, who had\r\ngreat confidence in him, demanded the reason, he replied, \"disagreement\r\nof two physicians is more deadly than a tertian fever.\" This Isaac, who\r\nis said to have died in 799, is the great Jewish physician, one of the\r\nmost important members of the profession in the eighth century. His\r\nprincipal work was with regard to poisons and the symptoms caused by\r\nthem. This is often quoted by medical writers in the after time.\r\n\r\nThe prominent Jewish physician of the ninth century was Joshua Ben Nun.\r\nHaroun al-Raschid, whose attempts to secure justice for his people are\r\nthe subject of so much legendary lore, and whose place in history may be\r\nbest recalled by the fact that he is a contemporary of Charlemagne, was\r\nparticularly interested in medicine. He founded the city of Tauris as a\r\nmemorial of the cure of his wife. He was a generous patron of the school\r\nof Djondisabour and established a medical school also at Bagdad. He\r\nprovided good salaries for the professors, insisted on careful\r\nexaminations, and raised the standard of medical education for a time to\r\na noteworthy degree. The greatest teacher of this school at Bagdad was\r\nJoshua Ben Nun, sometimes known as the Rabbi of Seleucia. His teaching\r\nattracted many students to Bagdad and his fame as one of the great\r\npractitioners of medicine of this time brought many patients. Among his\r\ndisciples was John Masuee, whose Arabian name is so different, Yahia Ben\r\nMasoviah, that in order to avoid confusion in reading it is important to\r\nknow both. Almost better known, perhaps, at this time was Abu Joseph\r\nJacob Ben Isaac Kendi. Fortunately for the after time, these men devoted\r\nthemselves not only to their own observations and writings but made a\r\nseries of valuable translations. Joshua Ben Nun seems to have been\r\nparticularly zealous in this matter, following the example of Maser\r\nDjawah of Basra.\r\n\r\nBagdad then became a centre for Arabian culture. Mahmoud, one of\r\nHaroun's successors, provided in Bagdad a refuge for the learned men of\r\nthe East who were disturbed by the wars and troubles of the time. He\r\nbecame a liberal patron of literature and education. When the Emperor\r\nMichael III of Constantinople was conquered in battle, one of the\r\nobligations imposed upon him was to send many camel loads of books to\r\nBagdad, and Aristotle and Plato were studied devotedly and translated\r\ninto Arabic. The era of culture affected not only the capital but all\r\nthe cities, and everywhere throughout the Arabian empire schools and\r\nacademies sprang up. We have records of them at Basra, Samarcand,\r\nIspahan. From here the thirst for education spread to the other cities\r\nruled by the Mohammedans, and each town became affected by it.\r\nAlexandria, the cities of the Barbary States, those of Sicily and\r\nProvence, where Moorish influences were prominent, and of distant Spain,\r\nCordova, Seville, Toledo, Granada, Saragossa, all took up the rivalry\r\nfor culture which made this a glorious period in the history of the\r\nintellectual life.\r\n\r\nAlready, in the chapter on \"Great Physicians in Early Christian Times,\"\r\nI have pointed out that many of the teachers of the Arabs were Christian\r\nphysicians. Here it is proper to emphasize the other important factor in\r\nArabian medicine, the Jewish physicians, who influenced the great\r\nArabian rulers, and were the teachers of the Arabs in medicine and\r\nscience generally. These Christian and Jewish physicians particularly\r\nencouraged the translation of the works of the great Greek physicians\r\nand thus kept the Greek medical tradition from dying out. It is not\r\nuntil the end of the ninth, or even the beginning of the tenth, century\r\nthat we begin to have important contributors to medicine from among the\r\nArabs themselves. Even at this time they have distinguished rivals among\r\nJewish physicians. Indeed these acquired such a reputation that they\r\nbecame the physicians to monarchs and even high ecclesiastics, and we\r\nfind them nearly everywhere throughout Europe. Their success was so\r\ngreat that it is not surprising that after a time the vogue of the\r\nJewish physicians should have led to jealousy of them and to the passage\r\nof laws and decrees limiting their sphere of activity.\r\n\r\nThe great Jewish physician of the ninth century was Isaac Ben Soliman,\r\nbetter known as Isaac el Israili, and who is sometimes spoken of as\r\nd'Israeli. He was a pupil of Isaac Ben Amram the younger, probably a\r\ngrandson of another Isaac Ben Amram, who, after having become famous in\r\nBagdad, went to Cairo and became the physician of the Emir Zijadeth III.\r\nThe younger Isaac established a school, and it was with him that Israeli\r\nobtained his introduction to medicine. He practised first as an oculist\r\nand then became body-physician to the Sultan of Morocco. Because of the\r\nsympathy of his character and his unselfishness he acquired great\r\npopularity. Hyrtl refers to him respectfully as \"that scholarly son of\r\nIsrael.\" Curiously enough, considering racial feeling in the matter, he\r\nnever married, and when asked why he had not, and whether he did not\r\nthink that he might regret it, he replied, \"I have written four books\r\nthrough which my memory will be better preserved than it would be by\r\ndescendants.\" The four books are his \"Treatise on Fevers,\" his \"Treatise\r\non Simple Medicines and Ailments,\" a treatise on the \"Elements,\" and a\r\ntreatise \"On the Urine.\" Besides these, we have from him shorter works,\r\n\"On the Pulse,\" \"On Melancholy,\" and \"On Dropsy.\" His hope with regard\r\nto his fame from these works was fulfilled, for they were printed as\r\nlate as 1515 at Leyden, and Sprengel declared them the best compendium\r\nof simple remedies and diet that we have from the Arabian times. One of\r\nhis translators into Latin has called him the monarch of physicians.\r\n\r\nSome of his maxims are extremely interesting in the light of modern\r\nnotions on the same subjects. He declared emphatically that \"the most\r\nimportant duty of the physician is to prevent illness.\" \"Most patients\r\nget better without much help from the physician by the power of nature.\"\r\nHe emphasized his distrust of using many medicines at the same time in\r\nthe hope that some of them would do good. He laid it down as a rule:\r\n\"Employ only one medicine at a time in all your cases and note its\r\neffects carefully.\" He was as wise with regard to medical ethics as\r\ntherapeutics. He advised a young physician, \"Never speak unfavorably of\r\nother physicians. Every one of us has his lucky and unlucky hours.\" It\r\nis pleasant to learn that the old gentleman lived to fill out a full\r\nhundred years of life, and that in his declining years he was\r\nsurrounded by the good will and the affection of many who had learned to\r\nknow his precious qualities of heart and mind. More than of any other\r\nclass of physicians do we find the large human sympathies of the Jewish\r\nphysicians of the Middle Ages praised by their contemporaries and\r\nsucceeding generations.\r\n\r\nDuring the next centuries a number of Jewish physicians became\r\nprominent, though none of them until Maimonides impressed themselves\r\ndeeply upon the medical life of their own and succeeding centuries. Very\r\nfrequently they were the physicians to royal personages. Zedkias, for\r\ninstance, was the physician to Louis the Pious and later to his son\r\nCharles the Bald. His reputation as a physician was great enough to give\r\nhim the popular estimation of a magician, but it did not save him from\r\nthe accusation of having poisoned Charles when that monarch died\r\nsuddenly. There seem to be no good grounds, however, for the accusation.\r\nThere were a number of schools of medicine, in Sicily and the southern\r\npart of Italy, in which Jewish, Arabian, and Christian physicians taught\r\nside by side. One of these teachers was Jude Sabatai Ben Abraham,\r\nusually known by the name of Donolo, who was famous both as a writer on\r\nmedicine and on astronomy. Donolo studied and probably taught at\r\nTarentum, and there were similar schools at Palermo, at Bari, and then\r\nlater on the mainland at Salerno. The foundation of Salerno, in which\r\nJewish physicians also took part, we shall discuss later in the special\r\nchapter devoted to that subject.\r\n\r\nOne of the great translators whose work meant very much for the medical\r\nscience of his own and succeeding generations was the distinguished\r\nJewish physician, Faradj Ben Salim, sometimes spoken of as Farachi\r\nFaragut or Ferrarius, who was born at Girgenti in Sicily. He made his\r\nmedical studies in Salerno and did his work under the patronage of\r\nCharles of Anjou towards the end of the thirteenth century. His greatest\r\nwork is the translation of the whole of the \"Continens\" of Rhazes. The\r\ntranslation is praised as probably the best of its time made in the\r\nMiddle Ages. Faradj came at the end of a great century, when the\r\nintellectual life of Europe had reached a high power of expression, and\r\nit is not surprising that he should have proved equal to his\r\nenvironment. This translation has also some additions made by Faradj\r\nhimself, notably a glossary of Arabian names.\r\n\r\nIn Spain also Jewish physicians rose to distinction. The most\r\ndistinguished in the tenth century was Chasdai Ben Schaprut. Like many\r\nother of the great physicians of this time, he had studied astronomy as\r\nwell as the medical sciences. He became the physician of the Caliph\r\nAbd-er-Rahman III of Cordova. He seems also to have exercised some of\r\nthe functions of Prime Minister to the Caliph, and took advantage of\r\ndiplomatic relations between his sovereign and the Byzantine Emperor to\r\nobtain some works of Dioscorides. These he translated into Arabian with\r\nthe help of a Greek monk, whom he seems also to have secured through the\r\ndiplomatic relations. Undoubtedly he did much to usher in that\r\nenthusiasm for education and study which characterized the next\r\ncenturies, the eleventh and twelfth, at Cordova in Spain, when such men\r\nas Avenzoar, Avicenna, and Averroes attracted the attention of the\r\neducational world of the time. Jewish writers have sometimes claimed one\r\nof the most distinguished of these, Avenzoar himself, as a Jew, but\r\nHyrtl and other good authorities consider him of Arabic extraction and\r\npoint to the fact that his ancestors bore the name of Mohammed. This is\r\nnot absolutely conclusive evidence, but because of it I have preferred\r\nto class Avenzoar among the Arabian physicians.\r\n\r\nThe one historical fact of importance for us is that everywhere in\r\nEurope at that time Jews were being accorded opportunities for the study\r\nand practice of medicine. There are local incidents of persecution, but\r\nwe are not so far away from the feelings that brought these about as to\r\nmisunderstand them or to think that they were anything more than local,\r\npopular manifestations. The more we know about the details of the\r\nmedical history of these times the deeper is the impression of academic\r\nfreedom and of opportunities for liberal education.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said about the intolerance of ecclesiastical authorities\r\ntoward the Jews, and of Church decrees that either absolutely forbade\r\ntheir practice of the medical profession and their devotion to\r\nscientific study, or at least made these pursuits much more difficult\r\nfor them than for others. Of course it has to be conceded, even by those\r\nwho most insistently urge the existence of formal legislation in the\r\nmatter, that in spite of these decrees and intolerance and opposition,\r\nJews continued to practise medicine and to be the chosen physicians of\r\nkings and even of high ecclesiastical dignitaries, as well indeed of\r\nthe Popes themselves. This, it is usually declared, must be attributed\r\nto the surpassing skill of the Jewish physicians, causing men to\r\novercome their prejudices and override even their own legal regulations.\r\nThere is no doubt at all about the skill of Jewish physicians at many\r\ntimes during the Middle Ages. There is no doubt also of the sentiment of\r\nopposition that often developed between the Christian peoples and the\r\nJews. Any excuse is good enough to justify men, to themselves at least,\r\nin putting obstacles in the paths of those who are more successful than\r\nthey are themselves. Religion often became a cloak for ill-will and\r\npersecution.\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs that has been presumed however, according to which\r\nlaws and decrees were being constantly issued forbidding the practice of\r\nmedicine to Jews by the ecclesiastical authorities, while at the same\r\ntime they themselves and those who were nearest to them were employing\r\nJewish physicians, is an absurdity that on the face of it calls for\r\ninvestigation of the conditions and from its very appearance would\r\nindicate that the ordinary historical assumption in the matter must be\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nI have been at some pains, then, to try to find out just what were the\r\nconditions in Europe with regard to the practice of medicine by the\r\nJews. There is no doubt that at Salerno, where the influence of the\r\nBenedictines was very strong and where the influence of the Popes and\r\nthe ecclesiastical authorities was always dominant, full liberty of\r\nstudying and teaching was from the earliest days allowed to the Jews.\r\nDown at Montpellier it seems clear that Jewish physicians had a large\r\npart in the foundation of the medical school, and continued for several\r\ncenturies to be most important factors in the maintenance of its\r\nreputation and the upbuilding of that fame which draw students from even\r\ndistant parts of Europe to this medical school of the south of France.\r\nDuring the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries Jewish\r\nphysicians were frequently in attendance on kings and the higher\r\nnobility, on bishops and archbishops, cardinals, and even Popes. Every\r\nnow and then the spirit of intolerance among the populace was aroused,\r\nand occasionally the death of some distinguished patient while in a\r\nJewish physician's hands was made the occasion for persecution. We must\r\nnot forget, after all, that even as late as Elizabeth's time, when\r\nShakespeare wrote \"The Merchant of Venice,\" he was taking advantage of\r\nthe popular sentiment aroused by the execution of Lopez, the Queen's\r\nphysician, for a real or supposed participation in a plot against her\r\nMajesty's life. Shylock was presented the next season for the sake of\r\nadventitious popularity that would thus accrue to the piece. The\r\ncharacter was played so as to depict all the worst traits of the Jew,\r\nand was scornfully laughed at at every representation. This is an index\r\nof the popular feeling of the time. Bitter intolerance of the Jew has\r\ncontinued. Down almost to our own time the Ghettos have existed in\r\nEurope, and popular tumults against them continue to occur. Quite\r\nneedless to say, these do not depend on Christianity, but on defective\r\nhuman nature.\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Ages the best possible criterion of the attitude of\r\nthe Church authorities towards the Jews is to be found in the\r\nlegislation of Pope Innocent III. He is the greatest of the Popes of the\r\nMiddle Ages; he shaped the policy of the Church more than any other; his\r\ninfluence was felt for many generations after his own time. His famous\r\nedict with regard to them was well known: \"Let no Christian by violence\r\ncompel them to come dissenting or unwilling to Baptism. Further, let no\r\nChristian venture maliciously to harm their persons without a judgment\r\nof the civil power or to carry off their property or change their good\r\ncustoms which they have hitherto in that district which they inhabit.\"\r\nInnocent himself and several of his predecessors and successors are\r\nknown to have had Jewish physicians. Example speaks even louder than\r\nprecept, and the example of such men must have been a wonderful\r\nadvertisement for the Jewish physicians of the time.\r\n\r\nBesides Innocent III, many of the Popes of the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies issued similar decrees as to the Jews. It may be recalled that\r\nthis was the time when the Papacy was most powerful in Europe and when\r\nits decrees had most weight in all countries. Alexander II, Gregory IX,\r\nand Innocent IV all issued formal documents demanding the protection of\r\nthe Jews, and especially insisting that they must not be forced to\r\nreceive Baptism nor disturbed in the celebration of their festivals.\r\nClement VI did the same thing in the next century, and even offered them\r\na refuge from persecution throughout the rest of France at Avignon.\r\nDistinguished Jewish scholars, who know the whole story from careful\r\nstudy, have given due credit to the Popes for all that they did for\r\ntheir people. They have even declared that if the Jews were not\r\nexterminated in many of the European countries it was because of the\r\nprotection afforded by the Church. We have come to realize in recent\r\nyears that persecution of the Jews is not at all a religious matter, but\r\nis due to racial prejudice and jealousy of their success by the peoples\r\namong whom they settle. All sorts of pretexts are given for this\r\npersecution at all times. Formal Church documents and the personal\r\nactivities of the responsible Church officials show that during the\r\nMiddle Ages the Church was a protector and not a persecutor of the Jews.\r\n\r\nThere is abundant historical authority for the statement that the Popes\r\nwere uniformly beneficent in their treatment of the Jews. In order to\r\ndemonstrate this there is no need to quote Catholic historians, for\r\nnon-Catholics have been rather emphatic in bringing it out. Neander, the\r\nGerman Protestant historian, for instance, said:\r\n\r\n     \"It was a ruling principle with the Popes after the example of\r\n     their great predecessor, Gregory the Great, to protect the\r\n     Jews in the rights which had been conceded to them. When the\r\n     banished Popes of the twelfth century returned to Rome, the\r\n     Jews went forth in their holiday garments to meet them,\r\n     bearing before them the 'thora,' and Innocent II, on an\r\n     occasion of this sort, blessed them.\"\r\n\r\nEnglish non-Catholic historians can be quoted to the same effect. The\r\nAnglican Dean Milman, for instance, said: \"Of all European sovereigns,\r\nthe Popes, with some exceptions, have pursued the most humane policy\r\ntowards the Jews. In Italy, and even in Rome, they have been more rarely\r\nmolested than in the other countries.\"\r\n\r\nHallam has expressed himself to the same effect, especially as regards\r\nthe protection afforded to the Jew by the laws of the Church from the\r\ninjustice of those around him. Laws sometimes fail of their purpose and\r\nthe persecuting spirit of the populace is often hard to control, but\r\neverything that the central authority could do to afford protection was\r\ndone and essential justice was enshrined in the Church laws.\r\n\r\nProminent ecclesiastics would naturally follow the lines laid down by\r\ntheir Papal superiors. The attitude of those whose lives mark epochs in\r\nthe history of Christianity and who had more to do almost with the\r\nshaping of the policy of the Church at many times than the Popes\r\nthemselves, can be quoted readily to this same effect. Neander has\r\ncalled particular attention to St. Bernard's declarations with regard to\r\nthe evils that would follow any tolerance of such an abuse as the\r\npersecution of the Jews.\r\n\r\n     \"The most influential men of the Church protested against such\r\n     un-Christian fanaticism. When the Abbot Bernard of Clairvaux\r\n     was rousing up the spirit of the nations to embark in the\r\n     second crusade, and issued for this purpose, in the year 1146,\r\n     his letters to the Germans (East Franks), he at the same time\r\n     warned them against the influence of those enthusiasts who\r\n     strove to inflame the fanaticism of the people. He declaimed\r\n     against the false zeal, without knowledge, which impelled them\r\n     to murder the Jews, a people who ought to be allowed to live\r\n     in peace in the country.\"\r\n\r\nBut it has been said that there are decrees against Jewish physicians,\r\nissued especially in the south of France, by various councils and\r\nsynods of the Church. Attention needs to be called at once to the fact\r\nthat these are entirely local regulations and have nothing to do with\r\nthe attitude of the Church as a whole, but represent what the\r\necclesiastical authorities of a particular part of the country deem\r\nnecessary for some special reason in order to meet local conditions.\r\nIndeed at the end of the thirteenth and the early fourteenth century,\r\nwhen these decrees were being issued in France, full liberty was allowed\r\nin Italy, and there were no restrictions either as to medical practice\r\nor education founded on adhesion to Judaism.\r\n\r\nWhat need to be realized in order to understand the issuance of certain\r\nlocal ecclesiastical regulations forbidding Jews to practise medicine\r\nare the special conditions which developed in France at this time. Many\r\nJews had emigrated from Spain to France, and the reputation acquired by\r\nJewish physicians at Montpellier led to a number of the race taking up\r\nthe practice of medicine without any further qualification than the fact\r\nthat they were Jews. That gave them a reputation for curative powers of\r\nitself because of the fame of some Jewish doctors and their employment\r\nby the nobility and the highest ecclesiastics. It was hard to regulate\r\nthese wandering physicians. As a consequence of this, the faculty at\r\nParis, always jealous of its own rights and those of its students, at\r\nthe beginning of the fourteenth century absolutely forbade Jews from\r\npractising on Christian patients within its jurisdiction. Of course the\r\nfaculty of the University of Paris was dominated by ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities. The medical school was, however, almost entirely\r\nindependent of ecclesiastical influence, and was besides largely\r\nresponsible for this decree. It was felt that something had to be done\r\nto stop the evil that had arisen and the charlatanry and quackery which\r\nwas being practised. This was, however, rather an attempt to regulate\r\nthe practice of medicine and keep it in the hands of medical school\r\ngraduates than an example of intolerance towards the Jews. Practically\r\nno Jews had graduated at its university, Montpellier being their\r\nfavorite school, and Paris was not a little jealous of its rights to\r\nprovide for physicians from the northern part of France. We have not got\r\naway from manifestations of that spirit even yet, as our\r\nnon-reciprocating state medical laws show.\r\n\r\nDuring the next quarter of a century decrees not unlike those of the\r\nUniversity of Paris were issued in the south of France, especially in\r\nProvence and Avignon. Anyone who knows the conditions which existed in\r\nthe south of France at this time with regard to medical practice will be\r\naware that a number of attempts were made by the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities just at this time to regulate the practice of medicine.\r\nGreat abuses had crept in. Almost anyone who wished could set up as a\r\nphysician, and those who were least fitted were often best able to\r\nsecure a large number of patients by their cleverness, their knowledge\r\nof men, and their smooth tongues. The bishops of various dioceses met,\r\nand issued decrees forbidding anyone from practising medicine unless he\r\nwas a graduate of the medical school of the neighboring University of\r\nMontpellier. After a time it was found that the greatest number of\r\nviolators of these decrees were Jews. Accordingly special regulations\r\nwere made against them. They happen to be ecclesiastical regulations,\r\nbecause no other authority at that time claimed the right to regulate\r\nmedical education and the practice of medicine.\r\n\r\nWhat is sure is that many Jewish physicians reached distinction under\r\nChristian as well as Arabian rulers at all times during the Middle Ages.\r\nIt would be quite impossible in the limited space at command here to\r\ngive any adequate mention of what was accomplished by these Jewish\r\nphysicians, whose names we have scarcely been able to more than\r\ncatalogue, nor of the place they hold in their times. As the physicians\r\nof rulers, their influence for culture and the cultivation of science\r\nwas extensive, and as a rule they stood for what was best and highest in\r\neducation. The story of one of them, who is generally known in the\r\nChristian world at least, Maimonides, given in some detail, may serve as\r\na type of these Jewish physicians of the Middle Ages. He lived just\r\nbefore the flourishing period of university life in the thirteenth\r\ncentury brought about that wonderful development of medicine and surgery\r\nin the west of Europe that meant so much for the final centuries of the\r\nMiddle Ages. His works influenced not a little the great thinkers and\r\nteachers whose own writings were to be the foundations of education for\r\nseveral centuries after their time. Maimonides was well known in the\r\nWestern universities. Though his life had been mainly spent in the East,\r\nand he died there, there was scarcely a distinguished scholar of Europe\r\nwho was not acquainted directly or indirectly with his works, and the\r\ngreater the reputation of the scholar, as a rule, the more he knew of\r\nMaimonides, Moses AEgyptaeus, as he was called, and the more frequently he\r\nreferred to his writings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nMAIMONIDES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life of one of the great Jewish physicians, who has come to be known\r\nin history as Maimonides, is of such significance in medical biography\r\nthat he deserves to have a separate sketch. Born in Spain, his life was\r\nlived in the East, where his connection as royal physician with the\r\ngreat Sultan Saladin of Crusades fame made his influence widely felt. He\r\nis a type of the broadly educated man, conversant with the culture of\r\nhis time and of the past, knowing much besides medicine, who has so\r\noften impressed himself deeply on medical practice. While the narrow\r\nspecialists in each generation, the men who are quite sure that they are\r\ncuring the special ills of men to which they devote themselves, have\r\nalways felt that whatever of progress there was in any given time was\r\ndue to them, they occupy but little space as a rule in the history of\r\nmedicine. The men who loom large were the broad-minded, humanely\r\nsympathetic, deeply educated physicians, who treated men and their ills\r\nrather than their ills without due consideration of the individual, and\r\nwho not only relieved the discomfort of their patients and greatly\r\nlessened human suffering, and added to the sum of human happiness in\r\ntheir time, but also left precious deeply significant lessons for\r\nsucceeding generations of their profession. Hippocrates, Galen,\r\nSydenham, Auenbrugger, Morgagni, these are representatives of this great\r\nclass, and Maimonides must be considered one of them.\r\n\r\nMoses Ben Maimum, whose Arabic name was Abu Amran Musa Ben Maimum Obaid\r\nAlla el-Cordovi, who was called by his Jewish compatriots Ramban or\r\nRambam, was born at Cordova in Spain, on the 30th of March in 1135 or\r\n1139, the year is in doubt. It might not seem of much import now after\r\nnearly eight centuries, but not a little ink is spilt over it yet by\r\ndevoted biographers.\r\n\r\nWe are rather prone to think in our time that the conditions in which\r\nmen were born and reared before what we are pleased to call modern\r\ntimes, and, above all, in the Middle Ages, must have made a distinct\r\nhandicap for their intellectual development. Most of us are quite sure\r\nthat the conditions in medieval cities were eminently unsuited for the\r\nstimulation of the intellect, for incentive to art impulse, for uplift\r\nin the intellectual life, or for any such broad interest in what has\r\nbeen so well called the humanities--the humanizing things that lift us\r\nabove animal necessities--as would make for genuinely liberal education.\r\nWe are likely to be set in the opinion that the environment of the\r\ngrowing youth of an old-time city, especially so early as the middle of\r\nthe twelfth century, was poor and sordid. The cares of the citizens are\r\npresumed to have been mainly for material concerns, and, indeed, mostly\r\nfor the wants of the body. They were only making a start on the way from\r\nbarbarism to something like our glorious culmination of civilization. As\r\n\"the heirs to all the ages in the foremost files of time\" we are\r\nnecessarily far in advance of them, and we are only sorry that they did\r\nnot have the opportunity to live to see our day and enjoy the benefits\r\nof the evolution of humanity that is taking place during the eight\r\ncenturies that have elapsed.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, there was much more of abiding profound interest in\r\nreal civilization in many a medieval city, much more general\r\nappreciation of art, much more breadth of intelligence and sympathy with\r\nwhat we call the humanities, than in most of our large cities. The large\r\ncity, as we know it, is eminently a discourager of breadth of\r\nintelligence. Specialism in the various phases of money-making obscures\r\nculture. Maimonides, born in Cordova, was brought up amid surroundings\r\nthat teemed with incentives of every kind to the development of\r\nintelligence, of artistic taste, and everything that makes for\r\ncultivation of intellect rather than of interest in merely material\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nIt is well said that it is hard to judge the Cordova of old by its\r\ntawdry ruins of to-day. The educated visitor still stands in awe and\r\nadmiration of the great mosque which expressed the high cultivation of\r\nthe Moors of this time. It is a never-ending source of wonder to\r\nAmericans. The city itself has many reminders of that fine era of\r\nMoorish culture and refinement of taste and of art expression, which\r\nmade it in the best sense of the word a city beautiful. The Arab\r\ninvaders had found a great prosperous country which had been the most\r\ncultured province of the Roman Empire, and on this foundation they made\r\na marvellous development. \"The banks of the Guadalquivir,\" says Mr. S.\r\nLane-Poole in \"The Moors in Spain\" (London, 1887), \"were bright with\r\nmarble houses, mosques, and gardens, in which the rarest flowers and\r\ntrees of other countries were carefully cultivated, and the Arabs\r\nintroduced their system of irrigation which the Spaniards both before\r\nand since have never equalled.\" The greatest beauty of the city, of\r\ncourse, had come, and some of it had gone, before Maimonides' time. So\r\nmuch remains in spite of time and war, and many unfortunate influences,\r\nthat we can have some idea how beautiful it must have been in his youth\r\nseven centuries ago, and how even more beautiful in the foretime. Of the\r\ngreat mosque writers of travel can scarcely say enough. Mr. Lane-Poole\r\nsays: \"Travellers stand amazed among the forest of columns which open\r\nout apparently endless vistas on all sides. The porphyry, jasper, and\r\nmarbles are still in their places; the splendid glass mosaics, which\r\nartists from Byzantium came to make, still sparkle like jewels in the\r\nwalls; the daring architecture of the sanctuary, with its fantastic\r\ncrossed arches, is still as imposing as ever; the courtyard is still\r\nleafy with the orange trees that prolong the vistas of columns. As one\r\nstands before the loveliness of the great mosque, the thought goes back\r\nto the days of the glories of Cordova, the palmy days of the Great\r\nKhalif, which will never return.\"\r\n\r\nOf all the countries in which the Jews all down the centuries have lived\r\nthere is probably none of which they have been more loud in praise than\r\nSpain. Their poets sang of it as if it were their own country; for\r\ncenturies the people were happier here than probably they have been\r\nanywhere else for so long a period. Elsewhere in this book I have called\r\nattention to all that Spain meant in Europe during all the centuries\r\nfrom the beginning of the Roman Empire down to the end of the Middle\r\nAges. Maimonides was fortunate in his birthplace, then, and while\r\ncircumstances compelled the family to move away, this change did not\r\ncome until a good effect had been produced on the mind of the growing\r\nyouth. Even when persecution came, Maimonides clung to Spain with a\r\ntenacity born of deep affection and emphasized by admiration for all\r\nthat she was and had been. Cordova was the jewel of the Spain of this\r\ntime, and though much less than she had been in the long preceding time,\r\nwhen she was the birthplace of Lucan and the two Senecas, or even than\r\nwhat she had been in Abd-er-Rahman's days, or when she was the\r\nbirthplace of Averroes, still she remained wonderfully beautiful and\r\nattractive, winning and holding the affections of men.\r\n\r\nMaimonides' father, Maimum Ben Joseph, was a member of the Rabbinical\r\nCollege of Cordova, and famous for his knowledge of the Talmud. There\r\nare some writings of his on mathematics and astronomy extant. He\r\ndirected the education of his son, who, like many another distinguished\r\nscholar in later life, seems to have exhibited very little talent in his\r\nearly years. There is no rule in the matter. Precocity often\r\ndisappoints. Genius is often dull in childhood, but there are exceptions\r\nthat prove both rules. The basis of education in Spain at that time\r\namong the Jews was the Bible, the Talmud, mathematics, and astronomy, a\r\ngood rounded education in literature, the basis of law, and some exact\r\nphysical science. After his preliminary education at home Maimonides\r\nstudied the natural sciences and medicine with Moorish teachers.\r\nNature-study, in spite of frequent expressions that declare it new in\r\nmodern times, is as old as man. He also received a grounding in\r\nphilosophy as a preparation for his scientific studies. At the age of\r\ntwenty-three he began the composition of a commentary on the Talmud,\r\nwhich he continued to work at on his journeys in Spain and in Egypt.\r\nThis is considered to be one of the most important of this class of\r\nworks extant, though, almost needless to say, similar writings are very\r\nnumerous.\r\n\r\nIn the light of wanderings in philosophy during the centuries since, it\r\nis rather interesting to quote from that work the end of man as this\r\nJewish philosopher of the middle of the twelfth century saw it. Recent\r\nteleological tendencies in biology add to the interest of his views.\r\nAccording to Maimonides, \"Man is the end of the whole creation, and we\r\nhave only to look to him for the reason for its existence. Every object\r\nshows the end for which it was created. The palm-trees are there to\r\nprovide dates; the spider to spin her webs. All the properties of an\r\nanimal or a plant are directed so as to enable it to reach its purpose\r\nin life. What is the purpose of man? It cannot lie alone in eating and\r\ndrinking or yielding to passion, nor in the building of cities and the\r\nruling of others, since these objects lie outside of him, and do not\r\ntouch his essential being. Such material striving he has in common with\r\nthe animal. A man is lifted from a lower to a higher condition by his\r\nreason. Only through his reason is he placed above the animals. He is\r\nthe only reasonable animal. His reason enables him to understand all\r\nthings, especially the Unity of God, and all knowledge and science serve\r\nonly to direct man to the knowledge of God. Passions are to be subdued,\r\nsince the man who yields to passion subjects his spirit to his body, and\r\ndoes not reveal in himself the divine power which in him lies in his\r\nreason, but is swallowed up in the ocean of matter.\"\r\n\r\nNot long after Maimonides passed his twentieth year the family,\r\nconsisting of the father and his two sons, Moses and David, and a\r\ndaughter, moved from Cordova to Fez, compelled by Jewish persecutions.\r\nHere it is said that they had to submit to wearing the mask of Islam in\r\norder to lead a peaceful existence. This has been doubted, however, and\r\nhis whole life is in flagrant contradiction with any such even apparent\r\napostasy from the faith of his fathers. Father and son took advantage of\r\nthe opportunity of intercourse with Moorish physicians and philosophers\r\nto increase their store of knowledge, but could not be content in the\r\npolitical and religious conditions in which they were compelled to live.\r\nAbout 1155, then, they went to Jerusalem, but found conditions even more\r\nintolerable there, and turned back to Egypt, where they settled down in\r\nOld Cairo. In 1166 the father died, and after this we learn that the\r\nsons made a livelihood, and even laid the foundation of a fortune, by\r\ncarrying on a jewelry trade. Moses still devoted most of his time to\r\nstudy, while his brother did most of the business, but the brother was\r\nlost in the Indian Ocean, and with him went not only a large sum of his\r\nown money, but also much that had been entrusted to him by others.\r\nMaimonides undertook to pay off these debts and at the same time had to\r\nmeet the necessities not only of himself and sister, but also of the\r\nfamily of his dead brother. It was then that he took up the practice of\r\nmedicine and succeeded in making a great name and reputation for\r\nhimself. He continued to write, however, and completed his commentary on\r\nthe Talmud.\r\n\r\nAbout the age of fifty Maimonides, as seems to be true of a good many\r\nmen who live to old age, became rather discouraged and despondent about\r\nhimself. He refers to himself in his letters and writings rather\r\nfrequently as an old and ailing man. He had nearly twenty years of\r\nactive life ahead of him, but he had the persuasion that comes to many\r\nthat he was probably destined to an early death. His son was born\r\nshortly after this time, and that seems to have had not a little to do\r\nwith brightening his life. While in Egypt Maimonides married the sister\r\nof one of the royal secretaries, who, in turn, wedded Maimonides'\r\nsister. Maimonides took on himself the education of his son, who also\r\nbecame a physician, though his father was not to have the satisfaction\r\nof watching his success in the practice of his chosen profession. This\r\nson, Abraham, became the physician of Malie Alkamen, the brother of\r\nSaladin, and, besides, was a physician to the hospital at Cairo. _His_\r\nson, David, the grandson of Maimonides, practised medicine also at Cairo\r\ntill 1300. He in turn left two sons, Abraham and Solomon, who achieved\r\nreputation in the chosen profession of their great-grandfather.\r\n\r\nMaimonides, after the birth of his son, became one of the busiest of\r\npractising physicians. Indeed, it is hard to understand how he had the\r\ntime to do any writing in his busy life. Still less can we understand\r\nhis time for teaching. He was the physician to Saladin, whose relations\r\nwith Richard Coeur de Lion have made him known to English-speaking\r\npeople. Every morning, as the Court physician, Maimonides went to the\r\npalace, situated half a mile away from his dwelling, and if any of the\r\nmany officials and dependents that then, as now, were at Oriental\r\ncourts, were ill, he stayed there for some time. As a rule he could only\r\nget back to his own home in the afternoon, and then he was, as he says\r\nhimself, \"almost dying with hunger.\" Knowing the scantiness of the\r\nOriental breakfast, we are not surprised. There he found his\r\nwaiting-room full of patients, \"Jews and Mohammedans, prominent and\r\nunimportant, friends and enemies,\" he says himself, \"a varied crowd, who\r\nare looking for my medical advice. There is scarcely time for me to get\r\ndown from my carriage and wash myself and eat a little, and then until\r\nnight I am constantly occupied, so that, from sheer exhaustion, I must\r\nlie down. Only on the Sabbath day have I the time to occupy myself with\r\nmy own people and my studies, and so the day is away from me.\" What a\r\npicture it is of the busy medical teacher at all times in the world's\r\nhistory, yet it must not be forgotten that it is from these busy men\r\nthat we have derived our most precious lessons in caring for patients\r\nrather than disease, in the art of medicine rather than medical\r\nscience--and their practical lessons have been valuable long after the\r\nfine-spun theories of the scientist that took so long to elaborate have\r\nbeen placed definitely in the lumber room.\r\n\r\nHis reputation as a writer on medical topics is not as great as that\r\nwhich has been accorded him for his writings on philosophy and in\r\nTalmudic literature, but he well deserves a place among the great\r\npractical masters of medicine, as well as high rank among the physicians\r\nof his time. There is little that is original in his writing, but his\r\nthoroughgoing common sense, his wide knowledge, and his discriminating,\r\neclectic faculty make his writings of special value. As might have been\r\nexpected, the Aphorisms of Hippocrates attracted his attention, and,\r\nbesides, he wrote a series of aphorisms of his own. The most interesting\r\nof his writings, however, is a series of letters on dietetics written\r\nfor the son of his patron Saladin. The young prince seems to have\r\nsuffered from one of the neurotic conditions that so often develop in\r\nthose who have their lives all planned for them, and little incentive to\r\ndo things for themselves. The main portion of his complaints centred, as\r\nin the case of many another individual of leisure, in disturbances of\r\ndigestion. Besides, he suffered from constipation and feelings of\r\ndepression. Doubtless, like many a young person of the modern time, he\r\nwas quite sure that these symptoms portended some insidious organic\r\nailment that would surely bring an early death. When fathers, having\r\ndone all that there is to do, just expect their sons to enjoy the\r\nfruits of the paternal accomplishments, conditions of this kind very\r\noften develop, unless the young man proceeds to occupy himself with even\r\nmore dangerous distractions than he finds in unending thought about his\r\nown feelings.\r\n\r\nThe rules of life and health that Maimonides laid down in these letters\r\nhave become part of our popular medical tradition. Probably more of the\r\nordinarily current maxims as to health have been derived from them than\r\nwould possibly be suspected by anyone not familiar with them. In various\r\nforms his rules have been published a number of times. A good idea of\r\nthem can be obtained from the following compendium of them, which I\r\nabbreviate from a biographical sketch of Maimonides by Dr. Oppler, which\r\nappeared in the \"Deutsches Archiv fuer Geschichte der Medizin und\r\nMedicinische Geographie\" (Bd. 2, Leipzig, 1879).\r\n\r\n     1. Man is bound to lead a life pleasing to God if he wants to\r\n     have a healthy body, and he must hold himself far from\r\n     everything that can hurt his health and accustom himself to\r\n     whatever renews his strength. He should eat and drink only\r\n     when hungry and thirsty and should be particularly careful of\r\n     the regular evacuation of his bowels and of his bladder. He\r\n     must not delay either of these operations, but as far as\r\n     possible satisfy the inclination at once.\r\n\r\n     2. A man must not overload his stomach but be content always\r\n     with something less than is necessary to make him feel quite\r\n     satisfied. He should not drink much during the meal and only\r\n     of water and wine mixed, taking somewhat more after digestion\r\n     has begun and after digestion is completed, in moderation\r\n     according to his needs. Before a man sits down to table he\r\n     should note whether he has any tendency to evacuation and\r\n     should make the body warm by movement and activity. After this\r\n     exercise he should rest a little before taking food. It is\r\n     very beneficial after work to take a bath and then the meal.\r\n\r\n     3. Food should be taken always in the sitting position. There\r\n     should be no riding nor walking, nor movements of the body\r\n     until digestion is finished. The man who takes a walk or any\r\n     strenuous occupation immediately after eating subjects himself\r\n     to serious dangers of disease.\r\n\r\n     4. Day and night should be divided into twenty-four hours. Men\r\n     should sleep for eight hours, and so arrange their sleep that\r\n     the end of it comes with the dawn, so that from the beginning\r\n     of sleep until sunrise there should be an eight-hour interval.\r\n     We should all leave our beds about the time that the sun\r\n     rises.\r\n\r\n     5. During sleep a man should lie neither on his face nor on\r\n     his back but on his side, the beginning of the night on his\r\n     left and at the end on his right. He should not go to sleep\r\n     for three or four hours after eating and should not sleep\r\n     during the day.\r\n\r\n     6. Fruits that are laxative, as grapes, figs, melons, gourds,\r\n     should be taken only before meal time and not mixed with other\r\n     food. It would be better to let these get into the abdominal\r\n     organs and then take other food.\r\n\r\n     7. Eat what is easily digestible before what is difficult of\r\n     digestion. The flesh of birds before beef and the flesh of\r\n     calves before that of cows and steers. (Birds were then\r\n     thought more digestible than other flesh; we have reversed the\r\n     ruling. The note shows how light and digestible their flesh\r\n     was considered and the reason therefor.)\r\n\r\n     8. In summer eat cooling food, acids, and no spices. In\r\n     winter, on the contrary, eat warming foods, rich in spices,\r\n     mustard, and other heating substances. In cold and warm\r\n     climates one should eat according to the climatic conditions.\r\n\r\n     9. There are certain harmful foods that should be avoided.\r\n     Large salt fish, old cheese, old pickled meat, young new wine,\r\n     evil-smelling and bitter foods are often poisonous. There are\r\n     also some which are less harmful, but are not to be\r\n     recommended as ordinary nutritive materials. Large fish,\r\n     cheese, milk more than twenty-four hours after milking, the\r\n     flesh of old oxen, beans, peas, unleavened bread, sauerkraut,\r\n     onions, radishes and the like. These are to be taken only in\r\n     small quantities and only in the winter time and they should\r\n     be avoided in the summer. Beans and lentils are to be\r\n     recommended neither in winter nor summer.\r\n\r\n     10. As a rule one should avoid the eating of tree fruits, or\r\n     not eat much of them, especially when they are dry and even\r\n     less when they are green. If they are unripe they may cause\r\n     serious damage. Johannesbrod is very harmful at all times, as\r\n     are also all the sour fruits, and only small amounts of them\r\n     should be eaten in summer or in warm countries.\r\n\r\n     11. The fruits that are to be recommended dry as well as\r\n     fresh, are figs, grapes, and almonds. These may be eaten as\r\n     one has the appetite for them, but one should not accustom\r\n     himself to eat them much, though they are healthier than all\r\n     other fruits.\r\n\r\n     12. Honey and wine are not good for children, though they are\r\n     beneficial for older people, especially in winter. In summer\r\n     one-third less of them should be eaten than in winter.\r\n\r\n     13. Special care should be taken to have regular movements of\r\n     the bowels that carry off the impurities of the body. It is an\r\n     axiom in medicine, that so long as evacuations are absent, or\r\n     difficult, or require strong efforts, the individual is liable\r\n     to serious disease. Every medical means should be taken to\r\n     overcome constipation in order to escape its dangers. For\r\n     this purpose young people should be given salty food,\r\n     materials that have been soaked in olive oil, salt itself, or\r\n     certain vegetable soups with olive oil and salt. Older people\r\n     should take honey mixed with warm water early in the morning\r\n     and four hours later should take their breakfast. This\r\n     proceeding should be followed up from one to four days until\r\n     the constipation is overcome.\r\n\r\n     14. Another axiom of medicine is that so long as a man is able\r\n     to be active and vigorous, does not eat until he is over-full,\r\n     and does not suffer from constipation, he is not liable to\r\n     disease. Even such men, however, are much safer if they do not\r\n     take food that may disagree with them.\r\n\r\n     15. Whoever gives himself up to inactivity, or puts off\r\n     evacuations of the bowels, or suffers from constipation, will\r\n     be sure to suffer from many diseases and will see his strength\r\n     disappear even should he eat the best food in the world and\r\n     make use of all the remedies that physicians have. Immoderate\r\n     eating is a poison for men and the cause of many diseases\r\n     which attack them. Most diseases come from either eating too\r\n     much or partaking of unsuitable food. That was what Solomon\r\n     meant with his proverb: \"He who puts a guard over his mouth\r\n     and his tongue protects himself from many evils,\" that is to\r\n     say, whoever protects his mouth from the overindulgence in\r\n     food and his tongue from unsuitable speech protects himself\r\n     from many evils.\r\n\r\n     16. Every week at least a man should take a warm bath. One\r\n     should not bathe when hungry, nor after eating until the food\r\n     is digested, and bathe the whole body in warm but not too hot\r\n     water and the head in hot water. Afterwards the body should be\r\n     washed in lukewarm and cool water until finally cold water is\r\n     used. One should pour neither cold nor even lukewarm water on\r\n     the head, nor bathe in cold water in the winter time, nor when\r\n     the body is tired and in perspiration. At such times the bath\r\n     should be put off for a while.\r\n\r\n     17. As soon as one leaves the bath one should cover oneself,\r\n     and especially cover the head, so that no draught may strike\r\n     it. Even in summer, care must be taken to observe this rule.\r\n     After this one should rest for a while until the heat of the\r\n     body passes off and then should go to table. If one could\r\n     sleep a little just before a meal it is often very beneficial.\r\n     Neither during the bath nor immediately after it should cold\r\n     water be drunk, and if there is an inappeasable thirst a\r\n     little wine and water or water and honey should be taken. In\r\n     winter it is beneficial to rub the body with oil after the\r\n     bath.\r\n\r\n     18. Venesection should not be practised frequently, for it is\r\n     only meant for serious illness. It should not be permitted in\r\n     winter or summer, nor during the months of April or September\r\n     (the \"r\" months). After passing his fiftieth year an\r\n     individual should abstain from venesection. Venesection should\r\n     not be practised on the day when one takes a bath or goes on a\r\n     journey or returns from it. On the day when it is practised\r\n     less than usual should be eaten and drunk, and the patient\r\n     should give himself to rest, undertake no work nor bothersome\r\n     occupation, and take no walk.\r\n\r\n     19. Whoever observes these rules of life faithfully I\r\n     guarantee him a long life without disease. He shall reach a\r\n     good old age, and when he comes to die will not need a\r\n     physician. His body will remain always strong and healthy,\r\n     unless of course he has been born with a weak nature, or has\r\n     had an unfortunate bringing up, or should be attacked by\r\n     epidemic disease or by famine.\r\n\r\n     20. Only the healthy should keep these rules. Whoever is ill\r\n     or a sufferer from any injuries, or has lost his health\r\n     through bad habits, for him there are special rules for each\r\n     disease, only to be found in the medical books. Let it be\r\n     remembered that every change in a life habit is the beginning\r\n     of an ailment.\r\n\r\n     21. If no physician can be secured, then ailing people may use\r\n     these rules as well as the healthy.\r\n\r\nThese rules are, of course, full of the common sense of medicine that\r\nendures at all times. For the tropical climate of the Eastern countries\r\nthey probably represent as good advice as could be given even at the\r\npresent time. With them before us it is not surprising to find that on\r\nother subjects Maimonides was just as sensible. Perhaps in nothing is\r\nthis more striking than in his complete rejection of astrology.\r\nConsidering how long astrology, in the sense of the doctrine of the\r\nstars influencing human health and destinies, had dominated men's minds,\r\nand how universal was the acceptance of it, Maimonides' strong\r\nexpressions show how much genius lifts itself above the popular\r\npersuasions of its time, even among the educated, and how much it\r\nanticipates subsequent knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt is well to remind ourselves that as late as the middle of the\r\neighteenth century Mesmer's thesis on \"The Influence of the Stars on\r\nHuman Constitutions\" was accepted by the faculty of the University of\r\nVienna as a satisfactory evidence not only of his knowledge of medicine,\r\nbut of his power to reason about it. At the end of the twelfth century\r\nMaimonides was trying to argue it out of existence on the best possible\r\ngrounds. \"Know, my masters,\" he writes, \"that no man should believe\r\nanything that is not attested by one of these three sanctions:--rational\r\nproof as in mathematical science, the perception of the senses, or\r\ntraditions from the prophets and learned men.\" His biographer in the\r\nmonograph \"Maimonides,\" published by the Jewish Publication Society of\r\nAmerica[5], expresses his further views on the subject in compendious\r\nform, and then gives his final conclusion as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"'Works on astrology are the product of fools, who mistook\r\n     vanity for wisdom. Men are inclined to believe whatever is\r\n     written in a book, especially if the book be ancient; and in\r\n     olden times disaster befell Israel because men devoted\r\n     themselves to such idolatry instead of practising the arts of\r\n     martial defence and government.' He says, that he had himself\r\n     studied every extant astrological treatise, and had convinced\r\n     himself that none deserved to be called scientific. Maimonides\r\n     then proceeds to distinguish between astrology and astronomy,\r\n     in the latter of which lies true and necessary wisdom. He\r\n     ridicules the supposition that the fate of man could be\r\n     dependent on the constellations, and urges that such a theory\r\n     robs life of purpose, and makes man a slave of destiny. 'It is\r\n     true,' he concludes, 'that you may find strange utterances in\r\n     the Rabbinical literature which imply a belief in the potency\r\n     of the stars at a man's nativity, but no one is justified in\r\n     surrendering his own rational opinions because this or that\r\n     sage erred, or because an allegorical remark is expressed\r\n     literally. A man must never cast his own judgment behind him;\r\n     the eyes are set in front, not in the back.'\"\r\n\r\nWhile Maimonides could be so positive in his opinions with regard to a\r\nsubject on which he felt competent to say something, he was extremely\r\nmodest with regard to many of the great problems of medicine. He often\r\nuses the expression in his writings, \"I do not see how to explain this\r\nmatter.\" He quotes with approval from a Rabbi of old who had counselled\r\nhis students, \"teach thy tongue to say, I do not know.\" In this, of\r\ncourse, he has given the best possible evidence of his largeness of mind\r\nand his capacity for making advance in knowledge. It is when men are\r\nready to say, \"I do not know,\" that progress becomes possible. It is\r\nvery easy to rest in a conscious or unconscious pretence of knowledge\r\nthat obscures the real question at issue. A great thinker, who lived in\r\nthe century in which Maimonides died, Roger Bacon, set down as one of\r\nthe four principal obstacles to advance in knowledge indeed, as _the_\r\none of the four that hampered intellectual progress the most, the fact\r\nthat men feared to say, \"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features of Maimonides' career for the\r\nmodern time is the influence that his writings exerted over the rising\r\nintellectual life of Europe within a half century after his death. Most\r\npeople would be rather inclined to think that this Jewish author of the\r\nEast would have very little influence over the thinkers and teachers of\r\nEurope within a generation after his death. He died in 1204, just at the\r\nbeginning of one of the great productive centuries of humanity, perhaps\r\none of the greatest of them all. In literature, in art, in architecture,\r\nin philosophy, and in education, this century made wonderful strides.\r\nTwo of its greatest teachers, Albertus Magnus and his pupil, Thomas\r\nAquinas, quote from Moses AEgyptaeus, the European name for Maimonides at\r\nthat time, and evidently knew his writings very well. Maimonides was for\r\nthem an important connecting link with the world of old Greek thought.\r\nOthers of the writers and teachers of this time, as William of Auvergne,\r\nand the two great Franciscans, Alexander of Hales and Duns Scotus, were\r\nalso influenced by Maimonides. In a word, the educational world of that\r\ntime was much more closely united than we might think, and it did not\r\ntake long for a great writer's thoughts to make themselves felt several\r\nthousand miles away. Maimonides was, then, in his own time one of the\r\nworld teachers, and, in a certain sense, he must always remain that, as\r\nrepresenting a special development of what is best in human nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nGREAT ARABIAN PHYSICIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the place of the Arabs in medicine and in\r\nscience, a few words as to the rise of this people to political power,\r\nand then to the cultivation of literature and of science, are necessary.\r\nWe hear of the Arabs as hireling soldiers fighting for others during the\r\ncenturies just after Christ, and especially in connection with the story\r\nof the famous Queen Zenobia at Palmyra. After the destruction of this\r\ncity we hear nothing more of them until the time of Mohammed. During\r\nthese six and a half centuries there is little question of education of\r\nany kind among them except that at the end of the sixth century, the\r\nPersian King Chosroes I, who was much interested in medicine, encouraged\r\nthe medical school in Djondisabour, in Arabistan, founded at the end of\r\nthe fifth century by the Nestorian Christians, who continued as the\r\nteachers there until it became one of the most important schools of the\r\nEast. It was here that the first Arab physicians were trained, and here\r\nthat the Christian physicians who practised medicine among the Arabs\r\nwere educated.\r\n\r\nAmong the Arabs themselves, before the time of Mohammed, there had been\r\nvery little interest in medicine. Gurlt notes that even the physician of\r\nthe Prophet himself was, according to tradition, a Christian.\r\nMohammed's immediate successors were not interested in education, and\r\ntheir people mainly turned to Christian and Jewish physicians for\r\nwhatever medical treatment they needed. When the Caliphs came to be\r\nrulers of the Mohammedan Empire, they took special pains to encourage\r\nthe study of philosophy and medicine; though dissection was forbidden by\r\nthe Koran, most of the other medical sciences, and especially botany and\r\nall the therapeutic arts, were seriously cultivated.\r\n\r\nUntil the coming of Mohammed, the Arabs had been wandering tribes,\r\ngetting some fame as hireling soldiers, but now, under the influence of\r\na feeling of community in religion, and led by the military genius of\r\nsome of Mohammed's successors, whose soldiers were inspired by the\r\nreligious feelings of the sect, they made great conquests. The\r\nMohammedan Empire extended from India to Spain within a century after\r\nMohammed's death. Carthage was taken and destroyed, Constantinople was\r\nthreatened. In 661, scarcely forty years after the _hegira_ or flight of\r\nMohammed, from which good Mohammedans date their era, the capital was\r\ntransferred from Medina to Damascus, to be transferred from here to\r\nBagdad just about a century later, where it remained until the Mongols\r\nmade an end of the Abbasside rulers about the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. At the beginning the followers of Mohammed were opposed to\r\nknowledge and education of all kinds. Mohammed himself had but little.\r\nAccording to tradition, he could not read or write. The story told with\r\nregard to the Caliph Omar and the great library of Alexandria, seems to\r\nhave a foundation in reality, though such legends usually are not to be\r\ntaken literally. Certainly it represents the traditional view as to the\r\nattitude of the earlier Moslem rulers to education. Omar was asked what\r\nshould be done with the more than two million volumes. He said that the\r\nbooks in it either agreed with the Koran, or they did not. If they\r\nagreed with it they were quite useless. If they did not, they were\r\npernicious. In either case, they should be done away with, because there\r\nwas an element of danger in them. Accordingly, the precious volumes that\r\nhad been accumulating for nearly ten centuries, served, it is said, to\r\nheat the baths of Alexandria for some six months--probably the most\r\nprecious fuel ever used. Fortunately for posterity, the edict was not\r\nquite as universal in its application as the story would indicate, and\r\nexceptions were made for books of science.\r\n\r\nIn the course of their conquests, however, the Mohammedan Arabs captured\r\nthe Greek cities of Asia Minor. They were brought closely in contact\r\nwith Greek culture, Greek literature, and Greek thought. As has always\r\nbeen the case, captive Greece took its captors captive. What happened to\r\nthe Romans earlier came to pass also among the Arabs. Inspired by Greek\r\nphilosophy, science, and literature, they became ardent devotees of\r\nscience and the arts. While not inventing or discovering anything new,\r\nlike the Romans they carried on the old. Damascus, Basra, Bagdad,\r\nBokhara, Samarcand all became centres of culture and of education. Large\r\nsums were paid for Greek manuscripts, and for translations from them.\r\nUnder the famous Harun al-Raschid, at the end of the eighth century,\r\nwhose name is better known to us than that of any others, because of the\r\nstories of his wandering by night among his people in order to see if\r\njustice were done, three hundred scholars were sent at the cost of the\r\nCaliph to the various parts of the world in order to bring back\r\ntreasures of science, and especially of geography and medicine. It is an\r\ninteresting historical reflection that the Japanese and Chinese are\r\ndoing the same thing now.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs were very much taken by the philosophy of Aristotle, and it\r\nbecame the foundation of all their education. Greek thought, as always,\r\ninspired its students to higher things. Soon everywhere in the dominions\r\nof the Caliphs, philosophy, science, art, literature, and education\r\nnourished. Medicine was taken up with the other sciences and cultivated\r\nassiduously. Freind, in his \"Historia Medicinae,\" says that the writings\r\nof the old Greeks which treated of medicine were saved from destruction\r\nwith the other books at Alexandria, for the desire of health did not\r\nhave less strength among the Arabs than among other nations. Since these\r\nbooks taught them how to preserve health, and were not otherwise\r\ncontrary to the laws of the Prophet, that served to bring about their\r\npreservation. Freind also calls attention to the fact that grammars and\r\nbooks which treated of the science of language were likewise saved from\r\ndestruction. Besides the library, the Arabs, after their conquest of\r\nAlexandria in the eighth century, came under the influence of the\r\nuniversity still in existence there.\r\n\r\nIn the West, in Spain, the Arabs enjoyed the same advantages as regards\r\ncontact with culture and education as their conquest of the Eastern\r\ncities and Alexandria brought them in the East. While it is not\r\ngenerally realized, Spain was, as we have pointed out, the province of\r\nthe Roman Empire in the West that advanced most in culture before the\r\nbreaking up of the Empire. The Silver Age of Latin literature owes all\r\nof its geniuses to Spain. Lucan, the Senecas, Martial, Quintilian, are\r\nall Spaniards. Spain itself was a most flourishing province, and under\r\nthe Spanish Caesars, from the end of the first to about the end of the\r\nsecond century, increased rapidly in population. Spain was the leader in\r\nthese prosperous times, and the tradition of culture maintained itself.\r\nWhen Spain became Christian the first great Christian poet, Prudentius,\r\nborn about the middle of the fourth century, came from there. He has\r\nbeen called the Horace and Virgil of the Christians.\r\n\r\nThe coming down of the barbarians from the North disturbed Spain's\r\nprosperity and the peace and culture of her inhabitants, but it should\r\nnot be forgotten that the first medieval popularization of science, a\r\nsort of encyclopedia of knowledge, the first of its kind after that of\r\nPliny in the classical period, came from St. Isidore of Seville, a\r\nSpanish bishop.\r\n\r\nThere has been considerable tendency to insist that Spanish culture and\r\nintellectuality owe nearly all to the presence of the Moors in Spain.\r\nThis can only be urged, however, by those who know nothing at all of the\r\nSpanish Caesars, the place of Spain in the history of the Roman Empire,\r\nand the continuance of the culture that then reached a climax of\r\nexpression during succeeding centuries. On the contrary, the Moors who\r\ncame to Spain owe most of their tendency to devote themselves to culture\r\nand education to the state of affairs existent in Spain when they came.\r\nThere is no doubt that they raised standards of education and of culture\r\nabove the level to which they had sunk under the weight of the invading\r\nbarbarians from the North, and Spain owes much to the wise ruling and\r\ndevotion to the intellectual life of her Moorish invaders. All the\r\nfactors, however, must be taken together in order to appreciate properly\r\nthe conditions which developed under the Arabs in both the East and the\r\nWest. The Arabs invented little that was new in science or philosophy;\r\nthey merely carried on older traditions. It is for that that the modern\r\ntime owes them a great debt of gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHAZES\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished of the Arabian physicians was the man whose\r\nrather lengthy Arabian name, beginning with Abu Bekr Mohammed, finished\r\nwith el-Razi, and who has hence been usually referred to in the history\r\nof medicine as Rhazes. He was born about 850 at Raj, in the Province of\r\nChorasan in Persia. He seems to have had a liberal early education in\r\nphilosophy and in philology and literature. He did not take up medicine\r\nuntil later in life, and, according to tradition, supported himself as a\r\nsinger until he was thirty years of age. Then he devoted himself to\r\nmedical studies with the ardor and the success so often noted in those\r\nwhose opportunity to study medicine has been delayed. His studies were\r\nmade at Bagdad, where Ibn Zein el-Taberi was his teacher. He returned to\r\nhis native town and was for some time the head of the hospital there.\r\nLater he was called by the Sultan to Bagdad to take charge of the\r\nrenovated and enlarged hospital of the capital. His medical career,\r\nthen, is not unlike that of many another successful physician,\r\nespecially of the modern time. At Bagdad he had abundant opportunities\r\nfor study, and the ambition to make medicine as well as to make money\r\nand gain fame.\r\n\r\nHis studies in science were all founded on Aristotle. Though he was\r\ncalled the Galen of his time, and looked up to the Greek physician as\r\nhis master, even the authority of Galen did not override that of the\r\nStagirite in his estimation. One of his aphorisms is said to have been,\r\n\"If Galen and Aristotle are of one mind on a subject, then surely their\r\nopinion is true. When they differ, however, it is extremely difficult\r\nfor the scholar to decide which opinion should be accepted.\" He drew\r\nmany pupils to Bagdad, and, when one knows his teaching, this is not\r\nsurprising. Some of his aphorisms are very practical. While the\r\nexpressions just quoted with regard to Galen and Aristotle might seem to\r\nindicate that Rhazes was absolutely wedded to authority, there is\r\nanother well-known maxim of his which shows how much he thought of the\r\nvalue of experience and observation. \"Truth in medicine,\" he said, \"is a\r\ngoal which cannot be absolutely reached, and the art of healing, as it\r\nis described in books, is far beneath the practical experience of a\r\nskilful, thoughtful physician.\" Some of his other medical aphorisms are\r\nworth noting. \"At the beginning of a disease choose such remedies as\r\nwill not lessen the patient's strength.\" \"When you can heal by diet,\r\nprescribe no other remedy, and, where simple remedies suffice, do not\r\ntake complicated ones.\"\r\n\r\nRhazes knew well the value of the influence of mind over body even in\r\nserious organic disease, and even though death seemed impending. One of\r\nhis aphorisms is: \"Physicians ought to console their patients even if\r\nthe signs of impending death seem to be present. For the bodies of men\r\nare dependent on their spirits.\" He considered that the most valuable\r\nthing for the physician to do was to increase the patient's natural\r\nvitality. Hence his advice: \"In treating a patient, let your first\r\nthought be to strengthen his natural vitality. If you strengthen that,\r\nyou remove ever so many ills without more ado. If you weaken it,\r\nhowever, by the remedies that you use you always work harm.\" The simpler\r\nthe means by which the patient's cure can be brought about, the better\r\nin his opinion. He insists again and again on diet rather than\r\nartificial remedies. \"It is good for the physician that he should be\r\nable to cure disease by means of diet, if possible, rather than by means\r\nof medicine.\" Another of his aphorisms seems worth while quoting: \"The\r\npatient who consults a great many physicians is likely to have a very\r\nconfused state of mind.\"\r\n\r\nSome idea of Rhazes' strenuous activity as a writer on medical subjects\r\nmay be obtained from the fact that thirty-six of his works are still\r\nextant, and there are nearly two hundred others of which only the\r\ntitles have been preserved. Some of these are doubtless the works of\r\npupils and students of succeeding generations, published under his name\r\nto attract attention. His principal work is \"Continens,\" or\r\n\"Comprehensor,\" which owes its title to the fact that it was meant to\r\ncontain the whole practice of medicine and surgery. It includes\r\nreferences to the writings of all previous distinguished medical\r\nwriters, from Hippocrates to Honein Ben Ishac, also known as\r\nJohannitius, a Christian Arabian physician, one of Rhazes' teachers. The\r\nmost frequently quoted of these authorities are Galen, Oribasius,\r\nAetius, and Paul of AEgina. The work, however, is not made up entirely of\r\nquotations, but contains many observations made by the author himself.\r\nGurlt says that the foundation of the theoretic medicine of Rhazes is\r\nthe system of Galen, while in practice he seems to cling more to the\r\naphorisms of Hippocrates. He has many practical points which show that\r\nhe thought for himself. For instance, in wounds of the abdomen, if the\r\nintestines are extruded and cannot be replaced, he suggests the\r\nsuspension of the patient by his hands and feet in a bath in order to\r\nfacilitate their return. If they do not go back readily, compresses\r\ndipped in warm wine should be used. Cancer he declares to be almost\r\nincurable. He has much to say about the bites of animals and their\r\ntendency to be poisonous, knew rabies very well, and knew also that the\r\nbites of men might have similar serious consequences.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give any adequate idea of the thoroughly practical\r\ncharacter of Rhazes' medical writing in a few lines, but it may suffice\r\nto say that there is scarcely any feature of modern medicine and surgery\r\nthat he does not touch, and oftener than not his touch is sure and\r\nrational and frequently much better than the advice of successors long\r\nafter him in the same matters. An example or two will suffice to\r\nillustrate this. In the treatment of nasal polyps he says that whenever\r\ndrug treatment of these is not successful, they should be removed with a\r\nsnare made of hair. For fall of the uvula he suggests gargles, but when\r\nthese fail he advises resection and cauterization. Among the affections\r\nof the tongue he numbers abscess, fissure, ulcer, cancer, ranula,\r\nshortening of the ligaments, hypertrophy, erythema of the mucous\r\nmembrane, and inflammatory swelling. In general his treatment of the\r\nupper respiratory tract is much farther advanced than we might think\r\npossible at this time. He advises tracheotomy whenever there is great\r\ndifficulty of respiration, and describes how it should be done. After\r\nthe dyspnea has passed the edges of the wound should be brought together\r\nwith sutures. It is not surprising, then, to find that the treatment of\r\nfractures and luxations is eminently practical, and, indeed, on any\r\nsubject that he touches he throws practical light.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to his edition of the works of Ambroise Pare,\r\nMalgaigne says that the first reference to a metal band in connection\r\nwith trusses is to be found in Rhazes. Hernia was, of course, one of the\r\nserious ailments that, because of its superficial character, was rather\r\nwell understood, and so it is not surprising to find that much of our\r\nmodern treatment of it was anticipated. The manipulations for taxis, the\r\nuse of a warm bath for the relaxation of the patient by means of heat\r\nand by putting the head and feet higher than the abdomen while in the\r\nbath, and the employment of various kinds of trusses to prevent\r\nstrangulation of the hernia recur over and over again, in the authors of\r\nthe Middle Ages. Many of the suggestions are to be found in the early\r\nGreek authors, but subsequent writers give a certain personal expression\r\nto them which shows how much they had learned by personal observation in\r\nthe employment of various methods.\r\n\r\nPagel, in Puschmann's \"Handbook of the History of Medicine,\" declares\r\nthat Rhazes' most important work for pure medicine is his monograph on\r\nsmallpox. Its principal value is due to the fact that, though he has\r\nconsulted old authorities carefully, his discussion of the disease is\r\nfounded almost entirely on his own experience. His description of the\r\nvarious stages of the disease, of the forms of the eruption, and of the\r\ndifferential diagnosis, is very accurate. He compares the course of the\r\nfever with that of other fevers, and brings out exactly what constitutes\r\nthe disease. His suggestions as to prognosis are excellent. Those cases,\r\nhe declares, are particularly serious in which the eruption takes on a\r\ndark, or greenish, or violet color. The prognosis is also unfavorable\r\nfor those cases which, having considerable fever, have only a slight\r\namount of rash. His treatment of the disease in young persons was by\r\nvenesection and cool douches. Cold water and acid drinks should be\r\nadministered freely, so that sweat and other excretions may carry off\r\npoisonous materials. Care must be taken to watch the pulse, the\r\nbreathing, the appearance of the feet, the evacuations from the bowels,\r\nand to modify therapy in accordance with these indications. The eruption\r\nis to be encouraged by external warmth and special care must be taken\r\nwith regard to complications in the eyes, the ears, the nose, the mouth,\r\nand the pharynx.\r\n\r\nA fact that will, perhaps, give the best idea to modern readers of the\r\nplace of Rhazes in the history of medicine is that Vesalius considered\r\nit worth his while to make a translation of his principal work.\r\nUnfortunately that translation has not come down to us. When Vesalius,\r\npestered by the controversies that had come upon him because of his\r\nventuring to make his observations for himself, accepted the post of\r\nphysician to the Emperor Charles V, he burnt a number of his\r\nmanuscripts. Among these were his translation of Rhazes and some\r\nannotations on Galen, which, as he says himself, had grown into a huge\r\nvolume. The Galenists were bitterly decrying his refusal to accept Galen\r\non many points, and both of these works would have added fuel to the\r\nflame of controversy. He deemed it wiser, then, not to give any further\r\nopportunities for rancorous criticism, and, feeling presumably that in\r\nhis new and important post it was not worth while to bother further over\r\nthe matter, he burnt them. He tells the reason in his letters to Joachin\r\nRoelant: \"When I was about to leave Italy to go to Court, since a number\r\nof the physicians whom you know had made the worst kind of censure of\r\nmy books, both to the Emperor himself, and to other rulers, I burned\r\nall the manuscripts that were left, although I had never suffered a\r\nmoment under the displeasure of the Emperor because of these complaints,\r\nand in spite of the fact that a number of friends who were present urged\r\nme not to destroy them.\"\r\n\r\nVesalius' translation of Rhazes was probably undertaken because he\r\nrecognized in him a kindred spirit of original investigation and\r\ninquiry, whose work, because it was many centuries old, would command\r\nthe weight of an authority and at the same time help in the controversy\r\nover Galenic questions. This, of itself, would be quite enough to make\r\nthe reputation of Rhazes, even if we did not know from the writings\r\nthemselves and from the admiration of many distinguished men as well as\r\nthe incentive that his works have so often proved to original\r\nobservation, that he is an important link in the chain of observers in\r\nmedicine, who, though we would naturally expect them to be so frequent,\r\nare really so rare.\r\n\r\n\r\nALI ABBAS\r\n\r\nRhazes lived well on into the tenth century. His successor in prestige,\r\nthough not his serious rival, was Ali Ben el-Abbas, usually spoken of in\r\nmedical literature as Ali Abbas, a distinguished Arabian physician who\r\ndied near the end of the tenth century. He wrote a book on medicine\r\nwhich, because of its dedication to the Sultan, to whom he was\r\nbody-physician, is known as the \"Liber Regius,\" or \"Royal Book of\r\nMedicine.\" This became the leading text-book of medicine for the Arabs\r\nuntil replaced by the \"Canon of Avicenna\" some two centuries later. The\r\n\"Liber Regius\" was an extremely practical work and, like most of the\r\nArabian books of the early times, is simple and direct, quite without\r\nmany of the objectionable features that developed later in Arabian\r\nmedicine. It is valuable mainly for its contributions to diet and the\r\nfact that Ali Abbas tested many of his medicines on ailing animals\r\nbefore applying them to men. Of course, it owes much to earlier writers\r\non medicine, and especially to Paul of AEgina.\r\n\r\nAn example of its practical value is to be found in his description of\r\nthe treatment of a wound of the brachial artery, when, as happened often\r\nin venesection from the median basilic vein, it was injured through\r\ncarelessness or inadvertence. If astringent or cauterizing methods do\r\nnot stop the bleeding, the artery should be exposed, carefully isolated,\r\ntied in two places above and below the wound, and then cut across\r\nbetween them. He has many similar practical bits of technique. For\r\ninstance, in pulling a back tooth he recommends that the gums be incised\r\nso as to loosen them around the roots, and then the tooth itself may be\r\ndrawn with a special forceps which he calls a molar forceps. In ascites\r\nhe recommends that when other means fail an opening should be made three\r\nfinger-breadths below the navel with a pointed phlebotomy knife, and a\r\nportion of the fluid allowed to evacuate itself. A tube should then be\r\ninserted, but closed. The next day more of the fluid should be allowed\r\nto come away, and then the tube removed and the abdomen wrapped with a\r\nfirm bandage.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that Ali Abbas' book should have been popular,\r\nand the more we know of it the easier it is to explain why Constantine\r\nAfricanus should have selected it for translation. It contains ten\r\ntheoretic and ten practical books, and gives an excellent idea of the\r\nmedical knowledge and medical practice of the time. Probably the fact\r\nthat Constantine had translated it led to its early printing, so that we\r\nhave an edition of it published at Venice in 1492, and another at Lyons\r\nin 1523. During the Middle Ages the book was often spoken of as \"Regalis\r\nDispositio,\" the \"Royal Disposition of Medicine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMOORISH PHYSICIANS\r\n\r\nAfter Rhazes, the most important contributors to medical literature from\r\namong the Arabs, with the single exception of Avicenna, were born in\r\nSpain. They are Albucasis or Abulcasis, the surgeon; Avenzoar, the\r\nphysician, and Averroes, the philosophic theorist in medicine. Besides,\r\nit may be recalled here that Maimonides, the great Jewish physician, was\r\nborn and educated at Cordova, in Spain. It might very well be a surprise\r\nthat these distinguished men among the Arabs should have flourished in\r\nSpain, so far from the original seat of Arabian and Mohammedan dominion\r\nin the East, where, owing to conditions in the modern time, the\r\nEnglish-speaking world particularly is not likely to assume that the\r\nenvironment was favorable for the development of science and\r\nphilosophy. Anyone who recalls, however, the history of Spanish\r\nintellectual influence in the Roman Empire, as we have traced it at the\r\nbeginning of this chapter, will appreciate how favorable conditions were\r\nin Spain for the fostering of intellectual development. With the\r\ndisturbances that had come from political strife and the invasion of the\r\nbarbarians in Italy, Spain had undoubtedly come to hold the primacy in\r\nthe intellectual life of Europe at the time when the Arabs took\r\npossession of the peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\nABULCASIS\r\n\r\nThe most important of the Arabian surgeons of the Middle Ages is\r\nAlbucasis or Abulcasis, also Abulkasim, who was born near Cordova, in\r\nSpain. The exact year of his birth is not known, but he flourished in\r\nthe second half of the tenth century. He is said to have lived to the\r\nage of 101. The name of his principal work, which embraces the whole of\r\nmedicine, is \"Altasrif,\" or \"Tesrif,\" which has been translated \"The\r\nMiscellany.\" Most of what he has to say about medical matters is taken\r\nfrom Rhazes. His work on surgery, however, in three books, represents\r\nhis special contribution to the medical sciences. It contains a number\r\nof illustrations of instruments, and is the first illustrated medical\r\nbook that has come to us. It was translated into Latin, and was studied\r\nvery faithfully by all the surgeons of the Middle Ages. Guy de Chauliac\r\nhas quoted Albucasis about two hundred times in his \"Chirurgia Magna.\"\r\nEven as late as the beginning of the sixteenth century Fabricius de\r\nAcquapendente, the teacher of Harvey, confessed that he owed most to\r\nthree great medical writers, Celsus (first century), Paul of AEgina\r\n(seventh century), and Abulcasis (tenth century).\r\n\r\nAbulcasis insisted that for successful surgery a detailed knowledge of\r\nanatomy was, above all, necessary. He said that the reason why surgery\r\nhad declined in his day was that physicians did not know their anatomy.\r\nThe art of medicine, he added further, required much time.\r\nUnfortunately, to quote Hippocrates, there are many who are physicians\r\nin name only, and not in fact, especially in what regards surgery. He\r\ngives some examples of surgical mistakes made by his professional\r\nbrethren that were particularly called to his attention. They are the\r\nperennially familiar instances of ignorance causing death because\r\nsurgeons were tempted to operate too extensively.\r\n\r\nHis description of the procedure necessary to stop an artery from\r\nbleeding is an interesting example of his method of teaching the\r\npractical technique of surgery. Apply the finger promptly upon the\r\nopening of the vessel and press until the blood is arrested. Having\r\nheated a cautery of the appropriate size, take the finger away rapidly\r\nand touch the cautery at once to the end of the artery until the blood\r\nstops. If the spurting blood should cool the cautery, take another.\r\nThere should be several ready for the purpose. Take care, he says, not\r\nto cauterize the nerves in the neighborhood, for this will add a new\r\nailment to the patient's affection. There are only four ways of\r\narresting arterial hemorrhage. First, by cautery; second, by division\r\nof the artery, when that is not complete--for then the extremities\r\ncontract and the blood clots--or by a ligature, or by the application of\r\nsubstances which arrest blood flow, aided by a compressive bandage.\r\nOther means are inefficient, and seldom and, at most, accidentally\r\nsuccessful. His instruction for first aid to the injured in case of\r\nhemorrhage in the absence of the physician, is to apply pressure\r\ndirectly upon the wound itself.\r\n\r\nThe development of the surgical specialties among the Arabs is\r\nparticularly interesting. Abulcasis has much to say about nasal polyps.\r\nHe divided them into three classes: (1) cancerous, (2) those with a\r\nnumber of feet, and (3) those that are soft and not living,--these\r\nlatter, he says, are neither malignant nor difficult to treat. He\r\nrecommends the use of a hook for their removal, or a snare for those\r\nthat cannot be removed with that instrument. His instructions for the\r\nremoval of objects from the external ear are interestingly practical. He\r\nadvises the use of bird lime on the end of a sound to which objects will\r\ncling, or, where they are smaller, suction through a silver or copper\r\ncanula. Hooks and pincettes are also suggested. Insects should be\r\nremoved with a hook, or with a canula, or, having been killed by warm\r\noil, removed by means of a syringe. Some of his observations with regard\r\nto genito-urinary surgery are quite as interesting. He even treated\r\ncongenital anomalies. He suggests cutting of the meatus when narrowed,\r\ndilatation of strictures with lead sounds, and even suggests plans of\r\noperations to improve the condition in hypospadias. He gives the signs\r\nfor differentiation between epitheliomata and condylomata, and\r\ndistinguishes various forms of ulceration of the penis.\r\n\r\nAbulcasis discusses varicose veins in very much the same spirit as a\r\nmodern surgeon does. They occur particularly in people who work much on\r\ntheir feet, and especially who have to carry heavy burdens. They should\r\nnot be operated on unless they produce great discomfort, and make it\r\nimpossible for the sufferer to make his living. They may be operated on\r\nby means of incision or extirpation. Incision consists of cutting the\r\nveins at two or three places when they have been made prominent by means\r\nof tight bandages around the limb. The blood should be allowed to flow\r\nfreely out of the cut ends, and then a bandage applied. For extirpation,\r\nthe skin having been shaved beforehand, the vein should be made\r\nprominent, and then carefully laid bare. When freed from all adhesions,\r\nit should be lifted out on a hook, and either completely extirpated or\r\nseveral rather long pieces removed. He lays a good deal of stress on the\r\nnecessity for freeing the vein thoroughly and lifting it well out of\r\ntissues before incising it. In old cases special care must be taken not\r\nto tear the vein.\r\n\r\nMinute details of technique are often found in these old authors.\r\nAbulcasis, for instance, treats of adherent fingers with up-to-date\r\ncompleteness. They can occur either congenitally or from injury, as, for\r\ninstance, burning. They should be separated, and then separation\r\nmaintained by means of bandages or by the insertion between them of a\r\nthin lead plate, which prevents their readhesion. Adhesions of the\r\nfingers with the palm of the hand, which Abulcasis has also seen,\r\nshould be treated the same way.\r\n\r\nAt times there is surprise at finding some rare lesion treated with\r\nmodern technique, and a hint at least of our modern apparatus. Fracture\r\nof the pubic arch, for instance, is described in Abulcasis quite as if\r\nhe had had definite experience with it. When this occurs in a woman, the\r\nreposition of the bone is often greatly facilitated by a cotton tampon\r\nin the vagina. This tampon must be removed at every urination. There is\r\nanother way, however, of better securing the same purpose of\r\ncounterpressure. One may take a sheep's bladder into the orifice of\r\nwhich a tube is fastened. One should introduce the bladder into the\r\nvagina, and then blow strongly through the tube, until the bladder\r\nbecomes swollen and fills up the vaginal cavity. The fracture will, as a\r\nrule, then be readily reduced. Here is, of course, not alone the first\r\nhint of the colpeurynter, but a very practical form of the apparatus\r\ncomplete. Old-time physicians used the bladders of animals very\r\ngenerally for nearly all the medical purposes for which we now use\r\nrubber bags.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVICENNA\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the most important of Abulcasis' contemporaries is the\r\nfamous physician whose Arabic name, Ibn Sina, was transformed into\r\nAvicenna. He was born toward the end of the tenth century in the Persian\r\nprovince of Chorasan, at the height of Arabian influence, and is\r\nsometimes spoken of as the chief representative of Arabian medicine, of\r\nas much importance for it as Galen for later Greek medicine. His\r\nprincipal book is the so-called \"Canon.\" It replaced the compendium\r\n\"Continens\" of Rhazes, and, in the East, continued until the end of the\r\nfifteenth century to be looked upon as the most complete and best system\r\nof medicine. Avicenna came to be better known in the West than any of\r\nthe other Arabian writers, and his name carried great weight with it.\r\nThere are very few subjects in medicine that did not receive suggestive,\r\nif not always adequate, treatment at the hands of this great Arabian\r\nmedical thinker of the eleventh century. He copied freely from his\r\npredecessors, but completed their work with his own observations and\r\nconclusions. One of his chapters is devoted to leprosy alone. He has\r\ndefinite information with regard to bubonic plague and the _filaria\r\nmedinensis_. Here and there one finds striking anticipations of what are\r\nsupposed to be modern observations. Nothing was too small for his\r\nnotice. One portion of the fourth book is on cosmetics, in which he\r\ntreats the affections of the hair and of the nails. He has special\r\nchapters with regard to obesity, emaciation, and general constitutional\r\nconditions. His book, the \"Antidotarium,\" is the foundation of our\r\nknowledge of the drug-giving of his time.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the popularity and influence of Avicenna, five centuries\r\nafter his time, can be readily derived from the number of commentaries\r\non him issued during the Renaissance period by the most distinguished\r\nmedical scholars and writers of that time. Hyrtl, in his \"Das Arabische\r\nund Hebraeische in der Anatomie,\" quotes some of them,--Bartholomaeus de\r\nVarignana, Gentilis de Fulgineis, Jacobus de Partibus, Didacus Lopez,\r\nJacobus de Forlivio, Ugo Senesis, Dinus de Garbo, Matthaeus de Gradibus,\r\nNicolaus Leonicenus, Thaddaeus Florentinus, Galeatus de Sancta Sophia. A\r\nmore complete list, with the titles of the books, may be found in\r\nHaller's \"Bibliotheca Anatomica.\" For over three centuries after the\r\nfoundation of medical schools in Europe (and even after Mondino's book\r\nhad been widely distributed), Avicenna was still in the hands of all\r\nthose who had an enthusiasm for medical science.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVENZOAR\r\n\r\nAnother of the distinguished Arabian physicians was Avenzoar--the\r\ntransformation of his Arabic family name, Ibn-Zohr. He was probably born\r\nin Penaflor, not far from Seville. He died in Seville in 1162 at the\r\nage, it is said, of ninety-two years. He was the son of a physician\r\ndescended from a family of scholars, jurists, physicians, and officials.\r\nHe received the best education of the time not only in internal\r\nmedicine, but in all the specialties, and must be counted among the\r\ngreatest of the Spanish Arabian physicians. He was the teacher of\r\nAverroes, who always speaks of him with great respect. He is interesting\r\nas probably being the first to suggest nutrition _per rectum_. A few\r\nwords of his description show how well he knew the technique. His\r\napparatus for the purpose consisted of the bladder of a goat or some\r\nsimilar animal structure, with a silver canula fastened into its neck,\r\nto be used about as we use a fountain syringe. Having first carefully\r\nwashed out the rectum with cleansing and purifying clysters, he injected\r\nthe nutriment--eggs, milk, and gruels--into the gut. His idea was that\r\nthe intestine would take this, and, as he said, suck it up, carrying it\r\nback to the stomach, where it would be digested. He was sure that he had\r\nseen his patients benefited by it.\r\n\r\nSome light on his studies of cases that would require such treatment may\r\nbe obtained from what he has to say about the handling of a case of\r\nstricture of the esophagus. He says that this begins with some\r\ndiscomfort, and then some difficulty of swallowing, which is gradually\r\nand continuously increased until finally there comes complete\r\nimpossibility of swallowing. It was in these cases that he suggested\r\nrectal alimentation, but he went farther than this, and treated the\r\nstricture of the esophagus itself.\r\n\r\nThe first step in this treatment is that a canula of silver or tin\r\nshould be inserted through the mouth and pushed down the throat till its\r\nhead meets an obstruction, always being withdrawn when there is a\r\nvomiting movement, until it becomes engaged in the stricture. Then\r\n_freshly milked_ milk, or gruel made from farina or barley, should be\r\npoured through it. He says that in these cases the patient might be put\r\nin a warm milk or gruel bath, since there are some physicians who\r\nbelieve that through the lower parts of the body, and also through the\r\npores of the whole body, nutrition might be taken up. While he considers\r\nthat this latter method should be tried in suitable cases, he has not\r\nvery much faith in it, and says that the reasons urged for it are weak\r\nand rather frivolous. It is easy to understand that a man who has\r\nreached the place in medicine where he can recommend manipulative\r\ntreatments of this kind, and discuss nutritional modes so rationally,\r\nknew his practical medicine well, and wrote of it judiciously.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVERROES\r\n\r\nAmong the distinguished contributors to medicine at this time, though\r\nmore a philosopher than a physician, is the famous Averroes, whose full\r\nArabic name among his contemporaries was Abul-Welid Mohammed Ben Ahmed\r\nIbn Roschd el-Maliki. Like Avenzoar, of whom he was the intimate\r\npersonal friend, and Abulcasis and Maimonides, he was born in the south\r\nof Spain. He was in high favor with the King of Morocco and of Spain,\r\nEl-Mansur Jacub, often known as Almansor, who made him one of his\r\ncounsellors. His works are much more important for philosophy than for\r\nmedicine, and his philosophical writings gave him a place only second to\r\nthat of Aristotle in the Western world during the Middle Ages. Averroism\r\nis still a subject of at least academic interest, and Renan's monograph\r\non it and its author was one of the popular books of the latter half of\r\nthe nineteenth century in philosophic circles. In spite of his\r\nfriendship with the Moorish King and with Avenzoar, he fell under the\r\nsuspicion of free thinking and was brought to trial with a number of\r\npersonal friends, who occupied high positions in the Moorish\r\ngovernment. He escaped with his life, but only after great risks, and he\r\nwas banished to a suburb of Cordova, in which only Jews were allowed to\r\nlive. By personal influence he succeeded in securing the pardon of\r\nhimself and friends, and then was summoned to the court of the son and\r\nsuccessor of El-Mansur in Morocco. He died, not long after, in 1198.\r\n\r\nAltogether there are some thirty-three works of Averroes on philosophy\r\nand science. Only three of these are concerned with medicine. One is the\r\n\"Colliget,\" so-called, containing seven books, on anatomy, physiology,\r\npathology, diagnostics, materia medica, hygiene, and therapy. Then there\r\nis a commentary on the \"Cantica of Avicenna,\" and a tractate on the\r\n\"Theriac.\" Averroes' idea in writing about medicine was to apply his\r\nparticular system of philosophy to medical science. His intimate\r\nrelations with other great physicians of the time, and in particular his\r\nclose friendship with Avenzoar, enabled him to get abundant medical\r\ninformation in faultless order so far as knowledge then went, but his\r\ntheoretic speculations, instead of helping medicine, as he thought they\r\nwould, and as philosophers have always been inclined to think as regards\r\ntheir theoretic contributions, were not only not of value, but to some\r\nextent at least hindered human progress by diverting men from the field\r\nof observation to that of speculation. It is interesting to realize that\r\nAverroes did in his time what Descartes did many centuries later, and\r\nmany another brilliant thinker has done before and since.\r\n\r\n\r\nARABIAN INFLUENCE\r\n\r\nThe fame of these great thinkers and writers in philosophy and in\r\nmedicine came to be known not only through the distribution of their\r\nbooks long after their death, but during their lifetime, and in\r\nimmediately subsequent generations, ardent seekers after knowledge, who\r\nwere themselves afterwards to become famous by their teaching and\r\nwriting, found their way into the Arabian dominions in order to take\r\nadvantage of the educational opportunities afforded. These were better\r\nthan they could secure at home in Christian countries, because the\r\nprocess of bringing culture and devotion to literature and science into\r\nthe minds of the Northern nations, who had replaced the old Romans in\r\nEurope, was not yet completed. Bagdad and Cordova were the two favorite\r\nplaces of educational pilgrimage. The names that are most familiar among\r\nthe scholars in the Middle Ages in Europe are those of whom it is\r\nrecorded that they made long journeys in order to get in touch with what\r\nthe Arabs had preserved of the old Greek civilization and culture. Among\r\nthem are such men as Michael Scot or Scotus, Matthew Platearius, who was\r\nafterwards a great teacher at Salerno; Daniel Morley, Adelard of Bath,\r\nEgidius, otherwise known as Gilles de Corbeil; Romoaldus, Gerbert of\r\nAuvergne, who later became Pope under the name of Sylvester II; Gerard\r\nof Cremona, and the best known of them all, at least in medicine,\r\nConstantine Africanus, whose wanderings, however, were probably not\r\nlimited to Arabian lands, but who seems also to have been in Hindustan.\r\n\r\nWe are rather prone to think that this great spirit of going far afield\r\nfor knowledge's sake is recent, or, at least, quite modern. As a matter\r\nof fact, one finds it everywhere in history. Long before Herodotus did\r\nhis wanderings there were many visitors who went to Egypt, and many more\r\nlater who went to Crete, and many more a few centuries later who went to\r\nthe shores of Asia Minor seeking for the precious pearl of knowledge,\r\nand sometimes finding it without finding the even more precious pearl of\r\nwisdom, \"whose worth is from the farthest coasts.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Arabs we owe the foundation of a series of institutions for the\r\nhigher learning, like those which had existed around them in Asia Minor\r\nand in Egypt at the time they made their conquests. Alexandria,\r\nPergamos, Cos, Cnidos, Tarsus, and many other Eastern cities had had\r\nwhat we would call at least academies, and many of them deserved the\r\nname of universities. The Arabs continued the tradition in education\r\nthat they found, and established educational institutions which\r\nattracted wide attention. As we have said, the two most famous of these\r\nwere at Bagdad and at Cordova. Mostanser, the predecessor of the last\r\nCaliph of the family of the Abbassides, built a handsome palace, in\r\nwhich the academy of Bagdad was housed. It is still in existence, and\r\ngives an excellent idea of the beneficent interest of this monarch and\r\nof other of the Abbasside rulers in education. Its fate at the present\r\ntime is typical of the attitude of the Mohammedans towards education.\r\nThough the building is still standing, the institution of learning is no\r\nlonger there. As Hyrtl remarks, it is not ideas that are exchanged in it\r\nnow, but articles of commerce. It has become the chief office of the\r\nTurkish customs department in Bagdad.\r\n\r\nThese institutions of the higher learning, founded by the Arabs, at\r\nfirst as rather strict imitations of the museums or academies of Egypt\r\nand Asia Minor, gradually changed their character under the Arabs. Their\r\ncourses became much more formal, examinations became much more\r\nimportant. Scholarship was sought not so much for its own sake, as\r\nbecause it led to positions in the civil service, to the favor of\r\nprinces, and, in general, to reputation and pecuniary reward. Formal\r\ntestimonials proclaiming education, signed by the academic authorities,\r\nwere introduced and came to mean much. Lawyers could not practise\r\nwithout a license, physicians also required a license. These formalities\r\nwere adopted by the Western medieval universities to a considerable\r\ndegree and have been perpetuated in the modern time. Undoubtedly they\r\ndid much to hamper real education among the Arabs by setting in place of\r\nthe satisfaction of learning for its own sake and the commendation of\r\nteachers the formal recognition of a certain amount of work done as\r\nrecognized by the educational authorities. There was always a tendency\r\namong the Arabs to formulate and formalize, to over-systematize what\r\nthey were at; to think that new knowledge could be obtained simply by\r\nspeculating over what was already acquired, and developing it. There are\r\na number of comparisons between this and later periods of education\r\nthat might be suggested if comparisons were not odious.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Arabian medicine on modern medicine can, perhaps, best\r\nbe judged from the number of words in our modern nomenclature, which,\r\nthough bearing Latin forms, often with suggestion of Greek origins,\r\nstill are not derived from the old Latin or Greek authors, but represent\r\nArabic terms translated into Latin during the Renaissance period. Hyrtl,\r\nwithout pretence of quoting them all, gives a list of these which is\r\nsurprising in its comprehensiveness. For instance, the mediastinum, the\r\nsutura sagittalis, the scrobiculus cordis, the marsupium cordis, the\r\nchambers of the heart, the velum palati, the trochanter, the rima\r\nglottidis, the fontanelles, the alae of the nose, all have their present\r\nnames, not from original Latin expressions, but from the translation of\r\nArabic terms. For all such words the Greeks and Romans have quite other\r\nexpressions, in which the sense of our modern terms is not contained.\r\nThis has given rise to many misunderstandings, and to many attempts in\r\nthe modern times to return to the classic terminology rather than\r\npreserve what in many cases are the barbarisms introduced through the\r\nArabic, but it is doubtful whether any comprehensive reform in the\r\nmatter can be effected, so strongly entrenched in medical usage have\r\nthese terms now become.\r\n\r\nFreind, in his \"History of Medicine,\" already cited, calls attention to\r\nthe fact that the Arabs had an unfortunate tendency to change by\r\naddition or subtraction of their own views the authors that they\r\nstudied, and wished to translate to others. This seems to have been\r\ntrue even of some of the most distinguished of them. Of course, the idea\r\nof preserving an author's text untouched, and making it clear just where\r\nnote and commentary came in, had not yet come to men's view, but quite\r\napart from this the Arabs apparently often tried to gain acceptance for\r\ntheir own ideas by having them masquerade as the supposed ideas of\r\nfavorite classic authors.\r\n\r\nAnother unfortunate tendency among the Arabs was their liking for the\r\ndiscussion of many trivial questions. Hyrtl, in his volume on \"Arabian\r\nand Hebrew Words in Anatomy,\"[6] declares that it is almost incredible\r\nhow earnestly some trivial questions in anatomy and physiology were\r\ndiscussed by the Arabs. He gives some examples. Why does no hair grow on\r\nthe nose of men? Why does the stomach not lie behind the mouth? Why does\r\nthe windpipe not lie behind the esophagus? Why are the breasts not on\r\nthe abdomen? Why are not the calves on the anterior portion of the legs?\r\nEven such men as Rhazes and Avicenna discuss such questions.\r\n\r\nIt was this tendency of the Arabs that passed over to the Western\r\nEuropeans with Arabian commentaries on philosophy and science, and\r\nbrought so many similar discussions in the scholastic period. These\r\ntrivialities have usually been supposed to originate with the\r\nscholastics themselves, for they are not to be found in the Greek\r\nauthors on whom the scholastics were writing commentaries, but they are\r\ntypically Oriental in character, and it must be remembered that during\r\nthe twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, at least, Greek philosophy\r\nfound its way largely into Europe in Arab versions, and these\r\ncharacteristically Arabian additions of the discussion of curious\r\ntrivial questions came with them and produced an imitative tendency\r\namong the Europeans.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the more careful has been the study of Arabian writers in the\r\nmodern time, particularly by specialists, the clearer has it become that\r\nthey lacked nearly all originality. Especially were they faulty in their\r\nobservations; besides, they had a definite tendency to replace\r\nobservation by theory, a fatal defect in medicine. The fine development\r\nof surgery that came at the end of the Arabian period of medicine in\r\nEurope could never have come from the Arabs themselves. Gurlt has\r\nbrought this out particularly, but it will not be difficult to cite many\r\nother good authorities in support of this opinion.\r\n\r\nHyrtl, in his \"Thesis on the Rarer Old Anatomists,\"[7] says that \"the\r\nArabs paid very little attention to anatomy, and, of course, because of\r\nthe prohibition in the Koran, added nothing to it. Whatever they knew\r\nthey took from the Greeks, and especially Galen. Not only did they not\r\nadd anything new to this, but they even lost sight of much that was\r\nimportant in the older authors. The Arabs were much more interested in\r\nphysiology; they could study this by giving thought to it without\r\nsoiling their hands. They delighted in theory, rather than in\r\nobservation.\"\r\n\r\nWhile we thus discuss the lack of originality and the tendency to\r\nover-refinement among the Arabian medical writers, it must not be\r\nthought that we would make little of what they accomplished. They not\r\nonly preserved the old medical writers for us, but they kept alive\r\npractical medicine with the principles of the great Greek thinkers as\r\nits basis. There are a large number of writers of Arabian medicine whose\r\nnames have secured deservedly a high place in medical history. If this\r\nwere a formal history of Arabian medicine, their careers and works would\r\nrequire discussion. For our purpose, however, it seems better to confine\r\nattention to a few of the most prominent Arabian writers on medicine,\r\nbecause they will serve to illustrate how thoroughly practical were the\r\nArabian physicians and how many medical problems that we are prone to\r\nthink of as modern they occupied themselves with, solving them not\r\ninfrequently nearly as we do in the modern time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE MEDICAL SCHOOL AT SALERNO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Medical School at Salerno, probably organized early in the tenth\r\ncentury, often spoken of as the darkest of the centuries, and reaching\r\nits highest point of influence at the end of the twelfth century, is of\r\ngreat interest in modern times for a number of reasons. First it brought\r\nabout in the course of its development an organization of medical\r\neducation, and an establishment of standards that were to be maintained\r\nwhenever and wherever there was a true professional spirit down to our\r\nown time. They insisted on a preliminary education of three years of\r\ncollege work, on at least four years of medical training, on special\r\nstudy for specialist's work, as in surgery, and on practical training\r\nwith a physician or in a hospital before the student was allowed to\r\npractise for himself. At Salerno, too, the department of women's\r\ndiseases was given over to women professors, and we have the text-books\r\nof some of these women medical teachers. The license to practise given\r\nto women, however, seems to have been general and did not confine them\r\nmerely to the care of women and children. We have records of a number of\r\nthese licenses issued to women in the neighborhood of Salerno. This\r\nsubject of feminine medical education at Salerno, because of its special\r\ninterest in our time, will have a chapter by itself.\r\n\r\nThese are the special features of medical education in our own time\r\nthat we are rather prone to think of as originating with ourselves and\r\nas being indices of that evolution of humanity and progress in mankind\r\nwhich are culminating in our era. It is rather interesting, then, to\r\nstudy just how these developments came about and what the genesis of\r\nthis great school was. The books of its professors were widely read, not\r\nonly in their own generation but for centuries afterwards. With the\r\ninvention of printing at the time of the Renaissance most of them were\r\nprinted and exerted profound influence over the revival of medicine\r\nwhich took place at that time. Salerno became the first of the\r\nuniversities in the modern sense of the word. Here there gathered round\r\nthe medical school, first a preparatory department representing modern\r\ncollege work, and then departments of theology and law, though this\r\nlatter department particularly was never quite successful. The fact that\r\nthe first university, that of Salerno, should have been organized round\r\na medical school, the second, that of Bologna, around a law school, and\r\nthe third, that of Paris, around a school of theology and philosophy,\r\nwould seem to represent the ordinary natural process of development in\r\nhuman interests. First man is interested in himself and in his health,\r\nthen in his property, and finally in his relations to his fellow-man and\r\nto God.\r\n\r\nThough much work has been done on the subject in recent years, it is not\r\neasy to trace the origin of the medical school at Salerno. The\r\ndifficulty is emphasized by the fact that even the earliest chroniclers\r\nwhose accounts we have were not sure as to its origin, and even had\r\nsome doubt about the age of the school. Alphanus, usually designated\r\nAlphanus I because there are several of the name, who is one of the\r\nearliest professors whose name and fame have come down to us, gives us\r\nthe only definite detail as to the age of the school. He was a\r\nBenedictine monk, distinguished as a literary man, known both as poet\r\nand physician, who was afterwards raised to the Bishopric of Salerno. As\r\na bishop he was one of the beneficent patrons, to whom the school owed\r\nmuch. He lived in the tenth century, and states that medicine flourished\r\nin the town before the time of Guimarus II, who reigned in the ninth\r\ncentury. In the ancient chronicle of Salerno, re-discovered by De Renzi\r\nand published in his \"Collectio Salernitana,\" it is definitely recorded\r\nthat the medical school was founded by four doctors,--a Jewish Rabbi\r\nElinus, a Greek Pontus, a Saracen Adala, an Arab, and a native of\r\nSalerno, each of whom lectured in his native language. There are many\r\nelements in this tradition, however, that would seem to indicate its\r\nmythical origin and that it was probably invented after the event to\r\naccount for the presence of teachers in all these languages and the\r\ncoming of students from all over the world. The names, for instance, are\r\napparently corruptions of real names, as can be readily recognized.\r\nElinus, the Jew, is probably Elias or Eliseus, Adala is a corruption of\r\nAbdallah, and Pontus, as pointed out by Puschmann in his \"History of\r\nMedical Education,\" should probably be Gario-Pontus.\r\n\r\nWhile we do not know exactly when the medical school at Salerno was\r\nfounded, we know that a hospital was established there as early as 820.\r\nIt was founded by the Archdeacon Adelmus, and was placed under the\r\ncontrol of the Benedictines after it was realized that a religious\r\norder, by its organization, was best fitted for carrying on such\r\ncharitable work continuously. Other infirmaries and charitable\r\ninstitutions, mainly under control of the religious, sprang up in\r\nSalerno. It was the presence of these hospitals in a salubrious climate\r\nthat seems first to have attracted the attention of patients and then of\r\nphysicians from all over Europe and even adjacent Africa and Asia.\r\nPuschmann says that it is uncertain whether clinical instruction was\r\nimparted in these institutions or not, but the whole tenor of what we\r\nknow about the practical character of the teaching at Salerno and of the\r\nfine development of professional medicine there, would seem to argue\r\nthat probably those who came to study medicine here were brought\r\ndirectly in contact with patients.\r\n\r\nAs early as the ninth century Salerno was famous for its great\r\nphysicians. We know the names of at least two physicians, Joseph and\r\nJoshua, who practised there about the middle of the ninth century.\r\nRagenifrid, a Lombard by his name, was private physician to Prince\r\nWyamar of Salerno in the year 900. The fact that he was from North Italy\r\nindicates that already foreigners were being attracted, but more than\r\nthis that they were obtaining opportunities unhampered by any\r\nChauvinism. From early in the tenth century physicians from Salerno were\r\nfrequently brought to foreign courts to become the attending physicians\r\nto rulers. Patients of the highest distinction from all over Europe\r\nbegan to flock to Salerno, and we have the names of many of them. In\r\nthe tenth century Bishop Adalberon, when ailing, went there, though he\r\nfound no cure for his ills. Abbot Desiderius, however, the great\r\nBenedictine scholar of the time, who afterwards became Pope Victor III,\r\nregained his health at Salerno under the care of the great Constantine\r\nAfricanus, who was so much impressed by the gentle kindness and deep\r\nlearning and the example of the saintly life of his patient that not\r\nlong after he went to Monte Cassino to become a Benedictine under\r\nDesiderius, who was abbot there. Duke Guiscard sent his son Bohemund to\r\nSalerno for the cure of a wound received in battle, which had refused to\r\nheal under the ordinary surgical treatment of the time. William the\r\nConqueror, early in the eleventh century and while still only the Duke\r\nof Normandy, is said to have passed some time at Salerno for a similar\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature of the medical life at Salerno at this time\r\nis the relations between the clergy and the physicians. In the sketch of\r\nthe life of Constantine Africanus, which follows this chapter, there is\r\nsome account of the friendship between Abbot Desiderius of Monte Cassino\r\nand Constantine Africanus, and the latter's withdrawal from his\r\nprofessorship to become a Benedictine. One of the physicians of the\r\nearly tenth century who stood high in favor with Prince Gisulf was\r\nraised to the Bishopric of Salerno. This was Alphanus, whom we have\r\nalready mentioned as a chronicler, a monk, a poet, a physician, and\r\nfinally the Bishop of Salerno.\r\n\r\nThe best proof of how thorough was the medical education at Salerno and\r\nhow much influence it exerted even over public opinion is to be found in\r\nthe regulation of the practice of medicine, which soon began, and the\r\ninsistence upon proper training before permission to practise medicine\r\nwas granted. The medical school at Salerno early came to be a recognized\r\ninstitution in the kingdom of the Two Sicilies, representing a definite\r\nstandard of medical training. It is easy to understand that the\r\nattraction which Salerno possessed for patients soon also brought to the\r\nneighborhood a number of irregular physicians, travelling quacks, and\r\ncharlatans. Wealthy patients were coming from all over the world to be\r\ntreated at Salerno. Many of them doubtless were sufferers from incurable\r\ndiseases and nothing could be done for them. Often they would be quite\r\nunable to return to their homes and would be surely unwilling to give up\r\nall hope if anybody promised them anything of relief. There was a rich\r\nfield for the irregular, and of course, as always, he came. Salerno had\r\nalready shown what a good standard of medical education should be, and\r\nit is not surprising, then, that the legal authorities in this part of\r\nthe country proceeded to the enforcement of legal regulations demanding\r\nthe attainment of this standard, in order that unfit and unworthy\r\nphysicians might not practise medicine to their own benefit but to the\r\ndetriment of the patients.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, as early as the year 1140, King Ruggiero (Roger) of the Two\r\nSicilies promulgated the law: \"Whoever from this time forth desires to\r\npractise medicine must present himself before our officials and judges,\r\nand be subject to their decision. Anyone audacious enough to neglect\r\nthis shall be punished by imprisonment and confiscation of goods. This\r\ndecree has for its object the protection of the subjects of our kingdom\r\nfrom the dangers arising from the ignorance of practitioners.\"\r\n\r\nJust about a century later the Emperor Frederick II, the Hohenstaufen,\r\nin the year 1240, extended this law, emphasized it, and brought it\r\nparticularly into connection with the great medical school of the Two\r\nSicilies, of which territory he was the ruler. This law has often been\r\nproclaimed as due to his personality rather than to his times,--as\r\nrepresenting his very modern spirit and his progressive way of looking\r\nat things. There is no doubt that certain personal elements for which he\r\nshould be given due credit are contained in the law. To understand it\r\nproperly, however, one must know the law of King Roger of the preceding\r\ncentury; and then it is easy to appreciate that Frederick's regulation\r\nis only such a development of the governmental attitude toward medical\r\npractice as might have been expected during the century since Roger's\r\ntime. It has sometimes been suggested that this law made by the Emperor\r\nFrederick, who was so constantly in bitter opposition to the Papacy, was\r\nissued in despite of the Church authorities and represents a policy very\r\ndifferent from any which they would have encouraged. The early history\r\nof Salerno, even briefly as we have given it, completely contradicts any\r\nsuch idea. The history of medical regulation at the beginning of the\r\nnext century down at Montpellier moreover, where the civil authorities\r\nbeing weak the legal ordering of the practice of medicine was\r\neffectively taken up by the Church, and the authority for the issuance\r\nof licenses to practise was in the hands of the bishops of the\r\nneighborhood, shows clearly that it is not because of any knowledge of\r\nthe real medical history of the times that such remarks are made, but\r\nfrom a set purpose to discredit the Church.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Frederick's law deserves profound respect and consideration\r\nbecause of the place that it holds in the legal regulation of the\r\npractice of medicine. Anyone who thinks that evolution must have brought\r\nus in seven centuries much farther in this matter than were the people\r\nof the later Middle Ages should read this law attentively. Everyone who\r\nis interested in medical education should have a copy of it near him,\r\nbecause it will have a chastening effect in demonstrating not only how\r\nlittle we have done in the modern time rather than how much, but above\r\nall how much of decadence there was during many periods of the interval.\r\nThe law may be found in the original in \"The Popes and Science\" (Fordham\r\nUniversity Press, N.Y., 1908). Three years of preliminary university\r\neducation before the study of medicine might be taken up, four years of\r\nmedical studies proper before a degree was given, a year of practice\r\nwith a regularly licensed physician before a license to practise could\r\nbe obtained, a special course in anatomy if surgery were to be\r\npractised; all this represents an ideal we are striving after at the\r\npresent time in medical education. Besides this, Frederick's law also\r\nregulates medical fees, requires gratuitous attendance on the poor for\r\nthe privilege of practice accorded by the license, though the general\r\nfees are of a thoroughly professional character and represent for each\r\nvisit of the physician about the amount of daily wage that the ordinary\r\nlaborer of that time earned. Curiously enough, this same ratio of\r\nemolument has maintained itself. This law was also a pure drug law,\r\nregulating the practice of pharmacy, and the price as well as the purity\r\nof drugs, and the relations of physicians, druggists, and the royal drug\r\ninspectors whose business it was to see that only proper drugs were\r\nprepared and sold.\r\n\r\nAll this is so much more advanced than we could possibly have imagined,\r\nonly that the actual documents are in our possession, that most people\r\nrefuse to let themselves be persuaded in spite of the law that it could\r\nhave meant very much. Especially as regards medical education are they\r\ndubious as to conditions at this time. To them it seems that it can make\r\nvery little difference how much time was required for medical study or\r\nfor studies preliminary to medicine, since there was so little to be\r\nlearned. The age was ignorant, men knew but little, and so very little\r\ncould be imparted no matter how much time was taken.\r\n\r\nThis is, I fear, a common impression, but an utterly false one. The\r\npreliminary training that is the undergraduate work at the universities\r\nconsisted of the Seven Liberal Arts--the trivium and quadrivium, which\r\nembraced logic, rhetoric, grammar, metaphysics, under which was included\r\nnot a little of physics, cosmology in which some biology was studied, as\r\nwell as psychology and mathematics, astronomy, and music. This was a\r\nthoroughly rounded course in intellectual training. No wonder that\r\nProfessor Huxley said in his Inaugural Address as Rector of Aberdeen, \"I\r\ndoubt if the curriculum of any modern university shows so clear and\r\ngenerous a comprehension of what is meant by culture as this old trivium\r\nand quadrivium does.\" There is no doubt at all about the value of the\r\nundergraduate training, nor of the scholarship of the men who were\r\nturned out under the system, nor of their ability to concentrate their\r\nminds on difficult subjects--a faculty that we strive to cultivate in\r\nour time and do not always congratulate ourselves on securing to the\r\ndegree, at least, that we would like.\r\n\r\nAs to the medical teaching, AEgidius, often called Gilles of Corbeil, who\r\nwas a graduate of Salerno and afterward became the physician-in-ordinary\r\nto Philip Augustus, King of France, thought that he could not say too\r\nmuch for the training in medicine that was given at this first of the\r\nmedical schools. One thing is sure, the professors were eminently\r\nserious, the work taken up was in many ways thoroughly scientific, and\r\nsome of the results of the medical investigations of that early day are\r\ninteresting even now. The descriptions of diseases that we have from the\r\nSalernitan school are true to nature and are replete with many original\r\nobservations. Puschmann says: \"The accounts given of intermittent fever,\r\npneumonia, phthisis, psoriasis, lupus, which they called the malum\r\nmortuum, of ulcers on the sexual organs, among which it is easy to\r\nrecognize chancre, and of the disturbances of the mental faculties,\r\nespecially deserve mention.\" They seem to have been quite expert in\r\ntheir knowledge of phthisis. In the treatment of it they laid great\r\nstress upon the giving up of a strenuous life, the living a rather easy\r\nexistence in the open air, and a suitable diet. When the commencement of\r\nconsumption was suspected, the first prescription was a good course of\r\nstrengthening nourishment for the patient. On the other hand, they\r\ndeclared that the cases in which diarrhea supervened during consumption\r\nsoon proved fatal. In general, with regard to people who were liable to\r\nrespiratory diseases, they insisted upon life in an atmosphere of\r\nequable temperature. Though the custom was almost unheard of in the\r\nSalerno of that time, and indeed at the present time there is very\r\nlittle heating during the winter in southern Italy, they insisted that\r\npatients who were liable to pulmonary affections should have their rooms\r\nheated.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, they suggested the cooling of the air of the\r\nsick-room, as we have noted in the chapter on Constantine Africanus, and\r\nAfflacius recommended the employment of an apparatus from which water\r\ntrickled continuously in drops to the ground and then evaporated. Baths\r\nand bleeding were employed according to definite indications and diet\r\nwas always a special feature. They had a number of drugs and simples,\r\nand the employment of some of them is interesting. Iron was prescribed\r\nfor enlargement of the spleen. The internal use of sea sponge, in which\r\nof course there is a noteworthy proportion of iodine, was recommended\r\nfor relief from the symptoms of goitre by reducing its size. Iodine has\r\nbeen used so much ever since in this affection, even down to our own\r\nday, that this employment of one of its compounds is rather striking.\r\nMassage of the goitre was also recommended, and this mode of treatment\r\nwas commonly employed for a number of ailments.\r\n\r\nProbably the best idea that can be obtained in brief space of the\r\nachievements of the University of Salerno is to be found in Pagel's\r\nappreciation of Salerno's place in the history of medicine in his\r\nchapters on \"Medicine in the Middle Ages\" in Puschmann's \"Handbuch der\r\nGeschichte der Medizin\" (Berlin, 1902). He said: \"If we take up now the\r\naccomplishments of the school of Salerno in the different departments\r\nthere is one thing that is very remarkable. It is the rich independent\r\nproductivity with which Salerno advanced the banners of medical science\r\nfor hundreds of years almost as the only autochthonous centre of medical\r\ninfluence in the whole West. One might almost say that it was like a\r\n_versprengten Keim_--a displaced embryonic element--which, as it\r\nunfolded, rescued from destruction the ruined remains of Greek and Roman\r\nmedicine. This productivity of Salerno, which may well be compared in\r\nquality and quantity with that of the best periods of our science, and\r\nin which no department of medicine was left without some advance, is one\r\nof the striking phenomena of the history of medicine. While positive\r\nprogress was not made, there are many noteworthy original observations\r\nto be chronicled. It must be acknowledged that pupils and scholars set\r\nthemselves faithfully to their tasks to further as far as their strength\r\nallowed the science and art of healing. In the medical writers of the\r\nolder period of Salerno who had not yet been disturbed by Arabian\r\nculture or scholasticism, we cannot but admire the clear, charmingly\r\nsmooth, light-flowing diction, the delicate and honest setting forth of\r\ncases, the simplicity of their method of treatment, which was to a great\r\nextent dietetic and expectant, and while we admire the carefulness and\r\nyet the copiousness of their therapy, we cannot but envy them a certain\r\nausterity in their pharmaceutic formulas and an avoidance of\r\nmedicamental polypragmasia. The work in internal medicine was especially\r\ndeveloped. The contributions to it from a theoretic and a literary\r\nstandpoint, as well as from practical applications, found ardent\r\ndevotees.\"\r\n\r\nLess than this could scarcely have been expected from the medical school\r\nwhich brought such an uplift of professional dignity and advance in the\r\nstandards of medical education that are to be noticed in connection with\r\nSalerno. Registration, licensure, preliminary education, adequate\r\nprofessional studies, clinical experience under expert guidance, even\r\nspecial training for surgical work, all came in connection with this\r\ngreat medical school. Such practical progress in medical education could\r\nnot have been made but by men who faced the problems of the practice of\r\nmedicine without self-deception and solved them as far as possible by\r\ncommon-sense, natural, and rational methods.\r\n\r\nIt is usually said that at Salerno surgery occupied an inferior\r\nposition. It is true that we have less record of it in the earlier years\r\nof Salerno than we would like to see. It was somewhat handicapped by the\r\nabsence of human dissection. This very important defect was not due to\r\nany Church opposition to anatomy, as has often been said, but to the\r\nobjection that people have to seeing the bodies of their friends or\r\nacquaintances used for anatomical purposes. In the comparatively small\r\ntowns of the Middle Ages there were few strangers, and therefore very\r\nseldom were there unclaimed bodies. The difficulty was in the obtaining\r\nof dissecting material. We had the same difficulty in this country until\r\nabout two generations ago, and the only way that bodies could be\r\nobtained regularly was by \"resurrecting\" them, as it was called, from\r\ngraveyards. In the absence of human subjects, anatomy was taught at\r\nSalerno upon the pig. The principal portion of the teaching in anatomy\r\nconsisted of the demonstration of the organs in the great cavities of\r\nthe body and their relations, with some investigations of their form and\r\nthe presumed functions of the corresponding organs in man. Copho's\r\nwell-known \"Anatomy of the Pig\" was a text-book written for the students\r\nof Salerno. In spite of its limitations, it shows the beginnings of\r\nrather searching original inquiry and even some observations in\r\npathological anatomy. It is simple and straightforward and does not\r\nprofess to be other than it is, though it must be set down as the first\r\nreasonably complete contribution to comparative anatomy.\r\n\r\nWhen their surgery came to be written down, however, it gave abundant\r\nevidence of the thoroughness with which this department of medicine had\r\nbeen cultivated by the Salernitan faculty. We have the text-book of\r\nRoger, with the commentary of Rolando, and then the so-called commentary\r\nof the Four Masters. These writings were probably made rather for the\r\nmedical school at Bologna than that of Salerno, though there is no\r\ndoubt that at least Roger and Rolando received their education at\r\nSalerno and embodied in their writings the surgical traditions of that\r\nschool. While I have preferred, in order to have a connected story of\r\nsurgical development, to treat of their contributions to their specialty\r\nunder the head of the \"Great Surgeons of the Medieval Universities,\" it\r\nseems well to point out here that they must be considered as\r\nrepresenting especially the surgical teaching of the older medical\r\nschool of Salerno. There are many interesting features of the old\r\nteaching that they have embodied in their books. For instance, at\r\nSalerno both sutures and ligatures were employed in order to prevent\r\nbleeding. We are rather accustomed to think of such uses of thread, and\r\nespecially the ligature, as being much later inventions. The fact of the\r\nmatter is, however, that ligatures and sutures were reinvented over and\r\nover again and then allowed to go out of use until someone who had no\r\nidea of their dangers came to reinvent them once more.[8]\r\n\r\nMuch is often said about the place of Arabian surgery and medicine at\r\nthis time, and the influence that they had over the medical teaching and\r\nthinking of the period. To trust many of the shorter histories of\r\nmedicine the Arabs must be given credit for more of the medical thought\r\nof this time than any other medical writers or thinkers. It is\r\nforgotten, however, apparently, that in the southern part of Italy,\r\nwhere Salerno was situated, Greek influence never died out. This had\r\nbeen a Greek colony in the olden time and continued to be known for many\r\ncenturies after the Christian era as Magna Graecia. Greek medicine, then,\r\nhad more influence here than anywhere else. As a matter of fact, the\r\nbeginnings of Salernitan teaching are all Greek and not at all Arabian.\r\nThis is as true in surgery as in medicine. I have quoted Gurlt in the\r\nchapter on \"Great Surgeons of the Medieval Universities,\" insisting that\r\nthe Salernitan school owed nothing at all to Arabian surgery. Salernitan\r\nmedicine was, during the twelfth century, just as free from Arabian\r\ninfluence. When Arabian medicine makes itself felt, as pointed out by\r\nPagel in his \"Geschichte der Heilkunde im Mittelalter,\"[9] far from\r\nexerting a beneficial influence, it had a rather unfortunate effect. It\r\nled especially to an oversophistication of medicine from the standpoint\r\nof drug therapeutics. The Arabian physicians trusted nature very little.\r\nIn this they were like our forefathers of medicine one hundred years\r\nago, of whom Rush was the typical representative--so history repeats\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of Arabian medicine the Salernitan school of\r\nmedicine was noted for its common-sense methods and its devotion to all\r\nthe natural modes of healing. It looked quite as much to the prevention\r\nof disease as its treatment. Diet and air and water were always looked\r\nupon as significant therapeutic aids. With the coming of Arabian\r\ninfluence there began, says Pagel, \"as the literature of the times shows\r\nvery well, that rule of the apothecary in therapeutics which was an\r\nunfortunate exaggeration. Now all the above-mentioned complicated\r\nprescriptions came to be the order of the day. Apparently the more\r\ncomplicated a prescription the better. Dietetics especially was\r\nrelegated to the background. Salerno, at the end of the twelfth century,\r\nhad already reached its highest point of advance in medicine and was\r\nbeginning to decline. Decadence was evident in so far as all the medical\r\nworks that we have from that time are either borrowings or imitations\r\nfrom Arabian medicine with which eventually Salernitan medical\r\nliterature became confounded. Only a few independent authors are found\r\nafter this time.\" This is so very different from what is ordinarily\r\npresumed to have been the case and openly proclaimed by many historians\r\nof medicine because apparently they would prefer to attribute\r\nscientific advance to the Arabs than to the Christian scholars of the\r\ntime, that it is worth while noting it particularly.\r\n\r\nSalerno was particularly rich in its medical literary products. Very\r\noften we have not the names of the writers. Apparently there is good\r\nreason to think that a number of the professors consulted together in\r\nwriting a book, and when it was issued it was considered to be a\r\ntext-book of the Salernitan school of medicine rather than of any\r\nparticular professor. This represents a development of co-operation on\r\nthe part of colleagues in medical teaching that we are likely to think\r\nof as reserved for much later times.\r\n\r\nThe most important medical writing that comes to us from Salerno, in the\r\nsense at least of the work that has had most effect on succeeding\r\ngenerations, has been most frequently transcribed, most often translated\r\nand committed to memory by many generations of physicians, is the\r\ncelebrated Salernitan medical poem on hygiene. The title of the original\r\nLatin was \"Regimen Sanitatis Salernitanum.\" It was probably written\r\nabout the beginning of the twelfth century. A century or so later it\r\ncame to be the custom to call medical books after flowers, and so we had\r\nthe \"Lilium Medicinae\" and the \"Flos Medicinae\" down at Montpellier, and\r\nthis became the \"Flos Medicinae\" of Salerno. Pagel calls it the\r\nquintessence of Salernitan therapeutics.\r\n\r\nFor many centuries portions at least of this Latin medical poem were as\r\ncommon in the mouths of physicians all over Europe as the aphorisms of\r\nHippocrates or the sayings of Galen. Probably this enables us to\r\nunderstand the great reputation that the Salernitan school enjoyed and\r\nthe influence that it wielded better than anything else. The poem is\r\ndivided into ten principal parts, containing altogether about 3,500\r\nlines. The first part on hygiene has 855 lines in eight chapters. The\r\nsecond part on _materia medica_, though containing only four chapters,\r\nhas also about 800 lines. Anatomy and physiology are crowded into about\r\n200 lines, etiology has something over 200, semiotics has about 250,\r\npathology has but thirty lines more or less, and therapeutics about 400;\r\nnosology has about 600 more, and finally there is something about the\r\nphysician himself, and an epilogue. As Latin verses go, when written for\r\nsuch purposes, these are not so bad, though some of them would grate on\r\na literary ear. The whole work makes a rather interesting compendium of\r\nmedicine, with therapeutic indications and contra-indications, and\r\nwhatever the physician of the medieval period needed to have ready to\r\nmemory. Some of its prescriptions, both in the sense of formulae and of\r\ndirections to the patient, have quite a modern air.\r\n\r\nOne very interesting contribution to medical literature that comes to us\r\nfrom Salerno bears the title, \"The Coming of a Physician to His Patient,\r\nor An Instruction for the Physician Himself.\" We have had a number of\r\nsuch works published in recent years, but it is a little surprising to\r\nhave the subject taken up thus early in the history of modern\r\nprofessional life. It is an extremely valuable document, as\r\ndemonstrating how practical was the teaching at Salerno. The work is\r\nusually ascribed to Archimattheas, and it certainly gives a vivid\r\npicture of the medical customs of the time. The instruction for the\r\nimmediate coming of the physician to his patient runs as follows: \"When\r\nthe doctor enters the dwelling of his patient, he should not appear\r\nhaughty, nor covetous, but should greet with kindly, modest demeanor\r\nthose who are present, and then seating himself near the sick man accept\r\nthe drink which is offered him (_sic_) and praise in a few words the\r\nbeauty of the neighborhood, the situation of the house, and the\r\nwell-known generosity of the family,--if it should seem to him suitable\r\nto do so. The patient should be put at his ease before the examination\r\nbegins and the pulse should be felt deliberately and carefully. The\r\nfingers should be kept on the pulse at least until the hundredth beat in\r\norder to judge its kind and character; the friends standing round will\r\nbe all the more impressed because of the delay and the physician's words\r\nwill be received with just that much more attention.\"\r\n\r\nThe old physician evidently realized very well how much influence on the\r\npatient's mind meant for the course of the disease. For instance, he\r\nrecommends that the patient should be asked to confess and receive the\r\nsacraments of the Church before the doctor sees him, for if mention is\r\nafterwards made of this the patient may believe that it is because the\r\ndoctor thinks that there is no hope for him. For the purpose of\r\nproducing an effect upon the patient's mind, the old physician does not\r\nhesitate even to suggest the taking advantage of every possible source\r\nof information, so as to seem to know all about the case. \"On the way to\r\nsee the sick person he [the physician] should question the messenger\r\nwho has summoned him upon the circumstances and the conditions of the\r\nillness of the patient; then, if not able to make any positive diagnosis\r\nafter examining the pulse and the urine, he will at least excite the\r\npatient's astonishment by his accurate knowledge of the symptoms of the\r\ndisease and thus win his confidence.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of these preliminary instructions there is a rather\r\ndiplomatic--to say the least--bit of advice that might perhaps to a\r\npuritanic conscience seem more politic than truthful. Since the old\r\nprofessor insists so much on not disturbing the patient's mind by a bad\r\nprognosis or any hint of it, and since even some exaggeration of what he\r\nmight think to be the serious outlook of the case to friends would only\r\nlead to greater care of the patient, there is probably much more\r\njustification for his suggestion than might be thought at first glance.\r\nHe says, \"When the doctor quits the patient he should promise him that\r\nhe will get quite well again, but he should inform his friends that he\r\nis very ill; in this way, if a cure is affected, the fame of the doctor\r\nwill be so much the greater, but if the patient dies people will say\r\nthat the doctor had foreseen the fatal issue.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of the medical school of Salerno, even thus briefly and\r\nfragmentarily told, illustrates very well how old is the new in\r\neducation,--even in medical education. There is scarcely a phase of\r\nmodern interest in medical education that may not be traced very clearly\r\nat Salerno though the school began its career a thousand years ago, and\r\nceased to attract much attention over six hundred years ago. We owe\r\nmost of our knowledge of the details of its organization and teaching to\r\nDe Renzi. Without the devotion of so ardent a scholar it would have been\r\nalmost impossible for us to have attained so complete a picture of\r\nSalernitan activities. As it is, as a consequence of his work we are\r\nable to see this first of modern medical schools developing very much as\r\ndo our most modern medical schools. There has been an accumulation of\r\nmedical information in the thousand years, but the ways and modes of\r\nfacing problems and many of the solutions of them do not differ from\r\nwhat they were in the distant past. The more we know about any\r\nparticular period, the more is this brought home to us. It is for this\r\nthat study of particular periods and institutions of the olden time, as\r\nof Salerno, grows increasingly interesting, because each new detail\r\nhelps to fill in sympathetically the new-old picture of human activity\r\nas it may be seen at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nCONSTANTINE AFRICANUS\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably the most important representative of the medical school at\r\nSalerno, certainly the most significant member of its faculty, if we\r\nconsider the wide influence for centuries after his time that his\r\nwritings had, was Constantine Africanus. He is interesting, too, for\r\nmany other reasons, for he is the first representative, in modern times,\r\nthat is, who, after the incentive of antiquity had passed, devoted\r\nhimself to creating a medical literature by translations, by editions,\r\nand by the collation of his own and others' observations on medical\r\nsubjects. He is the connecting link between Arabian medicine and Western\r\nmedical studies. The fact that he was first a traveller over most of the\r\neducational world of his time, then a professor at the University of\r\nSalerno who attracted many students, and finally a Benedictine monk in\r\nthe great abbey at Monte Cassino, shows how his life ran the gamut of\r\nthe various phases of interest in the intellectual world of his time. It\r\nwas his retirement to the famous monastery that gave him the\r\nopportunity, the leisure, the reference library for consultation that a\r\nwriter feels he must have near him, and probably also the means\r\nnecessary for the publication of his works. Not only did the monks of\r\nMonte Cassino itself devote themselves to the copying of his many\r\nbooks, but other Benedictine monasteries in various parts of the world\r\nmade it a point to give wide diffusion to his writings.\r\n\r\nAs a study in successful publication, that is, in the securing of wide\r\nattention to writings within a short time, the career of Constantine and\r\nthe story of his books would be extremely interesting. Medieval\r\ndistribution of books is usually thought to have been rather halting,\r\nbut here was an exception. It was largely because Benedictines all over\r\nthe world were deeply interested in what this brother Benedictine was\r\nwriting that wide distribution was secured for his work within a very\r\nshort time. His superiors among the Benedictines had a profound interest\r\nin what he was doing. The great Benedictine Abbot Desiderius of Monte\r\nCassino, who afterwards became Pope, used all of his extensive influence\r\nin both positions to secure an audience for the books--hence the many\r\nmanuscript copies of his writings that we have. It is probable that\r\nConstantine established a school of writers at Monte Cassino, for he\r\ncould scarcely have accomplished so much by himself as has been\r\nattributed to him. Besides, his works attracted so much attention that\r\nwriters of immediately succeeding generations who wanted to secure\r\nattention for their works sometimes attributed them to him in order to\r\ntake advantage of his popularity. It is rather difficult, then, to\r\ndetermine with absolute assurance which are Constantine's genuine works.\r\nSome of those attributed to him are undoubtedly spurious. What we know\r\nwith certainty, however, is that his authentic works meant much for his\r\nown and after generations.\r\n\r\nConstantine was born in the early part of the eleventh century, and died\r\nnear its close, having lived probably well beyond eighty years of age,\r\nhis years running nearly parallel with his century. His surname,\r\nAfricanus, is derived from his having been born in Africa, his\r\nbirthplace being Carthage. Early in life he seems to have taken up with\r\nardor the study of medicine in his native town, devoting himself,\r\nhowever, at the same time to whatever of physical science was available.\r\nLike many another young man since his time, not satisfied with the\r\nknowledge he could secure at home, he made distant journeys, gathering\r\nmedical and scientific information of all kinds wherever he went.\r\nAccording to a tradition that seems to be well grounded, some of these\r\njourneys took him even into the far East. During his travels he became\r\nfamiliar with a number of Oriental languages, and especially studied the\r\nArabian literature of science very diligently.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Arabs, having the advantage of more intimate contact\r\nwith the Greek medical traditions in Asia Minor, were farther advanced\r\nin their knowledge of the medical sciences than the scholars in the\r\nWest. They had better facilities for obtaining the books that were the\r\nclassics of medicine, and, with any desire for knowledge, could scarcely\r\nfail to secure it.\r\n\r\nWhat was best in Arabian medicine was brought to Salerno by Constantine\r\nand, above all, his translation of many well-known Arabian medical\r\nauthors proved eminently suggestive to seriously investigating\r\nphysicians all over the world in his time. Before he was to be allowed\r\nto settle down to his literary work, however, Constantine was to have a\r\nvery varied experience. Some of this doubtless was to be valuable in\r\nenabling him to set the old Arabian teachers of medicine properly before\r\nhis generation. After his Oriental travels he returned to his native\r\nCarthage in order to practise medicine. It was not long, however, before\r\nhis superior medical knowledge, or, at least, the many novelties of\r\nmedical practice that he had derived from his contact with the East,\r\ndrew upon him the professional jealousy of his colleagues. It is very\r\nprobable that the reputation of his extensive travels and wide knowledge\r\nsoon attracted a large clientele. This was followed quite naturally by\r\nthe envy at least of his professional brethren. Feeling became so\r\nbitter, that even the possibility of serious personal consequences for\r\nhim because of false accusations was not out of the question. Whenever\r\nnovelties are introduced into medical science or medical practice, their\r\nauthors are likely to meet with this opposition on the part of\r\ncolleagues, and history is full of examples of it. Galvani was laughed\r\nat and called the frogs' dancing-master; Auenbrugger was made fun of for\r\ndrumming on people; Harvey is said to have lost half of his consulting\r\npractice;--all because they were advancing ideas that their\r\ncontemporaries were not ready to accept. We are rather likely to think\r\nthat this intolerant attitude of mind belongs to the older times, but it\r\nis rather easy to trace it in our own.\r\n\r\nIn Constantine's day men had ready to hand a very serious weapon that\r\nmight be used against innovators. By craftily circulated rumors the\r\npopulace was brought to accuse him of magical practices, that is, of\r\nproducing his cures by association with the devil. We are rather prone\r\nto think little of a generation that could take such nonsense seriously,\r\nbut it would not be hard to find analogous false notions prevalent at\r\nthe present time, which sometimes make life difficult, if not dangerous,\r\nfor well-meaning individuals.[10] Life seems to have been made very\r\nuncomfortable for Constantine in Carthage. Just the extent to which\r\npersecution went, however, we do not know. About this time Constantine's\r\nwork attracted the attention of Duke Robert of Salerno. He invited him\r\nto become his physician. After he had filled the position for a time a\r\npersonal friendship developed, and, as has often happened to the\r\nphysicians of kings, he became a royal counsellor and private secretary.\r\nWhen the post of professor of medicine at Salerno fell vacant, it is not\r\nsurprising, then, that Constantine should have been made professor, and\r\nfrom here his teaching soon attracted the attention of all the men of\r\nhis time.\r\n\r\nConstantine seems to have greatly enhanced the reputation of the medical\r\nschool, and added to the medical prestige of Salerno. After teaching for\r\nsome ten years there, however, he gave up his professorship--the highest\r\nposition in the medical world of the time--apparently with certain plans\r\nin mind. He wanted leisure for writing the many things in medicine that\r\nhe had learned in his travels in the East, so as to pass his precious\r\ntreasure of knowledge on to succeeding generations; and then, too, he\r\nseems to have longed for that peace that would enable him not only to do\r\nhis writing undisturbed, but to live his life quietly far away from the\r\nstrife of men and the strenuous existence of a court and of a great\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThere was probably another and more intimate personal reason for his\r\nretirement. Abbot Desiderius of the Benedictine Abbey of Monte Cassino,\r\nnot far away, had become a close and valued friend. Before having been\r\nmade abbot, Desiderius and Constantine probably were fellow professors\r\nat Salerno, for we know that Desiderius himself and many of his fellow\r\nBenedictines taught in the undergraduate department there. Desiderius\r\nenjoyed the reputation of being one of the most learned men of the time\r\nwhen his election to the abbacy at Monte Cassino took him away from\r\nSalerno. His departure was a blow to Constantine, who had learned by\r\nyears of friendship that to be near his intimate friend, the pious\r\nscholarly Benedictine, was a solace in life and a never failing\r\nincentive to his own intellectual work. Desiderius seems, indeed, to\r\nhave been a large factor in influencing the great physician to write his\r\nbooks rather than devote himself to oral teaching, since the circulation\r\nof his writing would confer so much more of benefit on a greater number\r\nof people. Perhaps another element in the situation was that Desiderius\r\nwas desirous of having the learned physician, the travelled scholar, at\r\nMonte Cassino, for the sake of his influence on the scholarship of the\r\nabbey, and for the incentive that he would be to the younger monks to\r\napply themselves to the varied field of knowledge which the Benedictines\r\nhad chosen for themselves at this time.\r\n\r\nWhatever hopes of mutual solace and helpfulness and of the joys of\r\nintimate close friendship may have been in the minds of these two most\r\nlearned men of their time, they were destined to be grievously\r\ndisappointed. Only a few years after Constantine's entrance into the\r\nmonastery at Monte Cassino Desiderius was elected Pope. The humble\r\nBenedictine did not want to take the exalted position, but it was\r\nplainly shown to him that it was his duty, and that he must not shirk\r\nit. Accordingly, under the name of Pope Victor III, he became one of the\r\ngreat Popes of the eleventh century. One might think that he could have\r\nsummoned Constantine to Rome, but perhaps he knew that his friend would\r\nprefer the quietude of the cloister, and then, too, probably he wanted\r\nto allow him the opportunity to accomplish that writing for which\r\nConstantine and himself had planned when the great physician entered the\r\nmonastery.\r\n\r\nAll that we know for sure is that some twenty years of Constantine's\r\nlife were spent as a monk in Monte Cassino, where he devoted his time\r\nmainly to the writing of his books. One bond of union there was. Each of\r\nthe works, as soon as completed, was sent off to the Pope as long as he\r\nlived. On the other hand, though busy with his Papal duties, Pope Victor\r\nconstantly stimulated Constantine, even from distant Rome, to go on with\r\nhis work. There were messages of brotherly interest and solicitude just\r\nas in the old days. The great African physician's best known work, the\r\nso-called \"Liber Pantegni,\" which is really a translation of the\r\n\"Khitaab el Maleki\" of Ali Ben el-Abbas, is dedicated to Desiderius.\r\nConstantine wrote a number of other books, most of them original, but it\r\nis difficult now to decide just which of those that pass under his name\r\nare genuine. Many were subsequently attributed to him that are surely\r\nnot his.\r\n\r\nThese translators of the Middle Ages proved to be not only the channels\r\nthrough which information came to their generations, but they were also\r\nincentives to study and investigation. It is when men can get a certain\r\namount of information rather easily that they are tempted to seek\r\nfurther in order to solve the problems that present themselves. There\r\nare three great translators whose work meant much for the Middle Ages at\r\nthis time. They were, besides Constantine in the eleventh century,\r\nGerard of Cremona, in the twelfth, and the Jewish Faradj Ben Salim, at\r\nNaples, in the thirteenth. Gerard did in Spain for the greater Arabian\r\nwriters what Constantine had accomplished for those of lesser import.\r\nUnder the patronage of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, he published\r\ntranslations of Rhazes, Isaac Judaeus, Serapion, Abulcasis, and Avicenna.\r\nHis work was done in Toledo, the city in which, during the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries, so many translators were at work making books for\r\nthe Western world.\r\n\r\nConstantine did much more than merely bring out his translations of\r\nArabian works. He gave a zest to the study of the old masters, issued\r\neditions of certain, at least, of the works of Hippocrates (\"Aphorisms\")\r\nand Galen (\"Microtechnics\"), and, in general, called attention to the\r\nprecious treasure of medical lore that must be used to advantage if men\r\nwere to teach the rising generation out of the accumulated knowledge of\r\nthe past. Pagel, in Puschmann's \"Handbook,\" does not hesitate to say\r\nthat \"a farther merit of Constantine must be recognized, inasmuch as\r\nthat not long after his career the second epoch of the school of Salerno\r\nbegins, marked not only by a wealth of writers and writings on medicine,\r\nbut, above all, because from this time on the study of Greek medicine\r\nreceived renewed encouragement through the Latin versions of the Arabian\r\nliterature. We may think as we will of the worth of these works, but\r\nthis much is sure, that in many ways they brought about a broadening and\r\nan improvement of Greek knowledge, especially from the pharmacopeia\r\nstandpoint.\"\r\n\r\nProbably the best evidence that we have for Constantine's influence on\r\nhis generation is to be found in what was accomplished by men who\r\nacknowledged with pride that he was their master, and who thought it a\r\nmark of distinction to be reckoned as his disciples.\r\n\r\nAmong these especially noteworthy is Johannes Afflacius, or Saracenus\r\n(whose surname of the Saracen probably means that he, too, came from\r\nAfrica, as his master did). He was the author of two treatises on\r\n\"Fevers and Urines,\" and the so-called \"Cures of Afflacius.\" Some of\r\nthese cures he directly attributed to Constantine. Then there is a\r\nBartholomew who wrote a \"Practica,\" or \"Manual of the Practice of\r\nMedicine,\" with the sub-title, \"Introductions to and Experiments in the\r\nMedical Practice of Hippocrates, Constantine, and the Greek Physicians.\"\r\nBartholomew represents himself as a disciple of Constantine. This\r\n\"Practica\" of Bartholomew was one of the most commonly used books of the\r\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries throughout Europe. There are manuscript\r\ncommentaries and translations, and abstracts from it not only in the\r\nLatin tongues, but especially in the Teutonic languages. Pagel refers to\r\nmanuscripts in High and Low Dutch, and even in Danish. The Middle High\r\nDutch manuscripts of this \"Practica\" of Bartholomew come mainly from the\r\nthirteenth century, and have not only a special interest because of\r\ntheir value in the history of philology, but because they are the main\r\nsources of all the later books on drugs which appeared in very large\r\nnumbers in German. They have a very great historico-literary interest,\r\nespecially for pharmacology.\r\n\r\nTo Afflacius we owe a description of a method of reducing fever that is\r\nnot only ingenious, but, in the light of our recently introduced bathing\r\nmethods for fever, is a little startling. In his book on \"Fevers and\r\nUrines,\" Afflacius suggests that when the patient's fever makes him very\r\nrestless, and especially if it is warm weather, a sort of shower bath\r\nshould be given to him. He thought that rain water was the best for this\r\npurpose, and he describes its best application as in rainy fashion,\r\n_modo pluviali_. The water should be allowed to flow down over the\r\npatient from a vessel with a number of minute perforations in the\r\nbottom. A number of the practical hints for treatment given by Afflacius\r\nhave been attributed to Constantine.\r\n\r\nConstantine's reputation has, in the opinion of some writers, been hurt\r\nby two features of his published works, as they have come to us, that we\r\nfind it difficult to understand. One of these is that his translations\r\nfrom the Arabic were made mainly not of the books of the great leaders\r\nof Arabian medicine, but from certain of the less important writers. The\r\nother is that it does not seem always to have been made clear in the\r\nmanuscripts that have come down to us, whether these writings were\r\ntranslations or original writings. Some have even gone so far as to\r\nsuggest that Constantine himself would have been quite willing to\r\nreceive the credit for these writings.\r\n\r\nAs to the first of these objections, it may be said that very probably\r\nConstantine, in his travels, had come to realize that the books of the\r\ngreat Arabian physicians, Rhazes, Abulcasis, Avicenna, and others,\r\nalready received so much attention that the best outlook for medicine\r\nwas to call particular notice to the writings of such lesser lights as\r\nAli Abbas, Isaac Judaeus, Abu Dschafer, and others of even less note.\r\nCertainly we cannot but feel that his judgment in the matter must have\r\nbeen directed by reasons that we may not be able to understand at\r\npresent, but that must have existed, for all that we know of the man\r\nproves his character as a practical, far-sighted scholar. Besides, it\r\nseems not unlikely that but for his interest in them we would not at the\r\npresent time possess the translations of these minor Arabian writers,\r\nand that would be an unfortunate gap in medical history.\r\n\r\nThe other misunderstanding with regard to Constantine refers to the fact\r\nthat it is now almost impossible to decide which are his own and which\r\nare the writings of others. It has been said that he even tried to palm\r\noff some of the writings of others as his own. This seems extremely\r\nunlikely, however, knowing all that we do about his life; and the\r\nsuspicion is founded entirely on manuscripts as we have them at the\r\npresent time, about a thousand years after he lived. What mutilations\r\nthese manuscripts underwent in the course of various copyings is hard\r\nnow to estimate. Monastic copyists might very well have left out Arabian\r\nnames, because they were mainly interested in the fact that they were\r\nproviding for their readers works that had received the approval of\r\nConstantine, and the translation of which at least had been made under\r\nhis direction. It is quite clear that he did not do all the translating\r\nhimself, and that he probably must have organized a school of medical\r\ntranslators at Monte Cassino. Then just how the various works would be\r\nlooked at is very dubious. Undoubtedly many of the translations were\r\ndone after his death, or certainly finished after his time, and at last\r\nattributed to him, because he was the moving spirit and had probably\r\nselected the books that should be translated, and made suggestions with\r\nregard to them. For all of his monks he was, as masters have ever been\r\nfor disciples, much more important, and rightly so, than those writers\r\nto whom he referred them.\r\n\r\nThe whole question of plagiarism in these medieval times, as I have\r\npointed out elsewhere, is entirely different from that of the present\r\ntime. Now a writer may consciously or unconsciously claim another\r\nwriting as his own. We have come to a time when men think much of their\r\nindividual reputations. It was no uncommon thing, however, in the Middle\r\nAges, and even later in the Renaissance, for a writer to attribute what\r\nhe had written to some distinguished literary man of the preceding time,\r\nand sign that writer's name to his own work. The idea of the later\r\nauthor was to secure an audience for his thoughts. He seemed to be quite\r\nindifferent whether people ever knew just who the writer was, but he\r\nwanted to influence humanity by his writings. He thought much more of\r\nthis than of any possible reputation that might come to him. Of course,\r\nthere was no question of money. There never has been any question of\r\nmoney-making whenever the things written have been really worth while.\r\nLiterature that has deeply influenced mankind has never paid.\r\nPublications that have paid are insignificant works that have touched\r\nsuperficially a whole lot of people. To think of Constantine as a\r\nplagiarist in our modern sense of the word, as trying to take the credit\r\nfor someone else's writings, is to misunderstand entirely the times in\r\nwhich he lived, and to ignore the real problem of plagiarism at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWith the accumulation of information with regard to the history of\r\nmedicine in his time, Constantine's reputation has been constantly\r\nenhanced. It is not so long since he was considered scarcely more than a\r\nmonkish chronicler, who happened to have taken medicine rather than\r\nhistory for his field of work. Gradually we have come to appreciate all\r\nthat he did for the medicine of his time. Undoubtedly his extensive\r\ntravels, his wide knowledge, and then his years of effort to make\r\nOriental medicine available for the Western civilization that was\r\nspringing up again among the peoples who had come to replace the Romans,\r\nset him among the great intellectual forces of the Middle Ages. Salerno\r\nowed much to him, and it must not be forgotten that Salerno was the\r\nfirst university of modern times, and, above all, the first medical\r\nschool that raised the dignity of the medical profession, established\r\nstandards of medical education, educated the public mind and the rulers\r\nof the time to the realization of the necessity for the regulation of\r\nthe practice of medicine, and in many ways anticipated our modern\r\nprofessional life. That the better part of his life work should have\r\nbeen done as a Benedictine only serves to emphasize the place that the\r\nreligious had in the preservation and the development of culture and of\r\neducation during the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nMEDIEVAL WOMEN PHYSICIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nVery probably the most interesting chapter for us of the modern time in\r\nthe history of the medical school at Salerno is to be found in the\r\nopportunities provided for the medical education of women and the\r\nsurrender to them of a whole department in the medical school, that of\r\nWomen's Diseases. While it is probable that Salerno did not owe its\r\norigin to the Benedictines, and it is even possible that there was some\r\nmedical teaching there for all the centuries of the Middle Ages from the\r\nGreek times, for it must not be forgotten that this part of Italy was\r\nsettled by Greeks, and was often called Magna Graecia, there is no doubt\r\nat all that the Benedictines exercised great influence in the counsels\r\nof the school, and that many of the teachers were Benedictines, as were\r\nalso the Archbishops, who were its best patrons, and the great Pope\r\nVictor III, who did much for it. For several centuries the Benedictines\r\nrepresented the most potent influence at Salerno.\r\n\r\nFor most people who are not intimately familiar with monastic life, and,\r\nabove all, with the story of the Benedictines, their prestige at Salerno\r\nmight seem to be enough of itself to preclude all possibility of the\r\neducation of women in medicine at Salerno. For those who know the\r\nBenedictines well, however, such a departure as the accordance of\r\nopportunities for women to study medicine would seem eminently in\r\nkeeping with the practical wisdom of their rules and the development of\r\ntheir work. From the beginning the Benedictines recognized that a\r\nmonastic career should be open to women as well as to men, and\r\nBenedict's sister, Scholastica, established convents for them, as her\r\nbrother did the Benedictine monasteries, thus providing a vocation for\r\nwomen who did not feel called upon to marry. That the members of the\r\norder should recognize the advisability of affording women the\r\nopportunity to study medicine, and of handing over to them the\r\ndepartment of women's diseases in a medical school in which they had a\r\nconsiderable amount of authority, seems, then, indeed, only what might\r\nhave been expected of them.\r\n\r\nWe are prone in the modern time to think that our generation is the\r\nfirst to offer to women any facilities or opportunities for education in\r\nmedicine. We are prone, however, just in the same way, to consider that\r\na number of things that we are doing are now being done for the first\r\ntime. As a matter of fact, it is extremely difficult to find any\r\nimportant movement or occupation that is not merely a repetition of a\r\nprevious interest of mankind. The whole question of feminine education\r\nwe are apt to think of as modern, forgetting that Plato insisted in his\r\n\"Republic,\" as absolutely as any modern feminist, that women should have\r\nthe same opportunities for education as men, and that at Rome, at the\r\nend of the Republic and the beginning of the Empire, the women occupied\r\nvery much the same position in social life as our own at the present\r\ntime. Their husbands supplied the funds, and they patronized the\r\nartists, gave receptions to the poets, lionized the musicians, and, in\r\ngeneral, \"went after culture\" in a way that is a startling reminder of\r\nwhat we are familiar with in our own time. Just as soon as Christianity\r\nbegan to influence education, women were given abundant opportunities\r\nfor higher education in all forms. In Ireland, the first nation\r\ncompletely converted to Christianity,--where, therefore, the national\r\npolicy in education could be shaped by the Church without\r\nhindrance,--St. Brigid's school at Kildare was scarcely less famous than\r\nSt. Patrick's at Armagh. It had several thousand students, and, to a\r\ncertain extent at least, co-education existed. In Charlemagne's time,\r\nwith the revival of education on the Continent, the women of the\r\nImperial Court attended the Palace School, as well as the men. In the\r\nthirteenth century we find women professors in every branch at Italian\r\nuniversities. Some of them were at least assistants in anatomy. The\r\nRenaissance women were, of course, profoundly educated. In a word, we\r\nhave many phases of feminine education, though with intervals of\r\nabsolutely negative interest, down the centuries.\r\n\r\nThere had evidently been quite a considerable amount of opportunity, if\r\nnot of actual encouragement, for women in medicine, both among the\r\nGreeks and the Romans, in the early centuries of the Christian era.\r\nGalen, for instance, quotes certain prescriptions from women physicians.\r\nOne Cleopatra is said to have written a book on cosmetics. This name\r\ncame afterwards to be confounded with that of Queen Cleopatra, giving\r\nnew prestige to the book, but neither Galen nor Aetius, the early\r\nChristian physician, both of whom quote from her work, speak of her as\r\nanything except a medical writer. Some monuments to women physicians\r\nfrom these old times have escaped the tooth of time. There was the tomb\r\nof one Basila, and also of a Thecla, both of whom are said to have been\r\nphysicians. Two other names of Greek women physicians we have, Origenia\r\nand Aspasia, the former mentioned by Galen, the latter by Aetius in his\r\n\"Tetrabiblion.\" Daremberg, the medical historian, announced in 1851 that\r\nhe had found a Greek manuscript with the title, \"On Women's Diseases,\"\r\nwritten by one Metrodora, a woman physician. He promised to publish it.\r\nIt was unpublished at the time of his death, but could not be found\r\namong his papers. There is a manuscript on medical subjects, bearing\r\nthis name, mentioned in the catalogue of the Greek Codices of the\r\nLaurentian Library at Florence, but this is said to give no indication\r\nof the time when its author lived. We have evidence enough, however, to\r\nshow that Greek women physicians were not very rare.\r\n\r\nThe Romans imitated the Greeks so faithfully--one might almost say\r\ncopied them so closely--that it is not surprising to find a number of\r\nRoman women physicians. The first mention of them comes from Scribonius\r\nLargus, in the first century after Christ. Octavius Horatianus, whom\r\nmost of us know better as Priscian, dedicated one of his books on\r\nmedicine to a woman physician named Victoria. The dedication leaves no\r\ndoubt that she was a woman in active practice, at least in women's\r\ndiseases, and it is a book on this subject that Priscian dedicates to\r\nher. He mentions another woman physician, Leoparda. The word _medica_\r\nfor a woman physician was very commonly used at Rome. Martial, whose\r\nepigrams have been a source of so much information in medical history,\r\nespecially on subjects with regard to which information was scanty,\r\nmentions a _medica_ in an epigram. Apuleius also uses the word. There\r\nare a number of inscriptions in which women physicians are mentioned.\r\nAmong the Christians we find women physicians, and Theodosia, the mother\r\nof St. Procopius, the martyr, is said to have been very successful in\r\nthe practice of both medicine and surgery. She is numbered among the\r\nmartyrs, and occurs in the Roman Martyrology on the 29th of May. Father\r\nBzowski, the Polish Jesuit, who compiled \"Nomenclatura Sanctorum\r\nProfessione Medicorum\" (Rome, 1621; the book is usually catalogued under\r\nthe Latin form of his name, Bzovius), has among his list of saints who\r\nwere physicians by profession a woman, St. Nicerata, who lived at\r\nConstantinople in the reign of the Emperor Arcadius, and who is said to\r\nhave cured St. John Chrysostom of a serious disease.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the department of women's diseases at Salerno, under\r\nthe care of women professors, and the granting of licenses to women to\r\npractise medicine, is not so surprising in the light of this tradition\r\namong Greeks and Romans, taken up with some enthusiasm by the\r\nChristians. We are not sure just when this development took place. The\r\nfirst definite evidence with regard to it comes in the life of Trotula,\r\nwho seems to have been the head of the department. Some of her books are\r\nwell known, and often quoted from, and she contributed to a symposium on\r\nthe treatment of disease, in which there are contributions, also, from\r\nmen professors of Salerno at the time. She seems to have flourished\r\nabout the middle of the eleventh century. Ordericus Vitalis, a monk of\r\nUtica, who wrote an ecclesiastical history, tells of one Rudolph\r\nMalcorona, who, in 1059, came to Utica and remained there for a long\r\ntime with Father Robert, his nephew. \"This Rudolph had been a student\r\nall his life, devoting himself with great zeal to letters, and had\r\nbecome famous for his visits to the schools of France and Italy, in\r\norder to gather there the secrets of learning. As a consequence he was\r\nwell informed not only in grammar and dialectics, but also in astronomy\r\nand in music. He also possessed such an extensive knowledge of the\r\nnatural sciences that in the town of Salerno, where, since ancient\r\ntimes, the best schools of medicine had existed, there was no one to\r\nequal him with the exception of a very wise matron.\"\r\n\r\nThis wise matron has been identified with Trotula, many of the details\r\nof whose life have been brought to light by De Renzi, in his \"Story of\r\nthe School of Salerno.\"[11] According to very old tradition, Trotula\r\nbelonged to the family of Ruggiero. This was a noble family of Salerno,\r\nmany of the members of which were distinguished in their native town at\r\nleast, but the name is not unusual in Italy, as readers of Dante and\r\nBoccaccio are likely to know. It was, indeed, as common as our own\r\nRogers, of which it is the Italian equivalent.\r\n\r\nDe Renzi has made out a rather good case for the tradition that Trotula\r\nwas the wife of John Platearius I--so called because there were probably\r\nthree professors of that name. Trotula was, according to this, the\r\nmother of the second Platearius, and the grandmother of the third, all\r\nof them distinguished members of the faculty at Salerno.\r\n\r\nHer reputation extended far beyond her native town, and even Italy\r\nitself, and, in later centuries, her name was used to dignify any form\r\nof treatment for women's diseases that was being exploited. Rutebeuf,\r\none of the _trouveres_, thirteenth-century French poets, has a\r\ndescription of the scene in which one of the old herbalist doctors who\r\nused to go round and collect a crowd by means of songs and music, and\r\nthen talk medicine to them--just as is done even yet in many of the\r\nsmaller towns of this country--is represented as saying to the crowd\r\nwhen he wants to make them realize that he is no ordinary quacksalver,\r\nthat he is one of the disciples of the great Madame Trot of Salerno. The\r\nold-fashioned speech runs somewhat as follows: \"Charming people: I am\r\nnot one of these poor preachers, nor the poor herbalists, who carry\r\nlittle boxes and sachets, and who spread out before them a carpet. I am\r\nthe disciple of a great lady, who bears the name of Madame Trot of\r\nSalerno. And I would have you know that she is the wisest woman in all\r\nthe four quarters of the world.\"\r\n\r\nTwo books are attributed to Trotula; one bears the title, \"De\r\nPassionibus Mulierum,\" and the other has been called \"Trotula Minor,\" or\r\n\"Summula Secundum Trotulam,\" and is a compendium of what she wrote. This\r\nis probably due to some disciple, but seems to have existed almost in\r\nher own time. Her most important work bears two sub-titles, \"Trotula's\r\nUnique Book for the Curing of Diseases of Women, Before, During, and\r\nAfter Labor,\" and the other sub-title, \"Trotula's Wonderful Book of\r\nExperience (_experimentalis_) in the Diseases of Women, Before, During,\r\nand After Labor, with Other Details Likewise Relating to Labor.\"\r\n\r\nThe book begins with a prologue on the nature of man and of woman, and\r\nan explanation of how the author, taking pity on the sufferings of\r\nwomen, came to devote herself to the study of their diseases. There are\r\nmany interesting details in the book, all the more interesting because\r\nin many ways they anticipate modern solutions of difficult problems in\r\nwomen's diseases, and the care of the mother and child before, during,\r\nand after labor. For instance, there are a series of rules on the choice\r\nof the nurse, and on the diet and the regime which she should follow if\r\nthe child is to be properly nourished without disturbance.\r\n\r\nProbably the most striking passage in her book is that with regard to a\r\ntorn perineum and its repair. This passage may be found in De Renzi or\r\nin Gurlt. It runs as follows: \"Certain patients, from the severity of\r\nthe labor, run into a rupture of the genitalia. In some even the vulva\r\nand anus become one foramen, having the same course. As a consequence,\r\nprolapse of the uterus occurs, and it becomes indurated. In order to\r\nrelieve this condition, we apply to the uterus warm wine in which butter\r\nhas been boiled, and these fomentations are continued until the uterus\r\nbecomes soft, and then it is gently replaced. After this the tear\r\nbetween the anus and vulva we sew in three or four places with silk\r\nthread. The woman should then be placed in bed, with the feet elevated,\r\nand must retain that position, even for eating and drinking, and all the\r\nnecessities of life, for eight or nine days. During this time, also,\r\nthere must be no bathing, and care must be taken to avoid everything\r\nthat might cause coughing, and all indigestible materials.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a passage, also, almost more interesting with regard to\r\nprophylaxis of rupture of the perineum. She says, \"In order to avoid the\r\naforesaid danger, careful provision should be made, and precautions\r\nshould be taken during labor somewhat as follows: A cloth should be\r\nfolded in somewhat oblong shape, and placed on the anus, so that, during\r\nevery effort for the expulsion of the child, that should be pressed\r\nfirmly, in order that there may not be any solution of the continuity of\r\ntissue.\"\r\n\r\nHer book contains, also, some directions for various cosmetics. How many\r\nof these are original, however, is difficult to say. Trotula's name had\r\nbecome a word to conjure with, and many a quack in the after time tried\r\nto make capital for his remedies in this line by attributing them to\r\nTrotula. As a consequence, many of these remedies gradually found their\r\nway into the manuscript copies of her book, and subsequent copyists\r\nincorporated them into the text, until it became practically impossible\r\nto determine which were original. There are manuscripts of Trotula's\r\nwork in Florence, Vienna, and Breslau. Some of these contain chapters\r\nnot in the others, undoubtedly added by subsequent hands. In one of\r\nthese, that at Florence, from which the edition of Strasburg was printed\r\nin 1544, and of Venice, 1547, one of the Aldine issues, there is a\r\nmention in the last chapter of spectacles. We have no record of these\r\nuntil the end of the thirteenth century, when this passage was probably\r\nadded. It was also printed at Basle, 1566, and at Leipzig as late as\r\n1778, which would serve to show how much attention it has attracted even\r\nin comparatively recent times.\r\n\r\nAfter Trotula we have a number of women physicians of Salerno whose\r\nnames have come down to us. The best known of these bear the names\r\nConstanza, Calendula, Abella, Mercuriade, Rebecca Guarna, who belonged\r\nto the old Salernitan family of that name, a member of which, in the\r\ntwelfth century, was Romuald, priest, physician, and historian, Louise\r\nTrencapilli, and others. The titles of some of their books, as those of\r\nMercuriade, who occupied herself with surgery as well as medicine, and\r\nwho is said to have written on \"Crises,\" on \"Pestilent Fever,\" on \"The\r\nCure of Wounds,\" and of Abella, who acquired a great reputation with her\r\nwork on \"Black Bile,\" and on the \"Nature of Seminal Fluid,\" have come\r\ndown to us. Rebecca Guarna wrote on \"Fevers,\" on the \"Urine,\" and on the\r\n\"Embryo.\" The school of Salernitan women came to have a definite place\r\nin medical literature.\r\n\r\nWhile, as teachers, they had charge of the department of women's\r\ndiseases, their writings would seem to indicate that they studied all\r\nbranches of medicine. Besides, there are a number of licenses preserved\r\nin the archives of Naples in which women are accorded the privilege of\r\npractising medicine. Apparently these licenses were without limitation.\r\nIn many of these mention is made of the fact that it seems especially\r\nfitting that women should be allowed to practise in women's diseases,\r\nsince they are by constitution likely to know more and to have more\r\nsympathy with feminine ills. The formula employed as the preamble of\r\nthis license ran as follows: \"Since, then, the law permits women to\r\nexercise the profession of physicians, and since, besides, due regard\r\nbeing had to purity of morals, women are better suited for the treatment\r\nof women's diseases, after having received the oath of fidelity, we\r\npermit, etc.\"\r\n\r\nSalerno continued to enjoy a reputation for training women physicians\r\nthoroughly, until well on in the fifteenth century, for we have the\r\nrecord of Constance Calenda, the daughter of Salvator Calenda, who had\r\nbeen dean of the faculty of medicine at Salerno about 1415, and\r\nafterwards dean of the faculty at Naples. His daughter, under the\r\ndiligent instruction of her father, seems to have obtained special\r\nhonors for her medical examination. Not long after this, Salerno itself\r\nlost all the prestige that it had. The Kings of Naples endeavored to\r\ncreate a great university in their city in the thirteenth century. They\r\ndid not succeed to the extent that they hoped, but the neighboring rival\r\ninstitution hurt Salerno very much, and its downfall may be traced from\r\nthis time. Gradually its reputation waned, and we have practically no\r\nmedical writer of distinction there at the end of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, though the old custom of opportunities for women students of\r\nmedicine was maintained.\r\n\r\nThis custom seems also to have been transferred to Naples, and licenses\r\nto practise were issued to woman graduates of Naples. This never\r\nachieved anything like the reputation in this department that had been\r\nattained at Salerno. Salerno influenced Bologna and the north Italian\r\nuniversities profoundly in all branches of medicine and medical\r\neducation, particularly in surgery, as can be seen in the chapter on\r\n\"Great Surgeons of the Medieval Universities,\" and the practice of\r\nallowing such women as wished to study medicine to enter the university\r\nmedical schools is exemplified in the case of Mondino's assistant in\r\nanatomy, Alessandra Giliani, though there are also others whose names\r\nhave come down to us.\r\n\r\nThe University of Salerno had developed round a medical school. It was\r\nthe first of the universities, and, in connection with its medical\r\nschool, feminine education obtained a strong foothold. It is not\r\nsurprising, then, that with the further development of universities in\r\nItaly, feminine education came to be the rule. This rule has maintained\r\nitself all down the centuries in Italy, so that there has not been a\r\nsingle century since the twelfth in which there have not been one or\r\nmore distinguished women teachers at the Italian universities.\r\nUniversity life gradually spread westward, and Paris came into existence\r\nas an organized institution of learning after Bologna, and, doubtless,\r\nwith some of the traditions of Salerno in the minds of its founders.\r\nFeminine education, however, did not spread to the West. This is a\r\nlittle bit difficult to understand, considering the reverence that the\r\nTeutonic peoples have always had for their women folk and the privileges\r\naccorded them. A single unfortunate incident, that of Abelard and\r\nHeloise, seems to have been sufficient to discourage efforts in the\r\ndirection of opportunities for feminine education in connection with the\r\nWestern universities. Perhaps, in the less sophisticated countries of\r\nthe North and West of Europe, women did not so ardently desire\r\neducational opportunities as in Italy, for whenever they have really\r\nwanted them, as, indeed, anything else, they have always obtained them.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the absence of formal opportunities for feminine education\r\nin medicine at the Western universities, a certain amount of scientific\r\nknowledge of diseases, as well as valuable practical training in the\r\ncare of the ailing, was not wanting for women outside of Italy. The\r\nmedical knowledge of the women of northern France and Germany and\r\nEngland, however, though it did not receive the stamp of a formal degree\r\nfrom the university and the distinction of a license to practise, was\r\nnone the less thorough and extensive. It came in connection with certain\r\noffices in their own communities, held by members of religious orders.\r\nGenuine information with regard to what the religious were doing during\r\nthe Middle Ages was so much obscured by the tradition of laziness and\r\nimmorality, created at the time of the so-called reformation in order\r\nto justify the confiscation of their property by those whose one object\r\nwas to enrich themselves, that we have only come to know the reality of\r\ntheir life and accomplishments in comparatively recent years. We now\r\nknow that, besides being the home of most of the book knowledge of the\r\nearlier Middle Ages, the monasteries were the constant patrons of such\r\npractical subjects as architecture, agriculture in all its phases,\r\nespecially irrigation, draining, and the improvement of land and crops;\r\nof art, and even what we now know as physical science. Above all, they\r\npreserved for us the old medical books and carried on medical traditions\r\nof practice. The greatest surprise has been to find that this was true\r\nnot only for the monks, but also for the nuns.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important books on medicine that has come to us from the\r\ntwelfth century is that of a Benedictine abbess, since known as St.\r\nHildegarde, whose life was spent in the Rhineland. Her works serve to\r\nshow very well that in the convents of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth\r\ncenturies there was much more of interest in things intellectual than we\r\nhave had any idea of until recent years, and that, indeed, one of the\r\nimportant occupations of convent life was the serious study of books of\r\nall kinds, some of them even scientific, as well as the writing of works\r\nin all departments. The century before St. Hildegarde there is the\r\nrecord of Hroswitha, who wrote a series of dramas in imitation of\r\nTerence, that were meant to replace, for the monks and nuns of that\r\nperiod, the reading of that rather too human author. Hroswitha, like\r\nHildegarde, was a German, and we have the record, also, of another\r\nreligious writer, abbess of the Odilian Cloister, at Hohenberg, who\r\nwrote a book called \"Hortus Deliciarum, the Garden of Delights,\" a book\r\nof information on many subjects not unlike our popular encyclopedias of\r\nthe modern time, the title of which shows that the place of information\r\nin life was considered to be the giving of pleasure. While this work\r\ndeals mainly with Biblical and theological and mystical questions, there\r\nare many purely scientific passages and many subjects of strictly\r\nmedical interest treated.\r\n\r\nThe life of the Abbess Hildegarde is worthy of consideration, because it\r\nillustrates the period and makes it very clear that, in spite of the\r\ngrievous misunderstanding of their life and work, so common in the\r\nmodern time, these old-time religious had most of the interests of the\r\nmodern time, and pursued them with even more than modern zeal and\r\nsuccess, very often. Her career illustrates very well what the\r\nfoundation of the Benedictines had done for women. When St. Benedict\r\nfounded his order for men, his sister, Scholastica, wanted to do a\r\nsimilar work for women. We know that the Benedictine monks saved the old\r\nclassics for us, kept burning the light of the intellectual life, and\r\ngave a refuge to men who wanted to devote themselves in leisure and\r\npeace to the things of the spirit, whether of this world or the other.\r\nWe have known much less of the Benedictine nuns until now the study of\r\ntheir books shows that they provided exactly the same opportunities for\r\nwomen and furnished a vocation, a home, an occupation of mind, and a\r\nsatisfaction of spirit for the women who, in every generation, do not\r\nfeel themselves called to be wives and mothers, but who want to live\r\ntheir lives for others rather than for themselves and their kin, seeking\r\nsuch development of mind and of spirit as may come with the leisure and\r\npeace of celibacy.\r\n\r\nHildegarde was born of noble parents at Boeckelheim, in the county of\r\nSponheim, about the end of the eleventh century (probably 1098). In her\r\neighth year she went for her education to the Benedictine cloister of\r\nDisibodenberg. When her education was finished, she entered the\r\ncloister, of which, at the age of about fifty, she became abbess. Her\r\nwritings, reputation for sanctity, and her wise saintly rule attracted\r\nso many new members to the community that the convent became\r\novercrowded. Accordingly, with eighteen of her nuns, Hildegarde withdrew\r\nto a new convent at Rupertsberg, which English and American travellers\r\nwill remember because it is not far from Bingen on the Rhine. Here she\r\ncame to be a centre of attraction for most of the world of her time. She\r\nwas in active correspondence with nearly every important man of her\r\ngeneration. She was an intimate friend of Bernard of Clairvaux, who was\r\nhimself, perhaps, the most influential man in Europe in this century.\r\nShe was in correspondence with four Popes, and with the Emperors Conrad\r\nand Frederick I, and with many distinguished archbishops, abbots, and\r\nabbesses, and teachers and teaching bodies of various kinds. These\r\ncorrespondences were usually begun by her correspondents, who consulted\r\nher because her advice in difficult problems was considered so valuable.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this time-taking correspondence, she found leisure to\r\nwrite a series of books, most of them on mystical subjects, but two of\r\nthem on medical subjects. The first is called \"Liber Simplicis\r\nMedicinae,\" and the second \"Liber Compositae Medicinae.\" These books were\r\nwritten in order to provide information mainly for the nuns who had\r\ncharge of the infirmaries of the monasteries of the Benedictines. Almost\r\nconstantly someone in the large communities, which always contained aged\r\nreligious, was ailing, and then, besides, there were other calls on the\r\ntime and the skill of the sister infirmarians. There were no hotels at\r\nthat time, and no hospitals, except in the large cities. There were\r\nalways guest houses in connection with monasteries and convents, in\r\nwhich travellers were permitted to pass the night, and given what they\r\nneeded to eat. There are many people who have had experiences of\r\nmonastic hospitality even in our own time. Sometimes travellers fell\r\nill. Not infrequently the reason for travelling was to find health in\r\nsome distant and fabulously health-giving resort, or at the hands of\r\nsome wonder-working physician. Such high hopes are nearly always set at\r\na distance. This of itself must have given not a little additional need\r\nfor knowledge of medicine to the infirmarians of convents and\r\nmonasteries. There were around many of the monasteries, moreover, large\r\nestates; often they had been cleared and made valuable by the work of\r\npreceding generations of monks, and on these estates peasants came to\r\nlive. Workingmen and workingwomen from neighboring districts came to\r\nhelp at harvest time, and, after a chance meeting, were married and\r\nsettled down on a little plot of ground provided for them near the\r\nmonastery. As these communities grew up, they looked to the monasteries\r\nand convents for aid of all kinds, and turned to them particularly in\r\ntimes of illness. The need for definite instruction in medicine on the\r\npart of a great many of the monks and nuns can be readily understood,\r\nand it was this need that Hildegarde tried to meet in her books. The\r\nfirst of her books that we have mentioned, the \"Liber Simplicis\r\nMedicinae,\" attracted attention rather early in the Renaissance, and was\r\ndeemed worthy of print. It was edited at the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury by Dr. Schott at Strasburg, under the title, \"Physica S.\r\nHildegardis.\" Another manuscript of this part was found in the library\r\nof Wolfenbuttel, in 1858, by Dr. Jessen. This gave him an interest in\r\nHildegarde's contributions to medicine, and, in 1859, he noted in the\r\nlibrary at Copenhagen a manuscript with the title \"Hildegardi Curae et\r\nCausae.\" On examination, he was sure that it was the \"Liber Compositae\r\nMedicinae\" of the saint. The first work consists of nine books, treating\r\nof plants, elements, trees, stones, fishes, birds, quadrupeds, reptiles,\r\nand metals, and is printed in Migne's \"Patrologia,\" under the title\r\n\"Subtilitatum Diversarum Naturarum Libri Novem.\" The second, in five\r\nbooks, treats of the general diseases of created things, of the human\r\nbody and its ailments, of the causes, symptoms, and treatment of\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nIt would be very easy to think that these are small volumes and that\r\nthey contain very little. We are so apt to think of old-fashioned\r\nso-called books as scarcely more than chapters, that it may be\r\ninteresting to give some idea of the contents and extent of the first of\r\nthese works. The first book on Plants has 230 chapters, the second on\r\nthe Elements has 13 chapters, the third on Trees has 36 chapters, the\r\nfourth on various kinds of Minerals, including precious stones, has 226\r\nchapters, the fifth on Fishes has 36 chapters, the sixth on Birds has 68\r\nchapters, the seventh on Quadrupeds has 43 chapters, the eighth on\r\nReptiles has 18 chapters, the ninth on Metals has 8 chapters. Each\r\nchapter begins with a description of the species in question, and then\r\ndefines its value for man and its therapeutic significance. Modern\r\nscientists have not hesitated to declare that the descriptions abound in\r\nobservations worthy of a scientific inquiring spirit. We are, of course,\r\nnot absolutely sure that all the contents of the books come from\r\nHildegarde. Subsequent students often made notes in these manuscript\r\nbooks, and then other copyists copied these into the texts.\r\nUnfortunately we have not a number of codices to collate and correct\r\nsuch errors. Most of what Hildegarde wrote comes to us in a single copy,\r\nof none are there more than four copies, showing how near we came to\r\nmissing all knowledge of her entirely.\r\n\r\nDr. Melanie Lipinska, in her \"Histoire des Femmes Medecins,\" a thesis\r\npresented for the doctorate in medicine at the University of Paris in\r\n1900, subsequently awarded a special prize by the French Academy,\r\nreviews Hildegarde's work critically from the medical standpoint. She\r\nsays that the saint distinguishes a double mode of action of different\r\nsubstances, one chemical, the other physical, or what we would very\r\nprobably call magnetic. She discusses all the ailments of the various\r\norgans, the brain, the eyes, the teeth, the heart, the spleen, the\r\nstomach, the liver. She has special chapters on redness and paleness of\r\nthe face, on asthma, on cough, on fetid breath, on bilious indigestion,\r\non gout. Besides, she has other chapters on nervous affections, on\r\nicterus, on fevers, on intestinal worms, on infections due to swamp\r\nexhalations, on dysentery, and a number of forms of pulmonary diseases.\r\nNearly all of our methods of diagnosis are to be found, hinted at at\r\nleast, in her book. She discusses the redness of the blood as a sign of\r\nhealth, the characteristics of various excrementitious material as signs\r\nof disease, the degrees of fever, and the changes in the pulse. Of\r\ncourse, it was changes in the humors of the body that constituted the\r\nmain causes for disease in her opinion, but it is well to remind\r\nourselves that our frequent discussion of auto-intoxication in recent\r\nyears is a distinct return to this.\r\n\r\nSome of Hildegarde's anticipations of modern ideas are, indeed,\r\nsurprising enough. For instance, in talking about the stars and\r\ndescribing their course through the firmament, she makes use of a\r\ncomparison that is rather startling. She says: \"Just as the blood moves\r\nin the veins which causes them to vibrate and pulsate, so the stars\r\nmove in the firmament and send out sparks as it were of light like the\r\nvibrations of the veins.\" This is, of course, not an anticipation of the\r\ndiscovery of the circulation of the blood, but it shows how close were\r\nmen's ideas to some such thought five centuries before Harvey's\r\ndiscovery. For Hildegarde the brain was the regulator of all the vital\r\nqualities, the centre of life. She connects the nerves in their passage\r\nfrom the brain and the spinal cord through the body with manifestations\r\nof life. She has a series of chapters with regard to psychology normal\r\nand morbid. She talks about frenzy, insanity, despair, dread, obsession,\r\nanger, idiocy, and innocency. She says very strongly in one place that\r\n\"when headache and migraine and vertigo attack a patient simultaneously\r\nthey render a man foolish and upset his reason. This makes many people\r\nthink that he is possessed of a demon, but that is not true.\" These are\r\nthe exact words of the saint as quoted in Mlle. Lipinska's thesis.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that Mlle. Lipinska thinks St. Hildegarde the most\r\nimportant medical writer of her time. Reuss, the editor of the edition\r\nof Hildegarde published in Migne's \"Patrology,\" says: \"Among all the\r\nsaintly religious who have practised medicine or written about it in the\r\nMiddle Ages, the most important is without any doubt St. Hildegarde....\"\r\nWith regard to her book he says: \"All those who wish to write the\r\nhistory of the medical and natural sciences must read this work in which\r\nthis religious woman, evidently well grounded in all that was known at\r\nthat time in the secrets of nature, discusses and examines carefully\r\nall the knowledge of the time.\" He adds, \"It is certain that St.\r\nHildegarde knew many things that were unknown to the physicians of her\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nWhen such books were read and widely copied, it shows that there was an\r\ninterest in practical and scientific medicine among women in Germany\r\nmuch greater than is usually thought to have existed at this time. Such\r\nwriters, though geniuses, and standing above their contemporaries,\r\nusually represent the spirit of their times and make it clear that\r\ndefinite knowledge of things medical was considered of value. The\r\nconvents and monasteries of this time are often thought of by those who\r\nknow least about them as little interested in anything except their own\r\nease and certain superstitious practices. As a matter of fact, they\r\ncared for their estates, and especially for the peasantry on them, they\r\nprovided lodging and food for travellers, they took care of the ailing\r\nof their neighborhood, and, besides, occupied themselves with many\r\nphases of the intellectual life. It was a well-known tradition that\r\ncountry people who lived in the neighborhood of convents and\r\nmonasteries, and especially those who had monks and nuns for their\r\nlandlords, were much happier and were much better taken care of than the\r\ntenantry of other estates. For this a cultivation of medical knowledge\r\nwas necessary in certain, at least, of the members of the religious\r\norders, and such books as Hildegarde's are the evidence that not only\r\nthe knowledge existed, but that it was collected and written down, and\r\nwidely disseminated.\r\n\r\nNicaise, in the introduction to his edition of Guy de Chauliac's\r\n\"Grande Chirurgie,\" reviews briefly the history of women in medicine,\r\nand concludes:\r\n\r\n     \"Women continued to practise medicine in Italy for centuries,\r\n     and the names of some who attained great renown have been\r\n     preserved for us. Their works are still quoted from in the\r\n     fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n     \"There was none of them in France who became distinguished,\r\n     but women could practise medicine in certain towns at least on\r\n     condition of passing an examination before regularly appointed\r\n     masters. An edict of 1311, at the same time that it interdicts\r\n     unauthorized women from practising surgery, recognizes their\r\n     right to practise the art if they have undergone an\r\n     examination before the regularly appointed master surgeons of\r\n     the corporation of Paris. An edict of King John, April, 1352,\r\n     contains the same expressions as the previous edict. Du\r\n     Bouley, in his 'History of the University of Paris,' gives\r\n     another edict by the same King, also published in the year\r\n     1352, as a result of the complaints of the faculties at Paris,\r\n     in which there is also question of women physicians. This\r\n     responded to the petition: 'Having heard the petition of the\r\n     Dean and the Masters of the Faculty of Medicine at the\r\n     University of Paris, who declare that there are very many of\r\n     both sexes, some of the women with legal title to practise and\r\n     some of them merely old pretenders to a knowledge of medicine,\r\n     who come to Paris in order to practise, be it enacted,' etc.\r\n     (The edict then proceeds to repeat the terms of previous\r\n     legislation in this matter.)\r\n\r\n     \"Guy de Chauliac speaks also of women who practised surgery.\r\n     They formed the fifth and last class of operators in his time.\r\n     He complains that they are accustomed to too great an extent\r\n     to give over patients suffering from all kinds of maladies to\r\n     the will of Heaven, founding their practice on the maxim 'The\r\n     Lord has given as he has pleased; the Lord will take away when\r\n     he pleases; may the name of the Lord be blessed.'\r\n\r\n     \"In the sixteenth century, according to Pasquier, the practice\r\n     of medicine by women almost entirely disappeared. The number\r\n     of women physicians becomes more and more rare in the\r\n     following centuries just in proportion as we approach our own\r\n     time. Pasquier says that we find a certain number of them\r\n     anxious for knowledge and with a special penchant for the\r\n     study of the natural sciences and even of medicine, but very\r\n     few of them take up practice.\"\r\n\r\nJust how the lack of interest in medical education for women gradually\r\ndeepened, until there was almost a negative phase of it, only a few\r\nwomen in Italy devoting themselves to medicine, is hard to say. It is\r\none of the mysteries of the vicissitudes of human affairs that ups and\r\ndowns of interest in things practical as well as intellectual keep\r\nconstantly occurring. The number of discoveries and inventions in\r\nmedicine and surgery that we have neglected until they were forgotten,\r\nand then had to make again, is so well illustrated in chapters of this\r\nbook, that I need only recall them here in general. It may seem a little\r\nharder to understand that so important a manifestation of interest in\r\nhuman affairs as the education and licensure of women physicians should\r\nnot only cease, but pass entirely out of men's memory, yet such\r\napparently was the case. It would not be hard to illustrate, as I have\r\nshown in \"Cycles of Feminine Education and Influence\" in \"Education, How\r\nOld the New\" (Fordham University Press, 1910), that corresponding ups\r\nand downs of interest may be traced in the history of feminine education\r\nof every kind. In that chapter I have discussed the possible reasons for\r\nthese vicissitudes, which have no place here, but I may refer those who\r\nare interested in the subject to that treatment of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nMONDINO AND THE MEDICAL SCHOOL OF BOLOGNA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important contributions to medical science made by the Medical\r\nSchool of Salerno at the height of its development were in surgery. The\r\ntext-books written by men trained in her halls or inspired by her\r\nteachers were to influence many succeeding generations of surgeons for\r\ncenturies. Salerno's greatest legacy to Bologna was the group of\r\ndistinguished surgical teachers whose text-books we have reviewed in the\r\nchapter, \"Great Surgeons of the Medieval Universities.\" Bologna herself\r\nwas to win a place in medical history, however, mainly in connection\r\nwith anatomy, and it was in this department that she was to provide\r\nincentive especially for her sister universities of north Italy, though\r\nalso for Western Europe generally. The first manual of dissection, that\r\nis, the first handy volume giving explicit directions for the dissection\r\nof human cadavers, was written at Bologna. This was scattered in\r\nthousands of copies in manuscript all over the medical world of the\r\nfourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. Even after the invention of\r\nprinting, many editions of it were printed. Down to the sixteenth\r\ncentury it continued to be the most used text-book of anatomy, as well\r\nas manual of dissection, which students of every university had in hand\r\nwhen they made their dissection, or wished to prepare for making it, or\r\ndesired to review it after the body had been taken away, for with lack\r\nof proper preservative preparation, bodies had to be removed in a\r\ncomparatively short time. Probably no man more influenced the medical\r\nteaching of the fourteenth and fifteen centuries than Mundinus, or, as\r\nhe was called in the Italian fashion, Mondino, who wrote this manual of\r\ndissection.\r\n\r\n_Mundinus quem omnis studentium universitas colit ut deum_ (Mundinus,\r\nwhom all the world of students cultivated as a god), is the expression\r\nby which the German scholar who edited, about 1500, the Leipzig edition\r\nof Mundinus' well-known manual, the _Anathomia_, introduces it to his\r\nreaders. The expression is well worth noting, because it shows what was\r\nstill the reputation of Mundinus in the medical educational world nearly\r\ntwo centuries after his death.[12]\r\n\r\nUntil the time of Vesalius, whose influence was exerted about the middle\r\nof the sixteenth century, Mondino was looked up to by all teachers as\r\nthe most important contributor to the science of anatomy in European\r\nmedicine since the Greeks. He owed his reputation to two things: his\r\nbook, of which we have already spoken, and then, the fact that he\r\nreintroduced dissection demonstrations as a regular practice in the\r\nmedical schools. His book is really a manual of making anatomical\r\npreparations for demonstration purposes. These demonstrations had to be\r\nhurried, owing to the rapid decomposition of material consequent upon\r\nthe lack of preservatives. The various chapters were prepared with the\r\nidea of supplying explicit directions and practical help during the\r\nanatomical demonstrations, so that these might be made as speedily as\r\npossible. The book does not comprise much that was new at that time, but\r\nit is a good compendium of previous knowledge, and contains some\r\noriginal observations. It was entirely owing to its form as a handy\r\nmanual of anatomical knowledge and, besides, because it was an incentive\r\nto the practice of human dissection, that it attained and maintained its\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\nMondino followed Galen, of course, and so did every other teacher in\r\nmedicine and its allied sciences, until Vesalius' time. Even Vesalius\r\npermitted himself to be influenced overmuch by Galen at points where we\r\nwonder that he did not make his observations for himself, since,\r\napparently, they were so obvious. The more we know of Galen, however,\r\nthe less surprised are we at his hold over the minds of men. Only those\r\nwho are ignorant of Galen's immense knowledge, his practical common\r\nsense, and the frequent marvellous anticipations of what we think most\r\nmodern, affect to despise him. His works have never been translated\r\ninto any modern language except piecemeal, there is no complete\r\ntranslation, and one must be ready to delve into some large Latin, if\r\nnot Greek, volumes to know what a marvel of medical knowledge he was,\r\nand how wise were the men who followed him closely, though, being human,\r\nthere are times when necessarily he failed them.\r\n\r\nFor those who know even a little at first hand of Galen, it is only what\r\nmight be expected, then, that Mondino, trying to break away from the\r\nanatomy of the pig, which had been before this the basis of all\r\nanatomical teaching in the medical schools (Copho's book, used at\r\nSalerno and Bologna before Mondino's was founded on dissections of the\r\npig), should have clung somewhat too closely to this old Greek teacher\r\nand Greek master. The incentive furnished by Mondino's book helped to\r\nbreak the tradition of Galen's unquestioned authority. Besides this, the\r\ngroup of men around Mondino, his master, Taddeo Alderotti, with his\r\ndisciples and assistants, form the initial chapter in the history of the\r\nmedical school of Bologna, which gradually assumed the place of Salerno\r\nat this time. There is no better way of getting a definite idea of what\r\nwas being done in medicine, and how it was being done, than by knowing\r\nsome of the details of the life of this group of medical workers.\r\n\r\nMondino di Liucci, or Luzzi, is usually said to have been born about\r\n1275. His first name is a diminutive for Raimondo. It used to be said of\r\nhim that, like many of the great men of history, many cities claimed to\r\nbe his birthplace. Five were particularly mentioned--Florence, Milan,\r\nBologna, Forli, and Friuli. There is, however, another Mondino, a\r\ndistinguished physician, who was born and lived at Friuli, and it is\r\nbecause of confusion with him that the claim for Friuli has been set up.\r\nFlorence and Milan are considered out of the question. Mondino was\r\nprobably born in or near Bologna. The fact that there should have been\r\nthis multiple set of claims shows how much was thought of him. Indeed,\r\nhis was the best known name in the medical schools of Europe for nearly\r\ntwo centuries and a half. He seems to have been a particularly brilliant\r\nstudent, for tradition records that he had obtained his degree of doctor\r\nof medicine when he was scarcely more than twenty. This seems quite out\r\nof the question for us at the present time, but we have taken to pushing\r\nback the time of graduation, and it is not sure whether this is, beyond\r\nperadventure, so beneficial as is usually thought.\r\n\r\nThat his early graduation did not hamper his intellectual development,\r\nthe fact that, in 1306, when he was about thirty-one years of age, he\r\nwas offered the professorial chair in anatomy, which he continued to\r\noccupy with such distinction for the next twenty years, would seem to\r\nprove. His public dissections of human bodies, probably the first thus\r\nregularly made, attracted widespread attention, and students came to him\r\nnot only from all over Italy, but also from Europe generally. In this,\r\nafter all, Mondino was only continuing the tradition of world teaching\r\nthat Bologna had acquired under her great surgeons in the preceding\r\ncentury. (See \"Great Surgeons of the Medieval Universities.\")\r\n\r\nMondino came from a family that had already distinguished itself in\r\nmedicine at Bologna. His uncle was a professor of physic at the\r\nuniversity. His father, Albizzo di Luzzi, seems to have come from\r\nFlorence not long after the middle of the thirteenth century, for the\r\nrecords show that, about 1270, he formed a partnership with one\r\nBartolommeo Raineri for the establishment of a pharmacy at Bologna.\r\nLater this passed entirely under the control of the Mondino family, and\r\ncame to be known as the Spezieria del Mondino. In it were sold, besides\r\nEastern perfumes, spices, condiments, probably all sorts of toilet\r\narticles, and even rugs and silks and feminine ornaments. The stricter\r\npharmacy of the earlier times developed into a sort of department store,\r\nsomething like our own. The Mondini, however, insisted always on the\r\npharmacy feature as a specialty, and the fact was made patent to the\r\ngeneral public by a sign with the picture of a doctor on it. This drug\r\nshop of the Mondini continued to be maintained as such, according to Dr.\r\nPilcher, until the beginning of the nineteenth century.[13]\r\n\r\nOne of the fellow students of Mondino at the University of Bologna had\r\nbeen Mondeville. He came from distant France to take a course in surgery\r\nwith Theodoric, whose high reputation in the olden time, vague with us\r\nhalf a century ago, is now amply justified by what we know of him from\r\nsuch ardent students and admirers as Pagel and Nicaise. Not long after\r\nMondino's death, Guy de Chauliac came from France to reap similar\r\nopportunities to these, which had proved so fruitful for Mondeville. The\r\nmore that we learn about this time the more do we find to make it clear\r\nhow deeply interested the generation was in education in every form,\r\nartistic, philosophic, but, also, though this is often not realized,\r\nscientific.\r\n\r\nThe long distances, so much longer in that time than in ours, to which\r\nmen were willing, and even anxious, to go, in order to obtain\r\nopportunities for research, and to get in touch with a special master,\r\nthe associations with stimulating fellow pupils of other lands, the\r\nscientific correspondences, almost necessarily initiated by such\r\ncircumstances, all indicate an enthusiasm for knowledge such as we have\r\nnot been accustomed to attribute to this period. On the contrary, we\r\nhave been rather inclined to think them neglectful of all education, and\r\nhave, above all, listened acquiescently while men deprecated the lack of\r\ninterest in things scientific displayed by these generations. Indeed,\r\nmany writers have gone out of their way to find a reason for the\r\nsupposed lack of interest in science at this time, and have proclaimed\r\nthe Church's opposition to scientific education and study as the cause.\r\n\r\nAt this time Italy was the home of the graduate teaching for all Europe.\r\nThe Italian Peninsula continued to be the foster-mother of the higher\r\neducation in letters and art, but also, though this is less generally\r\nknown, in science, for the next five centuries. Germany has come to be\r\nthe place of pilgrimage for those who want higher opportunities in\r\nscience than can be afforded in their own country only during the latter\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century. France occupied it during the first half\r\nof the nineteenth century. Except for short intervals, when political\r\ntroubles disturbed Italy, as about the middle of the fourteenth century,\r\nwhen the removal of the Popes to Avignon brought their influence for\r\neducation over to France and a short period at the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century, when the Netherlands for a time came into\r\neducational prominence, Italy has always been the European Mecca for\r\nadvanced students. Practically all our great discoverers in medicine,\r\nuntil the last century, were either Italians, or else had studied in\r\nItaly. Mondino, Bertrucci, Salicet, Lanfranc, Baverius, Berengarius,\r\nJohn De Vigo, who first wrote on gun-shot wounds; John of Arcoli, first\r\nto mention gold filling and other anticipations of modern dentistry;\r\nVarolius, Eustachius, Caesalpinus, Columbus, Malpighi, Lancisi, Morgagni,\r\nSpallanzani, Galvani, Volta, were all Italians. Mondeville, Guy de\r\nChauliac, Linacre, Vesalius, Harvey, Steno, and many others who might be\r\nnamed, all studied in Italy, and secured their best opportunities to do\r\ntheir great work there.\r\n\r\nIt would be amusing, if it were not amazing, to have serious writers of\r\nhistory in the light of this plain story of graduate teaching of science\r\nin Italy for over five centuries, write about the opposition of the\r\nChurch to science during the Medieval and Renaissance periods. It is\r\nparticularly surprising to have them talk of Church opposition to the\r\nmedical sciences. The universities of the world all had their charters\r\nfrom the Popes at this time, and were all ruled by ecclesiastics, and\r\nmost of the students and practically all of the professors down to the\r\nend of the sixteenth century belonged to the clerical order. The\r\nuniversities of Italy were all more directly under the control of\r\necclesiastical authority than anywhere else, and nearly all of them were\r\ndominated by papal influence. Bologna, while doing much of the best\r\ngraduate work in science, especially in medicine, was, in the Papal\r\nStates, absolutely under the rule of the Popes. The university was,\r\npractically, a department of the Papal government. The medical school at\r\nthe University of Rome itself was for several centuries, at the end of\r\nthe Middle Ages, the teaching-place where were assembled the pick of the\r\ngreat medical investigators, who, having reached distinction by their\r\ndiscoveries elsewhere, were summoned to Rome in order to add prestige to\r\nthe Papal University. All of them became special friends of the Popes,\r\ndedicated their books to them, and evidently looked to them as\r\nbeneficent patrons and hearty encouragers of original scientific\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nWhile this is so strikingly true of medical science as to make contrary\r\ndeclarations in the matter utterly ridiculous, and to suggest at once\r\nthat there must be some motive for seeing things so different to the\r\nreality, the same story can be told of graduate science in other\r\ndepartments. It was to Italy that men came for special higher studies\r\nin mathematics and astronomy, in botany, in mineralogy, and in applied\r\nchemistry, so far as it related to the arts of painting, illuminating,\r\nstained-glass making, and the like. No student of science felt that he\r\nhad quite exhausted the opportunities for study that were possible for\r\nhim until he had been down in Italy for some time. To meet the great\r\nprofessors in Italy was looked on as sure to be a source of special\r\nincentive in any department of science. This is coming to be generally\r\nrecognized just in proportion as our own interest in the arts and\r\ncrafts, and in the history of science, leads us to go carefully into the\r\ndetails of these subjects at first hand. The editors of the \"Cambridge\r\nModern History,\" in their preface, declared ten years ago that we can no\r\nlonger accept with confidence the declaration of any secondary writer on\r\nhistory. This is particularly true of the medieval period. We must go\r\nback to the writers of those times.\r\n\r\nIf it seems surprising that the University of Bologna should have come\r\ninto such great prominence as an institute for higher education at this\r\ntime, it would be well to recall some of the great work that is being\r\ndone in this part of Italy in other departments at this time. Cimabue\r\nlaid the foundation of modern art towards the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and during Mondino's life Giotto, his pupil, raised an artistic\r\nstructure that is the admiration of all generations of artists since.\r\nDante's years are almost exactly contemporary with those of Giotto and\r\nof Mondino. If men were doing such wondrous work in literature and in\r\nart, why should not the same generation produce a man who will\r\naccomplish for the practical science of medicine what his friends and\r\ncontemporaries had done in other great intellectual departments.\r\n\r\nIn recent years we have come to think much more of environment as an\r\ninfluence in human development and accomplishment than was the custom\r\nsometime ago. The broader general environment in Italy, with genius at\r\nwork in other departments, was certainly enough to arouse in younger\r\nminds all their powers of original work. The narrower environment at\r\nBologna itself was quite as stimulating, for a great clinical teacher,\r\nTaddeo Alderotti, had come, in 1260, from Florence to Bologna, to take\r\nup there the practice and teaching of medicine. It was under him that\r\nMondino was to be trained for his life work.\r\n\r\nTo understand the place of Mondino, and of the medical school of\r\nBologna, in his time, and the reputation that came to them as world\r\nteachers of medicine, we must know, first, this great teacher of Mondino\r\nand the atmosphere of progressive medicine that enveloped the university\r\nin the latter half of the thirteenth century. In the chapter on \"Great\r\nSurgeons of the Medieval Universities\" we call particular attention to\r\nthe series of distinguished men, the first four of whom were educated at\r\nSalerno, and who came to Bologna to teach surgery. They were doing the\r\nbest surgery in the world, much better than was done in many centuries\r\nafter their time; indeed, probably better than at any period down to our\r\nown day. Besides, they seem to have been magnetic teachers who attracted\r\nand inspired pupils. We have the surgical contributions of a series of\r\nmen, written at Bologna, that serve to show what fine work was\r\naccomplished. At this time, however, the field of medicine was not\r\nneglected, though we have but a single great historical name in it that\r\nhas lived. This was Taddeo Alderotti, a man who lifted the medical\r\nprofession as high in the estimation of his fellow citizens at Florence\r\nas the great painters and literary men of his time did their\r\ndepartments, and who then moved to Bologna, because of the opportunity\r\nto teach afforded him by the university.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes a little difficult for casual students of the time to\r\nunderstand the marvellous reputation acquired by this medieval\r\nphysician. It should not be, however, when we recall the enthusiastic\r\nreception and procession of welcome accorded to Cimabue's Madonna, and\r\nthe almost universal acclaim of the greatness of Dante's work, even in\r\nhis own time. In something of that same spirit Bologna came to\r\nappreciate Taddeo, as he is familiarly known, looked upon him as a\r\nbenefactor of the community, and voted to relieve him of the burden of\r\npaying taxes. He came to be considered as a public institution, whose\r\npresence was a blessing to his fellow citizens, and whose goodness to\r\nthem should be recognized in this public way. One is not surprised to\r\nhear Villani, the well-known contemporary historian, speak of him as the\r\ngreatest physician in Christendom.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of the citizens of Bologna, it may well be confessed, were\r\nnot entirely unselfish, or due solely to the desire to encourage a great\r\nscientific genius. Few men of his generation had done more for the city\r\nin a material way quite apart from whatever benefits he conferred upon\r\nthe health of its citizens than Dr. Taddeo. It was he who organized\r\nmedical teaching in the city on such a plane that it attracted students\r\nfrom all over the world. Bologna had had a great law school before this,\r\nfounded by Irnerius, to which students had come from all over the world.\r\nWith the advent of Taddeo from Florence, and his success as a medical\r\npractitioner, there began to flock to his lectures many students who\r\nspread his fame far and wide. The city council could scarcely do less\r\nthan grant the same privileges to the medical students and teachers of\r\nTaddeo's school as they had previously accorded to the faculty of law\r\nand its students. The city council recognized quite as clearly as any\r\nboard of aldermen in the modern time how much, even of material benefit,\r\na great university was to the building up of a city, though their\r\nmotives were probably much higher than that, and their enlightened\r\npolicy had its reward in the rapid growth of Bologna until, very\r\nprobably at the end of the thirteenth century, it had more students than\r\nany university of the modern time. The number was not less than fifteen\r\nthousand, and may have been twenty thousand.\r\n\r\nTo this great university success Taddeo and his medical school\r\ncontributed not a little. The especially attractive feature of his\r\nteaching seems to have been its eminent practicalness. He himself had\r\nmade an immense success of the practice of medicine, and accumulated a\r\ngreat fortune, so much so that Dante, in his \"Paradiso,\" when he wishes\r\nto find a figure that would represent exactly the opposite to what St.\r\nDominic, the founder of the Dominicans, did for the love of wisdom and\r\nhumanity, he takes that of Taddeo, who had accomplished so much for\r\npersonal reputation and wealth.\r\n\r\nThis might easily lead to the impression that Taddeo's teaching was\r\nunscientific, or merely empiric, or that he himself was a narrow-minded\r\nmaker of money, intent only on his immediate influence, and hampered by\r\nexclusive devotion to practical medicine. Nothing could be farther from\r\nthe truth than any such impression. Taddeo was not only the head of a\r\ngreat medical school, a great teacher whom his students almost\r\nworshipped, a physician to whom patients flocked because of his\r\nmarvellous success, a fine citizen of a great city, whom his fellow\r\ncitizens honored, but he was a broad-minded scholar, a philosopher, and\r\neven an author in branches apart from medicine.\r\n\r\nIn that older time it was the custom to combine the study of philosophy\r\nand medicine. For centuries after that period in Italy it was the custom\r\nfor men to take both degrees, the doctorate in philosophy and in\r\nmedicine at the same time. Indeed, most of those whose work has made\r\nthem famous, down to and including Galvani, did so. Taddeo wrote\r\ncommentaries on the works of Hippocrates and Galen, but he also\r\ntranslated the ethics of Aristotle, and did much to make the learning of\r\nthe Arabs easily available for his students. His was a broad, liberal\r\nscholarship. Dr. Lewis Pilcher, in his article on \"The Mondino\r\nMyth,\"[14] does not hesitate to say that \"to the spirit which, from his\r\nprofessorial chair, Taddeo infused into the teaching and study of\r\nmedicine undoubtedly is due the high position which for many generations\r\nthereafter the school of Bologna continued to maintain as a centre of\r\nmedical teaching.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, erudition had its revenge, and carried Taddeo too far. The\r\ndifficult thing in human nature is to stay in the mean and avoid\r\nexaggeration. His methods of illustrating medical truths from many\r\nliterary and philosophical sources often caused the kernel of\r\nobservation to be hidden beneath a blanket of speculation or, at least,\r\nto be concealed to a great extent. Even the Germans, who have insisted\r\nmost on this unfortunate tendency of Taddeo, have been compelled to\r\nconfess that there is much that is valuable in what he accomplished, and\r\nthat even his modes of expression were not without a certain vivacity\r\nwhich attracted attention and doubtless added materially to his success\r\nas a teacher. Pagel, in Puschmann's \"Handbuch,\" says: \"It cannot be\r\ndenied [this is just after he has quoted a passage of Taddeo with regard\r\nto dreams] that Taddeo's expressions have a certain liveliness all their\r\nown that gives us some idea why he was looked upon as so good a teacher,\r\na teacher who, as we know now, also gave instruction by the bedside of\r\npatients.\" Pagel adds, \"Taddeo's greatest merit and his highest\r\nsignificance in medical education consist in the fact that a great many\r\n(_zahlreiche_) physicians followed directly in his footsteps and were\r\ncounted as his pupils. They were all men, as we know them, who as\r\nwriters and practitioners of medicine succeeded in going far beyond the\r\nlevel of mediocrity in what they accomplished.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the teacher who most influenced young Mondino when he came to\r\nthe University of Bologna, for it seems not unlikely that as a medical\r\nstudent he was actually the pupil of Taddeo, then in a vigorous old age.\r\nIf not, he was at least brought under the direct influence of the\r\nteaching tradition created during more than thirty years by that\r\nwonderful old man. Knowing what we do of Taddeo it is not surprising\r\nthat his pupil should have accomplished work that was to influence\r\nsucceeding generations more than any other of that wonderful thirteenth\r\ncentury. Dr. Pilcher in the article on \"The Mondino Myth,\" so often\r\nplaced under contribution in this sketch, says that \"It needs no great\r\nstretch of the imagination to picture somewhat of the effect that\r\ncontact with such a man as Taddeo di Alderotto[15] might have, in\r\nmolding the character of his young neighbor and pupil, the chemist's\r\nson, who a few years later, by his devotion to the study of human\r\nanatomy, was to re-establish the practical pursuit of study on the\r\nhuman cadaver as the common privilege of the skilled physician, and was\r\nto engrave his own name deeply on the records of medicine.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this worthy compatriot and contemporary of the great Florentines,\r\nMondino was inspired to be the teacher that did so much for Bologna.\r\nUntil recent years it has usually been the custom to give too much\r\nsignificance to the work of the men whose names stand out most\r\nprominently in the early history of departments of the intellectual\r\nlife. Mondino's reputation has shared in this exaggerative tendency to\r\nsome extent, hence the necessity for realizing what was accomplished\r\nbefore his time and the fact that he only stands as the culmination of a\r\nprogressive period. Carlyle spoke of Dante as the man in whom \"ten\r\nsilent centuries found a voice.\" The centuries, however, were only\r\nsilent because the moderns did not know how to listen to their message.\r\nWe know now that every country in Europe had a great contributor to\r\nliterature in the century before Dante. The Cid, the Arthur Legends, the\r\nNibelungen, the Troubadours, naturally led up to Dante. He was only the\r\nculmination of a great period of literature. We know now that men had\r\nworked in art before Cimabue and Giotto, and had done impressive work\r\nthat made for the progress of art. These names, however, have come to\r\nrepresent in many minds the sort of solitary phenomena that Dante has\r\nseemed sometimes even to scholars.\r\n\r\nBecause Mondino did such good work in medical teaching it is sometimes\r\ndeclared, even in rather serious histories, that he was the first to\r\naccomplish anything in his department, and that before his time there is\r\na blank. Some historians, for instance, have insisted that Mondino was\r\nthe first to do human dissections, and that he did at most but two or\r\nthree. Only those who are unacquainted with the magnificent development\r\nof surgery that took place during the preceding century, the evidence\r\nfor which is so abundantly given in modern historians of medicine and\r\nespecially in Gurlt's great work on the history of surgery, from which\r\nwe have quoted enough to give a good idea of the extent to which the\r\nmovement went, are likely to accept any such declaration. There could\r\nnot have been all that successful surgery without much dissection not\r\nonly of animals but also of human bodies. The teaching of dissection was\r\nnot regularly organized until Mondino's time, but it seems very clear\r\nthat even he must have dissected many more bodies than the number\r\nusually attributed to him. Professor Lewis Stephen Pilcher of Brooklyn,\r\nwho made a special study of Mondino traditions in Bologna itself, and\r\ncollected some of the early editions of his books, feels so acutely the\r\nabsurdity of the ordinarily accepted tradition in this matter, that he\r\nhas written a paper on the subject bearing the suggestive title, \"The\r\nMondino Myth.\" He says:[16]\r\n\r\n     \"We are accustomed to think of the practice of dissection as\r\n     having been re-created by Mondino, and at once fully\r\n     developed, springing into acceptance. The year 1315 is the\r\n     generally accepted date for the first public anatomical\r\n     demonstration upon a human body made by Mondino, and yet it is\r\n     true that among the laws promulgated by Frederick II, more\r\n     than seventy-five years before (A.D. 1231), was included a\r\n     decree that a human body should be dissected at Salernum at\r\n     least once in five years in the presence of the assembled\r\n     physicians and surgeons of the kingdom, and that in the\r\n     regulations established for admission to the practice of\r\n     medicine and surgery in the kingdom it was decreed that no\r\n     surgeon should be admitted to practise unless he should bring\r\n     testimonials from the masters teaching in the medical faculty,\r\n     that he was 'learned in the anatomy of human bodies, and had\r\n     become perfect in that part of medicine without which neither\r\n     incisions could safely be made nor fractures cured.'\r\n\r\n     \"Salernum was notable in its legalization of the dissection of\r\n     human bodies before the first public work of Mondino, for,\r\n     according to a document of the Maggiore Consiglio of Venice of\r\n     1308, it appears that there was a college of medicine at\r\n     Venice which was even then authorized to dissect a body every\r\n     year. Common experience tells us that the embodiment of such\r\n     regulations into formal law would occur only after a\r\n     considerable preceding period of discussion, and in this\r\n     particular field of clandestine practice. It is too much to\r\n     ask us to believe that in all this period, from the date of\r\n     the promulgation of Frederick's decree of 1231 to the first\r\n     public demonstration by Mondino, at Bologna in 1315, the\r\n     decree had been a dead letter and no human body had been\r\n     anatomized. It is true there is not, as far as I am aware, any\r\n     record of any such work, and commentators and historians of a\r\n     later date have, without exception, accepted the view that\r\n     none was done, and thereby heightened the halo assigned to\r\n     Mondino as the one who ushered in a new era. Such a view seems\r\n     to me to be incredible. Be that as it may, it is undeniable\r\n     that at the beginning of the 14th century the idea of\r\n     dissecting the human body was not a novel one; the importance\r\n     of a knowledge of the intimate structure of the body had\r\n     already been appreciated by divers ruling bodies, and specific\r\n     regulations prescribing its practice had been enacted. It is\r\n     more reasonable to believe that in the era immediately\r\n     preceding that of Mondino human bodies were being opened and\r\n     after a fashion anatomized. All that we know of the work of\r\n     Mondino suggests that it was not a new enterprise in which he\r\n     was a pioneer, but rather that he brought to an old practice a\r\n     new enthusiasm and better methods, which, caught on the rising\r\n     wave of interest in medical teaching at Bologna, and preserved\r\n     by his own energy as a writer in the first original systematic\r\n     treatise written since the time of Galen, created for him in\r\n     subsequent uncritical times the reputation of being the\r\n     Restorer of the practice of anatomizing the human body, the\r\n     first one to demonstrate and teach such knowledge since the\r\n     time of the Ptolemaic anatomists, Erasistratus and Herophilus.\r\n\r\n     \"The changes have been rung by medical historians upon a\r\n     casual reference in Mondino's chapter on the uterus to the\r\n     bodies of two women and one sow which he had dissected, as if\r\n     these were the first and the only cadavers dissected by him.\r\n     The context involves no such construction. He is enforcing a\r\n     statement that the size of the uterus may vary, and to\r\n     illustrate it remarks that 'a woman whom I anatomized in the\r\n     month of January last year, viz., 1315 Anno Christi, had a\r\n     larger uterus than one whom I anatomized in the month of March\r\n     of the same year.' And further, he says that 'the uterus of a\r\n     sow which I dissected in 1316 (the year in which he was\r\n     writing) was a hundred times greater than any I have seen in\r\n     the human female, for she was pregnant and contained thirteen\r\n     pigs.' These happen to be the only reference to specific\r\n     bodies that he makes in his treatise. But it is a far cry to\r\n     wring out of these references the conclusion that these are\r\n     the only dissections he made. It is quite true that if we\r\n     incline to enshroud his work in a cloud of mystery and to\r\n     figure it as an unprecedented awe-inspiring feature to break\r\n     down the prejudices of the ages, it is easy to think of him as\r\n     having timidly profaned the human body by his anatomizing zeal\r\n     in but one or two instances. His own language, however,\r\n     throughout his book is that of a man who was familiar with the\r\n     differing conditions of the organs found in many different\r\n     bodies; a man who was habitually dissecting.\"\r\n\r\n     (Quotations from the work of Mundinus showing his familiarity\r\n     with dissections. The leaf and line references are to the\r\n     Dryander edition, Marburg, 1541.)\r\n\r\n     \"I do not consider separately the anatomy of component parts,\r\n     because their anatomy does not appear clearly in the fresh\r\n     subject, but rather in those macerated in water.\" (Leaf 2,\r\n     lines 8-13.)\r\n\r\n     \"... these differences are more noticeable in the cooked or\r\n     perfectly dried body, and so you need not be concerned about\r\n     them, and perhaps I will make an anatomy upon such a one at\r\n     another time and will write what I shall observe with my own\r\n     senses, as I have proposed from the beginning.\" (Leaf 60,\r\n     lines 14-17.)\r\n\r\n     \"What the members are to which these nerves come cannot well\r\n     be seen in such a dissection as this, but it should be\r\n     liquefied with rain water, and this is not contemplated in the\r\n     present body.\" (Leaf 60, lines 31-33.)\r\n\r\n     \"After the veins you will note many muscles and many large and\r\n     strong cords, the complete anatomy of which you will not\r\n     endeavor to find in such a body but in a body dried in the sun\r\n     for three years, as I have demonstrated at another time; I\r\n     also declared completely their number, and wrote the anatomy\r\n     of the muscles of the arms, hands, and feet in a lecture which\r\n     I gave over the first, second, third, and fourth subjects.\"\r\n     (Leaf 61, lines 1-7.)\r\n\r\nVery probably the best evidence that we have of the comparative\r\nfrequency at least of dissection at this time is to be found in the\r\nrecords of a trial for body-snatching that occurred in Bologna. The\r\ndetails would remind one very much of what we know of the difficulties\r\nwith regard to dissection in America a couple of generations ago, when\r\nno bodies were provided by law for dissection purposes. In the course of\r\nsome studies for the history of the New York State Medical Society (New\r\nYork, 1906) I found that nearly every one of the first half dozen\r\npresidents of the New York Academy of Medicine, which is not much more\r\nthan sixty years old, had had body-snatching experiences when they were\r\nyounger. Dr. Samuel Francis, the medico-historical writer, tells of a\r\npersonal expedition across the ferry in the winter time, bringing a body\r\nfrom a Long Island graveyard. In order to avoid the constables on the\r\nLong Island side and the police on the New York side, because there had\r\nbeen a number of cases of body-snatching recently and the authorities\r\nwere on the lookout, the corpse was placed sitting beside the physician\r\nwho drove the wagon, with a cloak wrapped around it, as if it were a\r\nliving person specially protected against the cold. Similar experiences\r\nwere not unusual. The lack of bodies for dissection is sometimes\r\nattributed to religious scruples, but they have very little to do with\r\nit, as at all times men have refused to allow the bodies of their\r\nfriends to be treated as anatomical material. This is the natural\r\nfeeling of abhorrence and not at all religious. It is only when there\r\nare many unclaimed bodies of strangers and the poor, as happens in large\r\ncities, that there can be an abundance of anatomical material.\r\n\r\nThe details of this body-snatching case are strangely familiar to those\r\nwho know the history of similar cases before the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century. The case occurred in 1319 in Bologna, just four\r\nyears after Mondino's public dissections. Four students were involved in\r\nthe charge of body-snatching, all of them from outside the city of\r\nBologna itself, three from Milan and one from Piacenza. In modern\r\nexperience, too, as a rule, students from outside of the town where the\r\nmedical college was situated, were always a little readier than natives\r\nto violate graveyards. These four students were accused of having gone\r\nat night to the Cemetery of St. Barnabas, outside the gate of San\r\nFelice,--suburban graveyards were usually the scene of such\r\nexploits,--and to have dug up the body of a certain criminal named\r\nPasino, who had been hanged a few days before. They carried the body to\r\nthe school in the Parish of San Salvatore, where Alberto Zancari was\r\nteaching. The resurrection had been accomplished without witnesses, but\r\nthere were several witnesses who testified that they recognized the body\r\nof Pasino in the school and students occupied with its dissection. If\r\nevidence for the zeal of the medical students of that time for\r\ndissection were needed, surely we have it in the testimony at this\r\ntrial. At a time when body-snatching has become a criminal offence\r\nusually there have been many repeated occurrences of it before the\r\nparties are brought to trial, so that it seems not unlikely that a good\r\nmany dissections of illegally secured bodies were being done at Bologna\r\nat this time.\r\n\r\nWe know of a regulation of the University in force at this time, which\r\nrequired the teachers at the University to do an anatomy or dissection\r\nfor students if they secured a body for that purpose. The students seem\r\nto have used all sorts of influence, political, monetary, diplomatic,\r\nand ecclesiastical, in order to secure the bodies of criminals.\r\nSometimes when they failed in their purpose they waited until after\r\nburial and then took the body without leave. When we recall the awfully\r\ndeterrent condition in which bodies must have been that were thus\r\nprovided for dissecting purposes, it is easy to understand that the\r\nenthusiasm of the students for dissection must have been at a very high\r\npitch. Certainly it was far higher than at the present day, when, in\r\nspite of the fact that our dissecting-rooms have very few of the\r\nold-time dangers and unpleasantnesses, dissection is only practised with\r\nassiduity if special care is exercised in requiring attendance and\r\nsuperintending the work of the department.\r\n\r\nIn my book on \"The Popes and Science\" I have gathered the traditions\r\nrelating to Mondino's assistants in the chair of anatomy at Bologna.\r\nThey furnish abundant evidence of the fact that dissections, far from\r\nbeing uncommon, must have been not at all infrequent at the north\r\nItalian universities at this time. Curiously enough, one of these\r\nassistants was a young woman who, as was not infrequently the custom at\r\nthis time in the Italian universities, was matriculated as a student at\r\nBologna. She took up first philosophy, and afterwards anatomy, under\r\nMondino. While it is not generally realized, co-education was quite\r\ncommon at the Italian universities of the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies, and at no time since the foundation of the universities has a\r\ncentury passed in Italy without distinguished women occupying\r\nprofessors' chairs at some of the Italian universities. This young\r\nwoman, Alessandra Giliani, of Persiceto, a country district not far from\r\nBologna, took up the study of anatomy with ardor and, strange as it may\r\nappear, became especially enthusiastic about dissection. She became so\r\nskilful that she was made the prosector of anatomy, that is, one who\r\nprepares bodies for demonstration by the professors.\r\n\r\nAccording to the \"Cronaca Persicetana,\" quoted by Medici in his \"History\r\nof the Anatomical School at Bologna\":\r\n\r\n\"She became most valuable to Mondino because she would cleanse most\r\nskilfully the smallest vein, the arteries, all ramifications of the\r\nvessels, without lacerating or dividing them, and to prepare them for\r\ndemonstration she would fill them with various colored liquids, which,\r\nafter having been driven into the vessels, would harden without\r\ndestroying the vessels. Again, she would paint these same vessels to\r\ntheir minute branches so perfectly and color them so naturally that,\r\nadded to the wonderful explanations and teachings of the master, they\r\nbrought him great fame and credit.\" The whole passage shows a wonderful\r\nanticipation of our most modern methods--injection, painting,\r\nhardening--of making anatomical preparations for class and demonstration\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nSome of the details of the story have been doubted, but her memorial\r\ntablet, erected at the time of her death in the Church of San Pietro e\r\nMarcellino of the Hospital of Santa Maria de Mareto, gives all the\r\nimportant facts, and tells the story of the grief of her fiance, who was\r\nhimself Mondino's other assistant.[17] This was Otto Agenius, who had\r\nmade for himself a name as an assistant to the chair of anatomy in\r\nBologna, and of whom there were great hopes entertained because he had\r\nalready shown signs of genius as an investigator in anatomy. These hopes\r\nwere destined to grievous disappointment, however, for Otto died\r\nsuddenly, before he had reached his thirtieth year. The fact that both\r\nthese assistants of Mondino died young and suddenly, would seem to point\r\nto the fact that probably dissection wounds in those early days proved\r\neven more fatal than they occasionally did a century or more ago, when\r\nthe proper precautions against them were not so well understood. The\r\ndeath of Mondino's two prosectors in early years would seem to hint at\r\nsome such unfortunate occurrence.\r\n\r\nAs regards the evidence of what the young man had accomplished before\r\nhis untimely death, probably the following quotation, which Medici has\r\ntaken from one of the old chroniclers, will give the best idea:\r\n\r\n     \"What advantage indeed might not Bologna have had from Otto\r\n     Agenius Lustrulanus, whom Mondino had used as an assiduous\r\n     prosector, if he had not been taken away by a swift and\r\n     lamentable death before he had completed the sixth lustrum of\r\n     his life!\"\r\n\r\nHow well the tradition created by Mondino continued at the university\r\nwill be best understood from what we know of Guy de Chauliac's visit to\r\nthe medical school here about the middle of the century. The great\r\nFrench surgeon tells us that he came to Bologna to study anatomy under\r\nthe direction of Mondino's successor, Bertruccius. When he wrote his\r\npreface to his great surgery he recalled this teaching of anatomy at\r\nBologna and said, \"It is necessary and useful to every physician to\r\nknow, first of all, anatomy. For this purpose the study of books is\r\nindeed useful, but it is not sufficient to explain those things which\r\ncan only be appreciated by the senses and which need to be seen in the\r\ndead body itself.\" He advises his students to consult Mundinus' treatise\r\nbut to demonstrate its details for themselves on the dead body. He\r\nrelates that he himself had often, _multitoties_, done this, especially\r\nunder the direction of Bertruccius at Bologna. Curiously enough, as\r\npointed out by Professor Pilcher, Mondino had used this same word\r\n_multitotiens_ (the variant spelling makes no difference in the meaning)\r\nin speaking about his own work. In describing the hypogastric lesion he\r\nmentions that he had demonstrated certain veins in it many times,\r\n_multitotiens_.\r\n\r\nMondino was just past fifty when he finished his little book and\r\npermitted copies of it to be made. Though the book occurs so early in\r\nthe history of modern book-making the author offers his excuses to the\r\npublic for writing it, and quotes the authority of Galen, to whom he\r\nturns in other difficult situations, for justification. As prefaces go,\r\nMondino's is so like that of many an author of more recent date that his\r\nwords have a bibliographic, as well as a personal, interest. He said:\r\n\r\n     \"A work upon any science or art--as saith Galen--is issued for\r\n     three reasons: first, that one may satisfy his friends.\r\n     Second, that he may exercise his best mental powers. Third,\r\n     that he may be saved from the oblivion incident to old age.\r\n     Therefore, moved by these three causes, I have proposed to my\r\n     pupils to compose a certain work on medicine.\r\n\r\n     \"And because a knowledge of the parts to be subjected to\r\n     medicine (which is the human body, and the names of its\r\n     various divisions) is a part of medical science, as saith\r\n     Averrhoes in his first chapter, in the section on the\r\n     definition of medicine, for this reason among others, I have\r\n     set out to lay before you the knowledge of the parts of the\r\n     human body which is derived from anatomy, not attempting to\r\n     use a lofty style, but the rather that which is suitable to a\r\n     manual of procedure.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the early editions of Mondinus' book are said, according to old\r\nwriters, to have contained illustrations. None of these copies have come\r\ndown to us, but the assertion is made so definitely that it seems likely\r\nto have been the case. The editions that we have contain wood engravings\r\nof the method of making a dissection as frontispiece, so that it would\r\nnot be difficult to think of further such illustrations having been\r\nemployed in the book itself. As we note in the chapter on \"Great\r\nSurgeons of the Medieval Universities,\" Mondeville, according to Guy de\r\nChauliac, had pictures of anatomical preparations which he used for\r\nteaching purposes. It is easy to understand that the value of such aids\r\nwould be recognized at a time when the difficulty of preserving bodies\r\nmade it necessary to do dissections hurriedly so as to get the rapidly\r\ndecomposing material out of the way.\r\n\r\nBeyond his book and certain circumstances connected with it we know very\r\nlittle about Mondino. What we know, however, enables us to conclude\r\nthat, like many another great teacher, he must have had the special\r\nfaculty of inspiring his students with an ardent enthusiasm for the work\r\nthat they were taking under him. Hence the body-snatching and other\r\nstories. Mondino continued to be held in high estimation by the\r\nBolognese for centuries after his death. Dr. Pilcher calls attention to\r\nthe fact that his sepulchral tablet, which is in the portico of the\r\nChurch of San Vitari in Bologna, and a replica of which he was allowed\r\nto have made in order to bring it to America, is the only one of the\r\nsepulchral tablets in the great churches of Florence, San Domenico, San\r\nMartino, the Cathedral and the Cloister of San Giacomo degli Ermitani,\r\nwhich has not been removed from its original location and placed in the\r\nhalls of the Civic Museum. Their removal he considers \"a kind of\r\ndesecration which does violence to one's sense of sanctity and\r\npropriety.\" \"Fortunately, thus far, the Mondino Tablet has escaped the\r\nspoiler.\" Very probably Dr. Pilcher's replica of the tablet which he\r\nwas required to deposit in the Civic Museum at the time when the copy\r\nwas made to be brought to America may save the tablet to be seen in its\r\noriginal position for many generations.\r\n\r\nMondino's career is of special interest because it foreshadows the life\r\nand accomplishment of many another maker of medicine of the after time.\r\nHe did a great new thing in medicine in organizing regular public\r\ndissections, and then in making a manual that would facilitate the work.\r\nHe waited patiently for years before completing his book in order that\r\nit might be the fruit of long experience, and so be more helpful to\r\nothers. He was so modest as to require urging to secure the publication.\r\nHe had the reward of his patience in the popularity of his little work\r\nfor centuries after his time. The glimpse that we get of his relations\r\nto his young assistants, Agenius and Alessandra, seems to show us a\r\nteacher of distinct personal magnetism. Undoubtedly the reputation of\r\nhis book did much for not only the medical school of the University of\r\nBologna, but also for the medical schools of other north Italian\r\nuniversities, and helped to bring to them the crowds of students that\r\nflocked there during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nTaddeo and Mondino turned the attention of the medical students of their\r\ngenerations Bolognawards. Before that time they had mainly gone to\r\nSalerno. After their time most of the ardent students of medicine felt\r\nthat they must study for a time at least at Bologna. Other important\r\nmedical schools of Italian universities at Padua, at Vicenza, at\r\nPiacenza, arose and prospered. During the time when the political\r\ntroubles of Italy reached a climax about the middle of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, while the Popes were at Avignon, there was a remission in the\r\nattendance at all the Italian universities, but with the Popes' return\r\nto Rome and the coming of even comparative peace to Italy, Bologna once\r\nmore became the term of medical pilgrimages for students from all over\r\nthe world. In the meantime Mondino's book went forth to be the most used\r\ntext-book of its kind until Vesalius' great work came to replace it. To\r\nhave ruled in the world of anatomy for two centuries as the best known\r\nof teachers is of itself a distinction that shows us at once the\r\nteaching power and the scientific ability of this professor of anatomy\r\nof Bologna in the early fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nGREAT SURGEONS OF THE MEDIEVAL UNIVERSITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nStrange as it may appear to those who have not watched the development\r\nof our knowledge of the Middle Ages in recent years the most interesting\r\nfeature in the medical departments and, indeed, of the post-graduate\r\nwork generally of the medieval universities, is that in surgery. There\r\nis a very general impression that this department of medicine did not\r\ndevelop until quite recent years, and that particularly it failed to\r\ndevelop to any extent in the Middle Ages. A good many of the historians\r\nof this period, indeed, though never the special historians of medicine,\r\nhave even gone far afield in order to find some reason why surgery did\r\nnot develop at this time. They have insisted that the Church by its\r\nprohibition of the shedding of blood, first to monks and friars, and\r\nthen to the secular clergy, prevented the normal development of surgery.\r\nBesides they add that Church opposition to anatomy completely precluded\r\nall possibility of any genuine natural evolution of surgery as a\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no more amusing feature of quite a number of\r\nsupposedly respectable and presumably authoritative historical works\r\nwritten in English than this assumption with regard to the absence of\r\nsurgery during the later Middle Ages. Only the most complete ignorance\r\nof the actual history of medicine and surgery can account for it. The\r\nwriters who make such assertions must never have opened an authoritative\r\nmedical history. Nothing illustrates so well the expression of the\r\neditors of the \"Cambridge Modern History\" referred to more than once in\r\nthese pages that \"in view of changes and of gains such as these [the\r\njointing of original documents] it has become impossible for historical\r\nwriters of the present day to trust without reserve even to the most\r\nrespected secondary authority. The honest student finds himself\r\ncontinually deserted, retarded, misled by the classics of historical\r\nliterature.\" Fortunately for us this sweeping condemnation does not hold\r\nto any great extent for the medical historical classics. All of the\r\nclassic historians of medicine tell us much of the surgery of the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and in recent years the\r\nrepublication of old texts and the further study of manuscript documents\r\nof various kinds have made it very clear that there is almost no period\r\nin the history of the world when surgery was so thoroughly and\r\nsuccessfully cultivated as during the rise and development of the\r\nuniversities and their medical schools in the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to trace the succession of great contributors to\r\nsurgery during these two centuries. We know their teaching not from\r\ntradition, but from their text-books so faithfully preserved for us by\r\ntheir devoted students, who must have begrudged no time and spared no\r\nlabor in copying, for many of the books are large, yet exist in many\r\nmanuscript copies.\r\n\r\nModern surgery may be said to owe its origin to a school of surgeons,\r\nthe leaders of whom were educated at Salerno in the early part of the\r\nthirteenth century, and who, teaching at various north Italian\r\nuniversities, wrote out their surgical principles and experiences in a\r\nseries of important contributions to that department of medical science.\r\nThe fact that the origin of the school was at Salerno, where, as is well\r\nknown, Arabian influence counted for much and for which Constantine's\r\ntranslations of Arabian works proved such a stimulus a century before,\r\nmakes most students conclude that this later medieval surgical\r\ndevelopment is simply a continuation of the Arabian surgery that, as we\r\nhave seen, developed very interestingly during the earlier Middle Ages.\r\nAny such idea, however, is not founded on the realities of the\r\nsituation, but on an assumption with regard to the extent of Arabian\r\ninfluence. Gurlt in his \"History of Surgery\" (Vol. I, page 701)\r\ncompletely contradicts this idea, and says with regard to the first of\r\nthe great Italian writers on surgery, Rogero, that \"though Arabian works\r\non surgery had been brought over to Italy by Constantine Africanus a\r\nhundred years before Roger's time, these exercised no influence over\r\nItalian surgery in the next century, and there is scarcely a trace of\r\nthe surgical knowledge of the Arabs to be found in Roger's works.\"\r\n\r\nIt is in the history of medicine particularly that it is possible to\r\ntrace the true influence of the Arabs on European thought in the later\r\nMiddle Ages. We have already seen in the chapter on Salerno that Arabian\r\ninfluence did harm to Salernitan medical teaching. The school of Salerno\r\nitself had developed simple, dietetic, hygienic, and general remedial\r\nmeasures that included the use of only a comparatively small amount of\r\ndrugs. Its teachers emphasized nature's curative powers. With Arabian\r\ninfluence came polypharmacy, distrust of nature, and attempts to cure\r\ndisease rather than help nature. In surgery, which developed very\r\nwonderfully in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Salerno must be\r\ncredited with the incentive that led up to the marvellous development\r\nthat came. With this, however, Arabian influence has nothing to do.\r\nGurlt, besides calling attention to the fact that the author of the\r\nfirst great text-book on the subject not only did not draw his\r\ninspiration from Arab sources, insisted that \"instead of any Arabisms\r\nbeing found in his [Roger's] writings many Graecisms occur.\" The\r\nSalernitan school of surgery drank at the fountain-head of Greek\r\nsurgery. Apart from Greek sources Roger's book rests entirely upon his\r\nown experiences, those of his teachers and his colleagues, and the\r\ntradition in surgery that had developed at Salerno. This tradition was\r\nentirely from the Greek. Roger himself says in one place, \"We have\r\nresolved to write out deliberately our methods of operation such as they\r\nhave been derived from our own experience and that of our colleagues and\r\nillustrious men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nROGER, ROLAND, AND THE FOUR MASTERS\r\n\r\nRuggero, or Rogero, who is also known as Rogerio and Rogerus with the\r\nadjective Parmensis, or Salernitanus, of Parma or of Salerno, and often\r\nin German and English history simply as Roger, lived at the end of the\r\ntwelfth or the beginning of the thirteenth century and probably wrote\r\nhis text-book about 1180. This text-book was, according to tradition,\r\noriginally drafted for his lessons in surgery at Salerno. It attracted\r\nmuch attention and after being commented on by his pupil Rolando, the\r\nwork of both of them being subsequently annotated by the Four Masters,\r\nthis combined work became the basis of modern surgery. Roger was\r\nprobably born either in Palermo or Parma. There are traditions of his\r\nhaving taught for a while at Paris and at the University of Montpellier,\r\nthough these are not substantiated. His book was printed at Venice in\r\n1546, and has been lately reprinted by De Renzi in his \"Collectio\r\nSalernitana.\"\r\n\r\nRoland was a pupil of Roger's, and the two names that often occur in\r\nmedieval romance became associated in a great historic reality as a\r\nconsequence of Roland's commentary on his master's work, which was a\r\nfavorite text-book in surgery for a good while in the thirteenth century\r\nat Salerno. Some space will be given to the consideration of their\r\nsurgical teaching after a few words with regard to some disciples who\r\nmade a second commentary, adding to the value of the original work.\r\n\r\nThis is the well-known commentary of the Four Masters, a text-book of\r\nsurgery written somewhat in the way that we now make text-books in\r\nvarious departments of medicine, that is, by asking men who have made\r\nspecialties of certain subjects to write on that subject and then bind\r\nthem all together in a single volume. It represents but another striking\r\nreminder that most of our methods are old, not new as we are likely to\r\nimagine them. The Four Masters took the works of Roger and Rolando,\r\nacknowledged their indebtedness much more completely than do our modern\r\nwriters on all occasions, I fear, and added their commentaries.\r\n\r\nGurlt says (\"Geschichte der Chirurgie,\" Vol. I, p. 703) that \"in spite\r\nof the fact that there is some doubt about the names of the authors,\r\nthis volume constitutes one of the most important sources for the\r\nhistory of surgery of the later Middle Ages and makes it very clear that\r\nthese writers drew their opinions from a rich experience.\" It is rather\r\neasy to illustrate from the quotations given in Gurlt or from the\r\naccounts of their teaching in Daremberg or De Renzi some features of\r\nthis experience that can scarcely fail to be surprising to modern\r\nsurgeons. For instance, what is to be found in this old text-book of\r\nsurgery with regard to fractures of the skull is likely to be very\r\ninteresting to surgeons at all times. One might be tempted to say that\r\nfewer men would die every year in prison cells who ought to be in\r\nhospitals, if the old-time teaching was taken to heart. For there are\r\nrather emphatic directions not to conclude because the scalp is\r\nunwounded that there can be no fracture of the skull. Where nothing can\r\nbe felt care must be exercised in getting the history of the case. For\r\ninstance, if a man is hit by a metal instrument shaped like the clapper\r\nof a bell or by a heavy key, or by a rounded instrument made of\r\nlead--this would remind one very much of the lead pipe of the modern\r\ntime, so fruitful of mistakes of diagnosis in head injuries--special\r\ncare must be taken to look for symptoms in spite of the lack of an\r\nexternal penetrating wound. Where there is good reason to suspect a\r\nfracture because of the severity of the injury, the scalp should be\r\nincised and a fracture of the cranium looked for carefully. That is\r\ncarrying the exploratory incision pretty far. If a fracture is found the\r\nsurgeon should trephine so as to relieve the brain of any pressure of\r\nblood that might be affecting it.\r\n\r\nThere are many warnings, however, of the danger of opening the skull and\r\nof the necessity for definitely deciding beforehand that there is good\r\nreason for so doing. How carefully their observations had been made and\r\nhow well they had taken advantage of their opportunities, which were, of\r\ncourse, very frequent in those warlike times when firearms were unknown,\r\nhand-to-hand conflict common, and blunt weapons were often used, can be\r\nappreciated very well from some of the directions. For instance, they\r\nknew of the possibility of fracture by _contrecoup_. They say that\r\n\"quite frequently though the percussion comes in the anterior part of\r\nthe cranium, the cranium is fractured on the opposite part.\"[18] They\r\neven seem to have known of accidents such as we now discuss in\r\nconnection with the laceration of the middle meningeal artery. They warn\r\nsurgeons of the possibilities of these cases. They tell the story of \"a\r\nyouth who had a very small wound made by a thrown stone and there seemed\r\nno serious results or bad signs. He died the next day, however. His\r\ncranium was opened and a large amount of black blood was found\r\ncoagulated about his dura mater.\"\r\n\r\nThere are many interesting things said with regard to depressed\r\nfractures and the necessity for elevating the bone. If the depressed\r\nportion is wedged then an opening should be made with the trephine and\r\nan elevating instrument called a spatumen used to relieve the pressure.\r\nGreat care should be taken, however, in carrying out this procedure lest\r\nthe bone of the cranium itself, in being lifted, should injure the soft\r\nstructures within. The dura mater should be carefully protected from\r\ninjury as well as the pin. Care should especially be exercised at the\r\nbrow and the rear of the head and at the commissures (_proram et pupim\r\net commissuras_), since at these points the dura mater is likely to be\r\nadherent. Perhaps the most striking expression, the word _infect_ being\r\nitalicized by Gurlt, is: \"In elevating the cranium be solicitous lest\r\nyou should infect or injure the dura mater.\"\r\n\r\nFor wounds of the scalp sutures of silk are recommended because this\r\nresists putrefaction and holds the wound edges together. Interrupted\r\nsutures about a finger-breadth apart are recommended. \"The lower part of\r\nthe wound should be left open so that the cure may proceed properly.\"\r\nRed powder was strewed over the wound and the leaf of a plant set above\r\nit. In the lower angle of the wound a pledget of lint for drainage\r\npurposes was inlaid. Hemorrhage was prevented by pressure, by the\r\nbinding on of _burnt_ wool firmly, and by the ligature of veins and by\r\nthe cautery.\r\n\r\nThere are rather interesting discussions of the prognosis of wounds of\r\nthe head, especially such as may be determined from general symptoms in\r\nthis commentary of the Four Masters on Roger's and Rolando's treatises.\r\nIf an acute febrile condition develops, the wound is mortal. If the\r\npatient loses the use of the hands and feet or if he loses his power of\r\ndirection, or his sensation, the wound is mortal. If a universal\r\nparalysis comes on, the wound is mortal. For the treatment of all these\r\nwounds careful precautions are suggested. Cold was supposed to be\r\nparticularly noxious to them. Operations on the head were not to be done\r\nin cold weather and, above all, not in cold places. The air where such\r\noperations were done must be warmed artificially. Hot plates should\r\nsurround the patient's head while the operation was being performed. If\r\nthis were not possible they were to be done by candlelight, the candle\r\nbeing held as close as possible in a warm room. These precautions are\r\ninteresting as foreshadowing many ideas of much more modern time and\r\nespecially indicating how old is the idea that cold may be taken in\r\nwounds. In popular medicine this still has its place. Whenever a wound\r\ndoes badly in the winter time patients are sure that they have taken\r\ncold. Such popular medical ideas are always derived from supposedly\r\nscientific medicine, and until we learned about microbes physicians used\r\nthe same expressions. We have not got entirely away from them yet.\r\n\r\nThese old surgeons must have had many experiences with fractures at the\r\nbase of the skull. Hemorrhages from the mouth and nose, for instance,\r\nand from the ears were considered bad signs. They were inclined to\r\nsuggest that openings into the skull should be discovered by efforts to\r\ndemonstrate a connection between the mouth and nares and the brain\r\ncavity. For instance, in their commentary the Four Masters said: \"Let\r\nthe patient hold his mouth and nostrils tight shut and blow strongly.\"\r\nIf there was any lessening of the pressure or any appearance of air in\r\nthe wound in the scalp, then a connection between the mouth and nose was\r\ndiagnosticated. This is ingenious but eminently dangerous because of the\r\ninfectious material contained in the nasal and oral cavities, so likely\r\nto be forced by such pressure into the skull. They were particularly\r\nanxious to detect linear fractures. One of their methods of negative\r\ndiagnosis for fractures of the skull was that if the patient were able\r\nto bring his teeth together strongly, or to crack a nut without pain,\r\nthen there was no fracture present. One of the commentators, however,\r\nadds to this \"_sed hoc aliquando fallit_--but this sign sometimes\r\nfails.\" Split or crack fractures were also diagnosticated by the method\r\nsuggested by Hippocrates of pouring some colored fluid over the skull\r\nafter the bone was exposed, when the linear fracture would show by\r\ncoloration. The Four Masters suggest a sort of red ink for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWhile they have so much to say about fractures of the skull and insist,\r\nover and over again, that though all depressed fractures need treatment\r\nand many fissure fractures require trepanation, still great care must be\r\nexercised in the selection of cases. They say, for instance, that\r\nsurgeons who in every serious wound of the head have recourse to the\r\ntrephine must be looked upon as \"fools and idiots\" (_idioti et\r\nstolidi_). In the light of what we now know about the necessity for\r\nabsolute cleanliness,--asepsis as we have come to call it,--it is rather\r\nstartling to note the directions that are given to a surgeon to be\r\nobserved on the day when he is to do a trepanation. For obvious reasons\r\nI prefer to quote it in the Latin: \"_Et nota quod die ilia cavendum est\r\nmedico a coitu et malis cibis aera corrumpentibus, ut sunt allia, cepe,\r\net hujusmodi, et colloquio mulieris menstruosae, et manus ejus debent\r\nesse mundae, etc._\" My quotation is from Gurlt, Vol. I, p. 707. The\r\ndirections are most interesting. The surgeon's hands must be clean, he\r\nmust avoid the taking of food that may corrupt the air, such as onions,\r\nleeks, and the like; must avoid menstruating and other women, and in\r\ngeneral must keep himself in a state of absolute cleanliness.\r\n\r\nTo read a passage like this separated from its context and without\r\nknowing anything about the wonderful powers of observation of the men\r\nfrom whom it comes, it would be very easy to think that it is merely a\r\nset of general directions which they had made on some general principle,\r\nperhaps quite foolish in itself. We know, however, that these men had by\r\nobservation detected nearly every feature of importance in fractures of\r\nthe skull, their indications and contra-indications for operation and\r\ntheir prognosis. They had anticipated nearly everything of importance\r\nthat has come to be insisted on even in our own time in the handling of\r\nthese difficult cases. It is not unlikely, therefore, that they had also\r\narrived at the recognition by observations on many patients that the\r\nsatisfactory after-course of these cases which were operated on by the\r\nsurgeon after due regard to such meticulous cleanliness as is suggested\r\nin the paragraph I have quoted, made it very clear that these aseptic\r\nprecautions, as we would call them, were extremely important for the\r\noutcome of the case and, therefore, were well worth the surgeon's\r\nattention, though they must have required very careful precautions and\r\nconsiderable self-denial. Indeed this whole subject, the virtual\r\nanticipation of our nineteenth-century principles of aseptic surgery in\r\nthe thirteenth century, is not a dream nor a far-fetched explanation\r\nwhen one knows enough about the directions that were laid down in the\r\nsurgical text-books of that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH ITALIAN SURGEONS\r\n\r\nAfter Roger and Rolando and the Four Masters, who owe the inspiration\r\nfor their work to Salerno and the south of Italy, comes a group of north\r\nItalian surgeons: Bruno da Longoburgo, usually called simply Bruno;\r\nTheodoric and his father, Hugo of Lucca, and William of Salicet.\r\nImmediately following them come two names that belong, one almost feels,\r\nto a more modern period: Mondino, the author of the first text-book on\r\ndissection, and Lanfranc (the disciple of William of Salicet), who\r\ntaught at Paris and \"gave that primacy to French surgery which it\r\nmaintained all the centuries down to the nineteenth\" (Pagel). It might\r\nvery well be thought that this group of Italian surgeons had very little\r\nin their writings that would be of any more than antiquarian interest\r\nfor the modern time. It needs but a little knowledge of their writings\r\nas they have come down to us to show how utterly false any such opinion\r\nis. To Hugo da Lucca and his son Theodoric we owe the introduction and\r\nthe gradual bringing into practical use of various methods of\r\nanaesthesia. They used opium and mandragora for this purpose and later\r\nemployed an inhalant mixture, the composition of which is not absolutely\r\nknown. They seem, however, to have been very successful in producing\r\ninsensibility to pain for even rather serious and complicated and\r\nsomewhat lengthy operations. Indeed it is to this that must be\r\nattributed most of their surprising success as surgeons at this early\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nWe are so accustomed to think that anaesthesia was discovered about the\r\nmiddle of the nineteenth century in America that we forget that\r\nliterature is full of references in Tom Middleton's (seventeenth\r\ncentury) phrase to \"the mercies of old surgeons who put their patients\r\nto sleep before they cut them.\" Anaesthetics were experimented with\r\nalmost as zealously, during the latter half of the thirteenth century at\r\nleast, as during the latter half of the nineteenth century. They were\r\nprobably not as successful as we are, but they did succeed in producing\r\ninsensibility to pain, otherwise they could never have operated to the\r\nextent they did. Moreover the traditions show that the Da Luccas\r\nparticularly had invented a method that left very little to be desired\r\nin this matter of anaesthesia. A reference to the sketch of Guy de\r\nChauliac in this volume will show how practical the method was in his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nNearly the same story as with regard to anaesthetics has to be repeated\r\nfor what are deemed so surely modern developments,--asepsis and\r\nantisepsis. I have already suggested that Roger seems to have known how\r\nextremely important it was to approach operations upon the skull with\r\nthe most absolute cleanliness. There are many hints of the same kind in\r\nother writers which show that this was no mere accidental remark, but\r\nwas a definite conclusion derived from experience and careful\r\nobservation of results. We find much more with regard to this same\r\nsubject in the writings of the group of northern Italian surgeons and\r\nespecially in the group of those associated with William of Salicet.\r\nProfessor Clifford Allbutt, Regius Professor of Medicine at the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge, England, in his address before the St. Louis\r\nWorld's Fair Congress of Arts and Science in 1904, did not hesitate to\r\ndeclare that William discussed the causes for union by first intention\r\nand the modes by which it might be obtained. He, too, insisted on\r\ncleanliness as the most important factor in having good surgical\r\nresults, and all of this group of men, in operating upon septic cases,\r\nused stronger wine as a dressing. This exerted, as will be readily\r\nunderstood, a very definite antiseptic quality.\r\n\r\nEvidently some details of the teaching of this group of great surgeons\r\nin northern Italy in the second half of the thirteenth century will make\r\nclearer to us how much the rising universities of the time were\r\naccomplishing in medicine and surgery as well as in their other\r\ndepartments. The dates of the origin of some of these universities\r\nshould perhaps be recalled so as to remind readers how closely related\r\nthey are to this great group of surgical teachers. Salerno was founded\r\nvery early, probably in the tenth century, Bologna, Reggio, and Modena\r\ncame into existence toward the end of the twelfth century; Vicenza,\r\nPadua, Naples, Vercelli, and Piacenza, as well as Arezzo, during the\r\nfirst half of the thirteenth century; Rome, Perugia, Trevizo, Pisa,\r\nFlorence, Sienna, Lucca, Pavia, and Ferrara during the next century. The\r\nthirteenth century was the special flourishing period of the\r\nuniversities, and the medical departments, far from being behind, were\r\nleaders in accomplishment. (See my \"The Thirteenth Greatest of\r\nCenturies,\" N.Y., 1908.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUNO DA LONGOBURGO\r\n\r\nThe first of this important group of north Italian surgeons who taught\r\nat these universities was Bruno of Longoburgo. While he was born in\r\nCalabria, and probably studied in Salerno, his work was done at Vicenza,\r\nPadua, and Verona. His text-book, the \"Chirurgia Magna,\" dedicated to\r\nhis friend Andrew of Piacenza, was completed at Padua in January, 1252.\r\nGurlt notes that he is the first of the Italian surgeons who quotes,\r\nbesides the Greeks, the Arabian writers on surgery. Eclecticism had\r\ndefinitely come into vogue to replace exclusive devotion to the Greek\r\nauthors, and men were taking what was good wherever they found it. Gurlt\r\ntells us that Bruno owed much of what he wrote to his own experience and\r\nobservation. He begins his work by a definition of surgery, _chirurgia_,\r\ntracing it to the Greek and emphasizing that it means handwork. He then\r\ndeclares that it is the last instrument of medicine to be used only when\r\nthe other two instruments, diet and potions, have failed. He insists\r\nthat surgeons must learn by seeing surgical operations and watching them\r\nlong and diligently. They must be neither rash nor over bold and should\r\nbe extremely cautious about operating. While he says that he does not\r\nobject to a surgeon taking a glass of wine, the followers of this\r\nspecialty must not drink to such an extent as to disturb their command\r\nover themselves, and they must not be habitual drinkers. While all that\r\nis necessary for their art cannot be learned out of books, they must not\r\ndespise books however, for many things can be learned readily from\r\nbooks, even about the most difficult parts of surgery. Three things the\r\nsurgeon has to do:--\"to bring together separated parts, to separate\r\nthose that have become abnormally united, and to extirpate what is\r\nsuperfluous.\"\r\n\r\nIn his second chapter on healing he talks about healing by first and\r\nsecond intention. Wounds must be more carefully looked to in summer than\r\nin winter, because _putrefactio est major in aestate quam in hyeme_,\r\nputrefaction is greater in summer than in winter. For proper union care\r\nmust be exercised to bring the wound edges accurately together and not\r\nallow hair, or oil, or dressings to come between them. In large wounds\r\nhe considers stitching indispensable, and recommends for this a fine,\r\nsquare needle. The preferable suture material in his experience was silk\r\nor linen.\r\n\r\nThe end of the wound was to remain open in order that lint might be\r\nplaced therein in order to draw off any objectionable material. He is\r\nparticularly insistent on the necessity for drainage. In deep wounds\r\nspecial provision must be made, and in wounds of extremities the limb\r\nmust be so placed as to encourage drainage. If drainage does not take\r\nplace, then either the wound must be thoroughly opened, or if necessary\r\na counter opening must be made to provide drainage. All his treatment of\r\nwounds is dry, however. Water, he considered, always did harm. We can\r\nreadily understand that the water generally available and especially as\r\nsurgeons saw it in camps and on the battlefield, was likely to do much\r\nmore harm than good. In penetrating wounds of the belly cavity, if there\r\nwas difficulty in bringing about the reposition of the intestines, they\r\nwere first to be pressed back with a sponge soaked in warm wine. Other\r\nmanipulations are suggested, and if necessary the wound must be\r\nenlarged. If the omentum finds its way out of the wound, all of it that\r\nis black or green must be cut off. In cases where the intestines are\r\nwounded they are to be sewed with a small needle and a silk thread and\r\ncare is to be exercised in bringing about complete closure of the wound.\r\nThis much will give a good idea of Bruno's thoroughness. Altogether,\r\nGurlt, in his \"History of Surgery,\" gives about fifteen large octavo\r\npages of rather small type to a _brief_ compendium of Bruno's teachings.\r\n\r\nOne or two other remarks of Bruno are rather interesting in the light of\r\nmodern developments in medicine. For instance, he suggests the\r\npossibility of being able to feel a stone in the bladder by means of\r\nbimanual palpation. He teaches that mothers may often be able to cure\r\nhernias, both umbilical and inguinal, in children by promptly taking up\r\nthe treatment of them as soon as noticed, bringing the edges of the\r\nhernial opening together by bandages and then preventing the reopening\r\nof the hernia by prohibiting wrestling and loud crying and violent\r\nmotion. He has seen overgrowth of the mamma in men, and declares that it\r\nis due to nothing else but fat, as a rule. He suggests if it should hang\r\ndown and be in the way on account of its size it should be extirpated.\r\nHe seems to have known considerable about the lipomas and advises that\r\nthey need only be removed in case they become bothersomely large. The\r\nremoval is easy, and any bleeding that takes place may be stopped by\r\nmeans of the cautery. He divides rectal fistulae into penetrating and\r\nnon-penetrating, and suggests salves for the non-penetrating and the\r\nactual cautery for those that penetrate. He warns against the\r\npossibility of producing incontinence by the incision of deep fistulae,\r\nfor this would leave the patient in a worse state than before.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUGH OF LUCCA\r\n\r\nBruno brought up with him the methods and principles of surgery from the\r\nsouth of Italy, but there seems to have been already in the north at\r\nleast one distinguished surgeon who had made his mark. This was Ugo da\r\nLucca or Ugo Luccanus, sometimes known in the modern times in German\r\nhistories of medicine as Hugo da Lucca and in English, Hugh of Lucca. He\r\nflourished early in the thirteenth century. In 1214 he was called to\r\nBologna to become the city physician, and joined the Bolognese\r\nvolunteers in the crusade in 1218, being present at the siege of\r\nDamietta. He returned to Bologna in 1221 and was given the post of legal\r\nphysician to the city. The civic statutes of Bologna are, according to\r\nGurlt, the oldest monument of legal medicine in the Middle Ages. Ugo\r\ndied not long after the middle of the century, and is said to have been\r\nnearly one hundred years old. Of his five sons, three became physicians.\r\nThe most celebrated of these was Theodoric, who wrote a text-book of\r\nsurgery in which are set down the traditions of surgery that had been\r\npractised in his father's life. Theodoric is especially enthusiastic in\r\npraise of his father, because he succeeded in bringing about such\r\nperfect healing of wounds with only wine and water and the ligature and\r\nwithout the employment of any ointments.\r\n\r\nUgo seems to have occupied himself much with chemistry. To him we owe a\r\nseries of discoveries with regard to anodyne and anaesthetizing drugs. He\r\nis said to have been the first who taught the sublimation of arsenic.\r\nUnfortunately he left no writings after him, and all that we know of him\r\nwe owe to the filial devotion of his son Theodoric.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEODORIC\r\n\r\nThis son, after having completed his medical studies at the age of about\r\ntwenty-three, entered the Dominican Order, then only recently\r\nestablished, but continued his practice of medicine undisturbed. His\r\necclesiastical preferment was rapid. He attracted the attention of the\r\nBishop of Valencia, and became his chaplain in Rome. At the age of about\r\nfifty he was made a bishop in South Italy and later transferred to the\r\nBishopric of Cervia, not far from Ravenna. Most of his life seems to\r\nhave been passed in Bologna however, and he continued to practise\r\nmedicine, devoting his fees, however, entirely to charity. His text-book\r\nof surgery was written about 1266 and is signed with his full name and\r\ntitle as Bishop of Cervia. Even at this time however, he still retained\r\nthe custom of designating himself as a member of the Dominican Order.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting thing in the first book of his surgery is\r\nundoubtedly his declaration that all wounds should be treated only with\r\nwine and bandaging. Wine he insists on as the best possible dressing for\r\nwounds. It was the most readily available antiseptic that they had at\r\nthat time, and undoubtedly both his father's recommendation of it and\r\nhis own favorable experience with it were due to this quality. It must\r\nhave acted as an excellent inhibitive agent of many of the simple forms\r\nof pus formation. At the conclusion of this first book he emphasizes\r\nthat it is extremely important for the healing of wounds that the\r\npatient should have good blood, and this can only be obtained from\r\nsuitable nutrition. It is essential therefore for the physician to be\r\nfamiliar with the foods which produce good blood in order that his\r\nwounded patients may be fed appropriately. He suggests, then, a number\r\nof articles of diet which are particularly useful in producing such a\r\nfavorable state of the tissues as will bring about the rebirth of flesh\r\nand the adhesion of wound surfaces. Shortly before he emphasizes the\r\nnecessity for not injuring nerves, though if nerves have been cut they\r\nshould be brought together as carefully as possible, the wound edges\r\nbeing then approximated.\r\n\r\nProbably the most interesting feature for our generation of the great\r\ntext-books of the surgeons of the medieval universities is the\r\noccurrence in them of definite directions for securing union in surgical\r\nwounds, at least by first intention and their insistence on keeping\r\nwounds clear. The expression union by first intention comes to us from\r\nthe olden time. They even boasted that the scars left after their\r\nincisions were often so small as to be scarcely noticeable. Such\r\nexpressions of course could only have come from men who had succeeded in\r\nsolving some of the problems of antisepsis that were solved once more in\r\nthe generation preceding our own. With regard to their treatment of\r\nwounds, Professor Clifford Allbutt says:[19]\r\n\r\n     \"They washed the wound with wine, scrupulously removing every\r\n     foreign particle; then they brought the edges together, not\r\n     allowing wine nor anything else to remain within--dry adhesive\r\n     surfaces were their desire. Nature, they said, produces the\r\n     means of union in a viscous exudation, or natural balm, as it\r\n     was afterwards called by Paracelsus, Pare, and Wurtz. In older\r\n     wounds they did their best to obtain union by cleansing,\r\n     desiccation, and refreshing of the edges. Upon the outer\r\n     surface they laid only lint steeped in wine. Powders they\r\n     regarded as too desiccating, for powder shuts in decomposing\r\n     matters wine after washing, purifying, and drying the raw\r\n     surfaces evaporates.\"\r\n\r\nTheodoric comes nearest to us of all these old surgeons. The surgeon\r\nwho in 1266 wrote: \"For it is not necessary, as Roger and Roland have\r\nwritten, as many of their disciples teach, and as all _modern_ surgeons\r\nprofess, that pus should be generated in wounds. No error can be greater\r\nthan this. Such a practice is indeed to hinder nature, to prolong the\r\ndisease, and to prevent the conglutination and consolidation of the\r\nwound\" was more than half a millennium ahead of his time. The italics in\r\nthe word modern are mine, but might well have been used by some early\r\nadvocate of antisepsis or even by Lord Lister himself. Just six\r\ncenturies almost to the year would separate the two declarations, yet\r\nthey would be just as true at one time as at another. When we learn that\r\nTheodoric was proud of the beautiful cicatrices which he obtained\r\nwithout the use of any ointment, _pulcherrimas cicatrices sine unguento\r\naliquo inducebat_, then further that he impugned the use of poultices\r\nand of oils on wounds, while powders were too drying and besides had a\r\ntendency to prevent drainage, the literal meaning of the Latin words\r\n_saniem incarcerare_ is to \"incarcerate sanious material,\" it is easy to\r\nunderstand that the claim that antiseptic surgery was anticipated six\r\ncenturies ago is no exaggeration and no far-fetched explanation with\r\nmodern ideas in mind of certain clever modes of dressing hit upon\r\naccidentally by medieval surgeons.\r\n\r\nTheodoric's treatment of many practical problems is interesting for the\r\nmodern time. For instance, in his discussion of cancer he says that\r\nthere are two forms of the affection. One of them is due to a\r\nmelancholy humor, a constitutional tendency as it were, and occurs\r\nespecially in the breasts of women or latent in the womb. This is\r\ndifficult of treatment and usually fatal. The other class consists of a\r\ndeep ulcer with undermined edges, occurring particularly on the legs,\r\ndifficult to cure and ready of relapse, but for which the outlook is not\r\nso bad. His description of _noli me tangere_ and of lupus is rather\r\npractical. Lupus is \"eating herpes,\" occurs mainly on the nose, or\r\naround the mouth, slowly increases, and either follows a preceding\r\nerysipelas or comes from some internal cause. _Noli me tangere_ is a\r\ncorroding ulcer, so called perhaps because irritation of it causes it to\r\nspread more rapidly. He thinks that deep cauterization of it is the best\r\ntreatment. Since these are in the department of skin diseases this seems\r\nthe place to mention that Theodoric describes salivation as occurring\r\nafter the use of mercury for certain skin diseases. He has already shown\r\nthat he knows of certain genital ulcers and sores on the genital regions\r\nand of distinctions between them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM OF SALICET\r\n\r\nThe third of the great surgeons in northern Italy was William of\r\nSalicet. He was a pupil of Bruno's and the master of Lanfranc. The first\r\npart of his life was passed at Bologna and the latter part as the\r\nmunicipal and hospital physician of Verona. He probably died about 1280.\r\nHe was a physician as well as a surgeon and was one of those who\r\ninsisted that the two modes of practising medicine should not be\r\nseparated, or if they were both medicine and surgery would suffer. He\r\nthought that the physician learned much by seeing the interior of the\r\nbody during life, while the surgeon was more conservative if he were a\r\nphysician. It is curiously interesting to find that the Regius\r\nProfessors at both Oxford and Cambridge in our time have expressed\r\nthemselves somewhat similarly. Professor Clifford Allbutt is quite\r\nemphatic in this matter and Professor Osler is on record to the same\r\neffect. Following Theodoric, William of Salicet did much to get away\r\nfrom the Arabic abuse of the cautery and brought the knife back to its\r\nproper place again as the ideal surgical instrument. Unlike those who\r\nhad written before him, William quoted very little from preceding\r\nwriters. Whenever he quotes his contemporaries it is in order to\r\ncriticise them. He depended on his own experience and considered that it\r\nwas only what he had actually learned from experience that he should\r\npublish for the benefit of others.\r\n\r\nA very good idea of the sort of surgery that William of Salicet\r\npractised may be obtained even from the beginning of the first chapter\r\nof his first book. This is all with regard to surgery of the head. He\r\nbegins with the treatment of hydrocephalus or, as he calls it, \"water\r\ncollected in the heads of children newly born.\" He rejects opening of\r\nthe head by an incision because of the danger of it. In a number of\r\ncases, however, he had had success by puncturing the scalp and membranes\r\nwith a cautery, though but a very small opening was made and the fluid\r\nwas allowed to escape only drop by drop. He then takes up eye diseases,\r\na department of surgery rather well developed at that time, as can be\r\nseen from our account of the work of Pope John XXI as an\r\nophthalmologist during the thirteenth century. See _Ophthalmology_\r\n(January, 1909), reprinted in \"Catholic Churchmen in Science,\"\r\nPhiladelphia, The Dolphin Press, 1909.\r\n\r\nWilliam devotes six chapters to the diseases of the eyes and the\r\neyelids. Then there are two chapters on affections of the ears. Foreign\r\nbodies and an accumulation of ear wax are removed by means of\r\ninstruments. A polyp is either cut off or its pedicle bound with a\r\nligature, and it is allowed to shrivel. The next chapter is on the nose.\r\nNasal polyps were to be grasped with a sharp tenaculum, _cum tenacillis\r\nacutis_, and either wholly or partially extracted. Ranula was treated by\r\nbeing lifted well forward by means of a sharp iron hook and then split\r\nwith a razor. It is evident that the tendency of these to fill up again\r\nwas recognized, and accordingly it was recommended that vitriol powder,\r\nor alum with salt, be placed in the cavity for a time after evacuation\r\nin order to produce adhesive inflammation.\r\n\r\nIn the same chapter on the mouth one finds that William did not hesitate\r\nto perform what cannot but be considered rather extensive operations\r\nwithin the oral cavity. For instance, he tells of removing a large\r\nepulis and gives an account in detail of the case. To quote his own\r\nwords: \"I cured a certain woman from Piacenza who was suffering from\r\nfleshy tumor on the gums of the upper jaw, the tumor having grown to\r\nsuch a size above the teeth and the gums that it was as large or perhaps\r\nlarger than a hen's egg. I removed it at four operations by means of\r\nheated iron instruments. At the last operation I removed the teeth that\r\nwere loose with certain parts of the jawbone.\"\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter there is an account of the treatment of a remarkable\r\ncase of abscess of the uvula. In the following chapter the swelling of\r\ncervical glands is taken up. In his experience expectant treatment of\r\nthese was best. He advises internal medication with the building up of\r\nthe general health, or suggests allowing the inflamed glands to empty\r\nthemselves after pustulation. After much meddlesome surgery we are\r\nalmost back to his methods again. He did not hesitate to treat goitre\r\nsurgically, though he considered there were certain internal remedies\r\nthat would benefit it. In obstinate cases he suggests the complete\r\nextirpation of cystic goitre, but if the sac is allowed to remain it\r\nshould be thoroughly rubbed over on the inside with green ointment. He\r\nwarns about the necessity for avoiding the veins and arteries in this\r\noperation, and says that \"in this affection many large veins make their\r\nappearance and they find their way everywhere through the fleshy mass.\"\r\n\r\nWhat I have given here is to be found in a little more than half a page\r\nof Gurlt's abstract of the first twenty chapters of Salicet's first\r\nbook. Altogether Gurlt has more than ten pages of rather small print\r\nwith regard to William; most of it is as interesting and as practical\r\nand as representative of anticipations of what is done in the modern\r\ntime as what I have here quoted. William, as I have said, depended much\r\nmore upon his own experience than upon what was to be found in\r\ntext-books. He knew the old text-books very well however, but as a rule\r\ndid not quote from them unless he had tried the recommendations for\r\nhimself, or unless similar cases to these mentioned had come under his\r\nown observation. He was evidently a thoroughly observant physician, a\r\nskilled surgeon who was practical enough to see the simplest way to do\r\nthings, and he proceeded to do them. It is no wonder that he influenced\r\nsucceeding generations so much, nor that his great pupil, Lanfranc,\r\ncontinuing his tradition, founded a school of surgery in Paris, the\r\ninfluence of which was to endure almost down to our time, and give\r\nFrance a primacy in surgery until the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANFRANC\r\n\r\nAfter Salicet's lifetime the focus of interest in surgery changes from\r\nItaly to France, and what is still more complimentary to William, it is\r\nthrough a favorite disciple of his that the change takes place. This was\r\nLanfranchi, or Lanfranco, sometimes spoken of as Alanfrancus, who\r\npractised as physician and surgeon in Milan until banished from there by\r\nMatteo Visconti about 1290. He then went to Lyons, where in the course\r\nof his practice he attracted so much attention that he was offered the\r\nopportunity to teach surgery in Paris. He attracted what Gurlt calls an\r\nalmost incredible number of scholars to his lessons in Paris, and by\r\nhundreds they accompanied him to the bedside of his patients and\r\nattended his operations. The dean of the medical faculty, Jean de\r\nPassavant, urged him to write a text-book of surgery, not only for the\r\nbenefit of his students at Paris but for the sake of the prestige which\r\nthis would confer on the medical school. Deans still urge the same\r\nreasons for writing. Lanfranc completed his surgery, called \"Chirurgia\r\nMagna,\" in 1296, and dedicated it to Philippe le Bel, the then reigning\r\nFrench King. Ten years later he died, but in the meantime he had\r\ntransferred Italian prestige in surgery from Italy to France and laid\r\nthe foundations in Paris of a thoroughly scientific as well as a\r\npractical surgery, though this department of the medical school had been\r\nin a sadly backward state when he came.\r\n\r\nIn the second chapter of this text-book, the first containing the\r\ndefinition of surgery and general introduction, Lanfranc describes the\r\nqualities that in his opinion a surgeon should possess. He says, \"It is\r\nnecessary that a surgeon should have a temperate and moderate\r\ndisposition. That he should have well-formed hands, long slender\r\nfingers, a strong body, not inclined to tremble and with all his members\r\ntrained to the capable fulfilment of the wishes of his mind. He should\r\nbe of deep intelligence and of a simple, humble, brave, but not\r\naudacious disposition. He should be well grounded in natural science,\r\nand should know not only medicine but every part of philosophy; should\r\nknow logic well, so as to be able to understand what is written, to talk\r\nproperly, and to support what he has to say by good reasons.\" He\r\nsuggests that it would be well for the surgeon to have spent some time\r\nteaching grammar and dialectics and rhetoric, especially if he is to\r\nteach others in surgery, for this practice will add greatly to his\r\nteaching power. Some of his expressions might well be repeated to young\r\nsurgeons in the modern time. \"The surgeon should not love difficult\r\ncases and should not allow himself to be tempted to undertake those that\r\nare desperate. He should help the poor as far as he can, but he should\r\nnot hesitate to ask for good fees from the rich.\"\r\n\r\nMany generations since Lanfranc's time have used the word nerves for\r\ntendons. Lanfranc, however, made no such mistake. He says that the\r\nwounds of nerves, since the nerve is an instrument of sense and motion,\r\nare, on account of the greater sensitiveness which these structures\r\npossess, likely to involve much pain. Wounds along the length of the\r\nnerves are less dangerous than those across them. When a nerve is\r\ncompletely divided by a cross wound Lanfranc is of the opinion, though\r\nTheodoric and some others are opposed to it, that the nerve ends should\r\nbe stitched together. He says that this suture insures the\r\nredintegration of the nerve much better. After this operation the\r\nrestoration of the usefulness of the member is more complete and\r\nassured.\r\n\r\nHis description of the treatment of the bite of a rabid dog is\r\ninteresting. A large cupping glass should be applied over the wound so\r\nas to draw out as much blood as possible. After this the wound should be\r\ndilated and thoroughly cauterized to its depths with a hot iron. It\r\nshould then be covered with various substances that were supposed to\r\ndraw, in order as far as possible to remove the poison. His description\r\nof how one may recognize a rabid animal is rather striking in the light\r\nof our present knowledge, for he seems to have realized that the main\r\ndiagnostic element is a change in the disposition of the animal, but\r\nabove all a definite tendency to lack playfulness. Lanfranc had seen a\r\nnumber of cases of true rabies, and describes and suggests treatment for\r\nthem, though evidently without very much confidence in the success of\r\nthe treatment.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of snake bites and the bites of other poisonous animals\r\nwas supposed to follow the principles laid down for the bite of a mad\r\ndog, especially as regards the encouragement of free bleeding and the\r\nuse of the cautery.\r\n\r\nLanfranc has many other expressions that one is tempted to quote,\r\nbecause they show a thinking surgeon of the old time, anticipating many\r\nsupposedly modern ideas and conclusions. He is a particular favorite of\r\nGurlt's, who has more than twenty-five large octavo, closely printed\r\npages with regard to him. There is scarcely any development in our\r\nmodern surgery that Lanfranc has not at least a hint of, certainly\r\nnothing in the surgery of a generation ago that does not find a mention\r\nin his book. On most subjects he has practical observations from his own\r\nexperience to add to what was in surgical literature before his time. He\r\nquotes altogether more than a score of writers on surgery who had\r\npreceded him and evidently was thoroughly familiar with general surgical\r\nliterature. There is scarcely an important surgical topic on which Gurlt\r\ndoes not find some interesting and personal remarks made by Lanfranc.\r\nAll that we can do here is refer those who are interested in Lanfranc to\r\nhis own works or Gurlt.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDEVILLE\r\n\r\nThe next of the important surgeons who were to bring such distinction to\r\nFrench surgery for five centuries was Henri de Mondeville. Writers\r\nusually quote him as Henricus. His latter name is only the place of his\r\nbirth, which was probably not far from Caen in Normandy. It is spelled\r\nin so many different ways, however, by different writers that it is well\r\nto realize that almost anything that looks like Mondeville probably\r\nrefers to him. Such variants as Mundeville, Hermondaville, Amondaville,\r\nAmundaville, Amandaville, Mandeville, Armandaville, Armendaville,\r\nAmandavilla occur. We owe a large amount of our information with regard\r\nto him to Professor Pagel, who issued the first edition of his book ever\r\npublished (Berlin, 1892). It may seem surprising that Mondeville's work\r\nshould have been left thus long without publication, but unfortunately\r\nhe did not live long enough to finish it. He was one of the victims that\r\ntuberculosis claimed among physicians in the midst of their work. Though\r\nthere are a great number of manuscript copies of his book, somehow\r\nRenaissance interest in it in its incompleted state was never aroused\r\nsufficiently to bring about a printed edition. Certainly it was not\r\nbecause of any lack of interest on the part of his contemporaries or any\r\nlack of significance in the work itself, for its printing has been one\r\nof the surprises afforded us in the modern time as showing how\r\nthoroughly a great writer on surgery did his work at the beginning of\r\nthe fourteenth century. Gurlt, in his \"History of Surgery,\" has given\r\nover forty pages, much of it small type, with regard to Mondeville,\r\nbecause of the special interest there is in his writing.[20]\r\n\r\nHis life is of particular interest for other reasons besides his\r\nsubsequent success as a surgeon. He was another of the university men of\r\nthis time who wandered far for opportunities in education. Though born\r\nin the north of France and receiving his preliminary education there, he\r\nmade his medical studies towards the end of the thirteenth century under\r\nTheodoric in Italy. Afterwards he studied medicine in Montpellier and\r\nsurgery in Paris. Later he gave at least one course of lectures at\r\nMontpellier himself and a series of lectures in Paris, attracting to\r\nboth universities during his professorship a crowd of students from\r\nevery part of Europe. One of his teachers at Paris had been his\r\ncompatriot, Jean Pitard, the surgeon of Philippe le Bel, of whom he\r\nspeaks as \"most skilful and expert in the art of surgery,\" and it was\r\ndoubtless to Pitard's friendship that he owed his appointment as one of\r\nthe four surgeons and three physicians who accompanied the King into\r\nFlanders.\r\n\r\nBesides his lectures, Mondeville had a large consultant practice and\r\nalso had to accompany the King on his campaigns. This made it extremely\r\ndifficult for him to keep continuously at the writing of his book. It\r\nwas delayed in spite of his good intentions, and we have the picture\r\nthat is so familiar in the modern time of a busy man trying to steal or\r\nmake time for his writing. Unfortunately, in addition to other\r\nobstacles, Mondeville showed probably before he was forty the first\r\nsymptoms of a serious pulmonary disease, presumably tuberculosis. He\r\nbravely fought it and went on with his work. As his end approached he\r\nsketched in lightly what he had hoped to treat much more formally, and\r\nthen turned to what was to have been the last chapter of his book, the\r\nAntidotarium or suggestions of practical remedies against diseases of\r\nvarious kinds because his students and physician friends were urging him\r\nto complete this portion for them. We of the modern time are much less\r\ninterested in that than we would have been in some of the portions of\r\nthe work that Mondeville neglected in order to provide therapeutic hints\r\nfor his disciples. But then the students and young physicians have\r\nalways clamored for the practical--which so far at least in medical\r\nhistory has always proved of only passing interest.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that at this time surgery was mainly in the hands of\r\nbarbers and the ignorant. Henri de Mondeville, however, is a striking\r\nexample in contradiction of this. He must have had a fine preliminary\r\neducation and his book shows very wide reading. There is almost no one\r\nof any importance who seriously touched upon medicine or surgery before\r\nhis time whom Mondeville does not quote. Hippocrates, Aristotle,\r\nDioscorides, Pliny, Galen, Rhazes, Ali Abbas, Abulcasis, Avicenna,\r\nConstantine Africanus, Averroes, Maimonides, Albertus Magnus, Hugo of\r\nLucca, Theodoric, William of Salicet, Lanfranc are all quoted, and not\r\nonce or twice but many times. Besides he has quotations from the poets\r\nand philosophers, Cato, Diogenes, Horace, Ovid, Plato, Seneca, and\r\nothers. He was a learned man, devoting himself to surgery.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder, then, that he thought that a surgeon should be a\r\nscholar, and that he needed to know much more than a physician. One of\r\nhis characteristic passages is that in which he declares \"it is\r\nimpossible that a surgeon should be expert who does not know not only\r\nthe principles, but everything worth while knowing about medicine,\" and\r\nthen he added, \"just as it is impossible for a man to be a good\r\nphysician who is entirely ignorant of the art of surgery.\" He says\r\nfurther: \"This our art of surgery, which is the third part of medicine\r\n(the other two parts were diet and drugs), is, with all due reverence to\r\nphysicians, considered by us surgeons ourselves and by the non-medical\r\nas a more certain, nobler, securer, more perfect, more necessary, and\r\nmore lucrative art than the other parts of medicine.\" Surgeons have\r\nalways been prone to glory in their specialty.\r\n\r\nMondeville had a high idea of the training that a surgeon should\r\npossess. He says: \"A surgeon who wishes to operate regularly ought first\r\nfor a long time to frequent places in which skilled surgeons operate\r\noften, and he ought to pay careful attention to their operations and\r\ncommit their technique to memory. Then he ought to associate himself\r\nwith them in doing operations. A man cannot be a good surgeon unless he\r\nknows both the art and science of medicine and especially anatomy. The\r\ncharacteristics of a good surgeon are that he should be moderately bold,\r\nnot given to disputations before those who do not know medicine, operate\r\nwith foresight and wisdom, not beginning dangerous operations until he\r\nhas provided himself with everything necessary for lessening the danger.\r\nHe should have well-shaped members, especially hands with long, slender\r\nfingers, mobile and not tremulous, and with all his members strong and\r\nhealthy so that he may perform all the good operations without\r\ndisturbance of mind. He must be highly moral, should care for the poor\r\nfor God's sake, see that he makes himself well paid by the rich, should\r\ncomfort his patients by pleasant discourse, and should always accede to\r\ntheir requests if these do not interfere with the cure of the disease.\"\r\n\"It follows from this,\" he says, \"that the perfect surgeon is more than\r\nthe perfect physician, and that while he must know medicine he must in\r\naddition know his handicraft.\"\r\n\r\nThinking thus, it is no wonder that he places his book under as noble\r\npatronage as possible. He says in the preface that he \"began to write it\r\nfor the honor and praise of Christ Jesus, of the Virgin Mary, of the\r\nSaints and Martyrs, Cosmas and Damian, and of King Philip of France as\r\nwell as his four children, and on the proposal and request of Master\r\nWilliam of Briscia, distinguished professor in the science of medicine\r\nand formerly physician to Pope Boniface IV and Benedict and Clement, the\r\npresent Pope.\" His first book on anatomy he proposed to found on that of\r\nAvicenna and \"on his personal experience as he has seen it.\" The second\r\ntractate on the treatments of wounds, contusions, and ulcers was founded\r\non the second book of Theodoric \"with whatever by recent study has been\r\nnewly acquired and brought to light through the experience of modern\r\nphysicians.\" He then confesses his obligations to his great master, John\r\nPitard, and adds that all the experience that he has gained while\r\noperating, studying, and lecturing for many years on surgery will be\r\nmade use of in order to enhance the value of the work. He hopes,\r\nhowever, to accomplish all this \"briefly, quietly, and above all,\r\ncharitably.\" There are many things in the preface that show us the\r\nreason for Mondeville's popularity, for they exhibit him as very\r\nsympathetically human in his interests.\r\n\r\nWhile Mondeville is devoted to the principle that authority is of great\r\nvalue, he said that there was nothing perfect in things human, and\r\nsuccessive generations of younger men often made important additions to\r\nwhat their ancestors had left them. While his work is largely a\r\ncompilation, nearly everywhere it shows signs of the modification of his\r\npredecessors' opinions by the results of his own experience. His method\r\nof writing is, as Pagel declares, \"always interesting, lively, and often\r\nfull of meat.\" He had a teacher's instinct, for in several of the\r\nearlier manuscripts his special teaching is put in larger letters in\r\norder to attract students' attention.... He seems to have introduced or\r\nre-introduced into practice the idea of the use of a large magnet in\r\norder to extract portions of iron from the tissues. He made several\r\nmodifications in needles and thread holders and invented a kind of\r\nsmall derrick for the extraction of arrows with barbs. Besides, he\r\nsuggested the surrounding of the barbs of the arrows with tubes, to\r\nfacilitate extraction. In his treatment of wounds, Pagel considers that\r\nas a writer and teacher he is far ahead of his predecessors and even of\r\nthose who came after him in immediately subsequent generations. One of\r\nhis great merits undoubtedly is that Guy de Chauliac, the father of\r\nmodern surgery, in his text-book turned to him with a confidence that\r\nproclaims his admiration and how much he felt that he had gained from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features of Mondeville's work is his\r\ninsistence on the influence of the mind on the body and the importance\r\nof using this influence to the best advantage. It is especially\r\nimportant in Mondeville's opinion to keep a surgical patient from being\r\nmoody. \"Let the surgeon,\" says he, \"take care to regulate the whole\r\nregimen of the patient's life for joy and happiness by promising that he\r\nwill soon be well, by allowing his relatives and special friends to\r\ncheer him and by having someone to tell him jokes, and let him be\r\nsolaced also by music on the viol or psaltery. The surgeon must forbid\r\nanger, hatred, and sadness in the patient, and remind him that the body\r\ngrows fat from joy and thin from sadness. He must insist on the patient\r\nobeying him faithfully in all things.\" He repeats with approval the\r\nexpression of Avicenna that \"often the confidence of the patient in his\r\nphysician does more for the cure of his disease than the physician with\r\nall his remedies.\" Obstinate and conceited patients prone to object to\r\nnearly everything that the surgeon wants to do, and who often seem to\r\nthink that they surpass Galen and Hippocrates in science and wisdom, are\r\nlikely to delay their cure very much, and they represent the cases with\r\nwhich the surgeon has much difficulty.\r\n\r\nMondeville thought that nursing was extremely important and that without\r\nit surgery often failed of its purpose. He says, \"For if the assistants\r\nare not solicitous and faithful, and obedient to the surgeons in each\r\nand every thing which may make for the cure of the disease, they put\r\nobstacles and difficulties in the way of the surgeon.\" It is especially\r\nimportant that the patient's nutrition should be cared for and that the\r\nbandages should be managed exactly as the surgeon directs. He has no use\r\nfor garrulous, talkative nurses, and does not hesitate to say that\r\nsometimes near relatives are particularly likely to disturb patients.\r\n\"Especially are they prone to let drop some hint of bad news which the\r\nsurgeon may have revealed to them in secret, or even the reports that\r\nthey may hear from others, friends or enemies, and this provokes the\r\npatient to anger or anxiety and is likely to give him fever. If the\r\nassistants quarrel among themselves, or are heard murmuring, or if they\r\ndraw long faces, all of these things will disturb the patients and\r\nproduce worry and anxiety or fear. The surgeon therefore must be careful\r\nin the selection of his nurses, for some of them obey very well while he\r\nis present, but do as they like and often just exactly the opposite of\r\nwhat he has directed when he is away.\"\r\n\r\nWe do not know enough of the details of Mondeville's life to be sure\r\nwhether he was married or not. It is probable that he was not, for all\r\nof these surgeons of the thirteenth century before Mondeville's time,\r\nTheodoric, William of Salicet, Lanfranc, and Guy de Chauliac, after him\r\nbelonged to the clerical order; Theodoric was a bishop; the others,\r\nhowever, seem only to have been in minor orders. It is therefore from\r\nthe standpoint of a man who views married life from without that\r\nMondeville makes his remarks as to the difficulty often encountered when\r\nwives nurse their husbands. He says that the surgeon has difficulty\r\noftener when husbands or wives care for their spouses than at other\r\ntimes. This is much more likely to take place when the wives are caring\r\nfor the husbands. \"In our days,\" he says, \"in this Gallican part of the\r\nworld, wives rule their husbands, and the men for the most part permit\r\nthemselves to be ruled. Whatever a surgeon may order for the cure of a\r\nhusband then will often seem to the wives to be a waste of good\r\nmaterial, though the men seem to be quite willing to get anything that\r\nmay be ordered for the cure of their wives. The whole cause of this\r\nseems to be that every woman seems to think that her husband is not as\r\ngood as those of other women whom she sees around her.\" It would be\r\ninteresting to know how Mondeville was brought to a conclusion so\r\ndifferent from modern experience in the matter.\r\n\r\nFor those who are particularly interested in medical history one of the\r\nsections of Henry's book has a special appeal, because he gives in it a\r\nsketch of the history of surgery. We are little likely to think, as a\r\nrule, that at this time, full two centuries before the close of the\r\nMiddle Ages, men were interested enough in the doings of those who had\r\ngone before them to try to trace the history of the development of their\r\nspecialty. It is characteristic of the way that the scholarly Mondeville\r\nviews his own life work that he should have wanted to know something\r\nabout his predecessors and teach others with regard to them. He begins\r\nwith Galen, and as Galen divides the famous physicians of the world into\r\nthree sects, the Methodists, the Empirics, and the Rationalists, so\r\nMondeville divides modern surgery into three sects: first, that of the\r\nSalernitans, with Roger, Roland, and the Four Masters; second, that of\r\nWilliam of Salicet and Lanfranc; and third, that of Hugo de Lucca and\r\nhis brother Theodoric and their modern disciples. He states briefly the\r\ncharacteristics of these three sects. The first limited patients' diet,\r\nused no stimulants, dilated all wounds, and got union only after pus\r\nformation. The second allowed a liberal diet to weak patients, though\r\nnot to the strong, but generally interfered with wounds too much. The\r\nthird believed in a liberal diet, never dilated wounds, never inserted\r\ntents, and its members were extremely careful not to complicate wounds\r\nof the head by unwise interference. His critical discussion of the three\r\nschools is extremely interesting.\r\n\r\nAnother phase of Mondeville's work that is sympathetic to the moderns is\r\nhis discussion of the irregular practice of medicine and surgery as it\r\nexisted in his time. Most of our modern medicine and surgery was\r\nanticipated in the olden time; but it may be said that all of the modes\r\nof the quack are as old as humanity. Galen's description of the\r\ntravelling charlatan who settled down in his front yard, not knowing\r\nthat it belonged to a physician, shows this very well. There were\r\nevidently as many of them and as many different kinds in Mondeville's\r\ntime as in our own. In discussing the opposition that had arisen between\r\nphysicians and surgeons in his time and their failure to realize that\r\nthey were both members of a great profession, he enumerates the many\r\ndifferent kinds of opponents that the medical profession had. There were\r\n\"barbers, soothsayers, loan agents, falsifiers, alchemists, meretrices,\r\nmidwives, old women, converted Jews, Saracens, and indeed most of those\r\nwho, having wasted their substance foolishly, now proceed to make\r\nphysicians or surgeons of themselves in order to make their living under\r\nthe cloak of healing.\"\r\n\r\nWhat surprises Mondeville however, as it has always surprised every\r\nphysician who knows the situation, is that so many educated, or at least\r\nsupposedly well-informed people of the better classes, indeed even of\r\nthe so-called best classes, allow themselves to be influenced by these\r\nquacks. And it is even more surprising to him that so many well-to-do,\r\nintelligent people should, for no reason, though without knowledge,\r\npresume to give advice in medical matters and especially in even\r\ndangerous surgical diseases, and in such delicate affections as diseases\r\nof the eyes. \"It thus often happens that diseases in themselves curable\r\ngrow to be simply incurable or are made much worse than they were\r\nbefore.\" He says that some of the clergymen of his time seemed to think\r\nthat a knowledge of medicine is infused into them with the sacrament of\r\nHoly Orders. He was himself probably a clergyman, and I have in the\r\nmodern time more than once known of teachers in the clerical seminaries\r\nemphasizing this same idea for the clerical students. It is very evident\r\nthat the world has not changed very much, and that to know any time\r\nreasonably well is to find in it comments on the morning paper. We are\r\nin the midst of just such a series of interferences with medicine on the\r\npart of the clergy as this wise, common-sense surgeon of the thirteenth\r\ncentury deprecated.\r\n\r\nIn every way Mondeville had the instincts of a teacher. He took\r\nadvantage of every aid. He was probably the first to use illustrations\r\nin teaching anatomy. Guy de Chauliac, whose teacher in anatomy for some\r\ntime Mondeville was, says in the first chapter of his \"Chirurgia Magna\"\r\nthat pictures do not suffice for the teaching of anatomy and that actual\r\ndissection is necessary. The passage runs as follows: \"In the bodies of\r\nmen, of apes, and of pigs, and of many other animals, tissues should be\r\nstudied by dissections and not by pictures, as did Henricus, who was\r\nseen to demonstrate anatomy with thirteen pictures.\"[21] What Chauliac\r\nblames is the attempt to replace dissections by pictorial\r\ndemonstrations. Hyrtl, however, suggests that this invention of\r\nMondeville's was probably very helpful, and was brought about by the\r\nimpossibility of preserving bodies for long periods as well as the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining them.\r\n\r\n\r\nYPERMAN\r\n\r\nOne of the maxims of the old Greek philosophers was that good is\r\ndiffusive of itself. As the scholastics put it, _bonum est diffusivum\r\nsui_. This proved to be eminently true of the old universities also, and\r\nespecially of their training in medicine and in surgery. We have the\r\naccounts of men from many nations who went to the universities and\r\nreturned to benefit their own people. Early in the thirteenth century\r\nRichard the Englishman was in Italy, having previously been in Paris and\r\nprobably at Montpellier. Bernard Gordon, probably also an Englishman,\r\nwas one of the great lights in medicine down at Montpellier, and his\r\nbook, \"Lilium De Medicina,\" is well known. Two distinguished surgeons\r\nwhose names have come down to us, having studied in Paris after Lanfranc\r\nhad created the tradition of great surgical teaching there, came to\r\ntheir homes to be centres of beneficent influence among their people in\r\nthis matter. One was Yperman, of the town of Ypres in Belgium; the other\r\nArdern of England. Yperman was sent by his fellow-townsmen to Paris in\r\norder to study surgery, because they wanted to have a good surgeon in\r\ntheir town and Paris seemed the best school at that time. Ypres was at\r\nthis period one of the greatest commercial cities of Europe, and\r\nprobably had a couple of hundred thousand inhabitants. The great hall of\r\nthe cloth gild, which has been such an attraction for visitors ever\r\nsince, was built shortly before the town determined upon the very\r\nsensible procedure of securing good surgery beyond all doubt by having a\r\ntownsman specially educated for that purpose.\r\n\r\nYperman's work was practically unknown to us until Broeck, the Belgian\r\nhistorian, discovered manuscript copies of his book on surgery and\r\ngathered some details of his life. After his return from Paris, Yperman\r\nobtained great renown, which maintained itself in the custom extant in\r\nthat part of the country even yet of calling an expert surgeon an\r\nYperman. He is the author of two works in Flemish. One of these is a\r\nsmaller compendium of internal medicine, which is very interesting,\r\nhowever, because it shows the many subjects that were occupying\r\nphysicians' minds at that time. He treats of dropsy, rheumatism, under\r\nwhich occur the terms coryza and catarrh (the flowing diseases),\r\nicterus, phthisis (he calls the tuberculosis, tysiken), apoplexy,\r\nepilepsy, frenzy, lethargy, fallen palate, cough, shortness of breath,\r\nlung abscess, hemorrhage, blood-spitting, liver abscess, hardening of\r\nthe spleen, affections of the kidney, bloody urine, diabetes,\r\nincontinence of urine, dysuria, strangury, gonorrhea, and involuntary\r\nseminal emissions--all these terms are quoted directly from Pagel's\r\naccount of his work; the original is not available in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ARDERN\r\n\r\nIn English-speaking countries of course we are interested in what was\r\ndone by Englishmen at this time. Fortunately we have the record of one\r\ngreat English surgeon of the period worthy to be placed beside even the\r\nwriters already mentioned. This is John Ardern, whose name is probably a\r\nmodification of the more familiar Arden, whose career well deserves\r\nattention. I have given a sketch of his work in \"The Popes and\r\nScience.\"[22] He was educated at Montpellier, and practised surgery for\r\na time in France. About the middle of the century however, according to\r\nPagel, he went back to his native land and settled for some twenty years\r\nat Newark, in Nottinghamshire, and then for nearly thirty years longer,\r\nuntil about the end of the century, was in London. He is the chief\r\nrepresentative of English surgery during the Middle Ages. His\r\n\"Practica,\" as yet unprinted, contains, according to Pagel, a short\r\nsketch of internal medicine, but is mainly devoted to surgery. Contrary\r\nto the usual impression with regard to works in medicine and surgery at\r\nthis time, the book abounds in references to case histories which Ardern\r\nhad gathered, partly from his own and partly from others' experience.\r\nThe therapeutic measures that he suggests are usually very simple, in\r\nthe majority of cases quite rational, though, of course, there are many\r\nsuperstitions among them; but Ardern always furnished a number of\r\nsuggestions from which to choose. He must have been an expert operator,\r\nand had excellent success in the treatment of diseases of the rectum. He\r\nseems to have been the first operator who made careful statistics of his\r\ncases, and was quite as proud as any modern surgeon of the large\r\nnumbers that he had operated on, which he gives very exactly. He was the\r\ninventor of a new clyster apparatus.\r\n\r\nFortunately we possess here in America, in the Surgeon General's Library\r\nat Washington, a very interesting manuscript containing Ardern's\r\nsurgical writings, though it has not yet been published. Even a little\r\nstudy of this and of the notes on it prepared by an English bibliophile\r\nbefore its purchase by the Surgeon General's Library, serves to show how\r\nvaluable the work is in the history of surgery. There are illustrations\r\nscarcely less interesting than the text. Some of these illustrations\r\nwere inserted by the original writer or copyist, and some of them later.\r\nIn general, however, they show a rather high development of the\r\nmechanics of surgery at that time. Some of the pages have spaces for\r\nillustrations left unfilled, so that evidently the copyist did not\r\ncomplete his work. The titles of certain of the chapters are\r\ninteresting, as illustrating the fact that our medical and surgical\r\nproblems were stated clearly in the olden time, and thinking physicians,\r\neven six centuries ago, met them quite rationally. There is, for\r\ninstance, a chapter headed \"Against Colic and the Iliac Passion,\"\r\nimmediately followed by the subheading, \"Method of Administering\r\nClysters.\" The iliac passion, _passio iliaca_ of the old Latin, is\r\nusually taken to signify some obstruction of the intestines causing\r\nsevere pain, vomiting, and eventually fecal vomiting. A good many\r\ndifferent forms of severe painful conditions, especially all those\r\ncomplicated by peritonitis, were included under the term, and the modern\r\nstudent of surgery is likely to wonder whether these old observers had\r\nnot noted that the right iliac region was particularly prone to be the\r\nsource of fatal conditions. There is a chapter entitled \"Against Pain in\r\nthe Loins and the Kidneys,\" followed by the chapter subheading, \"Against\r\nStone in the Kidneys.\" There is a chapter with the title, \"Against\r\nUlceration of the Bladder or the Kidneys.\" Another one, with the title\r\n\"Against Burning of the Urine and Excoriation of the Lower Part of the\r\nYard.\" Gonorrhea is frankly treated under the name _Shawdepisse_,\r\nevidently an English alliteration of the corresponding French word. As\r\nto the instrumentation of such conditions and for probing in general,\r\nArdern suggests the use of a lead probe, because it may readily be made\r\nto bend any way and not injure the tissues.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDIEVAL SURGERY\r\n\r\nEven this brief account of the surgeons who taught and studied at the\r\nmedieval universities demonstrates what fine work they did. It is surely\r\nnot too much to say that the chapter on university education mainly\r\nconcerned with them is one of the most interesting in the whole history\r\nof the universities. Their story alone is quite enough to refute most of\r\nthe prevalent impressions and patronizing expressions with regard to\r\nmedieval education. Their careers serve to show how interested were the\r\nmen of many nations in the development of an extremely important\r\napplication of science for the benefit of suffering humanity. Their work\r\nutterly contradicts the idea so frequently emphasized that the great\r\nstudents of the Middle Ages were lacking in practicalness. Besides,\r\nthey make very clear that we have been prone to judge the Middle Ages\r\ntoo much from its speculative philosophies. It has been the custom to\r\nsay that speculation ruled men's minds and prevented them from making\r\nobservations, developing science, or applying scientific principles.\r\nThere was much speculation during the Middle Ages, but probably not any\r\nmore in proportion than exists at the present day. We were either not\r\nacquainted with, or failed to appreciate properly, until comparatively\r\nrecent years, the other side of medieval accomplishment. Our ignorance\r\nled us into misunderstanding of what these generations really did. It\r\nwas our own fault, because during the Renaissance practically all of\r\nthese books were edited and printed under the direction of the great\r\nscholars of the time in fine editions, but during the eighteenth century\r\nnearly all interest was lost in them, and we are only now beginning to\r\nget back a certain amount of the precious knowledge that they had in the\r\nRenaissance period of this other side of medieval life. We have learned\r\nso much about surgery because distinguished scholars devoted themselves\r\nto this phase of the history of science. Doubtless there are many other\r\nphases of the history of science which suffered the same fate of neglect\r\nand with regard to which the future will bring us equally startling\r\nrevelations. For this reason this marvellous chapter in the history of\r\nsurgery is a warning as well as a startling record of a marvellous epoch\r\nof human progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nGUY DE CHAULIAC\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting characters in the history of medieval\r\nmedicine, and undoubtedly the most important and significant of these\r\nOld-Time Makers of Medicine, is Guy de Chauliac. Most of the false\r\nnotions so commonly accepted with regard to the Middle Ages at once\r\ndisappear after a careful study of his career. The idea of the careful\r\napplication of scientific principles in a great practical way is far\r\nremoved from the ordinary notion of medieval procedure. Some\r\nobservations we may concede that they did make, but we are inclined to\r\nthink that these were not regularly ordered and the lessons of them not\r\ndrawn so as to make them valuable as experiences. Great art men may have\r\nhad, but science and, above all, applied science, is a later development\r\nof humanity. Particularly is this supposed to be true with regard to the\r\nscience and practice of surgery, which is assumed to be of comparatively\r\nrecent origin. Nothing could well be less true, and if the thoroughly\r\npractical development of surgery may be taken as a symbol of how capable\r\nmen were of applying science and scientific principles, then it is\r\ncomparatively easy to show that the men of the later Middle Ages were\r\noccupied very much as have been our recent generations with science and\r\nits practical applications.\r\n\r\nThe immediate evidence of the value of old-time surgery is to be found\r\nin the fact that Guy de Chauliac, who is commonly spoken of in the\r\nhistory of medicine as the Father of Modern Surgery, lived his\r\nseventy-odd years of life during the fourteenth century and accomplished\r\nthe best of his work, therefore, some five centuries before surgery in\r\nour modern sense of the term is supposed to have developed. A glance at\r\nhis career, however, will show how old are most of the important\r\ndevelopments of surgery, as also in what a thoroughly scientific temper\r\nof mind this subject was approached more than a century before the close\r\nof the Middle Ages. The life of this French surgeon, indeed, who was a\r\ncleric and occupied the position of chamberlain and\r\nphysician-in-ordinary to three of the Avignon Popes, is not only a\r\ncontradiction of many of the traditions as to the backwardness of our\r\nmedieval forbears in medicine, that are readily accepted by many\r\npresumably educated people, but it is the best possible antidote for\r\nthat insistent misunderstanding of the Middle Ages which attributes\r\nprofound ignorance of science, almost complete failure of observation,\r\nand an absolute lack of initiative in applications of science to the men\r\nof those times.\r\n\r\nGuy de Chauliac's life is modern in nearly every phase. He was educated\r\nin a little town of the south of France, made his medical studies at\r\nMontpellier, and then went on a journey of hundreds of miles into Italy,\r\nin order to make his post-graduate studies. Italy occupied the place in\r\nscience at that time that Germany has taken during the nineteenth\r\ncentury. A young man who wanted to get into touch with the great\r\nmasters in medicine naturally went down into the Peninsula. Traditions\r\nas to the attitude of the Church to science notwithstanding, Italy where\r\neducation was more completely under the influence of the Popes and\r\necclesiastics than in any other country in Europe, continued to be the\r\nhome of post-graduate work in science for the next four centuries.\r\nAlmost needless to say, the journey to Italy was more difficult of\r\naccomplishment and involved more expense and time than would even the\r\nvoyage from America to Europe in our time. Chauliac realized, however,\r\nthat both time and expense would be well rewarded, and his ardor for the\r\nrounding out of his education was amply recompensed by the event. Nor\r\nhave we any reason for thinking that what he did was very rare, much\r\nless unique, in his time. Many a student from France, Germany, and\r\nEngland made the long journey to Italy for post-graduate opportunities\r\nduring the later Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nEven this post-graduate experience in Italy did not satisfy Chauliac,\r\nhowever, for, after having studied several years with the most\r\ndistinguished Italian teachers of anatomy and surgery, he spent some\r\ntime in Paris, apparently so as to be sure that he would be acquainted\r\nwith the best that was being done in his specialty in every part of the\r\nworld. He then settled down to his own life work, carrying his Italian\r\nand French masters' teachings well beyond the point where he received\r\nthem, and after years of personal experience he gathered together his\r\nmasters' ideas, tested by his own observations, into his \"Chirurgia\r\nMagna,\" a great text-book of surgery which sums up the whole subject\r\nsuccinctly, yet completely, for succeeding generations. When we talk\r\nabout what he accomplished for surgery, we are not dependent on\r\ntraditions nor vague information gleaned from contemporaries and\r\nsuccessors, who might perhaps have been so much impressed by his\r\npersonality as to be made over-enthusiastic in their critical judgment\r\nof him. We know the man in his surgical works, and they have continued\r\nto be classics in surgery ever since. It is an honorable distinction for\r\nthe medicine of the later fourteenth, the fifteenth, and sixteenth\r\ncenturies that Guy de Chauliac's book was the most read volume of the\r\ntime in medicine. Evidently the career of such a man is of import, not\r\nalone to physicians, but to all who are interested in the history of\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nChauliac derives his name from the little town of Chauliac in the\r\ndiocese of Mende, almost in the centre of what is now the department of\r\nLozere. The records of births and deaths were not considered so\r\nimportant in the fourteenth century as they are now, and so we are not\r\nsure of either in the case of Chauliac. It is usually considered that he\r\nwas born some time during the last decade of the thirteenth century,\r\nprobably toward the end of it, and that he died about 1370. Of his early\r\neducation we know nothing, but it must have been reasonably efficient,\r\nsince it gave him a good working knowledge of Latin, which was the\r\nuniversal language of science and especially of medicine at that time;\r\nand though his own style, as must be expected, is no better than that of\r\nhis contemporaries, he knew how to express his thoughts clearly in\r\nstraightforward Latin, with only such a mixture of foreign terms as his\r\nstudies suggested and the exigencies of a new development of science\r\nalmost required. Later in life he seems to have known Arabic very well,\r\nfor he is evidently familiar with Arabian books and does not depend\r\nmerely on translations of them.\r\n\r\nPagel, in the first volume of Puschmann's \"Handbook of the History of\r\nMedicine,\" says, on the authority of Nicaise and others, that Chauliac\r\nreceived his early education from the village clergyman. His parents\r\nwere poor, and but for ecclesiastical interest in him it would have been\r\ndifficult for him to obtain his education. The Church supplied at that\r\ntime to a great extent for the foundations and scholarships, home and\r\ntravelling, of our day, and Chauliac was amongst the favored ones. How\r\nwell he deserved the favor his subsequent career shows, as it completely\r\njustifies the judgment of his patrons. He went first to Toulouse, as we\r\nknow from his affectionate mention of one of his teachers there.\r\nToulouse was more famous for law, however, than for medicine, and after\r\na time Chauliac sought Montpellier to complete his medical studies.\r\n\r\nFor English-speaking people an added interest in Guy de Chauliac will be\r\nthe fact that one of his teachers at Montpellier was Bernard Gordon,\r\nvery probably a Scotchman, who taught for some thirty-five years at this\r\nfamous university in the south of France, and died near the end of the\r\nfirst quarter of the fourteenth century. One of Chauliac's\r\nfellow-students at Montpellier was John of Gaddesden, the first English\r\nRoyal Physician by official appointment of whom we have any account.\r\nJohn is mentioned by Chaucer in his \"Doctor of Physic,\" and is usually\r\nlooked upon as one of the fathers of English medicine. Chauliac did not\r\nthink much of him, though his reason for his dislike of him will\r\nprobably be somewhat startling to those who assume that the men of the\r\nMiddle Ages always clung servilely to authority. Chauliac's objection to\r\nGaddesden's book is that he merely repeats his masters and does not dare\r\nto think for himself. It is not hard to understand that such an\r\nindependent thinker as Chauliac should have been utterly dissatisfied\r\nwith a book that did not go beyond the forefathers in medicine that the\r\nauthor quotes. This is the explanation of his well-known expression,\r\n\"Last of all arose the scentless rose of England ['Rosa Angliae' was the\r\nname of John of Gaddesden's book], in which, on its being sent to me, I\r\nhoped to find the odor of sweet originality, but instead of that I\r\nencountered only the fictions of Hispanus, of Gilbert, and of\r\nTheodoric.\"\r\n\r\nThe presence of a Scotch professor and an English fellow-student,\r\nafterwards a royal physician, at Montpellier, at the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century, shows how much more cosmopolitan was university life\r\nin those times than we are prone to think, and what attraction a great\r\nuniversity medical school possessed even for men from long distances.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving his degree of Doctor of Medicine at Montpellier Chauliac\r\nwent, as we have said, to Bologna. Here he attracted the attention and\r\nreceived the special instruction of Bertruccio, who was attracting\r\nstudents from all over Europe at this time and was making some\r\nexcellent demonstrations in anatomy, employing human dissections very\r\nfreely. Chauliac tells of the methods that Bertruccio used in order that\r\nbodies might be in as good condition as possible for demonstration\r\npurposes, and mentions the fact that he saw him do many dissections in\r\ndifferent ways.\r\n\r\nIn Roth's life of Vesalius, which is usually considered one of our most\r\nauthoritative medical historical works not only with regard to the\r\ndetails of Vesalius' life, but also in all that concerns anatomy about\r\nthat time and for some centuries before, there is a passage quoted from\r\nChauliac himself which shows how freely dissection was practised at the\r\nItalian universities in the fourteenth century. This passage deserves to\r\nbe quoted at some length because there are even serious historians who\r\nstill cite a Bull of Pope Boniface VIII, issued in 1300, forbidding the\r\nboiling and dismembering of bodies in order to transport them to long\r\ndistances for burial in their own country, as being, either rightly or\r\nwrongly, interpreted as a prohibition of dissection and, therefore,\r\npreventing the development of anatomy. In the notes to his history of\r\ndissection during this period in Bologna Roth says: \"Without doubt the\r\npassage in Guy de Chauliac which tells of having frequently seen\r\ndissections, must be considered as referring to Bologna. This passage\r\nruns as follows: 'My master Bertruccius conducted the dissection very\r\noften after the following manner: the dead body having been placed upon\r\na bench, he used to make four lessons on it. In the first the\r\nnutritional portions were treated, because they are so likely to become\r\nputrefied. In the second, he demonstrated the spiritual members; in the\r\nthird, the animate members; in the fourth, the extremities.'\" (Roth,\r\n\"Andreas Vesalius.\" Basel, 1896.)\r\n\r\nBertruccio's master, Mondino, is hailed in the history of medicine as\r\nthe father of dissection. His book on dissection was for the next three\r\ncenturies in the hands of nearly every medical scholar in Europe who was\r\ntrying to do good work in anatomy. It was not displaced until Vesalius\r\ncame, the father of modern anatomy, who revolutionized the science in\r\nthe Renaissance time. Mondino had devoted himself to the subject with\r\nunfailing ardor and enthusiasm, and from everywhere in Europe the\r\nstudents came to receive inspiration in his dissecting-room. Within a\r\nfew years such was the enthusiasm for dissection aroused by him in\r\nBologna that there were many legal prosecutions for body-snatching, the\r\nconsequence doubtless of a regulation of the Medical Department of the\r\nUniversity of Bologna, that if the students brought a body to any of\r\ntheir teachers he was bound to dissect it for them. Bertruccio,\r\nMondino's disciple and successor, continued this great work, and now\r\nChauliac, the third in the tradition, was to carry the Bolognese methods\r\nback to France, and his position as chamberlain to the Pope was to give\r\nthem a wide vogue throughout the world. The great French surgeon's\r\nattitude toward anatomy and dissection can be judged from his famous\r\nexpression that \"the surgeon ignorant of anatomy carves the human body\r\nas a blind man carves wood.\" The whole subject of dissection at this\r\ntime has been fully discussed in the first three chapters of my \"Popes\r\nand Science,\" where those who are interested in the matter may follow it\r\nto their satisfaction.[23]\r\n\r\nAfter his Bologna experience Chauliac went to Paris. Evidently his\r\nindefatigable desire to know all that there was to be known would not be\r\nsatisfied until he had spent some time at the great French university\r\nwhere Lanfranc, after having studied under William of Salicet in Italy,\r\nhad gone to establish that tradition of French surgery which, carried on\r\nso well by Mondeville his great successor, was to maintain Frenchmen as\r\nthe leading surgeons of the world until the nineteenth century (Pagel).\r\nLanfranc, himself an Italian, had been exiled from his native country,\r\napparently because of political troubles, but was welcomed at Paris\r\nbecause the faculty realized that they needed the inspiration of the\r\nItalian medical movement in surgery for the establishment of a good\r\nschool of surgery in connection with the university. The teaching so\r\nwell begun by Lanfranc was magnificently continued by Mondeville and\r\nArnold of Villanova and their disciples. Chauliac was fortunate enough\r\nto come under the influence of Petrus de Argentaria, who was worthily\r\nmaintaining the tradition of practical teaching in anatomy and surgery\r\nso well founded by his great predecessors of the thirteenth century.\r\nAfter this grand tour Chauliac was himself prepared to do work of the\r\nhighest order, for he had been in touch with all that was best in the\r\nmedicine and surgery of his time.\r\n\r\nLike many another distinguished member of his profession, Chauliac did\r\nnot settle down in the scene of his ultimate labors at once, but was\r\nsomething of a wanderer. His own words are, \"_Et per multa tempora\r\noperatus fui in multis partibus_.\" Perhaps out of gratitude to the\r\nclerical patrons of his native town to whom he owed so much, or because\r\nof the obligations he considered that he owed them for his education, he\r\npractised first in his native diocese of Mende; thence he removed to\r\nLyons, where we know that he lived for several years, for in 1344 he\r\ntook part as a canon in a chapter that met in the Church of St. Just in\r\nthat city. Just when he was called to Avignon we do not know, though\r\nwhen the black death ravaged that city in 1348 he was the body-physician\r\nof Pope Clement VI, for he is spoken of in a Papal document as\r\n\"_venerabilis et circumspectus vir, dominus Guido de Cauliaco, canonicus\r\net praepositus ecclesiae Sancti Justi Lugduni, medicusque domini Nostri\r\nPapae_.\" All the rest of his life was passed in the Papal capital, which\r\nAvignon was for some seventy years of the fourteenth century. He served\r\nas chamberlain-physician to three Popes, Clement VI, Innocent VI, and\r\nUrban V. We do not know the exact date of his death, but when Pope Urban\r\nV went to Rome in 1367, Chauliac was putting the finishing touches on\r\nhis \"Chirurgia Magna,\" which, as he tells us, was undertaken as a\r\n_solatium senectutis_--a solace in old age. When Urban returned to\r\nAvignon for a time in 1370 Chauliac was dead. His life work is summed up\r\nfor us in this great treatise on surgery, full of anticipations in\r\nsurgical procedures that we are prone to think much more modern.\r\n\r\nNicaise has emphasized the principles which guided Guy de Chauliac in\r\nthe choice and interpretation of his authorities by a quotation from Guy\r\nhimself, which is so different in its tone from what is usually supposed\r\nto have been the attitude of mind of the men of science of the time that\r\nit would be well for all those who want to understand the Middle Ages\r\nbetter to have it near them. Speaking of the surgeons of his own and\r\nimmediately preceding generations, Guy says: \"One thing particularly is\r\na source of annoyance to me in what these surgeons have written, and it\r\nis that they follow one another like so many cranes. For one always says\r\nwhat the other says. I do not know whether it is from fear or from love\r\nthat they do not deign to listen except to such things as they are\r\naccustomed to and as have been proved by authorities. They have to my\r\nmind understood very badly Aristotle's second book of metaphysics where\r\nhe shows that these two things, fear and love, are the greatest\r\nobstacles on the road to the knowledge of the truth. Let them give up\r\nsuch friendships and fears. 'Because while Socrates or Plato may be a\r\nfriend, truth is a greater friend.' Truth is a holy thing and worthy to\r\nbe honored above everything else. Let them follow the doctrine of Galen,\r\nwhich is entirely made up of experience and reason, and in which one\r\ninvestigates things and despises words.\"\r\n\r\nAfter all, this is what great authorities in medicine have always\r\ninsisted on. Once every hundred years or so one finds a really great\r\nobserver who makes new observations and wakes the world up. He is\r\nsurprised that men should not have used their powers of observation for\r\nthemselves, but should have been following old-time masters. His\r\ncontemporaries often refuse to listen to him at first. His observations,\r\nhowever, eventually make their way. We blame the Middle Ages for\r\nfollowing authority, but what have we been always doing but following\r\nauthority, except for the geniuses who come and lift us out of the rut\r\nand illuminate a new portion of the realm of medicine. After they have\r\ncome, however, and done their work, their disciples proceed to see with\r\ntheir eyes and to think that they are making observations for themselves\r\nwhen they are merely following authority. When the next master in\r\nmedicine comes along his discovery is neglected because men have not\r\nfound it in the old books, and usually he has to suffer for daring to\r\nhave opinions of his own. The fact of the matter is that at any time\r\nthere is only a very limited number of men who think for themselves. The\r\nrest think other people's thoughts and think they are thinking and doing\r\nthings. As for observation, John Ruskin once said, \"Nothing is harder\r\nthan to see something and tell it simply as you saw it.\" This is as true\r\nin science as in art, and only genius succeeds in doing it well.\r\n\r\nChauliac's book is confessedly a compilation. He has taken the good\r\nwherever he found it, though he adds, modestly enough, that his work\r\nalso contains whatever his own measure of intelligence enabled him to\r\nfind useful (_quae juxta modicitatem mei ingenii utilia reputavi_).\r\nIndeed it is the critical judgment displayed by Chauliac in selecting\r\nfrom his predecessors that best illustrates at once the practical\r\ncharacter of his intellect and his discerning spirit. What the men of\r\nhis time are said to have lacked is the critical faculty. They were\r\nencyclopedic in intellect and gathered all kinds of information without\r\ndiscrimination, is a very common criticism of medieval writers. No one\r\ncan say this of Chauliac, however, and, above all, he was no respecter\r\nof authority, merely for the sake of authority. His criticism of John of\r\nGaddesden's book shows that the blind following of those who had gone\r\nbefore was his special _bete noir_. His bitterest reproach for many of\r\nhis predecessors was that \"they follow one another like cranes, whether\r\nfor love or fear, I cannot say.\"\r\n\r\nChauliac's right to the title of father of surgery will perhaps be best\r\nappreciated from the brief account of his recommendations as to the\r\nvalue of surgical intervention for conditions in the three most\r\nimportant cavities of the body, the skull, the thorax, and the abdomen.\r\nThese cavities have usually been the dread of surgeons. Chauliac not\r\nonly used the trephine, but laid down very exact indications for its\r\napplication. Expectant treatment was to be the rule in wounds of the\r\nhead, yet when necessary, interference was counselled as of great value.\r\nHis prognosis of brain injuries was much better than that of his\r\npredecessors. He says that he had seen injuries of the brain followed by\r\nsome loss of brain substance, yet with complete recovery of the patient.\r\nIn one case that he notes a considerable amount of brain substance was\r\nlost, yet the patient recovered with only a slight defect of memory,\r\nand even this disappeared after a time. He lays down exact indications\r\nfor the opening of the thorax, that _noli me tangere_ of surgeons at all\r\ntimes, even our own, and points out the relations of the ribs and the\r\ndiaphragm, so as to show just where the opening should be made in order\r\nto remove fluid of any kind.\r\n\r\nIn abdominal conditions, however, Chauliac's anticipation of modern\r\nviews is most surprising. He recognized that wounds of the intestines\r\nwere surely fatal unless leakage could be prevented. Accordingly he\r\nsuggested the opening of the abdomen and the sewing up of such\r\nintestinal wounds as could be located. He describes a method of suture\r\nfor these cases and seems, like many another abdominal surgeon, even to\r\nhave invented a special needleholder.\r\n\r\nTo most people it would seem absolutely out of the question that such\r\nsurgical procedures could be practised in the fourteenth century. We\r\nhave the definite record of them, however, in a text-book that was the\r\nmost read volume on the subject for several centuries. Most of the\r\nsurprise with regard to these operations will vanish when it is recalled\r\nthat in Italy during the thirteenth century, as we have already seen,\r\nmethods of anaesthesia by means of opium and mandragora were in common\r\nuse, having been invented in the twelfth century and perfected by Ugo da\r\nLucca, and Chauliac must not only have known but must have frequently\r\nemployed various methods of anaesthesia.\r\n\r\nIn discussing amputations he has described in general certain methods of\r\nanaesthesia in use in his time, and especially the method by means of\r\ninhalation. It would not seem to us in the modern time that this method\r\nwould be very successful, but there is an enthusiastic accord of\r\nauthorities attesting that operations were done at this time with the\r\nhelp of this inhalant without the infliction of pain. Chauliac says:\r\n\r\n     \"Some prescribe medicaments which send the patient to sleep,\r\n     so that the incision may not be felt, such as opium, the juice\r\n     of the morel, hyoscyamus, mandrake, ivy, hemlock, lettuce. A\r\n     new sponge is soaked by them in these juices and left to dry\r\n     in the sun; and when they have need of it they put this sponge\r\n     into warm water and then hold it under the nostrils of the\r\n     patient until he goes to sleep. Then they perform the\r\n     operation.\"\r\n\r\nMany people might be prone to think that the hospitals of Chauliac's\r\ntime would not be suitable for such surgical work as he describes. It\r\nis, however, only another amusing assumption of this self-complacent age\r\nof ours to think that we were the first who ever made hospitals worthy\r\nof the name and of the great humanitarian purpose they subserve. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the old-time hospitals were even better than ours or, as\r\na rule, better than any we had until the present generation. In \"The\r\nPopes and Science,\" in the chapter on \"The Foundation of City\r\nHospitals,\" I call attention to the fact that architects of the present\r\nday go back to the hospitals of the Middle Ages in order to find the\r\nmodels for hospitals for the modern times. Mr. Arthur Dillon, a\r\nwell-known New York architect, writing of a hospital built at Tonnerre\r\nin France, toward the end of the thirteenth century (1292), says:\r\n\r\n     \"It was an admirable hospital in every way, and it is doubtful\r\n     if we to-day surpass it. It was isolated; the ward was\r\n     separated from the other buildings; it had the advantage we so\r\n     often lose of being but one story high, and more space was\r\n     given to each patient than we can now afford.\r\n\r\n     \"The ventilation by the great windows and ventilators in the\r\n     ceiling was excellent; it was cheerfully lighted; and the\r\n     arrangement of the gallery shielded the patients from dazzling\r\n     light and from draughts from the windows and afforded an easy\r\n     means of supervision, while the division by the roofless low\r\n     partitions isolated the sick and obviated the depression that\r\n     comes from sight of others in pain.\r\n\r\n     \"It was, moreover, in great contrast to the cheerless white\r\n     wards of to-day. The vaulted ceiling was very beautiful; the\r\n     woodwork was richly carved, and the great windows over the\r\n     altars were filled with colored glass. Altogether it was one\r\n     of the best examples of the best period of Gothic\r\n     Architecture.\"[24]\r\n\r\nThe fine hospital thus described was but one of many. Virchow, in his\r\narticle on hospitals quoted in the same chapter, called attention to the\r\nfact that in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries every town of five\r\nthousand or more inhabitants had its hospital, founded on the model of\r\nthe great Santo Spirito Hospital in Rome, and all of them did good work.\r\nThe surgeons of Guy de Chauliac's time would indeed find hospitals\r\nwherever they might be called in consultation, even in small towns. They\r\nwere more numerous in proportion to population than our own and, as a\r\nrule, at least as well organized as ours were until the last few years.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that with such a good hospital organization excellent\r\nsurgery was accomplished. Hernia was Chauliac's specialty, and in it his\r\nsurgical judgment is admirable. Mondeville before his time did not\r\nhesitate to say that many operations for hernia were done not for the\r\nbenefit of the patient, but for the benefit of the surgeon,--a very\r\nstriking anticipation of remarks that one sometimes hears even at the\r\npresent time. Chauliac discussed operations for hernia very\r\nconservatively. His rule was that a truss should be worn, and no\r\noperation attempted unless the patient's life was endangered by the\r\nhernia. It is to him that we owe the invention of a well-developed\r\nmethod of taxis, or manipulation of a hernia, to bring about its\r\nreduction, which was in use until the end of the nineteenth century. He\r\nsuggested that trusses could not be made according to rule, but must be\r\nadapted to each individual case. He invented several forms of truss\r\nhimself, and in general it may be said that his manipulative skill and\r\nhis power to apply his mechanical principles to his work are the most\r\ncharacteristic of his qualities. This is particularly noteworthy in his\r\nchapters on fractures and dislocations, in which he suggests various\r\nmethods of reduction and realizes very practically the mechanical\r\ndifficulties that were to be encountered in the correction of the\r\ndeformities due to these pathological conditions. In a word, we have a\r\npicture of the skilled surgeon of the modern time in this treatise of a\r\nfourteenth-century teacher of surgery.\r\n\r\nChauliac discusses six different operations for the radical cure of\r\nhernia. As Gurlt points out, he criticises them from the same standpoint\r\nas that of recent surgeons. The object of radical operations for hernia\r\nis to produce a strong, firm tissue support over the ring through which\r\nthe cord passes, so that the intestines cannot descend through it. It is\r\nrather interesting to find that the surgeons of this time tried to\r\nobliterate the canal by means of the cautery, or inflammation producing\r\nagents, arsenic and the like, a practice that recalls some methods still\r\nused more or less irregularly. They also used gold wire, which was to be\r\nleft in the tissues and is supposed to protect and strengthen the\r\nclosure of the ring. At this time all these operations for the radical\r\ncure of hernia involved the sacrifice of the testicle because the old\r\nsurgeons wanted to obliterate the ring completely, and thought this the\r\neasiest way. Chauliac discusses the operation in this respect and says\r\nthat he has seen many cases in which men possessed of but one testicle\r\nhave procreated, and this is a case where the lesser of two evils is to\r\nbe chosen.\r\n\r\nOf course Guy de Chauliac would not have been able to operate so freely\r\non hernia and suggest, following his own experience, methods of\r\ntreatment of penetrating wounds of the abdomen only that he had learned\r\nthe lessons of antiseptic surgery which had been gradually developed\r\namong the great surgeons of Italy during the preceding century. The use\r\nof the stronger wines as a dressing together with insistence on the most\r\nabsolute cleanliness of the surgeon before the operation, and careful\r\ndetails of cleanliness during the operation, made possible the\r\nperformance of many methods of surgical intervention that would\r\notherwise surely have been fatal. Probably nothing is harder to\r\nunderstand than that after these practical discoveries men should have\r\nlost sight of their significance, and after having carefully studied the\r\nviscous exudation which produces healthy natural union, should have come\r\nto the thought of the necessity for the formation of laudable pus before\r\nunion might be expected. The mystery is really no greater than that of\r\nmany another similar incident in human history, but it strikes us more\r\nforcibly because the discovery and gradual development of antiseptic\r\nsurgery in our own time has meant so much for us. Already even in\r\nChauliac's practice, however, some of the finer elements of the\r\ntechnique that made surgery antiseptic to a marked degree, if not\r\npositively aseptic in many cases, were not being emphasized as they were\r\nby his predecessors, and there was a beginning of surgical\r\nmeddlesomeness reasserting itself.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought, however, that it was only with the coarse\r\napplications of surgery that Chauliac concerned himself. He was very\r\nmuch interested in the surgical treatment of eye diseases and wrote a\r\nmonograph on cataract, in which he gathers what was known before his\r\ntime and discusses it in the light of his own experience. The writing of\r\nsuch a book is not so surprising at this time if we recall that in the\r\npreceding century the famous Pope John XXI, who had been a physician\r\nbefore he became Pope, and under the name of Peter of Spain was looked\r\nup to as one of the distinguished scientists of his time, had written a\r\nbook on eye diseases that has recently been the subject of much\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nPope John had much to say of cataract, dividing it into traumatic and\r\nspontaneous, and suggesting the needling of cataract, a gold needle\r\nbeing used for the purpose. Chauliac's method of treating cataract was\r\nby depression. His care in the selection of patients may be appreciated\r\nfrom his treatment of John of Luxembourg, King of Bavaria, blind from\r\ncataract, who consulted Chauliac in 1336 while on a visit to Avignon\r\nwith the King of France. Chauliac refused to operate, however, and put\r\noff the King with dietary regulations.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on John of Arcoli and Medieval Dentistry we call\r\nattention to the fact that Chauliac discussed dental surgery briefly,\r\nyet with such practical detail as to show very clearly how much more was\r\nknown about this specialty in his time than we have had any idea of\r\nuntil recent years. He recognized the dentists as specialists, calls\r\nthem dentatores, but thinks that they should operate under the direction\r\nof a physician--hence the physician should know much about teeth and\r\nespecially about their preservation. He enumerates instruments that\r\ndentists should have and shows very clearly that the specialty had\r\nreached a high state of development. A typical example of Chauliac's\r\ncommon sense and dependence on observation and not tradition is to be\r\nfound in what he has to say with regard to methods of removing the teeth\r\nwithout the use of extracting instruments. It is characteristic of his\r\nmethod of dealing with traditional remedies, even though of long\r\nstanding, that he brushes them aside with some impatience if they have\r\nnot proved themselves in his experience.\r\n\r\n     \"The ancients mention many medicaments, which draw out the\r\n     teeth without iron instruments or which make them more easy to\r\n     draw out; such as the milky juice of the tithymal with\r\n     pyrethrum, the roots of the mulberry and caper, citrine\r\n     arsenic, aqua fortis, the fat of forest frogs. But these\r\n     remedies promise much and accomplish but little--_mais ils\r\n     donnent beaucoup de promesses, et peu, d'operations_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that Chauliac has been enthusiastically praised. Nicaise\r\nhas devoutly gathered many of these praises into a sheaf of eulogies at\r\nthe end of his biography of the great French surgeon. He tells us that\r\nFallopius compared him to Hippocrates. John Calvo of Valencia, who\r\ntranslated the \"Great Surgery\" into Spanish, looks upon him as the first\r\nlaw-giver of surgery. Freind, the great English physician, in 1725\r\ncalled him the Prince of Surgeons. Ackermann said that Guy de Chauliac's\r\ntext-book will take the place of all that has been written on the\r\nsubject down to his time, so that even if all the other works had been\r\nlost his would replace them. Dezimeris, commenting on this, says that\r\n\"if one should take this appreciation literally, this surgeon of the\r\nfourteenth century would be the first and, up to the present time, the\r\nonly author who ever merited such an eulogy.\" \"At least,\" he adds, \"we\r\ncannot refuse him the distinction of having made a work infinitely\r\nsuperior to all those which appeared up to this time and even for a long\r\ntime afterwards. Posterity rendered him this justice, for he was for\r\nthree centuries the classic _par excellence_. He rendered the study easy\r\nand profitable, and all the foreign nations the tributaries of our\r\ncountry.\" Peyrihle considered Guy's \"Surgery\" as the most valuable and\r\ncomplete work of all those of the same kind that had been published\r\nsince Hippocrates and added that the reading of it was still useful in\r\nhis time in 1784. Begin, in his work on Ambroise Pare, says \"that Guy\r\nhas written an immortal book to which are attached the destinies of\r\nFrench surgeons.\" Malgaigne, in his \"History of Surgery,\" does not\r\nhesitate to say, \"I do not fear to say that, Hippocrates alone excepted,\r\nthere is not a single treatise on surgery,--Greek, Latin, or\r\nArabic,--which I place above, or even on the same level with, this\r\nmagnificent work, 'The Surgery of Guy de Chauliac.'\" Daremberg said,\r\n\"Guy seems to us a surgeon above all erudite, yet expert and without\r\never being rash. He knows, above all, how to choose what is best in\r\neverything.\" Verneuil, in his \"Conference sur Les Chirurgiens Erudits,\"\r\nsays, \"The services rendered by the 'Great Surgery' were immense; by it\r\nthere commenced for France an era of splendor. It is with justice, then,\r\nthat posterity has decreed to Guy de Chauliac the title of Father of\r\nFrench surgery.\"\r\n\r\nThe more one reads of Chauliac's work the less is one surprised at the\r\nestimation in which he has been held wherever known. It would not be\r\nhard to add a further sheaf of compliments to those collected by\r\nNicaise. Modern writers on the history of medicine have all been\r\nenthusiastic in their admiration of him, just in proportion to the\r\nthoroughness of their acquaintance with him. Portal, in his \"History of\r\nAnatomy and Surgery,\" says, \"Finally, it may be averred that Guy de\r\nChauliac said nearly everything which modern surgeons say, and that his\r\nwork is of infinite price but unfortunately too little read, too little\r\npondered.\" Malgaigne declares Chauliac's \"Chirurgia Magna\" to be \"a\r\nmasterpiece of learned and luminous writing.\" Professor Clifford\r\nAllbutt, the Regius Professor of Physic at the University of Cambridge,\r\nsays of Chauliac's treatise: \"This great work I have studied carefully\r\nand not without prejudice; yet I cannot wonder that Fallopius compared\r\nthe author to Hippocrates or that John Freind calls him the Prince of\r\nSurgeons. It is rich, aphoristic, orderly, and precise.\"[25]\r\n\r\nIf to this account of his professional career it be added that\r\nChauliac's personality is, if possible, more interesting than his\r\nsurgical accomplishment, some idea of the significance of the life of\r\nthe great father of modern surgery will be realized. We have already\r\nquoted the distinguished words of praise accorded him by Pope Clement\r\nVI. That they were well deserved, Chauliac's conduct during the black\r\ndeath which ravaged Avignon in 1348, shortly after his arrival in the\r\nPapal City, would have been sufficient of itself to attest. The\r\noccurrence of the plague in a city usually gave rise to an exhibition of\r\nthe most arrant cowardice, and all who could, fled. In many of the\r\nEuropean cities the physicians joined the fugitives, and the ailing were\r\nleft to care for themselves. With a few notable exceptions, this was\r\nthe case at Avignon, but Guy was among those who remained faithful to\r\nhis duty and took on himself the self-sacrificing labor of caring for\r\nthe sick, doubly harassing because so many of his brother physicians\r\nwere absent. He denounces their conduct as shameful, yet does not boast\r\nof his own courage, but on the contrary says that he was in constant\r\nfear of the disease. Toward the end of the epidemic he was attacked by\r\nthe plague and for a time his life was despaired of. Fortunately he\r\nrecovered, to become the most influential among his colleagues, the most\r\nhighly admired of the physicians of his generation, and the close\r\npersonal friend of all the high ecclesiastics, who had witnessed his\r\nmagnificent display of courage and of helpfulness for the\r\nplague-stricken during the epidemic. He wrote a very clear account of\r\nthe epidemic, which leaves no doubt that it was true bubonic plague.\r\n\r\nAfter this fine example, Chauliac's advice to brother physicians in the\r\nspecialty of surgery carried added weight. In the Introductory chapter\r\nof his \"Chirurgia Magna\" he said:\r\n\r\n     \"The surgeon should be learned, skilled, ingenious, and of\r\n     good morals. Be bold in things that are sure, cautious in\r\n     dangers; avoid evil cures and practices; be gracious to the\r\n     sick, obliging to his colleagues, wise in his predictions. Be\r\n     chaste, sober, pitiful, and merciful; not covetous nor\r\n     extortionate of money; but let the recompense be moderate,\r\n     according to the work, the means of the sick, the character of\r\n     the issue or event, and its dignity.\"\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Malgaigne says of him, \"Never since Hippocrates has\r\nmedicine heard such language filled with so much nobility and so full of\r\nmatter in so few words.\"\r\n\r\nChauliac was in every way worthy of his great contemporaries and the\r\nperiod in which his lot was cast. Ordinarily we are not apt to think of\r\nthe early fourteenth century as an especially productive period in human\r\nhistory, but such it is. Dante's Divine Comedy was entirely written\r\nduring Chauliac's life. Petrarch was born within a few years of Chauliac\r\nhimself; Boccaccio in Italy, and Chaucer in England, wrote while\r\nChauliac was still alive. Giotto did his great painting, and his pupils\r\nwere laying the deep, firm foundations of modern art. Many of the great\r\ncathedrals were being finished. Most of the universities were in the\r\nfirst flush of their success as moulders of the human mind. There are\r\nfew centuries in history that can show the existence of so many men\r\nwhose work was to have an enduring influence for all the after time as\r\nthis upon which Chauliac's career shed so bright a light. The preceding\r\ncentury had seen the origin of the universities and the rise of such\r\nsupremely great men as Albertus Magnus, Roger Bacon, Thomas Aquinas, and\r\nthe other famous scholars of the early days of the mendicant orders, and\r\nhad made the intellectual mould of university training in which men's\r\nminds for seven centuries were to be formed, so that Chauliac, instead\r\nof being an unusual phenomenon is only a fitting expression of the\r\ninterest of this time in everything, including the physical sciences\r\nand, above all, medicine and surgery.\r\n\r\nFor some people it may be a source of surprise that Chauliac should\r\nhave had the intellectual training to enable him to accomplish such\r\njudicious work in his specialty. Many people will be apt to assume that\r\nhe accomplished what he did in spite of his training, genius succeeding\r\neven in an unfavorable environment, and notwithstanding educational\r\ndisadvantages. Those who would be satisfied with any such explanation,\r\nhowever, know nothing of the educational opportunities provided in the\r\nperiod of which Chauliac was the fruit. He is a typical university man\r\nof the beginning of the fourteenth century, and the universities must be\r\ngiven due credit for him. It is ordinarily assumed that the universities\r\npaid very little attention to science and that scientists would find\r\npractically nothing to satisfy in their curricula. Professor Huxley in\r\nhis address on \"Universities, Actual and Ideal,\" delivered as the\r\nRectorial Address at Aberdeen University in 1874, declared that they\r\nwere probably educating in the real sense of the word better than we do\r\nnow. (See quotation in \"The Medical School at Salerno.\")\r\n\r\nIn the light of Chauliac's life it is indeed amusing to read the\r\nexcursions of certain historians into the relationship of the Popes and\r\nthe Church to science during the Middle Ages. Chauliac is typically\r\nrepresentative of medieval science, a man who gave due weight to\r\nauthority, yet tried everything by his own experience, and who sums up\r\nin himself such wonderful advance in surgery that during the last twenty\r\nyears the students of the history of medicine have been more interested\r\nin him than in anyone who comes during the intervening six centuries.\r\nChauliac, however, instead of meeting with any opposition, encountered\r\nencouragement, liberal patronage, generous interest, and even enjoyed\r\nthe intimate friendship of the highest ecclesiastics and the Popes of\r\nhis time. In every way his life may be taken as a type of what we have\r\ncome to know about the Middle Ages, when we know them as we should, in\r\nthe lives of the men who counted for most in them, and do not accept\r\nmerely the broad generalizations which are always likely to be deceptive\r\nand which in the past have led men into the most absurd and ridiculous\r\nnotions with regard to a wonderful period in human history.\r\n\r\nThat Guy de Chauliac was no narrow specialist is abundantly evident from\r\nhis book, for while the \"Great Surgery\" treats of the science and art of\r\nsurgery as its principal subject, there are remarks about nearly\r\neverything else relating to medicine, and most of them show a deep\r\ninterest, a thorough familiarity, and an excellent judgment. Besides we\r\nhave certain expressions with regard to intellectual matters generally\r\nwhich serve to show Guy as a profound thinker, who thoroughly\r\nappreciated just how accumulations of knowledge came to men and how far\r\neach generation or member of a generation should go and yet how limited\r\nmust, after all, be the knowledge obtained by any one person. With\r\nregard to books, for instance, he said, \"for everyone cannot have all\r\nthe books, and even if he did have them it would be too tiresome to read\r\nthem all and completely, and it would require a godlike memory to\r\nretain them all.\" He realized, however, that each generation, provided\r\nit took the opportunities offered it, was able to see a little bit\r\nfarther than its predecessor, and the figure that he employs to express\r\nthis is rather striking. \"Sciences,\" he said, \"are made by additions. It\r\nis quite impossible that the man who begins a science should finish it.\r\nWe are like infants, clinging to the neck of a giant; for we can see all\r\nthe giant sees and a little more.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features of the history of Guy de Chauliac\r\nis the bibliography of his works which has been written by Nicaise. This\r\nis admirably complete, labored over with the devotion that characterized\r\nNicaise's attitude of unstinted admiration for the subject. Altogether\r\nhe has some sixty pages of a quarto volume with regard to the various\r\neditions of Guy's works.\r\n\r\nThe first manuscript edition of Guy de Chauliac was issued in 1363, the\r\nfirst printed edition in 1478. Even in the fourteenth century Guy's\r\ngreat work was translated into all the languages generally used in\r\nEurope. Nicaise succeeded in placing 34 complete manuscripts of the\r\n\"Great Surgery\": 22 of these are in Latin, 4 are in French, 3 are in\r\nEnglish, 2 only in Provencal, though that was the language spoken in the\r\nregion where much of Chauliac's life was passed, and one each in\r\nItalian, in Low Dutch, and in Hebrew. Of the English manuscripts, one is\r\nnumber twenty-five English of the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris; a\r\nsecond is number 3666 English of the Sloane collection in the British\r\nMuseum, and a third is in the Library of the University of\r\nCambridge.[26]\r\n\r\nPaulin Paris, probably one of the best of recent authorities on the age\r\nand significance of old manuscripts, says in the third volume of his\r\n\"Manuscrits Francais,\" page 346, \"This manuscript [of Guy de Chauliac's\r\n\"Great Surgery\"] was made, if not during the life, then certainly very\r\nshortly after the death of the author. It is one of the oldest that can\r\nbe cited, and the fact that an English translation was made so near to\r\nthe time of the original composition of the book attests the great\r\nreputation enjoyed by Guy de Chauliac at this time, and which posterity\r\nhas fully confirmed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sloane copy in the British Museum contains some medical recipes at\r\nthe end by Francis Verney. It was probably written in the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Its title is:\r\n\r\n     \"The inventorie or the collectorie in cirurgicale parte of\r\n     medicine compiled and complete in the yere of our Lord 1363,\r\n     with some additions of other doctours, necessary to the\r\n     foresaid arte or crapte (crafte?).\"[27]\r\n\r\nWhat we find in the period of manuscripts, however, is as nothing\r\ncompared to the prestige of Guy de Chauliac's work, once the age of\r\nprinting began. Nicaise was able to find sixty different printed\r\neditions of the \"Great Surgery.\" Nine others that are mentioned by\r\nauthors have disappeared and apparently no copies of them are in\r\nexistence. Besides there are sixty editions of portions of the work, of\r\ncompendiums of it and commentaries on it. Altogether 129 editions are\r\nextant. Of these there are sixteen Latin editions, forty-three French,\r\nfive Italian, four Low Dutch, five Catalan, and one English. Fourteen\r\nappeared in the fifteenth century, thirty-eight in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and seventeen in the seventeenth century. The fourteen editions\r\nbelonging to the _incunabula_ of printing, issued, that is, before the\r\nend of the fifteenth century, show what lively interest there was in the\r\nFrench surgeon of the preceding century, since printing presses at this\r\nprecious time were occupied only with the books that were considered\r\nindispensable for scholars. The first edition of the \"Great Surgery\" was\r\nprinted in 1478 at Lyons. Printing had only been introduced there five\r\nyears before. This first edition, _primus primarius_ or _editio\r\nprinceps_, was a French translation by Nicholas Panis. In 1480 an\r\nItalian edition was printed at Venice. The first Latin edition was\r\nprinted also in Venice in 1490.\r\n\r\nIt would be only natural to expect that the successors of Guy de\r\nChauliac, and especially those who had come personally in contact with\r\nhim, would take advantage of his thorough work to make still further\r\nadvances in surgery. As matter of fact, decadence in surgery is noted\r\nimmediately after his death. Three men taught at the University of\r\nMontpellier at the end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the\r\nfifteenth century, John de Tornamira, Valesco de Taranta, and John\r\nFaucon. They cannot be compared, Gurlt says, with Guy de Chauliac,\r\nthough they were physicians of reputation in their time. Faucon made a\r\ncompendium of Guy's work for students. Somehow there seemed to be the\r\nimpression that surgery had now reached a point of development beyond\r\nwhich it could not advance. Unfortunate political conditions, wars, the\r\nwithdrawal of the Popes from Avignon to Rome, and other disturbances,\r\ndistracted men's minds, and surgery deteriorated to a considerable\r\nextent, until the new spirit at the time of the Renaissance came to\r\ninject fresh life into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nMEDIEVAL DENTISTRY--GIOVANNI OF ARCOLI\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is one phase of our present-day medicine and surgery that most\r\nof us are likely to be quite sure is of very recent development it is\r\ndentistry. Probably most people would declare at once that they had\r\nevery reason to think that the science and art of dentistry, as we have\r\nit now, developed for the first time in the world's history during the\r\nlast generation or two. It is extremely interesting to realize then, in\r\nthe light of this almost universal persuasion, founded to a great extent\r\non the conviction that man is in process of evolution and that as a\r\nconsequence we must surely be doing things now that men never did\r\nbefore, to find that dentistry, both as an art and science, is old; that\r\nit has developed at a number of times in the world's history, and that\r\nas fortunately for history its work was done mainly in indestructible\r\nmaterials, the teeth themselves and metal prosthetic apparatus, we have\r\nactual specimens of what was accomplished at a number of periods in the\r\nolden times. Surprising as it will seem to those who hear of it for the\r\nfirst time, dentistry reached high perfection even in what we know as\r\nancient history. It is rather easy to trace scientific and craftsmanlike\r\ninterest in it during the medieval period and in the magnificent\r\ndevelopment of surgery that came just at the end of the Middle Ages,\r\ndentistry shared to such degree that some of the text-books of the\r\nwriters on surgery of this time furnish abundant evidence of\r\nanticipations of many of the supposedly most modern developments of\r\ndentistry.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of historical traditions with regard to dentistry and\r\nthe treatment of the teeth in Egypt that can be traced back to good\r\nauthorities in Egyptology of a generation or more ago, but it is rather\r\nhard to confirm the accounts we have by actual specimens; either none\r\nwere found or for some reason those actually discovered are now not\r\nreadily available for study. Among the Phenicians however, though we\r\nhave good reasons to think that they learned their arts and crafts from\r\nthe Egyptians, there is convincing evidence of a high development of\r\ndentistry. M. Ernest Renan, during an exploring expedition in Phenicia,\r\nfound in the old necropolis at Sidon a set of teeth wired together, two\r\nof which were artificial. It was a striking example of bridgework, very\r\nwell done, and may now be seen in the Louvre. It would be more than a\r\nlittle surprising, from what we know of the lack of inventiveness on the\r\npart of the Phenicians and their tendency to acquire their arts by\r\nimitation, if they had reached such a climax of invention by themselves.\r\nSince they adapted and adopted most of their arts and crafts from Egypt,\r\nwith which they were in close commercial relations, it has been argued\r\nwith some plausibility that the Egyptians may have had many modes of\r\ndental prosthesis, but removed all artificial teeth and dental\r\nappliances from the mouth of corpses before embalming them, in\r\npreparation for the next world, because there was some religious\r\nobjection to such human handiwork being left in place for the hereafter,\r\nas they hoped for it.\r\n\r\nThere is a well-authenticated tradition of intimate intercourse in a\r\ncommercial way between the old Etruscans who inhabited the Italian hill\r\ncountry and the Phenicians, so that it is no surprise to find that the\r\noldest of Etruscan tombs contain some fine examples of bridgework. An\r\nimprovement has come over Phenician work however, and bands of gold\r\ninstead of wire are used for holding artificial teeth in place. Guerini,\r\nwhose \"History of Dentistry\" is the standard work on the subject, on a\r\ncommission from the Italian government, carefully studied these\r\nspecimens of Etruscan dental work in the museums of Italy, and has made\r\nsome interesting observations on them. In one specimen, which is\r\nespecially notable, two incisor teeth are replaced by a single tooth\r\nfrom a calf. This was grooved in such a way as to make it seem like two\r\nseparate teeth. Guerini suggests a very interesting and quite unexpected\r\nsource for this. While examining the specimen he wondered where the old\r\nEtruscan dentist had obtained a calf's tooth without a trace of wear on\r\nit. He came to the conclusion that he must have cut into the gums of a\r\nyoung calf before the permanent tooth was erupted in order to get this\r\nstructure absolutely unworn for his purpose. A number of examples of\r\nbridgework have been found in the old Etruscan tombs. The dates of their\r\nconstruction are probably not later than 500 B.C., and some of them are\r\nperhaps earlier than 700 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe Etruscans affected the old Romans in the matter of dentistry, so\r\nthat it is easy to understand the passage in the \"Laws of the Twelve\r\nTables,\" issued about 450 B.C., which, while forbidding the burial of\r\ngold with corpses, made a special exception for such gold as was\r\nfastened to the teeth. Gold was rare at Rome, and care was exercised not\r\nto allow any unnecessary decrease of the visible supply almost in the\r\nsame way as governments now protect their gold reserves. It may seem\r\nlike comparing little things with great, but the underlying principle is\r\nthe same. Hence this special law and its quite natural exception.\r\n\r\nIn Pope Julius' Museum in Rome there is a specimen of a gold cap made of\r\ntwo plates of gold riveted together and also riveted to bands of metal\r\nwhich were fastened around the neighboring teeth in order to hold the\r\ncap in place. This is from later Republican times at Rome. At the end of\r\nthe Republic and the beginning of the Empire there appear to have been\r\nmany forms of dental appliances. Martial says that the reason why one\r\nlady's teeth--whose name he does not conceal--are white and\r\nanother's--name also given--were dark, was that the first one bought\r\nhers and the second still had her own. In another satiric poem he\r\ndescribes an elderly woman as so much frightened that when she ran away\r\nher teeth fell out, while her friends lost their false hair. Fillings of\r\nmany kinds were used, dentrifices of nearly every kind were invented,\r\nand dentistry evidently reached a high stage of development, though we\r\nhave nowhere a special name for dentist, and the work seems to have been\r\ndone by physicians, who took this as a specialty.\r\n\r\nWhile in the Middle Ages there was, owing to conditions, a loss of much\r\nof this knowledge of antiquity with regard to dentistry, or an\r\nobscuration of it, it never disappeared completely, and whenever men\r\nhave written seriously about medicine, above all about surgery in\r\nrelation to the face and the mouth, the teeth have come in for their\r\nshare of scientific and practical consideration. Aetius, the first\r\nimportant Christian writer on medicine and surgery, discusses, as we\r\nhave seen in the sketch of him, the nutrition of the teeth, their\r\nnerves, \"which came from the third pair and entered the teeth by a small\r\nhole existing at the end of the root,\" and other interesting details of\r\nanatomy and physiology. He knows much about the hygiene of the teeth,\r\ndiscusses extraction and the cure of fistula and other details. Paul of\r\nAEgina in the next century has much more, and while they both quote\r\nmainly from older authors there seems no doubt that they themselves had\r\nmade not a few observations and had practical experience.\r\n\r\nIt was from these men that the Arabian physicians and surgeons obtained\r\ntheir traditions of medicine, and so it is not surprising to find that\r\nthey discuss dental diseases and their treatment rationally and in\r\nconsiderable detail. Abulcasis particularly has much that is of\r\nsignificance and interest. We have pictures of two score of dental\r\ninstruments that were used by them. The Arabs not only treated and\r\nfilled carious teeth and even replaced those that were lost, but they\r\nalso corrected deformities of the mouth and of the dental arches.\r\nOrthodontia is sometimes said to be of much later origin and to begin\r\nmany centuries after Abulcasis' time, yet no one who knows of his work\r\ncan speak of Orthodontia as an invention after him. In this, however, as\r\nin most of the departments of medicine and surgery, the Arabs were\r\nmerely imitators, though probably they expanded somewhat the practical\r\nknowledge that had come to them.\r\n\r\nWhen the great revival in surgery came in the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies it is not surprising that there should also have been an\r\nimportant renewal of interest in dentistry. A detailed review of this\r\nwould take us too far afield, but at least something may be said of two\r\nor three of the great representative surgical writers who touched on\r\nthis specialty.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the fourteenth century that prince of surgeons, and\r\nmodel of surgical writers, Guy de Chauliac, wrote his great text-book of\r\nsurgery, \"Le Grande Chirurgie.\" An extremely interesting feature of this\r\nwork is to be found in the chapters that treat of diseases of the teeth.\r\nThese are not very comprehensive, and are evidently not so much the\r\nresult of his experience, as the fruit of his reading, yet they contain\r\nmany practical valuable ideas that are supposed to be ever so much later\r\nthan the middle of the fourteenth century. His anatomy and physiology at\r\nleast are not without many errors. His rules for the preservation of the\r\nteeth show that the ordinary causes of dental decay were well recognized\r\neven as early as this. Emphasis was laid on not taking foods too hot or\r\ntoo cold, and above all not to follow either hot or cold food by\r\nsomething very different from it in temperature. The breaking of hard\r\nthings with the teeth was recognized as one of the most frequent causes\r\nof such deterioration of the enamel as gives opportunity for the\r\ndevelopment of decay. The eating of sweets, and especially the sticky\r\nsweets--preserves and the like--was recognized as an important source of\r\ncaries. The teeth were supposed to be cleaned frequently, and not to be\r\ncleaned too roughly, for this would do more harm than good. We find\r\nthese rules repeated by succeeding writers on general surgery, who touch\r\nupon dentistry, or at least the care of the teeth, and they were not\r\noriginal with Guy de Chauliac, but part of the tradition of surgery.\r\n\r\nAs noted by Guerini in his \"History of Dentistry,\" the translation of\r\nwhich was published under the auspices of the National Dental\r\nAssociation of the United States of America,[28] Chauliac recognized the\r\ndentists as specialists. Besides, it should be added, as is evident from\r\nhis enumeration of the surgical instruments which he declares necessary\r\nfor them, they were not as we might easily think in the modern time mere\r\ntooth pullers, but at least the best among them treated teeth as far as\r\ntheir limited knowledge and means at command enabled them to do so, and\r\nthese means were much more elaborate than we have been led to think, and\r\nmuch more detailed than we have reason to know that they were at\r\ncertain subsequent periods.\r\n\r\nIn fact, though Guy de Chauliac frankly confesses that he touches on the\r\nsubject of dentistry only in order to complete his presentation of the\r\nsubject of surgery and not because he has anything of his own to say\r\nwith regard to the subject, there is much that is of present-day\r\ninterest in his brief paragraphs. He observes that operations on the\r\nteeth are special and belong to the _dentatores_, or dentists, to whom\r\ndoctors had given them over. He considers, however, that the operations\r\nin the mouth should be performed under the direction of a physician. It\r\nis in order to give physicians the general principles with which they\r\nmay be able to judge of the advisability or necessity for dental\r\noperations that his short chapters are written. If their advice is to be\r\nof value, physicians should know the various methods of treatment\r\nsuitable for dental diseases, including mouth washes, gargles,\r\nmasticatories, anointments, rubbings, fumigations, cauterizations,\r\nfillings, filings, and the various manual operations. He says that the\r\n_dentator_ must be provided with the appropriate instruments, among\r\nwhich he names scrapers, rasps, straight and curved spatumina,\r\nelevators, simple and with two branches, toothed tenacula, and many\r\ndifferent forms of probes and canulas. He should also have small\r\nscalpels, tooth trephines, and files.\r\n\r\nChauliac is particularly emphatic in his insistence on not permitting\r\nalimentary materials to remain in cavities, and suggests that if\r\ncavities between the teeth tend to retain food material they should even\r\nbe filed in such a way as to prevent these accumulations. His\r\ndirections for cleansing the teeth were rather detailed. His favorite\r\ntreatment for wounds was wine, and he knew that he succeeded by means of\r\nit in securing union by first intention. It is not surprising, then, to\r\nfind that he recommends rinsing of the mouth with wine as a precaution\r\nagainst dental decay. A vinous decoction of wild mint and of pepper he\r\nconsidered particularly beneficial, though he thought that dentifrices,\r\neither powder or liquid, should also be used. He seems to recommend the\r\npowder dentifrices as more efficacious. His favorite prescription for a\r\ntooth powder, while more elaborate, resembles to such an extent, at\r\nleast some, if not indeed most of those, that are used at the present\r\ntime, that it seems worth while giving his directions for it. He took\r\nequal parts of cuttle bone, small white sea-shells, pumice stone, burnt\r\nstag's horn, nitre, alum, rock salt, burnt roots of iris, aristolochia,\r\nand reeds. All of these substances should be carefully reduced to powder\r\nand then mixed. His favorite liquid dentifrice contained the following\r\ningredients,--half a pound each of sal ammoniac and rock salt, and a\r\nquarter of a pound of sacharin alum. All these were to be reduced to\r\npowder and placed in a glass alembic and dissolved. The teeth should be\r\nrubbed with it, using a little scarlet cloth for the purpose. Just why\r\nthis particular color of cleansing cloth was recommended is not quite\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nHe recognized, however, that cleansing of the teeth properly often\r\nbecame impossible by any scrubbing method, no matter what the dentifrice\r\nused, because of the presence of what we call tartar and what he called\r\nhardened limosity or limyness (_limosite endurcie_). When that condition\r\nis present he suggests the use of rasps and spatumina and other\r\ninstrumental means of removing the tartar.\r\n\r\nEvidently he did not believe in the removal of the teeth unless this was\r\nabsolutely necessary and no other method of treatment would avail to\r\nsave the patient from continuous distress. He summarizes the authorities\r\nwith regard to the extraction of teeth and the removal of dental\r\nfragments and roots. He evidently knew of the many methods suggested\r\nbefore his time of removing teeth without recourse to instrumental\r\nextraction. There were a number of applications to the gums that were\r\nclaimed by older authors to remove the teeth without the need of metal\r\ninstruments. We might expect that Chauliac would detect the fallacy with\r\nregard to these and expose it. He says that while much is claimed for\r\nthese methods he has never seen them work in practice and he distrusts\r\nthem entirely.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting phase of what Guy de Chauliac has to say with\r\nregard to dentistry is of course to be found in his paragraphs on the\r\nartificial replacement of lost teeth and the subject of dental\r\nprosthesis generally. When teeth become loose he advises that they be\r\nfastened to the healthy ones with a gold chain. Guerini suggests that he\r\nevidently means a gold wire. If the teeth fall out they may be replaced\r\nby the teeth of another person or with artificial teeth made from\r\noxbone, which may be fixed in place by a fine metal ligature. He says\r\nthat such teeth may be serviceable for a long while. This is a rather\r\ncurt way of treating so large a subject as dental prosthesis, but it\r\ncontains a lot of suggestive material. He was quoting mainly the Arabian\r\nauthors, and especially Abulcasis and Ali Abbas and Rhazes, and these of\r\ncourse, as we have said, mentioned many methods of artificially\r\nreplacing teeth as also of transplantation and of treatment of the\r\ndeformities of the dental arches.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, it must be confessed that we have here in the\r\nmiddle of the fourteenth century a rather surprising anticipation of the\r\nknowledge of a special department of medicine which is usually\r\nconsidered to be distinctly modern, and indeed as having only attracted\r\nattention seriously in comparatively recent times.\r\n\r\nAfter Guy de Chauliac the next important contributor to dentistry is\r\nGiovanni of Arcoli, often better known by his Latin name, Johannes\r\nArculanus, who was a professor of medicine and surgery at Bologna and\r\nafterwards at Padua, just before and after the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and who died in 1484. He is famous principally for being the\r\nfirst we know who mentions the filling of teeth with gold.\r\n\r\nIt might possibly be suggested that coming at this time Arculanus should\r\nrather be reckoned as a Maker of Medicine in the Renaissance than as\r\nbelonging to the Middle Ages and its influences. His education, however,\r\nwas entirely completed before the earliest date at which the Renaissance\r\nmovement is usually said to begin, that is with the fall of\r\nConstantinople in 1452, and he was dead before the other date, that of\r\nthe discovery of America in 1492, which the Germans have in recent years\r\ncome to set down as the end of the Middle Ages. Besides, what he has to\r\nsay about dentistry occurs in typical medieval form. It is found in a\r\ncommentary on Rhazes, written just about the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. In the later true Renaissance such a commentary would have been\r\non a Greek author. In his commentary Arculanus touches on most of the\r\nfeatures of medicine and surgery from the standpoint of his own\r\nexperience as well as from what he knows of the writings of his\r\npredecessors and contemporaries. With the rest he has a series of\r\nchapters on diseases of the teeth. Guerini in his \"History of Dentistry\"\r\nsays that \"this subject [dentistry] is treated rather fully, and with\r\ngreat accuracy.\" Even some short references to it will, I think,\r\ndemonstrate this rather readily.[29]\r\n\r\nArculanus is particularly full in his directions for the preservation of\r\nthe teeth. We are rather prone to think that prophylaxis is\r\ncomparatively a modern idea, and that most of the principles of\r\nconservation of human tissues and the prevention of deterioration and\r\ndisease are distinctly modern. It needs only a little consideration of\r\nArculanus' instruction in the matter of the teeth, however, to undo any\r\nsuch false impression. For obvious reasons I prefer to quote Guerini's\r\nsummation of this medieval student of dentistry's rules for dental\r\nhygiene:\r\n\r\n     \"For the preservation of teeth--considered by him, quite\r\n     rightly, a matter of great importance--Giovanni of Arcoli\r\n     repeats the various counsels given on the subject by preceding\r\n     writers, but he gives them as ten distinct canons or rules,\r\n     creating in this way a kind of decalogue of dental hygiene.\r\n     These rules are: (1) It is necessary to guard against the\r\n     corruption of food and drink within the stomach; therefore,\r\n     easily corruptible food--milk, salt fish, etc.--must not be\r\n     partaken of, and after meals all excessive movement, running\r\n     exercises, bathing, coitus, and other causes that impair the\r\n     digestion, must also be avoided. (2) Everything must be\r\n     avoided that may provoke vomiting. (3) Sweet and viscous\r\n     food--such as dried figs, preserves made with honey,\r\n     etc.--must not be partaken of. (4) Hard things must not be\r\n     broken with the teeth. (5) All food, drink, and other\r\n     substances that set the teeth on edge must be avoided. (6)\r\n     Food that is too hot or too cold must be avoided, and\r\n     especially the rapid succession of hot and cold, and vice\r\n     versa. (7) Leeks must not be eaten, as such a food, by its own\r\n     nature, is injurious to the teeth. (8) The teeth must be\r\n     cleaned at once, after every meal, from the particles of food\r\n     left in them; and for this purpose thin pieces of wood should\r\n     be used, somewhat broad at the ends, but not sharp-pointed or\r\n     edged; and preference should be given to small cypress twigs,\r\n     to the wood of aloes, or pine, rosemary, or juniper and\r\n     similar sorts of wood which are rather bitter and styptic;\r\n     care must, however, be taken not to search too long in the\r\n     dental interstices and not to injure the gums or shake the\r\n     teeth. (9) After this it is necessary to rinse the mouth by\r\n     using by preference a vinous decoction of sage, or one of\r\n     cinnamon, mastich, gallia, moschata, cubeb, juniper seeds,\r\n     root of cyperus, and rosemary leaves. (10) The teeth must be\r\n     rubbed with suitable dentrifices before going to bed, or else\r\n     in the morning before breakfast. Although Avicenna recommended\r\n     various oils for this purpose, Giovanni of Arcoli appears\r\n     very hostile to oleaginous frictions, because he considers\r\n     them very injurious to the stomach. He observes, besides, that\r\n     whilst moderate frictions of brief duration are helpful to the\r\n     teeth, strengthen the gums, prevent the formation of tartar,\r\n     and sweeten the breath, too rough or too prolonged rubbing is,\r\n     on the contrary, harmful to the teeth, and makes them liable\r\n     to many diseases.\"\r\n\r\nAll this is so modern in many ways that we might expect a detailed exact\r\nknowledge of the anatomy of the teeth and even something of their\r\nembryology from Arculanus. It must not be forgotten, however, that\r\ncoming as he does before the Renaissance, the medical sciences in the\r\ntrue sense of the word are as yet unborn. Men are accumulating\r\ninformation for practical purposes but not for the classification and\r\nco-ordination that was to make possible the scientific development of\r\ntheir knowledge.\r\n\r\nGiovanni of Arcoli's acquaintance with the anatomy of the teeth was\r\nrather sadly lacking. He does not know even with certainty the number of\r\nroots that the teeth have. This has been attributed to the fact that he\r\nobtained most of his information from books, and had not the time to\r\nverify descriptions that he had found. It has been argued from this that\r\nhe was himself probably not a practical dentist, and turned to that\r\nspecialty only as a portion of his work as a general surgeon, and that\r\nconsequently he was not sufficiently interested to verify his\r\nstatements. His chapters on dentistry would seem to bear out this\r\nconclusion to some extent, though the very fact that one who was himself\r\nnot specially interested in dental surgery should have succeeded in\r\ngathering together so much that anticipates modern ideas in dentistry,\r\nis of itself a proof of how much knowledge of the subject there was\r\navailable for a serious student of that time. The anatomy of the teeth\r\ncontinued to be rather vague until about the middle of the next century\r\nwhen Eustachius, whose investigations of the anatomy of the head have\r\ndeservedly brought him fame and the attachment of his name to the\r\nEustachian canal, wrote his \"Libellus de Dentibus--Manual of the Teeth,\"\r\nwhich is quite full, accurate, and detailed. Very little has been added\r\nto the microscopic anatomy of the teeth since Eustachius' time. He had\r\nthe advantage, of course, of being intimately in contact with the great\r\ngroup of Renaissance anatomists,--Vesalius, Columbus, Varolius,\r\nFallopius, and the others, the great fathers of anatomy. Besides, his\r\nposition as Papal Physician and Professor of Anatomy at the Papal\r\nMedical School at Rome gave him opportunities for original\r\ninvestigation, such as were not easily obtained elsewhere.\r\n\r\nArculanus can scarcely be blamed, therefore, for not having anticipated\r\nthe Renaissance, and we must take him as merely the culmination of\r\nmedieval knowledge with regard to anatomy and surgery. Medieval medical\r\nmen did not have the time nor apparently the incentive to make formal\r\nmedical science, though it must not be forgotten, as has been said, that\r\nthey did use the knowledge they obtained by their own and others'\r\nobservation to excellent advantage for the practical benefit of ailing\r\nhumanity. The sciences related to medicine are conscious developments\r\nthat follow the evolution of practical medicine, nor must it be\r\nforgotten that far from always serving as an auxiliary to applied\r\nmedical science, often indeed in the history of medicine scientific\r\npursuits have led men away into side issues from which they had to be\r\nbrought back by some genius medical observer. As might be expected,\r\nthen, it is with regard to the practical treatment and general\r\nconsideration of ailments of the teeth that Giovanni of Arcoli is most\r\ninteresting. In this some of his chapters contain a marvellous series of\r\nsurprises.\r\n\r\nArculanus was probably born towards the end of the fourteenth century.\r\nThe date of his death is variously placed as either 1460 or 1484, with\r\nthe probability in favor of the former. From 1412 to 1427 he was\r\nprofessor at Bologna, where in accordance with the non-specializing\r\ntendencies of the time he did not occupy a single chair but several in\r\nsuccession. He seems first to have taught Logic, then Moral Philosophy,\r\nand finally Medicine. His reputation in medicine drew many students to\r\nthe university, and his fame spread all over Italy. The rival University\r\nof Padua then secured him, and he seems to have been for some twenty\r\nyears there. Later apparently he accepted a professor's chair at\r\nFerrara, where the D'Estes were trying to bring their university into\r\nprominence. It was at Ferrara that he died. He was a man of wide\r\nreading, of extensive experience, both of men and medicine, and one of\r\nthe scholars of his time. His works are, as we have said, mainly\r\nexcerpts from earlier writers and particularly the Arabians, but they\r\ncontain enough of hints drawn from his own observation and experience\r\nto make his work of great value.\r\n\r\nWhile, as Gurlt remarks in his \"History of Surgery,\" Arculanus' name is\r\none of those scarcely known--he is usually considered just one of many\r\nobscure writers of the end of the Middle Ages--his writings deserve a\r\nbetter fate. They contain much that is interesting and a great deal that\r\nmust have been of the highest practical value to his contemporaries.\r\nThey attracted wide attention in his own and immediately succeeding\r\ngenerations. The proof of this is that they exist in a large number of\r\nmanuscript copies. Just as soon as printing was introduced his books\r\nappeared in edition after edition. His \"Practica\" was printed in no less\r\nthan seven editions in Venice. Three of them appeared before the end of\r\nthe fifteenth century, which places them among the _incunabula_ of\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\nProbably nothing in the history of human intellectual interest is more\r\nstriking than the excellent judgment displayed by the editors who\r\nselected the works to be printed at this time. Very few of them were\r\ntrivial or insignificant. Fewer still were idle speculations, and most\r\nof them were almost of classical import for literature and science. Four\r\neditions of this work were printed in Venice in the sixteenth century,\r\none of them as late as 1560, when the work done by such men as Vesalius,\r\nColumbus, Eustachius, and Fallopius would seem to have made Arculanus\r\nout of date. The dates of the various editions are Venice, 1483, 1493,\r\n1497, 1504, 1542, 1557, and 1560. Besides there was an edition printed\r\nat Basel in 1540.\r\n\r\nArculanus is said to have re-introduced the use of the seton, that is\r\nthe method of producing intense counter-irritation by the introduction\r\nof some foreign body into an incision in the skin. We owe to him, too,\r\naccording to Pagel in the chapters on medieval medicine in Puschmann's\r\n\"Handbook of the History of Medicine,\" an excellent description of\r\nalcoholic insanity.\r\n\r\nHis directions for the treatment of conditions in the mouth and nose\r\napart from the teeth are quite as explicit and practical, and in many\r\nways quite as great an anticipation of some of our modern notions as\r\nwhat he has to say with regard to the teeth. For instance, in the\r\ntreatment of polyps he says that they should be incised and cauterized.\r\nSoft polyps should be drawn out with a toothed tenaculum as far as can\r\nbe without risk of breaking them off. The incision should be made at the\r\nroot so that nothing or just as little as possible of the pathological\r\nstructure be allowed to remain. It should be cut off with a fine\r\nscissors, or with a narrow file just small enough to permit its ingress\r\ninto the nostrils, or with a scalpel without cutting edges on the sides,\r\nbut only at its extremity, and this cutting edge should be broad and\r\nwell sharpened. If there is danger of hemorrhage, or if there is fear of\r\nit, the instruments with which dissection is made should be fired\r\n(_igniantur_), that is, heated at least to a dull redness. Afterwards\r\nthe stump, if any remains, should be touched with a hot iron or else\r\nwith cauterizing agents so that as far as possible it should be\r\nobliterated.\r\n\r\nAfter the operation a pledget of cotton dipped in the green ointment\r\ndescribed by Rhazes should be placed in the nose. This pledget should\r\nhave a string fastened to it, hanging from the nose in order that it may\r\nbe easily removed. At times it may be necessary to touch the root of the\r\npolyp with a stylet on which cotton has been placed that has been dipped\r\nin _aqua fortis_ (nitric acid). It is important that this cauterizing\r\nfluid should be rather strong so that after a certain number of touches\r\na rather firm eschar is produced. In all these manipulations in the nose\r\nArculanus recommends that the nose should be held well open by means of\r\na nasal speculum. Pictures of all these instruments occur in his extant\r\nworks, and indeed this constitutes one of their most interesting and\r\nvaluable features. They are to be seen in Gurlt's \"History of Surgery.\"\r\n\r\nIn some cases he had seen the polyp was so difficult to get at or was\r\nsituated so far back in the nose that it could not be reached by means\r\nof a tenaculum or scissors, or even the special knife devised for that\r\npurpose. For these patients Arculanus describes an operation that is to\r\nbe found in the older writers on surgery, Paul of AEgina (AEginetus),\r\nAvicenna, and some of the other Arabian surgeons. For this three\r\nhorse-tail hairs are twisted together and knotted in three or four\r\nplaces, and one end is passed through the nostrils and out through the\r\nmouth. The ends of this are then pulled on backward and forward after\r\nthe fashion of a saw. Arculanus remarks evidently with the air of a man\r\nwho has tried it and not been satisfied that this operation is quite\r\nuncertain, and seems to depend a great deal on chance, and much reliance\r\nmust not be placed on it. Arculanus suggests a substitute method by\r\nwhich latent polyps or occult polyps as he calls them may be removed.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely an important disease for which Arculanus has not some\r\ninteresting suggestions, and the more one reads of him the more is one\r\nsurprised to find how many things that we might think of as coming into\r\nthe purview of medicine long after his time or at least as having been\r\nneglected from the time of the Greeks almost down to our own time are\r\nhere treated explicitly, definitely, and with excellent practical\r\nsuggestions. He has a good deal to say with regard to the treatment of\r\nangina, which he calls synanche, or synanchia, or cynanche, or angina.\r\nParasynanche is a synonymous term, but refers to a milder synanche. He\r\ndistinguished four forms of it. In one called canine angina, because the\r\npatient's tongue hangs out of his mouth, somewhat the same as from an\r\noverheated dog in the summer time, while at the same time the mouth is\r\nheld open and he draws his breath pantingly, Arculanus suggests an\r\nunfavorable prognosis, and would seem to refer to those cases of\r\nLudwig's angina in which there is involvement of the tongue and in which\r\nour prognosis continues to be of the very worst even to our own day. At\r\ntimes the angina causes such swelling in the throat that the breathing\r\nis interfered with completely. For this Arculanus' master, Rhazes,\r\nadvised tracheotomy. Arculanus himself, however, apparently hesitated\r\nabout that.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, then, to find that Arculanus is very explicit in\r\nhis treatment of affections of the uvula. He divides its affections into\r\n_apostema, ulcus, putredo sive corrosio, et casus_. _Apostema_ was\r\nabscess, _ulcus_ any rather deep erosion, _putredo_ a gangrenous\r\ncondition, and _casus_ the fall of the uvula. This is the notorious\r\nfalling of the soft palate which has always been in popular medical\r\nliterature at least. Arculanus describes it as a preternatural\r\nelongation of the uvula which sometimes goes to such an extent as to\r\nmake it resemble the tail of a mouse. For shorter elongations he\r\nsuggests the cautery; for longer, excision followed by the cautery so\r\nthat the greater portion of the extending part may be cut off. If people\r\nfear the knife he suggests following Rhazes, the application of an\r\nastringent powder directly to the part by blowing through a tube. His\r\ndirections for the removal of the uvula are very definite. Seat the\r\npatient upon a stool in a bright light while an assistant holds the\r\nhead; after the tongue has been firmly depressed by means of a speculum\r\nlet the assistant hold this speculum in place. With the left hand then\r\ninsert an instrument, a stilus, by which the uvula is pulled forward,\r\nand then remove the end of it by means of a heated knife or some other\r\nprocess of cauterization. The mouth should afterwards be washed out with\r\nfresh milk.\r\n\r\nThe application of a cauterizing solution by means of a cotton swab\r\nwrapped round the end of a sound may be of service in patients who\r\nrefuse the actual cautery. To be successful the application must be\r\nfirmly made and must be frequently repeated.\r\n\r\nAfter this it is not surprising to find that Arculanus has very\r\npractical chapters on all the other ordinary surgical affections.\r\nEmpyema is treated very thoroughly, liver abscess, ascites, which he\r\nwarns must be emptied slowly, ileus especially when it reaches\r\nstercoraceous vomiting, and the various difficulties of urination, he\r\ndivides them into dysuria, ischuria, and stranguria, are all discussed\r\nin quite modern fashion. He gives seven causes for difficulty of\r\nurination. One, some injury of the bladder; two, some lesion of the\r\nurethra; three, some pathological condition in the power to make the\r\nbladder contract; four, some injury of the muscle of the neck of the\r\nbladder; five, some pathological condition of the urine; six, some\r\nkidney trouble, and seven, some pathological condition of the general\r\nsystem. He takes up each one of these and discusses the various phases,\r\ncauses, disposition, and predispositions that bring them about. One\r\nthing these men of the Middle Ages could do, they reasoned logically,\r\nthey ordered what they had to say well, and they wrote it out\r\nstraightforwardly.\r\n\r\nThat Arculanus' work with regard to dentistry was no mere chance and not\r\nsolely theoretic can be understood very well from his predecessors, and\r\nthat it formed a link in a continuous tradition which was well preserved\r\nwe may judge from what is to be found in the writings of his great\r\nsuccessor, Giovanni or John de Vigo, who is considered one of the great\r\nsurgeons of the early Renaissance, and to whom we owe what is probably\r\nthe earliest treatise on \"Gun-shot Wounds.\" John of Vigo was a Papal\r\nphysician and surgeon, generally considered one of the most\r\ndistinguished members of the medical profession of his time. Two\r\nfeatures of his writing on dental diseases deserve mention. He insists\r\nthat abscesses of the gums shall be treated as other abscesses by being\r\nencouraged to come to maturity and then being opened. If they do not\r\nclose promptly, an irritant Egyptian ointment containing verdigris and\r\nalum among other things should be applied to them. In the cure of old\r\nfistulous tracts near the teeth he employs not only this Egyptian\r\nointment but also arsenic and corrosive sublimate. What he has to say\r\nwith regard to the filling of the teeth is, however, most important. He\r\nsays it with extreme brevity, but with the manner of a man thoroughly\r\naccustomed to doing it. \"By means of a drill or file the putrefied or\r\ncorroded part of the tooth should be completely removed. The cavity left\r\nshould then be filled with gold leaf.\" It is evident that the members of\r\nthe Papal court, the Cardinals and the Pope himself, had the advantage\r\nof rather good dentistry at John de Vigo's hands even as early as the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nJohn de Vigo, however, is not medieval. He lived on into the sixteenth\r\ncentury and was influenced deeply by the Renaissance. He counts among\r\nthe makers of modern medicine and surgery, as his authorship of the\r\ntreatise on gun-shot wounds makes clear. He comes in a period that will\r\nbe treated of in a later volume of this series on \"Our Forefathers in\r\nMedicine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nCUSANUS AND THE FIRST SUGGESTION OF LABORATORY METHODS IN MEDICINE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs illustrating how, as we know more about the details of medical\r\nhistory, the beginnings of medical science and medical practice are\r\npushed back farther and farther, a discussion in the _Berliner klinische\r\nWochenschrift_ a dozen years ago is of interest. Professor Ernest von\r\nLeyden, in sketching the history of the taking of the pulse as an\r\nimportant aid in diagnostics, said that John Floyer was usually referred\r\nto as the man who introduced the practice of determining the pulse rate\r\nby means of the watch. His work was done about the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century. Professor von Leyden suggested, however, that\r\nWilliam Harvey, the English physiologist, to whom is usually attributed\r\nthe discovery of the circulation of the blood, had emphasized the value\r\nof the pulse in medical diagnosis, and also suggested the use of the\r\nwatch in counting the pulse. Professor Carl Binz, of the University of\r\nBonn, commenting on these remarks of Professor von Leyden, called\r\nattention to the fact that more than a century before the birth of\r\neither of these men, even the earlier, to whom the careful measurement\r\nof the pulse rate is thus attributed as a discovery, a distinguished\r\nGerman churchman, who died shortly after the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, had suggested a method of accurate estimation of the pulse\r\nthat deserves a place in medical history.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion is so much in accord with modern demands for greater\r\naccuracy in diagnosis that it seems not inappropriate to talk of it as\r\nthe first definite attempt at laboratory methods in the department of\r\nmedicine. The maker of the suggestion, curiously enough, was not a\r\npractising physician, but a mathematician and scholar, Cardinal Nicholas\r\nof Cusa, who is known in history as Cusanus from the Latin name of the\r\ntown Cues on the Moselle River, some twenty-five miles south of Treves,\r\nwhere he was born. His family name, Nicholas Krebs, has been entirely\r\nlost sight of in the name derived from his native town, which is the\r\nonly reason why most of the world knows anything about that town.\r\nCardinal Cusanus suggested that in various forms of disease and at\r\nvarious times of life, as in childhood, boyhood, manhood, and old age,\r\nthe pulse was very different. It would be extremely valuable to have\r\nsome method of accurately estimating, measuring, and recording these\r\ndifferences for medical purposes. At that time watches had not yet been\r\ninvented, and it would have been very difficult to have estimated the\r\ntime by the clocks, for almost the only clocks in existence were those\r\nin the towers of the cathedrals and of the public buildings. The first\r\nwatches, Nuremberg eggs, as they were called, were not made by Peter\r\nHenlein until well on into the next century. The only method of\r\nmeasuring time with any accuracy in private houses was the clepsydra or\r\nwater-clock, which measured the time intervals by the flow of a\r\ndefinite amount of water. Cardinal Cusanus suggested then that the\r\nwater-clock should be employed for estimating the pulse frequency. His\r\nidea was that the amount of water which flowed while a hundred beats of\r\nthe pulse were counted, should be weighed, and this weight compared with\r\nthat of the average weight of water which flowed while a hundred beats\r\nof the normal pulse of a number of individuals of the same age and\r\nconstitution were being counted.\r\n\r\nThis was a very single and a very ingenious suggestion. We have no means\r\nof knowing now whether it was adopted to any extent or not. It may seem\r\nrather surprising that a cardinal should have been the one to make such\r\na suggestion. Cusanus, however, was very much interested in mathematics\r\nand in the natural sciences, and we have many wonderful suggestions from\r\nhis pen. He was the first, for instance, to suggest, more than a century\r\nbefore Copernicus, that the earth was not the centre of the universe,\r\nand that it would not be absolutely at rest or, as he said, devoid of\r\nall motion. His words are: \"_Terra igitur, quae centrum esse nequit, motu\r\nomni carere non potest_.\" He described very clearly how the earth moved\r\nround its own axis, and then he added, what cannot fail to be a\r\nsurprising declaration for those in the modern times who think such an\r\nidea of much later origin, that he considered that the earth itself\r\ncannot be fixed, but moves as do the other stars in the heavens. The\r\nexpression is so astonishing at that time in the world's history that it\r\nseems worth the while to give it in its original form, so that it may be\r\nseen clearly that it is not any subsequent far-fetched interpretation\r\nof his opinion, but the actual words themselves, that convey this idea.\r\nHe said: \"_Consideravi quod terra ista non potest esse fixa, sed movetur\r\nut aliae stellae._\"\r\n\r\nHow clearly Cusanus anticipated another phase of our modern views may be\r\njudged from what he has to say in \"De Docta Ignorantia\" with regard to\r\nthe constitution of the sun. It is all the more surprising that he\r\nshould by some form of intuition reach such a conclusion, for the\r\nordinary sources of information with regard to the sun would not suggest\r\nsuch an expression except to a genius, whose intuition outran by far the\r\nknowledge of his time. The Cardinal said: \"To a spectator on the surface\r\nof the sun the splendor which appears to us would be invisible, since it\r\ncontains, as it were, an earth for its central mass, with a\r\ncircumferential envelope of light and heat, and between the two an\r\natmosphere of water and clouds and of ambient air.\" After reading that\r\nbit of precious astronomical science announced nearly five centuries\r\nago, it is easy to understand how Copernicus could have anticipated\r\nother phases of our knowledge, as he did in his declarations that the\r\nfigure of the earth is not a sphere, but is somewhat irregular, and that\r\nthe orbit of the earth is not circular.\r\n\r\nCusanus was an extremely practical man, and was constantly looking for\r\nand devising methods of applying practical principles of science to\r\nordinary life. As we shall see in discussing his suggestion for the\r\nestimation of the pulse rate later on, he made many other similar\r\nsuggestions for diagnostic purposes in medicine, and set forth other\r\napplications of mathematics and mechanics to his generation.\r\n\r\nMany of Cusanus' books have curiously modern names. He wrote, for\r\ninstance, a series of mathematical treatises, in Latin of course, on\r\n\"Geometric Transmutations,\" on \"Arithmetical Complements,\" on\r\n\"Mathematical Complements,\" on \"Mathematical Perfection,\" and on \"The\r\nCorrection of the Calendar.\" In his time the calendar was in error by\r\nmore than nine days, and Cusanus was one of those who aroused sufficient\r\ninterest in the subject, so that in the next century the correction was\r\nactually made by the great Jesuit mathematician, Father Clavius. Perhaps\r\nthe work of Cusanus that is best known is that \"On Learned Ignorance--De\r\nDocta Ignorantia,\" in which the Cardinal points out how many things that\r\neducated people think they know are entirely wrong. It reminds one very\r\nmuch of Josh Billings's remark that it is not so much the ignorance of\r\nmankind that makes them ridiculous, as the knowing so many things that\r\nain't so. It is from this work that the astronomical quotations which we\r\nhave made are taken. The book that is of special interest to physicians\r\nis his dialogue \"On Static Experiments,\" which he wrote in 1450, and\r\nwhich contains the following passages:\r\n\r\n     \"Since the weight of the blood and the urine of a healthy and\r\n     of a diseased man, of a young man and an old man, of a German\r\n     and an African, is different for each individual, why would it\r\n     not be a great benefit to the physician to have all of these\r\n     various differences classified? For I think that a physician\r\n     would make a truer judgment from the weight of the urine\r\n     viewed in connection with its color than he could make from\r\n     its color alone, which might be fallacious. So, also, weight\r\n     might be used as a means of identifying the roots, the stems,\r\n     the leaves, the fruits, the seeds, and the juice of plants if\r\n     the various weights of all the plants were properly noted,\r\n     together with their variety, according to locality. In this\r\n     way the physician would appreciate their nature better by\r\n     means of their weight than if he judged them by their taste\r\n     alone. He might know, then, from a comparison of the weights\r\n     of the plants and their various parts when compared with the\r\n     weight of the blood and the urine, how to make an application\r\n     and a dosage of drugs from the concordances and differences of\r\n     the medicaments, and even might be able to make an excellent\r\n     prognosis in the same way. Thus, from static experiments, he\r\n     would approach by a more precise knowledge to every kind of\r\n     information.\r\n\r\n     \"Do you not think if you would permit the water from the\r\n     narrow opening of a clepsydra [water-clock] to flow into a\r\n     basin for as long as was necessary to count the pulse a\r\n     hundred times in a healthy young man, and then do the same\r\n     thing for an ailing young man, that there would be a\r\n     noticeable difference between the weights of the water that\r\n     would flow during the period? From the weight of the water,\r\n     therefore, one would arrive at a better knowledge of the\r\n     differences in the pulse of the young and the old, the healthy\r\n     and the unhealthy, and so, also, as to information with regard\r\n     to various diseases, since there would be one weight and,\r\n     therefore, one pulse in one disease, and another weight and\r\n     another pulse in another disease. In this way a better\r\n     judgment of the differences in the pulse could be obtained\r\n     than from the touch of the vein, just as more can be known\r\n     from the urine about its weight than from its color alone.\r\n\r\n     \"Just in the same way would it not be possible to make a more\r\n     accurate judgment with regard to the breathing, if the\r\n     inspirations and expirations were studied according to the\r\n     weight of the water that passed during a certain interval? If,\r\n     while water was flowing from a clepsydra, one were to count a\r\n     hundred expirations in a boy, and then in an old man, of\r\n     course, there would not be the same amount of water at the end\r\n     of the enumeration. Then this same thing might be done for\r\n     other ages and states of the body. As a consequence, when the\r\n     physician once knew what the weight of water that represented\r\n     the number of expirations of a healthy boy or youth, and then\r\n     of an individual of the same age ill of some infirmity or\r\n     other, there is no doubt that, by this observation, he will\r\n     come to a knowledge of the health or illness and something\r\n     about the case, and, perhaps, also with more certainty would\r\n     be able to choose the remedy and the dose required. If he\r\n     found in a healthy young man apparently the same weight as in\r\n     an old and decrepit individual, he might readily be brought to\r\n     the conclusion that the young man would surely die, and in\r\n     this way have some evidence for his prognosis in the case.\r\n     Besides, if in fevers, in the same way, careful studies were\r\n     made of the differences in the weight of water for pulse and\r\n     respiration in the warm and the cold paroxysms, would it not\r\n     be possible thus to know the disease better and, perhaps, also\r\n     get a more efficacious remedy?\"\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from this passage, Cusanus had many more ideas than\r\nmerely the accurate estimation of the pulse frequency when he suggested\r\nthe use of the water-clock. Evidently the thought had come to him that\r\nthe specific gravity of the substances, that is, their weight in\r\ncomparison to the weight of water, might be valuable information.\r\nBefore his time, physicians had depended only on the color and the taste\r\nof the urine for diagnostic purposes. He proposed that they should weigh\r\nit, and even suggested that they should weigh, also, the blood, I\r\nsuppose in case of venesection, for comparison's sake. He also thought\r\nthat the comparative weight of various roots, stems, leaves, juices of\r\nplants might give hints for the therapeutic uses of these substances.\r\nThis is the sort of idea that we are apt to think of as typically\r\nmodern. Specific gravities and atomic weights have been more than once\r\nsupposed to represent laws in therapeutics, which so far, however, we\r\nhave not succeeded in finding, but it is interesting to realize that it\r\nis nearly five hundred years since the first thought in this line was\r\nclearly expressed by a distinguished thinker and scientific writer.\r\n\r\nThere are many interesting expressions in Cusanus' writings which\r\ncontradict most of the impressions commonly entertained with regard to\r\nthe scholars of the Middle Ages. It is usually assumed that they did not\r\nthink seriously, but speculatively, that they feared to think for\r\nthemselves, neglected the study of nature around them, considered\r\nauthority the important source of knowledge, and were as far as possible\r\nfrom the standpoint of modern scientific students and investigators.\r\nHere is a passage from Nicholas, on knowing and thinking, that might\r\nwell have been written by a great intellectual man at any time in the\r\nworld's history, and that could only emanate from a profound scholar at\r\nany time.\r\n\r\n     \"To know and to think, to see the truth with the eye of the\r\n     mind, is always a joy. The older a man grows the greater is\r\n     the pleasure which it affords him, and the more he devotes\r\n     himself to the search after truth, the stronger grows his\r\n     desire of possessing it. As love is the life of the heart, so\r\n     is the endeavor after knowledge and truth the life of the\r\n     mind. In the midst of the movements of time, of the daily work\r\n     of life, of its perplexities and contradictions, we should\r\n     lift our gaze fearlessly to the clear vault of heaven, and\r\n     seek ever to obtain a firmer grasp of and a keener insight\r\n     into the origin of all goodness and beauty, the capacities of\r\n     our own hearts and minds, the intellectual fruits of mankind\r\n     throughout the centuries, and the wondrous works of nature\r\n     around us; at the same time remembering always that in\r\n     humility alone lies true greatness, and that knowledge and\r\n     wisdom are alone profitable in so far as our lives are\r\n     governed by them.\"\r\n\r\nThe career of Nicholas of Cusa is interesting, because it sums up so\r\nmany movements, and, above all, educational currents in the fifteenth\r\ncentury. He was born in the first year of the century, and lived to be\r\nsixty-four. He was the son of a wine grower, and attracted the attention\r\nof his teachers because of his intellectual qualities. In spite of\r\ncomparatively straitened circumstances, then, he was afforded the best\r\nopportunities of the time for education. He went first to the school of\r\nthe Brethren of the Common Life at Deventer, the intellectual cradle of\r\nso many of the scholars of this century. Such men as Erasmus, Conrad\r\nMutianus, Johann Sintheim, Hermann von dem Busche, whom Strauss calls\r\n\"the missionary of human wisdom,\" and the teacher of most of these,\r\nAlexander Hegius, who has been termed the schoolmaster of Germany, with\r\nNicholas of Cusa and Rudolph Agricola and others, who might readily be\r\nmentioned, are the fruits of the teaching of these schools of the\r\nBrethren of the Common Life, in one of which Thomas a Kempis, the author\r\nof \"The Imitation of Christ,\" was, for seventy years out of his long\r\nlife of ninety, a teacher.\r\n\r\nCusanus succeeded so well at school that he was later sent to the\r\nUniversity of Heidelberg, and subsequently to Padua, where he took up\r\nthe study of Roman law, receiving his doctorate at the age of\r\ntwenty-three. This series of educational opportunities will be\r\nsurprising only to those who do not know educational realities at the\r\nbeginning of the fifteenth century. There has never been a time when a\r\nserious seeker after knowledge could find more inspiration. On his\r\nreturn to Germany, Father Krebs became canon of the cathedral in\r\nCoblenz. This gave him a modest income, and leisure for intellectual\r\nwork which was eagerly employed. He was scarcely more than thirty when\r\nhe was chosen as a delegate to the Council at Basel. After this he was\r\nmade Archdeacon of the Cathedral of Luettich, and from this time his rise\r\nin ecclesiastical preferment was rapid. He had attracted so much\r\nattention at the Council of Basel that he was chosen as a legate of the\r\nPope for the bringing about certain reforms in Germany. Subsequently he\r\nwas sent on ecclesiastical missions to the Netherlands, and even to\r\nConstantinople. At the early age of forty he was made a Cardinal. After\r\nthis he was always considered as one of the most important consultors\r\nof the Papacy in all matters relating to Germany. During the last\r\ntwenty-five years of his life in all the relations of the Holy See to\r\nGermany, appeal was constantly made to the wisdom, the experience, and\r\nthe thoroughly conservative, yet foreseeing, judgment of this son of the\r\npeople, whose education had lifted him up to be one of the leaders of\r\nmen in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was during this time that he wrote most of his books on mathematics,\r\nwhich have earned for him a prominent place in Cantor's \"History of\r\nMathematics,\" about a score of pages being devoted to his work. Much of\r\nhis thinking was done while riding on horseback or in the rude vehicles\r\nof the day on the missions to which he was sent as Papal Legate. He is\r\nsaid to have worked out the formula for the cycloid curve while watching\r\nthe path described by flies that had lighted on the wheels of his\r\ncarriage, and were carried forward and around by them. His scientific\r\nbooks, though they included such startling anticipations of Copernicus'\r\ndoctrines as we have already quoted (Copernicus did not publish the\r\nfirst sketch of his theory for more than a quarter of a century after\r\nCusanus' death), far from disturbing his ecclesiastical advancement or\r\ninjuring his career as a churchman, seem actually to have been\r\nconsidered as additional reasons for considering him worthy of\r\nconfidence and consultation.\r\n\r\nAs the result of his careful studies of conditions in Germany, he\r\nrealized very clearly how much of unfortunate influence the political\r\nstatus of the German people, with their many petty rulers and the\r\nhampering of development consequent upon the trivial rivalries, the\r\nconstant bickerings, and the inordinate jealousies of these numerous\r\nprincelings, had upon his native country. Accordingly, towards the end\r\nof his life he sketched what he thought would be the ideal political\r\nstatus for the German people. As in everything that he wrote, he went\r\nstraight to the heart of the matter and, without mincing words, stated\r\njust exactly what he thought ought to be done. Considering that this\r\nscheme of Cusanus for the prosperity and right government of the German\r\npeople was not accomplished until more than four centuries after his\r\ndeath, it is interesting, indeed, to realize how this clergyman of the\r\nmiddle of the fifteenth century should have come to any such thought.\r\nNothing, however, makes it clearer than this, that it is not time that\r\nfosters thinking, but that great men at any time come to great thoughts.\r\nCusanus wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"The law and the kingdom should be placed under the protection\r\n     of a single ruler or authority. The small separate governments\r\n     of princes and counts consume a disproportionately large\r\n     amount of revenue without furnishing any real security. For\r\n     this reason we must have a single government, and for its\r\n     support we must have a definite amount of the income from\r\n     taxes and revenues yearly set aside by a representative\r\n     parliament and before this parliament (reichstag) must be\r\n     given every year a definite account of the money that was\r\n     spent during the preceding year.\"\r\n\r\nCusanus' life and work stand, then, as a type of the accomplishment, the\r\nopportunities, the power of thought, the practical scholarship, the\r\nmathematical accuracy, the fine scientific foresight of a scholar of\r\nthe fifteenth century. For us, in medicine, it is interesting indeed to\r\nrealize that it is from a man of this kind that a great new departure in\r\nmedicine with regard to the employment of exact methods of diagnosis had\r\nits first suggestion in modern times. The origin of that suggestion is\r\ntypical. It has practically always been true that it was not the man who\r\nhad exhausted, or thought that he had done so, all previous medical\r\nknowledge, who made advances in medicine for us. It has nearly always\r\nbeen a young man early in his career, and at a time when, as yet, his\r\nmind was not overloaded with the medical theories of his own time.\r\nCusanus was probably not more than thirty when he made the suggestion\r\nwhich represents the first practical hint for the use of laboratory\r\nmethods in modern medicine. It came out of his thoughtful consideration\r\nof medical problems rather than from a store of garnered information as\r\nto what others thought. It is a lesson in the precious value of breadth\r\nof education and serious training of mind for real progress at all\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nBASIL VALENTINE, LAST OF THE ALCHEMISTS, FIRST OF THE CHEMISTS\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Fieri enim potest ut operator erret et a via regia deflectat,\r\n     sed ut erret natura quando recte tractatur fieri non potest.\"\r\n\r\n     \"For it is quite possible that the physician should err and be\r\n     turned aside from the straight (royal) road, but that nature\r\n     when she is rightly treated should err is quite impossible.\"\r\n\r\nThis is one of the preliminary maxims of a treatise on medicine written\r\nby a physician born not later than the first half of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and who may have lived even somewhat earlier. We are so prone\r\nto think of the men of that time as utterly dependent on authority, not\r\ndaring to follow their own observation, suspecting nature, and almost\r\nsure to be convinced that only by going counter to her could success in\r\nthe treatment of disease be obtained, that it is a surprise to most\r\npeople to find how completely the attitude of mind, that is supposed to\r\nbe so typically modern in this regard, was anticipated full four\r\ncenturies ago. There are other expressions of this same great physician\r\nand medical writer, Basil Valentine, which serve to show how faithfully\r\nhe strove with the lights that he had to work out the treatment of\r\npatients, just as we do now, by trying to find out nature's way, so as\r\nto imitate her beneficent processes and purposes. It is quite clear\r\nthat he is but one of many faithful, patient observers and\r\nexperimenters--true scientists in the best sense of the word--who lived\r\nin all the centuries of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nSpeculations and experiments with regard to the elixir of life, the\r\nphilosopher's stone, and the transmutation of metals, are presumed to\r\nhave filled up all the serious interests of the alchemists, supposed to\r\nbe almost the only scientists of those days. As a matter of fact,\r\nhowever, men were making original observations of profound significance,\r\nand these were considered so valuable by their contemporaries that,\r\nthough printing had not yet been invented, even the immense labor\r\ninvolved in the manifold copying of large folio volumes by the slow hand\r\nprocess did not suffice to deter them from multiplying the writings of\r\nthese men so numerously that they were preserved in many copies for\r\nfuture generations, until the printing press came to perpetuate them.\r\n\r\nOf this there is abundant evidence in the preceding pages as regards\r\nmedicine, and, above all, surgery, while a summary of accomplishments of\r\nworkers in other departments will be found in Appendix II, \"Science at\r\nthe Medieval Universities.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, with some of the supposed\r\nfoundations of modern chemistry crumbling to pieces under the influence\r\nof the peculiarly active light thrown upon our nineteenth century\r\nchemical theories by the discovery of radium, and our observations on\r\nradio-active elements generally, there is a reawakening of interest in\r\nsome of the old-time chemical observers, whose work used to be laughed\r\nat as so unscientific, or, at most, but a caricature of real science,\r\nand whose theory of the transmutation of elements into one another was\r\nconsidered so absurd. It is interesting in the light of this to recall\r\nthat the idea that the elementary substances were essentially distinct\r\nfrom each other, and that it would be impossible under any circumstances\r\nto convert one element into another, belongs entirely to the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Even so deeply scientific a mind as that of Newton, in the\r\npreceding century, could not bring itself to acknowledge the tradition,\r\nthat came to be accepted subsequent to his time, of the absurdity of\r\nmetallic transformation. On the contrary, he believed quite formally in\r\ntransmutation as a basic chemical principle, and declared that it might\r\nbe expected to occur at any time. He had seen specimens of gold ores in\r\nconnection with metallic copper, and concluded that this was a\r\nmanifestation of the natural transformation of one of these yellow\r\nmetals into the other.\r\n\r\nWith the discovery that radium transforms itself into helium, and that,\r\nindeed, all the so-called radioactivities of the heavy metals are\r\nprobably due to a natural transmutation process constantly at work, the\r\nideas of the older chemists cease entirely to be a subject for\r\namusement. The physical chemists of the present day are very ready to\r\nadmit that the old teaching of the absolute independence of something\r\nover seventy elements is no longer tenable, except as a working\r\nhypothesis. The doctrine of \"matter and form,\" taught for so many\r\ncenturies by the scholastic philosophers, which proclaimed that all\r\nmatter is composed of two principles, an underlying material substratum,\r\nand a dynamic or informing principle, has now more acknowledged\r\nverisimilitude, or lies at least closer to the generally accepted ideas\r\nof the most progressive scientists, than it has at any time for the last\r\ntwo or three centuries. Not only the great physicists, but also the\r\ngreat chemists, are speculating along lines that suggest the existence\r\nof but one form of matter, modified according to the energies that it\r\npossesses under a varying physical and chemical environment. This is,\r\nafter all, only a restatement in modern times of the teaching of St.\r\nThomas of Aquin, in the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, then, that there should be a reawakening of\r\ninterest in the lives of some of the men, who, dominated by some of the\r\nearlier scholastic ideas, by the tradition of the possibility of finding\r\nthe philosopher's stone, which would transmute the baser metals into the\r\nprecious metals, devoted themselves with quite as much zeal as any\r\nmodern chemist to the observation of chemical phenomena. One of the most\r\ninteresting of these--indeed, he might well be said to be the greatest\r\nof the alchemists--is the man whose only name that we know is that which\r\nappears on a series of manuscripts written in the High German dialect of\r\nthe end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth century.\r\nThat name is Basil Valentine, and the writer, according to the best\r\nhistorical traditions, was a Benedictine monk. The name Basil Valentine\r\nmay only have been a pseudonym, for it has been impossible to trace it\r\namong the records of the monasteries of the time. That the writer was a\r\nmonk, however, there seems to be no room for doubt, for his writings\r\ngive abundant evidence of it, and, besides, in printed form they began\r\nto have their vogue at a time when there was little likelihood of their\r\nbeing attributed to a monastic source, unless an indubitable tradition\r\nconnected them with some monastery.\r\n\r\nThis Basil Valentine (to accept the only name we have) did so much for\r\nthe science of the composition of substances that he eminently deserves\r\nthe designation that has been given him of the last of the alchemists\r\nand the first of the chemists. There is practically a universal\r\nrecognition of the fact now that he deserves also the title of the\r\nFounder of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, not only because of the value of\r\nthe observations contained in his writings, but also because of the fact\r\nthat they proved so suggestive to certain scientific geniuses during the\r\ncentury succeeding Valentine's life. Almost more than to have added to\r\nthe precious heritage of knowledge for mankind, it is a boon for a\r\nscientific observer to have awakened the spirit of observation in\r\nothers, and to be the founder of a new school of thought. This Basil\r\nValentine undoubtedly did, and, in the Renaissance, the incentive from\r\nhis writings for such men as Paracelsus is easy to appreciate.\r\n\r\nBesides, his work furnishes evidence that the investigating spirit was\r\nabroad just when it is usually supposed not to have been, for the\r\nThuringian monk surely did not do all his investigation alone, but must\r\nhave owed, as well as given, many a suggestion to his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nSome ten years ago, when Sir Michael Foster, professor of physiology in\r\nthe University of Cambridge, England, was invited to deliver the Lane\r\nLectures at the Cooper Medical College in San Francisco, he took for his\r\nsubject \"The History of Physiology.\" In the course of his lecture on\r\n\"The Rise of Chemical Physiology\" he began with the name of Basil\r\nValentine, who first attracted men's attention to the many chemical\r\nsubstances around them that might be used in the treatment of disease,\r\nand said of him:\r\n\r\n     \"He was one of the alchemists, but in addition to his\r\n     inquiries into the properties of metals and his search for the\r\n     philosopher's stone, he busied himself with the nature of\r\n     drugs, vegetable and mineral, and with their action as\r\n     remedies for disease. He was no anatomist, no physiologist,\r\n     but rather what nowadays we should call a pharmacologist. He\r\n     did not care for the problem of the body, all he sought to\r\n     understand was how the constituents of the soil and of plants\r\n     might be treated so as to be available for healing the sick\r\n     and how they produced their effects. We apparently owe to him\r\n     the introduction of many chemical substances, for instance of\r\n     hydrochloric acid, which he prepared from oil and vitriol of\r\n     salt, and of many vegetable drugs. And he was apparently the\r\n     author of certain conceptions which, as we shall see, played\r\n     an important part in the development of chemistry and of\r\n     physiology. To him, it seems, we owe the idea of the three\r\n     'elements,' as they were and have been called, replacing the\r\n     old idea of the ancients of the four elements--earth, air,\r\n     fire, and water. It must be remembered, however, that both in\r\n     the ancient and the new idea the word 'element' was not\r\n     intended to mean that which it means to us now, a fundamental\r\n     unit of matter, but a general quality or property of matter.\r\n     The three elements of Valentine were: (1) sulphur, or that\r\n     which is combustible, which is changed or destroyed, or which\r\n     at all events disappears during burning or combustion; (2)\r\n     mercury, that which temporarily disappears during burning or\r\n     combustion, which is dissociated in the burning from the body\r\n     burnt, but which may be recovered, that is to say, that which\r\n     is volatile, and (3) salt, that which is fixed, the residue or\r\n     ash which remains after burning.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a little bit hard in our time for most people to understand just\r\nhow such a development of thoroughly scientific chemical notions, with\r\ninvestigations for their practical application, should have come before\r\nthe end of the Middle Ages. This difficulty of understanding, however,\r\nwe are coming to realize in recent years, is entirely due to our\r\nignorance of the period. We have known little or nothing about the\r\nscience of the Middle Ages, because it was hidden away in rare old\r\nbooks, in rather difficult Latin, not easy to get at, and still less\r\neasy to understand always, and we have been prone to conclude that since\r\nwe knew nothing about it, there must have been nothing. Just inasmuch as\r\nwe have learned something definite about the medieval scholars, our\r\nadmiration has increased. Professor Clifford Allbutt, the Regius\r\nProfessor of Medicine at the University of Cambridge, in his Harveian\r\nOration, delivered before the Royal College of Physicians in 1900, on\r\n\"Science and Medieval Thought\" (London, 1901), declared that \"the\r\nschoolmen, in digging for treasure, cultivated the field of knowledge\r\neven for Galileo and Harvey, for Newton and Darwin.\" He might have added\r\nthat they had laid foundations in all our modern sciences, in chemistry\r\nquite as well as in astronomy, physiology, and the medical sciences, in\r\nmathematics and botany.\r\n\r\nIn chemistry the advances made during the thirteenth, fourteenth, and\r\nfifteenth centuries were, perhaps, even more noteworthy than those in\r\nany other department of science. Albertus Magnus, who taught at Paris,\r\nwrote no less than sixteen treatises on chemical subjects, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that he was a theologian as well as a\r\nscientist, and that his printed works fill some _fifteen folio volumes_,\r\nhe somehow found the time to make many observations for himself, and\r\nperformed numberless experiments in order to clear up doubts. The larger\r\nhistories of chemistry accord him his proper place, and hail him as a\r\ngreat founder in chemistry, and a pioneer in original investigation.\r\n\r\nEven St. Thomas of Aquin, much as he was occupied with theology and\r\nphilosophy, found some time to devote to chemical questions. After all,\r\nthis is only what might have been expected of the favorite pupil of\r\nAlbertus Magnus. Three treatises on chemical subjects from Aquinas' pen\r\nhave been preserved for us, and it is to him that we are said to owe the\r\nuse, in the Western world at least, of the word amalgam, which he first\r\nemployed in describing various chemical methods of metallic combination\r\nwith mercury that were discovered in the search for the genuine\r\ntransmutation of metals.\r\n\r\nAlbertus Magnus' other great scientific pupil, Roger Bacon, the English\r\nFranciscan friar, followed more closely in the scientific ways of his\r\ngreat master, devoting himself almost entirely to the physical\r\nsciences. Altogether he wrote some eighteen treatises on chemical\r\nsubjects. For a long time it was considered that he was the inventor of\r\ngunpowder, though this is now known to have been introduced into Europe\r\nby the Arabs. Roger Bacon studied gunpowder and various other explosive\r\ncombinations in considerable detail, and it is for this reason that he\r\nobtained the undeserved reputation of being an original discoverer in\r\nthis line. How well he realized how much might be accomplished by means\r\nof the energy stored up in explosives, can, perhaps, be best appreciated\r\nfrom the fact that he suggested that boats would go along the rivers and\r\nacross seas without either sails or oars, and that carriages would go\r\nalong the streets without horse or man power. He considered that man\r\nwould eventually invent a method of harnessing these explosive mixtures,\r\nand of utilizing their energies for his purposes without danger. It is\r\ncuriously interesting to find, as we begin the twentieth century, and\r\ngasolene is so commonly used for the driving of automobiles and motor\r\nboats, and is being introduced even into heavier transportation as the\r\nmost available source of energy for suburban traffic, at least, that\r\nthis generation should only be fulfilling the idea of the old Franciscan\r\nfriar of the thirteenth century, who prophesied that in explosives there\r\nwas the secret of eventually manageable energy for transportation\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nSucceeding centuries were not as fruitful in great scientists as the\r\nthirteenth, and yet, in the second half of the thirteenth, there was a\r\nPope, John XXI, who had been a physician and professor of medicine\r\nbefore his election to the Papacy, three of whose scientific\r\ntreatises--one on the transmutation of metals, which he considers an\r\nimpossibility, at least as far as the manufacture of gold and silver was\r\nconcerned; a treatise on diseases of the eyes, to which good authorities\r\nhave not hesitated to give lavish praise for its practical value,\r\nconsidering the conditions in which it was written; and, finally, his\r\ntreatise on the preservation of the health, written when he was himself\r\nover eighty years of age--are all considered by good authorities as\r\nworthy of the best scientific spirit of the time.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourteenth century, Arnold of Villanova, the inventor of\r\nnitric acid, and the two Hollanduses, kept up the tradition of original\r\ninvestigation in chemistry. Altogether there are some dozen treatises\r\nfrom these three men on chemical subjects. The Hollanduses particularly\r\ndid their work in a spirit of thoroughly frank, original investigation.\r\nThey were more interested in minerals than in any other class of\r\nsubstances, but did not waste much time on the question of transmutation\r\nof metals. Professor Thompson, the professor of chemistry at Edinburgh,\r\nsaid, in his \"History of Chemistry,\" many years ago, that the\r\nHollanduses give very clear descriptions of their processes of treating\r\nminerals in investigating their composition, and these serve to show\r\nthat their knowledge was by no means entirely theoretical, or acquired\r\nonly from books.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, then, to have a great investigating pharmacologist\r\ncome along sometime about the beginning of the fifteenth century, when,\r\naccording to the best authorities, Basil Valentine was born. From\r\ntraditions he seems to have had a rather long life, and his years run\r\nnearly parallel with his century. His career is a typical example of the\r\npersonally obscure and intellectually brilliant lives which the old\r\nmonks lived. Probably in nothing have recent generations been more\r\ndeceived in historical matters than in their estimation of the\r\nintellectual attainments and accomplishment of the old monks. The more\r\nthat we know of them, not from second-hand authorities, but from their\r\nown books and from what they accomplished in art and architecture, in\r\nagriculture, in science of all kinds, the more do we realize what busy\r\nmen they were, and appreciate what genius they often brought to the\r\nsolution of great problems. We have had much negative pseudo-information\r\nbrought together with the definite purpose of discrediting monasticism,\r\nand now that positive information is gradually being accumulated, it is\r\nalmost a shock to find how different are the realities of the story of\r\nthe intellectual life during the Middle Ages from what many writers had\r\npictured them.\r\n\r\nTo those who may be surprised that a man who did great things in\r\nmedicine should have lived during the fifteenth century, it may be well\r\nto recall the names and a little of the accomplishment of the men of\r\nthis period, who were Basil Valentine's contemporaries, at least in the\r\nsense that some portion of their lives and influence was coeval with\r\nhis. Before the end of this century Columbus had discovered America, and\r\nby no happy accident, for many men of his generation did\r\ncorrespondingly great work. Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa had developed\r\nmathematics and applied mathematical ideas to the heavens, so that he\r\ncould announce the conclusion that the earth was a star, like the other\r\nstars, and moved in the heavens as they do. Contemporary with Cusanus\r\nwas Regiomontanus, who has been proclaimed the father of modern\r\nastronomy, and a distinguished mathematician. Toscanelli, the Florentine\r\nastronomer, whose years run almost parallel with those of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, did fine scholarly work, which deeply influenced Columbus and\r\nthe great navigators of the time. The universities in Italy were\r\nattracting students from all over Europe, and such men as Linacre and\r\nDr. Caius went down there from England. Raphael was but a young man at\r\nthe end of the century, but he had done some noteworthy painting before\r\nit closed. Leonardo da Vinci was born just about the middle of the\r\ncentury, and did some marvellous work before the end of that century.\r\nMichael Angelo was only twenty-five at the close of the century, but he,\r\ntoo, did fine work, even at this early age. Among the other great\r\nItalian painters of this century are Fra Angelico, Perugino, Raphael's\r\nmaster, Pinturicchio, Signorelli, the pupil of his uncle, Vasari, almost\r\nas distinguished, Botticelli, Titian, and very many others, who would\r\nhave been famous leaders in art in any other but this supremely great\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIt was not only in Italy, however, that there was a wonderful outburst\r\nof genius at this time, for Germany also saw the rise of a number of\r\ngreat men during this period. Jacob Wimpheling, the \"Schoolmaster of\r\nGermany,\" as he has been called, whose educational work did much to\r\ndetermine the character of German education for two centuries, was born\r\nin 1450. Rudolph Agricola, who influenced the intellectual Europe of\r\nthis time deeply, was born in 1443. Erasmus, one of the greatest of\r\nscholars, of teachers, and of controversialists, was born in 1467.\r\nJohann Reuchlin, the great linguist, who, next to Erasmus, is the most\r\nimportant character in the German Renaissance, was born in 1455. Then\r\nthere was Sebastian Brant, the author of \"The Ship of Fools,\" and\r\nAlexander Hegius, both of this same period. The most influential of them\r\nall, Thomas a Kempis, who died in 1471, and whose little book, \"The\r\nFollowing of Christ,\" has influenced every generation deeply ever since,\r\nwas probably a close contemporary of Basil Valentine. When one knows\r\nwhat European, and especially German scholars, were accomplishing at\r\nthis time, no room is left for surprise that Basil Valentine should have\r\nlived and done work in medicine at this period that was to influence\r\ndeeply the after history of medicine.\r\n\r\nMost of what Basil Valentine did was accomplished in the first half of\r\nthe fifteenth century. Coming, as he did, before the invention of\r\nprinting, when the spirit of tradition was more rife and dominating than\r\nit has been since, it is almost needless to say that there are many\r\ncurious legends associated with his name. Two centuries before his time,\r\nRoger Bacon, doing his work in England, had succeeded in attracting so\r\nmuch attention even from the common people, because of his wonderful\r\nscientific discoveries, that his name became a byword, and many strange\r\nmagical feats were attributed to him. Friar Bacon was the great wizard,\r\neven in the plays of the Elizabethan period. A number of the same sort\r\nof myths attached themselves to the Benedictine monk of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. He was proclaimed in popular story to have been a wonderful\r\nmagician. Even his manuscript, it was said, had not been published\r\ndirectly, but had been hidden in a pillar in the church attached to his\r\nmonastery, and had been discovered there after the splitting open of the\r\npillar by a bolt of lightning from heaven. It is the extension of this\r\ntradition that has sometimes led to the assumption that Valentine lived\r\nin an earlier century, some even going so far as to say that he, too,\r\nlike Roger Bacon, was a product of the thirteenth century. It seems\r\nreasonably possible, however, to separate the traditional from what is\r\nactual in his existence, and thus to obtain some idea at least of his\r\nwork, if not of the details of his life. The internal evidence from his\r\nworks enables the historian of science to place his writing within half\r\na century of the discovery of America.\r\n\r\nOne of the myths that have gathered around the name of Basil Valentine,\r\nbecause it has become a commonplace in philology, has probably made him\r\nmore generally known than any of his actual discoveries. In one of the\r\nmost popular of the old-fashioned text-books of chemistry in use about\r\nhalf a century ago, in the chapter on antimony, there was a story that\r\nstudents, if I may judge from my own experience, never forgot. It was\r\nsaid that Basil Valentine, a monk of the Middle Ages, was the discoverer\r\nof this substance. After having experimented with it in a number of\r\nways, he threw some of it out of his laboratory one day when the swine\r\nof the monastery, finding it, proceeded to gobble it up, together with\r\nsome other refuse. Just when they were finishing it, the monk discovered\r\nwhat they were doing. He feared the worst from it, but took the occasion\r\nto observe the effect upon the swine very carefully. He found that,\r\nafter a preliminary period of digestive disturbance, these swine\r\ndeveloped an enormous appetite, and became fatter than any of the\r\nothers. This seemed a rather desirable result, and Basil Valentine, ever\r\non the search for the practical, thought that he might use the remedy to\r\ngood purpose on the members of the community. Some of the monks in the\r\nmonastery were of rather frail health and delicate constitution, and\r\nmost of them were rather thin, and he thought that the putting on of a\r\nlittle fat, provided it could be accomplished without infringement of\r\nthe rule, might be a good thing for them. Accordingly, he administered,\r\nsurreptitiously, some of the salts of antimony, with which he was\r\nexperimenting, in the food served to these monks. The result, however,\r\nwas not so favorable as in the case of the hogs. Indeed, according to\r\none, though less authentic, version of the story, some of the poor\r\nmonks, the unconscious subjects of the experiment, perished as the\r\nresult of the ingestion of the antimonial compounds. According to the\r\nbetter version, they suffered only the usual unpleasant consequences of\r\ntaking antimony, which are, however, quite enough for a fitting climax\r\nto the story. Basil Valentine called the new substance which he had\r\ndiscovered antimony, that is, _opposed to monks_. It might be good for\r\nhogs, but it was a form of monks' bane, as it were.[30]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for most of the good stories of history, modern criticism\r\nhas nearly always failed to find any authentic basis for them, and they\r\nhave had to go the way of the legends of Washington's hatchet and Tell's\r\napple. We are sorry to say that that seems to be true also of this\r\nparticular story. Antimony, the word, is very probably derived from\r\ncertain dialectic forms of the Greek word for the metal, and the name is\r\nno more derived from _anti_ and _monachus_ than it is from _anti_ and\r\n_monos_ (opposed to single existence), another fictitious derivation\r\nthat has been suggested, and one whose etymological value is supposed to\r\nconsist in the fact that antimony is practically never found alone in\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the apparent cloud of unfounded traditions that are\r\nassociated with his name, there can be no doubt at all of the fact that\r\nValentinus--to give him the Latin name by which he is commonly\r\ndesignated in foreign literatures--was one of the great geniuses, who,\r\nworking in obscurity, make precious steps into the unknown that enable\r\nhumanity after them to see things more clearly than ever before. There\r\nare definite historical grounds for placing Basil Valentine as the first\r\nof the series of careful observers who differentiated chemistry from the\r\nold alchemy and applied its precious treasures of information to the\r\nuses of medicine. It is said to have been because of the study of Basil\r\nValentine's work that Paracelsus broke away from the Galenic traditions,\r\nso supreme in medicine up to his time, and began our modern\r\npharmaceutics. Following Paracelsus came Van Helmont, the father of\r\nmodern medical chemistry, and these three did more than any others to\r\nenlarge the scope of medication and to make observation rather than\r\nauthority the most important criterion of truth in medicine. Indeed, the\r\nwork of this trio of men of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries--the\r\nRenaissance in medicine as in art--dominated medical treatment, or at\r\nleast the department of pharmaceutics, down almost to our own day, and\r\ntheir influence is still felt in drug-giving.\r\n\r\nWhile we do not know the absolute data of either the birth or the death\r\nof Basil Valentine and are not sure of the exact period even in which he\r\nlived and did his work, we are sure that a great original observer about\r\nthe time of the invention of printing studied mercury and sulphur and\r\nvarious salts of the metals, and above all introduced antimony to the\r\nnotice of the scientific world, and especially to the favor of\r\npractitioners of medicine. His book, \"The Triumphal Chariot of\r\nAntimony,\" is full of conclusions not quite justified by his premises\r\nnor by his observations. There is no doubt, however, that the\r\nobservational method which he employed furnished an immense amount of\r\nknowledge, and formed the basis of the method of investigation by which\r\nthe chemical side of medicine was to develop during the next two or\r\nthree centuries. Great harm was done by the abuse of antimony, but then\r\ngreat harm is done by the abuse of anything, no matter how good it may\r\nbe. For a time it came to be the most important drug in medicine and was\r\nonly replaced by venesection.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is that doctors were looking for effects from\r\ntheir drugs, and antimony is, above all things, effective. Patients,\r\ntoo, wished to see the effect of the medicines they took. They do so\r\neven yet, and when antimony was administered there was no doubt about\r\nits working.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of Basil Valentine's books, and the one which has\r\nhad the most enduring influence, is undoubtedly \"The Triumphal Chariot\r\nof Antimony.\"[31] It has been translated and has had a wide vogue in\r\nevery language of modern Europe. Its recommendation of antimony had such\r\nan effect upon medical practice that it continued to be the most\r\nimportant drug in the pharmacopoeia down almost to the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century. If any proof were needed that Basil Valentine or\r\nthat the author of the books that go under the name was a monk it would\r\nbe found in the introduction to this volume, which not only states that\r\nfact very clearly, but also in doing so makes use of language that shows\r\nthe writer to have been deeply imbued with the old monastic spirit. I\r\nquote the first paragraph of this introduction because it emphasizes\r\nthis. The quotation is taken from the English translation of the work as\r\npublished in London in 1678. Curiously enough, seeing the obscurity\r\nsurrounding Valentine himself, we do not know for sure who made the\r\ntranslation. The translator apologizes somewhat for the deeply religious\r\nspirit of the book, but considers that he was not justified in\r\neliminating any of this. The paragraph is left in the quaint,\r\nold-fashioned form so eminently suited to the thoughts of the old\r\nmaster, and the spelling and use of capitals is not changed.\r\n\r\n     \"Basil Valentine: His Triumphant Chariot of Antimony.--Since\r\n     I, Basil Valentine, by Religious Vows am bound to live\r\n     according to the order of St. Benedict and that requires\r\n     another manner of Spirit of Holiness than the common state of\r\n     Mortals exercised in the profane business of this World; I\r\n     thought it my duty before all things, in the beginning of this\r\n     little book, to declare what is necessary to be known by the\r\n     pious Spagyrist [old-time name for medical chemist], inflamed\r\n     with an ardent desire of this Art, as what he ought to do, and\r\n     whereunto to direct his striving, that he may lay such\r\n     foundations of the whole matter as may be stable; lest his\r\n     Building, shaken with the Winds, happen to fall, and the whole\r\n     Edifice to be involved in shameful Ruine which otherwise being\r\n     founded on more firm and solid principles, might have\r\n     continued for a long series of time. Which Admonition I judged\r\n     was, is and always will be a necessary part of my religious\r\n     Office; especially since we must all die, and no one of us\r\n     which are now, whether high or low, shall long be seen among\r\n     the number of men. For it concerns me to recommend these\r\n     Meditations of Mortality to Posterity, leaving them behind me,\r\n     not only that honor may be given to the Divine Majesty, but\r\n     also that men may obey him sincerely in all things.\r\n\r\n     \"In this my meditation I found that there were five principal\r\n     heads, chiefly to be considered by the wise and prudent\r\n     spectators of our Wisdom and Art. The first of which is\r\n     Invocation of God. The second, Contemplation of Nature. The\r\n     third, True Preparation. The fourth, the Way of Using. The\r\n     fifth, Utility and Fruit. For he who regards not these, shall\r\n     never obtain place among true Chymists, or fill up the number\r\n     of perfect Spagyrists. Therefore, touching these five heads,\r\n     we shall here following treat and so far declare them, as that\r\n     the general Work may be brought to light and perfected by an\r\n     intent and studious Operator.\"\r\n\r\nThis book, though the title might seem to indicate it, is not devoted\r\nentirely to the study of antimony, but contains many important additions\r\nto the chemistry of the time. For instance, Basil Valentine explains in\r\nthis work how what he calls the spirit of salt might be obtained. He\r\nsucceeded in manufacturing this material by treating common salt with\r\noil of vitriol and heat. From the description of the uses to which he\r\nput the end product of his chemical manipulation, it is evident that\r\nunder the name of spirit of salt he is describing what we now know as\r\nhydrochloric acid. This is said to be the first definite mention of it\r\nin the history of science, and the method suggested for its preparation\r\nis not very different from that employed even at the present time. He\r\nalso suggests in his volume how alcohol may be obtained in high\r\nstrengths. He distilled the spirit obtained from wine over carbonate of\r\npotassium, and thus succeeded in depriving it of a great proportion of\r\nits water. We have said that he was deeply interested in the\r\nphilosopher's stone. Naturally this turned his attention to the study of\r\nmetals, and so it is not surprising to find that he succeeded in\r\nformulating a method by which metallic copper could be obtained. The\r\nmaterial used for the purpose was copper pyrites, which was changed to\r\nan impure sulphate of copper by the action of oil of vitriol and moist\r\nair. The sulphate of copper occurred in solution, and the copper could\r\nbe precipitated from it by plunging an iron bar into it. Basil Valentine\r\nrecognized the presence of this peculiar yellow metal, and studied some\r\nof its qualities. He does not seem to have been quite sure, however,\r\nwhether the phenomenon that he witnessed was not really a transmutation\r\nof at least some of the iron into copper as a consequence of the other\r\nchemicals present. There are some observations on chemical physiology,\r\nand especially with regard to respiration, in the book on antimony which\r\nshow their author to have anticipated the true explanation of the theory\r\nof respiration. He states that animals breathe because air is needed to\r\nsupport their life, and that all the animals exhibit the phenomenon of\r\nrespiration. He even insists that the fishes, though living in water,\r\nbreathe air, and he adduces in support of this idea the fact that\r\nwhenever a river is entirely frozen the fishes die. The reason for this\r\nbeing, according to this old-time physiological chemist, not that the\r\nfishes are frozen to death, but that they are not able to obtain air in\r\nthe ice as they did in the water, and consequently perish.\r\n\r\nThere are many testimonials to the practical character of all his\r\nknowledge and his desire to apply it for the benefit of humanity. The\r\nold monk could not repress the expression of his impatience with\r\nphysicians who gave to patients for \"diseases of which they knew little,\r\nremedies of which they knew less.\" For him it was an unpardonable sin\r\nfor a physician not to have faithfully studied the various mixtures\r\nthat he prescribed for his patients, and not to know not only their\r\nappearance and taste and effect, but also the limits of their\r\napplication. Considering that at the present time it is a frequent\r\nsource of complaint that physicians often prescribe remedies with even\r\nwhose physical appearance they are not familiar and whose composition is\r\noften quite unknown to them, this complaint of the old-time chemist\r\nalchemist will be all the more interesting for the modern physician. It\r\nis evident that when Basil Valentine allows his ire to get the better of\r\nhim it is because of his indignation over the quacks who were abusing\r\nmedicine and patients in his time, as they have ever since. There is a\r\ncurious bit of aspersion on mere book learning in the passage that has a\r\ndistinctly modern ring, and one feels the truth of Russell Lowell's\r\nexpression that to read a classic, no matter how antique, is like\r\nreading a commentary on the morning paper, so up-to-date does genius\r\never remain:\r\n\r\n     \"And whensoever I shall have occasion to contend in the School\r\n     with such a Doctor, who knows not how himself to prepare his\r\n     own medicines, but commits that business to another, I am sure\r\n     I shall obtain the Palm from him; For indeed that good man\r\n     knows not what medicines he prescribes to the sick; whether\r\n     the color of them be white, black, gray, or blew (_sic_), he\r\n     cannot tell; nor doth this wretched man know whether the\r\n     medicine he gives be dry or hot, cold or humid; but he only\r\n     knows that he found it so written in his books, and then\r\n     pretends to knowledge or as it were Possession by Prescription\r\n     of a very long time; yet he desires to further information.\r\n     Here again let it be lawful to exclaim, Good God, to what a\r\n     state is the matter brought! what Goodness of Minde is in\r\n     these men! what care do they take of the sick! Wo, wo to them!\r\n     in the day of Judgement they will find the fruit of their\r\n     Ignorance and Rashness, then they will see him whom they\r\n     pierced, when they neglected their Neighbor, sought after\r\n     money and nothing else; whereas were they cordial in their\r\n     profession, they would spend Nights and Days in Labour that\r\n     they might become more learned in their Art, whence more\r\n     certain health would accrew to the sick with their estimation\r\n     and greater glory to themselves. But since Labour is tedious\r\n     to them they commit the matter to chance, and being secure of\r\n     their Honour, and content with their Fame, they (like\r\n     Brawlers) defend themselves with a certain garrulity, without\r\n     any respect had to Confidence or Truth.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the reasons why Valentine's book has been of such\r\nenduring interest is that it is written in an eminently human vein and\r\nout of a lively imagination. It is full of figures relating to many\r\nother things besides chemistry, which serve to show how deeply this\r\ninvestigating observer was attentive to all the problems of life around\r\nhim. For instance, when he wants to describe the affinity that exists\r\nbetween many substances in chemistry, and which makes it impossible for\r\nthem not to be attracted to one another, he takes a figure from the\r\nattractions that he sees exist among men and women. It is curious to\r\nfind affinities discussed in our modern sense so long ago. There are\r\nsome paragraphs with regard to the influence of the passion of love that\r\none might think rather a quotation from an old-time sermon than from a\r\ngreat ground-breaking book in the science of chemistry.\r\n\r\n     \"Love leaves nothing entire or sound in man; it impedes his\r\n     sleep, he cannot rest either day or night; it takes off his\r\n     appetite that he hath no disposition either to meat or drink\r\n     by reason of the continual torments of his heart and mind. It\r\n     deprives him of all Providence, hence he neglects his affairs,\r\n     vocation, and business. He minds neither study, labor, nor\r\n     prayer; casts away all thoughts of anything but the body\r\n     beloved; this is his study, this his most vain occupation. If\r\n     to lovers the success be not answerable to their wish, or so\r\n     soon and prosperously as they desire, how many melancholies\r\n     henceforth arise, with griefs and sadness, with which they\r\n     pine away and wax so lean as they have scarcely any flesh\r\n     cleaving to the bones. Yea, at last they lose the life itself,\r\n     as may be proved by many examples! for such men (which is an\r\n     horrible thing to think of) slight and neglect all perils and\r\n     detriments, both of the body and life, and of the soul and\r\n     eternal salvation.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that human nature is not different in our sophisticated\r\ntwentieth century from that which this observant old monk saw around him\r\nin the fifteenth. He continues:\r\n\r\n     \"How many testimonies of this violence which is in love, are\r\n     daily found? for it not only inflames the younger sort, but it\r\n     so far exaggerates some persons far gone in years as through\r\n     the burning heat thereof, they are almost mad. Natural\r\n     diseases are for the most part governed by the complexion of\r\n     man and therefore invade some more fiercely, others more\r\n     gently; but Love, without distinction of poor or rich, young\r\n     or old, seizeth all, and having seized so blinds them as\r\n     forgetting all rules of reason, they neither see nor hear any\r\n     snare.\"\r\n\r\nBut then the old monk thinks that he has said enough about this rather\r\nforeign subject, and apologizes for his digression in another paragraph\r\nthat should remove any lingering doubt there might be with regard to the\r\ngenuineness of his monastic character. At the end of the passage he\r\nmakes the application in a very few words. The personal element in his\r\nconfession is so naive and so simply straightforward that instead of\r\nseeming to be the result of conceit, which would surely have repelled\r\nthe reader, it rather attracts and enhances his kindly feeling for its\r\nauthor. The paragraph would remind one in certain ways of that personal\r\nelement that was to become more popular in literature after Montaigne in\r\nthe next century made it rather the fashion.\r\n\r\n     \"But of these enough; for it becomes not a religious man to\r\n     insist too long upon these cogitations, or to give place to\r\n     such a flame in his heart. Hitherto (without boasting I speak\r\n     it) I have throughout the whole course of my life kept myself\r\n     safe and free from it, and I pray and invoke God to vouchsafe\r\n     me his Grace that I may keep holy and inviolate the faith\r\n     which I have sworn, and live contented with my spiritual\r\n     spouse, the Holy Catholick Church. For no other reason have I\r\n     alleged these than that I might express the love with which\r\n     all tinctures ought to be moved towards metals, if ever they\r\n     be admitted by them into true friendship, and by love, which\r\n     permeates the inmost parts, be converted into a better state.\"\r\n\r\nThe application of the figure at the end of his long digression is\r\ncharacteristic of the period in which he wrote, as also to a\r\nconsiderable extent of the German literary methods of the time.\r\n\r\nIn this volume on the use of antimony there are in most of the editions\r\ncertain biographical notes which have sometimes been accepted as\r\nauthentic, but oftener rejected. According to these, Basil Valentine was\r\nborn in a town in Alsace, on the southern bank of the Rhine. As a\r\nconsequence of this, there are several towns that have laid claim to\r\nbeing his birthplace. M. Jean Reynaud, the distinguished French\r\nphilosophical writer of the first half of the nineteenth century, once\r\nsaid that Basil Valentine, like Ossian and Homer, had many towns claim\r\nhim years after his death. He also suggested that, like those old poets,\r\nit was possible that the writings sometimes attributed to Basil\r\nValentine were really the work not of one man, but of several\r\nindividuals. There are, however, many objections to this theory, the\r\nmost forcible of which is the internal evidence derived from the books\r\nthemselves showing similarities of style and method of treating subjects\r\ntoo great for us to admit non-identity in the writers. M. Reynaud lived\r\nat a time when it was all the fashion to suggest that old works that had\r\ncome down to us, like the Iliad and the Odyssey, and even such national\r\nepics as the Cid and the Arthur Legends and the Nibelungenlied were to\r\nbe attributed to several writers rather than to one. We have passed that\r\nperiod of criticism, however, and have reverted to the idea of single\r\nauthorship for these works, and the same conclusion has been generally\r\ncome to with regard to the writings attributed to Basil Valentine.\r\n\r\nOther biographic details contained in \"The Triumphal Chariot of\r\nAntimony\" are undoubtedly more correct. According to them Basil\r\nValentine travelled in England and Holland on missions for his order,\r\nand went through France and Spain on a pilgrimage to St. James of\r\nCompostella.\r\n\r\nBesides this work, there is a number of other books of Basil\r\nValentine's, printed during the first half of the sixteenth century,\r\nthat are well known and copies of which may be found in most of the\r\nimportant libraries. The United States Surgeon General's Library at\r\nWashington contains not a few of the works on medical subjects, and the\r\nNew York Academy of Medicine Library has some valuable editions of\r\ncertain of his works. Some of his other well-known books, each of which\r\nis a good-sized octavo volume, bear the following descriptive titles (I\r\ngive them in English, though as they are usually found, they are in\r\nLatin, sixteenth-century translations of the original German): \"The\r\nWorld in Miniature: or, The Mystery of the World and of Human Medical\r\nScience,\" published at Mayburg, 1609; \"The Chemical Apocalypse: or, The\r\nManifestation of Artificial Chemical Compounds,\" published in Erfurt in\r\n1624; \"A Chemico-Philosophic Treatise Concerning Things Natural and\r\nPreternatural, Especially Relating to the Metals and the Minerals,\"\r\npublished at Frankfurt in 1676; \"Haliography: or, The Science of Salts:\r\nA Treatise on the Preparation, Use, and Chemical Properties of All the\r\nMineral, Animal, and Vegetable Salts,\" published at Bologna in 1644;\r\n\"The Twelve Keys of Philosophy,\" Leipsic, 1630. These are of interest to\r\nthe chemist and physicist rather than to the physician, and it is as a\r\nMaker of Medicine that we are concerned with Valentine here.\r\n\r\nThe great attention aroused in Basil Valentine's work at the\r\nRenaissance period can be best realized from the number of manuscript\r\ncopies and their wide distribution. His books were not all printed at\r\none place, but, on the contrary, in different portions of Europe. The\r\noriginal edition of \"The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony\" was published in\r\nLeipsic in the early part of the sixteenth century. The first editions\r\nof the other books, however, appeared at places so distant from Leipsic\r\nas Amsterdam and Bologna, while various cities of Germany, as Erfurt and\r\nFrankfurt, claim the original editions of still other works. Many of the\r\nmanuscript copies still exist in various libraries in Europe; and while\r\nthere is no doubt that some unimportant additions to the supposed works\r\nof Basil Valentine have come from the attribution to him of scientific\r\ntreatises of other German writers, the style and the method of the\r\nprincipal works mentioned is entirely too similar not to have been the\r\nfruit of a single mind and that possessed of a distinct investigating\r\ngenius, setting it far above any of its contemporaries in scientific\r\nspeculation and observation.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature of all of Basil Valentine's writings that\r\nare extant is the distinctive tendency to make his observations of\r\nspecial practical utility. His studies in antimony were made mainly with\r\nthe idea of showing how that substance might be used in medicine. He did\r\nnot neglect to point out other possible uses, however, and knew the\r\nsecret of the employment of antimony in order to give sharpness and\r\ndefinition to the impression produced by metal types. It would seem as\r\nthough he was the first scientist who discussed this subject, and there\r\nis even some question of whether printers and typefounders did not\r\nderive their ideas in this matter from our chemist.\r\n\r\nInterested though he was in the transmutation of metals, he never failed\r\nto try to find and suggest some medicinal use for all of the substances\r\nthat he investigated. His was no greedy search for gold and no\r\ncumulation of investigations with the idea of benefiting only himself.\r\nMankind was always in his mind, and perhaps there is no better\r\ndemonstration of his fulfilment of the character of the monk than this\r\nconstant solicitude to benefit others by every bit of investigation that\r\nhe carried out. For him, with medieval nobleness of spirit, \"the first\r\npart of every work must be the invocation of God, and the last, though\r\nno less important than the first, must be the utility and fruit for\r\nmankind that can be derived from it.\"\r\n\r\nThe career of the last of the Makers of Medicine in the Middle Ages may\r\nbe summed up briefly in a few sentences that show how thoroughly this\r\nold Benedictine was possessed of the spirit of modern science. He\r\nbelieved in observation as the most important source of medical\r\nknowledge. He valued clinical experience far above book information. He\r\ninsisted on personal acquaintanceship on the part of the physician with\r\nthe drugs he used, and thought nothing more unworthy of a practitioner\r\nof medicine,--indeed he sets it down as almost criminal--than to give\r\nremedies of whose composition he was not well aware and whose effect he\r\ndid not thoroughly understand. He thought that nature was the most\r\nimportant aid to the physician, much more important than drugs, though\r\nhe was the first to realize the significance of chemical affinities, and\r\nhe seems to have understood rather well how individual often were the\r\neffects obtained from drugs. He was a patient student, a faithful\r\nobserver, a writer who did not begrudge time and care to the composition\r\nof large books on medicine, yet withal he was no dry-as-dust scholar,\r\nbut eminently human in his sympathies with ailing humanity, and a\r\nstrenuous upholder of the dignity of the profession to which he\r\nbelonged. Scarcely more can be said of anyone in the history of\r\nmedicine, at least so far as good intentions go; though many\r\naccomplished more, none deserve more honor than the Thuringian monk whom\r\nwe know as Basil Valentine.\r\n\r\nThere are many other of these old-time Makers of Medicine of whom nearly\r\nthe same thing can be said. Basil Valentine is only one of a number of\r\nmen who worked faithfully and did much both for medical science and\r\nprofessional life during the thousand years from the fall of Rome to the\r\nfall of Constantinople, when, according to what used to be commonly\r\naccepted opinion, men were not animated by the spirit of research and of\r\nfine incentive to do good to men that we are so likely to think of as\r\nbelonging exclusively to more modern times. A man whom he greatly\r\ninfluenced, Paracelsus, took up the tradition of scientific\r\ninvestigation where Basil Valentine had left it. His work, though more\r\nsuccessfully revolutionary, was not done in such a fine spirit of\r\nsympathy with humanity nor with that simplicity of life and purity of\r\nintention that characterized the old monk's work. Paracelsus' birth in\r\nthe year of the discovery of America places him among the makers of the\r\nfoundations of our modern medicine, and he will be treated of in a\r\nvolume on \"The Forefathers in Medicine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nST. LUKE THE PHYSICIAN[32]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the midst of what has been called the \"higher criticism\" of the Bible\r\nin recent times, one of the long accepted traditions that has been most\r\nstrenuously assailed and, indeed, in the minds of many scholars, seemed,\r\nfor a time at least, quite discredited, was that St. Luke the\r\nEvangelist, the author of the Third Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles,\r\nwas a physician. Distinguished authorities in early Christian\r\napologetics have declared that the pillars of primitive Christian\r\nhistory are the genuine Epistles of St. Paul, the writings of St. Luke,\r\nand the history of Eusebius. It is quite easy to understand, then, that\r\nthe attack upon the authenticity of the writings usually assigned to St.\r\nLuke, which in many minds seemed successful, has been considered of\r\ngreat importance. In the very recent time there has been a decided\r\nreaction in this matter. This has come, not so much from Roman\r\nCatholics, who have always clung to the traditional view, and whose\r\ngreat Biblical students have been foremost in the support of the\r\npreviously accepted opinion, but from some of the most strenuous of the\r\nGerman higher critics, who now appreciate that destructive, so-called\r\nhigher criticism went too far, and that the traditional view not only\r\ncan be maintained, but is the only opinion that will adequately respond\r\nto all the new facts that have been found, and all the recently gathered\r\ninformation with regard to the relations of events in the olden time.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important contribution to the discussion in recent\r\nyears came not long since from the pen of Professor Adolph Harnack, the\r\nprofessor of church history in the University of Berlin. Professor\r\nHarnack's name is usually cited as that of one of the most destructive\r\nof the higher critics. His recent book, however, \"Luke the\r\nPhysician,\"[33] is an entire submission to the old-fashioned viewpoint\r\nthat the writer of the Third Gospel and of the Acts of the Apostles was\r\na Greek fellow-worker of St. Paul, who had been in company for years\r\nwith Mark and Philip and James, and who had previously been a physician,\r\nand was evidently well versed in all the medical lore of that time.\r\nHarnack does not merely concede the old position. As might be expected,\r\nhis rediscussion of the subject clinches the arguments for the\r\ntraditional view, and makes it impossible ever to call it in question\r\nagain. It is easy to understand how important are such admissions when\r\nwe recall how much this traditional view has been assailed, and how\r\nthose who have held it have been accused of old-fogyism and lack of\r\nscholarship, and unwarranted clinging to antiquated notions just because\r\nthey thought they were of faith, and how, lacking in true scholarship,\r\nseriously hampering genuine investigation, such conservatism has been\r\ndeclared to be.\r\n\r\nThe question of Luke's having been a physician is an extremely valuable\r\none, and no one in our time is better fitted by early training and long\r\nyears of study to elucidate it than Professor Harnack. He began his\r\nexcursions into historical writing years ago, as I understand, as an\r\nhistorian of early Christian medicine. Some of his works on medical\r\nconditions just before and after Christ are quoted confidently by the\r\ndistinguished German medical historians. From this department he\r\ngraduated into the field of the higher criticism. He is eminently in a\r\nposition, therefore, to state the case with regard to St. Luke fully,\r\nand to indicate absolutely the conclusions that should be drawn from the\r\npremises of fact, writings, and traditions that we have. He does so in a\r\nvery striking way. Perhaps no better example of his thoroughly lucid and\r\neminently logical mode of argumentation is to be found than the\r\nparagraph in which he states the question. It might well be recommended\r\nas an example of terse forcefulness and logical sequence that deserves\r\nthe emulation of all those who want to write on medical subjects. If we\r\nhad more of these characteristic qualities of Harnack's style, our\r\nmedical literature, so called, would not need to occupy so many pages of\r\nprint as it does--yet would say more. Here it is:\r\n\r\n     St. Luke, according to St. Paul, was a physician. When a\r\n     physician writes a historical work it does not necessarily\r\n     follow that his profession shows itself in his writing; yet it\r\n     is only natural for one to look for traces of the author's\r\n     medical profession in such a work. These traces may be of\r\n     different kinds: 1, The whole character of the narrative may\r\n     be determined by points of view, aims, and ideals which are\r\n     more or less medical (disease and its treatment); 2, marked\r\n     preference may be shown for stories concerning the healing of\r\n     diseases, which stories may be given in great number and\r\n     detail; 3, the language may be colored by the language of\r\n     physicians (medical technical terms, metaphors of medical\r\n     character, etc.). All these three groups of characteristic\r\n     signs are found, as we shall see, in the historical work which\r\n     bears the name of St. Luke. Here, however, it may be objected\r\n     that the subject matter itself is responsible for these\r\n     traits, so that their evidence is not decisive for the medical\r\n     calling of the author. Jesus appeared as a great physician and\r\n     healer. All the evangelists say this of Him; hence it is not\r\n     surprising that one of them has set this phase of His ministry\r\n     in the foreground, and has regarded it as the most important.\r\n     Our evangelist need not therefore have been a physician,\r\n     especially if he were a Greek, seeing that in those days\r\n     Greeks with religious interests were disposed to regard\r\n     religion mainly under the category of healing and salvation.\r\n     This is true, yet such a combination of characteristic signs\r\n     will compel us to believe that the author was a physician if,\r\n     4, the description of the particular cases of disease shows\r\n     distinct traces of medical diagnosis and scientific knowledge;\r\n     5, if the language, even where questions of medicine or of\r\n     healing are not touched upon, is colored by medical\r\n     phraseology; and, 6, if in those passages where the author\r\n     speaks as an eye-witness medical traits are especially and\r\n     prominently apparent. These three kinds of tokens are also\r\n     found in the historical work of our author. It is accordingly\r\n     proved that it proceeds from the pen of a physician.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the concession that Luke was a physician should be\r\nproperly appreciated. His whole gospel is written from that standpoint.\r\nFor him the Saviour was the healer, the good physician who went about\r\ncuring the ills of the body, while ministering to people's souls. He has\r\nmore accounts of miracles of healing than any of the other Evangelists.\r\nHe has taken certain of the stories of the other Evangelists who were\r\neye-witnesses, and when they were told in naive and popular language\r\nthat obscured the real condition that was present, he has retold the\r\nstory from the physician's standpoint, and thus the miracle becomes\r\nclearer than ever. In one case, where Mark has a slur on physicians,\r\nLuke eliminates it. In a number of cases the correction of Mark's\r\npopular language in the description of ailments is made in terms that\r\ncould not have been used except by one thoroughly versed in the Greek\r\nmedical terminology of the times. As a matter of fact, there seems to be\r\nno doubt now that Luke had been, before he became an Evangelist, a\r\npractising physician in Malta of considerable experience. His testimony,\r\nthen, to the miracles is particularly valuable as almost a medical\r\neye-witness.\r\n\r\nIn medical science, St. Luke's time was by no means barren of knowledge.\r\nThe Alexandrian school of medicine had done some fine work in its time.\r\nIt was the first university medical school in the world's history, and\r\nthere dissection was first practised regularly and publicly for the sake\r\nof anatomy, and even the vivisection of criminals who were supplied by\r\nthe Ptolemei for human physiology, was a part of the school curriculum.\r\nA number of important discoveries in brain anatomy are attributed to\r\nHerophilus, after whom the torcular herophili within the skull is named,\r\nand who invented the term calamus scriptorius for certain appearances\r\nin the fourth ventricle. His colleague, Erasistratus, the co-founder of\r\nthis school at Alexandria, did work in pathological anatomy, and laid\r\nthe foundation for serious study there. For three centuries there is\r\nsome good worker, at or in connection with Alexandria, whose name is\r\npreserved for us in the history of medicine. Other Greek schools of\r\nmedicine in the East, as, for instance, that of Pergamos, also did\r\nexcellent work. Galen is the great representative of this school, and he\r\ncame in the century after St. Luke. A physician educated in Greek\r\nmedicine at that time, then, would be in an excellent position to judge\r\ncritically of the miracles of healing of the Christ, and it would seem\r\nto have been providential that Luke was called for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe evidence for his membership of our profession will doubtless be\r\ninteresting to all physicians. Some of the distinctive passages in which\r\nLuke's familiarity with medical terms to such an extent that to express\r\nhis meaning he found himself compelled to use them, will appeal at once\r\nto these, for whom such terms are part of everyday speech. The use of\r\nthe word _hydropikos_, which is not to be met with anywhere else in the\r\nNew Testament, nor in the non-medical Greek literature of that time,\r\nthough the word is of frequent occurrence as a designation for a person\r\nsuffering from dropsy (and always, as in Luke, the adjective for the\r\nsubstantive), in Hippocrates, Dioscorides, and Galen is a typical\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nWhere such vague terms as paralyzed occur Luke does not use the familiar\r\nword, but the medical term that meant stricken with paralysis,\r\nindicating not any inability to use the limbs, but such a one as was due\r\nto a stroke of apoplexy. We who, as physicians, have heard of so many\r\ncures of paralysis from our friends, the Eddyites, are prone to ask, as\r\nthe first question, what sort of a paralysis it was. Luke made inquiries\r\nfrom men who were eye-witnesses, and then has described the scene with\r\nsuch details as convinced him as a physician of the reality of the\r\nmiracle, and his description was meant to carry conviction to the minds\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nOccasionally St. Luke uses words which only a physician would be likely\r\nto know at all. That is to say, even a man reasonably familiar with\r\nmedical terminology and medical literature would not be likely to know\r\nthem unless he had been technically trained. One of these is the word\r\n_sphudron_, a word which is only medical, and is not to be found even in\r\nsuch large Greek lexicons of ordinary words as that of Passow. Sphudron\r\nis the anatomical term of the Graeco-Alexandrian school for the condyles\r\nof the femur. Galen and other medical authors use it, and Luke, in\r\ngiving the details of the story of the lame man cured, in the third\r\nchapter of the Acts, seventh verse, selects it because it exactly\r\nexpresses the meaning he wished to convey. In this story there are a\r\nnumber of added medical details. These are all evidently arranged so as\r\nto give the full medical significance to the miracle. For instance, the\r\nman had been _lame from birth_, literally _from the womb of his mother_.\r\nAt this time he was forty years of age, an age at which the spontaneous\r\ncure of such an ailment or, indeed, any cure of it, could scarcely be\r\nexpected, if, during the preceding time, there had been no improvement.\r\n\r\nIn the story of the cure of Saul's blindness Luke says in the Acts that\r\nhis blindness fell from him like scales. The figure is a typically\r\nmedical one. The word for fall that is used is, as was pointed out by\r\nHobart (\"Medical Language of St. Luke,\" Dublin, 1882), exactly the term\r\nthat is used for the falling of scales from the body. The term for\r\nscales is the specific designation of the particles that fall from the\r\nbody during certain skin diseases or after certain of the infectious\r\nfevers, as in scarlet fever. Hippocrates and Galen have used it in many\r\nplaces. It is distinctively a medical word. In the story of the vision\r\nof St. Peter, told also in the Acts, the word _ecstasis_, from which we\r\nderive our word ecstasy, is used. This is the only word St. Luke uses\r\nfor vision and he alone uses it. This term is of constant employment in\r\na technical sense in the medical writers of St. Luke's time and before\r\nit. When the other evangelists talk of lame people they use the popular\r\nterm. This might mean anything or nothing for a physician. Luke uses one\r\nof the terms that is employed by physicians when they wish to indicate\r\nthat for some definite reason there is inability to walk.\r\n\r\nIn the story of the Good Samaritan there are some interesting details\r\nthat indicate medical interest on the part of the writer. It is Luke's\r\ncharacteristic story and a typical medical instance. He employs certain\r\nwords in it that are used only by medical writers. The use of oil and\r\nwine in the treatment of the wounds of the stranger traveller was at one\r\ntime said to indicate that it could not have been a physician who wrote\r\nthe story, since the ancients used oil for external applications in such\r\ncases but not wine. More careful search of the old masters of medicine,\r\nhowever, has shown that they used oil and wine not only internally but\r\nexternally. Hippocrates, for instance, has a number of recommendations\r\nof this combination for wounds. It is rather interesting to realize\r\nthis, and especially the wine in addition to the oil, because wine\r\ncontains enough alcohol to be rather satisfactorily antiseptic. There\r\nseems no doubt that wounds that had been bathed in wine and then had oil\r\npoured over them would be likely to do better than those which were\r\ntreated in other ways. The wine would cleanse and at least inhibit\r\nbacterial growth. The subsequent covering with oil would serve to\r\nprotect the wound to some degree from external contamination.\r\n\r\nSometimes there is an application of medical terms to something\r\nextraneous from medicine that makes the phrase employed quite amusing.\r\nFor instance, when Luke wants to explain how they strengthened the\r\nvessel in which they were to sail he describes the process by the term\r\nwhich was used in medical Greek to mean the splinting of a part or at\r\nleast the binding of it up in such a way as to enable it to be used. The\r\nword was quite a puzzle to the commentators until it was pointed out\r\nthat it was the familiar medical term, and then it was easy to\r\nunderstand. Occasionally this use of a medical term gives a strikingly\r\naccurate significance to Luke's diction. For instance, where other\r\nevangelists talk of the Lord looking at a patient or turning to them,\r\nLuke uses the expression that was technically employed for a physician's\r\nexamination of his patient, as if the Lord carefully looked over the\r\nailing people to see their physical needs, and then proceeded to cure\r\nthem. Manifestly in Luke's mind the most interesting phase of the Lord's\r\nlife was His exhibition of curative powers, and the Saviour was for him\r\nthe divine healer, the God physician of bodies as well as of souls.\r\n\r\nThere are many little incidents which he relates that emphasize this.\r\nFor instance, where St. Mark talks about the healing of the man with a\r\nwithered hand, St. Luke adds the characteristic medical note that it was\r\nthe right hand. When he tells of the cutting off of the ear of the\r\nservant of the high priest in the Garden of Olives St. Luke takes the\r\nstory from St. Mark, but adds the information that would appeal to a\r\nphysician that it was the right ear. Moreover, though all four\r\nevangelists record the cutting off of the ear, only St. Luke adds the\r\ninformation that the Lord healed it again. It is as if he were defending\r\nthe kindly feelings of the Divine Physician and as if it would have been\r\ninexcusable had He not exerted His miraculous powers of healing on this\r\noccasion. It is St. Luke, too, who has constantly distinguished between\r\nnatural illnesses and cases of possession. This careful distinction\r\nalone would point to the author of the third gospel and the Acts as\r\nsurely a physician. As it is it confirms beyond all doubt the claim that\r\nthe writer of these portions of the New Testament was a physician\r\nthoroughly familiar with all the medical writings of the time and\r\nprobably a physician who had practised for a long time.\r\n\r\nCertain miracles of healing are related only by St. Luke as if he\r\nrealized better than any of the other evangelists the evidential value\r\nthat such instances would have for future generations as to the divinity\r\nof the personage who worked them. The beautiful story of the raising\r\nfrom death of the son of the widow of Nain is probably one of the\r\noftenest quoted passages from St. Luke. It is a charming bit of\r\nliterature. While it suggests the writer physician it makes one almost\r\nsure that the other tradition according to which St. Luke was also a\r\npainter must be true. The scene is as picturesque as it can be. The Lord\r\nand His Apostles and the multitudes coming to the gate of the little\r\ncity just as in the evening sun the funeral cortege with the widow\r\nburying her only son came out of it. The approach of the Lord to the\r\nweeping mother, His command to the dead son to arise, and the simple\r\nwords, \"and he gave him back to his mother,\" constitute as charming a\r\nscene as a painter ever tried to visualize. Besides this, Luke alone has\r\nthe story of the man suffering with dropsy and the woman suffering from\r\nweakness. The intensely picturesque quality of many of these scenes that\r\nhe describes so vividly would indeed seem to place beyond all doubt the\r\nold tradition that he was an artist as well as a physician.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to realize that it is to Luke alone that we owe the\r\naccount of the well-known message sent by Christ Himself to John the\r\nBaptist when John sent his disciples to inquire as to His mission. After\r\ndescribing His ministry He said: \"Go and relate to John what you have\r\nheard and seen: the blind see, the lame walk, the deaf hear, the lepers\r\nare made clean, the dead rise again, to the poor the Gospel is\r\npreached.\" To no one more than to a physician would that description of\r\nHis mission appeal as surely divine.\r\n\r\nTo those who care to follow the subject still further, and above all, to\r\nread opinions given before the reversal of the verdict of the higher\r\ncriticism on the Lucan writings, indeed before ever that trial was\r\nbrought, there is much in \"Horae Lucanae--A Biography of St. Luke,\" by\r\nHenry Samuel Baynes (Longmans, 1870), that will surely be of interest.\r\nHe has some interesting quotations which show how thoroughly previous\r\ncenturies realized all the force of modern arguments. For instance, the\r\nfollowing paragraph from Dr. Nathaniel Robinson, a Scotch physician of\r\nthe eighteenth century, will illustrate this. Dr. Robinson said:\r\n\r\n     It is manifest from his Gospel, that Luke was both an acute\r\n     observer, and had even given professional attention to all our\r\n     Saviour's miracles of healing. Originally, among the\r\n     Egyptians, divinity and physic were united in the same order\r\n     of men, so that the priest had the care of souls, and was also\r\n     the physician. It was much the same under the Jewish economy.\r\n     But after physic came to be studied by the Greeks, they\r\n     separated the two professions. That a physician should write\r\n     the history of our Saviour's life was appropriate, as there\r\n     were divers mysterious things to be noticed, concerning which\r\n     his education enabled him to form a becoming judgment.\r\n\r\nIt is even interesting to realize that St. Luke's tendency to use\r\nmedical terms has been of definite value in determining the question\r\nwhether both the third gospel and the Acts of the Apostles are by the\r\nsame man. They have been attributed to St. Luke traditionally, but in\r\nthe higher criticism some doubt has been thrown on this and an elaborate\r\nhypothesis of dual authorship set up. It has been asserted that it is\r\nvery improbable on extrinsic grounds that they were both written by one\r\nhand and certain intrinsic evidence, changes in the mode of narration,\r\nespecially the use of the first personal pronoun in the plural in\r\ncertain passages, has been pointed to as making against single\r\nauthorship. This tendency to deny old-time traditions of authorship with\r\nregard to many classical writings was a marked characteristic of the\r\nearly part of the nineteenth century, but the close of the century saw\r\npractically all of these denials discredited. The nineteenth century\r\nushered in studies of Homer, with the separatist school perfectly\r\nconfident in their assertion that the Iliad and the Odyssey were not by\r\nthe same person, and even that the Iliad itself was the work of several\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century we are quite as sure that both\r\nthe Iliad and Odyssey were written by the same person and that the\r\nseparatists were hurried into a contrary decision not a little by the\r\nfeeling of the sensation that such a contradiction of previously\r\naccepted ideas would create. This is a determining factor in many a\r\nsupposed novel discovery, that it is hard always to discount\r\nsufficiently. A thing may be right even though it is old, and most new\r\ndiscoveries, it must not be forgotten, that is, most of those announced\r\nwith a great blare of trumpets, do not maintain themselves. The simple\r\nargument that the separatists would have to find another poet equal to\r\nHomer to write the other poem has done more than anything else to bring\r\ntheir opinion into disrepute. It is much easier to explain certain\r\ndiscrepancies, differences of style, and of treatment of subjects, as\r\nwell as other minor variants, than to supply another great poet. Most of\r\nthe works of our older literatures have gone through a similar trial\r\nduring the over-hasty superficially critical nineteenth century. The\r\nNibelungenlied has been attributed to two or three writers instead of\r\none. The Cid, the national epic of Spain, and the Arthur Legends, the\r\nfirst British epic, have been at least supposed to be amenable to the\r\nsame sort of criticism. In every case, scholars have gone back to the\r\nolder traditional view of a single author. The phases of literary and\r\nhistoric criticism with regard to Luke's writings are, then, only a\r\nrepetition of what all our great national classics have gone through\r\nfrom supercilious scholarship during the past hundred years.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, then, that there should be dual or even triple\r\nascriptions of authorship for various portions of the Scriptures, and\r\nLuke's writings have on this score suffered as much or more even than\r\nothers, with the possible exception of Moses. It is now definitely\r\nsettled, however, that the similarities of style between the Acts and\r\nthe third gospel are too great for them to have come from two different\r\nminds. This is especially true, as pointed out by Harnack, in all that\r\nregards the use of medical terms. The writer of the Acts and the writer\r\nof the third gospel knew Greek from the standpoint of the physician of\r\nthat time. Each used terms that we find nowhere else in Greek literature\r\nexcept among medical writers. What is thus true for one critical attack\r\non Luke's reputation is also true in another phase of recent higher\r\ncriticism. It has been said that certain portions of the Acts which are\r\ncalled the \"we\" portions because the narration changes in them from the\r\nthird to the first person were to be attributed to another writer than\r\nthe one who wrote the narrative portions. Here, once more, the test of\r\nthe medical words employed has decided the case for Luke's sole\r\nauthorship. It is evidently an excellent thing to be able to use medical\r\nterms properly if one wants to be recognized with certainty later on in\r\nhistory for just what one's business was. It has certainly saved the\r\nsituation for St. Luke, though there may be some doubt as to the real\r\nforce of objections thus easily overthrown.\r\n\r\nIt is rather interesting to realize that many scholars of the present\r\ngeneration had allowed themselves to be led away by the German higher\r\ncriticism from the old tradition with regard to Luke as a physician and\r\nnow will doubtless be led back to former views by the leader of German\r\nbiblical critics. It shows how much more distant things may influence\r\ncertain people than those nearer home--how the hills are green far away.\r\nHarnack confesses that the best book ever written on the subject of Luke\r\nas a physician, the one that has proved of most value to him, and that\r\nhe still recommends everyone to read, was originally written in English.\r\nIt is Hobart's \"Medical Language of St. Luke,\"[34] written more than a\r\nquarter of a century before Harnack. The Germans generally had rather\r\ndespised what the English were doing in the matter of biblical\r\ncriticism, and above all in philology. Yet now the acknowledged\r\ncoryphaeus of them all, Harnack, not only admits the superiority of an\r\nold-time English book, but confesses that it is the best statement of\r\nthe subject up to the present time, including his own. He constantly\r\nquotes from it, and it is evident that it has been the foundation of all\r\nof his arguments. It is not the first time that men have fetched from\r\nafar what they might have got just as well or better at home.\r\n\r\nHarnack has made complete the demonstration, then, that the third\r\ngospel and the Acts were written by St. Luke, who had been a practising\r\nphysician. In spite of this, however, he finds many objections to the\r\nLuke narratives and considers that they add very little that is valuable\r\nto the contemporary evidence that we have with regard to Christ. He\r\nimpairs with one hand the value of what he has so lavishly yielded with\r\nthe other. He finds inconsistencies and discrepancies in the narrative\r\nthat for him destroy their value as testimony. A lawyer would probably\r\nsay that this is that very human element in the writings which\r\ndemonstrates their authenticity and adds to their value as evidence,\r\nbecause it shows clearly the lack of any attempt to do anything more\r\nthan tell a direct story as it had come to the narrator. No special\r\neffort was made to avoid critical objections founded on details. It was\r\nthe general impression that was looked for.\r\n\r\nSir William Ramsay, in his \"Luke the Physician and Other Studies in the\r\nHistory of Religion\" (New York: Armstrong and Sons, 1908), has answered\r\nHarnack from the side of the professional critic with much force. He\r\nappreciates thoroughly the value of Professor Harnack's book, and above\r\nall the reactionary tendency away from nihilistic so-called higher\r\ncriticism which characterized so much of German writing on biblical\r\nthemes in the nineteenth century. He says (p. 7): \"This [book of\r\nHarnack's] alone carries Lukan criticism a long step forwards, and sets\r\nit on a new and higher plane. Never has the unity and character of the\r\nbook been demonstrated so convincingly and conclusively. The step is\r\nmade and the plane is reached by the method which is practised in other\r\ndepartments of literary criticism, viz., by dispassionate investigation\r\nof the work and by discarding fashionable _a priori_ theories.\"\r\n\r\nThe distinguished English traveller and writer on biblical subjects\r\npoints out, however, that in detail many of Harnack's objections to the\r\nLukan narratives are due to insufficient consideration of the\r\ncircumstances in which they were written and the comparative\r\nsignificance of the details criticised. He says, \"Harnack lays much\r\nstress on the fact that inconsistencies and inexactnesses occur all\r\nthrough Acts. Some of these are undeniable; and I have argued that they\r\nare to be regarded in the same light as similar phenomena in the poem of\r\nLucretius and in other ancient classical writers, viz., as proofs that\r\nthe work never received the final form which Luke intended to give it,\r\nbut was still incomplete when he died. The evident need for a third book\r\nto complete the work, together with those blemishes in expression, form\r\nthe proof.\"\r\n\r\nRamsay's placing of Harnack's writing in general is interesting in this\r\nconnection. (P. 8) \"Professor Harnack stands on the border between the\r\nnineteenth and twentieth century. His book shows that he is to a certain\r\ndegree sensitive of and obedient to the new spirit; but he is only\r\npartially so. The nineteenth century critical method was false, and is\r\nalready antiquated....\r\n\r\n\"The first century could find nothing real and true that was not\r\naccompanied by the marvellous and the 'supernatural.' The nineteenth\r\ncentury could find nothing real and true that was. Which view was right\r\nand which was wrong? Was either complete? Of these two questions, the\r\nsecond alone is profitable at the present. Both views were right--in a\r\ncertain way of contemplating; both views were wrong--in a certain way.\r\nNeither was complete. At present, as we are struggling to throw off the\r\nfetters which impeded thought in the nineteenth century, it is most\r\nimportant to free ourselves from its prejudices and narrowness.\"\r\n\r\nHe adds (pp. 26 and 27): \"There are clear signs of the unfinished state\r\nin which this chapter was left by Luke; but some of the German scholar's\r\ncriticisms show that he has not a right idea of the simplicity of life\r\nand equipment that evidently characterized the jailer's house and the\r\nprison. The details which he blames as inexact and inconsistent are\r\nsometimes most instructive about the circumstances of this provincial\r\ntown and Roman colonia.\r\n\r\n\"But it is never safe to lay much stress on small points of inexactness\r\nor inconsistency in any author. One finds such faults even in the works\r\nof modern scholarship if one examines them in the microscopic fashion in\r\nwhich Luke is studied here. I think I can find them in the author\r\n[Harnack] himself. His point of view sometimes varies in a puzzling\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Harnack, as pointed out by Ramsay, was evidently\r\nworking himself more and more out of the old conclusion as to the lack\r\nof authenticity of the Lucan writings into an opinion ever more and more\r\nfavorable to Luke. For instance, in a notice of his own book, published\r\nin the _Theologische Literaturzeitung_, \"he speaks far more favorably\r\nabout the trustworthiness and credibility of Luke, as being generally in\r\na position to acquire and transmit reliable information, and as having\r\nproved himself able to take advantage of his position. Harnack was\r\ngradually working his way to a new plane of thought. His later opinion\r\nis more favorable.\"\r\n\r\nRamsay also points out that Professor Giffert, one of our American\r\nbiblical critics, had felt compelled by the geographical and historical\r\nevidence to abandon in part the older unfavorable criticism of Luke and\r\nto admit that the Acts is more trustworthy than previous critics\r\nallowed. Above all, \"he saw that it was a living piece of literature\r\nwritten by one author.\" In a word, Luke is being vindicated in every\r\nregard.\r\n\r\nSome of the supposed inaccuracies of Luke vanish when careful\r\ninvestigation is made. Some of his natural history details, for\r\ninstance, have been impugned and the story of the viper that \"fastened\"\r\nitself upon St. Paul in Malta has been cited as an example of a story\r\nthat would not have been told in that way by a man who knew medicine and\r\nthe related sciences in Luke's time. Because the passage illustrates a\r\nnumber of phases of the discussion with regard to Luke's language I make\r\na rather long quotation from Ramsay:\r\n\r\n     Take as a specimen with which to finish off this paper the\r\n     passage Acts xxviii, 9 _et seq._, which is very fully\r\n     discussed by Harnack twice. He argues that the true meaning of\r\n     the passage was not understood until medical language was\r\n     compared, when it was shown that the Greek word by which the\r\n     act of the viper to Paul's hand is described, implies \"bit\"\r\n     and not merely \"fastened upon.\" But it is a well-assured fact\r\n     that the viper, a poisonous snake, only strikes, fixes the\r\n     poison fangs on the flesh for a moment, and withdraws its head\r\n     instantly. Its action could never be what is attributed by\r\n     Luke the eye witness to this Maltese viper; that it hung from\r\n     Paul's hand and was shaken off into the fire by him. On the\r\n     other hand, constrictors, which have no poison fangs, cling in\r\n     the way described, but as a rule do not bite. Are we, then, to\r\n     understand in spite of the medical style and the authority of\r\n     Professor Blass (who translates \"momordit\" in his edition),\r\n     that the viper fastened upon the apostle's hand? Then, the\r\n     very name viper is a difficulty. Was Luke mistaken about the\r\n     kind of snake which he saw? A trained medical man in ancient\r\n     times was usually a good authority about serpents, to which\r\n     great respect was paid in ancient medicine and custom.\r\n\r\n     Mere verbal study is here utterly at fault. We can make no\r\n     progress without turning to the realities and facts of Maltese\r\n     natural history. A correspondent obligingly informed me some\r\n     years ago that Mr. Bryan Hook, of Farnham, Surrey (who, my\r\n     correspondent assures me, is a thoroughly good naturalist),\r\n     had found in Malta a small snake, _Coronella austriaca_, which\r\n     is rare in England, but common in many parts of Europe. It is\r\n     a constrictor, without poison fangs, which would cling to the\r\n     hand or arm as Luke describes. It is similar in size to the\r\n     viper, and so like in markings and general appearance that Mr.\r\n     Hook, when he caught his specimen, thought he was killing a\r\n     viper.\r\n\r\n     My friend, Prof. J.W.H. Trail, of Aberdeen, whom I consulted,\r\n     replied that _Coronella laevis_ or _austriaca_, is known in\r\n     Sicily and the adjoining islands; but he can find no evidence\r\n     of its existence in Malta. It is known to be rather irritable,\r\n     and to fix its small teeth so firmly into the human skin as to\r\n     need a little force to pull it off, though the teeth are too\r\n     short to do any real injury to the skin. Coronella is at a\r\n     glance very much like a viper; and in the flames it would not\r\n     be closely examined. While it is not reported as found in\r\n     Malta except by Mr. Hook, two species are known there\r\n     belonging to the same family and having similar habits\r\n     (_leopardinus_ and _zamenis_ (or _coluber_) _gemonensis_). The\r\n     coloring of _Coronella leopardinus_ would be the most likely\r\n     to suggest a viper.\r\n\r\n     The observations justify Luke entirely. We have here a snake\r\n     so closely resembling a viper as to be taken for one by a good\r\n     naturalist until he had caught and examined a specimen. It\r\n     clings, and yet it also bites without doing harm. That the\r\n     Maltese rustics should mistake this harmless snake for a\r\n     venomous one is not strange. Many uneducated people have the\r\n     idea that all snakes are poisonous in varying degrees, just as\r\n     the vulgar often firmly believe that toads are poisonous.\r\n     Every detail as related by Luke is natural, and in accordance\r\n     with the facts of the country.\r\n\r\nIn a word, then, the whole question as to Luke's authority as a writer,\r\nas an eye-witness of many things, and as the relator of many others with\r\nregard to which he had obtained the testimony of eye-witnesses is fully\r\nvindicated. Twenty years ago many scholars were prone to doubt this\r\nwhole question. Ten years ago most of them were convinced that the Luke\r\ntraditions were not justified by recent investigation. Now we have come\r\nback once more to the complete acceptance of the old traditions.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most unfortunate characteristic of much nineteenth-century\r\ncriticism in all departments, even those strictly scientific, was the\r\nmarked tendency to reject previous opinions for new ones. Somehow men\r\nfelt themselves so far ahead of old-time writers and thinkers that they\r\nconcluded they must hold opinions different from their ancestors. In\r\nnearly every case the new ideas that they evolved by supposedly newer\r\nmethods are not standing the test of time and further study. There had\r\nbeen a continuous belief in men's minds, having its basis very probably\r\non a passage in one of St. Peter's Epistles, that the earth would\r\ndissolve by fire. This was openly contradicted all during the nineteenth\r\ncentury and the time when the earth would freeze up definitely\r\ncalculated by our mathematicians. Now after having studied\r\nradioactivity and learned from the physicist that the earth is heating\r\nup and will eventually get too hot for life, we calmly go back to the\r\nold Petrine declaration. Some of the most distinguished of the German\r\nbiologists of the present day, such men as Driesch and others, calmly\r\ntell us that the edifice erected by Darwin will have to come down\r\nbecause of newly discovered evidence, and indeed some of them go so far\r\nas to declare that Darwinism was a crude hypothesis very superficial in\r\nits philosophical aspects and therefore acceptable to a great many\r\npeople who, because it was easy to understand and was very different\r\nfrom what our fathers had believed, hastened to accept it. Nothing shows\r\nthe necessity for being conservative in the matter of new views in\r\nscience or ethics or religion more than the curious transition state in\r\nwhich we are with regard to many opinions at the present time, with a\r\ndistinct tendency toward reaction to older views that a few years ago\r\nwere thought quite untenable. We are rather proud of the advance that we\r\nare supposed to be making along many lines in science and scholarship,\r\nand yet over and over again, after years of work, we prove to have been\r\nfollowing a wrong lead and must come back to where we started. This has\r\nbeen the way of man from the beginning and doubtless will continue. The\r\npresent generation are having this curious regression that follows\r\nsupposed progress strongly emphasized for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nSCIENCE AT THE MEDIEVAL UNIVERSITIES[35]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the growth of interest in science and in nature study in our own\r\nday, one of the expressions that is probably oftenest heard is surprise\r\nthat the men of preceding generations and especially university men did\r\nnot occupy themselves more with the world around them and with the\r\nphenomena that are so tempting to curiosity. Science is usually supposed\r\nto be comparatively new and nature study only a few generations old. Men\r\nare supposed to have been so much interested in book knowledge and in\r\nspeculations and theories of many kinds, that they neglected the\r\nrealities of life around them while spinning fine webs of theory.\r\nPrevious generations, of course, have indulged in theory, but then our\r\nown generation is not entirely free from that amusing occupation.\r\nNothing could well be less true, however, than that the men of preceding\r\ngenerations were not interested in science even in the sense of physical\r\nscience, or that nature study is new, or that men were not curious and\r\ndid not try to find out all they could about the phenomena of the world\r\naround them.\r\n\r\nThe medieval universities and the school-men who taught in them have\r\nbeen particularly blamed for their failure to occupy themselves with\r\nrealities instead of with speculation. We are coming to recognize their\r\nwonderful zeal for education, the large numbers of students they\r\nattracted, the enthusiasm of their students, since they made so many\r\nhandwritten copies of the books of their masters, the devotion of the\r\nteachers themselves, who wrote at much greater length than do our\r\nprofessors even now and on the most abstruse subjects, so that it is all\r\nthe more surprising to think they should have neglected science. The\r\nthought of our generation in the matter, however, is founded entirely on\r\nan assumption. Those who know anything about the writers of the Middle\r\nAges at first hand are not likely to think of them as neglectful of\r\nscience even in our sense of the term. Those who know them at second\r\nhand are, however, very sure in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe assumption is due to the neglect of history that came in the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries. We have many other similar\r\nassumptions because of the neglect of many phases of mental development\r\nand applied science at this time. For instance, most of us are very\r\nproud of our modern hospital development and think of this as a great\r\nhumanitarian evolution of applied medical science. We are very likely to\r\nthink that this is the first time in the world's history that the\r\nbuilding of hospitals has been brought to such a climax of development,\r\nand that the houses for the ailing in the olden time were mere refuges,\r\nprone to become death traps and at most makeshifts for the solution of\r\nthe problem of the care of the ailing poor. This is true for the\r\nhospitals of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but it is not\r\ntrue at all for the hospitals of the thirteenth and fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries. Miss Nutting and Miss Dock in their \"History of\r\nNursing\"[36] have called attention to the fact that the lowest period in\r\nhospital development is during the eighteenth and early nineteenth\r\ncenturies. Hospitals were little better than prisons, they had narrow\r\nwindows, were ill provided with light and air and hygienic arrangements,\r\nand in general were all that we should imagine old-time hospitals to be.\r\nThe hospitals of the earlier time, however, had fine high ceilings,\r\nlarge windows, abundant light and air, excellent arrangements for the\r\nprivacy of patients, and in general were as worthy of the architects of\r\nthe earlier times as the municipal buildings, the cathedrals, the\r\ncastles, the university buildings, and every other form of construction\r\nthat the late medieval centuries devoted themselves to.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with those who assume that there was no study of science and\r\npractically no attention to nature study in the Middle Ages is that they\r\nknow nothing at all at first hand about the works of the men who wrote\r\nin the medieval period. They have accepted declarations with regard to\r\nthe absolute dependence of the scholastics on authority, their almost\r\ndivine worship of Aristotle, their utter readiness to accept\r\nauthoritative assertions provided they came with the stamp of a mighty\r\nname, and then their complete lack of attention to observation and above\r\nall to experiment. Nothing could well be more ridiculous than this\r\nignorant assumption of knowledge with regard to the great teachers at\r\nthe medieval universities. Just as soon as there is definite knowledge\r\nof what these great teachers wrote and taught, not only does the\r\nprevious mood of blame for them for not paying much more attention to\r\nscience and nature at once disappear, but it gives place to the\r\nheartiest admiration for the work of these great thinkers. It is easy to\r\nappreciate, then, what Professor Saintsbury said in a recent volume on\r\nthe thirteenth century:\r\n\r\n     And there have even been in these latter days some graceless\r\n     ones who have asked whether the science of the nineteenth\r\n     century after an equal interval will be of any more positive\r\n     value--whether it will not have even less comparative interest\r\n     than that which appertains to the scholasticism of the\r\n     thirteenth.\r\n\r\nThree men were the great teachers in the medieval universities at their\r\nprime. They have been read and studied with interest ever since. They\r\nwrote huge tomes, but men have pored over them in every generation. They\r\nwere Albertus Magnus, the teacher of the other two, Thomas Aquinas and\r\nRoger Bacon. All three of them were together at the University of Paris\r\nshortly after the middle of the thirteenth century. Anyone who wants to\r\nknow anything about the attitude of mind of the medieval universities,\r\ntheir professors and students, and of all the intellectual world of the\r\ntime towards science and observation and experiment, should read the\r\nbooks of these men. Any other mode of getting at any knowledge of the\r\nreal significance of the science of this time is mere pretence. These\r\nconstitute the documents behind any scientific history of the\r\ndevelopment of science at this time.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely interesting to see the attitude of these men with regard\r\nto authority. In Albert's tenth book (of his \"Summa\"), in which he\r\ncatalogues and describes all the trees, plants, and herbs known in his\r\ntime, he observes: \"All that is here set down is the result of our own\r\nexperience, or has been borrowed from authors whom we know to have\r\nwritten what their personal experience has confirmed; for in these\r\nmatters experience alone can be of certainty.\" In his impressive Latin\r\nphrase \"_experimentum solum certificat in talibus_.\" With regard to the\r\nstudy of nature in general he was quite as emphatic. He was a theologian\r\nas well as a scientist, yet in his treatise on \"The Heavens and the\r\nEarth\" he declared that \"in studying nature we have not to inquire how\r\nGod the Creator may, as He freely wills, use His creatures to work\r\nmiracles and thereby show forth His power. We have rather to inquire\r\nwhat nature with its immanent causes can naturally bring to pass.\"[37]\r\n\r\nJust as striking quotations on this subject might be made from Roger\r\nBacon. Indeed, Bacon was quite impatient with the scholars around him\r\nwho talked over-much, did not observe enough, depended to excess on\r\nauthority, and in general did as mediocre scholars always do, made much\r\nfuss on second-hand information--plus some filmy speculations of their\r\nown. Friar Bacon, however, had one great pupil whose work he thoroughly\r\nappreciated because it exhibited the opposite qualities. This was\r\nPetrus--we have come to know him as Peregrinus--whose observations on\r\nmagnetism have excited so much attention in recent years with the\r\nrepublications of his epistle on the subject. It is really a monograph\r\non magnetism written in the thirteenth century. Roger Bacon's opinion of\r\nit and of its author furnishes us the best possible index of his\r\nattitude of mind towards observation and experiment in science.\r\n\r\n     I know of only one person who deserves praise for his work in\r\n     experimental philosophy for he does not care for the\r\n     discourses of men and their wordy warfare, but quietly and\r\n     diligently pursues the works of wisdom. Therefore what others\r\n     grope after blindly, as bats in the evening twilight, this man\r\n     contemplates in their brilliancy _because he is a master of\r\n     experiment_. Hence, he knows all of natural science whether\r\n     pertaining to medicine and alchemy, or to matters celestial or\r\n     terrestrial. He has worked diligently in the smelting of ores\r\n     as also in the working of minerals; he is thoroughly\r\n     acquainted with all sorts of arms and implements used in\r\n     military service and in hunting, besides which he is skilled\r\n     in agriculture and in the measurement of lands. It is\r\n     impossible to write a useful or correct treatise in\r\n     experimental philosophy without mentioning this man's name.\r\n     Moreover, he pursues knowledge for its own sake; for if he\r\n     wished to obtain royal favor, he could easily find sovereigns\r\n     who would honor and enrich him.\r\n\r\nSimilar expressions might readily be quoted from Thomas Aquinas, but his\r\nworks are so easy to secure and his whole attitude of mind so well\r\nknown, that it scarcely seems worth while taking space to do so. Aquinas\r\nis still studied very faithfully in many universities, and within the\r\nlast few years one of his great text-books of philosophy has been\r\nreplaced in the curriculum of Oxford University, in which it occupied a\r\nprominent position in the long ago, as a work that may be offered for\r\nexamination in the department of philosophy. It is with regard to him\r\nparticularly that there has been the greatest revulsion of feeling in\r\nrecent years and a recognition of the fact that here was a great thinker\r\nfamiliar with all that was known in the physical sciences, and who had\r\nthis knowledge constantly in his mind when he drew his conclusions with\r\nregard to philosophical and theological questions.\r\n\r\nIt used to be the fashion to make little of the medieval scholars for\r\nthe high estimation in which they held Aristotle. Occasionally even yet\r\none hears narrowly educated men, I am sorry to say much more frequently\r\nscientific specialists than others, talk deprecatingly of this ardent\r\ndevotion to Aristotle. No one who knows anything about Aristotle ever\r\nindulges in such an exhibition of ignorance of the realities of the\r\nhistory of philosophy and science. To know Aristotle well is to think of\r\nhim as probably possessed of the greatest human mind that ever existed.\r\nWe do not need to go back to the Middle Ages to be confirmed in that\r\nopinion. Modern scientists who know their science well, but who also\r\nknow Aristotle well, and who are ardent worshippers at his shrine, are\r\nnot hard to find. Romanes, the great English biologist of the end of the\r\nnineteenth century, said: \"It appears to me that there can be no\r\nquestion that Aristotle stands forth not only as the greatest figure in\r\nantiquity but as the greatest intellect that has ever appeared upon this\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Romanes, George H. Lewes, in his interesting monograph in the\r\nhistory of thought, \"Aristotle, a Chapter in the History of Science,\" is\r\nquite as complimentary to the great Greek thinker. We may say that Lewes\r\nwas by no means partial to Aristotle. Anything but inclined to accept\r\nauthority as of value in philosophy, he had been rendered impatient by\r\nthe fact that so much of the history of philosophy was dominated by\r\nAristotle, and it was only that the panegyric was forced from him by\r\ncareful study of all that the Stagirite wrote that he said: \"History\r\ngazed on him with wonder. His intellect was piercing and comprehensive;\r\nhis attainments surpassed those of every philosopher; his influence has\r\nbeen excelled only by the founders of religion ... his vast and active\r\nintelligence for twenty centuries held the world in awe.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Osborn, whose scholarly study of the theory of evolution down\r\nthe ages \"From the Greeks to Darwin\" rather startled the world of\r\nscience by showing not only how old was a theory of evolution, but how\r\nfrequently it had been stated and how many of them anticipated phases of\r\nour own thought in the matter, pays a high compliment to the great Greek\r\nscientist. He says: \"Aristotle clearly states and rejects a theory of\r\nthe origin of adaptive structures in animals altogether similar to that\r\nof Darwin.\" He then quotes certain passages from Aristotle's \"Physics,\"\r\nand says: \"These passages seem to contain absolute evidence that\r\nAristotle had substantially the modern conception of the evolution of\r\nlife, from a primordial, soft mass of living matter to the most perfect\r\nforms, and that even in these he believed that evolution was incomplete\r\nfor they were progressing to higher forms.\"\r\n\r\nModern French scientists are particularly laudatory in their estimation\r\nof Aristotle. The group of biologists, Buffon, Cuvier, St. Hilaire, and\r\nothers who called world attention to French science and its attainments\r\nabout a century ago, are all of them on record in highest praise of\r\nAristotle. Cuvier said: \"I cannot read his work without being ravished\r\nwith astonishment. It is impossible to conceive how a single man was\r\nable to collect and compare the multitude of facts implied in the rules\r\nand aphorisms contained in this book.\"\r\n\r\nIt is possible, however, to get opinions ardently laudatory of Aristotle\r\nfrom the serious students of any nation, provided only they know their\r\nAristotle. Sir William Hamilton, the Scotch philosopher, said:\r\n\r\n\"Aristotle's seal is upon all the sciences, his speculations have\r\ndetermined those of all subsequent thinkers.\" Hegel, the German\r\nphilosophic writer, is not less outspoken in his praise: \"Aristotle\r\npenetrated the whole universe of things and subjected them to\r\nintelligence.\" Kant, who is often said to have influenced our modern\r\nthinking more than any other in recent generations, has his compliment\r\nfor Aristotle. It relates particularly to that branch of philosophy with\r\nwhich Kant had most occupied himself. The Koenigsberg philosopher said:\r\n\"Logic since Aristotle, like Geometry since Euclid, is a finished\r\nscience.\"\r\n\r\nI do not want to tire you or I could quote many other authorities who\r\nproclaim Aristotle the genius of the race. They would include poets like\r\nDante and Goethe, scholars like Cicero and Anthon, literary men like\r\nLessing and Reich and many others. The scholars of the Middle Ages, far\r\nfrom condemnation for their devotion to Aristotle, deserve the highest\r\npraise for it. If they had done nothing else but appreciate Aristotle as\r\nour greatest modern scholars have done, that of itself would proclaim\r\ntheir profound scholarship.\r\n\r\nThe medieval writers are often said to have been uncritical in their\r\njudgment, but in their lofty estimation of Aristotle they displayed the\r\nfinest possible critical judgment. On the contrary, the generations who\r\nmade much of the opportunity to minimize medieval scholarship because of\r\nits worship at the shrine of Aristotle, must themselves fall under the\r\nsuspicion at least of either not knowing Aristotle or of not thinking\r\ndeeply about the subjects with regard to which he wrote. For in all the\r\nworld's history the rule has been that whenever men have thought deeply\r\nabout a subject and know what Aristotle has written with regard to that\r\nsubject, they have the liveliest admiration for the great Greek thinker.\r\nThis is true for philosophy, logic, metaphysics, politics, ethics,\r\ndramatics, but it is also quite as true for physical science. He lacked\r\nour knowledge, though not nearly to the degree that is usually thought,\r\nand he had a marvellous accumulation of information, but he had a\r\nbreadth of view and a thoroughness of appreciation with a power of\r\npenetration that make his opinions worth while knowing even on\r\nscientific subjects in our enlightened age.\r\n\r\nAs for the supposed swearing by Aristotle, in the sense of literally\r\naccepting his opinions without daring to examine them critically, which\r\nis so constantly asserted to have been the habit of the medieval\r\nscholars and teachers, it is extremely difficult in the light of the\r\nexpressions which we have from them, to understand how this false\r\nimpression arose. Aristotle they thoroughly respected. They constantly\r\nreferred to his works, but so has every thinking generation ever since.\r\nWhenever he had made a declaration they would not accept the\r\ncontradiction of it without a good reason, but whenever they had good\r\nreasons, Aristotle's opinion was at once rejected without compunction.\r\nAlbertus Magnus, for instance, said: \"Whoever believes that Aristotle\r\nwas a God must also believe that he never erred, but if we believe that\r\nAristotle was a man, then doubtless he was liable to err just as we\r\nare.\" A number of direct contradictions of Aristotle we have from\r\nAlbert. A well-known one is that with regard to Aristotle's assertion\r\nthat lunar rainbows appeared only twice in fifty years. Albert declared\r\nthat he himself had seen two in a single year.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it seems very clear that the whole trend of thought among the\r\ngreat teachers of the time was away from the acceptance of scientific\r\nconclusions on authority unless there was good evidence for them\r\navailable. They were quite as impatient as the scientists of our time\r\nwith the constant putting forward of Aristotle as if that settled a\r\nscientific question. Roger Bacon wanted the Pope to forbid the study of\r\nAristotle because his works were leading men astray from the study of\r\nscience, his authority being looked upon as so great that men did not\r\nthink for themselves but accepted his assertions. Smaller men are always\r\nprone to do this, and indeed it constitutes one of the difficulties in\r\nthe way of advance in scientific knowledge at all times, as Roger Bacon\r\nhimself pointed out.\r\n\r\nThese are the sort of expressions that are to be expected from Friar\r\nBacon from what we know of other parts of his work. His \"Opus Tertium\"\r\nwas written at the request of Pope Clement IV, because the Pope had\r\nheard many interesting accounts of what the great thirteenth-century\r\nteacher and experimenter was doing at the University of Oxford, and\r\nwished to learn for himself the details of his work. Bacon starts out\r\nwith the principle that there are four grounds of human ignorance. These\r\nare, \"first, trust in inadequate authority; second, that force of custom\r\nwhich leads men to accept without properly questioning what has been\r\naccepted before their time; third, the placing of confidence in the\r\nassertions of the inexperienced; and fourth, the hiding of one's own\r\nignorance behind the parade of superficial knowledge, so that we are\r\nafraid to say I do not know.\" Professor Henry Morley, a careful student\r\nof Bacon's writings, said with regard to these expressions of Bacon:\r\n\r\n     No part of that ground has yet been cut away from beneath the\r\n     feet of students, although six centuries have passed. We still\r\n     make sheep-walks of second, third and fourth, and fiftieth\r\n     hand references to authority; still we are the slaves of\r\n     habit, still we are found following too frequently the\r\n     untaught crowd, still we flinch from the righteous and\r\n     wholesome phrase \"I do not know\" and acquiesce actively in the\r\n     opinion of others that we know what we appear to know.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Opus Majus\" Bacon had previously given abundant evidence of his\r\nrespect for the experimental method. There is a section of this work\r\nwhich bears the title \"Scientia Experimentalis.\" In this Bacon affirms\r\nthat \"without experiment nothing can be adequately known. An argument\r\nmay prove the correctness of a theory, but does not give the certitude\r\nnecessary to remove all doubt, nor will the mind repose in the clear\r\nview of truth unless it finds its way by means of experiment.\" To this\r\nhe later added in his \"Opus Tertium\": \"The strongest argument proves\r\nnothing so long as the conclusions are not verified by experience.\r\nExperimental science is the queen of sciences, and the goal of all\r\nspeculation.\"\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that Dr. Whewell, in his \"History of the Inductive\r\nSciences,\" should have been unstinted in his praise of Roger Bacon's\r\nwork and writings. In a well-known passage he says of the \"Opus Majus\":\r\n\r\n     Roger Bacon's \"Opus Majus\" is the encyclopedia and \"Novum\r\n     Organon\" of the thirteenth century, a work equally wonderful\r\n     with regard to its wonderful scheme and to the special\r\n     treatises by which the outlines of the plans are filled up.\r\n     The professed object of the work is to urge the necessity of a\r\n     reform in the mode of philosophizing, to set forth the reasons\r\n     why knowledge had not made greater progress, to draw back\r\n     attention to the sources of knowledge which had been unwisely\r\n     neglected, to discover other sources which were yet almost\r\n     untouched, and to animate men in the undertaking of a prospect\r\n     of the vast advantages which it offered. In the development of\r\n     this plan all the leading portions of science are expanded in\r\n     the most complete shape which they had at that time assumed;\r\n     and improvements of a very wide and striking kind are proposed\r\n     in some of the principal branches of study. Even if the work\r\n     had no leading purposes it would have been highly valuable as\r\n     a treasure of the most solid knowledge and soundest\r\n     speculations of the time; even if it had contained no such\r\n     details it would have been a work most remarkable for its\r\n     general views and scope.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the universities of the Middle Ages, far from\r\nneglecting science, were really scientific universities. Because the\r\nuniversities of the early nineteenth century occupied themselves almost\r\nexclusively with languages and especially formed students' minds by\r\nmeans of classical studies, men in our time seem to be prone to think\r\nthat such linguistic studies formed the main portion of the curriculum\r\nof the universities in all the old times and particularly in the Middle\r\nAges. The study of the classic languages, however, came into university\r\nlife only after the Renaissance. Before that the undergraduates of the\r\nuniversities had occupied themselves almost entirely with science. It\r\nwas quite as much trouble to introduce linguistic studies into the old\r\nuniversities in the Renaissance time to replace science, as it was to\r\nsecure room for science by pushing out the classics in the modern time.\r\nIndeed the two revolutions in education are strikingly similar when\r\nstudied in detail. Men who had been brought up on science before the\r\nRenaissance were quite sure that that formed the best possible means of\r\ndeveloping the mind. In the early nineteenth century men who had been\r\nformed on the classics were quite as sure that science could not replace\r\nthem with any success.\r\n\r\nThere is no pretence that this view of the medieval universities is a\r\nnew idea in the history of education. Those who have known the old\r\nuniversities at first hand by the study of the actual books of their\r\nprofessors and by familiarity with their courses of study, have not been\r\ninclined to make the mistake of thinking that the medieval university\r\nneglected science. Professor Huxley in his \"Inaugural Address as Rector\r\nof Aberdeen University\" some thirty years ago stated very definitely his\r\nrecognition of medieval devotion to science. His words are well worth\r\nremembering by all those who are accustomed to think of our time as the\r\nfirst in which the study of science was taken up seriously in our\r\nuniversities. Professor Huxley said:\r\n\r\n     The scholars of the medieval universities seem to have studied\r\n     grammar, logic, and rhetoric; arithmetic and geometry;\r\n     astronomy, theology, and music. Thus their work, however\r\n     imperfect and faulty, judged by modern lights, it may have\r\n     been, brought them face to face with all the leading aspects\r\n     of the many-sided mind of man. For these studies did really\r\n     contain, at any rate in embryo, sometimes it may be in\r\n     caricature, what we now call philosophy, mathematical and\r\n     physical science, and art. _And I doubt if the curriculum of\r\n     any modern university shows so clear and generous a\r\n     comprehension of what is meant by culture, as this old Trivium\r\n     and Quadrivium does._\r\n\r\nIt would be entirely a mistake, however, to think that these great\r\nwriters and teachers who influenced the medieval universities so deeply\r\nand whose works were the text-books of the universities for centuries\r\nafter, only had the principles of physical and experimental science and\r\ndid not practically apply them. As a matter of fact their works are full\r\nof observation. Once more, the presumption that they wrote only nonsense\r\nwith regard to science comes from those who do not know their writings\r\nat all, while great scientists who have taken the pains to study their\r\nworks are enthusiastic in praise. Humboldt, for instance, says of\r\nAlbertus Magnus, after reading some of his works with care:\r\n\r\n     Albertus Magnus is equally active and influential in promoting\r\n     the study of natural science and of the Aristotelian\r\n     philosophy. His works contain some exceedingly acute remarks\r\n     on the organic structure and physiology of plants. One of his\r\n     works bearing the title of \"Liber Cosmographicus De Natura\r\n     Locorum\" is a species of physical geography. I have found in\r\n     it considerations on the dependence of temperature\r\n     concurrently on latitude and elevation and on the effect of\r\n     different angles of the sun's rays in heating the ground which\r\n     have excited my surprise.\r\n\r\nIt is with regard to physical geography of course that Humboldt is\r\nhimself a distinguished authority.\r\n\r\nHumboldt's expression that he found some exceedingly acute remarks on\r\nthe organic structure and physiology of plants in Albert the Great's\r\nwritings will prove a great surprise to many people. Meyer, the German\r\nhistorian of botany, however, has re-echoed Humboldt's praise with\r\nemphasis. The extraordinary erudition and originality of Albert's\r\ntreatise on plants drew from Meyer the comment:\r\n\r\n     No botanist who lived before Albert can be compared with him\r\n     unless Theophrastus, with whom he was not acquainted; and\r\n     after him none has painted nature in such living colors or\r\n     studied it so profoundly until the time of Conrad Gessner and\r\n     Caesalpino.\r\n\r\nThese men, it may be remarked, come three centuries after Albert's time.\r\nA ready idea of Albert's contributions to physical science can be\r\nobtained from his life by Sighart, which has been translated into\r\nEnglish by Dixon and was published in London in 1870. Pagel, in\r\nPuschmann's \"History of Medicine,\" already referred to, gives a list of\r\nthe books written by Albert on scientific matters with some comments\r\nwhich are eminently suggestive, and furnish solid basis for the remark\r\nthat I have made, that men's minds were occupied with nearly the same\r\nproblems in science in the thirteenth century as we are now, while the\r\nconclusions they came to were not very different from ours, though\r\nreached so long before us.\r\n\r\nThis catalogue of Albertus Magnus' works shows very well his own\r\ninterest and that of his generation in physical science of all kinds.\r\nThere were eight treatises on Aristotle's physics and on the underlying\r\nprinciples of natural philosophy and of energy and of movement; four\r\ntreatises concerning the heavens and the earth, one on physical\r\ngeography which also contains, according to Pagel, numerous suggestions\r\non ethnography and physiology. There are two treatises on generation and\r\ncorruption, six books on meteors, five books on minerals, three books on\r\nthe soul, two books on the intellect, a treatise on nutritives, and then\r\na treatise on the senses and another on the memory and on the\r\nimagination. All the phases of the biological sciences were especially\r\nfavorite subjects of his study. There is a treatise on the motion of\r\nanimals, a treatise in six books on vegetables and plants, a treatise on\r\nbreathing things, a treatise on sleep and waking, a treatise on youth\r\nand old age, and a treatise on life and death. His treatise on minerals\r\ncontains, according to Pagel, a description of ninety-five different\r\nkinds of precious stones. Albert's volumes on plants were reproduced\r\nwith Meyer, the German botanist, as editor (Berlin, 1867). All of\r\nAlbert's books are available in modern editions.\r\n\r\nPagel says of Albertus that\r\n\r\n     His profound scholarship, his boundless industry, the almost\r\n     incontrollable impulse of his mind after universality of\r\n     knowledge, the many-sidedness of his literary productivity,\r\n     and finally the almost universal recognition which he received\r\n     from his contemporaries and succeeding generations, stamp him\r\n     as one of the most imposing characters and one of the most\r\n     wonderful phenomena of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nIn another passage Pagel has said:\r\n\r\n     While Albert was a Churchman and an ardent devotee of\r\n     Aristotle, in matters of natural phenomena he was relatively\r\n     unprejudiced and presented an open mind. He thought that he\r\n     must follow Hippocrates and Galen, rather than Aristotle and\r\n     Augustine, in medicine and in the natural sciences. We must\r\n     concede it a special subject of praise for Albert that he\r\n     distinguished very strictly between natural and supernatural\r\n     phenomena. The former he considered as entirely the object of\r\n     the investigation of nature. The latter he handed over to the\r\n     realm of metaphysics.\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon is, however, the one of these three great teachers who\r\nshows us how thoroughly practical was the scientific knowledge of the\r\nuniversities and how much it led to important useful discoveries in\r\napplied science and to anticipations of what is most novel even in our\r\npresent-day sciences. Some of these indeed are so startling, that only\r\nthat we know them not by tradition but from his works, where they may be\r\nreadily found without any doubt of their authenticity, we should be sure\r\nto think that they must be the result of later commentators' ideas.\r\nBacon was very much interested in astronomy, and not only suggested the\r\ncorrection of the calendar, but also a method by which it could be kept\r\nfrom wandering away from the actual date thereafter. He discovered many\r\nof the properties of lenses and is said to have invented spectacles and\r\nannounced very emphatically that light did not travel instantaneously\r\nbut moved with a definite velocity. He is sometimes said to have\r\ninvented gunpowder, but of course he did not, though he studied this\r\nsubstance in various forms very carefully and drew a number of\r\nconclusions in his observations. He was sure that some time or other man\r\nwould learn to control the energies exhibited by explosives and that\r\nthen he would be able to accomplish many things that seemed quite\r\nimpossible under present conditions.\r\n\r\nHe said, for instance:\r\n\r\n     Art can construct instruments of navigation, such that the\r\n     largest vessels governed by a single man will traverse rivers\r\n     and seas more rapidly than if they were filled with oarsmen.\r\n     One may also make carriages which without the aid of any\r\n     animal will run with remarkable swiftness.\r\n\r\nIn these days when the automobile is with us and when the principal\r\nsource of energy for motor purposes is derived from explosives of\r\nvarious kinds, this expression of Roger Bacon represents a prophecy\r\nmarvellously surprising in its fulfilment. It is no wonder that the book\r\nwhence it comes bears the title \"De Secretis Artis et Naturae.\" Roger\r\nBacon even went to the extent, however, of declaring that man would some\r\ntime be able to fly. He was even sure that with sufficient pains he\r\ncould himself construct a flying machine. He did not expect to use\r\nexplosives for his motor power, however, but thought that a windlass\r\nproperly arranged, worked by hand, might enable a man to make sufficient\r\nmovement to carry himself aloft or at least to support himself in the\r\nair, if there were enough surface to enable him to use his lifting power\r\nto advantage. He was in intimate relations by letter with many other\r\ndistinguished inventors and investigators besides Peregrinus and was a\r\nsource of incentive and encouragement to them all.\r\n\r\nThe more one knows of Aquinas the more surprise there is at his\r\nanticipation of many modern scientific ideas. At the conclusion of a\r\ncourse on cosmology delivered at the University of Paris he said that\r\n\"nothing at all would ever be reduced to nothingness\" (_nihil omnino in\r\nnihilum redigetur_). He was teaching the doctrine that man could not\r\ndestroy matter and God would not annihilate it. In other words, he was\r\nteaching the indestructibility of matter even more emphatically than we\r\ndo. He saw the many changes that take place in material substances\r\naround us, but he taught that these were only changes of form and not\r\nsubstantial changes and that the same amount of matter always remained\r\nin the world. At the same time he was teaching that the forms in matter\r\nby which he meant the combinations of energies which distinguish the\r\nvarious kinds of matter are not destroyed. In other words, he was\r\nanticipating not vaguely, but very clearly and definitely, the\r\nconservation of energy. His teaching with regard to the composition of\r\nmatter was very like that now held by physicists. He declared that\r\nmatter was composed of two principles, prime matter and form. By _forma_\r\nhe meant the dynamic element in matter, while by _materia prima_ he\r\nmeant the underlying substratum of material, the same in every\r\nsubstance, but differentiated by the dynamics of matter.\r\n\r\nIt used to be the custom to make fun of these medieval scientists for\r\nbelieving in the transmutation of metals. It may be said that all three\r\nof these greatest teachers did not hold the doctrine of the\r\ntransmutation of metals in the exaggerated way in which it appealed to\r\nmany of their contemporaries. The theory of matter and form, however,\r\ngave a philosophical basis for the idea that one kind of matter might be\r\nchanged into another. We no longer think that notion absurd. Sir William\r\nRamsay has actually succeeded in changing one element into another and\r\nradium and helium are seen changing into each other, until now we are\r\nquite ready to think of transmutation placidly. The Philosopher's Stone\r\nused to seem a great absurdity until our recent experience with radium,\r\nwhich is to some extent at least the philosopher's stone, since it\r\nbrings about the change of certain supposed elements into others. A\r\ndistinguished American chemist said not long ago that he would like to\r\nextract all the silver from a large body of lead ore in which it occurs\r\nso commonly, and then come back after twenty years and look for further\r\ntraces of silver, for he felt sure that they would be found and that\r\nlead ore is probably always producing silver in small quantities and\r\ncopper ore is producing gold.\r\n\r\nMost people will be inclined to ask where the fruits of this\r\nundergraduate teaching of science are to be found. They are inclined to\r\npresume that science was a closed book to the men and women of that\r\ntime. It is not hard, however, to point the effect of the scientific\r\ntraining in the writings of the times. Dante is a typical university man\r\nof the period. He was at several Italian universities, was at Paris and\r\nperhaps at Oxford. His writings are full of science. Professor Kuehns, of\r\nWesleyan, in his book \"The Treatment of Nature in Dante,\" has pointed\r\nout how much Dante knows of science and of nature. Few of the poets not\r\nonly of his own but of any time have known more. There are only one or\r\ntwo writers of poetry in our time who go with so much confidence to\r\nnature and the scientific interpretation of her for figures for their\r\npoetry. The astronomy, the botany, the zooelogy of Albertus Magnus and\r\nThomas Aquinas, Dante knew very well and used confidently for figurative\r\npurposes. Anyone who is inclined to think nature study a new idea in the\r\nworld forgets, or has never known, his Dante. The birds and the bees,\r\nthe flowers, the leaves, the varied aspects of clouds and sea, the\r\nphenomena of phosphorescence, the intimate habits of bird and beast and\r\nthe ways of the plants, as well as all the appearances of the heavens,\r\nDante knew very well and in a detail that is quite surprising when we\r\nrecall how little nature study is supposed to have attracted the men of\r\nhis time. Only that his readers appreciated it all, Dante would surely\r\nnot have used his scientific erudition so constantly.\r\n\r\nSo much for the undergraduate department of the universities of the\r\nMiddle Ages, and the view is absolutely fair, for these were the men to\r\nwhom the students flocked by thousands. They were teaching science, not\r\nliterature. They were discussing physics as well as metaphysics,\r\npsychology in its phenomena as well as philosophy, observation and\r\nexperiment as well as logic, the ethical sciences, economics,\r\npractically all the scientific ideas that were needed in their\r\ngeneration--and that generation saw the rise of the universities, the\r\nfinishing of the cathedrals, the building of magnificent town halls and\r\ncastles and beautiful municipal buildings of many kinds, including\r\nhospitals, the development of the Hansa League in commerce, and of\r\nwonderful manufacturers of all the textiles, the arts and crafts, as\r\nwell as the most beautiful book-making and art and literature. We could\r\nbe quite sure that the men who solved all the other problems so well\r\ncould not have been absurd only in their treatment of science. Anyone\r\nwho reads their books will be quite sure of that.\r\n\r\nWhile most people might be ready, then, to confess that possibly Huxley\r\nwas not mistaken with regard to the undergraduate department of the\r\nuniversities, most of them would feel sure that at least the graduate\r\ndepartments were sadly deficient in accomplishment. Once more this is\r\nentirely an assumption. The facts are all against any such idea.\r\n\r\nThere were three graduate departments in most of the\r\nuniversities--theology, law, and medicine. While physical scientists are\r\nusually not cognizant of it apparently, theology is a science, a\r\ndepartment of knowledge developed scientifically, and most of these\r\nmedieval universities did more for its scientific development than the\r\nschools of any other period. Quite as much may be said for philosophy,\r\nfor there are many who hesitate to attribute any scientific quality to\r\nmodern developments in the matter. As for law, this is the great period\r\nof the foundation of scientific law development; the English common law\r\nwas formulated by Bracton, the deep foundations of basic French and\r\nSpanish law were laid, and canon law acquired a definite scientific\r\ncharacter which it was always to retain. All this was accomplished\r\nalmost entirely by the professors in the law departments of the\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\nIt was in medicine, however, where most people would be quite sure\r\nwithout any more ado that nothing worth while talking about was being\r\ndone, that the great triumphs of graduate teaching at the medieval\r\nuniversities were secured. Here more than anywhere else is there room\r\nfor supreme surprise at the quite unheard-of anticipations of our modern\r\nmedicine and, stranger still, as it may seem, of our modern surgery.\r\n\r\nThe law regulating the practice of medicine in the Two Sicilies about\r\nthe middle of the thirteenth century shows us the high standard of\r\nmedical education. Students were required to have three years of\r\npreliminary study at the university, four years in the medical\r\ndepartment, and then practise for a year with a physician before they\r\nwere allowed to practise for themselves. If they wanted to practise\r\nsurgery, an extra year in the study of anatomy was required. I published\r\nthe text of this law, which was issued by the Emperor Frederick II about\r\n1241, in the _Journal of the American Medical Association_ three years\r\nago. It also regulated the practice of pharmacy. Drugs were manufactured\r\nunder the inspection of the government and there was a heavy penalty for\r\nsubstitution, or for the sale of old inert drugs, or improperly prepared\r\npharmaceutical materials. If the government inspector violated his\r\nobligations as to the oversight of drug preparations the penalty was\r\ndeath. Nor was this law of the Emperor Frederick an exception. We have\r\nthe charters of a number of medical schools issued by the Popes during\r\nthe next century, all of which require seven years or more of university\r\nstudy, four of them in the medical department, before the doctor's\r\ndegree could be obtained. When new medical schools were founded they had\r\nto have professors from certain well-recognized schools on their staff\r\nat the beginning in order to assure proper standards of teaching, and\r\nall examinations were conducted under oath-bound secrecy and with the\r\nheaviest obligations on professors to be assured of the knowledge of\r\nstudents before allowing them to pass.\r\n\r\nIt might be easy to think, and many people are prone to do so, that in\r\nspite of the long years of study required there was really very little\r\nto study in medicine at that time. Those who think so should read\r\nProfessor Clifford Allbutt's address on the \"Historical Relations of\r\nMedicine and Surgery\" delivered at the World's Fair at St. Louis in\r\n1904. He has dwelt more on surgery than on medicine, but he makes it\r\nvery clear that he considers that the thinking professors of medicine of\r\nthe later Middle Ages were doing quite as serious work in their way as\r\nany that has been done since. They were carefully studying cases and\r\nwriting case histories, they were teaching at the bedside, they were\r\nmaking valuable observations, and they were using the means at their\r\ncommand to the best advantage. Of course there are many absurdities in\r\ntheir therapeutics, but then we must not forget there have always been\r\nmany absurdities in therapeutics and that we are not free from them in\r\nour day. Professor Richet, at the University of Paris, said not long\r\nago: \"The therapeutics of any generation is quite absurd to the second\r\nsucceeding generation.\" We shall not blame the medieval generations for\r\nhaving accepted remedies that afterwards proved inert, for every\r\ngeneration has done that, even our own.\r\n\r\nTheir study of medicine was not without lasting accomplishment, however.\r\nThey laid down the indications and the dosage for opium. They used iron\r\nwith success, they tried out many of the bitter tonics among the herbal\r\nmedicines, and they used laxatives and purgatives to good advantage.\r\nDown at Montpellier, Gilbert, the Englishman, suggested red light for\r\nsmallpox because it shortened the fever, lessened the lesions, and made\r\nthe disfigurement much less. Finsen was given the Nobel prize partly for\r\nre-discovery of this. They segregated erysipelas and so prevented its\r\nspread. They recognized the contagiousness of leprosy, and though it was\r\nprobably as widespread as tuberculosis is at the present time, they\r\nsucceeded not only in controlling but in eventually obliterating it\r\nthroughout Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was in surgery, however, that the greatest triumphs of teaching of\r\nthe medieval universities were secured. Most people are inclined to\r\nthink that surgery developed only in our day. The great surgeons of the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries, however, anticipated most of our\r\nteaching. They investigated the causes of the failure of healing by\r\nfirst intention, recognized the danger of wounds of the neck,\r\ndifferentiated the venereal diseases, described rabies, and knew much of\r\nblood poisoning, and operated very skilfully. We have their text-books\r\nof surgery and they are a never-ending source of surprise. They operated\r\non the brain, on the thorax, on the abdominal cavity, and did not\r\nhesitate to do most of the operations that modern surgeons do. They\r\noperated for hernia by the radical cure, though Mondeville suggested\r\nthat more people were operated on for hernia for the benefit of the\r\ndoctor's pocket than for the benefit of the patient. Guy de Chauliac\r\ndeclared that in wounds of the intestines patients would die unless the\r\nintestinal lacerations were sewed up, and he described the method of\r\nsuture and invented a needle holder. We have many wonderful instruments\r\nfrom these early days preserved in pictures at least, that show us how\r\nmuch modern advance is merely re-invention.\r\n\r\nThey understood the principles of aseptic surgery very well. They\r\ndeclared that it was not necessary \"that pus should be generated in\r\nwounds.\" Professor Clifford Allbutt says:\r\n\r\n     They washed the wound with wine, scrupulously removing every\r\n     foreign particle; then they brought the edges together, not\r\n     allowing wine or anything else to remain within--dry adhesive\r\n     surfaces were their desire. Nature, they said, produces the\r\n     means of union in a viscous exudation, or natural balm, as it\r\n     was afterwards called by Paracelsus, Pare, and Wurtz. In older\r\n     wounds they did their best to obtain union by cleansing,\r\n     desiccation, and refreshing of the edges. Upon the outer\r\n     surface they laid only lint steeped in wine. Powders they\r\n     regarded as too desiccating, for powder shuts in decomposing\r\n     matters; wine after washing, purifying, and drying the raw\r\n     surfaces evaporates.\r\n\r\nAlmost needless to say these are exactly the principles of aseptic\r\nsurgery. The wine was the best antiseptic that they could use and we\r\nstill use alcohol in certain cases. It would seem to many quite\r\nimpossible that such operations as are described could have been done\r\nwithout anaesthetics, but they were not done without anaesthetics. There\r\nwere two or three different forms of anaesthesia used during the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries. One method employed by Ugo da Lucca\r\nconsisted of the use of an inhalant. We do not know what the material\r\nemployed was. There are definite records, however, of its rather\r\nfrequent employment.\r\n\r\nWhat a different picture of science at the medieval universities all\r\nthis makes from what we have been accustomed to hear and read with\r\nregard to them. It is difficult to understand where the old false\r\nimpressions came from. The picture of university work that recent\r\nhistorical research has given us shows us professors and students busy\r\nwith science in every department, making magnificent advances, many of\r\nwhich were afterwards forgotten, or at least allowed to lapse into\r\ndesuetude.\r\n\r\nThe positive assertions with regard to old-time ignorance were all made\r\nin the course of religious controversy. In English-speaking countries\r\nparticularly it became a definite purpose to represent the old Church as\r\nvery much opposed to education of all kinds and above all to scientific\r\neducation. There is not a trace of that to be found anywhere, but there\r\nwere many documents that were appealed to to confirm the protestant\r\nview. There was a Papal bull, for instance, said to forbid dissection.\r\nWhen read it proves to forbid the cutting up of bodies to carry them to\r\na distance for burial, an abuse which caused the spread of disease, and\r\nwas properly prohibited. The Church prohibition was international and\r\ntherefore effective. At the time the bull was issued there were twenty\r\nmedical schools doing dissection in Italy and they continued to practise\r\nit quite undisturbed during succeeding centuries. The Papal physicians\r\nwere among the greatest dissectors. Dissections were done at Rome and\r\nthe cardinals attended them. Bologna at the height of its fame was in\r\nthe Papal States. All this has been ignored and the supposed bull\r\nagainst anatomy emphasized as representing the keynote of medical and\r\nsurgical history. Then there was a Papal decree forbidding the making of\r\ngold and silver. This was said to forbid chemistry or alchemy and so\r\nprevent scientific progress. The history of the medical schools of the\r\ntime shows that it did no such thing. The great alchemists of the time\r\ndoing really scientific work were all clergymen, many of them very\r\nprominent ecclesiastics.\r\n\r\nJust in the same way there were said to be decrees of the Church\r\ncouncils forbidding the practice of surgery. President White says in his\r\n\"Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom,\" that, as a\r\nconsequence of these, surgery was in dishonor until the Emperor\r\nWenceslaus, at the beginning of the fifteenth century, ordered that it\r\nshould be restored to estimation. As a matter of fact, during the two\r\ncenturies immediately preceding the first years of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, surgery developed very wonderfully, and we have probably the\r\nmost successful period in all the history of surgery except possibly our\r\nown. The decrees forbade monks to practise surgery because it led to\r\ncertain abuses. Those who found these decrees and wanted to believe\r\nthat they prevented all surgical development simply quoted them and\r\nassumed there was no surgery. The history of surgery at this time is one\r\nof the most wonderful chapters in human progress.\r\n\r\nThe more we know of the Middle Ages the more do we realize how much they\r\naccomplished in every department of intellectual effort. Their\r\ndevelopment of the arts and crafts has never been equalled in the modern\r\ntime. They made very great literature, marvellous architecture,\r\nsculpture that rivals the Greeks', painting that is still the model for\r\nour artists, surpassing illuminations; everything that they touched\r\nbecame so beautiful as to be a model for all the after time. They\r\naccomplished as much in education as they did in all the other arts,\r\ntheir universities had more students than any that have existed down to\r\nour own time, and they were enthusiastic students and their professors\r\nwere ardent teachers, writers, observers, investigators. While we have\r\nbeen accustomed to think of them as neglecting science, their minds were\r\noccupied entirely with science. They succeeded in anticipating much more\r\nof our modern thought, and even scientific progress, than we have had\r\nany idea until comparatively recent years. The work of the later Middle\r\nAges in mathematics is particularly strong, and was the incentive for\r\nmany succeeding generations. Roger Bacon insisted that, without\r\nmathematics, there was no possibility of real advance in physical\r\nscience. They had the right ideas in every way. While they were occupied\r\nmore with the philosophical and ethical sciences than we are, these were\r\nnever pursued to the neglect of the physical sciences in the strictest\r\nsense of that term.\r\n\r\nIs it not time that we should drop the foolish notions that are very\r\ncommonly held because we know nothing about the Middle Ages--and,\r\ntherefore, the more easily assume great knowledge--and get back to\r\nappreciate the really marvellous details of educational and scientific\r\ndevelopment which are so interesting and of so much significance at this\r\ntime?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III\r\n\r\nMEDIEVAL POPULARIZATION OF SCIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of collecting general information from many sources, of\r\nbringing it together into an easily available form, so as to save others\r\nlabor, of writing it out in compendious fashion, so that it could\r\nreadily pass from hand to hand, is likely to be considered typically\r\nmodern. As a matter of fact, the Middle Ages furnish us with many\r\nexamples of the popularization of science, of the writing of compendia\r\nof various kinds, of the gathering of information to save others the\r\ntrouble, and, above all, of the making of what, in the modern time, we\r\nwould call encyclopedias. Handbooks of various kinds were issued,\r\nmanuals for students and specialists, and many men of broad scholarship\r\nin their time devoted themselves to the task of making the acquisition\r\nof knowledge easy for others. This was true not only for history and\r\nphilosophy and literature, but also for science. It is not hard to find\r\nin each century of the Middle Ages some distinguished writer who devoted\r\nhimself to this purpose, and for the sake of the light that it throws on\r\nthese scholars, and the desire for information that must have existed\r\nvery commonly since they were tempted to do the work, it seems worth\r\nwhile to mention here their names, and those of the books they wrote,\r\nwith something of their significance, though the space will not permit\r\nus to give here much more than a brief _catalogue raisonne_ of such\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nVery probably the first who should be mentioned in the list is Boethius,\r\nwho flourished in the early part of the sixth century. He owed much of\r\nhis education to his adoptive father, afterwards his father-in-law,\r\nSymmachus, who, with Festus, represented scholarship at the court of the\r\nGothic King, Theodoric of Verona. These three--Festus, Symmachus, and\r\nBoethius--brought such a reputation for knowledge to the court that they\r\nare responsible for many of the wonderful legends of Dietrich of Bern,\r\nas Theodoric came to be called in the poems of the medieval German\r\npoets. The three distinguished and devoted scholars did much to save\r\nGreek culture at a time when its extinction was threatened, and Boethius\r\nparticularly left a series of writings that are truly encyclopedic in\r\ncharacter. There are five books on music, two on arithmetic, one on\r\ngeometry, translations of Aristotle's treatises on logic, with\r\ncommentaries; of Porphyry's \"Isagoge,\" with commentaries, and a\r\ncommentary on Cicero's \"Topica.\" Besides, he wrote several treatises in\r\nlogic and rhetoric himself, one on the use of the syllogism, and one on\r\ntopics, and in addition a series of theological works. His great\r\n\"Consolations of Philosophy\" was probably the most read book in the\r\nearly Middle Ages. It was translated into Anglo-Saxon by King Alfred,\r\ninto old German by Notker Teutonicus, the German monk of St. Gall, and\r\nits influence may be traced in Beowulf, in Chaucer, in High German\r\npoetry, in Anglo-Norman and Provencal popular poetry, and also in early\r\nItalian verse. Above all, the \"Divine Comedy\" has many references to it,\r\nwhile the \"Convito\" would seem to show that it was probably the book\r\nthat most influenced Dante. Though it is impossible to confirm by\r\ndocumentary evidence the generally accepted idea that Boethius died a\r\nmartyr for Christianity, the tradition can be traced so far back, and it\r\nhas been so generally accepted that this seems surely to have been the\r\ncase. The fact is interesting, as showing the attitude of scholars\r\ntowards the Church and of the Church towards scholarship thus early.\r\n\r\nThe next great name in the tradition should probably be that of\r\nCassiodorus, the Roman writer and statesman, prime minister of\r\nTheodoric, who, after a busy political life, retired to his estate at\r\nVivarium, and, in imitation of St. Benedict, who had recently\r\nestablished a monastery at Monte Cassino, founded a monastery there. He\r\nis said to have lived to the age of ninety-three. His retirement favored\r\nthis long life, for, after the death of Theodoric, troublous times came,\r\nand civil war, and only his monastic privileges saved him from the storm\r\nand stress of the times. He had been interested in literature and the\r\ncollection of information of many kinds before his retirement, and it is\r\nnot unlikely that his recognition of the fact that the monastic life\r\noffered opportunities for the pursuit of this, under favorable\r\ncircumstances, led him to take it up.\r\n\r\nWhile still a statesman he wrote a series of works relating to history\r\nand politics and public affairs generally. These consisted mainly of\r\nchronicles and panegyrics, and twelve books of miscellanies called\r\nVariae. After his retirement to the monastery, a period of ardent\r\ndevotion to writing begins, and a great number of books were issued. He\r\nevidently gathered round him a number of men whom he inspired with his\r\nspirit, or, perhaps, selected, because he found that, while they had a\r\ntaste for a quiet, peaceful spiritual life, they were also devoted to\r\nthe accumulation and diffusion of knowledge. A series of commentaries on\r\nportions of the Scriptures was written, the Jewish antiquities of\r\nJosephus translated, and the ecclesiastical histories of Theodoric,\r\nSozomen, and Socrates made available in Latin. Cassiodorus himself is\r\nsaid to have made a compendium of these, called the \"Historia\r\nTripartita,\" which was much used as a manual of history during\r\nsucceeding centuries. Then there were treatises on grammar, on\r\northography, and a series of works on mathematics. In all of his\r\nwritings Cassiodorus shows a special fondness for the symbolism of\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nThere is a well-grounded tradition that he insisted on the study of the\r\nGreek classics of medical literature, especially Hippocrates and Galen,\r\nand awakened the interest of the monks in the necessity for making\r\ncopies of these fathers of medicine. The tradition that he established\r\nat Vivarium is also found to have existed at Monte Cassino among the\r\nBenedictines, and, doubtless, to this is to be attributed the foundation\r\nof the medical school of Salerno, where Benedictine influence was so\r\nstrong. It is probable, therefore, that to Cassiodorus must be\r\nattributed the preservation in as perfect a state as we have them of the\r\nold Greek medical writers.\r\n\r\nHis main idea was, of course, the study of Scriptures, but with just as\r\nmany helps as possible. He thought that commentators, and historians,\r\nnot alone Christian, but also Hebrew and Pagan, should be studied to\r\nillustrate it, and then the commentaries of the Latin fathers, so that a\r\nthoroughly rounded knowledge of it should be obtained. He thus began an\r\n\"Encyclopedia Biblica,\" and set a host of workers at its accomplishment.\r\n\r\nEvery country in Europe shared this movement for the diffusion of\r\ninformation during the early Middle Ages, and the works of men from each\r\nof these countries in succeeding centuries has come down to us,\r\npreserved in spite of all the vicissitudes to which they were so liable\r\nduring the centuries before the invention of printing and the easy\r\nmultiplication of books. To many people it will seem surprising to learn\r\nthat the next evidence of deep broad interest in knowledge is to be\r\nfound in the next century in the distant west of Europe, in the Spanish\r\nPeninsula. It is a long step from the semi-barbaric splendor of the\r\nGothic court at Verona, to the bishop's palace in Seville in Andalusia.\r\nThe two cities are separated by what is no inconsiderable distance in\r\nour day. In the seventh century they must have seemed almost at the\r\nother end of the world from each other. Those who recall what we have\r\ninsisted on in several portions of the body of this work with regard to\r\nthe high place Spanish genius won for itself in the Roman Empire, and\r\nhow much of culture among the Spaniards of that time the occurrence of\r\nso many important writers of that nationality must imply, will not be\r\nsurprised at the distinguished work of a great Christian Spanish writer\r\nof the seventh century.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it would be only what might be expected for evidences of early\r\nawakening of the broadest culture to be found in Spain. The important\r\nname in the popularization of science in the seventh century is St.\r\nIsidore of Seville. He made a compendium of all the scattered scientific\r\ntraditions and information of his time with regard to natural phenomena\r\nin a sort of encyclopedia of science. This consisted of twenty\r\nbooks--chapters we would call them now--treating almost _de omni re\r\nscibili et quibusdam aliis_ (everything knowable and a few other things\r\nbesides). It is possible that the work may have been written by a number\r\nof collaborators under the patronage of the bishop, though there is no\r\nsure indication of this to be found either in the volume itself or even\r\ncontemporary history. All the ordinary scientific subjects are treated.\r\nAstronomy, geography, mineralogy, botany, and even man and the animals\r\nhave each a special chapter. Pouchet, in his \"History of the Natural\r\nSciences During the Middle Ages,\" calls attention to the fact that, in\r\ngrouping the animals for collective treatment in the different chapters,\r\nsometimes the most heterogeneous creatures are brought under a common\r\nheading. Among the fishes, for instance, are classed all living things\r\nthat are found in water. The whale and the dolphin, as well as sponges,\r\nand oysters, and crocodiles, and sea serpents, and lobsters, and\r\nhippopotamuses, all find a place together, because of the common watery\r\nhabitation. The early Spanish Churchman would seem to have had an\r\nenthusiastic zeal for complete classification that would surely have\r\nmade him a strenuous modern zooelogist.\r\n\r\nThe next link in the tradition of encyclopedic work is the Venerable\r\nBede, whose character was more fully honored by the decree on November\r\n13, 1899, by Pope Leo XIII declaring him a Doctor of the Church. Bede\r\nwas the fruit of that ardent scholarship which had risen in England as a\r\nconsequence of the introduction of Christianity. It had been fostered by\r\nthe coming of scholar saints from Ireland, but was, unfortunately,\r\ndisturbed by the incursions of the Danes. While Bede is known for his\r\ngreatest work, the \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People,\" which\r\ngives an account of Christianity in England from its beginning until his\r\nown day, he wrote many other works. His history is the foundation of all\r\nour knowledge of early British history, secular as well as religious,\r\nand has been praised by historical writers of all ages, who turned to it\r\nfor help with confidence. He wrote a number of other historical works.\r\nBesides, he wrote books on grammar, orthography, the metrical art, on\r\nrhetoric, on the nature of things, the seasons, and on the calculation\r\nof the seasons. These latter books are distinctly scientific. His\r\ncontributions to Gregorian Music are now of great value.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Alcuin and the monks, summoned by Charlemagne, take up the\r\ntradition of gathering and diffusing information, and the great\r\nmonasteries of Tours, Fulda, and St. Gall carry it on. Besides these,\r\nin the ninth century Monte Cassino comes into prominence as an\r\ninstitution where much was done of what we would now call encyclopedic\r\nwork. After his retirement from Salerno Constantine Africanus made his\r\ntranslations and commentaries on Arabian medicine, constituting what was\r\nreally a medical encyclopedia of information not readily available at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nAfter this, of course, the tradition is taken up by the universities,\r\nand it is only when, with the thirteenth century, there came the\r\ncomplete development of the university spirit, that encyclopedias\r\nreached their modern expression. Three great encyclopedists, Vincent of\r\nBeauvais, Thomas of Cantimprato, and Bartholomaeus Anglicus, are the most\r\nfamous. Vincent consulted all the authors sacred and profane that he\r\ncould lay hold on, and the number was, indeed, prodigious. I have given\r\nsome account of him in \"The Thirteenth Greatest of Centuries\" (Catholic\r\nSummer School Press, New York, third edition, 1910).\r\n\r\nIt would be very easy to conclude that these encyclopedias, written by\r\nclergymen for the general information of the educated people of the\r\ntimes, contain very little that is scientifically valuable, and probably\r\nnothing of serious medical significance. Any such thought is, however,\r\ndue entirely to unfamiliarity with the contents of these works. They\r\nundoubtedly contain absurdities, they are often full of misinformation,\r\nthey repeat stories on dubious authority, and sometimes on hearsay, but\r\nusually the source of their information is stated, and especially where\r\nit is dubious, as if they did not care to state marvels without due\r\nsupport. Books of popular information, however, have always had many\r\nqueer things,--queer, that is, to subsequent generations,--and it is\r\nrather amusing to pick up an encyclopedia of a century ago, much less a\r\nmillennium ago, and see how many absurd things were accepted as true.\r\nThe first edition of the \"Encyclopedia Britannica,\" issued one hundred\r\nand fifty years ago, furnishes an easily available source of the\r\nabsurdities our more recent forefathers accepted. The men of the Middle\r\nAges, however, were much better observers as a rule, and used much more\r\ncritical judgment, according to their lights, than we have given them\r\ncredit for. Often the information that they have to convey is not only\r\nvaluable, but well digested, thoroughly practical, and sometimes a\r\nmarvellous anticipation of some of our most modern thoughts. There is\r\none of these encyclopedias which, because it was written in my favorite\r\nthirteenth century, I have read with some care. It is simply a\r\ndevelopment of the work of preceding clerical encyclopedists, and often\r\nrefers to them. Because it contains some typical examples of the better\r\nsorts of information in these works, I have thought it worth while to\r\nquote two passages from it. The author is Bartholomaeus Anglicus, and the\r\nquaint English in which it is couched is quoted from \"Medical Lore\"\r\n(London, 1893). The book is all the more interesting because in a dear\r\nold English version, issued about 1540, the spellings of which are among\r\nthe great curiosities of English orthography, it was often read and\r\nconsulted by Shakespeare, who evidently quotes from it frequently, for\r\nnot a little of the quaint scientific lore that he uses for his figures\r\ncan be traced to expressions used in this book.\r\n\r\nThe first of the paragraphs that deserves to be quoted, discusses\r\nmadness, or, as we would call it, lunacy, and sums up the causes, the\r\nsymptoms, and the treatment quite as well as that has ever been done in\r\nthe same amount of space:\r\n\r\n     Madness cometh sometime of passions of the soul, as of\r\n     business and of great thoughts, of sorrow and of too great\r\n     study, and of dread: sometime of the biting of a wood hound,\r\n     or some other venomous beast; sometime of melancholy meats,\r\n     and sometime of drink of strong wine. And as the causes be\r\n     diverse, the tokens and signs be diverse. For some cry and\r\n     leap and hurt and wound themselves and other men, and darken\r\n     and hide themselves in privy and secret places. The medicine\r\n     of them is, that they be bound, that they hurt not themselves\r\n     and other men. And namely, such shall be refreshed, and\r\n     comforted, and withdrawn from cause and matter of dread and\r\n     busy thoughts. And they must be gladded with instruments of\r\n     music, and some deal be occupied.'\r\n\r\nThe second discusses in almost as thorough a way the result of the bite\r\nof a mad dog. The old English word for mad, wood, is constantly used.\r\nThe causes, the symptoms, and course of the disease, and its possible\r\nprevention by early treatment, are all discussed. The old tradition was\r\nalready in existence that sufferers from rabies or hydrophobia, as it is\r\ncalled, dreaded water, when it is really only because the spasm\r\nconsequent upon the thought even of swallowing is painful that they turn\r\nfrom it. That tradition has continued to be very commonly accepted even\r\nby physicians down to our own day, so that Bartholomew, the Englishman,\r\nin the thirteenth century, will not be blamed much for setting it forth\r\nfor popular information in his time some seven centuries ago. The idea\r\nthat free bleeding would bring about the removal of the virus is\r\ninteresting, because we have in recent years insisted in the case of the\r\nvery similar disease, tetanus, on allowing or deliberately causing\r\nwounds in which the tetanus microbe may have gained an entrance, to\r\nbleed freely.\r\n\r\n     The biting of a wood hound is deadly and venomous. And such\r\n     venom is perilous. For it is long hidden and unknown, and\r\n     increaseth and multiplieth itself, and is sometimes unknown to\r\n     the year's end, and then the same day and hour of the biting,\r\n     it cometh to the head, and breedeth frenzy. They that are\r\n     bitten of a wood hound have in their sleep dreadful sights,\r\n     and are fearful, astonied, and wroth without cause. And they\r\n     dread to be seen of other men, and bark as hounds, and they\r\n     dread water most of all things, and are afeared thereof full\r\n     sore and squeamous also. Against the biting of a wood hound\r\n     wise men and ready use to make the wounds bleed with fire or\r\n     with iron, that the venom may come out with the blood, that\r\n     cometh out of the wound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Medicinisches aus der Aeltesten Kirchen Geschichte.\"\r\nLeipzig, 1892.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Foulis, London and Edinburgh, 1910.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: My attention was called to the interesting story of the\r\nJewish physicians of the Middle Ages and their scientific accomplishment\r\nwhile writing the article on Joseph Hyrtl for the Catholic Encyclopedia.\r\nHis \"Das Arabische und Hebraeische in der Anatomie\" (Wien, 1879) has some\r\ninterestingly suggestive material on these important chapters of the\r\nhistory of medicine. (I owe my opportunity to consult it to the courtesy\r\nof the Surgeon-General's library.) Biographic material has been obtained\r\nfrom Carmoly's \"History of the Jewish Physicians,\" translated by Dr.\r\nDunbar for the _Maryland Medical and Surgical Journal_, some extra\r\ncopies of which were printed by John Murphy and Co., Baltimore, about\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century. Baas and Haeser's Histories of\r\nMedicine and Puschmann and Pagel's \"Handbook\" provided additional\r\nmaterial, and I have found Landau's \"Geschichte der Juedischen Aerzte\"\r\n(Berlin, 1895) of great service.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Of course there are many absurd things recommended in the\r\nTalmud. We cannot remind ourselves too often, however, that there have\r\nbeen absurd things at all times in medicine, and especially in\r\ntherapeutics. It is curious how often some of these absurdities have\r\nrepeated themselves. We are liable to think it very queer that men\r\nshould have presumed, or somehow jumped to the conclusion, that portions\r\nof animals might possess wonderful virtue for the healing of diseases of\r\nthe corresponding special parts of man. We ourselves, however, within a\r\nlittle more than a decade, had a phase of opotherapy--how much less\r\nabsurd it seems under that high-sounding Greek term--that was apparently\r\nvery learned in its scientific aspects yet quite as absurd as many\r\nphases of old-time therapy, as we look at it. We administered cardin for\r\nheart disease and nephrin for kidney trouble, cerebrin for insanity\r\n(save the mark!), and even prostate tissue for prostatism--and with\r\nreported good results! How many of us realize now that in this we were\r\nonly repeating the absurdities, so often made fun of in old medicine,\r\nwith regard to animal tissue and excrement therapeutics? The Talmud has\r\nmany conclusions with regard to the symptoms of patients drawn from\r\ndreams; as, for instance, it is said to be a certain sign of sanguineous\r\nplethora when one dreams of the comb of a cock. One phase of our\r\npsycho-analysis in the modern time, however, has taken us back to an\r\ninterpretation of dreams different of course from this, yet analogous\r\nenough to be quite striking.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: \"Maimonides,\" by David Yellin and Israel Abrahams,\r\nPhiladelphia, 1903.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: \"Das Arabische und Hebraeische in der Anatomie,\" Dr. Joseph\r\nHyrtl, Wien, 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: \"Anat.

It will not\r\nbe difficult, however, for anyone who recalls the conditions that\r\nobtained in old-time surgery. The ligature is a most satisfying\r\nimmediate resource in stopping bleeding from an artery, but a septic\r\nligature inevitably causes suppuration and almost inevitably leads to\r\nsecondary hemorrhage. In the old days of septic surgery secondary\r\nhemorrhage was the surgeon's greatest and most dreaded bane. Some time\r\nfrom the fifth to the ninth day a septic ligature came away under\r\nconditions such that inflammatory disturbance had prevented sealing of\r\nthe vessel. If the vessel was large, then the hemorrhage was fast and\r\nfurious and the patient died in a few minutes. After a surgeon had had a\r\nfew deaths of this kind he dreaded the ligature. He abandoned its use\r\nand took kindly to such methods as the actual cautery, red-hot knives\r\nfor amputations, and the like, that would sear the surfaces of tissues\r\nand the blood-vessels, and not give rise to secondary hemorrhage. A\r\nlittle later, however, someone not familiar with secondary risks would\r\nreinvent the ligature. If he were cleanly in his methods and, above all,\r\nif he were doing his work in a new hospital, the ligature worked very\r\nwell for a while. If not, it soon fell into innocuous desuetude again.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Puschmann: \"Handbuch der Geschichte der Medizin,\" Vol. I,\r\npage 652.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The first dentist who filled teeth with amalgam in New\r\nYork, some eighty years ago, had to flee for his life, because of a hue\r\nand cry set up that he was poisoning his patients with mercury.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: \"Storia de la Scuola di Salerno.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: It is probably interesting to note that the word\r\n_universitas_ as used here has no reference to our word university, but\r\nrefers to the whole world of students as it were. In the Middle Ages\r\nuniversities were called _studia generalia_, general studies--that is,\r\nplaces where everything could be studied and where everyone from any\r\npart of the world could study. Our use of the word university in the\r\nspecial modern sense of the term comes from the formal mode of address\r\nto the faculty of a university when Popes or rulers sent them\r\nauthoritative documents. Such documents began with the expression\r\n_Universitas vestra_, all of you (in the old-time English, as preserved\r\nin the Irish expression, \"the whole of ye\"), referring to all the\r\nmembers of the faculty. The transfer to our term and signification\r\nuniversity was not difficult.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Physicians wore a particular garb consisting of a cloak\r\nand often a mask, supposed to protect them from infections at this time,\r\nso that it was not difficult to make a characteristic picture as a sign\r\nfor a pharmacy.

It might seem that so old a man would have very little\r\ninfluence over the young man. Taddeo, however, had, as we have said, a\r\nvery strenuous old age. Everything in life had come to him late. He was\r\nwell past thirty before he began to study philosophy and medicine,\r\nhaving been a seller of candles from necessity because of poverty in his\r\nyounger years. His great success in practice came when he was past\r\nforty. He first began to teach when he was forty-five, and he was nearly\r\nfifty-five before he began to write. According to tradition he married\r\nwhen he was nearly eighty--whether for the first or second time is not\r\nsaid--and while this might be considered, and would in some cases be, an\r\nindication of weakness of character (it would probably depend on whether\r\nhe married or was married), it seems in his case to have indicated a\r\nvigor of body and character which shows very clearly how great was the\r\npossibility of his influence as a teacher having been maintained even up\r\nto this late time of life, and thus influencing a pupil who is to\r\nrepresent the most potent influence at the beginning of the next\r\ncentury.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Medical Library and Historical Journal_, 1906.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Pilcher (_loc. cit._) tells of her tomb.

How much older than this it may\r\nbe I do not know, though it is probable that it comes from the sixteenth\r\ncentury, when the _kakoethes scribendi_ attacked many people because of\r\nthe facility of printing, and when most of the good stories that have so\r\nworried the modern dry-as-dust historian in his researches for their\r\ncorrection became a part of the body of supposed historical tradition.\r\nIt is probably French in origin because in that language _antimoine_ is\r\na tempting bait for that pseudo-philology which has so often led to\r\nfalse derivations.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: There is in the New York Academy of Medicine a thick 24mo\r\nvolume in which three of the classics of older medicine are bound\r\ntogether. They are Kerckringius's \"Commentary on the Triumphal Chariot\r\nof Antimony,\" published at Amsterdam, 1671; Steno's \"Dissertation on the\r\nAnatomy of the Brain,\" published in Leyden in 1671, and Father Kircher's\r\n\"Scrutinium Physico Contagiosae Luis quae dicitur Pestis\"\r\n(Physico-medical Discussions of the Contagious Disease which is called\r\nPest). This was published at Leipzig in 1659. Just how the three works\r\ncame to be bound together is hard to say. Very probably they belonged to\r\nsome old-time scholar, though there is nothing about the books to tell\r\nanything of the story. The fact that all three of the authors were\r\necclesiastics of the Catholic Church, Valentine a Monk, Steno a Bishop,\r\nand Kircher a Jesuit, would seem to be one common bond and perhaps a\r\nreason for the binding of these rather disparate treatises together. In\r\nthat case it is probable that the book came from an old monastic library\r\ndispersed after the suppression of the order by some government. It\r\nseems not unlikely that the volume belonged at some time to an old\r\nJesuit library, for they have suffered the most in that way. That these\r\nthree classics of medicine should have been republished in handy volume\r\neditions within practically ten years shows an interest in medical\r\nliterature that has not existed again until our own time, for during the\r\neighteenth and early nineteenth centuries there was almost utter neglect\r\nof them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Paper read before the first meeting of the American Guild\r\nof St. Luke.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Published by Putnams, New York, 1909.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Dublin, 1882.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: The material for this chapter was gathered for a paper\r\nread before the Medical Improvement Society of Boston in the spring of\r\n1911.

Second Edition,\r\n1909. 362 pp. Price, $2.00 net.=\r\n\r\n_The London Lancet_ said: \"The list is well chosen, and we have to\r\nexpress gratitude for so convenient and agreeable a collection of\r\nbiographies, for which we might otherwise have to search through many\r\nscattered books. The sketches are pleasantly written, interesting, and\r\nwell adapted to convey the thoughtful members of our profession just the\r\namount of historical knowledge that they would wish to obtain. We hope\r\nthat the book will find many readers.\"\r\n\r\n_The New York Times_: \"The book is intended primarily for students of\r\nmedicine, but laymen will find it not a little interesting.\"\r\n\r\n_Il Morgagni_ (Italy): \"Professor Walsh narrates important lives in\r\nmodern medicine with an easy style that makes his book delightful\r\nreading. It certainly will give the young physician an excellent idea of\r\nwho made our modern medicine.\"\r\n\r\n_The Lamp_: \"This exceptionally interesting book is from the practiced\r\nhand of Dr. James J. Walsh. It is a suggestive thought that all of the\r\ngreat specialists portrayed were God-fearing men, men of faith, far\r\nremoved from the shallow materialism that frequently flaunts itself as\r\ninherently worthy of extra consideration for its own sake.\"\r\n\r\n_The Church Standard_ (_Protestant Episcopal_): \"There is perhaps no\r\nprofession in which the lives of its leaders would make more fascinating\r\nreading than that of medicine, and Dr. Walsh by his clever style and\r\nsympathetic treatment by no means mars the interest which we might thus\r\nexpect.\"\r\n\r\n_The New York Medical Journal_: \"We welcome works of this kind; they are\r\nevidence of the growth of culture within the medical profession, which\r\nbetokens that the time has come when our teachers have the leisure to\r\nlook backward to what has been accomplished.\"\r\n\r\n_Science_: \"The sketches are extremely entertaining and useful. Perhaps\r\nthe most striking thing is that every one of the men described was of\r\nthe Catholic faith, and the dominant idea is that great scientific work\r\nis not incompatible with devout adherence to the tenets of the Catholic\r\nreligion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=THE POPES AND SCIENCE--The story of the Papal Relations to Science\r\nfrom the Middle Ages down to the Nineteenth Century.

White's History of the Warfare of Science with Theology\r\nin Christendom will find their hands full, if they attempt to answer Dr.\r\nJames J. Walsh's The Popes and Science.\"\r\n\r\n_The Literary Digest_ said: \"The book is well worth reading for its\r\nextensive learning and the vigor of its style.\"\r\n\r\n_The Southern Messenger_ says: \"Books like this make it clear that it is\r\nignorance alone that makes people, even supposedly educated people,\r\nstill cling to the old calumnies.\"\r\n\r\n_The Nation_ (New York) says: \"The learned Fordham Physician has at\r\ncommand an enormous mass of facts, and he orders them with logic, force\r\nand literary ease. Prof. Walsh convicts his opponents of hasty\r\ngeneralizing if not anti-clerical zeal.\"\r\n\r\n_The Pittsburg Post_ says: \"With the fair attitude of mind and\r\ninfluenced only by the student's desire to procure knowledge, this book\r\nbecomes at once something to fascinate. On every page authoritative\r\nfacts confute the stereotyped statement of the purely theological\r\npublications.\"\r\n\r\nPROF. WELCH, of Johns Hopkins, quoting Martial, said: \"It is\r\npleasant indeed to drink at the living fountain-heads of knowledge after\r\npreviously having had only the stagnant pools of second-hand authority.\"\r\n\r\nPROF. PIERSOL, Professor of Anatomy at the University of\r\nPennsylvania, said: \"I have been reading the book with the keenest\r\ninterest, for it indeed presents many subjects in what to me at least is\r\na new light. Every man of science looks to the beacon--truth--as his\r\nguiding mark, and every opportunity to replace even time-honored\r\nmisconceptions by what is really the truth must be welcomed.\"\r\n\r\n_The Independent_ (New York) said: \"Dr. Walsh's books should be read in\r\nconnection with attacks upon the Popes in the matter of science by those\r\nwho want to get both sides.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=MAKERS OF ELECTRICITY--By Brother Potamian, F.C.S., Sc.D.

Illustrated. Price,\r\n$2.00 net. Postage, 15 cents extra.=\r\n\r\n_The Scientific American_: \"One will find in this book very good\r\nsketches of the lives of the great pioneers in Electricity, with a clear\r\npresentation of how it was that these men came to make their fundamental\r\nexperiments, and how we now reach conclusions in Science that would have\r\nbeen impossible until their work of revealing was done. The biographies\r\nare those of Peregrinus, Columbus, Norman and Gilbert, Franklin and some\r\ncontemporaries, Galvini, Volta, Coulomb, Oersted, Ampere, Ohm, Faraday,\r\nClerk Maxwell, and Kelvin.\"\r\n\r\n_The Boston Globe_: \"The book is of surpassing interest.\"\r\n\r\n_The New York Sun_: \"The researches of Brother Potamian among the\r\npioneers in antiquity and the Middle Ages are perhaps more interesting\r\nthan Dr. Walsh's admirable summaries of the accomplishment of the heroes\r\nof modern science. The book testifies to the excellence of Catholic\r\nscholarship.\"\r\n\r\n_The Evening Post_: \"It is a matter of importance that the work and\r\nlives of men like Gilbert, Franklin, Galvini, Volta, Ampere and others\r\nshould be made known to the students of Electricity, and this office has\r\nbeen well fulfilled by the present authors. The book is no mere\r\ncompilation, but brings out many interesting and obscure facts,\r\nespecially about the earlier men.\"\r\n\r\n_The Philadelphia Record_: \"It is a glance at the whole field of\r\nElectricity by men who are noted for the thoroughness of their research,\r\nand it should be made accessible to every reader capable of taking a\r\nserious interest in the wonderful phenomena of nature.\"\r\n\r\n_Electrical World_: \"Aside from the intrinsic interest of its matter,\r\nthe book is delightful to read owing to the graceful literary style\r\ncommon to both authors. One not having the slightest acquaintance with\r\nelectrical science will find the book of absorbing interest as treating\r\nin a human way and with literary art the life work of some of the\r\ngreatest men of modern times; and, moreover, in the course of his\r\nreading he will incidentally obtain a sound knowledge of the main\r\nprinciples upon which almost all present-day electrical development is\r\nbased. It is a shining example of how science can be popularized without\r\nthe slightest twisting of facts or distortion of perspective. Electrical\r\nreaders will find the book also a scholarly treatise on the evolution of\r\nelectrical science, and a most refreshing change from the 'engineering\r\nEnglish' of the typical technical writer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=EDUCATION, HOW OLD THE NEW--A Series of Lectures and Addresses on\r\nPhases of Education in the Past Which Anticipate Most of Our Modern\r\nAdvances, by James J.

The\r\nbook is written in a straight, unpretentious and interesting style.\"\r\n\r\n_Wilkes-Barre Record_: \"The volume is most interesting and shows deep\r\nresearch bearing the marks of the indefatigable student.\"\r\n\r\n_Pittsburg Post_: \"There is no bitterness of controversy and one of the\r\nfirst things to strike the reader is that the dean of Fordham quotes\r\nfrom nearly everybody worth while, Protestant or Catholic, poetry,\r\nbiography, history, science or what not.\"\r\n\r\n_The Wall Street News_ (New York): \"The book is calculated to cause a\r\nhealthy reduction in the conceit which each generation enjoys at the\r\nexpense of that which preceded it.\"\r\n\r\n_Rochester Post Express_: \"The book is well worth reading.\"\r\n\r\n_The New Orleans Democrat_: \"The book makes very interesting reading,\r\nbut there is a succession of shocks in store in it for the complacent\r\nNew Englander or Bostonian and for the orthodox or perfunctory reader of\r\nAmerican literature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=CATHOLIC SUMMER SCHOOL PRESS SERIES=\r\n\r\nThe highest value attaches to historical research on the lines you so\r\nably indicate, especially at the present time, when the enemies of Holy\r\nChurch are making renewed efforts to show her antagonism to science and\r\nhuman progress generally.

Walsh, has recently published a\r\ncharming book on The Thirteenth as the Greatest of Centuries. He makes a\r\nvery good case for what is called the First Renaissance.\"\r\n\r\n_The Saturday Review_ (of London): \"The volume contains a mass of\r\ninteresting facts that will start a train of profitable thought in many\r\nreaders' minds.\"\r\n\r\n_The Educational Review_ said: \"The title of Dr. Walsh's book, The\r\nThirteenth Greatest of Centuries, will startle many readers, but we\r\nrespectfully commend to the open-minded his presentation of that great\r\nepoch. A century that witnessed such extraordinary achievements in\r\narchitecture, in arts and crafts, in education, and in literature and\r\nlaw, as did the Thirteenth, is not to be lightly dismissed or\r\nunfavorably compared with periods nearer our own.\"\r\n\r\n_The Pittsburg Post_ said: \"Dr. Walsh writes infused with all the\r\nlearning of the past, enthusiastic in modern research, and sympathetic,\r\nin true scholarly style, with investigation in every line. One need only\r\nrun over a few of the topical headings to feel how plausible the thesis\r\nis. The assemblage of the facts and the elucidation of their mutual\r\nrelations by Dr. Walsh shows the master's skill. The work bristles on\r\nevery page with facts that may be familiar to many, but which were never\r\nbefore so arranged in just perspective with their convincing force so\r\nclearly shown.\"\r\n\r\nCARDINAL MORAN, of Sydney, Australia: \"Just the sort of\r\nliterature we want for English readers at the present day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE SAME AUTHOR\r\n\r\n\r\nFORDHAM UNIVERSITY PRESS SERIES\r\n\r\nMAKERS OF MODERN MEDICINE\r\n\r\nLives of the men to whom nineteenth century medical science\r\nowes most.
