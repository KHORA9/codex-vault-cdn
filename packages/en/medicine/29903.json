It has two\r\nfundamental ideas--the study of nature, and the study of the\r\npsychology of man in health and in disease.\r\n\r\nTo harmonize the aspirations of human nature and the data of the\r\nsociology of the different human races and the different epochs of\r\nhistory, with the results of natural science and the laws of mental\r\nand sexual evolution which these have revealed to us, is a task which\r\nhas become more and more necessary at the present day. It is our duty\r\nto our descendants to contribute as far as is in our power to its\r\naccomplishment. In recognition of the immense progress of education\r\nwhich we owe to the sweat, the blood, and often to the martyrdom of\r\nour predecessors, it behoves us to prepare for our children a life\r\nmore happy than ours.\r\n\r\nI am well aware of the disproportion which exists between the\r\nmagnitude of my task and the imperfections of my work. I have not been\r\nable to study as much as should be done the innumerable works which\r\ntreat of the same subject. Others, better versed than myself in the\r\nliterature of the subject, will be able later on to fill this\r\nregrettable lacuna. I have endeavored, above all things, to study the\r\nquestion from all points of view, in order to avoid the errors which\r\nresult from any study which is made from one point of view only. This\r\nis a thing which has generally been neglected.\r\n\r\nI must express my thanks to my friend, _Professor Mahaim_, and\r\nespecially to my publisher and cousin, _S. Steinheil_, for the help\r\nand excellent advice which they have given me in the revision of my\r\nwork; also to _Professor Boveri_, who has been kind enough to revise\r\nthe figures, 1 to 17.\r\n\r\n                                                    DR. A. FOREL.\r\n\r\nChigny près Morges (Suisse).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe text of the first edition has been revised and corrected, but,\r\napart from some points of detail, the subject matter has not been\r\nchanged. The examples at the end of Chapter V (First Edition) no\r\nlonger form a special appendix; they have been included in the parts\r\nof the book which specially concern them; some of them have been\r\nomitted as being superfluous.\r\n\r\nIn the domain with which we are concerned the French public are too\r\nmuch afraid, I think, of crudities and of calling things by their\r\nproper name. By veiled words and by indirect locution one may say\r\nanything, but I have decided not to employ such subterfuges in\r\ntreating of such a vital social question with the seriousness that it\r\nrequires. It seems that there is a fear of young people hearing the\r\nsexual question spoken of freely and openly; but it is not taken into\r\naccount that in hiding these things under half-understood words one\r\nonly excites their curiosity, and, owing to their being blindfolded,\r\nthey are delivered into the snares and surprises of debauchery.\r\n\r\nI cannot better illustrate the error that I have just pointed out than\r\nby quoting, among several others of the same kind, a letter which I\r\nhave received from a young girl, aged 21 years, intelligent, virtuous,\r\neducated, and well brought up, but without restraint.\r\n\r\nHaving read my book she put several questions to me to which I\r\nreplied. On my part I requested her to tell me frankly:\r\n\r\n(1). If, in her opinion, I had been mistaken in my judgment of the\r\nsexual psychology of the normal young girl; (2). If my book had done\r\nher the least harm, moral or otherwise.\r\n\r\nI begged her to criticise me without pity, for I wished above all\r\nthings to be clear on the effect produced by my book. This is her\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n    \"I must thank you for the deep and unalterable impression which\r\n    your book has produced on me. I am a young girl of 21 years, and\r\n    you know how difficult it is for us to see clearly into those\r\n    natural things which so closely concern us. I cannot, therefore,\r\n    thank you too much for the calm enlightenment which has been\r\n    produced in me, and for the just and humane words which you\r\n    devote to the education of our sex. I hope one day to have the\r\n    good fortune to apply to my children the ideas on education with\r\n    which you have inspired me.\r\n\r\n    \"You ask me for the impression which your book has made on me.\r\n    It is true that I am still very young, but I have read much. My\r\n    mother has brought me up very freely, so that I can count myself\r\n    among the young girls who are free from prejudice. In spite of\r\n    this, a sort of internal anxiety or false shame has hindered me\r\n    from speaking of all the things of which you treat. All that I\r\n    knew I had read in books or derived by instinct. Although I knew\r\n    very well that my mother would always answer my questions I\r\n    never asked any.\r\n\r\n    \"I declare that latterly my mind had been in a state of\r\n    veritable chaos. I was obsessed and tormented by a fear of\r\n    everything of which I was ignorant and some day ought to learn.\r\n    This is why I was anxious to read your book which a friend\r\n    showed me. I will now express myself more clearly.\r\n\r\n    \"The first chapters were difficult for me, not because I could\r\n    not understand them, but owing to the strange and novel\r\n    experience which the truth made in me when plainly and\r\n    scientifically expounded. Wishing to read everything I applied\r\n    myself to the book laboriously. My first impression was that of\r\n    disgust for all human beings and mistrust of everything. But I\r\n    was soon glad to find that I was a very normal young girl, so\r\n    that this impression soon passed away. I was no longer excited\r\n    over conversations which I heard, but took a real interest in\r\n    them, and I was happy to have become acquainted with some one\r\n    who understood us young girls.\r\n\r\n    \"I am, therefore, a young girl whose sensations are neither cold\r\n    nor perverse, and I am always rejoiced, in reading your book, to\r\n    see with what truth you describe our sexual impressions. Those\r\n    who maintain that we feel in this way the same as men make me\r\n    smile. In your book (\"Hygiene of Marriage,\" p. 479) you say that\r\n    the idea of marriage awakens in a normal young girl a kind of\r\n    anguish and disgust, and that this feeling disappears as soon as\r\n    she has found some one whom she loves. This is extremely true\r\n    and well observed. I am in complete agreement with a friend with\r\n    whom I have often discussed your book; we young girls are very\r\n    little attracted by the purely sexual side of marriage, and we\r\n    should prefer to see children come into the world by some other\r\n    way than that ordained by Nature. This will, perhaps, make you\r\n    laugh. However, I think you will understand my feelings.\r\n\r\n    \"When I had finished reading your book I became absolutely\r\n    tranquil, and my ideas were enlightened. It goes without saying\r\n    that it is no longer possible for me to be ingenuous, but I\r\n    should like to know what one gains by such naivety. It is very\r\n    easy to be innocent when one knows nothing, and this is of no\r\n    account. I never thought for a moment to find your book immoral,\r\n    and that is why I do not think you have done me any harm. Excuse\r\n    me for having written at such length, but I could not abbreviate\r\n    when dealing with such a serious question.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of this letter has, at my request, authorized me to publish\r\nit anonymously. I think that the candor, the loyalty and the maturity\r\nof judgment of the sentiments expressed by this young girl are of much\r\nmore value and are much more healthy than all the prudishness and\r\nfalse shame of our conventional morality.\r\n\r\n                                                    DR.

QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nMy object is to study the sexual question under all its aspects:\r\nscientific, ethnological, pathological and social, and to seek the\r\nbest solution of the numerous problems connected with it.\r\nUnfortunately, in publications dealing with this subject, eroticism\r\nusually plays a considerable part, and it is difficult for an author\r\nto abstract himself from this, for it is reflected unconsciously in\r\nhis thoughts. As all sentiment, more or less, warps judgment, it is\r\nthe duty of scientific criticism to eliminate eroticism in order to be\r\nexact and impartial. We shall, therefore, do all that is possible to\r\nfree ourselves from it in the course of the present study.\r\n\r\nThe sexual question is of fundamental importance for humanity, whose\r\nhappiness and well-being depend largely on the best solution of this\r\nimportant problem. In dealing with such a delicate subject I shall\r\nendeavor to avoid narrow-mindedness and prejudice; I shall avoid\r\ntiresome quotations, and shall only employ technical terms when\r\nnecessary, as they rather interfere with the comprehension of the\r\nsubject. I shall take care to explain all those which appear to me\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nMy opinions on the sexual question are based, on the one hand, on my\r\nscientific study of the human brain, and on the other hand on the long\r\npersonal experience of an alienist who has devoted himself almost as\r\nmuch to normal mentality and questions of social hygiene as to\r\npathological mentality. I have, however, been obliged to rely on the\r\nfundamental work of _Westermark_ with regard to ethnology, this\r\nsubject being strange to me. Concerning sexual psycho-pathology I have\r\nfollowed the classification of _Krafft-Ebing_.\r\n\r\nThe sexual question is extraordinarily complex, and we cannot expect\r\nto find a simple solution for it as we can for the questions of\r\nalcoholism, slavery, torture, etc. The latter are solved in one\r\nword--suppression. Suppression of slavery and torture; suppression of\r\nthe usage of alcoholic drinks. We are concerned here with ulcers\r\nartificially produced and preserved in human society; ulcers which\r\nmust be simply extirpated. Their suppression is nothing but\r\nbeneficial, since, far from being connected with the normal conditions\r\nof human existence, they place it in peril. Sexual instinct and\r\nsentiment, on the contrary, have their roots in life itself; they are\r\nintimately bound up with humanity, and therefore require quite a\r\ndifferent treatment. But human society has guided them into false and\r\npernicious ways. It is important to turn them from these in order to\r\ntranquilize and regulate their course by damming them up and\r\ncanalizing them.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental axiom of the sexual question is as follows:\r\n\r\n_With man, as with all living beings, the constant object of all\r\nsexual function, and consequently of sexual love, is the reproduction\r\nof the species._ It is therefore necessary to treat the question from\r\nthe point of view of the natural sciences, physiology, psychology and\r\nsociology. This has already been done more than once, but usually in\r\nerudite treatises which only look upon one side of the question; or,\r\non the other hand, in a superficial and often frivolous manner.\r\n\r\nTo ensure happiness, humanity should desire to reproduce itself in a\r\nmanner which elevates progressively all the physical and mental\r\nfaculties of man, with regard to health and bodily strength, as much\r\nas to sentiment, intelligence, will, creative imagination, love of\r\nwork, joy of living, and the sentiment of social solidarity. Every\r\nattempt made to solve the sexual question should, therefore, be\r\ndirected toward the future and toward the happiness of our\r\ndescendants.\r\n\r\nIt requires much disinterestedness to attempt seriously any sexual\r\nreform. But, as the human subject is by nature extremely weak, as his\r\nviews are limited, especially in the matter which concerns us, it is\r\nabsolutely necessary, if we would avoid Utopia, to adapt the\r\nfundamental aim of sexual union to happiness and joy, even to the\r\nnatural weakness of man.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental difficulty of the problem lies in the necessity for\r\nsuch an adaptation, and this difficulty requires us to make a clean\r\nsweep of prejudices, traditions and prudery. It is this which we wish\r\nto attempt.\r\n\r\nConsidered from an exalted point of view, sexual life is beautiful as\r\nwell as good. What there is in it which is shameful and infamous is\r\nthe obscenity and ignominy caused by the coarse passions of egoism and\r\nfolly, allied with ignorance, erotic curiosity and mystic\r\nsuperstition, often combined with social narcotic intoxication and\r\ncerebral anomalies.\r\n\r\nWe shall divide our subject into nineteen chapters. Chapters I to VII\r\ndeal with the natural history and psychology of sexual life; Chapter\r\nVIII with its pathology, and Chapters IX to XVIII with its social\r\nrole, that is to say, its connection with the different domains of\r\nhuman social life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE REPRODUCTION OF LIVING BEINGS\r\n\r\n_History of the Germ:--Cell-division--Parthenogenesis--\r\n    Conjugation--Mneme--Embryological Development--Difference of\r\n    the Sexes--Castration--Hermaphrodism--Heredity--Blastophthoria._\r\n\r\n\r\nA general law of organic life decrees that every living individual is\r\ngradually transformed in the course of a cycle which is called\r\nindividual life, and which terminates with death, that is by the\r\ndestruction of the greater part of the organism. It then becomes inert\r\nmatter, and the germinative cells alone of all its parts continue its\r\nlife under certain conditions.\r\n\r\n=The Cells: Protoplasm. The Nucleus.=--Since the time of\r\n_Schwann_ (1830) it is agreed that the cell is the most simple\r\nmorphological element which is capable of living. Among the lower\r\norganisms this element constitutes the entire individual. There is no\r\ndoubt that the cell is already a thing of high organization. It is\r\nformed of infinitely small elements of very different value and\r\nchemical constitution, which form what is called _protoplasm_ or the\r\ncell-substance. But these infinitely small elements are so far\r\nabsolutely unknown. It is in them that must be sought the change from\r\ninanimate matter, that is the chemical molecule, to living matter, a\r\nchange which was formerly believed to lie in the protoplasm itself,\r\nbefore its complicated structure was known. We need not concern\r\nourselves here with this question which remains an open one.\r\n\r\nLife being established, the cell remains its only known constant\r\nelement. The cell is composed of protoplasm which contains a rounded\r\nnucleus formed of _nucleo-plasma_. The nucleus is the most important\r\npart of the cell, and governs its life.\r\n\r\n=Cell-division.=--The lowest unicellular organisms, as each cell of a\r\nmulticellular organism, reproduce themselves by division or\r\n_fission_. Each cell originates from another cell in the following\r\nmanner: the cell divides in the center as well as its nucleus, and in\r\nthis way forms two cells which grow by absorbing by _endosmosis_\r\n(filtration) the nutritive juices which surround them. Death or\r\ndestruction of the cell is therefore death of the entire organism when\r\nthis is unicellular. But it has been previously reproduced.\r\n\r\nWe find here already the special and fundamental act of conjugation,\r\nthat is the fusion of two cells into one, which serves to strengthen\r\nreproduction. This act, common to all living things including man,\r\nshows us that continuation of life is only possible when from time to\r\ntime different elements, that is elements which have been exposed to\r\ndifferent influences, combine together. If this conjugation is\r\nprevented and life is allowed to continue indefinitely by means of\r\nfission or by budding (_vide infra_), there results a progressive\r\nweakening and degeneration which leads to the disappearance of the\r\nwhole group thus reproduced.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to explain here the results of recent scientific work\r\non the intimate phenomena of cell-division, for they are closely\r\nallied to those of fecundation.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of an ordinary cell presents itself in the form of a\r\nnearly spherical vesicle. Delicate methods of staining have shown that\r\nthe nucleus encloses several round nucleolar corpuscles, and also a\r\nreticulum which is attached to its membrane and spreads through its\r\nwhole substance. The liquid part of the nucleus fills the meshes of\r\nthis reticular tissue, which stains easily and for this reason is\r\nnamed _chromatin_. The phenomena of cell division in well-developed\r\ncells with nuclei is termed _mitosis_. Certain lower forms of cells\r\nexist in which the nucleus is not well differentiated. Mitosis begins\r\nin the nucleus (Plate I). Figure 1 represents the cell before division\r\nhas commenced. In the protoplasm, by the side of the nucleus, is\r\nformed a small corpuscle (_c_) which is called the _centrosome_. The\r\nnucleus itself is marked _b_. When the cell commences to divide, the\r\nmeshes of the network of chromatin contract and the centrosome divides\r\ninto two parts (Fig. 2). Shortly afterward the particles of chromatin\r\nconcentrate in the form of convoluted rods called _chromosomes_\r\n(Figs. 3 and 4). The number of these varies according to the species\r\nof organism, but remains constant for each animal or vegetable\r\nspecies. At the same time the two centrosomes separate from each other\r\non each side of the nucleus. The chromosomes then become shorter and\r\nthicker while the nucleus is completely dissolved in the protoplasm of\r\nthe cell, and its membrane disappears (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\nDirectly afterwards the chromosomes arrange themselves regularly in\r\nline, like soldiers at drill, following one of the larger diameters of\r\nthe cell, and forming a barrier between the two centrosomes (Fig. 5).\r\nEach of the chromosomes then divides into two parallel halves of equal\r\nthickness (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\nFigures 3 and 4 show that, while these changes are being produced,\r\neach of the two centrosomes is surrounded by stellate rays. Some of\r\nthese rays extending in the direction of the chromosomes, become\r\nattached to one of their extremities and draw it toward the\r\ncorresponding centrosome (Fig. 7). Thus around each centrosome are\r\ngrouped as many chromosomes as the mother cell possessed itself (Fig.\r\n8). Simultaneously, the cell enlarges and its protoplasm commences to\r\nbecome indented at each end of the diameter previously formed by the\r\nchromosomes. From this moment the nuclear liquid concentrates itself\r\naround each of the groups of chromosomes, the rays disappear and the\r\ncell divides into two halves, each containing a group of chromosomes\r\n(Fig. 9); the indentation increases so as to form a partition across\r\nthe protoplasm. The chromosomes then form a new meshwork of nuclear\r\nchromatin, and we have then two cells each with a nucleus and a\r\ncentrosome like the mother cell (Fig. 10).\r\n\r\nThis is what takes place in the reproduction of all cells of the\r\nanimal and vegetable kingdoms. In the simplest unicellular organisms\r\nwhich are known fission constitutes the only means of reproduction. In\r\nthe complicated organisms of the higher plants and animals each cell\r\ndivides in the manner indicated above, both in the embryonic period\r\nand later on during the development of each of the organs which forms\r\nthe organism. This fact shows more than any other the intimate\r\nrelationship which connects all living organisms. The most remarkable\r\nthing, perhaps, is the almost mathematical division of the\r\nchromosomes into two halves, a division which results in the equal\r\ndistribution of their substance through the whole organism. We shall\r\nreturn to this point later on.\r\n\r\n=Reproduction by Budding. Parthenogenesis.= In the animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms the higher organisms become more and more\r\ncomplicated. They are no longer composed of a single cell, but of an\r\nincreasing number of these cells combined in a whole, of which each\r\npart, adapted for a special purpose, is itself formed of cells,\r\ndifferentiated as much by their organic form as by their chemical and\r\nphysical constitution. In this way, in plants, are formed the leaves,\r\nflowers, buds, branches, trunk, bark, etc.; and in animals the skin,\r\nintestine, glands, blood, muscles, nerves, brain, sense organs, etc.\r\nIn spite of the great complication of the divers living multicellular\r\norganisms, one often finds among them the power of reproduction by\r\nfission or by budding. In certain animals and plants, groups of cells\r\nvegetate in buds which separate from the body later on and form a new\r\nindividual; this occurs among the polypi and plants with bulbs, etc.\r\nOne can even form a tree by means of a cutting. Ants and bees, which\r\nhave not been fecundated, are capable of laying eggs which develop by\r\n_parthenogenesis_ (virgin parturition) and become complete\r\nindividuals. But these degenerate and disappear if reproduction by\r\nparthenogenesis or budding is continued during several generations.\r\n\r\nAmong the higher animals, the vertebrates and man, there is no\r\nreproduction without conjugation; no parthenogenesis or budding. So\r\nfar as we have studied the question we see in the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdoms sexual reproduction, or conjugation, as a _sine qua non_ for\r\nthe indefinite continuation of life.\r\n\r\n=The Sexual Glands. The Embryo.= However complicated the organism, it\r\nalways possesses a special organ, the cells of which, all of the same\r\nform, are reserved for the reproduction of the species and especially\r\nfor conjugation. The cells of these organs, called _sexual glands_,\r\nhave the power of reproducing themselves so that they reconstruct the\r\nwhole individual (the type of the species) from which they arose, in\r\nan almost identical form, by conjugation (sometimes also, for a\r\ncertain time, by parthenogenesis) under certain fixed conditions as\r\nsoon as they leave its body. We can thus say with _Weismann_, speaking\r\nphilosophically, that these germinal cells continue the life of their\r\nparents, so that in reality death only destroys part of the\r\nindividual, namely, that which has been specially adapted for certain\r\nexclusively individual ends. Each individual, therefore, continues to\r\nlive in his descendants.\r\n\r\nThe germinal cell divides into a number of cells called embryonic,\r\nwhich become differentiated into layers or groups which later on form\r\nthe different organs of the body. The embryonic period is the name\r\ngiven to the period between the exit of the germinal cell from the\r\nmaternal body and the final complete development which it acquires in\r\nbecoming the adult individual. During this period the organism\r\nundergoes the most singular metamorphoses. In certain cases it forms a\r\nfree embryo which appears to be complete, having a special form and\r\nmode of life, but which finally becomes transformed into an entirely\r\ndifferent sexual individual. Thus from the egg of a butterfly there\r\nfirst emerges a caterpillar, which lives and grows for some time, then\r\nchanges to a chrysalis and finally to a butterfly. The caterpillar and\r\nthe chrysalis belong to the embryonic period. During this period every\r\nanimal reproduces in an abbreviated manner certain forms which\r\nresemble more or less those through which its ancestors have passed.\r\nThe caterpillar, for example, resembles the worm which is the ancestor\r\nof the insects. _Haeckel_ calls this the _fundamental biogenetic law_.\r\nWe are not concerned here with embryology, and will content ourselves\r\nwith some of the main points.\r\n\r\n=Germinal Cells. Hermaphrodites.= We now come to _conjugation_. In\r\norder to avoid complications we will leave aside plants and speak only\r\nof animals. Among multicellular animals, sometimes in the same\r\nindividual, sometimes in different individuals, occur two kinds of\r\nsexual glands, each containing one kind of cells--the male cells and\r\nthe female cells. When both kinds of sexual glands occur in the same\r\nindividual, the animal is said to be _hermaphrodite_. When they\r\ndevelop in two different individuals the animals are of distinct\r\nsexes. Snails, for example, are hermaphrodite. There also exist lower\r\nmulticellular animals which reproduce by budding, but among which\r\nconjugation takes place from time to time. We shall not consider these\r\nanimals any further, as they are too remote to interest us here.\r\n\r\n=Spermatozoa and Ova.=--In all the higher animals, including the\r\nhermaphrodites, the male germinal cells, or _spermatozoa_ are\r\ncharacterized by their mobility. Their protoplasm is contractile and\r\ntheir form varies according to the species. In man and vertebrate\r\nanimals they resemble infinitely small tadpoles, and their tails are\r\nequally mobile. The female germinative cell, on the contrary, is\r\nimmobile and much larger than the male cell. Conjugation consists in\r\nthe movement of the male cell, by means of variable mechanism, toward\r\nthe female cell, or egg, into the protoplasm of which it enters. At\r\nthis moment it produces on the surface of the egg a coagulation, which\r\nprevents the entrance of a second spermatozoid.\r\n\r\nThe egg and the spermatozoid both consist of protoplasm containing a\r\nnucleus. But, while the spermatozoid has only a small nucleus and very\r\nlittle protoplasm, the egg has a large nucleus and a large quantity of\r\nprotoplasm. In certain species the protoplasm of the egg grows in the\r\nmaternal organism in a regular manner to form the _vitellus_ (yolk of\r\negg) which serves as nourishment for the embryo for a long period of\r\nits existence. This occurs in birds and reptiles.\r\n\r\n=Conjugation.=--The phenomena of conjugation were made clear by _van\r\nBeneden_ and _Hertwig_. These phenomena, as we have seen, commence\r\namong unicellular organisms. In these they do not constitute\r\nreproduction, but the vital reënforcement of certain individuals.\r\nConjugation takes place in a different manner in different cases.\r\n\r\nFor example, a unicellular animal applies itself against one of its\r\nfellows. The nucleus of each cell divides into two. Then the\r\nprotoplasm of the two cells fuses over the whole surface of contact,\r\nand half the nucleus of the first cell penetrates the second cell,\r\nwhile half the nucleus of the latter enters the first cell. After this\r\nexchange the cells separate from each other and each exchanged half of\r\nthe nucleus fuses with the primitive half of the nucleus remaining in\r\nthe cell.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment each cell continues to reproduce itself by fission,\r\nas we have seen above. In another form, two cells meet and fuse\r\ncompletely. Their nuclei become applied against each other and each\r\nexchanges half its substance with the other as in the preceding case,\r\nso that the final result is the same. In both cases the two conjugated\r\ncells are identical, and one cannot call them male and female.\r\n\r\n=Penetration of the Spermatozoid into the Egg.=--In all the higher\r\nanimals in which the germinal cells are of two kinds, male and female,\r\nconjugation takes place in rather a different manner. Here, the female\r\ncell or egg only reproduces itself exceptionally by parthenogenesis.\r\nIt usually contains no chromosomes and often too little chromatin, so\r\nthat it perishes when conjugation does not occur.\r\n\r\nThe spermatozoid swims by means of its tail to meet the egg. As soon\r\nas it touches it it penetrates it and the coagulation which we have\r\nmentioned is produced. This coagulation forms the _vitelline\r\nmembrane_, which prevents the entry of other spermatozoids. If, from\r\npathological causes the entry of several spermatozoids takes place,\r\nthere results, according to _Fol_, a double or triple monster.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 11 on Plate II, we see the egg with its vitelline membrane and\r\nnucleus, the chromatin network of which is marked in blue: _b_ shows\r\nthe protoplasm of the egg or _vitellus_; _a_ the vitelline membrane;\r\n_d_ the spermatozoid which has just entered, and the nucleus of which,\r\ncomposed chiefly of chromatin, is colored red, while its tail has\r\nperformed its task and is about to disappear. The letters _e_, _f_,\r\nand _g_, show a spermatozoid which has arrived too late.\r\n\r\nBefore the head of the spermatozoid which has entered, appears a\r\ncentrosome (Fig. 12) which it brings to the egg with its small amount\r\nof protoplasm, and around this centrosome rays form, as in the case of\r\ncellular fission. At the same time a nuclear liquid arising from the\r\nprotoplasm of the egg becomes concentrated around the chromatin of the\r\nspermatozoid, while the nucleus of the egg remains in place and does\r\nnot change. The nucleus of the spermatozoid, on the contrary, begins\r\nto grow rapidly. It forms half the number of chromosomes\r\ncorresponding to the cell of the species to which it belongs, and\r\ngrows at the expense of the vitellus of the egg. During this time the\r\ncentrosome divides into two halves, which progress slowly on each side\r\ntoward the periphery of the egg, as in the case of fission (see Plate\r\nI), while the chromatin of the chromosomes of the spermatozoid is\r\ndissolved in the network. The nucleus thus formed by the spermatozoid\r\nenlarges more and more (Figs. 13 and 14) till it attains the size and\r\nshape of that of the egg (Fig. 15). The male and female chromatin are\r\ncolored red and blue respectively.\r\n\r\nThen only commences activity of the nucleus of the egg, at the same\r\ntime as fresh activity on the part of the nucleus of the spermatozoid.\r\nBefore this, however, the nucleus of the egg has thrown off a part of\r\nits chromatin called a _polar_ body, and it now possesses only half as\r\nmuch chromatin as the other cells of the body of the individual. The\r\nnucleus of the egg and that of the spermatozoid then begin at the same\r\ntime to concentrate their chromatin in the form of chromosomes (Fig.\r\n16) which arrange themselves regularly in the middle line exactly as\r\nshown in Plate I, and divide longitudinally into two halves which are\r\nthen attracted in opposite directions by the rays of each of the\r\ncentrosomes (Fig. 17). Figure 17, of Plate II, thus corresponds\r\nexactly to Fig. 6, of Plate I.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the growth of the nucleus of the spermatozoid has given to\r\nits substance the same power of development as to that of the nucleus\r\nof the egg. Both enter into conjugation in equal parts, which\r\nsymbolizes the social equality and the rights of the two sexes!\r\n\r\nThe signification of these facts is as follows: as soon as, in the\r\ncourse of development, the conjugated nuclei divide again into two\r\ncells, as in Figs. 7 to 10, of Plate I, each of these two cells\r\ncontains almost the same quantity of paternal as maternal chromatin.\r\nWe do not say exactly as much, for the paternal and maternal\r\ninfluences are not divided equally in the descendants. This phenomenon\r\nmay be explained by what _Semon_ calls alternating ecphoria in mnemic\r\ndichotomy. (_Vide infra._) As cell division continues in the same way\r\nduring embryonic life, it follows that each cell, or at least each\r\nnucleus of the future organism, will contain on the average half its\r\nsubstance and energy from the paternal and half from the maternal\r\nside.\r\n\r\n=Heredity. The Mneme.=--The secret of heredity lies in the phenomena\r\nwhich have been just described. Hereditary influence preserves all its\r\nprimary power and original qualities in the chromosomes, which enlarge\r\nand divide, while the vitelline substance, absorbed by the chromosomes\r\nand transformed by the vital chemical processes into the specific\r\nsubstance of the chromosomes, loses its specific and plastic vital\r\nenergy, as completely as the food which we swallow loses its energy in\r\nforming the structure of our living organs. We do not acquire any of\r\nthe characters of the ox by eating beefsteaks; and the spermatozoid,\r\nafter eating much vitelline protoplasm, preserves its own hereditary\r\nenergies, increased and fortified, but without change in their\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nIn this way the nuclear chromatin of our germinal cells becomes the\r\ncarrier of all the hereditary qualities of the species (hereditary\r\nmneme), and more especially those of our direct ancestors. The\r\nuniformity of the intracellular phenomena in cell division and\r\nconjugation proves, however, that, without being capable of\r\nreproducing the individual, the other non-germinal cells of the body\r\nmay also possess these hereditary energies, and that there exists,\r\nhidden behind all these facts, an unknown law of life, the explanation\r\nof which is reserved for the future.\r\n\r\nHowever, a recent work based on an idea of the physiologist, _E.\r\nHering_, which looks upon instinct as a kind of memory of the species,\r\nopens up a new horizon. I refer to the book of _Richard Semon_: \"The\r\n_mneme_ considered as the conservative principle in the transmutations\r\nof organic life.\" (_Die Mneme als erhaltendes Prinzip im Wechsel des\r\norganischen Geschehens_, Leipzig, 1904.)\r\n\r\n_Conception of Irritation._[1]--By the aid of the fundamental facts of\r\nmorphological science, biological and psychological, _Semon_ proves\r\nthat _Hering's_ idea is more than an analogy, and that there is a\r\nfundamental identity in the mechanism of organic life. In order to\r\navoid the terminology of psychology which tends to be equivocal,\r\n_Semon_ employs some new terms to designate his new ideas, based on\r\nthe fundamental conception of _irritation_ in its physiological sense.\r\n\r\n_Semon_ defines _irritation_ as an energetic action on the organism\r\nwhich determines a series of complicated changes in the irritable\r\nsubstance of the living organism. The condition of the organism thus\r\nmodified, which lasts as long as the irritation, is called by _Semon_\r\nthe _state of irritation_. Before the action of irritation, the\r\norganism is in a condition which _Semon_ calls the _primary state of\r\nindifference_, and after its action, in the _secondary state of\r\nindifference_.\r\n\r\n_Engram. Ecphoria._--If, when an irritation has entirely ceased, the\r\nirritable substance of the living organism becomes modified\r\npermanently during its secondary state of indifference, _Semon_ calls\r\nthe action _engraphic_. To the modification itself he gives the word\r\n_engram_. The sum of the hereditary and individual engrams thus\r\nproduced in a living organism is designated by the term _mneme_.\r\n_Semon_ gives the name _ecphoria_ to the revival of the engram by the\r\nrepetition of part only of the original irritation, or by the entire\r\nbut weakened reproduction of the whole state of irritation of the\r\norganism, which was originally produced in a synchronous manner with\r\nthe primary irritation.\r\n\r\nThus, an engram may be ecphoriated (that is to say, reproduced or\r\nrevived) by the return of one part of the complex of primary\r\nirritations which produced it. A young dog, for example, is attacked\r\nby urchins who throw stones at it. It experiences two kinds of\r\nirritation: (1) the urchins stooping down and throwing stones (optic\r\nirritation); (2) the pain caused by the stones (tactile irritation).\r\n\r\nIn its brain are produced two associated series of corresponding\r\nengrams. Previously, this dog did not react when it saw people stoop\r\ndown. From this moment it will run away and howl at the sight, without\r\nany stone being thrown at it. Thus the tactile engram will be\r\necphoriated by the repetition of the original associated irritation.\r\nIn the same way, the image of a tree in a known landscape will\r\necphoriate the entire landscape.\r\n\r\nMoreover, an engram may be revived by the enfeebled return of the\r\nprimary irritating agent which produced it, or by an analogous\r\nenfeebled irritation. Thus, the sight of a photograph will revive the\r\nimage of a known person. A certain kind of maize imported for a long\r\ntime into Norway and influenced in that country during many\r\ngenerations by the sun of the long summer days, finally accelerated\r\nits time of maturation. When imported again to the south of Europe it\r\nfirst preserved its faculty of accelerated maturation in spite of the\r\nshortness of the days (_Schübeler_). _Semon_ gives a series of\r\nanalogous examples which show how engrams repeated during several\r\ngenerations accumulate and end by becoming ecphoriated when they have\r\nacquired enough power.\r\n\r\nEngrams may be associated simultaneously in space, such as those of\r\nsight. But they may also be associated in succession, such as those of\r\nhearing and of ontogeny. Simultaneous engrams are associated in every\r\ndirection with the same intensity. Successive engrams, on the\r\ncontrary, are associated more strongly forwards than backwards, and\r\nhave only two poles. In the succession _a b_, _a_ acts more strongly\r\non _b_ than _b_ on _a_. In the successions of engrams it often happens\r\nthat two or more analogous engrams are associated in a manner more or\r\nless equivalent to a preceding engram. _Semon_ calls this phenomenon\r\ndichotomy, trichotomy, etc. But in the successions, two engrams cannot\r\nbe ecphoriated simultaneously. Hence the phenomenon which _Semon_\r\nnames _alternating ecphoria_; that is sometimes one, sometimes the\r\nother of the constituent engrams, for example, of a dichotomy, which\r\narrives at ecphoria. Similarly, the engram of the ecphoriated\r\ndichotomy is most often that which has been previously most often\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nIn the laws of ontogeny and heredity alternating ecphoria plays an\r\nimportant part. The branch less often repeated remains latent and the\r\nother only is ecphoriated. But certain combinations which reënforce\r\nthe latent branch or paralyze the other may induce ecphoria of the\r\nfirst to the second generation.\r\n\r\n_Semon_ also shows that the phenomena of regeneration in the embryo,\r\nas well as those of the adult, obey the law of the mneme.\r\n\r\n_Homophony._--The terms engram and ecphoria correspond to the\r\nwell-known introspective phenomena in psychology of memory and the\r\nassociation of ideas. Engrams are thus ecphoriated. At the time of\r\nsuch phenomena every mnemic irritation of the engrams vibrates\r\nsimultaneously with the state of synchronous irritation produced by a\r\nnew irritation. This simultaneous irritation is named by _Semon_\r\n_homophony_. When a partial discord is produced between the new\r\nirritation and the mnemic irritation, the organism always tends to\r\nreëstablish homophony (harmony). This is seen in psychological\r\nintrospection by activity of attention; in embryology by the\r\nphenomenon of regeneration; and in phylogeny by that of adaptation.\r\n\r\nRelying on these convincing facts, _Semon_ shows that irritative\r\nactions are only localized at first in their zone of entry (primary\r\nzone); but that afterward they irradiate or vibrate, gradually\r\nbecoming weaker in the whole organism (not only in the nervous system,\r\nfor they also act on plants). By this means, engraphia, although\r\ninfinitely enfeebled, may finally reach the germinal cells. _Semon_\r\nthen shows how the most feeble engraphias may gradually arrive at\r\necphoria, as the result of numerous repetitions (in phylogeny after\r\ninnumerable generations). This is how the mnemic principle allows us\r\nto conceive the possibility of an infinitely slow heredity of\r\ncharacters acquired by individuals, a heredity resulting from\r\nprolonged repetition.\r\n\r\nThe facts invoked by _Weismann_ against the heredity of acquired\r\ncharacters lose nothing of their weight by this, for the influence of\r\ncrossing (conjugation) and selection transforms the material organic\r\nforms in an infinitely more rapid and intense manner than individual\r\nmnemic engraphias. The latter, on the other hand, furnish the\r\nexplanation of the mutations of _de Vries_, which appear to be only\r\nsudden ecphoria of accumulated long engraphic actions.\r\n\r\nThe way in which _Semon_ studies and discusses the laws of the mneme\r\nin morphology, physiology and psychology, is truly magisterial, and\r\nthe perspective which opens out from these new ideas is extensive. The\r\nmneme, with the aid of the energetic action of the external world,\r\nacts on organisms by preserving them and combining them by engraphia,\r\nwhile selection eliminates all that is ill-adapted, and homophony\r\nreëstablishes the equilibrium. The irritations of the external world,\r\ntherefore, furnish the material for the construction of organisms. I\r\nconfess to having been converted by _Semon_ to this way of conceiving\r\nthe heredity of acquired characters. Instead of several nebulous\r\nhypotheses, we have only one--the nature of mnemic engraphia. It is\r\nfor the future to discover its origin in physical and chemical laws.\r\n\r\nI must refer my readers to _Semon's_ book, for this volume of 343\r\npages, filled with facts and proofs, cannot be condensed into a few\r\nparagraphs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Each Cell bears in itself Ancestral Energy.= As we have already seen,\r\nthe germinal, cells are not the only ones which possess the energies\r\nof all the characters of the species. On the contrary it becomes more\r\nand more certain, from further investigation, that each cell of the\r\nbody bears in itself, so to speak, all the energies of the species, as\r\nis distinctly seen in plants. But in all the cells which are not\r\ncapable of germinating, these energies remain incapable of\r\ndevelopment. It results that such energies, remaining virtual, have no\r\npractical importance.\r\n\r\nIn an analogous sense we may say that all the cells of the body are\r\nhermaphrodite, as all germinal cells, for each possesses in itself the\r\nundifferentiated energies of each sex. Each spermatozoid contains all\r\nthe energies of the paternal and maternal ancestry of man, and each\r\negg those of the paternal and maternal ancestry of woman. The male and\r\nthe female are only the bearers of each kind of germinal cells\r\nnecessary for conjugation, and each of these bearers only differs from\r\nthe others by its sexual cells and by what is called correlative\r\nsexual differences. But we must not forget that the germinal cells\r\nthemselves are only differentiated at a certain period in the\r\ndevelopment of the embryo; they are thus hermaphrodite originally and\r\nonly become male and female later.\r\n\r\nNew experiments made on the eggs of sea urchins and other organisms\r\nhave shown that conjugation may be replaced by an external irritating\r\nagent; for example, the action of certain chemical substances is\r\nsufficient to make eggs develop by parthenogenesis which would have\r\ndied without this action. An entire being has been successfully\r\nproduced from an egg divided into two by means of a hair. And even\r\nfrom the protoplasm of the egg without its nucleus, with the aid of a\r\nspermatozoid. We must not, however, base premature hypotheses on these\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nWhen a female cell, or egg, develops without fecundation\r\n(parthenogenesis) its nucleus enlarges and divides in the same manner\r\nas conjugated nuclei (mitosis).\r\n\r\nA point of general interest is what is called the _specific\r\npolyembryony_ of certain parasitic insects (hymenoptera of the genus\r\n_Encyrtus_). According to _Marchal_, their eggs grow and divide into a\r\nconsiderable number of secondary eggs, each of which gives rise to an\r\nembryo and later on a perfect insect. By shaking the eggs of certain\r\nmarine animals they have been caused to divide into several eggs\r\nand thus to produce several embryos. All the individuals arising from\r\nthe division of the same egg of _Encyrtus_ are of the same sex.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PLATE I\r\n\r\n   CELL DIVISION\r\n\r\n   FIG. 1.

This is the object of the science of embryology.\r\nWe shall return to this in Chapter III. A few words are necessary,\r\nhowever, to explain the general principles.\r\n\r\n=Ovulation. The corpus luteum.=--The ovaries of woman (Fig. 18)\r\ncontain a considerable number of cells or ovules, although infinitely\r\nless than the number of spermatozoids contained in the testicles. From\r\ntime to time some of these ovules enlarge and are surrounded by a\r\nvesicle with liquid contents, which is called the Graafian follicle.\r\nAt the time of the monthly periods an egg (sometimes two) is\r\ndischarged from its Graafian follicle, from one or other ovary. This\r\nphenomenon is called _ovulation_. The empty follicle becomes\r\ncicatrized in the ovary and is called the _corpus luteum_ (yellow\r\nbody).\r\n\r\nThe egg after its discharge arrives at the abdominal orifice of the\r\nFallopian tube, which communicates directly with the abdominal cavity.\r\nSome authors state that the end of the tube becomes applied against\r\nthe ovary by the aid of muscular movement and, so to speak, sucks in\r\nthe discharged ovule, while others hold that the movements of the\r\nvibratile cilia, with which the epithelium of the tubes is furnished,\r\nsuffice to draw the ovule into its cavity. Figure 18 explains this\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived in the tube, the ovule moves very slowly in the almost\r\ncapillary tube by means of the vibratile cilia and arrives in the\r\ncavity of the womb. Fecundation probably takes place most often at the\r\nentrance to the tube or in its canal; sometimes possibly in the womb.\r\nOn some occasions a squad of spermatozoids advances to meet the\r\ndescending egg, and numerous spermatozoids are often found in the\r\ntubes, even as far as the abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\n=Fixation of the egg. Formation of the Decidua.=--After fecundation,\r\nthe egg becomes attached to the mucous membrane of the cavity of the\r\nwomb. This mucous membrane proliferates and becomes gradually detached\r\nfrom the womb to form the _membrana decidua_ which envelops the egg\r\nor ovule. An egg fecundated and fixed in this way may keep its\r\nposition and grow during the first weeks of pregnancy, by the aid of\r\nvillosities covering its envelope which penetrate the wall of the\r\nwomb.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 18. Diagrammatic section in median plane of\r\n   the female genital organs. It shows the position of an ovule\r\n   which has just been discharged lying in the opening of the right\r\n   tube, and that of another ovary fecundated and surrounded by the\r\n   decidual membrane. In reality this could hardly coexist with the\r\n   other ovule freely discharged. In the right ovary are seen ovules\r\n   in various degrees of maturity in their Graafian follicles: also\r\n   a corpus luteum--an empty Graafian follicle after expulsion of\r\n   the ovule. The figure also shows the end of the penis in the\r\n   vagina at the moment of ejaculation of semen, and the position of\r\n   a preventive to avoid fecundation.]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 19. The mouth of the tube applied to the\r\n   ovary at the moment of expulsion of the ovule.]\r\n\r\n=The womb. The placenta.= The womb or uterus is the size of a small\r\negg flattened in one direction. It terminates below in the neck or\r\n_cervix_, which is prolonged into the vagina as a projection, called\r\nthe vaginal portion of the uterus. The cavity of the womb is continued\r\ninto the neck and opens below in the vagina by an aperture which is\r\nround in virgins and is called the external _os uteri_. The walls of\r\nthe womb consist of a thick layer of unstriped muscle. When childbirth\r\ntakes place it causes tearing which makes the external os uteri\r\nirregular and fissured. During copulation the aperture of the penis or\r\nmale organ is placed nearly opposite the os uteri, which facilitates\r\nthe entrance of spermatozoa into the uterus. (For the illustration of\r\nthese points see Fig. 18.)\r\n\r\nThe vitellus and the membrane of the egg enlarge with the embryo and\r\nabsorb by endosmosis the nutritive matter necessary for the latter,\r\ncontained in the maternal blood. The womb itself enlarges at the same\r\ntime as the embryo.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 20. Human egg of the second week: magnified\r\n   eight times. (After _Kölliker_.)\r\n      _Chor._ Chorion or envelope of the egg.\r\n      _Vill._ Villi of the chorion.\r\n      _Emb._  Embryo (near the head are seen the branchial arches).\r\n      _Umb._  Umbilical vesicle.\r\n      _Am._   Amnion.]\r\n\r\nThe fasciculus attached to the embryo is the allantois which becomes\r\nthe umbilical cord. The vertebræ are already easy to recognize in this\r\nembryo. The embryo is formed from a portion of blastoderm, that is to\r\nsay, from the cellular layer applied to the membranes of the egg and\r\narising from the successive divisions of the two primary conjugated\r\ncells and their daughter cells. The embryo has the form of a spatula\r\nwith the head at one end and the tail at the other. From its walls is\r\ndetached a surrounding vesicle (Fig. 20) called the _amnion_, while\r\nanother vesicle, the _umbilical vesicle_, grows from its ventral\r\nsurface and serves, in birds, for the vitelline circulation of the egg\r\nwhich is detached from the mother's body.\r\n\r\nIn man, the umbilical vesicle is unimportant. In its place the\r\ncirculation of the blood takes place by the aid of another vesicle,\r\ncalled the _allantois_, which arises from the intestine of the embryo,\r\nand which becomes attached to the walls of the womb in the form of a\r\nthick disk called the placenta.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 21. Embryo of four weeks (After _Kölliker_).\r\n      1. Auditory vesicle.\r\n      2. Ocular vesicle.\r\n      3. Olfactory fossa.\r\n      4. Bud forming upper maxilla.\r\n      5.

Caudal extremity.]\r\n\r\nThe placenta is formed of dilated blood vessels which meet the\r\nmaternal blood vessels, also dilated, in the uterine wall, allantois\r\nlater on becomes the umbilical cord.\r\n\r\nIn the placenta the embryonic and maternal vessels without actually\r\ncommunicating, are placed in intimate contact, which allows nutritive\r\nmatter and oxygen to pass by endosmosis from the maternal vessels to\r\nthose of the embryo. Figure 21 shows a human embryo at the beginning\r\nof the fifth week of pregnancy.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 22. Sagittal section of a primipara in the\r\n   last month of pregnancy.]\r\n\r\n=Duration of pregnancy. Birth.= Pregnancy lasts from conjugation,\r\nwhich is synonymous with conception, till birth, that is about nine\r\nmonths (ten lunar months of four weeks). The embryo is then ready to\r\nseparate from the maternal body (Fig. 22). By the act of birth it is\r\nexpelled violently, bringing with it the umbilical cord and the\r\nplacenta (Fig. 23). Immediately afterward the empty womb contracts\r\nstrongly and gradually recovers its former size. The sudden\r\ninterruption of its communications with the maternal circulation\r\ndeprives the embryo, which has suddenly become a child, of its\r\nnutritive matter and oxygen.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 23. Sagittal section of frozen body of a\r\n   woman in labor: the head of the child is engaged in the neck of\r\n   the womb; the orifice of the neck of the womb (_os uteri_) is\r\n   already fully dilated and the bag of waters commences to project\r\n   from the vulva: it is formed by the former membranes of the egg\r\n   and the decidua.]\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid suffocation it is obliged to breathe atmospheric air\r\nimmediately, for its blood becomes dark by saturation with carbonic\r\nacid, which irritates the respiratory nerve centers. The first\r\nindependent act of the new-born child is, therefore, a nervous reflex\r\ndetermined by asphyxia, and is performed with the first cry. Soon\r\nafterward the infant begins to suck, so as not to die of hunger, while\r\nthe umbilical cord, having become useless, shrivels up, and the\r\nplacenta is destroyed (some animals eat it). The new-born infant is\r\nonly distinguished from the embryo soon after birth by its breathing\r\nand crying.\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, say that infancy, especially early infancy, is only\r\na continuation of embryonic life. The transformations which the infant\r\nundergoes from birth to adult age are known to all. They take place\r\nmore and more slowly, except at the relatively short period of\r\npuberty.\r\n\r\n=Formation of the sexual glands.=--We must remember that at a very\r\nearly embryonic period certain groups of cells are reserved to form\r\nlater on the sexual glands. These cells are at first neither male nor\r\nfemale, but are undifferentiated; later on they become differentiated\r\nto form in certain individuals, called males, the testicles with their\r\nspermatozoa, and in others, called females, the ovaries with their\r\neggs. On this differentiation depends the sex of the individual, and,\r\naccording as it takes place in one way or the other, all the rest of\r\nthe body develops with the correlative sexual characters of the\r\ncorresponding sex (at first the external genital organs peculiar to\r\neach sex, then the beard in man, the breasts in woman, etc).\r\n\r\n=Castration. Correlative sexual characters.=--Castration is the term\r\napplied to the extirpation of the sexual glands. When it takes place\r\nin infancy it causes a considerable change in the whole subsequent\r\ndevelopment of the body, especially in man, but also in woman. Man\r\nbecomes more slender, preserves a high and infantile voice, and his\r\nsexual correlative characters develop incompletely or not at all.\r\n_Eunuchs_ are men castrated, usually in infancy. To ensure more safety\r\nin their harems the Orientals not only remove the testicles but also\r\nthe penis. Bullocks and horses are bulls and stallions castrated at an\r\nearly age, and can be distinguished at first sight from normal males.\r\nFemales who have undergone castration become fat and sometimes take on\r\ncertain masculine characters. Male human eunuchs have a high-pitched\r\nvoice, a narrow chest; they remain beardless or nearly so, and have an\r\neffeminate character, often intriguing. In both sexes there is a\r\ntendency to neurosis and degeneration. It is a mistake to qualify the\r\npeculiarities of the male eunuch in the terms of female peculiarities;\r\nthere is only a relative tendency. The eunuch is no more a woman than\r\na bullock is a cow.\r\n\r\nThe characters of castrated individuals are due only to ablation of\r\nthe sexual glands themselves--the testicles in man and the ovary in\r\nwoman; mutilation of other sexual organs, internal or external, such\r\nas the penis, womb, etc., produces no result of this kind. It would\r\neven appear to result from recent experiments that reimplantation of a\r\nsexual gland in any part of the body is sufficient to arrest the\r\nproduction of the special peculiarities of the eunuch.\r\n\r\nAll these facts, almost inexplicable hitherto, become comprehensible\r\nby the aid of the engraphia of the mnemic energies. (Vide above;\r\n_Semon_). The sexual glands, being of undifferentiated origin, contain\r\nthe energies of both sexes. The ecphoria of one of them provokes that\r\nof its correlative characters and excludes that of the characters of\r\nthe other. If ecphoria of the sexual glands is arrested by castration\r\nbefore it is finished, this paralyzes the predominance of that of its\r\ncorresponding correlative characters and reëstablishes a kind of\r\nintermediate or undifferentiated equilibrium between the ecphorias of\r\nthe correlative hereditary sexual characters of the two sexes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the sexual glands of an adult are removed, his\r\nbody is not sensibly modified. The sexual functions do not cease\r\ncompletely, although they cannot lead to fecundation. Men castrated in\r\nadult age may cohabit with their wives; but the liquid ejaculated is\r\nnot semen but only secretion from the accessory prostatic gland. Adult\r\nwomen after castration preserve their sexual appetite, and sometimes\r\neven their menstruation, for a certain time. They generally become fat\r\nand often suffer from nervous troubles and change in character. The\r\necphoria of the correlative sexual characters being complete in the\r\nadult, suppression of the sexual glands can only act on their direct\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nIn different species of animals, the correlative sexual characters of\r\nwhich we have spoken vary enormously; sometimes the differences are\r\ninsignificant, at other times they are considerable; while we can\r\nhardly distinguish a male swallow from a female, the cock and hen, the\r\npeacock and peahen, the stag and hind are very different from each\r\nother. In man, the correlative sexual characters are very distinct,\r\neven externally. These characters may extend to all parts of the\r\nbody, even to the brain and mental faculties.\r\n\r\nIn some of the lower animals, for example the ants, the sexes differ\r\nremarkably from each other and appear to belong to different\r\nzoölogical families. The eyes, the form of the head, the color, and\r\nthe whole body differ so much that, when a case of pathological\r\nlateral hermaphrodism is produced (that is, when the sexual glands are\r\nmale on the one side and female on the other), we can exactly\r\ndetermine the male or female character on each portion of the body. We\r\nthus see hermaphrodite ants with one half of the body male and the\r\nother half female--black on one side and red on the other, a large eye\r\non one side and a small eye on the other, thirteen joints in one\r\nantenna and twelve in the other, and so on. In this case the mental\r\nfaculties are sometimes female, sometimes male, according as the\r\necphoria of the brain is influenced by the hereditary mneme of the\r\nmale or female part of the hermaphrodite sexual organs, which results\r\nin a male or female brain. I have seen hermaphrodite ants in which two\r\nparts of the thorax formed a crossed hermaphrodism; in front, male on\r\nthe right and female on the left, behind female on the right and male\r\non the left. Further; among ants which live in societies, the\r\nprogressive transformation of the species, or phylogeny, has produced\r\na third sex derived from the female sex--the worker; sometimes there\r\nis even a fourth--the warrior. In these two forms the wings are\r\nabsent, but the head and brain are much larger; the sexual organs\r\nremain female, but are very small. While the large brain (pedunculated\r\nbodies of the supra-esophageal ganglion) is almost rudimentary in the\r\nmale, it is well developed in the female and very large in the worker\r\nand the warrior. Among these singular animals exist pathological\r\nhermaphrodites, not only between males and females, but between males\r\nand workers, and not only lateral but mixed and crossed in all\r\npossible ways. I have seen a hermaphrodite, whose abdomen and sexual\r\norgans were almost entirely male, accomplish all the complex\r\ninstinctive actions of a worker of his species (expeditions, attacks\r\non a hostile ant heap, abduction of chrysalids), thanks to its head\r\nand brain which were of the worker type. The female itself is\r\nincapable of such complex actions. I cite these facts here as material\r\nfor study, for we are only too prone in this domain to generalize\r\nprematurely and to draw too hasty conclusions. In reality, there is\r\nstill a wide field for study of the greatest interest.\r\n\r\nThere are animals which are normally and physiologically\r\nhermaphrodite, for they possess in the normal state male and female\r\nsexual glands and fecundate themselves, such as the solitary worms, or\r\nin pairs such as the snails. In the latter case there is copulation,\r\nduring which each animal plays the parts of both male and female.\r\n\r\nIn man and other vertebrates, hermaphrodism is always abnormal. In man\r\nit is extremely rare and nearly always very incomplete, being usually\r\nlimited to the external or correlative characters.\r\n\r\n=Heredity.=--It results from what we have said that every living being\r\nreproduces, more or less identically, in its specific characters, the\r\nwhole life of its parents and less remote ancestors, and constitutes\r\nthe continuation of life from a minute part of their bodies.\r\n\r\nEach individual life thus repeats an entire cycle of development\r\ncalled _ontogeny_, which is peculiar to all individuals of the\r\nspecies. Here we must mention three fundamental points:\r\n\r\n(1). In its principal characters, each individual is the copy of its\r\nparents or direct ancestors, with correlative sexual peculiarities\r\nwhich we have mentioned, and with individual variations due to the\r\ncombinations of varieties by conjugation, and the alternating or\r\nunequal ecphorias of hereditary characters; that is to say paternal or\r\nmaternal hereditary engrams.\r\n\r\n(2). No individual is absolutely identical with another.\r\n\r\n(3). On the average, each individual resembles more especially its\r\ndirect ancestry and its parents, and differs more markedly from its\r\nparentage the more this is remote.\r\n\r\nWe shall see later on that the ancestral relationship of the different\r\ngroups, species and varieties of animals has been fairly well fixed,\r\nand we may say that the third of the laws stated above is equally true\r\nin a wider sense. In fact the species and varieties of animals which\r\nare near related resemble each other, while the _genera_, families\r\nand classes are more dissimilar as their relationship is more remote.\r\nWe employ here the terms resemblance, homology and difference in their\r\nprofound and general sense. Certain purely external resemblances, due\r\nto phenomena of convergence, must not be considered as homologies in\r\nthe sense of hereditary relationship. Thus, in the language of natural\r\nhistory we do not say that a bat resembles a bird, nor that a whale\r\nresembles a fish, for here the resemblances are due simply to aërial\r\nor aquatic life which produces the effects of convergence, while the\r\ninternal structure shows them to be quite dissimilar organisms.\r\nAlthough it swims in the sea the whale is a mammal; its fins at first\r\nsight resemble those of a fish, but they are really the homologues of\r\nthe four limbs of other mammals and contain the corresponding bones.\r\n\r\nIn man, we see that brothers and sisters resemble each other in a\r\ngeneral way, but that each one is dissimilar in some respects from the\r\nothers. If we compare different families with many children we find\r\nthat brothers and sisters resemble each other the more their parents\r\nare alike and come from a uniform ancestry which has undergone little\r\ncrossing, while the crossing of different races and human varieties\r\nresults in the production of individuals which differ from each other\r\nconsiderably, even when they come from the same couple.\r\n\r\nIf we examine things more closely, we find that the characters of each\r\nof the offspring of the same couple present neither simple repetition\r\nnor an equal mixture of the peculiarities of the parents, but very\r\ndiverse combinations of the characters of several ancestors. For\r\ninstance, children may bear a striking resemblance to a paternal\r\ngrandfather, a maternal grand-aunt, or a maternal great-grandmother,\r\netc. This is called _atavism_. Some children resemble their father,\r\nothers their mother, and others a kind of mixture of father and\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nA closer examination reveals further very curious facts. An infant\r\nwhich, in its early years, strongly resembles its father, may later on\r\nresemble its mother, or inversely. Certain peculiarities of a certain\r\nancestor appear suddenly, often at an advanced age. It is needless to\r\nsay that peculiarities concerning the beard cannot appear till this\r\nhas grown, and this simple fact is so characteristic that it has been\r\ncalled _hereditary disposition_. Everything may be transmitted by\r\nheredity, even to the finest shades of sentiment, intelligence and\r\nwill, even to the most insignificant details of the nails, the form of\r\nthe bones, etc. But the combinations of ancestral qualities vary so\r\ninfinitely that it is extremely difficult to recognize them.\r\nHereditary dispositions arise from the energy of two conjugated germs\r\nduring the whole of life and till death. Old people sometimes develop\r\npeculiarities hitherto unknown in them, owing to the fact that one or\r\nmore of their ancestors also presented the same phenomena at an\r\nadvanced age.\r\n\r\n_Semon_ has clearly proved that, although forming an infinite number\r\nof combinations the engrams or hereditary energies never blend in the\r\nproper sense of the term, and in the light of his exposition the above\r\nfacts are more clearly explained than they had been hitherto. The\r\nexperiments of _Mendel_ have shown in plants a certain alteration in\r\nthe hereditary ecphorias of the products of dissimilar parents.\r\n\r\nCertain parental characters, according as they are added or\r\nsubtracted, may disappear during one or two generations, to reappear\r\nall the more strongly in the following generations. In short, there\r\nare a number of phenomena, the laws of which may be more clearly\r\nexplained to us in the future.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, each individual inherits on the average as much from his\r\npaternal as from his maternal side, although the minute nucleus of the\r\nspermatozoid is the only agent concerned on the paternal side, while\r\nthe mother provides not only the egg which is much larger, but also\r\nnutrition during the nine months of embryonic life. We can only\r\nconclude that in the egg also it is only from the part of the nucleus\r\nwhich conjugates with the male nucleus that arise all the inherited\r\nmaternal peculiarities; that all the rest is only utilized as food;\r\nand that the nutritive blood of the mother in no way influences the\r\ninherited energies of the offspring.\r\n\r\nThis shows the capital importance of conjugation and of the substance\r\nof the conjugated nuclei, especially of their chromatin. The fact\r\nthat, in certain of the lower animals, the protoplasm of the egg\r\nwithout nuclei may occasionally produce some phenomena of cell\r\ndivision, thanks to its inherited mnemic engrams, in no way alters the\r\nfundamental principle which alone occurs in man, for this vicarious\r\naction, which is moreover rudimentary, only happens when the\r\nprotoplasm of the egg is not consumed by the conjugated nuclei.\r\n\r\nParthenogenesis is also a very interesting phenomenon in the history\r\nof our animal ancestors, but for the same reasons it has no direct\r\ninterest for humanity.\r\n\r\nIf we take into consideration all the observations of which we have\r\njust spoken, which are as simple as they are irrefutably demonstrated,\r\nit is hardly possible to interpret them in any other way than by the\r\nfollowing hypothesis:\r\n\r\nIn each sexual gland, male or female, the germinal cells which are\r\nproduced by division of the cells of the embryo, reserved primarily\r\nfor reproduction, differ considerably from each other in quality and\r\ncontain in their infinitely small atoms very diverse and irregularly\r\ndistributed energies, inherited from their different ancestors. Some\r\ncontain more paternal and others more maternal energy, and among the\r\nformer there are some contain, for example, more paternal grandfather\r\nand others more maternal grandmother, and so on to infinity, till it\r\nis impossible to discover the ancestral origin of the fully grown\r\nindividual we are examining. The same holds good for the energies of\r\nthe maternal cells.\r\n\r\nAt the time of conjugation, the qualities of the child which will\r\nresult from it depend therefore on conditions of the ancestral\r\nqualities of the conjugated egg and spermatozoön. Moreover, although\r\nof the same size, the nuclei which become conjugated are evidently of\r\nunequal strength; the energies of one or the other predominate later\r\non in the embryo, and still later in man. According to circumstances\r\nthe latter will resemble more or less his paternal or maternal\r\nprogenitors.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the different organs of the body may receive their energies\r\nfrom different parts of the conjugated nuclei in different degrees. A\r\nperson may have his father's nose and his mother's eyes, the paternal\r\ngrandmother's humor and the maternal grandfather's intelligence, and\r\nall this with infinite degrees and variations, for it is only a matter\r\nof more or less accentuated averages. In my own face the two halves\r\nare distinctly different, one resembling my maternal ancestry and the\r\nother, in a lesser degree, my paternal ancestry, these points being\r\nseen distinctly in photographs taken in profile.\r\n\r\nEach germinal cell contains the hereditary mneme of its ancestors,\r\npaternal and maternal, and the two cells united by conjugation (Fig.\r\n17) that of the ancestors of each of them. We have spoken above of\r\necphorias produced according to _Mendel's_ law and reproducing\r\ncharacters which have been latent during one or two generations.\r\nDarwin was the first to study this interesting fact, which shows how\r\natavism often results from the crossing of varieties. There are\r\nseveral varieties of fowls which do not brood; if two of these\r\nvarieties, B and C, are crossed excellent brooders are obtained.\r\n_Semon_ assumes that in each of the non-brooding varieties the\r\nancestral energy, A, of the primary species, is weaker than that of\r\nvarieties B and C; we have then A > B, and A < C. But if B is coupled\r\nwith A the product represents the value B + C + A + A. Then B and C\r\nare in equilibrium; and A being doubled becomes stronger than each of\r\nthem and arrives at ecphoria in their place, which restores the\r\nfaculty of brooding to the product of crossing.\r\n\r\n_De Vries_ has shown, in the crossing of varieties with their primary\r\nspecies, more or less analogous phenomena which he calls\r\n\"Vicino-variations.\" Conjugation leads to infinite combinations and\r\nvariations which the law of heredity traverses like a guiding line.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated zoölogist, _Weismann_, considers that the chromatin of\r\neach germinal cell contains a considerable quantity of particles each\r\nof which is capable of forming an entire organism similar to the\r\nparents; these he calls \"ides.\" According to _Weismann_, each ide is\r\nsubdivided into \"determinants\" from which each part of the body is\r\nderived, being potentially predetermined in them. According to the\r\naction of a yet unknown irritation male or female determinants develop\r\nin each individual of the animal species with separate sexes. But if\r\nthe determinants are disordered, either by abnormal variations or by\r\npathological causes, hermaphrodites or monstrosities may be produced.\r\nIn animals which are normally hermaphrodite (snails, etc.), there is\r\nonly one kind of sexual determinant, while in polymorphous animals\r\n(ants, etc.), there are as many as the polymorphous forms. The\r\nconception of \"ides\" and \"determinants\" is only a hypothesis to which\r\nwe must not attach much value. The mnemic laws established by _Semon_\r\ngive a much better explanation of the facts.\r\n\r\nIt has often been maintained that the qualities of higher forms of man\r\nare exhausted in a few generations, while the mass of mediocrities\r\ncontinually produce new genius. The fact that the descendants of\r\ndistinguished men are often mediocre and that remarkable men suddenly\r\narise from the common people, appears at first sight to support this\r\nsuperficial assertion. It is forgotten, however, that in a people\r\nwhose average mass consists of thousands or millions of individuals,\r\nwhile men of higher powers are only counted by units or dozens, all\r\nthis arithmetic is reduced to absurdity by the inequality of numbers,\r\nas soon as the law of heredity is understood. To make a more exact\r\ncalculation, it would be necessary to compare the number of superior\r\nmen who have arisen from some hundreds of the most distinguished\r\nfamilies of a country with that of distinguished men who have arisen\r\nfrom some millions of the rest of the people, and then calculate the\r\npercentage. It is also necessary to take into account the means\r\nemployed in the education of the individuals. If education is\r\nobligatory and gratuitous in a country, this factor will have less\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nAnother error which is committed in such cases is to neglect the\r\ninfluence of the maternal lineage. A common woman will lower the level\r\nof the offspring of a distinguished husband, and inversely. In his\r\n\"History of Science and Scientists\" _Alphonse de Candolle_ has given\r\nirrefutable proof that the posterity of high-class men furnishes a\r\ngreat number proportionally of men high class in their turn, compared\r\nwith that of the average population. This shows the value of the usual\r\ntwaddle concerning this question. It is inconceivable that the laws of\r\nheredity should make an exception of the mental qualities of man.\r\nMoreover, the most deceptive point is the contrast of a man of genius\r\nwith his children, who do not rise to his standard because they\r\nrepresent a combination of his ancestral energies with those of their\r\nmother. This contrast makes the children appear unfavorably, while the\r\npublic has a general tendency to exaggerate the value of a great man.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the mneme throws light on this subject, by introducing a\r\nnew factor in the question, that of ecphoria of the cerebral engrams\r\nof the ancestors, accumulated in the hereditary mneme.\r\n\r\n=Heredity of Acquired Characters.=--While _Darwin_ and _Haeckel_\r\naffirmed the possibility of the heredity of characters acquired during\r\nlife by different tissues, for instance the brain, _Weismann_ limits\r\nthe possibility to everything that can modify the nucleoplasm of the\r\ngerminal cells. We must first eliminate the question of the phenomena\r\nof blastophthoria, which we shall consider next, and which _Weismann_\r\nwas, I think, the first to comprehend, without giving them the name.\r\n\r\nOn one hand we see the singular effects of castration, which we have\r\nalready considered; on the other hand, an extraordinary constancy in\r\nthe hereditary characters of the species. For more than three thousand\r\nsix hundred years, which corresponds to about eight hundred\r\ngenerations, the Jews have been circumcised. Nevertheless, if a Jew\r\nceases to circumcise his offspring the prepuce of his children grows\r\nas it did three thousand six hundred years ago, although, during the\r\neight hundred generations in question, its absence from birth has\r\nprevented it reacting on the germinal cells of the individuals. If the\r\nengraphia of the external world could sensibly modify in a few\r\ngenerations the hereditary mneme of the species, it appears evident\r\nthat the Jewish infants of the present day would be born without\r\nprepuce, or at least with an atrophied one.\r\n\r\nIt is on such facts, which are innumerable in natural history, that\r\n_Weismann_ relies to repudiate absolutely the heredity of characters\r\nacquired by non-germinal organs and to attribute the development of\r\norganisms to blends and combinations due to conjugation, or crossing,\r\nas well as to natural selection, which he regards as all-powerful.\r\n_Darwin_ well recognized the difficulty in question, and being unable\r\nto explain the facts, had recourse to the hypothesis of _pangenesis_,\r\nthat is of small particles detached from all parts of the body and\r\ntransported by the blood to the germinal cells, to transmit to them,\r\nfor example, the qualities acquired by the brain during life. This\r\nhypothesis was so improbable that _Darwin_ himself was forced to\r\nrecognize it. Let us examine the facts.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand a newly born Chinese transported and brought up in\r\nFrance will learn French, and will show no inclination to learn or\r\nunderstand Chinese. This well-established fact seems in favor of\r\n_Weismann_ and against the heredity of acquired characters. But, on\r\nthe other hand, we cannot understand how the evolution of the brain\r\nand its functions takes place, without admitting that in one way or\r\nanother the characters acquired by habits repeated during many\r\ngenerations gradually accumulate in the form of hereditary\r\ndispositions in the germinal protoplasm. It is certain that our brain\r\nhas progressed since the time when our ancestors were similar to the\r\ngorilla, or even the cave man at the beginning of the quaternary age.\r\nHow can this cerebral progression be explained only by selection which\r\ncan only eliminate, and by crossings which by themselves can hardly\r\nraise the average? It is here that the intervention of an unknown\r\npower is necessary, something unexplained, the action of which has\r\nbeen lately recorded in the phenomena of mutations of _de Vries_.\r\n\r\n_De Vries_ proves that certain variations appear suddenly and without\r\nany known cause, and have a much greater tendency to be preserved than\r\nthe variations obtained by crossing and selection. In my opinion the\r\nphenomena of the mneme revealed by _Hering_ and _Semon_ explain the\r\napparent contradictions which have hitherto impaired the theories of\r\nheredity. Mnemic engraphy explains, by its infinitesimal and repeated\r\naction through numerous generations, how the external world may little\r\nby little transmit to the germinal cells the characters which it\r\nimpresses on organisms. The eight hundred generations during which the\r\nprepuce of the Jews has been cut off have not yet sufficed for the\r\necphoria of the corresponding negative mnemic engraphia; while\r\nconjugation and selection modify rapidly and strongly in a few\r\ngenerations; a fact which is more striking and allows of direct\r\nexperiment. Moreover, a positive engraphia must necessarily act more\r\npowerfully, and it seems to me that mutations must be the ecphoria of\r\naccumulated former latent engraphias.\r\n\r\n_Merrifield_ and _Standfuss_, by exposing caterpillars and chrysalids\r\nfor varying periods to considerable degrees of cold and heat, have\r\ndetermined permanent changes in the specific characters of the\r\nbutterflies which have emerged from them.\r\n\r\n_Standfuss_ and _Fischer_ have also shown that, after several\r\ngenerations, by continuing the action of cold on the caterpillars, the\r\nvariations thus produced can be preserved even after the cold has\r\nceased to act. No doubt the cold acts on the germinal cells as on the\r\nrest of the body, but the heredity of an acquired character is thus\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of _Miss de Chauvin_ on salamanders (_Axolotl_) are\r\nstill more conclusive, for we are dealing here with characters\r\nacquired through aquatic or aërial media, which can hardly act on the\r\nsexual glands. We cannot continue this subject any further and we\r\nreturn to the work of _Semon_. It is needless to say that the nature\r\nof mnemic engraphia remains itself an unknown quantity. As long as we\r\nare unable to transform inert matter into a living organism we shall\r\nremain in ignorance. But, when it is accepted with the laws of the\r\nphenomena which it produces, this unknown quantity, as _Semon_ has\r\nshown, alone suffices to explain all the rest, and is already a great\r\nstep toward the comprehension of the laws which govern life.\r\n\r\n=Blastophthoria.=--By blastophthoria, or deterioration of the germ, I\r\nmean what might also be called false heredity, that is to say, the\r\nresults of all direct pathogenic or disturbing action, especially that\r\nof certain intoxications, on the germinal cells, whose hereditary\r\ndeterminants are thus changed. Blastophthoria thus acts on germs not\r\nyet conjugated, through the medium of their bearers, and creates at\r\ntheir origin _hereditary stigmata_ of all kinds, while true heredity\r\nonly combines and reproduces the ancestral energies.\r\n\r\nBlastophthoria deranges the mneme or hereditary engrams, and\r\nconsequently a more or less considerable part of their ecphorias\r\nduring the life of the individuals which arise from them. It is not a\r\nquestion here of the reproduction of the hereditary ancestral energies\r\nin the descendants (in different combinations) as is the case in the\r\nheredity which we have just studied, but, on the contrary, a question\r\nof their perturbation. However, the store of cells reserved as\r\ngerminal cells in the embryo, the germ of which has been damaged by\r\nblastophthoric action, being usually also affected by the disturbing\r\ncause, it follows that the pathological change introduced by\r\nblastophthoria in the hereditary mneme is transmitted to the\r\ndescendants by ordinary heredity. In this way blastophthoria deposits\r\nthe first germ of most pathological degenerations by causing immediate\r\ndeviation of all the determinants of the germ in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThe most typical and the commonest example of blastophthoria is that\r\nof alcoholic intoxication. The spermatozoa of alcoholics suffer like\r\nthe other tissues from the toxic action of alcohol on the protoplasm.\r\nThe result of this intoxication of the germs may be that the children\r\nresulting from their conjugation become idiots, epileptics, dwarfs or\r\nfeeble minded. Thus it is not alcoholism or the craving for drink\r\nwhich is inherited. No doubt the peculiarity of badly supporting\r\nalcohol is inherited by ordinary heredity as a hereditary disposition,\r\nbut it is not this which produces the alcoholic degenerations of the\r\nrace. These are the result of the single blastophthoria. When, on the\r\nother hand, a man is found to be imbecile or epileptic as the result\r\nof the insobriety of his father, he preserves the tendency to transmit\r\nhis mental weakness or his epilepsy to his descendants, even when he\r\nabstains completely from alcoholic drinks. In fact, the chromosomes of\r\nthe spermatozoid, from which about a half of his organism has issued,\r\nhave preserved the pathological derangement produced by the parental\r\nalcoholism in their hereditary mneme, and have transmitted it to the\r\nstore of germinal cells of the feeble minded or the epileptic, who in\r\nhis turn transmits it to his descendants. From _Weismann's_ point of\r\nview his hereditary determinants remain pathologically deviated. All\r\nintoxications which alter the protoplasm of the germinal cells may\r\nproduce blastophthoric degenerations, which continue to menace several\r\nsuccessive generations in the form of hereditary taints.\r\n\r\nOther deviations in the development of the germs may act in an\r\nanalogous manner to blastophthoria. We have mentioned above the\r\nexperiments of _Merrifield_ and _Standfuss_ on the caterpillars of\r\ncertain butterflies. Without being really of a pathological nature,\r\nthese actions of a physical agent on the hereditary energies resemble\r\nblastophthoria.\r\n\r\nMechanical action on the embryo may also give rise to pathological\r\nproducts or even mutilation. Thus, _Weismann_ demonstrated the\r\nproduction of degenerate individuals in ants when certain coleoptera\r\nwere introduced in their nest, the ants being fond of the secretion of\r\nthe large glandular hairs of the coleoptera. The exact cause of the\r\ndegeneration has not yet been found, but the fact is certain. In man,\r\ncertain constitutional affections and congenital anomalies are the\r\nresult of certain diseases in the procreators, which have affected the\r\ngerminal cells or the embryo (for instance syphilis). As soon as the\r\nblastophthoric actions cease in the procreators, those of their\r\ndescendants who live under a normal regimen have evidently a tendency\r\nto eliminate the blastophthoric organs at the end of several\r\ngenerations and to regenerate themselves little by little. Thanks to\r\nthe power of the ancestral mneme which tends to reëstablish homophony.\r\nHowever, the data on this subject are insufficient. In this case\r\nhomophony is represented by the normal equilibrium of the different\r\ntypical or normal characters of the species.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] I insert here some passages intended for more advanced readers,\r\nbut this does not imply that they are of less importance. On the\r\ncontrary I strongly advise all my readers to try and understand the\r\ntheories of _Hering_ and _Semon_, which appear to me to throw a new\r\nlight on the question of transformation and heredity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION OR DESCENT OF LIVING ORGANISMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory of evolution is intimately associated with the name of\r\n_Darwin_, for it was he who established it in the scientific world. In\r\nreality, the idea of the transformation of organisms was put forward\r\nby _Lamarck_ more than a century ago, but he did not sufficiently\r\nsupport it. The theory of evolution states that the different animal\r\nand vegetable species are not each of them specially created as such\r\nfrom the first, but that they are connected with each other by a real\r\nand profound relationship, and derived progressively one from another;\r\ngenerally from more simple forms, by engraphia and selection. Man\r\nhimself is no exception to this rule, for he is closely related to the\r\nhigher apes.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer possible to-day to deny the fundamental fact which we\r\nhave just stated. Since _Darwin_, and as the result of the powerful\r\nimpulse which this man of genius gave to natural science, innumerable\r\nobservations and experiments have confirmed the truth of the\r\nprogressive evolution of living beings. Comparative anatomy,\r\ncomparative geography of plants and animals, comparative embryology,\r\nand the study of the morphology and biology of a number of recently\r\ndiscovered plants and animals, have built up more and more the\r\ngenealogical tree, or _phylogeny_, of living beings, that is to say\r\ntheir ancestral lineage. The number of varieties and races or\r\nsub-species increases indefinitely, the more closely they are\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nResearches on the fossil remains of species of animals and plants\r\nwhich have been extinct for thousands and millions of years\r\n(_palæontology_) have also contributed to determine the trunk of the\r\ngreat tree of former life. The numerous gaps which still exist between\r\nthese fragmentary documents of former ages are nevertheless too\r\nconsiderable for continuous connections to be established in the past\r\nby the aid of fossils.\r\n\r\nWe not only know that the different forms of living beings are\r\nconnected to each other by a real relationship, but we can fathom more\r\nand more deeply the degrees of this relationship, and can often prove\r\nfrom which group of animals a given group is descended. In many cases\r\nwe can determine at which period the fauna and flora of two continents\r\nhave been separated from each other, and in what manner they have been\r\ntransformed, each in its own way, while still preserving the general\r\ncharacters which were common before their separation. The specialist\r\ncan soon discover what species belong to the old geographically\r\ndifferentiated fauna and flora of the country, and what have been\r\nulteriorily imported.\r\n\r\nI record these facts for the benefit of those persons who have not yet\r\nunderstood that it is absolutely useless at the present day to dispute\r\nthe evolution of living beings. Deceived by the divergent opinions of\r\nscientists concerning hypotheses which endeavor to explain the details\r\nof evolution, these persons confound the details with the fundamental\r\nfacts of evolution.\r\n\r\n=Ontogeny. Phylogeny.=--In the light of the facts of evolution,\r\nheredity takes quite a new aspect when removed from the old biblical\r\nidea of the independent creation of species. _Haeckel_ launched into\r\nthe scientific world, under the name of \"fundamental biogenetic law,\"\r\na theory which, without having the right to the title of an immutable\r\ndogma, explains the facts in a general way, and gives us a guiding\r\nline along the phylogenetic history of living beings. \"_Ontogeny_,\"\r\nthat is the history of the embryological development of each\r\nindividual, always consists in a summary and fragmentary repetition of\r\n_phylogeny_, or the history of the ancestors of the species to which\r\nthe individual belongs. This signifies that, as embryos, we repeat in\r\nan abridged form the series of types or morphological stages through\r\nwhich has passed the series of our animal ancestors, from the\r\nprimitive cell to man. In reality this is only true in a relative way,\r\nfor a considerable part of the ancestral engraphias of the embryo has\r\ndisappeared without leaving any trace; also many embryos, especially\r\nthose which have special conditions of existence outside the body of\r\ntheir mother, have acquired special complex organs and corresponding\r\nfunctions. Thus, the caterpillars of butterflies with their specific\r\nand generic peculiarities, hairs, horns, etc., furnish many examples\r\nof secondary acquired characters which have nothing in common with the\r\nworm, which is the ancestral type of the butterfly represented by the\r\nembryonic period when it is a caterpillar. However, many undoubted\r\nvestiges of the ancestral history are found in the embryos at\r\ndifferent periods of their development. It is certain that insects\r\ndescended from worms, and there is no doubt that the larvæ of insects,\r\nwhich are almost worms, represent the ontogenetic repetition of the\r\nphylogeny of insects.\r\n\r\nIt is also certain that whales, although they have whalebone instead\r\nof teeth, have descended from cetacea provided with teeth, which in\r\ntheir turn descended from terrestrial mammals. But we find in the\r\nembryo whale a complete denture which is of no use to it, and which\r\ndisappears in the course of the embryonic period. This denture is\r\nnothing else than a phylogenetic incident in the ontogeny of the\r\nwhale.\r\n\r\nIn the fins of cetacea, as in the four limbs of other mammals, we find\r\nthe same bones, which are derived from the bones of the wings and legs\r\nof their bird ancestors. In birds, the same bones are the phylogenetic\r\nderivatives of the limbs of reptiles.\r\n\r\nAll these facts demonstrate with certainty the descent of animal\r\nforms, a descent which we can follow in all its details. In certain\r\nants whose bodies show their close relationship with a slave-keeping\r\ngroup, but which have become the parasitic hosts of other ants, we\r\nfind not only the arched mandibles, shaped for rape, but the undoubted\r\nrudiments of the slave instinct, although this instinct has, perhaps,\r\nnot been exercised by them for thousands of years.\r\n\r\nThese examples suffice to show that the form and functions of a living\r\norganism, as well as its mental faculties, are derived not only from\r\nthe most recent direct ancestors of this organism, but that they\r\npartly mount much higher in the genealogical tree.\r\n\r\nOur coccyx is a vestige of the tail of animals. It is from them also\r\nthat we have inherited anger and jealousy, sexual appetites, fear,\r\ncunning, etc. As long as they remain in use, the oldest inherited\r\ncharacters normally remain the most tenacious and are preserved the\r\nlongest. When they cease to be utilized, or become useless, they still\r\nremain for a long time as rudiments before finally disappearing; for\r\ninstance the vermiform appendix of the intestine and the pineal gland\r\nof the brain. These rudiments often persist for still a longer time in\r\nthe embryo, as we have seen in the case of the ancestral teeth of the\r\nembryo whales. We also meet with the stumps of wings in the chrysalis\r\nof certain ants (_Anergates_), the males of which have lost their\r\nwings.\r\n\r\n=Natural Selection.=--The artificial selection practiced by gardeners\r\nand cattle breeders led _Darwin_ to his hypothesis of natural\r\nselection by the struggle for existence. Confirmed in his idea by the\r\nobservation of tropical nature, _Darwin_ thought he could explain the\r\norigin of living beings by natural selection. It is this hypothesis\r\nwhich is properly called _Darwinism_. But the name Darwinism has also\r\nbeen given to evolution as a whole, which has been the cause of\r\nendless confusion. All the mystic and narrow-minded, full of biblical\r\nprejudice, naturally profit by this confusion to attack the facts of\r\nevolution and science itself.\r\n\r\n=The Struggle for Existence.=--The struggle for existence and natural\r\nselection are absolutely positive facts, which can be constantly\r\nverified by the observation of living nature as it is presented to us.\r\nAll living beings eat one another or at any rate struggle against each\r\nother, plants as well as animals; and, apart from air and water,\r\nanimals are almost entirely nourished by plants and other animals. It\r\nis obvious that in this perpetual struggle the less adapted and the\r\nless armed--and by arms we include the powers of reproduction,\r\nresistance to diseases and to cold, etc.--disappear, while the better\r\nadapted and the better armed persist. I confess I cannot understand\r\nthe detractors of _Darwin_ who are blind in face of these facts and\r\nhypnotized by certain conventional suggestions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, what always has been and still remains hypothetical\r\nis the explanation of the descent of all plants and animals by natural\r\nselection alone. We have already spoken of the _mutations_ of _de\r\nVries_, and the theory of the _mneme_ elaborated by _Semon_, and need\r\nnot repeat them here. Thanks to the idea of _Hering_, worked out by\r\n_Semon_, the facts are now explained in a satisfactory manner.\r\nEngraphia, produced in the organisms by the irritating agents of the\r\nexternal world, prepares and builds up little by little their\r\nincreasing complications, while selection, by continually eliminating\r\nthe unfit, directs the elaborating work of the mneme and adapts it to\r\nthe surrounding local circumstances.\r\n\r\n_De Vries_ has objected that the variations produced by artificial and\r\nnatural selections are mutable, while sudden mutations have a much\r\nmore stable character. But we have just seen that these mutations\r\nthemselves are evidently only the delayed ecphoria of a long ancestral\r\nengraphia accumulated.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the variations obtained by selection are themselves\r\nonly due to more rapid ecphorias, derived from repeated conjugations\r\nin a certain direction. _Plate_ and others have shown that they may\r\nbecome more and more fixed, if they are well adapted, and thus become\r\nmore tenacious. There is, therefore, no contradiction between the\r\nfundamental facts, and all is simply and naturally explained by the\r\ncombination of hereditary mnemic engraphia with selection.\r\n\r\nRecent study on the transformations of living beings have shown that\r\nthey do not take place in a regularly progressive manner, as _Darwin_\r\nat first believed, but that periods of relatively rapid transformation\r\nalternate with periods of relative arrest, both in a general way and\r\nfor each particular species. We see certain species remaining almost\r\nstationary for an immense time and tending rather to disappear, while\r\nothers vary enormously, showing actual transformation. The\r\ntransplantation of one species to a new environment, for instance to a\r\nnew continent, provokes, as has been proved, a relatively rapid\r\ntransformation. It is evident that mnemic engraphia transforms\r\norganisms the more rapidly as it changes in nature itself, which is\r\nthe case in the migrations we have just mentioned, and which also\r\nchanges the factors of selection.\r\n\r\nOther facts show clearly that the fauna and flora of the present world\r\nfind themselves in a period of recoil with regard to their\r\nmodification. In the tertiary period the fauna and flora of the world\r\nwere richer than to-day; many more older species have disappeared than\r\nnew ones have arisen. This fundamental fact seems due to the extremely\r\nslow cooling of the earth, and appears to be indicated by the powerful\r\ngrowth in tropical climates, the fauna and flora of which resemble\r\nthose of the tertiary period, and, on the other hand by the relative\r\npoverty and slowness of growth in cold countries.\r\n\r\n=Conclusions.=--What are the principal conclusions to which we are led\r\nby this short study of the ancestral history or phylogeny of man?\r\n\r\n(1). The transformation or evolution of living beings is a\r\ndemonstrated fact.\r\n\r\n(2). The factors in evolution appear at first sight to be very\r\ndiverse: selection, mutation, climatological, physical and chemical\r\nfactors, etc.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that they may all be connected with the fundamental\r\nprinciple of mnemic engraphia, aided by natural selection. No doubt\r\nthe nature of the mnemic engraphia of external agents in the living\r\nsubstance is still unknown. When we are able to connect the laws of\r\nlife with the laws of inert nature, we shall only have before us a\r\nsingle great metaphysical mystery, that of the tendency of mundane\r\nenergy to the differentiation of details and the production of\r\ncomplicated forms. What is important here is to know that engraphia\r\nand selection are capable of considerably modifying species in a\r\npositive or negative manner, for good or evil, improving them by good\r\ninfluence and good conjugations, or deteriorating them by bad\r\nselection or by blastophthoria, which causes them to degenerate. The\r\ncombination of a bad selection with blastophthoric influences\r\nconstitutes the great danger for humanity, and it is here that a\r\nrational sexual life should intervene.\r\n\r\n(3). The mental faculties of animal species, as well as their physical\r\ncharacters, depend on their ancestral hereditary mneme. They simply\r\nrepresent the internal or introspective side of central activity, and\r\nthe brain obeys the natural laws of the mneme in the same way as the\r\nother organs.\r\n\r\n(4). It follows from all this that phylogeny and selection, the same\r\nas heredity properly understood, have the right to a fundamental place\r\nin the sexual question, for the germs which, after each conception,\r\nreproduce an individual are, on the one hand, bearers of the inherited\r\nenergy of our ancestors, and on the other hand, that of future\r\ngenerations. According to the care or neglect of civilized humanity\r\nthey may be transformed for good or evil, progress or recede.\r\nUnfortunately, owing to religious and other prejudices, the question\r\nof evolution is not discussed in schools. Hence, the majority of men\r\nonly hear of these things by hearsay in a rough and inexact manner; so\r\nthat a series of phenomena familiar to naturalists and medical men,\r\nare still dead letters for the rest of the public. This obliges me to\r\nspeak further on some points of detail.\r\n\r\nThe so-called historical times, that is the times of the Chinese,\r\nEgyptians and Assyrians, which appear to us extremely remote, are from\r\nthe point of view of evolution very near to us. These ancient peoples,\r\nat any rate those who were our direct ancestors, or who were closely\r\nrelated to them, are thus, in the language of evolution, which takes\r\nno count of time or of the number of generations, our very near\r\nrelations. The generations which separate them from us and the few\r\nhundred generations between them and those of their direct ancestors,\r\nwho were at the same time ours, represent a limited period from the\r\npoint of view of the ethnological history of mankind.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we examine the savage peoples of America, Asia,\r\nAfrica and Australia, which have been specially studied since the\r\ndiscovery of America and some of which are actually living, and\r\ncompare them with ourselves and with our ancestors of four thousand\r\nyears ago, we find that they differ infinitely more from us than we\r\ndiffer from our ancestors, as their ethnographical and historical\r\nremains are sufficient to prove.\r\n\r\nAmong the savage peoples we find races such as the pigmies of\r\n_Stanley_ (Akkaas), the Weddas of Ceylon, even Australians and\r\nnegroes, whose whole bodily structure differs profoundly from our\r\nEuropean race and its varieties. The profoundness and constancy of\r\nthese differences clearly show that the relationship of such races to\r\nours must be very remote. We are concerned here with veritable races\r\nor sub-species, or at least with very constant and accentuated\r\nvarieties. It is true that it is difficult to unravel the almost\r\ninextricable confusion of human races; but we may be certain that the\r\nsavage races and varieties remote from ours, and even certain\r\nless-remote races such as the Mongols and Malays, are, phylogenetically\r\nspeaking, infinitely less related to us than the ancient Assyrians.\r\nThis indicates that the ancestors which were common to us and these\r\nraces must probably be looked for several thousands of generations\r\nback, even when their descendants are still living on other continents\r\nat the present day.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to explain that human races so different could develop\r\nseparately in continents and under climates with a very different mode\r\nof life and conditions of development, if we reflect that at these\r\nremote periods men only had very limited modes of transport and lived\r\nin a fashion very little different from that of the anthropoid apes,\r\nso that the ethnological forms were preserved separated from each\r\nother by small distances. This fact can still be observed among the\r\nsmall hostile Indian or Malay tribes, who live in tropical regions and\r\noften occupy only a few square leagues. The higher civilizations of\r\nformer times could not develop beyond a comparatively limited circle,\r\nas their means of transport did not allow them to venture too far. The\r\nconquest of the whole earth by modern civilization by means of the\r\nmariner's compass, firearms, steam and electricity is thus an\r\nabsolutely contemporaneous event, unique in the history of the world,\r\nthe origin of which hardly goes back more than four hundred years.\r\nThis event has completely upset the natural internal evolution of\r\nhuman races, by the fact that all the lower races attacked by\r\ncivilized races armed with guns and alcohol, are destined to rapid and\r\ncomplete destruction.\r\n\r\nGeology has discovered in the caves of the quaternary period, human\r\nremains which are much lower in the scale of evolution and much nearer\r\nthe anthropoid apes than the lowest races still living. Their brain,\r\nas shown by the cranial cavity, was still smaller. Lastly, _Dubois_\r\nhas discovered in Java the cranium of _Pithecanthropus erectus_ which\r\nis intermediate between that of the orang-utan and man. If more such\r\nremains are discovered the chain of transition between the apes and\r\nman will be almost complete.\r\n\r\n=Hybridity. Consanguinity.=--Before concluding this chapter we must\r\nstudy the question of _hybrids_. It is important to know to what point\r\nfecundity and descent are influenced by the degree of relationship\r\nbetween the two procreators. Conjugation probably arises from the\r\ngeneral necessity of organisms to reënforce their race by variety.\r\nConsanguinity perpetuated is harmful to the species, in the same way\r\nas parthenogenesis, or indefinite reproduction by fission or budding.\r\nIt produces enfeeblement and degeneration of the race, and leads to\r\nextinction by causing sterility.\r\n\r\nBy _consanguinity_ is meant continued sexual union between near\r\nrelatives. It is easy to understand that the conjugation of two germs\r\nderived from brothers and sisters or from a father and his daughter\r\napproaches parthenogenesis from the point of view of the mixing of\r\nhereditary energies. We shall see later on that nearly all peoples\r\nhave a certain repugnance to consanguineous marriages. Among animals,\r\nnatural selection eliminates too consanguineous products.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, sexual union between different species, however\r\nlittle removed, gives no products. Near species may produce hybrids\r\nbetween themselves, but these hybrids are as a rule sterile or nearly\r\nso, and are incapable of perpetuating their type, which reverts\r\nrapidly to one of the primitive species.\r\n\r\nIt has been recently demonstrated that the incapacity of two species\r\nof animals to produce hybrids is intimately connected with the\r\nreciprocal toxicity of their blood. When the blood of one species is\r\ninjected into the veins of another the production of hybrids is\r\npossible between them, at least as far as has been observed. It is\r\ncurious to note that the blood of the anthropoid apes is not toxic for\r\nman, although these animals are very different from us, and hybrids\r\nhave not yet been produced. This fact helps us to understand how it is\r\nthat the differences which exist between the different human races do\r\nnot prevent the production of hybrids between any two of them. In\r\nspite of this we may state, without risk of error, that the most\r\ndissimilar human races give a bad quality of hybrids, which have\r\nlittle chance of forming a viable mongrel race. We have not\r\nsufficient information on this point concerning the lowest human\r\nraces, such as the pigmies and Weddas. On the other hand, mulattoes\r\n(hybrids between negroes and whites) constitute a race of very bad\r\nquality and hardly viable, while the hybrids between Indians and\r\nwhites are much more resistant and of relatively better quality.\r\n\r\nIn this question, the middle course appears without any doubt the true\r\none. Unions between near races and varieties, or at least between\r\nindividuals of the same race or variety whose relationship is old, are\r\ncertainly the best. We readily grant that the homogeneity of a race\r\nhas the advantage of fixing its peculiarities in a more durable and\r\ncharacteristic fashion; but many inconveniences counterbalance this\r\nadvantage. If we one day, by wise selection and by eliminating all\r\nsources of blastophthoria obtain a superior quality of human germs, it\r\nis possible that in the remote future, consanguinity, provided it is\r\nnot exaggerated may lose its dangers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nNATURAL CONDITIONS AND MECHANISM OF HUMAN\r\nCOITUS--PREGNANCY--CORRELATIVE SEXUAL CHARACTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to comprehend the deep meaning and lofty aim of an\r\nact like that of sexual union without knowing the details of\r\nconjugation and the origin of man as we have explained them in the\r\npreceding chapters.\r\n\r\nConjugation requires the bringing together of two cells, and\r\nconsequently the movement of at least one of them. This cellular\r\nmovement suffices for the lower forms of union and is usually limited\r\nto the male cell. Owing to its movement it plays the active role,\r\nwhile the passive role is reserved for the female cell. Hence we see\r\nin the higher plants the male cells, or pollen, transported to the\r\npistil by the wind or by insects, and thence reach the egg by\r\nmechanical endosmotic attraction which brings about conjugation.\r\n\r\nThis takes place in an analogous manner in lower animals, but the male\r\ncell is generally endowed with special movement. As soon as we deal\r\nwith complicated animals, mobile in themselves and composed of cells\r\ndifferentiated to form complex organs, we see a second phenomena of\r\nreproductive movements appear in the animal phylogeny, namely the\r\nmovement of the whole individual bearing male cells toward the\r\nindividual bearing female cells. This simple fact gives rise to the\r\nformation of correlative sexual differences between the individuals\r\nbearing each kind of germinal cells. As the result of the evolution of\r\nthese two phylogenetic systems of motor phenomena tending to establish\r\nconjugation, we obtain for each sex two categories of sexual\r\nformations:\r\n\r\n(1). The _germinal cells themselves_, the female form of which becomes\r\nlarger, more rich in protoplasm, and remains immobile, while the male\r\nform, or spermatozoid becomes extremely small and is provided with\r\nmotor apparatus (Fig. 11).\r\n\r\n(2). The _individuals_ with their correlative sexual differences\r\nproper to the male and female, disposed in a way to give the male the\r\nactive role and the female the passive role.\r\n\r\nNormal hermaphrodism, complete or reciprocal (snails, etc.)\r\nconstitutes an intermediate stage. Here each individual bears two\r\nkinds of germinal cells and possesses also male and female copulative\r\norgans, so that there only exists one form of individuals which\r\ncopulate reciprocally; the male organ of one penetrating the female\r\norgan of the other and vice versa. It is obvious that this excludes\r\nthe formation of correlative individual sexual characters.\r\n\r\nIn the second category, the male always differs from the female, at\r\nleast in the sexual organs, and usually in other physical and mental\r\ncharacters. The difference in the sexual functions leads to the\r\nformation of differences in other parts of the body, and in instincts\r\nand sentiments, which find their material expression in the different\r\ndevelopment of the brain.\r\n\r\nCertain specific functions in society may, in social animals like the\r\nants, lead to the formation or differentiation of a third or fourth\r\nkind of individuals. This is what is called _polymorphism_. Here it is\r\nnot the sexual function causes the correlative differences of the\r\nindividuals, but division of social labor. The ecphoria of the\r\nhereditary mneme which produces the polymorphous, and more or less\r\nasexual individual forms (workers, warriors,) still proceeds through\r\nthe energies of the reproducing germs. Here the action of selection is\r\nnecessary to explain the phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn man, sexual differentiation has led to the formation of two kinds\r\nof individuals, differing little in their correlative attributes, but\r\neach bearing one kind of germinal cells. In sexual union man plays the\r\nactive part, woman, the passive. When sexual activity, in the animal\r\nkingdom, is no longer limited to the movement of one of the cells but\r\nrequires the displacement of the whole individual, we can quite\r\nunderstand that the organization of these individuals must become much\r\nmore complex, and that it requires a central nervous system as a\r\ndirecting apparatus. Sexual individuality thus involves collaboration\r\nof the other organs of the body, and especially that of the central\r\norgans for reflex movements, the instincts and the higher mental\r\nfaculties of man, in the accomplishment of the fecundating act those\r\nwhich are the consequences of it.\r\n\r\nFrom this simple animal origin is evolved the complex sexual love of\r\nman. The duty of the active or male individual is to bring the\r\nspermatozoa to a point where they can easily reach the female cells or\r\novules. When this is done the duty of the male is accomplished. In the\r\npassive or female individual of the higher animals, pairing and\r\nconjugation are only the commencement of reproductive activity.\r\nHowever, this is not the case in the whole animal kingdom. For\r\ninstance, fish have distinct sexes, but in them the female deposits\r\nher non-fecundated eggs in the water and is not concerned with them\r\nany further. The male then arrives and discharges his sperm on the\r\neggs. In this case fecundation takes place without copulation. With\r\nsuch a system sexual love and maternal love lose their _raison\r\nd'être_, for the young fish are capable of providing for themselves as\r\nsoon as they are born. There are, however, a few exceptions, one of\r\nthe most curious being that of certain fish of the Dead Sea, in which\r\nthe male incubates the eggs by taking them into his buccal cavity.\r\n\r\n=Reproduction in Vertebrates.=--We should never finish if we were to\r\ndescribe even the chief varieties of sexual union among the\r\nvertebrates. As a rule, the male possesses a copulating organ which\r\nprojects externally, while the female presents an invaginated cavity,\r\nmore or less cylindrical, into which the male organ can penetrate. A\r\ncertain amount of sperm is deposited by the male in the neighborhood\r\nof the mature ovules (Fig. 18) discharged from the female germinal\r\ngland or ovary, which renders conjugation possible. By means of their\r\nmobile tails, the spermatozoa (Fig. 11) are able to reach the ovules\r\nand fecundate them. The manner in which the egg when fecundated,\r\neither in the mother's body or after being laid, continues its\r\ndevelopment, varies enormously in different species. The eggs are\r\noften deposited by the female and the embryo develops outside the\r\nmother's body. This occurs in insects, mollusks, fish, amphibia,\r\nreptiles, birds and the lowest mammals or monotremes (ornithorhynchus\r\nand echidna).\r\n\r\nIn the lower mammals is developed an organ called the womb which\r\nallows the embryo to remain longer in the maternal body. This organ is\r\nvery incomplete in them, and a pocket or fold in the skin of the belly\r\nallows the mother to carry her young, which are extremely embryonic at\r\nbirth, till they have developed sufficiently to live alone. This\r\noccurs in marsupials (kangaroos and opossums), in which the vagina and\r\nuterus are double.\r\n\r\nIn the higher mammals the womb becomes more and more developed,\r\nopening into a single vagina in the middle line of the abdomen,\r\nbetween the two ovaries, and constituting a highly specialized organ\r\nwhich allows the mother to preserve the young for a long time in her\r\nbelly. In most mammals the uterus has two elongated diverticula, each\r\nof which may contain a successive series of embryos. In man it forms a\r\nsingle cavity and normally contains a single embryo, occasionally two\r\nor more. These facts show that the role of the female mammal in\r\nreproduction is more important than that of the male. But this is not\r\nall. Whether it still lays eggs, or whether it gives birth to young\r\nwhich are more or less developed its sexual role is far from ended.\r\nThe higher oviparous vertebrates, especially the birds, take care of\r\ntheir progeniture for some time after laying. The young are still fed\r\nby the mother, either by milk from the teats, as in mammals, or by\r\nnourishment obtained from outside, as in birds, or by both methods\r\ncombined or succeeding each other, as in cats.\r\n\r\nIn many animals the male contributes to the raising of the young; a\r\npoint to which we shall return. Here, we indicate these complicated\r\ndetails simply to show that sexual union only contributes one link in\r\nthe long chain of reproduction. Let us study its mechanism in man.\r\n\r\n=The Copulatory Organ of Man. The Testicles. The Seminal\r\nVesicles.=--Nature is often very sparing even in the highest\r\norganizations. It has thus combined in the male the urethra with the\r\ncopulatory organ, and the sexual germinal glands, or _testicles_, with\r\nan accessory gland, the _epididymis_. Hundreds of thousands of\r\nspermatozoa are contained in the glandular tubes of these organs,\r\nwhich, when they are mature can always produce new ones by cell\r\ndivision. The spermatozoa accumulate at the extremity of the duct of\r\nthe gland in a reservoir called the _seminal vesicle_, where they\r\nfloat in the mucus, thus constituting the seminal fluid or _sperm_.\r\nThis liquid has a special odor. The two seminal vesicles are situated\r\nin the abdominal cavity underneath the urinary bladder, each having a\r\nduct which meets that of the other side and opens by the side of it in\r\nthe deep part of the urethra. Here the secretion of several other\r\nglands, especially of the _prostate_, is added to the sperm and mixes\r\nwith it. The point where the two seminal ducts open into the urethra\r\nforms a small elevation, the _verumontanum_. From this point the male\r\nurethra emerges from the abdominal cavity and is continued along the\r\nspecial prolongation which forms the penis, or virile member of\r\ncopulation. In the ordinary way the penis only serves for the emission\r\nof urine. It hangs flaccid and terminates in a rounded swelling called\r\nthe glans, at the end of which opens the urethra (Fig. 18). This\r\nopening serves also for the emission of the sperm.\r\n\r\n=Erection. The Corpus Cavernosum.=--The most curious part of this\r\napparatus is the mechanism of _erection_, or the power possessed by\r\nthe penis of swelling under the influence of certain nervous\r\nirritations, increasing in length and diameter as well as becoming\r\nrigid. This phenomenon is produced by three organs called the\r\n_cavernous bodies_ which form the principal bulk of the penis. One of\r\nthem, situated in the middle and underneath and formed by two bodies\r\nunited into one, surrounds the urethra and terminates in front in a\r\ndilatation which constitutes the glans already mentioned. The two\r\nothers are situated symmetrically on the dorsal part of the penis. All\r\nthree consist of caverns or diverticula formed by blood-vessels, which\r\nare empty when the penis is flaccid. By a complex nervous mechanism\r\nbased on vascular paralysis due to nervous phenomena called inhibition\r\nand dynamogeny, the nervous irritations cause an accumulation of blood\r\nin the spaces of the cavernous bodies which become so gorged with\r\nblood as to form stiff and hard rods. The size of the penis is thereby\r\nincreased considerably and its stiffness allows it to penetrate the\r\nvagina of the female. At the same time and by the same mechanism the\r\nverumontanum swells so as to close the ureter from the bladder, while\r\nthe seminal ducts open toward the urethral orifice. In this way the\r\ncopulatory organ is ready for its function.\r\n\r\nRepeated irritations are however necessary to provoke the ejaculation\r\nof semen. This is finally produced by excitation of a special muscle\r\nwhich compresses the seminal vesicles in a spasmodic manner and\r\nejaculates the semen by the urethra. After ejaculation, the\r\naccumulation of blood in the cavernous bodies gradually diminishes and\r\nthe penis again becomes flaccid.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus is thus very complicated and is put in action by\r\nseveral nervous irritations which may be disturbed in many ways in\r\naffections of the nervous system. We may observe here that the nervous\r\ncenters of erection and ejaculation may be put in action directly by\r\nthe brain, or indirectly by peripheral irritation of the glans.\r\n\r\nThose peripheral nerves which provoke sexual excitation are especially\r\nthe nerves of the glans. This possesses a skin or mucous membrane\r\nwhich is extremely delicate and is protected against external\r\nirritation by a fold of skin called the _prepuce_, or foreskin. The\r\nprepuce is often too narrow so that it cannot be withdrawn behind the\r\nglans. It then forms a pocket in which sebaceous matter, semen, urine,\r\netc., accumulate and decompose. This anomaly, called _phimosis_, does\r\nnot exist among the Jews owing to circumcision, or the removal of the\r\nprepuce in the newly born, which forms part of their religious rites.\r\nHygienic considerations sometimes oblige us to perform this operation\r\nin others. The bad habit of masturbation, so common in boys, is often\r\nprovoked by phimosis, and shows that simple mechanical irritation of\r\nthe glans, due here to secretions contained in the prepuce, may lead\r\nto ejaculation of semen as well as to erection.\r\n\r\nWe have seen above that the male and female germinal glands arise from\r\nthe same primitive organ in the embryo. If the embryo becomes male,\r\nthis organ is transformed into the two testicles which descend\r\ngradually in the canal of the groin and become placed in the scrotum.\r\nIf it becomes female, the two sexual glands remain in the abdominal\r\ncavity and are transformed into ovaries.\r\n\r\n=The Genital Organs of Woman.=--The organs described in Chapter II\r\n(Figs. 18 and 19), constitute the internal and more important part of\r\nthe female sexual apparatus. In women, the urethra opens externally on\r\nits own account. It is much shorter and wider than in men. At its\r\nexternal extremity is a small cavernous body called the _clitoris_,\r\nwhich corresponds embryologically to the penis in man, and chiefly to\r\nthe glans. Like the latter it is specialized for sexual irritation and\r\npossesses very sensitive nerves. The opening of the female urethra is\r\nsituated in front of the vulva directly under the pubic bone, at the\r\nsame place as the root of the male penis. From this point, on each\r\nside of the middle line, extend two longitudinal folds, one external\r\ncovered with skin and called the larger lip of the vulva (Fig. 18,\r\n_labia majora_), the other internal, hidden under the first, called\r\nthe lesser lip of the vulva (_labia minora_), and covered with thin\r\nmucous membrane. Between the two lesser lips is the sexual aperture,\r\nwhich, with the labia majora and minora is called the _vulva_. This\r\nopening is distinct from that of the urethra, and leads to the\r\ninternal cavity or _vagina_ (Fig. 18). The vagina is about ten to\r\ntwelve centimeters long (2 to 2-½ inches) and terminates in a\r\n_cul-de-sac_ which surrounds the vaginal portion of the womb, of which\r\nwe have spoken above.\r\n\r\nIn virgins the entrance to the vagina is more or less closed by a\r\ndelicate transverse membrane called the _hymen_, which is only\r\nperforated by a narrow opening. At the first coitus the hymen is torn,\r\ncausing a certain amount of pain and bleeding. The walls of the vagina\r\nare thrown into transverse folds, which render them somewhat rough.\r\nThe remains of the hymen torn by the first coitus afterward form\r\nbehind the vulva small excrescences named _carunculæ myrtiformes_.\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter we have spoken of the changes undergone by the\r\nfecundated ovule till it becomes the embryo and then the infant. It\r\nremains to speak of the mechanism of expulsion of the ovule and of its\r\nfecundation, as well as the changes in the womb which result from\r\nthese phenomena.\r\n\r\n=Menstruation.=--About every four weeks, one or two ovules (rarely\r\nmore) mature and are discharged into the Fallopian tubes, down which\r\nthey pass by the movement of the vibratile cilia of the mucous\r\nmembrane, to the uterus, to the walls of which they become attached if\r\nthey have been fecundated on the way (Fig. 18). Fecundation or\r\nconjugation takes place most often in the Fallopian tube, sometimes in\r\nthe uterus. The maturation and expulsion of the ovule are generally\r\naccompanied in women by a nervous phenomenon closely related to\r\nerection in man. The mucous membrane of the cavity of the uterus is\r\nvery rich in blood vessels which become dilated and gorged with blood\r\nunder the inhibitory influence of certain nerve centers. As the mucous\r\nmembrane is very thin, the result is otherwise than in man; the blood\r\ntransudes through the mucous membrane and flows away. This is called\r\n_menstruation_ (\"courses\" or monthly periods). The object of this is,\r\nno doubt, to prepare the mucous membrane of the womb for the fixation\r\nof the fecundated egg which will become grafted on its surface. The\r\ncourses in women generally last three or four days, but are often very\r\nirregular. It is necessary to point out that they do not depend on\r\novulation (expulsion of the egg). The two phenomena may take place\r\nindependently of each other, for menstruation in itself depends only\r\non nervous irritation, which may be provoked or averted by hypnotic\r\nsuggestion, for example.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there are women who never menstruate and who, in spite of\r\nthis, not only regularly discharge ovules but may be fecundated and\r\nbecome pregnant. Usually, however, the two phenomena are associated by\r\nnervous reflexes, so that menstruation takes place first and then the\r\novule commences its migration.\r\n\r\n=The Mechanism of Coitus.=--Copulation, or coitus, takes place as\r\nfollows: After a certain degree of excitation, both mental and\r\nsensory, the male introduces the erect and stiffened penis into the\r\nvagina. In the case of advanced pregnancy he should place himself\r\nbehind, so as to avoid injuring the unborn child. Rhythmic movements\r\nof the two individuals, especially of the man, gradually increase the\r\nexcitation of the mucous membrane or skin of the genital organs of\r\neach party, till voluptuous sensations, arising chiefly in the glans\r\npenis and clitoris, spread to the whole nervous system and the entire\r\nbody, constituting what is called the _venereal orgasm_, and\r\nterminating in the man by the ejaculation of semen.\r\n\r\nThe localizations of irritability in woman are multiple, and to the\r\nclitoris must be added the nipples, the vulva, and even, it is said,\r\nthe neck of the womb. In man the parts round the anus may also,\r\nbesides the glans penis, form an excitable region. At the acme of\r\nerection the glans is turgid, and is applied directly against the neck\r\nof the womb (Fig. 18). In this way the sperm is ejaculated directly\r\nagainst the neck of the womb.\r\n\r\nIn the woman an analogous phenomenon takes place; the clitoris becomes\r\nturgid and the mild and repeated friction of the mucous membranes,\r\ntogether with contact on other sensitive parts, produces a voluptuous\r\nsensation as in the man. Through nervous association, the repeated\r\nexcitation determines secretion from certain glands of the vagina\r\nwhich lubricate the vulva (glands of _Bartholin_). At the maximum\r\npoint of voluptuous feeling the woman experiences something analogous\r\nto the venereal orgasm of the man. There is thus manifested in the two\r\nsexes an intense and reciprocal desire of penetration one by the\r\nother, a desire which powerfully favors fecundation. In the woman as\r\nin the man the end of the orgasm is followed by an agreeable\r\nrelaxation which invites sleep.\r\n\r\nThe hereditary or instinctive nervous actions produce after coitus a\r\nprofound effect of contrast. When the sexual appetite commences, the\r\nodors, especially those of the sexual organs, the contacts, the\r\nmovements, and the sight of the individual of the opposite sex, all\r\nincrease desire, producing a voluptuous excitation stronger than all\r\ncontrary feeling. Hardly is the sexual act consummated than all\r\nvanishes like a dream. What was a moment before the object of the most\r\nviolent desire becomes indifferent, and sometimes even excites a\r\nslight feeling of disgust, at least as regards certain odors,\r\nsometimes even regarding touch and sight. The name sexual appetite\r\n(libido sexualis) is given to the passionate and purely sexual desire\r\nof the two sexes for each other. It varies greatly in different\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Ferdy_ and other authors, the neck of the womb, during\r\nthe venereal orgasm of the woman, executes movements of suction in the\r\nglans penis. I do not know if this is a fact, but it is certain that\r\nthe female orgasm is useless for conception. Absolutely cold women,\r\nincapable of the least voluptuous sensation are as fruitful as those\r\nwho have pronounced venereal orgasms. It proves that the spermatozoa\r\narrive at their goal even when the womb is entirely passive. The great\r\nvariation of sexual desire in different individuals renders mutual\r\nadaptation often very difficult. The venereal orgasm is sometimes more\r\nrapid in man, sometimes in woman (more rarely in the latter). This\r\ninequality is rather to the detriment of the woman, for the man can\r\nstill satisfy himself when the orgasm of the woman has terminated,\r\nwhile the contrary is not possible without artificial manipulation.\r\nMoreover, the frequence and intensity of the sexual appetite are often\r\nmuch greater in one than in the other, which is detrimental to both.\r\nHere again it is the woman who suffers the most, for the man can\r\nalways satisfy himself without the woman having voluptuous sensations.\r\nWhat is commonly called good manners generally prevents the conjoints\r\nfrom speaking of their sexual desires before marriage. This very often\r\nresults in grave deceptions, dissensions, and often even divorce. I\r\nshall return to this subject in Chapter XIV.\r\n\r\nVoluptuous sensations only represent the means employed by nature to\r\nbring together the sexes with the object of reproducing the species. A\r\nwoman can be fecundated and give birth to a child by the aid of semen\r\ninjected into the uterus by a syringe. Moreover, it is rather\r\nexceptional for the venereal orgasm to occur in the two sexes at the\r\nsame moment. It is essential for fecundation that the semen should\r\nenter the womb. When the spermatozoa have reached the neighborhood of\r\nthe neck of the womb they swim by their own movements, not only along\r\nthe whole uterine cavity, but also along the Fallopian tubes and even\r\nin the abdominal cavity, so that the force of ejaculation is of little\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n=Pregnancy.=--The womb enlarges considerably during pregnancy. It\r\nexceeds the size of an adult head, and the muscles of its walls are\r\ngreatly increased, so as to be capable of expelling the child later\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of pregnancy, birth and suckling are known to all, so\r\nthat I shall be brief. The almost sudden activity of the breasts after\r\nchildbirth is a very interesting correlative phenomenon. It suffices\r\nto glance at one who has just become a mother and to observe the\r\ncomplications which profoundly influence all her organism with regard\r\nto the life of the infant, to comprehend to what extent the role of\r\nsexual life is more important, more profound, even more vital, in\r\nwoman than in man. The latter no doubt requires a more violent\r\nappetite to urge him to copulation because he plays the active part,\r\nshort though it be. But fecundating coitus having been effected, his\r\ncontribution to the reproduction of the species is ended.\r\n\r\nWhile the activity of man is terminated at conception, that of woman\r\nonly begins at this moment. In the first chapter we have indicated in\r\na few words the transformations of the human embryo up to its birth.\r\nDuring nine months it grows from the size of a pin's head (the ovule)\r\nto that of the new-born child. Although a woman seldom bears more than\r\none embryo at the same time, twins being rare on the whole, she has\r\nnevertheless more pain and fatigue to bear than any female animal.\r\nThis is due not only to the fact that our artificial and alcoholized\r\ncivilization, with its specialized labor which disturbs vital\r\nequilibrium, has made women indolent and degenerate, but also to the\r\nenormous development of the human brain. The head of the human embryo\r\nis disproportionately large because the brain, as I showed with\r\n_Schiller_ in 1889, already contains at birth all the nerve elements\r\nwhich it will possess during the rest of its life (_Comptes rendus de\r\nl'Académie des Sciences_). No doubt these elements are small and\r\nembryonic but the nerve fibers are ready to be covered with myelin and\r\nto enter upon their functions, and all this requires a cranium of\r\nconsiderable size. But it is not everything for the mother to nourish\r\nwith her blood the brain and the cranium of the child; it is also\r\nnecessary for this relatively large head to pass through the pelvis at\r\nthe time of childbirth, and we know that this moment is the most\r\ndangerous for the life of the pregnant woman. As boys have on the\r\naverage a larger brain and cranium than those of girls, their birth is\r\nusually more difficult.\r\n\r\n=Accouchement.=--The sexual organs of woman undergo great changes in\r\norder to render childbirth possible. These organs become larger and\r\nmore vascular, especially the womb, the growth of which is\r\nastonishing. Originally the size of a small egg (a guinea fowl's) it\r\nexceeds the size of a human head, and there is an enormous increase of\r\nmuscular tissue in its walls. Large blood vessels develop in the\r\nuterine wall, especially in the placenta (Figs. 22 and 23), where they\r\nenter into endosmotic relations with the circulation of the embryo.\r\n\r\nFrom the abdomen of the embryo arises an organ, the _allantois_, which\r\nis destined to carry the blood-vessels of the embryo to the placenta,\r\nand at the same time to give rise to the formation of the latter. In\r\nthe placenta the blood-vessels of the embryo are separated from those\r\nof the mother by walls so thin that the nutritive juices of the\r\nmaternal blood transude into the venous blood of the embryo, as well\r\nas combined oxygen in the blood necessary for its respiration. Up to\r\nthis point the vitellus of the egg, nourished by endosmosis through\r\nits membranes, had sufficed for the nutrition of the still very small\r\nembryo. While these phenomena are taking place, and while the\r\nsubstance of the two conjugated germs divides into an ever increasing\r\nnumber of cells, which become differentiated in layers to form the\r\nfuture organs (Fig. 21), while certain groups of cells are prepared\r\nsome to form the intestinal canal, others the muscles and blood\r\nvessels, others the skin and organs of sense, others arising from the\r\nlast to form the brain, the spinal cord and the nerves, the mother can\r\nstill live her ordinary life. She suffers, however, from different\r\ndisorders connected with what is passing on in her body.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that these disorders are more accentuated at the\r\ncommencement of pregnancy, when the womb is hardly enlarged, than at\r\nthe end. They consist chiefly of nervous troubles--slight derangement\r\nof the cerebral functions and sensations, etc. Obstinate vomiting,\r\npeculiar desires, and changes of temper are some of the most frequent\r\ntroubles of pregnant women, and probably arise more from local nervous\r\nirritation than from general transformations of the nutrition of the\r\nbody. The mother's body is becoming adapted to the development of the\r\ninfant in the womb. However embarrassed a woman may be in the last\r\nmonths of pregnancy by the great swelling of the belly (Fig. 22) the\r\ndisorders are less accentuated than at the beginning of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nDuring pregnancy menstruation ceases. The sexual appetite is very\r\nvariable; in many pregnant women it is diminished, in others there is\r\nno change, and it is seldom increased. There are other troubles which\r\nare more or less frequent, such as varicose veins in the legs caused\r\nby pressure of the uterus on the veins.\r\n\r\nBut all the sufferings of pregnancy and childbirth are compensated for\r\nby the ardent desire of the normal woman to have a child, and by the\r\nhappiness of hearing its first cry. Proud and happy to give life to a\r\nnew human being, which she hopes soon to suckle and carry in her arms,\r\nshe cheerfully bears all the inconveniences and pains of pregnancy and\r\nchildbirth. The latter is actually painful, for in spite of all that\r\nnature does to relax the pelvis and render it elastic, to dilate the\r\nneck of the womb, the vagina and the vulva, the passage of the\r\nenormous head of a human infant through all these relatively narrow\r\napertures is extremely difficult (Figs. 22 and 23). The passage is\r\nforced by the powerful contractions of the muscles of the womb.\r\nHowever, they do not always succeed by themselves, and in this case\r\nthe accoucheur is obliged to apply the forceps to extract the head of\r\nthe child. Very often the neck of the womb, the vagina or the perineum\r\n(the part situated between the anus and the vulva) become torn during\r\nlabor, and this may lead later on to disorders such as prolapse of the\r\nwomb, etc.; disorders which may last through life.\r\n\r\nWhen the child is born, the umbilical cord (that is the transformed\r\nallantois, Fig. 23) cut, and the placenta extracted, the connecting\r\nnutrition and respiration between the child and its mother are\r\nsuddenly interrupted. Nourished hitherto by its mother's blood through\r\nthe placenta and the vessels of the umbilical cord which supplied the\r\nnecessary oxygen, the infant is suddenly obliged to breathe and feed\r\nfor itself. Its lungs, hitherto inactive, expand instantaneously under\r\nthe nervous influence produced by the blood saturated with carbonic\r\nacid, and the first cry is produced. Thus commences individual\r\nrespiration. Several hours later the cessation of maternal nutrition\r\ncauses hunger, and this the reflex movements of suction, and the child\r\ntakes the breast. During this time the empty womb contracts strongly\r\nand retracts enormously in a few days. The increase of blood produced\r\nby the maternal organism, by its adaptation to the nutrition of the\r\nembryo, is then employed in the production of milk in the breasts or\r\nlactiferous glands, which were already well developed during\r\npregnancy.\r\n\r\n=Suckling. Maternity.=--The mother is instinctively disposed to suckle\r\nher child as the infant is to suck. At the end of four to six weeks,\r\nthe womb has almost completely regained its former size.\r\n\r\nIn savage races suckling at the breast lasts for two years or more. It\r\nis useless to mention here to what point the capacity for suckling and\r\nthe production of milk have diminished among the modern women of\r\ncivilized countries. This sad sign of degeneration is due to a large\r\nextent, as _Bunge_ has shown by careful statistics, to the habit of\r\ntaking alcoholic drinks, and is combined with other blastophthoric\r\ndegenerations due to hereditary alcoholism. The future will show\r\nwhether the artificial feeding of infants with cows' milk will benefit\r\nhumanity. In any case it allows infants to survive who would die\r\nwithout it. On the other hand the development of a degeneration can\r\nhardly be an advantage for the species and we should hope for a return\r\nto the natural rule by abstinence from all alcoholic drinks.\r\n\r\nThe false modesty of women concerning their pregnancy and everything\r\nthat concerns childbirth, the pleasantries often made with regard to\r\npregnant women are a sad sign of the degeneration and even corruption\r\nof our refined civilization. Pregnant women ought not to hide\r\nthemselves, or to be ashamed to carry a child in their womb; on the\r\ncontrary they should be proud. Such pride would certainly be much more\r\njustified than that of the fine officers parading in their uniforms.\r\nThe external signs of the formation of humanity are more honorable to\r\ntheir bearers than the symbols of destruction, and woman should become\r\nimbued more and more with this truth! They will then cease to hide\r\ntheir pregnancy and to be ashamed of it. Conscious of the grandeur of\r\ntheir sexual and social duty they will raise aloft the standard of\r\nour descent, which is that of the true future life of man, at the same\r\ntime striving for the emancipation of their sex. Viewed in this way,\r\nthe sexual role of woman becomes elevated and solemn. Man should less\r\nand less maintain his indifference towards the social miseries to\r\nwhich the slavery of woman has led, which has lasted thousands of\r\nyears and which has dishonored the highest functions of her sex, by\r\nabuses without number.\r\n\r\nThe hygiene of pregnancy, labor and its sequels, is of the highest\r\nimportance. It certainly should not consist in exaggerated care and\r\nprecaution, for in spoiling and softening women by inaction more harm\r\nthan good is done. On the other hand, the social cruelty which\r\nneglects poor women of the people in confinement, often even without\r\ngiving them sufficient nourishment, is revolting, and it is here\r\nespecially that the reform of social hygiene becomes an elementary\r\nnecessity for humanity.\r\n\r\nAll that we have just spoken of binds the woman for months or years to\r\neach of her children, and we can understand that her whole soul is\r\nadapted in consequence to maternity. Even when birth has detached the\r\nchild from the maternal body, it remains attached to its mother by a\r\nhundred bonds, not only during the period of suckling, but long\r\nafterward when the conventions do not violate natural laws. Little\r\nchildren are deeply attached to their mother, and while the father is\r\nimpatient with their cries and the embarrassment which they cause, the\r\nmother takes a natural delight in them. When pregnancies succeed each\r\nother at reasonable intervals of one or two years, the normal woman\r\nlives with her children for many years in intimacy which never\r\nentirely ceases in a family animated by human and social sentiments.\r\n\r\nIn normal circumstances the special bonds which unite the mother to\r\nher children last for life, while the father, if all goes well,\r\nbecomes simply the best friend of his growing children. It is time\r\nthat fathers began to recognize these natural laws, instead of\r\nclinging so tenaciously to the historic and artificial prestige of a\r\nworm-eaten and unnatural patriarchal authority. No doubt there are\r\nmany pathological and degenerate mothers, but such an anomaly only\r\nproves the rule that we have just laid down.\r\n\r\n=Correlative Sexual Characters.=--The correlative sexual characters,\r\nwhich we have previously spoken of in animals, are well known in man.\r\nMan is in the average larger, broader in the shoulders and more\r\nrobust; his skeleton is more solid but his pelvis narrower. At the age\r\nof puberty, from 16 to 20 years, the beard grows on the face, while in\r\nthe pubic region hair develops in both sexes. At the same time the\r\ntesticles and external genital organs enlarge. The sexual glands as\r\nwell as the external genital organs have remained so far in an\r\nembryonic state although the mechanism of erection is already\r\nestablished in young boys. But this mechanism, in the normal boy, is\r\nnot associated with any voluptuous sensation or any glandular\r\nsecretion.\r\n\r\nMan possesses the rudiments of the correlative sexual characters of\r\nwoman, such as nipples without lactiferous glands, etc. In a general\r\nway each part of the external genital organs of one sex has its\r\ncorresponding embryonic homologue in the other, which is explained by\r\nthe different transformations which were originally the same in the\r\nembryo. The clitoris of woman corresponds to the penis of man, the\r\nlabia majora to the scrotum, etc. In certain individuals these\r\nrudiments are more strongly developed, and may by exaggeration and\r\ntransition lead to pathological hermaphrodism (Chapter I); such are\r\nbearded women, and those possessing a large clitoris, or beardless men\r\nwith effeminate bodies and small sexual organs. Such cases are not\r\nexamples of hermaphrodism, but of incomplete embryological\r\ndifferentiation. They consist in certain correlative sexual characters\r\nwhich show a tendency toward the other sex, a tendency which we find,\r\nfrom the mental point of view, in homosexuals.\r\n\r\nThere is also to be noticed the \"breaking\" of the voice which occurs\r\nin man at the age of puberty, and is connected with the nervous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIn women the body is smaller and more delicate, the bones weaker, the\r\npelvis wider and the chest narrower. The normal woman has no beard\r\nwhile the pubic hairs are the same as in man. The pubis, covered with\r\na layer of fat, is slightly prominent in women and is called the _mons\r\nVeneris_. There is more fat under the skin in a woman's body, and the\r\nvoice does not break. After puberty breasts develop with their\r\nlactiferous glands and nipples for suction. Puberty takes place a\r\nlittle earlier in women than in men, and corresponds to the growth of\r\nthe internal and external sexual organs, at the same time that the\r\novules commence to mature and menstruation is established.\r\n\r\nThe mental correlative sexual characters are much more important than\r\nthose of the body. The psychology of man is different from that of\r\nwoman. Many books have been written on this subject, usually with more\r\nsentimentality than exactitude. Mysogynists, like the philosopher\r\n_Schopenhauer_, disparage woman from all points of view, while the\r\nfriends of the female sex often exalt her in an exaggerated manner. In\r\ncontemporary literature we see women authors judging man in quite\r\ndifferent ways according as they are affected with \"misandery\" or\r\n\"philandery\"--that is enemies or friends of men. Quite recently\r\n_Moebius_ has published a mysogynistic work on the \"Physiological\r\nImbecility of Woman.\" (_Der physiologische Schwachsinn des Weibes_).\r\nOne must be a misogynist of very high degree to introduce the\r\npathological notion of imbecility into the evolution of the normal\r\nmentality of woman. In reality, the individual differences are much\r\ngreater in man and woman from the psychological than from the physical\r\npoint of view, so that they render a definition of the average\r\nextremely difficult.\r\n\r\nWe are acquainted with bearded women, athletic women, as well as\r\nbeardless men and puny men. From the mental point of view, there are\r\nalso viragos and men with feminine instincts. Imbeciles are not\r\nwanting in both sexes, but no reasonable person will deny that an\r\nintelligent woman is superior to a narrow-minded man even from the\r\npurely intellectual point of view. In spite of these difficulties, I\r\nshall attempt to bring forward the principal points which distinguish,\r\nin a general way, the masculine mind from the feminine, relying on my\r\nown observations and especially on the mental phenomena of both\r\nsexes.\r\n\r\n=The Weight of the Brain.=--According to statistics, the weight of the\r\nbrain in men of our race is on the average 1350 grammes, while that of\r\nwomen averages 1200 grammes. The absolute weight is, however, not of\r\nmuch importance, because part of the cerebral substance in the larger\r\nanimals is only for the supply of a greater number of cellular\r\nelements of the rest of the body, which necessitates a greater number\r\nof nervous elements.\r\n\r\nTo make the matter clear, it is necessary to separate the weight of\r\nthe cerebral hemispheres from the other nervous centers, such as the\r\ncerebellum, corpora striata, the optic thalami, the mid-brain, the\r\npons Varolii, the medulla oblongata and the spinal cord, for these\r\ncenters constitute parts which are phylogenetically older, that is to\r\nsay, inherited from lower animal ancestors. Compared with the cerebral\r\nhemispheres, these nerve centers are relatively more important in\r\nother vertebrates than in man, and are in more constant proportion to\r\nthe size of the body, the muscular, glandular and sensory elements of\r\nwhich they supply. When the intelligence is about the same, they are,\r\ntherefore, compared with the cerebral hemispheres, much more developed\r\nin the larger than in the smaller animals. For example, they are very\r\nlarge in the ox, but small in mice. I have weighed a considerable\r\nnumber of human brains separated in this way with the following\r\nresults:\r\n\r\n  CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES         OTHER CEREBRAL CENTERS\r\n  Man 1060 grammes,  78.5%   |   290 grammes, 21.5%\r\n  Woman 955 grammes, 77.9%   |   270 grammes, 22.1%\r\n\r\nThus the cerebellum and basal ganglia are a little smaller in men than\r\nin women, compared with the cerebral hemispheres.\r\n\r\nThese figures appear to show that the cerebral hemispheres in woman\r\nare on the average a little smaller than in man, even proportionately\r\nto the stature; for, according to a general law in the animal kingdom,\r\nwoman being smaller, her cerebral hemispheres should be, with equal\r\nmentality, proportionately a little larger. There are, however, female\r\nbrains larger than many male brains, and the absolute and relative\r\nsize of the cerebral hemispheres does not give a complete measure of\r\nthe productive faculties. Remarkable men have been known to possess\r\nrather small brains and imbeciles heavy ones. We must not forget the\r\ngreat importance of the hereditary or engraphic predispositions of the\r\nnerve element or _neurone_, to certain activities and especially to\r\nwork in general, that is to say, their aptitude to produce energy, or\r\nif one prefers it, their disposition to \"will.\"\r\n\r\nIt is also interesting to consider the relationship of the frontal\r\nlobe to the rest of the cerebral hemispheres, the frontal lobe being\r\nwithout doubt the principal seat of intellectual activity. According\r\nto _Meynert_, the weight of the frontal lobe in man exceeds that of\r\nwoman, not only absolutely, but relatively to the rest of the brain.\r\nIn his _résumé_ of the statistical data collected on this subject and\r\nfrom the results of my own material (autopsies at the asylum of\r\nBurgholzli in Zurich), _Mercier_ has confirmed the opinion of\r\n_Meynert_. The average weight of the hemispheres separated from the\r\nrest of the brain is 1019 grammes in man (frontal lobe 428, the rest\r\n591), and 930 in woman (frontal lobe 384, rest 546). Here, atrophied\r\nbrains (except general paralytics) have been weighed with others,\r\nwhich lowers the average total weight without altering the proportion.\r\nThus, the rest of the cerebral hemispheres exceeds the frontal lobe by\r\n163 grammes in man and 162 grammes in woman, which means that in man\r\nthe frontal lobe constitutes 42 per cent. of the cerebral hemispheres\r\nand in woman 41.3 per cent. The difference is not great, but it is\r\ndefinite, for it is based on a large number of observations.\r\n\r\n=Mental Capacity of the Two Sexes.=--The fundamental difference\r\nbetween the psychology of woman and that of man is constituted by the\r\nirradiations of the sexual sphere in the cerebral hemispheres, which\r\nconstitute what may be called _sexual mentality_. We shall discuss\r\nthis in the following chapters, for it constitutes the foundation of\r\nour subject. We are only concerned here with the correlative\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nAdhering in a general way to the main definitions of psychology, we\r\nassert that from the purely intellectual point of view, man\r\nconsiderably excels woman in his creative imagination, his faculty for\r\ncombination and discovery, and by his critical mind. For a long time\r\nthis was said to be explained by the statement that women had not the\r\nopportunity of measuring their intelligence against that of men; but,\r\nthanks to the modern movement of the emancipation of women, this\r\nassertion becomes more and more untenable. It is so with regard to\r\nartistic creations, for women have at all times taken part in works of\r\nart. When certain people maintain that a few generations of activity\r\nsuffice to elevate the intellectual development of women, they\r\nconfound the results of education with those of heredity and phylogeny\r\n(vide Chapter II). Education is a purely individual matter and only\r\nrequires one generation to produce its results. But neither mnemic\r\nengraphia, nor even selection can modify hereditary energies in two or\r\nthree generations. Tied down hitherto partly by servitude, the mental\r\nfaculties of woman will doubtless rise and flourish in all their\r\nnatural power as soon as they are absolutely free to develop in\r\nsociety equally with those of men, by the aid of equal rights. But\r\nwhat does not exist in the hereditary mneme, that is to say in the\r\nenergies of germs, inherited through thousands or millions of years,\r\ncannot be created in a few generations. The specific characters and\r\nconsequently the sexual characters have quite another constancy than\r\nis believed by the superficial prattlers, who deafen us with their\r\njargon on a question of which they only grasp the surface. There is no\r\nexcuse, at the present day, for confounding hereditary correlative\r\nsexual characters with the individual results of education. The latter\r\nare acquired by habit and can only be inherited as such by an\r\ninfinitesimal engraphia, possibly after hundreds of generations.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand woman possesses, from the intellectual point of\r\nview, a faculty of reception and comprehension as well as a facility\r\nof reproduction which are almost equal to those of man. In higher\r\neducation at the universities the women I have had the opportunity of\r\nobserving at Zurich for many years, show a more equal level than that\r\nof the men. The most intelligent men reproduce best and the most\r\nstupid men reproduce worse than the corresponding female extremes. I\r\ndo not think one can say much more concerning the purely intellectual\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nArtistic production confirms this opinion. Woman is here on the\r\naverage much inferior as regards creation or production, properly so\r\ncalled, and even her best results are wanting in originality and do\r\nnot open up new paths. On the contrary, as virtuosos, women compare\r\nwell with men in simply reproductive art. There are, however,\r\nexceptional women whose productions are original, creative and\r\nindependent. The philosopher _Stuart Mill_ points out the intuitive\r\ngift of woman who, led by her individual observations, rapidly and\r\nclearly discovers a general truth, and applies it in particular cases,\r\nwithout troubling with abstract theories. This may be called the\r\nintuitive or subconscious judgment of woman.\r\n\r\nIn the domain of sentiment the two sexes differ very much from each\r\nother, but we cannot say that one surpasses the other. Both are\r\npassionate, but in different ways. The passions of man are coarser and\r\nless durable, and are only more elevated when associated with more\r\noriginal and more complex intellectual aims. In woman sentiment is\r\nmore delicate and more finely shaded esthetically and morally; it is\r\nalso more durable, at least on the average, although its objects are\r\noften of a mean and banal nature.\r\n\r\nWhen man compares himself with woman he usually identifies himself,\r\nmore or less unconsciously, with the highest male intellects, with the\r\nmen of genius in art and science, and complaisantly ignores the crowd\r\nof idiots of his own sex! In the life of sentiment the two sexes may\r\ncomplement each other admirably; while man raises the height of the\r\nideal and of objects to be attained, woman has the necessary tact to\r\nsoften and refine the tones, and to adapt their shades to each special\r\nsituation, by the aid of her natural intuition, where man risks\r\nspoiling everything by the violence of his passions and his efforts.\r\nThis reciprocal influence should conduce to the best and highest\r\nharmony of sentiments in a happy sexual combination.\r\n\r\nAs regards will power, woman is, in my opinion, on the average\r\nsuperior to man. It is in this psychological domain more than in any\r\nother, that she will always triumph. This is generally misunderstood,\r\nbecause men have so far apparently held the scepter of an unlimited\r\nomnipotence; because by the abuse of brute force, aided by superiority\r\nof inventive genius, humanity has been hitherto led by strong\r\nmasculine wills, and because the strongest feminine wills have been\r\ndominated by the law of the right of the stronger. But the\r\nunprejudiced observer is soon obliged to recognize that the directive\r\nwill of the family is only, in general, represented externally by the\r\nmaster. Man parades his authority much more often than he puts it into\r\npractice; he lacks the perseverance, tenacity and elasticity which\r\nconstitute the true power of will, and which are peculiar to woman. It\r\nis needless to say that I am only speaking of the average and that\r\nthere are many women whose will power is feeble. But these easily\r\nbecome the prey of prostitution, which causes their disappearance.\r\nThis is perhaps one of the causes which have strengthened by selection\r\nthe will power in women. Man is impulsive and violent as regards his\r\nwill power, but often inconstant and irresolute, yielding as soon as\r\nhe has to strive persistently for a certain object. From these facts\r\nit naturally results that, on the average, it is the man in the family\r\nwho provides the ideas and impulses, but the woman who, with the\r\nfinesse of her tact and perseverance, instinctively makes the\r\ndistinction between the useful and the harmful, utilizing the former\r\nand constantly combating the latter; not because she is fundamentally\r\nsuperior, but because she is more capable of dominating herself, which\r\nproves the superiority of her will power.\r\n\r\nNothing is more unjust than to disparage one sex relatively to the\r\nother. The parthenogenesis of the lower animals having ceased in the\r\nvertebrates, each sex is indispensable, not only to the preservation\r\nof species, but also to each conception or reproduction of the\r\nindividual. Both are thus equivalent and belong to each other as the\r\ntwo halves of a whole, one being incapable of resisting without the\r\nother. Everything which benefits one of the halves benefits the other.\r\nIf by the magic wand of a fairy, the male half or the female half of\r\nour humanity, such as it is to-day, was rendered capable and obliged\r\nto reproduce alone, men would soon degenerate owing to the weakness of\r\ntheir will combined with their sensual passions, and women from their\r\nincapacity to raise their intellectual level by means of creative\r\nideas.\r\n\r\nWe need not dwell here on the numerous psychological peculiarities of\r\nwoman, inherent in her capacity as mother, nor on those of man\r\nadapted to his muscular strength and to his capacity as protector of\r\nthe family. These are derived from sexual differences which are\r\nmentioned in Chapter V. Nor need we describe correlative differences\r\nof less importance which are well known and which arise from those of\r\nwhich we have spoken or from direct sexual differences. They can be\r\nobserved, on the one hand, in purely male reunions in saloons, smoking\r\nrooms and other similar places; on the other hand, in feminine circles\r\nof all classes, among the common people, among the fashionable, or\r\neven in philanthropic associations. On the average, woman is more\r\nartful and more modest; man coarser and more cynical, etc. After much\r\npersonal experience, gained in societies in which the two sexes\r\npossess the same rights and are admitted to the same titles, I am\r\nobliged to declare that I have never found any confirmation (at least\r\nin the German-Swiss country) of the popular saying that gossip and\r\nintrigue are the special appanage of woman. I have found these two\r\nvices quite as often in man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE SEXUAL APPETITE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we sum up the three preceding chapters we arrive at the\r\nphilosophical conclusion that reproduction depends on the general\r\nnatural tendency of all living beings to multiply indefinitely.\r\nFission and sexual reproduction arise from the simple fact that the\r\ngrowth of each individual is necessarily limited in space as well as\r\ntime. Reproduction is thus destined to assure the continuation of\r\nlife; the individual dies but is perpetuated in his progeny. We do not\r\nknow why the crossing of individuals is rendered necessary by the\r\nphenomenon of conjugation. On this subject we can only build\r\nhypotheses, but the study of nature shows us that where conjugation\r\nceases reproduction is etiolated and finally disappears, even when it\r\nis still possible for a certain time.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of life there is thus a powerful law of\r\nattraction with the object of reproduction. At first there are\r\nunicellular organisms, in which one cell penetrates the other in the\r\nact of conjugation. Their substances combine intimately, while the\r\nmolecules of each nucleus become so arranged as to give the new\r\nindividual a more fresh and powerful energy of growth.\r\n\r\nIn the lower multicellular plants and animals which bud, fresh buds\r\nlive at the expense of the old trunk to give life to new branches, and\r\nthe male cells or pollen fecundate the female cells so as to disperse\r\nthe germs capable of growth and of thus reproducing the species. It is\r\nalso the same in the madrepores and other agglomerated animals (such\r\nas the solitary worms), composed of parameres or metameres, so long as\r\na single central nervous system does not coordinate the metameres, or\r\nprimary agglutinated animals, into a single organism.\r\n\r\nIn the higher animals, the complex polycellular individuals formed by\r\nthe agglomeration of several primitive animals, are transformed into a\r\nhigher and mobile unity by the aid of the great vital apparatus called\r\nthe nervous system, which becomes the mental director of the living\r\norganism and invests it with its individual character. However, this\r\nhigher unity of life, which always becomes more psychic, that is to\r\nsay, at the same time intellectual, sentimental and voluntary, by its\r\ncomplication and its numerous relations with other individuals, this\r\nunity called the _central nervous system_ cannot do without the\r\nnecessity for reproduction. In animal phylogeny, as soon as\r\nhermaphrodism has ceased and each individual has become the sole\r\nbearer of one of the two kinds of sexual cells, the species will\r\neventually disappear if the male cells cannot reach the female cells\r\nby the active movement of the whole individual. Thus is produced the\r\nmarvelous phenomenon of the desire of increase and reproduction,\r\noriginally peculiar to the male cell, penetrating the nervous system,\r\nthat is to say life and soul in its entirety, the life of the higher\r\nunity of the individual. An ardent desire, a powerful impulse thus\r\narises in the nervous system at the time of puberty and attracts the\r\nindividual toward the opposite sex. The care and the pleasure of self\r\npreservation, which had hitherto fully occupied his attention, become\r\neffaced by this new impulse. The desire to procreate dominates\r\neverything. A single pleasure, a single desire, a single passion lays\r\nhold of the organism and urges it toward the individual of the\r\nopposite sex, and to become united with it in intimate contact and\r\npenetration. It is as if the nervous system or the whole organism felt\r\nas if it had for the moment become a germinal cell, so powerful is the\r\ndesire to unite with the other sex.\r\n\r\nIn some beautiful verses the German poet-philosopher _Goethe_\r\n(West-Oestlicher Divan, book VIII, \"Suleika\") describes the desire to\r\nprocreate (p. 63):\r\n\r\n    Und mit eiligem Bestreben\r\n    Sucht sich, was sich angehört,\r\n    Und zu ungemessnem Leben\r\n    Ist Gefühl und Blick gekehrt.\r\n    Sei's ergreifen, sei es raffen,\r\n    Wenn es nur sich fasst und hält!\r\n    Allah braucht nicht mehr zu schaffen,\r\n    Wir erschaffen seine Welt!\r\n\r\nIf we look at nature we see everywhere the same desire and the same\r\nattraction of the sexes for each other; the bird which warbles, the\r\nmammal which ruts, the insect which hums while pursuing the female\r\nwith implacable tenacity, at the risk of their own life, employing\r\nsometimes cunning, sometimes dexterity, and sometimes force to attain\r\ntheir object. The ardor of the female is not always much less, but she\r\nuses coquetry, pretending to resist, and simulates repulsion. The more\r\neager the male, the more coquettish is the female. If we observe the\r\namorous sport of butterflies and birds, we see what efforts it costs\r\nthe male to attain his object. On the other hand when the male is\r\nclumsy and slow the female often comes toward him or at any rate does\r\nnot resist him, for instance in certain ants the males of which are\r\nwingless while the females have wings. The final act always consists\r\nin intimate union at the moment of copulation.\r\n\r\nIn some animals Nature is prodigal in the means she employs to pursue\r\nher great object, reproduction, by aid of the sexual appetite. The\r\napiary raises hundreds of male bees. As soon as the single queen-bee\r\ntakes wing for its nuptial flight all the males follow, but a single\r\nmale only, the strongest and most nimble, succeeds in reaching her. In\r\nthe intoxication of copulation he abandons all his genital organs to\r\nthe body of the queen and dies. The other males, now useless, are all\r\nmassacred in autumn by the working bees.\r\n\r\nSexual connection among butterflies of the Bombyx family is no less\r\nmarvelous. They live for months as caterpillars and sometimes for two\r\nyears as chrysalids, hibernating in a cocoon in some corner of the\r\nearth or in the bark of trees. Finally the butterfly, brilliantly\r\ncolored, emerges from the cocoon and spreads its wings. It only\r\npossesses, however, a rudimentary intestinal canal for the short life\r\nwhich remains, for it does not require much nourishment and is only\r\ndevoted to sexual connection. The female remains quiet and waits. The\r\nmale, furnished with large antennæ which perceive the odor of the\r\nfemale at a distance of several kilometers, commences an infatuated\r\nflight through the woods and fields, as soon as his wings are\r\nsufficiently strong. His sole object is to reach the female. Here\r\nagain there are numerous competitors. The one who arrives first\r\npossesses the female, but expires shortly afterward. His competitors\r\ndie also, exhausted by their long flight and by starvation, but\r\nwithout having attained their object. After copulation, the female\r\nsearches for the green plants which will ensure a long caterpillar\r\nlife for her offspring. There she deposits her fecundated eggs in\r\nconsiderable numbers and then expires in her turn, like a faded flower\r\nwhich has fulfilled the object of its existence and falls after\r\nleaving the fruit in its place.\r\n\r\nThe French naturalist _Fabre_ has described these phenomena, relying\r\non conclusive experiments, and my own observations and those of other\r\nnaturalists confirm them fully. Among the ants, all the males die\r\nalso, soon after an aërial nuptial flight, in which copulation is\r\ngenerally polyandrous, one male hardly waiting for the preceding one\r\nto discharge his semen before taking his place. Here the female\r\npossesses a receptacle for semen which often contains the sperm of\r\nmany males, and which allows it to fecundate the eggs one after\r\nanother for several years as she lays them, and thus to act as the\r\nmother of an ant's nest during a period which may extend to eleven or\r\ntwelve years, or even more.\r\n\r\nIn the lower organisms, love consists only in sexual instinct or\r\nappetite. As soon as the function is accomplished love disappears. It\r\nis only in the higher animals that we see a more or less durable\r\nsympathy develop between the two sexes. However, here also and even in\r\nman the sexual passion intoxicates for the moment all the senses. In\r\nhis sexual rut even man is dominated as by a magic influence, and for\r\nthe time he sees the world only under the aspect inspired by this\r\ninfluence. The object loved appears to him under celestial colors,\r\nwhich veil all the defects and miseries of reality. Each moment of his\r\namorous feeling inspires sentiments which it seems to him should last\r\neternally. He swears impossible things and believes in immortal\r\nhappiness. A reciprocal illusion transforms life momentarily into\r\nmirages of paradise. The most common things, and even certain things\r\nwhich usually disgust him, are then the object of the most violent\r\ndesire. But, as soon as the orgasm is ended and the appetite satisfied\r\nthe feeling of satiety appears. A curtain falls on the scene, and, at\r\nleast for the moment, repose and reality reappear.\r\n\r\nSuch are, in a few words, the general phenomena of the normal sexual\r\nappetite among sexual organisms in the whole of living nature. I am\r\nnot speaking here of degenerations, such as onanism and prostitution.\r\nLet us now analyze this appetite further.\r\n\r\nThe natural appetites are inherited instincts the roots of which lie\r\nfar back in the phylogenetic history of our ancestors. Hunger forms\r\nthe basis for the preservation of the individual, the sexual appetite\r\nthat for the preservation of the species, as soon as reproduction\r\ntakes place by separate sexes. All appetite belongs to the motor side\r\nof nervous activity; there is something internal which urges us to an\r\nact, but, on the other hand, one or more sensations may exist at the\r\nbase of this something to put it in action. I have proved, for\r\nexample, that the egg-laying instinct in the corpse fly (_Lucilia\r\ncæsar_) is only produced by the odor of putrefaction. As soon as the\r\nantennæ, which contain the organ of smell, are removed from these\r\nflies they cease to lay, while other more severe operations, or\r\nremoval of one antenna only does not produce this result.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of appetites is thus a lower mechanism and has its seat\r\nin the primitive nervous centers. As _Yersin_ has proved, a cricket\r\ndeprived of its brain may copulate so long as the sensory irritations\r\ncan reach the sexual nervous centers.\r\n\r\nWe can thus say that the mechanism of appetites belongs to automatic\r\nactions deeply inherited by phylogeny. Although complicated and\r\ncomposed of coördinated reflex movements which follow one another in\r\nregular succession, it has no actual power of modifying the so-called\r\nvoluntary acts, which depend entirely on the cerebral hemispheres, and\r\nof which we men only have a conscious feeling. The appetites are not\r\ncapable of adapting themselves to new circumstances and cease to be\r\nproduced when the chain is interrupted. We are obliged to admit that\r\nthe instincts or appetites are accompanied by a sub-conscious\r\nintrospection which, as such, can hardly enter into direct relation\r\nwith our higher consciousness, that is, with our ordinary\r\nconsciousness in the waking state.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, when their intensity increases, the appetites\r\novercoming the central nervous resistances, reach the cerebral\r\nhemispheres, and consequently our introspection or higher\r\nconsciousness, under a _synthetic or unified appearance_, and\r\ninfluence in a high degree the cerebral activities, which are\r\nreflected in association with all the elements of what we call our\r\nmind in the proper sense of the term, that is to say, our intellect,\r\nsentiments and will. It is from this point of view that sexual\r\nappetite must be considered in order to make it comprehensible. Love,\r\nwith all that appertains to it, belongs as such to our mind, that is,\r\nto the activity of our cerebral hemispheres, but it is produced there\r\nby a secondary irradiation from the sexual appetite, which alone\r\nconcerns us at present. We may also remark that sexual ideas when once\r\nawakened in the cerebral hemispheres by sexual appetite, are worked up\r\nthere by the attention, that is to say by concentrated cerebral\r\nactivity, then associated with other ideas, which on their side react\r\nstrongly on the sexual appetite, developing or paralyzing it,\r\nattracting or repelling it, or finally transforming its attributes and\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nBy sexual desire (libido sexualis) we mean the manner in which the\r\nsexual appetite manifests itself in man. Each term may be employed for\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n=The Sexual Appetite in Man.=--Man represents the active element in\r\nsexual union, and in him the sexual appetite, or desire for coitus, is\r\nat first the stronger. This desire develops spontaneously, and the\r\nrole of fecundator represents the principal male activity. This\r\nappetite powerfully affects the male mind, although sexual life plays\r\na less important part in him than in the female.\r\n\r\nIn boys, the sexual appetite is often prematurely awakened, excited in\r\nunnatural ways by bad example. Moreover, it varies enormously in\r\ndifferent individuals, a point to which we shall return when dealing\r\nwith pathology. Leaving aside unnatural appetites and abnormal forms\r\nof sexual instinct we shall describe here its most spontaneous and\r\nnormal form.\r\n\r\n=Puberty. Awakening of the Sexual Instinct in Boys.=--Sooner or later\r\nin different individuals, the boy pays attention to his erections,\r\nwhich are at first produced in a reflex and involuntary manner.\r\nMental development and reflection, so precocious in man, are causes\r\nwhich draw attention to the differences of the sexes before the sexual\r\nappetite is developed. It is, however, the first signs of this\r\nappetite which concentrate the attention on these differences, for in\r\ntheir absence, the boy is more indifferent to them than to the\r\nstraight or crooked form of a nose. Man has the habit of passing by\r\nwithout notice anything which does not interest him, and this is why\r\nwe find, in individuals whose sexual appetite is developed late or\r\nfeebly, an indifference and ignorance in these matters which appear\r\nalmost incredible to those whose sexual appetite is precocious and\r\nviolent; while, on the contrary, the lively interest which the latter\r\nshow in everything concerning the sexes appears foolish and absurd to\r\nthe sexually indifferent.\r\n\r\nThe pairing of animals, even of insects, awakens a curious interest in\r\nthose whose sexual dispositions are strong and precocious; they\r\ncomprehend very quickly the reason and are led to draw analogies with\r\ntheir own sensations in the same domain. The aspect of the female sex\r\nhas, however, a much stronger action still on the normal man. But here\r\nis produced a peculiar phenomenon. What especially excites the boy in\r\nthe aspect of the female sex is anything unusual; the sight of certain\r\nparts of the skin which are normally covered, the clothes or\r\nornaments, particular odors, women whom the boy is not accustomed to\r\nsee, etc. It is for this reason that brothers and sisters do not\r\nexcite, or excite very little, their reciprocal sexual appetite, at\r\nleast if there are no anomalies or exceptional exhibitions. The sexual\r\nappetites of boys among savage peoples who live naked is hardly at all\r\nexcited by naked girls; on the other hand, it is strongly excited by\r\nthose who are clothed or ornamented in a peculiar manner. The sexual\r\nappetite of a Mahometan is strongly excited by the nudity of the\r\nfeminine face, that of the European by that of a woman's legs, because\r\nwomen are accustomed to veil their faces in the first case and their\r\nlegs in the second. These are naturally only relative differences.\r\nWhen the sexual appetite of man is violent and unsatisfied woman\r\nexcites it in a general way, if she is not too old or repulsive.\r\n\r\nA second important character of the normal sexual appetite is the\r\nspecial attraction that appearances of health and strength in woman\r\nproduce in man. Healthy forms, normal odors, a normal voice, a skin\r\nhealthy in appearance and to the touch, constitute attractions which\r\ncharm and excite man, while all that is unhealthy or faded, every\r\npathological odor, produce a repulsive effect and hinders or\r\ndiminishes sexual desire.\r\n\r\nEverything connected with the sexual organs, their appearance, touch\r\nand odor, tend to excite the sexual appetite, all the more when they\r\nare usually covered; it is the same with the breasts.\r\n\r\nThe first sexual sensations are of a quite indeterminate nature;\r\nsomething unconscious and obscure inclines the boy toward the female\r\nsex and makes it appear desirable. A boy may thus become enamored of\r\nthe portrait of a woman with a swelling bosom and alluring eyes and be\r\nseized with desire, either at their sight or only on remembrance. This\r\ndesire is not concentrated especially on the sexual act, as with an\r\nadult who is already experienced in these matters; it is more\r\ngeneralized and vague, although sensual.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, these repeated aspirations, impulses and desires,\r\nremain unsatisfied. In different individuals the imagination\r\nassociates the most diverse images with such manifestations of the\r\nsexual appetite. The objects of the latter appear in dreams and\r\nprovoke nocturnal erections. The boy soon remarks a sensory\r\nlocalization of his appetites in his sexual organs, especially in the\r\nglans penis, but also in the surrounding parts, and the known or only\r\nvaguely defined image of the female sexual organs, which is hardly\r\npresent at the first appearance of his desires, begin to excite him\r\nmore and more.\r\n\r\nIn natural or savage man, as well as in animals, the boy then makes\r\nattempts at coitus and soon attains his object, for, in the state of\r\nnature, man marries as soon as puberty is attained.\r\n\r\n=Nocturnal Emissions.=--In civilized man such difficulties are opposed\r\nto marriage, that he replaces it by prostitution, or by more or less\r\nunnatural means, as soon as his sexual appetite becomes strong. In\r\nthose who abstain, the images produced by sexual excitation, combined\r\nwith erections, act more strongly during sleep than waking and\r\nproduce ejaculations of semen called nocturnal emissions or\r\npollutions. These generally occur during erotic dreams, and as the\r\ndreams produce the illusion of real perception, in quality as well as\r\nin intensity, it is not surprising that they are followed by an orgasm\r\nand ejaculation of semen.\r\n\r\n=Masturbation.=--In the waking state the unsatisfied sexual appetite\r\nmay produce such excitation that the boy applies friction to the glans\r\npenis, which cause voluptuous sensations. As soon as he has made this\r\ndiscovery he repeats the act and provokes ejaculation of semen\r\nartificially. Thus arises the bad habit of masturbation or onanism, a\r\nhabit which is both depressing and exhausting, which takes an\r\nincreasing hold on those who practice it. Although from the purely\r\nmechanical point of view masturbation causes a more normal ejaculation\r\nthan nocturnal emissions, which are often interrupted by awakening and\r\nthe vanishing of the dream which produced them, it has a much more\r\nharmful effect, by its frequency and especially by its depressing\r\naction on sentiment and will. We shall return to this subject in\r\nChapter VIII.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of semen in the seminal vesicles strongly excites the\r\nsexual appetite of man, and he is momentarily satisfied by their\r\nevacuation. But we shall soon see that this purely organic or\r\nmechanical excitation, which seems at first to be only adapted for\r\nnatural wants, does not in man play the principal role. We can easily\r\nunderstand that it cannot be the principal moving power of the sexual\r\nact. In fact, for any of the animals in which copulation occurs, the\r\npossibility of accomplishing this is not connected solely with the\r\naccumulation of semen, for it depends on obtaining a female. It is\r\nnecessary, therefore, for the accumulated semen to wait, and for the\r\nperception of the female by the aid of the senses to excite the male\r\nto coitus.\r\n\r\n=External Signs of the Sexual Appetite.=--Like every other desire the\r\nsexual appetite betrays itself by the physionomy. This consists in the\r\nplay of cerebral activity, that is the thoughts, sentiments and\r\nresolutions, on the muscles by means of motor nerves and nerve\r\ncenters. It is not limited to the face but extends to the whole body.\r\nThe abdomen, the hands and even the feet have their physionomy; that\r\nof the muscles of the face and eyes is, however, the most active and\r\nmost expressive. Sexual desire betrays itself in looks, by the\r\nexpression of the face and by certain movements in the presence of the\r\nfemale sex. Men differ greatly in the way in which they betray or hide\r\ntheir sentiments and thoughts by the play of their muscles, so that\r\nthe inner self is not always reflected without. Moreover, the\r\nexpression of sexual desire by the play of the physionomy may be\r\nconfounded with that of other sentiments, so that one who appears\r\nlibidinous is not always so in reality, and inversely.\r\n\r\n=Continence in Man.=--Abstinence or sexual continence is by no means\r\nimpracticable for a normal young man of average constitution,\r\nassiduous in intellectual and physical work, abstaining from all\r\nartificial excitations, especially from all narcotics and alcohol in\r\nparticular, for these substances paralyze the judgment and will. When\r\nsexual maturity is complete, that is after about twenty years,\r\ncontinence is usually facilitated by nocturnal emissions accompanied\r\nby corresponding dreams. The health does not suffer from these in any\r\nway. However, in the long run this state cannot be considered as\r\nnormal, especially when there is no hope of it coming to an end in a\r\nreasonable time. What is much more abnormal are the numerous\r\nartificial sexual excitations that civilization brings with it.\r\n\r\n=Sexual Power.=--The individual variations in the sexual instinct are\r\nenormous, and may be said to vary from zero to an intense and\r\nperpetual excitation called _Satyriasis_. By sexual power is\r\nunderstood the faculty of accomplishing coitus. This power in the\r\nfirst place requires strong and complete erections, as well as the\r\nfaculty of following them by frequent seminal ejaculations, without\r\nbeing precipitate. Impotence or incapacity for coitus belongs to\r\npathology and consists usually in the absence or defectiveness of\r\nerections. Sexual power and appetite generally go together, but not\r\nalways, for it is possible to be powerful with feeble sexual appetite,\r\nand intense appetite sometimes goes with impotence; the latter\r\ncondition, it is true, is pathological. Sexual power also varies so\r\nmuch in individuals that it is hardly possible to fix a limit between\r\nthe normal and the pathological.\r\n\r\nThe sexual power and appetite in man are strongest on the average\r\nbetween 20 and 40 years, especially between 25 and 35. But, while\r\nyoung men of 18 to 20 years or more may be still tranquil, without\r\nhaving had seminal ejaculations, one often finds, among races who\r\nmature earlier, boys of 12 or 16 who are fully developed both in\r\nsexual power and appetite. In our Aryan races, however, when this\r\noccurs before the age of 14, it is a case of pathological precocity.\r\nThe late appearance of sexual power and appetite is rather a sign of\r\nstrength and health.\r\n\r\nAfter the age of 40, the sexual power slowly diminishes, and after the\r\nseventieth year, or even before this, becomes extinct. Exceptionally\r\none finds old men of 80 who are still capable. Normally the sexual\r\nappetite diminishes with age; often, however, especially when it is\r\nartificially excited, it lasts longer than sexual power.\r\n\r\nAs regards sexual power we must distinguish between that of copulation\r\nand that of fecundation. The power may exist without the latter, when\r\nthe testicles have ceased to functionate, while the other glands, in\r\nparticular the prostate, second the venereal orgasm by their\r\nsecretion, when the power of erection is still preserved. Inversely,\r\nthe testicles may contain healthy spermatozoa in the impotent. In this\r\ncase artificial fecundation by the syringe is practicable.\r\n\r\n=Individual Variations in Sexual Power.=--The fact that there are men\r\nwho for several years can copulate several times a day proves to what\r\nextent sexual power varies in man. Sexual excitation and desire may\r\nsometimes attain such a degree that they are repeated a few minutes\r\nafter ejaculation. It is not rare for a man to perform coitus ten or\r\nfifteen times in a single night, in brothels and elsewhere, although\r\nsuch excess borders on the domain of pathology. I know a case in which\r\ncoitus was performed thirty times. I was once consulted by an old\r\nwoman of 65 who complained of the insatiable sexual appetite of her\r\nhusband, aged 73! He awakened her every morning at three o'clock to\r\nhave connection, before going to work. Not content with this, he\r\nrepeated the performance every evening and often also after the\r\nmid-day meal. Inversely, I have seen healthy looking husbands, at the\r\nage of greatest sexual power, accuse themselves of excess for having\r\ncohabited with their wives once a month or less. The reformer,\r\n_Luther_, who was a practical man, laid down the average rule of two\r\nor three connections a week in marriage, at the time of highest sexual\r\npower. I may say that my numerous observations as a physician have\r\ngenerally confirmed this rule, which seems to me to conform very well\r\nto the normal state to which man has become gradually adapted during\r\nthousands of years.\r\n\r\nHusbands who would consider this average as an imprescriptible right\r\nwould, however, make wrong pretensions, for it is quite possible for a\r\nnormal man to contain himself much longer, and it is his duty to do\r\nso, not only when his wife is ill, but also during menstruation and\r\npregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe question of sexual relations during pregnancy is more difficult,\r\non account of its long duration. In this case caution is necessary,\r\nbut total abstinence from sexual connection is, in my opinion,\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\n=The Desire of Change in Man.=--A peculiarity of the sexual appetite\r\nin man, which is fatal for society, is his desire for change. This\r\ndesire is not only one of the principal causes of polygamy, but also\r\nof prostitution and other analogous organizations. It arises from the\r\nwant of sexual attraction in what one is accustomed to and from the\r\nstronger excitation produced by all that is new; a phenomenon of which\r\nwe have spoken above. On the average, woman has a hereditary\r\ndisposition which is much more monogamous than man. The sexual\r\nappetite thus loses its intensity from the prolonged habit of\r\nconnection with the same woman, but, becomes much more intense with\r\nother women, if not in all men at any rate in most. Such desires may\r\ngenerally be overcome by the aid of a true and noble love, and by\r\nsentiments of duty and fidelity toward the family and toward a\r\nrespected wife. We cannot, however, deny that they exist, nor that\r\nthey are the cause of the worst excesses, and the most violent scenes,\r\noften with a tragic result. We shall return to this subject later.\r\n\r\n=Excitation and Cooling of the Sexual Appetite.=--Without touching the\r\ndomain of pathology, I must again dwell on the great individual\r\ndiversity of the objects of the male sexual appetite. It is usually\r\nyoung but mature female forms of healthy appearance, and especially\r\nthe sight of the nudity of certain parts of the body which are usually\r\ncovered, particularly the breasts and sexual organs, which most\r\nstrongly excite the sexual appetite in man. It is the same with the\r\ncorresponding odors. The voice, the physionomy, the clothing and many\r\nother details may also provoke his desires. There are, however, men\r\nwho are more excited by thin and pale women.\r\n\r\nCertain attributes excite one and not another; for instance, the hair,\r\ncertain odors, certain forms of face, a certain fashion of clothing,\r\nthe form of the breasts, etc. The peculiarities, which are absent in\r\nwomen with whom a man has been on familiar terms in his youth are\r\ngenerally those which attract the most. In sexual matters contrasts\r\ntend to mutual attraction. Thin people often become enamored of fat,\r\nshort ones of long ones, and inversely. One cannot, however, fix any\r\nrules. One often sees young men excited at the sight of women of older\r\nage, and old men enamored of very young women, even of children. All\r\nthese discrepancies constitute the more important points of origin of\r\nsexual pathology. In spite of all, there still exist a great number of\r\ntranquil men with monogamous instincts and not fond of change. Lastly,\r\nwe must not forget that super-abundant feeding and idleness exalt the\r\nsexual appetite and tend to polygamy, while hard work, especially\r\nphysical, and frugal diet diminish it.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the mental qualities react powerfully on\r\nthe sexual appetite. A quarrelsome temper, coldness and repulsion on\r\nthe part of a woman cool the desires of the man, while an ardent\r\nsexual desire on the part of the woman, her love and tenderness, tend\r\nto increase and maintain them. We are dealing here with purely animal\r\nsexual instinct, and we may state that the sexual appetite of woman\r\ngenerally excites strongly that of man, and considerably increases his\r\npleasure during coitus. There are, however, exceptions in the inverse\r\nsense, in which coldness and disgust on the part of the woman excite\r\nthe passion of certain men, who have, however, no taste for libidinous\r\nwomen. All degrees are found in this domain.\r\n\r\nActive in the sexual act the man desires corresponding sentiments in\r\nthe woman. But, on the other hand, all want of natural reserve, and\r\ndelicate sentiment, and all cynical sexual provocation on the part of\r\na woman, produce in the normal man a repulsive effect. The normal\r\nwoman possesses an admirable instinct in these matters and knows how\r\nto betray her feelings in a sufficiently fine and delicate manner, so\r\nas not to hurt those of the man.\r\n\r\nA phenomenon, which we shall meet with in Chapter VIII, under the name\r\nof _psychic impotence_, shows the powerful and disturbing interference\r\nof thoughts on the automatic action of instinctive sexual activity. A\r\nmomentary psychic impotence is not necessarily pathological. While\r\nvoluptuous sensations alternate during coitus with desire and\r\ncorresponding erotic representations, a sudden idea of the\r\nridiculousness of the situation, signs of pain or of bad temper in the\r\nwoman, the idea of impotence or of the real object of coitus; finally,\r\nanything which acts as a contrast to the sensations and impulses of\r\ncoitus, may interrupt it, so that the voluptuous sensations and sexual\r\nappetite disappear and erection subsides. Voluntary efforts are often\r\nincapable of putting things right again. The charm is broken, and only\r\nnew images and new sentiments associated instinctively with the sexual\r\nappetite can be reëstablished, by making the subconscious state\r\npreponderate over the reasoning consciousness.\r\n\r\n=Influence of Modern Civilization. Pornography.=--Human sexuality has\r\nbeen unfortunately perverted and in part grossly altered by\r\ncivilization, which has even developed it artificially in a\r\npathological sense. The point has been reached of considering as\r\nnormal, relations which are in reality absolutely abnormal. For\r\nexample, it is maintained that prostitution produces normal coitus in\r\nman. How can this term be seriously employed in speaking of connection\r\nwith a prostitute who is absolutely indifferent to it, and who seeks\r\nonly to excite her clients artificially and to get their money,\r\nwithout mentioning venereal diseases which she so often presents them\r\nwith! Forgetful of the natural aim of the sexual appetite,\r\ncivilization has transformed it into artificial enjoyment, and has\r\ninvented all possible means to increase and diversify it.\r\n\r\nAs far back as the history of civilization goes we see this state of\r\naffairs, and in this sense we are neither better nor worse than our\r\nancestors. But we possess more diverse and more refined measures than\r\nbarbarian peoples, and than our direct ancestors, to satisfy our\r\nunwholesome desires. Modern art in particular often serves to excite\r\neroticism, and we must frankly admit that it often descends to the\r\nlevel of pornography. Hypocritical indignation against those who dare\r\nto say this often serves only to cover in the name of art the most\r\nindecent excitants of eroticism.\r\n\r\nPhotography and all the perfected methods of reproduction of pictures,\r\nthe increasing means of travel which facilitate clandestine sexual\r\nrelations, the industrial art which ornaments our apartments, the\r\nincreasing luxury and comfort of dwellings, beds, etc., are, at the\r\npresent day, so many factors in the science of erotic voluptuousness.\r\nProstitution itself has become adapted to all the pathological\r\nexcrescences of vice. In a word, the artificial culture of the human\r\nsexual appetite has given rise to a veritable high school of\r\ndebauchery. The artistic and realistic representations of erotic\r\nsexual scenes, so widespread at the present day, are much more capable\r\nof exciting the sexual appetite than the crude and unnatural pictures\r\nof former days, when, however, erotic objects of art generally\r\nbelonged to a few rich persons or to museums.\r\n\r\n=Influence of Repeated Sexual Excitations.=--The artificial and varied\r\nrepetition of sexual excitation, by means of objects which provoke it,\r\nincreases the sexual appetite. This cannot be doubted, for the law of\r\nexercise is a general truth in the physiology of the nervous system.\r\nThis law, which is also called the law of training, shows that every\r\nkind of nervous activity is increased by exercise. A man becomes a\r\nglutton by accustoming himself to eat too much, a good walker by\r\nexercising his legs. The habit of wearing fine clothes or of washing\r\nin cold water causes these things to become a necessity. By\r\ncontinually occupying ourselves with a certain thing, we take a liking\r\nfor it and often become virtuosos. By always thinking of a disease we\r\nare led to imagine that we suffer from it. A melody too often repeated\r\noften becomes automatic and we whistle or hum it unconsciously.\r\n\r\nInversely, inactivity weakens the effect of irritations which\r\ncorrespond to it. By neglecting certain activities or the provocation\r\nof certain sensations, these diminish in intensity, and we cease more\r\nand more to be affected by them. We become idle when we are inactive,\r\nfor the cerebral resistance accumulates, and idleness renders the\r\nrenewal of the corresponding activity more difficult. It is not\r\nsurprising, therefore, to find this law in the phenomena of the sexual\r\nappetite, which diminishes with abstinence and increases with repeated\r\nexcitation and satisfaction. However, another force, that of the\r\naccumulation of semen in the seminal vesicles, associated with an old\r\nnatural inherited instinct, often counteracts the law of exercise of\r\nthe nervous system, as the empty stomach excites the instinct of\r\nnutrition. But, however imperious the hunger, and however\r\nindispensable its satisfaction for the maintenance of life, this does\r\nnot impair the truth of the old saying, \"Appetite comes by eating.\"\r\n\r\nThe exaggerated desire for sleep experienced by idle people is an\r\nanalogous phenomenon. Although sufficient sleep is a necessity for\r\nhealthy and productive cerebral activity, an exaggerated desire for\r\nsleep may be artificially developed.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena are of fundamental importance in the question of the\r\nsexual appetite. Here, the well-known axiom of moderation which says,\r\n\"Abuse does not exclude use\" finds its application. An English\r\ncommentator on _Cicero_ erroneously attributes to him the following:\r\n\"True moderation consists in the absolute domination of the passions\r\nand appetites, as well as all wrong desires, by reason. It exacts\r\ntotal abstinence from all things which are not good and which are not\r\nof an absolutely innocent character.\" This definition is excellent,\r\nalthough it is not _Cicero's_. It excludes, for example, the use of a\r\ntoxic substance such as alcohol, which is not a natural food, but not\r\nthe moderate satisfaction of the sexual appetite which is normally\r\nintended for the preservation of the species, for this satisfaction\r\nmay be good or bad, normal or vicious, innocent or criminal, according\r\nto circumstances. In this connection, the application of the right\r\nmeasure, and choice of the appropriate object raise delicate and\r\ncomplicated questions. So-called moral sermons lead to nothing in this\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nAfter numerous personal observations made on very diverse individuals\r\nwho have consulted me with regard to sexual questions, I think I can\r\naffirm that when a man wishes to be loyal to himself he is generally\r\nable to distinguish between natural desire and artificial excitation\r\nof the sexual appetite. To be pursued and tormented by sexual images\r\nand desires, even when striving against them, and when the legitimate\r\nand normal occasion to satisfy them is absent, is not the same thing\r\nas to pass the time in inventing means of artificial excitement to\r\npleasure and orgy while leading an idle and egoistic life. I speak\r\nhere of the normal man and not of certain pathological states in which\r\nthe sexual appetite takes the character of a perpetual obsession, even\r\nagainst the will of the patient. By serious and persevering work and\r\nby avoiding all means of excitation, the sexual appetite can usually\r\nbe kept within the bounds of moderation.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned above pornographic art as one of the means which\r\nartificially excite the sexual appetite. Along with the interested\r\nexploitation of the habit of taking alcoholic drinks, exploitation of\r\nthe sexual appetite constitutes one of the largest fields of what may\r\nbe called _social brigandage_. Besides pornographic pictures, the\r\nprincipal means employed to artificially excite the sexual weaknesses\r\nof man are the following:\r\n\r\n_Pornographic novels_ in which sexual desire is excited by all the\r\nartifice of the novelist, and in which the illustrations often rival\r\nthose we have just spoken of to seduce the purchaser.\r\n\r\n_Alcohol_ which, by paralyzing the judgment and will as well as moral\r\ninhibitory sentiments, excites the sexual appetite and renders it\r\ngrossly impulsive. Its first fumes make man enterprising, and he falls\r\nan easy prey to proxenetism and prostitution, although it soon weakens\r\nthe sexual power.\r\n\r\nBut it is the modern arsenal of _prostitution_ which plays the\r\nprincipal role. The proxenets (pimps) exploit both the sexual\r\nappetites of men and the weakness and venality of women. Their chief\r\nsource of gain consisting in the artificial excitation of the male\r\nsexual appetite by all possible means, their art consists in dressing\r\ntheir merchandise, the prostitutes, with attractive refinement,\r\nespecially when dealing with rich clients who pay well. It is on this\r\nsoil that are cultivated the most disgusting artifices, intended to\r\nexcite even the most pathological appetites.\r\n\r\nOther causes are added to lucre, or are the consequences of it. A boy\r\nled to masturbation by pornographic pictures, or by the seduction of a\r\ncorrupted individual, becomes in his turn the seducer of his comrades.\r\nCertain libidinous and unscrupulous women have often persuaded\r\nadolescents and schoolboys to sleep with them, thus awakening\r\nprecocious and unhealthy sexual appetites.\r\n\r\nSuch habits which excite the sexual appetite and cause it to\r\ndegenerate artificially, develop in their turn a mode of sexual\r\nboasting in men, the effects of which are deplorable. To appear manly,\r\nthe boy thinks he ought to have a cigar in his mouth, even if it makes\r\nhim sick. In the same way the spirit of imitation leads youth to\r\nprostitution. The fear of not doing as the others and especially the\r\nterror of ridicule constitute a powerful lever which is abused and\r\nexploited. Fearing mockery, a youth is the more easily seduced by bad\r\nexample the less he is put on guard by parents or true friends.\r\nInstead of explaining to him in time, seriously and affectionately,\r\nthe nature of sexual connection, its effects and dangers, he is\r\nabandoned to the chance of the worst seductions.\r\n\r\nIn this way the sexual appetite is not only artificially increased and\r\noften directed into unnatural channels, but also leads to the\r\npoisoning and ruin of youth by venereal diseases, to say nothing of\r\nalcoholism.\r\n\r\nWe have referred especially to educated youth, but the youth of the\r\nlower classes are perhaps in a still worse condition, owing to the\r\npromiscuity of their life in miserable dwellings. They often witness\r\ncoitus between their parents, or are themselves trained in evil ways\r\nfor purposes of exploitation.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing that the results of such abominable deviation of the\r\nsexual appetite are not worse. No doubt excesses disturb the ties of\r\nmarriage and of the family, and often provoke impotence and other\r\ndisorders of the sexual functions. It must, however, be admitted that\r\ntheir satellites, the venereal diseases, and their most common\r\ncompanion, alcoholism, are in reality the greatest destroyers of\r\nhealth, and make much more considerable ravages in society than the\r\nartificial increase and abnormal deviations of the sexual appetite\r\nitself. However, the latter by themselves very often poison the mind\r\nand social morality, as we shall have occasion to see.\r\n\r\nImmoderate sexual desire, provoked in men by the artificial\r\nexcitations of prostitution, etc., is a bad acquisition. It renders\r\ndifficult the accustomance to marriage, fidelity and ideal and\r\nlife-long love for the same woman. It is true, that many old _roués_\r\nand _habitués_ of brothels later on become faithful husbands and\r\nfathers, especially when they have had the luck to escape venereal\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nBut whoever looks behind the scenes may soon convince himself that the\r\nhappiness of most unions of this kind is very relative. The\r\ndegradation of the sexual sentiment of a man who has long been\r\naccustomed to live with prostitutes is never entirely effaced, and\r\ngenerally leaves indelible traces in the human brain.\r\n\r\nI readily admit that a man with good hereditary dispositions, who has\r\nonly yielded for a short time to seductive influences, may be reformed\r\nby a true and profound love. But even in him, excesses leave traces\r\nwhich later on may easily lead him astray when he becomes tired of the\r\nmonotony of conjugal relations with the same woman. On the other hand,\r\nwe must also recognize that sexual relations in themselves, even in\r\nmarriage, create a habit which often urges a married man to\r\nextra-nuptial coitus, even when he had remained continent before\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nThe tricks which are played on a man by his sexual appetite,\r\nespecially by his polygamous instincts, must not, however, be\r\nconfounded with the systematic, artificial and abnormal training of\r\nthe same appetite. The physical and psychic attractions of a woman are\r\ncapable of completely diverting the sexual desires of a man from their\r\nprimary object, and of directing them on the siren who captivates his\r\nsenses. The elements of the sexual appetite here form an inextricable\r\nmixture with those of love, and constitute the inexhaustible theme of\r\nnovels and most true and sensational love stories.\r\n\r\nHereditary pathological dispositions play a considerable role in many\r\ncases of this kind. Also, marriages of sudden and passionate love (we\r\nare not dealing here with love marriages concluded after sufficient\r\nreflection and deep mutual acquaintanceship) are not more stable than\r\nthe so-called \"_mariages de convenance_,\" for passionate natures,\r\nusually more or less pathological, are apt to fall from one extreme to\r\nthe other. The power exercised by sexual passion in such cases is\r\nterrible. It produces conditions that may lead to suicide or\r\nassassination. In men whose power of reason is neither strong nor\r\nindependent, opinions and conceptions are frequently changed; love may\r\nchange to hatred and hatred to love, the sentiment of justice may lead\r\nto injustice, the loyal man may become a liar, etc. In fact the sexual\r\nappetite is let loose like a hurricane in the brain and becomes the\r\ndespot of the whole mind. The sexual passion has often been compared\r\nto drunkenness or to mental disease. Even in its mildest forms it\r\noften renders the husband incapable of sexual connection with his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nFor example, a man may cherish, respect and even adore his wife, and\r\nyet her presence and touch may not appeal to his senses, nor excite\r\nhis appetite or erection; while some low-minded woman will produce in\r\nhim an irresistible sensual attraction, even when he experiences\r\nneither esteem nor love for her. In such cases sexual appetite is in\r\nmore or less radical opposition to love. Such extreme phenomena are\r\nnot rare, but hardly common. Although excited to coitus with the woman\r\nin question, the husband would not in any case have her for wife, nor\r\neven have children by her, for after the slightest reflection he\r\ndespises and fears her. Here, the sexual appetite represents the old\r\natavistic animal instinct, attracted by libidinous looks, exuberant\r\ncharms, in a word by the sensual aspect of woman.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, in a higher domain of the human mind, the sentiments\r\nof sympathy of true love, deeply associated with fidelity, and with\r\nintellectual and moral intimacy, unite against the elementary power of\r\nthe animal instinct. Here we see dwelling in the same breast (or, to\r\nspeak more correctly, in the same central nervous system) two souls,\r\nwhich struggle with each other.\r\n\r\nWe are not dealing here with cases in which a new passion arrives to\r\nturn the man from his old affection. No doubt the extreme cases of\r\nwhich we have spoken are not usual, but we see in most men more or\r\nless considerable mixtures of analogous sentiments in all possible\r\ndegrees, especially when the woman loved loses her physical\r\nattractions from age or other causes.\r\n\r\n=The Procreative Instinct.=--The sexual appetite of man does not\r\nconsist exclusively in the desire for coitus. In many cases it is\r\ncombined, more or less strongly and more or less consciously, with the\r\ndesire to procreate children. Unfortunately, this desire is far from\r\nbeing always associated with higher sentiments and with love of\r\nchildren or the paternal instinct. In fact, conscious reasoning plays\r\na smaller part than the animal instinct of self-expansion. We shall\r\nsee later on that the procreative instinct often plays an important\r\nrole in our present civilization.\r\n\r\n=The Sexual Appetite in Woman.=--In the sexual act the role of the\r\nwoman differs from that of the man not only by being passive, but also\r\nby the absence of seminal ejaculations. In spite of this the analogies\r\nare considerable. The erection of the clitoris and its voluptuous\r\nsensations, the secretion from the glands of _Bartholin_ which\r\nresembles ejaculation in the male, the venereal orgasm itself which\r\noften exceeds in intensity that of man, are phenomena which establish\r\nharmony in sexual connection.\r\n\r\nAlthough the organic phenomenon of the accumulation of semen in the\r\nseminal vesicles is absent in woman, there is produced in the nerve\r\ncenters, after prolonged abstinence, an accumulation of sexual desire\r\ncorresponding to that of man. A married woman confessed to me, when I\r\nreproached her for being unfaithful to her husband, that she desired\r\ncoitus at least once a fortnight, and that when her husband was not\r\nthere, she took the first comer. No doubt the sentiments of this woman\r\nwere hardly feminine, but her sexual appetite was relatively normal.\r\n\r\n=Frequency of the Sexual Appetite in Woman.=--As regards pure sexual\r\nappetite, extremes are much more common and more considerable in woman\r\nthan in man. In her this appetite is developed much less often\r\nspontaneously than in him, and where it is so, it is generally later.\r\nVoluptuous sensations are usually only awakened by coitus.\r\n\r\nIn a considerable number of women the sexual appetite is completely\r\nabsent. For these, coitus is a disagreeable, often disgusting, or at\r\nany rate an indifferent act. What is more singular, at least for\r\nmasculine comprehension, and what gives rise to the most frequent\r\n\"quid pro quos,\" is the fact that such women, absolutely cold as\r\nregards sexual sensations, are often great coquettes, over-exciting\r\nthe sexual appetites of man, and have often a great desire for love\r\nand caresses. This is more easy to understand if we reflect that the\r\nunsatiated desires of the normal woman are less inclined toward coitus\r\nthan toward the assemblage of consequences of this act, which are so\r\nimportant for her whole life. When the sight of a certain man awakes\r\nin a young girl sympathetic desires and transports, she aspires to\r\nprocreate children with this man only, to give herself to him as a\r\nslave, to receive his caresses, to be loved by him only, that he may\r\nbecome both the support and master of her whole life. It is a question\r\nof general sentiments of indefinite nature, of a powerful desire to\r\nbecome a mother and enjoy domestic comfort, to realize a poetic and\r\nchivalrous ideal in man, to gratify a general sensual need distributed\r\nover the whole body and in no way concentrated in the sexual organs or\r\nin the desire for coitus.\r\n\r\n=Nature of the Sexual Appetite in Woman.=--The zone of sexual\r\nexcitation is less specially limited to the sexual organs in woman\r\nthan in man. The nipples constitute in her an entire zone and their\r\nfriction excites voluptuousness. If we consider the importance in the\r\nlife of woman, of pregnancy, suckling, and all the maternal functions,\r\nwe can understand why the mixture of her sentiments and sensations is\r\nso different from that of man. Her smaller stature and strength,\r\ntogether with her passive role in coitus, explain why she aspires to a\r\nstrong male support. This is simply a question of natural phylogenetic\r\nadaptation. This is why a young girl sighs for a courageous, strong\r\nand enterprising man, who is superior to her, whom she is obliged to\r\nrespect, and in whose arms she feels secure. Strength and skill in man\r\nare the ideal of the young savage and uncultured girl, his\r\nintellectual and moral superiority that of the young cultivated girl.\r\n\r\nAs a rule women are much more the slaves of their instincts and habits\r\nthan men. In primitive peoples, hardiness and boldness in men were\r\nqualities which made for success. This explains why, even at the\r\npresent day, the boldest and most audacious Don Juans excite most\r\nstrongly the sexual desires of women, and succeed in turning the heads\r\nof most young girls, in spite of their worst faults in other respects.\r\nNothing is more repugnant to the feminine instinct than timidity and\r\nawkwardness in man. In our time women become more and more\r\nenthusiastic over the intellectual superiority of man, which excites\r\ntheir desire. Without being indifferent to it, simple bodily beauty in\r\nman excites the appetite of women to a less extent. It is astonishing\r\nto see to what point women often become enamored of old, ugly or\r\ndeformed men. We shall see later on that the normal woman is much more\r\nparticular than man in giving her love. While the normal man is\r\ngenerally attracted to coitus by nearly every more-or-less young and\r\nhealthy woman, this is by no means the case in the normal woman with\r\nregard to man. She is also much more constant than man from the sexual\r\npoint of view. It is rarely possible for her to experience sexual\r\ndesire for several men at once; her senses are nearly always attracted\r\nto one lover only.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of procreation is much stronger in woman than in man, and\r\nis combined with the desire to give herself passively, to play the\r\npart of one who devotes herself, who is conquered, mastered and\r\nsubjugated. These negative aspirations form part of the normal sexual\r\nappetite of woman.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity of the sexual sentiments of woman is an ill-defined\r\npathological phenomenon with normal sensations, a phenomenon which in\r\nman, on the contrary, forms a very marked contrast with the latter; I\r\nrefer to the _homosexual_ appetite, in which the object is an\r\nindividual of the same sex. Normally, the adult man produces on\r\nanother man an absolutely repulsive effect from the sexual point of\r\nview; it is only pathological subjects, or those excited by sexual\r\nprivation who are affected with sensual desires for other men. But in\r\nwoman a certain sensual desire for caresses, connected more or less\r\nwith unconscious and ill-defined sexual sensations, is not limited to\r\nthe male sex but extends to other women, to children, and even to\r\nanimals, apart from pathologically inverted sexual appetites. Young\r\nnormal girls often like to sleep together in the same bed, to caress\r\nand kiss each other, which is not the case with normal young men. In\r\nthe male sex such sensual caresses are nearly always accompanied and\r\nprovoked by sexual appetite, which is not the case in women. As we\r\nhave already seen, man may separate true love from the sexual appetite\r\nto such an extent that two minds, each feeling in a different way, may\r\ninhabit the same brain. A man may be a loving and devoted husband and\r\nat the same time satisfy his animal appetites with prostitutes. In\r\nwoman, such sexual dualism is much more rare and always unnatural, the\r\nnormal woman being much less capable than man of separating love from\r\nsexual appetite.\r\n\r\nThese facts explain the singular caprices of the sexual appetite and\r\norgasm in the normal woman, in whom these phenomena are not easily\r\nproduced without love.\r\n\r\nThe same woman who loves one man and not another is susceptible to\r\nsexual appetite and voluptuous sensations when she cohabits with the\r\nfirst, while she is often absolutely cold and insensible to the most\r\npassionate embraces of the second. This fact explains the possibility\r\nof prostitution as it exists among women. The worst prostitutes, who\r\nhave connection with innumerable paying clients without feeling the\r\nleast pleasure, generally have a \"protector\" with whom they are\r\nenamored and to whom they devote all their love and sincere orgasms,\r\nall the time allowing themselves to be plundered and exploited by him.\r\n\r\nWhat the normal woman requires from man is love, tenderness, a firm\r\nsupport for life, a certain chivalrous nature, and children. She can\r\nrenounce the voluptuous sensations of coitus infinitely more easily\r\nthan the exigencies I have just indicated, which are for her the\r\nprincipal things. Nothing makes a woman more indignant than the\r\nindifference of her husband, when, for instance, he treats her simply\r\nas a housekeeper. Some have maintained that the average woman is more\r\nsensual than man, others that she is less so. Both these statements\r\nare false: she is sensual _in another manner_.\r\n\r\nAll the peculiarities of the sexual appetite in woman are thus the\r\ncombined product of: (1) the profound influence of the sexual\r\nfunctions on her whole existence; (2) her passive sexual role; (3) her\r\nspecial mental faculties. By these, and more especially by her passive\r\nsexual role, are explained her instinctive coquettishness, her love of\r\nfiery and personal adornment, in a word her desire to please men by\r\nher external appearance, by her looks, movements and grace. These\r\nphenomena betray the instinctive sexual desires of the young girl,\r\nwhich as we have just seen, do not normally correspond to a direct\r\ndesire for coitus.\r\n\r\nWhile a virgin experiences in her youth the sensations we have just\r\ndescribed, things change after marriage, and as a general rule after\r\nrepeated sexual connections. If these do not provoke voluptuous\r\nsensations in some women, they do in the majority, and this is no\r\ndoubt the normal state of affairs. Habit, then, produces an increasing\r\ndesire for coitus and its sensations, and it is not rare, in the\r\ncourse of a long life in common, for the roles to be reversed and the\r\nwoman become more libidinous than the man. This partly explains why so\r\nmany widows are anxious to remarry. They easily attain their object,\r\nas men quickly succumb to the sexual desire of woman when it is\r\nexpressed in an unequivocal manner.\r\n\r\nIn widows, two strong sentiments struggle against each other, with\r\nvariable results in different individuals; on the one hand, feminine\r\nconstancy in love, and the memory of the deceased; on the other hand,\r\nthe acquired habit of sexual connection and its voluptuous sensations,\r\nwhich leaves a void and appeals for compensation. The sexual appetite\r\nbeing equal, the first sentiment prevails generally in religious women\r\nor those of a deeply moral or sentimental character, while the second\r\nprevails in women of more material or less-refined nature, or in those\r\nsimply guided by their reason. In these internal struggles, the more\r\ndelicate sentiments and the stronger will of the woman result from the\r\nfact that when she wishes she can overcome her appetites much better\r\nthan man. But, in spite of this, the power of the sexual appetite\r\nplays an important part in the inward struggle we have just mentioned.\r\nWhen this appetite is absent there is no struggle, and the widow's\r\nconduct is dictated either by her own convenience, or by the instinct\r\nwhich naturally leads a woman to yield to the amorous advances of a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nAt the critical age, that is the time when menstruation ceases,\r\nneither the sexual appetite nor voluptuous sensations disappear,\r\nalthough desire diminishes normally as age advances. In this respect\r\nit is curious to note that old women possess no sexual attraction for\r\nmen, while they often feel libidinous desires almost as strongly as\r\nyoung women. This is a kind of natural anomaly.\r\n\r\nAs we have already stated, individual differences in the sexual\r\nappetite are much greater in woman than in man. Some women are\r\nextremely excitable, and from their first youth experience violent\r\nsexual desire, causing them to masturbate or to throw themselves onto\r\nmen. Such women are usually polyandrous by nature, although the sexual\r\nappetite in woman is normally much more monogamous than that of man.\r\nSuch excesses in woman take on a more pathological character than in\r\nman, and go under the name of _nymphomania_. The insatiability of\r\nthese females, who may be met with in all classes of society, may\r\nbecome fabulous. Night and day, with short interruptions for sleeping\r\nand eating, they are, in extreme cases, anxious for coitus. They\r\nbecome less exhausted than men, because their orgasm is not\r\naccompanied by loss of semen.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the normal state woman is naturally full of delicacy and\r\nsentiments of modesty, nothing is easier than to make these disappear\r\ncompletely by training her systematically to sexual immodesty or to\r\nprostitution. Here we observe the effects of the routine and\r\nsuggestible character of feminine psychology, of the tendency of woman\r\nto become the slave of habit and custom, as well as of her\r\nperseverance when her determined will pursues a definite end.\r\nProstitution gives us sad proofs of this fact.\r\n\r\nThe psychology of prostitutes is very peculiar. Attempts to restore\r\nthem to a moral life nearly always fail hopelessly; it is rare to see\r\nthem permanently successful. Most of these women have a heredity of\r\nbad quality and are of weak character, idle and libidinous. They find\r\nit much easier to gain their living by prostitution, and forget their\r\nwork, if they have ever learned any. The poverty, drunkenness and\r\nshame which follow seduction and illegitimate birth have no doubt\r\ndriven more than one prostitute to her sad trade, but the naturally\r\nevil dispositions of these women constitute without any doubt the\r\nprincipal cause. Alcohol, venereal diseases and bad habits, combined\r\nwith continually repeated sexual degradation, afterwards determine\r\nprogressive decadence.\r\n\r\nSome of these women, however, of better quality, only surrender\r\nthemselves to prostitution by compulsion; they suffer from this\r\nexistence and strive to escape from it. The grisettes and lorettes[2]\r\nform a group intermediate between prostitution and natural love; they\r\nare women who hire themselves for a time to one man in particular, and\r\nare maintained and paid by him in return for satisfying his sexual\r\nappetites. Here again, sexual desire only exceptionally plays the\r\nchief role. The conduct of these women results from their loose\r\ncharacter and pecuniary interest.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we admit on the one hand that the sexual excesses of\r\nthe female sex are especially grafted on hereditary disposition of\r\ncharacter, or are primarily due to strong appetites, we are obliged on\r\nthe other hand to recognize that the great role played by sexuality in\r\nthe brain of woman renders it more difficult for her than for man to\r\nreturn to better ways when she has once prostituted herself, or when\r\nshe has surrendered in any way to sexual licentiousness, even when her\r\noriginal quality was not bad.\r\n\r\nIn man the sexual appetite is much more easily separated than in woman\r\nfrom other instincts, sentiments and intellectual life in general, and\r\npossesses in him, however powerful it may be, a much more transient\r\ncharacter, which prevents it dominating the whole mental life.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt so much on this point because it is essential to know the\r\ndifferences which exist between man and woman in this respect, and to\r\ntake them into account if we wish to give a just and healthy judgment\r\non the sexual question from the social point of view. The more it is\r\nour duty to give the same rights to both sexes, the more absurd it is\r\nto disregard the profoundness of their differences and to imagine that\r\nthese can ever be effaced.\r\n\r\n=Flirtation.=--If we look in an English dictionary for the meaning of\r\nthe word _flirt_, we find it equivalent to coquetry. But this English\r\nterm has become fixed and modernized in another sense which has become\r\ninternational, to express the old idea of a series of well-known\r\nphenomena which must be clearly distinguished from coquetry.\r\n\r\nCoquetry, an especially feminine attribute, is not in itself dependent\r\non the sexual appetite; it is an indirect irradiation, purely\r\npsychical, and we shall speak of it later on. Flirtation, as we now\r\nunderstand the term, is directly connected with the sexual appetite,\r\nand constitutes its external impression in all the wealth of its\r\nforms, as much in man as in woman. In a word, flirtation is a\r\npolymorphous language which clearly expresses the sexual desires of an\r\nindividual to the one who awakens these desires, actual coitus alone\r\nexcepted.\r\n\r\nFlirtation may be practiced in a more or less unconscious manner. It\r\nis by itself neither a psychic attribute nor sexual appetite, for a\r\nhuman being may so hide and overcome his appetites that no one remarks\r\nthem; and on the contrary, he may simulate sexual appetite without\r\nfeeling it, or at any rate behave in such a way as to excite it in his\r\npartner. Flirtation thus consists in an activity calculated to\r\ndisclose the eroticism of the subject as well as to excite that of\r\nothers. It is needless to say that the nature of coquetry disposes to\r\nflirtation.\r\n\r\nFlirtation comprises all the sport of love, kisses, caresses and all\r\nkinds of sexual excitation even to orgasm, without reaching the\r\nconsummation of coitus. All degrees may be noted; and, according to\r\ntemperament, flirtation may be limited to slight excitation of the\r\nsexual appetite or may extend to violent and rapidly increasing\r\nemissions. The considerable individual differences which exist in\r\nsexual sensibility result in the same perception or the same act\r\nhaving little effect on one individual, while it excites another to a\r\nhigh degree. In the latter case, especially in man, flirtation may\r\neven lead to venereal orgasm without coitus, and even without any\r\nmanipulations which resemble it. A woman of exuberant form, assuming\r\nsensual and voluptuous attitudes, may thus provoke an ejaculation by\r\nthe slight and repeated friction of her dress against the penis of an\r\nexcitable dancer.\r\n\r\nThe same thing often occurs when a passionate couple caress and\r\nembrace each other without the genital organs being touched or even\r\nexposed. In this respect the woman is better protected than the man,\r\nbut when she is very excitable an orgasm may be produced in her during\r\nthe caresses of a passionate flirtation by the pressure or friction of\r\nher legs against each other (a variety of masturbation in woman).\r\n\r\nAs a rule, however, things do not go so far as this in flirtation. The\r\nsight and touch are used alternately. The eyes play an important part,\r\nfor they may express much and consequently act powerfully. A pressure\r\nof the hands, an apparently chance movement, touching the dress and\r\nthe skin, etc., are the usual means of flirtation. In situations where\r\npeople are close together or pressed against each other, as in railway\r\ncarriages, or at table, the legs play a well-known part, by pressure\r\nof the knees and feet.\r\n\r\nThis dumb conversation of the sexual appetite begins at first in a\r\nprudent and apparently innocent manner, so that the acting party does\r\nnot risk being taxed with impropriety; but as soon as he who began the\r\nflirtation perceives that his slight invitations are welcome he grows\r\nbolder, a tacit mutual agreement is established, and the game\r\ncontinues without a single word betraying the reciprocal sensations.\r\nMany who practice flirtation, both men and women, avoid betraying\r\nthemselves by words, and they take pleasure in this mutual excitation\r\nof their genital sensibility, however incomplete it may be.\r\n\r\nFlirtation may assume very different forms according to education and\r\ntemperament. The action of alcohol on the brain develops the coarsest\r\nforms of flirtation. Every one knows the clumsy embraces of\r\nsemi-intoxicated persons which can often be seen at night or on\r\nSundays and holidays, in the street or in railway carriages, etc. I\r\ndesignate these by the term \"alcoholic flirtation.\" Even in the best\r\nand most refined society flirtation loses its delicacy even under the\r\neffect of the slightest degree of alcoholic intoxication.\r\n\r\nFlirtation assumes a more delicate and more complicated character,\r\nrendering it gracious and full of charm, in persons of higher\r\neducation, especially when they are highly intellectual or artistic.\r\n\r\nWe must also mention the intellectual variety of flirtation which is\r\nnot expressed by sight or touch, but only by language. Delicate\r\nallusions to sexual matters and somewhat lascivious conversation\r\nexcite eroticism as much as looks and touch. According to the\r\neducation of the persons concerned, this talk may be coarse and\r\nvulgar, or on the contrary refined and full of wit, managed with more\r\nor less skill, or clumsily. Here the natural finesse of woman plays a\r\nconsiderable part. Men wanting in tact are clumsy and offensive in\r\ntheir attempts at flirtation, and thus extinguish instead of exciting\r\nthe woman's eroticism. The manner in which alcoholic flirtation\r\nmanifests itself in cynical, dull, obtrusive and stupid conversation,\r\ncorresponds to its other forms of expression. Woman desires\r\nflirtation; but does not wish it to assume an unbecoming form.\r\n\r\nOne can say anything to a woman; all depends on the way in which it is\r\nsaid. I have seen lady doctors with whom one could discuss the most\r\nticklish subjects, profoundly shocked by the misplaced pleasantries of\r\na tactless professor. In themselves these pleasantries were quite\r\ninnocent for medical ears, as my lady colleagues were finally obliged\r\nto admit, when I pointed out to them the specially feminine character\r\nof their psychic reaction, proving to them that they listened without\r\na frown to things ten times worse, when the lecturer gave them a moral\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nMen also generally feel disgusted with the dull, cynical or clumsy\r\nform of female eroticism, although they are not usually over-refined\r\nthemselves in this respect.\r\n\r\nThis last phenomenon leads us to distinguish between flirtation in man\r\nand in woman. For woman it constitutes the only permissible way of\r\nexpressing erotic sentiments, and even then much restraint is imposed\r\non her. Circumstances develop in her the art of flirtation and give\r\nit remarkable finesse. Unless she exposes herself to great danger,\r\nwoman can only leave her sensuality to be guessed. Every audacious and\r\ntactless provocation fails in its object; it drives away the men and\r\ndestroys a young girl's reputation. Even when possessed by the most\r\nviolent erotic desire woman cannot ostensibly depart from her passive\r\nrole without compromising herself. Nevertheless, she succeeds on the\r\nwhole very easily in exciting the passions of man, by the aid of a few\r\nartifices. No doubt she does not entirely dominate him by this means.\r\nShe must be very delicate and adroit, at any rate at first, in the\r\nprovocative art of flirtation. These frivolities are greatly\r\nfacilitated by her whole nature and by the character of her habitual\r\neroticism. Man, on the other hand, may be more audacious in the\r\nexpression of his passion. This brings us back to what has been said\r\nconcerning the sexual differences.\r\n\r\nA whole volume could be written on the forms of flirtation, which is\r\nthe indispensable expression of all sexual desire. Among engaged\r\ncouples it assumes a legal character and even a conventional form. The\r\nway in which barmaids flirt with their customers is also somewhat\r\nconventional, although in quite a different way. In society,\r\nflirtation is generally seasoned with more Attic salt, whether it is\r\nnot allowed to exceed certain limits, or whether it leads to free\r\nliaisons after the manner of the Greek hetaira. In the country, among\r\npeasant girls and boys it takes a grosser form, if not more sensual,\r\nthan among the cultivated classes; in the latter, language takes the\r\nprincipal part. Among rich idlers in watering places, large hotels,\r\nand even in some sanatoriums, flirtation takes a dominant place and\r\nconstitutes, in all its degrees, the chief occupation of a great\r\nnumber of the visitors. It grows like a weed wherever man has a\r\nmonotonous occupation or suffers from the ennui of idleness.\r\n\r\nIn certain individuals, flirtation takes the place of coitus from the\r\nsensual, and love from the sentimental point of view. There are modern\r\ncrazy natures who spend their existence in all kinds of artificial\r\nexcitation of the senses, creatures of both sexes incapable of a\r\nuseful action.\r\n\r\nAs a momentary and transient expression of all the necessities of\r\nlove, flirtation has a right to existence; but, when cultivated on its\r\nown account and always remaining as flirtation, it becomes a symptom\r\nof degeneration or sexual depravity, among idle, crazy and vicious\r\npersons of all kinds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] The terms _grisette_ and _lorette_ are now obsolete, and the names\r\ngiven to this class of women constantly varies. I shall, nevertheless,\r\nemploy them in the course of this work because they clearly define\r\ncertain special varieties of remunerated concubinage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLOVE AND OTHER IRRADIATIONS OF THE SEXUAL APPETITE IN THE HUMAN MIND\r\n\r\n\r\n=Generalities. Jealousy.=--We have seen that the mechanism of the\r\nappetites consists in instincts inherited from our animal ancestors by\r\nmnemic engraphia and selection, and that it is situated in the\r\nprimordial or lower cerebral centers (basal ganglia, spinal cord,\r\netc.). In some of the lower animals we already find other instinctive\r\nnervous reactions which constitute the indirect effects or derivatives\r\nof the sexual appetite. The most evident of these is _jealousy_, or\r\nthe feeling of grief and anger produced in an individual when the\r\nobject of his sexual appetite is disputed by another individual of the\r\nsame sex. Jealousy may also arise from other instincts, such as those\r\nof nutrition, ambition, etc.; but it forms one of the most typical\r\ncomplements of the sexual appetite, and leads, as we know, to furious\r\ncombats, especially between males, sometimes also between females.\r\n\r\nOwing to its profoundly hereditary origin, this passion has a very\r\ninstinctive character, and might quite as well have been mentioned in\r\nthe preceding chapter. I deal with it here because it is naturally\r\nassociated with other irradiations of the sexual appetite, and because\r\nit has a peculiarly mental character.\r\n\r\n=Relation Between Love and Sexual Appetite. Sympathy.=--Having entered\r\nthe higher brain, or organ of mind, and become modified, complicated,\r\nand combined with the different branches of psychic activity, the\r\nsexual appetite takes the name of _love_, properly so-called. In order\r\nto better understand the relations of love to the sexual appetite we\r\nmust refer to Chapter II. Let us begin with a short exposition of the\r\nphylogeny of the sentiments of sympathy, or the altruistic and social\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\nIn the lower animals with no separate sexes egoism reigns absolutely.\r\nEach individual eats as much as it wants, then divides, buds or\r\nconjugates, thus fulfilling the sole object of its existence. The same\r\nprinciple holds in the lower stages of reproduction by separate sexes.\r\nSpiders give us a good example. In these, copulation is a dangerous\r\nact for the male, for if he is not extremely careful he is devoured by\r\nthe female, sometimes even before having attained his object, often\r\nsoon afterward, in order that nothing may be lost. However, the female\r\nshows a certain consideration for her eggs, and sometimes even for the\r\nyoung after they are hatched.\r\n\r\nIn higher stages of the animal kingdom sentiments of sympathy may be\r\nobserved, derived from the sexual union of individuals. These are\r\nsentiments of attachment of the male for the female, and especially of\r\nthe female (sometimes the male also) for their progeny.\r\n\r\nSuch sentiments become developed and may be transformed into intense\r\nlove between the sexes, of long duration. Birds, for instance, often\r\nremain faithful for many years, and even for life. From these simple\r\nfacts is evolved the intimate relationship which exists between sexual\r\nlove and other sentiments of sympathy, that is to say affection, or\r\nlove in the more vague and more extended sense of the term.\r\n\r\nTo every sentiment of sympathy between two individuals (sympathy forms\r\npart of the sentiments of pleasure) there is a corresponding contrary\r\ncorrelative sentiment of grief, when the object of sympathy dies,\r\nbecomes sick, takes flight or is carried off. This sentiment often\r\ntakes the form of simple sadness, but it may attain a degree of\r\nincurable melancholy. Among certain monkeys and parrots, we often see\r\nthe death of one of the conjoints lead to the refusal of all food and\r\nfinally to death of the survivor, after increasing sadness and\r\ndepression. Removal of the young produces a profound sadness in the\r\nfemale ape. But when an animal discovers the cause of the grief, when,\r\nfor instance, a stranger attempts to take away his mate or his young,\r\na mixed reaction of sentiment is produced, that is to say anger or\r\neven fury against the perpetrator of the deed.\r\n\r\nJealousy is only a special form of this anger. The sentiment of anger\r\nand its violent and hostile expression constitute the natural reaction\r\nagainst one who disturbs a sentiment of pleasure, a reaction which\r\ntends to reëstablish the latter. The power of the sentiment of anger\r\nincreases with the offensive and defensive faculties, while, in weak\r\nand peaceful beings, terror and sadness to a great extent take their\r\nplace. On the other hand, the sight of defenseless prey suffices to\r\nprovoke, in the rapacious who are strong and well armed, by simple\r\nreflex association, a cruel sentiment of voluptuous anger, which is\r\nalso observed in man.\r\n\r\n=Sentiment of Duty.=--Another derivative of the sentiment of sympathy\r\nis that of _duty_, that is the moral sense. All sentiment of love or\r\nsympathy urges the one who loves to certain acts destined to increase\r\nthe welfare of the object loved. This is why the mother nourishes her\r\nyoung and plucks feathers and hairs to make them a soft bed; and why\r\nthe father brings food to his wife and young, and defends them against\r\ntheir enemies. All these acts, which are not to the advantage of the\r\nindividual but to the object or objects of his sympathy, exact more or\r\nless laborious efforts, courage in the face of danger, etc. They thus\r\nprovoke an internal struggle between the sentiment of sympathy and\r\negoism, or the unpleasantness of undertaking things which are\r\ntroublesome and disagreeable for the individual himself. From this\r\nstruggle between two opposed series of sentiments is derived a third\r\ngroup of complex or mixed sentiments, that of duty, or _moral\r\nconscience_. When the sentiment of sympathy prevails, when the animal\r\ndoes his duty toward his young and his conjoint, he feels a sentiment\r\nof pleasure, of duty accomplished. If, on the contrary, he has been\r\nnegligent, the egoistic instincts having for the moment prevailed, the\r\nremorse of conscience results, that is the painful uneasiness which\r\nfollows all disobedience to the instinctive sentiments of sympathy.\r\nThis uneasiness accumulates in the brain in the form of\r\nself-discontent, and may lead to an accentuated sentiment of\r\n_repentance_.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena exist both in the male and in the female, and if it\r\nwas not so, the accomplishment of duty would be impossible; the cat\r\nwould run away instead of defending her young; would eat her prey\r\ninstead of giving it to them, etc. We thus see the elements of human\r\nsocial sentiment already very marked in many animals. Remorse and\r\nrepentance can only be formed on the basis of preëxisting sentiments\r\nof sympathy.\r\n\r\n=Sentiment of Kinship.=--A higher degree of the sentiments of sympathy\r\nis developed when these do not remain limited to a temporary union,\r\nbut when the union of the sexes is transformed into durable or even\r\nlife-long marriage, as we see in monkeys and in most birds. In another\r\nmanner the sentiments of sympathy are developed by extension of the\r\nfamily community to a greater number of individuals, who are grouped\r\ntogether for the common defense, as we see in swallows, crows, and to\r\na higher degree, in the large organized communities of social animals,\r\nas the beavers, bees, ants, etc. In the latter, the sentiment of\r\nsympathy and duty nearly always affects all the individuals of the\r\ncommunity, while anger and jealousy are extended toward every being\r\nwhich does not form part of it.\r\n\r\nWe must be blinded by prejudice not to comprehend that these same\r\ngeneral facts, revealed by the study of biology and animal psychology,\r\nare repeated in the human mind. Some animals are even superior to the\r\nmajority of men in the intensity of their sentiments of sympathy and\r\nduty, as well as in love and conjugal fidelity--monkeys and parrots,\r\nfor example. In the social insects, such as the ants and bees, with\r\ntheir communities so solidly organized and so finely coördinated on\r\nthe basis of instinct, the sentiment of social duty has almost\r\nentirely replaced the individual sentiments of sympathy. An ant or a\r\nbee only loves, so to speak, the whole assemblage of his companions.\r\nIt does not sacrifice itself for any one of them in particular, but\r\nonly for the community. In these animals the individual is only\r\nregarded as a number in the community whose motto is--one for all, but\r\nnever all for one.\r\n\r\nIn bees especially, the degree of sympathy extended to a member or a\r\nclass of the hive is exactly proportional to the utility of this\r\nmember to the community. The working bees will kill themselves or die\r\nof hunger in order to nourish their queen, while in the autumn they\r\nruthlessly massacre all the males or drones which have become\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\n=Sentiments of Patriotism and Humanity.=--The human brain, so powerful\r\nand so complicated, contains a little of all these things, with\r\nenormous individual variations. In man, the sentiments of sympathy and\r\nduty relate especially to the family, that is to say, they are to a\r\ngreat extent limited to individuals interested in a sexual community,\r\nviz., the conjoints and children, as occurs generally in mammals. It\r\nfollows that sentiments of sympathy connected with larger communities\r\nsuch as remote relatives, the clan, the community, the country, those\r\nwho speak the same language, etc., are relatively much weaker, and\r\nresult from education and custom rather than from instinct. The\r\nweakest sentiment is certainly that of _humanity_, which regards each\r\nman as a brother and companion, and from which is evolved the general\r\nsentiment of solidarity or social duty. How can it be otherwise in a\r\nspecies which has lived for thousands or perhaps millions of years as\r\nsmall hostile tribes, separated from each other? Primitive men were so\r\ndestitute of all humanitarian sentiment that they not only killed one\r\nanother and practiced mutual slavery, but also martyred, tortured and\r\neven devoured one another.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, and as the result of custom and life in common,\r\nthe individual sentiments of sympathy in man are easily extended to\r\nmembers of other races, especially as regards different sexes, so much\r\nso that enemies conquered and taken prisoners often became later on,\r\nowing to life in common, the friends or mates of their conquerors.\r\n\r\n=Antipathy.=--Inversely, individual antipathies and enmity often occur\r\nnot only between members of the same tribe but even between those of\r\nthe same family. The latter may lead to parricide, fratricide,\r\ninfanticide, or assassination of a conjoint.\r\n\r\n=Phylogeny of Love.=--The social life of ants offers us some\r\ninstructive analogies. In spite of the intense hostility of different\r\ncolonies of ants among themselves, there may be obtained by habitude,\r\noften after many desperate combats, alliances between colonies which\r\nwere hitherto enemies, even between colonies of different species.\r\nThese alliances henceforth become permanent. This is very curious to\r\nobserve at the time when the alliance begins to be formed. We then see\r\ncertain individual hatreds persist, to a varying extent, for several\r\ndays. Certain individuals of the weaker party are maltreated by other\r\nindividuals of the conquering party. They cut off their limbs and\r\nantennæ and often martyrize them to death with a rabidness that sadly\r\nresembles human sentiments! Hatred and dispute between individuals of\r\nthe same colony of ants are, on the other hand, extremely rare. I can\r\nguarantee the correctness of all these observations, having often\r\nrepeated them myself and having recorded them in my works on the\r\nhabits of ants. Moreover, they have since been confirmed by other\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\nAfter what we have just said, and especially if we take into\r\nconsideration the numerous observations which have been made in\r\nbiology, we can hardly doubt that the sentiment of sexual attraction,\r\nor the sexual appetite, has been the primary source of nearly all, if\r\nnot all, the sentiments of sympathy and duty which have been developed\r\nin animals and especially in man. Many of these sentiments are no\r\ndoubt little by little completely differentiated and rendered entirely\r\nindependent of sexual sentiment, forming a series of corresponding\r\nconceptions adapted to divers social objects in the form of sentiments\r\nof amity. The latter in their turn have often become the generators of\r\nsocial formations and of a more generalized altruism. Many others,\r\nhowever, have remained more or less consciously associated with the\r\nsexual appetite, as is certainly the case in man.\r\n\r\nThis short sketch which we have given of the phylogenetic history of\r\nlove and its derivatives is sufficient to show the immense influence\r\nwhich sexual life has exercised on the whole development of the human\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we must avoid exaggerating the actual importance of\r\nthis influence. Young children, who possess neither sexual appetite\r\nnor corresponding sensations, already give evidence not only of\r\nintense sentiments of sympathy and antipathy, anger and jealousy, but\r\nalso of commiseration, when they see those whom they love suffer; they\r\nmay even show that they already possess the sentiment of duty or\r\ndisinterested devotion. All these phylogenetic derivatives of the\r\nsentiments of sexual attraction are thus developed in the individual\r\nlong before the sexual instinct itself, from which they have become\r\nabsolutely independent. This does not prevent them being powerfully\r\ninfluenced by the sexual instinct when this awakes, or from being\r\nassociated with its direct derivatives when the sexual appetite,\r\nproperly so-called, is absent. Thus we see absolutely cold women\r\nbecome loving and devoted wives and mothers, and possessing a highly\r\ndeveloped sense of kinship. Maternal love is a sentiment of sympathy\r\nderived from the sexual sentiment, adapted directly to children, who\r\nare the products of sexual life.\r\n\r\n=Constellations.=--From all this results the immense complication of\r\nthe peculiarities of the human mind which are connected with love.\r\nIndividual variations of the disposition to sexual appetite are\r\ncombined with individual dispositions to the higher qualities of\r\nmind--general sentiments, intelligence and will--to form the most\r\ndiverse individual combinations, which we may call _constellations_.\r\nMoreover, inherited individual dispositions are combined in man with a\r\ngreat number of experiences and remembrances, acquired in all domains\r\nin the course of his life, accumulating them in his brain by what is\r\ncalled education or adaptation to environment. From the immense\r\ncomplexity of energies resulting from hereditary dispositions combined\r\nwith acquired factors, the resolutions and acts of man are derived,\r\nwithout his being able to account for the infinite multiplicity of\r\ncauses which determine them.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that a man may be a model of conduct or morality, simply\r\nfrom the fact that his sexual appetite is almost nil. Another, on the\r\ncontrary, suffers from an exaggerated sexual appetite, but is devoted,\r\nconscientious, and even scrupulous; this results in violent internal\r\nstruggles, from which he does not always emerge victorious. A third is\r\nmoderate in his appetites; if his sentiment of duty is strong and he\r\npossesses a strong will, he will resist his desires, while if his will\r\nis weak or his moral sense defective, he will succumb to the first\r\ntemptation.\r\n\r\nLove and sexual appetite may be intimately connected or completely\r\nseparated in the same individual. In the same way that a cold woman\r\nmay be a good mother, a very sensual woman may be a bad one, but the\r\ninverse may also be met with.\r\n\r\n=Love.=--I speak here of the true love of a higher nature of one sex\r\nfor the other, or _sexual love_, which is not simple friendship, but\r\nis combined with sexual appetite. To write on love is almost to pour\r\nwater into the ocean, for literature is three parts composed of\r\ndissertations on love. There can be no doubt that the normal man feels\r\na great desire for love. The irradiations of love in the mind\r\nconstitute one of the fundamental conditions of human happiness and\r\none of the principal objects of life. Unfortunately, the question is\r\ntoo often treated with exaggerated sentiment, or on the other hand,\r\nwith sensual cynicism; it is examined from one side only, or else it\r\nis misunderstood.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, love appears to be usually kindled by the sexual\r\nappetite. This is the celebrated story of Cupid's arrow. One falls in\r\nlove with a face, a look, a smile, a white breast, a sweet and\r\nmelodious voice, etc. However, the relations between love and sexual\r\nappetite are extremely delicate and complex. In man, the second may\r\nexist without the first and love may often persist without appetite,\r\nwhile in woman the two things are difficult to separate, and in any\r\ncase, in her, the original appetite without love is much more rare.\r\nThe two things are thus not identical; even the most materialistic and\r\nlibidinous egoist will agree to this, if he is not too narrow-minded.\r\n\r\nIt may also happen that love precedes appetite, and this often leads\r\nto the most happy unions. Two characters may have extreme mutual\r\nsympathy, and this purely intellectual and sentimental sympathy may at\r\nfirst develop without a shadow of sensuality. This is nearly always\r\nthe case when it exists from infancy. In modern society an enormous\r\nnumber of sexual unions, or marriages, are consummated without a trace\r\nof love, and are based on pure speculation, conventionality or\r\nfortune. Here it is tacitly assumed that the normal sexual appetite\r\ncombined with custom will cement the marriage and render it durable.\r\nAs the normal man has not, as a rule, extreme sentiments, such\r\nprevision is usually realized on the whole, the conjoints becoming\r\ngradually adapted to one another, more or less successfully according\r\nto the discoveries which are made after marriage.\r\n\r\nEven when they are relatively true, love stories generally deal with\r\nexceptional cases, often even pathological; for the average marriage\r\ndoes not appear to the novelist sufficiently piquant or interesting to\r\ncaptivate his readers. We are not concerned here with extremes, or\r\nwith the tragic situations met with in novels, but with normal and\r\nordinary love, as it most often occurs in reality.\r\n\r\nAfter what we have just said, it is clear that love is derived from\r\ntwo factors: (1) _momentary sexual passion_; (2) _the hereditary and\r\ninstinctive sentiments of sympathy which are derived from the\r\nprimordial sexual appetite of our animal ancestors, but which have\r\nbecome completely independent of this appetite_. Between these two\r\nterms are placed the sentiments of sympathy experienced by the\r\nindividual in his former life, which have most often been provoked by\r\nsexual desire for an individual of the opposite sex, and which may be\r\nevoked by the aid of remembrance, kindled afresh, and contribute\r\nstrongly to maintain constancy of love. These different sentiments\r\npass into each other in all possible shades, and continually react on\r\neach other. Sexual appetite, for example, awakens sympathy, and is\r\nawakened by the latter in its turn; on the contrary, it is cooled or\r\nextinguished under the influence of bad conduct on the part of the\r\nperson loved.\r\n\r\nLet us here recall a law of the sentiments of sympathy, a law which is\r\nwell known, but generally forgotten in human calculations. Man loves\r\nbest those to whom he devotes himself, and not those from whom he\r\nreceives benefits.[3] It is easy to be convinced of the reality of\r\nthis fact in the relations of parents to their children, as well as in\r\nmarriage. When one of the conjoints in marriage adulates the other,\r\nthe latter may easily find this adulation quite natural, and may love\r\nthe other conjoint much less than a spoilt child, to which is devoted\r\nall the transports of an unreasonable affection. The spoilt child, the\r\nobject of such blind affection, more often responds to it by\r\nindifference, or even by ingratitude, disdain and impertinence. We\r\nfind everywhere this play of sentiments, which considerably impedes\r\nmutuality in love. It may even concern inanimate objects. We like a\r\ngarden, a house or a book over which we have taken much pains, and we\r\nremain indifferent to the most beautiful and precious gifts which come\r\nby themselves without our making any effort to obtain them. In the\r\nsame way, the child becomes attached to some toy which he has made\r\nhimself, and disdains the costly presents given by his parents. As a\r\npoet has said: \"Man only enjoys for long and without remorse the goods\r\ndearly paid for by his efforts.\" (Sully-Prudhomme: \"_Le Bonheur_.\")\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, a profound psychology in the old and wise saying\r\nthat true love expresses itself as often by refusal as by compliance,\r\nand should always associate itself with reason. No doubt this is not\r\nprimitive love; it is a love elevated and purified by its combination\r\nwith the elements of intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn marriage, more than one husband thinks he ought to be separated\r\nfrom his wife and children so as not to spoil them. There is no need\r\nof a long explanation to show the fallacy of this idea. To be\r\ncomplete, love should be reciprocal, and to remain mutual it requires\r\nmutual education in marriage. Every husband should above all be\r\nseparated from himself, and not from his wife. If each one did all in\r\nhis power to promote the happiness of the other, this altruistic\r\neffort would strengthen his own sentiments of sympathy. This requires\r\na constant and loyal effort on each side, but it avoids the illusion\r\nof a false love, provoked by the senses, vanishing like smoke or\r\nbecoming changed to hatred. Without being blind to the weaknesses of\r\nhis partner he must learn to like them as forming part of the person\r\nto whom he has devoted his heart, and employ all his skill in\r\ncorrecting them by affection, instead of increasing his own weakness\r\nby leaning on them. It is necessary, therefore, neither to admire nor\r\nto dislike the defects of the loved one, but to try and attenuate them\r\nby aid of integral love.\r\n\r\nLove has been defined as \"dual egoism.\" The reciprocal adulation of\r\ntwo human beings easily degenerates into egoistic enmity toward the\r\nrest of the human race, and this often reacts harmfully on the quality\r\nof love. Human solidarity is too great, especially at the present day,\r\nfor such exclusivism in love not to suffer.\r\n\r\nI would define ideal love as follows: _After mature consideration, a\r\nman and a woman are led by sexual attraction, combined with harmony of\r\ncharacter, to form a union in which they stimulate each other to\r\nsocial work, commencing this work with their mutual education and that\r\nof their children._\r\n\r\nSuch a conception of love refines this sentiment and purifies it to\r\nsuch an extent that it loses all its pettiness, and it is pettiness\r\nwhich so often causes it to degenerate, even in its most loyal forms.\r\nThe social work in common of a man and woman united by true affection,\r\nfull of tenderness and devotion for one another, mutually encouraging\r\neach other to perseverance and to action, will easily triumph over\r\npetty jealousies and all other instinctive reactions of the\r\nphylogenetic exclusiveness of natural love. The sentiments of love\r\nwill thus become ever more ideal, and will no longer provide egoism\r\nwith the soil of idleness and comfort on which it grows like a weed.\r\n\r\n=Inconvenience of Abstinence from Sexual Connection Between Married\r\nCouples by Medical Orders.=--It is a matter of common observation that\r\nin marriage, at least during mature life, sexual connection\r\nstrengthens and maintains love, even when it only constitutes part of\r\nthat which cements tenderness and affection. In many cases I have\r\nobserved that medical orders, given no doubt with good intentions, and\r\nforbidding sexual connection, on account of certain morbid conditions,\r\nhave had the effect of cooling the sentiments of love and sympathy and\r\nproducing indifference which soon becomes incurable. Physicians should\r\nalways bear this in mind in their prescriptions, of which they too\r\noften see the immediate object only. The medical prohibition of sexual\r\nconnection in marriage should be reserved for cases of absolute\r\nnecessity. For example: A virtuous and capable man marries for love an\r\nintelligent but somewhat ill-developed girl. The marriage is happy and\r\nthey have several children. But after a time certain local disorders\r\nin the woman induce the medical man to forbid sexual connection with\r\nher husband. They begin to sleep in separate rooms, and little by\r\nlittle intimate love becomes so far cooled that the renewal of sexual\r\nrelations later on becomes impossible. The husband's sentiments are so\r\nmuch affected as to render him unfaithful to his moral principles,\r\nand to lead him occasionally to visit prostitutes. Although they have\r\nbecome essentially strangers to each other, the husband and wife\r\ncontinue to live together an apparently happy life; but this is far\r\nfrom always the case.\r\n\r\n=Durable Love.=--It may be stated as a principle that true and\r\nelevated love is durable, and that the sudden passion which lets loose\r\nthe sexual appetite toward an individual of the opposite sex, hitherto\r\na stranger, in no way represents the measure of true love. Passion\r\nwarps the judgment, conceals the most evident faults, colors\r\neverything in celestial purple, renders the lovers blind, and veils\r\nthe true character of each from the other. We are only speaking here\r\nof cases where each is loyal and where the sexual appetite is not\r\nassociated with the cold calculations of egoism. Reason only returns\r\nwhen the first tempest of a passion which seemed insatiable has\r\nsubsided, when the honeymoon of marriage, or of a free union, has\r\npassed. Then only is it possible to see if what remains is true love,\r\nindifference, hatred or a mixture of these three sentiments, capable\r\nor not of becoming more or less adaptable and tolerable. This is why\r\nsudden amours are always dangerous, and why only long and profound\r\nmutual acquaintance before marriage can lead to a happy and lasting\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nEven in this case the unforseen is not absent, for it is very rarely\r\nthat one knows a man and his ancestry; moreover, acquired diseases or\r\nmental anomalies may cause his character to degenerate later on.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine some psychic phenomena more or less connected with\r\nlove. For reasons which we have mentioned the irradiations of sexual\r\nlove are on the whole less developed in man than in woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nPSYCHIC IRRADIATIONS OF LOVE IN MAN\r\n\r\n=Masculine Audacity.=--In the normal male the sentiment of sexual\r\npower favors self-exaltation, while the contrary sentiment of\r\nimpotence, or even that of mediocre sexual power, depresses this\r\nsentiment of exaltation. Yet, in reality, the sexual power of man has\r\nnot the capital importance for a normal and virgin woman that men\r\nimagine, influenced as they are by self-exaltation; what imposes on\r\nwomen is especially masculine audacity, and in sexual matters this\r\nincreases with experience and practice. The company of prostitutes\r\noften renders men incapable of understanding feminine psychology, for\r\nprostitutes are hardly more than automata trained for the use of male\r\nsensuality. When men look among these for the sexual psychology of\r\nwoman they only find their own mirror.\r\n\r\nMan's flirtation, and his art of paying court to women are naturally\r\ncombined with his audacity, as we have already observed in birds and\r\nmammals, and some of the lower animals. The male seeks to please the\r\nfemale to gain her favors. The brilliant colors of butterflies and\r\nbirds, song, skill and proof of strength, often come to the aid of the\r\nmale sexual instinct. Even in certain animals supplicant and plaintive\r\nsounds assist the male after his repeated refusal, apparently or in\r\nreality, by the female. We shall see in Chapter VI that savage men\r\nhave a much greater tendency to tattoo and adorn themselves than have\r\nthe women.\r\n\r\nThe art which man employs to seduce and conquer woman has been\r\ndescribed to satiety in romances and novels, as well as in\r\nethnographic works; so that we shall not dwell on it here. On the\r\ncontrary, we shall show that in higher civilizations man is in general\r\nmore sought after than woman, so that the latter has surpassed him in\r\nthe art of flirtation or sexual conquest.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to remark to what extent the increase of man's\r\nmental complexity transforms his sexual tactics. The simple, natural,\r\nand at the same time bashful, modest manner, in which a naïve young\r\nman seeks to conquer a heart, usually produces no effect on the\r\nfashionable young lady, experienced in all refined pleasures and\r\nsaturated with unhealthy novels. These young women are much more\r\neasily seduced by the art of Don Juan and the old _roués_, who are\r\nmore adequate to deal with them because they have studied practically\r\nthe psychology of the modern woman.\r\n\r\n=Instinct of Procreation.=--Another irradiation of the male sexual\r\ninstinct, connected with the preceding, is the instinct of\r\nprocreation. If there were no other difficulties or consequences, man\r\nwould without the least doubt be instinctively inclined to copulate\r\nwith as many women as he could, and procreate as many children as\r\npossible. The more he is capable of satisfying his procreative\r\ninstinct, the more he becomes self-exalted, as he thus sees himself\r\nmultiplied and feels his power extended by the possession of a great\r\nnumber of wives and children. This is one of the principal causes\r\nwhich urge rich men and polygamous peoples to possess many women.\r\n\r\nCoitus without object, like that of prostitution, can only assuage the\r\nsexual appetite and does not satisfy any of its higher irradiations.\r\nIt is well known that a happy betrothal, reposing on true love, and\r\nnot on pecuniary interests, often transforms a young man from\r\npessimism to optimism, from misogyny to philogyny. Skeptics smile at\r\nthis transformation and regard it as only the transient intoxication\r\nof love. This may be true in some cases, but, as we have seen above,\r\nwhen love is ennobled by deep understanding and mutual education, when\r\neach knows and respects the other, the transformation remains\r\ndefinite, and is strengthened so much that the honeymoon of the silver\r\nwedding is often happier and more exalted than that which followed\r\nmarriage. We can then say that the optimism created by sexual union\r\ncemented by true love rests on the normal accomplishment of the object\r\nof life. I cannot too often repeat that work in common, especially\r\nsocial work, on the part of the conjoints, is necessary for their\r\nhappiness to be complete, and to survive in the one who remains after\r\nthe decease of the other.\r\n\r\n=Jealousy.=--The worst irradiation, or rather the worst reaction of\r\ncontrast of love, which we have inherited from our animal ancestors,\r\nand that which is the most deeply rooted, is _jealousy_. Jealousy is a\r\nheritage of animals and barbarism; that is what I would say to all\r\nthose who, in the name of offended honor, would grant it rights and\r\neven place it on a pedestal. It is ten times better for a woman to\r\nmarry an unfaithful than a jealous husband. From the phylogenetic\r\npoint of view, jealousy originates in the struggle for the possession\r\nof woman, at a period when right depended only on brute force. Cunning\r\nand violence contended with each other, and when the conqueror was in\r\npossession of a female, he had to guard her jealously to prevent her\r\nbeing abducted. Furious combats ensued. As soon as an unaccustomed\r\napproach, a look or anything else awakened the least suspicion of the\r\npresence of a rival, the male was tormented with a continual and\r\ninstinctive feeling of defiance and distrust, often increased by the\r\nremembrance of the sadness of former defeats and the impotent rage\r\nwhich followed.\r\n\r\nThe results of male jealousy in the history of marriage are truly\r\nincredible. I may mention the iron girdles with locks--the so-called\r\ngirdles of chastity--which we still see in certain museums, which the\r\nknights of the Middle Ages put on their wives when they set off to the\r\nwars, in order to appease their jealousy. Many savage peoples do not\r\ncontent themselves with severely punishing adultery in woman, even by\r\ndeath, but even simple conversations with a strange man. Jealousy\r\ntransforms marriage into a hell. It is often exalted in man to the\r\npoint of a mania for persecution, to which it is analogous. It is also\r\na very common symptom of alcoholism. Then the life of the unfortunate\r\nwoman who is the object of it becomes a continual martyrdom. Perpetual\r\nsuspicion accompanied by insults, threats and violent words, and even\r\nhomicide may be the result of this atrocious passion.\r\n\r\nEven in its more moderate and normal form, jealousy is a torment, for\r\ndistrust and suspicion poison love. We often hear of justified\r\njealousy; I maintain, on the contrary, that jealousy is never\r\njustified, and that it is only the brutal stupidity of an atavistic\r\nheritage, or a pathological symptom. A reasonable man who has doubts\r\nas to the fidelity of his wife has certainly the right to assure\r\nhimself of their correctness. But of what use is it to be jealous? If\r\nhe finds his suspicions false he has, by his manner, made his wife\r\nunnecessarily unhappy and destroyed conjugal confidence and happiness.\r\nIf, on the contrary, his suspicions are well founded he has only to\r\nchoose between one of two ways. If it is a case of amorous\r\nintoxication suggested by another man to his wife, who is often very\r\nunhappy about it, she may then be restored to her husband and\r\npardoned, for in this case affection only can cure her, never\r\njealousy. If, however, love for her husband is entirely extinguished\r\nin her, or if she is only a false intriguer without character,\r\njealousy is even more absurd, for the game is not worth the candle,\r\nand immediate divorce is necessary.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, man only possesses very little control over his\r\nfeelings when these are violent. The jealous person by nature, that is\r\nby heredity, is generally incurable and poisons his own existence at\r\nthe same time as that of his wife. Such individuals should never\r\nmarry.\r\n\r\nIn lunatic asylums, in law, and in novels jealousy plays an important\r\npart, for it is one of the most fruitful sources of tragedies and\r\nhuman unhappiness. The combined and persevering efforts of education\r\nand selection are necessary to gradually eliminate it from the human\r\nbrain. We often hear it said of man and woman that they are not\r\njealous enough, because they are too indulgent toward the\r\nextra-nuptial inclinations of their conjoint. When such indulgence\r\nrests on cynical indifference or on pecuniary interests, it is not the\r\nwant of jealousy but the want of moral sense which is to blame. If it\r\narises from real and reasoned love, it should on the contrary be\r\nhighly respected and praised. I would wish all heroes of offended\r\nhonor and all defenders of jealousy to reflect on the following case:\r\n\r\nA man of high position, and the father of five children, lived in the\r\nmost happy union. One day he made the acquaintance of a friend of his\r\nwife, a very intelligent and well-educated lady. Frequent visits and\r\nlong conversations led to intimacy which developed into violent\r\nreciprocal love. However, the lady refused to abandon herself\r\nentirely. The husband confessed everything to his wife, even to the\r\nsmallest details, and the lady did the same. Instead of becoming\r\njealous, the wife had the good sense and the courage to treat the two\r\nlovers not only with indulgence, but a true and profound affection.\r\nThe loyalty of each of the parties interested greatly facilitated the\r\ngradual _dénouement_ of a difficult situation, without the family\r\naffections suffering. But the _dénouement_ would have been quite as\r\npeaceful if the lady had yielded to sexual connection with the\r\nhusband. In fact, the wife herself considered this question very\r\nseriously and calmly, in case the fire could not be otherwise\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nI ask in all sincerity, if such mild and humane treatment of an\r\nunfortunate love affair, in which the three interested parties each\r\nstrove to avoid all scandal and everything which could damage their\r\nmutual reputation, I ask if this good and loyal treatment is not, from\r\nthe moral standpoint, far superior to scenes of jealousy, duels,\r\ndivorces and all their consequences, things which are all sanctioned\r\nand even sanctified by custom?\r\n\r\nI also know many cases where the husbands of women who have fallen in\r\nlove with other men have conducted themselves in an equally noble and\r\nreasonable manner, even when their wives had been completely\r\nunfaithful, and the results have always been good. It is needless to\r\nsay that I do not wish to maintain that a husband should tolerate\r\nindefinitely the bad conduct of his wife, nor a woman that of her\r\nhusband; but this is another thing.\r\n\r\n=Sexual Braggardism.=--Let us pass on to another irradiation of the\r\nmale sexual appetite--sexual braggardism. This arises from\r\nself-exaltation evolved from the sexual power of man. Like jealousy,\r\nthis sentiment is no doubt inherited from our animal ancestors, and it\r\nfinds its analogy, or rather its caricature, in the cock, the peacock,\r\nthe turkey, and in general among the richly adorned males of\r\npolygamous species. Although on the whole more innocent, the results\r\nof this atavistic instinct are no more elevated than those of\r\njealousy. The sentiment of sexual power induces men, especially those\r\nof lower mental caliber, to boast of their sexual conquests and\r\nexaggerate them. It is needless to say that success does not go to the\r\nunskillful boaster, but to the one who relates his audacious exploits\r\nin a casual way. The Don Juan experienced in the art of seduction\r\napproaches women with audacity and _aplomb_, and usually imposes on\r\nthem considerably, whatever his ignorance of other things. He has\r\ninstinctively learnt one thing: viz., the weakness of woman in the\r\nface of the male form, theatrical effect, uniforms, an audacious act,\r\na fierce mustache, etc. He has learnt that these fireworks hypnotize\r\nher and silence her reason, and that she is then capable of enthusiasm\r\nfor the most doubtful cavalier and delivers herself to him bound hand\r\nand foot, provided his self-assurance does not desert him.\r\n\r\nI may say here that it is most often men of low intellect, weak in\r\njudgment and principles, who think themselves most superior to the\r\nfeminine sex, and who behave as tyrants to their wives.\r\n\r\nSexual braggardism has, moreover, grave consequences for the man\r\nhimself, for it urges him to excesses which far exceed his appetites\r\nand especially his natural wants. In spite of other advantages, he\r\nwishes to shine by these excesses among his fellows and even among the\r\ngrisettes whose minds are full of sexual matters.\r\n\r\nMale sexual braggardism contributes with sexual appetite to entice\r\nreserved and high-minded young men toward prostitutes, against their\r\nbetter instincts, their reason and their moral sense. Alcohol\r\nespecially facilitates the degeneration of sexual life.\r\n\r\n=The Pornographic Spirit.=--The term _eroticism_ is given to the state\r\nof excitation of the sexual appetite. When a person cultivates it\r\nartificially and abandons himself to purely animal sensuality, without\r\ncombining it with higher intellectual or moral aspirations, there\r\ndevelop in the mind irradiations which may be designated by the term\r\n_pornographic spirit_. The entire circle of ideas of such individuals\r\nis so impregnated with eroticism that all their thoughts and\r\nsentiments are colored by it. They see everywhere, even in the most\r\ninnocent objects, the most lewd allusions. Woman is only regarded by\r\nthem as an object of sexual enjoyment, and her mind only appears to\r\nsuch satyrs as an ignoble erotic caricature, which is disgusting to\r\nevery man capable of lofty sentiments.\r\n\r\nOwing to its usually sensual and gross nature, male eroticism has\r\nsucceeded in modeling a whole class of women in whom ideal character\r\nin their desires is wanting. Instead of recognizing his own work and\r\nthe vile image of his own person in these unnatural women, the\r\nlibertine, as we have already seen, imagines them as the normal type\r\nof woman. From the height of his presumption, he then despises woman\r\nand does not perceive that it is himself whom he despises; for on the\r\nwhole, from the sexual point of view, the dependent woman of to-day\r\nconforms herself to man and becomes what he makes her. The number of\r\ncoitus, their details, the size and form of the sexual organs, the\r\npleasure of having cut out other men, and especially the pathological\r\nperversions of the sexual appetite, form the chief object of the\r\nthoughts and conversations of pornographic minds. Each tries to outdo\r\nthe others in sexual enormities, and the virtuosity of these gentlemen\r\nin this domain is only surpassed by their ignorance and incapacity in\r\nall others.\r\n\r\nProstitution and all the modern sexual degeneration which marches\r\nunder the hypocritical flag of Christianity, civilization and\r\nmonogamy, have so far developed the pornographic spirit that men\r\nliving in centers of debauchery, centers which are unfortunately\r\nextending more and more from town to country, lose all conception of\r\nthe noble qualities natural to the feminine sentiment and to true\r\nlove, or only preserve a few shreds of it which they treat with\r\nridicule. Many men have admitted this to me, after being much\r\nastonished when I was obliged to give them quite another conception of\r\nlove and woman, without introducing the least trace of religion. No\r\ndoubt certain better individuals, fallen by chance into debauchery,\r\nspeak respectfully of a mother or a sister, for whom they profess an\r\nalmost religious worship. They regard these as beings apart, as\r\nspecies of a lost race of demigods, and they do not perceive that they\r\ndiscredit them and drag them in the mud by their contempt and\r\npornographic conception of woman in general, a conception which is\r\nmoreover often altered to profound pessimism.\r\n\r\nIn the relatively moral circles of society, our description would no\r\ndoubt be taxed with exaggeration, because natures a little more\r\nrefined have the habit of acting like the ostrich who hides his head\r\nin the sand, that is to say of turning their eyes away from the\r\npornographic swamp with disgust so as not to see it, and thus avoid it\r\ninstinctively. But this maneuver serves no purpose: the facts remain\r\nas they are.\r\n\r\nEroticism is no more a vice than sexual anæsthesia is a virtue. Even\r\nwhen they are chaste, men of libidinous nature require a strong will\r\nto resist all the artificial seductions which excite their sensuality.\r\nThis is why the bog of debauchery engulfs so many men of a naturally\r\ngood nature. In this sense, cold natures are better off; they can\r\ncover themselves with the glory of a \"virtue\" the resplendent rays of\r\nwhich become lost in a penumbra of defects and weaknesses from which\r\nthese natures suffer in other domains.\r\n\r\n=Sexual Hypocrisy.=--Hypocrisy is a peculiarity deeply rooted in the\r\nhuman mind. We can affirm that whoever pretends never to have been a\r\nhypocrite lies, quite as much as one who swears he has never lied. But\r\nnowhere, save perhaps in the domain of religion, does hypocrisy play a\r\ngreater part than in the sexual domain. Nowhere is there so much\r\nfalsehood, and men who are most honest on other points make no scruple\r\nof deceiving their wives in this respect. I do not speak here of the\r\nsimulation of sentiments of love, for it is too banal, and there is no\r\nneed to be too exacting over this point, for there are strong\r\nattenuating circumstances.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, erotic feelings are capable of blinding man for the\r\nmoment, as far as persuading him of the eternal duration of love and\r\nfidelity which he promises the object of his appetites, as well as of\r\nthe reality of the celestial qualities under which this object appears\r\nto him, or with which it pleases him to adorn it. Two persons mutually\r\nexcited by sexual passion are fascinated by the illusions of a mirage,\r\nwhich often vanishes soon afterward, so that it is not rare to see\r\nthem on the following day hurling the most violent abuse at each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThose who have not been witnesses of such events may hardly believe\r\nthem. It is sufficient, however, to be a magistrate or to read the\r\nreports of lawsuits between debased persons as the result of love\r\nquarrels, broken engagements or marriages, seductions, etc., to study\r\nthe letters that the two parties have written before and after their\r\nquarrel, in order to be convinced of the correctness of what we have\r\nsaid above. In the first letters the lovers adulate each other and\r\nadorn each other with the most hyperbolic epithets, swearing eternal\r\nlove and fidelity, and deluding each other in the most absurd manner.\r\nIn letters written sometimes only a few days later we are astonished\r\nto see the same individuals grossly insulting each other and mutually\r\ncovering themselves with ignoble calumnies. This is how passion\r\nwithout reason passes through the furnaces of love and hatred,\r\ndragging after it all the artificial scaffolding of what man imagines\r\nto be his right based on logic, but which is in reality only a tissue\r\nof ridiculous contradictions, the automatic and inept product of his\r\nemotional state. Such contrasts are so frequent that we can easily\r\nrecognize the expression of a psychological law, due to the mirages of\r\nthe amorous passions on the one hand and the inverse reaction on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nNevertheless hypocrisy has its good side. It has been said not without\r\nreason that \"hypocrisy is a concession which vice makes to virtue.\" In\r\ntheir nakedness human thoughts are often so sadly vulgar and so\r\noffensive that a little varnish improves them. In this sense, and when\r\nit comes from a feeling of shame or good-will, hypocrisy deserves a\r\ngood deal of the eulogy which Mark Twain has heaped on it in his\r\ncharming satire, \"The Decadence of the Art of Lying.\"\r\n\r\nIn the sexual question hypocrisy is directly provoked by the tyranny\r\nand barbarism of what are called good manners, often even by the law.\r\nIn this sense it constitutes a response of human nature to the forms\r\nand customs derived from the right of the stronger or from religious\r\nsuperstitions, as well as from the dogmas resulting from them.\r\n\r\nBy the term _sexual hypocrisy_ I do not mean the repugnant forms of\r\nhypocrisy pure and simple, in which man only exploits love indirectly\r\nfor an interested end, for instance when he simulates love to obtain a\r\nrich wife. I only speak of the forms of hypocrisy which are directly\r\nevolved from the sexual appetite or from love.\r\n\r\nIt is from this point of view that we must judge sexual hypocrisy, and\r\nif I have laid special stress on its good points, it is in view of\r\nmarriage, where it assists the education of noble and elevated\r\nsentiments even in the hypocrite. By praising the virtues of his\r\nhelpmate with a little exaggeration, these are made to appear more\r\nnoble. If the time is spent in saying disagreeable truths, love is\r\nsoon stifled and killed. On the contrary, if each conjoint attributes\r\nto the other as fine qualities as possible, each is finally persuaded\r\nthat the other really possesses them, and then realizes them himself,\r\nat any rate in part.\r\n\r\nThe worst of hypocrisies is that which is the product of base\r\npecuniary interests, or of a gross sexual appetite without love, or\r\nlastly by the pressure of conventional or religious customs. Good\r\nhypocrisy consists in the repression of all that is base in the\r\nsentiments, inclinations and passions; in the fact that one strives to\r\nhide it from others, even from one's self, and to suggest in its place\r\nas many amiable qualities as possible, so as to strengthen in a\r\ndisinterested manner the object of one's love in noble sentiments.\r\nThis kind of hypocrisy is in reality an indirect product of altruistic\r\nsentiments. One perceives with pain on reflecting, either the absence\r\nof spontaneous sentiments of sympathy, or the presence of disgust and\r\nbad temper, and one strives to hide the thing by sympathetic\r\nexpressions for which one seeks an object, and to which one would wish\r\nto give a durable character. Loyal efforts made in this direction\r\noften succeed in correcting the egoistic humor with which one is\r\naffected, and in giving rise to the sentiments one desires to\r\nexperience. One must not, however, by only looking at one side of the\r\nquestion, allow such efforts to degenerate into maladroit blindness,\r\nwhich will only have the effect of spoiling the person one loves.\r\n\r\n=Egoistic Love.=--It is obvious that the psychic irradiations of the\r\nsexual sense are strongly influenced by the individuality of the one\r\nwho loves. The egoist loves in a manner naively egoistic. He is not\r\nwanting in fine words, but in his opinion all sentiment and respect is\r\ndue to his person, while he reduces to a minimum his duties toward the\r\nobject of his love. He exacts much from the other and gives little.\r\nThe good man with altruistic sentiments feels things in an inverse\r\nway; he exacts little from others, and much from himself.\r\n\r\nLove differs in different natures, according as they are calm or\r\nlively, imbecile or intelligent, well educated or otherwise: the will\r\nplays a great part here. Weakness and impulsiveness are found in love,\r\nas well as energy and perseverance. In the last point woman is\r\nsuperior, owing to the greater constancy of her love. There is thus no\r\ndomain of the mind which is not influenced by love, and which does not\r\nreact on love in its turn.\r\n\r\nIntellectual occupations are facilitated by a happy love, while they\r\nare usually hindered by the sorrows of love. Even men of science, so\r\nproud of their calmness, are often more influenced than one would\r\nthink in their scientific opinions by their emotional sentiments.\r\nWithout a man being aware of it, his sentiments insinuate themselves\r\ninto the opinions which he believes to be of a purely intellectual\r\nnature, and direct them unconsciously with much more power than he\r\ngenerally imagines. Such influences act chiefly on individuals\r\ndisposed to sentimentality. In love, these individuals resemble\r\ntwo-edged swords; the intensity of their emotional reactions and\r\nsentiments drives them from one extreme to another, from foolish\r\nhappiness to despair or fury. The situation becomes still more grave\r\nwhen such storms burst among impulsive persons of weak will and\r\nlimited intelligence. Under such circumstances ill-assorted alliances\r\nare formed which lead to violent quarrels, and sometimes even to\r\ncrime. When jealousy comes on the scene the man often kills the woman\r\nand commits suicide.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that such crime can only arise from egoism; this is\r\noften the case, but not always. Despair may often lead to such acts,\r\nwithout any motive of vengeance, or even of jealousy. The storm of\r\npassion drives weak-minded persons to impulsive actions, the motives\r\nof which are very difficult to analyze. After these tragedies of\r\nmurder preceding suicide, when the murderer survives, he often\r\nexpresses himself as follows: \"I was in such a state of despair and\r\nexcitement that I saw no other issue than death for both of us.\"\r\n\r\n=Prudery. Modesty.=--The sentiment of modesty originates in the fear\r\nof everything which is novel and unusual, and is complicated by\r\nnatural timidity. This sentiment is especially strong in children. The\r\nsentiment of sexual modesty in man thus rests on timidity and on the\r\nfear of not doing as others do. It betrays itself toward women by\r\nawkwardness and bashfulness behind which eroticism is often ill\r\nconcealed. The timid and bashful man carefully endeavors to hide his\r\nsexual feelings from others. The object of modesty is in itself\r\nimmaterial to the psychology of this sentiment, and shame is sometimes\r\ninspired not only by very different things but even by opposite\r\nthings. One youth is ashamed of appearing erotic, another of appearing\r\ntoo little erotic, according to the opinion of his neighbors.\r\n\r\nModesty depends on the custom of covering or exposing certain parts of\r\nthe body, and people who live in a state of nature are as much ashamed\r\nof clothes as we are ashamed of nudity. Moreover, man soon becomes\r\naccustomed to fashion, and the same English girl who blushes at the\r\nsight of a few inches of bare skin in her own country, finds it quite\r\nnatural to see naked negroes in the tropics.\r\n\r\nThe artificial and systematic cultivation of an exaggerated sentiment\r\nof modesty produces _prudery_, the bad results of which are, however,\r\nless than those of pornography. There are young people so modest that\r\nthe simple thought of sexual matters overexcites them terribly. By\r\nassociating their own erotic feelings, of which they feel ashamed,\r\nwith sexual ideas, they invest these with terrifying attributes, and\r\nbecome quite unhappy; in this way they are often led to masturbation.\r\nThey are, however, excessively frightened at this also and imagine its\r\neffects so terrible that they think themselves lost. Their exaggerated\r\nfeelings of modesty often prevent them confiding in some charitable\r\nperson. However, they rarely find reasonable consolers; some ridicule\r\nthem, while others regard them as iniquitous, which only increases\r\ntheir terror and drives them to extremes.\r\n\r\nThe sexual sentiment of modesty very often becomes unhealthy, and is\r\nthen easily combined with pathological sexual conditions.\r\n\r\nPrudery is, so to speak, sexual modesty codified and dogmatized. It is\r\nindeterminate, because the object of modesty is purely conventional,\r\nand man has no valid reason to regard any part of his body as\r\nshameful. Normal man ought only to be ashamed of bad thoughts and\r\nactions, contrary to his moral conscience. The latter should be based\r\non natural human altruism only, and not artificially misled by dogma.\r\n\r\n=The Old Bachelor.=--The importance of the psychic irradiations of\r\nlove is shown perhaps more clearly from the results of their presence\r\nin old bachelors than from any other consideration. In our time, no\r\ndoubt, the state of the old bachelor rarely means the renunciation of\r\nthe satisfaction of sexual appetite, although it generally entails the\r\nrenunciation of love. There are, no doubt, two kinds of old bachelors,\r\nthose who are chaste and those who are not. The old bachelor no doubt\r\nleads a less empty existence than the old maid, but the void exists\r\nnone the less. Man also needs compensation for the absence of love and\r\nfamily, but his brain is more capable than that of woman of finding\r\nthis compensation in hard intellectual work or in some other\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nThe old bachelor is generally pessimistic and morose. He easily\r\nbecomes the slave of his fads and hobbies, and the peculiarities of\r\nhis character are proverbial. His egoism knows no bounds, and his\r\naltruistic impulses usually find too few objects or echoes.\r\n\r\nThe chastity of some old bachelors conceals sexual anomalies. But even\r\napart from this, the old celibate easily becomes shy, affected,\r\nmisanthropic or misogynistic, at least if some energetic friend does\r\nnot induce him to utilize his power of work in some useful sphere. At\r\nother times he lavishes exaggerated admiration on women and worships\r\nthem in a pompous manner.\r\n\r\nIn a separate category come those old bachelors who are chaste and\r\ncelibate for high moral reasons, and whose life is spent in social\r\nwork, although they are only men and cannot for this reason free\r\nthemselves from all the peculiarities we have mentioned. In a word,\r\nthe object of life is partly wanting in the best of old bachelors, and\r\nthis void not only affects his sentiments but his whole mental being.\r\nHis general tendency to pessimism and egoism would be sufficient alone\r\nto provoke an energetic protest against the abandonment of social\r\npower to celibates.\r\n\r\nThe old bachelor who is not chaste generally descends to pornography,\r\nonly becoming acquainted with the worst side of woman. He becomes a\r\nmisogynist because he wrongly attributes to all women the character of\r\nthose only with whom he has intimate relations. We have already\r\npointed out this phenomenon in speaking of male eroticism. The\r\nphilosopher, Schopenhauer, was an example of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nPSYCHIC IRRADIATIONS OF LOVE IN WOMEN\r\n\r\nIn speaking of love in man we have already touched on many points\r\nwhich differentiate it from that of woman. In the latter, the most\r\nprominent peculiarity is the dominant role which it plays in the\r\nbrain. Without love woman abjures her nature and ceases to be normal.\r\n\r\n=The Old Maid.=--What we have said of old bachelors applies in a still\r\nmore marked degree, to old maids. Still more than men they have need\r\nof compensation for sexual love, to avoid losing their natural\r\nqualities and becoming dried-up beings or useless egoists. But, if the\r\nvoid left by love is greater in her, woman possesses such natural\r\nenergy and perseverance, combined with such great power of devotion,\r\nthat on the whole she is more capable than man of accomplishing the\r\nwork which the void in her existence requires. Unfortunately, many\r\nwomen do not understand this. On the other hand, those who devote\r\nthemselves to social philanthropic works, to art or literature, to\r\nnursing the sick or to other useful occupations, instead of amusing\r\nthemselves with futile things, may greatly distinguish themselves in\r\nsuch social pursuits, and thus obtain real compensation for the loss\r\nof love.\r\n\r\nIn this respect woman was formerly misunderstood. The modern movement\r\nof her emancipation shows more and more what she is capable of and\r\npromises much more in the future.\r\n\r\nAs to the old maid who lives alone with her egoism, her whims and\r\nfancies generally exceed those of the old bachelor. She has not the\r\nfaculty of creating anything original by her own intellect, so that,\r\nhaving lost love, all her mental power shrinks up. Her cat, her little\r\ndog, and the daily care of her person and small household occupy her\r\nwhole mind. It is not surprising that such persons generally create a\r\npitiable and ridiculous impression.\r\n\r\nBetween these two extremes there exists a category of unmarried women\r\nwhose sexual love finds compensation in the love they bear for a\r\nparent or a friend (male or female), which although not sexual is none\r\nthe less ardent. Such occupation for their sentiments improves their\r\nstate of mind and partially fills the void; however, it is not\r\nsufficient as a rule and only constitutes a last resource. This kind\r\nof devotion, by its exclusiveness, often produces bad results, for its\r\nhorizon is too limited. If the object of love, which is generally too\r\npampered, dies or abandons her, she loses her head; grief, bitterness\r\nand pessimism never leave her, unless she finds consolation in\r\nreligious exaltation, which is often observed in other women deprived\r\nof love. This last peculiarity is met with, moreover, in all classes\r\nof women, even among the married.\r\n\r\n=Passiveness of Woman. Sexual Appetite.=--Ideal love should never be\r\ndual egoism. What happens when two persons live exclusively for each\r\nother, if one of them dies? The survivor sinks into inconsolable\r\ndespair, all that his heart was attached to is dead, because his love\r\ndid not extend to other human beings, nor to social works. Widows then\r\nbecome as pitiable as old maids, although in another way, when they\r\nhave lost the object of their exclusive love. This is why we recommend\r\nsocial work, not only for celibates, but also for loving couples.\r\n\r\nI again emphasize the fact that in normal women, especially young\r\ngirls, the sexual appetite is subordinate to love. In the young girl\r\nlove is a mixture of exalted admiration for masculine courage and\r\ngrandeur, and an ardent desire for affection and maternity. She wishes\r\nto be outwardly dominated by a man, but to dominate him by her heart.\r\nThis sentimentalism of the young girl, joined to the passive role of\r\nher sex, produces in her a state of exaltation which often borders on\r\necstasy and then overcomes all the resistance of will and reason. The\r\nwoman surrenders herself to the man of whom she is enamored, or who\r\nhas conquered or hypnotized her. She is vanquished by his embraces and\r\nfollows him submissively, and in such a state of mind she is capable\r\nof any folly.\r\n\r\nAlthough more violent and impetuous in his love, man loses his\r\n_sang-froid_ on the whole much less than woman. We can therefore say\r\nthat the relative power of sentiment is on the average greater in\r\nwoman, in spite of her passive role.\r\n\r\nI cannot protest too strongly against the way in which men of the day\r\ndisparage women and misunderstand them. In the way in which a young\r\ngirl abandons herself to their sexual appetites, in caresses, and in\r\nthe ecstasy of her love, they think they see the proof of a purely\r\nsensual eroticism, identical to their libidinous desire for coitus,\r\nwhile in reality she usually does not think of it, at any rate at\r\nfirst. The first coitus is usually painful to woman, often repugnant.\r\nMany are the cases where young girls, even when they knew the terrible\r\nsocial and individual dangers of their weakness, even when they have\r\nperhaps once already experienced the consequences, let the man abuse\r\nthem without a word of complaint, without a trace of sexual pleasure\r\nor venereal orgasm, simply to please the one who desires them, because\r\nhe is so good and amiable, and because refusal would give him so much\r\npain. In his violent passion and in his egoism, man is generally\r\nincapable of understanding the power of this stoicism of a mind which\r\nsurrenders itself in spite of all dangers and all its interests. He\r\nconfounds his own appetites with the sentiments of the woman, and\r\nfinds in this false interpretation of feminine psychology the excuses\r\nfor the cowardice of which he gives proof when he yields to his\r\npassions. The psychology of the young girl who surrenders herself has\r\nbeen admirably depicted by Goethe in _Gretchen_ (\"Faust\"), as well as\r\nby de Maupassant on several occasions.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to know all these facts in order to estimate at its\r\ntrue value the ignominy of our social institutions and their bearing\r\non woman's life. If men did not so misunderstand women, and especially\r\nif they were aware of the deep injustice of our customs and laws with\r\nregard to them, the better ones, at least, would think twice before\r\nseducing young girls, to abandon them afterward with their children. I\r\nam only speaking now of true love and not of the extortion so often\r\npracticed by women of low character, or those already educated in\r\nvice.\r\n\r\nI shall say no more concerning eroticism, which really exists in many\r\nwomen, especially in those who are already experienced in sexual\r\nmatters. On the other hand there are women who deceive their husbands\r\nand allow themselves to be seduced by any Don Juan, even when they\r\nhave never had the least sexual appetite, or felt a single venereal\r\norgasm. They allow themselves to be dragged in the mud and lose their\r\nreputation, their fortune and their family; they even let their\r\nseducer trample them under foot; they become defamed and treated as\r\nwomen without character, without honor and without any notion of duty.\r\nThey are simply poor feeble creatures incapable of resisting\r\nmasculine proposals. With good psychological training they would often\r\nbecome better women, active, devoted and full of life. It seems hardly\r\ncredible, but it is true, that one sometimes finds in this category\r\nwomen who are highly gifted. It is then said that they are wanting in\r\nmoral sense, but this is not always correct. In other respects they\r\nmay be faithful to their duty, devoted, sometimes even energetic and\r\nheroic; but they submit to masculine influence to such a degree that\r\nthey cannot conceive how to resist it. They find it quite natural to\r\ngive way to it and their mind does not understand that the complete\r\nabandonment of their body to the man they love should not necessarily\r\nfollow immediately after the abandonment of their heart, or even after\r\nthe first kiss. It is impossible for them to make distinctions or to\r\ntrace limits.\r\n\r\n=Idealism in Woman.=--The cases I have just described are extreme,\r\nalthough very common; they give the note of a general phenomenon of\r\nfeminine love in its exaltation. It is needless to say that reasonable\r\nwomen of high character behave themselves in quite another manner,\r\nhowever profound their love. Nevertheless the trait which we have just\r\ndescribed is nearly always found at the bottom of all true love in\r\nwoman, however much it may be veiled, dissimulated or conquered.\r\n\r\nIt is not always audacity or heroic deeds like those of the bold\r\ncavaliers of former days which excite love in woman. The external\r\nqualities of man, such as beauty and elegance, etc., also play a part,\r\nalthough their effect may be less decisive than that of the bodily\r\ncharms of woman in exciting love in man. Intellectual superiority,\r\nhigh moral actions, and mental qualities in general, easily affect the\r\nheart of woman, which becomes exalted under their influence. But every\r\nman who becomes famous either for good or evil, the fashionable actor,\r\nthe celebrated tenor, etc., has the power of exciting love in women.\r\nWomen without education or those of inferior mental quality are\r\nnaturally more easily affected by the bodily strength of man, and by\r\nhis external appearance in general. Many women are especially liable\r\nto succumb under the influence of all that is mystic. These become\r\ninfatuated by preachers, and religious enthusiasts, to say nothing of\r\nhypocrites.\r\n\r\nNothing is sadder than the contrast between the exalted love of a\r\nvirtuous and chaste young girl, and the debauched life, with its\r\ntraits of cynical pornography, of the majority of young men. Guy de\r\nMaupassant has described this contrast in a most striking manner in\r\nhis romance entitled \"_Une Vie_.\" I know a number of cases in which\r\nthe complete ignorance of young married women with regard to sexual\r\nrelations, combined with the cynical lewdness of their husbands, has\r\ntransformed the exalted love of a young girl into profound disgust,\r\nand has sometimes even caused mental disorders. Although not very\r\ncommon, the psychoses resulting from the deception and shock of the\r\nnuptial night are not very rare. But what is much worse than this\r\ndouche of cold water which suddenly substitutes the reality of coitus\r\nfor the ideal exaltation of sentiment, are the subsequent discoveries\r\nmade by the young wife, when the cynical mind of her husband on the\r\nsubject of sexual connection and love is unveiled to her in all its\r\ngrossness, resulting from his previous life of debauchery. Torn and\r\nsullied in its deepest fibers, the feminine mind then becomes the seat\r\nof a desperate struggle between reality full of deceptions and the\r\nillusions of a dream of happiness.\r\n\r\nIf it is only a question of bad habits, or want of tact in the\r\nhusband, behind which there exists perhaps true love, the wounds in\r\nthe woman's sentiment may heal and intimacy may develop; but when the\r\ncynicism is too marked, when the habits of sexual debauchery are too\r\ninveterate, the love of a virtuous woman is soon stifled, and is\r\nchanged to resignation and disgust, often to martyrdom or hatred.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the woman is weak and ill-developed and allows herself\r\nto sink to the level of her husband's sentiments. Sometimes, the\r\ncrisis is accentuated and leads to divorce. In de Maupassant's \"_Une\r\nVie_,\" he describes with profound insight the continuous deceptions of\r\na young innocent and sentimental girl who marries an egoistic roué,\r\nand whose life is transformed into martyrdom and completely ruined. De\r\nMaupassant's romances contain such true psychology of sexual life and\r\nlove in all their forms, often even in their exceptional aberrations,\r\nthat they furnish an admirable illustration to the present chapter.\r\n\r\n=Petticoat Government.=--A series of most important irradiations of\r\nlove in woman results from the need she feels of being, if not\r\ndominated, at least protected by her husband. To be happy, a woman\r\nmust be able to respect her husband and even regard him with more or\r\nless veneration; she must see in him the realization of an ideal,\r\neither of bodily strength, courage, unselfishness or superior\r\nintellect. If this is not the case, the husband easily falls under the\r\npetticoat government, or indifference and antipathy may develop in the\r\nwife, at least if misfortune or illness in the husband does not excite\r\nher pity and transform her into a resigned nurse.\r\n\r\nPetticoat government can hardly make a household truly happy, for here\r\nthe positions are reversed and the wife rules because the husband is\r\nweak. But the normal instinct of woman is to rule over the heart of\r\nman, not over his intelligence or on his will. Ruling in these last\r\ndomains may flatter a woman's vanity and render it dominating, but it\r\nnever satisfies her heart, and this is why the woman who rules is so\r\noften unfaithful to her husband, if not in deed, at least in thought.\r\n\r\nIn such a union she has not found the true love which she sought, and\r\nfor this reason, if her moral principles are weak, she looks for\r\ncompensation in some Don Juan. If the woman in question has a strong\r\ncharacter, or if she is sexually cold, she may easily become sour and\r\nbitter. These women, who are not rare, are to be dreaded; their\r\nplighted love is transformed into hatred, bad temper or jealousy, and\r\nonly finds satisfaction in the torment of others.\r\n\r\nThe psychology of this kind of woman is interesting. They are not\r\nusually conscious of their malice. The chronic bitterness resulting\r\nfrom an unfortunate hereditary disposition in their character, as much\r\nas from their outraged feelings, makes them take a dislike to the\r\nworld and renders them incapable of seeing anything but the worst side\r\nof people. They become accustomed to disparage everything\r\nautomatically, to take offense at everything and to speak ill of\r\neverything on every occasion. They are unhappy, but they find a\r\ndiabolical joy in all misfortune where they see the confirmation of\r\ntheir somber prophecies, the only satisfaction which is capable of\r\nexalting them.\r\n\r\nWe have just said that a certain constitutional disposition is\r\nnecessary for such a deplorable change in feminine sentiments to be\r\nproduced; but this disposition is often only developed under the\r\ninfluence of circumstances which we have indicated or analogous ones.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for the life in common of two conjoints not to reveal\r\ntheir reciprocal failings. But true love generally suffices to\r\ndefinitely cement a union, provided that the wife finds a support in\r\nthe steadfast nature of her husband, which then serves as her ideal.\r\nIt is also necessary that the husband, finding sentiments of devoted\r\nlove in his wife, should reciprocate them. These conditions are\r\nsufficient, if both devote their efforts to the maintenance of their\r\nfamily and the social welfare.\r\n\r\n=Maternal Love.=--The most profound and most natural irradiation of\r\nthe sexual appetite in woman is _maternal love_. A mother who does not\r\nlove her children is an unnatural being, and a man who does not\r\nunderstand the desires of maternity in his wife, and does not respect\r\nthem, is not worthy of her love. Sometimes egoism renders a man\r\njealous of the love which his wife bears to his children. At other\r\ntimes, the father may show more love for the children than their\r\nmother; such exceptions only prove the rule.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful and most natural of the irradiations of love is the\r\njoy of parents at the birth of their children, a joy which is one of\r\nthe strongest bonds of conjugal affection, and which helps the couple\r\nin triumphing over the conflicting elements in their characters, and\r\nin raising the moral level of their reciprocal sentiments, for it\r\nrealizes the natural object of sexual union.\r\n\r\nA true woman rejoices at the progress of her pregnancy. The last pains\r\nof childbirth have hardly ceased before she laughs with joy, and\r\npride, at hearing the first cries of the newly born. The instinctive\r\noutburst of maternal love toward the new-born child corresponds to a\r\nnatural imprescriptible right of the child, for it needs the continual\r\ncare of its mother. Nothing is so beautiful in the world as the\r\nradiant joy of a young mother nursing her child, and no sign of\r\ndegeneration is more painful than that of mothers who abandon their\r\nchildren without absolute necessity, to strange hands.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand reason must intervene. The instructive transports of\r\nmaternal love soon require a counterpoise. It is important to prevent\r\nthem from degenerating into unreasonable spoiling, by scientific and\r\nmedical education of the infants. Modern medical art has made great\r\nprogress in this direction, but unfortunately, egoism, negligence,\r\nroutine, the desire of enjoyment, or often the poverty of many mothers\r\nprevent them from benefiting from this progress and applying it as\r\nthey should. Instead of looking after their children they leave them\r\nto nurses. The latter may be necessary to help and instruct young\r\nwives during their first childbirth; but a natural mother will profit\r\nby these instructions and will herself become an excellent nurse,\r\nbecause she will feel her natural ties and will consecrate herself to\r\nthem with the devotion of a maternal love heightened and refined by\r\nreason and knowledge. Among the lower classes the poverty and\r\nignorance of mothers, often also their thoughtlessness and indolence,\r\nare an obstacle to the rational education of infants.\r\n\r\n\"=Monkey's Love.=\"--Maternal love thus constitutes the most important\r\nirradiation of the sexual instincts in woman. It very easily\r\ndegenerates into weakness, that is to say into unreasonable passion\r\nand blind compliance with all the faults of the child, which the\r\nmother excuses and transforms into virtues. The foibles of maternal\r\nlove do much harm to the child and are often the origin of bitter\r\ndeceptions. Hereditary weakness of character here plays a great, or\r\neven the principal part. Nevertheless, maternal foibles have other\r\ncauses--riches, absence of culture, idleness, too few children, etc.\r\n\r\nThe best antidote for this unreasonable maternal love, which the\r\nGermans call \"monkey's love\" consists in active occupations for the\r\nmother, combined with a healthy education of her character. Work alone\r\nis not sufficient, if the mother has limited ideas, and if she is not\r\nfreed from routine, ignorance, superstition and weakness of will.\r\n\r\n=Sentiments and Perseverance.=--The power of love in woman does not\r\nrest alone on the varied harmony of her sentiments of sympathy for her\r\nhusband and children, and on the extraordinary finesse and natural\r\ntact which she adds to it; such qualities make her, no doubt, the ray\r\nof sunshine in the family life, but more powerful still are the\r\ntenacity and perseverance of her love.\r\n\r\nIn general, it is by will-power that woman is superior to man, and it\r\nis in the domain of love that this superiority shines in all its\r\nglory. As a general rule it is the wife who sustains the family. Among\r\nthe common people, it is she who economizes, she who watches carefully\r\nover all and corrects the failings, the passionate and impulsive acts,\r\nthe discouragements, so frequent with the husband. How often do we see\r\nthe father abandon the children, waste his earnings and leave his\r\nsituation under some futile pretext, while his courageous wife,\r\nalthough suffering from hunger and destitution, holds firm and manages\r\nto save the debris which has escaped the excesses and egoism of the\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nThe husband of a feeble or alcoholic wife sometimes becomes the sole\r\nsupport of the family, but such exceptions only prove the rule, that\r\nwhere the normal love and courage of woman are wanting, the family\r\nbecomes broken up, for man very rarely possesses the necessary\r\nfaculties for its preservation.\r\n\r\nIt follows from these facts that the modern tendency of women to\r\nbecome pleasure-seekers, and to take a dislike to maternity, leads to\r\ncomplete degeneration of society. This is a grave social evil, which\r\nrapidly changes the qualities and power of expansion of a race, and\r\nwhich must be cured in time, or the race affected by it will be\r\nsupplanted by others.\r\n\r\nIf the feminine mind is generally wanting in intellectual imagination\r\nand power of combination, it is all the more powerful in the practical\r\nintuition of its judgment and in sentimental imagination. The finesse\r\nof its moral and æsthetic sentiments, its natural tact, its\r\ninstructive desire to put some element of poetry into all the details\r\nof life, contribute to form true family happiness, a happiness which\r\nthe husband and children too often enjoy without fully realizing the\r\ndevoted labor, the love and the pains which the mother has given to\r\ncreate it.\r\n\r\n=Routine.=--The reverse of the irradiations of love in woman is\r\nconstituted by her failings, which we have already partly indicated.\r\nWe may add that her intelligence is usually superficial, that she\r\nattributes an exaggerated importance to trifles, that she often does\r\nnot understand the object of ideal conceptions, and remains attached\r\nby routine to all her hobbies. This routine represents in feminine\r\npsychology the excess of a tenacious will applied only to the\r\nrepetition of what has been taught. In the family, woman constitutes\r\nthe conservative element because sentiment in her much more than in\r\nman, combined with persevering tenacity, predominates over\r\nintelligence; but sentiments represent everywhere and always the\r\nconservative element in the human mind.\r\n\r\nThis is why woman is the strongest supporter of dogmas, customs,\r\nfashions, prejudices and mysticism. It is not that she herself is more\r\ndisposed than man to mystic beliefs, but these when once dogmatized\r\ndazzle the eyes of the suffering with visions of compensation in a\r\nbetter world. In this way a number of unhappy or disappointed women\r\nare affected with religious exaltation and thus cling to the hope of\r\nhappiness after death which they believe will compensate them for the\r\nvicissitudes of their existence.\r\n\r\nThe other reverses of the feminine character, such as want of logic,\r\nobstinacy, love of trinkets, etc., result from the fundamental\r\nweakness of the feminine mind which we have just analyzed. Moreover,\r\nthe social dependence in which man has placed woman, both from the\r\nlegal and educational points of view, tend to increase her failings.\r\nMany people fear that women's suffrage would hinder progress, for the\r\nreasons we have just indicated, but they forget that the actual\r\nsuffrage of men is to a great extent exercised by their wives,\r\nindirectly and unconsciously. This fact alone shows that the\r\neducation, and legal emancipation of women can only be beneficial to\r\nprogress, especially as they would contribute to the education of men,\r\ntoo prone to degenerate on account of their presumptuous and\r\ntyrannical autocracy.\r\n\r\nWoman has an instinctive admiration for men of high intellect and\r\nlofty sentiments, and strives to imitate those who provoke her\r\nadmiration, and carry out their ideas. Let us therefore give women\r\ntheir proper rights, equal to ours, at the same time giving them a\r\nhigher education and the same free instruction as ourselves; we shall\r\nthen see them abandon the obscure paths of mysticism, to devote\r\nthemselves to social progress.\r\n\r\n=Jealousy in Woman.=--Other irradiations of love in woman are similar\r\nto those of man. Jealousy is perhaps not much less developed in woman\r\nthan in man. It is less brutal and violent but more instinctive and\r\npersevering; it manifests itself by quarrels, needle pricks,\r\nchicanery, petty tyrannies and all kinds of tricks which poison\r\nexistence as much as man's jealousy, and are quite as inefficient\r\nagainst infidelity. In the highest degree of passion the jealous man\r\nuses violence or resorts to firearms, while the woman scratches,\r\npoisons or stabs. Among savages, jealous women bite off their rivals'\r\nnoses; in civilized countries they throw sulphuric acid in the face.\r\nThe object is the same in both cases--to disfigure.\r\n\r\nAmorous illusions produced in woman by the sexual appetite are\r\nanalogous to those of man, but are modified by feminine attributes. It\r\nis the same with hypocrisy. The passive role of woman in sexual life\r\nobliges her only to betray her feelings to the object of her desires\r\nin a reserved and prudent manner. She cannot make advances toward man\r\nwithout contravening the conventions and risking her reputation. She\r\ntherefore has to be more skillful in the art of dissimulation. This\r\ngives us no right to accuse her of falseness, for this art is natural,\r\ninstinctive and imposed by custom. Her desire for love and maternity\r\nunconsciously urges her to make herself as desirable as possible to\r\nman by her grace and allurements. Her stolen glances and sighs, and\r\nthe play of her expression serve to betray her ardor as through a\r\nveil. Behind this furtive play, especially calculated to excite the\r\npassions of man, are hidden, in the natural and good woman, a world of\r\ndelicate feelings, ideal aspirations, energy and perseverance, which\r\nare much more loyal and honest than the motives revealed by the more\r\nbrusque and daring manner in which man expresses his desires. The fine\r\nphrases by which man's love is expressed generally cover sentiments\r\nwhich are much less pure and calculations much more egoistic than the\r\nrelatively innocent play of the young girl. No doubt there are false\r\nwomen whose amorous wiles are only a spider's web, but we are speaking\r\nhere of the average, and not of exceptions.\r\n\r\n=Coquetry.=--The sexual braggardism of man is only found in some\r\nprostitutes; it is replaced in woman by coquetry and the desire to\r\nplease. Vain women profit by the natural grace and beauty of their sex\r\nand person, not only to attract and please men, but also to shine\r\namong their fellows, to make other women pale before their brilliance\r\nand their elegance. Coquettes take infinite pains in this art. All\r\ntheir efforts and all their thoughts are directed only to increase\r\ntheir charm by the brilliancy of their toilette, the refinement of\r\ntheir attire, the arrangement of their hair, their perfumes, paint and\r\npowder, etc. It is here that the narrowness of the mind of woman is\r\nrevealed in all its meanness.\r\n\r\nTo describe feminine coquetry would oblige me to descend to banality.\r\nIf we go to a ball or a fashionable _soirée_, if we observe women at\r\nthe theater, their toilettes, their looks and expressions, or if we\r\nread a novel by Guy de Maupassant, \"Fort Comme la Mort,\" or \"Nôtre\r\nCoeur,\" for example, we can study all the degrees and all the\r\ndegeneration of this part of the sexual psychology of women. Many of\r\nthem have such bad taste that they transform themselves into\r\ncaricatures; dye their hair, paint their eyebrows and lips to give\r\nthemselves the appearance of what they are not, or to make themselves\r\nappear young and beautiful.\r\n\r\nThese artifices of civilized countries resemble the tattooing,\r\nnose-rings, etc., with which savage women adorn themselves. The latter\r\nare represented by earrings, bracelets and necklaces. All these\r\ncustoms constitute irradiations of the sexual appetite or the desire\r\nto please men. Male sexual inverts (vide Chap. VIII) also practice\r\nthem, and often also certain dandies with otherwise normal sexual\r\ninstincts.\r\n\r\n=The Pornographic Spirit in Woman.=--This is absolutely contrary to\r\nthe normal feminine nature, which cannot be said of eroticism. Among\r\nprostitutes, as we have seen, the pornographic spirit is only the echo\r\nof their male companions, and in spite of this, we still find a\r\nvestige of modesty even in them. No doubt, in very erotic women,\r\nsexual excitations may lead to indecent acts and expressions, but\r\nthese are rare exceptions and of a pathological nature.\r\n\r\nNatural feminine eroticism, not artificially perverted, only shows\r\nitself openly in complete intimacy, and even here modesty and the\r\næsthetic sense of woman correct and attenuate it. Normally, all\r\nobscenity and cynicism disgusts women and only inspires them with\r\ncontempt for the male sex. On the other hand, they are easily\r\nstimulated to eroticism by pictures or novels, if they are\r\nsufficiently æsthetic, or even moral. This is a great danger for both\r\nsexes, especially for woman--eroticism dissimulated under hypocritical\r\nforms, and intended to idealize dishonest intentions (vide de\r\nMaupassant: \"_Ce Cochon de Morin_\").\r\n\r\n=Modesty and Prudery in Woman.=--In woman the sentiments of modesty\r\nand prudery have a peculiar character, which results from her natural\r\ndisgust for pornography on the one hand, and also from her attachment\r\nto fashion and prejudice. Many women have a perfect terror of exposing\r\ncertain parts of their body, even to a medical man. This fact depends\r\non convention, and sometimes on the absence or perversion of sexual\r\nfeelings. Brought up to prudery, sometimes to an absurd extent as in\r\nEngland, these women lose their natural feeling and often suffer from\r\nthe excitation, indignation, and perpetual fright, which result from\r\nit. The exaggerations of prudery, moreover, easily lead to opposite\r\nexcesses, or else degenerate into hypocrisy. The prude is ashamed of\r\nthe most natural things, and undergoes continual torment.\r\n\r\nPrudery can be created or cured by education in childhood. It may be\r\ncreated by isolation, by covering all parts of the body, and\r\nespecially by making children regard nudity as shameful. On the other\r\nhand, it may be cured by mixed bathing, by accustoming the child to\r\nconsider the human body, in all its parts and functions, as something\r\nnatural of which one need not be ashamed, lastly by giving instruction\r\non the relations of the sexes, in due time and in a serious manner,\r\ninstead of replying to ingenuous questions by pious falsehoods, by\r\nequivocation, or by an air of mystery.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on love is infinite, and its relations to the sexual\r\nappetite make it still more complex. We shall confine ourselves to\r\nindicating two more of its irradiations, peculiar to each sex, but\r\nhaving for each a physionomy corresponding to its own mentality.\r\n\r\n\r\nFETICHISM AND ANTI-FETICHISM\r\n\r\n\"We understand by fetiches, objects, portions of objects, or even\r\nsimply the qualities of objects which, from their association with a\r\ncertain person or with the idea of this person, produce a kind of\r\ncharm or at least a profound impression, which in no way corresponds\r\nto the nature of the object itself.\"--(Krafft-Ebing.) The fetich thus\r\nsymbolizes a person in whom we have such a profound interest that\r\neverything connected with her disturbs our feelings. It is we\r\nourselves who place in the fetich the charm arising from the person\r\nwhom it symbolizes for us.\r\n\r\nIn many religions fetichism plays an important part, so much so that\r\nfetiches such as amulets or relics produce ecstasy in the faithful.\r\n\r\nBinet, Krafft-Ebing and others give the name _erotic fetichism_ to the\r\ncharm which certain objects or certain parts of the body exercise in a\r\nsimilar way on the sexual desires or even on love, in the sense that\r\ntheir simple representation is powerfully associated with the erotic\r\nimage of a person of the other sex, or with a particular variety of\r\nsexual excitation. In both man and woman certain portions of the\r\nclothes or the body, the hair, the foot and hand, or certain odors of\r\nthe person desired, may take the character of fetiches. It is the same\r\nwith certain intellectual peculiarities and certain expressions of the\r\nfeatures. In man, the woman's hair, her hands or feet, her\r\nhandkerchief, perfumes, etc., often play the part of erotic fetiches.\r\n\r\nWe may call _anti-fetiches_ certain objects or certain qualities\r\nwhich, on the contrary, destroy eroticism. Certain odors, the tone of\r\na voice, an ugly nose, a garment in bad taste, an awkward manner,\r\noften suffice to destroy eroticism by causing disgust for a person,\r\nand their simple representation is enough to make her unbearable.\r\nSymbolizing disgust, the anti-fetich paralyzes the sexual appetite and\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nIn normal love, it is especially by association of ideas in calling to\r\nmind the image of the person loved that the fetich plays the part of\r\nan exciting agent. It often, however, becomes itself the more special\r\nobject of the sexual appetite, while the anti-fetich produces the\r\nopposite effect. But, in degenerates (vide Chap. VIII) it is sometimes\r\nexclusively to the fetich itself that an irresistible sexual appetite\r\nis addressed, the irradiation of which becomes a ridiculous caricature\r\nof love.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that normal love is based on an extremely complex\r\nsynthesis, on a symphony of harmonious sensations, sentiments and\r\nconceptions, combined in all kinds of tones and shades. The\r\npathological aberrations of which we shall speak, demonstrate this by\r\nforcing one tone or another to the more or less marked exclusion of\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nPSYCHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF LOVE TO RELIGION\r\n\r\nLove and eroticism play a great part in religion, and many derivatives\r\nof religious sentiment are intimately associated with the sexual\r\nappetite. As Krafft-Ebing says, _religious ecstasy_ is closely related\r\nto _amorous ecstasy_, and very often appears in the guise of\r\nconsolation and compensation for an unhappy or disappointed love, or\r\neven in the absence of sexual love. In the insane, religion and\r\neroticism are combined in a very characteristic manner. Among a number\r\nof peoples certain cruel religious customs are the result of\r\ntransformed erotic conceptions.\r\n\r\nAs in religion, there is something mystical in love; the ineffable\r\ndream of eternal ecstasy. This is why the two kinds of mystic and\r\nerotic exaltation become blended in religions.\r\n\r\nKrafft-Ebing attributes the cruelty found in many religions to\r\n_sadism_ (sexual lust excited by the sufferings of others). (Vide\r\nChap. VIII.)\r\n\r\n\"The relationship so often established between religion, lust and\r\ncruelty can be reduced almost to the following formula: at the acme of\r\ntheir development, the religious and sexual passions show a\r\nconcordance in quality and in quantity of excitation, and may\r\nconsequently replace each other, under certain circumstances. Under\r\nspecial pathological influences, both may be transformed into\r\ncruelty.\"--(Krafft-Ebing.)\r\n\r\nWe shall return to this subject in Chapters VIII and XII.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] This tendency of man has been analyzed with a very refined\r\npsychology by _Labiche_, in one of his most celebrated comedies: \"_Le\r\nvoyage de M. Perichon._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nETHNOLOGY AND HISTORY OF SEXUAL LIFE IN MAN AND IN MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the study of the sexual question it is absolutely necessary to\r\nguard against subjectiveness and all preconceived theory, and to avoid\r\nsentimentalism as well as eroticism. These two dangers play a\r\nconsiderable part in the study of human sexual life. Presented in a\r\nconscientious and scientific way the history of marriage furnishes us\r\nthe most trustworthy material for the study of the sexual relations of\r\nman in social life. It is from this material that we can learn the\r\nrelative importance of the different psychological and\r\npsycho-pathological factors in social evolution. But, to furnish valid\r\nmaterial, history must not only be based on trustworthy and veracious\r\nsources; it must also give a comparative study of the sexual relations\r\nwhich exist in most, if not all, of the peoples actually existing. The\r\npresent savage tribes no doubt resemble more closely the primitive\r\npeoples than our hybrid agglomeration of the civilized world.\r\nMoreover, the modern study of ethnology gives us more certain\r\ninformation than the uncertain, incomplete and often fabulous\r\nstatements of ancient documents. I am speaking here of primitive\r\nhistory, and not of the Greek and Roman civilizations. Unfortunately\r\nthe correctness of ethnological observations, and especially their\r\ninterpretation, still leave much to be desired.\r\n\r\nEdward Westermark, professor at Helsingfors, in his \"History of Human\r\nMarriage,\" has given us a monumental work, which is remarkable, not\r\nonly for the richness and exactness of its material, but also for the\r\nclearness and good sense of its criticism. I shall give a _résumé_ of\r\nWestermark's results, as the subject is beyond the domain of my\r\nspecial studies. The author has collected a great number of\r\nobservations in order to avoid erroneous conclusions. He warns the\r\nreader against a hasty generalization, which attributes without proof\r\ncertain customs of living savage tribes to our primitive ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapter we have considered the phylogeny of love in\r\ngeneral. We have seen that some of the lower animals, such as the ants\r\nand bees, give evidence of an instinctive social altruism much greater\r\nthan that of man, while other animals, such as birds, are superior to\r\nus as regards monogamous conjugal fidelity. But it is a question here\r\nof analogies due to phenomena of convergence, and these animals are of\r\ninterest to us only as remote objects of comparison.\r\n\r\nAs regards marriage in primitive man, we can only compare ourselves\r\nwith the living animals most closely allied to us, viz. the\r\n_anthropoid apes_.\r\n\r\nIn most mammals, marriage (if we may give this name to their sexual\r\nunion) is only of very short duration, depending on the time necessary\r\nfor the procreation of a single brood of young. After copulation the\r\nmale generally pays little attention to the female, beyond protecting\r\nher for a certain time. In the anthropoid apes (orang-utan,\r\nchimpanzee, gorilla and gibbon) however, we find monogamous marriage\r\nand the institution of family life. The male protects the female and\r\nthe young, and the latter are often of different ages, showing the\r\nexistence of conjugal fidelity extending beyond one birth. While the\r\nfemale and the young remain in their nest, perched on a tree, the male\r\ntakes his place at the foot of the tree and watches over the safety of\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\nAccording to Westermark this was probably the same in primitive man.\r\nFormed by the father, the mother and the children, the family was in\r\nprimitive man a general institution, based on monogamy, polygamy or\r\npolyandry. The wife looked after the children, and the husband\r\nprotected the family. No doubt, the husband was not particularly\r\nanxious for the welfare of his wife and children, but concerned\r\nhimself chiefly in the satisfaction of his sexual appetite and his\r\npride. He was useful, however, in building the nest, or hut, in\r\nprocuring the necessary food, and in defending his family.\r\n\r\nMost legends relate that primitive man lived in promiscuity with\r\nwomen, without marriage, and that marriage was instituted by some god\r\nor by some law. But this opinion, which is still held by most modern\r\nauthors, is quite erroneous, as Westermark has demonstrated in a\r\nmasterly manner, by the aid of documents which are absolutely\r\nconclusive.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the husband to provide food for the family is a general\r\nlaw among savage peoples. A confirmation of this law is found in the\r\nfact that most often in polygamous races the man has only the right to\r\nas many wives as he can support. Every man must give proof that he is\r\ncapable of feeding his family. Even after divorce the husband's duties\r\ncontinue, and may even be transmitted to his heirs. For example, among\r\ncertain peoples, his brother is obliged to marry his widow. The\r\nhusband's duties appear to be inherited from the higher apes, among\r\nwhom conjugal fidelity lasts longer than the sexual appetite. This\r\nfidelity has therefore deep phylogenetic roots in our nature, and we\r\nshall see later on that we cannot neglect it without compromising our\r\nsocial state (Chap. XIII).\r\n\r\nThe following is the definition of marriage as given by Westermark:\r\n_Marriage is a sexual union of variable duration between men and\r\nwomen, a union which is continued after copulation, at least till the\r\nbirth of the child._\r\n\r\nAccording to this definition, there may be monogamous, polygamous and\r\npolyandrous marriages, as well as marriage in groups and limited\r\nmarriage. It is evident that permanent monogamous unions, such as\r\noccur in birds and the higher apes, are, according to this definition,\r\ntrue marriages, of better quality even than those of many men.\r\n\r\nAmong animals which have a definite rutting period, marriage cannot\r\ndepend solely on the sexual appetite, or egoistic eroticism, without\r\nceasing with the rut. It follows from this that natural selection and\r\nthe mneme (engraphia) have derived from the sexual appetite certain\r\nsocial or altruistic instincts, with the object of preserving the\r\nspecies by protection of the young. Although not the only means of\r\npreserving the species, such instincts are certainly important.\r\n\r\nThe family is thus the root of marriage. This explains the custom,\r\namong certain races, of marriage only becoming valid after the birth\r\nof a child. In many forms of marriage by purchase, the wife is even\r\nbound to return to her husband the sum paid for her if she remains\r\nsterile, and among many savages the marriage is only celebrated after\r\nthe birth of the first child. In Borneo, relations between the sexes\r\nare free till pregnancy occurs, and it is this which determines the\r\nduties of marriage. In this respect, these savages are more just and\r\nwiser than us.\r\n\r\nIn man, a special reason in favor of marriage is the fact that he has\r\nno rutting period. In animals the rutting period is generally\r\nregulated so that the young are born exactly at the time of year when\r\nthey will find food most abundant. For example, the muscardin\r\ncopulates in July and brings forth young in August, at the time when\r\nnuts are ripe, while elephants, whales and certain monkeys, who find\r\nfood at all seasons, do not copulate at any definite period.\r\n\r\nThe anthropoid apes, however, have a rutting period, and something\r\nanalogous is found among certain human races (Californians, Hindus and\r\ncertain Australians) in the spring, when sexual orgies are indulged\r\nin. In man there is no particular correlation between eroticism and\r\nthe possibility of easily obtaining food for the children at the time\r\nof birth. Nevertheless, a recrudescence of the sexual appetite is\r\ngenerally observed in the spring and beginning of summer, with a\r\ncorresponding increase in the number of conceptions. This is probably\r\nexplained by the fact that infants born in the autumn or winter are\r\nmore robust. Moreover, natural selection has almost entirely ceased in\r\ncivilized peoples, owing to the artificial means used to rear\r\nchildren, and to the diminution which results from their mortality.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the institution of marriage in man does not depend on\r\nthe excitation of the sexual appetite, for this is, on the whole,\r\ncontinuous.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIQUITY OF MATRIMONIAL INSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\nThe fact that the anthropoid apes produce feeble and dependent young,\r\nwhose infancy is long, has probably been the origin of marriage.\r\nKautsky says that in primitive man the child belongs to the clan; but\r\nthis is an error. Originally, human societies were composed of\r\nfamilies, or rather associations of families. In primitive man, these\r\nfamilies play the fundamental role and constitute the nucleus of\r\nsociety. In the anthropoid ape we already find the family, but not the\r\nclan. This must also have been the case with the pithecanthropoids and\r\nother extinct transitory forms. In fact, the lowest savages still live\r\nas isolated families like the carnivorous mammals, rather than in\r\nclans or tribes. This is the case, for example, with the Weddas of\r\nCeylon, the indigenes of Terra del Fuego, the aboriginal Australians,\r\nthe Esquimaux and certain Indians of Brazil. In this way they have\r\nbetter conditions for subsistence.\r\n\r\nIn primitive times therefore, man lived in families, on the produce of\r\nthe chase. Later on, the spirit of discovery, the more abundant food\r\nobtained by traps and by the cultivation of plants allowed men to live\r\nin tribes. Thus, intellectual development was the first cause of\r\nsocial life in man, and Lubbock is certainly wrong in considering that\r\nthe establishment of clans dates further back than the first beginning\r\nof civilization. Westermark's conclusions are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1). _At no period of human existence has family life been replaced by\r\nclan life._\r\n\r\n(2). _Conjugal life is a heritage from ancestors who lived in a\r\nsimilar way to the anthropoid apes of the present day._\r\n\r\n(3). _Although less intimately and less constantly bound to the\r\nchildren than to the mother, the father has always been in man the\r\nprotector of the family._\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICISM OF THE DOCTRINE OF PROMISCUITY\r\n\r\nMost sociologists believe with Lubbock, Bachofen, MacLennan, Bastian,\r\nGiraud-Teulon, Wilkens, and others that primitive man lived in sexual\r\npromiscuity. If we agree with Westermark that the term marriage\r\nincludes polygamy, polyandry and limited marriage, the opinion of\r\nthese authors is wrong. What they have considered as promiscuity can\r\nalways be included in one of these forms of marriage, even among the\r\nindigenes of Hayti, whose life is the most debauched. The author who\r\nhas most confused the question is Fison, with his dogmatic theories\r\nconcerning the Australians. Obliged to admit that promiscuity does not\r\nexist among these people, he still maintains that it existed formerly.\r\nCurr, who was better acquainted than Fison with the Australians, has\r\nproved that they are normally monogamous.\r\n\r\nSimilar statements of Bastian, Wilkens and others concerning the\r\nKustchins, the natives of Terra del Fuego, are also incorrect. In none\r\nof the African tribes is there communion of women, the men, on the\r\nother hand, are extremely jealous. Promiscuity is not observed among\r\nsavage and primitive races, but among people already civilized, such\r\nas the Buddhist Butias, in whom man knows neither honor nor jealousy.\r\nThe savage Weddas are monogamous, and one of their proverbs says:\r\n\"Death alone can separate woman from man.\"\r\n\r\nThere is in reality only one true form of promiscuity--the\r\nprostitution of modern civilized races, who have introduced it among\r\nsavages, subjecting them to gratify their own lust. Among many savage\r\nraces there exists, on the contrary, a very severe monogamy, and they\r\npunish with death every seducer and illegitimate child, as well as the\r\nmother. Among others, however, considerable sexual freedom is allowed\r\nbefore or after marriage. It is impossible to lay down definite rules,\r\nbut one thing may be regarded as universal, viz., that the sexual\r\ndepravity of savage races most often arises from the influence of\r\ncivilized people who immigrate among them and systematically introduce\r\nimmorality and debauchery. It is the white colonists who appropriate\r\nthe women of savage races and train them in the worst forms of\r\nprostitution. It is the white colonists who introduce alcoholic drink\r\nwhich disorganizes the most virtuous and loyal habits, and ends with\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nCertain Arab clans exploit European habits of prostitution by sending\r\ntheir young girls to brothels for purposes of gain. When they have\r\naccumulated a sufficient fortune they return home and marry one of\r\ntheir fellow countrymen. Similar customs are observed among other\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nIn this connection Westermark points out that the more advanced is\r\ncivilization, the greater is the number of illegitimate births, and\r\nthe more widespread is prostitution. In Europe, the proportion of\r\nnatural children and of prostitutes is nearly double in the towns what\r\nit is in the country. This shows the absurdity of regarding\r\npromiscuity as a primitive state; on the contrary, it is a rotten\r\nfruit of civilization, and especially of semi-civilization. Primitive\r\ncustoms are generally chaste, and it is civilization which corrupts\r\nthem. In Europe, prostitution is increasing, while marriage is\r\nbecoming less frequent; it is the latter which constitutes the\r\nprimitive and normal state.\r\n\r\nWestermark admits, as we have mentioned above, that sexual liberty\r\nbefore or after marriage exists among certain tribes; but in spite of\r\nthis the custom of careful choice always exists among these people,\r\nand this renders their unions comparatively lasting. He cites as an\r\nexample the Tounghtas of India, who practice sexual connection before\r\nmarriage, but among whom these connections nearly always lead to\r\nmarriage; this race considers prostitution as dishonorable.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, make one objection to Westermark. Promiscuity in\r\nitself is not necessarily prostitution, for the latter signifies\r\nespecially the sale of the body, which is not the case in promiscuity.\r\nThe fundamental fact which prevents us admitting the existence of\r\nprimitive promiscuity among savage races is the following: As soon as\r\nthe two sexes are free, the monogamous instinct of the woman and\r\njealousy of both sexes combine to reëstablish marriage. True\r\npromiscuity can only exist by means of a sort of legal obligation,\r\nsuch as exists in the colony of Oneidas in New York. In this colony\r\nthe members formally agree to mutual and free sexual intercourse. We\r\nmust not forget that prostitution is only kept up in women by the\r\nthirst for lucre, and ceases immediately this element disappears.\r\n\r\nBefore the Reformation there existed in Scotland a singular custom\r\ncalled \"hand-fasting,\" by which young men had the right to choose a\r\ncompanion for a year, at the end of which time they could either\r\nseparate or become married according to their inclination.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Lubbock mentions certain customs in Greece and\r\nIndia, the worship of _phallus_, for example, which obliged young\r\ngirls to give themselves to all men. But these customs were not among\r\nprimitive races but resulted from the eroticism of highly civilized\r\nnations. Thus, Lubbock's argument concerning the existence of\r\nprimitive promiscuity falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nCertain savage nations offer their daughters or their servants, rarely\r\ntheir wives, to their guests. A _jus primæ nocti_ (right to the first\r\nnight) has also existed and will sometimes exist in some tribes, but\r\nthis right is reserved for the chiefs, kings or priests, and allows\r\nthem to have sexual intercourse before the husband with every newly\r\nmarried woman during the first night of the nuptials. This is a\r\nbarbarous custom based on the right of the stronger, and analogous to\r\nthe privileges claimed by the European nobles from their serfs or\r\npeasants. But such abuses do not constitute promiscuity, as Lubbock\r\nmaintains.\r\n\r\nIn many countries the courtesans and concubines were held in high\r\nesteem, and are so even at the present day, more than is supposed; but\r\nthis again is not a question of promiscuity.\r\n\r\nMorgan has deduced his theories of promiscuity from terms employed in\r\ncertain savage dialects to designate relationship. These conclusions\r\nare false and Morgan, like others, has been led into error by the\r\nobscurity of the language of these people. The simple fact that\r\npaternal parentage is recognised among them proves the absurdity of\r\nMorgan's reasoning, for promiscuity cannot recognize paternal\r\nparentage.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 Bachofen drew attention to the ancient custom of naming the\r\nchildren after the maternal side, and it is now certain that this\r\ncustom has existed among many primitive races, while in others\r\nchildren were named after the paternal side. The term _matriarchy_ is\r\ngiven to denomination after the maternal side. MacLennan maintains the\r\nexistence of matriarchy in promiscuity, but this is inadmissible.\r\nMaternity is self-evident, while paternity can only be proved\r\nindirectly by the aid of reasoning. No doubt all nations appear to\r\nhave recognized the real part which the father takes in every\r\nconception, and from this results the singular custom among certain\r\ntribes, in which the husband retires to his couch and fasts during the\r\naccouchement of his wife.\r\n\r\nWestermark explains matriarchy in a simpler and more natural way, by\r\nthe intimate relations of the child to the mother. Children,\r\nespecially when they are still young, follow the mother when she\r\nseparates from the father. Matriarchy is quite natural in marriages of\r\nshort duration, with change of wives, and in polygamy; while, in\r\nmonogamous nations, it is _patriarchy_, or denomination after the\r\npaternal line, which dominates.\r\n\r\nAmong nations where the denomination of uncles exists, and where the\r\nmarried woman lives with her family till she has a child, matriarchy\r\nresults quite naturally from this fact. In Japanese families who have\r\nonly daughters, the husband of the eldest takes his wife's family\r\nname. Among savages in general, the name has a great importance. When\r\nrank and property are only inherited in the female line, the children\r\nare always named after this line. We are thus concerned here with very\r\ncomplex questions which have nothing to do with promiscuity.\r\n\r\nMaine has proved that prostitution and promiscuity lead to sterility\r\nand decadence. Among the few tribes in which polyandry is the rule,\r\nespecially in Thibet, several brothers generally have the same wife.\r\nBut they usually alternate, and never dwell together. In the fifteenth\r\ncentury, in the Canary Islands, every woman had three husbands, each\r\nof whom lived with her for a month, and the one who was to possess her\r\nduring the following month had to work both for her and for the other\r\ntwo husbands. Polyandry has always originated in scarcity of women.\r\n\r\nThe jealousy of men, which has never ceased to exist, gives the\r\nclearest proof of the impossibility of promiscuity. Polyandry is only\r\npossible among a few feeble and degenerate races who ignore jealousy.\r\nThese tribes are diminishing and tend to disappear. The jealousy of\r\nsavages is generally so terrible that among them a woman who commits\r\nadultery is usually put to death along with her seducer. Sometimes\r\nthey are content with cutting off her nose or inflicting other\r\nchastisement. It is from jealousy that results the obligation of\r\nchastity in the woman.\r\n\r\nReligious ideas on the future of man after death are often combined\r\nwith these ideas; this is why chastity, death, or even all kinds of\r\ntorture are, in certain countries, imposed on the woman after death of\r\nthe husband.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that among most savages the wife is regarded\r\nas the property of her husband. If the latter lends his wife to a\r\nguest, he offers her as part of a feast. This is not, however,\r\npromiscuity, and we must understand that these people have quite\r\ndifferent sentiments to ours. In clans or tribes the most powerful men\r\nhave always had the youngest and most beautiful wives.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there is not the shadow of proof in support of the doctrine\r\nof primitive promiscuity, a doctrine which is based on purely\r\nhypothetical grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE AND CELIBACY\r\n\r\nAmong animals the voluntary celibate exists only among the females of\r\ncertain birds which have become widowed, and even then the case is\r\nrare. In savage man, nearly every individual marries, and the women\r\nlook upon celibacy or widowhood almost in the same way as death. The\r\nsavage despises celibates as thieves or sorcerers. In his opinion a\r\nman without a wife is not a man. He therefore marries at a much\r\nearlier age than civilized man, sometimes even (in Greenland) before\r\nfecundation is possible. Among certain Indians men sometimes marry at\r\nthe age of nine or ten years, generally between fourteen and eighteen;\r\nthe girls between nine and twelve. In some comparatively civilized\r\nnations the celibate is so much despised that they go as far as\r\nmarrying the spirits of departed children! Among the Greeks, celibates\r\nwere punished, and among the Romans they were taxed heavily. Celibacy\r\nbecomes more rare the further we go back in the history of the human\r\nrace; celibacy increases with the corruption of morals. It is\r\ncivilization which does most harm to marriage, especially in the large\r\ntowns, and the age at which people marry becomes more and more\r\nadvanced, although in Europe there are more women than men. Want of\r\nmoney and insufficient salaries diminish more and more the number of\r\nmarriages in the large centers, while among savages, and also among\r\nour peasants, the women and children are one of the principal sources\r\nof wealth, because they work and have few needs. Among the middle\r\nclasses, on the contrary, the wife is a source of expense, as well as\r\nthe education of the children. For men, the length of intellectual and\r\nprofessional education (and military service in many countries) cause\r\nmarriage to be postponed and celibacy is obligatory at the time when\r\nthe sexual appetite is most powerful. Thus, the more civilization\r\nadvances, the longer is marriage postponed. The refinement and the\r\nmultiplicity of pleasures also diminish the attractions of marriage.\r\n\r\nLastly, intellectual culture exalts the desire for the ideal, so that\r\nmen and women well suited to each other meet less frequently, as their\r\nmutual adaptation becomes more complicated.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I must repeat here what I have already said concerning\r\nthe way in which novelists present us with the extreme passions of\r\nill-balanced people and describe them as types, the normal man being\r\ntoo prosaic to attract their readers. Rotten as it is with neurotic\r\ndegenerates, our modern society is certainly not wanting in\r\npathological models for the novelists, but it is nevertheless false to\r\nalways put these into prominence. The cultured man of well-balanced\r\nmind, adapts himself to marriage on the whole very well, and is not\r\nalways so difficult to please. However, it must be recognized that\r\nmarriage becomes less easy if a too high ideal is expected from it.\r\nWith characteristic prudence, Westermark does not answer the question\r\nwhether marriage will progressively diminish in the future.\r\n\r\n=The Cult of Virgins. Sanctity of the Celibate.=--Among many savages\r\nthe singular idea obtains that there is something impure in sexual\r\nintercourse. The celibacy ordained by several religions originates\r\nfrom ideas of this kind.\r\n\r\nMany nations have worshiped virgins, for instance the vestal virgins\r\nof the Romans. The mother of Buddha was declared to be holy and pure,\r\nBuddha having been conceived supernaturally, according to the legend.\r\nA Buddhist monk is forbidden to have sexual intercourse, even with\r\nanimals! Celibacy among certain priests exists also in China.\r\n\r\nAmong the Hebrews, the idea of the impurity of marriage had got a\r\nfooting, and this no doubt powerfully influenced Christianity. St.\r\nPaul thus places celibacy higher than marriage, and this is how the\r\nidea became established among the fathers of the Church that the\r\nrepression of all sensuality was a cardinal virtue, and that God had\r\ncontemplated in paradise an asexual reproduction of the human species,\r\nwhich was annulled by the fall of Adam. Men who remained pure were to\r\nbe immortal. \"The earth is filled with marriage and the heavens with\r\nvirginity,\" says Jeremiah. Such are the ideas which have given rise to\r\nthe obligation of celibacy for priests.\r\n\r\nWestermark thinks that the idea of impurity attached to sexual\r\nintercourse is possibly derived from the instinctive repugnance\r\nexperienced by members of the same family to have sexual intercourse\r\nbetween themselves. Banished from the family circle this intercourse\r\nwas tainted with a stigma which offended modesty, and by the\r\nassociation of ideas so common in man, this stigma was extended to\r\nlegal marriage outside the family. Moreover, religious celibacy is\r\ncomplicated by ascetic conceptions, and the idea of the impurity of\r\nsexual intercourse is by no means general.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I think rather that the jealousy natural to both sexes\r\nhas gradually compelled them to limit their sexual intercourse to\r\nintimacy and to conceal it. But man is ashamed of everything which he\r\nconceals, and we shall soon see that the sentiment of modesty concerns\r\nall parts of the body which are concealed. This simple fact is\r\nsufficient to give rise to the idea that coitus is impure, and I do\r\nnot think it necessary to seek any further explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCES MADE BY ONE SEX TO THE OTHER--DEMANDS IN MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nA natural law compels the male germinal cell to move toward the egg;\r\nexceptions to this law are rare, the female germinal cells being\r\nlarger and produced in less number. It follows that in copulation, or\r\nthe union of individual sexual entities, man included, it is the male\r\nwhich is the active party and makes the advances. Among certain tribes\r\n(Paraguayans, Garos, Moquis), however, it is the female who makes the\r\nadvances. Everyone knows the combats for the female which takes place\r\nbetween the male of animals, cocks and stags for example. Among\r\ncertain Indians similar struggles are also observed, after which the\r\nvanquished has to surrender his wife to the conqueror. The same custom\r\nobtained among the ancient Greeks, as we see in the suitors for\r\nPenelope. In Ireland similar customs prevailed up to the last few\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we often see among savages and among birds the\r\nfavors of the female obtained by assiduous courtship rather than by\r\ncombat. In some savage tribes struggles take place between the females\r\nfor possession of the male. However, it is usually coquetry in all its\r\ndegrees which furnishes woman with the basis for her advances. In many\r\nnations, if not in most, women have the right to refuse a demand for\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF ATTRACTION\r\n\r\n=Adornment in the Two Sexes.=--Vanity is older than man, for it is\r\nfound in many animals. The lowest and most savage peoples adorn\r\nthemselves. Tattooing, staining the skin, rings on the arms and feet,\r\nin the lips, nose and ears serve to attract one sex toward the other.\r\nA Santal woman may carry as much as fifteen kilogrammes of ornaments\r\non her body. Vanity leads to incredible eccentricities, certain\r\ntribes, for example, pull out their teeth to increase their\r\nattractions. Absurdities of this kind are often associated with\r\nreligious ideas, although the latter generally play a secondary part.\r\nThe true origin of these customs lies in vanity, combined with the\r\nsexual desire to captivate. In hot climates, at any rate, the savages\r\nonly commenced to cover their bodies with clothes with the object of\r\npleasing by personal adornment. The religious observances attached to\r\nthe custom of adornment are not primitive. The latter is derived from\r\nthe sexual appetite and from vanity, and has only been incorporated in\r\nthe dogmas of religious mysticism after being first established in the\r\nhabits of the people.\r\n\r\nAmong savages the men are more inclined to personal adornment and to\r\ncoquetry than the women. This is not due to the inferior social\r\nposition of the women, for those who enjoy the greatest liberty are\r\noften less extensively tattooed than those who are reduced to slavery.\r\nThe true reason is that the man risks much more than the woman by\r\nremaining celibate, and this obliges him to take more pains than the\r\nwomen to make himself fascinating. As a rule the wives of savages\r\nattach less importance to their personal appearance than to that of\r\ntheir husbands, and the vanity of the latter is guided chiefly by the\r\ntaste of their wives. The objects with which savages adorn themselves\r\nare generally trophies.\r\n\r\nAmong civilized people, on the contrary, the men have a much wider\r\nchoice and many women remain celibate. This is one of the reasons\r\nwhich compel women to study their personal appearance and the art of\r\nflirtation. In Europe, earrings represent the last vestige of the\r\nsavage methods of adornment.\r\n\r\n=Sentiment of Shame of the Genital Organs. Nudity.=--What is the\r\norigin of the fact that man is ashamed of his genital organs? Nothing\r\nof the kind occurs in animals. The psychologist, Wundt, maintains that\r\nman has always had a sexual sentiment of modesty. This is not correct,\r\nfor many races present no trace of it, and sometimes cover all parts\r\nof their body except the genital organs. In some, the men, and in\r\nothers the women go absolutely naked. Originally, clothes were only\r\nworn for adornment or for protection against the cold. The Massais\r\nwould be ashamed to hide their penis, and it is their custom to\r\nexhibit it. Other savages cover the glans penis only with a small cap;\r\nthey retire to pass water, but regard themselves as fully dressed so\r\nlong as the glans penis is covered. The girdles and other garments of\r\nsavage women are intended for ornament, and as a means of attraction;\r\nthey have nothing to do with modesty. In a society where every one\r\ngoes naked, nudity seems quite natural, and provokes neither shame nor\r\neroticism. The custom of adorning the sexual organs then serves as a\r\nmeans of attraction, both in men and women. The short transparent\r\nskirts of a ballet dancer are in reality much more immodest than the\r\nnudity of the female savages. A great naturalist has said that veiled\r\nforms provoke the sexual appetite more than nudity. Snow remarks that\r\nassociation with naked savages excites much less sensuality than the\r\nsociety of fashionably dressed women in our salons. Read also remarks\r\n\"Nothing is more moral or less calculated to excite the passions than\r\nnudity.\" It is needless to say that this statement is only correct\r\nwhen nudity is a matter of custom, for in sexual matters it is always\r\nnovelty which attracts. Pious persons have tried to make savages\r\nmodest by clothing them, but have only produced the contrary effect.\r\nSavage women regard it as shameful to cover their sexual organs. The\r\nnaturalist, Wallace, found in one tribe a young girl who possessed a\r\ndress, but who was quite as much ashamed of clothing herself with it\r\nas one of our ladies would be of undressing before strangers.\r\n\r\nIt is only owing to the custom of wearing clothes that nudity provokes\r\nthe sexual appetite. This custom develops artificially a sentiment of\r\nmodesty with regard to nudity, which increases progressively in\r\nintensity and is especially marked in aged women. It is not so much\r\nhabit, as to the feeling of progressive deterioration of their charms,\r\nwhich leads the latter to cover themselves as they grow older, and is\r\npart of the instinctive æsthetic sentiment of woman.\r\n\r\nAt the orgies and fêtes held among savages the women cover their\r\nsexual organs with certain objects, as a means to excite the men.\r\nComplete nudity is found more often in savage women than in the men.\r\n\r\nLater on when it became the custom to wear clothes, nudity became\r\nattractive and was considered shameful. This is why the Chinese feel\r\nshame at exposing their feet, the Mahometans their faces, and some\r\nsavages even the ends of their fingers.\r\n\r\nCertain customs, like circumcision among the Jews, Polynesians and\r\nAustralians; the artificial elongation of the lips of the vulva in\r\nHottentots, Malays, and North American Indians, originated, according\r\nto Westermark, in the intention of exciting the sexual appetite, or of\r\nintroducing variety into its satisfaction. Later on routine, which\r\nsanctions everything, transferred these customs into religious cult.\r\nIt is possible, however, that among the Jews, who are a practical\r\nrace, the hygienic advantage of circumcision took a part in its\r\ntransformation into a rite.\r\n\r\nTo resume, everything derogatory to established custom excites the\r\nsentiment of shame or modesty, not only in sexual matters but in\r\nothers. Most children are ashamed of not behaving exactly as their\r\ncomrades or their brothers and sisters, and are very uncomfortable if\r\nthey are obliged to behave otherwise. All sentiments of morality and\r\nmodesty rest on conventionalities. The savage women burst into\r\nlaughter when the naked companions of Livingstone turned their backs\r\nfrom modesty. The sentiment of modesty or shame thus depends only on\r\nexceptional violation of an old custom. This is why unconventional\r\nways in one of the sexes (especially in woman) tend to offend the\r\nsentiments of modesty, and usually excite the sexual appetite of the\r\nother sex.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERTY OF CHOICE IN MARRIAGE--PATRIARCHISM\r\n\r\nAmong savages, the women sometimes have the right of giving their hand\r\nin marriage, sometimes not. The latter case is not surprising in\r\ncountries where women are considered as merchandise. Among the\r\nEsquimaux every girl is betrothed from birth. Among the Boschimans,\r\nAshantis, etc., the unborn girl is even betrothed while she is in her\r\nmother's womb! These betrothals are generally arranged by the maternal\r\nparents together with the mother.\r\n\r\nVery often, however, the consent of the woman is required; or, the\r\nmarriage may be only valid after the birth of the first child on\r\ncondition of the woman's consent.\r\n\r\nAmong the American Indians, if the woman is not a consenting party she\r\nelopes with her lover and thus escapes the would-be-husband. In this\r\nway elopement has gradually become a recognized institution among\r\ncertain races. I was told by a Bulgarian that the peasants in his\r\ncountry buy their wives from the father, generally for two or three\r\nhundred francs, but if the father demands too much, the women are\r\nraped. After this marriage becomes indispensable and the father\r\nreceives nothing, for, in Bulgaria, which is not yet spoiled by\r\ncivilization, unions apart from marriage are considered as a terrible\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\nIn certain races, the woman has a free choice among several men and\r\nher wish becomes law, so that the parents have no voice in the matter;\r\nthis occurs among the natives of the Celebes. The bridegroom is\r\nnevertheless obliged to pay the dowry demanded. Similar customs\r\nprevail among other races.\r\n\r\nWestermark comes to the conclusion that in the primitive state of\r\nhumanity the women had a much freer choice than afterward. Marriage by\r\npurchase developed later and constituted an intermediate stage. When\r\nthe first civilizations became more complicated and recognized the\r\nvalue of woman's labor, the fathers began to sell their daughters, as\r\nwe now see savage tribes abandon their women to prostitution with the\r\nwhite man. But in primitive times, when there was neither\r\ncivilization, money, nor labor, properly so-called, each individual\r\nfought for his life and the father had no more possibility of selling\r\nhis daughter as a slave than a gorilla or an orang-utan would have\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nMarriage by rape, which occurred after wars when the women were\r\nabducted and married against their will, must not be confounded with\r\nmarriage by elopement which takes place with the woman's consent, and\r\nof which the latest fashion is elopement by automobile.\r\n\r\nAmong savages, the boys are also most often the property of the\r\nfather, who has the right to sell them and even to put them to death.\r\nBut they become free at the age of puberty and then have the right to\r\nmarry according to their inclination without being forced by their\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nThere existed and still exist many patriarchal races (certain Indians\r\nand Asiatics, for example) among whom the father possesses unlimited\r\npower. The older he is the more he is honored, and the more his power\r\nis uncontested. All the children and grandchildren, with their wives\r\nand children, eat at his table; none of his descendants can marry\r\nwithout his consent, etc. The effects of patriarchism are deplorable\r\nand very immoral. The patriarch abuses his power--gives his old wives\r\nto his children and takes the young ones, for example. The purest and\r\nmost virtuous Japanese girl is obliged to go to a brothel if her\r\nfather orders it. The patriarch has the power of life and death over\r\nboth sexes, and from this is derived the cult of ancestors. At the\r\npresent day we see immorality of this kind in the Russian patriarchism\r\namong the peasants; the fathers have the custom of misusing their\r\nsons' wives. Patriarchism thus degenerates into atrocious tyranny on\r\nthe part of the chief of the family, who becomes looked upon as a\r\ngod.\r\n\r\nA law which is common in the Latin races, which forbids marriage\r\nbefore the age of thirty, without the consent of the father, is a\r\nvestige of patriarchism.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that quite primitive savage races approached our\r\nmost modern ideas in liberty of choice in marriage. Between these two\r\nperiods humanity was under the yoke of a barbarous error--the\r\nintermediate stage of marriage by purchase and patriarchal autocracy.\r\nThere has existed and still exists more than one aberration of this\r\nkind in the intermediate stages of civilization; for instance,\r\ntorture, slavery and the use of narcotic substances, such as alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEXUAL SELECTION\r\n\r\nBy sexual selection we mean union by choice among males and females.\r\nIn the vertebrates, the female chooses much more commonly than the\r\nmale, the latter being more disposed to pair with all the females than\r\nthe females with all the males. We may certainly admit that this was\r\nalso the case in primitive man, especially when there existed a\r\nrutting period, for then the sexual appetite was more violent.\r\nMoreover, even at the present day, women are on the average more\r\ndifficult to please and more strict in their choice than men.\r\n\r\nIn the case of hybrids it is generally the male which violates the law\r\nof instinct. Female slaves often flee from their free husbands, but we\r\nnever see male slaves abandon their free wives. Among savage races the\r\nwoman is always more difficult to please than the man. Among\r\nhalf-breeds, it is nearly always the father who belongs to a higher\r\nrace. The inverse rarely occurs; it is exceptional for a white woman\r\nto marry a negro. The same thing is reproduced among ourselves; we\r\noften see a cultured man marry an uneducated woman, but a cultured\r\nwoman seldom marries a laborer.\r\n\r\nIt is especially among savages that the woman prefers the man who is\r\nstrongest, most skillful, most ardent, and most audacious. Heroes\r\nalways haunt the minds of women, who love to throw themselves at the\r\nhead of conquerors. The ideal of certain women in Borneo is a husband\r\nwho has killed many enemies and possesses their heads (head-hunters of\r\nBorneo). This psychological trait responds to natural selection, for\r\nthe women obtain by this custom better protectors and stronger\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, man looks instinctively for a young, healthy and\r\nwell-developed woman. It is on this basis that Greek art formed Eros\r\nand Aphrodite, designating the latter as goddess of both love and\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n=Conception of Beauty.=--The conception of beauty is very relative.\r\nThe Australians laugh at our long noses and the natives of\r\nCochin-China at our white teeth and red cheeks. Certain savage women\r\nbind their legs below the knees to make them swell, this effect being\r\npart of their idea of beauty. The Chinese admire the deformed feet of\r\ntheir women and their prominent cheek bones. In each nation the\r\nconception of beauty generally corresponds to the ideal type of the\r\nrace, for both sexes. As a general rule muscle is admired in man and\r\nfullness of figure in woman. The Hottentots like women's breasts to be\r\nso pendulous that they can throw them over shoulder, and suckle the\r\ninfants carried on their backs; they also admire the elongated lips of\r\nthe vulva.\r\n\r\nThere are, therefore, few general typical characters of sexual\r\npreference; these are especially the ideal type of the race and the\r\nhealth of both sexes, voluptuous forms and grace in women, muscular\r\nstrength and dexterity in men. Everything else is relative and\r\nvariable, and depends on the local point of view, customs, race,\r\nindividual taste, etc.\r\n\r\nThus, according to the conception of æsthetics, tattooing, the\r\narrangement of the hair and beard, deformations of the nose, cranium,\r\nor feet, are admired by different peoples. Each race extols its own\r\npeculiarities; the European compares a woman's breasts to snow, the\r\nMalay to gold, etc. The natives of Coromandel paint their gods black\r\nand their devils white, while in Europe it is the reverse.\r\n\r\nThe association of love with beauty is not based on æsthetic\r\nsentiments, for the latter are disinterested, while the original\r\ninstinct of love is interested. The association of the two things\r\ndepends on the instinctive necessity of health, combined with the\r\nsexual appetite, although custom has produced numerous aberrations.\r\nEverything which differs markedly from the type of the race is more\r\nor less pathological. This is why instinct, determined by natural\r\nselection, repels it.\r\n\r\nFashion also rules among savages, but is less changeable among them\r\nthan with us, and their taste for adornment only varies in the narrow\r\ncircle of their customs.\r\n\r\nClimate has a powerful action on the types of races, the latter being\r\ngenerally adapted to the climate in which they live. Thus, the\r\nEuropean becomes darker in the tropics while negroes and Indians\r\nbecome paler in the north.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWS OF RESEMBLANCE--HYBRIDS\r\n\r\nEvery animal species has an instinctive repugnance to pair with\r\nanother. Even where they are possible, natural hybrids are rare, and\r\nonly become a little more frequent in domestic animals and plants. The\r\nfecundity of hybrids diminishes when they have connection among\r\nthemselves, and this explains why the instinct for such connections\r\ntends to gradually disappear.\r\n\r\nIn his book on \"The Mneme,\" Semon explains the infecundity of hybrids\r\nin a very plausible manner, by the disorder that a too large quantity\r\nof dissimilar hereditary engrams causes in the hereditary mneme of two\r\nconjugated cells. When the parents differ from each other only in a\r\nmoderate degree homophony may still be reëstablished, and then the\r\ndivergencies have a very favorable effect on the product, by the new\r\ncombinations which they furnish in the course of its development.\r\n\r\nMoral ideas follow the course of instincts, and this explains why\r\nsexual connection with animals is regarded as a horrible crime. This\r\nis especially produced by pathological aberration, or when one sex is\r\ncompletely isolated from the other. There is also a certain degree of\r\naversion to copulation between different races, in animals as well as\r\nman; for example, between sheep and horses of different races, and\r\nbetween white men, negroes and Indians. There are, however, many\r\nhybrids or half-breeds in South America, and in Mexico they even\r\nconstitute two-thirds of the population.\r\n\r\nBroca maintained that human hybrids produced by the crossing of remote\r\nraces, for example, between English and negroes or Australians, were\r\nusually sterile. Westermark disputes this, but agrees that these\r\nhybrids become enfeebled in a few generations. It has also been\r\nestablished that mixed marriage between Jews and Aryans are generally\r\nless fecund; but this fact is not yet sufficiently explained.\r\nMulattoes, or hybrids between negroes and whites, constitute a\r\ndegenerate race and hardly viable, at any rate if their descendants do\r\nnot return entirely to one of the original races. Half-breeds between\r\nwhites and American Indians, also called Ladinos, seem on the contrary\r\nto form a viable race, but one of little valor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROHIBITION OF CONSANGUINEOUS MARRIAGES\r\n\r\nSexual union between near relations nearly always causes a feeling of\r\nrepugnance in man, and has been stigmatized by the term _incest_.\r\nCoitus between mother and son especially excites disgust. Sexual\r\nconnection between parents and children, as well as between brothers\r\nand sisters is, however, common among certain tribes. Many other races\r\nallow marriage between brothers and sisters, but this is elsewhere\r\ngenerally condemned.\r\n\r\nAmong the Weddas, marriage between an elder brother and his younger\r\nsister is considered normal, while that between a younger brother and\r\nhis elder sister, or between a nephew and his aunt, is regarded as\r\nunnatural. The latter simply shows that unions between young men and\r\nold women are not natural. Unions between brothers and sisters, and\r\nespecially between half-brothers and half-sisters were licit among the\r\nPersians, Egyptians, Syrians, Athenians and ancient Jews. Those\r\nbetween uncles and nieces (more rarely between aunts and nephews) are\r\nsometimes permitted, sometimes prohibited. With the exception of Spain\r\nand Russia marriages between first cousins are allowed in Europe.\r\n\r\n=Exogamy and Endogamy.=--Among many savages the prohibition of\r\nconsanguineous marriage may be extended to relationship of the third\r\ndegree. Marriage may even be prohibited among all members of the same\r\ntribe or clan, even when they are not related. This is called\r\n_exogamous_ marriage, and reaches its extreme development among the\r\nAustralians, who are only allowed to marry into remote clans.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the great majority of savages extend their idea of\r\nincest much further than we do. The reason of this has been much\r\ndiscussed. It was formerly said that consanguineous marriage was\r\ncontrary to the commandments of God; that it offended the natural\r\nsentiment of modesty; that it obscures relationship, etc. Nowadays, it\r\nis said to be injurious to posterity. Ethnography teaches us, however,\r\nthat these statements are of little value.\r\n\r\nAlong with the exogamy of many tribes there is among other savages a\r\nsystem of _endogamy_, described by MacLennan; this is the prohibition\r\nof marriage between different clans. Spencer and MacLennan have\r\ndifferent explanations of this custom which seem hardly natural.\r\nWestermark appears to be nearer the truth in remarking as follows: The\r\nsexual appetite, especially in man, is excited by new impressions and\r\ncooled by habit. It is not the fact of a man and woman being related,\r\nbut intimate companionship since youth, which produces in them a\r\nrepugnance to sexual union. We find the same repugnance between\r\nadopted brothers and sisters and between friends who have been\r\nintimate since childhood. When, on the contrary, brothers and sisters\r\nor near relatives have been separated from each other since an early\r\nage, they often fall in love with each other when they meet later on.\r\nThere is, therefore, no innate or instinctive repugnance to incest in\r\nitself, but only against sexual union between individuals who have\r\nlived together since childhood. As it is parents and their children\r\nwho are usually in this situation, everything is explained simply and\r\nclearly.\r\n\r\nThe causes of exogamy are explained in the same way, by the fact that\r\nmembers of the same clan often live together in close intimacy. It is\r\nthe small clans, formed of thirty or fifty individuals of a few\r\nfamilies living together, which have the most severe laws against\r\nincest or endogamy. Where the families live in separate homes, such\r\nprohibitions do not exist. The Maoris, who are endogamous, inhabit\r\nvillages which are widely separated, and marriage between relations is\r\nallowed. Endogamy generally exists where the clan life is little\r\ndeveloped, and where relatives know and see little of each other. The\r\naversion to marriage between persons living together has thus created\r\nprohibition of marriage between relations as well as that of marriage\r\nbetween members of the same clan. It is the same reason which has led\r\nto the prohibition of marriage between brothers-and sisters-in-law,\r\nbetween brothers and adopted sisters, etc. In people living in small\r\ncommunities, endogamy does not appear to have ever existed.\r\n\r\nIncest between relatives living together appears to have everywhere\r\nthe same natural cause--the scarcity of women in isolated families\r\nliving in remote districts. There is also a psycho-pathological form\r\nof incest associated with morbid appetites in the families of\r\ndegenerates. In animals living alone and whose families break up very\r\nrapidly (cats for example) incestuous unions, between parents and\r\nyoung, for instance, are quite common.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the scientific side of the question. We see\r\neverywhere that sexual union between quite distinct animal species\r\ngives no result. At the most, certain closely allied species, such as\r\nthe ass and the horse, the rabbit and the hare, give progeny which are\r\nthemselves sterile (mules, etc.). The feebleness and sterility of\r\nhybrids derived from widely separated races or nearly allied different\r\nspecies proves the deficiency in vital force of the offspring of\r\nfundamentally dissimilar procreators. But, on the other hand, the\r\ndangers of continuous consanguineous reproduction are no less evident.\r\nPerpetual unions between brothers and sisters for several generations,\r\nlead to degeneration of the race. For example, the still-births will\r\nbe 25 per cent. instead of 8 per cent., which is the figure in\r\nordinary crossings. The prejudice against consanguineous unions may,\r\nhowever, depend on the accumulation of certain pathological defects.\r\n\r\nWestermark admits that it is difficult to show clearly that\r\nconsanguineous marriages are prejudicial in man. The consanguinity\r\nwhich causes evil effects in animals concerns long-continued unions\r\nbetween parents and children or brothers and sisters. But this never\r\noccurs in man. Animals and plants may be perpetuated for many years in\r\nthe closest consanguinity without degeneration resulting. Among the\r\nPersians and Egyptians, intimate unions have existed for a long time\r\nwithout producing degeneration.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, breeders of animals tell us that a single drop of\r\nnew blood (or rather sperm) is enough to counteract all the evil\r\neffects of consanguinity. In man the most frequent incests are always\r\ninterrupted by some other union. The Ptolemies, who nearly always\r\nmarried their sisters, nieces or cousins, lived long and were far from\r\nbeing sterile. In Ceylon, the Weddas perpetuate their consanguineous\r\nunions; insanity is rare among them, but they are small, unfruitful\r\nand tend to become extinct.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the question of marriages between first cousins has been\r\nmuch discussed, and it has been constantly attempted to prove that\r\nthey are injurious. Nevertheless, when we examine the question\r\nimpartially, we always find that the prejudices against them do not\r\narrive from consanguinity, but from certain pathological defects, such\r\nas insanity, hemophilia, etc., which are naturally perpetuated by\r\nconsanguineous unions when they are accumulated in one family, as well\r\nas when two insane persons of different families marry. Therefore it\r\nis not consanguineous unions in themselves (which are always\r\naccidental in man and interrupted by others) but the hereditary\r\nreproduction of pathological defects, often of blastophthoric origin,\r\nwhich are the real cause of the evil. Statistics have clearly proved\r\nthat marriage between first cousins plays no part in the causes of\r\ninsanity.\r\n\r\nInfluenced, no doubt, by general opinion, Westermark tries to believe\r\nin some instinctive repulsion of man for consanguineous unions. If in\r\nmodern society such unions, perpetuated between parents and children,\r\nbrothers and sisters, were still produced as in animals I should agree\r\nthat they might be injurious to the species; but, considering how\r\ncosmopolitan and mixed is our modern society, I cannot make the\r\nconcession. On the contrary, I maintain that the isolated unions which\r\nstill take place between relatives in civilized countries are so\r\nexceptional that they do not present the least danger, excepting among\r\nthe families of degenerates. It is therefore only a question of\r\nsuperstition. What we have to guard against are unions between\r\npathological individuals and blastophthoric influences. We must not\r\nforget that many degenerates and idiots have a great pathological\r\ntendency to incest, and this is no doubt why the effect has been\r\nconfounded with the cause.\r\n\r\nWestermark himself gives us a striking example. Since the most remote\r\ntimes the inhabitants of the Commune of Bats, composed of 3,300\r\npersons, have intermarried; yet this population is very healthy and\r\nvigorous and shows no sign of degeneration. On the other hand, we have\r\nseen that contrasts produce a mutual attraction in the domain of love,\r\nwhile strong resemblances rather repel. Bernardin de St. Pierre has\r\nsaid that love is created by contrasts; the greater the contrast the\r\ngreater the love. Schopenhauer remarks as follows: \"Every individual\r\nseeks in the opposite sex peculiarities which contrast with his own;\r\nthe most masculine man seeks the most feminine woman, while small and\r\nfeeble men love large and strong women; people with short noses prefer\r\nlong ones, tall and thin men prefer short and stout women. All this\r\nincreases fecundity.\" Thus instinct is sufficient to protect humanity\r\nagainst consanguinity, each sex instinctively seeking the contrasts\r\nwhich consanguinity diminishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSENTIMENT AND CALCULATION IN SEXUAL SELECTION\r\n\r\nYouth, beauty, health, finery and flirtation excite the sexual\r\nappetite. Many other sentiments are accessory, such as admiration, the\r\npleasure of possession, respect, pity, etc. Inclination is an\r\nimportant element, but in no way necessary to sexual union.\r\n\r\nIn the lower stages of human development, tenderness toward children\r\nis much stronger than sexual love. Among many savage races the love of\r\na man for his wife is completely wanting, as well as that of the wife\r\nfor her husband. In this case marriage depends on reciprocal\r\nconvenience, on the desire to have children, and profits by personal\r\ncomfort and the satisfaction of a purely animal sexual appetite.\r\nHowever, among these people the parents have a tender regard for their\r\nchildren. The husband has the right to beat his wife, but the wife is\r\nconsidered as unnatural or even criminal if she beats her children.\r\nAmong the North American Indians, for example, conjugal love is, so to\r\nspeak, unknown. On the other hand, in other savage races, such as the\r\nTouaregs, the Niam-Niams, the New Caledonians, the Tonganese and\r\nAustralians, the conjoints have a deep affection for each other, and\r\nthe husband often commits suicide on the death of his wife. On the\r\nwhole, the sentiments of affection of the conjoints are the result of\r\na long sexual life in common, and they are especially strengthened by\r\nthe love of the parents for their children.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the mutual attachment of conjoints for each other among\r\ncultivated races is developed along with altruism. The tenderness and\r\nrefinement of love as they exist at the present day among highly\r\ncivilized races were unknown to most savages and to the older\r\ncivilizations. In China it is considered good manners to beat the\r\nwife, and when a poor Chinaman treats his wife with consideration, it\r\nis to avoid having to buy another. What the Arab understands by love\r\nis only sexual appetite, and among the ancient Greeks it was nearly\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nIn civilized Europe mental culture progresses in the direction of\r\nequality of rights between the two sexes, so that a man regards his\r\nwife more as a companion who is his equal and no longer a slave.\r\nCommunity of interests, opinions, sentiments and culture constitute a\r\nprimary condition for sentiments of mutual sympathy and favors\r\naffection. No doubt, excitation of the sexual appetite by contrasts\r\nacts here as an antagonistic force. Contrast should not be so great as\r\nto exclude sympathy.\r\n\r\nToo great difference in age is dangerous for attachment, for it causes\r\ntoo great a divergence in the aims and interests of life. Education\r\nand social equality also favors love, and this tends to preserve class\r\ndistinction. It is rare for a well-educated man to fall in love with a\r\npeasant, or a laboring man with an educated woman, except in a sensual\r\nway. Men generally avoid marriage with individuals of another race, or\r\nof another religion.\r\n\r\nEndogamy and exogamy do not form such an absolute contrast as at first\r\nsight might appear. Even among exogamous races, there is a limit which\r\nmust not be passed. These races often prohibit marriage with\r\nindividuals of another race. Among the Arabs, for example, the\r\ninstinct of ethnical separation is so strong, that the same Bedouin\r\nwife who will prostitute herself for money with Turks or Europeans,\r\nwould think it dishonorable to marry one of them. In this way custom\r\nproduces endogamy of caste and class among the same people. The same\r\nwith the nobility; in ancient Rome it was forbidden for a patrician to\r\nmarry a plebeian. Sometimes an endogamy of religious origin is met\r\nwith, among the Jews for example.\r\n\r\nChildren are treasures for the man of low culture, while they become a\r\nburden to the cultivated man. In spite of this the natural man\r\nardently desires children. In Switzerland, two-fifths of the divorces\r\noccur in sterile unions, although the latter only form one-fifth of\r\nall marriages.\r\n\r\nCalculation often smothers sentiment when it becomes the basis of\r\nmarriage. We live to-day under the sway of Mammon, with the result\r\nthat the influence of love, strength, beauty, capacity for work,\r\nintelligence, skill, character and even health, count for little\r\ncompared with money in the question of marriage. This sad sign is\r\nreally a new form of marriage by purchase, hypocritically disguised.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE BY RAPE AND MARRIAGE BY PURCHASE\r\n\r\nThe rape of women is an established custom in some regions. Certain\r\nmarriage ceremonies prove that rape was formerly much more common than\r\nat the present day. Among certain Indian tribes the simulation of rape\r\nand abduction of the woman form part of the marriage ceremonies;\r\ncustom requiring that the woman must feign to resist.\r\n\r\nAccording to Spencer, marriage by rape originated in the prudery of\r\nwoman, while MacLennan attributes it to the predominance of exogamy;\r\nbut, in reality, marriage by rape exists in races which are absolutely\r\nendogamous. Westermark believes it arose from the repugnance to unions\r\ncontracted in a narrow circle. The savage has difficulty in procuring\r\na wife without giving the father compensation; besides, his own\r\nrepugnance to the companions of his childhood and the prejudices\r\nagainst unions between relations, as well as the enmity of other\r\nclans, all increase the difficulties to be overcome. This is why he\r\noften decides on rape. Marriage by rape has not, however, been the\r\nrule at any period, and on the whole, unions concluded by mutual\r\nagreement have always predominated.\r\n\r\nMarriage by purchase has followed marriage by rape, and forms a\r\nslightly higher stage of civilization, developed by exchange of money\r\nor other symbols. It first appears, in Australia, for example, as\r\nmarriage by exchange (exchange of a woman for a sister or a daughter).\r\nAfterward young men gain their wives by working as servants for the\r\nfather. In marriage by purchase the price is based on the beauty,\r\nhealth and social position of the woman. A young girl is generally\r\nworth more than a widow or a rejected woman. Skill in female manual\r\nlabor also increases the price. Among the Indians of British Columbia\r\na wife will cost from twenty to forty pounds sterling, while in Oregon\r\nthey are exchanged for bisons' skins or blankets. Among the Kaffirs\r\nfrom three to ten cows is a low price, twenty to thirty a high price\r\nfor a wife. When a wife was given gratis, her parents had a right to\r\nthe children. Marriage by purchase and by exchange still exists among\r\nthe lower races as it formerly ruled among civilized peoples. We still\r\npossess the rudiments.\r\n\r\nMarriage by rape or by purchase has, however, never been in general\r\nusage. Certain races in India and Africa considered it a disgrace to\r\npay a price for a wife.\r\n\r\nFrom the historical point of view it is interesting to note that, in\r\nthe ceremonies of marriage by purchase, a simulated and symbolical\r\nrape of the betrothed still recalls the old form of marriage by rape;\r\nalso, in races where a higher form has replaced marriage by purchase,\r\ntraces of the latter are still preserved in certain nuptial symbols.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECADENCE OF MARRIAGE BY PURCHASE--THE DOT\r\n\r\nThe position of woman has undergone steady improvement in higher\r\ncivilization by the progress of altruism. This is why culture, in\r\nIndia, China, Greece, Rome and Germany, etc., has gradually\r\ndiscredited marriage by purchase. This was at first replaced by the\r\ncustom of giving wedding presents to the bride; afterward the opposite\r\ncustom was introduced of the bride bringing her _dot_ to the\r\nbridegroom.\r\n\r\nA singular transition between these two systems is constituted by\r\nsimulated purchase, in which the bridegroom offers presents to the\r\nbride's parents, which are afterward returned to him. Among certain\r\nsavages the bride's parents return the purchase money of their\r\ndaughter to the bridegroom in another form. Such restitution was often\r\nthe origin of the _dot_.\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans the _dot_ became the property of the husband, and\r\nfrom this is derived the modern custom which usually gives the husband\r\nthe right to administer his wife's _dot_, which remains the property\r\nof the wife and her family.\r\n\r\nAmong the Mexicans, where divorce for conjugal discord is frequent,\r\nand among certain Mahometans, division of property exists in marriage,\r\nand the wife's property is returned to her when she is separated or\r\ndivorced.\r\n\r\nIn Europe at the present time, especially under the influence of\r\nFrench customs, there is established a kind of marriage by inverse\r\npurchase (which already existed among the Greeks), in the sense that\r\nthe parents of young girls obtain husbands for them by means of a\r\nlarge _dot_. Westermark concludes this subject with the following\r\nwords: \"If she does not possess special personal attractions, a young\r\ngirl without a _dot_, at the present day, runs a great chance of not\r\ngetting married. This state of things is quite naturally developed in\r\na society where monogamy is legally enforced; where women are more\r\nnumerous than men; where many men never marry, and where married women\r\ntoo often lead a life of idleness.\" If we add to this: \"in a society\r\nwhere Mammon rules as absolute master,\" the picture will not be\r\nwanting in accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUPTIAL CUSTOMS AND CEREMONIES\r\n\r\nIn primitive races where the wife is simply bought like merchandise,\r\noften after mutual agreement, nuptial ceremonies do not exist. They\r\ngenerally originate later from the symbols of a form of marriage since\r\nabandoned. The ceremony being concluded and the marriage recognized as\r\nlegal, it is followed by feasting. Certain religious ceremonies are\r\ngenerally combined with marriage. The customs of our modern marriages\r\narise from the same source. At the time of early Christianity there\r\nwere no religious ceremonies and even up till the year 1563, the date\r\nof the end of the Council of Trent, religious benediction of marriage\r\nwas not obligatory. Luther held that marriage should be purely civil,\r\nbut legal civil marriage was only introduced among us by the French\r\nRevolution, while it had existed in remote times among the Peruvians,\r\nNicaraguans and others. Among certain races, marriages concluded\r\nwithout _dot_, without ceremony, or without purchase, and even those\r\nbetween different castes, are often regarded as concubinage.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMS OF MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nLeaving aside hermaphrodites, such as the snails, in which each\r\nindividual has both kinds of sexual organs and plays the part of both\r\nmale and female, there are among animals with separate sexes five\r\nforms of conjugal union:\r\n\r\n(1). _Temporary or perpetual monogamy_, or marriage between one\r\nindividual of one sex and one of the other sex. This is the case with\r\nmost birds and mammals and many races of man.\r\n\r\n(2). _Polygymy or polygamy_, or the marriage of one male with several\r\nfemales. This occurs in ruminants, stags, fowls, and other animals, as\r\nwell as in some human beings; for example, the Islamites, negroes,\r\nAmerican Indians, Mormons, etc.\r\n\r\n(3). _Polyandry_, or the marriage of one female with several males.\r\nThis is met with chiefly in the ants, in which each female is\r\ngenerally fecundated successively by several males. In most of the\r\nhigher animals, the jealousy of the males renders polyandry\r\nimpossible. In man it is rare but exists among certain races.\r\n\r\n(4). _Marriage in groups_, or marriage between several males and\r\nseveral females. This singular custom is rare but exists in the Togas,\r\na tribe of savages. I am not aware of its existence among animals.\r\n\r\n(5). _Promiscuity_, or free sexual intercourse between males and\r\nfemales. This occurs in many animals, especially in the lower animals\r\nin which the sexual instinct of the male is not associated with any\r\nregard for the female or the progeny. Promiscuity is still more\r\nnatural when the female does not look after her young after she has\r\nlaid her eggs. Nevertheless, in most animals the female limits herself\r\nto sexual intercourse before each brood, so that real promiscuity is\r\nnot so frequent as would at first appear. In man, on the contrary, it\r\nattains its apogee in prostitution, which is the only absolutely\r\ncomplete form of promiscuity. But the result of prostitution as\r\nregards the preservation of the species, which is the proper object of\r\nall sexual union, is absolutely destructive.\r\n\r\nPolygamy or polygymy were licit among most ancient races, and is so\r\nstill among most savages and among many civilized nations; but it has\r\nseveral varieties.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico, Peru, Japan and China a man only possesses one legitimate\r\nwife, but has several concubines whose children are considered as\r\nlegitimate as those of his wife. Polygamy existed legally among the\r\nJews up to the Middle Ages. King Solomon possessed seven hundred wives\r\nand three hundred concubines. In Islamite countries the Jews are still\r\npolygamous. The Koran allows them four wives and as many concubines as\r\nthey please. The latter do not enjoy the protection of their father,\r\nbut apart from this they have the same rights as the legitimate wives.\r\nThe Hindus and Persians are polygamous. The Romans were strictly\r\nmonogamous, but they also had concubines.\r\n\r\nIn Christian Europe, polygamy has occasionally been allowed or\r\ntolerated: St. Augustus did not condemn it. Luther allowed Philip of\r\nHesse to marry two wives; and after the treaty of Westphalia bigamy\r\nwas allowed because of the depopulation of Germany. The mistresses of\r\nthe present princes are a relic of polygamy. Jesus having said nothing\r\nconcerning polygamy, Luther did not prohibit it.\r\n\r\nThe Mormons have introduced it into their religion. The negro king of\r\nLoango shows us what degree polygamy may reach among princes and\r\nchiefs, for he possesses seven thousand wives, while the chiefs of the\r\nFiji Islands are content with twenty to one hundred.\r\n\r\nAmong savage races we find monogamy in the natives of the Andaman\r\nislands, among the Touaregs, the Weddas, the Iroquois, the Wyandottes,\r\nand even in some Australian tribes. With others, polygamy is only\r\npermitted to the chiefs. But most of the population are monogamous\r\neven among polygamous races, and there are very few peoples in which\r\nall the men possess several wives. In India, 95 per cent. of the\r\nIslamites are monogamous, and in Persia even 98 per cent. Polygamy is\r\nnearly everywhere a privilege of princes, chiefs, and rich men.\r\n\r\nThe two following facts also show a tendency to monogamy among\r\npolygamous races:\r\n\r\n(1). One of the wives, generally the first, has prerogatives over the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n(2). In reality, the polygamous man nearly always gives sexual\r\npreference to one only, or to a few of his wives. There are, however,\r\nsome polygamous races in which the husband has sexual intercourse with\r\neach of his wives according to a regular programme, taking each of\r\nthem in turn for several days, weeks or months. With others, on the\r\ncontrary, a number of married women remain in reality virgins, because\r\nthe husband does not desire them, and they are nothing more than\r\ndomestics. Among these people the husband as a rule only takes a\r\nsecond wife when the first has grown old, so that bigamy becomes the\r\nordinary form of marriage.\r\n\r\nThe Cingalese were polyandrous before the English conquest, and so\r\nmany as seven men had one wife in common. Polyandry is especially the\r\ncustom in Thibet. Among polyandrous peoples the husbands are not all\r\non the same footing of equality, some hold an inferior position,\r\ncorresponding nearly to that of concubines, another sign of the\r\ntendency to monogamy.\r\n\r\nAmong the Togas marriage in groups is constituted as follows: All the\r\nbrothers are husbands of the wife of the elder brother, and all the\r\nsisters of this wife are at the same time wives of their\r\nbrothers-in-law. If we except prostitution, this is the only case in\r\nman which approaches promiscuity. Marriage in groups, however, is\r\nextremely restricted promiscuity.\r\n\r\nTo resume, monogamy is by far the most widespread form of marriage.\r\nThis is explained by the relative number of men to women. It has often\r\nbeen stated that the number of individuals of the two sexes is nearly\r\nthe same, and this has been used as an argument in favor of monogamy.\r\nBut this statement is incorrect; sometimes it is the men, but more\r\noften the women, who predominate. Among the natives of Oregon there\r\nare seven hundred men to eleven hundred and eighty-five women. Among\r\nthe Punkas and other races the number of women is two or three times\r\ngreater than that of the men. In Kotcha-Hamba there is only one man to\r\nfive women. Among other races there are, on the contrary, more men\r\nthan women, especially in Australia, Tasmania, and Hayti. In the\r\nlatter island there is only one woman to five men. In Cashmere there\r\nare three men to one woman. Among the negroes, on the contrary, the\r\nwomen predominate, sometimes in the proportion of three to one, but\r\nmore generally as three to two.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, more boys than girls are born on the average, but from the\r\nage of fifteen to twenty the numbers become equal, and after twenty\r\nthe women predominate. This is due to the greater mortality among men,\r\nowing to war, the greater danger of masculine occupations, and also to\r\nalcoholism. In the fifteen largest towns in Switzerland alcoholism is\r\nthe direct or indirect cause of death in 10.5 per cent. of men above\r\nthe age of twenty.\r\n\r\nAmong savages the women often take part in war, for instance the\r\nAmazons of Dahomey. Drinking habits are also the same or absent in\r\nboth sexes, which equalizes matters. When the men predominate in these\r\npeople, this is often due to infanticide committed on young girls, and\r\nalso to overwork of the women. With the Cingalese the natality of boys\r\nis greater than that of girls, while in Asia Minor two girls, in\r\nArabia even four girls, are born to one boy. The Arab says, \"Allah has\r\ngiven us more women than men; it is, therefore, clear that polygamy is\r\na divine commandment.\"\r\n\r\n=Production of Sexes at Will.=--I will say a few words on the question\r\nof the causes of production of the sexes. There is no want of\r\nhypotheses, assertions, nor even of experiments on this subject; but,\r\nwe are obliged to admit that up to the present we know nothing\r\ncertain. No one has yet succeeded in producing experimentally in\r\nanimals males or females at will. According to one theory, which has\r\ncreated much impression, overfeeding produces females and underfeeding\r\nmales. Although this appears to be true in certain cases among some\r\nanimals, it is in no way proved in a positive manner.\r\n\r\nIt has also been suggested that selection produces the sex which is\r\ndeficient in numbers; but here again proofs are wanting. It has been\r\nmaintained that crossing tends to breed females, while consanguineous\r\nmarriages produce males; in other words, that mongrel races show an\r\nexcess of female births, while races in which marriages are very\r\nconsanguineous, and polyandrous tribes show an excess of males. It is\r\nmuch better to leave this question alone till science has furnished us\r\nwith conclusive proofs. Certain results obtained with the lower\r\nanimals give hope that the future may shed some light on this point.\r\n\r\nAgain, marriage customs are not always in relation to the excess of\r\none of the sexes. Races in which men predominate are not always\r\npolyandrous, and those in which women are in excess are not always\r\npolygamous; sometimes even the contrary exists. Polygamy is thus not\r\nalways due to a surplus of female births, or to the death of many men,\r\nbut often to religious prescripts, as among the Islamites and Mormons.\r\nIn polyandry, poverty often plays a greater part than consanguineous\r\nmarriages or surplus of male births. Religious prescription of the\r\nhusband's continence during his wife's menstrual periods, pregnancy,\r\nand even the period of nursing, a period which often lasts from two to\r\nfour years in savages, is an important cause of polyandry. At Sierra\r\nLeone, coitus of the husband with his wife before the last-born child\r\ncan walk is regarded as a crime.\r\n\r\nAlthough very advantageous to the wife's health this custom is\r\nentirely based on religious ideas and superstitions. Many savages\r\nconsider that every woman is impure and bewitched during her monthly\r\nperiods, during pregnancy and suckling. If we add to this the fact\r\nthat, being usually treated as beasts, the women soon grow old, we can\r\neasily understand that the men are inclined to polygamy. It is\r\nremarkable with what rapidity the savage woman grows old. She is only\r\nfresh from thirteen to twenty years; after twenty-five she is old and\r\nsterile, and a little later she has the aspect of an old sorceress.\r\nThis premature senility is not so much due to early sexual intercourse\r\nas to the terribly hard work they undergo, and also to the prolonged\r\nperiod of suckling.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of polygamy is man's natural desire for change. The\r\nnegroes of Angola exchange wives. The instinct of procreation, love of\r\nglory and riches coöperate with the sterility of many women in\r\npropagating polygamy. Certain races only tolerate it when the woman is\r\nsterile, or has only daughters, which clearly proves that it is based\r\non the fear of remaining without male descendants.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, savage women are less fecund than civilized, owing to\r\ntheir long continence during the two or four years nursing of each\r\nchild. If we add to this the high infant mortality, we can understand\r\nhow polygamy becomes among these people a means of reproduction in the\r\nstruggle for existence, and even in African races a natural law. A\r\nnative of Central Africa may have a hundred wives, who also act as\r\nservants and retainers. In this case polygamy is the expression of\r\npomp and wealth. It is especially developed in agricultural peoples\r\nowing to the value of the woman's labor. On the other hand it is\r\nimpossible among nomadic tribes. In Dahomey the king had thousands of\r\nwives, the nobility hundreds, the simple citizen a dozen and the\r\nsoldier none at all.\r\n\r\nJealousy and rivalry among the wives is not always the rule in\r\npolygamous families. In equatorial Africa the wives themselves incline\r\nto polygamy and regard a rich man who restricts the number of his\r\nwives as miserly. Livingstone relates that the women of Makololo\r\ndeclared they would not live in monogamous England, for any\r\nrespectable man should prove his wealth by the number of his wives. We\r\nmust not forget that among most savages the moral conception of good\r\nand evil are confounded with that of riches and poverty. In reality,\r\nthe supernumerary wives bought by a polygamist are simply slaves. His\r\npower and authority do not easily allow jealousy among them;\r\nnevertheless suicide sometimes occurs among the old wives who have\r\nbeen passed over in favor of younger ones. Sometimes they kill their\r\nchildren at the same time. Among the Indians of Terra del Fuego a hut\r\ncontaining three or four women often resembles a battlefield. We have\r\nalready pointed out the way in which jealous Fiji women cut off the\r\nnoses of their rivals. Among the Islamites and Hindus intrigue and\r\njealousy are common with the women; the same in Abyssinia, among the\r\nHovas of Madagascar and the Zulus. The Hova term for polygamy is\r\n_rafy_, which signifies adversary. To prevent the jealousy of his\r\nwives the polygamous man often places them in separate houses; this is\r\ncommon among the South American Indians.\r\n\r\nIn Colombia I made the acquaintance of a French explorer, Le Comte de\r\nBrettes, who has studied closely the Goajires Indians by becoming\r\nhimself a member of the tribe. The country of the Goajires is a\r\npeninsula of Colombia bordering on Venezuela. Polygamy among these\r\npeople is very interesting. When a young Goajire wishes to marry he\r\nhas to pay the bride's parents a number of cattle, but the consent of\r\nthe bride is necessary. Besides this the husband has to clear a\r\ncertain area of forest, plant vegetables and build a hut. He must then\r\nmake a present of all this to his wife and add to it the necessary\r\ncattle. The wife thus becomes the legal proprietor of the house and\r\nland, and it is she who rules over the domain. The husband only has\r\nauthority over the male children; but the wife is strictly enforced to\r\nbe faithful. If he wishes to marry a second wife, he is obliged to buy\r\nher also and present her with similar property as the first, in\r\nanother district. The two wives can never dwell together in the same\r\nhouse nor in the same district; each of them is thus a proprietor on\r\nher own account. In this manner the different wives of a Goajire are\r\nnot only independent, but separated from each other and have no\r\ncommunication; this excludes all jealousy, especially as these women\r\nhave a deep respect for the laws of their country. Under such\r\nconditions polygamy can hardly extend to more than two women without\r\nexhausting the forces a man requires to cultivate each of the domains.\r\nWe thus see that certain forms of polygamy, combined with\r\nmatriarchism, are compatible with high social position of the wife,\r\nfor among the Goajires and other Indian tribes the man passes from one\r\nwife to the other, while it is the wife who is mistress of the house,\r\nthe children and the domain.\r\n\r\nHowever, we may say that on the whole monogamy reigns where there is\r\nmore altruism, respect for women and sentiment for family life; for\r\ninstance, in Nicaragua, among the Dyaks, the Andamanese, etc., in whom\r\nthe wife is highly esteemed and possesses political influence. The\r\nwife is also proprietor of the house among the Santalese and\r\nMounda-Kols.\r\n\r\nIn the question we are considering the nature of the amorous passions\r\nalso plays a great part. When they are purely sensual they do not last\r\nlong as a rule; but when love arises from mental affinities it may be\r\nprolonged till old age. Bain remarks that other passions, such as\r\nmaternal love, hatred, the desire of domination may be extended to\r\nmany objects, while love has a tendency to concentrate itself on a\r\nsingle one which then takes preëminence over the others and tends to\r\nmonogamy. We have seen that birds and monkeys generally love only one\r\nfemale. With some conjugal love is so strong that one of the conjoints\r\ncannot survive the other; this fact has been observed with certainty,\r\neven when the survivor was provided with another mate. Thus, the male\r\nof a certain species of monkey (_Hapale jacchus_) after the death of\r\nhis mate, covers his eyes with his hands, ceases to eat and remains in\r\nthe same position till he dies. Suicide for love is not rare among\r\ncertain savage races; a point to which we shall return later.\r\n\r\nWestermark is certainly right in considering this tendency of love to\r\nconcentrate itself on a single object as one of the most powerful\r\nfactors in monogamy. Jealousy is no doubt the reverse of such\r\nsentiment, but is the profound despair at seeing the sole object of\r\nlove desert or become unfaithful. On the other hand, this\r\nconcentration of love, which may be excellent for isolated families\r\nliving alone after the manner of wild beasts, is in no way adapted to\r\na society of which all the members are responsible. This is a point we\r\nmust insist upon. There is certainly a real antinomy which is\r\ndifficult to reconcile between this dual egoism of exclusive and\r\nconcentrated love and social solidarity or human altruism. The problem\r\nis not insoluble, but we must admit that the solution is not easy.\r\n\r\nTo resume, we first of all observe an evolution from monogamy toward\r\npolygamy. The higher apes and the most primitive men are monogamous;\r\namong these there are no differences of rank, nor class distinctions,\r\nand they live in very small groups. Wealth, civilization, larger\r\ncommunities, agriculture and the domination of castes have gradually\r\ngiven rise to polygamy. Thus, the ancient Hindus were at first\r\nmonogamous and later on became polygamous. The prerogative of the\r\nfirst wife over the others is only a vestige of monogamy in polygamy.\r\n\r\nA higher degree of culture then diminishes warfare, shortens the\r\nperiod of nursing, does away with the prejudices against coitus during\r\npregnancy, and improves the social position of women. Ageing less\r\nquickly, and adding to her bodily charms those of her mental\r\ndevelopment woman restores man to monogamy. As the same time wives and\r\nchildren gradually cease to constitute riches, and this diminishes the\r\ninstinct of procreation. Finally, machinery replaces the female labor\r\nof former times. In this way, with a higher degree of human culture,\r\nall the factors tend to restore monogamy.\r\n\r\nThe instinctive desires of woman are monogamous. The progress of\r\ncivilization is continually extending her rights, and the more refined\r\nsentiments of sympathy among civilized people are less and less\r\ncompatible with polygamy. As regards polyandry, Westermark shows that\r\nit has always been an exception and that it has only been established\r\namong phlegmatic races, having a certain degree of civilization and\r\nbeing unacquainted with jealousy.\r\n\r\nSpencer believes that monogamy will prevail in the future, while\r\nLubbock inclines to polygamy. Westermark thinks that if the progress\r\nof civilization continues as hitherto to become more altruistic, and\r\nthat if love tends to become more refined, the conjoints having more\r\nand more regard for each other, monogamy will always become more\r\nstrict.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I think it idle to prophesy. If mental culture ever\r\nsucceeds in overcoming brutality and barbarism, and if it continues to\r\nmake real progress, I do not think that any of the old systems of\r\nmarriage will persist in their primary form. Primitive monogamy\r\nadapted to an unsocial savage condition, is incompatible with the\r\nsocial requirements which become more and more imposed upon humanity.\r\nMarriage by purchase and Islamite polygamy, which regard woman as\r\nmerchandise and place her entirely under the dependence of man, are\r\nbarbarous customs of semi-civilized people, which have already fallen\r\ninto disuse. Polyandry is contrary to human nature and to the\r\nrequirements of reproduction, and its implantation is everywhere a\r\nsign of decadence. Our present religious monogamy, completed by the\r\nshameful promiscuity of prostitution, is both hypocritical and\r\nunhealthy. Till the contrary is proved, I consider the most\r\nadvantageous form of marriage for the future a kind of free monogamy\r\n(eventually polygamy), accompanied by obligations relative to the\r\nprocreation of children and to the children procreated. Polyandry\r\nshould only have an accessory right to existence in certain\r\npathological or exceptional cases. We shall return to this point\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nAmong birds, marriage is generally concluded for life; among mammals\r\nrarely for more than a year, with the exception of the anthropoid apes\r\nand man.\r\n\r\nThe duration of marriage varies enormously in man. Among the\r\nAndamanese, the Weddas, certain Papous, marriage can only cease with\r\ndeath. Among the North American Indians, on the contrary, it is only\r\nconcluded for a limited period. Among the Wyandottes the custom exists\r\nof trial marriages for several days. In Greenland, divorce often takes\r\nplace at the end of six months. Among the Creeks marriage does not\r\nlast more than a year. In this way is constituted a kind of polygamy\r\nby succession or limited monogamy, which results in the father not\r\nknowing his children.\r\n\r\nAmong the Botocudos, marriage is performed without ceremonies and only\r\nlasts a short time; it can be broken off on the slightest pretext, for\r\nthe pleasure of changing; divorce then becomes as frequent as\r\nmarriage. This is also the case in Queensland, Tasmania and the Samoan\r\nislands. Among the Dyaks and Cingalese, quite young men and women have\r\nalready had several wives or husbands; a man often marries and deserts\r\nthe same woman several times, to take others during the intervals.\r\nAmong the Mantras there are men who have been married forty or fifty\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nIn Persia a woman may marry for periods varying from one hour to\r\nninety-nine years. In Egypt similar customs are met with; a monthly\r\nchange is allowed, so that a man may marry twenty or thirty times in\r\ntwo years. Among the Maues of Sahara the women consider it\r\nfashionable to marry as often as possible, and a long married life is\r\nconsidered by them as vulgar. The Abyssinians, negroes, etc., marry on\r\ntrial or for limited periods. Among the Greeks, Romans and ancient\r\nGermans, divorce was very frequent.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all savage tribes, and in a number of civilized people the\r\nman possesses an unlimited right of rejection. The Hovas compare\r\nmarriage to a loosely tied knot. Among the ancient Jews, Romans,\r\nGreeks and Germans, discontent of the husband was a sufficient reason\r\nfor rejection. On the contrary, among a number of savage races\r\n(Westermark mentions about twenty-five) rejection and divorce are\r\nextremely rare and marriage lasts for life.\r\n\r\nIt is especially where there are children that divorce is rare. With\r\nmost races, sterility of the wife and adultery constitute the\r\nprincipal causes of legal divorce.\r\n\r\nAmong civilized races marriage for life is much more common than with\r\nsavages. This was the case with the Aztecs, etc. Among the Chinese\r\nthere exist seven reasons for divorce: sterility, unchastity,\r\nnegligence toward parents-in-law, talkativeness, desertion, ill-temper\r\nand chronic disease. In Japan the laws are similar, but in spite of\r\nthis divorce is rare in China and Japan.\r\n\r\nIn Christian countries divorce was formerly permitted and was only\r\nprohibited by the Council of Trent. The modern Catholic says: \"Man\r\nmust not separate what God has united.\" Among many savages, on the\r\ncontrary, divorce is left to the free will of the married couple.\r\nElsewhere it is sometimes the man, sometimes both husband and wife who\r\nhave the right to exact divorce for divers reasons, such as\r\ndrunkenness, adultery, prodigality, etc. In Europe, as elsewhere, it\r\nis the desire for change which is the most common cause of divorce.\r\n\r\nChildren constitute the surest cement against conjugal separations.\r\nWith most savages the rejected wife regains not only her _dot_, but\r\nalso part of the common property, or even the whole of it. On the\r\ncontrary, the purchase value of the wife is only as a rule returned to\r\nthe husband when sterility, adultery or other grave reasons are the\r\ncauses of divorce. It results from this that divorce is always very\r\nrare among peoples where the women are very dear.\r\n\r\nThe right of the children after divorce varies a good deal in\r\ndifferent races; sometimes they are adjudged to the husband, sometimes\r\nto the wife. Divorced women often become prostitutes, for example,\r\namong the Chinese and Arabs. As a rule, marriages for love are more\r\nlasting than others, especially when the couple were acquainted before\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely probable that in primitive man marriage only lasted\r\ntill the birth of a child, or at the most a few years. With\r\ncivilization the duration of marriage has been prolonged, higher\r\nmotives having become added to bodily charms, sexual appetite and the\r\ninstinct of procreation, and tending toward more lasting unions.\r\n\r\nMoral reasons have given rise to laws of protection in marriage, but\r\nthe mania which man possesses of dogmatizing on everything has often\r\ncaused these laws to degenerate into abuse or religious absurdities.\r\nIn this way the modern form of our Christian monogamy has been imposed\r\nby a tyrannical dogma of the Roman Church; a dogma which no doubt\r\nstarted from an ideal point of view, but fell into disuse in practice,\r\nowing to the fact that it did not take sufficient account of the\r\nnatural conditions and sexual requirements of the race. This explains\r\nthe present tendency to greater legal liberty, even when the moral\r\ncauses which tend to render monogamous unions durable multiply with\r\nthe progress of civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF EXTRA-CONJUGAL SEXUAL INTERCOURSE\r\n\r\nAs monogamous marriage exists among the anthropoid apes, we have every\r\nreason to believe that it existed with primitive man. In neither case\r\nhas it been the result of artificial laws, but the result of brute\r\nforce and congenital instincts inherited by natural evolution. It\r\noften happened that one male vanquished another and took possession of\r\nthe female, or wife, of the vanquished. Others abducted the female by\r\nsurprise. Later on, marriage by exchange or by purchase, derived from\r\nmarriage by rape, probably constituted the first stage toward a legal\r\nmonogamous or polygamous union, as an element in the most primitive\r\nhuman conventional organizations. In this way we can imagine the main\r\npoints of the prehistoric evolution of marriage.\r\n\r\nWhen the conception of marriage took on a legal character, either that\r\nof possession by the male, or that of a more or less equitable\r\ncontract between the two sexes, we can easily imagine that sexual\r\nintercourse apart from marriage resulted as an inevitable complement.\r\nEvery artificial barrier which the human mind opposes to natural\r\ninstincts immediately gives rise to a movement of opposition on the\r\npart of the latter. The matrimonial laws of primitive or\r\nsemi-civilized races punished adultery in the most barbarous manner by\r\ntorture and death, but were unable to prevent the sexual passions\r\npursuing their course in one way or another.\r\n\r\nCertain abuses or exceptions had, therefore, to be tolerated, or\r\ncertain complementary institutions had to be organized. However, these\r\nlaws generally branded all forms of sexual intercourse apart from\r\nmarriage, with the stigma of inferiority, or contempt, if not of\r\ncrime. The woman, being the weaker, was naturally the one to suffer\r\nmost from this stigma and its consequences.\r\n\r\nThe great diversity in the customs of different human tribes, makes it\r\nnecessary, in order to avoid errors, to guard against generalizing\r\nwithout strong reasons. We cannot, however, here enter into details\r\nwhich would lead us too far. We can, however, affirm that among the\r\nlower or primitive races brute force played the principal role and was\r\nthe fundamental support of marriage, while in higher civilizations\r\nlegal regulation took the upper hand, however absurd or even immoral\r\nit might be.\r\n\r\nIllegal or extra-conjugal forms of sexual intercourse have always\r\nformed two principal groups: _prostitution_ and _concubinage_. No\r\ndoubt, these two varieties are insensibly connected by numerous shades\r\nof transition, but as their development depends on different\r\nprinciples we must distinguish these two forms.\r\n\r\nProstitution is a trade in which a human being sells her body for\r\nmoney, while concubinage consists in more or less free sexual\r\nintercourse apart from marriage, the motive of which is simply the\r\nsexual appetite, convenience or love, although sometimes violence\r\nplays a part in it. We therefore find in extra-marital sexual\r\nintercourse the same motives as in legal unions; legal or religious\r\nsanction only is wanting.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the motives which lead to concubinage may\r\nbe more or less tainted by interested calculation. In all\r\ncivilizations concubinage and prostitution constitute the complement\r\nof legal marriage. Their regulation has ever produced the singular\r\nresults of surrounding them with a moral nimbus.\r\n\r\nIn Babylon, every woman once in her life, had to prostitute herself\r\nfor money to any stranger at the temple of Venus. Solon founded houses\r\nof prostitution for the people and furnished them with slaves, \"in\r\norder to protect the sanctity of marriage against the passions of\r\nyouth.\"\r\n\r\nThe Romans had also their houses of prostitution or lupanari, public\r\nor private, as well as free prostitutes. In the Middle Ages,\r\nprostitution developed especially after the Crusades. It is related\r\nthat the Council of Constance attracted fifteen hundred prostitutes to\r\nthis town. Prostitutes followed the armies everywhere.\r\n\r\nIn India, young girls give themselves to the priests, who are the\r\nrepresentatives of God and enjoy great honors. Under the name of\r\nTemple girls, the girls of the flower boats of China are really\r\nprostitutes. It is the same with the puzes of Java, the girls in the\r\nJapanese tea-houses, etc. In some civilized states, certain refined\r\nand intelligent prostitutes have always obtained great honors and high\r\nfavors, only charging high prices, and ending by substituting for\r\nprostitution the pecuniary exploitation of rich men whom they have\r\nseduced.\r\n\r\nConcubinage may be more or less free. The concubines were formerly\r\noften slaves, possessed by men in high positions, in addition to their\r\nwives. At the present day the omnipotence of money produces almost\r\nanalogous results. Free concubinage, in which sexual intercourse\r\nbetween the two contracting parties is absolutely free and more or\r\nless independent of pecuniary questions, is very different and of a\r\nhigher moral character. It has also existed in antiquity in various\r\nforms. The Greek hetairas were concubines of high position, no doubt\r\nprostitutes of a kind and giving themselves for money; but they became\r\nthe friends or companions of great men. Living in luxury, especially\r\nat the time of Pericles and later, several of them became celebrated;\r\nstatues were raised to them and they became the concubines of kings.\r\nPhryne served as the model for the statue of Venus, and offered to\r\nrestore the halls of the Thebeans at her own expense. Thais was the\r\nmistress of Alexander and gave heirs to the throne. The neglected\r\neducation of the Greek wives caused the intellectual accomplishments\r\nof the hetairas to shine by contrast.\r\n\r\nThe whole question regarding the Greek customs is summed up in a few\r\nwords by Demosthenes: \"We marry wives in order to have legitimate\r\nchildren and a faithful guardian for our household; we have concubines\r\nfor our daily service, and hetairas for the enjoyment of love.\"\r\n\r\nIn some countries, such as Japan, the children of concubines are\r\nconsidered by the husbands as legitimate, and have the same rights as\r\nthose of his wife; this gives concubinage the character of marriage of\r\nthe second rank.\r\n\r\nIn modern times hetairas are not wanting. Under the title of\r\ncourtesans and mistresses, we find them everywhere as the favorites of\r\nkings and nobles, as mistresses of men in high positions, and often\r\nplaying the part of vampires in all classes of society.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, women of high position or wealth have also their\r\nfavorites, whom we may call male hetairas. Certain female members of\r\nroyal families have at all times furnished examples of this kind.\r\n\r\nAt all periods in the history of civilized races, pathology has also\r\nled to extra-conjugal sexual intercourse. Here, homosexual love in\r\ngeneral, and love of boys or pediastry, has always played the\r\nprincipal part. We shall speak of this in Chapter VIII. Among the\r\nHebrews, Persians, Etruscans, and especially the Greeks, it was held\r\nin high esteem. The Greek philosophers regarded it as based on an\r\nideal homosexual love, and not as a vile form of prostitution. Solon,\r\nAristides, Sophocles, Phidias, and Socrates were strongly suspected of\r\nhomosexual practices, and they regarded this form of love as superior\r\nto the normal love of woman. Lesbian love, and other sexual\r\naberrations, such as sadism, have also played a historical role, as we\r\nshall see.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nPrimitive human marriage was probably of short duration; when man\r\nlater on became carnivorous, and had to obtain food for his children\r\nby hunting, sexual unions assumed a more constant character. It is not\r\nthe class or the tribe, but the family which constituted the primitive\r\nsocial condition of man, a condition in which marriage was a heritage\r\nfrom \"pithecomorphous\" ancestors, _i.e._, related to monkeys.\r\n\r\nFree sexual intercourse before marriage and frequent changes in the\r\nlatter were then no doubt very common, but true promiscuity has never\r\nbeen the rule in primitive man.\r\n\r\nPatriarchism with its disastrous consequences has been the result of\r\nthe preponderance of male power. In a higher degree of civilization\r\nthis preponderance has produced marriage by purchase and polygamy. The\r\nbarbarous form of the latter is now decreasing.\r\n\r\nA true higher culture leads gradually to durable love based on\r\naltruism and ethics, _i.e._, a relative and free monogamy.\r\n\r\nThe development of marriage in civilization has gradually increased\r\nthe rights of woman, and marriage contracts tend more and more in\r\ntheir modern forms to stipulate for complete equality of rights for\r\nboth sexes. As Westermark says: \"The history of human marriage is the\r\nhistory of a union in which women have gradually triumphed over the\r\npassions, prejudices and egoism of men.\" The term reëmancipation of\r\nwomen is historically more correct than the simple term emancipation,\r\nfor before the institution of marriage, woman was free. Invented by\r\nthe stronger male when he began to reason, marriage was at first only\r\nthe servitude of woman. To give her complete liberty, it must be\r\ntransformed afresh from top to bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n=Influence of the Race on Sexual Life.=--If I were an ethnographer I\r\nshould attempt to establish whether, and in what way, racial\r\ndifferences affect the sexual life of man; but the question is so\r\ndelicate that it would require a skilled specialist to settle it. With\r\nthe exception of the pages dealing with the history of extra-conjugal\r\nintercourse, the statements in this chapter are based on the work of\r\nWestermark. The chief difficulty consists in separating, in the\r\ncustoms of each race, that which arises from habit and historical\r\ntradition from that which depends on more or less specific hereditary\r\npeculiarities. It is here very easy to fall into error in formulating\r\nfalse conclusions.\r\n\r\nA good deal has been said concerning the hot blood of warm climates,\r\nand on the whole it appears true that people who inhabit these\r\nclimates have a more violent and more precocious sexual temperament\r\nthan those who live in cold regions. But this is not a racial\r\ncharacter. The Jews, who have preserved their race unaltered in all\r\nclimates and under all possible conditions of existence, furnish an\r\nobject lesson which is particularly appropriate to decide the\r\nquestion. The traits of their character are reflected in their sexual\r\nlife. Their sexual appetites are generally strong and their love is\r\ndistinguished by great family attachment. Their sexual life is also\r\ninfluenced by their mercantile spirit, and we find them everywhere\r\nconnected with the traffic of women and prostitution. They are not\r\nvery jealous and are much addicted to concubinage, at the same time\r\nremaining affectionate to their wife and family.\r\n\r\nThe Mongols also lead a very intense sexual life. Among the\r\npolyandrous people of Thibet jealousy appears to be completely absent:\r\nthis may be the result of custom or may be due to phylogenetic\r\ninstinct. The Mormons, who are descended from monogamous races,\r\nconfirm the idea that polygamy is not a specific racial character. It\r\nwould be interesting to study the mixed races of North America from\r\nthis point of view. At first sight, it seems that the Americanization\r\nof customs in the mixture of races of the United States is also\r\nextended to sexual life, and that we cannot discover the fundamental\r\ndifferences between the Irish, Scandinavians, French, Germans and\r\nItalians who constitute this mixture. But it is possible that this is\r\nonly a superficial impression, and that a deeper study of the details\r\nwould lead to another result. One thing appears to be unquestionable\r\nin the negro race; that is the violence of its sexual passion combined\r\nwith its mental inferiority.\r\n\r\nA striking trait is furnished by the French race which has remained\r\npure in the eastern provinces of Canada, whose sexual customs are very\r\ndifferent from those of the present population of France. The French\r\nCanadian is extremely pure and chaste, leads a regular life and has a\r\nnumerous family. Families of fifteen or twenty are not rare among\r\nFrench Canadians. We can here, therefore, observe the effect of\r\nclimate and custom on a single race. For reasons mentioned above, I\r\nshall content myself with a few remarks, but I am certain that a\r\nprofound study of the question would discover, in the character of the\r\nindividuals, specific peculiarities of their race which are only\r\nmarked externally by customs. It is obvious that such characters will\r\nbe all the more distinct, the more the race differs from its\r\ncongeners, and the purer its ethnical separation. As among animals, it\r\nis necessary to distinguish between slight variations, and races or\r\nsub-species which are more constant and more divergent. Hereditary or\r\nphylogenetic individual differences must also be distinguished from\r\nthose of races or varieties.\r\n\r\n=Weight of the Brain in Different Races and Sexes.=--Bebel has stated\r\nthat among savages the difference between the brain of the men and\r\nwomen is less than among civilized people. This statement is quite\r\nwrong. Prof. Rudolph Martin, of Zurich, has given me statistics of the\r\ncranial capacity of the two sexes in different races, drawn from\r\nreliable sources. According to Martin the weight of the brain\r\nrepresents about 87 per cent. of the cranial capacity. His table of\r\nstatistics is given on the opposite page.\r\n\r\nThese figures show that the difference between the two sexes is always\r\nabout the same, while the average absolute weight of the brain in the\r\ntwo sexes is lower in the lower races. Reckoning it 87 per cent. of\r\nthe cranial capacity, it is in the Weddas 1111 grammes for males and\r\n991 grammes for females, which corresponds to the weight of the\r\nbrains of idiots or general paralytics with us. Martin assures me that\r\nin the Malay peninsula he has found as much difference between the men\r\nand women as in Europeans.\r\n\r\nAccording to Martin, men living at the present day may be divided into\r\nthree classes according to their cranial capacity:\r\n\r\n                                         MEN.             WOMEN.\r\n  Aristencephalous (large brains)     over 1450 gr.    over 1300 gr.\r\n  Euencephalous (medium brains)       1300 to 1450.    1150 to 1300.\r\n  Oligencephalous (small brains)      under 1300.      under 1150.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVERAGE CRANIAL CAPACITY IN DIFFERENT RACES\r\n\r\n                                             Men   Women  Difference\r\n               {Badois   { 48 Craniums m. }  1513  1330   183\r\n               {         { 26     \"    f. }\r\nCivilized      {\r\n               {Bavarian {100     \"    m. }  1503  1335   168 (11.2 %)\r\n               {         {100     \"    f. }\r\n\r\n               {Malay    { 26     \"    m. }  1414  1223   191\r\n               {         {  2     \"    f. }\r\nSemi-Civilized {\r\n               {Aino     { 87     \"    m. }  1462  1308   154\r\n               {         { 64     \"    f. }\r\n\r\nLowest Race              { 22     \"    m. }  1277  1139   138 (10.8%)\r\nWeddas                   { 10     \"    m. }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSEXUAL EVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evolution of every living being is twofold. We must distinguish:\r\n(1) its _ontogeny_, or the entire cycle of development of the\r\nindividual from its conception till natural death at an advanced age;\r\n(2) its _phylogeny_, or the series of organic forms through which its\r\nancestors passed, by successive transformations, from the primitive\r\ncells of the oldest and most obscure geological periods, up to its\r\npresent organization.\r\n\r\nIn its chief outlines ontogeny is determined by phylogeny by means of\r\nthe laws of heredity, even when it is only an abridged recapitulation.\r\n\r\nRegarded from this point of view the sexual life of man is also based\r\non phylogenetic conditions, determined by his ancestral lineage.\r\nMoreover, it presents an individual or ontogenetic evolution during\r\nthe life of each person, which in its principal traits is\r\npredetermined in the germ, by the phylogenetic or hereditary energies\r\nof the species. The phenomena of the hereditary mneme show clearly how\r\nontogeny is the result of engraphia combined with selection, in the\r\nseries of ancestors. We have already mentioned these points on several\r\noccasions, but must now review the whole question.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYLOGENY OF SEXUAL LIFE\r\n\r\nIn Chapter II we have briefly described phylogeny in general or\r\nmetamorphosis, and in the first part of Chapter IV we have specially\r\nconsidered the phylogeny of the sexual appetite in the phenomenon of\r\ncell division and conjugation of nuclei in unicellular organisms,\r\nwhich we have described in Chapter I. In order for animals to\r\nreproduce themselves without degenerating, crossing, or the\r\ncombination of different germs, is necessary, and such combinations\r\nare only possible by the mutual attraction of two kinds of germinal\r\ncells. But, when the individual becomes multicellular and bears only\r\none kind of germinal cells, the attractive energy which was originally\r\nlimited to these cells is transmitted to the whole organism, and this\r\nnecessitates the existence of sensory and motor nerve centers.\r\n\r\nThe attraction of one kind of germinal cell and its bearer for the\r\nother must also be more or less mutual. As a rule the bearer of one of\r\nthe germinal cells becomes active and penetrating; that of the other\r\npassive and receptive. However, the latter, who after copulation (when\r\nthis occurs) becomes the sole bearer of the future individual, is\r\nobliged to desire union with the active bearer of the other germinal\r\ncell, so that reproduction may become harmonious. This is the basis on\r\nwhich is founded sexual reproduction, and with it the sexual appetite,\r\nin plants (as regards cellular conjugation only) as well as in\r\nanimals, but especially in the latter, in whom the germinal cells are\r\ncarried by mobile and independent individuals. On the same basis is\r\ndeveloped the difference between the sexual appetite in man and woman,\r\nas well as that between love and the other irradiations of this\r\nappetite in the mental life of both sexes. (Vide Chapters IV and V.)\r\n\r\nThe immense complication of human sexual life makes us regard animals\r\nwith a certain degree of contempt, and flatter our vanity in\r\nqualifying the baser part of our sexual appetite by the term _animal\r\ninstinct_. But we are really very unjust toward animals. This\r\ninjustice is partly due to the fact that vocal and written language\r\ngives us a means of penetrating into the psychology of our fellow\r\ncreatures. By the aid of the common symbolism of our thoughts it is\r\neasy for us to compare them. Language thus enables us to construct a\r\ngeneral human psychology. The absence of language, even in the higher\r\nanimals, renders it difficult for us to penetrate their mind. Our\r\ninductive reasoning in this matter is very uncertain, for we can only\r\njudge the mental power of animals by their acts. The brain, and\r\nconsequently the mind, of the higher mammals being less highly\r\norganized than that of man, their sexual psychology is also more\r\nprimitive, and differs from ours in proportion to the cerebral\r\ndevelopment of the species. Comparative anatomy confirms this fact in\r\nthe whole series of organisms which possess a central nervous system.\r\nThe psychology of the higher apes is thus nearer our own than that of\r\nthe dog; the psychology of the dog resembles ours more than that of\r\nthe rabbit, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the highly developed cerebral organization of man,\r\nalthough it has complicated the mental irradiations of his sexual\r\nappetite, has not always ennobled them; on the contrary, it has often\r\ndirected them into pernicious paths. We have seen in Chapter VI\r\nnumerous and striking proofs of the degeneration, brutality and\r\ncruelty of the manifestations of the human sexual appetite, and we\r\nshall study them further in Chapter VIII. Comparative biology shows us\r\nthat the sexual appetite is transformed into love in very different\r\nways. In order to avoid the immensity of detail of comparative biology\r\nI shall only give a few examples.\r\n\r\nWhile the female spider often kills and eats the male, monkeys, and\r\nparrots give proof of such a great mutual attachment that when one of\r\nthe conjoints dies the other sinks into complete despair, ceases to\r\neat, and perishes in its turn.\r\n\r\nIn this domain we find singular adaptations to special conditions of\r\nexistence. Among the bees and ants, a third class of individuals, or\r\nneuters, formed by differentiation of females, do not copulate, and\r\nlay at the most a few eggs which are not fecundated and which\r\noccasionally develop by parthenogenesis.\r\n\r\nAmong the termites, another species of social ants, a similar state of\r\nthings exists, but the neuters, or workers, are derived from the male\r\nsex as well as the female and their sexual organs are quite\r\nrudimentary. The third sex, or worker, not only has a cerebral\r\ndevelopment superior to the sexual individuals, but also inherits the\r\nsocial sympathetic irradiations of the sexual appetite, which results\r\nin his devotion to a brood which is not his own. Among the social\r\ninsects the males are little more than flying sexual organs, which\r\nafter copulation are incapable of leading an independent existence and\r\ndie of hunger and exhaustion in the case of ants or termites, or are\r\nmassacred by the workers in the case of bees.\r\n\r\nThe fecundated females, on their part, become breeding machines whose\r\nactivity is incessant. Among the ants, however, the females are at\r\nfirst capable of nourishing a few larvæ by the aid of a portion of\r\ntheir eggs and their secretions, till the workers are hatched, who\r\nhenceforth undertake all the work including the maternal care of the\r\nbrood.\r\n\r\nWhoever has observed the fidelity of a pair of swallows and the way in\r\nwhich the male and female nourish and rear their young, must be struck\r\nby the analogy to the conjugal and family love of the faithful type of\r\nhuman beings. This is especially remarkable when the same couple\r\nreturn every year to the old nest. This family life of the swallows\r\ndoes not prevent a certain social life, which manifests itself in\r\norganized attacks on birds of prey, and in combined emigration in the\r\nautumn and spring.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we are instinctively indignant at the want of\r\nfidelity in other animals, between conjoints, parents and offspring\r\n(dogs and rabbits, for instance), because we involuntarily expect to\r\nfind in them our own moral sense, which is not at all just.\r\n\r\nFrom the phylogenetic point of view we can only compare ourselves to\r\nthe higher apes, by their analogies with primitive man. (Vide Chapter\r\nVI.) The question which concerns us here is as follows: If we consider\r\nthe peculiarities of our sexual customs with those of our direct\r\nancestors, what are those which are derived from ancient and profound\r\nphylogenetic instincts, those which are derived from less profound\r\nancestral energies (_i.e._, relatively more recent) and lastly those\r\nwhich depend simply on old customs fixed by tradition, prejudice and\r\nhabit? If we are careful we shall immediately recognize that it is not\r\nonly the sexual appetite itself, but also a large part of its\r\ncorrelatives and irradiations, in which the phylogenetic roots are\r\ndeep. Jealousy, coquetry, instinctive maternal love, fidelity and\r\nconjugal love, which are more or less developed in primitive man, are\r\nalso present in monkeys and birds. We have even seen that the conjugal\r\nfidelity of these often exceeds our own. It is, therefore, not true\r\nthat our animal ancestors are only allied to us by sexual appetite; on\r\nthe contrary, we must admit that they have much more noble sentiments\r\nand instincts, derived it is true from this appetite, but belonging to\r\nthe domain of a higher social morality. All that we can say in a\r\ngeneral way concerning the complex entanglement of our sentiments and\r\ninstincts is that, the most deeply rooted characters in human nature\r\nare at the same time, phylogenetically speaking, the most ancient.\r\n\r\nAmong the most profound instincts of sexual life, we find moral and\r\nintellectual incongruities. Along with excitement of the sexual\r\nappetite in the male by the odor of the female genital organs, or by\r\nthe sight of erotic pictures, we find the most touching conjugal love,\r\nand life-long devotion of one conjoint for the other and for the\r\nchildren. Prostitution, marriage by purchase, religious marriage,\r\ndisgrace attached to illegitimate births, conjugal and family rights\r\nof one or the other sex, etc., are, on the contrary, things which do\r\nnot depend on recent phylogeny, but only on the customs and traditions\r\nof certain races. They are partly outgrowths from egoism, the spirit\r\nof domination, mysticism and hypocrisy, and partly the shifts of an\r\noverheated social life which is becoming more and more complicated.\r\n\r\nWestermark's studies are very instructive in this respect. All the\r\nabsurdities and contradictions, brought to light by the historical and\r\nethnographical study of the customs and matrimonial abuses in man,\r\nallow us to clearly distinguish that which is due to fashion or\r\ncustom, from that which is deeply rooted in our heredity. To avoid\r\nrepetition I refer my readers to Chapter VI, to examine the\r\ndifferences between heredity and custom.\r\n\r\nBetween these two extremes there is, however, one important domain,\r\nviz., that of _recent phylogeny_, or in other words _variation_. The\r\nfixed appetites and instincts of the species which are proper to every\r\nnormal man, and are as we have seen fundamentally connected with many\r\nanimal forms, belong to ancient and profound phylogeny. But there is\r\nanother group of very variable peculiarities, strongly developed in\r\nsome men and little in others, sometimes completely absent, which do\r\nnot depend on custom but on what is called individual hereditary\r\ndisposition, or individual character. While some men have monogamous\r\ninstincts others are polygamous. Some men are by instinct and heredity\r\nvery egoistic, others more altruistic. This peculiarity is reflected\r\nin their sexual life and changes the character of their love (but not\r\nthat of their sexual instinct). The egoist may love his wife, but this\r\nlove is interested and very different from that of the altruist.\r\nBetween the two extremes there is an infinite number of gradations\r\naccording to the nature of the instincts and dispositions. The same\r\nman may be a good and generous father, and a social exploiter with\r\nneither shame nor pity. Another will pose as a social benefactor,\r\nwhile at home he is an egoist and a tyrant. The individual\r\ndispositions of recent phylogeny are combined in every way with\r\neducation, customs, habit and social position to produce results which\r\nare often paradoxical, and the factors of which are ambition, vanity,\r\ntemper, etc. Recent phylogeny is reflected also in many of the\r\nirradiations of the sexual appetite of which we have spoken in Chapter\r\nV. Audacity, jealousy, sexual braggardism, hypocrisy, prudery,\r\npornography, coquetry, exaltation, etc., depend in each particular\r\ncase, according to their degree of development, on a combination of\r\nindividual sexual hereditary dispositions with individual dispositions\r\nin the other domains of sentiment, intelligence and will. In this way,\r\nthe sexual individuality of one man is constituted in a very complex\r\nand very different way to that of other men, owing to the high\r\ndevelopment of the human brain, as well as to the infinite variability\r\nand adaptability of his aptitudes. It is impossible to give even an\r\nincomplete explanation of all the symphonic gradations (often\r\ncacophonic) which represent an individuality, or to fix clearly what\r\ndistinguishes it from others. However, when the principle is\r\nunderstood, it is not difficult to estimate the sexual individuality\r\nof each person more or less correctly.\r\n\r\nStrong hereditary dispositions of character may be recognized in early\r\ninfancy. When the ancestry of a man is well known the roots of his\r\nrecent phylogeny may be traced to his ancestors. Here we observe the\r\neffect of crossing between varieties or different races, or on the\r\ncontrary that of consanguinity. This effect is observed in character\r\nand in sexual disposition, as much as in the shape of the nose, or the\r\ncolor of the skin and hair, etc. It is important that men should learn\r\nto know themselves, and also study each other from this point of view\r\nbefore marrying. On the whole, we may say that the average civilized\r\nman of our race possesses as his \"phylogenetic baggage\" a strong\r\nsexual appetite, very variable sentiments of love, generally somewhat\r\nmediocre, (we have seen that conjugal love is more strongly developed\r\nin most monkeys than in man), lastly altruistic or social sentiments\r\nwhich are still deplorably weak. The latter, no doubt, form no part of\r\nthe sexual life, but they must be taken into consideration for they\r\nare its most important derivatives, and it is indispensable for our\r\nmodern social life to develop them in harmony with family and conjugal\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nHereditary instincts can easily be observed in children. When one of\r\nthem is good, it gives evidence at an early age of the sentiments of\r\nsympathy or altruism, such as pity and affection, as well as an\r\ninstinctive sentiment of duty, the object of which is not yet social.\r\nAll these sentiments are at first only applied to human individuals\r\nknown to the child, domestic animals, or even inanimate objects. On\r\nthe other hand, the ant, from the beginning of its existence, shows an\r\ninherited instinct or sentiment of complete social duty. In man,\r\nsocial sentiments properly so-called, have to be acquired by\r\neducation, but they require for their expansion a considerable degree\r\nof inherited sentiments of sympathy and duty. A person without morals\r\ncan easily acquire social phraseology but not social sentiment. A few\r\nmore points require to be considered.\r\n\r\nMonogamy is no doubt an old and well-established phylogenetic\r\nheritage, while polygamy is on the whole rather an aberration produced\r\nby individual power and wealth. But phylogenetic monogamy is by no\r\nmeans identical with the religious or other formality of our present\r\nlegal monogamy. It assumes first of all an early marriage immediately\r\nafter puberty, while our civilization has placed between this and\r\nmarriage, which it only allows later as a rule, the unhealthy swamp of\r\nprostitution, which so often sows in the individual the destructive\r\nseed for his future legal union, before this has taken place. Again,\r\nphylogenetic monogamy imposes no legal constraint; on the contrary, it\r\nassumes a free, natural and instinctive inclination in each of the\r\nconjoints, when it is not the result of the brute force of the male.\r\nLastly, it by no means excludes a change after a certain time. We are\r\nspeaking only of man, and not of birds and monkeys, who are more\r\nmonogamous than ourselves.\r\n\r\nMonogamy without children has little reason for its existence and must\r\nbe considered simply as a means to satisfy the sexual appetite or as a\r\nunion for convenience. It is the same with certain marriages between\r\nindividuals of very different ages, especially the marriage of a young\r\nman with a woman already old and sterile.\r\n\r\nAs far as we can ascertain, the majority of sexual perversions, of\r\nwhich we shall speak in Chapter VIII, are a sad pathological\r\nacquisition of the human race. We observe, however, especially in the\r\nhigher mammals, acts of pederasty between males when the female is\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\nThe sexual repulsion which normally exists between animals of\r\ndifferent species rests on a selective basis, the hereditary mneme of\r\ntheir reciprocal germs being unable to place itself in homophony, and\r\ntheir blood also having a mutual toxic action. In speaking of sodomy\r\nwe shall see that this instinctive repulsion may disappear in\r\npathological cases, both in man and in animals, owing to bad habits or\r\nunsatisfied sexual appetite. We cannot absolutely demonstrate the\r\nphylogenetic existence of an instinctive disgust for consanguineous\r\nsexual intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe sexual advances made by women in civilized countries, show how\r\neasily we may be deceived in attributing to a phylogenetic or\r\nhereditary origin, certain details which are only due to external\r\ncircumstances. In man, the bearer of the active germ, the instinct of\r\nsexual advance has deep phylogenetic roots. It is quite natural to him\r\nand is evident among savage races, where the man risks more by\r\nremaining single than the woman. Violent combats between rivals to\r\nobtain the woman, who remains passive like most animals, are evidence\r\nof this.\r\n\r\nCivilization has changed all this, and has developed two castes of\r\nwomen, the old maids and the prostitutes. The latter satisfy the\r\nappetites of men in an artificial and unhealthy manner, while marriage\r\nand family cares only bring them labor and burdens instead of riches.\r\nOwing to the promiscuous polyandry of prostitution, man can always\r\nobtain enough women, while woman can with difficulty obtain a suitable\r\nhusband. These circumstances have more and more developed the art of\r\nflirtation, coquetry and advances on the part of girls, and we can now\r\nsee, especially in the United States, that advances come more and more\r\nfrom the female side, if not in principle, at any rate in fact. This\r\nis not a question of a phylogenetic or hereditary transformation of\r\nthe sexes among civilized peoples, but an unhealthy effect resulting\r\nfrom abnormal circumstances, that is the non-satisfaction of the\r\nsexual desires of woman, together with the satiety of those of men.\r\nWoman makes advances from the fear of remaining celibate; she will\r\ncease to do so when the unnatural causes which have produced this\r\nstate of things have been done away with.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, a normal and adaptable man will conduct himself in sexual\r\nmatters as in others according to the prevailing fashion. He will most\r\noften succeed in accommodating his sentiments to those of his\r\nconjoint. On the other hand, this average representative of normal\r\nmediocrity easily becomes the slave of routine and incapable of new\r\nideas. However normal he may be, he has less faculty of adaptation or\r\nmental plasticity and less liberty, than a man of higher nature\r\nindependent of prejudices.\r\n\r\n\r\nONTOGENY OF SEXUAL LIFE\r\n\r\nThe first striking fact in the ontogeny of sexual life is the\r\nfollowing: All the sexual organs, both external and internal, remain\r\nin an embryonic and non-functional state, not only in the embryo but\r\nfor a long time in the child. The organs and their elements exist, but\r\nthey are still small, imperfectly developed, and in a state of rest.\r\nAt the time of puberty, which varies in different individuals, the\r\nsexual glands and the other copulatory apparatus enlarge and begin to\r\nfunctionate. In the European races puberty occurs between the age of\r\ntwelve and seventeen years in girls, and between fourteen and nineteen\r\nin boys; it is generally earlier in the South and later in the North.\r\nIt is curious to note that the correlative irradiations of the sexual\r\nappetite in the human mind develop much earlier than the organs, or\r\neven the sexual appetite. Again, the sexual appetite often appears\r\nbefore the normal development of the genital organs. In other rare\r\ncases the sexual appetite is absent in the adult, even when the\r\ncorresponding organs are well-developed. (Vide Chapter VIII.) Such\r\nirregularities of the sexual appetite belong to the domain of\r\npathology.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is quite normal for young girls and boys to show\r\nearly signs of mental differences corresponding to those we have\r\ndescribed in Chapter V. In young girls we observe coquetry and\r\njealousy and the desire for finery. Their love of dolls and the care\r\nthey take of them, is very characteristic of the precocious instinct\r\nof their sex. This is an early sign of instinctive maternal love,\r\nbefore the development of any sexual sensation or function. Among boys\r\nwe observe a tendency to brag and to boast of their strength before\r\ngirls, to show their contempt for dolls and the coquetry of little\r\ngirls, and also to pose as protectors, etc.\r\n\r\nSexual jealousy already exists in young children. We see little boys,\r\nseeking for the favors of little girls, show violent jealousy when\r\nanother is preferred to them. All these phenomena depend either on\r\nsubconscious instincts, or on vague sexual presentiments which play a\r\nlarge part in the infantile exaltation of sentiment. Portraits of\r\npretty women, the sight of certain parts of the body or feminine\r\nclothing often provoke exalted sentiments in boys; girls rather admire\r\nboldness, an imposing presence and often beauty, in the other sex.\r\n\r\nPuberty is produced by certain phenomena which occur in the sexual\r\norgans. In the boy erections occur at an early age when the penis is\r\nstill very small. It is curious to note that certain pathological\r\nconditions and friction of the glans penis, especially in the case of\r\nphimosis and as a result of bad example, are often sufficient to\r\nproduce sexual sensations and appetites in very young boys. The same\r\nthing is produced in little girls by excitation of the clitoris. All\r\nthese phenomena lead to onanism or masturbation, of which we shall\r\nspeak later on. As the testicles of young boys do not secrete semen,\r\nmasturbation only provokes secretion from the accessory glands, but\r\nthis is accompanied by orgasm.\r\n\r\nMore singular still are cases of coitus between little boys and girls\r\nwhose sexual glands are still undeveloped and produce no germinal\r\ncells. Although they are pathological, these phenomena are\r\ncharacteristic, because they clearly show that the brain has acquired\r\nby phylogeny a sexual appetite relatively independent of the\r\ndevelopment of the sexual glands. No doubt the sexual appetite does\r\nnot develop, or disappears, in eunuchs when they are castrated quite\r\nyoung; but it is preserved together with the secretions and functions\r\nof the external genitals when castration is performed after puberty is\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe important conclusion which results from these facts is that the\r\nexistence of a sexual excitation or appetite of this nature is not\r\nsufficient to prove that they are normal. In Chapter VIII we shall\r\nprove that not only the anomalies of the hereditary sexual\r\ndisposition, but artificial excitations and bad habits may also\r\nproduce all kinds of misconduct and excesses which should be\r\nenergetically combated.\r\n\r\nWe have described in Chapter IV the great individual variations of the\r\nsexual appetite in the two sexes, as well as that of the sexual power\r\nin man. The sexual power and appetite in man are strongest between the\r\nyears of twenty and forty. We may even consider this period as the\r\nmost advantageous for the procreation of strong and healthy offspring\r\nand that the procreator is at his best before the age of thirty.\r\n\r\nThe ontogenetic development of the sexual appetite and love generally\r\nproduces in man a peculiar phenomenon. While habitual gratification\r\nand education of the sexual appetite tends to make it more and more\r\ncalculating and cynical, love, on the contrary, becomes more elevated\r\nand refined with age and less egoistical than in youth. Owing to\r\ngeneral mental development, the education of sentiments progresses and\r\nbecomes refined, while the sexual appetite diminishes in intensity and\r\nbecomes more imperious and more coarse. We are only speaking here of\r\nnormal cases.\r\n\r\nIn youth, the intoxication of love combined with intense sexual\r\nappetite triumphs; when the appetite is once satisfied the unbridled\r\nand egoistic passions of this age come to the surface and are often\r\nantagonistic to love. At a more advanced age, on the contrary, love\r\nbecomes more constant and more tranquil. The mistake that is so often\r\nmade is the confusion of love with sexual appetite. The novelists who\r\nspeculate on the eroticism of the public are no doubt more interested\r\nin describing sexual passion and amorous intoxication, with all the\r\ncatastrophes and conflicts which arise from them, than the tranquil\r\nand regular love of a couple more advanced in age, the greatest\r\nhappiness of which consists in harmony of sentiment and thought, as\r\nwell as the mutual regard and devotion of the couple for each other.\r\n\r\nSexual appetite and sexual power in man become extinguished between\r\nthe ages of sixty and eighty; old men of eighty are sometimes still\r\ncapable, but they are no longer fecund. As a rule sexual power\r\ndiminishes before sexual appetite, and this sometimes leads old men to\r\nuse artificial means to revive their power, or to satisfy their sexual\r\ndesires. This explains why the egoists who have never known true love\r\noften become so base in their sexual manifestations when they grow\r\nold. Their experience of sexual life makes them experts in the art of\r\nseduction. If this fact appears to be antagonistic to the law that\r\ntrue love is refined with advancing age, we must bear in mind that the\r\nontogenetic development of the sexual appetite is not the same as that\r\nof love; that in some respects it develops in a contrary direction;\r\nand that the result may consequently become inverted according as one\r\nor other predominates. It is needless to say that there are a number\r\nof intermediate gradations, and that inverse phenomena may be produced\r\nconcurrently in the same individual.\r\n\r\nAccording to Westermark elderly men generally fall more easily in love\r\nwith middle-aged women than with young girls. No doubt this is often\r\nthe case when reason and love predominate, but it is necessary to\r\navoid generalization, and it is curious to observe how often very old\r\nmen become enamored of quite young girls, as the latter may fall in\r\nlove with old men. It is common knowledge that young girls do not\r\nmarry old graybeards solely for their money or their name. No doubt\r\nthis is not uncommon, but I have often seen girls of eighteen or\r\ntwenty fall in love with old _roués_, when money, name and position\r\nwere theirs and not the man's. However, in such cases it is most often\r\nthe old man who is amorous. Westermark maintains that this condition\r\nis not normal, and we shall see that very often it is a case of\r\ncommencing _senile dementia_, a pathological cerebral condition in\r\nwhich the sexual appetite becomes suddenly revived.\r\n\r\nThe love of a young girl for an old man may be explained by the\r\nintellectual superiority of the old man or by the absence of another\r\nobject for love. It is often also due to hysteria and consequently\r\npathological.\r\n\r\nIn old age, when the sexual life of two conjoints is extinguished,\r\nthere remains a purified love which colors the evening of their life\r\nwith autumn tints. The modern detractors of marriage too often forget\r\nthis phenomenon. No doubt the evening of conjugal life is often\r\ntroubled with discord and sorrow, but then it is usually a question of\r\n\"_mariage de convenance_,\" marriage for money or position, mutual\r\nmisunderstanding, or irreflective amorous intoxication. Quarrels may\r\nalso arise when pathological conditions become introduced into\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nIn woman, sexual ontogeny is not the same as in man. She matures\r\nearlier and more rapidly. In our race, a woman at eighteen is sexually\r\nmature; between eighteen and twenty-five she is in the best condition\r\nfor sexual life; toward fifty the menopause occurs, and with it\r\ncessation of fecundity. Hence the period during which a woman is\r\nfecund is much shorter than in man and terminates much earlier.\r\n\r\nOwing to this, the development of the intellectual and sentimental\r\nirradiations of the sexual appetite in woman is more rapid than in\r\nman. A young girl is much more mature and full grown as regards her\r\nreproductive power than a young man. These phenomena extend to the\r\nwhole mental life of woman, who is less capable of an ulterior\r\ndevelopment in old age than man, because she generally becomes settled\r\nand automatic much more rapidly than the latter. No doubt these\r\nphenomena are partly due to the defective mental education of women,\r\nbut this explanation is insufficient. Here again we must distinguish\r\nthe phylogenetic disposition of woman from the effects of education\r\nduring her ontogenetic development.\r\n\r\nThe sexual appetite of woman manifests itself at first in vague\r\ndesires, in a want of love, and does not as a rule develop locally\r\ntill after coitus. It often follows that in ontogenetic evolution the\r\nsexual appetite of women increases at a more advanced age (between\r\nthirty and forty). At this age women often become enamored with young\r\nboys, whom they seduce easily. Widows are especially disposed to form\r\nunions with men younger than themselves; these unions are rarely\r\nhappy, for the woman who is older than her husband easily becomes\r\njealous, and the husband soon becomes tired of a woman whose charms\r\nhave faded. We can therefore affirm that, as a rule, in order to be\r\nboth normal and lasting, a monogamous union requires that the husband\r\nshould be from six to twelve years older than his wife, and that the\r\nlatter should marry as young as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the sexual ontogeny of normal woman, pregnancies, childbirth, the\r\nnursing and education of children play an infinitely greater role than\r\nthe sexual appetite. These important events in woman's life, together\r\nwith affection for her husband occupy a great part of the cerebral\r\nactivity of every woman, and are at the same time the conditions for\r\nher true happiness.\r\n\r\nWe should expect the sexual appetite in woman to diminish or cease at\r\nthe menopause; but this is not usually the case, and elderly women are\r\nsometimes tormented by the sexual appetite, which is all the more\r\npainful because men are not attracted by them. Such hyperæsthesia\r\ncannot, however, be considered as normal; most often the sexual\r\nappetite diminishes with age and is replaced, as in man, by the\r\ntranquil love of old age, of which we have spoken.\r\n\r\nOld women are often spoken of with contempt. No doubt, unsatisfied\r\npassions and wounded feelings of all kinds, want of intellectual\r\nculture and high ideals, and especially a pathological condition of\r\nthe brain, make many old women anything but amiable. I am, however,\r\nconvinced that the elevation of woman's social position, and greater\r\ncare in her education, will considerably facilitate the development of\r\nher faculties. Education should not develop mundane qualities in\r\nwomen, but depth of sentiment. There are many aged women who can be\r\ncited as examples of activity and perseverance, for their sound and\r\nclear judgment, as well as for their affability and simplicity of\r\nmanners. Although their intellectual productiveness ceases earlier\r\nthan that of man, this in no way excludes an excellent and persevering\r\nactivity of mind, combined with much judgment and sentimental\r\nqualities. A woman who is growing old and has lost the members of her\r\nfamily, especially her husband, requires some object to replace them\r\nin her affection. To devote herself to social activity will be the\r\nbest antidote against the peevish, querulous or sorrowful moods which\r\nso easily take possession of the aged woman. It appears that love,\r\nwhich is a phylogenetic derivative of the sexual appetite, and which\r\nin middle life is intimately associated with this appetite, becomes\r\nafterwards more and more independent of it and then requires more\r\ncompensation. There is here a great adaptation of love to life, an\r\nadaptation which it is necessary to bear in mind.\r\n\r\nIn infancy the individual is naturally egoistic; his appetites all\r\ntend to self-preservation. There are even then, however, great\r\nindividual differences, and we meet with children who are endowed with\r\na remarkable sentiment of duty and a great sensibility to the troubles\r\nof others. After puberty man's sexual desire leads him to love, toward\r\ndual egoism, and this desire becomes the principal factor in the\r\nreproduction of the species. In old age the individual has no\r\nreproductive aims to fulfill; his life is only a burden on society, if\r\nit is not directed with a view to benefit others and society in\r\ngeneral. By expansion and purification love, at first sexual, is\r\ngradually transformed into purely humanitarian love, _i.e._,\r\naltruistic or social. At least this is what it should be, and then the\r\nfundamental biogenetic law of Haeckel (ontogeny is an abridged\r\nrepetition of phylogeny) will receive an ultimate confirmation. Our\r\nprimitive unicellular animal ancestor lived for itself alone; later on\r\nsexual reproduction without love was established; then conjugal and\r\nfamily love appeared (birds, monkeys, mammals, etc.), finally social\r\nlove or altruism was produced, _i.e._, the sense of social solidarity\r\nbased on the sentiment of duty.\r\n\r\nThe last is still very weak in man, while some animal species, such as\r\nthe bees and ants, have developed it in a more complete manner, on the\r\nbasis of instinct. According to this natural law, all social\r\norganization naturally develops altruism or the sentiment of duty. The\r\nhistory of humanity proves that our social union is only developed\r\nslowly and laboriously through innumerable contests, and that it is\r\nderived, directly or indirectly, from the family union of individuals.\r\nExtension of communication on the surface of the earth causes the\r\nartificial development of social organization to advance much more\r\nrapidly than the natural phylogenetic development by evolution of the\r\nsentiments or social instincts. The latter are, however, forced to\r\nfollow the movement, resting first on the deep roots of family and\r\nfriendly altruism, as well as on that of caste or clan (patriotism);\r\n_i.e._, on sentiments of sympathy and duty toward certain individuals\r\nwho are more closely connected with us, sentiments which are\r\nhereditary in man. A vague general humanitarian sentiment, a hothouse\r\nflower which is still feeble, has already commenced to grow on this\r\nnatural basis. Let us hope that it will live.\r\n\r\nIt would be a fundamental error to try and found social solidarity\r\nsolely on our phylogenetic sentiments of sympathy, or on our ideal\r\nfaculty of devotion and self-sacrifice; but to try and take egoism as\r\na basis for this solidarity is a still greater error. We must not make\r\nan antinomy of egoism and altruism, but regard them as two elements\r\ninseparable from all human society, as well as the individuals who\r\ncompose it. We cannot deny that the altruist, endowed with strong\r\nsentiments of sympathy and duty, is an excellent social worker, while\r\nthe pure egoist constitutes an element of decomposition for society.\r\nIt is, therefore, a social duty to proceed by the sexual route to a\r\nselection which will cause the first to multiply and eliminate the\r\nsecond as far as possible by sterilizing his germs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSEXUAL PATHOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this subject we refer the reader to the well-known work of\r\nKrafft-Ebing, \"Psychopathia Sexualis,\"[4] in which will be found a\r\nnumber of observations, the details of which we cannot enter into\r\nhere. We may first of all say that with the exception of venereal\r\ndiseases the genital organs by themselves only play a very small part\r\nin sexual pathology. The brain is the true domain of nearly all sexual\r\nanomalies.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, we may remark that the disorders of sexual life\r\nonly rarely belong to acute affections which the physician can treat\r\nwith pharmaceutical or other common remedies. They almost exclusively\r\noriginate in the mental constitution, _i.e._, in the hereditary\r\ndispositions of the brain of the individual. But the pathology of\r\nmental or cerebral conditions offers an extremely vast field, capable\r\nof so much extension that no definite limit can be fixed between the\r\nnormal state and morbid states, which are themselves connected by\r\nnumerous transitions. A great number of acts due to mental conditions\r\nwhich the public and even learned theologians, jurists and physicians\r\nnot initiated in psychiatry, consider as criminal, sinful, or\r\ninfamous, are only the product of pathological aberrations due to\r\nhereditary dispositions. I was recently consulted by a patient of this\r\nkind, otherwise possessed of noble sentiments, who told me that a\r\nphysician in Germany to whom he related his troubles, turned on him\r\nfuriously and said, \"These things are filthy; you are a pig; hold your\r\ntongue and get away from here!\" As a matter of fact this unfortunate\r\npatient was sustaining a heroic struggle against his perverted\r\npathological sexual appetites. Knowing little or nothing of these\r\nmatters human society, with few exceptions, is of the same opinion as\r\nthe ignorant doctor mentioned above. For this reason I think it\r\nnecessary at least to give an outline of phenomena which, although\r\nvery repulsive in themselves, throw much light on the sexual question.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY OF THE SEXUAL ORGANS\r\n\r\nEvery deformity, disease or operation which destroys the sexual glands\r\nin the child, or prevents them from developing, gives rise to the\r\nphenomena which we have described when speaking of castration. This is\r\nthe case, for instance, with cryptorchidism in which the testicles\r\nremain in the inguinal canal and become atrophied, instead of\r\ndescending into the scrotum. The following case is an example, and is\r\ninteresting in other respects:\r\n\r\n    A young man was affected with imbecility and congenital\r\n    cryptorchidism with atrophy of the testicles. A eunuch from\r\n    birth, he developed no sexual appetite and no correlative\r\n    masculine character. To make a man of him, his too eager aunts\r\n    married him to a strong girl, who was anything but innocent. She\r\n    attempted by all kinds of manipulations to cure the sexual\r\n    blindness of her husband; but this was a waste of labor, as the\r\n    unhappy wretch only regarded the performance as disgusting and\r\n    filthy. He was violently excited and became somnambulistic.\r\n\r\n    Soon afterwards the wife consoled herself with a lover of normal\r\n    sexual power, and they both overwhelmed the poor eunuch with\r\n    raillery. The latter, becoming furious, offered his wife a cake\r\n    poisoned with arsenic on her birthday, but she saw through the\r\n    stratagem. The poor wretch was sent for trial and condemned to a\r\n    long term of imprisonment for attempted poisoning. I consider\r\n    this judgment as a legal crime. In spite of my protests,\r\n    imbecility was not admitted, and the somnambulism was looked\r\n    upon as simulated.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the same lesions when they occur in the adult\r\nneither destroy the correlative sexual characters, nor the power of\r\ncoitus, nor the voluptuous sensation of the orgasm.\r\n\r\nIn man, _aspermia_ sometimes occurs; the testicles appear to be well\r\nformed, but the semen contains no spermatozoa. In spite of this the\r\naspermatic individual generally has erections, a certain amount of\r\nsexual power and orgasm, and is capable of amorous feelings, although\r\nhis sexual functions are generally feeble. But he is incapable of\r\nfecundating a woman.\r\n\r\nSome women who have never menstruated possess normal ovaries and may\r\nbecome pregnant.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis, tumors and inflammations of the testicles and ovaries\r\nmay cause sterility.\r\n\r\nThe erection of the penis is often rendered impossible by certain\r\ndeformities, such as _hypospadias_ and _epispadias_, in which the\r\nurethral canal opens respectively below or above the penis.\r\n\r\nInvoluntary emissions of semen without erection, with or without\r\nvoluptuous sensation, is called _spermatorrhea_. This is often a\r\nresult of onanism, nervousness or constipation. Too much importance\r\nhas been attached to it. In hypochondriacs spermatorrhea becomes a\r\nbugbear, which often makes them the dupes of charlatans. The less\r\nattention is paid to it the quicker it disappears; especially when it\r\nis of purely nervous origin, as is usually the case.\r\n\r\nPhimosis, or narrowness of the opening of the prepuce is nearly always\r\nof embryonic origin. It prevents the glans penis from becoming\r\nexposed, at least during erection. It is a very common condition and\r\nvery disagreeable. If the prepuce is forcibly drawn back behind the\r\nglans penis before erection, as is often the case in masturbation, the\r\npenis is gripped by the prepuce so that it cannot sometimes be drawn\r\nforward and inflammation with oedema results; this condition is called\r\n_paraphimosis_, and may become dangerous. Secretions, urine and semen\r\naccumulate and decompose in a phimosed prepuce, cause irritation and\r\nlead to masturbation. All cases of phimosis should be operated upon in\r\ninfancy, by complete or partial circumcision.\r\n\r\nIn women, the number of diseases which prevent conception is much\r\ngreater than in man. The ovary may undergo cystic degeneration or\r\nbecome the seat of a tumor; but affections of the uterus and vagina\r\ncause more sterility than ovarian affections. This results chiefly\r\nfrom catarrh and inflammation which destroy the spermatozoa before\r\nthey can reach the egg during its descent. Disorders of menstruation\r\nhave much less influence on fecundity. The womb sometimes remains in\r\nan _infantile state_, which may also cause sterility. Other diseases\r\nof the female sexual organs have a more general pathological\r\ncharacter and hardly influence sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\nA method of rendering women sterile without castration (removal of the\r\novaries) consists in interrupting the communication between the\r\novaries and the womb by dislocation of the Fallopian tubes: this\r\navoids all the evil effects of castration.\r\n\r\nCertain inflammations and displacements of the uterus and ovaries are\r\noften the origin of pains, indispositions and nervous disorders in\r\nwomen. Irregularity and pain in menstruation are a frequent cause of\r\nneuroticism.\r\n\r\nThe hymen is seldom so strongly developed as to offer a serious\r\nobstacle to coitus; but when this occurs it may be removed by a slight\r\noperation. Young women often suffer from vaginismus, or painful spasms\r\noccurring when an object, such as the finger or penis, is introduced\r\ninto the vagina.\r\n\r\nHermaphrodism in man is always pathological, extremely rare, and when\r\nit exists nearly always incomplete. These cases are generally\r\nincomplete mixtures concerning principally the correlative characters.\r\nA double function only exists in legends. I have myself seen a\r\ncelebrated hermaphrodite named Catherine Hohmann who had a well-formed\r\ntesticle on the left side enclosed in a fold of skin which resembled\r\nthe larger lip of the vulva, while the penis was very short and\r\nresembled a clitoris. This individual, who was baptized as a woman,\r\nwas certainly male on one side; on the other hand, the feminine nature\r\nwas more than problematical. Menstruation was alleged to have occurred\r\nbut was not established with certainty, any more than an ovary or\r\nuterus.\r\n\r\nMuch more frequent are inverted correlative sexual characters, such as\r\nbearded women, men with breasts; also mental sexual inversions, of\r\nwhich we shall speak later.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENEREAL DISEASES[5]\r\n\r\nWe cannot give here a complete description of the venereal diseases,\r\nwhich constitute a terrible evil for humanity, by bringing a great\r\ndeal of misfortunes and decadence into family and social life. Let us\r\nfirst point out the common error which attributes to sexual excess the\r\nevil effects which are really due to venereal disease. Although it may\r\nbe uncommon, one may be infected by these diseases after an innocent\r\nkiss, a cut finger, by sitting on a privy contaminated by a person\r\nsuffering from venereal disease, by the use of contaminated linen,\r\netc., etc. A pachydermatous Don Juan, on the contrary, may abandon\r\nhimself to the wildest sexual excess without being infected, if he is\r\nprudent and has good luck. On the other hand, young men may be\r\ninfected after having been with a prostitute only once in their lives,\r\nand thus ruin their whole existence.\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of venereal disease, which we will describe in a\r\nfew words. To these may be added certain parasites, such as crab-lice\r\nand the itch, which are easily communicated by sexual intercourse with\r\ninfected persons, but also in other ways.\r\n\r\n=Gonorrhea or Clap.=--This disease consists in a purulent inflammation\r\nof the urethra caused by a microbe called the _gonococcus_. When\r\ntreated properly it may be cured in a few weeks, but very often the\r\ninflammation becomes chronic and attacks the neighboring organs.\r\nChronic clap, or \"morning-drop,\" may lead in the male to permanent\r\nstricture of the urethra, which in turn may produce retention of\r\nurine, catarrh of the bladder and disease of the kidneys, which may be\r\nfatal. One attack of gonorrhea in no way protects against a second\r\ninfection, but rather predisposes to it, and when this disease becomes\r\nchronic exacerbations or relapses of the acute stage often occur\r\nwithout fresh infection.\r\n\r\nIn women the results of gonorrhea are, if possible, still worse than\r\nin men, because it is more difficult to cure. A prostitute affected\r\nwith gonorrhea may infect an enormous number of men, and in this case\r\nmedical inspection of brothels is no guarantee. The gonococci are\r\nconcealed in all the corners and folds of the internal genital organs\r\nof woman, where they set up inflammation of the womb, the Fallopian\r\ntubes and even the ovaries, which may lead to adhesions between the\r\nabdominal organs. Women affected with chronic gonorrhea generally\r\nbecome sterile. When the womb and the ovaries are affected there is\r\nmuch suffering and the woman may be confined to bed for some years.\r\nStricture of the urethra and inflammation of the bladder are more rare\r\nin women than in men, as the result of gonorrhea.\r\n\r\nBut gonorrhea is not confined to the adults of both sexes. The\r\ninnocent child, who at birth has to pass through its mother's vulva,\r\nwhen this is affected with gonorrhea, undergoes a baptism of gonococci\r\nwhich attack the conjunctiva of the eyes and set up a severe purulent\r\ninflammation, called ophthalmia of the newly born (_ophthalmia\r\nneonatorum_). This is one of the chief causes of total blindness, and\r\nif the child is not entirely blind, there are often large white\r\npatches left on the cornea which considerably interfere with sight.\r\nGonorrheal ophthalmia may also occur in adults by conveying pus from\r\nthe urethra to the eyes by the fingers.\r\n\r\n=Syphilis.=--This disease is still more formidable than gonorrhea. It\r\nis caused by a microbe which has been recently discovered (_Spirochæta\r\npallida_). Syphilis is much more chronic than gonorrhea and commences\r\nwith a small sore indurated at its base and called the hard chancre.\r\nThis is situated on the genital organs or elsewhere; in the mouth, for\r\ninstance, when this has been in contact with the buccal or genital\r\norgans of a person infected with syphilis. The syphilitic poison\r\nspreads through the body by means of the blood and lymph. At the end\r\nof a few weeks eruptions appear on the body and face, and then\r\ncommences a series of disasters the cause of which may be suspended\r\nover the victim for his whole life, like the sword of Damocles, even\r\nwhen he believes himself cured; for the cure of syphilis is often\r\nuncertain. This disease may remain latent for months and years, to\r\nreappear later on in different organs and cause fresh lesions.\r\n\r\nSyphilis causes ulcers of the skin and mucous membranes; it sometimes\r\ncauses decay of the bones; it may cause disease of the internal\r\norgans, such as the liver and lungs; it affects the walls of the blood\r\nvessels, causing them to become hard and brittle (atheroma); it causes\r\ndisease of the eyes, especially of the iris and retina, tumors (or\r\ngummata) in the brain, paralysis etc. In fact, it spares none of the\r\norgans of the body.\r\n\r\nAmong the most terrible results of syphilis we must mention _locomotor\r\nataxy_ (sclerosis of the posterior columns of the spinal cord), with\r\nits lightning pains and paralysis of the legs and arms; also _general\r\nparalysis of the insane_, which by causing gradual atrophy of the\r\nbrain, destroys one after the other, sensations, movements and all the\r\nmental faculties. These two diseases, which are so common at the\r\npresent day, only occur in old syphilitics, five to twenty years, or\r\nmore often ten to fifteen years after infection, and as a rule in\r\npersons who think they have been completely cured. Both these diseases\r\nare fatal. Before causing death, locomotor ataxy causes intolerable\r\npain for several years. General paralysis first gives rise to\r\ngrandiose ideas, and after disintegrating the human personality bit by\r\nbit, ends by transforming the individual into a being much inferior to\r\nanimals, and of an aspect as miserable as it is repulsive. A general\r\nparalytic in his last stage is little more than a vegetating ruin, in\r\nwhom the nervous activities are decomposed little by little, after the\r\ngradual disappearance of all the mental faculties. This is the result\r\nof slow atrophy of the brain and gradual destruction of its\r\nmicroscopic elements, or _neurones_.\r\n\r\nThe early stages of syphilis may easily pass unnoticed owing to their\r\npartly latent and completely painless character. Small eruptions may\r\nbe mistaken for other affections, and mercurial treatment generally\r\ndisperses the symptoms of _primary_ and _secondary_ syphilis. But\r\nsyphilitics who are apparently cured are never safe from being\r\nattacked, after perhaps many years, with locomotor ataxy, general\r\nparalysis or the _tertiary_ or _quaternary_ manifestations of\r\nsyphilis, such as disease of the bones, internal organs, eyes, brain,\r\netc. The sores of the first two or three years of syphilis are\r\ncontagious but painless, and hence do not prevent coitus when they\r\noccur in the genitals. After three years syphilis becomes less\r\ncontagious, but there is no definite time limit and cases have been\r\nrecorded in which contagious lesions occurred ten or fifteen years\r\nafter the onset of the disease.\r\n\r\nA syphilitic man may transmit the disease to his children without\r\ninfecting his wife, and these children may die before birth or may be\r\nborn with congenital syphilis. This is due to the spermatozoa being\r\ninfected with syphilis. However, this is fortunately not always the\r\ncase, for many cured syphilitics have healthy children. A child\r\naffected with congenital syphilis (from the father) may infect the\r\nmother during pregnancy; this is called \"syphilis by conception.\"\r\nCongenital syphilis may also cause locomotor ataxy and general\r\nparalysis.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to enumerate all the infirmities which syphilis in the\r\nparents may transmit to the children. Syphilis often renders marriage\r\nsterile. It is more frequent in men than in women, because the number\r\nof prostitutes is small compared with the number of men who go with\r\nthem; a single prostitute may contaminate a whole regiment. On their\r\npart, the clients of prostitutes convey gonorrhea and syphilis to\r\ntheir wives, thus spreading in society this abominable plague and all\r\nthe evils resulting from it.\r\n\r\n=Soft Chancre.=--The third kind of venereal disease is the soft\r\nchancre, thus called in distinction to hard chancre, which is the\r\nprimary sore of syphilis. Soft chancre is the least dangerous and the\r\nleast common of the three diseases. It consists of an ulcer which\r\nremains localized to the genital organs (unless it is complicated with\r\nsyphilis, which is frequent). The ulcerated parts are destroyed, but\r\nthe sore heals generally without trouble.\r\n\r\nVenereal diseases constitute one of the worst satellites of the sexual\r\nappetite. If men were not so ignorant and careless, it would be on the\r\nwhole easy to avoid them and cause their gradual disappearance. One of\r\nthe most absurd and infamous organizations which can be imagined is\r\nthat of the State regulation of prostitution which, under the pretext\r\nof hygiene, compels prostitutes to be registered by the police or to\r\nlive in brothels. They then undergo regular medical examination, the\r\nobject of which is to prevent those who are diseased from practicing\r\ntheir trade, and compel them to be treated in hospital. We shall see\r\nlater on that this system absolutely fails in its object, for the\r\nsimple reason that the treatment of venereal diseases is by no means\r\nthe panacea which many people imagine.\r\n\r\nThe first attack of gonorrhea in man is very often spontaneously\r\ncured, while unskillful treatment often aggravates it. The relapses of\r\nthis disease, on the other hand, especially in their chronic form,\r\noften resist all kinds of treatment and sometimes become incurable.\r\nThe gonococci become hidden in the folds of the deep parts of the\r\nmucous membrane, both in men and women, and cannot all be destroyed.\r\nWith regard to syphilis, mercurial treatment, although remarkable in\r\nits immediate effect, requires prolonged administration. And it is by\r\nsuch means that it is proposed to make prostitutes clean! There is\r\nonly one radical cure for venereal diseases; that is not to contract\r\nthem! However, this does not prevent us from recommending all those\r\nwho are affected with them to seek immediate treatment by a skilled\r\nspecialist.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to see ladies of high position defending such barbarous\r\ninstitutions as proxenetism (the business of keeping brothels) and the\r\nregulation of prostitution, imagining that they thereby protect their\r\ndaughters against seduction. Such aberration can only be explained by\r\nsuggestive influence on the part of men. Among men, and especially\r\namong many physicians, the belief in the efficacy of regulation\r\ndepends on a mixture of blind routine, faith in authority and want of\r\njudgment, combined perhaps with more or less unconscious eroticism. We\r\nshall consider this point in detail later on.\r\n\r\nOne of the most tragic effects of venereal disease is the\r\ncontamination of an innocent wife, whose whole life, hitherto chaste\r\nand pure, becomes brutally deprived of its fruits, and whose dreams of\r\nthe ideal and hopes of happiness become swamped in the mire with which\r\nprostitution has contaminated her. Is it surprising that love in such\r\ncases becomes replaced by bitterness and despair? Some modern authors,\r\nsuch as Brieux (_Les Avariés_) and André Couvreur (_La Graine_), have\r\npictured in their dramas and novels the tragic effects of venereal\r\ndisease and heredity in the family, as well as their social\r\nconsequences. What is deplorable, is the enormous proportion of\r\npersons who are infected with venereal diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEXUAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nWith the exception of what is called sexual inversion and pathological\r\nlove of the insane, sexual psychopathology (_i.e._, sexual pathology\r\nof mind) is chiefly limited to the domain of the sexual appetite, and\r\noriginates mainly in fetichism (see Chapter V), to which it is closely\r\nallied. Let us first examine certain anomalies which partly concern\r\nthe lower nervous functions.\r\n\r\nFirst of all a general question presents itself. Hereditary or\r\ncongenital sexual anomalies have been distinguished from those which\r\nare said to result from vicious habits. Krafft-Ebing, in his\r\ncelebrated book which we have already quoted, makes a capital\r\ndifference between these two causes, and stigmatizes the acquired\r\nvices with great indignation. I do not deny that there is reason for\r\nthe distinction, but we must take exception to two fundamental errors\r\nin the manner in which the facts are presented.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the difference between hereditary and acquired\r\nsexual anomalies is only relative and gradual, so that it is necessary\r\nto avoid opposing one against the other. When an anomaly arrives\r\nspontaneously in the first sexual glimmer of the child's mind during\r\nits development, it is obvious that it is the expression of a profound\r\nhereditary taint, the result of blastophthoria or of unfortunate\r\ncombinations of ancestral energies which have been associated by the\r\nconjugation of the two procreative germs. In such a case it is\r\ncomparatively easy to prove that this is a pathological symptom\r\nindependent of the will of the individual. But a continuous series of\r\ndegrees in the intensity of a hereditary predisposition to a certain\r\nsexual anomaly, or to other anomalies or peculiarities apt to provoke\r\nthis anomaly, insensibly connects the purely hereditary pathological\r\nappetite with that which is simply the effect of acquired vicious\r\nhabits. In this way a strong hereditary predisposition may exaggerate\r\na moderate normal sexual appetite, or may give it a pathological\r\ndirection under influences which would have had no effect in a less\r\npredisposed individual. Again, a slightly marked tendency to\r\nhomosexuality in a man may increase under the seductive influence of a\r\npassionate invert, when the same individual would have lost this\r\ntendency if he had fallen seriously in love with a woman. On the other\r\nhand, the invert would have no influence on an individual who was not\r\npredisposed.\r\n\r\nIf the hereditary disposition is very strong, it is developed\r\nspontaneously or under the influence of very slight circumstances. If\r\nit is mediocre, it may remain latent and even become extinct when\r\nfavorable circumstances do not awaken it. When it is entirely absent\r\nthe most powerful seduction and the most evil influence cannot give\r\nrise to the corresponding anomaly. These facts are sufficient to show\r\nwhat abuse is made of the term _acquired vice_. Under this heading are\r\ndesignated a number of peculiarities the roots of which are to a great\r\nextent contained in the germ of heredity.\r\n\r\nThe power of words on the human mind produces antinomies which do not\r\nreally exist; such is the case with the terms _vice_ and _disease_.\r\nVices depend on a hereditary mnemic disposition, of varying strength\r\nand more or less pathological, or at any rate unilateral (_i.e._,\r\ndeveloped in one direction only, or connected with a single group of\r\nobjects); according to the good or evil influence of the environment\r\nthey may develop, become limited or even fail to appear. Inversely, we\r\nmay say that many diseases, especially of the brain, are the source of\r\nvices.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, it follows from this fundamental principle, that\r\nthe vicious and apparently acquired conduct of certain individuals\r\nshould not be considered as the product of perverted free will, but\r\nrather as the unfortunate and destructive result of a bad hereditary\r\ndisposition developed under the influence of the bad habits of a\r\ncorrupt environment. This environment being itself composed of men,\r\nthere is a vicious circle of cause and effect which will not escape\r\nthe mind of the thoughtful reader. Bad habits are made by hereditary\r\nforces, and bad habits develop in their turn by custom, and may even\r\ncreate, by blastophthoria, vicious hereditary dispositions. The\r\nindignation of the moralists who condemn vicious persons are very like\r\nthe temper of a child who strikes the fire which burnt him.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFLEX ANOMALIES\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned vaginismus, which is often produced in women\r\nby the first coitus. Priapism in man is somewhat analogous to\r\nvaginismus. It is produced by an exaggerated reflex irritability of\r\nthe nerve centers for erection, and results in continual and painful\r\nerections, which sometimes end in ejaculation without sensation.\r\nAnother anomaly, more or less reflex and very frequent, produces\r\nvoluptuous sensations and premature ejaculation after short and\r\nincomplete erections. In some nervous women also, the venereal orgasm\r\noccurs very rapidly and briefly. These anomalies belong to the domain\r\nof medicine and are of little importance for our subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nPSYCHIC IMPOTENCE\r\n\r\nPsychic impotence is a symptom which occurs accidentally in the normal\r\nstate and very frequently in psychopathological conditions.\r\n\r\nA representation or idea of any kind, may suddenly paralyze by\r\nsuggestive action the normal reflex mechanism of the center for\r\nerection. The blood ceases to accumulate in the corpora cavernosa and\r\nerection is either arrested or not produced at all. For example, a\r\nvery excited lover, who has had strong erections at the moment when he\r\nprepared to copulate, may be suddenly overcome with the idea that he\r\nwill fail, or by some other thought which paralyzes erection and\r\nrenders coitus impossible. The remembrance of such a failure and the\r\ndistress and shame attached to it, even efforts to produce erection\r\nindirectly for another attempt, constitute further causes of\r\ninhibition of the cerebro-spinal activity; they temporarily extinguish\r\nthe sexual appetite, and prevent by their interference the automatic\r\nmechanism of erection which they strive to produce. The greater the\r\nfear of failure, the more the psychic impotence increases. This\r\nphenomenon may be limited to a certain woman, but it is more often\r\ngeneral. Sometimes an incomplete erection is produced, which is\r\ninsufficient.\r\n\r\nThis condition, which depends on auto-suggestion, is best treated by\r\nhypnotic suggestion. The sentiment of impotence powerfully depresses a\r\nman, and the depression increases his impotence. This condition often,\r\nhowever, disappears by itself.\r\n\r\nA special variety of psychic impotence is that in which erection takes\r\nplace, but the idea of ejaculation predominates so much that it\r\nparalyzes the voluptuous sensations, and causes ejaculation to occur\r\nwithout pleasure, or even erection to cease.\r\n\r\nImpotence may occur at the first coitus, or may come on gradually. It\r\nis often produced suddenly at the time of marriage in persons who\r\nhave hitherto been very capable, even in Don Juans. Men may have\r\nnormal erections and pollutions, but these may be stopped by\r\ncounter-suggestions at each attempt at coitus. Habitual masturbation\r\nmay in some cases contribute to produce impotence, but we must not\r\ngeneralize from such cases, nor construct a dogma from them, for\r\ncontinence may also be a cause of impotence.\r\n\r\nAll these details, which are combined in all kinds of ways with other\r\nsexual troubles, but which are also produced alone in men who are\r\notherwise normal, throw much light on the relation of the momentary\r\nmental state of man to his sexual appetite and the accomplishment of\r\ncoitus.\r\n\r\nI do not know under what heading the following case should be placed:\r\n\r\n    A young man of steady habits, and normal sexual appetite, had\r\n    always abstained from sexual connection and masturbation. He\r\n    only had emissions during sleep. The latter were accompanied by\r\n    erotic dreams, but never produced an orgasm, while disagreeable\r\n    sensations occurred on waking. He married for love a woman in\r\n    whom the hymen was resistant, and vaginismus occurred on each\r\n    attempt at coitus. These attempts failed constantly in spite of\r\n    the most intense love and the most ardent desire for children on\r\n    both sides. The husband's erections were incomplete, and he\r\n    never had an ejaculation except when asleep. By the aid of\r\n    hypnotism I succeeded in strengthening his erections, and an\r\n    operation on the hymen cured his wife's vaginismus. The first\r\n    attempts at coitus were not immediately successful, but\r\n    suggestion acted after a time; finally the attempts were crowned\r\n    with success, and followed by a first and second pregnancy. The\r\n    children were healthy.\r\n\r\n    In this case, the impotence, which had lasted about eighteen\r\n    months, did not affect the mutual love and respect of the\r\n    couple, because the husband's affection combined with his sexual\r\n    appetite had sufficed for the happiness of a woman who was on\r\n    the whole normal.\r\n\r\nThis case is very instructive in several ways, for it gives a good\r\nexample of the nature of the sexual instinct in woman; it also shows\r\nhow the auto-suggestion of emissions occurring only during sleep may\r\nhinder copulation in the waking state. But such phenomena are\r\nextremely rare.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that there is no true impotence in\r\nwoman; but the same mental paralysis may occur as in man, preventing\r\norgasm and often causing disgust.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEXUAL PARADOXY\r\n\r\nBy this term is understood the appearance of the sexual appetite, or\r\neven of love, at an abnormal age. Infantile paradoxy is, however, very\r\ndifferent to senile paradoxy.\r\n\r\nInfantile paradoxy must not be confounded with certain forms of\r\nmasturbation, to which we shall return. Some races, especially in the\r\ntropics, have a much earlier sexual development than others; depending\r\nmore on race than climate. In some, sexual maturity occurs in boys\r\nbetween the age of twelve and fourteen, and in girls between nine and\r\nten years, while in others the former are hardly mature at twenty and\r\nthe latter before seventeen or eighteen. Again, individual variations\r\nmay be very great in the same race. But, owing to hereditary\r\nsatyriasis or nymphomania, we sometimes in our own country see sexual\r\nappetite appear in children of eight, seven, or even three or four\r\nyears of age, in a spontaneous manner without any external excitation.\r\nLombroso mentions the case of a girl three years old who had an\r\nirresistible tendency to onanism. I have myself observed the two\r\nfollowing cases:\r\n\r\n    (1). A boy of seven years, the son of a brothel keeper, and a\r\n    kind of satyr who committed great excesses, began spontaneously\r\n    to attack little girls of his own age or even younger. He was so\r\n    artful that all means failed in curing him of this habit, and he\r\n    was sent to an asylum of which I was superintendent. He then\r\n    tried to renew his exploits with a boy older than himself. He\r\n    was also idle and disposed to all kinds of folly. He did not,\r\n    however, attempt to copulate with adult women or men. His sexual\r\n    organs were absolutely infantile, without any abnormal\r\n    development. His paradoxy was thus of cerebral origin.\r\n\r\n    (2). _A girl of nine years was brought to my office addicted to\r\n    self-abuse. Upon examination, I found this child highly\r\n    neurotic, the major part of her life had been under unhygienic\r\n    atmosphere, case history, father psychopathic, had been in an\r\n    insane asylum, mother ænemic. The child was sent to a state\r\n    institution for girls and improved remarkably._\r\n\r\nIn this case I was told that there was no hereditary taint, but such\r\nstatements prove nothing. Individuals of this kind generally become\r\ncriminals, or else give themselves up to masturbation or prostitution.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, the sexual appetite may be preserved for a long time in\r\nold men, or reappear for a time, with or without sexual power, but as\r\na rule, the paradoxy of old men is the initial symptom of _senile\r\ndementia_. As this disorder is only commencing when sexual excitation\r\noccurs, it is not noticed, and the patient is regarded as an immoral,\r\nvicious or criminal individual. I have seen a patient of this kind\r\nmasturbate openly in an asylum, so great was his sexual excitation.\r\n\r\nIn most old men affected with senile sexual paradoxy, the sexual\r\nappetite is directed toward very young girls or even children, which\r\naggravates their case from the legal point of view. Very often this\r\nappetite is perverted and assumes one of the forms we shall speak of\r\nlater. Some of these old men are still capable, but others are not,\r\nand then their excitation only manifests itself in manipulations of\r\nthe genital organs, etc. Such cases play a considerable part in law\r\nscandals. The patient (for so he must be called) often becomes the\r\nvictim of blackmail on the part of vicious girls or children, incited\r\nby unnatural parents. One often sees also, at the onset of senile\r\ndementia, an old man become enamored of some prostitute or adventuress\r\nwho makes him marry her and thus takes possession of his fortune. The\r\nlaw generally makes the matter valid, under the pretext that\r\nindividual liberty must be respected. Such sanction consists in\r\nreality in sacrificing a patient for the profit of a female swindler.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEXUAL ANÆSTHESIA OR CONGENITAL ABSENCE OF THE SEXUAL SENSE AND\r\nAPPETITE\r\n\r\nSexual sensations are so intimately connected with the sexual appetite\r\nthat it is difficult to separate them. No doubt in the adult a certain\r\ndegree of sexual appetite may exist without any voluptuous sensation,\r\nbut this is a secondary phenomenon.\r\n\r\nComplete sexual anæsthesia is very rare in man; it is not a special\r\nform of anomaly, but the reduction to zero of a normal sensation and\r\nthe appetite which corresponds to it. The characteristic feature of\r\nthese cases is that, contrary to what occurs in eunuchs and\r\ncryptorchids, not only the testicles, but all the correlative sexual\r\nattributes (the beard, voice, character, etc.) are normally developed,\r\nand are in no way inverted as in homosexual individuals. Sexual\r\nanæsthesia causes no more suffering than color-blindness, but like the\r\nlatter it occasions individual troubles resulting from misunderstanding.\r\nThe sexual anæsthetic, having a more or less false idea of marriage,\r\noften marries in complete ignorance, and the results are then\r\ndisastrous, thanks to our laws and customs.\r\n\r\nIn women, sexual anæsthesia is very common. Krafft-Ebing is wrong in\r\nmaintaining that in all such cases the women are always neurotic. A\r\nnumber of absolutely normal and intelligent women remain all their\r\nlife completely cold from the sexual point of view, apart from the\r\nnormally passive character of the female sex in coitus. It is rather\r\nthe very libidinous woman who is pathological.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the normal sexual sentiment of woman is developed\r\nrather in the direction of love, and desire for children. Erotic men\r\noften complain of the sexual coldness of their wives, which is\r\ndisagreeable to them; for pleasure in one sex excites and completes\r\nthat of the other. Cold women submit to coitus as a duty, or at any\r\nrate only mentally enjoy their husband's caresses.\r\n\r\nSexual anæsthesia occurs normally in old age. It may occur at an\r\nearlier age, owing to destruction or atrophy of the sexual glands,\r\ngreat excesses, or on the contrary, extreme continence. Certain\r\ndiseases and psychoses may also cause it.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few examples of sexual anæsthesia:\r\n\r\n    (1). A normally built man, of high culture and moral sense, was\r\n    affected with complete sexual anæsthesia since birth. He\r\n    occasionally had nocturnal emissions, and also matutinal\r\n    erections, but no erotic images. When he arrived at mature age\r\n    he had no idea of sexual intercourse, and was completely\r\n    indifferent to everything concerning sexuality. He did not even\r\n    comprehend anything relating to sexual affairs, and his replies\r\n    reminded me of conversations with color-blind persons on the\r\n    distinction between red and green! According to his ideas,\r\n    marriage was an intellectual and sentimental union in which\r\n    children came by themselves!\r\n\r\n    He eventually married a young girl, well educated but extremely\r\n    prudish. One can imagine the revelations which followed! The\r\n    wife, who had a strong desire for children, soon perceived the\r\n    sexual blindness of her husband. She became very unhappy and\r\n    bitterly reproached him. The husband then became aware that\r\n    there should be something in marriage which he had not taken\r\n    into account; but the explanations of coitus by the medical man\r\n    were useless, and hypnotic suggestion was incapable of producing\r\n    the least sexual sensation.\r\n\r\n    In spite of all this, the husband was full of respect and\r\n    affection for his wife, but was incapable of simulating the\r\n    least sexual appetite. As regards the wife, what she required\r\n    was not coitus, which was simply a means to an end, but\r\n    children. However, her prudery made her prefer this state of\r\n    things to a divorce, which would create scandal. We may notice\r\n    that in such cases erections are only produced mechanically\r\n    during sleep, which renders coitus impossible.\r\n\r\n    (2). A timid but vain young man of retiring habits, sexually\r\n    cold, had occasional nocturnal emissions sometimes accompanied\r\n    by slightly erotic dreams. Although better informed than the\r\n    preceding case on sexual relations, his sexual appetite was\r\n    almost entirely absent, and he regarded marriage as a purely\r\n    intellectual alliance. He married an intelligent and passionate\r\n    young girl whose sexual appetite was strongly developed, and at\r\n    once began to treat her with great coldness, as a kind of\r\n    domestic servant.\r\n\r\n    The wife's family were in favor of divorce, but having pity on\r\n    the husband, sent him to me for advice. I explained the matter\r\n    to him, made him understand that the fault was entirely on his\r\n    side, and that his first duty was to show affection for his\r\n    wife, or if not, to accept divorce. The effect was purely\r\n    psychical, and from this moment he became amiable and\r\n    affectionate toward his wife. This was sufficient to cause the\r\n    wife to give up the idea of divorce. I then told her that, on\r\n    account of her husband's timidity and anomaly, the only thing to\r\n    do was to reverse their roles, and for her to make the sexual\r\n    advances. I have not heard anything more from this singular\r\n    couple.\r\n\r\n    (3). A young man who had never had sexual connection before\r\n    marriage, in spite of a strong sexual appetite, made the\r\n    acquaintance of an intelligent young girl of excellent\r\n    character. Marriage followed, and the wife was loyal to her\r\n    husband, but remained sexually cold. She was insensible to\r\n    coitus and only regarded it as a disagreeable complement of\r\n    love. In spite of this she was fond of caresses, devoted to her\r\n    husband, and had several children.\r\n\r\n    (4). An intelligent and cultured man, normal from the sexual\r\n    point of view, who had frequented prostitutes in his youth, but\r\n    not excessively, married a rather nervous but apparently very\r\n    amorous young woman. The marriage night produced on her the\r\n    effect of a cold douche, and coitus offended and horrified her.\r\n    The husband in his discomfiture took patience; but his love,\r\n    which was never very strong, became shattered. To avoid all\r\n    scandal each of the conjoints practiced dissimulation and\r\n    adapted themselves more or less to each other. The wife allowed\r\n    coitus, the husband tolerated her coldness. Several children\r\n    were born, but the family was unhappy, and after a few years\r\n    divorce put an end to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEXUAL HYPERÆSTHESIA, OR EXAGGERATION OF THE SEXUAL APPETITE\r\n\r\nThis anomaly may be congenital, for example, in the sexual paradoxy of\r\nchildren. Every one knows the Don Juans and Messalinas with their\r\ninsatiable appetites. These types of sexual hyperæsthesia are\r\ncertainly less frequent and more abnormal in women than in men, but\r\nthe intensity is as great or greater.\r\n\r\nSexual hyperæsthesia manifests itself by desires excited by every\r\nsensorial perception relating to the opposite sex, or simply by\r\nobjects which recall it to the imagination; so that fetichism plays a\r\ngreat part in this condition. The feeling of satiety is hardly\r\nexperienced at all, or only for a short time after each orgasm.\r\nNymphomaniacs and satyrs are possessed by an insatiable sexual desire,\r\noften associated with certain sensations of anguish. This\r\nhyperæsthesia, even when it is not hereditary, may be developed up to\r\na certain point by continued or repeated artificial excitations.\r\n\r\nIn women it is during or after menstruation that the sexual appetite\r\nand consequently sexual hyperæsthesia are generally strongest, but\r\nthere are many individual variations in this respect, and sometimes\r\nthe opposite occurs.\r\n\r\nThe effect of sexual hyperæsthesia is to direct the appetite toward\r\nany object capable of satisfying it. When the other sex is wanting,\r\nmasturbation is generally resorted to. All mucous membranes (anus,\r\nmouth, etc.) and even inanimate objects may serve to satisfy the\r\npathologically exalted appetite of such individuals. Men most\r\ndistinguished in other respects may abandon themselves to the most\r\nfoolish or abominable practices.\r\n\r\n_Animals are often used to satisfy the hyperæsthetic sexual appetite\r\nin both sexes. The healthy woman is not prone to such desires, unless\r\nof psychopathic taint. Men visit prostitutes, and become excited at\r\nthe sight of every woman who is neither too old nor too repulsive.\r\nSome individuals of this kind are pursued night and day by erotic\r\nimages, which may even become an obsession and a veritable torment._\r\n\r\nA further degree of sexual hyperæsthesia is called _Satyriasis_ in\r\nman, and _nymphomania_ in woman. I have observed in women two very\r\ndifferent varieties of sexual hyperæsthesia. In one, true nymphomania,\r\nthe subjects are attracted toward man bodily and mentally with an\r\nelementary force; in these the whole brain follows the appetite in\r\nquite a feminine manner. Other women, on the contrary, are driven to\r\nmasturbation by a purely peripheral excitation; they have erotic\r\ndreams with venereal orgasms which torment rather than please them;\r\nbut they do not fall in love easily, and may have difficulty in the\r\nchoice of a husband. Their mind alone remains feminine, full of tact\r\nand delicacy in its sentiments, while their lower nerve centers react\r\nin a more masculine and at the same time more pathological manner.\r\nThere are many transitional forms between these two extremes.\r\n\r\nSexual hyperæsthetics are often unhappy, and consult the physician for\r\nrelief from the perpetual excitation which torments them. They attempt\r\nto master themselves and check their appetite in all ways, and are\r\nsometimes affected with nervous or mental depression. It is important,\r\nhowever, to recognize the fact, that many sexual hyperæsthetics remain\r\nquite fresh and active, and attain an advanced age, provided they\r\nescape alcohol and venereal disease.\r\n\r\nWhen sexual hyperæsthesia results chiefly from artificially acquired\r\nhabits it may often be cured by hypnotic suggestion, and establishing\r\nself-control; but when it is hereditary and very intense, and\r\nespecially when it is connected with infantile paradoxy or other\r\nanomalies, castration may be the only efficient remedy. When it is\r\nchiefly acquired, any strong diversion which turns the mind from\r\nsexual preoccupation to other subjects may have an excellent curative\r\neffect. The most intense hereditary cases may constitute a plague for\r\nthe individual and for society, and it is then that castration may\r\nbecome a blessing by calming the obsessed patient, by giving him the\r\nopportunity for useful occupation, and by preventing him from abusing\r\nhis fellows and procreating beings similar to himself.\r\n\r\nNymphomaniacs often have polyandrous instincts, and they then become\r\nmore insatiable than men. Several cases of this kind have been\r\npublished in the press, and examples of such women are not rare in\r\nhistory. When a woman is possessed by passion she often loses all\r\nsense of shame, all moral sense and all discretion, as regards the\r\nobject of her desires. She pays no attention to anything which is\r\nopposed to her passion, but may be full of reserve, tact and\r\ngood-feeling in all other respects. Cases of this kind, however, have\r\nalways a more or less marked pathological character.\r\n\r\nIn man, satyriasis is very frequent. It often happens that a husband\r\ncontinually forces his wife to coitus, even during menstruation. We\r\nhave mentioned already the case of an old peasant of seventy who thus\r\nabused his poor old wife. In such cases conjugal infidelity very\r\ncommonly occurs. The cynicism of such individuals may go so far that\r\nthey have intercourse with prostitutes or servants in the presence of\r\ntheir wives, or even abuse their own children. The wife behaves in\r\nthese cases in different ways according to her character. Many\r\ntolerate everything and do not complain, for the sake of their\r\nchildren; others leave the husband or divorce him; some commit\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\nIt would seem quite natural for nymphomaniacs to marry satyrs, but we\r\nmust bear in mind the evil results for posterity from such an\r\naccumulation of the sexual appetite.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASTURBATION OR ONANISM\r\n\r\nThe term onanism is derived from the name of Onan, son of Juda and\r\nSuah and grandson of Israel. According to the Old Testament, Onan's\r\nfather wished him to marry his brother's widow and have children by\r\nher; but this did not please Onan, and he provoked ejaculation of\r\nsemen by friction, in order to avoid having children by his\r\nsister-in-law. \"This offended God who slew him.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already shown that in the child the sexual appetite manifests\r\nitself in a kind of obscure presentiment and vague sensations in the\r\ngenital organs. If a young man cannot satisfy his sexual appetite\r\nnaturally, the latter when it increases in strength provokes erotic\r\ndreams and nocturnal emissions; or artificial excitation of the penis\r\nmay be practiced to produce orgasms: the latter phenomenon is called\r\n_masturbation_.\r\n\r\nMasturbation in man is performed by friction of the penis with the\r\nhand or against some soft body. In the latter case especially erotic\r\nimages of naked women or female sexual organs is associated with\r\nonanism. This kind of masturbation may be called _compensatory_,\r\nbecause it does not depend on an anomaly of the sexual appetite, but\r\nserves to satisfy a natural want by compensation. There are a whole\r\nseries of manipulations employed for the same object, which constitute\r\nthe psychic equivalent of compensating masturbation. _In remote\r\ngarrisons and in boys' schools the more libidinous individuals,\r\nusually those mentally tainted, often practice mutual masturbation or\r\nsodomy. This is the sex complex of the degenerate individual and in an\r\neffort to exterminate these pathological manifestations, they are\r\nbeing penalized by law, throughout the civilized world. It is\r\nunnecessary to prolong this enumeration. Those we have mentioned are\r\nthe most common and it is agreed that men who are addicted to these\r\npractices are decidedly psychopathic, whether it may be caused by\r\nfaulty heredity or anomaly in the psychology of the individual, this\r\nstill remains to be proven. In reality they are often normal in other\r\nrespects, but simply affected with sexual hyperæsthesia. Sometimes\r\nthey are feeble-minded individuals who have recourse to such practices\r\nbecause they are derided by women. Others are cynics, more or less\r\nvicious in other respects._\r\n\r\nCompensatory masturbation is extremely widespread, but it is as a rule\r\nneither recognized nor admitted because it is easy to conceal.\r\nAlthough depressing for those whose will power is overcome by an\r\nexcitation which they cannot conquer, it is relatively the least\r\ndangerous form of onanism. At the most it leads to a certain amount of\r\nnervous and mental exhaustion by abuse of the facility of thus\r\nprocuring a venereal orgasm. The loss of substance from frequent\r\nseminal ejaculations is also more or less weakening, although the\r\nsecretion from the prostate plays a much greater part than the semen.\r\nBut what especially affects the nervous system, is the repeated loss\r\nof the will, and the failure of resolutions made many times to\r\novercome the desire for orgasm.\r\n\r\nHere, as elsewhere, effect is too often confounded with cause. Because\r\nmen of feeble will power are addicted to onanism, it is imagined that\r\nthe latter is the cause of the weakness of will. In itself, a seminal\r\nejaculation provoked by masturbation is no more dangerous than a\r\nnocturnal emission; both are often accompanied by nervous sensations\r\nwhich are more disagreeable and exhausting than normal coitus. I must,\r\nhowever, point out that the effects of moderate masturbation in the\r\nadult have been greatly exaggerated, either by confounding the effect\r\nwith its cause, or for mercenary objects, by driving timid persons to\r\ncharlatans or to prostitutes.\r\n\r\nThe active sexual appetite of man, increased by the accumulation of\r\nsemen, is absent in woman. She does not have nocturnal emissions\r\naccompanied by voluptuous sensations which spontaneously awaken sexual\r\ndesire. For this reason a pathological sexual excitability is\r\nnecessary to spontaneously provoke in woman voluptuous dreams or\r\nmasturbation. For the same reason we cannot speak of compensatory\r\nmasturbation in woman. Onanism, however, is not uncommon among women,\r\nalthough less frequent than in men. It results either from artificial\r\nand local excitations, from bad example, or from pathological\r\nhyperæsthesia. When once the habit is acquired, repetition is produced\r\nby the difficulty of resisting voluptuous desires.\r\n\r\nWomen perform masturbation by friction of the clitoris with the\r\nfinger, or by introducing various hard and rounded objects into the\r\nvagina and imitating the movements of coitus; often also by rubbing\r\nthe crossed thighs against each other. In the insane, masturbation is\r\nsometimes practiced to an excessive extent. Some hysterical women\r\nintroduce objects into the urethra during masturbation and cause\r\nsevere inflammation of the bladder.\r\n\r\nAnother variety of sexual excitation which is often substituted for\r\ncoitus among women, is the practice of mutual licking of the clitoris\r\nwith the tongue (_cunnilingus_). Although not so dangerous as has been\r\nmaintained, these habits are aberrations of the sexual appetite, and\r\nit is needless to say that every human being should abstain from them\r\nout of self-respect.\r\n\r\nThe man who, for some reason or another, cannot obtain normal coitus\r\nshould content himself with nocturnal emissions, and the woman with\r\nvoluptuous dreams, and should both abstain from active and voluntary\r\nexcitations. For my part, I consider prostitution, or \"love\" which is\r\nbought, as a variety of compensatory masturbation, and not as normal\r\ncopulation. Coitus with a prostitute, generally infected with venereal\r\ndisease, who receives new clients continually, has as little affinity\r\nwith love as with the normal object of the sexual appetite--reproduction;\r\nand its moral value is certainly inferior to that of onanism.\r\n\r\nA second form of masturbation occurs in very young children from\r\naccidental irritation; in boys from phimosis; in girls from itching\r\ndue to worms (oxyuris) about the anus and vulva. Innocent as regards\r\nits cause, this form of onanism may become dangerous by habit.\r\nAttention should therefore be paid to phimosis and worms, and the\r\nformer treated by circumcision and the latter by the usual remedies.\r\n\r\nA third kind of masturbation is caused by example and imitation. This\r\noften occurs in schools and among children in general; and in this way\r\nvery precocious sexual excitation may develop and become a habit\r\ndifficult to suppress. The onanism of young children is certainly\r\nworse than that which begins after puberty; it not only renders the\r\nchild idle and bashful, or increases these faults; but it also\r\ninterferes with nutrition and digestion and develops a tendency to\r\nsexual perversion and to impotence. It often ceases, however, after\r\ncareful supervision, combined with physical exercise and fresh air,\r\nand direction of the attention to other things. On the whole, the\r\ndanger of this form of onanism has also been exaggerated. In most\r\ncases it is cured, when it is not based on abnormal predispositions or\r\non an indolent and feeble character. Love and normal sexual\r\nintercourse are naturally the best remedies for masturbation due to\r\nseduction and habit, as soon as the subject has reached sexual\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nWe may include as a fourth form of masturbation the cases of paradoxy\r\nwhich we have mentioned previously. In this case onanism is produced\r\nspontaneously as the result of psycho-sexual precocity or hereditary\r\npathological satyriasis.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the last paradoxical form which is based on\r\nincurable satyriasis, all the kinds of onanism which we have mentioned\r\nhitherto can only be successfully treated by kindness and confidence,\r\ncombined with work and direction of the mind to wholesome and\r\nattractive subjects; not by threats or punishment. The new reformatory\r\nschools called _Landerziehungsheime_ (Vide Chapter XVII) are an\r\nexcellent remedy for onanism, for they keep the child occupied from\r\nmorning to night and hardly leave him any time for bad habits; when he\r\ngoes to bed he is too tired to do anything but sleep. However, great\r\nprudence and active supervision is required in these cases.\r\n\r\nThe fifth class is constituted by the onanism of sexual inverts, and\r\nmay be called _essential onanism_. This concerns men whose sexual\r\nappetite is directed toward their own sex instead of the other. They\r\nare called _homosexual_, and mutual onanism is, so to speak, the\r\nnormal satisfaction of their inverted appetite. We shall refer to this\r\nagain later on. While normal sexual intercourse is the best and most\r\nrational remedy for compensatory masturbation, there is no question of\r\nit here. Marriage is the worst and most scandalous remedy in such\r\ncases. It is therefore of the greatest importance in order to judge\r\nof the nature of the masturbation, to inquire into the kind of erotic\r\nimages with which it is associated. If, in the case of a man, the\r\nimages are those of women, it is simply a case of compensatory\r\nmasturbation; but if the images are masculine, it is a case of sexual\r\ninversion. If masturbation is not accompanied by any images, the\r\nquestion remains doubtful. In young children this is explained by the\r\nfact that the psycho-sexual irradiations are not yet developed; but\r\nafter puberty the absence of images as an object of eroticism suggests\r\na certain anomaly and sometimes depends on a latent tendency to\r\ninversion.\r\n\r\n=Relation of Masturbation to Hypochondriasis.=--Some onanists become\r\nmuch distressed, and reproach themselves for having spoilt their lives\r\nby their bad habit. They give way to lamentations before their doctor\r\nand their acquaintances, wring their hands with despair, and beg every\r\none to come to their aid. They look upon themselves as poor sinners\r\nwhose lives have been ruined, either by their own fault or by others.\r\nThey have read Lamert's \"Personal Preservation,\" or other sensational\r\nbooks which excite both the fear and the sexual desire of weak\r\ncharacters, whom they are intended to exploit. These poor devils\r\nbelieve themselves lost, and are truly pitiable objects. These form\r\nthe types which are paraded as terrible examples in books on onanism\r\nwhich make timid persons' hair stand on end.\r\n\r\nWhen these unfortunate onanists are questioned on all the\r\ncircumstances of the act of which they accuse themselves, we generally\r\narrive at the following results:\r\n\r\nWe recognize that we have to deal with psychopathic or neurotic\r\nsubjects more or less tainted by heredity, timid and shunning their\r\nfellows, easily impressed by imagination, possessed of unhealthy\r\nsentiments and ideas; in fact, hypochondriacs, predisposed to look\r\nupon every sensation or slight indisposition as a grave disorder\r\nthreatening their health or life. They thus live in perpetual anxiety.\r\nThis mental anomaly has for a long time preceded the onanism, even if\r\nthey have masturbated, which is often even not the case.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous patients of this kind that I have treated, there\r\nwere many who had simply had nocturnal emissions since puberty, but\r\nthey regarded themselves as lost men through masturbation! Many others\r\nno doubt practice compensatory masturbation, generally because their\r\ntimid nature prevents them from frequenting prostitutes, or committing\r\nother sexual excesses, while the way in which they analyze their\r\nsensations easily leads them to onanism. On the other hand, they are\r\ngenerally so afraid that they do not give way to excessive\r\nmasturbation, perhaps only once or twice a week or even less often, so\r\nthat the normal frequency of coitus, according to Luther, is often not\r\nattained and seldom exceeded. Among these persons we find few\r\nprecocious or excessive onanists. I admit, however, that a\r\nhypochondriacal constitution predisposes somewhat to onanism.\r\n\r\nBut, what I wish to lay stress upon, is that the onanists who are full\r\nof lamentation and self-reproach are neither the most numerous nor\r\nthose who commit the greatest excess. The worst onanists, those who\r\nprovoke several ejaculations daily, belong to the category of sexual\r\nhyperæsthetics. These have not the classical aspect attributed to them\r\nby tradition; they are not pale and terrified creatures, but rather\r\nlewd individuals who are early transformed into impudent Don Juans.\r\nThey may be as courageous, as clever and as strong as others and yet\r\nbe disposed to all kinds of evil tricks and follies. It is, therefore,\r\nnot true, as is so often said, that it is possible to recognize a\r\nmasturbator by his face or manner.\r\n\r\nThese excessive onanists no doubt do themselves harm in various ways,\r\nbut the great error of taking sexual hypochondriasis for the type of\r\nonanists, is to confound cause with effect. Sexual hypochondriasis is\r\nin no way the effect of onanism, but precedes it, and onanism is\r\nrather its effect, or is simply associated with it. It is obvious that\r\nonanism, by its depressing effect, aggravates a mind beset with\r\nhypochondriacal anxieties.\r\n\r\nIt results from these facts, first, that a sexual hypochondriac should\r\nbe treated as a hypochondriac and not as an onanist; secondly, that\r\nthe worst slaves of masturbation are not to be looked for among pale\r\nand dejected individuals.\r\n\r\nAmong women, especially young girls, hypochondriasis is not common and\r\ncases of sexual hypochondriacs who accuse themselves of masturbating\r\nare rare among them. Women who masturbate generally keep their secret\r\nand are apparently very little affected by it. However, onanism does\r\nthem nearly as much harm as men; it is true they have no loss of\r\nsemen, but the repetition and intensity of the nervous irritation are\r\ngreater than in man, and it is this which causes most exhaustion. In\r\nspite of this, it is curious to observe that women who masturbate are\r\ngenerally less ashamed than men, and are apparently less depressed by\r\nit. We must bear in mind that the loss of semen by masturbation has in\r\nman a peculiarly depressing effect, for it lacks its object and\r\nrepresents an absolutely abnormal satisfaction of the sexual appetite.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that this difference is due to another cause, that\r\nwomen who masturbate have less moral tone and are especially depraved\r\nindividuals. I agree that this is often the case, but far from always.\r\nThe intensity of the sexual excitability in women has nothing in\r\ncommon with their character; it may be associated with high\r\nintelligence, with high moral and æsthetic qualities, and even with a\r\nstrong will. On the other hand, deficiency in moral sense and will may\r\noccur with sexual frigidity, and, as we have already seen, may lead to\r\nsexual excess without any voluptuous sensation, in accordance with the\r\npeculiarities of feminine sentiment. These facts show how complex are\r\nthe causes of a given effect in the sexual domain.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERVERSIONS OF THE SEXUAL APPETITE OR PARÆSTHESIA OF THE SEXUAL\r\nSENSATION\r\n\r\nWe are here concerned with sexual appetite provoked by inadequate\r\nobjects. Krafft-Ebing having made a profound study of this question we\r\nshall follow his subdivisions in the main.\r\n\r\n=Perverted Sexual Appetite Directed Toward the Opposite Sex.=--(A.)\r\n_Sadism_ (association of sexual desire with cruelty and violence).\r\nHistory shows us a number of celebrated persons who satisfied their\r\nsexual desire by making martyrs of their victims, up to complete\r\nbutchery. The most atrocious types of this kind are perhaps assassins\r\nsuch as \"Jack the Ripper,\" who lie in wait for their victims like\r\ncats, pounce on them, revel in their terror, assassinate them by\r\ninches, and wallow voluptuously in their blood.\r\n\r\nThe term sadism is derived from the celebrated Marquis de Sade, a\r\nFrench author, whose obscene romances overflow with cruel\r\nvoluptuousness. Certain reminiscences of sadism are common both in man\r\nand woman. At the moment of highest excitation in coitus it is not\r\nuncommon for one or other of the couple to bite or scratch in the\r\necstasy of their amorous embraces. Lombroso remarks on the brutal\r\nexcesses of soldiers when excited after battle. This is so to speak an\r\ninversion of sadism as regards cause and effect. After the exaltation\r\nof combat, that of desire possesses the mind, as in the inverse\r\ndirection exaltation of desire gives rise in certain cases to that of\r\nviolence and thirst for blood.\r\n\r\nKrafft-Ebing draws attention to the fact that love and anger are the\r\ntwo most violent effective conditions, and are at the same time the\r\ntwo powers which provoke the most motor discharges. This explains why\r\nthey may be associated in the delirium of unbridled passions. To these\r\nfacts is added an atavistic relic of the instinct of man's ancestors,\r\nthe males of whom fought furiously to conquer the females by violence,\r\nwhich provoked desire in them, after the subjection of the object of\r\ntheir sexual appetite. True sadism can, however, only become effective\r\nby the combination of two causes: (1) by an exalted and absolutely\r\npathological association of sexual desire with a sanguinary instinct,\r\nand with the desire to illtreat and overcome a victim; (2) by an\r\nalmost absolute absence of moral sense and sympathy, combined with a\r\nviolent and egoistic sexual passion. It is evident that the slight\r\nmore or less sadic impulses which may involuntarily occur in the\r\nperformance of normal coitus, are quite exempt from the second of\r\nthese causes.\r\n\r\nKrafft-Ebing maintains that sadism is usually, if not always,\r\ncongenital and hereditary. Sadism is for a long time restrained by\r\nfear, education or moral sentiments. It is only gradually, when normal\r\ncoitus cannot procure for the perverted sexual appetite the\r\nsatisfaction it requires, that the sadist gives way to his passion;\r\nthis gives the latter a false appearance of acquired vice.\r\n\r\nThe highest degree of sadism leads to assassination. In this way human\r\ntigers entice young girls into a wood and cut them to pieces. Some\r\nbegin by forcing them to coitus, after frightening them, or half\r\nstrangling them; others masturbate in their ripped up entrails. But\r\nsome others have no desire for coitus, nor anything resembling it,\r\ntheir desire being satisfied only by the sight of the terror,\r\nsuffering and blood of their victim, whom they torture before killing.\r\nOthers again associate desire with the rage of a wild beast to such a\r\npoint that they swallow parts of their victim's body and drink the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nSadists become experts in the art of assassination without discovery.\r\nThe cynicism with which some of them have described their sensations\r\nshows their cold indifference toward the tragic and the horrible.\r\nKrafft-Ebing describes a series of atrocious types of this kind, and\r\nunfortunately the press and the criminal law courts continually give\r\nus fresh examples. Some sadists assassinate children, others men, when\r\ntheir perversion is complicated with pederasty or sexual inversion.\r\n(The story of Bluebeard is probably based on the successive crimes of\r\na sadic.)\r\n\r\nSadists do not always confine their attacks to living people; some of\r\nthem are _necrophiles_, who violate dead bodies and cut them in\r\npieces: others again kill animals, whose sufferings and blood serve to\r\nsatisfy their desires.\r\n\r\nSome sadists satisfy themselves by flogging prostitutes or pricking\r\nthem till they bleed, while others prefer to martyrize their victims\r\nslowly, and thus procure the maximum of pleasure. Others again are\r\ncontented with scenes symbolical of servitude, in which women are\r\ncompelled to adore and supplicate them, etc. The humiliation of women\r\ntakes part in the sadist appetite of man and often degenerates into\r\nfetichism. Simple imagination in which he plays the part of a tyrant,\r\nand which are complicated with onanism or normal coitus, often suffice\r\nto satisfy the sadist. Some sadists soil themselves with the\r\nexcrements of the woman they \"love!\" When sadism assumes the character\r\nof a symbol or a fetich, seminal ejaculation and sensation generally\r\noccur without contact with the woman's body.\r\n\r\nSadism is more common in men, but occurs also in women. Messalina and\r\nCatherine de Médici are historical examples. The latter had her maids\r\nof honor flogged before her eyes, and said she was bathing in roses\r\nwhen she witnessed the massacre of the Huguenots. Women in whom sadism\r\ntakes a milder form are contented with biting a man till he bleeds,\r\nduring coitus.\r\n\r\nSadism appears to be most often an effect of hereditary alcoholic\r\nblastophthoria.\r\n\r\n(B). _Masochism_ (association of sexual desire with submission to\r\ncruelty and violence). The term masochism is applied by Krafft-Ebing\r\nto a form of sexual perversion described by Sacher-Masoch in several\r\nof his romances. Masochism is exactly the converse of sadism. The\r\ndesire of the masochist is excited by humiliation, submission, and\r\neven blows; the pain he feels when he is flogged gives him intense\r\npleasure. Like sadism, this perversion may be incomplete. When it is\r\ncomplete the masochist is affected with psychic impotence and is\r\nincapable of normal coitus. Ill-treatment and humiliation are alone\r\ncapable of causing him erections, seminal ejaculations and pleasure.\r\nHowever, comedies representing his humiliation, or corresponding\r\nefforts of his imagination may succeed in replacing the reality and\r\nprocure the desired effect.\r\n\r\nLike sadism, masochism is hereditary and congenital. When the first\r\nsexual sensations are produced, the masochist child sighs for a\r\ndominating woman who will illtreat him and make him her slave. His\r\nimagination is transported by the idea of being on his knees, of being\r\ntrodden under foot, or bound in chains by her, etc. The cruel heroine\r\nof his heart must ridicule and humiliate him as much as possible.\r\nCorporal punishment with a beneficial object does not satisfy the true\r\nmasochist. Rousseau, in his \"Confessions,\" reveals the sexual feelings\r\nof the masochist.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how far poetic conceptions are combined with the\r\nperversion of sexual sensations in masochists, leading them to dream\r\nof an imperious and cruel woman to whom they devote a love as humble\r\nas it is exalted, while normal coitus causes them no pleasure, and can\r\nsometimes only be accomplished with the aid of masochistic images.\r\nThese images may also be accompanied by onanism. It is very common for\r\nmasochists to become flagellants, and to be flogged or trampled on by\r\nprostitutes. But it often happens that they only feel pain instead of\r\npleasure, when the comedy which they have started appears revealed in\r\nall its absurdity, showing them a woman paid to illtreat them, and not\r\ndoing it for her own enjoyment. Some masochists take pleasure in\r\nimagining themselves assassinated by a woman, or even cut in pieces.\r\nOthers organize theatrical performances in which imperious women play\r\nthe part of judges, before whom they appear naked and are flogged and\r\ncondemned to death. Others again are contented with imagining these\r\nperformances, combining them sometimes with coitus or masturbation.\r\n\r\nKrafft-Ebing is no doubt right in considering the lucubrations of the\r\npoet Baudelaire, and his necrophile imagination of his own carrion\r\nhung on a gibbet and devoured by vultures, as a mixture of sadism and\r\nmasochism. He sought out the most repulsive women of all races,\r\nChinese, negresses, dwarfs, giants, or modern women as artificial as\r\npossible, to satisfy his pathological instinct. The following case\r\nquoted by Krafft-Ebing from Hammond, is typical:\r\n\r\nA married man and father of several children was sometimes subject to\r\nattacks during which he visited a brothel, where he chose two or three\r\nof the fattest women. He stripped the upper part of his body, lay on\r\nthe floor, crossed his hands, shut his eyes and ordered the women to\r\ntread with all their force on his chest, neck and face. Sometimes he\r\nrequired a still heavier woman or more cruel manipulations. After two\r\nor three hours he was satisfied, paid the women liberally and regaled\r\nthem with wine, rubbed his bruises, dressed himself and returned to\r\nhis office, to repeat this singular performance a week later.\r\n\r\nKrafft-Ebing describes, as masked masochism, certain cases of\r\nfetichism in which the nature of the fetich which causes sexual\r\nexcitation and the manner in which it is used prove a desire for\r\nmaltreatment and humiliation by a woman. This is especially the case\r\nwith shoe and foot fetichism. Among those who are affected with this\r\npathological specialty, voluptuous sensations are produced when they\r\nare trodden on by a woman's shoes or feet. They even dream of women's\r\nshoes and feet. Some of them put nails in their shoes, the pain of\r\nwhich gives them voluptuous sensations. Lastly, the shoes alone,\r\nespecially when they touch the penis, are sufficient to excite their\r\nsexual desire. Other masked masochists are excited by the secretions\r\nor even excrements of women.\r\n\r\nI have been consulted by a typical masochist, who, being very\r\nreligious, was convinced that his perverted sexual appetite was a sin.\r\nHe therefore married, thinking that God and repentance would change\r\nhim. But when married he naturally found himself absolutely impotent\r\nand incapable of coitus.\r\n\r\nIf masochism is common in men, it is produced in women rather as an\r\nexaggeration in the domain of her normal sexual sensations, for it is\r\nto a great extent in harmony with her passive sexual role. Woman does\r\nnot like the weak man who submits to her. She prefers a master on whom\r\nshe can lean. In fact, normal women do not like their husbands to ask\r\nadvice from them too often, nor to be wanting in decision and\r\nself-confidence. On the contrary they like them to be firm and even\r\nsomewhat imperious, provided they are not unkind. It is notorious that\r\nmany women like to be beaten by their husbands, and are not content\r\nunless this is done. This appears to be especially common in Russia.\r\nAccentuated forms of pathological masochism are, however, rare in\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nMasochism presents a certain analogy with the religious ecstasy of\r\nfakirs and flagellants who flog themselves. These individuals appear\r\nto become exalted in a kind of ecstatic convulsion with the idea of\r\npleasing God or gaining Heaven by their martyrdom. We may add that,\r\nlike sadism, masochism occurs in sexual inverts, but always having the\r\nsame sex for its object. I know an old gentleman whose only pleasure\r\nconsisted in receiving a shower of blows: as a boy, like Rousseau he\r\ntried by all kinds of ruses to obtain corporal punishment: when he\r\ngrew up this became impossible and he devised tricks to urge\r\nschoolboys to fight each other, pretending to be angry and exciting\r\ntheir spirit of contradiction: the boys then pretended to fight him,\r\nand this sufficed for the rest of his life to excite erections and\r\nseminal ejaculations. This gentleman was a lawyer and told me his\r\nhistory, hoping that suggestion might cure him.\r\n\r\nThe eroticism produced by submission to pain and humiliation is often\r\nblended with that produced by performing acts of cruelty. These\r\nmixtures of sadism and masochism have been investigated by Schrenk\r\nNotzing, who concludes that they are intimately related.\r\n\r\n_Fetichism_ (production of voluptuous sensations by contact with or by\r\nthe sight of certain portions of the body or clothes of woman). We\r\nhave already mentioned this symptom and have seen the part it plays in\r\nsome forms of masochism. A masked form of fetichism forms part of the\r\nnormal sexual appetite, in the sense that certain parts of the body or\r\nclothes, certain odors, etc., especially excite the sexual desire of\r\nmany people by recalling the individual to whom they belong.\r\nTherefore, parts of the body which normally excite sexual desire--the\r\nbreasts, sexual organs, or other parts of the body usually\r\ncovered--cannot be regarded as pathological fetiches.\r\n\r\nThe true fetichist is a very pathological being, whose entire sexual\r\nappetite, often with all its irradiations in the higher sphere of\r\nlove, if we can speak of love in such cases, is limited to certain\r\nobjects connected with woman. The most common fetiches are women's\r\nhandkerchiefs, gloves, velvet or shoes; or their hair, hands or feet,\r\netc. In these cases the fetich plays the essential part, and is in no\r\nway associated with the image of a woman. The fetich is the sole\r\nobject of \"love.\" The sight or touch of the fetich, the pleasure of\r\npressing it against the heart or the genital organs, are alone capable\r\nof producing erections and ejaculations. There are even fetichists\r\nwhose sexual desire is only excited by the sight of certain feminine\r\ndeformities, such as clubfoot, squint, etc. Hairdressers, who\r\nmasturbate after dressing women's hair, are well-known examples of\r\nfetichism.\r\n\r\nCertain feminine costumes may serve as fetiches, and these are kept in\r\nsome brothels to satisfy certain customers. Shoe fetichism is more\r\ncommon than that of clothes or handkerchiefs. Krafft-Ebing mentions a\r\ntypical case of the psychic irradiation of fetichism; the individual\r\nin question thought it immoral and scandalous that women's shoes\r\nshould be exposed in shop windows. Others blush when they see such\r\nthings in the windows. Fetichism is essentially a masculine\r\nperversion. I have been consulted by a fetichist who all his life had\r\nonly felt erotic at the sight of shoes; later on he married, and his\r\nsexual desire becoming more and more concentrated on pointed and\r\nfashionable shoes, especially women's, but also men's, he could only\r\nobtain pleasure with his wife when she put on the shoes he was in love\r\nwith, or when he put them on himself. The sight of shoes in shop\r\nwindows always made him blush, while the female body made no\r\nimpression on him. He could not buy the shoes he desired most, owing\r\nto a sentiment of shame, and the sight of them was often sufficient to\r\nproduce erection and ejaculation.\r\n\r\n_Exhibitionism._ There is a class of individuals, especially men,\r\nwhose sole sexual desire consists in masturbating in the presence of\r\nwomen. They lie in wait behind some wall or bush, and masturbate\r\nopenly when women pass that way. In these subjects an orgasm is only\r\nproduced when they are observed by women. As soon as ejaculation has\r\noccurred they fly to avoid the police. They never attempt to molest\r\nthe women whose presence excites them to this performance.\r\n\r\nThese cases are not uncommon and naturally cause much scandal, so that\r\nthe poor wretches seldom escape the police. These unfortunate persons\r\nwho sometimes hold high social positions, have often been previously\r\nconvicted, but cannot as a rule overcome their passion, which has much\r\nworse consequences for them than for the women and children whom they\r\nfrighten or annoy.\r\n\r\nExhibitionism is not rare among insane women and I have myself treated\r\ntwo typical cases. I do not know whether it occurs in women of sound\r\nmind, but at all events they cannot be addicted to it without running\r\ngreat risk.\r\n\r\n=Sexual Inversion or Homosexual Love.=--However shocking or absurd the\r\naberrations of the sexual appetite and its irradiations may be, of\r\nwhich we have spoken hitherto, they are at any rate derived from\r\noriginally normal intercourse with adults of the opposite sex. Those\r\nwe have now to deal with are distinguished by the fact that, not only\r\nthe appetite itself, but all its psychic irradiations are directed to\r\nthe same sex as the perverted individual, the latter being horrified\r\nat the idea of genital contact with the opposite sex, quite as much as\r\na normal man is horrified at the idea of homosexual union. This\r\nhorror is, however, confined to sexual matters, and in no way concerns\r\nthose of social life. It is therefore a question of sexual desire of\r\nman for man, and woman for woman.\r\n\r\nWhat we have to deal with here has no connection with compensation as\r\nin cases of compensatory masturbation or pederasty, which are\r\npracticed, for want of anything better, by individuals whose normal\r\nsexual appetite cannot be satisfied otherwise. When excitation and\r\ndesire become too strong, the purely animal (spinal) irritation of the\r\nsexual appetite may drive a man or woman to satisfy themselves by\r\nmeans which would otherwise disgust them.\r\n\r\nA. _Homosexual love in man._ It seems absurd that the whole sexual\r\nappetite and amorous ideals of a man can be directed all his life to\r\npersons of his own sex. This pathological phenomenon, however, is as\r\ncommon as it is certain, although its psychological and normal import\r\nhas long been misapprehended, as much in judicial circles as by the\r\ngeneral public. It is the inverts themselves, aided by psychiatrists,\r\nwho have finally thrown light on the subject. An invert, named Ulrich,\r\nannounced himself publicly as the apostle of homosexual love,\r\ndescribing inverts under the name of _Urnings_, a name which is still\r\nused in Germany. Ulrich and his disciples endeavored to prove an\r\nabsurdity by maintaining that homosexuals are a special kind of normal\r\nmen, and by attempting to obtain legal sanction for this kind of love.\r\nUlrich gives the name _Dionings_ to men whose sexual appetite is\r\nnormal, _i.e._, directed toward women. Such a pretension appears\r\nnecessarily ridiculous to every man whose sexual sense is normal, and\r\nit is obviously absurd to apply the term \"normal\" to a sexual appetite\r\nabsolutely devoid of its natural object, procreation. But this is\r\nquite characteristic of the sentiments of inverts.\r\n\r\nHirschfeld, of Berlin, has recently attempted to show that homosexuals\r\nconstitute a variety of normal man; but he plays with words and facts,\r\ninvoking the names of celebrated inverts, and wrongly asserts that\r\ninversion is not hereditary.\r\n\r\nFrom the first dawn of sexual feeling in youth, male inverts have the\r\nsame feelings as girls toward other boys. They feel the need for\r\npassive submission, they become easily enraptured over novels and\r\ndress, they like to occupy themselves with feminine pursuits, to dress\r\nlike girls and to frequent women's societies. They regard women as\r\nfriends, as persons with whom they have a fellow-feeling. They\r\ngenerally, but not always, have a banal sentimentalism, they are fond\r\nof religious forms and ceremonies, they admire fine clothes and\r\nluxurious apartments; they dress their hair and \"fake\" themselves with\r\na coquetry which often exceeds that of women. They are not all like\r\nthis, but one or other of these traits predominates in different\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nTheir sexual appetite, usually very strong and precocious, begins with\r\nan exalted love for some male friend. I have treated a great number of\r\ninverts and have always been struck with the intensity of their\r\npassion. Among other cases, I may mention that of an invert hospital\r\nattendant, who fell madly in love with one of his comrades and covered\r\nten meters of white tape with the name of his beloved. The most\r\npassionate love letters, vows of fidelity till death, the most\r\nferocious jealousy toward other friends of their beloved, and even\r\nceremonies symbolical of marriage, are daily events among the\r\nhomosexuals.\r\n\r\nThe invert does not so easily become enamored of another invert as of\r\nnormal men. These have a special attraction for him, but as they\r\ngenerally repulse him with disgust, or threaten to expose or exploit\r\nhim, he is often obliged to content himself with his fellows. These\r\ngentlemen form among themselves a secret brotherhood, a kind of\r\nfreemasonry which is recognized by signs.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of the homosexual appetite with its youthful\r\nimpulses, causes love and happiness to appear to the invert in a\r\nspecial aspect, determined by the inverted irradiation of his sexual\r\nappetite. It represents the aim of his life as an amorous union with\r\nhis beloved, and shapes his idylls, his romance and his ideal to this\r\nend. But later on, when his sexual desire increases and when he\r\ndiscovers that the majority of men feel differently to him, that the\r\nhuman race is reproduced by the union of men and women, etc., he\r\nbecomes unhappy. He perceives that it would be both ridiculous and\r\ndangerous to reveal his inner feelings, and generally gives way to\r\nmasturbation. But all social barriers which oppose his appetite only\r\nincrease his desire, and he becomes less and less able to dominate his\r\npassion for certain young men. The disgust and indignation of the\r\nlatter, when they discover that they are not the object of simple\r\naffection but of perverted sexual love, are expressed only too\r\nclearly, and the poor invert sees himself condemned to perpetual\r\ntorment in trying to hide his most violent desires and his most\r\nintimate and ideal aspirations, and finally to live in continual dread\r\nof being betrayed and prosecuted. It is thus easy to understand that\r\nhe is happy in the discovery that his fellows form a secret society,\r\nand he associates with them immediately, when his moral sense and will\r\nare not strong enough to be proof against it.\r\n\r\n_If the invert succeeds in finding a male to his liking and with a\r\nsimilar degenerative state of mind to his own, he will pay him the\r\nattention that the normal man would to a woman. It is therefore\r\nreasonable to believe that this mode of inversion is likewise an\r\nexpression of pathological manifestation of the individual; usually\r\naccompanied by neurosis and a like corresponding deficiency in the\r\nphysical makeup of the individual._\r\n\r\nThe invert's ideal would be to obtain a legal license for marriage\r\nbetween men; but they are not very constant in their love and are much\r\ninclined to polyandry. Sexual love for women inspires them with\r\ncontempt; they regard it as low and disgusting, at the most only good\r\nfor the production of young inverts!\r\n\r\nHomosexual love has played a much greater part in the world's history\r\nthan is generally believed. The Count de Platen and Sapho were\r\ninverts. The inverts themselves maintain that it was the same with\r\nPlato, Frederick the Great, Socrates, etc.; but this is not proved. In\r\nthe East and in Brazil, homosexual love is very common.\r\n\r\nMy experience agrees with that of Krafft-Ebing, that homosexual love\r\nis pathological in nature, and that nearly all inverts are in a more\r\nor less marked degree psychopaths or neurotics, whose sexual appetite\r\nis not only abnormal but usually also exalted. Insane inverts, such as\r\nKing Louis II of Bavaria, a great number of the insane, affected, for\r\nexample, with _Pseudologia phantastica_ (pathological swindlers), and\r\nwho are also homosexual, show the intimate relationship which exists\r\nbetween sexual inversion (also called \"uranism\") and the psychoses.\r\n\r\nI agree with Rudin that the psycho-pathological phenomena presented by\r\nthe majority of inverts are primitive and hereditary, and that they\r\nare hardly ever the effect of their tormented life, as Hirschfeld,\r\nUlrich and their disciples maintain. The vexations, anxieties and\r\nother torments that they suffer may no doubt play a part in developing\r\ncertain nervous conditions previously latent, but they can never\r\ncreate hereditary taints. We may admit that sexual inversion\r\ncorresponds to a kind of partial hermaphrodism, in which the sexual\r\nglands and copulatory organs have the characters of one of the sexes,\r\nwhile the brain has, to a great extent, those of the other sex; but\r\nthe phenomenon is none the less pathological.\r\n\r\nThe inverts with whom we have most to do, especially in public asylums\r\nand at the courts of justice, are cynics and debauchees in spite of\r\nthe ideal which they parade; but we should be wrong in concluding that\r\nthis is always the case. The cynics make themselves heard because they\r\ndo not restrain themselves. In my private practice I have known many\r\nvery well-conducted inverts, possessing the most delicate sentiments,\r\nwho had become pessimists owing to the shame and grief of a state of\r\nmind which they hid from the world.\r\n\r\nInverts of this class often commit suicide, after having carried on in\r\nsilence a desperate struggle against their morbid appetite, because\r\nthey prefer death to defeat, which they consider a dishonor. The\r\nvictims of these tragedies deserve all our pity, and sometimes our\r\nrespect. Such individuals generally hold aloof from the brotherhood of\r\ninverts which they look upon with fear or disgust.\r\n\r\nIn the picture of homosexuals there are two lamentable shadows, which\r\nare largely due to the severity with which most legislations track and\r\ncondemn these unfortunate beings.\r\n\r\n(1). As soon as an invert realizes his abnormal and dangerous\r\nsituation in society, in which he feels a pariah, he often makes up\r\nhis mind to follow the advice of ignorant friends, and even, alas, of\r\nignorant doctors, and try and cure himself by marriage. Sometimes he\r\nbegins by visiting a brothel to see if he is capable of normal coitus\r\nwith a woman. In this he often succeeds, if he is able to picture to\r\nhimself a man in the person of the prostitute. He tries to persuade\r\nhimself that the disgust which he felt at this experimental coitus was\r\ndue to the fact that the \"love\" was bought; and he then decides to\r\nenter into conjugal life. This is at the same time the greatest\r\nabsurdity and the worst action possible for him to commit, for his\r\nwife becomes a martyr and soon feels herself deceived, abandoned and\r\ndespised. The invert treats her as a servant; he rarely has sexual\r\nintercourse with her, sometimes not at all, and only performs it with\r\nrepugnance with a view to the procreation of young inverts, who will\r\nrise to his ideal. He invites his male lovers to his house and they\r\nindulge in orgies, especially when the wife, despised and neglected,\r\nhas separated from him. Such marriages, which are fortunately less\r\ncommon since this question has been better understood, generally end\r\nin divorce, preceded by bitter and mutual deceptions. It is really\r\ncriminal to favor them when we know what they lead to. (_It is against\r\nsuch unions, and against sexual indulgence of this nature, that the\r\nlaw ought to exert itself._)\r\n\r\n(2). A second very grave result of homosexual love is the continual\r\nblackmail which is levied on inverts by all kinds of scamps. Public\r\nurinals are common meeting places for inverts. The blackmailers, who\r\nknow this very well, follow them there and offer themselves for money;\r\nbut as soon as they find out the name of their victim and his\r\nfinancial position, they begin to extort hush-money, threatening to\r\nprosecute him if he does not pay what they ask. If the invert is rich\r\nor of high position he has only to yield to the extortion, emigrate or\r\ncommit suicide. In this way the life of most well-to-do inverts is\r\nruined by perpetual anxieties, emotions and torments, because their\r\nmorbid appetite instinctively urges them to abandon themselves to men\r\nwho feel differently to themselves.\r\n\r\n_Moll, Krafft-Ebing and Hirschfeld have written at great length on\r\nsexual inversion. The law takes a just point of view and is generally\r\nsevere as regards this anomaly, especially in Germanic countries. Even\r\nhomosexual love that does not affect minors nor insane persons, is a\r\nsign of degeneracy, but produces no offspring and consequently dies\r\nout by means of selection. We hope, therefore, that this type may be\r\nextinct some day, although it is still decidedly numerous, principally\r\nin the larger cities of the world. When a normal man is tormented by\r\nan invert, it is much easier to get rid of him than for a young girl\r\nto protect herself against the importunities of a man._\r\n\r\nIt is quite another thing when the invert pays his attentions to\r\nminors, or when his appetites are complicated with dangerous sexual\r\nparæsthesias, such as sadism. Not long ago the terrible case of a\r\nsadist invert, Dippold, startled civilized Europe. By the aid of\r\ncruelty and intimidation this wretch martyrized two young boys\r\nconfided to him for their education to such a degree that one of them\r\ndied. Legal protection of the two sexes against sexual abuses of all\r\nkinds should be extended at least to the age of seventeen or eighteen.\r\n\r\nSexual inversion has two curious results which have not received\r\nsufficient attention. Human society regards it as quite natural and\r\nwithout danger for individuals of the same sex to bathe, sleep and\r\nlive together. In lunatic asylums, prisons, reformatories, etc., men\r\nare attended to by men, and women by women. The vow of chastity of\r\nCatholic priests and nuns leads in the same way to separation of the\r\nsexes. In all these customs sexual inversion has not been taken into\r\nconsideration. It is not surprising, therefore, that homosexuals take\r\nadvantage of this state of affairs and seek these situations which\r\ngive them the opportunity for satisfying their perverted passions\r\nwithout running much danger. _They willingly choose a career suitable\r\nfor their degenerate purposes, and especially that of attendant in\r\nlunatic asylums. In the latter case they take advantage of the mental\r\ncondition of the patients and their incapacity to make complaints. In\r\npublic baths inverts can freely enjoy the sight of naked men._\r\n\r\nSo far we have only spoken of complete inversion; but there are\r\ntransitional stages. Many individuals are neutral, animated by\r\nsensations floating between the two sexes. Krafft-Ebing even speaks\r\nof psycho-sexual hermaphrodites, who are equally attracted by either\r\nsex, and cohabit sometimes with one, sometimes with the other. I knew\r\na married man who was very capable with his wife but in spite of this\r\nwas unfaithful to her, both with men and with other women. He was\r\nconvicted several times for pederasty with men and young boys, and\r\nconfessed to me that he had more pleasure from homosexual intercourse\r\nthan from normal connection with women, but could satisfy himself\r\neither way. An incomplete invert declared to me that his ideal would\r\nbe a man.\r\n\r\nAlong with these cases there is a series of homosexuals in whom it is\r\nassumed that inversion has been acquired, because they commenced with\r\na normal sexual desire for women. After being seduced by homosexuals,\r\nwho initiate them in mutual onanism or pederasty, they are suddenly or\r\ngradually disgusted with women and become inverts (vide _Suggestion_).\r\nIn reality, these are only relatively cases of acquired inversion. If\r\nwe except the cases which depend on pure suggestion of which we shall\r\nspeak later, there is a latent hereditary disposition to inversion,\r\nwhich is awakened on the first occasion and then develops strongly. It\r\nis easy to prove that men with normal sexual instincts immediately\r\nabandon the habits of onanism or pederasty which they have contracted\r\nthrough bad example or seduction, or by compensation for the want of\r\nthe normal object, as soon as they can obtain normal sexual\r\nintercourse with one or more women. It is, therefore, false to regard\r\nhomosexual sensations as depending on vice and depravity: they are a\r\npathological product of abnormal hereditary sexual dispositions. At\r\nany rate, this is a general rule which has few exceptions.\r\n\r\nSexual inversion is so widespread that in certain countries, for\r\ninstance Brazil, and even in some European towns, there are brothels\r\nwith men instead of women.\r\n\r\nI will mention here a very curious case of purely psychical but\r\ncomplete inversion of the sexual personality, combined with complete\r\nsexual anæsthesia:\r\n\r\n    A man, aged 22, the son of an inebriate, with one imbecile\r\n    sister. Of delicate constitution, but very intelligent, he was\r\n    possessed since infancy with the idea that he was a girl,\r\n    although his genital organs were properly formed and were\r\n    normally developed at puberty. He had a horror of the society of\r\n    boys, and of all masculine work, while he was quite happy in\r\n    performing all the household duties of a woman. An irresistible\r\n    obsession urged him to dress himself as a woman, and neither\r\n    contempt, ridicule, nor punishment could cure him of it.\r\n    Attempts to give him employment as a boy in a small town failed\r\n    completely. His girlish manners made him suspected by the\r\n    police, who took him for a girl dressed in boy's clothes, and\r\n    threatened to arrest him. When he was compelled to put on male\r\n    attire he consoled himself with wearing a woman's chemise and\r\n    corset underneath.\r\n\r\n    I carefully examined this individual and found him affected with\r\n    complete sexual anæsthesia. He had a horror of everything\r\n    connected with the sexual appetite, but the idea of sexual\r\n    intercourse with men was still more repugnant than that of\r\n    normal coitus with women. Although the testicles and penis\r\n    appeared absolutely normal, he never had erections. His voice\r\n    was high pitched and his whole manner suggested that of a\r\n    eunuch.\r\n\r\nThis case is very instructive, for it clearly shows how the\r\npsycho-sexual personality may be predetermined by heredity in the\r\nbrain alone, independently of the sexual organs, and even act without\r\na trace of sexual sensation or appetite. This was undoubtedly a case\r\nof alcoholic blastophthoria and not ordinary heredity.\r\n\r\nKrafft-Ebing describes the following scene, taken from a Berlin\r\njournal, dated February, 1894, which gives a good idea of the manners\r\nand customs of the homosexual fraternity:\r\n\r\n\"_The misogynist's ball._ Almost all the social elements of Berlin\r\nhave their club or meeting place--the fat, the bald, the bachelors,\r\nthe widowers--why not the misogynists? This variety of the human\r\nspecies, whose society is hardly edifying, but whose psychology is\r\npeculiar, held a fancy dress ball a few days ago. The sale, or rather\r\nthe distribution of tickets was kept very private. Their meeting place\r\nis a well-known dancing hall. We enter the hall about midnight.\r\nDancing is going on to the music of a good orchestra. A thick cloud of\r\nsmoke obscures the lamps and prevents us at first from distinguishing\r\nthe details of the scene. It is only during an interval that we can\r\nmake a closer examination. Most of the people are masked, dress coats\r\nand ball dresses are exceptional.\r\n\r\n\"But what do I see? This lady in rose tarlatan, who has just\r\npirouetted before us has a cigar in her mouth and smokes like a\r\ntrooper. She has also a small beard, half hidden by paint. And she is\r\nnow talking to an \"angel\" in tights, very _décolleté_, with bare arms\r\ncrossed behind her, also smoking. They have men's voices and the\r\nconversation is also masculine, for it turns on 'this cursed tobacco\r\nwill not draw.' Two men dressed as women!\r\n\r\n\"A clown in conventional costume leaning against a pillar is speaking\r\ntender words to a ballet dancer, with his arm round her waist. She has\r\na Titian head, a fine profile and good figure. Her brilliant earrings,\r\nher necklace, her shapely shoulders and arms seem to proclaim her sex,\r\nwhen suddenly disengaging herself from the embracing arm she turns\r\naway with a yawn, saying in a bass voice, 'Emile, why are you so\r\ntiresome to-day?' The novice hardly believes his eyes: the ballet\r\ndancer is also a man.\r\n\r\n\"Becoming suspicious, we continue our investigations, beginning to\r\nthink that the world is here upside down. Here is a man who comes\r\ntripping along; but no, it cannot be a man, in spite of the small and\r\ncarefully curled mustache. The dressing of the hair, the powder and\r\npaint on the face, the blackened eyebrows, the gold earrings, the\r\nbouquet of flowers on the breast and shoulder, the elegant black gown,\r\nthe gold bracelets, the fan held in a white-gloved hand--none of these\r\nthings suggest a man. And with what coquetry he fans himself; how he\r\ndances and skips about! Nevertheless, Nature has created this doll in\r\nthe form of a man. He is a salesman in one of the large sweet shops,\r\nand the ballet dancer is his colleague!\r\n\r\n\"At the table in the corner there is a convivial meeting; several\r\nelderly gentlemen are gathered round a group of very _décolleté_\r\n'ladies' sitting over a glass of wine and cracking jokes which are\r\nanything but delicate. 'Who are these three ladies?' 'Ladies! laughs\r\nmy better-informed companion; well, the one on the right with the\r\nbrown hair and short fancy dress is a hair-dresser; the second, the\r\nblonde with the pearl necklace is known here by the name of Miss\r\nElla, and he is a ladies' tailor; the third is the celebrated Lottie.'\r\n\r\n\"But this cannot be a man? The waist, the bust, the delicate arms, the\r\nwhole appearance is feminine! I am told that Lottie was formerly an\r\naccountant. To-day she, or rather he, is simply 'Lottie,' and takes\r\npleasure in deceiving men as to his sex as long as possible. At this\r\nmoment Lottie is singing a song in a contralto voice acquired by\r\nprolonged practice, which a female singer might envy. Lottie has also\r\ntaken female parts on the stage. Nowadays the former accountant is so\r\nimbued with his female role that he seldom appears in the street\r\nexcept in woman's attire, and even wears an embroidered nightdress.\r\n\r\n\"On closer examination of the persons present, I discovered to my\r\nastonishment several acquaintances. My bootmaker, whom I should never\r\nhave taken for a misogynist, appears to-night as a troubador with\r\nsword and plumed cap; and his 'Leonora,' in the costume of a bride,\r\ngenerally serves me with Havanas in a cigar store. When Leonora\r\nremoved her gloves I recognized her at once by her large chilblained\r\nhands. Here is my haberdasher promenading in an indelicate costume as\r\nBacchus; also a Diana, dressed up atrociously, who is really a waiter\r\nat a café.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to describe the real 'ladies' who are at this ball.\r\nThey only associate with each other and avoid the women-hating men;\r\nwhile the latter also keep to themselves and absolutely ignore the\r\nfair sex.\"\r\n\r\n=B. Feminine Sexual Inversion and Homosexual Love.=--Sexual inversion\r\nis not rare in women, but manifests itself less publicly than the\r\ncorresponding masculine inversion. It is called Lesbian love or\r\n_saphism_; and the women inverts are known as _tribades_. They are\r\ndescribed in history, but may also be observed in modern towns. _They\r\nsatisfy their pathological appetite by degenerate practices heretofore\r\nmentioned in harmony with their inverted mentality._ The feminine\r\ninvert likes to dress as a man and feels like a man toward other\r\nwomen. She goes in for manly games, wears her hair short, and takes to\r\nmen's occupations in general. Her sexual appetite is often much\r\nexalted and then she becomes a veritable feminine Don Juan. I have\r\nknown several women of this kind, who held veritable orgies and\r\ninduced a whole series of young girls to become their lovers, in the\r\nway we have just indicated.\r\n\r\nHere again, as in masculine inversion, there is a true irradiated\r\nlove. Inverts want to marry and swear eternal fidelity; they celebrate\r\ntheir betrothals, even openly, the invert in male attire representing\r\nthe bridegroom; or sometimes they have secret symbols, such as\r\nexchanging rings, etc. These sexual orgies are often seasoned with\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n_The excesses of female inverts exceed those of the male. This is\r\ntheir one thought, night and day, almost without interruption.\r\nJealousy is also as strong as among male inverts. However, these\r\nnymphomaniac inverts are not very common._\r\n\r\nA characteristic peculiarity of feminine inversion depends on the\r\nirradiation of the sexual appetite in woman (_vide_ Chapters IV and\r\nV). We have seen that there is much less distinction in woman between\r\nlove and local sensations of pleasure, and between friendship and\r\nlove, than in man. When a woman invert wishes to seduce a normal girl,\r\nit is easy for her to do so. She first wins her affection by the aid\r\nof the caresses of an exalted platonic love, which is not uncommon\r\namong women; kisses, embraces, and sleeping in the same bed are much\r\nmore common among girls than boys, and little by little the invert\r\nsucceeds in causing voluptuous sensations in her victim. Very often\r\nthe object of these caresses does not recognize that there is anything\r\nabnormal in all this, or gives way to her sensations without\r\nreflection, and then becomes amorous in her turn. I will give an\r\nexample:\r\n\r\nA female invert, dressed as a young man, succeeded in winning the love\r\nof a normal girl, and was formally betrothed to her. Soon afterwards\r\nthe woman was unmasked, arrested and sent to an asylum, where she was\r\nmade to put on woman's clothes. But the young girl who had been\r\ndeceived continued to be amorous and visited her \"lover,\" who embraced\r\nher before every one, in a state of voluptuous ecstasy, which I\r\nwitnessed myself. When this scene was over, I took the young girl\r\naside and expressed my astonishment at seeing her continue to have any\r\nregard for the sham \"young man\" who had deceived her. Her reply was\r\ncharacteristic of a woman: \"Ah! you see, doctor, I love him, and I\r\ncannot help it!\"\r\n\r\nWhat can one reply to such logic? A psychic love of this kind is\r\nhardly possible in man; but if we go to the bottom of the matter and\r\nstudy the nature of woman, we can understand how certain feminine\r\nexaltations may be unconsciously transformed into love, platonic at\r\nfirst, afterwards sexual. At first, \"they understand each other so\r\nwell,\" and have so much mutual sympathy; they give each other pet\r\nnames, they kiss and embrace, and perform all kinds of tender actions.\r\nFinally, a graduated scale of caresses leads almost unconsciously to\r\nsexual excitation.\r\n\r\n_This is how it happens that a normal woman, systematically seduced by\r\nan invert, may become madly in love with her and commit sexual\r\nexcesses with her for years, becoming herself essentially\r\npathological. The case only becomes really pathological when it is\r\ndefinitely fixed by long habit; a thing which easily occurs in woman,\r\nowing to the constant and monogamous nature of her love._\r\n\r\nKrafft-Ebing's cases show the same phenomena, (for instance the invert\r\ncalled \"Count Sandor\" and her victims). In these cases also young\r\ngirls, seduced by inverts, fell into despair and even threatened to\r\ncommit suicide when their seducers abandoned them. On the other hand,\r\nwhen a normal man, seduced by an invert, practices mutual masturbation\r\nthe affair remains localized and limited to purely animal sensations\r\nof pleasure which do not irradiate to his psychic life; such\r\nirradiations only occur in the invert, so that his victims are always\r\nready to abandon him without the least regret. If we except children,\r\nit therefore follows that the so-called male victims are nearly always\r\nblackmailers, or simply offer themselves for money.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the normal man entirely separates the sympathy, or even the\r\nexalted affection, which he feels for another man, from all sexual\r\nsensations, and has not the least desire to kiss or caress his best\r\nfriend, still less to have sexual intercourse with him. All sensual\r\ncaresses between men are, therefore, suggestive of inversion even in\r\nplaces where women are absent.\r\n\r\nIn the normal woman, on the contrary, as we have already mentioned,\r\nsentiments of exalted sympathy easily provoke the desire for kisses\r\nand caresses, and these caresses often cause in women a certain amount\r\nof vague sensual pleasure. When this pleasure leads to progressive\r\ntenderness and ends in mutual onanism, etc., it nevertheless remains\r\nintimately connected with psychic exaltations and sentiments of\r\nsympathy, from which it cannot be separated as in man.\r\n\r\nIn a former chapter we have described the difference between the two\r\nsexes, but nowhere is it more distinctly shown than in the relations\r\nbetween a female invert and her victims.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore much more difficult in woman than in man to\r\ndistinguish in particular cases between the hereditary disposition to\r\ninversion, and saphism acquired by seduction or habit. The latter is\r\ncommon in prostitutes and libidinous women.\r\n\r\nAs we have already said, the pure female invert feels like a man. The\r\nidea of coitus with men is repugnant to her. She apes the habits,\r\nmanners and clothes of men. Female inverts have been known to wear\r\nmen's uniforms and perform military service for years, and even behave\r\nas heroes; their sex sometimes only being discovered after their\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n=Sexual Appetite for Children. (Pederosis.)=--It may be questioned\r\nwhether this is a special category, for many sexual assaults committed\r\non children are simply the effect of senile dementia, or abuse of\r\nchildren to satisfy an otherwise normal sexual appetite. I have,\r\nhowever, observed cases where children were so specially, or even\r\nexclusively, the object of the sexual appetite, that I cannot doubt\r\nthe existence of a special hereditary perversion in this direction.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, most of those who abuse children are also capable of coitus\r\nwith women, or else they are inverts, sadists, etc.; but with many of\r\nthem sexual passion for children is so marked from their youth upward,\r\nthat it shows a special hereditary disposition. For this pathological\r\ndisposition, thus defined, I propose the term _pederosis_; that of\r\n_pederasty_ applying to degeneracy between man and man, whatever\r\ncauses lead to it. Krafft-Ebing, who does not believe in the existence\r\nof a hereditary pederosis, gives the name _erotic pedophilia_ to the\r\nabuse of children by depraved persons.\r\n\r\nThe following are cases of exclusive and hereditary pederosis: A\r\ntalented artist, possessing high moral sentiments, was affected from\r\nhis youth with a sexual appetite exclusively directed toward little\r\ngirls of five or six years. At the age of twelve they ceased to\r\nattract him. He was quite indifferent to adults of both sexes, and\r\nnever accomplished coitus. _Having recognized in good time the anomaly\r\nof his appetite, he succeeded in mastering it all his life, and\r\nthrough education on the subject as well as a general physical\r\ndevelopment, he neutralized these morbid desires, particularly through\r\nthe training of his mind to cleaner and more wholesome topics. A great\r\nhelp in this type of condition is work therapy. His moral sentiments\r\nand principles were always strong enough to prevent him going any\r\nfurther, and he eventually obtained relief. But this condition gave\r\nrise to increasing nervous irritation and melancholic depression._\r\n\r\nIn another man, the sexual appetite, also perverted since its origin,\r\nwas directed only toward boys of twelve or sixteen. At one time girls\r\nof the same age excited him, while he was quite indifferent toward\r\nadult women and men.\r\n\r\nIn rare cases the sexual appetite of certain women is directed toward\r\nlittle boys.\r\n\r\n=Sexual Appetite for Animals. (Sodomy or Bestiality.)=[6]--A human\r\nsexual appetite exclusively directed toward animals is certainly not\r\ncommon. Coitus between man and animals usually takes place for want of\r\nthe opportunity for normal satisfaction, or else as the result of\r\nsatyriasis, nymphomania or desire for change. I have observed it\r\nespecially in idiots and imbeciles who are ridiculed by girls. To\r\nconsole themselves, they give vent to their feelings with a patient\r\ncow or goat in the silence of the stable: for this act they get\r\nseveral years imprisonment, for the law on this point is severe.\r\nCertain degraded libertines satisfy their hyperæsthetic and perverted\r\nappetites with goats or even with large birds or rabbits.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, cases where a pathological sexual appetite is\r\nspecially directed toward animals, and it is curious to observe the\r\nfrequent preference of certain individuals for small animals which\r\nthey skin (fowls, geese, rabbits), and thus put to death.\r\n\r\n_Bestiality is not rare in women who are also subject to this filthy,\r\nobnoxious and degenerative practice. Even if we put aside cases of\r\ntorture inflicted on small animals and if we avoid all prejudices, we\r\ncan still, in all normality, consider bestiality as a crime,\r\nmanifested by the depraved mind. In fact, considered from the point of\r\nview of law and humanity, bestiality is one of the most indecent of\r\nall the pathological aberrations of the sexual appetite. Human\r\nimagination only has marked it with the stigma of moral depravement\r\nand has made it a crime. But it is recognized scientifically that it\r\nis a state of mental inferiority and often a sign of idiotic tendency,\r\nusually accompanied by a case history, tainted heredity and highly\r\nneurotic constitution. Æstheticism has reason for complaint, and more\r\nthan one painter or sculptor has represented the union of Leda with\r\nthe Swan. It is certainly much better for society, for an idiot or an\r\nimbecile to be castrated than for him to make a girl pregnant and\r\nbreed more idiots._\r\n\r\n_In cases of this kind which I have known and which were brought to\r\njustice, I consider that the real sinner, the sodomite, should be\r\nconfined to an insane asylum under medical attention, and not, as at\r\npresent, to be condemned to imprisonment, thus making a martyr of him\r\nfor no reason, and putting the ban of society upon him. It is needless\r\nto say that cases of sodomy complicated by cruelty or sadism, should\r\nbe judged differently._\r\n\r\nThere are also other hereditary or constitutional perversions, more or\r\nless characteristic, of the sexual appetite, but we cannot enumerate\r\nall of them. We may mention, however, the erotic excitement which some\r\nmen feel at the sight of statues of women, which urges them to\r\nmasturbate against these statues.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEXUAL ANOMALIES IN THE INSANE AND IN PSYCHOPATHS\r\n\r\nWhen one is familiar with the population of a lunatic asylum, one is\r\nstruck by a singular phenomenon, from the sexual point of view. A\r\ngreat number of insane women give evidence of intense sexual desire.\r\nThis desire is manifested in some by incessant masturbation; in others\r\nby obscene conversation; in many others, by imaginary love, sometimes\r\nsensual, sometimes platonic; often by direct provocation to coitus\r\naddressed to the medical officers; but especially by perpetual scenes\r\nof jealousy, and often by reciprocal suspicions regarding their sexual\r\nlife. In fact, a lunatic asylum reveals to us, in the form of\r\nrepulsive caricatures, all gradations and variations of a more or less\r\ndegenerate feminine sexual life, coquetry, wearing all kinds of\r\nornaments, jealous anger, erotic excitement, etc.\r\n\r\nThe sexual excitation of the insane often makes them soil themselves\r\nwith urine and excrements, and heap insults on persons whom their\r\ndiseased imagination suspects of sexual assaults or immodest acts\r\ntoward themselves or others. They have a tendency to believe\r\nthemselves betrothed or married to kings, emperors, Jesus Christ or\r\nGod. Pregnancy and childbirth play a large part in their delirium.\r\nSome patients imagine themselves pregnant and pretend that they were\r\nfecundated secretly. Afterwards they believe that some one has taken\r\naway their child while they were asleep.\r\n\r\nOne of my former patients once accused me of going to her bed at night\r\nand fecundating her every week. She also accused me of having hidden\r\nthe hundreds of children which I was supposed to have procreated with\r\nher, and martyred them. Owing to these hallucinations she heard their\r\ncries day and night.\r\n\r\nAnother patient, affected with curable acute mania, was so erotic\r\nduring her attacks that she made advances toward all the doctors who\r\nvisited her. Her mind was full of such erotic images that after her\r\ncure she was frightened of being pregnant, although she had passed the\r\nwhole of her time of detention under supervision by female attendants.\r\nWomen who in their normal state are most modest or sexually cold may\r\nbe most erotic when they become insane, and may even behave as\r\nprostitutes. This is especially observed in periodic hypomania. It is\r\na well-known fact in the female divisions of lunatic asylums, that the\r\ndoctors are always surrounded by erotic patients, who catch hold of\r\ntheir clothes and pinch them, and try and embrace or scratch them\r\naccording as they are amorous or jealous, so that they often have\r\ntrouble in escaping from these signs of violent love or furious\r\njealousy.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the male divisions of asylums, one is astonished\r\nat the indifference and profound sexual apathy of nearly all insane\r\nmen. Some practice masturbation and others attempt pederasty, but all\r\nwith a philosophical calmness due to their dementia. Young women may\r\neven go among them without any fear of assaults or indecent language.\r\nIt is only a few of the most violent who are exceptions to this rule.\r\n\r\nA young lady doctor, assistant medical officer to the asylum at\r\nZurich, made her visits alone among all the males, even the most\r\nviolent, without any inconvenience; while, in the female divisions,\r\nshe was approached by the erotic patients as much as were the male\r\nassistants. I mention this fact because some people wrongly imagine\r\nthat the sexual excitation of insane women is due to the visits of\r\nmale doctors. These facts are very striking and furnish perhaps the\r\nbest proof that the feminine sexual appetite is especially situated in\r\nthe higher brain, while the masculine appetite is situated more in the\r\nlower cerebral centers, as we have shown above. Mental alienation is\r\ndue to irritations of the higher brain, and this explains why in women\r\nit lets loose such violent sexual passions and images, and why there\r\nis so little of this in men.\r\n\r\nThe sexual pathological symptoms of the insane are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1). _Erotomania_ (satyriasis and nymphomania), or abnormal exaltation\r\nof the sexual appetite. This is especially seen in acute mania, in the\r\nearly stages of general paralysis and senile dementia, also\r\ntemporarily or permanently in other psychoses. It is manifested by\r\nsexual excesses, obscene language or excessive masturbation. All these\r\nsymptoms disappear after the attack of insanity.\r\n\r\n(2). _Sexual anæsthesia_ or _hypoæsthesia_ or even _impotence_ may\r\noccur in the later stages of general paralysis and senile dementia. At\r\nthe commencement of general paralysis there is often violent sexual\r\ndesire combined with more or less complete impotence. The same thing\r\noccurs, as we shall see, in alcoholism.\r\n\r\n(3). Subjects affected with systematic delirium of persecution and\r\ngrandeur (paranoia) sometimes commit atrocious sexual excesses, and\r\noften tyrannize and torment in a terrible way the women who are their\r\nvictims. It is especially in the religious forms of this delirium,\r\ncombined with fanatic ecstasy, that the most repulsive sexual orgies\r\noccur. I have treated a patient with paranoia who, full of pious\r\nsayings, regarded himself as a kind of prophet. He made a poor girl\r\nand her mother sleep in his room and had connection with them\r\nalternately. Finally, he mixed his semen in coffee with the girl's\r\nmenstrual blood and made her drink the mixture, pretending that this\r\nwas a religious ceremony intended to produce a strong race. In the end\r\nhe set fire to the house of these poor women.\r\n\r\nSubjects affected with partial paranoia often turn the heads of\r\nsusceptible women by the aid of ascetic religious phraseology, to\r\ngratify afterwards their sexual passions. The worst cases are those\r\nwho are able to hide from the public their delirious ideas, and pass\r\nfor normal individuals, misunderstood victims, or even saints. I have\r\nexamined a very orthodox clergyman, highly esteemed by his\r\ncongregation on account of his ascetic and enthusiastic preaching. In\r\nhis own home he illtreated his wife, half strangled her, and exacted\r\nall kinds of sexual depravity. Unfortunately, the nature of his\r\ndelirium was not very evident, and he dissimulated so well that the\r\njurists would not admit his irresponsibility, in spite of my medical\r\ncertificate. His wife was obliged to run away to escape from her\r\nmartyrdom. The community of property in force in this family\r\ncompletely ruined this unfortunate woman. The husband was not a\r\nhypocrite, but simply insane. Volumes could be written on sexual\r\natrocities committed by such people.\r\n\r\nI will mention briefly the systematic delirium directed toward\r\npathological love. This is a very common symptom in insane women who\r\ncombine their amorous sentiments for man with the maddest ideas and\r\nhallucinations. An insane woman suddenly discovers that the object of\r\nher love is a king or Jesus Christ, and that she is betrothed to him.\r\nIn her delirium she imagines herself to be queen of the world. In her\r\ndreams and hallucinations her king or Christ is in bed with her and\r\nshe imagines she has connection with him. Still under the influence\r\nof hallucinations, she believes herself pregnant and carries an\r\nimaginary child for nine months in her womb. She may even imagine that\r\nshe has given birth to a child, and that the child has been taken away\r\nfrom her by the aid of narcotics, as we have seen above. Although\r\nthere is an infinite variety in the gradations, the pathological\r\nimages of the cerebral sexual sphere of insane women always revolve\r\nround this eternal theme.\r\n\r\nThese pathological irradiations of the sexual sphere are associated\r\nvoluntarily with jealous obsessions and ideas of persecution, which\r\nmake the subjects furious, and which are confirmed by their\r\nparæsthesias and hallucinations. Illusions of memory play a great part\r\nin these cases, for the subjects have often never felt what they\r\ncomplain of, and it is then a question of veritable hallucinational\r\nmemory. We may here observe by the way that, even among healthy\r\npeople, the sexual passions, like the others, always tend to falsify\r\nmemory, making things appear in the exclusive sense of the affective\r\nstate. Once fixed in the memory, such conceptions, the false tendency\r\nof which was originally based on passion, gradually assume the\r\nsubjective character of certainty. Cool-headed people, or those whose\r\naffective state directs them to contrary conceptions, then see in such\r\nindividuals a deliberate intention to misrepresent the facts. This is\r\nthe reason why people so often hurl mutual insults at each others\r\nheads, calling each other liars and calumniators, owing to the\r\naffective illusion of memory.\r\n\r\n(4). One of the worst of the sexual anomalies in the insane is\r\n_pathological jealousy_, especially in men. Their wives then become\r\nmartyrs, especially in cases of alcoholism and paranoia. It is not\r\nuncommon for assassination to put an end to their torments. Among\r\ninsane women, jealousy is certainly not less, but they have less legal\r\npower and less muscular strength. The most violent jealousy is found\r\nin alcoholics.\r\n\r\nJealous delirium renders the subject furious; a word, a look, or some\r\ntrivial circumstance are enough for him to prove the infidelity of his\r\nwife. The latter has to avoid the slightest thing which might arouse\r\njealousy, but all in vain; reserve and even prudery are regarded by\r\nthe jealous husband as hypocrisy. The unfortunate man watches his\r\nwife, night and day, like a watchdog: he threatens and insults her\r\nwith no reason, and calumniates her in all ways, even in the presence\r\nof a third party. He even lays elaborate traps for her. Cases of this\r\nkind are legion.\r\n\r\n(5). It is necessary to say that the _sexual paræsthesias_, of which\r\nwe have spoken, sadism, masochism, fetichism, inversion, etc., often\r\noccur in the insane.\r\n\r\n(6). The most atrocious sexual crimes are very often the work of\r\nidiots or imbeciles, but especially _moral idiots_, _i.e._, persons\r\nwhose idiocy is limited to the moral sense, who are also called simply\r\n_amoral_. This is due to hereditary taint, an innate absence of all\r\nsentiments of sympathy, pity and duty. Rape, violation of children,\r\nsexual assassination, etc., are usually due to the concomitant action\r\nof moral idiocy and violent or perverted sexual passions.\r\n\r\n(7). _Hypochondria_ also causes singular results in the sexual sphere.\r\nWe have already dealt with the masturbation of certain hypochondriacs,\r\nwhich is often wholly or partly imaginary. Others believe they have\r\ncommitted terrible sexual excesses, when nothing of the kind has\r\noccurred. I have seen a hypochondriac married and strongly built, who\r\nbelieved his health was ruined because he cohabited with his wife once\r\nevery two or three months. Other hypochondriacs become impotent simply\r\nbecause they think they are. Others again imagine they are affected\r\nwith venereal disease, which they have never contracted.\r\n\r\n(8). Hysterical men and women have a very peculiar sexuality. Hysteria\r\ndepends on auto-suggestion or on an exalted and morbid dissociability\r\nof psychic activity. A single idea is sufficient in a hysterical\r\nsubject, to produce the realization of what it represents. The\r\npassionate imagination may lead to opinions and actions which are\r\nabsolutely contradictory. Love and hatred often alternate by\r\ntransformation. According to the influences to which she is exposed,\r\nthe same hysterical woman may become a good or evil genius.\r\n\r\nIn the sexual domain the same extremes are produced in a very striking\r\nmanner. Inflamed by love, a hysterical woman may exhibit phenomenal\r\neroticism and the most violent sexual excesses, while indifference,\r\ndisgust, or simply distraction by other ideas will render her\r\nabsolutely frigid. Cold as ice toward other men, she may have\r\ninsatiable sexual desire for the man she loves.\r\n\r\nThe question is often raised whether a woman can love more than once\r\nin her life. There is no doubt that many women are so monogamous by\r\ninstinct that they cannot love more than once; but it is also certain\r\nthat a hysterical woman is capable of loving several times, and very\r\ndifferent persons at different periods of her life. The personality of\r\ncertain erotic hysterical women is even so dissociable that they can\r\nlove with all their strength several men at the same time. But the\r\nhysterical woman is also capable of hating a man with as much ardor as\r\nshe formerly loved him; or, on the contrary, of loving the one she\r\nformerly hated, according to the suggestion of the moment. The same\r\nphenomena occur in hysterical men.\r\n\r\nFor the same reasons the quality of the sexual sensations and\r\nsentiments may vary in a hysterical subject according to the\r\ninfluences it is subjected to, and pass from the normal to the\r\nperverted state, or inversely. I have observed a case where a highly\r\ncultured hysterical subject, in her early youth, fell in love with\r\nanother young girl. At this period her sentiments were purely\r\nhomosexual; her love for the young girl was clearly inverted and\r\naccompanied by intense sexual desire, while she was absolutely\r\nindifferent to men. Later on, a man fell in love with her, and she\r\nyielded to him rather from pity and feminine passiveness than from\r\nlove. Still later she fell passionately in love with another man,\r\nquite as much as she had been with the young girl of her early youth.\r\nHer latest love was both exalted and libidinous. Her sexual appetite\r\nhad thus taken the normal direction under the influence of a\r\nhetero-sexual affection.\r\n\r\nIn hysterical men analogous changes occur less easily, on account of\r\nthe nature of masculine sexuality which distinguishes more clearly\r\nbetween the mind and the appetite; but these changes are observed\r\nsometimes. In woman, the hysterical imagination and dissociation\r\nfacilitate a polyandrous irradiation of the sexual appetite, which is\r\notherwise rare in the female sex. In this respect the sexuality of\r\nhysterical women resembles that of men and differs from that of\r\nnormal women. Hysterical men, on the other hand, become more feminine,\r\nnot by their appetite being less polygamous, but by the more\r\ndissociated form of their thoughts and sentiments.\r\n\r\n(9). A variety of the pathological love of abnormal individuals is\r\n_imaginary love_, not founded on delirious ideas. Certain psychopaths\r\nof both sexes are convinced that they love some one, but they suddenly\r\nperceive during their betrothal, or even only after marriage, that\r\nthey are mistaken and that they have never loved the person in\r\nquestion. Such illusions are the cause of numerous broken engagements,\r\ndivorce and conjugal bitterness.\r\n\r\n(10). _Amorous tyranny_ constitutes another variety in the pathology\r\nof love. Lovers of this kind constantly tyrannize and torment the\r\nobject of their passion, by their desires, their observations, their\r\nsensitive temper, their contradictions, their exigencies and their\r\njealousy. This atrocious manner of loving is common in both sexes;\r\nperhaps more so in women than men.\r\n\r\n(11). The _love of psychopaths_ is a subject which has no end. If\r\nhuman society was better acquainted with psychopathology a great deal\r\nof conjugal misunderstanding and misery would be avoided.\r\n\r\nI have known a woman who would not allow her husband to shut himself\r\nin the water-closet, for fear he would take the servant with him!\r\nAnother became madly jealous if a woman sat opposite her husband and\r\ncast the least glance at him; the unfortunate husband not knowing\r\nwhere to look, in the street or in hotels, so as to escape his wife's\r\njealousy. It is still worse when the husband is jealous.\r\n\r\nOther psychopaths torment the object of their love by the perpetual\r\ncare they take over imaginary dangers or the slightest indispositions.\r\nOthers again are affected with hyperæsthesia, and the least noise, the\r\nslightest touch, or any sudden sensation, is enough to throw them into\r\nexcitement and make them a nuisance both to themselves and to their\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nThe pathological exaltation of sentiments, which causes the most\r\ntrifling things to appear as deliberate offenses, and malicious\r\nintentions, is still more to be feared. The disproportion between\r\nlove and sexual appetite also torments many psychopaths, either when a\r\ndeep love is combined with sexual indifference or disgust at coitus,\r\nor even pain (vaginismus, in women, for example); or when an intense\r\nsexual appetite is combined with want of love or ferocious egoism\r\n(especially in men).\r\n\r\nCertain psychopaths appear profoundly amorous but behave like brutes\r\nto the object of their love. These are the individuals who are always\r\nready to strangle their sweetheart, to stab or shoot her, if she does\r\nnot immediately yield to their desires; or else the feeble creatures\r\nwho threaten to commit suicide if their love is not returned.\r\n\r\nOthers, tormented by a pathological eroticism are continually annoying\r\nyoung and virtuous girls with their obsessions and their pathological\r\ngrossness. I have seen a psychopath of this kind write letters and\r\neven post cards to a young girl, on which he had drawn pictures of the\r\nfemale genitals, by way of gallantry. In women, hatred and vengeance,\r\naroused by jealousy, are especially blind and tenacious when the\r\nchronic passions of psychopathia intervene; this being due to the\r\nperseverance natural to the sex. By the aid of their refined\r\nintrigues; by their misrepresented statements due to the illusions of\r\na memory distorted by passion, but uttered with a consummate dramatic\r\nart, some women may play a truly diabolical role, and even deceive a\r\nwhole tribunal. When we get to the bottom of the matter, we often find\r\nthat the primary cause of the evil is a sexual passion embellished and\r\nidealized afterwards by all kinds of noble motives, but in reality\r\nmore or less unconsciously hypocritical. While deceiving others, these\r\npsychopathic women also deceive themselves. There are also a number of\r\nmale psychopaths quite analogous to the above and generally\r\nhysterical.\r\n\r\nOther morbid symptoms, such as obsessions and pathological impulses,\r\nhave a certain importance as regards sexual appetite and love. Love or\r\nrejection, as well as other sexual images, may become the objects of\r\nobsessions, and then cause the subjects much torment, but without\r\nharming their surroundings; for the obsessed generally remain passive.\r\nPathological impulse to actions may, on the contrary, become dangerous\r\nand lead to violation, whether combined with perversion or not.\r\n\r\n(12). We have seen that _senile paradoxy_ often shows itself, as a\r\nsymptom of senile dementia, by a sexual appetite for children. This is\r\nthe initial symptom of the complaint, and may lead to the commission\r\nof assault. The holy indignation of the public, and often of ignorant\r\njudges, against these depraved old men often result in the public\r\ncontempt or even the imprisonment of poor patients who have hitherto\r\nled a blameless life, and who have simply become victims of senile\r\ndegeneration of the arteries of the brain.\r\n\r\n(13). I will mention another case which I have observed, which shows\r\nhow complex hereditary cerebral pathology may become, and lead in turn\r\nto crime, madness and sexual perversion; giving rise to the most\r\ntragic scenes of human life, and to the degeneration of families.\r\n\r\n    A very charming and intelligent, but deceitful man, an amoral\r\n    person whose heredity was strongly tainted with mental disease,\r\n    had strong sexual instincts partly inverted. He was attracted\r\n    rather more by men than by women, but committed excesses with\r\n    both sexes. He married a virtuous and intelligent midwife. At\r\n    long intervals he had three attacks of acute mania, but was\r\n    cured after each attack and procreated two boys and a girl. When\r\n    he was sane he spent his time in deceitful occupations and\r\n    speculation and never worked honestly to earn his living. He\r\n    behaved well toward his wife, but this did not prevent him\r\n    committing pederasty with men. He was often convicted for\r\n    pederasty and swindling, and I treated him several times in an\r\n    asylum. His poor wife complained bitterly, but found consolation\r\n    in her husband's apparent love, but especially in the careful\r\n    education of her children. But when the children grew up, her\r\n    illusions disappeared one after another. The daughter became\r\n    feeble-minded, and one of the sons became a bad character. The\r\n    mother consoled herself with the second son who appeared honest\r\n    and hard-working. The father was then in an asylum, his relapses\r\n    having led the tribunal to institute an inquiry into his mental\r\n    condition. One day the mother came to me in despair and showed\r\n    me a letter written by the son of the father, which she had\r\n    opened; the contents were as follows: \"Miserable father, when\r\n    you receive this letter I shall be no longer in this world; but\r\n    before dying I wish to curse you. You have been the disgrace of\r\n    the family. You have caused misery to our mother and her\r\n    children by your crimes. Why did you bring me into this world?\r\n    For a long time I have felt evil instincts developing in me like\r\n    a cursed heritage. I struggle in vain against them; but the more\r\n    I struggle the more I feel I must succumb. I am incapable of\r\n    resisting much longer; but I will not become a criminal like\r\n    you, so I shall hang myself to-night, and I curse you again\r\n    before doing it.\"\r\n\r\n    The unfortunate son did in fact commit suicide, and drove his\r\n    mother to despair. I showed the father his son's letter, but he\r\n    only smiled and shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe following is another example:\r\n\r\n    A man of 50, married, and the father of six children, ranging\r\n    from 6 to 24 years of age, violated them all, both girls and\r\n    boys. The whole family were abnormal and perverse. A son of 18\r\n    had sexual intercourse with his mother and sister. The father\r\n    also had intercourse with dogs and cats. The jury before whom I\r\n    brought the case regarded the man as mad, but he was condemned\r\n    to ten years' imprisonment. An asylum for dangerous and\r\n    perverted lunatics is urgently required for such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF NARCOTICS, ESPECIALLY ALCOHOL, ON THE SEXUAL APPETITE\r\n\r\nThe functional cerebral paralyses produced by narcotics closely\r\nresemble in their psychopathological physiognomy the organic paralyses\r\nwhich result from slow atrophy of the cerebral cortex, as in general\r\nparalysis--exaltation of sentiment, tremor and slowness of movement up\r\nto total paralysis, disorders of orientation in time and space,\r\nprofound mental dissociation affecting the subconscious automatic\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the individual loses the exact appreciation of his\r\nown personality and of the external world; he regards himself as very\r\ncapable in body and mind while he is becoming more and more powerless;\r\nand everything appears rose-colored at the time when he is in a most\r\ncritical state. He believes himself possessed of great muscular\r\nstrength when paralysis makes him stagger, and so on.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of narcosis the phenomena are somewhat different\r\nfrom what they become later; a certain amount of excitement\r\npredominates, as well as the spirit of enterprise and exaltation of\r\nthe appetites; while later on paralysis, relaxation and somnolence\r\nplay the principal part.\r\n\r\nNarcosis acts in a similar way on the genetic sense. It begins by\r\nexciting sexual desire, but diminishes the power. As Shakespere says:\r\n\"Lechery it provokes and unprovokes; it provokes the desire but it\r\ntakes away the performance.\" (Macbeth, Act II, Scene iii.) No doubt\r\nthe narcotics are not all equal in action, and each has its specific\r\npeculiarities; but the words of Shakespere express the essential\r\neffect of all narcotics on the sexual appetite: First of all\r\nexcitation of the appetite with the disappearance of moral and\r\nintellectual inhibitory representations, and reënforcement of the\r\nspirit of enterprise; afterwards, progressive paralysis of sexual\r\npower, and finally extinction of the initial appetite itself.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena are of capital importance in alcoholic narcosis, which\r\nplays the principal part in civilized countries. The initial\r\nexcitation is here very accentuated. If we make a closer examination,\r\nhowever, we find from the first a relaxation of sexual activity and a\r\nweakening of all sensory irritations. In coitus, erections are\r\nproduced more slowly; the voluptuous sensations, it is true, are of\r\ngreat subjective intensity, but they are developed more slowly and\r\nthere is more difficulty in producing ejaculation. The subsequent\r\nrelaxation is very great, and a man who is even only slightly\r\nintoxicated cannot perform coitus as rapidly, nor repeat it so often,\r\nas when he has taken no alcoholic liquor. When the narcosis increases\r\nthe impotence becomes complete. Owing to the illusion produced by the\r\nnarcosis, however, a drunken man generally imagines himself to be very\r\ncapable.\r\n\r\nThe gross and clumsy form which flirtation assumes under the action of\r\nalcohol is only too well known. The gross and persistent obscenity of\r\ndrunken persons in railway carriages and other places toward women is\r\nan example of alcoholic flirtation. (_Vide_ Chapter IV.)\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of the sexual appetite in alcoholic narcosis is\r\nits bestiality. The higher irradiations of love are completely\r\nparalyzed and sensuality becomes unrestrained, even in men who, when\r\nsober, are full of refined sentiments.\r\n\r\nThe depraving effect of alcohol on the sexual appetite is therefore\r\nunlimited. Alcohol does not limit itself to giving free play to a\r\nbestial appetite, by paralyzing reason and sentiments of sympathy and\r\nduty; it also has a strong tendency to pervert the appetite itself. In\r\na considerable proportion of cases of exhibitionism, inversion,\r\npederosis, sodomy, etc., the development of the perversion is greatly\r\nfavored, or even directly produced, by the action of alcohol,\r\nespecially when there is a latent predisposition. I have observed a\r\nwhole series of perversions in persons whose sexual appetite was\r\nnormal when they were sober, but became perverted on the slightest\r\nintoxication. I am convinced that if more attention was paid to the\r\nsubject the number of cases in which alcohol increases the perversion,\r\nor is even necessary for its development, would be increased.\r\n\r\nBut what is of much greater importance is the fact that acute and\r\nchronic alcoholic intoxication deteriorates the germinal protoplasm of\r\nthe procreators. I refer the reader to what I have said at the end of\r\nChapter I on blastophthoria. The recent researches of Bezzola seem to\r\nprove that the old belief in the bad quality of children conceived\r\nduring drunkenness is not without foundation. Relying on the Swiss\r\ncensus of 1900, in which there figure nine thousand idiots, and after\r\ncareful examination of the bulletins concerning them, this author has\r\nproved that there are two acute annual maximum periods for the\r\nconception of idiots (calculated from nine months before birth): the\r\nperiods of carnival and vintage, when the people drink most. In the\r\nwine-growing districts the maximum conception of idiots at the time of\r\nvintage is enormous, while it is almost _nil_ at other periods.\r\nMoreover, these two maximum periods come at the time of year when\r\nconception is at a minimum among the rest of the population; the\r\nmaximum of normal conceptions occurring at the beginning of summer.\r\n\r\nIf these facts are confirmed by further research, we may conclude that\r\neven acute alcoholism has a blastophthoric action. We may, therefore,\r\nassume that when a germinal cell leaves its gland at the moment when\r\nit is impregnated with alcohol, and achieves conjugation, it is unable\r\nto return to its normal condition, for want of opportunity to be\r\ncompletely and promptly cleansed by nutrition and the circulation.\r\nThis explains how it may transmit to the individual which develops\r\nfrom it all kinds of taints and defects.\r\n\r\nAfter what we have said, we can tabulate the destructive effects of\r\nthe narcotic poisons and alcohol in particular, in the sexual domain,\r\nboth from the individual and social points of view, as follows:\r\n\r\n(1). Irreflective sexual unions, resulting from exaltation of the\r\nsexual appetite and temporary paralysis of the sentiments which\r\ninhibit such unions in persons who are not under the influence of\r\nalcohol. These include the seduction of girls, orgies with prostitutes\r\nin brothels, and the procreation of children with low-class women, or\r\nunder unfavorable conditions.\r\n\r\n(2). Increase of venereal disease. I have made statistics which show\r\nthat about 75 per cent. of venereal disease is contracted by men under\r\nthe influence of alcohol, chiefly by persons who are slightly\r\nintoxicated and rendered enterprising thereby.\r\n\r\n(3). All kinds of misfortunes and catastrophes, such as illegitimate\r\npregnancies, despair, suicide, etc., resulting from irreflective\r\nsexual unions and venereal disease.\r\n\r\n(4). The production of the majority of sexual crimes also resulting\r\nfrom the exasperation of eroticism combined with irreflection and\r\ngeneral motor impulsiveness. Jealousy here plays a great part. The\r\nmost important statistics (for example, those of Baer, in Germany),\r\nprove that from 50 to 75 per cent. of criminal assaults are committed\r\nunder the influence of alcohol. Indecent exposure, etc., is due to\r\nalcohol in 75 or 80 per cent.\r\n\r\n(5). Exaltation and sometimes development of sexual perversion.\r\n\r\n(6). Creation of hereditary alcoholic blastophthoria, either as the\r\nresult of a single drinking bout, or from habitual drunkenness. The\r\noffspring tainted with alcoholic blastophthoria suffer from various\r\nbodily and physical anomalies, among which are dwarfism, rickets, a\r\npredisposition to tuberculosis and epilepsy, moral idiocy and idiocy\r\nin general, a disposition to crime and mental diseases, sexual\r\nperversions, loss of suckling in women, and many other misfortunes.\r\n\r\n(7). The delirium of jealousy is a specific symptom of chronic\r\nalcoholism. Its effects are terrible and lead to all kinds of sorts of\r\ninfamies, assaults and even assassination.\r\n\r\n(8). Alcohol is also the almost indispensable vehicle of prostitution\r\nand proxenetism, which could not be maintained without it, at any rate\r\nin their present disgusting and brutal form.\r\n\r\n(9). The coarseness and vulgarity of alcoholic eroticism produce in\r\npublic places, as well as in private, an importunate and obscene form\r\nof flirtation, which is brutally and cynically opposed to all\r\nsentiments of propriety and modesty.\r\n\r\nThe above statements refer chiefly to men. Among women, alcoholism is\r\nless common, at least in continental Europe; in England, however,\r\ndrunken women are often seen in the streets. Among prostitutes,\r\nhowever, alcoholism is almost universal. Proxenetism makes use of\r\nalcohol to compromise and seduce girls and thus lead them to\r\nprostitution. When they have once fallen they often drink to forget\r\nthe horror of their situation.\r\n\r\nThe action of alcohol on the feminine sexual appetite is very\r\npeculiar. The appetite is generally exalted, while the power is not\r\naffected, owing to the passive role of woman in coitus. At first,\r\nparalysis of the psychic inhibitions and their higher irradiations\r\n(love, duty, modesty, etc.) by alcohol deprives the woman of nearly\r\nall power of resistance against the sexual desire of the man. It\r\nresults from this that an intoxicated woman becomes the easy prey of a\r\nman whose sexual appetite is excited. The following case is\r\ninstructive from this point of view:\r\n\r\n    A young girl of good position married a man of weak and vulgar\r\n    character. Both were rather fond of drink. When she became\r\n    pregnant the wife took large quantities of wine, by the doctor's\r\n    orders, and this led her to inebriety. The friends and\r\n    acquaintances of the husband found this amusing, and began to\r\n    flirt with her to such an extent that she fell a victim to their\r\n    sexual appetites, in her continual state of semi-intoxication.\r\n    The husband at first had not the courage to put an end to this\r\n    and did not wish to divorce her, for pecuniary reasons; for the\r\n    wife had the money. He finally decided to send her to an asylum\r\n    which I superintended, to cure her alcoholism.\r\n\r\n    From the antecedents of the patient, I expected to see a cynical\r\n    and erotic woman; but she was nothing of the kind. Although\r\n    hardly sober, this woman was modest and well-behaved. What\r\n    struck me most was her extreme of modesty, which at first made\r\n    it difficult for me to investigate her psychological state. Her\r\n    conduct was exemplary the whole time, and she eventually\r\n    confided to me that it was not so much sexual desire as the\r\n    profound indifference and feebleness developed by inebriety\r\n    which had caused her to give way. Before leaving the asylum she\r\n    joined a total abstinence society, returned to her husband and\r\n    succeeded in converting him also to total abstinence. She kept\r\n    to her pledge and lived afterwards in conjugal peace and\r\n    happiness, without ever relapsing into her old infidelity. I saw\r\n    her several years afterwards with her husband, happy and\r\n    flourishing.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned this case to show that, even in women, sexual excess\r\ndoes not necessarily destroy the character, the sentiments of modesty,\r\nnor the will. It all depends on their cause. If there is congenital\r\nweakness of character, the evil is irreparable; but if it is only due\r\nto external forces which can be eliminated in time, its effect may\r\noften be permanently suppressed. Some female inebriates are sexually\r\ncold and repulse men; but others are erotic and even nymphomaniacs.\r\n\r\nWhosoever has the welfare of humanity at heart, and takes the trouble\r\nto reflect on the ravages caused by alcohol in human society, should\r\nhave the courage to make a slight effort and renounce all alcoholic\r\ndrink--say for six months at first, as an experiment--in order to\r\ncombat the social alcoholic misery by force of example, instead of\r\nempty phrases. He will then discover, like all abstainers, that the\r\nusage of alcohol (including wine, cider and beer) however small the\r\nquantity consumed, only serves to maintain a habit which is vicious\r\nand disastrous to society, by giving the contagious example of\r\nso-called moderation, to which a great number of persons cannot\r\nrestrict themselves. He will then abstain for the rest of his days,\r\nand it will become more and more incomprehensible to him how humanity\r\nhas been led, first by the spirit of imitation, later by the\r\nconservation of prejudices, to develop, maintain and defend such a\r\nsocial abuse by the aid of a legion of sophisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEXUAL ANOMALIES AND PERVERSIONS BY SUGGESTION AND AUTO-SUGGESTION\r\n\r\nThe role of the phenomena of suggestion in sexual life is much greater\r\nthan is generally supposed. I shall return to this subject in a\r\nspecial chapter, but I may state here that there is a category of\r\nsexual perversions and anomalies of all kinds which are not hereditary\r\nbut acquired, and which Krafft-Ebing, although he cites striking\r\nexamples, wrongly attributes to the effect of sexual excess and\r\ndepravity, or which he compares to ordinary psychopathia, while in\r\nreality they are only the direct effect of strong suggestion or\r\nauto-suggestion.\r\n\r\nI place in this category the cases where a man, whose sexuality has\r\nhitherto been normal, suddenly becomes pathological as the result of\r\nsome circumstance which produces on him a profound impression. For\r\ninstance, the sexual appetite of an individual may be strongly\r\nexcited, in a brothel or elsewhere, by an erotic woman whose feet or\r\nshoes are especially elegant. The sight of this well-fitted foot\r\nexalts his sexual desire to a high degree. From this moment feminine\r\nshoes, by subjective association, exercise on him an irresistible\r\nerotic power, which dominates everything else and transforms him into\r\na fetichist; the female body no longer elicits his appetite, the\r\nlatter having become the slave of the image of shoes only. (Shoe\r\nfetichism.)\r\n\r\nSexual inversion may also be acquired by suggestion, when a normal man\r\nbecomes excited by acts of masturbation or pederasty, or simply by\r\nsome psychic image with a strongly suggestive action. He may thus lose\r\nhis normal sexual appetite for women and become homosexual.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena occur especially in individuals whose suggestibility\r\nis pathological or hysterical, or even simply exaggerated. But these\r\nindividuals are numerous, and this fact gives us the explanation of a\r\nlarge proportion of acquired sexual anomalies, at the same time\r\nindicating the means of curing them. In such cases, it is not a\r\nquestion of moral depravity, nor necessarily of a latent hereditary\r\npredisposition, but simply of a single sudden suggestive action,\r\nsometimes repeated.\r\n\r\nAmong other cases, I may mention that of a well-educated man of very\r\nrefined sentiments, deeply in love with his wife, but very\r\nsuggestible, who became suddenly impotent and homosexual as the result\r\nof a simple idea-image which became fixed in his mind and subjected it\r\nby suggestion. His strong character enabled him to resist intercourse\r\nwith males, but he fell into despair and became very unhappy. I am\r\nconvinced that a careful study would reveal an increasing number of\r\ncases of psychopathia acquired by suggestion or auto-suggestion.\r\n\r\nCases of this kind may be spontaneously cured. Treatment by suggestion\r\nis indicated and may act directly or indirectly. Everything which is\r\nof a functional psychic nature may occur by suggestion, or be, on the\r\ncontrary, eradicated by suggestion. The important point is to\r\nemphasize the fact that whenever a man, hitherto normal, is affected,\r\nwithout apparent cause, with a more or less sudden sexual anomaly, and\r\nwhich is consequently not the effect of long habit, suggestion or\r\nauto-suggestion should be borne in mind.\r\n\r\nThese two conceptions can, moreover, be hardly distinguished, for the\r\nthings which cause suggestion are usually the sensory perceptions of\r\nsight, smell, touch and hearing, associated with certain situations,\r\nor with an intense affective state which fixes them in the brain.\r\nSometimes it is a question of simple imaginative ideas. The cases\r\nwhere a hypnotizer intentionally suggests sexual perversion probably\r\nexist only in theory. We are, therefore, concerned with fortuitous\r\nsuggestions, acting through persons, situations, objects or ideas,\r\nwhich excite the mind by the impression they produce on the sentiments\r\nand the sexual appetite.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEXUAL PERVERSIONS DUE TO HABIT\r\n\r\nWithout being congenital and without depending on a special\r\npredisposition, all the perversions of the sexual appetite that we\r\nhave just described may be acquired, by means of the artificial and\r\ncontinued excitation of a sexual appetite which seeks satisfaction in\r\nchange and unusual situations: Moreover, perverse satisfaction of the\r\nsexual appetite is often resorted to--onanism, pederasty or oral\r\ncoitus--either to avoid conception, or with the idea of escaping\r\nvenereal disease, or in the case of onanism, to avoid publicity,\r\ntrouble or expense. As we have seen above alcohol favors the\r\ndevelopment of sexual perversions.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a commerce in women systematically tolerated by the\r\nstate, as is the proxenetism of regulated prostitution, employs all\r\nmeans imaginable to attract and excite its clients. In this way\r\nprostitution becomes the high-school for all the refinements of sexual\r\nperversion. It not only offers special objects required by individuals\r\ntainted by heredity with various perversions, but it artificially\r\ndevelops perverse habits in the normal man. The manipulations of\r\nsadism or masochism are even utilized to revive a sexual appetite\r\nweakened by abuse. Individuals who have become impotent often try to\r\nexcite themselves by observing the coitus of others. In fact a leaven\r\nof corruption and ignominy ferments on the dunghill of venal and\r\nartificial excitation of the sexual appetite.\r\n\r\nThe apostles of Mammon and Bacchus, the former by interest, the latter\r\nby the aid of a narcosis which paralyzes the higher sentiments and\r\nreflection, work in concert to maintain this foul swamp. The same\r\nindividuals very commonly combine the two apostleships and become\r\nthemselves the victims of their false gods, after sacrificing hundreds\r\nof their fellows.\r\n\r\nTo make matters more clear I will recapitulate as follows:\r\n\r\n(1). _We often meet with pederasty without a trace of inversion of the\r\nsexual appetite. It is also practiced on women by the psychopathic\r\nmale. But the normal man hardly ever prefers it to normal coitus._\r\n\r\n(2). _Compensatory masturbation is very common and ceases with the\r\nopportunity for normal coitus._\r\n\r\n(3). _Sodomy is also often compensatory._\r\n\r\n(4). _It is the same with assaults on children, which seldom depend on\r\na hereditary disposition._\r\n\r\n(5). _Lesbian love, a form of degeneracy, artificial excitation of the\r\nclitoris by the tongue or otherwise, may have quite a different origin\r\nthan from sexual inversion or other perversions._\r\n\r\nAll these things take place chiefly in brothels or with prostitutes,\r\nin barracks, boarding-schools, convents, and other isolated places\r\nwhere men and women live alone and separated from the other sex.\r\n\r\nSadism, masochism, fetichism and exhibitionism are much more rarely\r\nthe result of habits, because their object and the images with which\r\nthey are associated do not offer compensation for the normal\r\nexcitation of the sexual appetite, or only do so insufficiently.\r\n\r\nI am here obliged to contradict Krafft-Ebing, who regards\r\nexhibitionism as the effect of the impotence of certain individuals\r\ndepraved by excesses, or as the unconscious act of certain epileptics.\r\nNo doubt the two conditions which he mentions may present themselves,\r\nbut the exhibitionists I have observed have all been psychopaths whose\r\nperversion was primordial and hereditary, with the exception of some\r\nfemales in whom perversion originated in suggestion or alcoholism,\r\nwhich had at any rate aroused the disposition.\r\n\r\nLesbian love merits special mention. Owing to the clitoris being more\r\nor less concealed, women are often not satisfied by coitus, especially\r\nwhen the ejaculation of the male takes place too quickly. Consequently\r\na number of normal women prefer to procure an orgasm by means of\r\nlesbian love (_cunnilingus_.) There are clubs of female perverts, many\r\nof whom are not homosexual by heredity.\r\n\r\nAlthough they differ from hereditary perversions, acquired perversions\r\nare connected with the former by a series of latent hereditary\r\ndispositions, more or less marked, and often difficult to distinguish\r\nin particular cases, especially when suggestion is blended with them.\r\n\r\nAmong the entirely hereditary and congenital sexual perversions, many\r\noccur in individuals who are well conducted and often possessed of\r\ndelicate and altruistic sentiments. This point is not sufficiently\r\nrecognized. Such persons are nearly always more or less neurotic in\r\nother respects. They are disheartened by their perversion and are so\r\nmuch ashamed of it that they often prefer to carry their secret to the\r\ngrave rather than confide it to their doctor.\r\n\r\nOthers sometimes confess to a doctor, and the life of a martyr, who\r\nis always contemplating suicide, is revealed to him. Individuals of\r\nfeeble, cynical, egoistic or abnormal natures, whose number is legion\r\nin the corrupt centers of modern civilization, yield to their\r\nperversion and often come before the tribunals, or else become objects\r\nof public contempt. As it is this class which generally become known,\r\nit is assumed by too hasty generalization that sexual perverts are\r\nnecessarily cynical, vicious or weak-minded individuals; but this\r\ninduction is false. It is unfortunately impossible to estimate the\r\nnumber of sexual perversions dissimulated by a large number of\r\npessimists of both sexes, generally celibate and usually males.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend that, when sexual perversion is neither hereditary\r\nnor favored by a latent hereditary predisposition, nor developed or\r\nfixed by alcoholism, it is usually possible to cure it by suggestion.\r\nThis often acts even in cases where alcohol has aroused a hereditary\r\ntaint. The incorrigible recidivists among the sexual perverts are, I\r\nam convinced, either hereditary or strongly predisposed, or\r\ndegenerated by alcoholism. The original will power of the pervert is\r\nalso of great importance. Weak-willed perverts always tend to relapse.\r\n\r\nThe social sanitation of sexual intercourse would certainly reduce to\r\na minimum the compensatory perversions of normal persons who abstain\r\nfrom alcohol. The prohibition of alcoholic drink would definitely\r\neliminate not only the perversions directly due to alcohol, but\r\ngradually also those due to alcoholic blastophthoria in the\r\ndescendants. Other hereditary perversions, not of alcoholic origin,\r\ncan only be definitely eliminated by healthy selection.\r\n\r\nPerversions acquired by suggestion or auto-suggestion should be\r\ncombated by suppression of the depraved examples which cause them, as\r\nwell as by treatment by suggestion. It is needless to say that sexual\r\nperverts should always abstain from alcoholic drinks.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] English translation by F.J.

Cerebral Activity. Consciousness. Subconsciousness and\r\nAmnesia. Auto-suggestion.=--The explanation of the phenomena of\r\nhypnotism and suggestion by Liébeault and Bernheim has been a\r\nveritable scientific revelation for human psychology. Unfortunately it\r\nhas remained to a great extent unknown to the public and the majority\r\nof medical men and jurists. Even at the present day, this subject is\r\nregarded either in the light of magic and occult phenomena, or as\r\nbeing connected with imposture and charlatanism. This results from the\r\nincapacity of most men to think in a psychological and philosophical\r\nmanner, to observe for themselves and to take into account the\r\nconnection which exists between the mind and cerebral activity.\r\n\r\nI must point out the common error of many physicians, who do not\r\nunderstand the psychological nature of hypnotism, and who place it,\r\nlike Dubois, in antinomy with psychotherapy. Hypnotism and suggestion\r\nin the waking state are one and the same thing; but what the\r\nphysicians I have mentioned understand by suggestion in the waking\r\nstate--psychotherapy, action by will power, etc.--is only a chaos of\r\nmisapplied terms and psychological phenomena, only half understood by\r\nthem. Sleep by suggestion is only one of the phenomena of suggestion.\r\n\r\nI must refer the reader to Bernheim's book on \"_La Suggestion et ses\r\nApplications à la Thérapeutique_,\" and to my book on hypnotism (\"_Der\r\nHypnotismus und die Suggestive Psychotherapie._\" Stuttgart, 1902), for\r\nI cannot enter into the details here. I will, however, attempt to make\r\nclear the action of suggestion in order to explain its connection with\r\nthe sexual sensations and sentiments.\r\n\r\nSuggestion consists in the action of ideas or representations on the\r\nactivity of the brain in general, and on some of its activities in\r\nparticular. The terms _idea-force_ and _ideoplasty_ have been\r\nemployed; but all ideas are at the same time forces and are more or\r\nless ideoplastic according to the nature and intensity of the cerebral\r\nactivity which corresponds to them. Every representation which appears\r\nin our consciousness is at the same time a cerebral activity. I will\r\nexplain by the aid of an example the relation which exists between the\r\nplay of our _conscious_ ideas and what is incorrectly called our\r\n_unconscious_ cerebral activity.\r\n\r\nFor reasons which are too long to explain here, I call _subconscious_\r\nall which is usually called unconscious, because I maintain that there\r\nis probably nothing unconscious in our nervous activity, and that what\r\nappears to be so is in reality accompanied by an introspection,\r\nsubordinated like its corresponding activity to the great and clear\r\nintrospection of the higher brain, which accompanies the concentrated\r\nand mobile activity of what we call our attention in the waking state.\r\nNo doubt, we do not as a rule perceive our subconscious activities,\r\nfor want of sufficient intensity in their association with the series\r\nof aperceptions (states subsequent to attentional activity). But we\r\npossess a number of observations, due especially to hypnotism, which\r\nallow us to infer by analogy the existence of subordinated\r\nintrospections corresponding to the cerebral activities which appear\r\nto us unconscious.\r\n\r\nFor example, I think of my wife. This idea immediately calls to mind\r\nthat of a journey that I intend to take with her, and in its turn the\r\nidea of the journey recalls that of the trunk I shall use to pack my\r\neffects. Almost as rapidly as lightning, the three ideas: (1) my wife;\r\n(2) the journey; (3) the trunk, apparently succeed each other in my\r\nconsciousness. But, according to the old scholasticism, the idea of\r\nthe journey is awakened by that of my wife, and that of my trunk by\r\nthat of the journey, which would, therefore, be its \"cause.\" But a\r\nlittle observation soon shows that the succession of our conscious\r\nideas is not so easily explained, for at every moment representations\r\nappear which have no logical relation to those which precede them,\r\nand cannot be caused by them, nor by immediate sensory perceptions\r\ncoming from without.\r\n\r\nAt a time when the activity of the brain was not understood, the\r\nexistence of an essential mind and a free will were assumed,\r\nindependent of the law of the conservation of energy and of the law of\r\ncausality, independent therefore of the brain, the activity of which\r\nthey commanded more or less at their pleasure. This conception is\r\nbased on ignorance of the facts.\r\n\r\nLet us return to our example: why does the idea of my wife call to\r\nmind that of the journey? It might quite as well suggest others. In\r\nreality, a number of ideas, or subconscious cerebral activities, act\r\nat the same time as that of my wife to give rise to the idea of the\r\njourney. This journey had already been decided on before thinking of\r\nit at the moment in question, and the resolution that I had taken to\r\nmake it had left in my brain latent impressions (engrams) which\r\nslumbered there; such as those of the date of departure, the duration\r\nof the journey, its termination, precautions to be taken for the house\r\nduring our absence, things to take with us, expenses, etc., etc.\r\nDuring the infinitely short time when the idea of journey appears in\r\nmy consciousness, between that of my wife and that of my trunk, I have\r\nno consciousness of all these things. They are, however, closely\r\nassociated with the idea of journey, and in connection with it by the\r\nthousand threads of a subconscious and latent cerebral force which\r\ntakes place in my cerebral nerve-elements (neurones); and it is their\r\nhidden action which awakens the idea of journey and directs my\r\nattention to it, at the same time weakening by their divers\r\ninterferences the intensity of other associated engrams; in particular\r\nthat of the sentiment of traveling, and thereby preventing a series of\r\nideo-motor sensations relating to departure from becoming predominant.\r\n\r\nWhat suddenly appears in my consciousness is the verbal representation\r\nsymbolized by the word _journey_; a general representation of\r\nsynthetic nature, and consequently nebulous. It is the words of\r\nlanguage only which allow me to synthetize a general idea in a short\r\nand definite form. Thus, the cerebral flash _journey_ which follows\r\nthe idea of my wife is not caused by the latter idea alone; it has\r\nbeen mainly drawn from its obscurity and brought before the mobile\r\nconscious attention, by the action of the thousand subconscious\r\nthreads, some of which we have just mentioned, and which have at the\r\nsame time determined its quality.\r\n\r\nWithout my being aware of it, these dynamic threads, or latent\r\nengrams, have to a great extent determined the kind of idea which will\r\nfollow that of _journey_, and which will seem to me to be caused by\r\nthis last alone, namely the idea of _trunk_. The idea of journey might\r\nequally well have awakened other images, such as those of the\r\nacquaintances whom I should meet, or of the town I intended to visit.\r\nWhy that of the trunk? This is simply because the care of the effects\r\nto be taken, the place they should occupy, etc., revolved\r\nunconsciously but strongly in my brain, and for the moment\r\npredominated over other subconscious associations.\r\n\r\nThis simple example shows us that in reality the three successive\r\nideas, _wife_, _journey_, _trunk_, are more under the influence of\r\nsentiments, representations and former volitions in a latent and\r\nsubconscious state, than dependent on each other. But these latter\r\nactivities are themselves the product of other antecedent activities\r\nof my brain, extraordinarily diverse and complex. I will attempt to\r\nmake things a little more complete and comprehensible by the aid of a\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nA man finds himself in the middle of a compact and moving crowd. He\r\ncries out to attract the attention of the crowd. His voice is heard by\r\nthose immediately around him, but is lost on the moving mass. Against\r\nhis will he is carried away by the crowd in the direction of the\r\nstrongest movement. But if the crowd is immobile and tranquil the same\r\nman may make himself heard, and may even force his way through the\r\ncrowd and impel it in his turn by the impression that his words have\r\nmade on it.\r\n\r\nSomething analogous to this occurs in the action of an idea according\r\nas it is produced in a brain which is awake, active and strongly\r\nassociated, or on the contrary in a brain which rests and sleeps. The\r\nbrain which is active and strongly associated resembles the agitated\r\ncrowd which carries away everything by its activity. In this case a\r\nsingle idea, like a single man, cries out in vain, _i.e._, is produced\r\nstrongly; it will not impel, but will be carried away or stifled,\r\nunless it already possesses, by the former remembrances (engrams)\r\nwhich it may revive, a particular power over the brain. It is the same\r\nwith the agitated crowd; if the man who cries out is already known and\r\nhas influence and power, he may arrest it and even bring it toward the\r\ncenter of his agitation. The brain which is at rest or sleeping,\r\n_i.e._, feebly associated and not active, resembles the immobile\r\ncrowd. Even when it is new and has not yet become fixed in the memory,\r\nan idea may produce a deep impression, and awaken activities in its\r\nown direction. I repeat, if this idea has already acted more or less\r\npowerfully on the cerebral activity that it has often carried with it,\r\nit has accustomed this to follow it (_i.e._, fortified the engrams and\r\nfacilitated their ecphoria), and then the powerful associated engrams\r\nwhich it has left in the organ of thought, will often be capable of\r\ncarrying everything with them, even to the center of the agitation.\r\n\r\nIn this way I succeeded in suddenly calming by hypnotism a woman who\r\nwas mad with despair over the tragic death of half her family in a\r\nfire, by the simple fact that I had often hypnotized her previously.\r\nImmediately after the hypnosis she went away quietly to the place of\r\nthe disaster and was the only one to keep her presence of mind and put\r\nthings in order.\r\n\r\nI refer the reader to what has been said concerning the mneme (Chapter\r\nI). Semon's theory throws light on these questions.\r\n\r\nThe first thing necessary for suggestion or hypnotism is to put the\r\nbrain of the subject in a state of relative repose, so as to prepare a\r\nsoil ready to receive suggestions. These are then made so as to always\r\nincrease the cerebral repose, in order to weaken the action of the\r\nthreads of subconscious association of which we have spoken above.\r\nLastly, the suggestion (or idea which symbolizes the effect it is\r\ndesired to obtain) is accentuated as much as possible, and in a form\r\nwhich at once excludes all contradiction. For this purpose everything\r\nshould be utilized--sentiments and associations which are easily\r\nintroduced, agreeable or repulsive sensations, volitions, etc. Nothing\r\nparalyzes a suggestive effect so much as emotions, violent sentiments\r\nin general, inclinations, or repulsions which act in the opposite\r\ndirection, whether they arise from fear, despair, hatred, sadness,\r\njoy, love or any kind of affective conditions. The same brain,\r\naccessible to all kinds of suggestions, will repress some of them as\r\nsoon as it feels a deep sympathy for their contrary. We may suggest in\r\nvain to an amorous woman, the hatred or disgust of her lover, for the\r\nsentiment of love is stronger than the effect of a strange suggestion,\r\nand every suggestion which opposes the strongest aspirations of\r\nsentiment provokes mistrust and repulsion, which in their turn destroy\r\nall suggestive power.\r\n\r\nAs we have indicated in our comparison, every suggestion which has\r\nsucceeded leaves a strong trace, or engram, in the brain. It has\r\nopened a way by breaking down a barrier or a chasm, and its effect,\r\nwhich appeared hitherto difficult or impossible to realize, will\r\nhenceforth be much more easy to obtain. This is why considerable\r\ncerebral repose is often necessary at first to open a way for a\r\nsuggestion, while later on its effect can often be obtained even\r\nduring the agitation of cerebral activity strongly associated with or\r\neven led by violent momentary sentiments.\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristic of suggestive action, is that it traverses\r\nthe paths of subconscious activity, so that its effect occurs\r\nunexpectedly in our consciousness.\r\n\r\nFor example, I suggest to a man that his forehead itches. As soon as\r\nhe feels it he is surprised, being unable to understand how my\r\nprophecy has been transformed into real itching. He then believes in\r\nmy power over his nervous system, _i.e._, that his brain becomes more\r\nreceptive to my words, and offers less resistance after having proved\r\nthe value of my predictions. It matters little whether these are\r\ndirected toward sensations or movements, or vaso-motor actions causing\r\nblushing and blanching, or suppression or bringing on of menstruation\r\n(in the case of a woman), etc. My influence over him by suggestion\r\nwill increase; _i.e._, his brain will accustom itself to the\r\nsuggestions which I give it by letting them dissociate its activity.\r\nThis tendency to be influenced by suggestion is very contagious by\r\nexample. When A influences B successfully, and C, D, E, F and G are\r\nwitnesses of the fact, they will be much more easily influenced by A\r\nin the same direction; and so on. This explains suggestion affecting\r\nthe masses.\r\n\r\nIt is quite indifferent whether the subjective sentiment of sleep\r\noccurs more or less in the state of hypnosis or suggestion. This\r\nsentiment depends chiefly on the presence or absence of a variable\r\ndegree of amnesia (want of memory to awaken). But amnesia only depends\r\non the rupture, often fortuitous and unimportant, of the chain of\r\nremembrances in the series of super-conscious or attentional states of\r\ncerebral activity.\r\n\r\nIn somnambulists, who are the most suggestible people, we can produce\r\nor suppress amnesia at will by a single word, and make them forget or\r\nremember what has passed. I must dwell on this point, because of the\r\ncurrent dogma which assumes an essential difference between hypnotism\r\nand suggestion in the waking state. Such an assumption is based on\r\nfalse conception of the psychology of suggestion. The only difference\r\nconsists in the suggestion of amnesia, or the subjective sentiment of\r\nsleep; or, if one prefers it, the subjective remembrance of sleep\r\nopposed to the remembrance of having been awakened. But these two\r\nremembrances may be voluntarily connected with the same past state of\r\nthe brain.\r\n\r\nBy _auto-suggestion_ is meant the suggestive action of spontaneous\r\nideas--that is to say, ideas which are not suggested to the subject by\r\nany other person, but the effect of which is identical to that of\r\nexternal suggestions. An idea, a sentiment, dominates the mind,\r\novercomes all its antagonists and produces a strong suggestive effect\r\non the whole nervous system in the direction which it symbolizes. The\r\nidea of being unable to sleep often produces insomnia; the idea of\r\nsexual impotence may at once inhibit erection and render coitus\r\nimpossible. The idea of yawning makes one yawn; that of coitus\r\nprovokes erections; the idea of shame causes blushing; that of fear\r\nblanching; that of pity weeping.\r\n\r\nBut it often happens unconsciously, in yawning for example, that one\r\nman suggests it to another who begins to yawn; or the sight of certain\r\nobjects, the hearing of certain sounds, provokes suggestions. Thus the\r\nsight of an object belonging to a certain woman may cause an erection;\r\nthe odor of some article of diet which has caused indigestion is\r\nsufficient to cause nausea, etc. We thus see that there is a series of\r\ntransitions between external intentional suggestion and\r\nauto-suggestion, in the form of suggestion of objects and unconscious\r\nor involuntary suggestion of persons. The conception of true or\r\nintentional suggestion infers the determined will of one man\r\ninfluencing another by suggestion; there is no other criterion.\r\n\r\nIt is quite another question whether the one who suggests wishes to\r\nbenefit his subject, or wishes on the contrary to abuse him or make\r\nhim ridiculous.\r\n\r\n=Sympathy. Love and Suggestion.=--It is of great importance for us to\r\nknow that sympathy and confidence are the fundamental elements of\r\nsuccess in suggestive action. Even when deceived by the one who\r\nhypnotizes him, the subject may yield to him while he is not aware of\r\nit. But there is here a point to be noted. A man may very well see\r\nclearly with his reason and his logic, he may understand that harm is\r\ndone to him, he may even curse a thing or a person when he reflects,\r\nand in spite of this be instinctively and subconsciously attracted\r\ntoward this thing or this person, like a moth to a candle, when\r\ncertain sentiments of sympathy or attraction urge him to it. The two\r\nfollowing examples will make this more clear:\r\n\r\n    (1). An actor fell in love with a hysterical married woman. This\r\n    woman was very polyandrous, and deceived not only her husband\r\n    but the actor and many others. The actor tried with all the\r\n    power of his reason to be delivered from the tyrannical charm of\r\n    this siren; but the power of attraction of the woman was so\r\n    strong that he could not succeed in resisting her. He came to me\r\n    in despair and begged me to rid him of his passion by hypnotism.\r\n    I realized the difficulty of the situation but did my best to\r\n    help him. Although aided by his reason, all my suggestions were\r\n    overcome by the violence of the passion that his hysterical\r\n    seducer had inspired in him, and I obtained absolutely no\r\n    result.\r\n\r\n    (2). A well-educated, unmarried woman became so enamored of a\r\n    young man, that she was consumed with passion, grew thin, and\r\n    lost her appetite and sleep. Having exchanged ideas with the\r\n    young man for some time, she became convinced that their two\r\n    characters were not suited to each other, and that\r\n    incompatibility of temper and quarrels would necessarily follow\r\n    marriage. She therefore resisted with all her power and came to\r\n    me to be cured of her passion by suggestion. My failure in the\r\n    preceding case increased my skepticism, but I did my best to\r\n    succeed; the result, however, was no better than with the actor\r\n    in the preceding case. Time and separation alone gradually\r\n    restored equilibrium in this lady's nervous system.\r\n\r\nThese two cases are very instructive. Suggestion can only successfully\r\ncombat powerful sentiments by arousing other sentiments of sympathy\r\nwhich increase little by little and finally become substituted for the\r\npreceding ones. This brings us to a very difficult question.\r\n\r\nIn order to influence other persons by suggestion, it is above all\r\nthings necessary to try and associate the ideas which we suggest to\r\nthem with sentiments of sympathy, so as to arouse in them the\r\nimpression that the object to be attained is desirable and agreeable,\r\nor at any rate that it constitutes a necessity. The woman who\r\nsurrenders to the mercy of her conqueror often experiences a kind of\r\npleasure which is associated with the passiveness of her sexual\r\nsentiments. It is the same in the male masochist.\r\n\r\nThe physician who hypnotizes is obliged to awaken sentiments of\r\nsympathy in his subject to combat with their assistance the sentiments\r\nassociated with the morbid state which it is desired to suppress. This\r\nis usually free from danger when there is no natural sexual attraction\r\nbetween the hypnotizer and the hypnotized; when, for example, a normal\r\nman hypnotizes another man, a normal woman another woman, or an invert\r\nanother invert. Otherwise there is a risk of exciting sexual\r\nsympathies difficult to eliminate afterwards, when necessary\r\nprecautions have not been taken at first. These attractive sexual\r\nsensations or sentiments may affect both the hypnotizer and the\r\nhypnotized and provoke love scenes, which are fatal to success.\r\n\r\nFor example, a hysterical baroness, whose sexual desire had been\r\nexcited by hypnotism, fell in love with a person named Czinsky, whose\r\ncase was studied and published by Schrenck-Notzing. This baroness\r\nexperienced a kind of suggested love against which her reason resisted\r\nto a certain extent, while her hypnotizer, himself amorous, lost his\r\nhead. One might say in such a case that suggestion only reënforced the\r\nvery human sentiments which occur in all love stories of everyday\r\nlife. Between normal love and suggested love there is such an infinite\r\nnumber of gradations that it is impossible to fix exactly the limits\r\nwhich separate them.\r\n\r\nA hypnotizer may abuse his suggestive power to exploit the love of the\r\nhypnotized. I have been consulted in a case where an old woman had\r\nhypnotized a rich young man and had so powerfully influenced him that\r\nhe abandoned his family and married her. As in the case of Czinsky,\r\nthe abuse was obvious. The case was even more grave, for this old\r\nwoman acted only from mercenary motives; in fact, she procured young\r\ngirls for her husband, so as not to lose her suggestive influence\r\nafter marriage: Czinsky, on the contrary, was truly amorous.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule we may say that, when amorous intoxication is the\r\nresult of intentional suggestion, the subject obeys a certain\r\nsentiment of constraint, which he may describe later on when he has\r\nsucceeded in recovering himself. He feels a kind of duplication of his\r\npersonality, and perceives that the excitation of his sexual desire,\r\nas well as his love, have a somewhat forced nature, against which his\r\nreason attempts to defend him. This reaction often only appears\r\nafterwards, when the sympathetic action of suggestion begins to fade.\r\n\r\nHere again the gradations are infinite, and no absolute rules can be\r\nformulated, for if the hypnotizer is very skillful and does not let\r\nhis intentions appear, the subjective sentiment of constraint may be\r\nabsolutely wanting; _i.e._, never become conscious. If, however, the\r\nhypnotizer is clumsy and the subject a hysterical woman, love is often\r\ntransformed into hatred in the latter soon afterwards, as is so often\r\nthe case in these subjects, and she may afterwards be convinced by\r\nauto-suggestion that she was the object of artificial constraint or\r\neven violence, and describe imaginary or unnatural events as if they\r\nwere real; while she was simply amorous after the fashion of\r\nhysterical subjects.\r\n\r\nIt is quite otherwise with cases where a hypnotizer produces in a\r\nhypnotized woman a state of deep somnambulism and does harm to her\r\nwithout her knowledge. Here the victim is absolutely without will, and\r\nincapable of resisting. These last cases are much more easy to decide,\r\nespecially from the legal point of view; but, as far as we are now\r\nconcerned, the first cases are the most important.\r\n\r\nThe amorous irradiations produced by the sexual appetite react on the\r\nlatter and increase it. They awaken sentiments of reciprocal sympathy,\r\nfrom which results a mutual attraction similar to that of animals.\r\nSuggestive action depends on the mastery we obtain over the associated\r\nconstellations of subconscious engrams, and we have already become\r\nacquainted with the phylogenetic and actual relationship which exists\r\nbetween sexual sensations and sensations of sympathy. The simple\r\njuxtaposition of these facts clearly shows that powerful affinities\r\nexist between suggestion and love. I use the word \"affinity\"\r\nadvisedly, for we must not go further and regard the two things as\r\nidentical. Fortunately, the majority of curable patients may be cured\r\nby the prudent awakening of a slight degree of sympathy, and by the\r\ncommon efforts made by the hypnotizer and the hypnotized to subdue the\r\nmorbid symptoms, without anything but a certain sentiment of\r\nreciprocal friendship resulting. On the other hand two human beings\r\nmay be united by sexual love, without either being able to hypnotize\r\nthe other. This is especially the case when, for example, two\r\nconjoints have known each other for many years, or when two persons of\r\nhigher intelligence, who are not too dependent on their sexual\r\nintercourse, meet each other.\r\n\r\nI am obliged to dwell on these facts, so that my ideas may not be\r\nfalsely interpreted, by premature generalization. On the other hand,\r\nwhen a strongly associated brain suggests to a weak brain of the\r\nopposite sex sentiments of sympathy and makes use of them to arouse\r\nthe sexual appetite, it may produce a suggested love which closely\r\nresembles natural amorous intoxication. If the discovery of an\r\nimposture or abuse of power on the part of the hypnotizer weakens or\r\ndestroys the effect of suggestion, the hypnotized subject recovers\r\nherself. Despite and repentance may then transform her love into\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\nIn other cases there is a struggle between sexual desire and the\r\ndisillusion of a deceived love, which often serves as the tragic\r\nmotive in romance and the drama. The following is a typical case of\r\nsuggested love without formal hypnotic proceedings:\r\n\r\n    An old _roué_ aged sixty, married and the father of a family,\r\n    persecuted a very suggestible young girl with his attentions,\r\n    and systematically seduced her by means of erotic readings. He\r\n    produced such an impression on this young girl that she became\r\n    hypnotized and fell in love with the old _roué_ She lost all\r\n    conscience, became deceitful and untruthful by suggestion, and\r\n    compromised herself and her family. Her seducer was poor, so\r\n    that it was not his fortune that attracted her. She knew very\r\n    well that this union could lead to nothing, but could not\r\n    resist, and eloped with him. Later on she came to her senses and\r\n    left him.\r\n\r\nAccording to an old proverb, young girls laugh at old men and only\r\nmarry them reluctantly or for their money; but in reality this is by\r\nno means always true.\r\n\r\n=Amorous Intoxication.=--Let us now compare these phenomena with those\r\nof ordinary life called _amorous intoxication_. The affinities are at\r\nonce apparent. A man and a woman meet and take a fancy for each other.\r\nThe reciprocal action of looks, speech and touch, in fact all the\r\napparatus of the senses and the mind, awakens in both of them\r\nsentiments of sympathy and sexual desire which mutually strengthens\r\neach other. Sexual desire invests every action and appearance of the\r\nloved object with an ever-increasing halo of charm and splendor, and\r\nthis halo of sexual origin increases in its turn the sentiments of\r\nsympathy; and the sentiments of sympathy increase the sexual desire.\r\nIn this way mutual suggestions grow like a snowball, and rapidly\r\nattain the culminating point of amorous intoxication, or what is\r\ncalled being _madly in love_.\r\n\r\nAll this depends only on reciprocal illusion. The more violent and\r\nfoolish the amorous intoxication, without preparation or reflexion,\r\nand the less the individuals know each other, the more rapidly these\r\nillusions collapse, like a castle of cards, as soon as some douche of\r\ncold water sobers the two lovers. Thus indifference, disgust, and even\r\nhatred, follow \"love.\"\r\n\r\nThe suggestive element in love is here apparent. Just as a hypnotized\r\nperson will eagerly swallow a raw potato which he takes for an orange;\r\nso will a person madly in love regard an ugly or wicked girl as a\r\ngoddess, or an amorous girl find her ideal of chivalry and manliness\r\nin an egoistic Don Juan.\r\n\r\nThe affinity is still more evident when the amorous intoxication is\r\nonly on one side, while the other plays the part of seducer. When\r\nmotives of pecuniary interest are not the only cause of seduction, and\r\neven often when they are, the seducer generally brings into play his\r\nsexual appetite, but only as a collaborator in his work of seduction\r\nwithout allowing himself to be dominated by it. In this case one is\r\nthe seducer and the other the seduced. The seducer plays the part of\r\nthe hypnotizer who suggests, while the seduced plays the part of the\r\nhypnotized, unless the seduction is due to fear, weakness of mind or\r\ngood nature. The seducer is no doubt more or less under erotic\r\ninfluence, but never completely. The seduced, on the contrary, falls\r\ncompletely under the power of the seducer. The thoughts, sentiments\r\nand will are all directed by the impulses of the seducer. The latter\r\nacquires his ascendancy by means of a kind of suggestive power, often\r\nassisted by the sexual appetite.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the seduced gives way by pure suggestion of love without\r\nsexual desire. These are precisely the cases that the law does not\r\nforesee, and jurists cannot usually understand. In ordinary life, the\r\nman most often plays the part of seducer or hypnotizer; but this is\r\nnot always the case. Antony, who threw himself at the feet of\r\nCleopatra and obeyed her least gesture, was evidently hypnotized.\r\nAntonys are not rare even at the present day; but they do not\r\nconstitute the rule, nor the normal state.\r\n\r\nAs we have just described it, suggestion plays a great role in love,\r\nand explains to a great extent the phenomena of illusion produced by\r\namorous intoxication. In spite of the act which deifies it and the\r\necstatic happiness that accompanies it, we must admit that amorous\r\nintoxication, with its illusory suggestions uncontrolled by reason,\r\nbrings more poison than true happiness into human life. I will attempt\r\nto explain the matter more clearly. When two human beings with loyal\r\ninstincts have learned to know each other sufficiently, honestly\r\navowing their reciprocal feelings and their past life, at the same\r\ntime subduing their sensual appetites and judging the latter with\r\ncalmness, so as to be convinced that they may reasonably hope to form\r\na durable and happy union, then only may they abandon themselves to\r\namorous intoxication, but not before. The fact that the latter makes\r\neach lover appear to the other in the most ideal light only serves to\r\nstrengthen the feelings of sympathy and make them last for life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, two egoists calculating coldly, even if they have\r\nstrong sexual appetites and trouble themselves very little with\r\nreflections on their intellect, may contract a comparatively happy\r\nmarriage, based simply on reciprocal convenience and interest; a\r\nmarriage in which amorous intoxication only plays a very small part,\r\nor none at all.\r\n\r\nThe latter case is of great frequency. The novel which delights in the\r\ndescription of admirable or ignoble sentiments, and which shows a\r\nspecial preference for bizarre and sensational situations, often of a\r\npathological nature, makes us forget that the majority of mediocre and\r\nnormal men are little susceptible to the suggestions of amorous\r\nintoxication, and that they give vent to their sexual desires in a\r\nmore or less reflective and calculating frame of mind, like a\r\n_gourmand_. This is not poetical, I admit, but it is much more human.\r\nMany women also become _gourmands_ in sexual matters.\r\n\r\nIn all this sexual commerce there are only vestiges or caricatures of\r\nthe poetry of amorous intoxication. It is no longer a question of deep\r\nlove, but of essentially commonplace sexual enjoyment, wisely and\r\nprudently adapted to other objects of concupiscence, such as money,\r\nsocial position, titles, business, etc.\r\n\r\nIf the poets and the preachers of morality apostrophize me with\r\nindignation saying that this is the prostitution of love, I shall be\r\nobliged to protest. So long as sexual enjoyment is not bought, there\r\nis no prostitution. Man has as much right to a certain agreeable\r\nsatisfaction of his sexual appetite, even without exalted sentiments,\r\nas he has to satisfy his hunger and thirst, as long as he does no harm\r\nto anyone. But, I repeat, this question has nothing to do with amorous\r\nintoxication. The latter is a powerful shock to the whole mind, to the\r\nprincipal spheres of cerebral activity, by a suggestive effect,\r\nusually with the aid of the sexual appetite, but sometimes without\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAmorous intoxication naturally differs in quality and in intensity in\r\ndifferent individuals. In a person with ideal tendencies it may awaken\r\nthe finest harmonies of the symphony of human sentiments, while brutal\r\nand debased persons may wallow in the mud.\r\n\r\n=Suggestion in Art.=--Suggestion does not act only in the sexual\r\nsphere, but on the whole mental life. In æsthetics and in art it has\r\nan immense and irresistible influence, which gives rise to all the\r\ncapricious exaltations of fashion. The average artist is more or less\r\nthe slave of the æsthetic suggestions which are in fashion, but the\r\naverage members of the public are absolutely dominated by them.\r\nOriginating in a correct idea of certain effects of light, the most\r\nabsurd exaggerations may become accepted as beautiful and natural by\r\nan imitative public devoid of personal judgment, by the aid of\r\nsuggestion. These deplorable effects of suggestion may last a long\r\ntime till their nullity or their absurdity causes them gradually to\r\ndisappear. But they are usually replaced by other absurdities.\r\n\r\n=Suggestive Action in Sexual Anomalies.=--In very suggestible persons\r\nthe sexual appetite may be easily led astray by sensory impressions\r\ncreated by perverse images. In this way the erotic imagination of a\r\nvery suggestible boy, excited indirectly by another boy, may even make\r\nthe latter the object of his sexual desire. This is how homosexual\r\ninclinations may be formed by suggestion and maintained by mutual\r\nmasturbation, pederasty, etc. The duration of a perversion of this\r\nkind often depends on the power of the erotic image which suggested\r\nsexual desire. This is also the case with onanism, sodomy, etc.; and\r\nin the inverse direction with impotence.\r\n\r\nThese facts explain at the same time why and how suggestion may cure\r\nor ameliorate the anomalies of sexual life. Just as suggestion may\r\nexcite or pervert the sexual appetite, so may it calm it and put it in\r\nthe right direction, unless there is a deeply rooted hereditary\r\nperversion. We can nearly always considerably attenuate too-frequent\r\nemissions, masturbation and perversions by suggestion, and often\r\nentirely cure their acquired forms.\r\n\r\nI must here point out that when we have succeeded in removing by\r\nsuggestion a perversion based in whole or in part on organic or\r\nhereditary causes, this result is always more or less precarious, and\r\ndoes not give the physician the right to give his sanction to\r\nmarriage. The following case shows us what prudence on the part of the\r\nhypnotizer can do with patients of this kind:\r\n\r\n    A young girl, of good education, was troubled with intense\r\n    sexual desire. She was incapable of resisting masturbation and\r\n    dreamed at night that men and animals were in contact with her\r\n    vulva. These dreams caused intense excitement and were\r\n    accompanied by orgasms. The treatment of a patient of this kind\r\n    by suggestion was no easy matter. However, with the aid of a\r\n    local sedative, the action of which it is needless to say was\r\n    purely suggestive and was combined with appropriate verbal\r\n    suggestions, I succeeded not only in suppressing the onanism,\r\n    but also in almost completely curing the nervous exhaustion of\r\n    this young girl, so that she was afterwards able to resume work.\r\n\r\nI may add that the patient was hypnotized in the presence of others,\r\nwhich can always be done in such cases with a little tact. This is a\r\nrule from which the physician should never depart.\r\n\r\nI cannot enter into more details on this subject, but what I have said\r\nwill suffice to draw the attention of my readers to the action of\r\nsuggestion in the sexual appetite and in love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE SEXUAL QUESTION IN RELATION TO MONEY AND PROPERTY PROSTITUTION,\r\nPROXENETISM AND VENAL CONCUBINAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS\r\n\r\nIn Chapter VI we have studied the historical development of human\r\nmarriage as a continuation of the phylogeny of our species, and we\r\nhave shown that marriage by purchase and different forms of polygamy\r\nconstitute a kind of intermediate stage and at the same time an\r\naberration of civilization, which has resulted from the association of\r\nmen, combined with the birth of individual property.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider a being of high mentality and deeply rooted\r\nindividualism such as man, in whom the instinct of love and family are\r\nso strong, led by the inevitable force of circumstances to live in the\r\nsociety of his fellows, we can easily understand that certain\r\nindividuals of a higher mentality than the others will endeavor to\r\ndominate the weaker and less intelligent, and exploit them for their\r\nown profit and that of their family.\r\n\r\nAnalogous tendencies are seen in certain animals. Among the bees the\r\nold workers appropriate the produce of the work of others. Certain\r\nants practice a form of slavery, based, it is true on instinct, in\r\nstealing the pupæ of weaker species which, after hatching, become the\r\nservants of the idle robbers.\r\n\r\nIn incomplete animal societies, such as those of the ruminants,\r\ncertain monkeys, etc., the old males, sometimes also the more\r\ncourageous females (cows, for example) direct the herd and become\r\nrecognized as chiefs by the others. But in these cases the personal\r\nproperty of objects or even living beings takes no part, because the\r\nanimals have not yet learned its value.\r\n\r\nOther animals living isolated show the first tendencies toward\r\npersonal property; for example, the nest where they hoard their\r\nprovisions, while others, such as the ants, bees, wasps, etc., have\r\nthe sentiment of collective property well developed. For instance, a\r\nswarm of ants regards plants with grubs as its property, and defends\r\nthem in consequence.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he has attained a primitive degree of culture, man\r\ncomprehends that the possession, not only of land and the produce of\r\nwork, but also the persons of other men, may profit him; and this\r\nleads to slavery. The male being the stronger soon combines the\r\nsatisfaction of his sexual appetite with the advantage of property, by\r\nplacing the woman more and more under his dependence and exploiting\r\nher. In this way woman becomes an object for sale and exchange, which\r\nwill procure the purchaser, besides satisfaction for his sexual\r\nappetite, a docile slave and worker and a procreator of children, a\r\nsource of other workers.\r\n\r\nThis motive, so clearly revealed by ethnography and history,\r\nsufficiently explains the ignoble traffic that man has made of love,\r\nor rather of sexual appetite. We have seen in Chapter VI the profit\r\nmade by polygamous barbarians by the possession of many wives and\r\nchildren, which led more and more to the buying and selling of the\r\nlatter. These customs are instinctively related to the traffic of\r\nslaves. Our modern civilization has happily abolished these taints,\r\nbut money still influences our sexual life by measures which are\r\nhardly any better. The complication and refinement of civilized life\r\nhave made women and children objects of luxury, and not a source of\r\nwealth as in former times. This is due to two causes. On the one hand,\r\na wider and more humane conception of the social position of women and\r\nchildren has extended their rights. Man cannot now exploit them to the\r\nsame extent as in the time of patriarchism, while the father of the\r\nfamily has, on the contrary, the duty of maintaining his wife and\r\nfamily, and of giving the latter a proper education. Among the poor,\r\nthe exploitation of the wife and children still exists; but in the\r\ncase of the rich and cultured the inverse phenomenon is produced. With\r\nthe intention of making his family happy and distinguished, the father\r\nbrings it up in luxury and idleness, and this produces a very harmful\r\nresult. The increasing refinement of modern life and its pleasures\r\nleads to effeminacy. It bears upon the whole of society and\r\ndegenerates into an artificial desire for brilliancy and show, which\r\nmakes it increasingly difficult to obtain a simple and sober education\r\nfor the family. Men and women, especially the latter, do their best to\r\neclipse each other in their table, their toilet, the comfort and\r\nluxury of their apartments, their pleasures and distractions, their\r\nbanquets and _fêtes_. An enormous mass of the produce of human labor\r\nis thus dissipated in futilities, for the benefit of unbridled\r\nfrivolity and luxury. It is owing to this that a civilization which,\r\nthanks to science and progress, far surpasses all those which have\r\npreceded it in the richness of its means of production for the wants\r\nof humanity, not only shows more and more rich with superfluous\r\nwealth, but also more and more poor who vegetate from the want of it.\r\n\r\nWhat is still more grave is that, for reasons of economy, the\r\nintelligent, educated and cultured marry less often and procreate\r\nfewer children. Again, our descendants degenerate more and more, owing\r\nto the consumption of alcohol or other narcotics, and the unhealthy\r\nlife they lead. This degeneration is dissimulated by their\r\nwell-nourished appearance, but is revealed in their increasing\r\nneuropathic tendency. They become accustomed to a number of artificial\r\nwants, which make them increasingly difficult to satisfy. This results\r\nin their exacting from society much more than they give to it by their\r\nwork; whereas each ought to give to society more than he receives from\r\nit. As evil omens, I must mention the idleness of many women with\r\nregard to household and manual work. What are the effects of this\r\nstate of things on the sexual life of modern society? They are of\r\nthree kinds:\r\n\r\n(1) _Marriage for money_; (2) _prostitution_, exploited by\r\nproxenetism, and between the two (3) _venal concubinage_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE FOR MONEY\r\n\r\nMarriage for money is the modern form or derivative of marriage by\r\npurchase. Formerly one bought a wife and sold a daughter; to-day one\r\nis sold to a wife and buys a son-in-law. The improvement consists in\r\nthe fact that the buyer and the bought are no longer in the positions\r\nof proprietor and object possessed, respectively. Nevertheless,\r\nmarriage at the present day gives rise to much traffic, speculation\r\nand exploitation of an evil nature.\r\n\r\nThese things are so well known that I need not dwell upon them. In\r\nplace of love, force of character, capacity, harmony of sentiments,\r\nintellectual and bodily health, money is the _alpha et omega_ of\r\nmarriage. Money dazzles most men so that they are blind to everything\r\nelse. They no longer understand that the health and the physical and\r\nmoral worth of a woman constitute a capital which is far preferable to\r\nall the title-deeds deposited in the coffers of the future\r\nfather-in-law, which are rapidly squandered by children tainted with\r\nbad physical or mental heredity. In this way ignorance of the laws of\r\nheredity and the rapacity of pecuniary interests perpetually tend\r\ntoward the antisocial procreation of a degenerate posterity.\r\n\r\nInversely, a number of capable and healthy men and women remain\r\ncelibate and sterile for want of money. Capital exploits them as\r\nworkers and prevents them from reproducing their race; or else their\r\nown foresight induces them to avoid procreation.\r\n\r\nA characteristic sign is observed in military circles, especially in\r\nthe German army where officers who are not well-to-do are forbidden to\r\nmarry a woman unless she has a certain income. The officer must bring\r\nup his family in accordance with his position. This system, which it\r\nis sought to justify by all kinds of reasons, shows how the worship of\r\nthe golden calf and class prejudices may degenerate our manners and\r\ncustoms. Without fortune one cannot serve the country as an officer,\r\nor marry, except by selling oneself to a rich woman. In other terms,\r\nan officer cannot marry according to his own inclination unless he\r\npossesses a certain fortune. No doubt there are officers who marry for\r\nlove; nevertheless, they are not only obliged to have a certain\r\nfortune, but the woman they marry must have a certain social position\r\nand have been well educated. The wife of an officer has to take part\r\nin balls and official gatherings. She is forbidden to carry on openly\r\nany business, and her parents must not even be shopkeepers! In a\r\nGerman town, one of my relatives heard a rich mother say to her\r\ndaughter, who could not make up her mind to marry a gentleman who\r\nproposed to her: \"If you do not want him, let him go; we do not wish\r\nto persuade you. We have plenty of money, and if you want to marry\r\nlater on we can easily buy you an officer!\"\r\n\r\nIn the tyranny of class marriages, it is money which almost always\r\ndecides the question. Formerly birth and nobility were everything, and\r\nit was these which brought power and fortune; nowadays money has\r\nreplaced them, and has monopolized universal power. If an energetic\r\nand intelligent man revolts, by returning to modest and primitive\r\ncustoms, if he dresses simply, performs manual labor, takes his meals\r\nat the same table as his servants, etc., he is despised and is not\r\nreceived into what is called good society.\r\n\r\nIt is only up to a certain point, and with the exercise of great\r\nprudence, that any attempt can be made to react against the whirlwind\r\nof our unbridled luxury, and it is in marriage that this becomes most\r\ndelicate and most difficult. A well-brought-up and well-educated man\r\nwith no money, who wishes to marry while he is a student, so as to\r\navoid prostitution or other evils; who is content to live in humble\r\nquarters with his wife, each doing their own work, will have great\r\ndifficulty in finding a well-nurtured girl to consent to such an\r\narrangement. Everything has to be regulated according to the fashion,\r\ncustoms and prejudices of the class in which he lives, and this\r\nusually renders marriage impossible, as long as he has not what is\r\ncalled a position. But no one will blame the same student for living\r\nin concubinage with a grisette. Why cannot the same means of existence\r\nwhich allow concubinage suffice for marriage? With this question I\r\nonly touch on a problem to which we shall return, at the same time\r\npointing out the canker which corrupts our modern sexual life.\r\n\r\nBy marriage for money we understand marriage which is based on\r\ninterest and not on love. It is not always a question of money; for\r\nposition, name, titles and convenience often complicate the question.\r\nSometimes a ruined aristocrat marries a rich tradesman's daughter, in\r\norder to repair his fortune, while the vanity of his _fiancée_ makes a\r\ntitle a desirable acquisition. Sometimes a coquette, by clever\r\nflirtation, will simulate a love which she does not feel, to catch a\r\nrich man in her net. But more commonly there is calculation on both\r\nsides and both are duped.\r\n\r\nMarriage for money is not confined to the rich but also occurs among\r\npeasants and working people. Everywhere it constitutes one of the\r\nprincipal corrupting elements of sexual intercourse and procreation.\r\nHard-working servants who have succeeded in saving a few hundred\r\ndollars are often married for the sake of this small sum, and then\r\nabandoned as soon as the husband has squandered it. I do not pretend\r\nthat a marriage for money can never be happy; it may happen that the\r\ncontract is an honest one and that love follows it more or less\r\nhaltingly, especially when the calculators have taken into account\r\ncharacter and health, etc., as well as money.\r\n\r\nThere is no need for me to continue this theme any further, and I\r\nshall conclude by stating that this system opens the door to\r\nhypocrisy, deceit and abuse of all kinds. It is not without reason\r\nthat marriage for money has been branded with the name of _fashionable\r\nprostitution_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSTITUTION AND PROXENETISM\r\n\r\nProstitution is a very ancient institution and a sign of degeneration\r\nwhich is found more or less among all nations. When woman is an\r\narticle for sale it is not surprising that those whose moral worth is\r\nweak take the traffic into their own hands when they can, and sell\r\nthemselves to men to satisfy their sexual appetites, instead of\r\nallowing themselves to be passively exploited as articles of commerce.\r\nMan being the stronger finds it advantageous in the lower and\r\nbarbarous states of civilization to monopolize this traffic for his\r\nown profit, and deliver the women under his domination to\r\nprostitution. We have seen that fathers give their daughters, and\r\nhusbands their wives to prostitution.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, the woman who prostitutes herself in our modern\r\ncivilization, always runs the risk of being abused without payment;\r\nwhich is not to be wondered at considering the doubtful quality of the\r\nusual clients of the prostitute. It is therefore natural that she\r\nshould seek for a means of protection. She thus takes a male\r\nprotector, or \"bully,\" whom she pays; or else she joins the service\r\nof those who make a business of prostitution--or _proxenetism_.\r\nProxenetism and protectors are thus the parasites of prostitution.\r\n\r\nProstitution flourished amongst the ancients and also in the Middle\r\nAges, especially after the Crusades (Chapter VI). I do not propose to\r\nwrite the history of prostitution; it is sufficient to be acquainted\r\nwith that of the present day. I may, however, remark that among a\r\nnumber of primitive races, and in young and progressive nations, whose\r\nsexual life is still comparatively pure, prostitution is only feebly\r\ndeveloped. It is especially to Napoleon I that we owe the present form\r\nof regulation and organization of prostitutes. Like all his\r\nlegislation on marriage and sexual intercourse, this regulation is the\r\nliving expression of his sentiments toward woman; oppression of the\r\nfemale sex, contempt of its rights, and degradation of its individuals\r\nto the state of articles of pleasure for men, and machines for\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\n=Organization and Regulation of Prostitution.=--We have just seen the\r\nsocial conditions under which prostitution becomes quite naturally\r\norganized, with its protectors and its proxenetism. There is another\r\nfactor to be added--that of venereal disease. The infectious germs of\r\nsyphilis and gonorrhea are usually met with in the genital organs of\r\nman and woman; so that every coitus between a healthy and an infected\r\nindividual may infect the former. Hence the danger of the spread of\r\ninfection increases with the number of mutations in sexual\r\nintercourse. If a woman offers herself systematically to all the men\r\nwho wish for her, the probability that she will be infected by one of\r\nthem increases in proportion to the number of clients.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, as soon as she is infected, the danger is\r\nincreased by the number of men who have connection with her, for she\r\nwill probably infect a large proportion of them.\r\n\r\nWhile paying much attention to venereal diseases and their\r\nconsequences, medicine has shown itself inconceivably blind in not\r\ncomprehending the bearing of this elementary arithmetic. We must take\r\ninto account the fact that the complete cure of syphilis is very\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to prove; that this disease is extremely\r\ninfectious, at least during the first two years of its course; and\r\nthat it extends to the blood and the whole organism, so that it may be\r\ncommunicated, not only by large visible sores, but by small\r\nexcoriations hidden in the mucous membrane of the vagina or the mouth,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nWe must also remember that gonorrhea is less painful in woman than in\r\nman, and that, even in the latter, it ceases to be painful when it\r\nbecomes chronic. We may add that the microbes (the gonococci) are very\r\ndifficult to reach in all the recesses of the mucous membrane of the\r\nsexual organs in which they are hidden, and that in women they\r\npenetrate as far as the womb, when a cure becomes almost impossible.\r\n\r\nIf we consider that the sexual organs of woman form deep and hidden\r\ncavities which it is very difficult to examine thoroughly, in spite of\r\nall the apparatus of modern surgery, and that the mouth in prostitutes\r\nis also frequently contaminated by unnatural manipulations; lastly,\r\nthat no part of their body is absolutely indemnified, it is easy to\r\nunderstand the great danger of infection in public prostitution.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the danger of venereal disease, the regulation of\r\nprostitution was instituted by medical men with the good intention of\r\neliminating or of diminishing its danger, since they regarded its\r\nsuppression as impossible. This system consists in the official\r\nsupervision and inscription of every woman who prostitutes herself.\r\nShe is given an official form which obliges her to submit to medical\r\nexamination once a week or once a fortnight, under the penalty of\r\nbeing arrested and punished.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate medical control, regulation generally endeavors to lodge\r\nprostitutes in brothels or _lupanars_, under the direction of a\r\nproxenet. In theory, the brothel is not exactly considered as a State\r\ninstitution of public health; the word _toleration_ being used in this\r\nconnection, signifying that it is regarded as a tolerated evil.\r\nNevertheless, this distinction only rests on uncertain and subtle\r\ncharacters. To tolerate, to license, to organize, to recognize and\r\nfavor, to protect and recommend are notions which merge into one\r\nanother insensibly. As soon as the State tolerates prostitution and\r\nbrothels, it is obliged to enter into official contracts with\r\nprostitutes and proxenetism; therefore, it recognizes them. Moreover,\r\nthe services which it renders must be paid for. It is therefore\r\nnecessary that prostitutes and proxenets should pay their tribute to\r\nthe State and to the doctors: but \"the one who pays commands.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt this proverb must not be taken to the letter, nevertheless\r\nthe one who pays always exerts a certain pressure on the one who\r\nreceives, and for this reason proxenets and inscribed prostitutes have\r\nsome idea that they form part of an official institution, which raises\r\ntheir position not only in their own eyes but in those of the\r\nirreflective masses. I will cite two examples which show how\r\neffectively the public organization of a vicious social anomaly\r\nconfuses ideas in persons of limited intelligence.\r\n\r\nOne of my friends was engaged in combating the official regulation of\r\nprostitution. A woman, who misunderstood his object, came to him\r\ncomplaining bitterly of the loose life her daughter was leading, and\r\nasked him if he could not help her by placing her in a brothel\r\nlicensed by the State; she would then be under the care of a paternal\r\ngovernment!\r\n\r\nAn old proxenet in Paris requested the authorities to transfer the\r\nmanagement of her brothel to her daughter, aged nineteen. Her house,\r\nshe said, was honest and managed in a loyal and religious spirit; her\r\ndaughter was capable and initiated into the business and would carry\r\nit on in the same irreproachable manner as hitherto.\r\n\r\nThese two examples of ingenuousness are sufficiently characteristic of\r\nthe morality of the system. In _La Maison Tellier_ Guy de Maupassant\r\nhas depicted with his masterly pen the psychology of the prostitute,\r\nthe proxenet, and their clients.\r\n\r\nFor reasons previously mentioned no real confidence can be placed in\r\nperiodical medical examination of prostitutes; on the contrary it\r\ngives the male public a false security. The object of these medical\r\nvisits is to eliminate diseased women from circulation and compel them\r\nto submit to hospital treatment. But any one acquainted with the facts\r\nknows that the treatment is illusory. In a short time every woman in a\r\nbrothel is infected, with very few exceptions. But, on the one hand,\r\nthe proxenets and the prostitutes have every interest in shortening\r\nthe time in hospital; and, on the other hand, the visiting doctor,\r\nwho often lives partly by their fees, is obliged to treat them with\r\nrespect. [In Paris, the doctors in charge of the inspection of\r\nprostitutes are paid by the State, and do not depend on fees from the\r\nwomen.] The treatment of venereal disease being of long duration and\r\nvery uncertain in its effects, a vicious circle is formed.\r\n\r\nA conscientious Dutch doctor, Chanfleury van Issjelstein, who\r\nattempted to eliminate all infected prostitutes from the brothels,\r\nsucceeded in almost emptying them, by subjecting the infected women to\r\nprolonged treatment in hospital. This led to a revolt which endangered\r\nhis life, and he had to abandon his scheme.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary hospital practice only visible sores are treated, and\r\ngonorrheal discharges as long as they are apparent; the prostitutes\r\nare then allowed to return to their brothels. Moreover, inspection is\r\nmade too rapidly; for, if every woman was examined carefully from head\r\nto foot every week, neither the brothels, the prostitutes nor the\r\ndoctors could exist.\r\n\r\nCertain persons have made the proposition, as ridiculous as it is\r\nradical, of submitting every man who visits a prostitute to medical\r\ninspection! This would indeed be the only means of preventing the\r\ninfection of prostitutes. But I ask my readers to imagine such a\r\nmeasure put in practice. Is it likely that the _habitués_ of brothels,\r\nsome of whom visit prostitutes nearly every day or oftener, would make\r\nthis known to a doctor in their town, and submit, before each coitus,\r\nto a medical examination which would cost them more time and money\r\nthan their pleasure! Can one imagine doctors examining whole _queues_\r\nof clients waiting their turn in brothels when business is brisk!\r\n\r\nWhilst an independent prostitute still possesses some human sentiment\r\nand a vestige of modesty which cause her to choose as far as possible\r\na limited number of clients, the police certificate of regulation\r\nofficially places the woman who receives it in the class of the\r\npariahs of society, and this leads to her losing the little that\r\nremains of her womanly nature. In brothels, the last vestige of her\r\nhuman nature is trampled under foot.\r\n\r\n=Degrees of Prostitution. Protectors.=--Several degrees can be\r\nrecognized in private prostitution. A variety of prostitute rather\r\nless low than others, looks for clients at public balls, certain cafés\r\nand other doubtful localities, and hires herself to a certain number\r\nof temporary acquaintances. The lowest and most common form of private\r\nprostitution is that of the streets. Generally at night, but sometimes\r\nin the daytime, these prostitutes, dressed so as to attract attention,\r\npromenade in certain well-known and frequented streets, and solicit\r\npassers-by. This is the common method employed in nearly all towns.\r\nThis solicitation is supervised by the police in countries where\r\nprostitution is regulated, and is only permitted to women who possess\r\ntheir certificate of inscription.\r\n\r\nHere the \"protector\" (bully) intervenes, and keeps an eye on the\r\nclients at the prostitute's house, or sometimes in the street. If they\r\ndo not pay up, or pay too little, or if they threaten or ill-treat the\r\nwoman, the protector administers a drubbing, and sometimes relieves\r\nthem of their purse or clothes.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the protector spies on the police for the benefit of\r\nthe prostitute. Sometimes he assumes the position of legitimate\r\nhusband, so as to facilitate taking rooms. A \"husband\" of this kind,\r\nwith a citizen's rights, is very useful to foreign prostitutes, for\r\nwithout him they would risk expulsion. The protector is generally a\r\nscamp of the worst kind, an absolutely depraved and idle vagabond who\r\nis entirely maintained by his \"wife.\"\r\n\r\nSome protectors shine by their sexual power, and are at the same time\r\nthe real lovers of the prostitutes, who keep them, and are plundered\r\nby them. While they submit to coitus with their clients without any\r\npleasure, and only simulate voluptuous sensations, they abandon\r\nthemselves to their protectors or lovers with ardor. It is needless to\r\nadd that the protectors are often criminals, or of the criminal type.\r\nThose who are well acquainted with prostitution declare that it would\r\nbe impossible without the protector, who is at the same time the\r\nfriend, protector and exploiter of the prostitute, while the brothel\r\nkeeper is only concerned with her wholesale systematic exploitation.\r\n\r\n=Brothels and Proxenets.=--Under the pretext of avoiding the dangers\r\nof prostitution in the streets, brothels were organized. These are\r\ngenerally managed by an elderly female profligate, often in\r\npartnership with a \"husband,\" who is only a superior kind of\r\nprotector. Officially, the prostitutes are free lodgers in the\r\nbrothel, but in reality they are often prisoners or slaves. They are\r\nwell fed and dressed in a way to attract the clients as much as\r\npossible. Clothes, food, etc., are placed to their account and the\r\ncrafty brothel keeper generally manages to get them into debt so as to\r\nalways remain their creditor. In this way these miserable outcasts of\r\nsociety, who are generally incapable of claiming their legal rights,\r\nare more or less reduced to slavery. Apparently they are free, but in\r\nreality they can hardly leave the house without paying their debts,\r\nand the brothel keeper who wishes to keep them arranges so that they\r\ncannot pay it.\r\n\r\nIt is not always easy to distinguish between the different classes of\r\nprostitutes: the prostitute of the brothel, the street prostitute\r\nunder inscription or not, the private prostitute and lorette or\r\ngrisette. Sometimes a woman may rise from one class to another; but\r\nmore often she falls lower and lower.\r\n\r\nWe may mention here one of the dangers of brothels. Their good\r\norganization, their medical supervision, etc., are extolled; but the\r\ngreat danger of the arithmetical progression of mutations in sexual\r\nintercourse is ignored. While a private prostitute rarely receives\r\nmore than one client in an evening, and is not absolutely obliged to\r\nreceive more, every prostitute in a brothel is forced to receive as\r\nmany as present themselves. A girl may thus have connection with men\r\ntwenty or thirty times in the same night.\r\n\r\nUnder certain circumstances, for instance at the time of conscription\r\nfor recruits at Brussels, the brothels are besieged to such a point\r\nthat one man has hardly time to finish coitus before another comes to\r\ntake his place. It is obvious that such \"file firing\" greatly\r\nincreases the danger of venereal infection, since a single infected\r\nperson is sufficient to contaminate innumerable clients (even without\r\nthe woman herself becoming infected).\r\n\r\nIt is often denied that the brothel is a prison, yet this fact has\r\nbeen often demonstrated. When, as in France, the police can arrest a\r\nprostitute at pleasure--often a virtuous young girl who is taken for\r\nsuch--and put her on the inscription list, the thing is obvious. I\r\nhave treated a girl who became the mistress of a police agent in Paris\r\nunder the threat of being inscribed as a prostitute.\r\n\r\nAgain, besides the debts we have spoken of, the proxenets have many\r\nother ways of keeping prostitutes under their dependence. It is very\r\ndifficult for ignorant girls, placed under the ban of society, to\r\nreturn to a free and virtuous life. But if a girl shows signs of\r\nwishing to leave a brothel, heroic measures are adopted, in the form\r\nof international exchange. A girl who is unacquainted with the\r\nlanguage of the country is naturally more incapable of gaining her\r\nfreedom than one who does. This is one of the reasons why the brothels\r\nof different countries exchange their women.\r\n\r\nThis expedient, which also satisfies clients who desire a change,\r\nleads to the exportation of women from one country to another, under\r\nfalse pretenses, such as the promise of lucrative and easy situations.\r\nIn this way young Swiss girls are exported to Hungary, Hungarians to\r\nSwitzerland, Germans to France, French to England, Europeans to\r\nBuenos-Ayres, creoles to Europe, etc. For example, if a young French\r\ngirl has been exported to Buda-Pest or Buenos-Ayres, we may be certain\r\nthat she will lose all inclination to run away; for what can she do--a\r\nstranger without a cent, with her ignorance and want of character,\r\nalone in the streets, when she does not understand a word of the\r\nlanguage?\r\n\r\n=White Slavery.=--The modern commerce in female slaves of civilized\r\nEurope destined for prostitution is closely connected with the facts\r\nwe have just described. The manner in which brothels exchange their\r\nmerchandise only concerns one side of the question. The principal art\r\nconsists in obtaining young girls, of twelve to seventeen years of\r\nage, for the brothels. This traffic is formally prohibited by most\r\nlaws; but what are laws made for, if not to be broken? There are so\r\nmany means of training children under some pretext or other, before\r\nthey are independent enough to escape this life of infamy. There are\r\nso many depraved or hungry parents who are ready to sell their\r\nchildren if, in hypocritical but transparent language, a good\r\nsituation is promised them with payment in advance.\r\n\r\nDuring a railway journey, I was myself a witness of the manner in\r\nwhich a young girl of twelve was sold in this way and sent to\r\nPressburg. I was also simple enough to try and appeal for the\r\nintervention of a consul and an ambassador to prevent the perpetration\r\nof the crime. They only replied by shrugging their shoulders. How\r\ncould I prove the matter before a tribunal? The child was accompanied\r\nby a woman who admitted to me that there could hardly be any other\r\nquestion than the sale of the child for prostitution. She had only\r\nbeen ordered to take the child to Vienna, where they would come and\r\ntake her. This shows the impotence of any person who tries to prevent\r\nsuch infamies.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years an international organization has at last\r\nbeen formed to combat white slavery; but so far it has not obtained\r\nmuch result. By the aid of depraved parents and all their criminal\r\nsystem of seduction, the proxenets always find a way of attaining\r\ntheir object. Moreover, it is difficult to see how the State can\r\nprevent proxenetism from obtaining its merchandise, so long as it\r\ntolerates and licenses it. We must remember that very young girls,\r\nalmost children, are the most easy to seduce and the most sought\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n=The Training of Prostitutes.=--The most repugnant aspect of\r\nproxenetism is the seduction and systematic training of the girls. The\r\ndesire for money and fine dresses, the promise of good situations, and\r\nespecially alcoholic intoxication, all play their part in the\r\ndiabolical art of proxenetism. Many young girls, frivolous and fond of\r\npleasure, but not wishing to go any further, are easily seduced under\r\nthe influence of wine. As soon as some protector has succeeded in\r\nseducing a girl, he trades on her shame and fear of discovery, adding\r\nthreats and blackmail. When she has become sufficiently accustomed to\r\nsexual intercourse, she is initiated into the high-school of vice, and\r\nsystematically instructed in exciting the sexual appetites of men by\r\nall possible means, natural or otherwise. She is first of all taught\r\nhow to simulate the venereal orgasm by her movements, breathing, etc.;\r\nto practice _coitus ab ore_, etc.; to conform to the pathological\r\nrequirements of masochists, sadists, etc., (Chapter VIII). Girls who\r\nhave been seduced and abandoned, and those who have had illegitimate\r\nchildren, are the most suitable objects for exploitation by the\r\njackals of proxenetism. If it is objected that the majority of\r\nprostitutes have a bad hereditary taint, and that their frivolity and\r\nidleness incline them from the first to their trade, I reply that\r\nfrivolity and love of pleasure are not at all the same thing as the\r\nignoble slavery and disgusting life of a prostitute in a brothel.\r\n\r\nThe part played by alcohol in prostitution has not been estimated at\r\nits true value. The coarser and more degraded forms of prostitution\r\nwould not be possible without it. It is by the aid of alcoholic orgies\r\nthat most girls are seduced, and by chronic drunkenness that they\r\nsustain themselves in their degradation.\r\n\r\n=Localized Prostitution.=--In certain towns, Hamburg for instance, an\r\nattempt has been made to establish an organization intermediate\r\nbetween the brothel and private prostitution, by compelling all\r\nprostitutes to inhabit certain special streets which are reserved for\r\nthem, at the same time being inscribed by the police. The result has\r\nbeen deplorable, and these streets have become uninhabitable. It must\r\nbe borne in mind that the owners or managers of these houses become\r\nfrom this fact more or less analogous to proxenets. Whoever lets his\r\nhouse for such an object must possess very little sentiment of modesty\r\nand duty, for he lives indirectly on the produce of prostitution.\r\n\r\n=Clandestine Brothels.=--Besides the official brothels, of which we\r\nhave spoken, there are a number of secret organizations of all kinds,\r\nwhich the State is the less able to prevent as it organizes and\r\ntolerates prostitution and proxenetism on its own account. A number of\r\ntaverns possess secret chambers which are only small brothels, in\r\nwhich the servants act at the same time as prostitutes.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with many small shops (gloves, perfumes, etc.), whose\r\ninnocent appearance only serves as a blind. A number of _cafés\r\nchantants_ are also connected with prostitution and proxenetism.\r\nCertain tobacco shops, etc., sell obscene objects such as pornographic\r\npictures. All these things act especially on youth and become\r\ndisseminated in colleges.\r\n\r\n=The Number of Prostitutes.=--The number of prostitutes has been\r\nestimated at 30,000 in Berlin, 40,000 in Paris, and 60,000 in London.\r\nIt can hardly be assumed that all these women have a pathological\r\nheredity. As soon as the State recognizes the right of existence of\r\nthis dung-heap, by its toleration and organization, corruption\r\nhitherto hidden and ashamed raises its head and becomes more and more\r\nbold, even dragging public organs into its sink. It is the public\r\nespecially, but also the authorities and the doctors who become\r\ncorrupted by contact with official proxenetism, which confuses the\r\nideas of morality in every one's head (vide _La Maison Tellier_, de\r\nMaupassant). They shut their eyes to the haunts of vice. The proxenets\r\nfeel that they are important personages, and the more enterprising of\r\nthem very often enjoy secret favors and receive visits from State\r\nofficials, and even married persons of high position. It is not\r\ndifficult for any one who reflects a little to see what this state of\r\nthings leads to.\r\n\r\n=Prostitution and the Police.=--The police know very well that in\r\ncertain brothels prostitution is not only associated with alcoholic\r\nexcess, but that certain houses become the haunts of criminals. They\r\neven regard certain low-class brothels and taverns frequented by\r\nprostitutes as very useful for the discovery of criminals. Spies of\r\nall kinds are met with in these places, from the secret agent who\r\ntracks a criminal and flirts at the same time with the prostitutes, to\r\nthe counter-spy employed by the proxenets to watch the secret agent.\r\nIt is here that the criminal world acquires its rakish manners, but\r\nits weakness for women and alcohol cause it to fall early into the\r\ntraps of the secret police. It is here also, as well as in the salons\r\nof high-class proxenetism, that we meet with those indefinable\r\nindividuals who are to-day secret agents of the government, to-morrow\r\nfalse noblemen or criminals, and the day after proxenets, and whom a\r\nformer minister of the German Empire designated by the euphemistic\r\nterm of \"non-gentleman.\"\r\n\r\n=The Psychology of Prostitutes and the Cause of Prostitution.=--The\r\npsychology of prostitutes is a difficult and complicated subject.\r\nAccording to the point of view of those who judge them, they are\r\nconsidered as women of evil and incorrigible instincts, or as the\r\nvictims of our bad social organizations. These two assertions are by\r\ntheir exclusiveness equally false. Urged by Christian charity, many\r\nsocieties for the improvement of morality have attempted to rescue\r\nfallen women; but, as might be expected, the results have not been\r\nsatisfactory. In fact, the mind of woman is quite differently\r\ndominated by sexual ideas and their irradiations than that of man. It\r\nis also less plastic, and becomes more easily the slave of habit and\r\nroutine. If, therefore, a woman has been systematically trained in\r\nsexual aberrations from her youth upward, all her ideas are\r\nconcentrated on debauch and sexual intercourse, so that it becomes\r\nimpossible later on to restore her to a life of serious social duty.\r\nRare exceptions confirm this rule. Moreover, sexual excitation in\r\nwomen awakens sexual desire, which becomes exalted by repetition and\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is necessary to recognize that girls who are\r\nidle, of weak character, hysterical, easily suggestible, coquettes or\r\nnymphomaniacs, are subjects specially disposed to become seduced.\r\nLastly, poverty is one of the most powerful auxiliaries of\r\nprostitution. I do not wish to be sentimental, nor to give too much\r\nweight to the well-known statement that a poor woman prostitutes\r\nherself to appease her children's hunger, or her own. No doubt this\r\nhappens among the oriental Jews and among the proletariat of large\r\ntowns, but it is, on the whole, exceptional.\r\n\r\nPoverty acts indirectly in a much more intense and efficacious manner.\r\nFirst of all it compels the proletariat to live in the most disgusting\r\npromiscuity. Not only do the father, the mother and the children\r\noccupy the same room, but they sleep there, often in the same bed. The\r\nchildren are witnesses of their parents' coitus and become initiated\r\nin sexual intercourse, often in its most bestial form, under the\r\ninfluence of alcohol, for example. Neglected and herded together with\r\nother children, most of them as badly brought up as themselves, from\r\ntheir early youth they become acquainted not only with the most gross\r\nand filthy things, but also with the most pathological and deformed\r\nexcrescences of the unhealthy life of towns. In the proletariat of\r\ncertain towns there are few girls of fourteen years of age who are\r\nstill virgins.\r\n\r\nAgain, poverty urges parents to exploit their children, for it is easy\r\nto deliver them into the hands of proxenetism. But this is not\r\nconfined to the poorest classes; among small tradespeople, poverty is\r\nalso an indirect agent of prostitution. Here again the effect of\r\npitiless exploitation is seen; in certain occupations which leave the\r\ngirls free evenings, and also in certain shops, the proprietor only\r\npays his employés an absurdly small salary, because they can add to it\r\nby prostitution. For this reason, many saleswomen, dressmakers, etc.,\r\nare obliged to content themselves with a minimum wage. When they\r\ncomplain, and especially when they are good looking, they are often\r\ngiven to understand that with their attractive appearance it is very\r\neasy for them to increase their income, for many a young man would be\r\nglad to \"befriend them,\" to say nothing of other insinuations of the\r\nsame kind. I have already pointed out how waitresses are utilized as\r\nbait in certain taverns, etc. Let us cite a few figures:\r\n\r\nAbout 80 per cent. of the prostitutes in Paris have some occupation\r\nbesides prostitution.\r\n\r\nIn factories, shops, etc., the average wage of men is 4 francs 20. per\r\nday; that of women 2 francs 20.; but in domestic service it is only 2\r\nfrancs 10. for men and 1 franc 10., or even 90 centimes for women,\r\neven where the latter do the same work! Is it to be wondered that they\r\nhave recourse to prostitution?\r\n\r\n=High-class Brothels.=--In these establishments the life of the\r\nprostitute is much more agreeable: the goods of superior quality\r\ndemanded by rich and fastidious clients requires better treatment and\r\nspecial care. I will cite a case published in the annual report of the\r\nSociété de Pestalozzi (for cruelty to children) at Vienna:\r\n\r\n    \"In October, 1904, the Tyrolean Society for Abandoned Infancy\r\n    sent us the papers of a young Tyrolean girl of eighteen, who was\r\n    found at Venice under police control. Our attention was drawn to\r\n    the youth of this girl and the incapacity of the father to\r\n    induce her to reform. We were requested to restore her, if\r\n    possible, to an honest life.\r\n\r\n    We made the usual inquiries. Having many brothers and sisters,\r\n    this girl, at the age of fourteen, obtained a situation at\r\n    Innsbruck, where she was badly treated. She went away and gave\r\n    herself gradually to prostitution, latterly at Vienna.\r\n\r\n    We had an interview with her at our office and ascertained that\r\n    she had experienced ill-treatment at Innsbruck. She had a modest\r\n    demeanor and made a good impression. She regarded her future\r\n    with equanimity, admitting that she was excluded from society,\r\n    but speaking of her trade as seriously as if it was licit and\r\n    officially recognized.\r\n\r\n    She assured us that her parents, having great difficulty in\r\n    gaining a livelihood, agreed with her in her choice of a\r\n    \"business.\" She was on very good terms with them and sent them\r\n    money.\r\n\r\n    To obtain a certificate from the police, the consent of her\r\n    parents was necessary. Her mother had told her that if she\r\n    remained pious and honest no one could reproach her. She held\r\n    \"Madame\" (the proprietress of the brothel) in high esteem, on\r\n    account of her kind treatment of her \"boarders.\" The house in\r\n    which she was located was first-class, both as regards clients\r\n    and treatment. There were about a dozen young girls there, most\r\n    of them younger than herself, all with their parents' consent;\r\n    and many of them sent home what they earned.\r\n\r\n    She said that her companions were very happy, being well fed and\r\n    clothed, and earning from 120 to 240 crowns a month. With much\r\n    ingenuousness she told us how Madame, whom she greatly\r\n    respected, had looked after two old \"boarders,\" who no longer\r\n    had any clients. She also had a protector.\r\n\r\n    We tried to induce her to commence another life, promising her a\r\n    situation, but she refused, saying that even if she wished to do\r\n    so Madame would not let her go; besides, she would always be\r\n    reproached for her past life, and she did not wish to live with\r\n    people who would always despise her. She had already suffered\r\n    enough trouble and did not wish to launch on the unknown.\r\n    Moreover, she had lost her former habits and had never learnt\r\n    anything seriously. In short, she did not wish to give up her\r\n    pleasant and comfortable life!\r\n\r\n    This conversation led us to the conclusion that the case in\r\n    question was not of a nature to justify any action on the part\r\n    of our society for the rescue of young women.\r\n\r\n    In spite of her tender age, this girl gave us the impression of\r\n    mature judgment. It appeared already much too late to attempt to\r\n    recommence her education. She also showed signs of great anxiety\r\n    when we spoke to her of leaving her brothel.\r\n\r\nThis case requires no comment; it gives a good idea of our social\r\ncondition. The religious piety of this girl, and her profound\r\nveneration for \"Madame,\" are typical of the deviation of moral sense\r\nby the suggestion of environment.\r\n\r\n=Varieties in Prostitutes.=--We thus see that prostitutes constitute a\r\ncollection of very different individuals. Although it may be true\r\nthat, on the average, their ranks are recruited from girls who are\r\ncoarse, shameless, depraved and alcoholic, it is no less false to\r\nconclude that all are of bad heredity. A considerable number are\r\npathological individuals, including hysterical subjects, nymphomaniacs\r\nand other psychopaths. Others again are naturally amoral, stupid, idle\r\nand deceitful, or have been accustomed to vicious surroundings from\r\ninfancy; or else they are of an absolutely indifferent and apathetic\r\nnature, or very suggestible and yielding to every seduction and\r\nexternal impulse. The latter perhaps form the largest contingent,\r\nbecause they most easily become the prey of proxenetism.\r\n\r\nMany of them have fallen by seduction. Ashamed of their first error,\r\nand not having the courage to bear the consequences, they gradually\r\nsink into the swamp of prostitution. Illegitimate births play a great\r\npart here.\r\n\r\nA certain class of prostitutes ply their trade simply from poverty and\r\nwant, being ashamed of it but profiting by it to maintain their\r\nfamily. But poverty acts chiefly in combination with other causes.\r\n\r\nThere still remains a very limited group formed by individuals who\r\ngive themselves up to prostitution for love of it. These are generally\r\nwomen with a morbid and violent sexual appetite, joined to want of\r\nmoral sense. Rich women, even countesses and princesses have been\r\nknown to become prostitutes.\r\n\r\nThis diversity among prostitutes explains why there are different\r\ndegrees in prostitution. Although its depravity is often more or less\r\nmasked by fine clothes and good cheer, the lowest level is represented\r\nby the girl of the brothels, who is little more than an instrument for\r\ncoitus in the hands of proxenetism (with the exception of certain\r\nhigh-class brothels). It is the prostitutes of low-class brothels for\r\nsoldiers who lead the most miserable life. Such houses only keep\r\nrefuse merchandise, _i.e._, old prostitutes who are no good for\r\nanything else. There is no sadder sight than a soldiers' brothel.\r\n\r\nThe prostitution in _cafés_, scent shops, glove shops, etc.,\r\nconstitutes a slightly higher grade. As regards danger of venereal\r\ninfection this is as great as anywhere, but the girls are rather more\r\nindependent and lead a more natural life. It is precisely because\r\nthese places are not under legal protection, that the patrons or\r\nprotectors of prostitutes cannot employ the terrorism of licensed\r\nproxenets.\r\n\r\nThe free prostitutes of the streets are about on the same level. They\r\nare not dependent on proxenetism, but only on their protector and\r\nproprietor, which is a trifle less degrading. What degrades them most\r\nof all is police inscription, obligatory medical inspection, and the\r\nmiserable system of solicitation on the pavement. It is necessary to\r\nhave lost all feeling of modesty, and to possess a cynical audacity to\r\nbecome a street prostitute.\r\n\r\nProstitutes who only practice occasionally and have not the courage to\r\nsolicit, nor to be inscribed by the police, belong to a higher level.\r\nBut in countries where regulation is in force they always run the risk\r\nof being arrested by the police and put on the inscription list. These\r\nprivate prostitutes constitute the intermediate stage between\r\nprostitution properly so-called, and venal concubinage, which we shall\r\nspeak of later.\r\n\r\nThe army of prostitutes is partly composed of pathological\r\nindividuals. Alcohol and vicious habits increase their abnormal\r\ntendencies, so that their behavior leaves nothing wanting in the way\r\nof temper, impulsiveness, cynicism and insolence. This is seen every\r\nday in hospitals for venereal disease. As soon as a prostitute finds\r\nher physical condition improve after a few days in hospital, sexual\r\nabstinence arouses her appetite to such an extent that she indulges in\r\nlesbian love with her companions, or shows herself naked at the\r\nwindows, etc. Some prostitutes of better quality suffer at first from\r\nthe scandalous tone of the brothel, but they generally become used to\r\nit, and end with adopting it themselves. Honest women, infected\r\naccidentally or by their husbands, suffer martyrdom when they are sent\r\nto the venereal divisions of hospitals.\r\n\r\n=The Fate of Prostitutes.=--What becomes of prostitutes in the course\r\nof time? They cannot remain very long in the brothels for they only\r\naccept young and fine-looking girls. It would be interesting to follow\r\nthe fate of all these women. At all events nothing is more absurd than\r\nthe common saying that the suppression of brothels increases\r\nprostitution in the streets, and that their introduction suppresses\r\nit. It is obvious that, as the women in brothels have to be\r\ncontinually renewed, they must be continually thrown onto the streets.\r\nNo doubt many prostitutes die at an early age from the results of\r\nalcohol and syphilis. The only resource left to many, when they are\r\nejected from the brothels, is to solicit in the streets or to join\r\nclandestine brothels or taverns of the same nature.\r\n\r\nThe most profligate, those who look upon their profession from the\r\nartistic or the commercial points of view, know how to advance\r\nthemselves and become \"Madames\"; but these are comparatively few in\r\nnumber. Some end in suicide or lunatic asylums.\r\n\r\nAs a last resource, when no man will have anything to do with them,\r\nmany of them take to the lowest occupations, such as cleaning\r\nlavatories, etc. At Munich it used to be proverbial that the class of\r\n\"Radiweiber\" and \"Nussweiber\" (old women selling nuts etc., at the\r\nstreet corners) were mostly recruited from old prostitutes.\r\nOccasionally a better class prostitute succeeds in getting married.\r\n\r\nIf we consider without prejudice the miserable life of a prostitute,\r\nwe cannot hear the term \"_fille de joie_\" without a feeling of sadness\r\nand indignation, for it conveys such bitter and tragic irony. If we\r\ncould ourselves experience the true state of mind which is hidden\r\nbehind the smiles and songs of so many miserable singers at café\r\nconcerts, and behind the brazen artifices of many prostitutes; if we\r\ncould learn their past life and the cause of their fall, no man with a\r\nspark of pity or sympathy for his fellows could relish with a light\r\nheart a \"joy\" bought at such a price. For those who read German, I\r\nrecommend on this subject: _Tagebuch einer Verlornen_, by Marguerite\r\nBöhme. (Berlin: Fontane, 1905.)\r\n\r\n=Prostitution and Sexual Perversion.=--If it is true that many\r\nprostitutes have a pathological heredity, it is still more sure that\r\nthey often have to submit to the fancies of pathological clients. The\r\nnumerous sexual anomalies, of which we have spoken in Chapter VIII,\r\nare closely connected with prostitution. The refinement of modern\r\ncivilization is so complete that it supplies localities and women for\r\nthe special use of each pathological form of the sexual appetite.\r\n\r\nSo far we have only spoken of female prostitutes, and we have seen how\r\nthey conform to the customs of sadists, masochists, etc. They allow\r\nthemselves to be maltreated by the former, and maltreat the latter; or\r\nelse they play at exhibitions symbolical of cruelty or humiliation.\r\n\r\nFor male inverts, on the other hand, there exist male brothels, in\r\nwhich young boys practice pederasty for money. For certain rich\r\n_roués_, or for those affected with pederosis, children are kept. This\r\nlast class of goods is very dear, for there is always a risk of the\r\nlaw intervening. Young virgins also fetch a high price; and they even\r\ntry to sew up the hymen after their defloration, so as to offer them\r\nseveral times as virgins!\r\n\r\nWith what we have said in Chapter VIII, these indications will suffice\r\nto show that modern prostitution and proxenetism constitute a public\r\ndisgrace, intended to exploit the unbridled desires of men for profit.\r\nThis system has been defended on the grounds of hygiene and the\r\nprotection of virtuous women against the assaults of men, etc. In\r\nreality, it has resulted in corrupting and effeminating men; in\r\nrestricting the normal sexual intercourse of youth in its natural\r\nassociation with an inconsiderate love; in degrading love itself; in\r\ndebarring a great number of capable and virtuous women from marriage,\r\nfrom love, and from sexual intercourse in general; lastly, in causing\r\ncomplete aberration of the whole sexual life of modern society.\r\n\r\nContemporary literature has begun to consider the psychology of\r\nprostitution. We have already mentioned _La Maison Tellier_ by de\r\nMaupassant; Zola's _Nana_ is the history of a high-class prostitute\r\nrelated in the well-known realistic manner of the celebrated novelist,\r\nin which he describes the sexual depravity existing in certain\r\nParisian circles of the Second Empire.\r\n\r\nI will now make a few remarks concerning a social movement organized\r\nagainst the regulation of prostitution, called abolitionism.\r\n\r\n=Abolitionism and Regulation.=--An Englishwoman, Mrs. Josephine\r\nButler, undertook, in the name of liberty, a campaign against\r\nproxenetism, white slavery and the State regulation of prostitution.\r\nShe also attacked the injustice of the Code Napoleon toward women,\r\nespecially the prohibition of inquiry into paternity, which throws\r\ngirls who have been seduced into the arms of prostitution. The\r\nabolitionists contest the right of police inscription of prostitutes\r\nunder the pretext of hygiene, of submitting them against their will to\r\nmedical inspection, and of keeping them in brothels. They claim severe\r\nlaws against proxenetism and oppose toleration.\r\n\r\nIn medical circles the system of regulation has generally been\r\ndefended. It is urged that society has the right to protect itself\r\nagainst dangerous infection, and that, with this object, it has as\r\nmuch right to treat infected prostitutes compulsorily, as those\r\naffected with smallpox or cholera. Owing to their shameful trade, they\r\nmaintain that these women have lost all claim to special\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThis argument appears very reasonable at first sight, but it takes\r\nquite a different aspect when the facts are examined more thoroughly.\r\n\r\nFirst of all the comparison with smallpox and cholera is illogical,\r\nfor these diseases endanger the innocent public, while the man who\r\nmakes use of prostitution is quite aware of the danger he runs.\r\nSociety is under no obligation to provide healthy prostitutes for the\r\nuse of Don Juan.\r\n\r\nAgainst this it is stated that innocent wives are often infected and\r\nmade to suffer for the sins of their husbands. But such an extensive\r\nblending of the State with family life does not appear to be\r\nadmissible, and would lead to crying abuses. Society has neither the\r\nright nor the duty to facilitate the dangerous or injurious acts of\r\ncertain individuals at the expense of others, by rendering them less\r\ndangerous, so that certain third parties may be less liable to suffer.\r\nThis is an absurd sophism. The duty of society is to make responsible\r\nthe one who has committed the dangerous or injurious act, and to\r\npunish him if he has done harm. Here, on the contrary, one only of\r\nthe culprits (the prostitute) is compelled to keep to her vile trade,\r\nwhile the man who makes use of her, and often infects her, is free\r\nfrom any responsibility. Moreover, the State has no right to act\r\nagainst responsible persons under the pretext that their future\r\nsentiments or actions would have dangerous consequences for others;\r\nthis would lead to arbitrary abuse of power. The insane, and habitual\r\ncriminals make the only exceptions, for their abnormal and\r\nirresponsible cerebral organization is a perpetual danger to society.\r\n\r\nThere is one question, however, which arises: Can prostitution in\r\nitself be regarded as a misdemeanor punishable by law? If this were\r\nthe case, the client would have to be punished as well as the\r\nprostitute; or both of them be sent to reformatories. This is the only\r\nlogical consequence, for in such cases the two contractors are equally\r\nguilty, and also equally dangerous as regards infection.\r\n\r\nHow, therefore, can the system be justified which brands and inscribes\r\nthe prostitute only; which is not content with tolerating her vile\r\ntrade instead of punishing it, but gives it official sanction, causing\r\nher to fall lower and lower; which finally, to crown the work,\r\nlicenses the proxenetism which exploits her vice? It is difficult to\r\nimagine more complete hypocrisy, or a more contradictory system.\r\n\r\nIn former times when slavery was allowed, men's will and pleasure were\r\nsufficient to justify such measures, which created for their profit a\r\nclass of female pariahs; and this was frankly and openly admitted.\r\nNowadays, the equal rights of women which are officially recognized in\r\ncivilized countries no longer allow it, and hygienic arguments only\r\ncan give such modern barbarity the hypocritical appearance of\r\njustification. Lunatics and criminals are only locked up as a measure\r\nof safety, and to attempt to improve them; but their bodies are not\r\nallowed to become an object of commerce for the pleasure of other\r\nmembers of society.\r\n\r\nBut the results of honestly interpreted statistics contradict the\r\napparent justification of the regulation of prostitution, in the name\r\nof hygiene. It is intended to furnish men with a means of coitus free\r\nfrom danger; but the facts prove that venereal disease has not been\r\ndiminished by this means. The false security given to men officially\r\nby regulation makes them all the more careless. The multiplication of\r\nthe sexual connections of each prostitute increases the danger of\r\ninfection at least as much as the elimination of a few diseased\r\npersons diminishes it.\r\n\r\nThe corruption of the State and its officials, especially the police\r\nand the medical inspectors of brothels, the general depravity which\r\nresults from official toleration, and the perversion of ideas of\r\nmorality among the public, increase habits of prostitution, and with\r\nit the danger of infection. Assured of impunity the pimps and their\r\nacolytes become more and more audacious and extend their business,\r\nwhile the prostitutes, whose number is increased by this system, seek\r\nto escape the police and practice their trade clandestinely. It is no\r\nwonder that the swamp to be purified becomes more and more infectious.\r\nCan it be conscientiously said that hygiene has benefited? This is\r\nwell seen in Geneva and in France. It is enough to compare the number\r\nof cases of venereal disease and of prostitutes in countries where\r\nregulation is in force, with those which do not employ it, to show the\r\ncomplete fiasco of the system from the hygienic point of view. On the\r\naverage, the number of infectious cases is nearly the same with or\r\nwithout regulation and depends on many other causes. I cannot enter\r\ninto the details here and must refer to the statistics and to the\r\nworks published by the Abolitionist Federation (6 Rue St. Léger,\r\nGeneva).\r\n\r\nOf all that has been published, nothing appears to me more conclusive\r\nthan the masterly statistics of Mounier, for Holland, in 1889. Even\r\namong medical men, the originators of regulation, the abolitionist\r\npoint of view is steadily gaining ground. It is beginning to be\r\nunderstood that the toleration of proxenetism, and even the\r\ninscription and medical inspection of prostitutes, are vicious methods\r\nof social sanitation against venereal infection.\r\n\r\nBut by the suppression of official toleration and regulation, the\r\nquestion of prostitution is in no way settled. This has only a\r\nnegative action, important for the tactics of those who wish to upset\r\na scandalous abuse, but which does not respond to the higher task of\r\nextirpating the root of the evil. The positive work will only begin\r\nwhen the State is relieved of its shameful compact with proxenetism\r\nand prostitution.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters we shall examine the remedies which must be\r\napplied to our sexual anarchy, the result of masculine autocracy, as\r\nRussian anarchy is the result of Tsarism. I will first make a few\r\nobservations from the medical and hygienic point of view, to the\r\npartisans of regulation. They exclaim that the abolitionists are\r\nfanatics, who, from their absence of scientific spirit, will deluge\r\nsociety with venereal disease. This bogy has no sound foundation. The\r\nState regulation of prostitution applied to certain women has not\r\ndiminished the amount of venereal disease, because it does not reach\r\nit. The State concession of an unnatural vice cannot be hygienic.\r\nMoreover, it is impossible to completely disinfect prostitutes, this\r\ndisinfection is quite illusory, unless it is also applied to their\r\nclients, which is impracticable.\r\n\r\nIn France, where the system of regulation has existed for a long time\r\nin its strictest form, venereal diseases are extremely prevalent;\r\nwhile in Switzerland, where it only exists at Geneva, having been\r\nsuppressed for some years in the Canton of Zurich, they are less\r\nfrequent. Geneva is not less contaminated than other towns in\r\nSwitzerland, in spite of its model brothels, and Zurich has lately, by\r\npopular vote, confirmed abolition by a crushing majority, in\r\nopposition to a few interested persons who wished to reëstablish the\r\nbrothels under futile and fallacious pretexts. Some clandestine\r\nbrothels still exist in towns where the authorities shut their eyes.\r\n\r\nIt has also been maintained that the number of sexual misdemeanors\r\nwould increase with the suppression of brothels. This is another\r\nillusion. The majority of sexual misdemeanors are due to psychic\r\nanomalies (Chapter VIII) or to the effects of alcoholic intoxication.\r\nIf they have any relation to prostitution, it is rather that of being\r\nfavored by its orgies.\r\n\r\n=Remedies for the Evil.=--What is wanted first of all are severe laws\r\nagainst proxenetism. It is indisputable that commerce made with the\r\nbody of one's neighbor is illegal, even when the latter gives\r\nconsent. It is a crime or misdemeanor which should be prosecuted like\r\nnegro slavery or usury. We should not wait for a complaint to be\r\nlodged, but prosecute proxenetism officially, for the victims are\r\nhindered by shame from coming forward. The pimps of proxenetism are\r\nrecruited from the dregs of society. In this domain, as in the others,\r\npenal law should not be put in force; the object should be the\r\nprotection of society and the improvement of the criminal.\r\n\r\nAs regards prostitution itself, it cannot be made a misdemeanor\r\nwithout opening the door too widely to complete arbitrariness. The\r\nState cannot prevent a responsible adult from disposing of his own\r\nbody, without introducing religion and metaphysics into legislation;\r\nbut the State can require those who practice prostitution not to\r\nmolest the public. It has, therefore, the right to punish solicitation\r\nin the streets by fine or imprisonment, especially in often repeated\r\noffenses. It can also give persons of both sexes, who are victims of\r\nvenereal disease, the right of claiming damages by civil law. The\r\nlegality of this right of indemnity has been much contested. In my\r\nopinion it is legitimate when the State no longer tolerates or\r\nregulates prostitution; but so long as it does this, and submits\r\nprostitutes to obligatory medical treatment, the States takes the\r\nresponsibility of their health. Under the régime of regulation, an\r\ninfected person could logically claim damages from the State, or, at\r\nany rate from the pimps of licensed proxenetism.\r\n\r\nThe question of responsibility is quite different when prostitution is\r\nfree. The sexual intercourse of a free prostitute with a man may be\r\nregarded as a private contract in which each party has the same rights\r\nand obligations. If one of the two contractors deceives the other by\r\nconcealing venereal disease, the latter has the right to claim\r\ndamages, if there is sufficient proof of infection from this source.\r\n\r\nThe right of indemnity does not, however, constitute the principal\r\npoint. In order to successfully combat prostitution and venereal\r\ndisease, fundamental social reforms are necessary.\r\n\r\n(1). First of all the system of exploitation of the poor by the rich\r\nshould be put an end to, the work of the poor being remunerated at\r\nits true value. This requires a social transformation of the relations\r\nbetween capital and labor.\r\n\r\n(2). The use of narcotics, and especially alcohol, should be\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\n(3). The false modesty concerning sexual intercourse should be done\r\naway with.\r\n\r\n(4). The public should be instructed in the dangers of venereal\r\ndisease and in the means of preventing contamination. The only certain\r\nmeans of curing them consists in not contracting them.\r\n\r\n(5). Cleanliness should be universally encouraged, especially in\r\nsexual intercourse.\r\n\r\n(6). Preventive measures should be employed in every coitus, the\r\nobject of which is not procreation.\r\n\r\n(7). The treatment of venereal diseases in hospitals should be carried\r\nout in a decent and humane manner, so as not to shock the modesty of\r\neither sex, especially women, and so that patients need not be ashamed\r\nof submitting to medical treatment. Nowadays the venereal divisions of\r\nhospitals often more resemble brothels. This state of things makes it\r\nimpossible for any woman with a particle of modesty to stay in these\r\nplaces. It is evident that women who are more or less virtuous, and\r\neven the better class of prostitutes, will avoid such hospital\r\ntreatment as much as possible, and will thereby become the worst\r\nsources of infection.\r\n\r\nBy treating venereal disease in hospital with more regard for decency\r\nand modesty, by abolishing the brand of shame, and by separating\r\npatients according to their behavior, we might succeed in improving a\r\nstate of things which is often unbearable. Patients with venereal\r\ndiseases would then more willingly submit to hospital treatment and\r\nwould be more easily cured. In Italy much progress has already been\r\nmade in this direction.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that if we should be contented for the\r\npresent with damming up prostitution and suppressing the causes which\r\nrender prostitutes more and more abject, without yet being able to\r\nabolish the whole evil, a transformation of our social life, and\r\nespecially the suppression of the reign of capital as a means of\r\nexploitation of the work of others, and suppression of the use of\r\nalcoholic drinks, would eventually succeed in the gradual extinction\r\nof prostitution and the substitution of concubinage, which has much\r\nless evil results.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENAL CONCUBINAGE\r\n\r\nVenal concubinage occupies an intermediate position between\r\nprostitution and concubinage. It is distinguished from the latter by\r\nthe fact that it is remunerated; but the distinction is very fine.\r\n\r\n=Lorettes.=--This is an old term which may be applied to paid women\r\nwho are not regular prostitutes. It is hardly possible to distinguish\r\nthem from clandestine prostitutes (not on the police inscription).\r\nThey are women who do not practice solicitation or sell themselves to\r\nthe first comer, but generally keep to one man for a time.\r\n\r\n=Grisettes.=--The Parisian grisette, whose type has become classic, is\r\na higher class of woman who, at any rate in her primitive simplicity,\r\nwas not wanting in romance. Relations with a grisette may be compared\r\nto limited and free marriage, in which there is comparative fidelity.\r\n\r\nLike some of the free prostitutes, the grisette does not live only on\r\nthe support of her lover. She is often a dressmaker or a shop-girl,\r\nand makes arrangements with a lover so as to live more comfortably.\r\n\r\nWhen the grisette acts as her lover's housekeeper and lives with him\r\non terms of the closest intimacy, the _liaison_ takes a more serious\r\ncharacter and there is a certain degree of affection or even love.\r\nHowever, all these concubinages are generally limited to a few weeks\r\nor months, so that the natural love of the woman becomes blunted by\r\nsuccessive polyandry. It is always more or less a question of \"an\r\naccessory business.\"\r\n\r\nThere are all kinds of lorettes and grisettes, but as a rule they are\r\ngenerally attached to small tradesmen, students, workingmen, etc.,\r\nrather than to rich men. It is a kind of contract for a limited\r\nperiod. This system is very widespread in large towns, where the\r\ninhabitants do not interfere with each other's affairs; but is\r\ndifficult to manage in small towns, where every one knows everybody.\r\n\r\n=Mistresses.=--These may be called the aristocrats of the species.\r\nHere we see more distinctly the transition from venal love to free\r\nconcubinage based on mutual love. The _hetaira_ of the ancient Greeks\r\n(vide Chapter VI) corresponded more or less to the modern mistresses,\r\nespecially to the intelligent mistresses of men in high positions. In\r\ncertain respects we may say that George Sand, for example, was a\r\n_hetaira_ from pure love, while among the Greek _hetaira_ money played\r\na great part. Some mistresses are paid; others live on terms of\r\nequality with their lovers; others again maintain their lovers. We\r\nmust also distinguish between mistresses who live with married men,\r\nand those who live with bachelors.\r\n\r\nThe most typical case is that where a bachelor who wishes to remain\r\nfree takes a mistress, whom he also makes mistress of his house, and\r\nwho thus becomes an illegitimate wife who may separate from him when\r\nit pleases her. Some women contract this kind of union without being\r\nactually paid, simply for their maintenance, in return for which they\r\ndo the housework. Here there is no actual sale of the body. The\r\ncontract may be indefinite or limited. In such cases the effect of\r\nmoney on the attitude of the man toward his mistress is evident; his\r\ntone is generally less respectful toward paid mistresses than toward\r\nthose who are not paid. The love of the paid mistress is little more\r\ndurable or more intense than that of the grisette, the situation being\r\nalmost the same.\r\n\r\nZola's _Nana_ prostituted herself regularly with rich men: secondly,\r\nshe was the mistress of Fontan, who plays the part of a high-class\r\nprotector; thirdly, she fell in love with Georges in quite an idyllic\r\nfashion. Bordenave, the manager, had good reason in wishing his\r\ntheater to be called a brothel, as he was more of a pimp than a\r\ntheatrical manager. This example, a little far-fetched, shows how\r\nideas pass from one to another in this elastic domain.\r\n\r\nThere are also married mistresses. The position of mistress to a\r\nmarried man is, on the whole, more delicate than that of mistress to a\r\nbachelor. We are only concerned here with paid mistresses. They seldom\r\ngive themselves to married men except when the home life of the latter\r\nis more or less disorganized; when the husband is separated from the\r\nwife, or when he lives in open warfare with her. A married man, on the\r\ncontrary, may secretly visit brothels or private prostitutes, often\r\neven with his wife's knowledge, because the prostitute can have no\r\ninfluence in family affairs. This reason has even been used for the\r\ndefense of prostitution. It is true that married men often have\r\nconnection with other women, and the term mistress has been applied to\r\nthe women who take part in this intercourse, whether they or their\r\nlover, or both of them, are already married. But in this case money is\r\nusually only a secondary consideration, when the households concerned\r\nare not broken up. It is often only the maneuver of an intriguer who\r\ntries to separate a husband from his wife to marry him herself and\r\nmonopolize his fortune. It is sufficient to show how difficult it\r\noften is to distinguish the paid mistress from the woman who does not\r\ngive herself from interest but from passion, or from the intriguing\r\nadventuress who tries to make a good catch.\r\n\r\nLorettes, grisettes and paid mistresses seldom have children. These\r\nwomen are more rarely infected with venereal diseases than\r\nprostitutes, but they are better acquainted with the methods of\r\npreventing conception.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the children of venal concubines is generally very sad.\r\nThey are not the fruits of love but of a sexual union based on\r\nidleness and lewdness. If conception occurs in spite of all\r\nprecautions, artificial abortion is attempted, or if this fails the\r\nchild is sent to the \"baby farmer,\" who gets rid of it. The women who\r\ndispose of their children in this way are often of the better class;\r\ncommon prostitutes often love and take care of their children, while\r\nthe young ladies of society generally try and get rid of their\r\nillegitimate children, because they are much more compromised. Some\r\nmarried women even do not hesitate to perform abortion when a child\r\ninconveniences them.\r\n\r\nWe have only mentioned the fourth group of women with which we are\r\nconcerned, because of its mercantile nature. Every union in which a\r\nhuman being gives love for money is unnatural. Venal love is not true\r\nlove, but an improper contract between man and woman, with the object\r\nof satisfying the sexual appetite, without any regard to the higher\r\nobject intended by nature. It sometimes happens that similar\r\ncontracts are made in the inverse direction, when a nymphomaniacal\r\nwoman purchases a fine young man, under some pretext or other. Inverts\r\nalso pay boys to satisfy their perverted appetites.\r\n\r\nHowever unsavory may be the contents of the present chapter, it was\r\nnecessary to write it in order to give a clear idea of the subject.\r\nUnder the pretense of virtue venal love has too long been covered with\r\na veil of hypocrisy. Prostitution, marriage for money and venal\r\nconcubinage are, each in its way, elements of corruption and decadence\r\nwhich, combined with alcohol, gambling, speculation, the greed for\r\nmoney and pleasure in general, threaten our modern culture with ruin.\r\nAmong these anomalies, the State organization of prostitution being\r\nthe most monstrous, it is necessary to begin with its suppression.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancients, the goddess Venus or Aphrodite was the symbol of\r\nbeauty and love. Although somewhat sly, she was fecund, full of desire\r\nand charm, and embodied not only the natural aspirations of man, but\r\nalso his artistic ideal. Nowadays, she is dragged in the mire by two\r\nfalse gods--Bacchus, who makes a gross and vulgar brute of her, and\r\nMammon, who transforms her into a venal prostitute--while a\r\nhypocritical religious asceticism, endeavors in vain to confine her in\r\na strait-waistcoat. May the progress of science and culture find the\r\npower to deliver her from the tyranny of her two infamous companions,\r\ndeified by human ignorance and bestiality. Then only will the goddess\r\nof love appear in all her glory!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT ON SEXUAL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever strong may be the hereditary sexual instincts which an\r\nindividual has inherited by phylogeny from his ancestors, and however\r\nviolent their internal outbreaks in his ontogeny, it is necessary to\r\nrecognize that an organism so complicated as that of man is capable of\r\nadapting itself to its environment to a remarkable and varied degree,\r\nand that consequently external influences react strongly on the sexual\r\nappetite. We will now examine these influences, so far as they are not\r\ndealt with in other chapters.\r\n\r\n=Influence of Climate.=--Warm climates appear to excite the intensity\r\nof sexual life; man matures more quickly and is more disposed to\r\nsexual excess. I am not aware of other influences that can be\r\nattributed to climate. It is, moreover, possible that the direct\r\ninfluence of heat has been confounded with the indirect action it\r\nexerts in the conditions of human existence. In cold countries life is\r\nmore laborious, and this diminishes the intensity of the sexual\r\nappetite. In warm countries man has not so much concern with\r\ndwellings, clothes and heating; life is greatly simplified, and this\r\nfreedom from anxiety inclines him to greater sexual activity.\r\n\r\n=Town and Country. Isolation. Sociability. Life in Factories.=--The\r\nsocial relations of man exert a great influence on sexual life.\r\nHermits and those who live on isolated farms are interesting in this\r\nrespect. Solitude generally leads man to chronic melancholia and to\r\nabnormal peculiarities, unless he has a library in his hermitage, when\r\nhe may live in the spirit of the intellectual sociability derived from\r\nthe study of books.\r\n\r\nIt is quite otherwise with one who has no intellectual occupation, or\r\none who has lived in solitude from infancy. In this case the hermit\r\nbecomes a kind of savage, without any intellectual development, and\r\nreverts more or less to the state of primitive man.\r\n\r\nAn adult who establishes himself in solitude without providing himself\r\nwith intellectual capital becomes strongly inclined to depressing\r\npsychoses. This is observed among the isolated farmers, according to\r\nProfessor Seguin, of New York. The man who lives alone, or surrounded\r\nonly by the members of his family becomes disposed to certain sexual\r\nanomalies, such as incest, sodomy and masturbation.\r\n\r\nIt is among the agricultural population that we meet with the most\r\nnormal sexual relations and the best hygiene. The French Canadians\r\nform a good example, and it is the same generally where agriculture is\r\npracticed by independent peasants, not alcoholized, and having divided\r\nproperty. Agricultural families generally procreate more children and\r\nhealthier ones than urban families. No doubt modern medical hygiene,\r\nboth public and private, has made so much progress in towns that there\r\nmay be, at a certain age, proportionally more living children than in\r\nthe country; but the country children are of stronger constitution and\r\nmore healthy in every way.\r\n\r\nI had the opportunity of confirming this opinion while I was\r\nsuperintendent of a lunatic asylum for many years. I found it was\r\nimpossible to recruit from the town a good staff of nurses of either\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitant of towns, it is true, learns his work more quickly, but\r\nhe lacks patience, perseverance and character, and soon shows himself\r\nwanting in the accomplishment of his physical and moral duties. The\r\ncountryman, on the contrary, is at first slow and clumsy, but soon\r\nbecomes more capable and careful, and more amenable to education. This\r\nshows that, on the average, the hereditary dispositions of the\r\ncountry-bred child are better than those of the town-bred child. The\r\nlatter develops more rapidly and more completely his natural\r\ndispositions, owing to social intercourse, while the country-bred\r\nchild, although he appears at first sight less intelligent, is really\r\nbetter endowed on the average than the town child. The superficial\r\nobserver is easily deceived, but country life accumulates more reserve\r\nforce in the organism than urban life.\r\n\r\nSexual excesses in the country are more conformable to nature. Apart\r\nfrom marriage, we meet with concubinage, infidelity, and sometimes\r\nprostitution, but these excesses are never widely spread in small\r\nplaces where every one knows each other. An extensive study of the\r\nalcohol question has shown me that hereditary degenerations and sexual\r\nevils in the country are principally due to alcoholism and its\r\nblastophthoria (vide Chapter I). But when factories, mining\r\nindustries, etc., create unhealthy conditions in the country, the evil\r\ninfluences of urban life are implanted there, often in a still higher\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nThe society of large towns is made up of many different circles, who\r\nhave little or no relations with each other, do not know each other,\r\nand seldom concern themselves about each other. The individual is only\r\nknown in his own circle. This circumstance favors the increase of vice\r\nand depravity. In addition to this, the insanitary dwellings, the life\r\nof excitement and innumerable pleasures, all tend to produce a\r\nrestless and unnatural existence. The best conditions of existence for\r\nman are contact with nature, air and light, sufficient physical\r\nexercise combined with steady work for the brain, which requires\r\nexercise as much as the other organs; this is just what is wanting\r\namong the poor, in the town and in the factory. Instead of this they\r\nare offered unhealthy nocturnal pleasures and a prostitution which\r\nspreads itself everywhere with all the dangerous effects we have\r\ndescribed. The result is that they become incapable of nourishing and\r\nraising their children properly, often even of procreating them in\r\nhealthy and natural love.\r\n\r\nSuch are the conditions of the lower classes in large towns. Along\r\nwith prostitution, venereal disease and alcohol, the wretched\r\ndwellings in many places lead to infamous promiscuity. In factories\r\nand mines things are still worse. In these places there is a swarm of\r\npeople continually engaged in most unhealthy occupations, and only\r\nleaving their work to indulge in the most repugnant sexual excesses.\r\nThe rapacity, frivolity and luxury of society lead to alcoholism,\r\npoverty, promiscuity and prostitution among the lower classes and\r\ncause complete degeneration of entire industrial populations.\r\n\r\nIn the Canton of Zurich I have had the opportunity of closely\r\nobserving the physical and moral effects of this degeneration. The\r\nindividuals most incapable as hospital attendants were always factory\r\nhands. These wretched beings were generally so atrophied in body and\r\nmind that they were no use for anything except the weaving of silk and\r\ncotton. In the large English towns, such as Liverpool, and among the\r\npopulation of certain mining districts in Belgium, I have met with\r\neven worse degeneration of the human species. Modesty, morality and\r\nhealth are destroyed in this swarming human mass--dirty, anæmic,\r\ntuberculous, rickety, imbecile, or hysterical--and there is no\r\ndistinction between the factory girl and the prostitute. In certain\r\nBelgian districts which are a prey to alcoholism, one sometimes sees\r\nhuman beings copulating in the streets like animals, or like the\r\ndrunken Kaffirs in South Africa. What can we expect from the\r\ndescendants of a population so completely degenerate? Marriage and\r\neven concubinage among peasants is golden in comparison!\r\n\r\nI will now draw attention to a contemporary phenomenon of the greatest\r\ninterest. The immense development of means of transport, combined with\r\nprogress in the sanitation of dwellings, favors the transportation of\r\ntown to country and country to town. This brings together the two\r\nmodes of human life, and in this I see the dawn of salvation in the\r\nfuture. The modern towns of North America, thanks to the great\r\nextension of their territory, already resemble the country to a great\r\nextent, each house being surrounded by a garden. The electric tramways\r\nshorten distances and facilitate this manner of building towns. As\r\nmeans of communication become still more simplified and cheapened, the\r\nadvantages of country life will be joined to those of the town without\r\nsuffering from the promiscuity of the latter. The disadvantages of\r\ncountry life consist in atrophy of the intellectual dispositions from\r\nwant of contact; improvement in means of transport will bring this\r\ncontact to the country. The result of such distribution of the\r\nterritory of a civilized state, such as I have in view, might be\r\ncalled an _Agropolis_--an urbanized country or a countrified town. It\r\nwould then be possible to live a life more ideal in human sentiments,\r\nand healthier as regards material and sexual matters.\r\n\r\nThe state of the countryman or peasant is advantageous for marriage,\r\nnot only because it does not offer such a suitable soil for\r\nprostitution, but because the danger of venereal disease is\r\ndiminished, and the procreation of healthy offspring favors conjugal\r\nhappiness and constancy in sexual union. From the religious point of\r\nview, the freedom in sexual intercourse which prevails among country\r\npeople before marriage is looked upon as immoral; but this is a\r\nnatural phenomenon similar to the \"marriage by trial\" of certain\r\nsavage races, or the \"hand-fasting\" of the Scotch people, of which we\r\nhave spoken in Chapter VI. People who tolerate and defend prostitution\r\nshould be ashamed of their hypocrisy and of the manner in which they\r\ndistort morality, when in the same breath they reproach peasants with\r\ntheir natural but illegitimate unions.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that other causes of degeneration may exist in\r\nthe country as well as in towns; for instance, certain endemic\r\ndiseases, such as myxoedema and malaria, the brutish life of certain\r\ntribes, perpetuation of degeneracy by consanguineous unions, etc.\r\n\r\nThe worst state is certainly that of the proletariat of large towns,\r\nwhich is generally associated with crime. In the community of pimps,\r\ncriminals and decadents in general, is constituted a special social\r\noutlook, which regards the greatest scamp in the light of a hero. When\r\na child shows a precocious criminal disposition it is looked upon in\r\nthese circles as a child of much promise. Honest and virtuous children\r\nare considered in this society as imbeciles, or even as traitors and\r\nspies, and are consequently despised, hated and ill-treated. The\r\ndeleterious influences we have mentioned do not act alone, but are\r\noften associated with other factors in causing degeneration of the\r\nsexual life. When other influences preponderate, we may sometimes\r\nobserve depravity in the country, and on the contrary, healthy and\r\nnormal conditions in certain towns. We must always avoid exaggerating\r\nthe importance of a single factor in making generalizations. Certain\r\ncountry villages, the inhabitants of which have become alcoholized and\r\ndegraded, may present a much more unhealthy sexual life than certain\r\nsober and well-governed towns.\r\n\r\n=Vagabondage.=--In the _Archiv für Rassen und Gesellschafts biologie_\r\nof 1905 (Archives of the biology of races and of society), Doctor\r\nJörger relates the history of the descendants of a couple of\r\nvagabonds, which he carefully studied for several generations. Nearly\r\nall the members of this family became vagabonds, thieves, prostitutes,\r\nand other society pests. Vain attempts were made to give a good\r\neducation to some of them, but they ran away from school to lead the\r\nlives of vagabonds or criminals. In a few of them only, education gave\r\nsome results, but not at all brilliant. In this family, alcoholism and\r\nits blastophthoria played a considerable part.\r\n\r\nWe can hardly admit that the mnemic phenomena explained in Chapter I\r\ncould have acted appreciably in two or three hundred years, a period\r\nmuch too short for the human species. No doubt the common ancestor of\r\nthe above family of vagabonds descended from a family of vagabonds. I\r\ndo not, however, think I am wrong in attributing to blastophthoria,\r\nsuperposed on the disastrous combinations of germs which is inevitable\r\nin the life of vagabonds, the principal cause of this typical\r\ndegeneration of the family, a degeneration in which sexual degradation\r\nstrongly predominates. I recommend Doctor Jörger's work to any one\r\ninterested in this question. It would be useful to draw up\r\ngenealogical tables, with the medical and psychological descriptions\r\nof the whole population of a small town.\r\n\r\n=Americanism.=--By this term I designate an unhealthy feature of\r\nsexual life, common among the educated classes of the United States,\r\nand apparently originating in the greed for dollars, which is more\r\nprevalent in North America than anywhere else. I refer to the\r\nunnatural life which Americans lead, and more especially to its sexual\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nThe true American citizen despises agricultural work and manual labor\r\nin general, especially for women. His aim is to centralize labor by\r\nmeans of machinery and commerce, so as to concern himself only with\r\nbusiness, intellectual occupations and sport. American women consider\r\nmuscular work and labor in the country as degrading to their sex. This\r\nis a relic of the days of slavery, when all manual labor was left to\r\nnegroes, and is so to a great extent at the present day.\r\n\r\nDesirous of remaining young and fresh as long as possible, fearing the\r\ndangers and troubles of childbirth and the bringing-up of children,\r\nthe American woman has an increasing aversion to pregnancy,\r\nchildbirth, suckling and the rearing of large families.\r\n\r\nSince the emancipation of negroes has caused domestic servants in the\r\nUnited States to become expensive luxuries, family life has been to a\r\ngreat extent replaced by life in hotels and boarding-houses, and this\r\nhas furnished another reason for avoiding conception and large\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this form of emancipation of women is absolutely\r\ndeleterious and that it leads to degeneration, if not to extinction of\r\nthe race. The mixed Aryan (European) race of North America will\r\ndiminish and become gradually extinguished, even without emigration,\r\nand will soon be replaced by Chinese or negroes. It is necessary for\r\nwoman to labor as well as man, and she ought not to avoid the\r\nfulfillment of her natural position. Every race which does not\r\nunderstand this necessity ends in extinction. A woman's ideal ought\r\nnot to consist in reading novels and lolling in rocking chairs, nor in\r\nworking only in offices and shops, so as to preserve her delicate skin\r\nand graceful figure. She ought to develop herself strongly and\r\nhealthily by working along with man in body and mind, and by\r\nprocreating numerous children, when she is strong, robust and\r\nintelligent. But this does not nullify the advantage that may accrue\r\nfrom limiting the number of conceptions, when the bodily and mental\r\nqualities are wanting in the procreators.\r\n\r\n=Saloons and Alcohol.=--I desire to draw attention once more to the\r\nevil influence of saloons and bars. The drink habit corrupts the whole\r\nof sexual life. It is the origin of the most hideous forms of\r\nprostitution and proxenetism, and leads to the seduction of girls. I\r\nmust mention again the barmaids whose business it is to attract\r\ncustomers by exciting their sexual desire, at the same time exploiting\r\nthemselves by prostitution. These saloons are dens of iniquity in\r\nwhich alcohol and prostitution are inextricably confounded. In Germany\r\nthey have become a veritable social plague.\r\n\r\nDrink makes men and women not only gross and sensual, but also\r\nnegligent, imprudent and irreflective. The saloon takes men from their\r\nhomes, and drink directly diminishes the population. This is seen in\r\nRussia by comparing the abstainers with the drinkers, the former being\r\nmuch more fecund. The statistics of Doctor Bezzola show that a single\r\ndrinking bout may have a blastophthoric effect. From this and from\r\nother causes result the deplorable consequences of coitus which takes\r\nplace during drunkenness.[7]\r\n\r\n=Wealth and Poverty.=--While in former civilizations the rich man\r\nregarded a multiplicity of wives and children as a condition or cause\r\nof his wealth and also as its result, in our modern civilization the\r\nnumber of children diminishes with the increase of prosperity.\r\nChildren have ceased to be as formerly a source of wealth; on the\r\ncontrary, they occasion much expense for their education. Again, the\r\nhigher the social position of woman the more she fears pregnancy. Her\r\nlife of ease makes her weaker and more delicate, so that she becomes\r\nless fit for the procreation of children. This phenomenon is an\r\nunhealthy product of culture and reaches a truly pathological degree\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned marriage for money, which is the prostitution of the\r\nrich, and poverty, which is one of the causes of common prostitution,\r\nand we have seen how money influences sexual intercourse. We may now\r\nstate the general principle that a mediocrity living in comfortable\r\ncircumstances without immediate daily wants, under good hygienic\r\nconditions, but requiring a man to work for his living, constitutes\r\nthe best condition both for a healthy sexual life and for health and\r\nhappiness in general. This is the _aurea mediocritas_, or modest\r\ncompetence, the excellence of which was recognized by the ancients.\r\n\r\nThe sexuality of the rich man degenerates by luxury, comfort, excess\r\nand idleness, and by the fact that he is already satiated in his\r\nyouth. That of the poor man is no less degenerate, owing to bad food,\r\nunhealthy dwellings, neglected education, and by vicious example which\r\nat the opposite extreme, resembles in many points that of the rich\r\nman; the exploiter and the exploited meeting in the dens of vice. Such\r\nis the case with gambling hells, with dens for prostitution and\r\nsexual anomalies, where the poor blackmail the rich, while the latter\r\nin their capacity as social exploiters help to maintain poverty and\r\nprostitution.\r\n\r\nMoney makes sexual intercourse unnatural; in place of letting coitus\r\ntake its natural course, it makes it an object of amusement and\r\npleasure, and also of speculation, and it debases the bodies of\r\nwretched girls by making them objects of commerce.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the increasing facility of obtaining money without\r\nworking for it, due to civilization, not only corrupts the sexual life\r\nof the wealthy and the poverty stricken, but has the same effect on\r\nthe middle classes. A healthy and normal sexual life must be\r\nassociated with honest and arduous work. We have already remarked that\r\nthe solution of the sexual question depends partly on the suppression\r\nof alcoholic drink. We may add that another side of the question\r\ndepends on the extirpation of the greed for money. If human beings\r\ncould work for the social welfare without private interest, sexual\r\nrelations would soon take their natural course. But it must be\r\nadmitted that it is difficult to find a practical solution for the\r\nproblem of social economy.\r\n\r\n=Rank and Social Position.=--Class distinction and social position\r\nhave always played a part in sexual life. This is especially the case\r\nwhere certain class customs and prejudices prescribe a special code\r\nfor marriage. The consanguinity of the nobility and of royal families,\r\nwho can only marry among themselves, has resulted in obvious\r\ndegeneration. Originally there was the desire to preserve the purity\r\nof noble blood, and rules formulated with this object at first had\r\nsome success; but in the long run the exclusiveness of such selection\r\nproduces degeneration of the group which puts it into practice.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the severe rules which govern marriages among the\r\nnobility have resulted in driving the latter to extra-nuptial sexual\r\nintercourse. In their sexual excesses, the nobility, and even crowned\r\nheads, seldom amuse themselves with honest and virtuous girls of the\r\nworking classes, but more generally with actresses of loose morals,\r\ndancing girls, and hysterical sirens and adventuresses of all kinds,\r\nso long as they are pretty. Since the time of the feudal system, the\r\nnobility, having lost its real reason for existence, only lives on its\r\ntraditions. It remains in general in a state of idle depravity,\r\nfaithful to its old traditions, except when it has succeeded in\r\nadapting itself to the work of modern life. It has, in fact, preserved\r\nthe vices of its ancestors rather than their virtues.\r\n\r\nThe more than doubtful offspring of extra-nuptial intercourse among\r\nthe nobility have often been adopted or raised to the nobility.\r\nMoreover, kings and princes have often ennobled unworthy persons who\r\nhad succeeded in pandering to their follies or exciting their sexual\r\npassions. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at if in the offspring\r\nof such unions, the blood of the highest nobility is tainted with that\r\nof the worst kinds of heredity.\r\n\r\nAnother sign or effect of the degeneration of the nobility is found in\r\nthe marriages they so often contract with wealthy heiresses, often of\r\nmediocre quality, in order to repair their escutcheon. In the Middle\r\nAges, the nobility regarded it as degrading to work for their living,\r\nand this prejudice accelerated their degeneration; for nowadays the\r\nheroic and chivalrous deeds of the Middle Ages have little opportunity\r\nfor their performance.\r\n\r\nOther social classes present certain sexual peculiarities; for example\r\nthe disastrous consequences of celibacy among the Catholic priests.\r\nThis excludes an important and intelligent portion of the species from\r\nreproduction, and also favors clandestine debauchery.\r\n\r\nThe army and navy also exert a detrimental action on sexual life.\r\nFirst of all they foster one of the lowest forms of prostitution;\r\nsoldiers' women are proverbial, and one of them alone may infect a\r\nwhole regiment. In the second place, the absence of normal sexual\r\nintercourse favors all kinds of perversion, such as pederasty,\r\nmasturbation, etc. The abominable sexual life of soldiers and sailors\r\ncorrupts them to such an extent that when they marry later on they\r\ncome to their wives with filthy habits, to say nothing of syphilis and\r\ngonorrhea. The result is the procreation of offspring who are more or\r\nless tainted in body and mind by the effects of venereal disease\r\ncombined with alcohol. We have already mentioned the rules which\r\nforbid German officers to marry a woman unless she possesses a certain\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nIn the Norwegian mercantile marine the customs contrast happily with\r\nthose we have just mentioned, and permit officers to live on board\r\nwith their wives. In all respects the Norwegian serves as a model in\r\nthe sexual question; does he not favor conjugal life by only charging\r\nhalf-price on the boats for women who travel with their husbands!\r\n\r\nOther classes have a less obvious influence on sexual life. On the\r\nwhole, however, all sexual isolation of castes has an unfavorable\r\ninfluence. Wherever the prejudices of a caste compel its members to\r\nintermarry, certain special degenerations are produced. Good quality\r\nin man is not derived from class or position, but from true innate or\r\nhereditary nobility of character, and this alone should be the object\r\nof positive selection, without any distinction of classes.\r\n\r\n=Individual Life.=--There is no doubt that the mode of life of the\r\nindividual exerts an influence on his sexual life. High living\r\ncombined with little bodily exercise generally increases the sexual\r\nappetite, while insufficient food combined with severe muscular work\r\ndiminishes it.\r\n\r\nIntellectual work acts in a variable manner. A distinguished\r\npsychologist assured me that intense intellectual work excited his\r\nsexual appetite; others have said the opposite. As a rule, a sedentary\r\nlife increases the sexual appetite; a life full of occupation and\r\nmuscular activity diminishes it. But the question is complicated by\r\nother influences.\r\n\r\nAlcohol diminishes sexual power, while exalting desire or even\r\nperverting it. The artificial excitants of the sexual appetite,\r\ncultivated by modern civilization by interested speculation, act in\r\nrather a different way. Erotic pictures, obscene novels and dramas,\r\netc., constitute an unhealthy medium in our centers of civilization,\r\nwhich overexcites and corrupts the sexual appetite. The more delicate\r\nand poisonous the perfume of this atmosphere and the more æsthetic the\r\nrefinement by which it titillates the senses, the greater is its\r\ndestructive action.\r\n\r\nThe question of the reunion or separation of the sexes plays an\r\nimportant part. Life in common among girls and boys from infancy\r\nusually diminishes sexual excitation, in the same way as among\r\nbrothers and sisters. We find something analogous in different\r\nbranches of human activity where the two sexes live together; for\r\ninstance, at college, in the fields, and in general where work and\r\nplay is common to both sexes.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, certain exceptions to this rule, which must not be\r\ntaken too generally. Under certain circumstances, life in common of\r\nthe two sexes leads to unfavorable and even perverted sexual\r\nexcitation. This is especially the case when alcohol adds its\r\ninfluence; also among nervous or ill-balanced individuals. In my\r\nopinion it is absolutely unreasonable for the superintendent of a\r\nlunatic asylum to organize balls at which the insane of both sexes are\r\nprovided with beer or wine. I have only seen bad results from this,\r\nwhile I have obtained excellent effects from a temporary reunion of\r\nthe insane of both sexes, by avoiding all alcoholic drinks as well as\r\neverything which could excite the sexual appetite, such as dancing, or\r\nthe bringing together of erotic or perverted individuals. A young\r\nfemale onanist who suffered from sexual excitement complicated with a\r\nnervous condition, complained to me of being obliged to work as a\r\ntelegraphist among young men, as this continually excited her\r\neroticism without the possibility of satisfying it.\r\n\r\nThis situation, which is a common one in both sexes, gives us a\r\nvaluable indication. No doubt life in common for the two sexes is\r\nnormal and natural, but only on the condition that it leads eventually\r\nto normal sexual intercourse as the result of love. It is neither\r\nhealthy nor normal to excite an appetite continually without\r\nsatisfying it. Any one who wishes to live a continent life, for\r\nreligious or other reasons, ought not to expose himself to continual\r\nexcitement by too great intimacy with the opposite sex; he should, on\r\nthe contrary, avoid everything which tends to excite his sexual\r\nappetite and seek everything which tends to pacify it. I am not\r\nreferring here to individuals of a naturally cold and indifferent\r\nnature, who run little or no risk under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nCertain occupations, such as those of employees in stores, telegraph\r\noffices, etc., in which the two sexes are closely associated in their\r\nwork, constitute from this point of view a double-edged sword. Other\r\nunhealthy and monotonous occupations, combined with bad conditions of\r\nfood and lodging, and with all kinds of seduction--factory hands for\r\nexample--have a positively deleterious effect on sexual life, which\r\nbecomes absolutely depraved when the two sexes work together. The\r\nsituation is hardly any better when they are only separated during\r\nworking hours.\r\n\r\n=Internats.=--All internats, _i.e._, all establishments where\r\nindividuals of the same sex live in the same dwelling for a long time,\r\nexert a peculiar influence on sexual life--schools and convents, for\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nThe great inconvenience of all these establishments lies in the danger\r\nof contamination from habits of onanism or pederasty. Inverts are\r\nstrongly attracted towards internats, where they find their heart's\r\ndesire where they can easily indulge their perverted passions; the\r\ndormitory of such an institution having the same effect on them as\r\nthat of a girl's school would have on a young man. (Vide Chapter\r\nVIII.)\r\n\r\nThis is a matter which has not received sufficient attention in\r\norganizing boarding-schools for boys and girls, because it was not\r\nknown that homosexual instincts are hereditary and innate. Such cases\r\nwere regarded only as acquired bad habits.\r\n\r\nLunatic asylums are especially attractive to sexual inverts, who apply\r\nfor the positions of attendants or nurse so as to be able to indulge\r\ntheir passions on the insane patients, who are incapable of betraying\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWithout being homosexual, nor even seduced by inverts, many normal but\r\nerotic individuals try to satisfy their sexual appetite on their\r\ncompanions--boys by pederasty, girls by lesbian love, and both sexes\r\nby mutual onanism.\r\n\r\nThe chief danger is that of some sexually perverted individual gaining\r\nentry to a boarding-school and contaminating numbers of normal\r\nindividuals, without anything being discovered; because it is much\r\nmore difficult to supervise a school than a family. This could be\r\nremedied better by confidence between masters and pupils than by\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\n=Varia.=--I should never finish if I attempted to describe all the\r\ninfluences of environment. The examples mentioned will suffice to\r\nshow that, in a natural appetite such as the sexual, the two extremes\r\nof asceticism and excess lead to evil and unnatural aberrations, and\r\nthat the important point is to find or create a healthy environment\r\nfor a healthy sexual life.\r\n\r\nWe hear a good deal about good or bad luck or chance in the matter of\r\nlove. I do not deny that fortuitous circumstances often determine the\r\nhappiness of an individual in his love affairs. But it is all the more\r\ndeplorable that what is called the good manners of society make it so\r\ndifficult to correct Cupid's blunders. There is room for improvement\r\nin this direction, and many spoilt lives and much unhappiness might be\r\navoided. The unfavorable influence of environment might often be\r\ncorrected by separation or change, if this could be done in time.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Vide \"Alkoholvergiftung und Degeneration\" by Bunge: Leipzig 1904;\r\nand \"Hygiene of the Nerves and Mind\" by Forel: Stuttgart 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nRELIGION AND SEXUAL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Transformation of Profane Customs into Religious\r\nDogmas.=--Ethnography has taught us that in the course of time human\r\ntribes often unconsciously transform profane customs into integral\r\nparts of their religion, either by attributing them to a divine\r\norigin, or by elevating them to the rank of commandments of the gods,\r\nor by connecting them with other dogmas, combining them with worship,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nSexual connection plays an important part in this matter. A great\r\nnumber of religious rites and customs are nothing else than the\r\ncustoms of sexual life (taken in its widest sense) which have been\r\nsymbolized; inversely, a number of dogmas have for their only motive\r\nthe application of a religious basis to sexual customs, which gives\r\nthem more authority.\r\n\r\nThe religious rites react powerfully on the sexual life and on the way\r\nin which the members of the tribe or people understand it. We will\r\ngive a few striking examples.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in Chapter VI that polygamy depends first on the idea of\r\nownership, and secondly on marriage by purchase, to which it owes its\r\nhistoric origin. But the fact that Islamism and Mormonism, for\r\nexample, have made polygamy an integral part of their religious\r\ndogmas, has given to the whole organization of the Mahometans and\r\nMormons, as well as to their point of view of existence, a particular\r\ndirection which cannot be ignored. In reality, we are just as\r\npolygamous as they are, but our theoretical and religious sexual\r\nmorality is monogamous while theirs is polygamous, each based on\r\ncontradictory \"divine commandments.\"\r\n\r\nAmong certain Buddhists, the wife is compelled to follow her husband\r\nto the grave, which naturally influences sexual life profoundly.\r\n\r\nAmong many savage races there exists matriarchism, which gives the\r\nwoman a high social position. This has even been made a religious\r\ndogma, while it simply originates from the natural and just idea that\r\nthe mother is much more intimately connected with the children than\r\nthe father.\r\n\r\nThe duty imposed on men to marry the widow of their brother originated\r\nfrom a profane command intended to regulate unions; eventually this\r\nwas made a religious dogma. In the same way circumcision among the\r\nJews had its origin in a hygienic custom having no relation to\r\nreligious faith. This did not prevent it becoming later on as\r\nimportant a custom as baptism in Christianity. For the Jewish people\r\nit has the advantage of protecting them to a great extent from\r\nvenereal infection, and against one of the chief causes of\r\nmasturbation.\r\n\r\n=Catholicism.=--We have already spoken of the celibacy of the Catholic\r\npriests and of its lay origin. The Catholic religion also contains a\r\nseries of detailed precepts concerning sexual connection in general\r\nand marriage in particular; precepts which were only gradually\r\ntransformed into religious dogmas. As they determine to a great extent\r\nopinions and manners in the sexual domain, they exert a considerable\r\nsocial influence.\r\n\r\nThe absolute interdiction of divorce among the Catholics (man has not\r\nthe right to separate those whom God has joined together) seals\r\nforever the most unfortunate unions and leads to misfortunes of all\r\nkinds, separation of the married couple, _liaisons_ apart from\r\nmarriage, etc. According to Liguori, the Catholic Church prescribes a\r\nnumber of details concerning sexual relations in marriage. The woman\r\nwho, during coitus places herself upon the man instead of under him,\r\ncommits a sin. The position and manner of performing coitus are\r\nprescribed in the most minute details, and the holy fathers make the\r\nwoman play a part unworthy of her position as wife, while according\r\nthe man the widest liberty.\r\n\r\nIn truly Catholic marriage it is prescribed to procreate as many\r\nchildren as possible, and all preventive measures in coitus are\r\nseverely condemned. Hence, if the woman is very fruitful, the husband\r\nhas only the choice between complete abstention from coitus (when both\r\nconjoints are in agreement) and pregnancies following without\r\ninterruption. The woman never has the right to refuse coitus to her\r\nhusband, nor the latter to refuse it to his wife, so long as he is\r\ncapable of accomplishing it.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand what powerful effects such precepts have had\r\nand still have on the conjugal life of the Catholics, particularly on\r\nthe quantity and quality of their descendants.\r\n\r\n=Aural Confession.=--Confession requires special mention. In his book,\r\n\"Fifty Years in the Roman Church\" (Jeheber, Geneva), on page 151,\r\nFather Chiniqui, the celebrated Canadian reformer, who later on became\r\na Protestant, and for many years played an important part in the\r\nCanadian Catholic clergy, mentions the points on which the confessor\r\ninterrogates the penitents of both sexes. One cannot reproach him with\r\nbeing incompetent.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Church of to-day would reply that the confessor is not\r\nobliged to put all these questions and that the details are left to\r\nhis tact. We will agree that there is a difference between the Canada\r\nof the last century, a new and primitive country, and the Europe of\r\nthe present day. But I maintain: First, that the confessor does not\r\ncontent himself with listening to what the penitents of both sexes\r\ntell him, but that it is his duty to interrogate them; secondly, that\r\na celibate Catholic person, extremely serious and virtuous, to whom I\r\nput the question unawares, informed me that not only are sexual\r\nmatters dealt with at the confessional, but that they play the\r\nprincipal role. And, as it is a question of warning the penitents\r\nagainst so-called sins, mortal or not, or of absolving them, I fail to\r\nsee how the priest can avoid speaking of them, when the detailed\r\nprecepts of which we have spoken exist.\r\n\r\nI reproduce here the original Latin text. It deals with questions\r\nwhich have been treated in Chapter VIII, so that I shall dispense with\r\ngiving a translation.\r\n\r\nThe confessor puts the following questions to his penitents:\r\n\r\n1. _Peccant uxores, quae susceptum viri semen ejiciunt, vel ejicere\r\nconantur_ (Dens, vol. VII, p. 147).\r\n\r\n2. _Peccant conjuges mortaliter, si, copula incepta, prohibeant\r\nseminationem._\r\n\r\n3. _Si vir jam seminaverit, dubium fit an femina lethaliter peccat,\r\nsi se retrahat a seminando; aut peccat lethaliter vir non expectando\r\nseminationem uxoris_ (p. 153).\r\n\r\n4. _Peccant conjuges inter se circa actum conjugalem. Debet servari\r\nmodus, sive situs; uno ut non servetur debitum vas, sed copula\r\nhabeatur in vase praepostero, aliquoque non naturali. Si fiat\r\naccedendo a postero, a latere, stando, sedendo, vel si vir sit\r\nsuccumbus_ (p. 166).\r\n\r\n5. _Impotentia. Est incapacitas perficiendi copulam carnalem perfectam\r\ncum seminatione viri in vase se debito, seu, de se, aptam generationi.\r\nVel, ut si mulier sit nimis arcta respectu unius non respectu\r\nalterius_ (p. 273).\r\n\r\n6. _Notatur quod pollutio, in mulieribus possit perfici, ita ut semen\r\nearum non effluat extra membrum genitale. Indicium istius allegat\r\nBilluart, si scilicet mulier sensiat seminis resolutionem cum magno\r\nvoluptatis sensu, qua completa, passio satiatur_ (vol. IV, p. 168).\r\n\r\n7. _Uxor se accusans, in confessione, quod negaverit debitum,\r\ninterrogatur an ex pleno rigore juris sui id petiverit_ (vol. VII, p.\r\n168).\r\n\r\n8. _Confessarius poenitentem, qui confitetur se peccasse cum\r\nsacerdote, vel solicitatem ab eo ad turpia, potest interrogare utrum\r\nille sacerdos sit ejus confessarius, an in confessione sollicitaverit_\r\n(vol. VI, p. 297).\r\n\r\nIn volumes V and VII of Dens may be found many such precepts,\r\nimpossible to reproduce, on which the pious casuist desires his\r\npenitents to be examined.\r\n\r\nLet us now pass on to the celebrated Liguori. Among numerous other\r\nobscene questions of a refined erotic nature, every confessor is bound\r\nto put the two following to his penitents:\r\n\r\n1. _Quaerat an sit semper mortale, si vir immitat pudenda in os\r\nuxoris...?_\r\n\r\n_Verius affirmo, quia in hoc actu, ob calorem oris, adest proximum\r\npericulum pollutionis, et videtur nova species luxuriae contra\r\nnaturam, dicta irruminatio._\r\n\r\n2. _Eodem modo, Sanchez damnat virum de mortali qui, in actu copulae,\r\nimmite ret digitum in vas praeposterum uxoris; quia, ut ait, in hoc\r\nactu, adest affectus ad-Sodomiam_ (Liguori, t. VI, p. 935).\r\n\r\nLet us now leave the celebrated Liguori and pass on to Burchard, the\r\nbishop of Worms. He has written a book on the questions which the\r\npriest should put at the confessional. Although this book no longer\r\nexists it has been for ages the guide of the Roman Catholic priests at\r\nthe confessional. Dens, Liguori, Debreyne, etc., have taken from it\r\ntheir most savory passages, to recommend them as a study for our\r\npresent confessors. We will give a few examples:\r\n\r\n(_a_) To young men:\r\n\r\n1. _Fecisti solus tecum fornicationem ut quidam facere solent; ita\r\ndico ut ipse tuum membrum virile in manum tuam acciperes, et sic\r\nduceres praeputium tuum, et manu propria commoveres, ut sic per illam\r\ndelectationem semen projiceres?_\r\n\r\n2. _Fornicationem fecisti cum masculo intra coxas; ita dico ut tuum\r\nvirile membrum intra coxas alterius mitteres, et sic agitando semen\r\nfunderes?_\r\n\r\n3. _Fecisti fornicationem, ut quidam facere solent, ut tuum virile\r\nmembrum in lignum perforatum aut in aliquod hujus modi mitteres et sic\r\nper illam commotionem et delectationem semen projiceres?_\r\n\r\n4. _Fecisti fornicationem contra naturam, id est, cum masculis vel\r\nanimalibus coire, id est, cum equo, cum vacca vel asina, vel aliquo\r\nanimali?_ (vol. I, p. 136).\r\n\r\n(_b_) To young girls or women (same collection, p. 115):\r\n\r\n1. _Fecisti quod quaedam mulieres solent, quoddam molimen, aut\r\nmachinamentum in modum virilis membri ad mensuram tuae voluptatis, et\r\nillud loco verendorum tuorum aut alterius cum aliquibus ligaturis ut\r\nfornicationem faceres cum aliis mulieribus, vel alio eodem\r\ninstrumento, sive alio tecum?_\r\n\r\n2. _Fecisti quod quaedam mulieres facere solent, ut jam supra dicto\r\nmolimine vel alio aliquo machinamento, tu ipsa in te solam faceres\r\nfornicationem?_\r\n\r\n3. _Fecisti quod quaedam mulieres facere solent, quando libidinem se\r\nvexantem extinguere volunt, quae se conjugunt quasi coire debeant et\r\npossint, et conjungunt invicem puerperio sua, et si fricando pruritum\r\nillarum extinguere desiderant?_\r\n\r\n4. _Fecisti quod quaedam mulieres facere solent, ut cum filio tuo\r\nparvulo fornicationem faceres, ita dico ut filium tuum supra\r\nturpidinem tuam poneres ut sic imitaberis fornicationem?_\r\n\r\n5. _Fecisti quod quaedam mulieres facere solent, ut succumberes aliquo\r\njumento et illud jumentum ad coitum qualicumque posses ingenio ut sic\r\ncoiret tecum?_\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Debreyne has written a whole book on the same subject\r\nfor the instruction of young confessors, and in it he has enumerated\r\nall kinds of debauchery and sexual perversion which he could imagine,\r\n\"Maechiology,\" or _Treatise on all the Sins against the Sixth_\r\n(seventh in the Decalogue) _and the Ninth_ (tenth) _Commandments_, as\r\nwell as on all questions of married life connected with them.\r\n\r\nThis book is very celebrated and is widely studied in the Roman\r\nChurch. We only quote from it the two following questions:\r\n\r\nTo men:\r\n\r\n_Ad cognoscendum an usque ad pollutionem se tetigerint, quando tempore\r\net quo fine se tetigerint; an tunc quoddam motus in corpore experti\r\nfuerint, et per quantum temporis spatium; an cessantibus tactibus\r\nnihil insolitum et turpe acciderit; ad non longe majorem in corpore\r\nvoluptatem perciperint in fine inactum quam in eorum principio; an tum\r\nin fine quando magnam delectationem carnalem senserunt, omnes motus\r\ncorporis cessaverint; an non malefacti fuerint?_ etc., etc.\r\n\r\nTo girls:\r\n\r\n_Quae sese tetigisse fatentur, an non aliquem pruritum extinguere\r\ntentaverit, et utrum pruritus ille cessaverit cum magnam senserint\r\nvoluptatem; an tunc ipsimet tactus cessaverint?_\r\n\r\nAmong a thousand other analogous precepts the reverend Kenrick, bishop\r\nof Boston, in the United States, gives the following to his\r\nconfessors:\r\n\r\n_Uxor quae, in usu matrimonii, se vertit, ut non recipiat semen, vel\r\nstatim post illud acceptum surgit, ut expellatur, lethaliter peccat;\r\nsed opus non est ut diu resuspina jaceat, quum matrix, brevi semen\r\nattrahat, et mox, arctissime claudatur._\r\n\r\n_Puellae patienti licet se vertere et conari ut non recipiat semen,\r\nquod injuria et emittitur; sed, acceptum non licet expellere, quia jam\r\npossessionem pacificam habet et haud absque injuria naturae\r\nejiceretur._\r\n\r\n_Conjuges senes plerumque coeunt absque culpa, licet contingat semen\r\nextra vas effundi; id enim per accidens fit ex infirmitati naturae._\r\n\r\n_Quod si vires adeo sint fractae ut nulla sit seminandi intra vas\r\nspes, jam nequeunt jure conjugi uti_ (vol. III, p. 317).\r\n\r\nSuch is the teaching of Chiniqui, the man whose courage and powerful\r\nindividuality succeeded in introducing abstinence from alcohol in\r\nCanada. His long life was that of a pioneer and an inflexible champion\r\nof social and moral reform in that country, based on Christianity. He\r\ndied at the age of ninety.\r\n\r\nI have quoted the erotic precepts of the confessional from him, as I\r\nwas anxious to quote from an absolutely reliable source. It was not\r\nwith a light heart that Chiniqui abandoned the Catholic Church, but\r\nonly after violent and bitter struggles with conscience, struggles of\r\nwhich he relates the tragic episodes, and which lasted for many years.\r\n\r\nHe commences the chapter from which we have quoted with the following\r\nwords: \"Let legislators, fathers and husbands read this chapter and\r\nask themselves the question whether the respect which they owe to\r\ntheir mothers, their wives and their daughters does not impose upon\r\nthem the duty of forbidding auricular confession. How is it possible\r\nfor a young girl to remain pure in mind after such conversations with\r\nan unmarried man? Is she not more prepared for the depths of vice than\r\nfor conjugal life?\" The author of these lines is a man who was obliged\r\nfor many years to be a confessor himself, and who understood to what\r\nextent confession corrupted the sexual life of women and priests. It\r\nis true that persons, priests or women, of strong character, and\r\nespecially those with a cold nature from the sexual point of view, may\r\nresist such sexual excitation. But has confession been specially\r\ninstituted for this type of character? Every one who is not a\r\nhypocrite will own that it is exactly the contrary.\r\n\r\n=Religious Prudery.=--The results of such a combination of sexual life\r\nwith religious prescriptions are a mixture of ridiculous prudery and\r\ncontinual eroticism. In certain convents (those of the nuns of\r\nGalicia, for example) the nuns forbid their pupils to wash the sexual\r\norgans, because it is improper! In Austria the nuns often cover the\r\ncrucifix in their bedroom with a handkerchief, \"so that Christ cannot\r\nsee their nakedness\"! But the convents of nuns, in the Middle Ages,\r\nwere often transformed into brothels; and it is not uncommon to see\r\nhypocrites or the subjects of erotic hysteria (both men and women)\r\nperform sexual orgies of the worst kind under the cloak of religious\r\necstasy.\r\n\r\n=Hottentots. Eunuchs.=--Among the Hottentots, the lips of the vulva\r\n(_labia minora_) in women are artificially elongated, and among the\r\nOrientals eunuchs are made. In themselves these two operations have\r\ncertainly nothing to do with religion and only originated in profane\r\ncustoms. In the course of time they were made religious precepts,\r\nwhich has deeply rooted them in the customs of the people.\r\n\r\n=Religious Eroticism.=--The examples which we have cited show to what\r\nextent man is disposed to clothe his eroticism with the cloak of\r\nreligion. He then attributes a divine origin to his desires and lays\r\nthe precepts which he attaches to them on the commandments of his God\r\nor gods, so as to sanctify them. Hence, the unnatural influence of a\r\nmysticism, which is nothing else than the crystallized product of the\r\nfantastic imagination of men, raised to a dogma, imposes itself\r\nindirectly on natural sexual life, by entering at the back door under\r\nthe cloak of religion. It is obvious that grave abuses or even vices\r\noften acquire the seal and power of religious precepts; while in the\r\nsame domain a number of other customs or precepts are based on good\r\nhygienic or moral principles, for example, circumcision and conjugal\r\nfidelity.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps in the domain of pathology that the relations of\r\nreligion to sexual life are the most striking (see Chapter VIII). We\r\nmust not forget that the facts of reproduction seem to ignorant people\r\nand especially to barbarians, to be of a very mysterious nature. These\r\npeople have no idea of germinal cells or their conjugation. They see\r\nin conception, embryogeny, pregnancy and birth, the miraculous effects\r\nof a divine and occult higher power--of the divinity, often even of\r\nthe devil.\r\n\r\nThe violent excitement which is associated with the sexual appetite\r\nand with love urges man to ecstasy; hence it is not to be wondered at\r\nthat eroticism is so often complicated by ecstatic religious\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\nIn his book on Psychopathia sexualis, Krafft-Ebing remarks how easily\r\nreligion, poetry and eroticism are combined and mingled in the obscure\r\nfeelings and presentiments of maturing youth. In the life of saints\r\nthere is always the question of sexual temptations, in which the most\r\nelevated and ideal sentiments are mixed with the most repugnant erotic\r\nimages. On the same basis are developed the sexual orgies of different\r\nreligious fêtes in the ancient world, as well as in certain modern\r\nsects.\r\n\r\nMysticism, religious ecstasy and sexual voluptuousness are often\r\ncombined in a real trinity, and one often sees unsatisfied sensuality\r\nseek compensation in religious exaltation. Krafft-Ebing cites the\r\nfollowing cases from Friedreich's \"Legal Psychology\" (p. 389):\r\n\r\n    In this way the nun Blaubekin was perpetually tormented by the\r\n    thought of what happened to the part of Jesus' body removed by\r\n    circumcision.\r\n\r\n    In order to make his devotions to the lamb of God, Véronique\r\n    Juliani, who was canonized by Pope Pius II, took into his\r\n    chamber a terrestrial lamb, embraced it and sucked its breasts.\r\n\r\n    Saint Catherine of Gênes often suffered from such internal heat,\r\n    that, to cool herself, she laid on the ground, crying: \"Love,\r\n    love, I can do no more!\" In doing this she felt a peculiar\r\n    inclination for her confessor. One day, putting his hand to her\r\n    nose, she perceived an odor which penetrated her heart, \"a\r\n    celestial odor the voluptuousness of which could wake the dead.\"\r\n\r\n=The Role of Mental Pathology in Religious Eroticism.=--Among the\r\ninsane, and especially in women, but also in men afflicted with\r\n_paranoia_ (a mental disease) we often find a strange and repugnant\r\nmixture of eroticism and religious images. Such are the everlasting\r\nbetrothals with Christ, the Virgin Mary, with God or with the Holy\r\nSpirit, betrothals in which the venereal orgasm is combined with\r\nimaginary coitus and masturbation, followed by imaginary pregnancy and\r\nchildbirth. These symptoms give us a clear indication of the relation\r\nwhich exists between eroticism and religious exaltation. The French\r\nalienists have even designated them by the characteristic term of\r\n\"erotico-religious delirium.\" A single visit to the female division of\r\na lunatic asylum is often sufficient to satisfy the visitor.\r\n\r\nA point which has received less attention is the immense historical\r\ninfluence which certain psychopathological personalities, chiefly\r\nhysterical subjects, but also some crazy persons or hereditary\r\nvisionaries, have exercised at all times on human destiny, usually by\r\nthe aid of the suggestive effects of sexual and religious ideas\r\n(erotico-religious), the connections of which have not always been\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nEvery psychiatrist knows the insane whose delirium is combined with\r\nreligious or mystic exaltation, and who by the mysticism of their\r\ndelirium have exercised and continue to exercise a profound influence\r\non the mass of humanity which surround them--\"Panurge's Sheep,\" if I\r\nmay use the expression. These people are themselves so dominated by\r\nthe pathological influence of their auto-suggestions or their delirium\r\nthat they behave with the fanaticism of fakirs, and exhibit an\r\nextraordinary energy and perseverance in the pursuit of the object of\r\ntheir morbid ideas. By their assurance, the sentiment of\r\ninfallibility, and the fire of faith which is manifested in their\r\nprophetical manner, they fascinate the feeble brains of the people who\r\nsurround them and attract them by their suggestive action.\r\n\r\nA very human and often powerful eroticism is usually associated with\r\ntheir delirium; but it is covered by a cloak of religious ecstasy,\r\nwhich imposes on natures disposed to exaltation, and renders them\r\nblind to the ignominy which often lies under this ecstasy.\r\n\r\nWhat makes these patients so persuasive is the fact that they are\r\nthemselves persuaded. Even the normal man, we must admit, is guided\r\nless by reason than by sentiment, and the persons we have just\r\ndescribed exert a powerful action on sentiment, and this more by their\r\npiercing glance, their prophetic and dominating tone, their manner and\r\nappearance, than by the extremely confused text of their discourses\r\nand doctrines.\r\n\r\nIn this way there are always arising small epidemics of attraction in\r\nwhich a group of individuals allows itself to be infatuated by\r\nso-called prophets, messiahs, holy virgins and other visionaries, who\r\nare only lunatics or crazy persons. Under their influence are produced\r\ncertain forms of insanity by contagion, which have been called double,\r\ntriple or quadruple madness, and which may sometimes take the form of\r\nan epidemic.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"prophet\" is more consistent in his words and actions, or\r\nwhen his environment is still very ignorant and superstitious, the\r\ncrowd of believers increases still more rapidly, and thus one sees\r\neven at the present day in less-civilized countries new sects or\r\nreligious guilds, more or less ephemeral, in which the spirit of the\r\nprophet sometimes stirs up grave sexual orgies.\r\n\r\nAmong more cultured people the prophet is generally exposed or sent to\r\na lunatic asylum, much to the indignation of his disciples, who often\r\nconsist of his wife and children and a few feeble-minded\r\nacquaintances.\r\n\r\nThanks to the cheapness of printing, these prophets often publish\r\ntheir new religious system and sell it among their dupes. I possess a\r\nsmall library of works of this kind which have been sent me by their\r\nauthors; probably with the idea that they might one day be taken for\r\nfools, and to prove to me in advance that they were not.\r\n\r\nAccording to them, God has personally revealed to them the new truth\r\nin which they believe, and has appointed them as prophets. Erotic\r\nimages are generally associated with their system. One of them, whose\r\nsystem is astronomical, divides the planets into males and females.\r\nAnother, a lunatic, describes the pathological sexual sensations by\r\nthe term of \"psycho-sexual contact by action at a distance.\" These are\r\nphenomena which we meet with at each step in psychiatry, and which\r\ngive the clue to what follows.\r\n\r\n=The Historical Role of Mental Anomalies which are Not Very Apparent\r\nand Border on Genius. Their Influence on Religious Eroticism.=--These\r\npersons are not always afflicted with paranoia or other grave\r\npsychoses, but often hereditary and constitutional psychopaths who are\r\nonly half-crazy or simply hysterical, and who may, in spite of this\r\ndefect, possess a certain degree of intellectual power, an energetic\r\nwill and the fire of enthusiasm. Things then take an essentially\r\ndifferent course, even when they rest on an analogous basis.\r\n\r\nThe prophet combines with his exaltation a logic which is often very\r\nconcise in its details, although applied on a morbid basis. Moreover,\r\nhe clothes his utterances in fine and poetical language, and in this\r\nway succeeds in rallying round him, not a flock of Panurge's ignorant\r\nsheep, but more elevated people and even a considerable proportion of\r\nthe surrounding society. In this case pathological exaltation may be\r\nunited to a high moral and intellectual ideal, which is very apt to\r\nveil the bizarre fancies of the prophet. We thus meet with the\r\nastonishing but undeniable fact that certain great historical\r\npersonalities who have exercised a powerful influence on humanity were\r\nof more or less pathological nature. We discover among them\r\nerotico-religious traits, more or less marked, often even as the\r\nleading threads of their arguments.\r\n\r\nThis important category of individuals constitutes a whole series of\r\ntransitions between the insane prophets of whom we have spoken and\r\nwell-balanced men of genius. It is often very difficult to understand\r\nand interpret the series of intermediate forms, so graduating and so\r\nvariable, which exist between insanity and genius. It is necessary to\r\nguard against any exclusive generalization in one way or the other.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the fact that many men of genius are of pathological\r\nnature does not authorize us to regard every person of genius or\r\noriginality as insane, whether he attacks the routine and prejudices\r\nof his contemporaries, or whether he opens up new horizons and goes\r\nout of the beaten track. Let me cite a few examples.\r\n\r\nJoan of Arc was, in my opinion, a hysterical genius whose\r\nhallucinations were auto-suggestive. The distress of France had\r\nprofoundly agitated her, and, fired with the desire to save her\r\ncountry, her brain was affected by auto-suggestion with hallucinations\r\nof the voices of saints and visions, which pointed out her mission and\r\nwhich she regarded as coming from real saints in heaven. At that\r\nperiod such things were common enough and need not surprise us. In\r\nspite of her good sense and modesty, Joan of Arc was urged by an\r\nexaltation unconscious of self. By a destiny as astonishing as\r\nprovidential, this young girl of genius, and at the same time\r\npathological, exalted by ecstatic hallucinations, led France to a\r\nvictorious war of freedom. The most conscientious historical sources\r\nshow that the morality of Joan of Arc was pure and above reproach. Her\r\nreplies to the invidious questions of the Inquisition are admirable\r\nand bear witness both to her high intelligence and the moral elevation\r\nof her sentiments. It is evident that the sentiments of love were\r\ntransformed in her into religious ecstasy and enthusiasm for the ideal\r\nof her mission, a frequent occurrence among women.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable example is that of Thomas à Becket. The sudden\r\ntransformation of this man of the world into an ascetic priest (it is\r\ntrue, on the occasion of his nomination as archbishop), from this\r\ndevoted friend and servitor of the king of England into his most\r\nviolent adversary, and into a champion of the Church against the\r\nState, evidently represents the auto-suggestive transformation of a\r\nhysterical subject, for this is the only way of explaining such a\r\nsudden and complete contradiction which caused him to change suddenly\r\nfrom one fanaticism to a contrary one.\r\n\r\nThe religious exaltation of the Mormon prophet, Smith, was no doubt\r\ncombined with eroticism, which made him organize his sect on the basis\r\nof polygamy.\r\n\r\nMahomet also had visions, and sexual connection plays an important\r\npart in his teaching and prophesies. The apostle St. Paul was also a\r\nvisionary who passed suddenly from one extreme to another as the\r\nresult of hallucination. Pascal, Napoleon, and Rousseau presented very\r\nmarked pathological traits.\r\n\r\nAlthough some of these cases have no direct connection with the sexual\r\nquestion, I have mentioned them to show how such personalities exert\r\ntheir influence on the masses, and through them on history. As soon as\r\nthey acquire authority, their peculiar ideas and sexual conceptions,\r\nhowever exclusive or even absurd they may be, react strongly on their\r\ncontemporaries, as we see to-day the ascetic ideas of Tolstoi\r\ninfluence his numerous disciples.\r\n\r\nSudden conversions, whatever may be their nature, especially when the\r\nconvert goes from one extreme to another, are not the fruit of reason,\r\nbut depend on suggestion or auto-suggestion and especially on\r\npathological suggestibility. (Vide Chapter IX).\r\n\r\nIn other respects sexual anomalies often govern the acts of hysterical\r\npersons and other psychopaths. The Roman emperors, Nero, Tiberius and\r\nCaligula were almost certainly sadists and enjoyed sexual pleasure at\r\nthe sight of the sufferings of their victims. Valerie, Messalina and\r\nCatherine de Médici were also female sadists. Under the hypocritical\r\nveil of religion, Catherine de Médici was the principal instigator of\r\nthe Massacre of St. Bartholomew at Paris, and wallowed in pleasure at\r\nthe sight of the massacre of the Huguenots.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, masochism may give tone to the thoughts and sexual\r\nfeelings of certain persons of great influence, such as Rousseau, and\r\nto sects of ascetics, such as the fakirs, etc.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily, therefore, the sexual feelings of every prophet and\r\nfounder of religion, even during a short period of his life only,\r\ninfluence more or less his religious system and consequently the laws\r\nof morality based on it, which remain after his death.\r\n\r\nHence it is that sentiments, as variable in different individuals as\r\nsexual sentiments, are obliged to submit to the constraint of fixed\r\nand tyrannical dogmas which martyrize for centuries, or even thousands\r\nof years, men who have other opinions than the founder of the religion\r\nor its interpreters who succeed him.\r\n\r\nIn religion we see everywhere idealized eroticism, and often idealism\r\nperfumed with eroticism. The Songs of Solomon, the original sense of\r\nwhich was very lay, like that of most religious matters, has been made\r\nallegorical and applied to the Christian Church, but it was and will\r\nalways remain an erotic poem.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to add that natural eroticism very often leads\r\nthe severe and ascetic preachers of morality to the grossest\r\nhypocrisy. Priests and other pious persons often preach an idealized\r\nasceticism, while in secret they commit the most disgusting sexual\r\nexcesses.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, judge such crying inconsistencies too severely;\r\nthey are to a great extent unconscious and are the result of the shock\r\nof passion against the tyranny of dogma, prejudice, and public\r\nopinion. They are often also the result of mental anomalies. When\r\nscience is allowed to enlighten sexual life freely and openly, the\r\nhypocrisy of normal people will cease, and that of the abnormal will\r\nbe recognized in time and prevented from doing harm.\r\n\r\n=Transformation of Eroticism into Religious Sentiment.=--In ordinary\r\nlife we find everywhere traces of the mixture of religion with sexual\r\nsensations and images. The religious ceremonies of marriage among all\r\npeoples constitute a significant remnant thereof.\r\n\r\nWhen we look for the causes of sudden and progressive religious\r\nexaltation we often discover that it is nothing else than compensation\r\nfor disappointed love. I refer here to true and fervid exaltation,\r\nidentified with the whole inner consciousness, and not to the religion\r\nof habit which the average man scarcely remembers in his daily life,\r\nand only observes on Sunday in the form of a conventional promenade,\r\nor a contribution to the church. This religion of habit is only an\r\nempty form, which awakes no sentiment, and consequently is associated\r\nwith no sensation, even erotic, in its followers.\r\n\r\nIn other individuals it may be otherwise, and certainly was so\r\nformerly. Everything goes to prove that the exalted sentiments of\r\nsympathy from which our religion is to a great extent derived, such as\r\nthe holy fervor, the devotional ardor and the delights of ecstasy\r\nwhich it has so often procured for its followers and still procures\r\nfor some of them, whether their object be God, Allah, Jehovah, Jesus\r\nChrist, Buddha, Vishnu, the Virgin Mary, or the Saints, that these\r\nsentiments have to a great extent their roots in primary erotic\r\nsensations and sentiments, or represent the direct transformation of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that all this may take place quite unconsciously\r\nand with the purest intentions. I hasten to add that the majority of\r\ntrue religious sentiments come from quite a different source.\r\n\r\nWhen we study the religious sentiment profoundly, especially in the\r\nChristian religion, and Catholicism in particular, we find at each\r\nstep its astonishing connection with eroticism. We find it in the\r\nexalted adoration of holy women, such as Mary Magdalene, Marie de\r\nBethany, for Jesus, in the holy legends, in the worship of the Virgin\r\nMary in the Middle Ages, and especially in art. The ecstatic Madonnas\r\nin our art galleries cast their fervent regards on Jesus or on the\r\nheavens. The expression in Murillo's \"Immaculate Conception\" may be\r\ninterpreted by the highest voluptuous exaltation of love as well as by\r\nholy transfiguration. The \"Saints\" of Correggio regard the Holy Virgin\r\nwith an amorous ardor which may be celestial, but appears in reality\r\nextremely terrestrial and human.\r\n\r\nNumerous sects, both ancient and modern, have entered on the scene in\r\na hardly less libidinous manner; for example, the sexual excesses of\r\nthe anabaptists in former times and the sexual ecstasies of certain\r\nmodern sects in America.\r\n\r\nIf the objection is raised that these sects are the pathological\r\nexcrescences of religion, I reply with their disciples as follows: \"We\r\nhave come into the world because your State religions are sunk in\r\nindifference, hypocrisy and hollow formality, offering nothing to the\r\nhuman heart but empty phrases. It behooves us to awaken from this\r\nsleep. We want enthusiasm and fervor to transform the inner life of\r\nman and convert him.\" These words, which we can see and hear\r\neverywhere by opening our eyes and ears, constitute a formal avowal of\r\nthe suggestive factor in religion. (See Chapter IX.)\r\n\r\nIn the Canton of Zurich I have myself often had occasion to observe,\r\nespecially among women, the followers of the singular sect of the\r\nPastor Zeller, of Maennedorf. He is a kind of visionary prophet who\r\nheals people after the manner of Christ and John the Baptist, by\r\nplacing his hands on them and anointing them with oil. The cures which\r\nhe obtains are due naturally to suggestion, like those of Lourdes, but\r\nhe attributes them to divine miracles. He even told me naively that he\r\nheard a grinding (crepitation) in a broken bone, which he regarded as\r\na miraculous cure! A crowd of women, mostly hysterical, collected\r\naround this man with an ardor which was unconsciously directed much\r\nmore to his person than to that of God or Christ whom he was supposed\r\nto symbolize. I have treated patients who had been to him, and who\r\nassociated with his person both the mildest and the most carnal erotic\r\nimages--of course, in the innocence of their hearts.\r\n\r\nIt is far from me to reproach this sincere man and many others of the\r\nsame kind, especially the priests who are surrounded by a halo of\r\nsanctity pushed to ecstasy. I only maintain that when a human being\r\nexalts himself in the search for pure-mindedness and sanctity, thus\r\ndenying his true nature, he is always in danger of falling\r\nunconsciously into the most gross sensuality, and at the same time of\r\nsanctifying this sensuality.\r\n\r\n=Description of Religious Eroticism by the Poets.=--The Swiss poet,\r\nGottfried Keller, with his peculiar genius has described religious\r\neroticism in an admirable way, especially in his seven legends. Read,\r\nfor example, _Dorothea's Blumenkörbchen_ (Dorothea's little\r\nflower-basket), in which the terrestial lover of Dorothea ends by\r\nbecoming jealous of her celestial lover, of whom she always speaks in\r\nthe most exalted sentiments. Wherever she went she spoke in the most\r\ntender terms and expressed the most ardent desire for a celestial\r\nlover that she had found, who waited in immortal beauty to press her\r\nagainst his shining breast. When the wicked prefect had bound Dorothea\r\non the gridiron under which was placed a slow fire, this hurt her\r\ndelicate body, and she uttered smothered cries. Then her terrestrial\r\nlover, Theophilus, forcing his way through the crowd, burst her bonds\r\nand said with a sad smile, \"Does it hurt you, Dorothea?\" But when\r\nsuddenly freed from all pain she immediately replied: \"How could it\r\nhurt me, Theophilus? I lay on the roses of the lover I adore! This is\r\nmy wedding day!\" Keller shows us here, along with eroticism, the\r\nsuggestive effect of ecstasy, which among martyrs, may reach the most\r\ncomplete anæsthesia.\r\n\r\nGoethe has also described erotico-religious ecstasy; for example, at\r\nthe end of the second part of Faust, in the prayers addressed by\r\ncertain anchorites to the queen of heaven.\r\n\r\n=Distinction Between Religion and the Ecstasy Derived from\r\nEroticism.=--It would be quite false to maintain that religion in\r\nitself arises from sexual sensations. The terror of death and the\r\nenigmas of existence, the sentiments of human weakness and\r\ninsufficiency of life, the want of consolation for all miseries, the\r\nhope of a future life, all play an important part in the origin of\r\nreligions. On the other hand, it is necessary to recognize the\r\nconsiderable role of the erotic sexual factor in religious sentiments\r\nand dogmas, where on the one hand it leads to ardent fervor, while on\r\nthe other hand it tyrannizes, especially by the exclusiveness of its\r\nresidues transformed into dogmas, the natural expansion of the erotic\r\nsentiments which are so variable in individuals.\r\n\r\nOne of the most difficult and important future tasks of social science\r\ntoward humanity is, therefore, to set free sexual relations from the\r\ntyranny of religious dogmas, by placing them in harmony with the true\r\nand purely human laws of natural ethics.\r\n\r\n=Compensations.=--In the animal series we have seen that sentiments of\r\nsympathy are derived, in a general way, by phylogeny, from the\r\nsentiments of sexual attraction, and we often see in man a sexual\r\nlove, deceived, despised or transfigured, seek compensation or\r\nidealization in the fervor or religious exaltation. The question\r\nnaturally presents itself whether this compensation or this ideal is\r\nindispensable, and if other objects of a human and not mystical nature\r\ncannot take its place.\r\n\r\nThere are, in my opinion, purely human ideals, which are capable of\r\ntransfiguring erotic love \"religiously\" quite as well as the mysticism\r\nof so-called divine revelations. Christianity is called the religion\r\nof love, and the apostle Paul even places charity higher than faith.\r\nBut what is charity but the synthesis of the social sentiments of\r\nsympathy, devotion and self-denial, for the benefit of humanity?\r\nCannot it, therefore, be established on another basis than that of\r\ncheques to be drawn on paradise? Cannot exaltation and fervor apply\r\ntheir powerful faith, the beauty of their form and the elevation of\r\ntheir sentiments to the social ideal and the future welfare of our\r\nchildren? Cannot we replace the cult of religious legends, the\r\nadoration of the works of Jehovah and Christ, as they are given in the\r\nBible, by the religion of our descendants and their welfare?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the suggestion of religious ecstasy and love might well\r\nbe directed toward the benefit of society. Its fanaticism is admirably\r\nadapted to shake the indifference and indolence of men; but this\r\nsource of energy should not be wasted in the adoration of legendary\r\nmirages, but used for the efficacious culture of a true human religion\r\nof love on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nRIGHTS IN SEXUAL LIFE--GENERALITIES\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rights and Liberty.=--Human ideas of right are very curious. Every\r\none appeals to right and liberty, and naturally thinks of himself\r\nfirst, without perceiving that in continually claiming his proper\r\nrights, he tramples under foot those of others. How beautiful are\r\nthese words Rights and Liberty! But in everyday life in what an\r\nuncompromising way they oppose each other! To give satisfaction to my\r\nrights and liberty, the right of complete development, according to my\r\nnatural sentiments, is a thing which is perfectly impossible; or, is\r\nonly practicable by constantly infringing the right and liberty of my\r\nfellow beings.\r\n\r\nNevertheless people keep harping on this theme; with the exalted tone\r\nof intimate conviction they inveigh against our social organization,\r\ncursing the malice of others, but show themselves perfectly incapable\r\nof resolving the contradictions which gave rise to their thirst for\r\nliberty and justice.\r\n\r\nThe cry of despair addressed to right and liberty by modern society is\r\nnothing else than the expression of the instinctive sentiment of anger\r\nand revolt produced by the natural evolution of our phylogeny. The\r\nsavage instincts, still considerable in the hereditary foundation of\r\nhuman nature (the mneme), revolt against the straight-jacket placed on\r\nthem by social life, and against the want of liberty on the earth,\r\nwhich is already too small for humanity.\r\n\r\nThe natural man is eager for expansion and liberty, and accustoms\r\nhimself with difficulty to the severe restrictions which social\r\nnecessities impose upon him. His nature is still that of a\r\nsemi-nomadic animal, living as an autocrat with his family, possessed\r\nof a number of egoistic wants, and, wherever he goes, opposing the\r\nrights, liberties and desires of other men, who generally compel him\r\nto subordinate his desires to theirs. This is the true reason of this\r\nimpotent cry of vexation and anger against the malice of others and\r\nthe defectiveness of social organization. And yet this cry is\r\nabsolutely necessary, in order that we may find and put in practice a\r\nsocial formula as tolerable as possible for the future. But, if we\r\nexcept the question of capital and labor, there is no domain in which\r\nsocial hindrance is so cruelly felt as in the sexual.\r\n\r\nWhat is human right? Apart from formally admitted distinctions we\r\nshall divide what is called right from the psychological and human\r\npoint of view into two categories of ideas; _natural rights_ and\r\n_conventional rights_.\r\n\r\n=Natural Rights. Right of the Stronger.=--Natural right is quite a\r\nrelative idea: the right to life and its conditions. But, as in this\r\nworld, which is said to be created by a personal and perfect God,\r\nthings are so amicably arranged that living creatures can only exist\r\nby devouring one another, the oldest effective natural right of every\r\nliving being is precisely that of devouring others weaker than itself.\r\nThis is the right of the stronger. Therefore, the absolute natural\r\nright is the right of the stronger.\r\n\r\n=Rights of Groups. Ants.=--These notions become altered, however, if\r\nwe regard them from the point of view of _relative_ natural right.\r\nThis does not concern all living beings, but only certain groups. The\r\nrights of groups are relative from a double point of view. On the one\r\nhand they give the group of individuals concerned the right of\r\ninterfering with the right to life of other groups, even to\r\nextinction. On the other hand--and this is the better aspect of the\r\nrights of groups--they are completed by what are called the duties of\r\neach individual toward others of the same group, that is to say, the\r\nobligation to have regard for and even protect their rights equally as\r\nhis own. The rights of a group include the social rights and duties in\r\nthe limits of that group.\r\n\r\nIt is among animals, especially the ants, that we find the most ideal\r\norganization of the rights of a group. Each individual of the ant\r\ncolony acts in the interests of the community, which are the same as\r\nits own. It has the right to be nourished and housed and to satisfy\r\nall its immediate wants, but at the same time it is its duty to labor\r\nunceasingly in building and repairing the common dwelling, to nourish\r\nits fellows, to aid in the reproduction and bringing-up of the brood,\r\nto defend the community and even to take the offensive against every\r\nliving being who does not belong to the community, in order to\r\nincrease its resources.\r\n\r\nThe rights and duties have here become completely _instinctive by\r\nadaptation_, that is to say, they are performed without commands or\r\ninstruction. They result spontaneously from the natural organization\r\nof ants without the least external obligation intervening. Here, the\r\ncry of distress of the ferocious human beast, of whom we have just\r\nspoken, is completely absent, for duty is replaced by instinct or by\r\nappetite, and its accomplishment is accompanied by a natural sentiment\r\nof pleasure. Every ant could be idle without being punished by its\r\ncomrades, if it were capable of wishing to be so, but this is\r\nimpossible. Communities of ants can only exist on the basis of the\r\nsocial instinct of labor and mutual support, without which they would\r\nimmediately disappear.\r\n\r\n=Egoism and the Rights of Groups in Man. Human Rights.=--The notions\r\nof the rights of groups in man are infinitely more complicated and\r\nmore difficult to understand. As we have already seen, the most\r\nprimordial instinctive sentiment in man is limited to his family and\r\nhis immediate surroundings. But here even it leaves much to be\r\ndesired. Family disputes, quarrels between brothers and sisters are\r\nfrequent enough; parricide, fratricide and infanticide are not rare.\r\nIn addition to this, beyond the narrow circle of the family, disputes,\r\nhatred between individuals, deception, robbery and many worse things\r\nare always the order of the day. In struggles between parties and\r\nclasses, in the abuse of privileges of caste and fortune, in war, in\r\ncommerce, in a word in everything, private interests of egoism take\r\nprecedence of the general interests of humanity.\r\n\r\nThese facts, and a thousand other pitiable phenomena of the same kind\r\nin human society, bear witness to the egoistic and rapacious nature of\r\nman, which proves how little the social instinct is developed in his\r\nbrain. Human society is founded much more on custom and tradition,\r\nimposed by the force of circumstances, than on nature. Human infants\r\nresemble kittens at first much more than young social beings. In\r\nprimitive times, when the earth appeared large to man, the rights of\r\ngroups were limited to small communities which looked upon other men,\r\nthe same as animals and plants, as legitimate prey. Cannibalism and\r\neven the chase show clearly that man began by becoming more rapacious\r\nand more carnivorous than his pithecanthropoid ancestor, and his\r\ncousin the ape of the present day.\r\n\r\nIt is only later, after the progressive enlargement of stronger\r\ncommunities at the expense of weaker; still later, when man commenced\r\nto comprehend the sufferings for the community which result from the\r\nautocracy and passion for unlimited pleasure of a few persons;\r\nfinally, when he discovered the narrow limits of the earth, that\r\nnotions of humanity and humanitarianism, that is to say the sentiment\r\nof human solidarity, were able to develop in the general conscience.\r\nIt was, however, one of the ancients who said \"I am a man and nothing\r\nhuman can be strange to me.\" But in his time, as in that of Jesus\r\nChrist, civilization was already far advanced and influenced by the\r\nwide humanitarian ideas, more ancient still, of the Assyrians and the\r\nBuddhists.\r\n\r\nEvery one who reflects will understand that the relativity of the\r\nrights of groups in man and that of the duties which correspond to\r\nthem, must in time expand and be applied, little by little, to all the\r\nhuman inhabitants of the earth. What is more difficult is the\r\ndefinition of what should be understood under the term of humanity,\r\ncapable of being socialized and cultivated.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, the gap which exists between the lowest living human race\r\nand the highest ape is considerable and without direct transition.\r\nHowever, we gradually begin to recognize, on the one hand, that we\r\nhave certain duties toward animals, at least toward those which serve\r\nus, and, on the other hand, we know that certain of the lower human\r\nraces, such as the pigmies, the Veddas and even the Negroes, are\r\ninaccessible to a higher civilization, and especially incapable by\r\nthemselves of maintaining what a number of their individuals learn by\r\ntraining when they live among us. We shall, therefore, have to choose\r\nfinally between the gradual extinction of these races or that of our\r\nown.\r\n\r\nIt is not my business to deal with this question here, to trace the\r\nlimits of civilizable humanity, or to examine the rights and duties of\r\ncivilized men to each other relatively to the rest of the living\r\nworld; or, in other words, to what extent civilized man should have\r\nthe relative right of subjecting other living beings, exploiting them\r\nin his own interests, nourishing them, or eventually exterminating\r\nthem for the safety of his own existence.\r\n\r\nAs regards the animal and vegetable kingdoms, from the amoeba to the\r\norang-utan, the question is simple enough and settled. It is much more\r\ndifficult to decide for men and for peoples separated from us by great\r\nracial differences. I must emphasize the profoundness of this\r\ndifference. It is evident that the higher cultivated races, or rather\r\nblends of races, which live to-day will do better to live in peace\r\nthan to mutually exterminate each other.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to discuss these questions at the risk of hurting the\r\nfeelings of sentimental persons. But what is the use of being blind to\r\nsuch patent facts? It is not too soon to look closely into the future,\r\nand it is only thus that we can arrive at any useful result. The\r\nnatural rights of man should evolve more and more from a complex of\r\nsocial rights and duties toward a single great group, which we may\r\ncall _civilized humanity_, the relative limits of which can only be\r\ntraced by repeated trials and by practical experience. The instincts\r\nof the wild beast are still so deeply rooted, even in civilized men,\r\nthat they can only be adapted gradually and even painfully to a\r\nnatural right thus understood and limited. We must honestly admit that\r\nsuch a right only merits very relatively the denomination of _natural\r\nrights_. In fact, social rights are necessarily artificial in man. A\r\nfew elementary rights and duties only are quite natural, especially in\r\nthe sexual domain. We are concerned here with adaptations in the form\r\nof instincts which serve for the support and development of the\r\nfamily, as well as for the protection of the individual. Among these\r\nwe may mention the right to life, the duty of labor and the right to\r\nlabor, the right of the infant to be nourished by its mother and to be\r\ncared for and protected by its parents, the duty of parents to nourish\r\ntheir children, the duty of the husband to protect his wife, the right\r\nto obtain nourishment from the animal and vegetable kingdoms, the\r\nright to satisfy the sexual appetite, etc.\r\n\r\nThere exists, however, a series of other rights and duties, which are\r\nso necessary that they may be termed natural. Such are the right to\r\npossess a dwelling place; to defend one's life against attack; to\r\nthink and believe what one wishes so long as one does not impose one's\r\nideas and faith on others; the duty to respect the life and property\r\nof one's neighbor; the duty to give a healthy and sufficient education\r\nto youth, both in body and mind, etc.\r\n\r\nIf we regard the matter without prejudice, certain rights and duties\r\nwhich have been hitherto considered as natural and self-evident,\r\nbecome very doubtful. Such are ecclesiastical and religious rights and\r\nduties, patriotic and national duties, the rights and duties of war,\r\nthe rights of privileged classes, the rights of property, etc. It is\r\nclear, from an unprejudiced examination of the development of\r\nhumanity, that these so-called rights and duties are only the historic\r\nlegacies of mysticism or of limited human groupings, and in great part\r\nartificial. The rights and duties of members of the groups in question\r\nconsisted in mutually protecting their opinions and their national and\r\nreligious interests, etc., and in subjecting or even trampling under\r\nfoot those of other human groups. These lead us quite naturally to the\r\nsecond category of general notions of rights.\r\n\r\n=Conventional Rights.=--To speak correctly, conventional rights are\r\nnot rights. They are simply a dogmatic sanction applied to all kinds\r\nof customs and abuses that men have appropriated, according to local\r\ncircumstances and their fortuitous conquests or acquisitions. Here,\r\nthe consequences of the natural rights of the stronger, religious\r\nmysticisms and all sorts of human passions, the sexual appetite\r\nespecially, play a very varied and complex role.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity and injustice of conventional rights is shown by the\r\ndifference, often even the absolute contrast, of the corresponding\r\nconception of rights among different peoples. In one, polygamy is a\r\nright and even a divine institution; in another, it is a crime.\r\nIndividual murder is generally considered as criminal, but in warfare\r\nthe slaughter of masses becomes a duty and even a virtue. Theft and\r\nrapine are regarded in times of peace as crimes, but in time of war,\r\nunder the form of annexation and plunder they are the uncontested\r\nrights of the victor. In a kingdom, the monarch is looked upon as a\r\nholy person and offense to his majesty as a crime; in a democracy, it\r\nis individual domination which is regarded as criminal.\r\n\r\nFalsehood and mental restriction are, in certain cases at least, the\r\nrights or even the duty of the Catholic, who is only forbidden to\r\nswear falsely in the name of God and religion, while others consider\r\nall falsehood more or less unjustifiable; others again regard every\r\noath as sinful.\r\n\r\nThe contradictions, inconsistencies, unnatural prescripts and\r\ntyrannies of what is called conventional rights in different peoples\r\nare innumerable, and the notions of our rights which we have inherited\r\nfrom the Romans are not much better.\r\n\r\n=Retaliation.=--In historical epochs, we see the rights of the\r\nstronger succeeded by certain notions of rights which may still be\r\nconsidered as primordial; such is the law of retaliation or lynch law,\r\nbased on the natural sentiment of vengeance, which is itself derived\r\nfrom anger, jealousy and pride, and says \"An eye for an eye and a\r\ntooth for a tooth.\" The law of retaliation is very natural and very\r\nhuman. Although of savage origin, it has at least the merit of\r\nrecognizing in men an equal right in retaliation for injury caused in\r\na brutal fashion, without considering inner motives.\r\n\r\n=Expiation.=--We also find in the old law another notion derived\r\npartly from the preceding, but chiefly from religious mysticism--the\r\nnotion of expiation. After constructing in his own image a divinity\r\nblinded by human passions, man attributed to him, from fear of\r\nvengeance, sentiments of anger and indignation regarding his baseness\r\nand malice toward his neighbor. He then conciliated the divinity and\r\nappeased his wrath by making sacrifices, human or otherwise.\r\n\r\nAt first, sacrifices were not made of criminals or guilty persons, but\r\nof innocent lambs, men or beasts, sometimes with all kinds of torture,\r\nto appease the supposed wrath of the gods. Gradually, however, these\r\ncustoms became more humane and were changed to the notions of\r\nexpiation which we still have. Whosoever has committed a crime should\r\nexpiate it by some kind of pain, eventually by death. In our modern\r\npenal law, notions of expiation and retaliation are blended, and when\r\nwe study its roots in ethnology we are not surprised to see the\r\nexpiation and punishment of so-called crimes against God or religion.\r\nWe find in this fact a singular mixture of religious and judicial\r\nnotions. A curious way of appeasing the divinity is the sacrifice of\r\nanimals and other offerings which ancient and savage peoples made and\r\nstill make, in returning thanks for victory or some other good\r\nfortune, or to appease supposed wrath.\r\n\r\n=Themis.=--In spite of all these errors, ancient civilization\r\nrepresented as the ideal of right a goddess of justice, _Themis_, with\r\neyes blindfolded and holding scales in her hands. The scales signified\r\nthat right and wrong should be carefully weighed against each other;\r\nthe bandage, that the judge should pronounce his verdict without\r\nregard to persons, and be inaccessible to all outside influence. For\r\nthe limited ideas of that period, little removed from retaliation and\r\nexpiation, this blind woman with her scales was a sufficient\r\nrepresentation of justice. She had no need to trouble about the\r\npsychology of human nature, mental disorders, diminished\r\nresponsibility or ideal social improvement.\r\n\r\n=Themis Unblindfolded. Fallacy of Free-will.=--Nowadays the task of\r\nour goddess is not so simple, for the progress of humanity and\r\nscience, especially of psychology and psychiatry, oblige her whether\r\nshe wishes or not, to completely remove her bandage, so as to see\r\nclearly into the human brain.\r\n\r\nIt is not simply a question of knowing whether an accused person has\r\nor has not committed the act which he is accused of, but also whether\r\nhe knew what he was doing, what were the motives which urged him, and\r\nwho is the real instigator of the misdeed. Alcohol, mental anomalies\r\nand diseases, suggestions, passions, etc., concur in influencing the\r\nhuman brain so that it is hardly responsible for its acts.\r\n\r\nAgain, on further examination, we find that the accepted and\r\nhistorical notion of free-will, that is to say the absolute liberty of\r\nman's will, which constitutes the very existence of our old penal law,\r\nbecomes not only more problematical, but may even be considered as a\r\npurely human illusion, resting on the fact that the indirect and\r\nremote motives of our actions are mainly subconscious.\r\n\r\nThe great philosopher, Spinoza, has already demonstrated this truth in\r\na masterly manner, and modern science confirms it in all respects.\r\nEvery effect has its cause, and all our resolutions are the result of\r\nthe activities of our brain, in their turn determined or influenced by\r\nhereditary engrams (instincts and dispositions) or acquired\r\n(memories), which are their internal causes, and combine with causes\r\nacting from without. Let us admit freely the fallacy of the old axiom\r\nof human free-will and endeavor to understand that what we consider as\r\nfree will is nothing else than the very variable faculty of our brain,\r\nmore or less developed in different individuals, of adapting its\r\nactivity to that of its environment, and especially to that of other\r\nmen. Also let us endeavor to take into account that our will and all\r\nour actions are, consciously or unconsciously, determined by a complex\r\nof energies or hereditary engrams (character), combined with those\r\nwhich have acted upon us from without during our life, as well as with\r\nemotional or intellectual sensory impressions.\r\n\r\nOur whole conception of rights, and especially of penal law, should\r\nthen change. We should entirely do away with _retaliation_, a\r\nbarbarous relic of a more or less animal sentiment of our ancestors,\r\nand _expiation_, the relic of a superannuated and superstitious\r\nmysticism. Modern and truly scientific reformers of penal law have\r\nalready taken account of this necessity. But, in spite of the complete\r\ninefficacy of the old penal system as regards the diminution of crime,\r\nthey have so far only put into practice few of their ideas.\r\n\r\n=Justification of Rights and Laws.=--After what we have just said,\r\nthere only remain, two reasons to justify the existence of rights and\r\nlaws:\r\n\r\n(1). To protect human society against criminals, and in general to\r\ninstitute ideas and laws with a view to regulate the mutual interests\r\nof men, in such a way as to result in natural conditions of existence\r\nas advantageous as possible, both for the individual and for society:\r\n\r\n(2). To study the causes of crimes, social conflicts, imperfections\r\nand inequalities, so as to obtain, by contending against these causes,\r\nan improvement in men and their social condition. It is true that what\r\nwe demand here means a complete transformation of the notions of\r\nconventional right, not only in our old penal law, but also to a great\r\nextent in civil law; but this transformation is inevitable and has\r\neven already commenced. Its object is to liberate right from the grasp\r\nof an old metaphysico-religious dogmatism, and from crystalized\r\ndoctrines derived from superannuated custom and abuse, and to found\r\nitself on the applied and social natural history of man, who then only\r\nwill merit the name of _homo sapiens_ which was given to him by\r\nLinnaeus, the great nomenclator of living beings.\r\n\r\nJurists have already too long based metaphysics on old barbarous\r\ncustoms and superstitious mysticism, transformed into dogmas. It is\r\ntime that Themis removed her bandage, studied psychology,\r\npsychopathology and science, and submitted the impartial handling of\r\nher scales to the influence of truer and juster human factors, even if\r\nher work thereby becomes more difficult and more complicated.\r\n\r\n=Sexual Rights.=--While sexual sentiments form part of the most sacred\r\nand intimate conditions of individual happiness, they are also closely\r\nand indissolubly connected with the social welfare of humanity. In no\r\ndomain is it more difficult to combine harmoniously the welfare of the\r\ncommunity with that of the individual, and this is why questions of\r\nright in sexual matters are among the most difficult to solve.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of the sexual appetite in man is part of his natural\r\nrights. Natural science compels us to formulate this principle; yet it\r\nis a dogma the consequences of which may become very grave and even\r\nfatal; for the satisfaction of a man's sexual appetite implies, not\r\nonly the direct participation of one or more human beings in a common\r\nact, but also that of a much greater number in its indirect effects;\r\nand it may occasion, according to circumstances, more harm than good.\r\n\r\nIf the question of reproduction did not exist, it would be more easy\r\nto put individualism in more or less harmonious accord with\r\nsocialism. It is thus the sexual relations which present the greatest\r\ndifficulties in the social domain.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the considerable progress which has been accomplished, our\r\nmodern law is still based to a great extent on the barbarous principle\r\nof the legal inequality of the sexes. The mind of man and that of\r\nwoman are no doubt of different quality; nevertheless, in a society\r\nwhich does not possess asexual individuals like that of the ants and\r\nbees, and in which the two sexes are compelled to work together\r\nharmoniously for the social welfare, there is no reason to subordinate\r\none sex to the other. Man may have 130 or 150 grammes more brain\r\ntissue than woman and be superior to her in his faculty of combination\r\nand invention, but this is no reason why we should only accord his\r\nwife and mother inferior social rights to his own. His bodily strength\r\nwill always protect him against the possible encroachments of woman.\r\n\r\nA first postulate is, therefore, the equality of the two sexes before\r\nthe law. A second postulate consists in the emancipation of infancy,\r\nin the sense that it should never be considered as an object of\r\npossession or of exploitation, as was and is still so often the case.\r\n\r\nThese are the fundamental principles of a normal sexual law. In no\r\nanimal do we find the abuses which man is permitted to practice toward\r\nhis wife and children. Let us now pass on to special questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIL LAW\r\n\r\nThe object of civil law is to regulate the relations of men to each\r\nether. Properly speaking it does not punish, that is to say, it\r\nrequires no expiation and is not concerned with crime. It seeks to\r\nimprove the social basis for mutual obligations and contracts.\r\nNevertheless, it borders on penal law as regards the question of\r\ndamages which one individual must pay another whom he has injured even\r\ninvoluntarily, as well as by the coercive measures, both\r\nadministrative and operative, which it employs.\r\n\r\nAlthough resting on a natural basis better adapted to the social\r\nwelfare than penal law, civil law still contains the traditions of\r\nreligious mysticism and the abuse of conventional right.\r\n\r\nI shall here analyze in a few words what concerns our subject in\r\nactual civil law, and shall point out the modifications which appear\r\nto me desirable. It is, however, impossible for me to enter into the\r\ndetails of codes, owing to absence of special knowledge. Moreover,\r\nthis would lead us too far from our subject.\r\n\r\n=Marriage and Sexual Relations in General.=--The coitus of two\r\nindividuals, performed with mutual deliberation and causing no harm to\r\na third person, should be considered as a private affair, and should\r\nhave no connection with either civil or penal law.\r\n\r\nHowever great may be the necessary restrictions of this general axiom,\r\nit must be recognized as valid in principle. Society has no right to\r\nrestrict the liberty of individuals so long as it, or one of its\r\nmembers, is not injured by these individuals. So long as coitus is\r\nfreely performed by adult and responsible persons, has no indirect\r\nconsequences, and does not cause fecundation, neither society nor any\r\none is injured.\r\n\r\nIn the practice of law this axiom is not yet generally accepted. Many\r\nlaws, especially among the Germanic peoples, punish concubinage, or\r\nextra-nuptial coitus. Even when concubinage is tolerated, it is\r\nconsidered illegitimate, so that the woman who gives herself to it and\r\nthe children who result from it, have much to suffer. Although they\r\nconstitute simple religious precepts, the ordinances of Liguori and\r\nothers concerning coitus influence in a high degree sexual relations\r\nin Catholic countries.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, coitus is only legally recognized as licit in marriage. But\r\nwe have seen in Chapter VI how elastic is the term marriage, which\r\nvaries from polygamy and monogamy to polyandry, and from marriage for\r\nshort periods to indissoluble marriage, to say nothing of the cases\r\nwhere women are sacrificed on their husbands' tombs. We have seen that\r\nreligious traditions, arising themselves from barbarous customs, play\r\na great part in conjugal law. It is only by infinite trouble that the\r\nprinciple of civil marriage has made its way in modern civilized\r\nstates. Even to-day, religious marriage is in some countries only form\r\nof union which is legally recognized. These simple facts show to what\r\nextent we are still hidebound by tradition.\r\n\r\nThe idea that marriage is a divine institution and that man has the\r\nright to contract, but not to dissolve it, is still a widespread\r\nbelief, however bizarre it may be. We shall not enter here into the\r\ndetail of the religious forms of marriage, which is referred to in\r\nChapters VI and XII.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from our modern and scientific point of view, which is\r\npurely human and social, that civil law only can be recognized as\r\nvalid. Religious forms and ceremonies must be considered as belonging\r\nto a private domain. For this reason they concern neither the State\r\nnor society, and should be refused all legal character; for it is our\r\nduty to strive and liberate humanity from the tyranny of all imposed\r\ncreeds, as we should combat all so-called State religion.\r\n\r\n=Civil Marriage.=--What then is civil marriage, and what ought it to\r\nbe? Our actual civil marriage is the result of trials and compromises\r\nwhich require improvement. It is a contract between two persons of\r\nopposite sex whose mutual object is the reproduction of the human\r\nspecies. In this contract the law is unfortunately too much concerned\r\nwith the personal relations of the two contracting parties, and too\r\nlittle with the interests of their eventual posterity, which\r\nnecessitates care and attention on the part of the social legislator.\r\nMoreover, the traditional conception of the dependence of woman\r\ndisturbs the purity and justice of civil marriage.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the first fundamental principles of civil marriage\r\nshould be absolute legal equality of the two conjoints and complete\r\nseparation of property. The momentary amorous intoxication of a woman\r\nshould not allow a man to appropriate her property in whole or in\r\npart; only truly barbarous laws could permit such iniquity, and they\r\nshould be banished from all the codes of civilized countries.\r\nMoreover, in countries where woman enjoys important rights, the\r\ncommunity of property furnishes those who are unscrupulous with the\r\nmeans of completely despoiling their husbands.\r\n\r\nFurther, in common conjugal life, the domestic work of the wife should\r\nnot be considered as obligatory and requiring no special\r\nremuneration. Her work has as much right to be considered as that of\r\nthe husband, and should be entered to the wife as an asset.\r\n\r\nCommunity of property is so immoral that it should be considered\r\ninvalid in case of ulterior dispute, when it has been instituted by\r\nprivate contract. It is the business of the conjoints to put it in\r\npractice if they wish, so long as they are of one mind. But when\r\ndissensions or divorce take place, it only injures the one who has\r\nremained honest, and at the same time the children.\r\n\r\nThis is why such contracts ought never be definitely binding to the\r\nconjoints. Even if the marriage is not unhappy, the extravagances or\r\nblunders of one of the conjoints may ruin the whole family, in the\r\ncase of common property.\r\n\r\nThe _duration_ of marriage is very important. If a marriage contract\r\nexacts sexual fidelity till death, divorce is nonsense. Yet, in\r\npractice, it is obvious cruelty to keep two individuals legally bound\r\ntogether who can no longer live with each other. Thus, the provision\r\nand license of divorce are necessities of civil law which are\r\ncertainly not ideal, but which cannot be passed over without favoring\r\nfamily disturbance and without sanctioning illegality and evil.\r\n\r\nAmong the most frequent causes of divorce are desire for change in the\r\nhusband, venereal diseases, disputes, incompatibility of temper,\r\nmental disorders, immorality, ill-treatment and crime. The sterility\r\nof one of the conjoints and incapacity for coitus may also be\r\nmentioned as reasons for divorce, although in certain circumstances,\r\nas we shall see, limited polyandry or polygyny may be much more humane\r\nthan divorce.\r\n\r\nAs soon as divorce is admitted, important and complicated questions of\r\nlaw arise when there are children. We shall refer to these later. The\r\nlegal license of complete divorce thus transforms marriage into a\r\ntemporary contract, which is not so far removed as one would think\r\nfrom the ideal relations of free love.\r\n\r\nWe will examine the circumstances which, apart from the procreation of\r\nchildren, may attribute legal importance to the sexual relations of\r\ntwo persons. I must first of all observe that, if it wishes, civil\r\nlegislation can very well create a state of things which gives to\r\nchildren born outside marriage the same rights and the same social\r\nposition as legitimate children, and I will even add that such social\r\nequality would respond to the most elementary sentiments of human\r\nrights, if these were not already influenced in advance by prejudice\r\nand mysticism.\r\n\r\n=Minors.=--Civil law should stipulate that minors have not the right\r\nto marry. This may appear cruel in certain cases, but society has the\r\nright and the duty to intervene. Minors should be protected against\r\nall sexual abuse. A young girl under the age of seventeen and a boy\r\nunder eighteen or twenty should be prevented from all sexual\r\nrelations. This is a postulate of individual and social hygiene and\r\nconsequently of all healthy matrimonial law.\r\n\r\n=Lunatics.=--The same applies to lunatics, who are legally comparable\r\nto minors. Have we the right to forcibly separate a married couple, or\r\na couple living in concubinage, because one of the conjoints has\r\nbecome insane, when the other does not wish for separation? In Germany\r\nthe procedure of nullity of marriage has been invented for these\r\ncases, but without gaining much. I shall return to this point in\r\nconnection with another subject, but I may remark here that it is not\r\nthe continuation of marriage nor that of sexual connection which\r\ninjures society, but only the procreation of children. Therefore it is\r\nonly the procreation of children, which should be legally prohibited,\r\nand sexual connection only when the healthy conjoint agrees to its\r\nsuppression, or when the interests of the afflicted one necessitate\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the future these particular cases may be regulated in the most\r\nconvenient and humane way possible.\r\n\r\nCertain bodily infirmities which one of the conjoints has concealed\r\nfrom the other, or of which he was not himself aware, should also\r\nimpair the validity of the marriage contract. Such are chronic\r\ninfectious diseases, especially venereal, impotence in the man and\r\nsterility in the woman, when the cause was previously known. But here\r\nagain, the law should only intervene at the request of the person\r\ninjured, and to take certain measures to prevent the procreation of\r\nabortions, without interfering with sexual connection.\r\n\r\n=Adultery.=--An important question is that of adultery. Here again, we\r\nare of opinion that the law has not performed its duty. Proved\r\nadultery, when fidelity has been promised by contract should give the\r\ninjured party the right of immediate and absolute divorce.\r\n\r\nCertain forms of adultery, which take place with the assent of the two\r\nconjoints, have in reality the character of bigamy and should neither\r\nbe recognized by civil nor penal law. I will cite as an example, the\r\ncase where two conjoints wish to live together for various reasons,\r\nwhile the impotence, disease or sterility of one of them induces him\r\nto concede to the other liberty of sexual connection with a third\r\nperson, apart from marriage. In such a case neither society nor any\r\none else is injured and all motive for legal intervention is wanting\r\n(vide André Couvreur: _La Graine_).\r\n\r\n=Divorce.=--The question of divorce becomes extremely difficult when\r\none of the conjoints wishes for it and the other does not, and when no\r\nother reason exists for determining the marriage. We are here\r\nconcerned with the malicious caprices of the god of love, from which\r\nthe world will never be free.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the law in such cases can only do one thing, and that\r\nis to protect the rights of the children, if there are any, and to\r\ncompel the inconstant conjoint to provide for their nourishment.\r\n\r\nThe law should also protect the pecuniary and other civil rights of\r\nthe conjoint who wishes to continue life in common. Here especially we\r\ncan recognize the necessity for the separation of property. On the\r\nother hand, I am convinced that it is useless to maintain at any price\r\na union which one party does not wish for. In practice no good results\r\nfrom it; it is rather a moral question than a question of law.\r\n\r\nIn such cases we may observe the despair of the conjoint who has\r\nremained faithful, both in the marital and legal relations of\r\nmarriage. The law cannot do everything, and here it is powerless; all\r\nthat it can do is to exact delay and attempt at reconciliation, which\r\nsometimes succeeds.\r\n\r\n=The Right to Satisfaction of the Sexual Appetite.=--We now come to a\r\ndelicate question. The right to satisfy the sexual appetite must\r\nnecessarily be restricted in more than one respect if injury to third\r\nparties is to be avoided. If we except certain pathological cases, the\r\nchief difficulty lies in the fact that the normal sexual appetite can\r\nonly be satisfied by the cohabitation of two persons, and that what\r\nsatisfies the one may often injure or deeply wound the other, and even\r\nthe children. The matter may go so far as to concern penal law, and we\r\nshall refer to it again in this connection. But, even from the point\r\nof view of civil law, permission to satisfy the sexual appetite must\r\nnecessarily depend on the consent of both parties. In my opinion no\r\nexception to this rule can be tolerated.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to protect minors; it is also necessary to prevent\r\nthe abuse of the persons of adults against their will. The institution\r\nof so-called Christian marriage still contains barbarous dispositions\r\nin this respect, the wife being generally obliged to surrender herself\r\nto her lord and master as often as he pleases. This is the dark side\r\nof the picture which exacts sexual fidelity in man.\r\n\r\nInversely, for physiological reasons, a very erotic and sexually\r\nexacting woman cannot obtain satisfaction, man being incapable of\r\ncommanding erections voluntarily. She can only bring an action for\r\ndivorce if she can prove that her husband is completely impotent.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient to reflect on these facts to see how difficult is the\r\nregulation of sexual connection by law. The legislation of details in\r\nthis domain becomes of necessity an injustice.\r\n\r\nWe have already considered the great individual variability of the\r\nsexual appetite. Attempts to regulate it by the rules of a monogamous\r\nmatrimonial code are absurd and impracticable. With all the respect\r\ndue to the moral sentiments of Tolstoi, we are obliged to declare that\r\nhis ascetic opinions on sexual relations are only the dreams of an\r\nenthusiast.\r\n\r\nWhen a libidinous man marries a young girl who is sexually frigid, and\r\nwhen coitus continues to be a horror to his wife, it is quite as cruel\r\nto demand continence in the husband as submission in his wife. In such\r\ncases, the conditions can only be made tolerable by divorce, consent\r\nto concubinage, or bigamy, when a relative adaptation cannot be\r\nobtained by mutual concessions. At present our prejudices only allow\r\ndivorce in such cases.\r\n\r\nWhen a man and woman are already tied by pregnancy or by a child, and\r\nwhen, apart from the differences in their sexual appetites, love and\r\nconcord reign between them, separation would be cruel.\r\n\r\nI readily agree that such extreme circumstances should not be the\r\nrule, and that in many cases the one who is the more erotic can\r\nrestrain himself, and the one who is cold become accustomed to coitus.\r\nNevertheless, in the present chapter we are not concerned with morals\r\nbut with rights, and we have only to reply to the question of knowing\r\nwhat should be done when, in sexual connection between two conjoints,\r\none desires it and the other does not.\r\n\r\nThe concentration of sexual passion on a single individual, which is\r\ngenerally good from the social point of view, is fatal in these\r\nspecial cases. A man falls passionately in love with a woman, or a\r\nwoman with a man, but instead of being reciprocal this love is\r\ndespised by the other. Such a misfortune, which often leads to the\r\nmost tragic consequences, not only in novels but also in real life, is\r\nonly reparable by the renunciation of the one who loves. It is surely\r\nless cruel to renounce a proposed union than to become the sexual prey\r\nof a person one does not love. It is, therefore, inhuman and immoral,\r\nas much in religion as in poetry, to preach in any form, the\r\nexclusiveness of sentiments, the indissolubility of monogamous\r\nmarriage, and the immutability of love.\r\n\r\nIt has often been stated that a woman can only love once in her life.\r\nSuch a false and cruel generalization must be energetically opposed.\r\nIt is the business of sentimental poets to delude themselves with such\r\nsentiments, but those who think it a duty to adhere to dogmas of this\r\nkind are to be pitied. It is not only death or illness of one of the\r\nconjoints, dissensions and infidelity, which may cause separation of a\r\nsexual union, but as is frequently the case, rejected love may\r\ntransform into perpetual martyrdom the life of a person imbued with\r\nsuch ideas. The ascetic sentimentalism which results from this has a\r\nstrong element of suggestion which is bad to cultivate.\r\n\r\nIf we would give the one who does not love the absolute right of\r\nrepelling the sexual advances of the other, not only the law but\r\nmorality should in return allow the rejected lover to make another\r\nchoice, where his desire for love will find an echo.\r\n\r\nAt the present day many people, especially women, prefer to endure\r\ntheir unhappiness and even that of their children to the opprobrium to\r\nwhich they are often exposed by public opinion in divorce or\r\nremarriage, or even in becoming engaged to another person, when their\r\nlove has been rejected. It is, therefore, the duty of the legislator\r\nto banish from the law everything which may appear to sanction such\r\nopprobrium.\r\n\r\nMost laws recognize not only impotence, but also assault, cruelty,\r\nvenereal disease, adultery, etc., as grounds for divorce, but the\r\npressure of public opinion causes the existing laws to be too little\r\nused. We must remember that such violations of conjugal duties give\r\nthe injured party the right of claiming damages.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we may say that the simplest civil action by one\r\nconjoint against the other is veritably monstrous when it is not\r\naccompanied by an action for divorce. When once the couple have come\r\nto legal disputes, their marriage is in reality dissolved and its\r\ncontinuation is an absurdity.\r\n\r\n=Venereal Diseases.=--A very important question from the humanitarian\r\nand hygienic point of view is that of venereal disease. A man (or\r\nwoman) who knows himself (or herself) to be affected with a venereal\r\ndisease in an infectious state, and who in spite of this has\r\nconnection with a woman, should be regarded as a criminal, at least if\r\nthe woman with whom he has connection is not affected with the same\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nHere the law should intervene by awarding heavy damages to the party\r\nwho has been infected; eventually it may be treated as a criminal\r\noffense. In such cases claim should be made by the injured party, but\r\nunfortunately this is seldom done owing to feelings of shame. In the\r\nfuture, however, we may hope that the law may be improved for the\r\nbenefit of humanity, for this would be one of the most efficacious\r\nmeans of combating venereal disease, and hence avoiding much\r\nmisfortune for families and children.\r\n\r\nIt would also be desirable to prevent the procreation of syphilitic\r\ninfants, for instance, by the use of preventatives (vide Chapter XIV).\r\n\r\n=Prostitution.=--Another difficult question is that of the relation of\r\ncivil law to prostitution. All State regulation of prostitution is to\r\nbe absolutely condemned; but what position should civil law take up\r\nwith regard to free prostitution? We have already seen what an\r\nabominable social evil is this commerce in human bodies, as regards\r\nsocial morality. But it is absolutely useless to try and abolish this\r\ncommerce without attacking its lord and master--_money_. The venality\r\nof man implies the commerce of his body, and as long as everything can\r\nbe got for money, coitus can be bought. It is, therefore, this\r\nvenality which must be attacked, not only by condemning it in words\r\nbut by cutting its roots. If the State will not withdraw its\r\nprotecting hand from prostitution, it might at least combat\r\nproxenetism and the public manifestations of prostitution, by all the\r\nlegal and administrative measures at its disposal. It would thus\r\nreduce the matter to intimate personal relations.\r\n\r\nLet us hope that, little by little, a social organization more just to\r\nlabor and wages, combined with the prohibition of alcoholic drinks,\r\nwill, in the future, annihilate the causes of commerce in human\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n=Children as a Reason for Civil Marriage.=--To resume; we find that\r\ncivil marriage should, by progressive reforms, become a much more free\r\ncontract than it is at present, having for its object a common sexual\r\nlife. The law should abandon its useless and often harmful chicanery\r\nconcerning the questions of sexual relations and love, and regulate\r\nmore carefully the duties of parents toward their children, and thus\r\nprotect future generations against the abuse of the present\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nThe difference which exists between marriage and free love should\r\ngradually disappear, by instituting natural intimate relations on the\r\nbasis of sentiments of social morality, instead of maintaining the\r\npretended divine origin of a social institution. It is difficult to\r\navoid a smile when we hear the term \"divine institution\" applied to\r\nthe marriage of a rich girl with a man who has been bought for her.\r\n(Vide Chapter X.)\r\n\r\nVarious propositions have been made to give more dignity to the unions\r\nof free love, which now exist and which always have existed. Modern\r\nwomen have remarked that the absurd custom of naming the celibate\r\nwoman differently to the married stigmatizes in society a number of\r\npoor women and innocent children, and that it would be quite as just\r\nto apply the term \"damoiseau\" to celibate men as \"mademoiselle\" to\r\nnon-married girls. An unmarried woman who has a child, and who has\r\nonly committed the sin of obeying nature, is branded with the stamp of\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nIt is the children who constitute the true bond of marriage and give\r\nit a legal character. When there are no children all legal and State\r\ninterference with conjugal affairs loses its sense so long as no one\r\nis injured, and civil marriage can then be greatly simplified. I\r\nmaintain that so long as a sterile union, of whatever kind, between\r\nresponsible persons is voluntary, provokes no conflict between those\r\nwho have contracted it, and causes no injury to a third party, the law\r\nhas no right to meddle with it; because this union does not concern\r\nsociety nor any of its members, excepting the two parties interested,\r\nwho are in accord.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, in many countries, the existing laws can be\r\nutilized to form marriage contracts stipulating separation of\r\nproperty, the right of each of the conjoints to the produce of his or\r\nher work, as well as certain reciprocal rights and duties between the\r\nparents and children. Matters can thus be arranged so as to correct\r\nmore or less the defects of the law.\r\n\r\n=Marriage of Inverts.=--A peculiar and characteristic phenomenon is\r\nthe ardent desire of many sexual perverts, especially inverts, to\r\nbecome secretly engaged or married to the abnormal homosexual object\r\nof their love. It is needless to say that there can be no question of\r\nlegal regulation of such pathological marriages. But the law may\r\nignore them when they do no harm to any one, and regard them as\r\nprivate affairs, especially when they prevent much worse evils, such\r\nas the marriage of an invert to a normal individual.\r\n\r\n=Civil Rights of Children. Matriarchism.=--As we have already said, it\r\nis the children who constitute the real phylogenetic and\r\npsychological bonds in marriage and the family, bonds which are deeply\r\nrooted in human nature. This is so true that among many savage\r\npeoples, if not in most, marriage is not considered legal as long as\r\nit is sterile. Even among civilized people sterile women are generally\r\nregarded as of less value. We may, therefore, regard the article in\r\nthe Code Napoleon which forbids inquiry into paternity as an unnatural\r\nmeasure, or as a monstrosity of civil law.\r\n\r\nTwo human beings who procreate others contract common duties and\r\nresponsibility of the highest importance. They are, perhaps, the\r\nhighest social duties that man can assume. Is it not then infamous and\r\nunnatural to legally liberate one only of the procreators, the man,\r\nfrom all his responsibilities, simply because certain religious or\r\ncivil formalities were omitted before procreation?\r\n\r\nIs the man less guilty than the woman in procreation apart from\r\nmarriage, if we can use the term guilt in such cases? Is it not a\r\nridiculous and cruel irony to call _natural children_ those born apart\r\nfrom marriage? Perhaps legitimate children are supernatural, or\r\nunnatural! Is it not infamous to brand with the seal of shame, even\r\nbefore their birth, poor illegitimate children, and to confirm this\r\nindignity by making them bear their mother's name instead of their\r\nfather's?\r\n\r\nThe most elementary natural law exacts that all children, whether\r\n\"legitimate\" or \"illegitimate,\" should have the same social rights,\r\nand that they should bear either the name of their real father or that\r\nof their mother; the latter denomination would be the more natural and\r\nlogical. Denomination by the maternal line corresponds to the system\r\nof matriarchism (Chapters VI and XIX), which is often met with among\r\nsavage races, and which is more just and leads to less abuse than\r\npatriarchism. Moreover, when women shall have obtained their proper\r\nrights, there will be an end of the exclusive authority of one of the\r\nconjoints in marriage.\r\n\r\nEquality in the rights of the two sexes will naturally lead to\r\ndenomination in the maternal line, for reasons of simplicity, the\r\nmother being more closely related to the child than the father.\r\nMaternity may, no doubt, be sometimes uncertain, as in the case of\r\nfoundlings or changelings, but on the whole it is infinitely more easy\r\nto establish than paternity. It is sufficient for the mother to have\r\nsexual connection with two men at the time of conception to render\r\npaternity doubtful. Again, the mother has a number of pains, cares and\r\ndangers to undergo in the course of the procreation and education of\r\nchildren, which the father escapes. Nature thus gives the mother the\r\nright to give her name to the family. Our legislation is unfortunately\r\nfar from recognizing such natural right. We may nevertheless form a\r\nprimary proposition, because in my opinion its recognition would avoid\r\nmuch complicated litigation:\r\n\r\n_In nature, whenever the offspring of an animal have a protracted and\r\ndependent infancy, it is the duty of the parents to nourish them and\r\nbring them up. To allow human parents to dispense with this duty, on\r\nthe grounds of badly constructed and unnatural social theories, is to\r\nencourage promiscuity, and consequently degeneration of society. It is\r\neasy to change social customs which are only based on artificial\r\ndogmas sanctioned by tradition, fashion and habit, whether they are of\r\na religious nature or otherwise. But a social organization can never\r\nviolate with impunity the true laws of human nature which are deeply\r\nrooted in our phylogenetic instincts, without disastrous effects._\r\n\r\nIn Chapters VI and VII we have given irrefutable proof that family\r\nlife and the sentiments of sympathy between husband and wife, parents\r\nand children, constitute the phylogenetic basis of the sexual\r\nrelations of humanity. Whatever may be the egoistic polygamous\r\ninstincts of man, we can affirm that a natural and true monogamy\r\nconstitutes the highest and best form of his sexual relations and of\r\nhis love. No doubt there are many exceptions which must be taken into\r\naccount. It is absurd to shut our eyes to the fact that our degenerate\r\nsocial customs have created unnatural circumstances in which parents\r\nbehave shamefully toward their children, exploiting them, training\r\nthem systematically to mendacity, prostitution and crime, or else\r\nill-treating them. We even see unnatural parents, to save legal\r\nconsequences, get rid of children who inconvenience them by the aid of\r\nslow and coldly calculated martyrdom, which leads them to certain\r\ndeath. It is, therefore, necessary to establish special legal\r\nprovision for all these exceptional cases, to protect children against\r\nthe power of unworthy parents and all forms of abuse.\r\n\r\nI must here draw attention to the impulse which has recently been\r\ngiven to Austrian legislation on the protection of children, by Lydia\r\nvon Wolfring. The State brings up, in philanthropic institutions,\r\nchildren who have been maltreated, neglected or abandoned, after\r\nremoval from their unworthy parents, but without relieving the latter\r\nof their duty in providing nourishment. According to Miss Wolfring's\r\nsystem, they are cared for by honest couples without children who wish\r\nfor them, under the supervision of the aforesaid institutions. In this\r\nway the children enjoy family life.\r\n\r\nFor educational reasons, the natural family may be imitated in these\r\nartificial ones, by giving to each couple children of both sexes and\r\ndifferent ages. The result is perfect: I have seen in Vienna\r\nartificial families of ten children formed in this way. This shows\r\nagain the rule confirmed by the exception; it would be better for the\r\ngood seed to be more fruitful and the bad sterile.\r\n\r\nThe normal condition must, however, always be for parents to bring up\r\ntheir own children. But here the State and the school should come to\r\ntheir aid, and even intervene with authority; for society is under the\r\nobligation of educating its children to a certain degree of culture,\r\nand maternal or paternal authority should not have the right to\r\nprevent or even attenuate this social work. Obligatory and gratuitous\r\neducation is thus a duty of the State which is becoming more and more\r\nrecognized everywhere, although it is still very incomplete and often\r\nbadly carried out.\r\n\r\nThe State should, moreover, protect the children by restricting the\r\npower of parents more than is done at present. The child should not be\r\nallowed to become an object for exploitation by its parents. It has\r\nalso the right to be protected against all unmerited punishment and\r\nill-treatment. Corporal punishment, which is still practiced in some\r\nschools, is a relic of barbarism which ought to disappear.\r\n\r\nThe State should severely enforce the duty of the procreators of\r\nchildren to nourish their offspring. Rich or poor, no father or mother\r\nshould escape this duty, whether the child is legitimate or\r\nillegitimate. In our imperfect social condition, it is still much too\r\neasy for the man to escape and abandon his child to the mother, or to\r\npublic charity. He should be compelled to provide for the life and\r\neducation of his children, whether legitimate or illegitimate, if he\r\ndoes not bring them up himself. If unable to provide money, he should\r\ndo the equivalent in labor. Such measures, strictly enforced, would be\r\nmore efficacious than all the complicated laws on sexual relations, in\r\nmaintaining monogamy and fidelity.\r\n\r\nI repeat, that these measures should apply to all unworthy parents\r\nfrom whom we are obliged to remove the children. These parents are not\r\nalways of the poorer class.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that I am unjust in charging such duties to poor\r\npeople who can often hardly keep themselves. I agree that in the\r\npresent state of society it is quite impossible for many parents to\r\nundertake such important duties. But duty means right, and it is\r\nevident that we must place rights by the side of the duties which we\r\nimpose on parents.\r\n\r\nTrue justice in this question can only be attained by the essential\r\nprogress of socialism. By socialism, I do not mean certain vague\r\ncommunistic doctrines, nor the Utopias of anarchists who imagine that\r\n\"man was born good,\" but simply an essential social progress in the\r\nstruggle against the domination of individual capital, that is to say,\r\nusury applied to the labor of others owing to the possession of means\r\nof production, which is now left to speculators. Men should be enabled\r\nto enjoy the product of their labor, so that they can lead a human\r\nlife worthy of the name, in sexual matters as in others. But this is\r\nnot all.\r\n\r\nFrom the social point of view, it is absolutely unjust that men who\r\nprocreate children should alone bear the burden of the future\r\ngeneration. We know the egoistic proverb of the celibates, who say: \"I\r\nhave the right to take life easily, to enjoy myself and be idle, if I\r\nrenounce the happiness of having children, either of my own accord or\r\nfrom necessity.\" This proverb, which may be transposed into \"after me\r\nthe deluge,\" cannot be recognized by any healthy social legislation.\r\nIt is the duty of the State to relieve large families, to facilitate\r\nthe procreation of healthy children, and to impose more work and taxes\r\n(for instance, artificial families) on sterile individuals. The old\r\nlaws were better than ours in this respect.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned above the excellent custom, which exists at the\r\npresent day in Norway, of only charging half-price on the boats to\r\nmarried women and other female members of the same family. I cannot\r\nhere enter into the details of this question, but if such reforms are\r\nsome day realized, if universal compulsory education, pensions for old\r\nage, orphans and invalids, etc., are introduced, then no man will have\r\nvalid motives for escaping the duty of feeding his children and\r\nbringing them up decently in family life. This will be left only to\r\nthe idle and vicious.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I can support my propositions by facts. If we compare the\r\nnature of delinquents, abandoned children, vagabonds, etc., in a\r\ncountry where little or nothing has been done for the people (Russia,\r\nGalicia, Vienna, etc.), with that of the same individuals in\r\nSwitzerland, for example, where much has already been done for the\r\npoor, we find this result: In Switzerland, these individuals are\r\nnearly all tainted with alcoholism or pathological heredity; they\r\nconsist of alcoholics, incorrigibles, and congenital decadents, and\r\neducation can do little for them, because nearly all those who have a\r\nbetter hereditary foundation have been able to earn their living by\r\nhonest work. In Russia, Galicia, and even in Vienna, we are, on the\r\ncontrary, astonished to see how many honest natures there are among\r\nthe disinherited, when they are provided with work and education.\r\n\r\nThis fact speaks more than the contradictory statements which the\r\nfanatics of party politics hurl at each other's heads.\r\n\r\n=Inquiry into Paternity.=--It will be objected that inquiry into\r\npaternity is often very difficult and dangerous. I do not deny this;\r\nbut, when women have obtained their natural rights, and when the\r\neducation of young girls is guided by the principles which we have\r\nenunciated in Chapter XVII, the matter will become much easier.\r\nMoreover, even now, we can with energy and good will determine\r\npaternity in most cases. Although the great improvement in means of\r\ntransport assists fugitives, it also favors the discovery and arrest\r\nof individuals all over the world. International relations between all\r\ncivilized states are improving from day to day. When the world is more\r\ncompletely conquered by civilization, we may hope that it will become\r\nincreasingly difficult for evildoers to escape their duties.\r\n\r\nRegarding this question from all points of view it is impossible for\r\nus to give up this primordial condition for the preservation of human\r\nsociety, which consists in making parents responsible for the\r\nnourishment and education of their children.\r\n\r\nThe famous ideas of phalanstery and promiscuity, so often advanced,\r\noriginated in theoretical and dogmatic minds which had lost their\r\ninstinctive sense of human nature, and ignored what natural science\r\nand ethnology have revealed to us.\r\n\r\nBut the responsibility of parents extends to another domain--the duty\r\nof not procreating children who are unhealthy in body and mind. We\r\nshall return to this question later on.\r\n\r\n=Guardianship.=--An excellent institution of our present legislation\r\nis that of the guardianship of orphans, lunatics, etc. It requires to\r\nbe developed extensively and with care. On the contrary, an evil\r\ncustom is the right accorded by certain countries to parishes charged\r\nwith poor and abandoned orphans, of delivering them by public tender\r\nto the man who offers the lowest pension--and only requires them for\r\nwork. This system results in odious abuse, such as neglect, mendicity\r\nand ill-treatment.\r\n\r\nThe fate of illegitimate children who are \"farmed out\" is still worse.\r\nA tacit alliance is established between rapacity on the one hand and\r\nsocial sexual hypocrisy on the other. A number of infanticides and\r\nabortions result, either from poverty, or from sentiments of shame due\r\nto our moral customs. Here, civil law and penal law should combine and\r\ntake energetic humanitarian measures to put a stop to this sad abuse.\r\nAn excellent institution is that of homes in the country established\r\nfor unmarried mothers and their children, and for abandoned mothers in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n=Free Love and Civil Marriage.=--When all the propositions we have\r\ndrawn up have been realized by social legislation, the difference\r\nwhich now exists between marriage and free love will be little more\r\nthan a form. The consequences of these two kinds of union will become\r\nthe same, both for parents and children; the only distinction will\r\nconsist in the existence or non-existence of official control. True\r\nmonogamy will lose nothing, but will gain much.\r\n\r\nWe shall not then have obligatory monogamy as at present, absolute in\r\nform, artificially maintained by the aid of prostitution, that is by\r\nthe most disgusting form of promiscuity which renders monogamy\r\nillusory; but we shall have in its place a relative monogamy much more\r\nsolidly built on the natural rights of the two sexes, it is true more\r\nfree in form, but fundamentally much stronger in the natural and\r\ninstinctive duties dictated by a truly free and reasoned union, as\r\nwell as by the duties by which parents will be bound to their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n=Form and Duration of Civil Marriage.=--Although it may be true that\r\nmonogamy constitutes the most normal and natural form of family union,\r\nand offers the best conditions for lasting happiness, both for parents\r\nand children, we must be blindly prejudiced not to admit that it is\r\nunnatural to consider it as the only sheet anchor in sexual\r\nrelationship, the only admissible form of marriage, and to make it a\r\nstraight-jacket. History and ethnography show us that polygamous races\r\nare strongly developed and are still developing; on the other hand, it\r\nis true that polyandrous races degenerate.\r\n\r\nAgain, impartial observation of our Christian monogamy shows us that\r\nit depends to a great extent on appearances, that it is full of\r\ntrickery and hypocrisy, and that to legally enforce it for life must\r\nbe considered as absolutely impossible.\r\n\r\nIn Catholic countries which prohibit divorce, the latter has been\r\nreplaced by separation, and this becomes the most constant source of\r\nadultery. The more the laws of a country impede divorce, the more one\r\nmust close one's eyes to promiscuity or prostitution, which has even\r\nbeen regulated by the State by the aid of proxenetism, all the while\r\npreaching monogamy in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nThese bitter lessons which practice has given to the partisan, of\r\nobligatory monogamy, prove the absurdity of attempting to restrain the\r\nnatural appetites of man by force and by artificial obstacles. That\r\nwhich succeeds, not without difficulty, with some strong characters,\r\nand more easily with naturally cold temperaments, is impossible to\r\nrealize in the masses.\r\n\r\nPolyandry is usually the result of poverty, and the polyandrous races\r\nare little fecund and tend to disappear. The normal man is\r\ninstinctively more polygynous than the normal woman is polyandrous.\r\nThere are, however, cases where polyandry is justifiable. There are\r\nwomen whose sexual appetite, more or less pathological, is so\r\ninsatiable that a normal man is incapable of satisfying it.\r\n\r\nIf such women were served by several Don Juans by means of a free\r\ncontract, this would be better than giving themselves in despair to\r\nprostitution (there are some prostitutes created by nymphomania). This\r\nsystem would also be better than the seduction of normal young girls\r\nby the Don Juans in question.\r\n\r\nPolygyny is still more indicated when the sterility of the woman or\r\nher repugnance to sexual intercourse cause family disturbances.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of polygamy in Chapter VI, we have shown that it exists in\r\nseveral forms, and that these are not all so humiliating for the women\r\nas people think, who only know of the shameful abuses of the\r\nMussulman's harem. What lowers the moral level of polygyny is\r\nespecially the barbarous system of marriage by purchase, by which the\r\nwomen become slaves burdened with heavy labor, and are in a state of\r\nlegal dependence. We have seen that polygyny has a higher moral\r\ncharacter among certain Indian tribes where matriarchism rules, and\r\nwhere the wife is mistress of the house and family. The danger of\r\ndegradation of the woman ceases when she is equal to the man as\r\nregards rights and property. In fact, in such a social state, polygyny\r\ncan only constitute an exception. It is here entirely free and becomes\r\nall the more innocent because divorce is facilitated and strict laws\r\non the feeding and education of the children limit the male sexual\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nI even venture to maintain that the stability of monogamous marriage,\r\nwhich should be based on mutual sentiments of respect and love, would\r\nbe much better guaranteed than hitherto by legal liberty of conjugal\r\nties, and by duty to children such as I have proposed. If this became\r\nrecognized as conventional, men and women fit to understand each\r\nother and love in a lasting manner, would find suitable mates more\r\neasily, and would become united more permanently when their chains\r\nwere voluntary.\r\n\r\nIf marriages on trial became more frequent in the form of short\r\nunions, ending with separation, this would not be a great evil, for\r\nsimilar unions occur every day in a much baser form. Moreover, the\r\neffect of legislation with regard to children would put a curb on\r\nimmorality and passion, which cause their worst effects.\r\n\r\nIf the objection is raised that this would lead immoral people to\r\navoid the procreation of children so as to enjoy more varied sexual\r\npleasures, I reply that this would be beneficial, for this anti-social\r\nclass of individuals would be eliminated by sterility, by a kind of\r\nnegative selection. We thus place two natural appetites in antagonism;\r\nthat of procreation on the one hand, and sexual enjoyment on the\r\nother. Whoever inclines to the first, which is the higher and tends to\r\npreserve the species, is obliged to restrain himself in the second,\r\nwithout, however, falling into unnatural asceticism.\r\n\r\n=Consanguineous Marriages.=--To avoid injurious consanguinity, it is\r\nsufficient, in my opinion, to prohibit the procreation of children\r\nbetween direct and collateral relations, especially between parents\r\nand children and between brothers and sisters. Anything more than this\r\nis only useless chicanery. Laws which prohibit marriage between\r\nrelations by alliance are absurd, for instance those which forbid a\r\nwidower to marry his sister-in-law (deceased wife's sister), etc.\r\nAmong some peoples such unions are ordained by law!\r\n\r\nThere is also no valid reason to prohibit unions between first cousins\r\nor between uncles and aunts, with nephews and nieces. There is nothing\r\nto prove that such marriages are injurious to the offspring. What is\r\nharmful is the accumulation of hereditary taints, whether they occur\r\nin relations or persons who are strangers to each other. Nevertheless,\r\nthe _perpetuation_ of consanguineous unions in the same family is not\r\nas a rule advisable.\r\n\r\n=Restriction of Personal Liberty in Sexual Life Among Harmful or\r\nDangerous Individuals.=--The inability of men to distinguish, among\r\nthe motives of the acts of their fellows, what is abnormal, unhealthy,\r\nimpulsive or obsessional, from what is healthy and normal is one of\r\nthe most deplorable phenomena in social life, and greatly hinders the\r\naction of reformatory civil legislation and rational administrative\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nThe passionate, confused and unreasonable sentiments of the masses\r\ngive expression, according to the impulse of the moment, to two\r\ncontradictory absurdities and injustices. On the one hand, they cry\r\nout against arbitrary constraint of individual liberty, against\r\nillegal restriction or detention, when competent judges or experts try\r\nto limit the movements of dangerous individuals affected with mental\r\ndisorders, but who appear sane to the incompetent public; or when, to\r\ninsure social safety, they send these individuals to a lunatic asylum,\r\nor limit their dangerous liberty in some other way. On the other hand,\r\nwhen such an individual goes free, thanks to the intervention of\r\nincompetent meddlers, and commits assassination, violation,\r\nincendiarism, or all kinds of sadic atrocities, or even only\r\nterrorizes his own family, these same people, suddenly animated by\r\ncontrary sentiments of vengeance, imperiously demand an exemplary\r\nexpiation and all possible reprisals. This sometimes goes as far as\r\ntorture of the culprit or burning at the stake, as with the lynchers\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult for the psychiatrist, who is the competent expert\r\nin these matters, to make truth and impartiality prevail. He is nearly\r\nalways suspected of seeing madness everywhere, and of being afflicted\r\nwith a mania for sending sane persons to asylums! In reality, he\r\ndesires to take measures which are at the same time humane for the\r\ninsane and protective for society, so as to treat as equitably and\r\nreasonably as possible the unfortunates who are more or less\r\nirresponsible for their acts; he wishes to see established laws and\r\norganizations which will efficiently protect the insane against\r\nthemselves and against the exploitation and abuse of others, at the\r\nsame time preventing them from doing injury to society.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, society and with it the old style of jurist, in\r\ntheir ignorant dread of psychopathological matters, endeavor to take\r\nall possible measures to protect the sane public against the\r\nalienists, thus completely neglecting the true interests of the insane\r\nas well as those of society, while fighting against a phantom! The\r\nanxiety and mistrust of the public in this matter are continually kept\r\nup by \"brigand stories\" related by certain insane or semi-insane\r\npersons, which are spread by the press, always eager for scandal, or\r\nby pamphlets which the cheapness of printing places within the reach\r\nof the poorest!\r\n\r\nThese phenomena of public psychology greatly hinder the most urgent\r\nreforms. The public regard asylums with horror, and the path of the\r\nalienist is thorny, for he is exposed to continual accusations and\r\nthreats whatever he may do, a situation which does not encourage him\r\nto suggest bold innovations.\r\n\r\nIgnorant of psychology and especially of psychopathology, the public\r\nand with it the formal jurist, the slave of codes (I am only speaking\r\nof honest lawyers, and not of the number who abuse the situation to\r\nobtain oratorical and other success and crown themselves with\r\nlaurels), regard themselves as the champions of individual liberty,\r\nand are unable to perceive that the net result of their efforts is, on\r\nthe one hand, to condemn a considerable number of insane and crazy\r\npersons to prison, and on the other hand to assure liberty and\r\nimpunity to the most dangerous individuals, always ready to commit the\r\nmost atrocious crimes, or at any rate to make martyrs of a number of\r\npatient and innocent beings, hard-working and healthy in mind,\r\nespecially women and children.\r\n\r\nThe alienists, who see clearly into all this misery, easily become\r\npessimistic in their impotence against the want of sense, ignorance\r\nand unconscious passion of the masses, and even competent authorities.\r\nThe natural cowardice of men often makes them shut their eyes to avoid\r\nnuisances, and causes them to take no action against the most\r\ndangerous monsters, and especially against those who are most\r\nmischievous by their pens. This is why the martyrdom of unfortunate\r\nwomen and children illtreated by chronic alcoholics, sadists and other\r\nneuropaths or psychopaths, never comes to an end, owing to the stupid\r\noutcry against so-called violation of individual liberty.\r\n\r\nOn this soil, sexual atrocities and crimes, largely increased by\r\ndrink, play an important part. Without troubling myself about\r\nprejudice and indignation I shall say in a few words what appears to\r\nme to be urgent:\r\n\r\nSo long as jurists and legislators will not study either psychology or\r\npsychiatry, and will not submit all habitual criminals and all\r\ndangerous men to an expert examination, all serious reform in this\r\ndomain will remain impossible. To improve the present state of affairs\r\na common understanding between jurists and alienists is urgent; but\r\nthis can only be attained by jurists making a study of psychology, and\r\na kind of practical clinic among imprisoned criminals. How can one\r\njudge and condemn one's neighbor without having the least idea of the\r\nstate of mind of these pariahs of society? All the jurists who have\r\nthe welfare of humanity at heart, should support the _international\r\nunion of penal law_, and the efforts of men like Professor Franz von\r\nLiszt, Gaukler of Caen, and many other courageous reformers.[8]\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that it is not sufficient to combat the excesses\r\nof criminal and dangerous individuals, such as sadists, for example,\r\nby placing them under supervision and preventing them doing harm. It\r\nis also necessary to attack the cause of the evil by preventing their\r\ngerms from being reproduced, degenerated as they usually are by the\r\nblastophthoria of their alcoholic parents (vide Chapter I). The first\r\nquestion, which is purely legal and administrative, does not concern\r\nus here; but I may be allowed to say a few words on the second.\r\n\r\nZealous and advanced reformers have proposed castration in such cases,\r\nwhich has provoked a general cry of indignation. This has been\r\ndiscussed in certain American states. The hyperæsthetic sentiment of\r\nour modern civilization cannot tolerate such ideas, while ancient\r\nraces such as the Islamites provided, and still provide eunuchs as\r\nservants, who are free from danger for their wives, and think little\r\nof hanging or decapitating men who cause them any trouble. In the\r\nsame way, we are dumb and impassive before the butcheries of war,\r\nbecause they are fashionable, especially when we do not come in\r\ncontact with them. The Pope himself formerly procured eunuchs in order\r\nto have soprano voices in his church, and did not hesitate to castrate\r\nyoung boys for this purpose. The times change and we change with them!\r\n\r\nFor some years, however, castration has been employed as a remedy for\r\ncertain disorders both in men and women, especially for hysteria in\r\nwomen. I admit here that, in an asylum which I superintend, I have\r\ncastrated a veritable monster afflicted with constitutional mental\r\ndisorders, taking advantage of the fact that he himself requested this\r\noperation to relieve him of pain in his seminal vesicles, but with the\r\nchief object of preventing the production of unfortunate children\r\ntainted with his hereditary complaint.\r\n\r\nMany years ago I also castrated a young hysterical girl of fourteen,\r\nwhose mother and grandmother were both prostitutes, and who had\r\nalready begun to have intercourse with all the urchins in the street.\r\nHere again, I frankly admit that the hysterical troubles of the\r\npatient served me as an excuse to prevent this unfortunate girl from\r\nreproducing beings who would probably resemble her. I am of opinion\r\nthat castration, or some more benign operation, such as dislocation of\r\nthe Fallopian tubes in women (which renders them sterile without\r\ndestroying the ovaries, or even attenuating the sexual appetite)\r\nshould be performed in order to prevent the reproduction of the most\r\ndeplorable and most dangerous beings.\r\n\r\nAmong certain individuals, such as sadists, whose sexual appetite is\r\ndangerous in itself, castration would be necessary. In my opinion, the\r\nmore benign operations are indicated in all individuals whose\r\npsychopathological condition in this domain is such that they are\r\nabsolutely incapable of resisting their impulses, or of understanding\r\nthe dictates of reason. By this means they could go free instead of\r\nbeing incarcerated in asylums.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I must emphasize the fact that such measures, the\r\npersonal consequences of which are so serious, should only be taken\r\nin the case of absolutely dangerous, incurable individuals, concerning\r\nwhose pathological state there can be no doubt. I also believe that\r\nthese individuals, especially those with sexual abnormalities, would\r\nvery often consent to the operation, as was the case with my two\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nIt would be a great advance if civil legislation would in such cases\r\naccord official recognition to castration or dislocation of the tubes,\r\nwith the consent of the criminal or patient concerned. At present, our\r\nlaws and regulations are such that a psychopathological monster cannot\r\neven be castrated when he wishes it, because medical men refuse to\r\nundertake such an operation without a positive medical indication of\r\nthe usual kind, and because there is no legal protection; yet, when\r\ndone in time, castration would often save sadists and other dangerous\r\nperverts from a criminal life, and society from their crimes and those\r\nof their offspring.\r\n\r\nWhen it is only a question of avoiding the procreation of tainted\r\nchildren, it would be sufficient to instruct reasonable people in the\r\nmethods of avoiding conception (vide Chapter XIV).\r\n\r\nIt is important to bear in mind that modern legislation on marriage\r\noften flavors the reproduction of criminals, lunatics and invalids,\r\nwhile it hinders the production of healthy children by men who are\r\nintelligent, honest and robust. When an abnormal or unhealthy man is\r\nmarried, his wife is obliged to submit to the conception of tainted\r\nchildren. On the other hand, when a strong, healthy and intelligent\r\ngirl is in a situation, it often happens that everything is done to\r\nprevent her marrying, so as not to lose her services; the more\r\nconscientious she is and the more attached to her masters, the more\r\noften is this likely to occur.\r\n\r\nGirls who have illegitimate children often lose their situations and\r\ntheir honor. The consideration of cases of everyday occurrence is\r\nsufficient to grasp the difficulty of the question. What we require is\r\nmore personal liberty for healthy, normal and adaptable individuals,\r\nand more restrictions for the abnormal, unhealthy and dangerous. The\r\ncivil law of the future will have to take these facts into\r\nconsideration, if it wishes to keep level with scientific progress,\r\nand prevent the instinct of the people having recourse to lynch law,\r\nor retaliation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, attempts have been made to get out of the difficulty by\r\nprohibiting the marriage of insane persons or by declaring their\r\nmarriage null when it has already been consummated; or again, by\r\nadmitting insanity as a cause for divorce. Such measures are good as\r\nmakeshifts in a period of transition. They assume that conceptions\r\nonly occur in marriage, and that marriage necessarily means\r\nprocreation. But these two suppositions are false, for it is only the\r\npressure of custom and legislation which realizes them in part,\r\nespecially in Catholic countries.\r\n\r\nThe civil code, in the present state of society, has at least the\r\nadvantage of making possible the dissolution of monstrous unions, such\r\nas those of the absolutely insane or certain psychopaths of the worst\r\nkind. Unfortunately, divorce is as a rule only accorded in cases of\r\nwell-marked mental disorders, while in reality the most atrocious\r\nunions are those which are contracted by crazy persons with only\r\ndiminished responsibility, in whom the public and the law are unable\r\nto recognize or understand the existence of a definite mental anomaly.\r\nThese people most often marry at a time when no one has yet recognized\r\ntheir true mental condition, or foreseen the consequences of their\r\nmarriage. The unfortunate who finds herself (or himself) bound by such\r\na union is then an object of endless martyrdom. The frequency of\r\nmental anomalies causes them to play an immense, and too often\r\nunrecognized role, in unhappy marriages.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the mother the tribunal of Bâle recently prohibited\r\nthe marriage of a young man affected with a slight degree of mental\r\nweakness. This judgment was upheld by the Swiss tribunal for the\r\nfollowing reasons: \"Although capable of work, of earning his living,\r\nand of performing his military service, an individual may be an\r\nunsuitable subject for marriage. In the interests of family life and\r\nthe future generation, it is the duty of the State to prevent the\r\nmarriage of the feeble-minded, in order to avoid the perpetuation of a\r\nrace of degenerates.\" I quote this from a journal. We can only\r\ncongratulate tribunals which have the courage to consider the vital\r\ninterests of the nation in their judgments.\r\n\r\n=Right of Succession.=--Although right of succession has no direct\r\nbearing on the sexual question, it is indirectly connected with it\r\nthrough its influence on the procreation of children.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the poor have more children than the well-to-do.\r\nThis is because they have nothing to lose, because coitus is one of\r\ntheir few pleasures, because they are ignorant of the means of\r\npreventing conception, and because they hope to profit by their\r\nchildren's labor. People who have some property are, on the contrary,\r\nafraid of falling into poverty through the procreation of too many\r\nchildren, and those who possess more are afraid of poverty for their\r\noffspring. The latter only desire a few heirs, so that after their\r\ndeath they can leave each a fortune suitable to their social position.\r\n\r\nIn France, especially, well-to-do people often limit their families to\r\ntwo. The parents have the unhappy idea that a certain fortune must be\r\nassured to their children to enable them to live in comfort. They do\r\nnot understand that the necessity for a man to earn his living by work\r\nis the chief condition for a healthy existence.\r\n\r\nAgain, among very rich people there is often the fear that a large\r\nfortune may lose its power when divided, and thus diminish the\r\ninfluence of the family.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that great poverty and great wealth constitute two\r\nextreme social evils. It is deplorable for a child to grow up with the\r\nidea that he will inherit a large fortune, enjoy life without working,\r\nand regard poor people more or less as subordinates. But it is still\r\nworse for a man to remain all his life an object for exploitation, in\r\nspite of the most repugnant and most arduous work, unless his superior\r\nfaculties and good luck give him the chance of rising. It is also\r\ndiscouraging for a man to be unable by arduous work to obtain anything\r\nfor himself or his wife and children, and only to work for society,\r\nand especially for the interests of capitalists.\r\n\r\nHuman instinct is not sufficiently social to allow of assiduous and\r\nhearty work solely in the interests of the community. The egoistic\r\nsentiments and family instincts of man are still much too strong.\r\n\r\nIf we take all these facts into consideration, the right of\r\nsuccession becomes very important. It has been attempted to deal with\r\nthe question by progressive taxes on succession to large fortunes: but\r\nthis is not enough. I have not the presumption to give a positive\r\nopinion on these matters which are not in my province, but I venture\r\nto suggest the possibility of greatly restricting the right of\r\nsuccession by postponing the right to the enjoyment of their heritage\r\ntill the children are of an age when they could earn their own living;\r\nsay, from twenty-five to twenty-six, so as not to interfere with their\r\nhigher education. In this way a man would not be deprived of the\r\npleasure of working for himself and his family; and every young man\r\nand young woman, being obliged to work at some special subject, would\r\nknow that they could earn their living after twenty-five or\r\ntwenty-six, without counting on their heritage.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to build a new social system on this idea, for many\r\npropositions of the kind have already been made. I only wish to draw\r\nattention to one element of the problem, which consists in diminishing\r\nthe possibility of the exploitation of man by man, without destroying\r\nthe pleasure for work, at the same time favoring the procreation and\r\neducation of healthy and capable offspring. This naturally presupposes\r\na new moral and social state, in which family right would be changed\r\nand good education organized for all. Even then intelligent men would\r\nhave the desire to rise above the average and bring up their children\r\nwith the same object. This is an instinct in mental development which\r\nshould be carefully cultivated, and not extinguished, by every social\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nIn all social systems it must be recognized that certain branches of\r\nculture, such as scientific research and art, involve great expense\r\nand bring little or no material reward to the scientist or the artist.\r\nA richer State ought to provide for these important branches of\r\ncivilization, which always tend to higher culture.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned separation of property and an equable\r\ndivision of the fruits of labor between conjoints as the only just\r\nbasis in marriage contracts. I repeat here, that true justice can only\r\nbe established by the recognition of equal legal rights for men and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENAL LAW\r\n\r\nPenal law is the right of punishment. It is based on the ideas of\r\n_culpability_ and _expiation_, and these are based on the idea of\r\nfree-will, which is itself founded on a pure illusion, as we have\r\nshown above.\r\n\r\nThis simple reflection is sufficient to show the precarious position\r\nof our present penal law. The science of penal law has too long\r\nignored the progress of humanity and of the other sciences. It is\r\naffected with incurable marasmus, because its foundations are laid in\r\nerror. The idea of expiation was naturally developed on the basis of\r\nmysticism combined with the right of the stronger, and associated with\r\nthe sentiment of vengeance natural to the low mentality of our animal\r\nancestors. Among the latter the weaker was punished because he was the\r\nweaker: \"_Væ victis!_\" and order was obtained by force. But the\r\nvisions of human imagination having urged man to create a god or gods\r\nin his own image, he attributed to the divinity the sentiments of\r\nanger experienced by man, and pretended that expiation was required\r\nfor offenses against this or that majesty or human idea, transformed\r\ninto an offense to the divine majesty.\r\n\r\nThis offense to the divinity was therefore only the nebulous\r\nexpression of a developing social conscience in man, an obscure\r\nmixture of sentiments of wounded sympathy, adulation of the strong and\r\ngreat, and desire for vengeance and expiation. Till then man was\r\naccustomed to judge other men according to the right of the stronger,\r\nmore or less mitigated by sentiments of family and friendship. His\r\nterror of natural mysteries--the forest, night, thunder, hurricanes,\r\nstars, etc., led him to imagine the intervention of occult powers, and\r\nlater on of higher powers capable of judging good and evil actions,\r\nthe ideas of good and evil being formerly very different from what\r\nthey are at present. The functions of advocates or executors of the\r\ndivine will were always, however, reserved for privileged men, who\r\ngave judgment in His name, either as priests, kings, or later on as\r\njudges. We may also note by the way that judgment can be given without\r\nbelief in free arbitration, as is shown by the Mahometan fatalists and\r\nthe judgments of Haroun-al-Raschid, for example. In fact, fatalism\r\nlogically excludes the idea of free-will, for if everything is\r\nabsolutely predetermined, the thoughts, resolutions and acts of man\r\nare also predetermined, which excludes all liberty.\r\n\r\n=Responsibility.=--I have attempted to show in another work[9] that a\r\nrational penal law should in no way concern itself with the question\r\nof free arbitration. The fact that we feel free and responsible is not\r\nat all sufficient to justify the doctrine of Kant.\r\n\r\nThe question of knowing whether an absolute predestination (fatalism,\r\nregulating the universe in advance in all its details) exists or not,\r\nis a question of pure metaphysics, the solution of which is quite\r\nbeyond human comprehension, and need not occupy us here. We must\r\nsimply depend on the scientific postulate of determinism, _i.e._, on\r\nthe law of causality applied to the motives of our actions, a law\r\nwhich is very much like that of the conservation of energy, and which\r\nadmits of divers possibilities for the future, for it does not assume\r\na knowledge of the first cause of the universe nor the will of a\r\ndivinity.\r\n\r\nWe shall then understand that the complication of our cerebral\r\nactivities, mnemic and actual, combined with the fact that a great\r\npart of them (and consequently of the motives for our actions) remain\r\nsubconscious, must produce in us the illusion of free-will.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we shall find the measure of what we are to\r\nunderstand by relative liberty, in the plastic faculties of the\r\nactivity of the human brain, which allow it to adapt itself as\r\nadequately as possible to the numerous and diverse complications of\r\nexistence, and especially to social relations between mankind.\r\n\r\nThe most adaptable man is the most free, especially in the sense of\r\nactive and conscious adaptation. There are also men who adapt\r\nthemselves passively and are easily molded. This passive plasticity at\r\nany rate renders them capable of submitting to everything and only\r\nprovoking conflict as a last resource. These individuals are no doubt\r\nless free, since they obey the impulses of others; nevertheless, their\r\nelasticity gives them a certain relative liberty, because they do not\r\nfeel constraint and easily adapt themselves to laws and other social\r\nrequirements. But the highest form of liberty, the moral faculty of\r\nhigher adaptation, is not that of the human fox who exploits others\r\nfor his own profit, but that of true higher intellects, capable of\r\nadapting their activity to the social requirements of humanity. On the\r\ncontrary, the man who is least free is the one who, dominated by his\r\npassions and baser appetites, or by insufficiency of intelligence or\r\nwill power, is thereby incapable of conducting himself reasonably,\r\ngives way to all temptations and impulses, falls into all kinds of\r\nsnares, cannot keep to any resolution, and is in perpetual conflict\r\nwith society.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of the theoretical belief in free-will in this case?\r\nThis man feels subjectively as free, or often more free, than one who\r\nis more reasonable and more master of himself, and yet he is a slave!\r\nWhen, dominated by his psychic bonds, he violates the law, he is\r\npunished, but he himself resents the punishment as an injustice. The\r\njudge who condemns him and imagines he holds the scales of justice in\r\nequilibrium, only carries out the principles of an unjust law, a kind\r\nof mild retaliation, exacting moderate expiation. Or again, by\r\nexercising a right derived from old traditions based on religious\r\nideas, he plays the part of proxy for the Deity and judges in His\r\nplace. We might even say that a mail is in reality all the more free\r\nthe better he realizes that he is not so, _i.e._, that his actions\r\ndepend on the activity of his brain! At any rate he will then be less\r\noften deceived and will react in a more plastic manner.\r\n\r\n=The True Task of Penal Law; Its Traditional Errors in the Sexual\r\nQuestion.=--Penal law has only one thing to do, that is to cut itself\r\nfree from its roots and transplant itself on a social and scientific\r\nsoil. There would then be no longer a penal law, but a _law protecting\r\nsociety against dangerous individuals, and a law of administration for\r\npersons incapable of conducting themselves_. Its task would be the\r\ncomplement of that of civil law. Henceforth the judge would cease to\r\npass judgment on his neighbor and his neighbor's motives, acting as a\r\nproxy for God. He would no longer punish, but would content himself\r\nwith protecting, restraining and ameliorating.\r\n\r\nThe history of psychiatry and sorcery proves that we are not\r\nexaggerating. It is not very long since the insane were regarded, not\r\nas persons suffering from disease, but as criminals and sorcerers, and\r\nwere treated by punishment and exorcism. The ancients, on the\r\ncontrary, especially certain Greek and Roman physicians (notably\r\n_Caelius Aurelianus_) had already recognized that insanity was a\r\ndisease of the brain, and had distinguished its different forms.\r\n\r\nEven at the present day, we find among the Catholics and among certain\r\nProtestant sects, as among savages, a belief in sorcery, and if this\r\nbelief got the upper hand, prosecution for sorcery--exorcism and other\r\nforms of cruelty--would soon become the fashion.\r\n\r\nBefore the sixteenth century prosecutions for sorcery were universal,\r\nand remained very common for a long time afterwards. It is only since\r\nthe time of the French Revolution that insanity has been recognized as\r\na mental disease. Even in the nineteenth century a German alienist,\r\nHeinroth, punished the insane like criminals. The atrocious prejudice\r\nof the people against the insane dates from the time of prosecution\r\nfor sorcery.\r\n\r\nEven now we are the slaves of a prejudice which holds a legal\r\nconviction sufficient to dishonor the prisoner and stain his character\r\nfor the rest of his days. Hans Leuss' book, _Aus dem Zuchthause_ (From\r\nthe prison), 1904, is very instructive on this point. Condemned to\r\nprison himself, the author makes some wise and dispassionate\r\nobservations which give food for reflection. I may also quote the\r\nwords of Doctor Guillaume, who was for a long time superintendent of\r\nthe penitentiary at Neuchatel, and who is now director of the Swiss\r\nfederal bureau of statistics at Berne. The question we are dealing\r\nwith had been treated in a discussion in which I took part, and to\r\nwhich Doctor Guillaume had listened silently. At the conclusion, he\r\nsaid to us: \"Gentlemen, in the course of my life I have become\r\nacquainted with a large number of convicts, but I have never been able\r\nto discover among them more than two classes of individuals; the one\r\nclass were diseased, and the others ... ah! the others; the more I\r\nstudy their cases and their personality, I ask myself if I should not\r\nhave done as they did under the same circumstances!\" It is unnecessary\r\nto say that Doctor Guillaume did not mean to establish two clearly\r\nmarked classes, for most criminals represent a mixture of both; but\r\nhis main idea gives a good idea of the question of penal law.\r\n\r\nHow sexual questions lead to conflicts with penal law, how penal law\r\njudges them, and how it ought to judge them after what we have just\r\nsaid, I can only refer to what I have said concerning civil law. Our\r\npresent penal law is aware of singular sexual crimes and often\r\npunishes them from curious motives.\r\n\r\nWhen a poor imbecile, ridiculed by women and overcome by his sexual\r\nappetite, copulates with a cow, the latter is not injured in any way;\r\nneither is the owner. Moreover, the question of property does not\r\ntrouble the judge, for he punishes sodomy even when the culprit owns\r\nthe animal. How does the law obtain the right to punish an act which\r\ndoes no harm to any one, nor to society, nor even to an animal? It is\r\nevidently a vestige of religious mysticism, something like punishment\r\nfor sinning against the Holy Ghost. The sins of Sodom and Gomorrah,\r\nthey say, caused the wrath of God, who destroyed these towns for this\r\nreason. According to the legend, sodomy was a vice of the inhabitants;\r\nis this why it is punished at the present day? But the masturbation of\r\nOnan, according to the Bible, also caused the wrath of God; why then\r\ndo not our present laws institute punishment for those who practice\r\nit?\r\n\r\nIn many of the Swiss cantons and in Germany, sexual connection between\r\nmen is prosecuted by law. The German legislators have even recently\r\ndiscussed the question whether punishment should be enforced only when\r\nthe penis of one man is introduced into the anus of the other\r\n(pederasty), or whether indecent contact and mutual onanism are\r\nsufficient to justify punishment.\r\n\r\nOur penal law is thus concerned with the question whether it should\r\npunish or not, according as this or that mucous membrane or part of\r\nthe skin is used for the satisfaction of a morbid sexual appetite!\r\nThese are truly singular points for a legislator to decide, compelled,\r\nin spite of his incompetence, to play the part of physiologist,\r\nanatomist and psychologist!\r\n\r\nIf I am correctly informed, the German legislation is inconsistent in\r\npunishing sexual intercourse between two men, but not between two\r\nwomen. These examples suffice to show what blind-alleys a penal law\r\nleads to, the basis of which is vicious and which is guided by the\r\ntraditions of mysticism.\r\n\r\nQuite recently, in the Swiss journal of penal law, a jurist seriously\r\nupheld the necessity for the conception of a crime against religion!\r\nIdeas of this kind would lead us to punish suicide, like the English.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to analyze the facts from the point of view of\r\ntheir true social value.\r\n\r\n=Limits of Penal Law in the Sexual Domain.=--If we would avoid\r\ninjustice and ridiculous contradictions, we should keep to the\r\nprinciple that penal justice has only the right to intervene in cases\r\nwhere individuals or society are injured, or run the risk of being\r\ninjured. It is also necessary to examine, in each case, whether the\r\nperson who has committed the offense was not irresponsible and\r\naffected with mental disease at the time; or whether his\r\nresponsibility was not diminished, _i.e._, whether he was not\r\nseriously abnormal without being quite insane. The conception of\r\nresponsibility, necessarily relative, should be understood in the\r\nsense of relative liberty, which we have defined above.\r\n\r\nAccording to the result of the inquiry (culpability being proved) the\r\njudge will have to decide how society can be best protected against\r\nthe repetition of such acts, and how the culprit may be most easily\r\nimproved, provided he is capable of improvement.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, the culprit is an inebriate, his detention in a home\r\nfor inebriates will protect society and benefit the individual much\r\nbetter than all the fines and imprisonments at present in force.\r\n\r\nIf he is an incorrigible recidivist, incapable of resisting his\r\ncriminal impulses, the law should keep him under observation in a safe\r\nplace, or deprive him only of certain dangerous liberties. It is not\r\nso difficult to decide these questions as the public imagines. The\r\nantecedents of the criminal, his previous convictions, and a careful\r\nstudy of his psychology will nearly always lead to a clear diagnosis\r\nand prognosis. In this case a mutual understanding between\r\npsychiatrists and jurists will produce excellent results. It is\r\nneedless to say that if it is only a case of transient cerebral\r\nobnubilation, such as sunstroke or somnambulism, etc., the culprit\r\nshould be acquitted.\r\n\r\n=Rape, etc.=--Normal coitus may render a penal action legitimate when\r\nit is obtained by force or stratagem (rape, abuse of a feeble-minded\r\nor hypnotized person, etc.). It is evident that measures of protection\r\nagainst such acts are urgent, and that persons abused in this way\r\nshould have the right to heavy indemnities. What we require is not so\r\nmuch extenuation of penalty for the culprit as greater protection for\r\nhis victims.\r\n\r\nIn cases of rape, when the woman becomes pregnant against her will, I\r\nam of opinion that artificial abortion should be allowed by law as an\r\nexceptional measure. We cannot expect a woman to have a child imposed\r\nupon her by a man's violence, especially when she is unmarried, and\r\noblige her to bring it up, from the simple fact that she conceived it.\r\nIt should be the same in cases of abduction of female minors.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the contrary, a male minor seduced by an adult woman, makes\r\nher pregnant, it is the woman only who is responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of her child, and there are no reasons to accord her the\r\nright of abortion, for it is she who desired the sexual act. The close\r\nbonds which exist between the child and its mother justify such legal\r\ndispositions.\r\n\r\nWith regard to civil laws, we have mentioned the case of venereal\r\ninfection after coitus. In this case civil indemnity would be most\r\nequitable. A penal action could only be based on prosecution by the\r\ninjured party, unless it was a question of directly criminal\r\nintent--infection for vengeance, for example.\r\n\r\n=Incest.=--Under the heading of _consanguineous marriages_, we have\r\nseen to what extent the conception of incest should be limited, in\r\nrespect to civil law. The grave cases of incest are those between\r\nparents and children. Their normal causes are mental anomalies,\r\nalcoholism, proletarian promiscuity, or isolation of a family in some\r\nremote place. Incest is common, in Switzerland especially, among the\r\ninhabitants of isolated mountain chalets. I will give a few typical\r\nand genuine examples of incest giving rise to penal actions:\r\n\r\n(1). A drunken and brutal husband persecuted his wife with excessive\r\ncoitus. The latter then gave him her own daughter to satisfy his\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n(2). An inebriate woman induced her own son, aged seventeen, to have\r\nintercourse with her. Infuriated at the idea that his mother had made\r\nhim her lover, he murdered her one day when he was drunk. Condemned as\r\na parricide, this young man conducted himself in prison in a model\r\nmanner. Alcohol, combined with his incestuous seduction, had made him\r\nthe murderer of his mother.\r\n\r\n(3). In a family composed exclusively of imbeciles and psychopaths,\r\nsome of whom were put under my care for treatment, incest was\r\npracticed among nearly all of them; between father and daughters;\r\nbetween mother and sons; and between brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\nThe last case, and many others, show that incest is not the cause but\r\nthe effect of mental disorders. This does not mean that the offspring\r\nof such unions are not slightly tainted by the mere fact of such\r\nconcentrated incest, but these cases are comparatively so rare that\r\nthey do not contribute to any appreciable extent, as incest, in\r\ncausing degeneration of the race; the factor which causes degeneration\r\nis here mental disease, which arises from other hereditary causes,\r\nchiefly of blastophthoric origin.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have said it results that a penal action for incest\r\nshould only take place in the case of minors or insane persons, abuse\r\nof strength or power, or rape. The measures of civil law should\r\nsuffice to reduce other cases of incest to a minimum.\r\n\r\nThe disgust which the generality of men feel for sexual union between\r\nbrothers and sisters, and especially between parents and children, is\r\nthe best protection against incest. The elimination of alcoholism, the\r\nsuperintendence of the insane, and the improvement of our social\r\norganization are much more likely than penal laws to lead to the\r\ngradual disappearance of incest.\r\n\r\n=Assaults on Minors.=--All assaults on minors should naturally be\r\nprosecuted. But prosecution should take a different form according as\r\nthe culprit is affected with a pathological perverse disposition, or\r\nwhether it is simply a question of abuse of confidence committed by a\r\nnormal man. A master who, having no sexual anomaly, commits assaults\r\non young girls, his pupils, should be deprived of the right of\r\nteaching in girls' schools, for it is only there that he is dangerous.\r\nIf, on the other hand, he is affected with perversion (pederasty,\r\netc.), further measures for protection should be taken against him;\r\naccording to the circumstances.\r\n\r\n=Sexual Perversions.=--When we pass, on to sexual perversions, the\r\ninconsequences and mysticism of our present penal law become still\r\nmore apparent. This code often prosecutes and punishes sexual actions\r\nwhich do no harm to any one, or which two persons practice of their\r\nown accord. Such cases may be suitable for moral or medical treatment,\r\nbut should never justify a penal prosecution. This applies to all the\r\nmanipulations of onanism, pederasty, masochism, fetichism, etc., which\r\ntake place between adults by mutual agreement.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of prosecuting inverts? It is a fortunate thing for\r\nsociety that these psyhcopaths are contented with their mutual sexual\r\nintercourse, the result of which is sterile and therefore does no harm\r\nto posterity. The real crime is the marriage of an invert to an\r\nindividual of the opposite sex, and yet this crime is sanctioned by\r\nthe law! It is a crime against the normal conjoint and against the\r\nchildren who may result from such an unhappy union. By severely\r\npunishing homosexual intercourse, the penal laws of many countries\r\nprovoke the lowest form of blackmail, as Krafft-Ebing, Moll,\r\nHirschfeld and others have proved by numerous examples, and as I have\r\nmyself confirmed among many of my patients.\r\n\r\nIt is quite another thing with abnormal or perverse forms of the\r\nsexual appetite, which can only be satisfied against the will of their\r\nobject, or by injuring it more or less severely. Here it is the duty\r\nof the law to organize energetic measures of protection; not with a\r\nview to punish the pervert, who is a diseased person, but to protect\r\nhis victims in time.\r\n\r\nWe will first deal with _sadism_; secondly with the violation of\r\nchildren. Here a very delicate question arises. In the case of such\r\nterrible sexual appetites we should not wait for victims before taking\r\naction. On the other hand, we cannot punish a man, nor even take\r\nadministrative measures against him, simply from the fact that he\r\npossesses a dangerous appetite, especially if he is in other respects\r\nwell-behaved and conscientious, and strives with all his might against\r\nhis perversion. I have treated a patient who suffered from a terrible\r\npathological appetite of this kind. He was a highly moral man who\r\nnever harmed any one, but was in a state of despair over his\r\naffliction, which he resisted with all his power, seeking relief in\r\nmasturbation when his passion became too violent.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, the moral sentiments of an individual offer sufficient\r\nsocial protection, and it is neither the right nor the duty of the\r\nphysician to denounce him. But he should advise the patient to retire\r\nto an asylum to avoid committing a crime, if he feels that he cannot\r\nrestrain his passions. It is very rare for such cases to come to the\r\nknowledge of the public, for these patients prefer to suffer in\r\nsilence or to commit suicide; but they are none the less instructive\r\nand characteristic.\r\n\r\nAt other times dangerous perversions are discovered by chance, the\r\npervert, instead of resisting his passion, seeking opportunities to\r\nsatisfy it without discovery. In such cases strong measures should be\r\nenforced. Unfortunately, sadists are very well aware of the dangers\r\nthey run, and know better than any other criminals how to commit their\r\ncrimes without being discovered. As soon as the perpetrator of a sadic\r\ncrime is discovered, or simply an attempt at sadism, he should be\r\narrested and placed where he can do no harm. The question of\r\ncastration arises here: but we do not know yet how far this protects\r\nthe sadist and his victim against recurrence. If this operation proves\r\nefficacious it should never be neglected.\r\n\r\nThe _exhibitionists_ present great difficulty. They are not dangerous,\r\nsince they touch nobody. Their \"victims,\" if they can be called so,\r\nare girls or women before whom they expose their genital organs and\r\nmasturbate. No doubt modesty may be much offended by such acts,\r\nespecially in young girls and children; disgust and fear may also harm\r\nthem; but I think the law is too severe in these cases, for there is\r\nno question of an injury which is dangerous in itself. I have known\r\nlittle girls who have been frightened several times by exhibitionists,\r\nbut I have never known them injured by the disgust which they\r\nexperienced. The affair is too ridiculous and too ugly. It would be\r\nsufficient to send exhibitionists to an asylum for short periods,\r\nunless extreme weakness on their part necessitated prolonged\r\ndetention.\r\n\r\nSimple _necrophilia_ should be treated in the same way by penal law.\r\nBut this perversion is more dangerous on account of its relationship\r\nwith sadism. There are some sadists who are only necrophiliacs for\r\nfear of becoming assassins. Such individuals are very dangerous and\r\nshould be kept in confinement.\r\n\r\nThe _fetichists_ are, on the contrary, generally very innocent. At the\r\nmost they might be prosecuted for theft when they take away their\r\nfetiches. One of their worst misdemeanors is that of cutting off the\r\nhair of young girls.\r\n\r\n=Concubinage. Prostitution. Proxenetism. White Slavery.=--We have\r\nalready seen that concubinage should never be punishable in itself,\r\nalthough it is so in some countries. We shall not again return to the\r\nquestion whether prostitution should be the object of judicial and\r\npenal actions. Proxenetism and white slavery, on the contrary, cause\r\ngrave injury to the rights of many individuals and should be made\r\ncriminal offenses; for they are crimes against society and the\r\nindividual, and committed for lucre. It cannot be legal to do commerce\r\nwith the body of one's neighbor: this is a crime which is closely\r\nrelated to slavery and similar abuses. (Vide Chapter X.)\r\n\r\nThe law should punish all public solicitation, obscenity or sexual\r\nbrutality, but the punishment should take a milder form. The sexual\r\nact and everything connected with it should be absolutely free, but a\r\nman has no right to provoke or annoy his neighbor by indecent sexual\r\ninvitations if the latter does not wish to respond to them.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, extremely difficult to fix the limits of what is\r\nlicit, for prudery may also go too far and regard the most innocent\r\nallusions as provocations. It is absolutely necessary to leave a\r\nmargin for normal sexual invitations. All that is required is that\r\nthey should not overstep the limits of recognized propriety, so long\r\nas there is not mutual agreement between the two parties. (Vide\r\n_Flirtation_, Chapter IV.)\r\n\r\n=Lewdness. Pornography.=--The question naturally presents itself of\r\nknowing how far it is permitted to proceed publicly with a mutual\r\nagreement without causing offense or injury to other parties. On the\r\nwhole, our customs are free enough in this respect, and a greater\r\nliberty in public flirtation would be inconvenient. For instance, lewd\r\nexhibitions, coitus, etc., could not be allowed in public places.\r\nChildren especially should be protected against such excitations of\r\nthe sexual appetite, and it is necessary to fix a legal distinction\r\nbetween what is offensive and what is not offensive to public\r\npropriety or modesty.\r\n\r\nSimple police regulations are sufficient for this purpose, but they\r\nare very necessary to protect women and children, and occasionally\r\nyoung men, against importunities or sexual obsessions, against sexual\r\nsolicitation, or even against assault or other offenses, such as\r\nincitement to masturbation, obscene words and gestures, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is, no doubt, very difficult to define the limits. Our modern\r\ncustoms have left a large margin for pornography, which they treat\r\nlike a spoiled child. The most dangerous form, however, is not that\r\nwhich flaunts itself in shop windows, by advertisements and placards,\r\nin public kiosks and dancing rooms; but the refined and æsthetic\r\npornography which appears in the form of elegant engravings, erotic\r\nnovels and dramas, under the cloak of art and even under that of\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the public is a very bad judge of these things. Certain\r\nbooks have openly and fearlessly described the sexual vices of our\r\ntime--for example, Zola's novels and the dramas of Brieux--and these\r\nhave been stigmatized as pornographic. As a matter of fact their\r\nauthors in no way merit such a reproach. Such works in no way\r\nencourage immorality; on the contrary, they inspire disgust and a\r\nhealthy and holy terror at the perversity of our sexual customs. No\r\ndoubt such works may have an erotic action on ignorant and low-minded\r\npersons. The Tyrolean peasants, in their moral indignation, have been\r\nknown to destroy the marble statues of women erected in public places.\r\nSuch acts serve no purpose, for prudery will never rid the world of\r\neroticism; it will only increase it by leading to hypocrisy. We have\r\nsomething better to do than persecute and insult true art and men of\r\ntalent or genius who expose our social perversions.\r\n\r\nPornography is quite another thing. It is not contented with\r\nrepresenting the æsthetic, licit, and normal side of natural\r\neroticism. It does not depict sexual vice so as to emphasize its\r\nugliness and its tragic consequences, but to glorify it. Whether it is\r\nrepresented as brazen nudity unadorned, or enveloped in a transparent\r\nveil which reveals everything it pretends to hide; whether it reels in\r\nbacchanalian orgies; whether it appears in brilliant fancy dress\r\nilluminated by electric lights, or in the discreet light of a\r\nfashionable boudoir; whether it is clearly revealed or equivocal,\r\nperverted in one way or depraved in another; in all its forms its aim\r\nis to tickle, to excite, to seduce, to allure, by arousing lewdness\r\nand inflaming its lowest passions.\r\n\r\nThe pornographic dishes are often served up with a sentimental and\r\nmoral sauce which naturally does not tend to hide the flavor of the\r\nmeat--for then all its charm would be gone--on the contrary it\r\nincreases its spicy quality by means of contrast, at the same time\r\nmaking the product more marketable; this hypocritical disguise giving\r\nit a certain varnish of propriety. The trick of clothing pornographic\r\narticles with the mantle of virtue may deceive the artless, and give\r\nthe less artless excuse for buying them without putting themselves to\r\nany inconvenience. In such cases it is extremely difficult to act\r\nwithout injustice and without doing injury to art and science by\r\nvexatious measures. This requires much tact and rare perspicacity.\r\n\r\n=Other Sexual Misdemeanors.=--Many sexual assaults are committed on\r\nthe insane and feeble-minded, in the hope that they will not defend\r\nthemselves and denounce the criminal. We have mentioned the case of\r\ninverts who become attendants in lunatic asylums in order to satisfy\r\ntheir appetites. Such crimes should be classed with those committed\r\nagainst minors. In the first place it is necessary to take into\r\naccount the special dangers they present, and in the second place, the\r\npersonality of the criminal, his capacity for repentance, improvement,\r\nand self-control.\r\n\r\n=Artificial Abortion.=--It is a difficult question to decide whether a\r\nwoman should have the right to dispose of the embryo she carries in\r\nher womb, and the duties of society with regard to this question. It\r\nis certainly the duty of society to protect the child as soon as it\r\nis born. In this case the laws cannot be too severe in protecting the\r\nchild from unnatural parents, or from the \"baby farmers,\" whose\r\nbusiness is to get rid of the infants by starving them or exposing\r\nthem to disease.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with analogous abuses which we have mentioned with\r\nregard to civil law. These crimes or misdemeanors very often result as\r\nmuch from the economic organization of our society, as from want of\r\nprotection for infancy and girl-mothers, as well as from the shame\r\nwith which the latter are branded by our hypocritical customs.\r\n\r\nThe question becomes more difficult with regard to the embryo _before\r\nbirth_. Should the law punish artificial abortion? Opinions on this\r\nquestion vary. I have already said that in cases of rape, and forced\r\npregnancy in general, the right to artificial abortion should be\r\nconceded to the woman. On the other hand, I think it should be\r\nprohibited on principle when the fecundating coitus has been voluntary\r\non both sides, and when there is no medical reason for such a measure.\r\nIn principle, the human embryo, when once conceived, should have the\r\nright to live. Birth is only an episode in its life. This generally\r\ntakes place at the end of the ninth lunar month of pregnancy, but a\r\nchild born at the seventh month is often viable. It is, therefore,\r\narbitrary not to recognize the right of the embryo to live. On the\r\ncontrary, the right that a woman has to dispose of her body would seem\r\nto outweigh this, when conception has been imposed on her by stratagem\r\nor violence. In fact, the right of the embryo to life should depend on\r\nthe wish of the bearers of each of the two germs by which it is\r\nformed, at the moment of conception.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, numerous exceptions to the above rule should be\r\nallowed, and doctors should not be too severe, for it would be for\r\nthem to decide in most cases whether artificial abortion was licit or\r\nnot. Some pregnancies are a veritable misfortune for the parents and\r\noffspring, when the bodily and mental health of the mother or child,\r\nor both of them, is in danger. When a lunatic or an idiot, married or\r\nnot, makes a woman pregnant, artificial abortion should be allowed;\r\nalso in all cases when an insane or epileptic woman becomes pregnant.\r\n\r\nAn analogous case is that where a drunkard renders his wife pregnant\r\nagainst her will, especially when he is intoxicated at the moment; for\r\nthe offspring runs a great risk of blastophthoria.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that abortion should be permitted whenever\r\npregnancy seriously endangers the life or health of the mother, or\r\nwhen a grave disease in the mother condemns the child to become an\r\ninvalid. On the other hand, such indications should not be acted on\r\ntoo lightly; a rational limit is here a matter of practice and common\r\nsense, combined with medical science.\r\n\r\n=The Right to Live of Monsters, Idiots, or the Deformed.=--The\r\npreceding remarks naturally lead us to the question whether children\r\nwho are born invalids, deformed, or idiots, etc., should be\r\nnecessarily condemned to live by the law, and whether special\r\ndispositions should not be made for such cases.\r\n\r\nThe obligation to preserve, often by means of all the resources of\r\nmedical science, miserable creatures, born as cretins or idiots;\r\nchildren with hydrocephalus or microcephalus, without eyes or ears, or\r\nwith atrophied genital organs, etc., is an atrocity sanctioned by the\r\nlaw. Would it not be better to allow these miserable beings to be\r\nsuppressed by means of a painless narcosis, with the consent of the\r\nparents and after an expert medical opinion, instead of condemning\r\nthem by law to a life of misery? Science has proved that every\r\ncongenital malformation of the brain is as incurable as that of any\r\nother organ.\r\n\r\nHere again our legislation is fettered by ignorance and religious\r\ndogma. On one hand, immense armies are organized to kill the most\r\nhealthy men by thousands and tens of thousands, and many more\r\nthousands are abandoned to famine, prostitution, alcoholism and\r\nexploitation; on the other hand, medicine is expected to employ its\r\nwhole art and efforts in prolonging life as long as possible and thus\r\nmartyrizing miserable human wretches, degenerate in body and mind or\r\nboth, often when they cry out for death!\r\n\r\nLarge asylums are built for idiots, and there is much joy when after\r\nmany years of persevering effort some devoted person succeeds in\r\nteaching these beings, whose mentality is far inferior to that of a\r\nmonkey, to repeat a few words like a parrot, to scribble some words\r\non paper, or to repeat a prayer mechanically with their eyes turned\r\ntoward heaven!\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to compare these two facts without feeling the bitter\r\nirony of what are euphemistically called our hereditary customs. In\r\ntruth, the nurses and teachers who devote themselves to the education\r\nof cretins and idiots would do better to occupy themselves in some\r\nmanual work; or even leave the idiots to die, and themselves procreate\r\nhealthy and capable children in their place! But this question does\r\nnot properly belong to our subject.\r\n\r\n=The Rights of the Embryo.=--A distinction is generally made between\r\nartificial abortion practiced in the first months of pregnancy and\r\nthat induced in the later months. When the child is born viable, the\r\nterm premature labor is used. When this is induced with the object of\r\ngetting rid of the child the penalty is much more severe than for\r\nabortion, for it is regarded almost as infanticide.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, and owing to the difficulty of the whole question, a\r\nmother should never be given the right to destroy the embryo or child\r\nin her womb, excepting in cases where pregnancy has been forced upon\r\nher. Each case should be submitted to a medical examination, and a\r\ndoctor's certificate should be required. This is all the more\r\nindicated since our present knowledge makes it easy to prevent\r\npregnancy by anticonceptional measures. Society is, therefore,\r\nentitled to demand that a mother who has voluntarily conceived a child\r\nhas no right to interrupt its development, _i.e._, to kill it. If, as\r\nwe hope, we shall eventually obtain more extended rights for women and\r\ngreater sexual liberty in general, even in marriage, the reasons\r\njustifying artificial abortion, apart from medical or hygienic\r\nmeasures, will become more and more rare.\r\n\r\nThe stigma of shame which is branded on illegitimate maternity\r\nunfortunately justifies many cases of abortion and even infanticide.\r\nThings ought to change in this respect, and in the future no pregnancy\r\nought to be a source of shame for any healthy woman whatever, nor\r\nfurnish the least motive for dissimulation.\r\n\r\nIf the objection is raised that I am inconsistent; that every man,\r\nand consequently every woman, should have the power to dispose of\r\ntheir own body on every occasion, and that penal law should therefore\r\ntake no cognizance of artificial abortion, I reply that this does not\r\napply to the case in point; for it is here a question, not of one\r\nbody, but of two or more (in the case of twins). From the moment of\r\nconception the embryo acquires a social right which merits all the\r\nmore protection, the more its possessor is incapable of looking after\r\nit.\r\n\r\n=Adultery.=--Adultery, which even at the present day is often\r\nconsidered as a crime or misdemeanor, should be simply regarded as a\r\nreason for divorce. We have already treated the question with regard\r\nto civil law, and have shown the futility of trying to obtain fidelity\r\nby law. In my opinion, the misdemeanor of adultery should be entirely\r\nabolished from penal law. When it is complicated by fraud or other\r\ncrimes, it is the latter only which are concerned.\r\n\r\n=Human Selection.=--The indirect danger to which children of bad\r\nheredity are exposed constitutes a grave social evil. At present,\r\npenal law is absolutely impotent in this matter. We have seen what\r\ncivil law might perhaps effect, and what is already done in some\r\ncountries. In another chapter we shall discuss much more appropriate\r\nmeasures for improvement in this domain.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned castration and certain cases in which it\r\nmight be practiced. These cases will always be very limited, and it is\r\non the basis of social morality and hygiene of the race that the\r\nquestion of conception should be regulated in a rational and voluntary\r\nmanner. We shall obtain much more in this way than by legal measures,\r\nwhich are always lame because they interfere with individual liberty.\r\nWe must never forget that the law is only a necessary evil, and often\r\na superfluous one.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I may remark that penal law should be combined, like\r\ncivil law, with administrative measures, to protect both the\r\nindividual and society in sexual matters, at the same time watching\r\nover the interests of future generations. But it should only do this\r\nas far as the weakness and eroticism of men hinder a similar or better\r\nresult from being obtained by moral education, combined with rational\r\nintellectual instruction.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] Vide DELBRÜCK, _Gerichtliche Psychopathologie_ (Job.

Her\r\nmother was mild-mannered and sensible, her father loyal, but harsh and\r\nsometimes violent. Frieda was the fifth of eleven brothers and\r\nsisters. She was a model scholar. At the age of four years she had\r\nmeningitis which left her with frequent headaches. In 1896-97 she\r\nlearnt dressmaking and helped at home in the household work. When she\r\nwas free, she did embroidery to help her family. Afterwards she\r\nobtained a situation in a dressmaker's shop at St. Gall, where she got\r\nsixty francs a month.\r\n\r\nTo increase her income she worked on Sundays as a waitress at the Café\r\nde la Poste. The proprietor, a married man, began to persecute her\r\nwith his affections, which she had great difficulty in avoiding. She\r\nthen entered another shop where she got eighty francs a month. One\r\nday, in 1898, when she was then nineteen, the proprietor of the café\r\nsucceeded in seducing her, and on May 27, 1899, she gave birth to a\r\nboy at the Maternity of St. Gall. She had confessed her misfortune to\r\nher parents, and her mother had pity on her. Her mother had also been\r\nseduced and rendered pregnant at the age of fifteen; abandoned by her\r\nseducer she committed infanticide, and was sentenced to six years'\r\nimprisonment; as she had always been well-behaved, the tribunal had\r\nrecognized that she acted \"less by moral depravity than by false\r\nsentiment of honor.\" Frieda, who was fond of her mother, knew nothing\r\nof this history. The father was very hard toward his daughter and\r\nrefused her all help and pity. Twelve days after her confinement she\r\ntook her child to the Foundling Hospital at St. Gall.\r\n\r\nHer seducer then promised to maintain the child, but never paid more\r\nthan eighty francs. After a time he left the town and was seen no\r\nmore. The circumstances under which Frieda became pregnant were not\r\nfully inquired into and her seducer was ignored. It was not absolutely\r\na case of rape, but of taking a poor, weak and timid girl by surprise.\r\n\r\nFrieda Keller felt nothing but disgust for her seducer. Later on the\r\nlatter would no doubt deny the fact of his paternity; but he had\r\ntacitly admitted this by the payment of eighty francs.\r\n\r\nFrieda had to pay five francs a week to the Foundling Hospital and\r\nalso thirty-four francs to her married sister. In 1901 her father\r\ndied, and in 1903 her mother. Frieda inherited 2,471 francs from her\r\nfather, but this sum was tied up in her brother's business and he\r\nnever sent her the interest. It is characteristic of her mentality\r\nthat she never attempted to exact it.\r\n\r\nThen began for this unfortunate young girl a life of struggle and\r\ndespair. She was possessed of two ideas. On the one hand she could no\r\nlonger maintain her child, and on the other hand would not admit\r\nanything from shame. They would not keep the child in the hospital\r\nafter Easter, 1904, when it would reach the maximum age of five years.\r\nWhat was she to do?\r\n\r\nFrieda Keller was then evidently in a pathological state of mind,\r\nwhich was upheld by her defender, Doctor Janggen. She wished to keep\r\nher secret and provide for the maintenance of the child; but she took\r\nno steps in this direction. She did not seek for cheap lodgings, not\r\nfor a rise of salary, nor even for the money illegally detained by her\r\nbrother for his own profit. She never spoke to her married sister, nor\r\nto any one, of her desperate position. The father of her child had\r\ndisappeared and she never gave information against him for fear of\r\ndivulging her secret. Moreover, the law at St. Gall only admitted the\r\ncharge of paternity against unmarried men! She found no practical way\r\nof disposing of her child. After Easter, 1904, when the child was\r\ndischarged from the hospital, she was haunted by a single idea--to get\r\nrid of the child. She struggled for a long time against this\r\nobsession, but in vain, and it finally became a resolution.\r\n\r\nAlthough she was fond of her sister's children, she did not love her\r\nown. She rarely visited her child and appeared to take no notice of\r\nit. This woman who was well-disposed toward every other creature, who\r\nwas of exemplary conduct and would not hurt a fly, never even spoke of\r\nher own child. On April 9th she wrote to the hospital that she would\r\ncome and fetch the child.\r\n\r\nA few days before this she took a long walk in the woods; the next day\r\nshe wept at home, while looking for some string. Alone with her\r\ndespair, she had definitely made her terrible resolution. She said\r\nafterwards, at the assizes:\r\n\r\n\"I could not free myself from the feeling that I must get rid of the\r\nchild.\"\r\n\r\nShe then went to the hospital, after having bought new clothes for the\r\nchild, and told the authorities that an aunt of hers at Munich would\r\ntake care of the child. She then took the child to the woods. Having\r\nfound a lonely spot she sat down for a long time while the child\r\nplayed in the wood. For some time she had not the courage to do the\r\ndeed, but at last an irresistible force, as she said, urged her to do\r\nit. With her hands and shoes she dug a grave, then strangled the child\r\nwith string, with such force that it was difficult to untie the knot\r\non the dead body afterwards. She knelt for some time by the child till\r\nit ceased to give any signs of life, then buried it, and returned home\r\nrestraining her tears with difficulty.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of June she wrote to the hospital that the child had\r\narrived at Munich. On the 7th of June the body was exposed by rain and\r\nwas discovered by some Italians. On the 14th of June she was arrested.\r\nDuring the trial she declared that her action had been the result of\r\nher inability to maintain the child, and the necessity of keeping her\r\nsecret. This secret was the shame and dishonor of involuntary\r\nmaternity and illegitimate birth.\r\n\r\nAll the witnesses spoke in favor of Frieda Keller and gave evidence\r\nthat she was well-mannered, intelligent, hard-working, economical, of\r\nexemplary conduct and loving her sister's children. She did not deny\r\nthe premeditation of her crime, and in no way sought to diminish her\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nAccording to the law of St. Gall, such cases are punishable with\r\ndeath; but Frieda Keller's sentence was commuted to penal servitude\r\nfor life.\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts of this case taken from the official report, and\r\nfrom an extract published by M. de Morsier in the _Signal de Genève_.\r\n\r\nWe are compelled to exclaim with M. de Morsier that a legislation\r\nwhich, in such a case, condemns to death one who can justly be called\r\na victim, while leaving unpunished the real culprit, is calculated to\r\ndestroy all belief in justice in a democracy which calls itself\r\nChristian. It is a justice of barbarians, a disgrace to the twentieth\r\ncentury. The tribunal and the juries have enforced to the letter an\r\narticle in the Code, and this is called justice! We may well say:\r\n_Fiat justitia, pereat mundus._\r\n\r\nFrieda Keller was no doubt in an abnormal condition of mind; she\r\nprobably suffered from the influence of auto-suggestion which became\r\nan obsession. Such cases are not uncommon. This is clearly shown by\r\nthe absurdity of her manner of acting, which was both useless and\r\npernicious, while she might easily have got out of her difficulty in\r\nother ways. If our judges and juries had a little more knowledge of\r\nhuman psychology and a little less of the Code in their heads, they\r\nwould have had some doubts on the mental integrity of the accused, and\r\nwould have ordered an expert examination by a mental specialist. But,\r\napart from this point, I put the question--can we expect from a woman,\r\nmaternal sentiments for a child resulting from sexual surprise\r\nbordering on rape?\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter I have demanded the right of artificial\r\nabortion to women rendered pregnant by rape or against their will, and\r\nI think the case of Frieda Keller supports my contention. I do not\r\nintend to justify the assassination of a child already five years of\r\nage; but I wish to point out that the absence of maternal love is\r\nquite natural in such a case. It is precisely the instinctive aversion\r\nof Frieda Keller for her child, otherwise inexplicable, which shows\r\nmost clearly that it was a case of imposed maternity, or sexual\r\nsatisfaction on the part of the father alone.\r\n\r\nThe tragic case of this unfortunate woman well illustrates the\r\nbrutality and hypocrisy of our customs regarding the sexual question,\r\nand shows what terror, shame, torment and despair may be caused by the\r\npoint of view of the so-called rules of morality. In the presence of\r\nthese facts I do not think I can be accused of exaggeration: it is\r\nonly parchment-hearted jurists and government officials who can remain\r\nindifferent in such cases.\r\n\r\nPenal servitude for life for the poor victim of such cruelty is a kind\r\nof \"mercy\" which rather resembles bitter irony. The law of St. Gall\r\ncan do only one thing to repair the evil; that is to change its laws\r\nand liberate the victim as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary infanticide the true assassin is not usually the mother\r\nwho kills her child, but rather the father who abandons the woman he\r\nhas made pregnant, and disowns the result of his temporary passion. In\r\nthe case of Frieda Keller, maternal heredity, the results of\r\nmeningitis, stupidity, irreflection, want, shame, fear, a pathological\r\nobsession, and finally the unworthy conduct of the father, all\r\ncombined in making this unfortunate girl a victim rather than a\r\ncriminal. Her child was not only a source of great anxiety but also an\r\nobject of instinctive repulsion.\r\n\r\nHow is it that such a brave and industrious woman can feel repulsion\r\ntoward her own child? If the judges had asked themselves this question\r\nand had replied to it without prejudice, forgetting for the moment\r\ntheir Code and prejudices, they would not have had the courage to\r\ncondemn the woman to death, nor even to condemn her at all; for their\r\nconscience would have clearly shown them the true culprits--masculine\r\nbrutality, our hypocritical sexual customs, and the unjust laws\r\ninspiring terror in a feeble brain.\r\n\r\nWhen every pregnancy and every birth are looked upon by human society\r\nwith honor and respect, when every mother is protected by law and\r\nassisted in the education of her children, then only will society have\r\nthe right to judge severely of infanticide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nMEDICINE AND SEXUAL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n=General Remarks.=--Theology teaches belief in God and a future life;\r\nlaw represents the application of codified laws and customs, old and\r\nnew; medicine is said to be an art--the art of curing sick people.\r\n\r\nAt the origin of each of these three branches of human activity we\r\nfind an acquired idea. Man has been led to the religious idea and to\r\nthe worship of one or more gods by his terror of certain unknown and\r\noccult powers superior to his own, and by the idea that his faculty of\r\nknowledge, his power, and the duration of his life were limited.\r\n\r\nThe origin of law is in moral conscience, a phylogenetic derivative of\r\nthe sentiments of sympathy, _i.e._, sentiments of duty and justice,\r\ncombined with the idea of the necessity for men to live in societies.\r\n\r\nAs regards medicine, this owes its existence to the fear of disease,\r\npain and death, which is modified by the acquired experience that\r\ncertain substances may sometimes ease suffering.\r\n\r\nTheology, if separated from morality whose domain it has usurped,\r\nlives on mysticism, and endeavors to give it a natural and human\r\nappearance by adorning it with sonorous phraseology. Law, losing sight\r\nof its origin and object of existence, only concerns itself with\r\ncomments on the text of laws, and in discussing the application of the\r\narticles of the Code. Medicine has concerned itself too much with the\r\nlife of the patient, instead of the improvement of human life in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nIn order to cure a physical malady, to reëstablish abnormal or damaged\r\nfunctions as far as this is possible, the physician must be acquainted\r\nwith the vital manifestations of the body in its normal state. For\r\nthis reason the art of medicine depends on the accessory sciences,\r\nchiefly anatomy and physiology. These accessory sciences have\r\nconsiderably developed in the evolution of medicine, and the art of\r\nmedicine has become the chief motive power which urges men to research\r\nand discovery in the biological sciences, such as histology,\r\nembryology, comparative anatomy and physiology, anatomy and physiology\r\nof the brain, bacteriology, etc. Pure science now occupies such a\r\nposition in medical studies that the \"healing art\" often remains in\r\nthe background; although it must later on take the chief part, and is\r\nregarded by the public as of the greatest importance.\r\n\r\nThe value of the art of medicine is subject to great variations. It is\r\nonly of real value when, free from all charlatanism, it rests on a\r\nsufficiently scientific basis; for the art of an ignoramus falls into\r\nerror and employs inappropriate methods; on the other hand, the art of\r\na charlatan has for its object the purse of the patient. It is common\r\nto meet with physicians who have a good practical experience of art\r\nwithout possessing scientific knowledge, others who have both\r\npractical experience and science but are charlatans, others again who\r\nare very scientific but incapable in practice. The ideal is a\r\ncombination of art, science and disinterested honesty; but it is not\r\nvery uncommon to meet with a combination of ignorance, incapacity and\r\ncharlatanism. Lastly, too many doctors, otherwise capable and\r\nintelligent, are too much influenced by authority, text-books and\r\nprejudices, instead of observing and judging each case for themselves\r\nin the true scientific spirit. Many dogmas of medical education rest\r\non hypotheses, theories or statements which have no solid foundation,\r\nand do not represent the fruits of a true personal experience of human\r\nlife. Many doctors only see through other people's glasses, without\r\nreflecting for themselves; the worst of these are those with\r\n\"systems,\" homoeopaths, the disciples of natural medicine, etc. It\r\nis especially in the sexual question that these human weaknesses of\r\nmedical practitioners often lead to the most pitiable results.\r\n\r\nWe must first of all take to heart the fundamental principle of\r\nhygiene, which is at the same time that of all honest and sound\r\nmedicine--_prevention is better than cure._\r\n\r\nThe modern opinions of medical men on the sexual question are still\r\nunfortunately greatly obscured by prejudice, authority, and the\r\nindirect influence of the doctrines of religious morality. The same\r\napplies to the question of alcohol. However, it is to medicine and its\r\naccessory sciences that we owe the knowledge which now renders it\r\npossible to judge of the sexual relations of man from the true and\r\nhealthy point of view of social and moral science.\r\n\r\nWe cannot describe here all the relations of medicine to sexual life.\r\nChapters I, II, III, IV and VIII are entirely based on its results and\r\non those of natural science. What we have still to consider relates\r\nespecially to sexual hygiene, for we have already treated of pathology\r\nin Chapter VIII. I shall reserve the general and social part of\r\nhygiene for the last chapter of the book, and shall confine myself\r\nhere to certain special points, and the criticism of current, but\r\nerroneous, medical opinions on the sexual question.\r\n\r\n=Prostitution. Sexual Hygiene. Sexual Connection Apart from\r\nMarriage.=--All regulation and medical supervision of prostitution\r\nshould be rejected, not only from the moral point of view, but also\r\nfrom that of hygiene, as a deplorable error, incapable even of\r\nfulfilling its avowed object--protection against venereal disease.\r\n\r\nFaith in the dogmas and authority of an existing institution has led\r\nmedical men to take a false view of the question. They demand from the\r\nadversaries of regulation proof of a diminution in venereal disease\r\nwhen regulation was not in force. This is both unjust and absurd. It\r\nis for the supporters of regulation to prove that State regulation of\r\nprostitution has led to any appreciable improvement of the social\r\nevil. Then only can it be asked if the maintenance of such vexatious\r\nmeasures is still justifiable. But medicine has not furnished the\r\nproof demanded from it; on the contrary, its attempts in this\r\ndirection have entirely failed. After all, the system is kept up, not\r\nbecause it diminishes venereal infection, but because it gives\r\nsatisfaction to the sexual appetite of men and their desire for\r\nchange. Society, however, has no right to organize such a monstrosity\r\nas regulated prostitution and licensed proxenetism, for the special\r\npleasure of debauchees.\r\n\r\nIn virtue of the false dogma of regulation, many doctors, even at the\r\npresent day, recommend young men to visit brothels, for alleged\r\nhygienic reasons. This deplorable custom perverts youth and gives it\r\nfalse ideas. It is a remedy much worse and much more dangerous than\r\nthe evil it is supposed to cure, worse than masturbation, much worse\r\nthan nocturnal emissions. Sexual anomalies and perversions are not\r\ncured in brothels; on the contrary they develop there.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is absurd to exaggerate the effects of onanism and sexual\r\nexcesses in themselves, and thus increase the anxiety of a number of\r\nunfortunates. In Chapter IV, we have already spoken of great\r\nvariations which the sexual appetite presents without ceasing to be\r\nnormal, and we have mentioned the rule given by Luther. In my opinion\r\nthe advice given by the doctor should be as follows:\r\n\r\nAs long as he does not wish to marry, a young man should remove as far\r\nas possible all sexual ideas from his thoughts. He should be contented\r\nwith nocturnal emissions, which are produced spontaneously, and should\r\navoid all the manipulations of onanism. A young girl should do the\r\nsame all the more easily, because her sexual appetite is normally\r\nweaker, and is not accompanied by glandular secretions which more or\r\nless demand ejaculation.\r\n\r\nPersons unable to resist their sexual appetite should be extremely\r\nprudent in their extra-nuptial intercourse. Moreover, there is no need\r\nfor this to assume the character of prostitution.\r\n\r\n=Medical Advice.=--It is the doctor's duty to give friendly advice to\r\nevery one who consults him on sexual questions, without posing as a\r\njudge or a moralist. He should never frighten or reprimand the poor\r\nhypochondriac who blames himself for masturbation, nor sexual perverts\r\nof any kind, unless, of course, they are absolutely dangerous, such as\r\nsadists. He should, on the contrary, calm their fears and give them\r\nencouragement; and in this way he may do much good.\r\n\r\nHypnotic suggestion gives him a means of directly combating many cases\r\nof sexual excitation, or at least of attenuating them, by directing\r\nthe cerebral activity of the patient to other subjects. Each case\r\nshould be judged by itself and attention should be paid to the\r\ndifferent points we have studied in this book. Even between husband\r\nand wife, and especially as a consequence of monogamy, certain\r\nunfortunate or delicate circumstances may raise difficulties; for\r\nexample, the periods during which conception should be avoided, a\r\ncertain time after accouchement and during certain morbid conditions.\r\n\r\nIn this case unskillful medical advice may have unfortunate results.\r\nWhen a doctor forbids a husband to have sexual intercourse with his\r\nwife he exposes him to two dangers. If the husband remains continent\r\nand sleeps in a separate room for too long a time, conjugal love may\r\nbecome so cooled that a permanent barrier is established between man\r\nand wife; if, on the other hand, he abandons himself to prostitution,\r\nhe may contract venereal disease and infect his wife. Again, the\r\nhusband may become enamored of another woman and wreck the happiness\r\nof his family. The doctor who prohibits conjugal coitus thus takes a\r\ngreat responsibility. For this and other reasons we have now an\r\nimportant question to consider.\r\n\r\nOpinions differ considerably as to the effects of sexual continence.\r\nAll extreme assertions are erroneous. It is quite certain that the\r\nharmful effects of continence have been greatly exaggerated. Normal\r\npersons of both sexes may remain continent, although not without some\r\ntrouble and discomfort. In a general way, we may accept the statement\r\nthat many morbid conditions are known to result from sexual excess,\r\nbut few from continence. This, however, goes a little too far, for\r\ncertain psychopaths and sexual hyperæsthetics often lapse into a state\r\nof mental and nervous excitement from forced continence, so that their\r\nneurosis becomes accentuated and may even end in insanity. I have seen\r\nthis occur both in men and women, but such cases are very rare.\r\n\r\nContinence is not an easy matter for erotic individuals, and requires\r\na heroic internal struggle, especially in men. The Canadian reformer,\r\nChiniqui, whom we have previously quoted, relates the history of a\r\nmonk who tore off his testicles in despair at being unable to conquer\r\nhis violent sexual appetite.\r\n\r\nThe fine preachers of morality, endowed with a cold temperament, or\r\nsimply senile, who hold forth on the \"immorality\" of the consequences\r\nof the sexual appetite, would do well to take such facts to heart.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget that among our brutal, yet human ancestors the\r\nstruggle for life demanded the cruel and wanton exposure or slaughter\r\nof all weak and decrepit individuals, and that epidemic diseases,\r\nplagues, and pests ravaged the peoples without mercy. Of course our\r\npresent civilization has put up a barrier against all this. Yet, for\r\nthat very reason the blind and thoughtless propagation of degenerate,\r\ntainted, and enfeebled individuals is another atrocious danger to\r\nsociety. But then the sexual appetite cannot be legislated out of\r\nexistence or killed by repressive measures.\r\n\r\nQuite recently it has been scientifically demonstrated that absolute\r\nsterilization can be produced by the application of the Roentgen Ray,\r\nbut at what period of treatment this result may be obtained still\r\nremains an unsettled question, thus leaving the possibility of\r\nincurring the risk of effecting only a doubtful degeneration of the\r\ngerms.\r\n\r\nWe can but consider all legislation and all police measures which are\r\nintended to regulate the sexual intercourse in the human family, as\r\nabsolute failures, as inhuman, in fact as down-right detrimental to\r\nthe race. Exacting laws have never improved the morals of any race or\r\nnation; hypocrisy and secret evasion are the only results obtained. It\r\nwould be better by far if steps were taken to enlighten the masses on\r\nthe questions of sexual heredity and degeneration. Wisdom of this kind\r\ndoes not corrupt. It is rather the unrestricted power of capital and\r\nwealth that brings the rot into the community. Healthy people should\r\nbe made to know that a large number of sound, industrious children is\r\na blessing, in fact, riches to the family, but on the one condition\r\nonly, viz.: that they are not relegated to detestable slavery through\r\nthe overbearing suppression of capital.\r\n\r\nWhen the dignity of labor shall once have been raised on the pedestal\r\nof worship now occupied by Mammon, there will no longer be need for\r\ncomplaint about small families and decreasing birth-rates, such as we\r\nhear so much at the present day in France and in the United States.\r\n\r\nA few examples might throw some light on this subject.\r\n\r\n(1) Dr. Pelman of Bonn, assisted by the local authorities, made an\r\ninquiry into the progeny of a certain Ada Jurke (born in 1740, died in\r\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century), who was hereditarily\r\ntainted, a drunkard and a degenerate. Her descendants down to the\r\npresent time number 834 persons. The lives of 709 of these individuals\r\nhave been officially recorded as follows: 106 were illegitimate\r\nchildren; 142 were mendicants and tramps; 64 were unable to perform\r\nany kind of work towards their own support and became a charge to the\r\ncommunity; 181 of the women were prostitutes; 7 persons were convicted\r\nof murder and 69 of other crimes. All this within a period of 75 years\r\nat a cost to the state, according to the public records, of five\r\nmillions of marks (about $1,250,000) in the shape of monetary support,\r\njail and law expenses, claims for damages, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n(2) Dr. Jörger, Director of the Insane Asylum at Waldhaus, by Chur, in\r\nSwitzerland, followed up in a similar fashion the history of a family\r\nof vagrants. The full report may be found under the title of \"The Zero\r\nFamily,\" in the _Archiv für Gesellschaft's-u. Rassenbiologie_, 1905,\r\nHeft 4, page 494 et seq. It is sad to read of the untold misery,\r\nprofligacy, and distress spread broadcast by this family, not to speak\r\nof the many crimes committed by its members.\r\n\r\nIt is depressing to witness how sheer ignorance and callousness to the\r\ninterests of the human race at large allow such people to multiply\r\nwithout let or hindrance. The unfortunate part about it all is that\r\nthis species of humanity is on the steady increase. They really form\r\nthe principal hearths whence emanate our criminal classes, that fill\r\nour jails, our Charity Homes, our Hospitals, our Sanatoria, our Insane\r\nAsylums. They breed and multiply not because it affords them a special\r\npleasure to procreate crime, insanity, and degeneracy, but because no\r\none takes the trouble to instruct them in the perniciousness of\r\nbringing into this world offspring that can only find and themselves\r\nagain disseminate misery, want, and wretchedness; or to teach them how\r\nto prevent this calamity.\r\n\r\n(3) Still another category of dangerous elements is becoming more\r\nnumerous every day. I refer to the _neurasthenics_. Heredity is an\r\nimportant factor here, too, as every neurologist is able to attest\r\nfrom his own daily observations. The worst feature about this peril is\r\nthe fact that neurotics as a rule suffer from excess of sexual\r\nappetite, whilst they are sorely lacking the power of self-control,\r\ncircumstances which often enough lead to crime, insanity, and suicide.\r\nUntold thousands of them, unaware of the fearful consequences of\r\nhereditary impairment, go on bringing into this world children\r\ndestined to unhappiness and suffering. It is noteworthy too that these\r\nnervous wrecks generally intermarry. Does not this account to a large\r\nextent for the great number of unhappy marriages recorded nowadays?\r\n\r\nOf course, it is quite evident that under such pitiable conditions,\r\nthe hereditary taints become increasingly aggravated. If the patients\r\nhave money, which is very often the case, they prove profitable\r\ncustomers of the \"nerve-specialist,\" and likewise of the endless chain\r\nof private sanatoria for nervous diseases. It is a sad spectacle\r\nindeed. My own experience has taught me that nine out of ten of these\r\nunfortunate beings have families, because they are ignorant of the\r\ndangers of heredity, and unfamiliar with the safe and proper means for\r\npreventing conception. Why not teach them? A few cases may suffice.\r\n\r\n(_a_) An hysterical woman, whose father was a lascivious, egotistical\r\ncrank, married a man absolutely devoid of will power and energy. She\r\nwas gifted; the marriage a failure. Of the two children, one was an\r\nindolent, thoroughly useless, good-for-nothing boy, whose only thought\r\nwas of wasting money on pretty neckties and the like and of flirting\r\nwith the girls, of which art he was a past-master. The other one, a\r\ngirl, betrayed the same characteristics and disposition. The mother\r\nwas in despair and inconsolable, cursing her offspring and the\r\nmarriage alike. Too late, alas!\r\n\r\n(_b_) The son of a neurasthenic father and an hysterical mother,\r\nalthough of a good-natured disposition, had the vilest, uncontrolable\r\ntemper, which would suddenly carry him away to acts of violence only\r\nto be bitterly regretted immediately afterwards. Whilst drunk he\r\nbecame excited and drawing a revolver wounded several innocent\r\nbystanders. As an officer in the army he was insulted by a tipsy\r\nstudent, whom he shot down on the spot, although he was sober himself\r\nat the time. On another occasion he shot himself in the breast, but\r\nrecovered. Presently he fell in love most desperately with an\r\nhysterical woman and married her. The mother-in-law, who was an\r\neccentric, mischievous person, started a bitter feud between the two\r\nfamilies. He became greatly wrought up over the affair and demanded of\r\nhis wife to stop the quarrel at once. As she demurred, he ended her\r\nlife with a bullet from a pistol. Of course, he was arrested and\r\nlanguished in jail in utter agony and despair. What a future for those\r\ntwo unfortunate children that sprang from this union! I may point out\r\nhere that at the time when he killed his wife, whom he loved\r\npassionately, he was not under the influence of strong drink, for he\r\nhad given up the use of alcohol altogether for quite a number of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n(_c_) A very religious lady had married a man who became insane. He,\r\ntoo, was a devout churchman. There were 8 children. Under treatment\r\nthe father improved and was dismissed from the asylum. I urged them\r\nboth to prevent further conception, having in view the dangers of\r\nhereditary taint in the possible offspring. The wife indignantly told\r\nme that her church demanded of her to bear as many children as she\r\ncould. They had several more, all of them candidates for the insane\r\nasylum or the institute for nervous patients. And that is called\r\nreligion and morality!\r\n\r\n(_d_) A heavily tainted couple, desperately enamored of each other,\r\ncame to me in great distress to ask: \"May we get married?\" I answered:\r\n\"It does not strike me as being the wisest thing for you to do. But if\r\nyou cannot exist without each other, by all means get married; but\r\nthink what a calamity it would be, if two beings tainted as you both\r\nare, were to beget offspring.\" \"But we are so fond of children.\"\r\n\"Well, that is easily mended. There are plenty of healthy orphans\r\nwhose parents were strong and sound both in body and in mind, but who\r\nare strangers to a father's and mother's love, and are craving for a\r\ngood education. Make your own choice, but take only the very best.\r\nThen you will have a family and enjoy all the pleasures of parenthood.\r\nAs for the rest, heed my advice. Avoid pregnancy.\"\r\n\r\nThe law of heredity winds like a red thread through the family history\r\nof every criminal, of every epileptic, eccentric and insane person.\r\nAnd we should sit still and witness our civilization go into decay and\r\nfall to pieces without raising the cry of warning and applying the\r\nremedy?\r\n\r\nHowever, this is by no means all. Tuberculosis is the white plague of\r\nto-day. It is considered an established fact that every living human\r\nbeing inhales and swallows tubercle bacilli by the millions every day,\r\nand it is even claimed that every one of us harbors somewhere in the\r\neconomy this dreadful poison to a larger or smaller degree. Whilst the\r\npure, immune blood in a sound, robust constitution is able to resist\r\nthe inroads of, and even to kill, sterilize, and eliminate these\r\nbacilli, the weaker and hereditarily tainted individual falls a prey\r\nto the attacks of this dire disease by the thousands. True, serum\r\ntherapy and open-air treatment are accomplishing many cures, but the\r\nhereditary disposition remains in the system all the same, and may be\r\ntransmitted to the coming generation, or at any rate may impair the\r\npower of resistance in the offspring.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the sexual appetite is very pronounced in phthisical\r\npatients. They marry and beget children in the most wanton fashion.\r\nThe law cannot and does not prevent them, and the carnal instinct is\r\nnot to be killed. What is to be done when law and religion forbid the\r\napplication of preventive measures and even prosecute the person that\r\nrecommends them?\r\n\r\nLocal disease and pathological conditions in the woman (at times in\r\nman also), within wedlock, may render parturition an immediate danger\r\nto the life of the mother or of the child or of both together, for\r\ninstance, cancer of the womb or other affections of the uterus, kidney\r\ndisease, a deformed pelvis. Surely in such cases it is the bounden\r\nduty of the physician to intervene and council against, nay,\r\nabsolutely forbid impregnation. Well, how is it to be done? Must\r\nhusband and wife, who love and esteem each other, be separated? It\r\nwould be unnatural, in fact it is quite impossible. Or should they\r\nabandon sexual intercourse all together and live like brother and\r\nsister? Well, a few exceptionally cold natures may have will power\r\nenough to carry into effect such a pact. But in 99 out of 100 cases\r\nthe interdict of the sexual act sends the husband to satisfy his\r\ncravings elsewhere and contract disease, or he falls in love with\r\nanother woman and wrecks home and family.\r\n\r\nSimilar conditions may be brought about by other causes as well. Take,\r\nfor instance, the poor workingman or mechanic who has already six or\r\nseven children and whose wife is unusually fertile, giving birth to\r\nchildren year after year. The wages of the father do not suffice to\r\nproperly support them all. The food that can be purchased with the\r\nslender means is not at all adequate. Rent and other bills fall behind\r\nand the man gets in debt. They are both young yet. What is to be done?\r\nIf they follow the natural law there will be an increase in the family\r\nevery year. Moreover, these ever-recurring labors weaken the\r\nconstitution of the woman and sap away her strength. Starvation?\r\nSexual continence in wedlock? It is strange, indeed, to hear rich men,\r\nwell-fed clergymen, pious zealots and reformers, leaning back in their\r\ncomfortable chairs after a sumptuous meal and smoking an expensive\r\nHavana cigar, discuss this burning question and bewail the immorality\r\nof the common people.\r\n\r\nStatistics prove that these very people, who extol to the poor all the\r\nblessing of a big family, never live up to their teachings either in\r\ntheory or in practice. The majority of these apostles of morality have\r\nno children at all, or at the utmost two or three. Why should that be\r\nso? What interesting reading it would make if the sexual history of\r\nthese persons were followed up and printed.\r\n\r\nMoney, hygiene, reason, and the most elementary laws of humanity\r\ndemand that the wife, who is fertile above the average, should have a\r\nrest of at least 18 months between each succeeding pregnancy. But this\r\ncannot be achieved in the natural course of events, except in very\r\nrare cases, without wrecking the marriage.\r\n\r\nIf we crystallize this sexual, social question, we arrive at the\r\nfollowing conclusions:\r\n\r\nThere are a great many cases, especially of a pathological character,\r\nbut none the less also in normal and sound individuals, in which\r\nprocreation, within wedlock or without, is dangerous either definitely\r\nor temporarily, either for the mother or the child, or for both, and\r\nfor that reason should be interdicted. Very few men and a very small\r\nproportion of women--no matter how firmly they may be resolved--are\r\ncapable of effectually suppressing their sexual needs. And even if\r\nthey succeed, the consequences are generally of a disastrous nature,\r\nloss of marital love, secret illicit relations with others and\r\nsubsequent infidelity, nervous disorders, impotence, etc.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases we are confronted with the following dilemma:\r\n\r\n(1) In the unmarried person: onanism or prostitution, or both. Is that\r\nmorality? Such people must either forever forego love, marriage, and\r\nnormal, lawful sexual intercourse, or face sterility in wedded life.\r\n(I do not recognize prostitution--see chapter X--as normal\r\nintercourse.)\r\n\r\n(2) Within marriage: onanism, prostitution, and infidelity, or the\r\nadoption of rational preventive measures.\r\n\r\nI leave it to the reader and to the lawmakers to pick out the correct\r\nalternative and to arrive at the one possible, decent, and ethical\r\nsolution of these conflicting questions.\r\n\r\nI do not admit that constitutionally frigid natures or those who find\r\nit easy to control their sexual appetite, have any right whatsoever to\r\npose as normal samples of the human race and to simply ignore the\r\nexistence of temperaments, characters, and constitutions so widely\r\ndiffering from their own. This world's history teaches us that nothing\r\ngood has ever come from such vain assumptions, unless it be empty\r\nphrases and dead letters. These righteous, frigid, and strong natures\r\nought, indeed, to be grateful to their ancestors for having handed\r\ndown to them that happy disposition, and to prove their gratitude by\r\nmaking particular efforts to help those that are yet to come, in\r\nobtaining and sharing the same benign blessing.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost incredible that in some countries medical men who are\r\nnot ashamed to throw young men into the arms of prostitution, blush\r\nwhen mention is made of anticonceptional methods. This false modesty,\r\ncreated by custom and prejudice, waxes indignant at innocent things,\r\nwhilst it encourages the greatest infamies.\r\n\r\n=Hygiene of Marriage.=--When marriage is consummated on the basis of\r\nfree reciprocal consent, when both parties know exactly to what they\r\nhave pledged themselves, when the corrupting influence of money is\r\neliminated, when all unnatural regulation is suppressed, when the\r\nsuperfluous blending of religion and legislation have been abolished\r\nfrom the bonds of matrimony, when woman has finally obtained equal\r\nrights with man--then love and mutual respect, combined with the\r\nsexual appetite, will constitute the intimate and personal ties of\r\nmarriage. At the same time, instinctive sentiments and legal duties\r\ntoward the offspring will furnish it with a complementary and lasting\r\ncement. Among men whose nature is true, the instructive sentiment of\r\naltruism or conscience urges them to the performance of social duties\r\nwithout the necessity of any legal obligation.\r\n\r\nA few medical points now require our attention. The husband should be\r\nolder than the wife, on the average from six to twelve years. This\r\npoint is very important if a monogamous union is to be lasting. Woman\r\nmatures earlier than man, both mentally and sexually; her personality\r\nbecomes more rapidly adult than his; she ages more quickly and loses\r\nher faculty of procreation sooner than man. Certain savage races solve\r\nthe problem by marrying as boys and girls, casting off their wives\r\nwhen they grow old, to marry younger ones. Among civilized races, man\r\nmanages his affairs by making use of prostitution. From his youth he\r\nsuccumbs to physical and moral corruption, often complicated with\r\nvenereal infection, and then often regards marriage as a kind of\r\nhospital for incurables, where the wife plays the parts of housekeeper\r\nand nurse combined!\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to steer clear of these rocks, nor to formulate a rule\r\nfor lasting monogamy. The old style of polygamy is brutal, and\r\nprostitution is still more disgusting. The sentiments of the egoist\r\nare summed up in the maxim, \"After me the deluge!\" To this the\r\npreacher of morals replies that \"man should curb his passions.\" But\r\nthis eternal dialogue does not help us in the least.\r\n\r\nI propose a middle course, as follows: The young man who possesses\r\nsufficient strength to overcome his sexual appetite, or whose sexual\r\nappetite is so moderate that he can remain continent till the age of\r\nabout twenty-five years, so as to enable him to avoid prostitution,\r\npromiscuous sexual intercourse or masturbation--this young man, I\r\nmaintain, has the best chance of gaining the first prize in life. If\r\nhe is free from prejudice and is not afraid of using anticonceptional\r\nmeasures for a certain time, he may then marry a young girl, to whom\r\nhe may become permanently attached, if their two characters suit each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nA young girl may very well marry at seventeen or eighteen, or at any\r\nrate between eighteen and nineteen. She is then sexually mature and\r\nher mentality is sufficiently developed, so that the difference in age\r\nwe have required may be obtained. Young people thus united may\r\ncontinue their studies before procreating children, and their marriage\r\nwill stimulate them to work.\r\n\r\nWhen the intoxication of the honeymoon is over, the continuance of\r\nconjugal happiness depends on an intimate adaptation of the two\r\nconjoints in sentiments, intelligence and sexual appetite; an\r\nadaptation which purifies love on both sides. Work in common, a common\r\nideal, mutual respect full of affection but free from flattery, and a\r\nreciprocal education which does not degenerate into pedantry nor\r\ntyranny, are the principal conditions for conjugal happiness.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely necessary to avoid everything which causes reparation\r\nor exclusion, even in appearance. At the risk of appearing ridiculous\r\nin the eyes of certain superior persons, I repeat that separation of\r\nbeds and bedrooms is a dangerous experiment to make in marriage, and\r\nthat it may easily lead to estrangement, even when based on the\r\nhighest motives.\r\n\r\nIt is the same, in a still higher degree, with sexual continence in\r\nmarriage, even when it does not last for years, excepting in cases of\r\ngrave disease or senile impotence.\r\n\r\nIt is often stated that a woman should avoid coitus for long periods,\r\nbecause among certain savage races the husband does not cohabit with\r\nher during pregnancy and the two years of nursing which follow it; the\r\nwoman being considered by religion as \"impure\" during this period. But\r\nthis proves nothing, for this custom only concerns polygamists, who\r\nmake up for it with other women. If our monogamous marriage is to be\r\nnatural, and not satisfied with words and illusions, it is necessary\r\nfor sexual intercourse to be intimate and constant, and it should only\r\nbe interrupted for short intervals, corresponding to the natural\r\nwants of the two conjoints, adapted to each other by mutual\r\nconcessions.\r\n\r\nApart from this, menstruation and accouchement constitute the only\r\nexceptions based on physiology. According to Grüber (_Hygiene des\r\nGeschlechtslebens_) accouchement requires an interruption of at least\r\nfour weeks; I should say at least six weeks. Every husband, with the\r\npossible exception of the most horrible satyrs, can submit to this\r\nwithout much discomfort. Pregnancy, on the contrary, does not require\r\ncontinence, provided the husband takes account of his wife's condition\r\nand treats her with care.\r\n\r\nDuring the last months of pregnancy all violent movements and pressure\r\non the abdomen should be avoided during coitus, so as not to injure\r\nthe embryo. This may be effected by coitus in the lateral position.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pinard of Paris advises the prohibition of coitus during the\r\nlatter part of pregnancy, because it may lead to premature birth. As\r\nregards accouchement at the seventh, eighth or even at the beginning\r\nof the ninth month, this might, it is true, be proved by figures, but\r\nat this time the embryo is sufficiently protected, and with the\r\nprecautions indicated above, I consider the danger as nil. As regards\r\nthe end of the ninth month, the margin of errors as to the movement of\r\nconception and the signs of birth at term hardly allow of statistics\r\nwhich exclude subjectivism, and the danger becomes less and less. In\r\nany case a conscientious husband would run no risks under these\r\ncircumstances if he was aware of the danger.\r\n\r\nWhat is more important for the wife is that she should have sufficient\r\nrest between her pregnancies. A year at least should elapse between\r\nparturition and the next conception; this gives approximately two\r\nyears between the confinements. This is easily managed by the aid of\r\nthe preventive animal membranes we have mentioned. In this way the\r\nwife keeps in good health and can bear healthy children at pleasure.\r\nIt is certainly better to procreate seven healthy children, than to\r\nprocreate fourteen of which seven die, to say nothing of the mother\r\nwho rapidly becomes exhausted by uninterrupted confinements.\r\n\r\nNo rule can be given for the frequency of sexual connection in\r\nmarriage; this is a matter for reciprocal arrangement. Luther's rule\r\nof two or three times a week may be considered a normal average for\r\nvirile persons of good constitution.\r\n\r\nWomen who are sexually cold and fond of children, but who have a\r\nhorror of coitus, cannot, in my opinion, be regarded as types of the\r\nnormal wife, nor can they expect their husbands to abstain from all\r\ncoitus except that intended for procreation. On the other hand, the\r\nwife should certainly be made acquainted with the nature of sexual\r\nintercourse and its consequences before marriage. Further, before\r\nengaging in a life-long union, a man and woman ought to explain to\r\neach other their sexual feelings so as to avoid deception and\r\nincompatibility later on.\r\n\r\nWithout having ever experienced a sexual orgasm, either by coitus or\r\nby masturbation, a normal young girl, when she is sufficiently\r\ninstructed in sexual matters, may easily decide whether the idea of\r\ncoitus with a man for whom she feels affection is repugnant or\r\nattractive to her. In the case of young men it is still easier.\r\n\r\nA woman who had received a complete medical education and had remained\r\na virgin, but who was well-informed on sexual life, gave me very\r\nprecise information on this subject. For a long time the idea of\r\ncoitus with men was repugnant to her, till she made the acquaintance\r\nof the one who gained her affections. Repugnance was then replaced by\r\ndesire. This case also gives a good example of the monogamous sexual\r\nfeeling of the normal woman.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XVII we shall discuss the manner in which youth should be\r\ninitiated into the sexual question. Our present formality, combined\r\nwith general ignorance of girls on sexual matters, renders a mutual\r\nunderstanding prior to definite betrothal generally impossible.\r\nMoreover, there is a sort of hysterical and pathological love, the\r\nproduct of the imagination, which is associated with sentimental words\r\nand sighs as well as coquetry, but transformed into disgust or hatred\r\nby the first coitus. Although more common in women this false love is\r\nmet with in hysterical men. Sometimes the illusion disappears while\r\nthere is yet time to break off the betrothal. Marriage by trial and\r\nhas been attempted by some, but with varied success.\r\n\r\nFor a number of reasons, both parties should be medically examined\r\nbefore marriage. This precaution may reveal the presence of a narrow\r\npelvis or vaginismus in the woman, or aspermia, venereal disease,\r\netc., in the man.\r\n\r\nWhen a woman will only support coitus with a view to procreation, she\r\nwould do well if she informed her _fiancé_, who can then consider\r\nwhether he can submit to such restriction. If the wife will not allow\r\nher husband a concubine it generally results in clandestine\r\nextra-nuptial relations and subsequent divorce proceedings.\r\n\r\nMy opinion on this subject will no doubt appear very immoral to many\r\npeople, but it is natural and rational. It is needless to say that I\r\ndo not intend that a man has the right to compel his wife to have\r\nintercourse whenever he pleases. The question is a very delicate one;\r\nbut, by the aid of goodwill a satisfactory solution of the problem can\r\nbe obtained in most cases, in the manner indicated above. Love and\r\nmutual respect will always find a way out of the difficulty. It is\r\nnecessary to avoid extreme asceticism and unnatural idealism on the\r\none hand and excessive sexual indulgence on the other hand. In the\r\nsexual question above all others it is the wisest course to strike a\r\nhappy medium.\r\n\r\nAn extremely important question is that of the procreation of\r\nchildren. We have just explained how this can be regulated at will; we\r\nhave now to consider how children of the best quality can be\r\nprocreated.\r\n\r\nThe first condition is the good quality of the parents. Their heredity\r\nor the intellectual and physical value of their ancestry is of\r\nparamount importance. We must take into consideration, not only the\r\nintelligence and physical health, but also good sentiments, a\r\nconscientious character and energy of will. What is the use of\r\nprocreating healthy and robust children if they are vain, egoistic,\r\nimpulsive, crafty, wanting in will power, or perhaps criminal? Such\r\nindividuals constitute a social plague.\r\n\r\nAt the time of conception the parents should not be in a condition of\r\nacute or chronic alcoholism, nor affected with any disease; otherwise\r\nthe progeny may be tainted by _blastophthoria_ (Chapter I).\r\n\r\nThe age of the procreators should also be taken into account. Children\r\nborn of parents advanced in years are generally feeble.\r\n\r\nThe fatal error which causes the procreation of children to depend on\r\npecuniary reasons and interests is a social misfortune. Healthy men\r\nand women ought never to avoid reproduction, even when they are poor.\r\nProgeny of good quality grow up, so to speak, by themselves. Progeny\r\nwith evil instincts, or decadent, have a pre-existing hereditary\r\ntaint, or have been affected by blastophthoria in some other way.\r\n\r\nNo doubt acquired diseases or accidents may make an invalid of a child\r\nor a man, but these are exceptions which prove the rule, for here\r\nagain the descendant of healthy parents is more resistant than others,\r\nif he has not artificially altered his state of health and power of\r\nresistance by alcohol or venereal disease.\r\n\r\nAmong savages, and at the present day among many peasants, children\r\nare rather an advantage than a burden, because these people have\r\nsimple and healthy habits and few wants. It is our artificial and\r\nunhealthy desire for luxury, frivolity, comfort and enjoyment, our\r\nmuscular weakness resulting from want of exercise, our exaggerated\r\nterror of diseases and microbes, in a word our effeminacy, which makes\r\nus so incapable of rearing large families simply and cheaply. No doubt\r\nit becomes more and more necessary to give children a good education,\r\nand this necessity complicates the question. But, in my opinion this\r\neducation will in the future be conducted by the State.\r\n\r\n=Hygiene of Pregnancy.=--This subject is too special to be fully dealt\r\nwith here. We may, however, mention that idleness and overwork are\r\nequally detrimental to the pregnant woman and her child. It is\r\nneedless to say that every pregnant woman requires care and good food.\r\nViolent efforts, especially in the upright position, should be avoided\r\n(vide Bachimont: _La Puericulture intra-uterine_, 1898, Paris). But\r\ndomestic work and moderate exercise of the body are beneficial.\r\nPrecautions are especially necessary during the last months of\r\npregnancy for the general health of the mother and child, but\r\nimprudence during the early months may cause abortion in many women.\r\nThe progressive enervation of women in easy circumstances has no doubt\r\nrendered them less adapted to procreation. This failing should be\r\ncorrected by progressive but prudent training.\r\n\r\n=Medical Advice as to Marriage.=--The permission or prohibition of\r\nmarriage is a delicate question at the present day, but will be less\r\nso in the future, if our propositions are realized. If one of the two\r\ncandidates for matrimony has been or is still insane, or seriously\r\naffected with tuberculosis, or with active syphilis or chronic\r\ngonorrhea, it is clearly our duty to prohibit marriage.\r\n\r\nIf the situation is not so grave, and if it is only a question of\r\nhereditary taint, especially when there is a probability of the\r\noffspring being deformed in body or mind, we may content ourselves\r\nwith prohibiting the procreation of children, while giving permission\r\nfor marriage, provided anticonceptional measures are used. The\r\nimportance of these measures is obvious in such cases. We should\r\nexplain to the young people in question that the procreation of\r\nunhealthy or backward children is bad and even criminal, and warn them\r\nagainst such an unpardonable act of thoughtlessness. If they are very\r\nfond of children they can be recommended to adopt poor orphans.\r\n\r\nThere is no need, however, to be too severe. Medical men are often\r\npessimists, and have a tendency to see disease everywhere and to give\r\na grave prognosis. The procreation of children should not be\r\nprohibited simply because there is insanity in some member of the\r\nfamily, but the probabilities of hereditary transmission should be\r\ncalculated in the way we have explained in the first chapter of this\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the bodily and mental health and the\r\ncharacter of the two candidates for marriage, as well as that of their\r\nancestry, the physician should consider what is likely to be the\r\naverage quality of children from such a marriage. According as his\r\ncalculation leads to a probability above or below the average of the\r\npopulation, from all the points of view of the social value of man, he\r\nwill advise the parties concerned as to freedom or limitation in\r\nprocreation.\r\n\r\nThe average of humanity must not be placed too high, and the physician\r\nshould always keep in mind the great mental mediocrity, weakness of\r\nwill, the low moral level and physical defects of the bulk of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nWhen persons who are intelligent and educated, but more or less\r\npsychopathic or hereditarily tainted, put questions of this kind to\r\nthe doctor, because they are very conscientious and prudent, they\r\nshould be recommended to lead a healthy life and avoid alcohol, but\r\nneed not remain sterile, for their offspring may be morally and\r\nintellectually above the average, and if all blastophthoric influences\r\nare avoided there is a possibility or even probability of gradual\r\nregeneration. In short, the doctor must treat each case on its own\r\nmerits, carefully weigh both sides of the question, and avoid being\r\ninfluenced by exclusive dogmas of any kind. Thus only can he give wise\r\nand useful advice.\r\n\r\nWhat is of especial importance for us, is the knowledge that it is not\r\nnecessary, from the point of view of social hygiene, to prohibit\r\nmarriage for the sole reason that the offspring may be of bad quality.\r\nWe can allow psychopaths with hereditary taints, or even invalids of\r\nboth sexes, to contract sterile marriages, by requiring them to avoid\r\nconception by some means or other, in the name of social hygiene and\r\nmorality. In such cases dislocation of the tubes has a definite\r\neffect, and if we consider the negligence and weakness of mind of such\r\nindividuals, we should do well to recommend this proceeding whenever\r\nthere is a clear indication for inducing sterility. In this way we\r\navoid cruel measures, which, by the way, are almost impracticable,\r\nwhich take away all hope of love and happiness from these\r\nunfortunates, throw them into the arms of prostitution or bitter\r\npessimism, and make them disgusted with their own existence.\r\n\r\n=Medical Secrecy.=--Medical secrecy and its limitation is a very\r\ndelicate question, especially in sexual matters. Opinions vary in\r\ndifferent countries and among different individuals. In France medical\r\nsecrecy is almost made an idol; the medical man may refuse to give\r\nevidence in a court of law and even conceal a crime. In Germanic\r\ncountries, on the contrary, especially in German Switzerland, too\r\nlittle importance is attached to medical secrecy. In short, medical\r\nsecrecy is an elastic idea which is open to different interpretations.\r\n\r\nAlthough certain particular cases may present great difficulties,\r\nthere is a middle course of moral conduct which will serve the purpose\r\nof every conscientious doctor. As a general rule the doctor's duty is\r\nto keep secret everything confided to him by his patients, except when\r\nthe patients themselves speak openly of it, or authorize their doctor\r\nto do so. There are, however, exceptions to this rule.\r\n\r\nFirst of all it assumes normal responsibility in the patient, and is\r\nonly conditional among irresponsibles. When a lunatic, for example,\r\nrelates to a doctor, under the seal of secrecy, certain things which\r\ndepend on delirious ideas and which threaten the safety of others, or\r\nwhich render certain measures necessary in the patients' own interest,\r\nthe doctor's duty is to make known the state of affairs, but only to\r\nresponsible persons. It is the same as regards children. It is\r\nneedless to say that the doctor should use all possible measures in\r\nthe interest of the patient or child.\r\n\r\nBut even with responsible persons medical secrecy has its limits. The\r\ndoctor is here only bound to secrecy so far as it does not injure the\r\nrights of other individuals, or those of society.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of a medical man to report all cases of smallpox or\r\ncholera, etc., even against the consent of the patient, and to isolate\r\nthe latter to avoid an epidemic, which is contradictory to medical\r\nsecrecy. In short, he must not, under the pretext of medical secrecy,\r\nbecome an accomplice of harmful acts or crimes. I will mention a few\r\nexamples bearing on the sexual question:\r\n\r\nA sadist or a sexual pervert addicted to assaults on children consults\r\na doctor and confides to him his morbid appetite. It is obvious that\r\nthe doctor has to do with a dangerous individual and is at the same\r\ntime in a difficult position. In this case extreme measures are bad.\r\nThe doctor who simply treats the patient without concerning himself\r\nabout the possible victims, contravenes his duties. The one who\r\nreplies to the patient, \"you are a beast; go away or I shall denounce\r\nyou,\" acts in a still worse manner. The one who simply denounces the\r\npatient also puts himself in the wrong. In my opinion, the doctor\r\nshould first of all make a thorough examination of the mental and\r\nsexual condition of the patient, so as to establish the degree of\r\nperversion and satisfy himself whether he has to do with an honest\r\nindividual worthy of pity, who strives to overcome his morbid\r\nappetite; or, with a crafty egoist with no conscience, who only\r\nconsults the doctor to escape from temporary difficulties into which\r\nhis perversion has led him, and who indulges his morbid appetite\r\nwithout scruple, constituting a perpetual danger to society.\r\nUnfortunately, the latter cases are very common, and the doctor is\r\nusually consulted from interested motives only. Under these\r\ncircumstances medical secrecy renders the doctor the accomplice of the\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\nBetween the honest patient and one who is absolutely perverse, there\r\nare many transitional stages. In these cases the doctor should always\r\nmake a careful examination before forming an opinion. If he feels\r\nuncertain, he should call in a specialist in mental disease, and then\r\nact accordingly. If he is convinced that the patient has made the\r\nresolution to overcome his morbid appetite, and has so far resisted\r\nthe temptation to injure any one, he should strengthen the patient's\r\nresistance by doing everything possible (except marriage) to rid him\r\nof his malady; he should make him aware how dangerous his condition is\r\nto himself and to others; he may even recommend either castration or\r\nmasturbation in case of urgency, in order to avoid crime; he should\r\nmake him promise to come immediately for internment in an asylum, as\r\nsoon as he can no longer resist. Under these conditions he may respect\r\nmedical secrecy and at the same time save the existence of the\r\nunfortunate patient, while protecting society.\r\n\r\nIn more severe cases, when the doctor is convinced that the patient is\r\nincapable of controlling himself or does not wish to, or that he has\r\nalready committed crimes, he should act as follows: He must explain to\r\nthe patient that it is impossible for him to take the responsibility\r\nand that he must be immediately sent to an asylum, in default of which\r\ninformation will be given against him. We must make him understand\r\nthat he is a danger to society and goes beyond the limits of what is\r\nlicit, but that if he voluntarily submits to rational treatment,\r\noffering all requisite guarantees on both sides, he (the doctor) is\r\ndisposed to avoid any legal action.\r\n\r\nThe duty of medical secrecy ought never to go so far as to render the\r\nmedical man an accomplice of dangerous individuals or criminals. The\r\nlunatic asylum in such cases is the natural refuge for the patient, as\r\nthe lazaret is for cases of smallpox or cholera. These cases, however,\r\nrequire public asylums which are not too large, well organized, with\r\ndivisions for different cases, and provided with a sufficient medical\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\nI have chosen as the first example one of the worst kind of cases\r\nwhich endanger the public safety. But there are other cases such as\r\nthat depicted by Brieux in \"_Les Avariés_.\" A syphilitic subject\r\nwishes to marry before he is cured, and consults his doctor. Does the\r\nwhole duty of the doctor consist in dissuading the patient from\r\nmarriage? Has he actually the right to be silent when the patient will\r\nnot listen to him, and thus allow an innocent young woman to be\r\ncontaminated, through respect--or rather idolatry--for medical\r\nsecrecy? Is it not rather his duty to say to the patient: \"Beware! If\r\nyou do not promise to obey me, I will immediately denounce you to your\r\n_fiancée_ and her parents, and will tell them the state of affairs.\"\r\nIt seems to me that this is his duty. In this case the doctor does not\r\ndenounce the patient without his knowledge; he threatens him face to\r\nface, and may speak to him as follows: \"You have confided in me. I am,\r\nit is true, under the obligation of medical secrecy toward you, so\r\nlong as you do no harm to any one. But if, in spite of all my\r\nexplanations and warnings, you attempt to marry in your present state,\r\nrendering yourself guilty of infamous deceit toward a family and an\r\nunfortunate young woman whose health you will ruin, trusting in the\r\nobligation of secrecy which ties my tongue, I must inform you that I\r\nhave a much higher duty than that of a doctor toward his patient--my\r\nduty toward society, which I shall fulfill, and so prevent an innocent\r\nperson from becoming your victim.\"\r\n\r\nThis is my view of the duty of a conscientious doctor who upholds the\r\ndignity of his profession. An analogous case came under my\r\nobservation: A young tuberculous subject affected with several \"white\r\nswellings\" wished to marry. He refused to listen when I declared that\r\nhe would be guilty of a crime toward his _fiancée_. Thereupon I told\r\nhim that I should tell everything to the young girl. I did this at\r\nonce and so prevented the marriage. This egoist succeeded later on in\r\ncapturing the heart of another young girl, whom I also warned, but who\r\nmarried him out of pity. At any rate I consider that I did my duty.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this is also our duty in cases of chronic gonorrhea,\r\ninsanity, and hereditary or constitutional sexual perversions, etc.\r\nFormerly, when sexual inversion was regarded as an acquired vice, it\r\nwas attempted to cure it by marriage. Such a social monstrosity is\r\neven seen at the present day, and certain ignorant doctors recommend\r\nit. We sometimes meet with inverts who desire to procreate homosexual\r\nbeings like themselves. As sexual intercourse with the objects of\r\ntheir perverted passion cannot give them this pleasure, they marry in\r\norder to procreate children by some poor woman whom they have\r\nvictimized, without in the least renouncing their homosexual orgies.\r\nTheir wives play the part of housekeeper or servant, whose accessory\r\nfunction is to breed young inverts! Is it necessary to say that any\r\nself-respecting doctor who is aware of this state of affairs should\r\nnever countenance such marriages? Here again, his duty is to threaten\r\nthe invert with immediate denunciation to his _fiancée_, when he\r\nappears determined to accomplish his crime.\r\n\r\nAgain, the doctor may be consulted with regard to certain hereditary\r\ntaints, or possibly only a bad ancestral history, and whether marriage\r\nis advisable under the circumstances. In some cases there may be some\r\ndoubt and it is necessary to know the opinion of the other party\r\nconcerned, and whether this party is also affected in a similar way,\r\netc. The first duty of the doctor is to demand absolute frankness and\r\nto say, \"under this or that condition and in such and such\r\ncircumstances, you may perhaps marry, but under no pretext have you\r\nthe right to conceal the truth from your betrothed. It is to your own\r\ninterest to be frank, for no marriage founded on deceit can be happy.\r\nGive me permission to discuss the matter with your _fiancée_ (or\r\n_fiancé_). We shall then see what is best to be done.\"\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the person who consults a doctor usually accepts\r\nthis proposal, and we can thus avoid many misfortunes and do much\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to fix a general rule. According to the degree of\r\nhereditary taint or the nature of the infirmity, we allow marriage\r\nwith or without children, or do not allow it. In such cases it is\r\nrarely necessary to have recourse to the threat of denunciation, but\r\nthis may be required in the case of egoistic or vicious individuals.\r\nOn several occasions a betrothed couple have come to me for advice as\r\nto their proposed marriage, and have freely disclosed their most\r\nintimate relations and antecedents. This is as it always should be, if\r\nmen were more loyal in sexual matters and understood better their true\r\ninterests. In this way the doctor's task is greatly facilitated. When\r\nthe public is more enlightened on the whole question it will become\r\nmore and more easy to arrive at a just conclusion, even without the\r\ndoctor's help.\r\n\r\n=Artificial Abortion.=--We have already spoken of another question\r\nwhich is often put to doctors--that of artificial abortion. (Vide\r\nChapter XIII.) In every case of this kind all the circumstances must\r\nbe carefully weighed. I repeat here, that in the future more attention\r\nshould be paid to social interests, instead of always requiring the\r\npreservation of an embryo for the sole reason that the state of the\r\nmother does not contra-indicate pregnancy or accouchement. The\r\nquestion is whether a miserable abortion or an idiot should be allowed\r\nto come into the world. If we allow children who are born monsters,\r\nidiots or invalids to live, we should at least do what we can to\r\nprevent them being born. It will no doubt be objected that it is much\r\neasier to recognize the quality of a child after birth than before,\r\nand this objection is quite legitimate. But so long as the laws\r\nprotect the lives of the most miserable monsters we must get out of\r\nthe difficulty as best we can.\r\n\r\n=Treatment of Sexual Disorders.=--We cannot enter here into all the\r\ndetails of a purely medical question, and shall only touch on certain\r\nspecial points. Patients with venereal disease are often treated in a\r\nvery defective manner, because many of them are ashamed to submit to\r\nrational treatment. The treatment of venereal diseases should be\r\ncarried out with more regard for the feelings of the patients; there\r\nshould be special hospitals for each sex, with separate divisions, so\r\nthat patients can be treated without betraying their identity. The\r\nfear of being recognized prevents many better-class women from\r\napplying for treatment. The idea of being placed in the venereal\r\ndivisions of a hospital along with common prostitutes is unbearable to\r\nthem. For this reason I maintain that anonymous treatment should be\r\ninstituted at hospitals in all the chief localities. This humanitarian\r\nwork would benefit not only the patients, but society in general, by\r\ndiminishing the number of venereal infections. Treatment by private\r\npractitioners is too costly for poor people and does not easily remain\r\nanonymous. Therefore, the creation of hospitals for venereal disease\r\nis very necessary in the public interest, and would benefit public\r\nhealth much more than the regulation of prostitution.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of sexual perversions is also very important. These\r\ndisorders are either hereditary, or acquired by auto-suggestion or\r\nevil example. By provoking suggestion and good habits in the opposite\r\ndirection, hypnotic suggestion is alone capable of acting directly\r\nagainst the evil. Other remedies, such as distraction of the mind by\r\nwork or fatigue, by marriage, electricity, etc., have only an indirect\r\nsuggestive action. When a perversion has been acquired by\r\nauto-suggestion or by habit, especially in the case of onanism,\r\nhypnotic suggestion should always be employed. In compensatory\r\nmasturbation, where normal sexual appetite exists, and where it is\r\nonly the opportunity of satisfying it that is wanting, marriage or\r\nnormal sexual intercourse are sufficient to cure the bad habit.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, too easily admit the existence of acquired\r\nperversions. Apart from compensatory masturbation, which is not a\r\nperversion, but only an outlet to a pent-up natural want, true\r\nacquired perversions are rather rare, and as we have seen generally\r\nauto-suggestive. Pederasts, sodomists, and others, whose perverse\r\nhabits are truly acquired, have usually taken to them for want of\r\nsomething better, and prefer normal coitus if they have the\r\nopportunity and the means of procuring it. It is true, however, that\r\nsome debauchees contract these perverse habits from desire for change,\r\nor from fear of infection or conception, but these individuals seldom\r\nconsult the doctor.\r\n\r\nThus the individuals who consult a doctor are nearly always more or\r\nless pathological, and belong to the domain of hereditary or\r\nauto-suggestive perversions. For the first, at least, we avoid\r\nrecommending marriage. Von Schrenck-Notzing has sometimes succeeded in\r\ntransforming hereditary inversion into normal sexual appetite for\r\nwomen, by hypnotic suggestion. I have also succeeded myself, two or\r\nthree times. After a cure of long duration, confirmed by frequent\r\nvisits to prostitutes, Von Schrenck-Notzing has ventured to recommend\r\nmarriage; but I have never done this, as I do not consider a cure\r\nsufficient to guarantee definite success, in the case of disorders so\r\ndeeply rooted in the constitution. In such cases I have endeavored, as\r\nfar as possible, to weaken the sexual appetite and induce the patient\r\nto be contented with nocturnal emissions. I have always debarred\r\ninverts from marriage, impressing them with the fact that to marry\r\nwould be a crime, and that they had a hundred times better masturbate;\r\nor, if they wish to attempt intercourse with women, to be contented\r\nwith a mistress, avoiding the procreation of children.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our present laws and customs prevent us from\r\nrecommending or even allowing inverts to \"marry\" their fellows, as\r\nthey so strongly desire to do. This would be very innocent from the\r\nsocial point of view, and the poor wretches would be content, and\r\nwould cease to be a menace to normal individuals.\r\n\r\nI am, therefore, of the same opinion as those who demand the\r\nsuppression of all laws which punish or prosecute sexual inversion and\r\npederasty committed between adults and in common agreement. So long as\r\npederasts do not harm normal individuals, and so long as they do not\r\nseduce minors, they should be left alone, the same as all other\r\nsexually perverted individuals who are not dangerous. But when a\r\npatient of this kind wishes to be treated, through shame or nervous\r\nexcitement, the doctor should hypnotize him and suggest distraction of\r\nmind by useful occupations. Psychic treatment is always the most\r\nefficacious. It is only in cases where it is certain that the\r\nperversion is purely acquired and easily curable that marriage can be\r\nallowed, or the procreation of children. I am not referring here to\r\nsterile marriages between perverts or psychopaths, which we have\r\nmentioned above, and which can always be allowed when the two parties\r\nare fully enlightened on the subject.\r\n\r\nFrequent emissions, masturbation, sexual hyperæsthesia and impotence\r\nmay often be improved or even cured by suggestion. In such cases, if\r\nthe sexual appetite is otherwise normal, marriage need not always be\r\nprohibited. Each case must be judged on its merits.\r\n\r\nIn sexual anæsthesia marriage is an error based on a grave\r\nmisconception. Even in partial anæsthesia it may have deplorable\r\neffects. We are now only speaking of anæsthesia in man. Most young\r\nvirgins are anæsthetic in the sense that they are not acquainted with\r\nthe venereal orgasm and cannot tell how far their hitherto dormant\r\nsexual appetite will develop. The sexual instruction which we have\r\nrecommended for young girls would have the advantage of making those\r\nwho are absolutely sexually frigid disgusted with marriage and coitus,\r\nas soon as they know all about it.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of sexual anæsthesia are much more innocent in woman\r\nthan in man, because this anæsthesia neither prevents coitus nor\r\nfecundation. A woman who is sexually anæsthetic may marry a man who is\r\naffected with the same condition, when both parties are aware of the\r\nfact and desire to contract a union which is hardly sexual, but rather\r\na union of minds with a common ideal. This is the true platonic love\r\nwhich is admitted in theory. It is not very common and must not be\r\nconfounded with homosexual inclinations. It has its object of\r\nexistence, for those affected with anæsthesia may feel the want of\r\naffection and of home, as well as sentimental communion. If they\r\ndesire children they can adopt them.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for themselves, the subjects of sexual anæsthesia have\r\nas little idea of sexual sensations as a blind man has of colours;\r\nthis causes them to commit great blunders, because they do not\r\ncomprehend the nature of the sexual appetite in others, and often\r\nmarry an erotic individual without knowing what they are doing.\r\n\r\nThe special treatment of diseases of the male and female sexual\r\norgans is beyond the scope of this book. I may, however, remark that\r\nspecialists are often wrong in treating the genital organs locally for\r\npathological symptoms which depend on cerebral disorder, which can\r\nonly yield to psychic treatment and suggestion. This is the case with\r\nmany disorders of menstruation in women, psychic impotence and\r\nfrequent seminal emissions in men, masturbation, etc., (except cases\r\ndue to phimosis, or local irritation caused by worms, etc.) I hasten\r\nto add that this remark in no way excuses errors in the opposite\r\ndirection, viz, neglect of local treatment, when this is indicated\r\nafter careful examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSEXUAL MORALITY\r\n\r\n\r\n=Law and Morality.=--The limits of morality and law are difficult to\r\nfix. With the old conception of law and the expiation of crime it was\r\notherwise. Yet it is precisely the old law, based on dogma and\r\nreligious metaphysics, which has most usurped the domain of morality,\r\nby considering as crimes all kinds of acts which, without hurting men\r\nin the least degree, were opposed to the ruling ideas and prejudices\r\nconcerning religion and morality.\r\n\r\n=Human and Religious Morality.=--What then constitutes ethics or true\r\nhuman morality? A dogmatic system, of ethics has been built on a\r\ncollection of commandments supposed to be inspired by God. Religions\r\nhave established different duties toward God, and these duties or\r\ncommandments are in part very inhuman. This has often resulted in\r\ndirect contradictions between ethics attributed to divine revelation,\r\nand pure human ethics. Moreover, the divine commandments vary in\r\ndifferent religions.\r\n\r\nThe god of certain Malays commands them to eat the heart of their\r\nenemies; Jehovah was vindictive and jealous, ordering Abraham to\r\nsacrifice his own son to prove his faith, causing whole tribes to be\r\nannihilated, even drowning the whole of humanity by the flood, while\r\nthe God of the Christians is milder and more conciliating; Allah rules\r\nas a fatalist and orders the massacre of the Christians and abstinence\r\nfrom alcohol, while Jesus Christ tells men to love their enemies and\r\nallows wine; the god of the Hindus orders the widow to follow her\r\nhusband to the grave; a number of other gods exact human sacrifice;\r\nBuddha taught oblivion in the future, others a more or less eternal\r\nparadise, hell and purgatory, according to the conduct of men.\r\n\r\nIt will be agreed that it is difficult to obtain anything logical or\r\ncoherent from the total of different religious moralities. As regards\r\nthe sexual question, so-called divine commandments, such as those of\r\nmonogamy and polygamy, directly contradict each other.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, we will leave the so-called revealed morality to the\r\npriests of diverse religions who pretend to have received them\r\ndirectly from God, and will confine ourselves to the study of purely\r\nhuman morality. This should never be based on any dogmatic formula,\r\nlike the above on their religious dogmas; it must be evolved from the\r\nnatural conditions of human life.\r\n\r\n=Morality and Hygiene.=--Morality is intimately connected with\r\nhygiene, and wherever there appears to be a contradiction between\r\nhygiene and ethics this is due to the fact that individual hygiene has\r\nonly been considered, and not public or social hygiene--that is the\r\nhygiene of the race. It is the duty of the medical profession to place\r\nsocial above individual hygiene, to subordinate the hygienic welfare\r\nof the individual to that of society. A contradiction may exist\r\nbetween individual morality and hygiene, never between social morality\r\nand hygiene.\r\n\r\n=Definition of Morality.=--How can we define morality or ethics?\r\nLiberated as far as possible from all hypothesis, ethics is\r\ntheoretically the study of what is good or bad in human actions, and\r\npractically, as regards morality, the duty of doing good and avoiding\r\nevil. But this is hardly explicit, for what do we understand by good\r\nand evil? Not only do some consider good what others consider evil,\r\nbut the words which Goethe puts into the mouth of the devil (in\r\n\"_Faust_\")--that while wishing evil he often did good--will always be\r\ntrue. This gives a faithful representation of the deplorable want of\r\nadaptation which exists between the good and evil effects of our\r\nactions on the one hand, and the goodness or wickedness of our motives\r\non the other hand. The inverse is also true, for good intentions often\r\nhave evil results. We must, therefore, carefully distinguish between\r\nthe ethical motives of the good and bad effects of an action.\r\n\r\nIf we continue our analysis we shall discover that the same action may\r\nbe good for one and bad for another. When a wolf devours a lamb, it is\r\ngood for the wolf but bad for the lamb. We cannot live without\r\ndestroying other lives, animal or vegetable. The money we earn comes\r\nout of the pockets of others without their always obtaining a\r\ncorresponding profit, and so on. Morality is thus _relative_, and we\r\nhave not the faculty of discovering anything which is absolutely good\r\nor absolutely bad in itself.\r\n\r\nAll that men can expect by mutual exchange of their wisdom and good\r\nwill is to do as little evil and as much good as possible, that is to\r\nsay, to diminish the amount of their physical and psychic ills by\r\nimproving their mutual conditions of existence, and thus increasing\r\nthe amount of good. Even this is only possible by limiting the ideas\r\nof good and evil almost exclusively to humanity, trampling on the\r\nconditions of existence and the development of other beings, or at\r\nleast concerning ourselves with them only as far as they are useful to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nFurther, we have seen that it is very difficult to extend the\r\nconception of social welfare to all the living races of humanity, for\r\nsome of them are at the same time so fecund and so inferior in\r\nquality, that if they were allowed to multiply around us without any\r\nprecaution they would soon starve and supplant us. Then the barbarity\r\nof their lower instincts (vide weight of brain in different races at\r\nend of Chapter VI) would soon take the upper hand and become general,\r\nas the negroes of Hayti have shown us by a lesson which is worthy of\r\nour attention.\r\n\r\nTherefore, an exaggeration of moral sentiments, resting on a false\r\nbasis, would have the positive result of striking a fatal blow at our\r\nsocial morality, slowly built up during hundreds or thousands of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nLastly, the same action may first of all do evil and afterwards good,\r\nfor example, a painful lesson; or _vice versa_, as in the satisfaction\r\nof a gluttonous appetite.\r\n\r\n=Morality can only be Relative.=--It follows from these considerations\r\nthat our moral duties can only be relative, and cannot bind us in the\r\nsame way nor in the same degree to all living beings, not even to all\r\nmen, if we would avoid sacrificing what is lofty to what is vile. In\r\ntheory, the definition of human morality will consist in a just and\r\nscientific definition of social welfare and the exigencies which it\r\nimposes on individuals, in order that the latter do not do evil in\r\nattempting to do good. In practice, it will be the general effort made\r\nto develop successfully this social welfare by the aid of individual\r\nwill. This presupposes in the first place education of the will, the\r\ndispositions to useful work, and the altruistic sentiments of each\r\nindividual. It is neither theoretical dogma nor preaching, but action\r\nand example which make for the education of man.\r\n\r\nThe noblest task of moral action is to strive for the welfare of\r\nfuture generations.\r\n\r\n=Altruism and Egoism.=--Properly understood, altruism and egoism do\r\nnot form an antinomy, or only quite a relative antinomy. It is\r\nabsolutely wrong to found social order by letting loose all our\r\negoistic appetites without restriction. But it is quite as wrong to\r\noppose them with an exaggerated and unnatural asceticism, which\r\nreflects in our eyes an erroneous ideal of altruism.\r\n\r\nWhen a bee or an ant disgorges the honey from its stomach for the\r\nbenefit of its companions, it enjoys it. By sacrificing its life for\r\nthe hive or the nest, it satisfies an altruistic or social instinct.\r\nCannot man also be more happy in giving than receiving? How can we\r\nexplain the great sacrifices, the martyrs who suffer and die for their\r\ncountry, for their family, for science, for an idea, if enthusiasm--an\r\nexpanded sentiment of pleasure--did not lead man to disinterested\r\nsacrifice, or if an inner obsession did not find its satisfaction in\r\nthe welfare of humanity?\r\n\r\nLet us seek all measures which by social adaptation can ennoble our\r\nhuman egoism, reduce it to its indispensable and just measure, and\r\nmaintain it in proper equilibrium, by the aid of an active altruism;\r\nthat is to say, by social habits of self-sacrifice for the benefit of\r\nthe community. We shall then obtain a paradise on earth, no doubt very\r\nrelative, but far preferable to our present anarchy based on the\r\nstrife of personal interests.\r\n\r\nThe chief thing wanting is a good hereditary quality among human\r\nindividuals, a quality which is still entirely left to chance, by the\r\nmost deplorable selection; the second requisite is the education of\r\ncharacter and will in our children. Our religion and our schools have\r\nshown themselves incapable of raising the bulk of the people above\r\nbarbarism, that is to say from apathy, vulgarity of sentiment,\r\nroutine, ignorance and prejudice. No doubt intellectual culture and\r\nreligious ethics have accomplished a certain amount of moral progress,\r\nbut the methods employed in our churches and schools have not advanced\r\nwith science. They are in no sense adapted to our present moral wants\r\nand still less to the exigencies of the future.\r\n\r\nIt is on the basis of a natural human morality, such as we have just\r\ndescribed, that we must found sexual morality or ethics, and it is not\r\ndifficult to form clear ideas on this subject, if we take the trouble\r\nto examine the facts explained in the first fourteen chapters of this\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nFrom the social and moral point of view we may consider an action as\r\n_positive_ or useful, _neutral_ or indifferent, and _negative_ or\r\nharmful. But the same action may be at the same time positive,\r\nnegative or indifferent, relatively to one or more groups of\r\nindividuals. But in ethics it is not only a question of the action in\r\nitself, but especially the inner motives which lead to it; for, to\r\nleave the good and ill of society to chance and ignorance, is to deny\r\nthe possibility of progress. It is difficult for a man to accomplish\r\npositive social actions, when the moral sentiments of conscience and\r\nduty are wanting. On the other hand, a narrow-minded individual, with\r\nfalse judgment, will accomplish negative social actions through moral\r\nmotives, while in certain cases an individual may accomplish positive\r\nsocial acts fortuitously through perverse motives. Through vengeance,\r\na generous legacy may be left which injures an individual, while\r\nprofiting the public. Without being perverse, motives may be simply\r\negoistic and lead to good by calculated egoism.\r\n\r\nBy altruist, we understand a man animated by powerful moral sentiments\r\nwhich preside over social humanitarian volitions. By the term pure\r\negoist, we designate one in whom self forms the exclusive object of\r\nsentiments of sympathy. In himself, the egoist is indifferent from the\r\nmoral point of view, so long as he injures no one, and the altruist\r\nhimself cannot live without a certain amount of egoism. The ideal of\r\nsocial sentiment therefore consists in the combined action of\r\negoistic and altruistic sentiments, adapted to the wants of society\r\nand its members. As among certain ants, there should exist a complete\r\ncompensatory regulation between the egoistic sentiments and appetites\r\non the other hand. The antagonist of altruism is not the egoist, but\r\nthe perverse individual whose acts are by instinct almost constantly\r\nnegative from the moral point of view. Egoism urges a man in such an\r\nirresistible way to abuse and harm others in order to satisfy himself,\r\nthat a pure egoist can rarely remain indifferent from the moral point\r\nof view. These considerations suffice to show the impossibility of\r\nbasing social order on pure egoism, as so many people desire.\r\n\r\n=Sexual Morality.=--Sexual morality depends upon what we have just\r\nsaid. By itself, the sexual appetite is indifferent from the moral\r\npoint of view. A great confusion of ideas, based on religious\r\nmisunderstanding, has led to the term morality being more and more\r\nidentified with that of moral conduct in the sexual domain. In short,\r\nethics has been more or less confounded with sexuality. From this\r\npoint of view, a sexually anæsthetic individual is regarded as\r\nextremely \"moral,\" while he is perhaps in other respects a knave. In\r\nreality his sexual indifference has not the least moral value. For the\r\nsame reason an invert is not virtuous because he does not seduce\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nFrom the Protestant point of view it is immoral to burden one's wife\r\nwith continual pregnancies, while from the Catholic point of view it\r\nis immoral to interfere with these pregnancies by preventive measures.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the sexual appetite gives rise to much conflict with\r\nhuman morality, for the simple reason that it looks upon human beings\r\nas objects of pleasure. Fetichism, in which the sexual appetite is\r\ndirected toward inanimate objects, and sodomy, directed to animals,\r\nare by themselves almost incapable of entering into conflict with\r\nmorality as we understand it.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of many people who consider the employment of\r\nanticonceptional measures as immoral, while defending prostitution,\r\nshows how much ideas vary on the subject of sexual ethics. Preachers\r\nof morality, and even priests, sometimes blame a young man who wishes\r\nto marry his mistress, and urge him to get rid of her and the child\r\nby paying a sum of money. The inconsistency of men in the way they\r\nintroduce their so-called moral ideas into sexual questions is simply\r\nincredible. Their heads are full of a jumble of hypocrisy, mysticism,\r\nprejudice, pecuniary interests, veneration for old traditional customs\r\ncalled good manners, a jumble which absolutely confuses all ideas of a\r\nhealthy sexual morality. Look at the indignation of parents when their\r\nchildren become betrothed to persons whom they consider to be beneath\r\nthem in social position, or who possess too little money! And all\r\nthese people are unconscious of their immorality, which sails under\r\nthe flag of morality!\r\n\r\nWhat standpoint are we to take in the sexual domain, which is free\r\nfrom prejudice, with regard to true human morality? This is the\r\nquestion which an honest and truly moral man has to put to himself.\r\n\r\nThe first principle is the old medical adage: _Above all things do no\r\nharm_; the second is: _Be as useful as possible, both individually and\r\nsocially._\r\n\r\nThe commandment of sexual morality will thus be: _Thou shalt do no\r\nharm willingly to any person, nor to humanity, by thy sexual appetite\r\nor acts, and thou shalt do thy utmost to promote the happiness of thy\r\nneighbor and the welfare of society._\r\n\r\nEndowed with sexual appetite and the faculty of love, the social man\r\nwill utilize both for the benefit of the community as well as his own.\r\nIf he acts honorably his task will not be easy, but he will experience\r\nall the more satisfaction, for his good deeds will bring their own\r\nreward. He should bear in mind the following examples:\r\n\r\n(1). A man of bad disposition, excited by momentary sexual passion,\r\nseduces a girl, makes her pregnant, and then disappears. He injures\r\nhis victim and himself without deriving any advantage. His action is\r\ntherefore negative, and is to be condemned both from the ethical and\r\nthe egoistic point of view.\r\n\r\n(2). Through motives of religious morality, a virtuous girl marries a\r\ndepraved drunkard in order to save him. This rarely succeeds, and if\r\nit does it is generally incomplete. From the egoistic point of view\r\nthis experiment is exclusively negative. From the altruistic point of\r\nview the motives are, it is true, very positive, but the social\r\neffects are still more negative. If all goes well, our virtuous and\r\nexalted girl will succeed in improving the drunkard, but if she\r\nprocreates children, she will have unconsciously sinned against them,\r\nand her good action will result in the sins of the father being\r\nvisited on the children.\r\n\r\n(3). A man with marked hereditary taints, impulsive, psychopathic and\r\npossessed of a strong sexual appetite, marries an honest girl of good\r\nfamily, and has several children by her. Such an action is positive\r\nfrom the egoistic point of view, for the individual in question\r\nbenefits himself. From the ethical point of view, it is negative, for\r\nit makes an honest woman unhappy, and probably leads to the\r\nprocreation of children of bad quality.\r\n\r\n(4). A man, healthy in body and mind, capable, hardworking and full of\r\nideals, finds a suitable companion. Instead of leading an easy life,\r\nthey both undertake as much work as possible, especially social\r\nduties, and procreate at sufficient intervals as many children as they\r\ncan without injury to the health of the wife. This is an ideal\r\ncombination of positive altruism with positive egoism.\r\n\r\nIt is not every one who has the good fortune to fulfill the conditions\r\nnecessary for this combination. A positive sexual morality is,\r\nhowever, by no means excluded in less favorable conditions. Certain\r\npsychopathic or feeble individuals may contract sterile marriages in\r\nthe manner previously indicated, and may recompense themselves for the\r\nabsence of children by devoting themselves all the more to social\r\nduties, or to the education of abandoned orphans.\r\n\r\nWhen a union is concluded between a person who is capable in all\r\nrespects, and another who is not, the latter should give the other\r\npermission to procreate children by a third party, more adapted to\r\ngive rise to healthy offspring. Although this is immoral according to\r\ncurrent conventional opinion, it seems to me that such a proceeding\r\ncould become reconciled with positive morality in the future.\r\n\r\nIn short, whoever understands the true nature of sexual ethics will\r\nalways find a means of accomplishing good actions and avoiding bad\r\nones, at the same time satisfying his normal appetites, provided these\r\ninjure no one.\r\n\r\nThe truly moral man will never become the accomplice of such a social\r\niniquity as proxenetism with prostitution and all its satellites, but\r\nwill oppose them with all his power. He will always avoid doing wrong\r\nto any one by his sexual appetite; and if his passion drives him to a\r\nthoughtless act, he will do his utmost to redress the bad effects\r\nwhich may result from it.\r\n\r\nThe psychological action produced by conjugal infidelity merits\r\nspecial attention. It depends on the more or less egoistic or\r\naltruistic qualities of the one who becomes enamored of a third\r\nperson. I have observed the two chief varieties of cases. If the\r\nguilty husband has naturally moral and social sentiments, his\r\nextra-nuptial love renders him still more affectionate toward his\r\nlegitimate wife. He eases his conscience by becoming more indulgent to\r\nhis wife. When his amorous intoxication is over, he will try to avoid\r\neverything which may damage the reputation of the other woman, and\r\nwill provide for her future. If there are children by this adultery,\r\nhe will provide for them.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with a married woman who is in love with another man.\r\nIn this case the whole personality is more powerfully involved than in\r\nman. But on the other hand, the natural energy of the woman will lead\r\nher to try and arrange a marriage between her lover and some other\r\ngood woman, and to resist coitus with him.\r\n\r\nIf the matter goes as far as complete infidelity, and even without it,\r\nvarious reactions may be observed. When her sentiments are monogamous,\r\nas is the case with most women, the love of a woman for her husband\r\ndisappears and is replaced by pity. She easily becomes peevish in her\r\nresignation. She often seeks divorce, even when adultery has not taken\r\nplace. When she is polyandrous, as is the case with many hysterical\r\nwomen, she is quite capable of lavishing her caresses on her husband\r\nas well as her lover, a thing which is impossible for normal women.\r\n\r\nWhat induces want of respect for his wife in the unfaithful egoist, is\r\nnot so much the monogamous sentiment, which is somewhat exceptional in\r\nman, but intoxication of his senses by another woman. He then becomes\r\nmiserly and disagreeable toward his wife, finding fault with her in\r\nevery way, but the innocent and deceived victim finally discovers the\r\ntrue cause of this change of manner. Some women who are ill-treated in\r\nthis way, preserve their love for their husbands, while others never\r\npardon the slightest infidelity, not even an innocent platonic\r\naffection, in their husbands.\r\n\r\nThe brutality of a husband toward his wife, when he is in love with\r\nanother, often knows no limits. From bad temper, chicanery, contempt\r\nand hatred, he often goes on to blows and even murder, as the annals\r\nof criminology prove too well. Egoistic women who have a lover, also\r\ntreat their husbands badly. Owing to their legal subordination and\r\ncomparative physical weakness, they reveal their sentiments in a less\r\nbrutal form, but malice and bad temper are not wanting. In such cases,\r\nthe woman's principal weapon is cunning, which may go as far as\r\npoisoning the husband. More commonly she simply abandons him, to force\r\nhim to divorce.\r\n\r\nThere are many transitions and varieties, but the reactions we have\r\nmentioned are the most common. It is quite natural, when one of the\r\nconjoints falls in love with a third person, for the sexual appetite\r\nto become cold toward the conjoint, and for this frigidity to make her\r\nappear less desirable and show up her defects.\r\n\r\nSexual morality is twice mentioned in the ten commandments of Moses:\r\n\r\nSeventh commandment: _Thou shall not commit adultery._\r\n\r\nTenth commandment: _Thy shall not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his\r\nman servant, nor his maid servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor\r\nanything that is thy neighbor's._\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh commandment of Jesus Christ the words: _Thou shall\r\nlove thy neighbor as thyself_, represent approximately the point of\r\nview of modern ethics. Nevertheless contemporary social progress\r\nrequires more and better. It is not so exalted as to say \"Love those\r\nwho persecute you,\" but it demands a more rational and better\r\nformulated ethics, somewhat as follows: _Thou shall love humanity more\r\nthan thyself, and thou shalt seek thy happiness in the welfare of its\r\nfuture._ Such a formula expresses the commandment of sexual ethics as\r\nwe have defined it.\r\n\r\nIn the commandments of Moses the wife is regarded as property, and the\r\ndesire for the wife of one's neighbor is threatened with divine\r\npunishment inasmuch as it covets the property of one's neighbor. When\r\nwoman is treated as a free subject and as the equal and companion of\r\nman, it is evident that a fundamental revision of such ideas is\r\nrequisite. Certain forms of adultery with voluntary consent on both\r\nsides may even become positive from the moral point of view.\r\n\r\n_In spite of this, one of the principal tasks of man's sexual morality\r\nwill always be to restrain his erotic polygamous desires, for the\r\nsimple reason that they are especially apt to injure the rights and\r\nthe welfare of others._ We must make exception for certain special\r\ncases in which no one is injured. (Vide Couvreur's \"_La Graine_,\" and\r\nde Maupassant's \"_Mouche_.\")\r\n\r\nThe novelist loves to treat of tragic situations, often giving them a\r\nfatal ending to excite the feelings of his readers. We must avoid\r\nbasing sexual ethics on such ideas. The average man, or even one whose\r\nnature is a little above the average, is rarely as passionate as the\r\nheroes in novels. He does not commit suicide for rejected love, but\r\nfinds compensation in time. He can even overcome jealousy.\r\n\r\nIt is thus an exaggeration, depending partly on the suggestion and\r\nauto-suggestion of amorous intoxication, to require in the ethics of\r\nlove the absolute fusion of the personality of two human beings, a\r\nmutual fusion of sentiments and ideas destined to last till death.\r\nThis kind of morality reverts to dual egoism, and in no way represents\r\nthe ideal of human happiness. However beautiful conjugal fidelity, its\r\nexaggeration is deplorable, when it only results in the idolatrous\r\nworship of a single being, living or dead, and regards the rest of the\r\nworld with indifference, if not with hostility.\r\n\r\nWe have already shown that the altruistic sentiments of man are the\r\ndirect or indirect[10] derivatives of the sexual appetite, and\r\nespecially of sexual love. The true secret of sexual ethics consists,\r\ntherefore, in a cult of altruism in the sexual domain. This cult\r\nshould not waste itself in moral phrases, but show its strength by\r\nsocial deeds.\r\n\r\nA sad proof of human weakness is given daily by certain forms of\r\nmodern ethics which waste themselves in public conferences or in\r\ndeclamations in the press. This kind of morality is in accordance with\r\npure egoism. Without social work, it is not true morality, whether\r\nthis work be public or modestly hidden.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for existence was formerly carried on by man against\r\nnature, against animals, and especially against other men. Nature and\r\nanimals (excepting the cosmic forces and microbes) are nowadays\r\nconquered by the human brain, and wars are seldom waged except between\r\ngreat empires, a fact which will sooner or later reduce them to\r\nabsurdity. For this reason the morality of the god of war and of\r\npatriotic chauvinism has had his day and loses more and more his\r\nreason for existence. Modern ethics has already become a social and\r\ninternational human ethics, and will become more so in the future.\r\n\r\nAs in olden times a true hero knew how to combine love of his wife\r\nwith love for his country, to obtain in his conjugal union the\r\nstrength to fight for his ideal, so our modern love will serve to\r\nstimulate us in the pursuit of an ideal, in our fight for social\r\nwelfare. Man and woman must fight side by side, as this struggle\r\nrequires from both an intense and lifelong effort. But it is precisely\r\nin this effort, in this work, that they will obtain their highest\r\nenjoyment. This effort supports and strengthens not only the muscles,\r\nbut especially the mind, the cerebral energy.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for social welfare prepares for us the highest and most\r\nideal joy. It teaches man to master himself, to overcome his natural\r\nidleness, his desire for pleasure, his dependence on all kinds of\r\nfutile habits and base appetites. It educates his will, curbs his weak\r\nand egoistic sentiments, while exercising his faculty for creating\r\ngood and useful works. Thanks to this incessant strife, a brain of\r\neven mediocre quality may become a useful social instrument.\r\n\r\nI ask in all sincerity if, living in the way we have just described, a\r\nman will find the time and inclination to indulge in the love stories\r\nwhich the novels of our libraries offer to readers of both sexes for\r\ntheir daily consumption? I reply: if the man is normal, no. It is only\r\npathological natures, with their exaggerated sentiment and morbid\r\npassions, which remain incapable of mastering their passionate\r\nemotionalism and reducing it to silence. Other individuals, normal or\r\nsemi-normal, are artificially urged to exaggerated exaltation in the\r\nsexual domain by idleness, by reading pernicious novels which excite\r\ntheir sexual appetite and their sentimentality, also by the artificial\r\nlife and feverish activity of life in cities.\r\n\r\nWork in itself is not sufficient, and every one ought to add social\r\nwork to his ordinary occupation. In fact, the monotony of any special\r\noccupation, and even the exclusive work of a scientific speciality,\r\nends by giving the cerebral energy itself an exclusive character. The\r\nmoral sentiments become atrophied. Exclusiveness in a speciality,\r\npracticed without any complement, easily leads to exclusiveness in\r\nlove (not in the sexual appetite!). We often see two egoists, or\r\nseveral in a family, working together to exploit the rest of society.\r\nAs long as they keep in good health and their business prospers, as\r\nlong as the egoistic plans of a third party do not upset their\r\ncalculations, they may remain faithful to each other and live in\r\ncomparative happiness. But what else?\r\n\r\nWhoever, on the contrary, has known how to combine with his conjugal\r\nlove, a lively interest in humanity, will always find in the latter a\r\nconsoling compensation for the greatest misfortunes and the most cruel\r\nlosses. He will not fall into a state of despair, but will survive his\r\ntrouble, and will become reconciled to men and society without\r\nexpecting anything from them, for he will have been accustomed all his\r\nlife to work in an impersonal manner.\r\n\r\nIf I am accused of being enthusiastic over an ideal which is\r\nimpossible to attain, I protest strongly. Good habits may always be\r\nacquired, and true altruists are found among the most modest of men,\r\namong simple workingmen or peasants who comprehend and realize the\r\nideal I have just depicted.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XVII we shall see in what way the dispositions of the child\r\ncan be and ought to be developed in the direction indicated. It is\r\nneedless to say that pure egoists and perverse individuals, who are\r\nnegative from the moral point of view, in other words natures which\r\nare evil and harmful by heredity, can never be educated so as to\r\nbecome altruists. But these perverse natures do not form the majority.\r\nThe great majority of men, although idle and indifferent, may still\r\nbecome habituated to social work by suitable education, as soon as the\r\nexternal forces which urge them to evil, such as drink and the greed\r\nfor money, have been removed and replaced by beneficial forces.\r\n\r\nLastly, the whole attention of humanity should be directed toward its\r\nproper selection, so as to increase the number of useful individuals,\r\nand diminish or gradually eliminate the bad and incapable. But this is\r\nthe work of many centuries of enlightenment and education, a work\r\nwhich we can only begin at present. We find ourselves here in face of\r\none of the weakest points in human nature, a weakness which consists\r\nin only becoming enthusiastic over progress which will enable self to\r\nattain its object, and not help others. When self does not quickly\r\nobtain a palpable result, it is paralyzed and discouraged, and turns\r\nits back on reform under the most futile pretexts. I will give an\r\nexample:\r\n\r\nA young bachelor became enthusiastic over the social reform of\r\nabstinence from alcohol. For some years he worked with zeal, took part\r\nin numerous public demonstrations, and became an apostle of total\r\nabstinence. One day, after some failure, he turned his back on\r\nabstinence, declaring that the movement had no future. Nevertheless,\r\nthe social movement of abstinence progressed without him. After some\r\nyears, he was asked the reason why he had abandoned the movement.\r\nAfter having first of all repeated his pretext, he confessed that he\r\ndid not wish to appear eccentric. He admitted that he had never felt\r\nso well as when he was an abstainer, appeared somewhat astonished to\r\nlearn that the movement had made so much progress without him, was\r\nfinally convinced of his error, and promised to return to the camp of\r\nthe faithful.\r\n\r\nIn common daily events of this kind lies the secret of the slow\r\nprogress of every social reform. Men who are momentarily enthusiastic\r\nnearly always expect everything to progress according to their\r\nimagination, and when they see that it will be some time before any\r\nobvious result is attained, they become discouraged, because they have\r\nneither the personal courage nor the perseverance to remain in a\r\nminority and wait. The same want of perseverance, courage and judgment\r\nis found in the education of children, and it will take a long time to\r\nenlighten people on this subject.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that we have lost sight of our subject in occupying\r\nourselves with the irradiation of love, which forms the object of\r\nsocial sentiments or ethics (vide Chapter V). But it is by exactly\r\nunderstanding and realizing this irradiation of love that we shall\r\ngradually suppress the unhealthy social aberrations of the sexual\r\nappetite, and prevent them doing harm, by guiding them in the path of\r\na healthy morality. It is not the severe external constraint of\r\nso-called moral laws, it is not by the threats or punishments of hell,\r\nnor the promise of paradise, nor the moral preachings of the priests,\r\nparents or pedagogues, nor an exalted asceticism, which can ever\r\nconstruct a healthy, just and lasting sexual ethics. It is not by\r\nwords that we recognize the value of moral precepts, but by their\r\nresults. It is quite certain that the sexual life of man can never\r\nrise above its present state without being freed from the bonds of\r\nmysticism and religious dogma, and based on a loyal and unequivocal\r\nhuman morality which will recognize the normal wants of humanity,\r\nalways having as its principal object the welfare of posterity.\r\n\r\nMarriage should be considered as a means of satisfying the sexual\r\nappetite, and at the same time a moral and social school of life; not\r\nas a refuge for egoism. Division of duties, absolute equality of\r\nrights and social work in common, will solidify more and more the\r\nsexual bonds of two conjoints. By the aid of a better understanding of\r\nthe wants of human society, the conjoints will learn how to overcome\r\ntheir egoistic sentiments, their polygamous inclinations, and their\r\njealousy, etc.\r\n\r\nIn striving for happiness, and especially for the sexual happiness of\r\nothers, such conjoints will learn better how to excuse and pardon the\r\nsexual failings of other men. They will cease to despise the poor\r\nman's household, the girl-mother, the divorced wife, the concubine,\r\neven the poor invert, and other failings in their fellow beings. On\r\nthe contrary, they will do their utmost to make their lot a happier\r\none, by helping all those for whom help may be efficacious. They will\r\nfind their greatest pleasure in this work, and if one of them becomes\r\nhimself the victim of some sexual failing, he will be pardoned all the\r\nmore easily, and will master it all the more quickly.\r\n\r\nThere will then be no time to make life bitter by bad temper, slander,\r\nacrimony, sulking and other conjugal disputes. The husband will no\r\nlonger behave with the despotism of a lord and master, and the wife\r\nwill no longer think it her duty to humble herself. Religious dogmas\r\nwill no longer separate man from woman. Priests will no longer be\r\nrequired in marriage. Lastly, there will be no more fear of death;\r\nthis will be regarded as a welcome rest after the long labor and duty\r\nfulfilled of a well-spent life.\r\n\r\nI cannot help taxing with narrow-mindedness, and even unintelligence,\r\npersons who consider such an ideal of life as a fantasy impossible to\r\nrealize, or as the product of exalted dreamers who do not know the\r\nworld. No doubt this ideal cannot be attained by ill-constructed,\r\nunnatural beings, tainted by a morbid heredity, or depraved by\r\nidleness, vice and passion for pleasure, who have lost their\r\nelasticity and plasticity of brain or have never possessed them. It\r\nhas, however, been often realized already by men and women of better\r\nquality. It is, therefore, necessary to act on the children, both by\r\neducation and selection, in order to obtain a youth of superior\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nLet us not abandon the future of our race to the fatalism of Allah;\r\nlet us create it ourselves!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] It is true that the friendly union of individuals of the same sex\r\nis often fundamentally derived from the phylogenetic development of\r\nanimal or human societies. But the sentiments of sympathy, on the sole\r\nbasis of which such friendly unions may be developed, are only\r\nthemselves the derivatives of the more primitive sentiments of\r\nsympathy of one individual for another, and these latter have\r\noriginated in sexual attraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE SEXUAL QUESTION IN POLITICS AND IN POLITICAL ECONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\nPower and money have always been the principal aims of politics.\r\nPolitical economy is a science which deals with the great family of\r\nnations and their conditions of existence. Based on history,\r\nstatistics and observation, it seeks for the laws which govern the\r\nproduction, consumption and division of goods, labor and its products,\r\nthe social organization of nations, their health, the increase or\r\ndecrease of the population, the death-rate, birth-rate, etc.\r\n\r\nI cannot here enter into the details of the domestic economy of the\r\nnation, as this is beyond my province. I may, however, point out that\r\nthis science has too much neglected the natural sciences, owing to its\r\ntraditional connection with politics.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 Cognetti de Martiis[11] had already attempted to apply the\r\nideas of evolution to political economy. Recently, Prof. Eugene\r\nSchwiedland of Vienna treated the same subject in an interesting study\r\nof the ideas of want and desire in human psychology.[12] So far, it is\r\nonly the quantity and not the quality of men which has been taken into\r\naccount, originating from the false idea that man made in God's image\r\ncan only come into the world in a perfect state. If he was often\r\nmalformed in body and mind, this was the fault of his sins. Even\r\nhereditary degeneration to the third and fourth generation was\r\nconsidered as divine punishment for the sins of the fathers on the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n=War.=--The despots of olden times, like those of to-day, have always\r\nregarded men as instruments of their ambition or even as food for\r\ncannon. When Napoleon I established a bounty for large families, he\r\nwas no doubt thinking of the number of soldiers he could make for the\r\nuse of his son. He had good reason to provide for the replenishment of\r\nthe ranks of his army. The mental quality of the individuals mattered\r\nlittle to him. Wars are a harmful factor in human selection, for they\r\ndestroy or mutilate the fittest in the prime of life, while leaving\r\nthe unfit and the aged.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we have already seen to what an extent the quality and even\r\nthe quantity of soldiers suffer from venereal disease and alcohol.\r\nAfter certain long wars the male population has been decimated to such\r\na point that polygamy had to be resorted to to reconstitute the\r\nnation. It is, therefore, obvious that wars have a bad influence on\r\nthe sexual relations of men, and hence on the quantity, or what is\r\nstill worse, the quality of a nation.\r\n\r\n=Statistics.=--Political economy is still more important. I do not\r\ndoubt the correctness of the figures which tell us that under this or\r\nthat economic system the population increases, while under another\r\nsystem it diminishes, etc. But these are only summary data whose true\r\ncauses remain in the dark. It is necessary to carefully study the\r\nfactors which produce these figures. Emigration and immigration with\r\ntheir causes, the intimate habits of individuals and families, their\r\nwillingness and aptitude for work, etc. One fact which follows another\r\nis not always the direct consequence of it and if we examine things\r\nmore closely, we arrive at curious results.\r\n\r\n=Alcohol.=--Things being otherwise equal, it is found that nations who\r\nabstain from alcohol and those who are moderate consumers are more\r\nprolific than nations who are addicted to drink. In Russia, for\r\ninstance, the abstainers, although of the same race and living under\r\nthe same conditions, are more prolific than their neighbors who drink.\r\n\r\nAs we have already pointed out, alcohol greatly deteriorates the\r\nquality of man by blastophthoria, and we must agree with men such as\r\nDarwin, Gladstone, Cobden, Comte, etc., that alcohol (even in\r\nso-called moderation) does more harm to a nation than war, plague and\r\nfamine together.\r\n\r\nWe find here an economic factor of the first order, to which the\r\nmajority of economists (with the exception of Cobden) are blind. It\r\nis a very short-sighted policy to regard the alcohol industry as a\r\nsource of wealth and welfare for nations. What an amount of labor,\r\nhuman power and valuable land is employed to produce this mischievous\r\nsubstance which, although useful in pharmacy and other industries,\r\nneither nourishes nor strengthens, but deteriorates the organism and\r\nleads to degeneration of the race! If it were not so sad, it would be\r\nridiculous to observe the serious way in which high officials, or even\r\nscientists, calculate the product of taxes on distilled and fermented\r\nliquors, the laws for their import and export, the monopoly of their\r\nmanufacture, etc. It is remarkable how the budget is balanced by the\r\naid of the alcoholic intoxication of the people, and how people are\r\nmade to believe that a masterpiece of political economy is thereby\r\nachieved. In reality, the health and strength of the nation are\r\nsacrificed. This kind of political economy can only be qualified as\r\nfalse and deceitful. We cannot too often nor too strongly stigmatize\r\nits destructive influence on sexual matters and on the hereditary\r\nenergies of humanity.\r\n\r\n=Density of Population.=--As regards the most desirable figures for\r\npopulation, opinions are diametrically opposed. Some authors look for\r\nthe happiness of humanity in prolific reproduction, and imagine that\r\nby utilizing all parts of the globe an unlimited number of people\r\ncould be supported by its produce.\r\n\r\nWe cannot regard with favor this singular Chinese-like ideal, which\r\nwould tend to transform the whole world into a huge cornfield for the\r\nraising of men like rabbits. Moreover, it is greatly to be feared that\r\nthe real Chinese, when they have become sufficiently armed and\r\nre-civilized, will transform the surface of the earth into a human\r\nstable, if we do not take sufficient precautions.\r\n\r\n=Neo-malthusianism.=--On the other hand, a certain group of idealists,\r\nthe neo-malthusianists, have declared a war of extermination against\r\nall increase of the population. I have myself been accused by one of\r\nthem of committing a crime by procreating more than four children!\r\nNeo-malthusianists of this kind only deal with quantity and do not\r\nconcern themselves with quality.\r\n\r\nThey recommend, as we do, the employment of anticonceptional\r\nmeasures, but they do so without any discrimination. They address\r\nthemselves to the altruistic and intelligent portion of the public,\r\nand induce the most useful members of society to procreate as little\r\nas possible, without recognizing that with their system, not only the\r\nChinese and negroes, but, among European races, the most incapable and\r\namoral classes of the population are those who trouble the least about\r\ntheir maximum number of children. Hence, the result they obtain is\r\nexactly the opposite of what they intend.\r\n\r\nAmong the North Americans and New Zealanders, with whom\r\nneo-malthusianism is very prevalent, the number of births among the\r\nintelligent classes is diminishing to an alarming extent, while the\r\nChinese and negroes multiply exceedingly. In France, the practice of\r\nneo-malthusianism is chiefly due to reasons of economy.\r\n\r\n=Rational Selection.=--These two extremes, which are equally absurd,\r\nshould be replaced by rational selection. Neo-malthusianism should be\r\nconfined to the unfit of all kinds, and to the lower races. On the\r\ncontrary, the fit should be urged to multiply as much as possible. By\r\nthis means we obtain an indirect factor of the first order for a\r\nrational political economy; I even maintain that it is the most\r\nimportant of all. No doubt its action is extremely slow, and it would\r\ntake centuries to obtain a definite result. But if the principle of\r\nproper human selection ever prevails, we may confidently hope for a\r\ngood future for our descendants.\r\n\r\nA time will come when the human population of the earth will become\r\nmore or less stationary. If, in the meantime, human nature has\r\nsucceeded in appreciably improving its quality, and in gradually\r\nsuppressing the physical and mental proletariat with its poverty,\r\nhunger and brutality, which now infests the world--then only will the\r\ndogmas of our modern neo-malthusianists acquire a certain object for\r\nthe whole world.\r\n\r\nIf humanity does not soon begin to degenerate by brutish accumulation,\r\nbut finds in time the means to gradually elevate its quality, our\r\nfuture descendants will take care not to abandon rational selection. A\r\ncapable and active man gives to society much more than he receives,\r\nand thus forms an economic asset. A person who is unfit in body or\r\nmind, receives more than he gives, and thus constitutes an economic\r\ndeficit.\r\n\r\n=Contrary Selection.=--We have seen in Chapter VI how certain customs\r\nof essentially human origin ended by becoming part of religion.\r\nUnfortunately for humanity, religion and politics have at all times\r\ngenerally combined to do wrong. The celibacy of priests (to say\r\nnothing of the Inquisition, religious wars, and the fatalism of Islam)\r\nwhich is based on a kind of religious politics, has largely resulted\r\nin sterilizing the more intelligent among Catholic races.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of inquiry into paternity is another abominable custom\r\nof the same kind introduced by Napoleon. Laws of this nature lead to\r\nartificial abortion and encourage promiscuous intercourse. The safety\r\nof families and sexual intercourse lies in the duties of parents\r\ntoward their children.\r\n\r\nThe principal task of a political economy which has the true happiness\r\nof men at heart, should be to encourage the procreation of happy,\r\nuseful, healthy and hard-working individuals. To build an\r\never-increasing number of hospitals, asylums for lunatics, idiots and\r\nincurables, reformatories, etc.; to provide them with every comfort,\r\nand manage them scientifically, is no doubt a very fine thing, and\r\nspeaks well of the progress and development of human sympathy. But,\r\nwhat is forgotten, is that by concerning ourselves almost exclusively\r\nwith human ruins, the results of our social abuses, we gradually\r\nweaken the forces of the healthy portion of the population.\r\n\r\nBy attacking the roots of the evil and limiting the procreation of the\r\nunfit, we shall be performing a work which is much more humanitarian,\r\nif less striking in its effect.\r\n\r\nFormerly, our economists and politicians hardly ever considered this\r\nquestion, and even now very few are interested in it, because it\r\nbrings neither honors nor money, as we do not ourselves see the fruits\r\nof such efforts. Any one who aims at serious reforms and puts his hand\r\nto the work is looked upon as eccentric, or even mad. This is why we\r\nare contented with the kind of humanitarianism which makes a show and\r\npanders to the sentimentality of the masses, by holding out a\r\ncharitable hand to the visible and audible evils which make women\r\nweep. In short, we amuse ourselves with repairing the ruins, but are\r\nafraid of attacking what makes these ruins!\r\n\r\n=The Laws of Lycurgus.=--There was once in Sparta a great legislator\r\nnamed Lycurgus, who attempted to introduce a kind of human selection\r\ninto the laws. He wished to make the Spartans a strong nation, because\r\nat that time bodily strength was almost the only ideal of the people.\r\nHe understood the value of hardness but not that of work. The\r\nimportance of selective elimination of the diseased and weak was\r\napparent to his pre-Darwinian intuition, but in his time natural laws\r\nwere not understood. However, in spite of their failings, the laws of\r\nLycurgus succeeded up to a certain point in making the Spartans a\r\nstrong nation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the laws of Lycurgus, the Spartan inherited no property,\r\nand was forbidden all luxury. He had to eat his simple black broth\r\nwith his fellows, and to exercise himself continually in trials of\r\nstrength and skill. Every Spartan had to marry, and the bonds of\r\nmatrimony were strictly observed. Every weak child was eliminated. But\r\nthere were two fundamental errors in the Spartan organization.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the Spartan was a warrior, but not a worker, and\r\nalthough hardened, was an aristocrat. He left all labor to his slaves,\r\nand in this way strengthened his slaves and enfeebled himself in many\r\nrespects. The value of work in strengthening and developing the brain\r\nand the whole body was not then understood.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, all the efforts of the Spartans were directed\r\ntoward muscular strength, bodily skill, courage, and simple wants, but\r\nnot at all toward a life of higher intelligence or ideal sentiments.\r\nThe exclusiveness with which they only promoted man's bodily\r\ndevelopment, while neglecting his intellect, their negligence of the\r\nlaws of organic evolution due to ignorance of natural science, would\r\nsooner or later have led to the decay of the Spartans.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not the laws of Lycurgus in themselves, but their\r\nabandonment, which was the direct cause of the decadence of Sparta.\r\nThe Spartans only sought for power, and this led to envy and jealousy,\r\na deplorable although indirect result of the exclusiveness of their\r\nlaws. These laws, however, will always constitute a unique historical\r\ndocument, a remarkable attempt at human selection.\r\n\r\nWe are at the present day incomparably better armed intellectually\r\nthan Lycurgus to deal with the question of selection. What is chiefly\r\nwanting is initiative on the part of the men who are charged with the\r\ngovernment of their fellows. They are so deeply absorbed in economic\r\ninterests and rival influences, that all desire of aspiring to a\r\nhigher social ideal is paralyzed and etiolated in them. We require a\r\npowerful social shaking if we are to make steady progress.\r\n\r\n=Politics and the Sexual Question.=--\"_Cherchez la femme_\" is the\r\ncommon expression when anything unusual occurs in society. It would be\r\nmore correct to say \"Look for the sexual motive!\" The actions of men\r\nare determined much more by their passions and sentiments than by\r\npurely intellectual reflection, _i.e._, by reason and logic.\r\n\r\nBut no sentiment is stronger than the direct sexual sentiment, or its\r\nderivatives--love, jealousy and hatred. From this results a fact which\r\nsocial systems have too much neglected, namely: that in all the\r\ndomains of human social activity, the sexual passions and their\r\npsychic irradiations often interact directly or indirectly in a\r\nmischievous way. Mistresses and courtesans have always played a\r\nconsiderable part in political intrigue.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to have such a tragic scandal as that which caused\r\nthe assassination of the king and queen of Servia. Everyday\r\ninfluences, even the smallest and most dissimulated, are often the\r\nmost efficacious. Sexual intrigues have at all times influenced and\r\ndirected the fate of nations. History relates a number of cases of\r\nthis kind, but there are many more which have never been revealed to\r\nthe public. It is sufficient to mention this fact. Every one who\r\nreflects will find an illustration of it, in the history of the past\r\nas well as in the politics of the present, in the courts of monarchs\r\nand in small democracies, in the local history of provinces, in his\r\nown parish, and lastly among his own relatives, friends and\r\nacquaintances.\r\n\r\n=Sexual Life in Social Action.=--The socialist who said that the\r\nsocial question was exclusively a question of stomach mistook its\r\nscope as well as human psychology. However admirably the economic\r\nrelations of men and their work may be regulated, the introduction of\r\nsexual passions into social life will never be eliminated. All that\r\ncan be done is to give both sexes an education which will elevate\r\ntheir social conscience and attenuate the evil influences exercised by\r\npersonal sexual sentiments on social actions.\r\n\r\nThe sexual question, therefore, intervenes in politics and in the\r\nwhole of social life. Moreover, if the deplorable social influence of\r\nmoney and the attraction it exerts could be eliminated, antisocial\r\nacts, which only depend indirectly on the sexual passions, would lose\r\nmuch of their danger and infamy.\r\n\r\n=The Rôle of Women.=--Here again, much may be expected from the free\r\nemancipation of woman, and from her work in social questions in\r\nconjunction with man. This work in common will make them more clearly\r\nunderstand the high importance of their social task. Then sexual life\r\nwill encourage social development instead of hindering it; it will\r\ncease to be considered as an egoistic pleasure but as a means of\r\nprocreation, and will become the acme of an existence founded on the\r\njoy of work.\r\n\r\nWe can already see, in countries where women have a vote, that they\r\nknow very well how to benefit by social progress. If it is objected\r\nthat woman is more conservative and more routine than man, I reply\r\nthat this inconvenience is compensated by the fact that she is on the\r\nwhole more inclined to enthusiasm, and to be led by noble masculine\r\nnatures, who have the sense of the ideal, than by others (vide Chapter\r\nV). Her great perseverance and courage are also inestimable qualities\r\nfor social work which aims at true progress.\r\n\r\n=Necessity and Desire.=--In the work which I have already quoted,\r\nSchwiedland points out the need for distinguishing between necessity\r\nand desire, in political economy. In practice it is no doubt difficult\r\nto always make an exact distinction between necessity and luxury. What\r\nour ancestors considered as luxuries we now regard as necessities. Man\r\nknows no limits in his desires; he is insatiable in his passion for\r\npleasure and change. Certain socialists, especially anarchists, make a\r\ngreat mistake in proclaiming the right of man to satisfy all his\r\ndesires. This is a proclamation of corruption and degeneration. As it\r\nis just to exact the right to satisfaction of the natural wants of\r\neach, so is it unjust to sanction every desire and every appetite.\r\n\r\nIt is a question of distinguishing between good and useful wants and\r\nevil desires. All wants which promote a healthy life, all instincts\r\nwhich lead to social work, are good. All desires, which damage the\r\nhealth and life of the individual or injure the rights and welfare of\r\nsociety, are bad, and are the procreators of luxury, excessive\r\nconcupiscence, and often corruption. Between these two extremes there\r\nare desires which are more or less indifferent, for example, that of\r\npossessing objects of beauty.\r\n\r\nCertain objects of human desire are harmful in themselves, such as the\r\nuse of alcoholic liquor and narcotics. Others are only harmful when\r\npushed to excess, such as good living, sexual pleasures, personal\r\nadornment, etc. Among the things desired by man, sexual pleasure plays\r\na great part. Thus, when a pasha or a sultan provides himself with a\r\nlarge number of women, this excess is harmful from the social point of\r\nview, as it injures the rights of others. I have sufficiently dwelt on\r\nthis fact elsewhere. I wish only to indicate here, with Schwiedland,\r\nhow necessary it is to fix the limits between necessities and desires\r\nfrom the point of view of political economy, however relative and\r\nsubjective these limits may be.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] \"Le forme primitive nella evoluzione economia.\"\r\n\r\n[12] \"Die psychologischen Grundlagen der Wirtschaft.\" _Zeitschrift für\r\nSozialwissenschaft_, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE SEXUAL QUESTION IN PEDAGOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n=Heredity and Education.=--If we review the facts contained in\r\nChapters IV, VI, VII and VIII, we must conclude that the sexual\r\nappetite, sensations and sentiments of every human being consist of\r\ntwo groups of elements: (1) _phylogenetic_ or hereditary (hereditary\r\nmneme); and (2) elements _acquired_ during life by the combined action\r\nof external agents and habit or custom.\r\n\r\nThe first lie dormant in the organism for a time, in the form of\r\nlatent energies or dispositions, and form part of what is called\r\n_character_. Most of them do not disclose themselves till the age of\r\npuberty, and their development afterwards takes place under the\r\ninfluence of external stimuli, which are modified by the will of the\r\nindividual, _i.e._, by his brain.\r\n\r\nThe second are the result of the influence excited by erotic\r\nexcitations and habit on the first.\r\n\r\nPedagogy can in no way change the first, for they are predetermined,\r\nand constitute the soil to be cultivated by education. The task of the\r\nlatter can, therefore, only be to guide the hereditary sexual\r\ndispositions into paths as healthy and useful as possible. In the case\r\nof perverse dispositions, such as homosexual appetites, sadism, etc.,\r\nmoral education can only act in a general way on the character, and\r\ncombat that which excites the appetites. It cannot change the\r\ncharacter of the latter; there must be no illusion on this point.\r\nWherever hereditary dispositions present a normal average, education\r\ncan do much to avoid pathological errors and habits, by guiding the\r\nsexual appetite in a healthy direction and by avoiding excess.\r\n\r\n=Sexual Education of Children.=--Habit always diminishes the erotic\r\neffect of certain perceptions of the senses; and inversely, eroticism\r\nor sexual desire is especially excited by unaccustomed perceptions\r\nand images relating to the other sex. The adult, unfortunately, nearly\r\nalways makes the same error in pedagogy; he unconsciously attributes\r\nhis own adult sentiments to the child. What excites the sexual desire\r\nof an adult is quite indifferent to a child. It is, therefore,\r\npossible to speak plainly to children to a certain extent on sexual\r\nquestions, without exciting them in the least; on the contrary, if the\r\nchild becomes accustomed to consider sexual intercourse as something\r\nquite natural, this will excite his curiosity to a much less degree\r\nlater on, because it has lost the spice of novelty.\r\n\r\nIf the child is accustomed to the sight of nudity in adults of his own\r\nsex, he will see nothing peculiar in his own sexual organs and pubic\r\nhairs when these develop. On the other hand, children brought up with\r\nstrict prudery and in complete ignorance of sexual matters, often\r\nbecome greatly excited when their pubic hairs develop; they feel\r\nashamed and at the same time erotic. When they are not prepared, girls\r\nbecome still more excited at the first appearance of menstruation, and\r\nboys at their first seminal emission. The mystery which is made of\r\neverything relating to sexual matters is not only a source of anxiety\r\nto children, but also excites their curiosity and the first signs of\r\neroticism, so that they generally end by being instructed on the\r\nsubject by other depraved children, by observing copulation among\r\nanimals, or by obscene books, in a manner which is certainly not\r\nfavorable to healthy development. What is still worse is that the\r\nchild is generally instructed at the same time in masturbation,\r\nprostitution, and sometimes even sexual perversion.\r\n\r\nThe so-called innocence, or naïve ignorance, of an adolescent\r\npossesses quite a peculiar charm of attraction for libertines of both\r\nsexes, who find a refined erotic pleasure, a unique relish, in the\r\nseduction of the innocent, in the role of \"initiator in the sexual\r\nart.\" Parents, unfortunately, seldom realize the evil consequences of\r\ntheir passiveness, I will even say cowardice, in making use of\r\nsubterfuge, pretext and falsehood, to elude the naïve questions of\r\ntheir children concerning sexual matters. I will here quote the\r\nopinion of an enlightened mother of a family, Madame Schmid-Jager, an\r\nopinion with which I entirely agree:\r\n\r\n    \"All mothers, or nearly all, bring up their daughters with a\r\n    view to matrimony. Can we pretend that they are properly\r\n    prepared for it? Alas! no; the most elementary knowledge which\r\n    should be possessed by the future wife and mother is neglected,\r\n    and for centuries our young girls have been married in more or\r\n    less complete ignorance of their natural functions and duties.\r\n    The slaves of routine will reply that it has always been so,\r\n    that the world has been none the worse for it, and that women\r\n    when once married have always learnt by personal experience all\r\n    that was necessary. No doubt they are sometimes taught to cook\r\n    and sew and to do household work, but they are told nothing\r\n    concerning their sexual functions, nor of the consequences of\r\n    these. At Zurich a school has been instituted for nurses and\r\n    midwives which will soon give good results. This school is also\r\n    open to young girls who, without becoming professional nurses,\r\n    desire to learn how to take care of the sick in their own\r\n    families, and especially the newly born. This is an experiment\r\n    worthy of encouragement which should be extended universally.\r\n\r\n    \"The awkwardness, incapacity and ignorance of a young wife, when\r\n    she starts housekeeping and has a baby, are astonishing. She\r\n    often pays dearly for it, in spite of the instinct which is so\r\n    much talked about. It is not the same as with animals, whose\r\n    instincts are sufficient for the care of the young.\r\n\r\n    \"A lady doctor of Zurich, Madame Hilfiker, has lately developed\r\n    a scheme of much greater importance, which will require a great\r\n    effort on the part of women and the intervention of legislation,\r\n    if it is to be realized. Men, she says, maintain their muscular\r\n    strength by military service. Every young woman, who is not\r\n    prevented by her occupation, should perform the equivalent of\r\n    military service, from the age of eighteen, in obligatory\r\n    service for a year, in hospitals, asylums, maternities,\r\n    _crèches_ (public nurseries) or public kitchens. Such training\r\n    would be extremely useful for future wives, and would at the\r\n    same time provide the institutions in question with useful\r\n    workers. Why should men be the only ones to perform obligatory\r\n    social service? I expect,\" says Madame Schmid, \"many adverse\r\n    criticisms on this proposal, one of which I will refute at\r\n    once. The ladies of the middle classes will strongly object\r\n    because their daughters will see and hear so many things which\r\n    ought to be hidden till they marry! But why should they be\r\n    hidden? In order to prepare our daughters for marriage, is it\r\n    not logical to begin by telling them what it is, what it\r\n    involves and what it exacts?\" (\"_L'Education sociale de nos\r\n    filles_,\" 1904.)\r\n\r\nIn neglecting this duty our parents and teachers commit a veritable\r\ncrime. Does a normal man ever marry without knowing what he is doing?\r\nYet our young girls are kept by their mothers in insensate and often\r\ndangerous ignorance of their whole future. Whoever invented this\r\nabsurd and mischievous idea that a young girl should remain ignorant\r\nof her natural functions till the moment when she has bound herself\r\nfor life to fulfill them? The law punishes persons who cause others to\r\nenter into contracts, while intentionally concealing the true\r\nconditions. This might almost equally well apply to parents who allow\r\ntheir daughters to marry in ignorance. Some women reply to this that\r\nmarriage would be too sad and would have little attraction if it were\r\nnot preceded by any illusion. Certain illusions which are natural to\r\nyouth may be healthy, but the fantastic dreams which are in evident\r\ncontradiction with reality, and nearly always followed by disillusion,\r\nare bad. A young woman who has always lived in a state of\r\ntranscendental idealism till her marriage, infallibly courts\r\ndisappointment, deception and heart-break. A wiser education would\r\noften succeed in sparing young women from this sudden and cruel\r\ndisillusion. The moral level of men would also be raised if their\r\nfuture wives were better instructed in sexual matters, and exacted\r\nthat the past life of their future husbands should give a better\r\nguarantee for the future.\r\n\r\nIt must, moreover, be understood that blind and obstinate resistance\r\nto new ideas serves no purpose. Our manners and customs change in\r\nspite of us; our girls will no longer allow themselves to be led\r\nblindly, but will seek more and more freedom. Would it not be wiser to\r\ntake things in time and warn them of the dangers ahead? With\r\nincredible carelessness parents send their daughters into service\r\nabroad, without considering that they may be at the mercy of the\r\nfirst Don Juan who comes across them, or even fall into the meshes of\r\n\"white slavery,\" if they are left to go in ignorance of sexual\r\naffairs, as is often the case (vide Chapter X). Moreover, by no longer\r\ntaking a false and artificial view of life, girls will be more capable\r\nof understanding and sympathizing with the misery which surrounds\r\nthem--the troubles of unfortunate marriages, seduced and abandoned\r\ngirls, etc. What they lose in illusion they will gain in more useful\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nHow are we to begin? We should certainly not wait till the eve of\r\nmarriage, but begin in childhood. In theory, it is wrong to lie to\r\nchildren, if they are to maintain unshaken confidence in their\r\nparents, and remain truthful themselves. No doubt we cannot explain\r\neverything to a child at the age when it begins to ask its mother\r\ncertain embarrassing questions, but we should endeavor as far as\r\npossible to tell it the truth in a manner suitable to its age. When\r\nthis is impossible, every child who knows that no reasonable\r\nexplanation is ever refused it will be satisfied with the answer: \"You\r\nare too young now to understand that; I will tell you when you are\r\nolder.\" Every child who speaks openly to its mother asks sooner or\r\nlater how children come into the world. It is easier to reply to this\r\nwhen the child has had the opportunity of observing the same thing in\r\nanimals. Why should the mother conceal the fact that it is nearly the\r\nsame in man as in animals? The child never thinks of blushing or\r\nlaughing at natural phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe initiation of children into the mechanism of reproduction is best\r\nobtained by the study of botany and zoölogy. If no mystery is made of\r\nthese things in the case of plants and animals, why should not\r\ninstruction be given in human reproduction? On this point Madame\r\nSchmid remarks as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The father or the master should instruct the boys in this subject,\r\nand the mother or mistress the girls. Parents will then be able more\r\neasily to abandon their old and absurd prejudices, which they\r\npreserve, not so much because they attach any great importance to\r\nthem, but because they shrink from the difficulty of explaining\r\nthemselves to their children. We often see mothers, who would never\r\nhave touched on the question with a child still ignorant of sexual\r\nmatters, abandon the reserve hitherto observed in their language in\r\nthe presence of the child, as soon as they perceive that it has become\r\nmore or less acquainted with sexual phenomena. This is quite\r\ncharacteristic, and what is more so is that these mothers, and often\r\nalso the fathers, frequently make equivocal jokes on the subject with\r\ntheir children instead of seriously discussing it.\r\n\r\n\"It is regrettable that so few pedagogues take up these questions, and\r\nthat the instruction of children on the sexual question is left to the\r\nmost impure sources--domestic servants, depraved companions,\r\npornographic books, etc. This results in a deplorable estrangement\r\nbetween the children and their parents or masters, which destroys\r\nmutual confidence.\r\n\r\n\"If we wish to contend with sexual perversions acquired at an early\r\nage, or the precocious development of an unhealthy sexual appetite,\r\nthis is not to be effected by prudery or vague moral preaching, but by\r\naffection and frankness. In this case, evasive replies, combined with\r\nso-called strict morals, only lead to estrangement, dissimulation and\r\nhypocrisy, and the result is often irreparable.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Schmid also insists on the necessity of making young girls work\r\nand learn some business, so as to render them capable of surviving in\r\nthe struggle for existence without being obliged to throw themselves\r\nat the head of the first man who presents himself, or becoming the\r\nprey of prostitution. She also emphasizes the necessity of\r\nremunerating the wife for her work as mother and housekeeper, as the\r\nhusband is remunerated for his work.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to add that it is quite as necessary to instruct boys\r\nas girls in sexual questions. They do not run the risk, like girls, of\r\nfalling through ignorance into the abject dependence of a forced\r\nmarriage, and have no pregnancies to fear; but they are more exposed\r\nto temptation. When their sexual appetite has been once excited by\r\nmasturbation or in some other way, it becomes very difficult to put\r\nthem on the right path; to say nothing of the danger of venereal\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nI therefore appeal to all fathers and masters in the same way that\r\nMadame Schmid appeals to mothers and mistresses Take measures in time\r\nand do not wait till the boys are instructed by evil persons of either\r\nsex, or till they have already been seduced, thanks to their erotic\r\ncuriosity. It is generally evil companions who seduce them, but\r\nsometimes erotic women.\r\n\r\n=Exclusiveness in Education. Punishment. Automatism of Parents. Wants\r\nof Children.=--In the human brain, intelligence and sentiment are\r\nintimately connected with one another, and from their combination\r\narise volitions, which in their turn, react more or less strongly on\r\ncerebral activity, according to their solidity and duration. It is\r\nthus a great mistake to think that we can treat separately, by the aid\r\nof theoretical dogmas, the three great domains of the human\r\nmind--intelligence, sentiment and will. It is a fundamental error to\r\nimagine that the intelligence can be educated only at school, leaving\r\nsentiment and will to the parents. But it is still more absurd to\r\nattempt to act on sentiment, especially on ethical sentiment, and on\r\nthe conscience, which is derived directly from sympathy, by moral\r\npreaching and punishment. What false conceptions of the human mind lie\r\nin these moral sermons, in this theoretical moral teaching, in these\r\npunishments and anger! Is it credible that, by the aid of abstract and\r\narid dogmas supported by punishment, conscience and altruistic\r\nsentiments can be impressed on the brain of a child, which is only\r\naccessible to concrete ideas, to sympathy, affection and amusement? We\r\nmay see daily, in nearly every family, parents finding fault with\r\ntheir children, in a vexatious, irritated or sorrowful tone of voice,\r\nto which the children reply by inattention, or tears, or more often by\r\na repetition of the same tone of irritation. These scoldings pass\r\nthrough the child's mind without leaving any trace of an effect. Such\r\nstereotyped scenes produce in the intelligent observer the painful\r\nimpression of two barrel-organs whose tunes are automatic. If this is\r\nthe kind of moral teaching which is supposed to act on the child's\r\nmind, it is not astonishing that it has futile and even harmful\r\neffects. The parents do not appreciate the fact that when scolding\r\ntheir children they are only giving vent to their own bad temper. But\r\nthe children are well aware of this fact, consciously or not, and\r\nreact accordingly. The most deplorable thing is that they copy all\r\nthese bad habits, like monkeys.\r\n\r\nTrue moral teaching, the true way of influencing children for good,\r\nlies in the manner of speaking to them, treating them and living with\r\nthem. Affection, truth, persuasion and perseverance should be manifest\r\nin the acts and manners of parents, for these qualities only can\r\nawaken sympathy and confidence in the breasts of children. It is not\r\ncold moral speech, but warm altruistic feeling, which alone can act as\r\na moral educator of children.\r\n\r\nA savant who delivers excellent and erudite lectures to his pupils in\r\na dry and wearisome manner teaches them nothing, or at any rate very\r\nlittle. The students yawn, and are quite right in saying they could\r\nlearn these things just as well out of a book. A teacher, however, who\r\nspeaks with animation and knows how to hold the attention of his\r\naudience impresses his remarks on their brain. In the former case\r\nthere is intelligence without feeling, while in the latter case the\r\naudience is held by the suggestive and contagious power of enthusiasm.\r\nDry science, at the most, fills the memory, but it leaves \"the heart\"\r\nempty. What does not come from the heart has difficulty in entering\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely in this way that the will must be exercised by\r\nperseverance. The child must be made eager for social work; he must be\r\nurged to all noble and disinterested actions, without stimulating his\r\nemulation by promises of reward, or by punishment.\r\n\r\n=New Schools.=--The object we desire may be attained by a system of\r\neducation such as that of the new schools (_Landerziehungsheime_),\r\nwhich were first founded by Reddie in England, afterwards by Lietz in\r\nGermany, by Frey and Zuberuübler in Switzerland, and by Contou in\r\nFrance. These institutes have finally realized the ideas of Rousseau,\r\nPestalozzi, Owen and Froebel.\r\n\r\nFor the teacher who understands the psychology of children, it is a\r\ntrue pleasure to witness the teaching at these Landerziehungsheime.\r\nThe children take a delight in their school and become the comrades of\r\ntheir master. Physical exercise, the development of the powers of\r\nreason and judgment, the education of the sentiments and will, are all\r\nharmoniously combined. The children are not given the dry text-books\r\nof our schools, but made familiar with the works of the great authors\r\nand men of genius. Instead of their existence becoming etiolated under\r\nthe weight of domestic duties, and under the sword of Damocles of\r\nexaminations, they thrive by living as far as possible among the\r\nthings they ought to learn. They thus assimilate the object of\r\ninstruction, which becomes a living and useful part of their\r\npersonality, instead of becoming encysted in the brain in the form of\r\ndead erudition like a foreign body, and filling it with formulæ learnt\r\nby heart. Such formulæ are ill-understood by children, and later on it\r\nis difficult for them to clear their brains of this indigestible\r\nrubbish to make room for the realities of observation and induction.\r\nThe only punishments at the Landerziehungsheime are those which\r\nnaturally result from the fault committed.\r\n\r\nThe pupils and their masters bathe together in a state of nature. The\r\nsexual question is treated openly in these schools in a proper,\r\nnatural and logical way. The open confidence which obtains between\r\nmasters and pupils, combined with free intellectual and physical work\r\nand the absolute exclusion of alcoholic drinks, constitute the best\r\npreventive and curative remedy for masturbation, sexual precocity and\r\nall perversions which are not hereditary.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that such schools cannot cure a pathological\r\nsexual hereditary mneme, whether it consists in perversion, precocity\r\nor some other vice. Every boarding school has its drawbacks, on\r\naccount of the possible influence of mischievous individuals.\r\nNevertheless, no boarding school offers such excellent conditions as\r\nthe Landerziehungsheime, for as soon as a boy gives evidence of any\r\nsexual perversion, this perversion soon becomes well known, thanks to\r\nthe good sense which prevails in the whole school.[13]\r\n\r\n=Standard of Human Value in the Child.=--Our pedagogy has hitherto not\r\nunderstood the true standard of human value. The social value of a\r\nman is composed of two groups of factors; mental and bodily hereditary\r\ndispositions, and faculties acquired by education and instruction.\r\nWithout sufficient hereditary dispositions, all efforts expended in\r\nlearning a certain subject will generally fail more or less. Without\r\ninstruction and without exercise, the best hereditary dispositions\r\nwill become atrophied, or will give indifferent results. But\r\nhereditary dispositions not only influence the different domains of\r\nknowledge, as the traditional pedagogues of our public schools seem to\r\nadmit, they also act on all the domains of human life, especially on\r\nthe mind. Good dispositions in the domains of will, sentiment,\r\njudgment, imagination, perseverance, duty, accuracy, self-control, the\r\nfaculty of thinking logically and distinguishing the true from the\r\nfalse, the faculty of combining æsthetic thoughts and sensations, all\r\nconstitute human values which are much superior to the faculty of\r\nrapid assimilation or receptivity, and a good memory for words and\r\nphrases.\r\n\r\nNevertheless these last faculties are almost the only ones which are\r\ntaken into consideration in our examinations, which decide nearly\r\neverything in our schools and universities. Is it to be wondered at\r\nthat, by the aid of such a false standard, mediocrities whose brains\r\nare only the echoes of their masters and those who bow to authority,\r\nclimb to the highest official positions, and even to most of those\r\npositions which are not official?\r\n\r\nWith a good memory and the gift of rapid comprehension, one can obtain\r\neverything, even without the protection of the clergy, freemasonry or\r\nany other powerful association or personality (male or female)! If\r\nthey do not possess these natural secondary gifts, the most capable\r\nmen, even men of genius, are passed over or only obtain a situation by\r\ncircuitous routes and great efforts, after much loss of time.\r\n\r\nIn the Landerziehungsheime, Dr. Hermann-Lietz uses a scale intended to\r\nestimate the psychological and social value of the pupils. First of\r\nall the results obtained from two standards are measured:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Individual_: Does the actual value of work performed by the\r\npupil always correspond to his faculties?\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Objective_: Is the work very good, good, mediocre or bad,\r\ncompared with the normal human average?\r\n\r\nAfter this the different domains of psychology and human activity are\r\npassed in review, a thing which is quite possible in a school of this\r\nkind whose object is to carry out the integral education of man.\r\n\r\n1. _Bodily results_: Health, disease, weight of body, activity,\r\nwalking, running, swimming, cycling, games, ski, gymnastics.\r\n\r\n2. _Conduct_: Order, cleanliness, punctuality. Conduct outside, etc.\r\n\r\n3. _Moral and religious results_: Conduct toward parents, masters,\r\ncompanions, self and others. Veracity, zeal and sentiment of duty;\r\nhonesty in the administration of his personal property and that\r\nentrusted to him; sentiment of solidarity and disinterestedness. Is\r\nthe pupil worthy of trust? Is he conscientious? Strength of moral\r\nsentiments, moral comprehension and moral will.\r\n\r\n4. _Intellectual results_: Practical work; gardening, agriculture,\r\ncarpentry, turning, locksmith's work, work in forge. Drawing, writing,\r\nelocution, music. Knowledge of literature and human nature, physics,\r\nmathematics and natural science.\r\n\r\n5. _General results_: Strength of character, physique and\r\nintelligence; faculty of observation, imagination and judgment. Real\r\nvalue of practical work, artistic and scientific.\r\n\r\nMeasured by such a standard, the human value of a pupil takes quite\r\nanother character to that judged by the results of examinations. By\r\nmeans of this standard, it is possible to predict with much more\r\ncertainty what kind of man the child will become. There is no need to\r\nadd that there are no examinations in these schools, for the whole\r\nlife is a perpetual examination.\r\n\r\nSamuel Smiles, in \"_Self Help_\" relates that Swift failed in his\r\nexaminations, that James Watt (the discoverer of the motive power of\r\nsteam), Stephenson and Newton were bad pupils, that an Edinburgh\r\nprofessor regarded Walter Scott as a dunce. [The same with Darwin, who\r\nsays in his autobiography, \"When I left the school I was, for my age,\r\nneither high nor low in it, and I believe that I was considered by all\r\nmy masters and by my father as a very ordinary boy, rather below the\r\ncommon standard in intellect.\"] These examples of the way in which the\r\nschool of tradition judges human mental value might be multiplied a\r\nhundredfold, but they will suffice, especially if we compare them with\r\nthe future of the distinguished pupils of colleges in practical life.\r\nThese facts are not due so much to later development, as to the\r\ndisgust inspired by our system of education in reflective minds which\r\nrefuse to be overloaded with a heap of dry things learnt by heart,\r\nundigested, often hardly comprehensible, or open to contradiction.\r\n\r\nIt is only on the basis of a just evaluation of man, from all points\r\nof view, that we can found a proper human selection.\r\n\r\n=Coeducation.=--It is now beginning to be understood that the\r\ncoeducation of the two sexes in schools, not only does no harm, but is\r\nvery advantageous, both from the sexual and the moral points of view.\r\nIn the universities it is already established. In children's schools\r\nand many primary schools it has always existed. It is especially the\r\nauthorities of secondary schools who have raised opposition.\r\n\r\nIn the secondary schools in Holland and Italy, as well as in some\r\nSwiss gymnasiums, coeducation has been introduced without the least\r\ninconvenience; on the contrary, it has led to the best results.\r\n\r\nA native of Finland, Miss Maikki Friberg, has lately made an appeal in\r\nfavor of coeducation based on the excellent results obtained in her\r\ncountry. Some feared that sexual excitement would result; but this is\r\nan error, for the custom of daily co-existence of the sexes diminishes\r\nthe sexual appetite. The forbidden fruit loses its charm as soon as it\r\nappears no longer to be forbidden!\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say that it is not intended that girls and boys\r\nshould sleep in the same dormitories, nor bathe together in the\r\ncostume of Adam and Eve! Our remarks do not apply to boarding-schools,\r\nbut to coeducation in public schools.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of coeducation, we generally meet with the argument that\r\nthe nature and vocation of women differ from those of men, and that\r\nconsequently their education ought to differ. To this I reply as\r\nfollows: The external objects of the world, the branches of human\r\nknowledge, in fact the subjects for study and instruction, are the\r\nsame for both sexes. It is, therefore, both a useless waste of forces\r\nand an injustice to organize an inferior education for women.\r\n\r\n=Instruction in Coeducation.=--A course of instruction as interesting\r\nas possible should be organized for each subject, without distinction\r\nof sex. This rule should also apply to things which are generally\r\nconsidered as the special province of women; such as sewing,\r\ndressmaking, cooking, household work, etc. It will then be the\r\nbusiness of each sex to choose the subject most suited to its\r\nabilities.\r\n\r\nPart of the course of instruction should be obligatory for all, while\r\nanother part intended for ulterior individual development should be\r\noptional, according to individual taste and talent. In the obligatory\r\npart of instruction certain subjects might be made obligatory for one\r\nsex and optional for the other; sewing and algebra, for instance. In\r\nthis way each sex could choose the most suitable subjects, as is the\r\ncase now in universities only.\r\n\r\n=Danger of Sexual Perversions.=--A very important point, unfortunately\r\nlittle understood in sexual pedagogy, is that of congenital sexual\r\nperversions. Tradition regards every sexual anomaly as an acquired\r\nvice, which should be treated by indignation and punishment. The\r\neffects of this manner of looking at the question are disastrous. It\r\ngives entirely wrong ideas to youth, and shuts the eyes of parents and\r\nteachers to the truth.\r\n\r\nIt is not without a serious motive that I have described at length the\r\nrepugnant phenomena of sexual pathology (Chapter VIII). Teachers and\r\nparents should be thoroughly acquainted with this subject. But this is\r\nnot enough, for these phenomena commence in infancy. It is a long time\r\nbefore the child whose sexual appetite is perverted has the least idea\r\nthat his inclinations and desires are considered by others as\r\nabnormal. The psychic irradiations of his abnormal appetite usually\r\nconstitute the sanctuary of his ideal aspirations and sentiments, the\r\nobject of obscure hopes and struggles which are opposed to nature and\r\nthe inclinations of his comrades. This is why he neither understands\r\nthe world nor himself in this respect. His amorous exaltations are\r\nridiculed, or else they inspire disgust. Anxiety and shame alternate\r\nmore and more with the perverse aspirations of his mind, which slowly\r\nincrease. It is only when he arrives at the age of puberty that the\r\npervert understands his exceptional position; he then feels that he is\r\nexiled from society, abandoned and without a future. He sees his ideal\r\naspirations mocked by men and regarded as a ridiculous caricature or\r\neven as a culpable monstrosity. He is obliged to hide his passions\r\nlike a criminal. As his character is often weak and impulsive, and is\r\ncombined with a strong and precocious sexual appetite, he is very\r\neasily led astray, especially if he discovers suitable objects for his\r\nappetite, or perverted companions like himself.\r\n\r\nIn this way, in secondary schools, we often find groups of young\r\ninverts who succeed by cunning in seducing their friends. The mention\r\nof these phenomena, which from time to time give rise to school\r\nscandals, should be enough to make any one who is unprejudiced\r\nunderstand the urgency for instructing children betimes in sexual\r\nquestions. This is a duty which is necessary in the name of hygiene\r\nand morality.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that if parents and masters exchange ideas on this\r\nsubject with children, freely but decently, they will soon bring to\r\nlight the sexual nature of the latter. They will discover which girls\r\nare cold and indifferent, and which are precociously erotic.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that one should speak and act differently in the\r\ntwo cases. There is no risk in instructing the first on the whole\r\nsexual question, but prudence is required with the latter, who should\r\nbe guarded against anything which stimulates their appetite, by\r\nwarning them of the dangers of venereal disease, illegitimate children\r\nand seduction.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes meet with young girls of hysterical nature with inverted\r\ninclinations, who become enamored of other girls and have a sexual\r\nrepugnance for men. Occasionally a sadist is discovered.\r\n\r\nAmong boys we observe analogous differences in the intensity and\r\nprecocity of the sexual appetite. An attentive observer will\r\nfrequently discover homosexual appetites in boys, for these are\r\ncomparatively common. Other perversions, such as sadism, masochism,\r\nfetichism and exhibitionism, etc., are more rarely met with.\r\nMasturbation is common in both sexes.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of such discoveries is that children affected with\r\nsexual perversions can be put under special supervision, and above all\r\nthings kept away from boarding schools, where they are subject to\r\ngreat temptations. An invert in a boarding-school is in reality almost\r\nin the same position as a young man who sleeps in the same room as\r\nyoung girls, and no one thinks of the danger.\r\n\r\nWhen perversion is recognized, the subject should not be treated as a\r\ncriminal, nor even as a vicious individual, but as a patient afflicted\r\nwith a nervous affection who is thereby dangerous to himself and\r\nothers. He should be treated and prevented from becoming a center of\r\ninfection for his surroundings. Inverts should be specially supervised\r\nand taken care of till adult age. When they come of age, in my\r\nopinion, it would be an innocent idea to allow them to marry persons\r\nof their own sex, as they so much desire to do. Normal adults can very\r\nwell protect themselves against their attentions, when they are warned\r\nby sufficient instruction in sexual questions.\r\n\r\nThe child, on the other hand, has the right to be protected against\r\nall contamination by perversion, as against all sexual assault of\r\nwhatever nature, and it is the duty of society to organize its\r\nprotection. But this cannot be done unless society is itself\r\ninstructed on the question, and in a position to give a rational\r\neducation to youth such as we have sketched above.\r\n\r\nIf dangerous congenital perversions are discovered, such as sadism and\r\npederosis, energetic measures of protection should be taken; in grave\r\ncases, the operations we have spoken of, or permanent internment.\r\n\r\nApart from suggestion, there is no better remedy against masturbation\r\nthan a system of education such as that in force in the\r\nLanderziehungsheime, especially continuous physical labor combined\r\nwith useful and attractive intellectual occupation. When such a system\r\nof education is put in force at an early age, the sexual appetite\r\ndevelops more slowly and more moderately, and has the most favorable\r\ninfluence on the whole sexual life of man.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of masturbation in Chapter VIII we have seen that it may\r\nbe the expression of very different conditions, and we should act\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n=Eroticism in Childhood.=--By giving children betimes the requisite\r\ninstruction on the sexual question, they are tranquilized. Many boys\r\nand girls give themselves up to despair because of the erroneous and\r\nterrifying ideas they have of sexual affairs. On the one hand, they\r\nhear pornographic remarks which disgust them, while their parents\r\nenvelop the subject in mystery; on the other hand, their sexual\r\nappetites evoke desire and call for satisfaction. When a young man in\r\nthis state of mind has an emission, either spontaneously or as the\r\nresult of artificial excitation, he is seized with anxiety and shame,\r\noften also with phantoms of disease and moral depravity. He then\r\nrequires almost heroic resolution to unburden his mind to a doctor or\r\nto his father. With nervous subjects, inclined to be melancholic or\r\nhypochondriacal, such a state of mind sometimes leads to suicide.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage in the instruction of children in sexual matters is\r\nthat the questions of heredity, alcohol and venereal disease can be\r\nexplained to them at the same time. In giving these explanations it is\r\nimportant not to awaken eroticism in the child by dwelling more than\r\nnecessary on sexual topics. Instruction in this subject should not be\r\ngiven too frequently; on the contrary, the attention of youth should,\r\nas far as possible, be drawn away from sexual questions to other\r\nsubjects, till the age of maturity.\r\n\r\nWith the same object, erotic and pornographic literature should be\r\ncondemned. Unfortunately, many novels and dramas which meet with the\r\napprobation of society, thanks to their fashionable or even decent\r\nform of presentation, are often full of half-veiled eroticism, which\r\nis much more exciting to the sexual appetite than the brutal and\r\nrealistic descriptions of Zola or Brieux, or even the erotic art of de\r\nMaupassant.\r\n\r\nA doctor once told me that in his country the country children, who\r\nobserved copulation among animals, often made similar attempts\r\nthemselves, while bathing or otherwise. Yet these country-people are\r\nno more corrupt or degenerate than the townspeople. Here again,\r\nproper instruction and warnings would be the best remedy, especially\r\nin the case of girls.\r\n\r\nWhat is to be said, on the contrary, of certain Austrian judges who\r\npunish by imprisonment urchins of fourteen, who have copulated with\r\ngirls of the same age or made them pregnant? Have they punished the\r\nreal culprit? Do they imagine that they have done anything that will\r\nimprove these children?\r\n\r\nThe confession of Catholics plays a deplorable pedagogic part in the\r\nsexual domain. We may admit that some high-minded priests may be\r\ncapable of modifying their interpretation of the prescriptions of\r\nLiguori and others which we have cited, and do little or no harm to\r\nyoung people of either sex. It must, however, be recognized--and the\r\nmost devout Catholic cannot deny it--that priests are only human, and\r\nhave not all the noble spirit nor the tact to fulfill the ideal\r\nrequired of them in their behavior toward women. This is enough to\r\nmake the confessional, in many cases, a depraved institution from the\r\nsexual point of view. On this subject, I refer the reader to what has\r\nalready been said in Chapter XII on the experiences of the Canadian\r\nreformer, father Chiniqui.\r\n\r\nThe following instance is very characteristic. A very prudish man,\r\nobserving children of both sexes bathing together, exclaimed to them\r\nindignantly, that this was improper. Thereupon a little boy replied\r\nnaively: \"We do not know which is a boy nor which is a girl, because\r\nwe have no clothes.\" This charming reply shows how certain moral\r\nintentions are more likely to attract the attention of young people to\r\nerotic subjects.\r\n\r\n=Corporal Punishment and Sadism.=--An important fact has recently\r\nattracted the attention of the whole world, concerning certain\r\nterrible crimes. There is no longer any doubt that in some cases\r\nperverted masters and teachers find satisfaction for their sadist\r\nsexual appetite in the corporal punishment of children. This was the\r\ncase with the German teacher, Dippold, who, to satisfy his perverted\r\nappetite flogged two children confided to him by their parents, till\r\none of them died.\r\n\r\nThe _Arbeiter Zeitung_, of Vienna, a very conscientious journal,\r\npublished the case of a prince of a small German state, who, whenever\r\na schoolmaster ordered corporal punishment to a pupil, offered to\r\nexecute it himself. The journal in question attributes with good\r\nreason this fantasy to sadism.\r\n\r\nAgain, many children were at one time belabored with blows for several\r\nyears by a person who pretended to be a police agent, and who\r\nthreatened them with prosecution if they complained. One boy more\r\ncourageous than the others finally gave information, and the affair\r\nthen ended.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that sadism does not always manifest itself by\r\nassassination. Its less dangerous forms in which pleasure is obtained\r\nby blows or some other form of bodily or mental ill-treatment, are no\r\ndoubt much more common. They constitute a kind of complement to sexual\r\ndesire in pathological individuals whose appetite is only partly\r\nperverted. This fact, which has hitherto not received sufficient\r\nattention, gives one more reason for the abolition of corporal\r\npunishment in schools, for the art of dissimulation and refinement of\r\ntorture are unlimited in the sexually perverted. A thousand\r\nhypocritical pretexts serve to conceal their morbid appetite, and it\r\nhas been proved by experience that they can succeed for a long time in\r\ndeceiving even experts in this subject. This was the case with Dippold\r\nand many others.\r\n\r\nCorporal punishment of schoolboys is only useless and harmful\r\nbrutality. It is a disgrace to civilization that it is still\r\nmaintained at a time when the bastinado has been suppressed among\r\nconvicts.\r\n\r\n=Protection of Childhood. Child Martyrs.=--Children, especially when\r\nillegitimate or of another marriage, are often exposed to atrocious\r\ntreatment in which alcohol and sexual passion, inconvenienced by the\r\npresence of the child, play a great part.\r\n\r\nI here refer the reader to the last work of Lydia von Wolfring.[14]\r\nThis author, who has made a special study of the judicial protection\r\nof children, makes the following propositions directed against parents\r\nand tutors who commit misdemeanors against children or pupils confided\r\nto them, or who incite the latter to commit misdemeanors, or who show\r\nthemselves incapable of protecting them against others who abuse them\r\nin the manner indicated (this last condition applies especially to\r\nconcubines, widows, etc.).\r\n\r\n(1). Withdrawal of paternal, maternal or tutelary authority and\r\nnomination of another tutor.\r\n\r\n(2). Complete withdrawal of children in grave cases.\r\n\r\n(3). Nomination of a \"co-tutor\" in all cases where a husband who\r\nsurvives his wife and has children who are minors, contracts a second\r\nmarriage or lives in concubinage.\r\n\r\n(4). Withdrawal of paternal and sometimes maternal authority from all\r\nparents who leave the education of their children to public or private\r\ncharity, unless compelled to do so by poverty.\r\n\r\nWithout having a direct bearing on our subject the above propositions\r\ncontain the elements of an efficacious, though indirect, protection\r\nagainst the abuses committed toward children; for example, when\r\nparents urge their children to prostitution. As regards proposition 4,\r\nI refer to what I have said in Chapter XIII. While authority over\r\ntheir children is withdrawn, unnatural parents of this kind should be\r\nobliged to work for their children's maintenance.\r\n\r\n=Future Possibilities.=--Unfortunately we must admit that the programme\r\nof a sexual pedagogy for the future, such as we have sketched here, is\r\nvery far from being realized. The Landerziehungsheime, which should\r\nserve as examples for future state schools are still sparsely\r\ndistributed, and it seems impossible to carry out universally a\r\nrational sexual education, till the state and the public are better\r\ninformed on the subject and have got rid of their prejudices. This hope\r\nappears to be only the reflection of a distant future. In the meantime\r\nevery one must do his best. Parents, and some masters, can do much by\r\nfree initiative. It is above all things necessary that young people who\r\nare interested in social reforms should not be satisfied with empty\r\nphrases, nor \"play to the gallery.\" They should set the example in\r\ntheir own sexual relations, in condemning old customs which are opposed\r\nto true natural human ethics; they should show their adherence to\r\nsexual reforms by action and example, by raising objections to marriage\r\nfor money, to the tyranny and formality of marriage, to prostitution,\r\netc.; and they should attempt to put in force a healthy selection and a\r\nrational education such as we have indicated above.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] Vide.--Ernest Contou: _Ecoles nouvelles et Landerziehungsheime_,\r\nParis, 1905; Wilhelm Frey: _Landerziehungsheime_, Leipzig, 1902;\r\nForel: _Hygiène des nerfs et de l'esprit_, Stuttgart, 1905.\r\n\r\n[14] \"Das Recht des Kindes: Vorschläge für eine gesetzliche Regelung.\"\r\n_Allgemeine österreichische Gerichtszeitung_, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nSEXUAL LIFE IN ART\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Genesis of Art.=--Art represents in a harmonious form the\r\nmovements of our sentimental life. The phylogeny of art is still very\r\nobscure; Darwin attributes it to sexual attraction, through the\r\nefforts made by one sex to attract the other; but his arguments have\r\nnever convinced me.[15]\r\n\r\nAristotle recognized in art the principles of representation of the\r\nbeautiful and of imitation. Karl Groos, of Giessen, refutes Darwin's\r\nhypothesis, and upholds the principle of the representation of self by\r\nsensations which relate to the subject, thus giving a tangible object\r\nto corresponding internal emotions (among animals, for example, the\r\npleasure of hearing their own voice).[16]\r\n\r\nThe motor instinct and the movements executed in play seem to be among\r\nthe most primitive autonomous creators of art. Similar play is\r\nobserved in ants. In man, Groos attributes a considerable role to\r\nreligious ecstasy and ecstasy in general, in the genesis of art.\r\n\"Since its object is to excite the sentiments, it is obvious that art\r\nutilizes from the first the domain which is richest in emotional\r\nsensations, that is the sexual domain.\" He shows at the same time that\r\nerotic subjects have a much more general and definite importance in\r\nhighly developed art than in what we know of primitive art.\r\n\r\nGroos is certainly right, for primitive eroticism was too coarse and\r\nsensual, too exclusively tactile to affect the mind as deeply and with\r\nsuch gradations of symphony as is the case with civilized man. This\r\nreason alone seems to me sufficient to support Groos' view, which is\r\nalso confirmed by the fact that primitive works of art contain very\r\nfew erotic subjects.\r\n\r\nThe more delicate art becomes the better it acts. The intensity of its\r\naction depends, however, more especially on the power with which it\r\nmoves our feelings. Art requires discord, not only in music, but\r\nelsewhere, in order to act more strongly on the human emotions by the\r\neffect of contrast. In describing the ugly it awakens desire for the\r\nbeautiful. Art should be spontaneous and exuberant with the truth of\r\nconviction; it should be free from mannerism and all dogmatism,\r\nintellectual or moral. The positive æsthetic sentiment, or sentiment\r\nof beauty is very relative, and depends essentially on the\r\nphylogenetic adaptation of the human sentiments, as well as on\r\nindividual habits and popular customs. The odor of manure is no doubt\r\npleasant to a farm laborer, but it is unpleasant to us. The male\r\ninvert finds man more beautiful than woman. A savage or a peasant\r\nregards as beautiful what a cultured man considers ugly. The music of\r\nWagner or Chopin is tiresome to a person with no musical education or\r\near, while a melomaniac goes into raptures over it.\r\n\r\n=Erotic Art.=--It is quite natural that the chord whose vibrations\r\ninfluence the most powerful human emotion--sexual love--has an\r\ninfinite variety of vibrations in all forms of art. Music gives\r\nexpression to the sexual sensations and their psychic irradiations by\r\ntones representing desire, passion, joy, sadness, deception, despair,\r\nsacrifice, ecstasy, etc.\r\n\r\nIn sculpture and painting it is love in all its shades which furnishes\r\nthe inexhaustible theme; but it is in the domain of literature that\r\nlove celebrates its triumphs, and often also its orgies. The novels\r\nand dramas in which it plays no part could be easily counted. I am not\r\nreferring only to common novelettes, nor to those pot-house dramas\r\nwhich, in spite of repeating continually the same sentimental motives,\r\nalways succeed in arousing the uncultivated sentiments of the masses.\r\nThe greatest art aims at representing tragic, refined and complex\r\nconflicts of the human sexual sentiments and their irradiations, so as\r\nto awaken emotion by causing vibrations in the deepest chords of the\r\nhuman mind. Among poets and authors I may mention Shakespere,\r\nSchiller, Goethe, de Musset, Heine, Gotthelf, and de Maupassant; among\r\nmusicians, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, Schumann, Loewe; among\r\npainters, Titian, Murillo, Boecklin; and sculptors such as those of\r\nthe ancient Greeks or the modern French school.\r\n\r\nArt and pure intellect do not form an antinomy; they are associated\r\ntogether in the human mind as thought and sentiment, each preserving\r\nits own, though relative, independence. Every artistic representation\r\nrequires an intellectual foundation, in the same way as every\r\nsentiment is connected with ideas. The artist takes his subjects from\r\nthe external world, from life, and from the events of all ages. He\r\nalso utilizes the progress of science for the mechanism of his art.\r\nBut, to transform the material into a complete picture, with a unity\r\nof action, where the different sentiments harmonize; to transform the\r\nwork of art into a symbol of something human; to make the whole work\r\nspeak to every mind capable of comprehending it, all this can only be\r\nthe work of a great artist with creative genius.\r\n\r\n=Art and Morality.=--True art is in itself neither moral nor immoral.\r\nHere we can well say--to the pure everything is pure. In the mirror of\r\nan impure mind, every work of art may appear as a pornographic\r\ncaricature, while to the high-minded it is the incarnation of the\r\nnoblest ideal. The fault is not with art and its products, but with\r\nnature and the peculiarities of many human brains, which deform\r\neverything they perceive, so that the most beautiful works of art only\r\nawaken in their pornographic minds cynical sexual images.\r\n\r\n=Art and Pornography.=--After having enunciated the preceding\r\nfundamental principles, we must examine the following facts, which\r\nhave a special importance for the question with which we are dealing.\r\nUnder the banner of art are grouped a number of human enterprises\r\nwhich are far from deserving this honor. There are few great artists,\r\nbut thousands of charlatans and plagiarists. Many of those who have\r\nnever had the least idea of the dignity of art, pander to the lower\r\ninstincts of the masses and not to their best sentiments. In this\r\nconnection, erotic subjects play a sad and powerful part. Nothing is\r\ntoo filthy to be used to stimulate the base sensuality of the public.\r\nFrivolous songs, licentious novels and plays, obscene dances,\r\npornographic pictures, all without any trace of artistic merit,\r\nspeculate on the erotic instinct of the masses in order to obtain\r\ntheir money.\r\n\r\nIn these brothels of art, the most obscene vice is glorified, even\r\npathological. Unfortunately, this obscenity spoils the taste of the\r\npublic and destroys all sense of true and noble art. At the bottom of\r\nall this degeneration of the sentiment of art and its products in the\r\nsexual domain, we always find on close examination, corruption by\r\nmoney and brutalism by alcohol. I say advisedly, the sentiment of art\r\nand the products of art, for it is not sufficient for true artists to\r\ncreate their masterpieces, it is also necessary for them to find an\r\necho in the public, and be understood by them. The two phenomena go\r\nhand in hand, as supply and demand. When the sentiment of art is low\r\namong the public, the quality of the artistic production is also low,\r\nand inversely. Professor Behrens, director of the Industrial School of\r\nArt at Dusseldorf, is in complete accord with me in the debasing\r\neffect of alcohol on the artistic sentiment. (_Alkohol und Kunst._)\r\n\r\nAfter establishing these facts, we return to the fundamental but\r\ndelicate question: How is true erotic art to be distinguished from the\r\npornographic? While certain ascetic and fanatical preachers of\r\nmorality would burn and destroy all the erotic creations of art under\r\nthe pretext that they are pornographic, other disciples of decadence\r\ndefend the most ignoble pornography under the shield of art.\r\n\r\nI will cite two examples which have already been mentioned previously\r\n(Chapter XIII). In a very primitive and bigoted region of the Tyrol,\r\ncertain undraped, but very innocent, statues of women were erected in\r\nthe streets. Feeling their modesty deeply wounded, and regarding the\r\nrepresentation of the natural human body as a great inducement to\r\nmisconduct, the peasants of the district broke up these statues. The\r\nsame with the captain of police at Zurich, who made himself notorious\r\nby ordering the removal of the picture by Boecklin, entitled \"The\r\nSport of the Waves,\" regarding the two mermaids in the picture as a\r\ndanger to the morality and virtue of the citizens of Zurich!\r\n\r\nI designate by the term charlatanism, everything which consists in\r\ndecorating or covering by the term art, all possible perversions of\r\npornography, often pathological. Persons of artistic nature, dominated\r\nby emotional sentiments, will no doubt be excused for being often\r\noverexcited to a more or less pathological degree, for executing all\r\nkinds of fantastic vagaries in their sexual life, and for being\r\ncapricious and excessive in love. These things are almost inseparable\r\nfrom the artistic temperament. But the systematic education of\r\npornography, and the sexual orgies which are cynically made public, go\r\ndecidedly beyond what is licit, and cannot be included in the scope of\r\nart without degrading it. The individual and pathological failings of\r\nartists and the eccentricities to which they often become victims,\r\nmust not be confounded with art and its products.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we often find eroticism hidden where we should\r\nleast expect it, for instance in certain books for the edification of\r\nthe pious. Here also it does not fail to produce its effect, although\r\nold maids and pious families place these books in their libraries and\r\nrecommend them as proper reading. It has been said with reason, that\r\n\"what is improper in the nudity of a statue is the fig-leaf and not\r\nwhat is underneath.\" It is, in fact, these fig-leaves--sculptured,\r\npainted, written or spoken--which awaken lewdness rather than deaden\r\nit. By drawing attention to what they conceal, they excite sensuality\r\nmuch more than simple nudity. In short, the eroticism which plays at\r\nhide and seek is that which acts with greatest intensity. The\r\ndirectors of ballets and other similar spectacles know this only too\r\nwell, and arrange accordingly.\r\n\r\nI have seen at the Paris Exposition an Arab woman perform the erotic\r\ndance called the \"danse du ventre,\" in which the various movements of\r\ncoitus are imitated by movements of the hips and loins. I do not\r\nthink, however, that this pantomime, as cynical as it is coarse,\r\nproduces on the spectators such an erotic effect as the _décolleté_\r\ncostumes of society ladies, or even certain amorous scenes of\r\nreligious ecstasy in words or pictures (vide Chapter XII). As the\r\n\"danse du ventre\" was produced under the head of _ethnology_, it was\r\nwitnessed by society ladies without their being in the least degree\r\nwounded in their sentiments of modesty! It is extremely difficult, if\r\nnot impossible, to define the limit between art and pornography. I\r\nwill attempt to give an example.\r\n\r\nIn his novels and romances, Guy de Maupassant has given perhaps the\r\nfinest and most true descriptions which exist of the psychology of\r\nlove and the sexual appetite. Although he has depicted the most\r\nticklish sexual situations, often most _recherché_, we can say that\r\nwith few exceptions he has not written in a pornographic spirit. His\r\ndescriptions are profound and true, and he does not attempt to make\r\nattractive what is ugly and immoral, although he cannot be blamed for\r\nmoralizing.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the old hypocritical eroticism consisted essentially\r\nin the art of describing sexual forbidden fruit and making it as\r\ndesirable as possible, at the same time covering it with pious phrases\r\nwhich were only a transparent mask. Vice was condemned, but described\r\nin such a way as to make the reader's mouth water. There is nothing of\r\nthis in Guy de Maupassant, nor in Zola. By their tragic descriptions,\r\nthey provoke disgust and sadness in the reader, rather than\r\nsensuality. It is otherwise with the illustrations which de\r\nMaupassant's publisher has added to his works and which are frankly\r\npornographic. These are not fair to the author.\r\n\r\nAnother comparison shows, perhaps, still better the uncertainty of the\r\nline of demarcation between pornography and art. If we compare Heine\r\nwith de Maupassant, I think we must admit that, in spite of the\r\nrefinement of his art, the pornographic trait is incomparably stronger\r\nin the former, because Heine continually loses the thread of moral\r\nsense which impregnates most of the works of de Maupassant. The latter\r\nauthor emphasizes evil and injustice in the sexual question.\r\n\r\nThe refined art of the Greeks contains much eroticism and much nudity,\r\nbut there is nothing whatever immoral in either. Innocence and beauty\r\nare so apparent that no one can think of evil. When we look at the\r\nantique statues of the Greek sculptors; when we read Homer, especially\r\nthe story of Ares and Aphrodite; when we read the bucolic idyll of\r\nDaphnis and Chloe, we can no longer have any doubt on the point. It is\r\nnot nudity, it is not the natural description of sexual life, but the\r\nobscene intention of the artist, his improper and often venal object,\r\nwhich has a demoralizing effect.\r\n\r\nFinally, I repeat that the purest artistic creation may serve as a\r\npornographic theme for every individual who is accustomed to introduce\r\ninto his parodies his own depravity, immorality and obscene\r\nsentiments. I do not deny that in antiquity, especially at the time of\r\nthe decadence of Rome, pornography and cynical coarseness often ruled\r\nin the sexual domain. History and the ruins of Pompeii give abundant\r\nevidence of it. But such phenomena occurred at the periods of\r\ndecadence. Who then can decide where art ends and pornography begins,\r\nor how far eroticism may without danger be expressed in art? This\r\nquestion is so difficult and delicate that I am unable to answer it\r\nwith sufficient competence. I think that when the reign of capitalism\r\nand alcohol has come to an end, the danger of pornography will be\r\nreduced enormously. I believe we ought to avoid extremes in both\r\ndirections. Wherever pornography manifests itself in a purely cynical\r\nway, denuded of all art, society can and should suppress it. When it\r\nappears under an artistic mantle, it should be possible in each\r\nparticular case to weigh the artistic merit of the work against its\r\nimmoral tendencies, taking all other accessory circumstances into\r\naccount, in order to decide the real weight of each of these elements.\r\nThe corrupting action should also be carefully considered, which\r\nexperience proves to have been exerted on the public by certain\r\nso-called works of art, or artistic exhibitions, as for example\r\ncertain _cafés chantants_, etc.\r\n\r\n=Pathological Art.=--The progressively pathological nature of certain\r\nproductions of modern art constitute without any doubt a vicious\r\nfeature; a fact of special importance in the sexual question. Witness\r\nwhat I have said concerning the poet Baudelaire. Erotic art ought not\r\nto become a hospital for perverts and sexual patients, and should not\r\nlead these individuals to regard themselves as interesting specimens\r\nof the human race. It should not make heroes of them, for in acting\r\nthus, it only confirms their morbid state, and often contaminates\r\nhealthy-minded people.\r\n\r\nA great number of novels, and even modern pictures, deserve the\r\nreproach of being pornographic works. In these are described, or\r\npainted, beings that we meet in hospitals for nervous diseases, or\r\neven in lunatic asylums, but more often phantoms which only exist in\r\nthe pathological mind of the author. No doubt, art should not allow\r\nitself to be instructed in morality by pedagogues and ascetics; but,\r\non the other hand, artists ought not to forget the high social mission\r\nof their art, a mission which consists in elevating man to the ideal,\r\nnot in letting him sink into a bog.\r\n\r\n=The Moral Effect of Healthy Art.=--Art has great power, for man is\r\ndirected by sentiment much more than by reason. Art should be healthy;\r\nit should rise toward the heavens and show the public the road to\r\nOlympus--not the Olympus of superstition, but that of a better\r\nhumanity. It is not necessary for this that it should diminish the\r\nenergy of its eternal theme--love. No truly moral man would wish to\r\neliminate the seasoning of eroticism whenever artistic necessity\r\nrequires it, but art should never prostitute itself in the service of\r\nvenal obscenity and degeneration.\r\n\r\nAs to the manner in which it attains its object, while holding to its\r\nfundamental principles, that is its own affair, the business of the\r\ntrue artist. I cannot, however, in my capacity as a naturalist,\r\nrefrain from giving a little modest advice to certain modern artists;\r\nthat when they wish to take for the subject of their works the themes\r\nof social morality, medicine or science, they should avoid previous\r\nstudy of their subject in scientific books; that they should follow\r\nthe example of de Maupassant and begin by living themselves the\r\nsituations which they wish to depict, before beginning to model their\r\nwork. Without this they will completely fail in artistic effect, and\r\nwill become bad theorists, bad scientists, bad moralists and bad\r\nsocial politicians, at the same time ceasing to be good artists. If\r\nMaeterlinck's \"Life of Bees\" is a fine work of art, it is not only\r\nbecause the author is a distinguished writer, but because he was\r\nhimself acquainted with bees, being an apicultor, and did not make his\r\nbook a mere compilation of other scientific works.\r\n\r\nAlong with the struggle against the debasing influence of money and\r\nalcohol, the elevation of the artistic sentiment among the public\r\nwill contribute strongly to condemn pornographic \"æsthetics.\" The\r\nfalse and unnatural sentimentalism, spiced with erotic lewdness, which\r\nis displayed in the trash offered to the public under the title of\r\n\"art,\" fills every man who possesses the least artistic sense with\r\ndisgust. Disgust evidently constitutes a beneficial mental medicine in\r\nthe domain of art, and we cannot agree with the severe and ascetic\r\nminds who think that true morality has nothing to do with art, or even\r\nthat everything moral should be destitute of art. These people are\r\ncompletely deceived and unwittingly promote pornography, by repelling\r\nhumanity with their austerity and driving it to the opposite extreme.\r\nThe æsthetic and moral sentiments should be harmoniously combined with\r\nintelligence and will, each of these departments of the mind\r\nparticipating by its special energies in the elevation of man.\r\n\r\n=Anticonceptional Measures from the Æsthetic Point of View.=--In\r\nconclusion, I will refer to a subject which is perhaps not quite in\r\nits place in this chapter. The anticonceptional measures recommended\r\nfor reasons of social hygiene, which tend to regulate conceptions and\r\nimprove their quality, have been often condemned, sometimes as\r\nimmoral, sometimes as contrary to æsthetics. To interfere in this way\r\nwith the action of nature is said to injure the poetry of love and the\r\nmoral feeling, and at the same time to disturb natural selection.\r\n\r\nThere are several replies to these objections: In the first place, it\r\nis wrong to maintain that man cannot encroach on the life of nature.\r\nIf this were the case, the earth would now be a virgin forest and a\r\ngreat many animals and plants would not have been adapted to the use\r\nof man. Our fields, our gardens and our domestic animals would die,\r\ninstead of bearing fruit and multiplying as they do at present. The\r\nnaturalist has much more fear of seeing rare and interesting wild\r\nplants and animals exterminated from the face of the earth by the\r\negoistic and pitiless hand of man. He seeks in vain the means of\r\nchecking this work of destruction.\r\n\r\nWe have proved without the least deference, often with a brutal hand,\r\nto the misfortune of art and poetry, that we are capable of\r\nsuccessfully intermeddling with the machinery of nature, even in what\r\nconcerns our own persons. I shall not return here to the subject of\r\nethics. In Chapter XV, I have sufficiently shown how false is our\r\npresent sexual morality, and I have proved in Chapter XIV the absolute\r\nnecessity of measures to regulate conception in order to realize an\r\nefficacious social sexual morality.\r\n\r\nThe æsthetic argument appears at first sight more valid; it is\r\nunnecessary, however, to discuss matters of taste. Spectacles are\r\ncertainly not particularly æsthetic; nevertheless the poetry of love\r\ndoes not suffer much from their use, and when one is shortsighted or\r\nlongsighted one cannot do without them. Great artists wear spectacles.\r\nIt is the same with false teeth, with clothes, with bicycles and a\r\nhundred other artificial things which man makes use of to make his\r\nlife more easy. So long as they are novel and unusual they wound the\r\næsthetic sentiment; but when we become accustomed to them we no longer\r\ntake notice of them. Man has even come to regard as æsthetic, women's\r\ncorsets which deform their chests, and pointed shoes which deform the\r\nfeet. I am certain that the first man who mounted a horse was accused\r\nby his contemporaries of committing an act contrary to æsthetics!\r\n\r\nFrom all points of view, the details of coitus leave much to be\r\ndesired from the æsthetic point of view, and such a slight addition as\r\na membranous protective does not appear to make any serious\r\ndifference. It is impossible for me to recognize the validity of such\r\nan objection, which I attribute to the prejudice against anything\r\nwhich disturbs our habits.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] See also Lameere \"_L'Évolution des ornements sexuels_,\" 1904.\r\n\r\n[16] \"Die Anfänge der Kunst und die Theorie Darwins.\" _Hessiche\r\nBlätter für Volkskunde_, Vol. III, Part 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Utopia and the Realizable Ideal.=--The term Utopia may be applied to\r\nevery ideal project elaborated by human imagination for the future\r\nwelfare of society, which has no healthy and real foundation, is\r\ncontrary to human nature and the results of experience, and has\r\nconsequently no chance of success. Persons of conservative minds who\r\nlive in prejudice and in the faith of authority apply the term Utopia\r\nto every ideal which has not been legalized and sanctioned by time,\r\ncustom, or authority. This is a grave error, which, if it always\r\nprevailed, would bar the way to all social progress.\r\n\r\nAs regards the ideal, the future may realize much progress that the\r\npast has not known, and on this point Ben Akiba was wrong in saying\r\nthat \"there is nothing new under the sun.\" International\r\ncommunication, universal postage, the suppression of slavery in\r\ncivilized countries, the artificial feeding of new-born infants, the\r\ntelephone, wireless telegraphy, etc., are realized advances which had\r\nformerly never appeared on the horizon of humanity, and which would\r\nhave been regarded as impossible fantasies, or Utopias.\r\n\r\nWhy should the common use of an international language and the\r\nsuppression of war between civilized countries be Utopias? The most\r\ndiverse races already speak English, and all might learn Esperanto. In\r\nthe interior of countries such as France and Germany, etc., the old\r\nfeudal wars ceased long ago. Why should a more and more international\r\nunion between men be impossible?\r\n\r\nWhy should the suppression of the use of narcotic substances such as\r\nalcohol, opium, hashish, etc., which poison entire nations, be\r\nUtopian? Why should it be the same with the economic reform desired by\r\nsocialists, that is the equitable division of wages; for example, by\r\nthe aid of a coöperative system or by the reduction of capital to a\r\nminimum?\r\n\r\nThese things are all possible, and even necessary for the natural and\r\nprogressive development of humanity. It is only the prejudice of old\r\ncustoms, based on the conservative tendency of sentiments, which\r\nopposes these projects and tries to ridicule them by calling them\r\nUtopian. In its shortsightedness, it does not see the change which\r\noccurs all over the world in the social relations of men, or does not\r\nestimate them at their true value, and it cannot abandon its old\r\nidols.\r\n\r\nLastly, why should rational reforms in the sexual domain be more\r\ndifficult to realize than the artificial feeding of infants, than the\r\nactual triumphs of surgical operations, than sero-therapy, than\r\nvaccination, etc.? In the same way that shortsighted and longsighted\r\npersons wear spectacles, or those who have no teeth use artificial\r\nones, so may men who are tainted by hereditary disease employ\r\npreventatives in coitus to avoid the procreation of a tainted progeny;\r\nand the same means may be employed to give women time to recover their\r\nstrength after each confinement.\r\n\r\n=Résumé.=--Let us briefly recapitulate the matter contained in the\r\nchapters of this book:\r\n\r\n(1). In the first five chapters I have given an account of the natural\r\nhistory, anatomy and functions of the reproductive organs, and the\r\npsychology of sexual life.\r\n\r\n(2). In Chapter VI, I have given (chiefly according to Westermarck) a\r\n_résumé_ of ethnography and the history of sexual relations in the\r\ndifferent human races.\r\n\r\n(3). In Chapter VII, I have attempted to trace the zoölogical\r\nevolution of sexual life along the line of our animal ancestors, and\r\nto briefly describe the evolution of sexual life in the individual,\r\nfrom birth till death. I have thus endeavored to acquaint the reader\r\nwith the two sources of our sexual sensations and sentiments--the\r\nhereditary or phylogenetic source, and the source acquired and adapted\r\nby the individual.\r\n\r\n(4). In Chapter VIII, I have described the pathology of sexual life,\r\nbecause this concerns social life much more than is generally\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\n(5). In Chapters IX to XVIII, I have explained the relations of sexual\r\nlife to the most important spheres of human sentiments and interests,\r\nto suggestion, money and property, to the external conditions of life,\r\nto religion, law, medicine, morality, politics, political economy,\r\npedagogy and art. Incidentally, I have glanced at the social\r\norganizations and customs which depend on these relations.\r\n\r\nIf we sum up the results obtained, we can draw from them a series of\r\nconclusions which we will divide into two groups:\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGATIVE TASKS\r\n\r\n_Suppression of the Direct or Indirect Causes of Sexual Evils and\r\nAbuses, and the Social Vices which Correspond to Them_\r\n\r\nThe corruption into which a semi-civilization has plunged humanity, by\r\nfacilitating the means of obtaining satisfaction for its unbridled\r\npassion for pleasure, is maintained by the latter itself. But in the\r\nlong run, the unlimited abandonment of the individual to pleasure\r\ncannot be in accord with the welfare and progress of society. This is\r\nthe knotty point. It is necessary for a better social organization to\r\nartificially restrain the passion for pleasure, at the same time\r\nraising the social quality of men; that is to say, their altruism or\r\ninstinct (social ethics). We can only expect immediately the first of\r\nthese two objects; but we have seen that it is possible to prepare the\r\nsecond for the future, by neglecting none of the factors of social\r\nsalvation.\r\n\r\nWe have become acquainted with the most important roots of sexual\r\ndegeneration, due to semi-civilization. I use the word\r\n\"semi-civilization\" because our present culture is still very\r\nincomplete and has hardly done more than skim over the surface of the\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nMen of higher culture have overcome the maladies of infancy of\r\ncivilization much better than the uneducated masses, and it is\r\nprecisely this fact which should give us courage and confidence in a\r\nfuture in which a true higher culture will be the appanage of all. The\r\nroots of degeneration are either directly or indirectly associated\r\nwith sexual life. It is our duty to declare war of extermination\r\nagainst all of them, and not to cease this contest before reducing\r\nthem to their natural primitive minimum. The following are the chief\r\nevils to be contended against.\r\n\r\n=1. The Cult of Money.=--We have recognized the primary sources of\r\ndegeneration in the historical development of humanity and its sexual\r\nlife (Chapters VI and X). They consist in the exploitation of man by\r\nman, in the desire of possessing riches and power, which become the\r\nsource of marriage by purchase and by abduction, of prostitution and\r\nall the modern requirements by the aid of which is cultivated the\r\npassion for sexual pleasures, thanks to the power of money.\r\n\r\nThe priests and disciples of Mammon lie when they say that their\r\ngod--the golden calf--is the most powerful stimulus to work and the\r\nprincipal promoter of culture. If we look closer we see the contrary.\r\nMen of genius, thinkers, inventors and artists are urged to work by\r\ntheir hereditary instinct, by true love of the ideal and thirst for\r\nknowledge. The disciples of Mammon, on the watch for the discoveries\r\nand creations of these men, rob them not only of the fruit of their\r\nwork, but often of the honors which belong to them. Intellectual\r\nrobbery is added to pecuniary robbery.\r\n\r\nThese are the methods of \"Mammonism,\" which must be seen to be\r\nappreciated; and we are told that this kind of industry should be the\r\nonly stimulus to human work and culture! No doubt, the unbridled lust\r\nfor gain urges men to feverish activity; but this kind of zeal, which\r\nis nearly always associated with the passion for pleasure, and only\r\nworks to obtain the means of satisfying it, is unhealthy. It is\r\nnecessary for other factors to act in stimulating human work.\r\nFortunately these forces exist, and can be found, for without work\r\nthere can be no culture, social progress nor happiness.\r\n\r\nThe worship of the golden calf, the utilization of accumulated wealth\r\nas a means of exploiting the work of others for individual interest,\r\nis therefore the primary and principal root of social degeneration,\r\nmarriage for money, prostitution and all their corrupt associations.\r\nIf this root is not torn out, humanity will never succeed in the\r\nsanitation of sexual matters. The struggle against the exaggerated\r\nmodern legal rights of capital, and the abuses which result from it,\r\nis therefore one of the most important tasks to be accomplished in\r\norder to lead indirectly to the sanitation of sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\n=2. The Use of Narcotics.=--The habit of using narcotic poisons,\r\nespecially alcohol, leads to the physical and moral degeneration of\r\nmen, a degeneration which not only affects the individuals concerned,\r\nbut also their germinal cells and consequently their offspring. I have\r\ndesignated this degeneration by the term _blastophthoria_.\r\nBlastophthoria is intimately connected with sexual phenomena, and\r\nthanks to it, the individual influence of these poisons may extend to\r\nmany generations.\r\n\r\nA single radical remedy would be easy to apply, if men were not so\r\nmuch the slaves of their habits and prejudices, of capital and the\r\npassion for pleasure. All narcotic substances, especially distilled\r\nand fermented drinks, should be abolished as a means of pleasure and\r\nrelegated to pharmacy, in which they may still be used as remedies,\r\nwith special precautions. Alcohol may also be used for industrial\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nScience has proved that even the most moderate indulgence in alcohol\r\ndisturbs the association of ideas, and renders them more superficial,\r\nwithout the subject being aware of it. This slight degree of alcoholic\r\nnarcosis causes in man a temporary feeling of pleasure and gayety to\r\nwhich he soon becomes accustomed. In this way there is created in him\r\na desire for more, too often with increasing doses.\r\n\r\nMost narcotics, especially alcohol (either fermented or distilled),\r\nhave the peculiarity of exciting the sexual appetite in a bestial\r\nmanner, thereby leading to the most absurd and disgusting excesses,\r\nalthough at the same time they weaken the sexual power. The transient\r\npleasure produced by these substances is, therefore, of no real and\r\nlasting advantage, while it results in the most terrible individual\r\nand social miseries.\r\n\r\nSocieties for total abstinence from all alcoholic drinks have\r\nundertaken a war of extermination against the use of all poisons used\r\nfor purposes of pleasure, when experience has proved their social\r\ndanger. Let us hope that they will succeed; then a second fundamental\r\nroot of degeneration of sexual life will be destroyed.\r\n\r\n=3. The Emancipation of Woman.=--A third source of sexual anomalies is\r\ndue to the inequality of the rights of the two sexes. This can only be\r\nattacked by the complete emancipation of women. In no kind of animal\r\nis the female an object possessed by the male. Nowhere in nature do we\r\nfind the slave-law which subordinates one sex to the other. Even among\r\nants, where the male, on account of his great physical inferiority, is\r\nvery dependent on the workers, the latter do not impose on him any\r\nconstraint. We have already refuted the argument which is based on the\r\nintellectual inferiority of woman.\r\n\r\nThe emancipation of women is not intended to transform them into men,\r\nbut simply to give them their human rights, I might even say their\r\nnatural animal rights. It in no way wishes to impose work on women nor\r\nto make them unaccustomed to it. It is as absurd to bring them up as\r\nspoilt children as it is cruel to brutalize them as beasts of burden.\r\nIt is our duty to give them the independent position in society which\r\ncorresponds to their normal attributes.\r\n\r\nTheir sexual role is so important that it gives them the right to the\r\nhighest social considerations in this domain. I will not repeat what I\r\nhave said in Chapter XIII, but simply state categorically that, when\r\nwomen have acquired in society rights and duties equal to those of men\r\n(in accordance with sexual differences), when they can react freely\r\naccording to their feminine genius, in a manner as decisive as men, on\r\nthe destinies of the community, a third fundamental root of present\r\nsexual abuses will be suppressed. The complete emancipation of woman\r\nthus constitutes our third principal postulate, and in this I am in\r\naccord with Westermarck, Secretan and many other eminent persons.\r\n\r\nThe difference which exists between the two sexes does not give any\r\nreasonable excuse to man for monopolizing all social and political\r\nrights. The external world and our fellow beings, by whom and for whom\r\nwe live in body and mind, are the same for woman as for man, so that\r\neven when the mentality of one sex is on the average a little higher\r\nthan that of the other, the first cannot claim the right of refusing\r\nthe second the liberty of living and acting from the social point of\r\nview according to her own genius. The two sexes differ in many\r\nrespects it is true; on the other hand, all legal and consequently\r\nartificial constraint of one by the other has the effect of hindering\r\nthe free development of both. Each sex has the right to look upon the\r\nworld and assimilate it according to its nature. It can thus develop\r\nits personality so that it does not become etiolated and atrophied\r\nlike a domestic animal. It is only the right of the stronger,\r\ncultivated by narrow-minded prejudice, that can deny or misunderstand\r\nthese facts. The legal restrictions which we impose on woman, on her\r\nmentality and her whole life, especially her conjugal life, have\r\nnothing in common with the just restrictions which the law should\r\nprovide against the encroachments of individual egoism, which injure\r\nthe rights of others or those of society.\r\n\r\n=4. Prejudice and Tradition.=--There is still another enemy opposed to\r\nreform, which is so deeply rooted in human nature that we can only\r\nhope for a slow improvement in the quality of men, by its progressive\r\nweakening. I refer to the host of prejudices, traditional customs,\r\nmystic superstitions, religious dogmas, fashions, etc. I should\r\nrequire many pages of moral preaching to deal with all the vices which\r\nare perpetually created and supported by the wretched tendency of the\r\nhuman mind to sanctify every ancient tradition and consider it as\r\nunalterable.\r\n\r\nPrejudice, faith in authority, mysticism, etc., with conscious or\r\nunconscious hypocrisy, and by the aid of more or less transparent\r\nsophisms, place themselves at the service of the basest human\r\npassions--envy, hatred, vanity, avarice, lewdness, scandal, desire of\r\ndomination and idleness--and clothe them all with the sacred mantle of\r\nancient customs, the better to sanction their ignominy by relying on\r\nthe authority of tradition. There is no infamy which has not been\r\njustified, glorified or even deified in this way.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that it is only by the introduction of the scientific\r\nspirit, of an inductive and philosophical manner of thinking, into\r\nschools and among the masses, that we shall be able to contend\r\nefficaciously with the routine and parrot-like repetitions which are\r\nrooted in the worship of authoritative doctrines and prejudices based\r\non the sanctity of what is old.\r\n\r\nWe have already sufficiently dealt with the superannuated prejudices\r\nand customs to be contended with in the sexual domain, and need not\r\nreturn to them. The whole of this category of causes of evil, a\r\ncategory which also plays a great part in all other domains of human\r\nlife, can only, therefore, be contended with by true science combined\r\nwith an integral and free education of the character of youth.\r\n\r\nI must once again insist on the necessity of a fight to a finish on\r\nthis ground. It is necessary for this that scientists should from time\r\nto time emerge from their sanctums, and let their lights shine in the\r\nwhirlpool of human society. They must take part in social conflicts\r\nand avoid losing touch with what is and always will be human.\r\n\r\nThe following postulates relate to aberrations and dangers which are\r\nmore partial or more local.\r\n\r\n=5. Pornography.=--In Chapters V, X and XVIII, I have spoken of\r\npornography, and in Chapter XVII, of its great danger to the\r\ndevelopment of a normal sexual life in youth. Although pornography\r\nowes much of its origin and development to the greed for gain, it must\r\nnot be forgotten that, on the other hand, masculine eroticism tends to\r\npromote its mercantile interests. It is the duty of society to oppose\r\nthe pornographic products of morbid eroticism, without imposing the\r\nleast constraint on true art. The sexual appetite of man is on the\r\naverage rather strong; we may even say that it is much too strong,\r\ncompared with the social necessities of procreation. It is, therefore,\r\nquite superfluous to artificially stimulate it. The struggle against\r\npornography must, therefore, be raised to the rank of a postulate.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget, however, that we shall contend with it much more\r\nsuccessfully by fulfilling our first four postulates, and in raising\r\nthe artistic ideal and feeling in man, than by direct measures of\r\nsuppression. The latter should be limited to the most coarse and\r\ncorrupt productions of pornography.\r\n\r\n=6. Politics and Sexual Life.=--I need only remind the reader of the\r\nencroachments of politics on sexual life, and especially of the abuse\r\nof sexual influence in the domain of politics. It is needless to point\r\nout the necessity of opposing all useless intermeddling of the State\r\nin the sexual life of individuals by the aid of unjustifiable\r\nregulations, as well as all intervention in the natural sexual\r\nrequirements of man (in marriage, etc.), when no individual or social\r\ninterest is injured. What is much more difficult, is to prevent the\r\npressure of sexual sympathies and antipathies, and especially of\r\namorous passions in politics.\r\n\r\n=7. Venereal Disease.=--There is need for a great combat with venereal\r\ndisease and pathological corruptions of the sexual appetite. (Vide\r\nChapters VIII, XIII and XIV.) Sexual criminals should be treated\r\nconjointly with the pathology of the sexual appetite, and in the same\r\nmanner; for it is nearly always a question of anomalies of the human\r\nbrain, which are impossible to improve or eliminate by punishment or\r\nother penal measures.\r\n\r\nFor the present, medical and administrative measures of restriction,\r\nundertaken by society against dangerous and degenerate individuals in\r\nthe sexual domain, are the only possible remedy. We should also\r\nendeavor in the future to prevent such individuals from breeding and\r\nsuppress the causes of blastophthoria, by the aid of our second\r\npostulate.\r\n\r\n=8. The Conflict of Human Races.=--There remains a last postulate,\r\nextremely arduous and serious, which we have already mentioned. How is\r\nour Aryan race and its civilization to guard against the danger of\r\nbeing passively invaded and exterminated by the alarming fecundity of\r\nother human races? One must be blind not to recognize this danger. To\r\nestimate it at its proper value, it is not enough to put all \"savages\"\r\nand \"barbarians\" into one basket and all \"civilized\" into the other.\r\nThe question is far more complicated than this. Many savage and\r\nsemi-savage races become rapidly extinct on account of their\r\ncomparative sterility. Europeans have introduced among them so much\r\nalcohol, venereal disease and other plagues, that they promptly perish\r\nfrom want of the power of resistance. This is the case with the\r\nWeddas, the Todas, the Redskins of North America, the Australian\r\naboriginees, Malays and many others.\r\n\r\nThe question presents itself in another aspect with regard to negroes,\r\nwho are very resistant and extremely prolific, and everywhere adapt\r\nthemselves to civilized customs. But those who believe that negroes\r\nare capable of _acquiring_ a higher civilization without undergoing a\r\nphylogenetic cerebral transformation for a hundred thousand years, are\r\nUtopians. I cannot here enter into the details of this question. It\r\nseems obvious to me, however, that in the already considerable time\r\nduring which the American negroes have been under the influence of\r\nEuropean culture, they ought to have often demonstrated their power of\r\nassimilating it and of developing it independently, according to their\r\nown genius, if their brains were capable of so doing. Instead of this,\r\nwe find that negroes in the interior of the island of Haiti, formerly\r\ncivilized by France, then abandoned to themselves, have, with the\r\nexception of a few mulattoes, reverted to the most complete barbarism,\r\nand have even barbarized the French language and Christianity, with\r\nwhich they had been endowed.\r\n\r\nCompare with this the rapidity with which a civilized or civilizable\r\nrace, depending on its innate energy, assimilates our culture with or\r\nwithout Christianity! We need only look at what has happened in Japan\r\nduring the last thirty years, and what the Christian races of the\r\nBalkan countries have been doing after delivery from the yoke of the\r\nTurks--for example, the Roumanians, Bulgarians and Greeks.\r\n\r\nIt is by its fruits that we judge the value of the tree. The Japanese\r\nare a civilizable and civilized race, and must be treated as such. The\r\nnegroes, on the contrary, are not so; that is to say, they are only by\r\nthemselves capable of quite an inferior civilization, and only become\r\nadapted to our customs by a superficial veneer of civilization.\r\n\r\nUp to what point can the Mongolian, and even the Jewish race, become\r\nmixed with our Aryan or Indo-Germanic races, without gradually\r\nsupplanting them and causing them to disappear? This is a question I\r\nam incapable of answering. If it were only a question of the Japanese\r\nthere would be no serious difficulty and the assimilation would be\r\nbeneficial. But the Chinese and some other Mongolian races constitute\r\nan imminent danger for the very existence of the white races. These\r\npeople eat much less than ourselves, are contented with much smaller\r\ndwellings, and in spite of this produce twice as many children and do\r\ntwice as much work. The connection of this with the sexual question is\r\nnot difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nPossibly we might make a compact with the Mongols, and the Chinese in\r\nparticular, which would allow both races to live on the earth without\r\nannihilating each other. I am quite convinced that we have more to\r\nfear from their blood and their work than from their arms. Some time\r\nago experts in Far-Eastern questions predicted that the world would\r\nend by becoming Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITIVE TASKS\r\n\r\nThe elimination of the abuses and dangers, pointed out under the\r\nheading of negative tasks, would prepare the soil for a healthier and\r\nmore ideal development of the sexual relations of humanity in the\r\nfuture. These require the prevention of blastophthoric deterioration\r\nof germ cells, as well as all pathological degeneration of sexual\r\nintercourse. They also require true and natural affection, free from\r\nthe influences of prejudice and money, and capable of surviving\r\namorous intoxication. Lastly, they require a natural human\r\norganization, adapted to the social welfare, the duties of parents\r\ntoward their children, and the rights they have over them.\r\n\r\n=Human Selection.=--This is impossible to attain without recourse to\r\nartificial means, which have hitherto been generally condemned, or\r\nemployed with an unhealthy and corrupt object. I refer to the\r\ndistinction between satisfaction of the sexual appetite and the\r\nprocreation of children.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is true that the two things are inseparably connected in\r\nplants and animals, it is equally true that the culture and social\r\ndevelopment of humanity all over the world have given rise to\r\nconditions and necessities other than those which formerly existed,\r\nconditions which at the present day are so clearly evident that they\r\ncannot be disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for existence, as it obtains between the different animal\r\nspecies, hardly exists any longer in man. The latter has now to fight\r\nwith microbes, and other infinitely small things of the same nature.\r\nThe combat between man and man, in the form of international warfare,\r\nis approaching its end. The wars of the present day, as foolish as\r\nthey are formidable, are rapidly becoming absurd. We may even hope\r\nthat the supreme struggle which is impending between the Aryan and\r\nMongolian races will end in peaceful agreement.\r\n\r\nIs it, therefore, rational to abandon the quantitative and qualitative\r\nregulation of the procreation of children to natural selection--that\r\nis to say to brutal chance, disease, famine or infanticide--at a time\r\nof human evolution when science contends with the greatest success\r\nagainst accident, disease, infant mortality and famine?\r\n\r\nOur strong sexual appetite is no longer in proportion to the\r\nexigencies of procreation, nor to the means of providing food for our\r\ndescendants, nor to the right of the latter to better or even\r\ntolerable existence, for the simple reason that the weak, the diseased\r\nand the children are no longer eliminated as in former times among\r\nprimitive races by infanticide, epidemics, wild-beasts, neglect or war\r\n(it is now the strong and courageous who are eliminated by the\r\nlatter). But it is not in our power to modify our instinctive and\r\nhereditary sexual appetite, while we have always at hand the necessary\r\nmeans to regulate and improve procreation.\r\n\r\nNo prejudice, no dogma, no repetition of old maxims, based on\r\nso-called immutable natural laws, can stand against such simple and\r\nelementary truths. We like to call \"natural laws\" what to our limited\r\nknowledge appears regular in nature. We formulate a law, and too often\r\nmake an idol, instead of always making further examinations, in the\r\nlight of new truths, to see if these so-called laws hold good. But the\r\nnew truths are there, crying for recognition. The sheet-anchor is in\r\nour hands, in the form of measures to prevent or regulate conception.\r\n\r\nWe must, therefore, have recourse to these measures, with prudence,\r\nemploying them only at first where they are most necessary, and\r\nespecially insisting on the procreation of numerous children wherever\r\nmental and moral strength is combined with bodily health. In this\r\nconnection I am strongly opposed to the neo-Malthusians, who simply\r\npropose to diminish the number of births indiscriminately, as well as\r\nto the religious dogmas, especially Catholic, which, under the\r\nfallacious pretext of so-called divine inspiration, would hinder the\r\nprogress of the social sciences.\r\n\r\nHuman selection is the principle which should lead us to the object to\r\nbe attained in the remote future. It is not by legal constraint, but\r\nby universal instruction, that we shall obtain general recognition and\r\nacceptance of this principle. We have proved in Chapter VI, with\r\nregard to sexual selection, that women are much more exclusive in\r\ntheir choice than men, and that among savages they prefer courage and\r\nbodily strength. At the present day, owing to change of customs,\r\ncultured and intelligent women are, on the contrary, much less\r\nattracted by man's physical strength than by his intellectual\r\nsuperiority or genius. This gives us a very important indication of\r\nthe selection we desire, and confirms the necessity of instructing\r\nwomen in sexual matters. I foresee that the enlightened and\r\nintelligent women are those who will support human selection with the\r\ngreatest energy and success.\r\n\r\nI repeat here that it is not our object to create a new human race of\r\nsuperior beings, but simply to cause gradual elimination of the unfit,\r\nby suppressing the causes of blastophthoria, and sterilizing those who\r\nhave hereditary taints by means of a voluntary act; at the same time\r\nurging healthier, happier and more social men to multiply more and\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nA profound study of blastophthoria and all the phenomena of the mneme\r\nand normal heredity leaves no doubt on the possibility of attaining\r\nthis object. Is not the quality of dogs improved by breeding from the\r\ngood and eliminating the bad? Are not certain families distinguished\r\nin their character, work and intelligence, because for many\r\ngenerations their ancestors have preserved these qualities and\r\nmaintained the family type by means of careful marriages? On the other\r\nhand, are not cowardice, falseness and meanness, etc., reproduced with\r\nquite as much certainty in other families? I refer the reader to the\r\ndescription given by Jörger of the disastrous effects of alcoholic\r\nblastophthoria and bad heredity produced during nearly two centuries\r\nin the numerous members of a family of vagabonds (vide Chapter XI).\r\n\r\nOne must be blinded by religious prejudice to deny such striking\r\ntruths. No doubt, our pathological degenerations and our\r\ncross-breeding are so infinitely complex that at any time atavism may\r\nproduce ecphoria of better children derived from bad parents, and that\r\nof inferior children derived from better parents. We have seen in the\r\nfirst chapter the complex relations which exist between these\r\nphenomena. We must not allow ourselves to be deceived by the\r\nappearances of certain particular cases.\r\n\r\nWhat then are the types of men which we should endeavor to produce?\r\n\r\n=Types to Eliminate.=--First of all we must understand that negative\r\naction is much easier than positive. It is more easy to mention the\r\ntypes which should not be allowed to multiply than those which should.\r\nThese are, in the first place, all criminals, lunatics, and imbeciles,\r\nand all individuals who are irresponsible, mischievous, quarrelsome or\r\namoral. These are the persons who do the most harm in society, and\r\nintroduce into it the most harmful taints. It is the same with\r\nalcoholics, opium-eaters, etc., who, although often capable in other\r\nrespects, are dangerous by their blastophthoric influence. Here the\r\nonly remedy consists in the suppression of the use of narcotics, for\r\nit is no use eliminating a few narcotized individuals as long as a\r\ngreater number is always being produced.\r\n\r\nPersons predisposed to tuberculosis by heredity, chronic invalids, the\r\nsubjects of rickets, hemophilia, and other persons incapable of\r\nprocreating a healthy race owing to inherited diseases or bad\r\nconstitution, form a second category of individuals who ought to avoid\r\npropagation, or do so as little as possible.\r\n\r\n=Types to Perpetuate.=--On the other hand, men who are useful from the\r\nsocial point of view--those who take a pleasure in work and those who\r\nare good tempered, peaceful and amiable should be induced to multiply.\r\nIf they are endowed with clear intelligence and an active mind, or\r\nwith an intellectual or artistic creative imagination, they constitute\r\nexcellent subjects for reproduction. In such cases certain taints\r\nwhich are not too pronounced may be passed over.\r\n\r\nTrue will-power, _i.e._, perseverance in the accomplishment of\r\nrational resolutions, and not the tyrannical and obstinate spirit of\r\ndomination, is also one of the most desirable qualities which ought to\r\nbe reproduced. Will-power must not be confounded with impulsiveness,\r\nwhich is rather the antinomy of it, but often deceives superficial\r\nobservers, and makes them believe in the existence of a strong will,\r\nbecause of the violent manner in which it tries to realize momentary\r\nimpulsive resolutions.\r\n\r\n=Human Social Value.=--We have seen that, owing to traditional\r\nroutine, the intellectual merit of a young man is unfortunately judged\r\nby the results of examinations. To succeed in these, a good memory and\r\nstrong mental receptivity are all that is necessary. It follows from\r\nthis that nonentities often attain the highest social positions, while\r\noriginality, creative power, perseverance, honesty, responsibility and\r\nduty take a back place. I refer the reader to what I have said on the\r\nestimation of human value, especially in the Landerziehungsheime\r\n(Chapter XVI). They should be estimated according to their utility in\r\npractical social life, where the qualities of will and creative\r\nimagination play a more considerable part than memory and rapidity in\r\nassimilating the ideas of others.\r\n\r\nBut we have seen that the standard of ordinary examinations is false,\r\neven as regards pure intelligence. Critical judgment and imaginative\r\npower of combination have a much greater intellectual value than\r\nmemory or the power of assimilation. It is, therefore, not to be\r\nwondered at that the boy who is at the top of his class so often turns\r\nout a failure, while the dunce who failed in his examinations\r\nsometimes becomes a genius or at any rate a very useful and capable\r\nman. From such facts, which are extremely common, it is falsely\r\nconcluded, by a kind of fatalism, that \"one never knows what will\r\nbecome of a man, for personalities change so much.\" This false\r\nconclusion is simply due to the erroneous criterion which is used in\r\nthe evaluation of childhood, combined with the disgust inspired in\r\nstrong and original minds by our schools.\r\n\r\nDiseases and other accidents may sometimes hinder the development of\r\ngood dispositions, or even cause them to abort completely.\r\nNevertheless, we shall rarely make false prophecies if we begin by\r\navoiding the gross errors that we have pointed out in the mental\r\nevaluation of youth. It is also necessary to institute extensive\r\npsychological observations on the development of individuals, and in\r\nthe value of their work at adult age compared with their peculiarities\r\nobserved in childhood. I am certain that in this way the social value\r\nof a young man, or even a child, and in general all members of human\r\nsociety, could be calculated in advance in a more exact way.\r\n\r\n=Domestic Animals and Plants.=--The weak constitution of the domestic\r\nvarieties of plants and animals has been used as an argument against\r\nhuman selection. If the animal and vegetable varieties which we raise\r\nby artificial selection have not enough strength when left to\r\nthemselves, this is due to the fact that in creating them we have not\r\nconsulted their interests in the struggle for existence, but only our\r\nown. For example, we raise for our own use fat pigs which can scarcely\r\nwalk, pear trees with succulent fruit which has very few seeds, etc.\r\nIt is obvious that these monstrosities cannot be expected to maintain\r\nthemselves in the struggle for existence. Human selection, on the\r\ncontrary, is only concerned with what is advantageous for man,\r\nindividually as well as socially. It is, therefore, not a question of\r\na Utopian hypothesis, but of facts, the daily consequences of which we\r\ncan observe in society, if we only look at them without prejudice.\r\n\r\n=Calculation of Averages.=--Francis Galton has studied this question\r\nby the aid of the law of variations and by the calculation of\r\nprobabilities. This law only deals with so-called fortuitous elements,\r\ndue to thousands of minute causes which act to a great extent against\r\neach other and become mutually compensated in their general effect, so\r\nthat the two extremes are always represented by small numbers and the\r\naverage by large numbers. But, when certain special and greater forces\r\ncome into play, the general resultant is deviated in one direction or\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nGalton shows that this law applies to social relations and mental\r\nvalues as well as to the stature of the body. In a given society there\r\nare always some individuals who are very good, some very bad, and many\r\nmediocrities. When a powerful general factor, such as alcohol or\r\ncorruption by money, lowers all the individual values, the total value\r\nof the whole scale of capacities is lowered. Galton shows that the\r\naverage values can be appreciably raised by inducing the class of\r\nhigher values to reproduce themselves, and by preventing the lower\r\nvalues from doing so.\r\n\r\nProf. Jules Amann has shown how the immigration of the Huguenots into\r\nSwitzerland and Germany after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes by\r\nLouis XIV (1685) contributed to raise the mental level in these\r\ncountries and continues to do so at the present day.\r\n\r\n=Visions of the Past and Future.=--It is always sad to see capable,\r\nhard-working men and women, very useful from the social point of view,\r\nremaining sterile, simply on account of our social or religious\r\nprejudices; whereas, for the benefit of the community, they ought to\r\nmarry as young as possible and procreate numerous children.\r\n\r\nI have already said (the idea is found in André Couvreur's _La\r\nGraine_) that, if the sterility of one of the conjoints in marriage\r\nunfortunately leads to sterility in the other conjoint, the law, to\r\nmake good the loss, should allow bigamy or concubinage in favor of the\r\nsecond, when the latter is very capable. I cannot dwell too strongly\r\non the necessity of compensating for the sterilization which is so\r\nnecessary with ill-formed or incapable beings, as well as for the\r\nperiod of rest which is due to women between their confinements, by an\r\nenergetic multiplication of all useful and capable individuals.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, it is a real pity to see so many healthy, active and\r\nintelligent girls become old maids, simply because they have no money\r\nand do not wish to throw themselves at the first scamp who comes. It\r\nwould be far better to allow a little free polygamy, with complete\r\nequality of the two sexes and certain legal precautions, than to lose\r\nso much good seed and grow so many weeds. I refer the reader to what I\r\nhave said on the duties of parents toward their children, and on the\r\nduties of society toward the procreators of healthy children. (Chapter\r\nXIII.)\r\n\r\nIt would certainly take a century to obtain any appreciable\r\nimprovement in the quality of a race by this procedure, even if it\r\nwere carried out in a methodical and general way. At the end of a few\r\ncenturies our descendants might recognize the happiness that they owe\r\nto our efforts. They would also no doubt be astonished at being\r\ndescended from such a race of barbarians, and at having so many\r\ndrunkards, criminals and imbeciles among their ancestors. The mingling\r\nof mysticism in sexual life, which now exists under the name of\r\nreligion, would appear to them almost the same as idolatry and the\r\npractice of \"magicians\" among savage races appears to us.\r\n\r\nAs to the effects of alcoholic drinks and prostitution, these would\r\ngive them almost the same impression as the instruments of torture of\r\nthe Middle Ages which we see exhibited in museums, or the horrors of\r\nthe Inquisition, or burning at the stake for witchcraft.\r\n\r\nMany of my readers will no doubt regard my comparisons as exaggerated\r\nor fanatical, because, imbued as we are with contemporary thought, we\r\ncannot, without a great effort of imagination and having at our\r\ndisposal much experience and many objects of comparison, identify\r\nourselves with the thought of the past or that of the future. I\r\nrecommend persons who cannot appreciate this fact to read the \"Key to\r\nUncle Tom's Cabin,\" by Harriet Beecher-Stowe (not the novel itself).\r\nThis book contains numerous documents relating to the time of negro\r\nslavery before the American war of secession. When they read what\r\nhappened at that time, for example, advertisements in the public\r\njournals of dogs trained to track escaped slaves, they will perhaps\r\nagree with me. Pious pastors then gave their support to slavery, as\r\nthey often do now to alcohol. What now appears to us as monstrous\r\nseemed then quite natural.\r\n\r\n=Reform in Education.=--After human selection, I consider pedagogic\r\nreform in the sexual and other domains as the most important of\r\npositive reforms. (Vide Chapters XVII and XIII.) Although good quality\r\nin the germ is one of the fundamental conditions for man's happiness,\r\nit is not sufficient. Just as we can obtain by education comparatively\r\nuseful individuals from comparatively defective germs, so can we more\r\neasily damage phylogenetically good germs, by evil influences during\r\ntheir ontogeny.\r\n\r\nSociety should devote all its care to the good general education of\r\nthe body and mind of children. It should do everything possible to\r\ndevelop harmoniously the intelligence, sentiments, will, character,\r\naltruism and æsthetics, after the manner of the Landerziehungsheime,\r\nwhich we have described in Chapter XVII. Every good hereditary type\r\nshould be given the opportunity for free expansion, by means of\r\nrational education and work.\r\n\r\nWith regard to individuals who are defective by heredity, their better\r\ndispositions might be developed up to a certain point and made to\r\nantagonize the bad dispositions, so that the latter should not\r\npredominate in the brain. (Vide Chapter XVII.)\r\n\r\nIn spite of the great importance of rational pedagogy, we must not\r\nforget that it is incapable of replacing selection. It serves for the\r\nimmediate object, which is to utilize in the best possible way human\r\nmaterial as it exists at present; but by itself it cannot in any way\r\nimprove the quality of the future germ. It can, however, by\r\ninstructing youth on the social value of selection, prepare it to put\r\nthe latter in action.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTOPIAN IDEAS ON THE IDEAL MARRIAGE OF THE FUTURE\r\n\r\nThe outward life of man is largely influenced by events of the moment;\r\nbut his inner life is determined by memories of the past combined with\r\nheredity, and thus gives rise to efforts toward the future. The past\r\nshould never be allowed to dominate the present or the future, but\r\nshould combine past experience with new impressions, and constitute a\r\nprolific source of ideas and resolutions.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of the future pre-supposes people to be completely\r\ninstructed from their childhood in natural sexual intercourse and its\r\neventual dangers. It pre-supposes man brought up without alcohol or\r\nother narcotics, possessing the right to utilize the produce of his\r\nwork for life and the maintenance of his own person, but not that of\r\ncapitalizing for himself or his children, nor of making legacies to\r\nothers, _i.e._, of founding by the aid of money a power for the\r\nexploitation of others. Everyone will know from his childhood that\r\nwork is a necessary condition for the existence of all.\r\n\r\nBrought up in common with absolutely equal rights, girls and boys will\r\nbe aware of the differences in their life tasks, such as differences\r\nof sex and individuality indicate them. Till the age of sixteen, or\r\nperhaps longer, they will have been instructed in the schools by\r\nsimultaneous development of intelligence, bodily and technical\r\nexercises, æsthetics, moral and social sentiments and will. Without\r\nfrightening them with the specter of eternal punishment, and without\r\nalluring them by the promise of paradise after death, they will have\r\nbeen taught that the object of our transient individual existence is\r\ncontinual effort to attain a pure human ideal. They will have learnt\r\nto find the truest satisfaction in the accomplishment of their\r\ndifferent duties, and in work in common for the benefit of society.\r\nThey will also have learnt to despise frivolity and luxury, to attach\r\nno importance to personal property and to put all their ambition into\r\nthe quantity and quality of their work.\r\n\r\nThe sexual appetite will manifest itself in different individuals at\r\ndifferent ages. Trained from childhood not to yield to every desire,\r\nbut to subordinate their appetites to the welfare of the community,\r\nthey will not yield immediately. Moreover, they will know the\r\nsignification of this appetite. They will also know that their\r\npatience will not be tried too long, and that they may speak openly on\r\nsexual subjects to their masters and parents and even to their\r\ncompanions of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nWhat will be the consequences of such a state of things? Attachments\r\nwill be formed early. But, instead of making all kinds of calculations\r\nconcerning money, social position, etc.; instead of concealing their\r\nthoughts in the form of conventional politeness; instead of avoiding\r\nan honest explanation of the knotty point, or, at the most passing\r\nover this explanation like a cat on hot cinders; instead of trying to\r\ndazzle by their charms the one they wish to capture, the lovers of the\r\nfuture will be much more frank because they will have less reason to\r\ndissimulate. They will exchange plans for the future, and will\r\nmutually test each other's constancy and loyalty without fear of\r\nscandal and slander.\r\n\r\nThe two sexes will be able to enter into free relations with each\r\nother, first of all because they will both be instructed in sexual\r\nlife, and secondly, because manners and customs will be more free.\r\nWithout actual sexual intercourse, two lovers will thus be able to see\r\nwhether their temperaments are well adapted to each other.\r\n\r\nThen, thanks to its liberty, the period of betrothal will allow a free\r\ninterchange of ideas on life between the parties concerned, so that\r\nthey will soon find out whether they are likely or not to live\r\nharmoniously in conjugal union. Questions of heredity, procreation and\r\neducation will be dealt with calmly and freely. This will be certainly\r\nmore moral than the present conversations between betrothed couples,\r\n\"well-brought up,\" who, apart from certain conventional degrees of\r\nflirtation, hardly dare mention anything but commonplaces.\r\n\r\nA young man of talent, who wishes to continue his studies, will not be\r\nprevented from marrying. He may, for example, marry at twenty-four a\r\nyoung girl of eighteen and continue his studies till he is twenty-six.\r\nThe inconvenience will be slight, for the habits of life will be\r\nsimpler, and he can easily, by anticonceptional measures, avoid having\r\nchildren for a year or two.\r\n\r\nWhat will marriage be like? First of all, all useless luxury and\r\nconventional formality will be reduced to a minimum. The husband and\r\nwife will both work, either together, or each on their own account,\r\naccording to circumstances. Part of the work will naturally be devoted\r\nto the children. As at present, the husband will be able to\r\nparticipate in the personal education of the children, if he is more\r\ndisposed than the wife.\r\n\r\nEquality in the rights of the two sexes and matriarchy (vide Chapter\r\nXIII) will not render conjugal relations less intimate, but will, on\r\nthe contrary, deepen their roots by raising their moral value. There\r\nwill be less time to shine in society; dinner-parties and society\r\nfunctions of all kinds will be unknown; these things are for the idle\r\nrich, who have time to kill and money to spend. If a friend comes, and\r\nthere is time to receive him and something for him to eat, he will be\r\ninvited to take \"potluck\" with his family.\r\n\r\nClothes will be simple, comfortable and hygienic. Dwellings will be\r\nartistic, æsthetic and scrupulously clean. Pomp and luxury are not\r\nart, and are sometimes so overdone that they wound the most elementary\r\nsense of æsthetics.\r\n\r\nIf the occupation of the married couple or the number of their\r\nchildren render domestic servants necessary, the latter will not have\r\nthe same position in the family as our present servants. Their\r\neducation and social position being the same as those of the members\r\nof the family, they will take the position of companions rather than\r\nservants. No domestic work will be considered as degrading.\r\n\r\nIf the marriage is sterile, the conjoints will adopt orphans or\r\nchildren from other large families. In certain cases, of which we have\r\nspoken, concubinage may be preferred which, with such a change in\r\nsocial organization, will amount to bigamy; but here everything will\r\nbe done openly and by mutual agreement. In such cases any one who\r\ncannot overcome jealousy will be divorced.\r\n\r\nIf, in spite of everything, a marriage is not happy, owing to\r\nincompatibility of character, the marriage (or sexual contract) will\r\nbe dissolved, after legal provision for the children and their\r\neducation. After this each of the conjoints will be free to marry\r\nagain. This last contingency will probably not be more frequent than\r\nit is as present, possibly less, especially when there are children,\r\nfor divorce is always painful when there are children to be brought\r\nup.\r\n\r\nWork, and the effort of striving toward the ideal of social life, are\r\nthe best and most healthy distractions for the sexual appetite. It is\r\nthe idleness, luxury and corruption of large cities which cause it to\r\ndegenerate. Moreover, work revives love and leaves little time for\r\nfamily disputes.\r\n\r\nWith a little independence of character, and abandonment of old\r\nprejudices, we can even now realize our scheme to a great extent.\r\n\r\n=The Art of Loving Long.=--The ideal true love often only shows itself\r\nafter the first amorous intoxication has subsided. In order to remain\r\nharmonious, love requires above all things the higher psychic\r\nirradiation of intimate sympathetic sentiments associated with the\r\nsexual appetite, with which they should always remain intimately\r\nconnected, or at any rate as long as the duration of the active sexual\r\nlife of man. Later on, in the evening of life, the first are\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nThe great error into which most men fall who marry is to rely on the\r\ncivil and religious bonds of matrimony. As soon as the union is\r\nsealed, they return to their usual habits and mode of life. Each\r\nexpects much from the other and gives as little as possible. When\r\namorous sexual intoxication is over, the husband no longer finds any\r\ncharm in his wife, he becomes enamored of other women to whom he\r\ndevotes his attention, reserving his bad temper for his wife, while\r\nthe latter takes no more trouble to please him.\r\n\r\nI agree that a man cannot for long conceal his true nature; we are\r\nwhat we are by heredity. Nevertheless, the art of being amiable may be\r\nacquired by habit and education, an art which the poorest may employ.\r\nEducation should never cease during life. Along with the higher\r\nsentiments of love and mutual respect, lasting sexual attraction is a\r\nlink of inestimable value in maintaining a long and happy union\r\nbetween man and woman in marriage.\r\n\r\nThe married couple should, therefore, avoid everything which may\r\nrupture this link. The wife should devote herself to making the home\r\nattractive to her husband. The latter, on his part, should neither\r\nregard his wife as a mere housekeeper, nor only as an object for the\r\nsatisfaction of his sexual appetite. Such a conception of woman and\r\nmarriage is unfortunately very common and is incompatible with true\r\nconjugal happiness.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is not enough for the husband to esteem and\r\nrespect his wife as a faithful companion, to whom he is united in a\r\npurely intellectual way. For the couple to find lasting and complete\r\nhappiness in marriage, love, however ideal it may be, should be\r\naccompanied by sexual enjoyment. In short, intellectual and\r\nsentimental harmony should be combined with sensual harmony in a\r\nsingle and sublime symphony. The husband should not only regard his\r\nwife as the incarnation of all the domestic virtues, but should also\r\ncontinue to imagine her as the Venus of his early love.\r\n\r\nThis condition may be realized even when youth has passed away,\r\nprovided the deep sympathetic sentiments of an ideal love have truly\r\nexisted and are maintained. The wife will then continue to be for her\r\nhusband the goddess she has always been. But if this condition is not\r\nrealized it is not always easy for the husband, with his polygamous\r\ndisposition, to remain insensible to the charms of other women.\r\nHowever, habit and imagination may do much to correct this tendency.\r\n\r\nI think the following advice may be useful to the husband (and\r\noccasionally also to the wife). When his sexual passion is excited by\r\nanother woman and he is in danger of succumbing, he should endeavor,\r\nby the aid of his imagination, to clothe his own wife with the charms\r\nof his would-be seducer. With a little determination this measure will\r\noften succeed; he will thus strengthen his sexual desire toward his\r\nown wife, and perhaps increase hers also. In this way, a flame which\r\nthreatened to destroy conjugal happiness may sometimes serve to\r\nstrengthen it, by reviving afresh the mutual feelings of love and\r\ndesire. In the first part of his \"Wahlverwandtschaften\" (elective\r\naffinities), Goethe designates this phenomenon by the term _mental\r\nadultery_; but I am of the opinion that it is rather the expression of\r\na _mental conjugal fidelity_ which is strengthened by sensual\r\nsubstitution.\r\n\r\nWhen there is true love and good-will on both sides, such experiences\r\nmay often help toward the gradual consolidation of conjugal relations.\r\nNot only may a deviated passion be brought back to the conjugal bed,\r\nbut certain discords may be restored to harmony, and the couple may\r\nfind new desire and mutual affection which have been put to the test.\r\n\r\n=Matriarchism.=--With regard to family relations there is an important\r\npoint to consider, which we have already touched upon in Chapter XIII.\r\nThe power of man and of patriarchism has had the result of giving the\r\nfather's name to the family. This system is not only unnatural, but\r\nalso has deplorable effects. If it is true that the germ of the\r\nindividual (_Chromosomes_, Chapter I) inherits on the average as much\r\nfrom the father as from the mother, the latter is more closely\r\nconnected with it from all other points of view. Races in which the\r\nmaternal influence predominates in the family, not only in name but\r\nalso in other respects, have better understood the voice of nature.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the mother carries the child for nine months in her\r\nwomb, and for many years after birth is more intimately associated\r\nwith it than the father, gives her a natural right which the father\r\ncannot claim. Children ought, therefore, to be named after the mother.\r\nMoreover, in case of divorce, it should be the rule for children to be\r\nrestored to the mother, unless there are special reasons for another\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in the conditions of modern civilization we cannot\r\nreturn to matriarchism in its primitive sense. An old patriarch cannot\r\nbecome the sole sovereign of all his descendants without the\r\noccurrence of grave abuses, no more can this power devolve on a\r\ngrandmother. Apart from denomination in the maternal line, I mean by\r\nmatriarchism, the legal privilege of the management of the family\r\nconferred on the wife, who is in reality the center of the family.\r\n\r\nI will sum up what appears to me to be required, in the following\r\npropositions:\r\n\r\n1. Denomination in the maternal line.\r\n\r\n2. With the exception of cases in which the wife loses her maternal\r\nrights owing to incapacity, bad conduct or insanity, etc., or when the\r\nlaw is obliged to deprive her of them, she alone will possess the\r\nguardianship and the management of her children during their minority.\r\n\r\n3. The wife will be proprietor and housekeeper of the house and\r\nhousehold. Her work of housekeeping and her maternal duties will be\r\nestimated at their just value, and will have the right to\r\ncompensation, equivalent to the husband's work in his business.\r\n\r\n4. As long as conjugal union exists, the husband has the right to live\r\nin his wife's house, for the protection he gives to the family, for\r\nthe work he gives toward the house and the education of the children,\r\nas well as for his pecuniary contributions toward the expenses of\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n5. With the exception of contributions to the house and education, and\r\nto the feeding and clothing of the children, the product of the\r\nhusband's work and private fortune belong to him, just as the product\r\nand fortune of his wife are her own property. In the case of divorce\r\nthere will then be no difficulty in separating the two properties.\r\nExcepting in cases mentioned in the second proposition, which will be\r\ndecided by law, the children will belong to the mother only. But as\r\nlong as he lives and is able to work, the divorced father must\r\ncontinue to contribute to the maintenance and education of the\r\nchildren he has procreated, till they come of age.\r\n\r\nThese propositions have only a legal value, and will only be required\r\nwhen the conjoints cannot come to a mutual understanding. They in no\r\nway concern those who are able to live together in mutual concord. A\r\nweak and passive woman will continue as before to subordinate herself\r\nto the advice and opinions of a husband stronger and wiser than\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that, after divorce or separation, things will\r\nnot always go smoothly, although more so than at present. The husband\r\nwill always have the right to have certain claims decided by law. When\r\nthe law is not exclusively in the hands of men, it will be more\r\ncapable of protecting the rights of women. Cases in which a mother is\r\nincapable of bringing up her own children, or where the father is\r\ncapable of great devotion and sacrifice are not now so rare, but they\r\nare nevertheless exceptional.\r\n\r\n=The Present Day.=--It is not to be expected that the above\r\npropositions will find much support at the present day among the\r\nmajority of people, still less that they will soon be realized by the\r\ngoverning bodies, considering their conservative and idle tendencies\r\nand their inertia. It may be asked, on the other hand, whether the\r\npresent laws do not already provide us with the ways and means of\r\nattaining the ideal that we propose. I already see two:\r\n\r\nFirst of all, as pointed out in Chapter XIII, we may enter into\r\ncontracts which make the properties entirely separate, and according\r\nto the local legislation in force, fulfill other of the above\r\npropositions. For instance, in some countries, the wife can preserve\r\nby contract the property and management of the house, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, illegitimate children now bear the family name\r\nof their mother; this is exactly what we desire. When concubinage is\r\nnot prosecuted and punished by law, a free marriage could be arranged\r\nby private contract which would fulfill the above conditions. Some\r\npersons, I admit, would require much courage to do this, for it is not\r\nevery one who can brave public opinion when he has a good reputation\r\nto lose. Moreover, such unions would not enjoy the protection of the\r\nState. By a little perseverance, however, the public might be induced\r\nto call the woman \"Mrs.\" instead of \"Miss.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible for unions of this kind between honorable persons\r\nto become more frequent, and gradually compel society to recognize\r\nfree unions as the equivalent of traditional, or so-called legal,\r\nmarriage, to accord them the same rights and recognize the children\r\nborn of them. The conjoints could be named by combining both family\r\nnames; for example, if Miss Martin enters into a free union with Mr.\r\nDurand, she might be called Mrs. Martin-Durand, and her husband Mr.\r\nDurand-Martin.\r\n\r\n=Conclusion.=--It may perhaps be thought that I am imagining the\r\nexistence of the purest ideal and the happiness of paradise in a world\r\nin which the hereditary quality of men will be no better than it is\r\nto-day. I hope that no reader who has followed me carefully will\r\nregard me as so ingenuous. Then as now there will be intrigues and\r\ndisputes, hatred, envy, jealousy, idleness, impropriety, falsehood,\r\nnegligence, temper, etc., but their power will be less. There will be\r\nless excuse for these bad qualities and those who possess them will be\r\nregarded as pathological individuals who should be eliminated as much\r\nas possible by means of proper selection, combined with good hygiene\r\nand thorough education.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, men of originality and high ideals will be able to\r\ndevelop much more freely and naturally than at present. They will no\r\nlonger be the slaves of power, money, prejudice and routine. They will\r\nnot be obliged to conform to religious hypocrisy, but will be able to\r\nspeak and act according to their convictions. Marriage, and sexual\r\nrelations in general, will no longer be a perpetual conventional\r\nfalsehood. The sentiments no longer fettered, will not be led astray\r\ninto mischievous ways by artificial excitement, so long as they do\r\nnot depend on unhealthy dispositions, for the pretexts and especially\r\nthe pecuniary inducement to commit evil actions and contract bad\r\nhabits will have been removed as far as possible.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason prostitution will become almost impossible, for it\r\nwill cease to have any reason for existence. Immoderate sexual\r\nintercourse, like other excesses, will not cease to exist, but will be\r\nkept in certain limits by the work which no one will be able to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his history of materialism (1874) F.A. Lange wrote as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"We lay down our pen and terminate our criticism at a time when Europe\r\nis agitated by the social question. In the vast social domain, all the\r\nrevolutionary elements of science, religion and politics meet together\r\nand seem prepared for a decisive battle. Whether this battle remains a\r\nsimple contest of minds or whether it takes the form of a cataclysm\r\nwhich will bury thousands of unfortunates in the ruins of a\r\ndisappearing period, one thing is certain:--the new epoch will only\r\nsucceed by abolishing egoism, and placing the work of improvement of\r\nthe human race in the hands of a human coöperative society, in place\r\nof our feverish work which has only personal interest at heart.\r\n\r\n\"The contests which are impending will be mitigated if the minds which\r\nare to direct the people are imbued with the knowledge of human\r\nevolution and historical phenomena.\r\n\r\n\"We must not abandon the hope that in the remote future great changes\r\nmay take place without defiling humanity with fire and bloodshed. It\r\nwould certainly be the finest reward for strenuous work of the human\r\nmind, if it could from this time prepare an easy way to that which a\r\ncertain future reserves for us, avoiding atrocious sacrifices and\r\nsaving the treasures of our civilization to be transmitted to the new\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, this prospect has little chance of realization, and we\r\ncannot disguise the fact that blind party passion goes on increasing,\r\nand that the brutal struggle of interests becomes more and more\r\nremoved from the influence of theoretical research. However, our\r\nefforts will not all be in vain, and truth will prevail in the end.\r\nIn any case the observer who thinks has no right to be silent, simply\r\nbecause at the present moment he has only a small number of\r\nlisteners.\"\r\n\r\nThirty years ago Lange's pessimism would be comprehensible; but ideas\r\nhave progressed since then, and the prospects of to-day give us more\r\ncourage for social work.\r\n\r\nThe Utopian ideas which I have expressed have in no way the pretension\r\nto be new. Analyzing the facts in the most diverse domains, I have\r\nsimply attempted to find those which seem to me suited to solve the\r\nsexual problem of the human race most advantageously under the present\r\nsocial conditions. Every one to-day admits that our sexual life leaves\r\nmuch to be desired, but is afraid of touching the crumbling edifice.\r\n\r\nI leave it to my readers to decide whether my ideas are nothing more\r\nthan Utopian, or whether they do not rather represent a realizable\r\nideal, begging them to reflect as calmly and independently as possible\r\nbefore giving their judgment.\r\n\r\nAfter all, we have to choose between pessimistic acceptance of the\r\nfatal decay of our race for the benefit of the Mongols, and an\r\nimmediate and energetic effort toward selective and educational\r\nimprovement, an effort which will alone be capable of reviving our\r\nhereditary vital energy. Whoever decides in favor of the latter\r\nalternative should occupy himself with the sexual question, and boldly\r\ndeclare war against the domination of private capital, the abuse of\r\nalcohol, and all the prejudices by which we are hampered. He should\r\nabandon the luxury and effeminate comfort of our time and return to\r\nthe principles of Lycurgus and the Japanese--to the education of\r\ncharacter and self-control by methodical training in continuous social\r\nwork combined with voluntary fatigue and privation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL REMARKS\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall no doubt be reproached for not having taken sufficient notice\r\nof other works on the subject of this book. I have, however, desired\r\nto express my own opinion without allowing myself to be unduly\r\ninfluenced by others. I will nevertheless make a few remarks on the\r\nbibliography of this subject.\r\n\r\nI may mention the celebrated work of the Italian physician,\r\nMantigazza, on the _Physiology of Love_. It is a curious fact that\r\nthis author, after his poetic descriptions of love, is in favor of\r\nprostitution. The German socialist, Bebel, has written a very\r\nremarkable book on woman in the past, the present and the future. In\r\nspite of scientific errors, which are easily excused in a self-made\r\nman who became one of the leaders of the German Reichstag, this book\r\nremains a veritable social monument on the sexual question. With the\r\nexception of his strong political bias, and the errors I have just\r\nmentioned I am, on the whole, in accord with the ideas of Bebel.\r\n\r\nAnother German author, Bölsche, (_Das Liebesleben in der Natur_) has\r\nrecently described love among all organized beings, including man,\r\nwith a tone of forced pleasantry which spoils the profound knowledge\r\nof the author on the zoölogical and other subjects which he treats.\r\n\r\nWith regard to German literature, I recommend the _Archiv für Rassen\r\nund Gesellschafts' Biologie_, edited by Doctor Plotz of Berlin. This\r\npublication has for its object the study of the causes of degeneration\r\nin our race and the remedies for it. Among other articles which have\r\nappeared in this publication I may specially mention those of\r\nShallmayer on _Heredity and Selection in the Life of Races_, and\r\nThurnwald, _Town and Country in the Life of the Race_. I may also\r\nmention Plotz: _Die Tüchtigkeit unserer Rasse und der Schutz der\r\nSchwachen_, 1895, and _Mutterschutz_, a journal for the reform of\r\nsexual ethics, 1905.\r\n\r\nFrance has always shone in the domain of the poetry of love and the\r\nart connected with it. Apart from the ancient classics I may refer to\r\nGeorge Sand, Alfred de Musset, Lamartine, and Madame de Stael. In the\r\npractical conception of free love, George Sand was in advance of her\r\ntime. Among modern authors there are Paul Bourget; André Couvreur, who\r\nin _La Graine_ deals with the problem of human selection; Brieux, who\r\nin _Les Avariés_, attacks the social tragedies of venereal disease.\r\nThe book of Vacher de Lapouge on social selection is full of\r\ninteresting ideas, although too much influenced by the unstable\r\nhypothesis of Gobineau. To make distinct zoölogical species of\r\ndolichocephalics and brachycephalics, as Vacher de Lapouge attempts,\r\nis a grave error in zoölogy. Charles Albert: _L'Amour Libre_, and\r\nQueyrat: _La Démoralization de l'idée sexuelle_, give the note of\r\ncontemporary change in ideas on the sexual question.\r\n\r\nIn _Le Mariage et les Théories Malthusiennes_ (Paris, 1906) Dr.\r\nGeorges Guibert recommends early marriage, but does not take account\r\nof human selection. Remy de Gourmont, _Physique de l'amour; Essai sur\r\nl'instinct sexuel_, Paris, 1903, describes, very pessimistically, love\r\nin the animal kingdom. Jeanne Deflou (_Le Sexualisme_, Paris, 1905)\r\nhas written a virulent feminine complaint against the injustice of the\r\nstronger sex.\r\n\r\nBut the French author who has given the most profound, the truest\r\ndescriptions of the psychology of love and the sexual appetite is\r\nundoubtedly Guy de Maupassant. No doubt his last illness caused him to\r\nproduce certain more or less regrettable works in which certain\r\npornographic traits appeared. He may, perhaps, be accused of having\r\ntoo often described the pathology of love, which, by the way, he\r\nadmirably understood. Perhaps also, he has too often dealt with\r\nexceptional situations and irresponsible passions. But these are only\r\ndetails, and we must admit that by drawing attention to the unhealthy\r\nfeatures of our modern sexual life, he compels the reader to reflect,\r\nand inspires him not only with disgust for evil but with profound\r\nsadness and a feeling of revulsion. He often reveals his predilection\r\nfor the refined, hypersensitive love of the boudoir which we have\r\nregarded here as a symptom of social degeneration. But this does not\r\nprevent his clear insight into the love of the proletariat, the\r\npeasant or the healthy man. He knows man as well as woman, and if he\r\nhas presented them most often under their least moral aspect it is\r\nbecause he has observed them closely. But occasionally he rises to the\r\ngreatest heights of the truest, purest and most profound love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbolitionism, 316\r\n\r\nAbortion,
