It is self-evident that no clear\r\nconception of a surgical operation, ancient or modern, can be formed from\r\na written description without some previous knowledge of the instruments\r\nintended to be used. Many interesting operations described in detail in\r\nthe classical authors are rendered obscure or quite unintelligible from\r\nlack of this knowledge. The learned Adams gives an accurate translation of\r\na long and involved chapter by Paulus Aegineta on the use of the vaginal\r\nspeculum, but remarks that owing to our want of knowledge of the specula\r\npossessed by the ancients the chapter is unintelligible. Daremberg says it\r\nis impossible to say what was the shape of any of the cutting instruments\r\nmentioned by Hippocrates. The steady progress of archaeological discovery\r\nhas gradually added find after find of surgical instruments, till now\r\nthere is scarcely a museum with any considerable number of antique _petits\r\nbronzes_ which does not number among its contents a few surgical\r\ninstruments, and in the Naples Museum alone there are hundreds. In several\r\ncases we know even the name of the original possessor of these and the\r\nspecial branch of surgery which he practised. There are thus open to us\r\nmaterials which were not available to the men of learning to whom I have\r\nreferred above, and the time seems opportune to undertake a systematic\r\nreview of all the materials at our disposal, and attempt to reconstruct\r\nthe surgical armamentarium of the ancients. Considering the importance of\r\nthe subject, it is surprising that no such systematic attempt has\r\npreviously been made. Indeed, comparatively little attention has been\r\ngiven to this department of archaeology. Literature bearing on it is\r\ncomparatively scarce. What we have is entirely continental, and consists\r\nof a series of reports of different finds with attempts to indicate the\r\nuses of the instruments described. In addition to these reports and the\r\nactual instruments scattered over various museums, we have at our disposal\r\nthe writings of the ancient authors themselves. In these a fair number of\r\ninstruments are minutely described, while many others are named, and here\r\nand there points about their shape are mentioned in different places; and\r\nby piecing these particulars together and deducing other facts from the\r\nnature of the manipulations the instruments are employed in, we can\r\ndescribe in detail, with a tolerable amount of certainty, a surprisingly\r\nlarge number of instruments. It must be confessed that these ancient\r\nclassics are rather difficult of access, surprisingly so considering that\r\nuntil a few decades ago they were reverenced as works of authority for\r\nmedical practice; but the fact seems to be that our predecessors were\r\nlargely content to draw their knowledge of these authors from mediaeval\r\nLatin translations. Part of one of the most interesting authors has never\r\nbeen published in the original Greek, and for our knowledge of it we are\r\ndependent on a sixteenth-century Latin translation, supplemented, it may\r\nbe, by fugitive consultations of codices in libraries and museums.\r\n\r\nOthers of the Greek texts have not been reprinted since the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and bristle with the ingenious but at first perplexing shorthand\r\ncontractions with which the Renaissance typographer imitated the Compendia\r\nof the manuscripts. These difficulties can be got over with patience,\r\nhowever, and the waste of gray matter necessary as a preliminary is not\r\nout of proportion to the results to be obtained. Even as a quarry for\r\nphilological materials the medical classics are far from being worked out,\r\nand it is surprising how many words one meets with which are not to be\r\nfound in the best Greek-English dictionaries.\r\n\r\nThe method pursued in the present investigation was to make a complete\r\nexamination of the classical medical, surgical, anatomical, and\r\npharmaceutical writings which have been preserved to us, copying out the\r\nportions in which an instrument was mentioned. These extracts were then\r\nrearranged in ledger form, each extract being classified under the heading\r\nof the instrument it referred to. Out of the enormous number of references\r\nthus obtained, those passages were selected which seemed to throw any\r\nlight on the shape and size of the instrument to which they referred.\r\nNext, an examination was made of the reports of finds in various\r\nlocalities; as many specimens in various museums were examined as\r\npossible; and annotations of classical texts were searched for any further\r\ninformation they might give. The total information thus gained is so\r\narranged that under the heading of each instrument will be found a series\r\nof selected extracts from different authors, with the deductions from them\r\nwhich it is possible to make regarding the appearance of the instrument,\r\nand an illustration is given of it from some ancient specimen where such\r\nis in existence. Failing actual ancient specimens, I have fallen back on\r\nmediaeval or ancient Arabian authors for illustration.\r\n\r\nI have omitted a discussion of the many interesting mechanical\r\ncontrivances for the reduction of deformities due to fracture and\r\ndislocation, and also of the splints, pads, and bandages for maintaining\r\nthese injuries in position. These form such a well-defined group that they\r\nmight fitly form the subject of a special monograph, and the illustrations\r\nrequired are of a different nature from those in the present volume. The\r\nmajority of these contrivances will be found described in a chapter by\r\nHeliodorus preserved in Oribasius. I have omitted also all reference to\r\nthe numerous forms of vessels in which the ancients prepared and stored\r\ntheir medicaments, with the exception of those which are intended for\r\ncarrying on the person. Some of these merge into forms which are common to\r\nboth drug and instrument cases, and it is impossible to separate them. It\r\nhas been necessary also to include as far as possible the instruments\r\ninvolved in the preparation and application of medicaments, as most of\r\nthese are either actually or potentially implements of minor surgery.\r\n\r\nThe volume opens with a short account of the ancient authors whose\r\nwritings have any bearing on the subject in hand. At the end of the book\r\nwill be found a bibliography of reports on finds, and a list of the most\r\ninteresting instruments to be found in various museums. The latter makes\r\nno pretence of being a complete inventory, although it might serve as a\r\nskeleton for the construction of a more comprehensive list at some future\r\ndate. The bibliography, on the other hand, is believed to be fairly\r\ncomplete. The bulk of the book consists of an attempt to reconstruct, in\r\nthe manner described above, the different instruments used in classical\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe books from which I have drawn most information are Brunner's _Die\r\nSpuren der römischen Ärzte auf dem Boden der Schweiz_, Deneffe's _Étude\r\nsur la Trousse d'un Chirurgien Gallo-Romain du III{e} Siècle_, Adams'\r\ntranslation of Paulus Aegineta, and the papers of Vulpes in the volume for\r\n1851 of the _Memorie della Regale Accademia Ercolanese di Archeologia_.\r\n\r\nDuring the five or six years which I have spent on this investigation I\r\nhave unsparingly laid all my friends under contribution whenever\r\nopportunity occurred; but among those to whom I am particularly indebted I\r\nmay mention Mr. M. G. Swallow of Baden, who has given me much assistance\r\nin working up the Swiss finds, Professor Alexander Ogston, under whom I\r\nspent many happy days as house-surgeon, and who has all along kept a\r\nfatherly eye on the progress of the work and encouraged me to proceed to\r\nthe end with a task which at times seemed inclined to swamp me, Mr. R. C.\r\nBosanquet, late director of the British Archaeological School at Athens,\r\nwho procured for me photographs of the instruments in the Athens museum,\r\nand Mr. H. R. Nielsen of Hartlepool, who has been the companion of my\r\nwanderings among the continental museums. I have also to thank my father,\r\nJohn Milne, LL.D., for much help at many different points.\r\n\r\nThe expense of visiting the museums in the North of France and of\r\nobtaining photographs of the instruments in them has been borne by a grant\r\nfrom the Carnegie University Research Fund.\r\n\r\nThis monograph was presented as the thesis which forms part of the\r\nexamination for the degree of M.D. of the University of Aberdeen, and it\r\nwas successful in gaining 'Highest Honours.'\r\n\r\n  HARTLEPOOL,\r\n  _April 19, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n

C. and who practised in Athens and other parts of Greece.\r\nThe 'Hippocratic Collection' is well known to consist of works which are\r\nnot all by Hippocrates himself; but as the pseudo-Hippocratic works all\r\nbelong to the classical period they are all admissible as evidence for our\r\npurpose, and for the sake of brevity I shall throughout refer to them as\r\nif all were by Hippocrates. Many interesting instruments are named in the\r\ncomparatively small collection of treatises which make up the admittedly\r\ngenuine list of Hippocratic works, but, taking these along with the\r\npseudo-Hippocratic works, the number of instruments named in the whole\r\ncollection is surprisingly large, comprising as it does trephines, bone\r\ndrills, probes, needles, tooth forceps, uvula forceps, bone elevators,\r\nuterine sounds, graduated dilators, cranioclasts, and others. After\r\nHippocrates there is a break in the continuity of the literature, and for\r\nsome hundreds of years Greek medicine is represented almost entirely by\r\nthe Alexandrian Schools. The first printed edition of the Hippocratic\r\nworks was a Latin translation printed at Rome in 1525, followed by the\r\nAldine edition of the Greek text printed at Venice in the following year.\r\nOther editions are the edition of Föes (1595), Van der Linden (1665), Kühn\r\n(Leipzig, 1821). Later editions are the text with a French translation by\r\nLittré (10 vols., 1849-61), a scholarly edition by Ermerins with a Latin\r\nrendering (1859-64), and an excellent translation of the genuine works of\r\nHippocrates by the world-famous Dr. Adams of Banchory (Sydenham Soc.\r\nTrans., 1849). The best edition, however, is the edition of Kuehlewein,\r\nbegun in 1894 and at present in course of publication by Teubner, Leipzig.\r\nThe later volumes have not yet appeared. For the portion of the text which\r\nis not contained in the first two volumes of Kuehlewein I have relied on\r\nthe edition of Kühn for most of the readings, although occasionally those\r\nof Van der Linden or Föes are to be preferred. The references given are to\r\nthe volumes and pages of Kühn's edition, but in this edition indications\r\nare given of the corresponding localities in the other editions so that\r\ncross-references to these can easily be made. There seems to be a\r\ndifferent arrangement in different editions of Föes, for Liddell and Scott\r\nsay the references in their Lexicon are to the pages in Föes but they do\r\nnot correspond in any way to the pagination of the edition before me\r\n(Frankfort, 1595).\r\n\r\nAulus Cornelius Celsus is the next writer we have. His system of medicine\r\nin eight books is a marvel of lucid arrangement, and his beautiful style\r\nmakes it a pleasure to read any of his works. The seventh book gives a\r\nmost interesting review of the surgery of the Alexandrian School. He\r\ndescribes many instruments in detail, although he names fewer special\r\ninstruments than some of the Greek writers as the Latin language lends\r\nitself less well to the formation of compound words than the Greek does.\r\nTo take one example only, Celsus has practically one word for all\r\nvarieties of forceps--vulsella, while the Greeks use many compounds like\r\nhair forceps (τριχο-λαβίς), flesh forceps (σαρκο-λάβος), tooth forceps\r\n(ὀδοντάγρα), stump forceps (ῥιζάγρα). Indeed, in the case of the two\r\nlatter words Celsus falls back on Greek to express himself. Celsus was\r\nfirst published in 1478. Another edition is that of Targa, 1769. The\r\neditions before me are those of Daremberg, published at Leipzig in 1859,\r\nand Védrènes (Paris, 1876). The latter contains illustrations of a\r\nconsiderable number of specimens from Italian and French museums.\r\n\r\nRufus of Ephesus (98-117 A. D.) has left little to interest us for our\r\nparticular purpose, as he merely mentions, without describing, a few\r\ninstruments, all of which are already known to us from other sources. The\r\nbest edition is that of Daremberg, Paris, 1879. A Latin translation of his\r\nworks will be found in _Medicae Artis Principes_ (Stephanus).\r\n\r\nAretaeus of Cappadocia has left us a work on Acute and Chronic Diseases.\r\nHe has few references to instruments, but such as they are they are\r\ninteresting, as he names some which are given by no other author. He has a\r\ntantalizing allusion to a work by himself on surgery which has not been\r\npreserved. There is a fine edition of the text, with an English\r\ntranslation by Adams of Banchory, in the Transactions of the Sydenham\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nGalen (130-200 A. D.) was a most voluminous writer, much of whose work\r\nremains and teems with matter of interest to us. Much information about\r\ninstruments is to be gained from even his purely anatomical writings. The\r\nmost accessible edition is that of Kühn (20 vols., Leipzig, 1821), but it\r\nis slipshod in the text, and even more so in the translation, which is in\r\nLatin.\r\n\r\nOribasius (325 A. D.) wrote an encyclopaedia of medicine, which is called\r\nΣυναγωγαὶ Ἰατρικαί--Collecta Medicinalia, in seventy books, only about one\r\nthird of which remain. This is the most interesting of his works from our\r\npoint of view, but he has left also a synopsis of the encyclopaedia called\r\nΣύνοψις, and a sort of first aid manual called Εὐπόριστα. I have used the\r\nedition of Daremberg and Bussemaker (1851-76).\r\n\r\nSoranus of Ephesus has left us a most valuable treatise on obstetrics and\r\ngynaecology, which, though written only for midwives, contains many\r\ninteresting references to instruments such as the speculum, uterine sound,\r\ncephalotribe, decapitator, and embryo hook. He lived in the reign of\r\nTrajan. Some of the chapters, of which the Greek is lost, have been\r\npreserved to us by his abbreviator Moschion. I have used the edition of\r\nRose published at Leipzig in 1882.\r\n\r\nMoschion (fifth century) translated into Latin the gynaecological and\r\nobstetrical part of the works of Soranus for the benefit of midwives who\r\ncould not speak Greek. This version is now lost, but we have a translation\r\nof it into Greek, made after the fall of the Western Empire and the\r\ndevelopment of the Greek-speaking Empire at Constantinople in the sixth\r\ncentury. There is an Edition of this by Gesner (Basle, 1566). Finally,\r\nthis Greek version of Moschion was translated back into barbarous Latin at\r\nsome early date, Barbour thinks by some member of the Schola Salernitana.\r\nThis was published at Venice by Aldus in the sixteenth century, and Rose\r\nhas prefaced his edition of Soranus with it. This work of Moschion is only\r\nof interest to us from the fact that he preserves to us the substance of\r\nsome chapters of which the original in Soranus is wanting.\r\n\r\nCaelius Aurelianus Siccensis, an African of the fourth or fifth century,\r\ntranslated the works of Soranus, both those on gynaecology and those on\r\ngeneral diseases, and he preserves some of Soranus which we would not\r\notherwise possess; but he writes in a barbarous Latin which, like the\r\nLatin of some other African writers on medical subjects, is calculated to\r\ncause great pain to any one not familiar with this particular style.\r\n\r\nAetius lived in the first half of the sixth century, and compiled a\r\nvoluminous treatise on medicine in sixteen books. He worked entirely with\r\nscissors and paste, but the result is the preservation to us of a large\r\nnumber of extracts from writers whose works would otherwise have entirely\r\ndisappeared, and his work is of great value for the study of instruments.\r\nIn 1534 an Aldine Edition of the first eight books was published, and,\r\nthough a translation of the whole work was published by Cornarius in\r\n1533-42 in Latin, six of the last eight books were never published in the\r\noriginal Greek. This is unfortunate for us, as for our purpose the\r\noriginal is the only thing of any great value, Greek being, as I have\r\nalready pointed out, a language richer in compounds than Latin is, and\r\nlending itself better to the coining of special names for special\r\ninstruments. Not that the sixteenth-century translator is ever at a loss\r\nfor a turn by which to express himself in Latin, but the turn, as often as\r\nnot, is by periphrasis just at the very point when we would have liked a\r\nvery exact equivalent for the Greek. The translation of the part of the\r\nwork of which we have the Greek shows that we cannot entirely depend on\r\nsome of these periphrases even where they appear definite, as in some\r\ncases an unwarrantable assumption is made about the form of an instrument.\r\nThus λιθουλκῷ is translated 'forcipe ad id facta' because in Cornarius's\r\ntime the instrument used for extracting stone from the bladder was a\r\nforceps, whereas it is doubtful whether there was in the Roman period\r\nanything more than a scoop, and, therefore, we are not entitled to\r\ntranslate λιθουλκός by anything more definite than 'stone extractor', its\r\netymological equivalent. Although, therefore, I have examined the latter\r\neight books of Aetius in the Latin translation, and although they contain\r\nsome of the most interesting information to be found in the whole work, I\r\nhave been very chary about laying stress on any deductions drawn from the\r\nLatin translation only. It may be noted that there are two ways of\r\nreferring to the different books in Aetius, according to whether the Greek\r\ntext or the translation of Cornarius is meant. Cornarius arranged his\r\nversion in four tetrabibli of four books each, whereas the Greek text is\r\nsimply numbered from i-viii. 'No vii.' of the Greek text is, therefore,\r\ncalled by Cornarius 'Tetr. ii. lib. iii.' The eleventh book was published\r\nby Daremberg in his edition of Rufus (1879), and the twelfth book was\r\npublished by Costomeris at Paris in 1892.\r\n\r\nPliny the Younger. Plinius Secundus (Rose, Leipzig, 1875). The writings of\r\nPliny contain little information of any kind and are absolutely of no use\r\nfor our purpose.\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus (45 A. D.). The edition I have examined is named\r\n'Scribonii Largi Compositiones' and is edited by Helmreich, Leipzig, 1887.\r\nThe work of Scribonius Largus is entirely pharmaceutical, but he gives\r\nmany references to appliances by which medicaments were prepared in the\r\nsurgery.\r\n\r\nMarcellus Empiricus (300 A. D.) wrote a work on pharmacy, of large size\r\nbut little value, and in a poor style. There are a few passages bearing on\r\nimplements of minor surgery. A good deal is copied from Largus. Aldus\r\npublished the text by Cornarius at Venice in his collection of Medici\r\nAntiqui (1547), republished by Stephanus (_Medicae Artis Principes_),\r\n1567. The edition I have used is that of Helmreich (Leipzig, 1889).\r\n\r\nTheodorus Priscianus, alias Octavius Horatianus, lived in the fourth\r\ncentury and has left a work, in three books, called _Euporiston_. It is a\r\ncompilation in African Latin of extracts from Galen, Oribasius, &c. The\r\nstyle of the Latin is so barbarous that it really must be seen to be\r\nbelieved. There is a little information to be gathered about minor\r\ninstruments. The edition I have used is that of Rose, Leipzig, 1894. To\r\nthis edition are tacked on the medical remains of Vindicianus Afer, mere\r\nfragments without anything to interest us.\r\n\r\nThe works of Alexander Trallianus (526-605 A. D.) contain practically no\r\nsurgery at all, although I have managed to extract a few references of\r\nminor interest.\r\n\r\nThe last of the eminent Greek writers is Paulus Aegineta, a writer who\r\nprobably lived in the sixth and seventh centuries. This is getting rather\r\nlate in the day, it is true, but to omit the works of Paulus, or Paul, as\r\nhe is affectionately called by his admirers, would be to omit some of the\r\nmost valuable knowledge of ancient medicine we possess. Paul, like most of\r\nhis time, was a compiler, but he was a skilful one, and while he entirely\r\ndepends on Galen, Archigenes, Soranus, &c. for his information, he has\r\ngathered up the best of the medical knowledge of his time in a little\r\nencyclopaedia whose artistic completeness and orderly arrangement are not\r\nsurpassed by any work of a corresponding nature at the present day. The\r\nwork is divided into seven books, the sixth of which deals with surgery\r\nand teems with information about instruments. Aldus published the entire\r\nGreek text at Venice in 1527. A fine English translation, with a most\r\nvaluable commentary, was published by Adams of Banchory for the Sydenham\r\nSociety in 1846. No one who reads it can wonder that Adams had a worldwide\r\nreputation for his knowledge of medical history. The important sixth book\r\nwas published along with a translation in French by Briau at Paris in\r\n1855.\r\n\r\nI have obtained a description of two very important instruments from the\r\nworks of Hero of Alexandria (285-222 B. C., ed. 1575). There are a few\r\ninteresting references to instruments in the works of the early Christian\r\nfathers. Tertullian is the only one of these I can claim to have\r\nsystematically searched, but in one of his sermons he refers to no less\r\nthan four surgical instruments, one of which is not described by any other\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nIt were a work of supererogation to recount the names of the other Greek\r\nand Roman writers whose works I have run through in a profitless search\r\nfor references to instruments. Some of these, such as Dioscorides, are of\r\ngreat importance in themselves though valueless for our purpose. Others,\r\nsuch as many of the minor Greek writers contained in the collection by\r\nIdeler entitled _Physici et Medici Graeci Minores_ (Berlin, 1841), and the\r\nminor Latin writers contained in the collection of _Medici Antiqui Omnes_\r\n(Aldus, 1547), are of little value of any kind.\r\n\r\nBefore the capture of Alexandria by Omar in 651, many Greek medical\r\nwritings had been translated into Syrian. At a later date such of these as\r\nhad escaped destruction were turned into Arabic by the scholars of Bagdad\r\n(Honain and his School), in the ninth century. These, introduced into\r\nSpain in the Middle Ages by the Moors, were again translated into Latin\r\nand supplied for many a day the greater part of the medical knowledge of\r\nEurope, until the study of the few Greek texts which had escaped\r\ndestruction showed the true origin of Arabian medicine. It will thus be\r\nseen that there is some information, in fact a great deal, to be had from\r\nthe study of the works of the Arabs, but the barbarous style of the Latin\r\nand the roundabout way in which the works have been preserved, having\r\npassed through translations of three different languages, preclude any\r\nvery exact deductions being drawn from them. Some of these works are\r\nprofusely illustrated with figures of instruments, but I have been careful\r\nnot to fall back on any of the Arabs except to support deductions drawn\r\nfrom more direct sources.\r\n\r\nThe chief Arab writers of interest to us are:--Serapion (800), Rhases\r\n(882), and Ali Abbas (after 950), all of Honain's School at Bagdad. The\r\nhuge work of Avicenna (born 980), _The Canon_, was much used by the Arabs.\r\nIt was published at Cordova, which became the Bagdad of the West after the\r\nArabs crossed to Spain in 811.\r\n\r\nThe work of Albucasis (ob. 1106) was also published at Cordova, and\r\ncontains much surgical information and has many illustrations of surgical\r\ninstruments, but these must be used with due caution. I have used the\r\nedition published at Strasburg in 1532.\r\n\r\nA word must be said of the later writers such as Paré (1509-90), Scultetus\r\n(1650), and Heister (1739). The works of these are profusely illustrated\r\nwith instruments, some of which can plainly be seen to tally exactly with\r\nthe descriptions of the classical authors. In other cases, although the\r\nnames given to the instruments are those of classical times, it is, to say\r\nthe least, doubtful whether they are of the same form as the ancient\r\ninstruments whose names they bear. That was an age of great activity in\r\nthe manufacture of new forms of surgical instruments, and we must accept\r\nwith caution illustrations professing to indicate ancient forms of\r\ninstruments. At the same time it is very interesting to note the large\r\nnumber of primitive arrangements which remained in use till nearly 1800.\r\nThe enema syringe figured by Heister is exactly the same as we find\r\ndescribed in the Hippocratic works--the bladder of an animal affixed to a\r\ntube--and many practitioners alive at the present day have seen the same\r\nsimple arrangement in actual use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMATERIAL, EXECUTION, AND ORNAMENTATION\r\n\r\n\r\n_Steel and Iron._\r\n\r\nThe surgical instruments we meet with are, as a rule, of bronze. Not that\r\nthe Greeks and Romans did not make many of their instruments of iron and\r\nsteel, but the iron has mainly perished while more of the bronze has\r\npersisted. Long before the date of the earliest medical writings, Greece\r\nhad passed into the iron age. The Homeric poems picture a civilization in\r\nthe state of transition from a bronze to an iron period, and weapons such\r\nas sword, axe, and spear, are frequently described as made of iron. In the\r\n_Iliad_ we even read of implements of agriculture made of iron, but it is\r\n'hard to work' (πολύκμητος, _Iliad_ vi. 48, _Od._ xxi. 10). However, by\r\nthe time that Hippocrates wrote, it was in common use, and, if we had only\r\nthe evidence of the Hippocratic writings to go by, we could see that it\r\nwas in common use in the time of Hippocrates. Certain instruments, such as\r\nthe cautery, are always spoken of as made of iron, in fact, the term for\r\ncautery is, as a rule, 'the iron,' and σίδηρος ὁ ὀξύς is a general term\r\nfor 'the knife'. The smelting of iron is even used as a simile by\r\nHippocrates:\r\n\r\n    'In the same way iron comes from stones and earth burnt together. In\r\n    the first exposure to the fire stones and earth mix together with\r\n    scoria, but at the second and third burning the scoria separate\r\n    themselves from the iron, and this phenomenon meets the eye, that the\r\n    iron remains in the fire fallen apart from the scoria, and becomes\r\n    solid and compact' (ii. 371).\r\n\r\nAgain, he uses as a simile a speculative theory as to the way in which\r\nheating iron softens it and dipping it in water hardens it. He believes\r\nthat this comes about by the fire depriving the iron of its nourishing\r\nsubstance, while the addition of water restores it.\r\n\r\n    Σιδήρου ὄργανα τέχνης· τὸν σίδηρον περιτήκουσι, πνεύματι ἀναγκάζοντες\r\n    τὸ πῦρ, τὴν ὑπάρχουσαν τροφὴν ἀφαιρέοντες, ἀραιὸν δὲ ποιήσαντες,\r\n    παίουσι καὶ συνελαύνουσιν. ὕδατος δὲ ἄλλου τροφῇ ἰσχυρὸν γίνεται (ii.\r\n    641).\r\n\r\n    'The instruments of ironworking soften iron by driving the fire with\r\n    wind and taking away the supporting substance, and when they have\r\n    rarefied it they strike and beat it. By the nourishment of water it is\r\n    again strengthened.'\r\n\r\nThis is the earliest reference to tempering steel by the Greeks with which\r\nI am acquainted. It is a curious commentary on the relative destruction of\r\niron instruments compared with those of bronze, that cauteries, which are\r\nalways described as made of iron and which must have existed in enormous\r\nnumbers, are among the rarest surgical instruments found. We have a few\r\ncauteries of iron, however, and some knives and knife-blades and other\r\ninstruments remain. Pots for ointments of certain kinds were made of iron,\r\nand we have actually two of these which had been the property of a Roman\r\noculist whose full name is known. I have entered into this discussion\r\nbecause there seems to be a general tendency to underestimate the extent\r\nto which iron was employed by the Greeks and Romans. The quantity of\r\nscoria left by the primitive founders should alone be sufficient to teach\r\nus to how great an extent iron was in use. Wherever there was good iron in\r\nany of the Roman provinces, veritable mountains of scoria are found. The\r\nheaps of scoria left in the Forest of Dean by the Roman founders contained\r\nsuch a large percentage of iron still remaining that they were smelted\r\nover again in later times, and to do this occupied over twenty furnaces\r\nfor a couple of centuries. Tolouse calculated that similar heaps in Gaul\r\ncontained over 120,000 tons of scoria. If, however, we tend to\r\nunderestimate the extent to which iron was in use among the Greeks and\r\nRomans, still more, I believe, do we tend to underrate the quantity and\r\nthe quality of the steel available in those times. This comes about from\r\nthe fact that in our day we require such enormous quantities of iron and\r\nsteel that we have to employ iron ores of a very low quality. The greater\r\npart of the so-called steel of which battleships are made is got from a\r\nferruginous mud with only 30 per cent. of iron, less than there was left\r\nin the scoria after the Roman founder had done with it. To the impurities\r\nalready existing in this we add others, because the coal we use contains\r\nsulphur. It is getting rid of these impurities that makes the production\r\nof steel such a roundabout process with us. We forget that, with primitive\r\nmethods but fine ores and a fuel devoid of sulphur, the production of\r\nsteel of fine quality is as easy a process as the manufacture of iron, in\r\nfact the only difference between the method of procuring iron and steel\r\nunder these circumstances is the length of time the process is allowed to\r\ngo on. The ancient founders used the finest ores, often containing 75 per\r\ncent. of iron, and, working with charcoal fuel, which was nearly pure\r\ncarbon, they could produce steel as easily as iron. The difference between\r\nsteel and iron is that steel contains carbon, and, by allowing the ore to\r\nremain longer in contact with the charcoal, steel is formed, so that a\r\nfounder setting out to make iron with a pure ore and a pure fuel like\r\ncharcoal, may, if he is not careful, turn out steel of fine quality. This\r\nprimitive method of making steel is still in vogue in India, Burma,\r\nBorneo, China, &c., and very fine qualities of steel are produced. The\r\nmajority of the tools found in the earliest Greek colonies on the\r\nNile--Naukratis and Daphnae--are of steel or iron, although those of the\r\nEgyptians among whom they were living (circa 600 B. C.) were of bronze.\r\nThe classical medical writings themselves are sufficient evidence of the\r\nquality of the steel available in those times. Galen (ii. 683) says that\r\nthe best quality of steel (which came from Norica) yielded a knife which\r\nneither blunted easily nor bent or chipped.\r\n\r\n    Ἐκ σιδήρου δὲ ἔστω τοῦτο τοῦ καλλίστου, οἷόν περ τὸ Νωρικόν ἐστιν, ἵνα\r\n    μήτ' ἀμβλύνηται ταχέως, μήτ' ἀνακάμπτηται ἢ θραύηται.\r\n\r\nThis shows that the Greek surgeon appreciated good steel, and what I have\r\nsaid will show that there was plenty of it to be had. Yet modern writers\r\nalmost invariably speak of or describe even the cutting instruments of the\r\nancients as made of iron. Greek and Latin have each only one word to\r\nindicate both steel and iron, but that is because, as I have shown, they\r\nprepared both in the same way. The ancient Hindoo Vedas say that cutting\r\ninstruments were to be made of steel, well polished and sufficiently keen\r\nto divide a hair. For sharpening, a stone was to be used, and they were to\r\nbe kept clean and wrapt in flannel and laid by in a box of sandalwood.\r\nAlbucasis in mentioning steel always specifies Indian steel. Many of the\r\nRoman shears of steel retain their spring perfectly. As an illustration of\r\nthe keenness of edge which can be put by simple methods upon steel of\r\nprimitive manufacture, take the following account of the operations of an\r\nAfrican barber of the Hausa tribe, as reported in an account by Professor\r\nR. W. Reid, Aberdeen, of a Hausa barber-doctor's outfit presented to the\r\nAnthropological Museum of the University by Sir William MacGregor,\r\nGovernor of Lagos. The description of the outfit is quoted from Sir\r\nWilliam MacGregor, who says:\r\n\r\n    'The knife, made by an African bush blacksmith, he uses for shaving.\r\n    He employs no soap to soften the skin or roughen the hair, only a\r\n    little water. He sharpens his razor on a black leather strap, turning\r\n    the knife on the back so deftly that the eye cannot follow the\r\n    movement; the few last touches he gives to it by turning it with\r\n    splendid dexterity on the front of the left arm, where the skin is\r\n    worn and bare by this manipulation. He shaves the whole face, except\r\n    the nose. He leaves a fine line of eyebrow. The hair is cut short. The\r\n    outline of the hairy part of the scalp in front is very clearly\r\n    demarcated by shaving back about a half to an inch and a half. Then he\r\n    turns the front edge by a marvellous stroke. He holds the knife\r\n    horizontally, and, with a downward stroke cuts off all the projecting\r\n    ends of the hair round the forehead. No European barber could do it\r\n    without burying his razor in the skin. He never draws blood' (_Proc.\r\n    Anat. and Anthrop. Soc. Univ. Abdn._, 1900-2).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bronze._\r\n\r\nAlthough, as I have shown, iron and steel were largely used in the\r\nmanufacture of instruments, fortunately for us bronze was the metal\r\nusually selected, for thus many instruments have withstood the lapse of\r\ntime which would otherwise have been oxidized out of existence. Copper is\r\nmuch more easily got from ore than iron, and consequently it was the first\r\nto be used by man, and very early the advantage of combining it with tin\r\nto form bronze was found out. Bronze was used by the Egyptians 6,000 years\r\nago, and the Phoenicians, who got it from them, passed it on to the whole\r\nof Europe. The quantity of tin in the bronze is very constantly about\r\n7-1/2 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the instruments which have been preserved to us are of\r\nbronze. Hippocrates (i. 58) says:\r\n\r\n    Χαλκώματι δὲ πλὴν τῶν ὀργάνων, μηδενὶ χρήσθω. καλλωπισμὸς γάρ τις\r\n    εἶναί μοι δοκεῖ φορτικὸς σκεύεσι τοιουτέοισι χρῆσθαι.\r\n\r\n    'Use bronze only for instruments, for it seems laboured ornamentation\r\n    to use vessels of it.'\r\n\r\nWe have, however, a good many specimens of vessels which prove that\r\nphysicians did not adhere to this advice. We know too that certain\r\nmedicaments were intentionally stored in copper vessels. Scribonius says:\r\n\r\n    Deinde in patella aeris Cyprii super carbones posita infervescit,\r\n    donec mellis habeat non nimium liquidi spissitudinem atque ita\r\n    reponitur puxide aeris Cyprii (_Compositiones_, xxxvii).\r\n\r\nPure copper was occasionally used for instruments, and of these we have a\r\nfew remaining, and vessels and instruments of it are frequently mentioned:\r\n'Oportet autem moveri aquam ipsam rudicula vel spathomela aeris rubri'\r\n(Marcellus, _De Medicamentis_, xiv. 44). Coins were frequently made of\r\nbrass (ὀρείχαλκος, _orichalcum_, _aurichalcum_), a mixture of copper, tin,\r\nand zinc, and in Pompeii there have been found two scalpel handles of\r\nbrass composed of 25 per cent. of zinc and 75 per cent. of copper. The\r\ncopper was got mainly from Cyprus and Spain. A small amount, however,\r\ncame from Africa and Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tin._\r\n\r\nTin came mainly from Britain. We have no instruments of tin preserved to\r\nus, but they are frequently referred to. Hippocrates mentions, over and\r\nover again, uterine sounds of tin, and he also speaks of sounds and eyed\r\nprobes for rectal work, which were made of tin so that they might be\r\nflexible. Vessels of tin for storing medicaments in are spoken of by\r\nLargus: 'Reponitur medicamentum fictili vel stagneo vase' (cclxviii). In\r\nthe Museum at Chesters (Chollerford) there is a tin weight for medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lead._\r\n\r\nLeaden sounds and tubes for intra-uterine medication are frequently\r\nmentioned in the Hippocratic writings, and Celsus and Paul refer to leaden\r\ntubes for insertion in the rectum and vagina to prevent cicatricial\r\ncontractions and adhesions after operations on these parts. The therapists\r\nalso mention medicament jars of lead. There is one in the Capitoline\r\nMuseum from the temple of Aesculapius in the forum.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gold._\r\n\r\nThere is in the Museum at Stockholm a forceps of gold, but it is more than\r\nprobable that this is a toilet article. I have a spatula-probe which had\r\nbeen overlaid with gold, and I have met with several others similarly\r\ntreated. Theodorus Priscianus recommends a cautery of gold for stopping\r\nhaemorrhage from the throat (_Logicus_, xxii). Avenzoar speaks of a golden\r\nprobe for applying salve to the eye and for separating adhesion of the eye\r\nto the lid. Avicenna lets out the pustules of small-pox with a golden\r\nprobe. Albucasis recommends burning the roots of hairs in trichiasis with\r\na probe of gold. Mesue recommends a heated scalpel of gold to excise the\r\ntonsil. Hippocrates binds the teeth together in fracture of the jaw with a\r\ngold wire (iii. 174): cf. Paul, VI. xcii. In one of his dialogues Lucian\r\nsatirizes a medical man who sought to conceal his ignorance by a display\r\nof a fine library, bleeding-cups of silver, and scalpel handles inlaid\r\nwith gold--the devices of quacks, Lucian says, who did not know how to use\r\nthe instruments when necessity arose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Silver._\r\n\r\nThere is a forceps of silver in the Athens Museum, and another in the\r\nMuseum at Kiel. Both are, however, possibly toilet articles. Paul condemns\r\nbleeding-cups of silver, as he says they burn, so it is evident that\r\nLucian had grounds for his statement. In the Musée de Cinquantenaire,\r\nBrussels, there is in the section of ancient surgery a bronze instrument\r\ncase from Pompeii which contained a silver spoon and probe combined, a\r\nplain probe, and a grooved director, all in silver. I have frequently met\r\nwith ligulae of silver and also of copper overlaid with silver, and styli,\r\nwhich we shall see were used as implements of minor surgery, were\r\nfrequently made of silver. Medicament boxes of silver are mentioned by\r\nMarcellus. Hippocrates describes a uterine syringe with a tube of silver.\r\nAlbucasis mentions silver catheters.\r\n\r\nA mixture of gold and silver, which was called electrum, was much used for\r\ncoinage, and I have met with one or two ligulae of this metal. It was\r\nfound mixed naturally in the mountain districts of Tmolus and Sipylus in\r\nLydia, and it was also artificially produced by alloying the two metals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Horn._\r\n\r\nHippocrates (iii. 331) speaks of a pessary of horn inserted into the\r\nrectum. It would seem that the tube of various syringes was often made of\r\nhorn, as both Greek and Latin writers speak of the 'horn' of the syringe.\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus (_Compositiones_, vii) says:\r\n\r\n    Per nares ergo purgatur caput his rebus infusis per cornu, quod\r\n    rhinenchytes vocatur (cf. Galen, xi. 125).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wood._\r\n\r\nGalen speaks of sounds or directors of wood, and ointment spatulae of wood\r\nare very frequently mentioned in the therapeutic works, as are also boxes\r\nfor storing ointments in.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bone and Ivory._\r\n\r\nNumbers of bone ligulae were found in a Roman hospital lately excavated at\r\nBaden.\r\n\r\nIn the Naples Museum there are two ointment spoons with carved bone\r\nhandles. Needles such as Hippocrates and Celsus speak of for stitching\r\nbandages to fix them were very frequently made of bone and ivory. Knife\r\nhandles of bone and ivory are common. A carved ivory medicament box with\r\nsliding lid will be fully described later. Scribonius Largus describes\r\nknives of bone and ivory for preparing plants for pharmaceutical purposes\r\n(_Compositiones_, lxxxiii). An ivory pestle was found with a surgeon's\r\noutfit in Cologne.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stone._\r\n\r\nMedicaments were prepared on stone slabs, and the great majority of\r\noculists' seals were of stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Execution and Ornamentation._\r\n\r\nThe execution of the instruments is, as a rule, all that could be desired,\r\nand the weight and thickness are no more than is consistent with the\r\nrequisite strength.\r\n\r\nHippocrates points out the necessity for this:--\r\n\r\n    Τάδ' ὄργανα πάντα εὐήρη πρὸς τὴν χρείαν ὑπάρχειν δεῖ τῷδε μεγέθει, καὶ\r\n    βάρει, καὶ λεπτότητι.\r\n\r\n    'All instruments ought to be well suited for the purpose in hand as\r\n    regards their size, weight, and delicacy' (i. 58).\r\n\r\nThe ornamentation is simple and effective. In the round instruments like\r\nthe probes it consists usually of raised circular ornamentation, with or\r\nwithout a secondary ornamentation on the raised ringing. In others there\r\nare longitudinal or spiral grooves running along the instrument. In some\r\ncases the bronze is decorated with an inlay of silver damascening. This is\r\nrare in the instruments from Pompeii, though there are two probes with a\r\nspiral inlay in the Naples Museum. The majority of the instruments treated\r\nin this way have been found in the western provinces, and they are of\r\nlater date than the Pompeian. The handles of some scalpels belonging to\r\nthe third century are beautifully inlaid with silver. Lucian, as I have\r\nmentioned, speaks of scalpels inlaid with gold. In the Mainz Museum there\r\nis a medicament box on the lid of which is inlaid a snake coiled round a\r\ntree, the tree and the snake's body being outlined in copper and the\r\nsnake's head in silver. So far no damascened instruments are reported from\r\nGreece. Damascening began in Europe apparently in the first century, and\r\nreached its height in the time of the Merovingian kings.\r\n\r\nExamples of plated instruments are not uncommon. I have a spatula\r\ndissector thinly plated with gold, and I have met with several ligulae\r\nplated with silver. One of these was so thickly plated that on cutting\r\ninto it the silver, which was deeply oxidized on the outside and was,\r\ntherefore, quite black, showed also a layer of metallic silver still\r\nbright on section.\r\n\r\nAll the surgical instruments found in the provinces have an _air de\r\nfamille_ which would lead one to suppose that they had been manufactured\r\nin Italy, but this is not certain. The ointment slabs, however, are rarely\r\nof the stone of the country in which they are found. On the other hand,\r\nthe orthographical faults on the oculists' seals would indicate that they\r\nwere cut in the provinces. Wherever possible two instruments are combined\r\ninto one. Thus very few of the probes are simple instruments but carry a\r\nspatula, a scoop or spoon, an eye, or a hook, at the opposite end.\r\nVulsella are more difficult to combine with other instruments, but here\r\nagain we meet with combinations such as vulsella at one end and scoop,\r\nraspatory, or probe, at the other. The typical scalpel handle carries at\r\nthe end opposite the blade a spatula for blunt dissection. We have needles\r\nat one end and probes, scalpel blades, &c., at the other end of a handle.\r\nThis combination of two instruments in one is still in use in our day. We\r\nmust notice the fact that the majority of instruments we know were all of\r\nmetal, not folding into hollow handles of wood, bone, &c., as the\r\ninstruments of a decade ago did, so that they were easily cleaned. In fact\r\nwe shall see that where the scalpel and handle were not forged in one\r\npiece they were united by something very like our aseptic joint.\r\nHippocrates insists on the importance of keeping everything in the surgery\r\nabsolutely clean.\r\n\r\nA few instruments bear the image of deities connected with medicine, or\r\nattributes of these. The figures of Aesculapius and his daughter Hygeia\r\nare found on medicament boxes, the former with the serpent entwining his\r\nstaff, the latter feeding a serpent from a bowl. The serpent is sometimes\r\nfound on a probe. A uterine dilator from Pompeii also carries it. A probe\r\nsurmounted by a double serpent (caduceus form) was found in the Roman\r\nHospital at Baden. Two scalpels in the Naples Museum carry on their ends\r\nthe head of Minerva Medica. The quadrivalve speculum in the Naples Museum\r\nhas each end of the crossbar tipped with a fine image of a ram's head.\r\nThere is also a medicine shovel with the same symbol. Illustrations of\r\nthese instruments will be found later.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preservation._\r\n\r\nSome of the instruments of silver retain their brightness as when they\r\nwere made, but under certain circumstances a considerable amount of\r\noxidation takes place, and then they have a thick black coating. Very few\r\nbronze articles are found to have retained their colour. In volcanic\r\ndistricts the various sulphur compounds formed give rise to a beautiful\r\npatina of varying shades of green and blue, sometimes so evenly\r\ndistributed as to resemble enamel. This, when fine, much enhances the\r\nvalue of the article.\r\n\r\nArticles of iron are sometimes but little destroyed. It is surprising in\r\nhow good condition the iron or steel may be. The bow of a shears is\r\nsometimes quite springy. In some cases a steel or iron article is often\r\nrepresented by a mass of oxide bearing some resemblance to the original.\r\nIn others only a shapeless mass of oxide remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Finds of Instruments._\r\n\r\nFinds of ancient surgical instruments, though not by any means common, are\r\nstill sufficiently numerous for specimens to have found their way into\r\nmost of our larger museums; and private collectors have here and there\r\nacquired considerable numbers. The most prolific source has been the\r\nexcavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii, which have now been systematically\r\npursued for nearly three hundred years, while the objects found have been\r\ndeposited in the National Museum at Naples. In 1818 a physician's house\r\nwith a large number of surgical instruments was discovered in the Strada\r\ndel Consulate of Pompeii, and two chemists' shops have also been found\r\nwith instruments in them. Besides these there is a large number of\r\ninstruments from other finds in the two buried cities.\r\n\r\nThe custom of burying personal effects along with the ashes of a deceased\r\nperson, which prevailed among the Romans from the second to the fourth\r\ncentury, has preserved to us a number of interesting finds. In 1880 M.\r\nTolouse, a civil engineer in Paris, in executing some alterations in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Avenue Choisy, discovered the grave of a surgeon,\r\ncontaining a bronze pot full of surgical instruments. Among these were\r\nnumerous forceps and vulsella, ointment tubes, bleeding cup, scalpel\r\nhandles for blades of steel, probes, and spatulae. Sixty-six coins of the\r\nreigns of Tetricus I and II showed that the grave belonged to the end of\r\nthe second or the beginning of the third century. The find was reported by\r\nM. Tolouse in a volume entitled _Mes fouilles dans le sol du vieux Paris_\r\n(Paris, 1888). In 1892 the find was fully described by Professor Deneffe\r\nof Ghent, in the _Revue Archéologique_, under the title 'Notice\r\ndescriptive sur une trousse de médecin au III{me} siècle', and reprinted,\r\nwith photogravures, in 1893 in a monograph _Étude sur la trousse d'un\r\nchirurgien Gallo-Romain du III{me} siècle_ (Antwerp, 1893). It is\r\nconvenient to refer to this find as that of the 'Surgeon of Paris'.\r\nAnother grave containing surgical instruments was found at Wancennes in\r\nthe canton of Beauraing, Namur, in a cemetery of the first or second\r\ncentury. The instruments are now in the Archaeological Museum at Namur\r\n(Deneffe, op. cit., p. 35).\r\n\r\nIn 1854 there were discovered at Rheims the remnants of a wooden chest\r\ncontaining two little iron jars for ointments, several scalpel handles, a\r\nsmall drill, eight handles for needles, five hooks (two blunt and three\r\nsharp), two balances, various probes and spatulae, seven forceps,\r\nmedicament box, a mortar, and a seal showing that the instruments had\r\nbelonged to an oculist named Gaius Firmius Severus. The instruments are\r\nall of the most beautiful pattern and finish, several being finely inlaid\r\nwith silver. Some coins of the reigns of Antoninus Pius and Marcus\r\nAurelius showed that the interment belonged to the end of the third\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThese instruments, &c., are now in the Museum of St-Germain-en-Laye. The\r\nmajority of these will be found described and figured later.\r\n\r\nFind of Sextus Polleius Sollemnis, oculist of Fonviel,\r\nSaint-Privat-d'Allier. In levelling a heap of earth which had fallen from\r\na cliff above as the result of a landslide, there were found at Fonviel in\r\n1864 a number of bronze surgical instruments. The place where they were\r\nfound is at the intersection of two old Roman roads, and the instruments\r\nhad been buried in the grave of a Roman surgeon high up above the valley\r\non the edge of a cliff. Eighteen coins of the reigns of Julia Augusta,\r\nTrajan, Hadrian, Commodus, Gordian, Philip, Valerian, and Gallus, showed\r\nthat the interment had been made at the end of the third century. The\r\ninstruments found included three scalpel handles, fragments of two\r\nforceps, and an oculist's seal in stone showing that the grave was that of\r\nSextus Polleius Sollemnis. Many more instruments had probably been buried\r\noriginally. Those enumerated are now in the Museum of Le Puy-en-Velay. An\r\naccount of this find, with illustrations, is to be found in the _Annales\r\nde la Société d'Agriculture, Sciences, Arts et Commerce du Puy_ (tome\r\nxxvi. 1864-5). It is also described, along with the find of Gaius Firmius\r\nSeverus, in a monograph by Deneffe, under the title of _Les Oculistes\r\nGallo-Romaine au III{me} siècle_ (Antwerp, 1896).\r\n\r\nOne of the most prolific finds of late years has been the discovery of a\r\nRoman military hospital at Baden, the ancient Roman station of Aquae, or\r\nVicus Aquensis. From time to time isolated discoveries of instruments had\r\nbeen made, including a catheter, a scalpel, and several varieties of\r\nprobes, and in March, 1893, MM. Kellersberger and Meyer proceeded to\r\nexcavate systematically the remains of some Roman buildings on their\r\nproperty. A large chamber 10·35 metres by 12·5, with walls 60 cm. thick,\r\nwas discovered, and later others were discovered varying from 3 to 27\r\nmetres in length. There were in all fourteen rooms. Along the side of the\r\nbuilding on which a Roman road ran, there were the remains of an imposing\r\nfaçade, running the whole length of the building. It had consisted of a\r\nportico with colonnades, the foundations of which were found at regular\r\nintervals. It is possible that some of the larger rooms had been\r\nsubdivided into others by thin walls or partitions, for fragments of\r\npartitions of plaster with wood lathing were found.\r\n\r\nA large number of objects--tiles, lamps, vases, pots, knives, spearheads,\r\nnails, glass, fibulae, beads, weavers' weights, three amphorae a metre\r\nhigh--were found near the surface. Then, at a depth of two metres,\r\nsurgical instruments began to be found. These included probes to the\r\nnumber of 120, unguent spoons in bone and bronze, a fragment of a catheter\r\n13 cm. long, bronze boxes for powder, needles, earscoops, unguentaria,\r\nspatulae, a fragment of an étui for instruments, and cauteries. Many coins\r\nof the reigns of Claudius, Nero, Domitian, Vespasian, and Hadrian were\r\nfound, showing that the hospital had been in use between 100 and 200 A. D.\r\nThe objects mentioned are still the private property of MM. Kellersberger\r\nand Meyer. In 1905, by the kindness of these gentlemen, I was allowed to\r\nmake a complete examination of the collection.\r\n\r\nA case containing a surgeon's outfit was found in the Luxemburgerstrasse,\r\nCologne. It contained a phlebotome, a chisel, and some fragments of other\r\ninstruments of steel, two forceps and two sharp hooks in bronze, and a\r\nsmall ivory pestle-like instrument. These are now in the Cologne Museum.\r\nThis is a most interesting and important little find. The phlebotome is by\r\nfar the best preserved and best authenticated example which we possess of\r\nthis instrument. Probably the same may be said of the chisel as a purely\r\nsurgical instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nKNIVES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe surgical knife had, as a rule, the blade of steel and the handle of\r\nbronze. We find specimens all of steel or all of bronze but these are\r\nexceptional forms; and hence it happens that many more handles than blades\r\nhave been preserved to us, as usually the blade has oxidized away leaving\r\nno trace of its shape. It will be well, therefore, to commence with the\r\nstudy of the handle.\r\n\r\nThe scalpel handle consists, as a rule, of a bar of bronze, which may be\r\nround, square, hexagonal, or trapezoidal in section. At one end there is a\r\nslot to receive the steel blade, varying in depth from 2 cm. in the\r\nlarger, to 1 cm. in the smaller, instruments. The other end of the handle\r\ncarried a leaf-shaped spatula to act as a blunt dissector. A groove is\r\noften formed near the end of the handle, or the end is raised into a\r\ncylindrical roll on each side, and this roll again is sometimes perforated\r\nwith a hole.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that the blades were fixed in the handle by a\r\nbinding thread or wire, and that the rolls and perforations were to give\r\nsecurity to the mounting used. This detachable arrangement would allow of\r\nremoval for cleaning, and also permit one handle to be used with several\r\nvarieties of blade. A consideration of the slots in a large number of\r\nhandles leads me to believe, however, that this was, to say the least, not\r\nthe usual arrangement. The proportion of the depth of the slot to the size\r\nof the blade to be supported is in most cases not large enough to allow of\r\na temporary mounting to fix the blade firmly, and I believe that most\r\nblades were either luted or brazed in permanently. These processes were\r\nwell known to the ancients, and in fact we have them in evidence in other\r\nsurgical instruments. Those bleeding-cups from Pompeii which carry rings\r\non their summits have the top part brazed or soldered on. Galen (ii. 717)\r\nalludes to the blowpipe which goldsmiths used, and Paulus Aegineta has a\r\nchapter on the fluxes used by these artists. We frequently meet with\r\nornaments fixed on boxes by means of solder.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the slot in some handles expands at its termination\r\ninto a wider portion which would carry a cylindrical expansion on the\r\nother end of the blade. This form of blade could not be pulled outwards,\r\nand might well be fixed with a temporary mounting.\r\n\r\nDifferent varieties of handles are shown in Plates I-III. Some are\r\nbeautifully damascened with silver. These are mostly of the third century,\r\nbut Sambon reports some damascened handles of the first century. A rare\r\nform is seen in a specimen in the Museum at Le Puy-en-Velay, where the\r\nhandle is round and decorated with a spiral band of silver inlaid round\r\nit. It is from the find of the oculist Sollemnis (Pl. II, fig. 6).\r\n\r\nA few variations from the characteristic combination of handle and\r\nspatula-shaped dissector occur. Thus we have a handle ending in a conical\r\npoint (Pl. II, fig. 7), which Deneffe regards as a drill for perforating\r\nthe nasal septum in cases of fistula lachrymalis. Archigenes describes\r\nthis operation, and the handle was found in the grave of the oculist\r\nSeverus. Along with it were found two other handles, which, instead of a\r\nspatula, had carried a steel needle (Pl. II, figs. 1, 2). The needles have\r\ndisappeared of course, but there are the holes to receive them. In other\r\ncases the handle was round, and either quite plain or ornamented with\r\nraised rings. Some of these ended in a small round knob (Pl. V, fig. 2).\r\nOthers carry the head of Minerva Medica like the spoon in Pl. XX, fig. 5.\r\nThere are three of these handles in the Naples Museum. Rufus of Ephesus\r\ndescribes a lithotomy knife which had a scoop at the end of the handle\r\nwith which to extract the stone. An example of this is seen in the box of\r\nscalpels from Athens (Pl. IV).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Blade._\r\n\r\nFor the study of the different varieties of blade we have at our disposal\r\nfirst of all the specimens that have actually survived. Of these the\r\nlargest number are to be seen in the Naples Museum, but a considerable\r\nnumber are to be found scattered over various museums. An _ex voto_ tablet\r\nfound on the site of the temple of Aesculapius on the Acropolis at Athens\r\nshows a box of scalpels, among which are some interesting forms (Pl. IV).\r\nThe scalpels, it will be noted, are arranged head and tail alternately. A\r\nfew varieties are actually described in detail in the classical authors,\r\nand, by piecing together other references to particular instruments and\r\ndrawing inferences from the various uses to which we find them put, we are\r\nable to describe a surprisingly large number of forms. The\r\nsixteenth-century writers, such as Paré, and seventeenth-century writers,\r\nsuch as Scultetus, illustrate with great confidence many of the cutting\r\ninstruments mentioned by ancient writers, but it is easy to show that in\r\nseveral instances they are wrong, and, therefore, I have drawn on them as\r\nlittle as possible.\r\n\r\nAs a basis of classification we may select the following points about the\r\nblade. The form may be straight or curved. There may be only one cutting\r\nedge or there may be two, and the point may be sharp or blunt. We shall\r\nexamine combinations of these in the following order:\r\n\r\n  I. Blade straight--\r\n      (A) Cutting on one side only (_a_) sharp-pointed,\r\n          (_b_) blunt-pointed.\r\n      (B) Cutting on two edges (_a_) sharp-pointed, (_b_) blunt-pointed.\r\n  II. Blade curved--\r\n      (A) Cutting on one edge (_a_) sharp-pointed, (_b_) blunt-pointed.\r\n      (B) Cutting on two edges, sharp-pointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I. A (_a_) _Straight blade cutting on one edge, sharp-pointed._\r\n\r\n  1. Ordinary scalpel.\r\n  2. Scalpel with tip turned back.\r\n  3. Bellied scalpel.\r\n  4. Scolopomachaerion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ordinary Scalpel._\r\n\r\nThe ordinary scalpel had apparently a straight, sharp-pointed blade. The\r\nword which Galen, Aetius, and Paulus Aegineta use to denote scalpel is\r\nσμίλη. Latin authors use _scalpellus_, the diminutive of _scalper_. From\r\nthe etymology of these terms we can learn nothing as to the shape of the\r\nblade; they are merely general terms denoting a cutting blade of any\r\nkind--chisel, graving tool, knife, &c. The word Hippocrates uses, μάχαιρα\r\nor μαχαίριον, has a more definite meaning. It is from μάχαιρα, the old\r\nLacedaemonian sword, a broad blade cutting on one edge, sharp-pointed, and\r\nstraight or with the tip turned slightly backwards. Thus, even in\r\nHippocratic times the scalpel was apparently much of the same shape as it\r\nis now. Good examples of the ordinary scalpel may be seen in Pl. V, figs.\r\n1 and 2 from the British Museum. They are all of steel. A variety with the\r\npoint turned back at the tip is seen in one of the scalpels in the scalpel\r\nbox from the Acropolis (Pl. IV).\r\n\r\nA more bellied form is seen in Pl. V, fig. 5, which is from the Naples\r\nMuseum, and is all of bronze, handle and blade. At the Scientific Congress\r\nheld at Naples in 1845 Vulpes showed this specimen, and described it as\r\nthe lithotomy knife invented by Meges and mentioned by Celsus (VII. xxvi).\r\n\r\nLater I shall discuss in detail the instrument of Meges, but I believe the\r\ninstrument shown by Vulpes is only an ordinary scalpel with a somewhat\r\nbellied shape.\r\n\r\nHippocrates refers to a bellied scalpel in a well-known passage on empyema\r\n(ii. 258):\r\n\r\n    Ὅκως σοι ἡ ἔξοδος τοῦ πύους εὐρὺς ᾖ τάμνειν δεῖ μεταξὺ τῶν πλευρῶν\r\n    στηθοειδεῖ μαχαιρίδι τὸ πρῶτον δέρμα.\r\n\r\n    'Incise the outer integument between the ribs with a bellied scalpel.'\r\n\r\nΣτηθοειδής means rounded like the breast of a woman. Galen translates it\r\nin his lexicon τῷ σμιλίῳ ἰατρικῷ γαστρωδεῖ, 'the bellied surgical knife.'\r\nIt is quite a serviceable instrument for several kinds of work, and it\r\nseems to have been a common form. Three out of the six scalpels depicted\r\nin the votive tablet from the Acropolis are of this form, and there are\r\nnow in the Naples Museum four others of the same shape as the one\r\ndescribed by Vulpes. These have blades of steel and handles of bronze. The\r\nfigures of three of these (Pl. V, figs. 3-6), show the gradual evolution\r\nfrom a common scalpel into the bellied form. I have seen a scalpel with a\r\nblade similar to Pl. V, fig. 3 in use in Scotland for castrating piglings\r\nand calves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scarificator for wet cupping._\r\n\r\nPaul (VI. xli) says that some have conceived for the purpose of scarifying\r\nbefore wet cupping an instrument compounded of three blades joined\r\ntogether in such a way that at one stroke three scarifications are made:\r\n\r\n    Τινὲς οὖν ἐπενόησαν ὄργανον πρὸς τοῦτο, τρία σμιλία ἴσα ζεύξαντες\r\n    ὁμοῦ, ὅπως τῇ μιᾷ ἐπιβολῇ τρεῖς γίνοιντο διαιρέσεις.\r\n\r\nPaul says he prefers a single scalpel.\r\n\r\nWhat the precise shape of scalpel used was we cannot say, but it would\r\nmost likely be one of the bellied forms. Hippocrates, in his treatise _De\r\nMedico_, says that the lancets used in wet cupping should be rounded and\r\nnot too narrow at the tip (καμπύλοις ἐξ ἄκρου μὴ λίην στενοῖς). Even if\r\nκαμπύλος meant curved and not bellied it would not be certain that it was\r\nmeant to cut on the convex side of the blade. The words of Hippocrates\r\nimply at any rate a blade with a rounded, not sharp point (i. 62).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Straight sharp-pointed bistoury._\r\n\r\nGreek, σκολοπομαχαίριον, σκολόπιον; Latin, _scalpellus_.\r\n\r\nThe etymology of the term σκολοπομαχαίριον as applied to a cutting\r\ninstrument sufficiently indicates its shape. It takes its name from its\r\nsimilarity to the beak of a snipe, which is long and slender[1]. We find\r\nit used by Galen (xi. 1011) for dissecting out warts, excising caruncles\r\nfrom the inner canthus, puncturing the foetal cranium in obstructed\r\nlabour, &c.\r\n\r\n    [1] So says Briau (_Paul D'Egine_, p. 97), but it seems more likely to\r\n    be derived from σκόλοψ 'a spike'.\r\n\r\nIn Aetius (IV. iv. 23) and Paulus Aegineta (VI. lxxiv) it is used for\r\nopening not only the foetal cranium but also the thorax and abdomen of the\r\nfoetus in transverse presentations. Paul refers to it for opening the\r\nthorax in empyema (VI. xliv) and the abdomen in ascites (VI. l). In both\r\ncases the outer integument was incised with a scalpel and the deeper layer\r\npunctured with the bistoury. In opening the abdomen for ascites, by\r\nsliding the outer skin upwards before the peritoneal cut was made, a\r\nvalvular opening was secured. Although many other interesting applications\r\nof this instrument are to be found, these instances will suffice to show\r\nthat the uses to which the instrument was put agree with the supposition\r\nthat it was of the shape indicated by the etymology of its name. A variant\r\nform of the same name is σκολόπιον which also occurs pretty often.\r\n\r\nA large variety of this instrument is mentioned by Galen as devised by him\r\nfor the dissection of the spinal cord. He says he uses a knife of the same\r\nshape as the scolopomachaerion, but larger and stouter and made of the\r\nbest Norican steel, so as to neither blunt, bend, nor break easily (ii.\r\n682).\r\n\r\n\r\n  I. A (_b_) _Straight blade cutting on one side, blunt-pointed._\r\n\r\n  (α) Novacula or razor (Greek ξυρόν, diminutive ξύριον).\r\n  (β) Blunt-pointed bistoury.\r\n  (γ) Ring knife for dismembering foetus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Razor._\r\n\r\nShaving and cutting the hair were looked upon as important means of\r\ntreatment in several diseases. Oribasius (_Med. Coll._ xxv) has a chapter\r\non this entitled περὶ κουρᾶς καὶ ξυρήσεως. 'These things,' he says, 'have\r\nbeen introduced into medicine as a means of evacuation and as remedies in\r\nchronic diseases.'\r\n\r\nCelsus makes frequent mention of shaving as a means of treatment. Of\r\nalopecia he says:\r\n\r\n    Sed nihil melius est quam novacula quotidie radere--quia, cum paulatim\r\n    summa pellicula excisa est, adaperiuntur piloram radiculae. Neque ante\r\n    oportet desistere quam frequentem pilum nasci apparuerit (VI. iv).\r\n\r\nA large scalpel of this form from the Naples Museum is shown in Pl. VI,\r\nfig. 1. The handle is of the usual shape and is made of bronze. The blade\r\nis of steel. It measures 15 cm. all over, the blade being 2 cm. broad at\r\nthe heel. The cutting border slopes backward to the back of the blade,\r\nwhich is in a straight line with the border of the handle. At the point\r\nthe blade is 1·5 cm. broad. It may be noted that this instrument had much\r\nthe same shape as the _culter_, but _culter_ is not a term applied by any\r\nLatin author to a surgical instrument, nor is _cultellus_, although the\r\nsixteenth-century translators of Aetius and Paulus Aegineta very\r\nfrequently use the latter term. Scultetus figures a scalpel of this form\r\nand sums up its uses well:\r\n\r\n    La fig. est un rasoir ou scalpel droit ne tranchant que d'un coste et\r\n    de l'autre mousse, dont les chirurgiens se servent lorsqu'il ne faut\r\n    avoir aucun égard aux parties sujettes, scavoir lorsqu'il s'agit de\r\n    faire des incisions au cuir de la teste jusqu'au crane, &c.\r\n\r\nAnother specimen also of this class, but with the blade so long in\r\nproportion to its width as to deserve the name of a blunt-pointed bistoury\r\nwas excavated in a third-century graveyard at Stree, and is now in the\r\nCharleroi Museum. It is 14 cm. long by 1 cm. broad at the heel, widening\r\ngradually towards the point where it is 2 mm. broader than at the heel.\r\nThe end of the blade is square (Pl. VI, fig. 2). An example of the\r\ndomestic _culter_ or _cultellus_ is shown in Pl. VII, fig. 4. It is from a\r\nRoman camp at Sandy in Bedfordshire.\r\n\r\nIn the curious pseudo-Hippocratic treatise (i. 463) a knife to fix on the\r\nthumb and dismember a foetus in utero is mentioned:\r\n\r\n    Ἔχειν δὲ χρὴ πρὸς τὰ τοιαῦτα καὶ ὄνυχα ἐπὶ τῷ δακτύλῳ τῷ μεγάλῳ. καὶ\r\n    διελόντα ἐξενεγκεῖν τὰς χεῖρας κτλ.\r\n\r\n    'If, however, the foetus be dead and remain, and cannot either\r\n    spontaneously or with the aid of drugs come away in the natural\r\n    manner, having liberally anointed the hand with cerate and inserted it\r\n    in the uterus endeavour to separate the shoulders from the neck with\r\n    the thumb. It is necessary to have for this a 'claw' upon the thumb\r\n    and, the amputation having been performed, to extract the arms and,\r\n    again inserting the hand, to open the abdomen and, having done so to\r\n    remove the intestines, &c.'\r\n\r\nAn instrument answering to this description is still in use by veterinary\r\nsurgeons (Pl. VII, fig. 1), but the forefinger, and not the thumb, is\r\nused. A scalpel blade is mounted on a ring and the forefinger is passed\r\nthrough the ring. Foals and calves are in this way easily dismembered in\r\nexactly the same way as is described by Hippocrates. The name of the\r\ninstrument of Hippocrates would rather indicate that its blade was curved,\r\nbut as the modern instrument has a probe point I have included it in this\r\nclass. It is called by Tertullian the 'ring knife'--'cum annulo cultrato\r\n(var. lect. anulocultro) quo intus membra caeduntur anxio arbitrio' (_De\r\nAnima_, 26).\r\n\r\n\r\n  I. B (_a_) _Straight blade cutting on two edges, sharp-pointed._\r\n\r\n  (1) Galen's 'long' dissecting knife.\r\n  (2) Phlebotome.\r\n  (3) Lithotome.\r\n  (4) Polypus knife.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Galen's knife for opening the vertebral canal._\r\n\r\nIn his description of the dissection of the spine Galen describes a large\r\nstraight two-edged knife (ii. 682):\r\n\r\n    Καθίημι τὸ πρόμηκες μαχαίριον, οὕτω γὰρ αὐτὸ καλῶ δύο πλευρὰς ὀξείας\r\n    ἔχον ἐπὶ τοῦ πέρατος εἰς μίαν κορυφὴν ἀνηκοῦσας.\r\n\r\n    'I push in the 'long scalpel', for thus I describe the one with two\r\n    cutting edges meeting in one at the tip.'\r\n\r\nWhat Galen means by πρόμηκες when applied to an instrument he has himself\r\nexplained in a note on the chapter by Hippocrates on the treatment of\r\ndislocation of the shoulder. He applies it to instruments long in\r\nproportion to their breadth (see p. 118). The knife referred to here is a\r\nlarge strong instrument, for it is intended for cutting through the\r\nlateral processes of the vertebrae.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phlebotome._\r\n\r\nGreek, φλεβοτόμον, τὸ (sc. σμιλίον), also φλεβοτόμος, ὁ (Galen). ὀξυβελές\r\n(sc. ὄργανον); Latin, _phlebotomum_ (late), _scalpellus_.\r\n\r\nAlthough venesection is one of the most frequently mentioned operations,\r\nand although the phlebotome is one of the most frequently named\r\ninstruments, we have no passage giving even the most meagre description of\r\nthis instrument. It is assumed that its appearance would be familiar to\r\nevery one, since phlebotomy was so common. Celsus tells us that every one\r\nold and young was bled.\r\n\r\n    Sanguinem, incisa vena, mitti, novum non est, sed nullum paene morbum\r\n    esse in quo non mittatur novum est (II. x).\r\n\r\nThe operation continued just as frequent all through the Roman period, and\r\nthe writings on venesection are very voluminous. Galen has three treatises\r\non the subject. The operation was performed in exactly the same way as at\r\nthe present day, and the lancet was apparently the same as that figured in\r\nmodern instrument catalogues, viz. sharp-pointed, double-edged, and\r\nstraight. A consideration of all the various operations to which the\r\nphlebotome was put bears this out. The following passage from Hippocrates\r\nshows that there were various sizes of the phlebotome:\r\n\r\n    Τοῖς γε μαχαιρίοις ὀξέσι δεῖ χρῆσθαι καὶ πλάτεσι, οὐκ ἐπὶ πάντων\r\n    ὁμοίως παραγγέλλομεν, κτλ. (i. 60).\r\n\r\n    'We do not recommend that the lancets narrow and broad should be used\r\n    indiscriminately in all cases, for there are certain parts of the\r\n    body which have a swift current of blood which it is not easy to stop.\r\n    Such are varices and certain other veins. Therefore, it is necessary\r\n    in these to make narrow openings, for otherwise it is not possible to\r\n    stop the flow. Yet it is sometimes necessary to let blood from them.\r\n    But in places not dangerous, and about which the blood is not thin, we\r\n    use the lancets broader (πλατυτέροις χρῆσθαι τοῖς μαχαιρίοις), for\r\n    thus and not otherwise will the blood flow.'\r\n\r\nThe phlebotome appears to have been a convenient instrument for all sorts\r\nof operations besides phlebotomy, especially for the opening of abscesses\r\nand the puncture of cavities containing fluid, and for fine dissecting\r\nwork. Paulus Aegineta mentions its application for the excision of fistula\r\nlachrymalis (VI. xxii), the removal of warts (VI. lxxxvii), slitting the\r\nprepuce in phimosis (VI. lv), incising the tunica vaginalis in excision of\r\nhydrocele sac (VI. lxii), opening abscesses (VI. xxvii), dissection of\r\nsebaceous cysts (VI. xiv). Galen (xiv. 787) mentions its use in dissecting\r\nopen an imperforate vagina. Celsus has no special word for phlebotome. He\r\nalways refers to it by the general term scalpellus. Theodorus Priscianus,\r\nwhose Latin takes curious forms, gives us a transliteration of the Greek\r\nterm:\r\n\r\n    Convenit interea prae omnibus etiam his flebotomum adhibere, convenit\r\n    etiam eos ventris purgatione iuvari (_Euporiston_, xxi. 66).\r\n\r\nHippocrates in the famous passage on the surgical treatment of empyema\r\n(ii. 258) says:\r\n\r\n    'Incise the skin between the ribs with a bellied scalpel, then let a\r\n    phlebotome (ὀξυβελεῖ) which has been wound round with a rag, leaving\r\n    the breadth of the thumb nail at the point, be pushed in.'\r\n\r\nὈξυβελής literally means sharp-pointed. The term occurs in the _Iliad_, e.\r\ng. applied to an arrow (iv. 126), but Galen in his Lexicon expressly\r\nstates that Hippocrates by it means the phlebotome. In his treatment of\r\nempyema Paulus Aegineta uses not the phlebotome but a sharp curved\r\nbistoury; however, in opening the abdomen for ascites it is the phlebotome\r\nhe recommends:\r\n\r\n    'We take a curved bistoury or a phlebotome and, having with the point\r\n    of the instrument dissected the skin that lies over the peritoneum, we\r\n    divide the peritoneum a little higher up than the first incision, and\r\n    insert a tube of bronze.'\r\n\r\nAll these various applications of the phlebotome are consistent with the\r\nsupposition that the phlebotome was the same as that figured in the\r\ncatalogues of the present day. Heister says:\r\n\r\n    Spectant huc primo loco ea quae Tab. 1 sub litt. A & B (Pl. VII, figs.\r\n    6, 7) exhibentur, _scalpellum_ nempe minus et maius; vulgus\r\n    _lancettas_ eadem nominant. Serviunt eadem, praesertim minora, venis\r\n    incidendis, quare phlebotoma Graecis vocantur; sed et abscessibus\r\n    aperiendis, imprimis maiora; ideoque Gallis etiam _lancettes a\r\n    l'absces_ appellari consueverunt.\r\n\r\nA bronze blade of this shape is shown in Pl. VII, fig. 3. It was found\r\nnear Rome.\r\n\r\nThe identity in shape of the abscess knife and the phlebotome holds good\r\nto-day. The best example of the phlebotome is in the Cologne Museum. It\r\nwas found in the Luxemburgerstrasse along with the other contents of a\r\nsurgeon's case. It is all of steel, with a square handle and blade of\r\nmyrtle leaf shape (Pl. VII, fig. 2). There is in the Naples Museum an\r\ninstrument which is of this shape, and Vulpes (Tav. VI, fig. 1) has\r\ndescribed it as a lancet for bleeding. The instrument, however, is formed\r\nof a blade of silver set in a handle of bronze, so that it can scarcely be\r\nregarded as a cutting instrument (see Pl. XIX, fig. 2). I look upon it as\r\nan unguent spatula. There is, however, an instrument of bronze of\r\nphlebotome shape in the Naples Museum. It was found in the house of the\r\nphysician in the Strada del Consulare of Pompeii, and it was described by\r\nVulpes as an instrument for removing the eschar formed by a cautery, as it\r\nwas found lying alongside a small trident-shaped cautery. It is doubtful\r\nwhether the eschar formed by a cautery was removed at all, and it is\r\nstill more doubtful whether Vulpes is justified in postulating a special\r\ninstrument for doing so, and as this instrument is of phlebotome shape it\r\nis more likely to have been a phlebotome than anything else. It is of\r\nbronze, 8 cm. long and 9 mm. in the broadest part of the blade. The handle\r\nis neatly decorated with raised ring ornamentation.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the discovery of a phlebotome in excavating some\r\ngraves along the line of the old Watling Street Road, in the neighbourhood\r\nof Wroxeter, is given by C. Roach Smith in the _Gentleman's Magazine_\r\n(1862, pt. ii. p. 677):\r\n\r\n    'Several sepulchral interments have been met with of a character\r\n    similar to those usually found in Roman cemeteries. In some of them\r\n    objects of particular interest were found, with urns and other earthen\r\n    vessels; as, for instance, the fragments of a circular mirror in the\r\n    bright, shining, mixed metal commonly known as 'speculum' metal; and\r\n    what appears to be a surgeon's lancet, contrived in a very ingenious\r\n    manner. The point for penetrating the flesh is of steel, not unlike\r\n    that in use at the present day. It is surmounted by a guard to hinder\r\n    it from cutting too deeply, and above this is a handle, which is\r\n    bow-shaped, and of bronze.'\r\n\r\nJ. Corbet Anderson, in _The Roman City at Wroxeter_, p. 92, says it was\r\nembedded in the remains of a case in which it had been carried, and he\r\ngives an illustration of it (Pl. VII, fig. 5). A similar object is\r\nclassified as a surgical instrument in the Louvre, but both these articles\r\nare I believe detached mirror handles. The passage quoted from Hippocrates\r\nshows that the ordinary phlebotome was not guarded in this way. A\r\nphlebotome of the principle of the fleam is figured by Albucasis and the\r\nmethod of using it in dividing the frontal vein by striking it with a comb\r\nis described. There is also a similar instrument in the Naples Museum,\r\nfrom Pompeii, which is classed as a veterinary instrument (Pl. VIII, fig.\r\n3). It is probable, however, that such an instrument was used by Roman\r\nphysicians, as the offices of surgeon and veterinarian were often held by\r\nthe same individual in Roman times. It is not unlikely that the method is\r\nreferred to by Antyllus in the passage beginning--ποτὲ μὲν καταπείροντες\r\nποτὲ δὲ ἀναπείροντες φλεβοτοῦμεν (Oribasius, _Collect._ VII. x).\r\n\r\nThis passage describing the technique of phlebotomy has given rise to\r\ngreat and voluminous discussion (see Daremberg's Oribas. vol. ii. p. 776)\r\nfrom the fact that Antyllus goes on to state that we operate\r\nκαταπείροντες--cutting inwards--in cases where the vessels are deep, and\r\nἀναπείροντες--cutting outwards--where the vessels are superficial, and the\r\nadvice has seemed to most commentators to be the reverse of what one would\r\nexpect. The explanation seems to me to be simple. Superficial vessels are\r\nthose which could be seen standing out on applying the fillet, and were to\r\nbe divided by the method in vogue at the present day by transfixing the\r\nvessel through its middle and bringing the lancet outwards. The reason of\r\nthis is that the danger of injuring important structures lying deep to the\r\nvein was well understood by the ancients. Thus Galen warns against\r\nwounding the nerve in phlebotomy of the median, the tendon of the biceps\r\nin phlebotomy of the scapulo-cephalic, the artery in dividing the basilic,\r\nand so on. But in opening deep-lying veins the method of transfixing was\r\ninapplicable, and the bone was cut boldly down upon till the issue of\r\nblood showed that the vein was opened. The deep vessels which were divided\r\nwere those about the scalp, and as they had no important relations they\r\nwere divided by cutting through everything overlying the bone, often with\r\nrazor-shaped knives. Thus Paulus Aegineta (VI. vii) says: 'When many deep\r\nvessels send a copious defluxion to the eyes we have recourse to the\r\noperation called Periscyphismus.' This consisted in making a transverse\r\nincision down to the bone over the vertex from one temple to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The 'Katias.'_\r\n\r\nΚατιάς -ιάδος (ἡ) (Soranus, II. xviii); καθιάς (Paul, VI. lxxiv);\r\nκατιάδιον (τό) (Aetius, II. iii. 2); κατειάδιον (τό) (Aretaeus, _Cur.\r\nMorb. Diut._ i. 2).\r\n\r\nIn Soranus (Bib. II. xviii. par. 59, p. 359, ed. Rose) there occurs\r\nmention of an instrument for puncturing the membranes where they do not\r\nrupture spontaneously:\r\n\r\n    Χόριον δὲ μὴ ἀναστομούμενον κατιάδι προσεχόντως διαιρεῖν τῷ δακτύλῳ\r\n    προκοιλάναντα τι μέρος.\r\n\r\nThe Latin version of Moschion has:\r\n\r\n    Folliculum verum non ruptum ante digito impresso formantes locum\r\n    phlebotomo sollicite dividimus omnibus praedictis post encymatismis\r\n    utimur (xviii. 10, p. 83, ed. Rose).\r\n\r\nHowever, we cannot accept this as conclusive evidence that the katias was\r\nthe same as the phlebotome, as I have already pointed out that this\r\nversion of Moschion is a late retranslation into Latin of a Greek\r\ntranslation of the original Moschion. While the meagre references to the\r\nkatias point to its having been a similar instrument to the phlebotome, it\r\nis by no means certain that the instruments were identical. The next\r\nwriter who notices the instrument is Aretaeus, who mentions it in the cure\r\nof headaches (_Cur. Morb. Diut._ i. 2):\r\n\r\n    'We abstract blood from the nostrils, and for this purpose push into\r\n    them a long instrument named κατειάδιον, or the one called the scoop'\r\n    (τορύνη).\r\n\r\nIn a note to his edition of Celsus, Lee says Aretaeus 'invented an\r\ninstrument having at the end a blade of grass, or made like a blade of\r\ngrass, which was thrust into the nostrils to excite an haemorrhage in some\r\naffections of the head. This instrument is named κατειάδιον, from κατά and\r\nεἴα a blade of grass'.\r\n\r\nI have shown, however, that Soranus, who wrote a century before Aretaeus,\r\nused the term, and a comparison of the various forms in which the word\r\nappears seems to me to point rather to a connexion with καθίημι, one\r\nmeaning of which is 'to let blood'. The next writer who mentions it is\r\nAetius (II. iii. 2, and again II. iv. 14), where he refers to its use in\r\nopening quinsy, in a chapter copied from Leonidas:\r\n\r\n    'If the patient be adult make him sit down, and, opening his mouth,\r\n    depress the tongue with a spatula or a tongue depressor, and open the\r\n    abscess with a scalpel or katias' (σμιλαρίῳ ἢ κατιάδι).\r\n\r\nPaul says that abscess of the womb is to be exposed with a speculum and\r\nopened with a scalpel or katias (σπαθίῳ ἢ κατιάδι). Paul also refers to it\r\nin perforating the foetal cranium in delivery obstructed through\r\nhydrocephaly (πολυπικῷ σπαθίῳ ἢ καθιάδι ἢ σκολοπομαχαιρίῳ) (VI. lxxiv).\r\n\r\nThese somewhat scanty materials, summed up, give us the following results.\r\nWe find the instrument used for opening the chorion, opening abscess of\r\nthe womb, perforating the foetal cranium, drawing blood from the inside of\r\nthe nose, and opening abscess of the tonsil. It cannot have been a needle,\r\nas Adams and Cornarius translate it, as some of these applications (e. g.\r\nperforating the foetal cranium) could not have been performed with a\r\nneedle. The uses to which the instrument was put correspond very closely\r\nto the uses of the phlebotome, and from this and from the etymological\r\nsignificance of the word I am inclined to think that if it is not\r\nidentical with the phlebotome it is at least only a variety of that\r\ninstrument, with a handle longer than usual in order to adapt it for\r\nuterine and intranasal operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spathion and Hemispathion._\r\n\r\nGreek, σπαθίον (diminutive of σπάθη), ἡμισπάθιον; Latin, _spatha_.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions a knife called σπαθίον is mentioned. Paul (VI.\r\nlxxiii) says of abscess of the womb:\r\n\r\n    'When the abscess is explored, if it is soft (and this may be\r\n    ascertained by touching it with the finger) it is to be opened with a\r\n    spathion or a needle knife' (σπαθίῳ ἢ κατιάδι).\r\n\r\nAgain, Paul (VI. lxxviii) says:\r\n\r\n    Find the orifice of the fistula, pass an ear probe through it and cut\r\n    down upon it. Divide the whole fistula with a hemispathion or a\r\n    fistula-knife (ἡμισπαθίῳ ἢ σπαθίῳ συριγγοτόμῳ).\r\n\r\nWhat the nature of the σπαθίον was, if indeed it was a distinct instrument\r\nand not a term for scalpels in general, we cannot definitely say. The\r\netymology of the word would indicate a blade of the shape of a weaver's\r\nspattle, the two edges running into one at the point. Heister (i. 651) and\r\nRhodius (Commentar. in _Scrib. Larg._ p. 46) agree in making the spathion\r\na large two-edged scalpel, as also does Scultetus, who says of it:\r\n\r\n    Scalpellum ancipitem esse utrimque acutum et in superiore parte paulo\r\n    latum, qui in extremitate sua in unam cuspidem coiret (_Arm. Chir._\r\n    Tab. II, fig. 1).\r\n\r\nWe shall see that one variety of spathion--that for detaching nasal\r\npolypus--was certainly of this shape.\r\n\r\nRhodius (loc. cit.) says the hemispathion is a small variety of the\r\nspathion.\r\n\r\nAn instrument in the Louvre has two blades of this shape at either end of\r\na round handle ornamented with rolling grooves (Pl. VIII, fig. 8).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polypus Knife._\r\n\r\nGreek, πολυπικὸν σπαθίον, πολυποδικὸν σπαθίον; Latin, _ferramentum acutum\r\nmodo spathae factum_.\r\n\r\nPaulus Aegineta (VI. xxv) thus describes the excision of nasal polypus:\r\n\r\n    'Holding in his right hand the polypus scalpel, which is shaped like a\r\n    myrtle leaf and sharp pointed (πολυπικῷ σπαθίῳ τῷ μυρσινοειδεῖ\r\n    ἀκμαίῳ), we cut round the polypus or fleshy tumour, applying the point\r\n    of the steel blade (τὴν ἀκμὴν τοῦ σιδήρου) to the part where it\r\n    adheres to the nose. Afterwards turning the instrument end for end\r\n    (ἀντιστρέψαντες) we bring out the separated fleshy body with the\r\n    scoop' (τῷ κυαθίσκῳ).\r\n\r\nThis description reminds us very forcibly of Celsus's account of the\r\noperation:\r\n\r\n    Ferramento acuto modo spathae facto, resolvere ab osse oportet. Ubi\r\n    abscissus est unco ferramento extrahendus est (VII. x).\r\n\r\nThese passages, especially that from Paul, show that like the majority of\r\nRoman instruments the polypus scalpel was a double instrument, with a\r\nsharp-pointed leaf-shaped blade at one end and a scoop at the other. The\r\nfact that it was able to work inside the nose shows that it could not have\r\nbeen of any great breadth. Paul says it was able to be used in the\r\nauditory canal.\r\n\r\n    'If there be a fleshy excrescence it may be excised with a pterygium\r\n    knife or the polypus scalpel' (VI. xxiv).\r\n\r\nThis shows that it was less than a quarter of an inch broad at the most.\r\nIt was used for several other purposes. Soranus refers to it for opening\r\nthe foetal head in cranioclasis:--\r\n\r\n    Εἰ δὲ μείζονος τοῦ κεφαλίου ὑπάρχοντος ἡ σφήνωσις ἀποτελοῖτο, διὰ τοῦ\r\n    ἐμβρυοτόμου ἢ τοῦ πολυπικοῦ σπαθίου κρυπτομένου μεταξὺ λιχανοῦ καὶ τοῦ\r\n    μακροῦ δακτύλου κατὰ τὴν ἔνθεσιν (xviii. 63).\r\n\r\nPaul copies this (VI. lxxiv). Soranus also says it may be used for\r\ndividing the membranes where they delay in rupturing.\r\n\r\nThere are two instruments of steel which are of the form indicated above.\r\nOne is in the Museum of Montauban (Tarne-et-Garonne). The other was found\r\nat Vieille-Toulouse and is shown in Pl. VIII, fig. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lithotomy Knife._\r\n\r\nGreek, λιθοτόμον (τό); Latin, _scalpellus_.\r\n\r\nIn describing lithotomy Paul says:\r\n\r\n    'We take the instrument called the lithotomy knife (τὸ καλούμενον\r\n    λιθοτόμον), and between the anus and the testicles, not however in the\r\n    middle of the perinaeum, but on one side, towards the left buttock, we\r\n    make an oblique incision cutting down straight on the stone where it\r\n    projects' (VI. lx).\r\n\r\nCelsus, whose description of the operation is famous, gives us no more\r\nhint of the shape of the lithotomy knife than Paul does. He only says\r\n'multi hic scalpello usi sunt', and as he uses 'scalpellus' to denote all\r\nsorts of different knives, we can draw no information from that term. We\r\nmay note, however, that both Celsus and Paul describe the operation as\r\nbeing performed by fixing the stone by means of the left index finger\r\ninserted in the anus, and cutting down directly upon it with one stroke as\r\nin opening an abscess. Now this sort of incision was always performed by\r\nearly surgeons with a two-edged scalpel sharp at the point, and a knife of\r\nthis sort was used for lithotomy by the Arabian surgeons, and after them\r\nby European surgeons down to comparatively recent times. Heister, for\r\ninstance, shows as a lithotomy knife a large knife, like a phlebotome in\r\nshape. It is most likely, therefore, that the Greeks and Romans used a\r\nknife of this shape also.\r\n\r\nA passage in Rufus of Ephesus shows that in his time the lithotomy knife\r\nhad the handle shaped like a hook to extract the stone after the perineal\r\nincision was made:\r\n\r\n    Καὶ εἰ μὲν πρόχειρος εἴη, τῇ λαβῇ τοῦ μαχαιρίου ἐκβάλλειν, πεπιεσμένον\r\n    δὲ τῇ λαβῇ τραχείᾳ τε καὶ καμπύλῃ ἐξ ἄκρου, ὡς ἂν μάλιστα συμφέροι τῷ\r\n    ἔργῳ.\r\n\r\n    'And if it (the stone) be at hand we must eject it with the handle of\r\n    the knife, made with the handle roughened and curved at the tip, as\r\n    best suited for the operation' (ed. cit. p. 52).\r\n\r\nOne of the knives in the scalpel box shown in Pl. IV has the handle of\r\nthis curved shape.\r\n\r\nAlthough Celsus gives us no information about the shape of the ordinary\r\nlithotomy knife, he goes on to describe in detail a special variety of\r\nlithotomy knife invented by Meges, a surgeon of whom he had a very high\r\nopinion. As this passage has given rise to much discussion I shall quote\r\nCelsus's description in full:\r\n\r\n    Multi hic quoque scalpello usi sunt. Meges (quoniam is infirmior est\r\n    potestque in aliquam prominentiam incidere, incisoque super illam\r\n    corpore qua cavum subest, non secare sed relinquere quod iterum incidi\r\n    necesse sit) ferramentum fecit rectum, in summa parte labrosum, in\r\n    ima semicirculatum acutumque. Id receptum inter duos digitos, indicem\r\n    ac medium, super pollice imposito, sic deprimebat ut simul cum carne\r\n    si quid ex calculo prominebat incideret, quo consequabatur ut semel\r\n    quantum satis esset aperiret (VII. xxvi).\r\n\r\n    'Here many have used the scalpel. Meges (since it is rather weak and\r\n    may cut down upon some projecting part, and while the tissues\r\n    overlying that are divided it may not divide those where there is a\r\n    hollow underneath, but may leave a portion which requires to be\r\n    divided afterwards) made an instrument straight, with a projecting lip\r\n    at the heel and rounded and cutting at the tip. This, held between the\r\n    two fingers, index and middle, the thumb being placed on the top, he\r\n    pushed down so as to divide not only tissues but any projecting\r\n    portion of the calculus, and as a consequence at one stroke he made a\r\n    sufficient opening.'\r\n\r\nEtangs in his edition of Celsus gives as his idea of the instrument\r\ndescribed an instrument of the shape indicated in the accompanying diagram\r\n(Pl. VIII, fig. 6). Thus he makes the cutting edge a concave semicircle,\r\nand therefore we may dismiss his conjecture, for a cutting edge on this\r\nprinciple would never cut its way into the bladder in the manner described\r\nby Celsus.\r\n\r\nDaremberg (_Gaz. Med. de Paris_, 1847, p. 163, &c.) conjectures an\r\ninstrument which seems to me to be nearer the true interpretation (Pl.\r\nVIII, fig. 4). This instrument, with some modification, I would accept.\r\nThe lunated handle figured by Daremberg is not strictly speaking what is\r\nmeant by _labrosum_, and _summa parte_ I take to refer to the back part of\r\nthe blade, and not to the back part of the instrument as a whole. _Rectum_\r\nI take to indicate that the instrument was straight and not a curved\r\nbistoury. I conceive that the lithotomy knife of Meges was only a\r\nmodification of the one in general use, and that in order to enable it to\r\nbe held more firmly in the manner described by Celsus, Meges raised a lip\r\non the handle at the heel of the blade, and in order to allow it to cut\r\nits way into the stone itself to some extent (which was his avowed object)\r\nhe rounded the end of the blade, so that it might be rocked upon the\r\nstone without chipping as a pointed blade would do. I think the above\r\nexplanation provides an instrument corresponding to a legitimate\r\ninterpretation of the text and at the same time suited for the operation\r\nindicated (Pl. VIII, fig. 5).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Perforator for the foetal cranium._\r\n\r\nGreek, ἐμβρυοτόμον.\r\n\r\nA special instrument for perforating the foetal cranium is mentioned by\r\nSoranus (II. viii. p. 366):\r\n\r\n    Εἰ δὲ μείζονος τοῦ κεφαλίου ὑπάρχοντος ἡ σφήνωσις ἀποτελοῖτο, διὰ τοῦ\r\n    ἐμβρυοτόμου ἢ τοῦ πολυπικοῦ σπαθίου κρυπτομένου μεταξὺ λιχανοῦ καὶ τοῦ\r\n    μακροῦ δακτύλου κατὰ τὴν ἔνθεσιν.\r\n\r\n    'If the head be too big, the obstruction may be removed by the\r\n    embryotome, or the polypus knife, concealed between the index finger\r\n    and the thumb during its introduction.'\r\n\r\nThe other authors who recommend this unpleasant operation use mostly the\r\npolypus-scalpel or the phlebotome, and hence we may conjecture that a\r\nstraight two-edged blade was considered the most suitable. The embryotome\r\nfigured by Albucasis is of this shape (Pl. VIII, fig. 7), as is also the\r\ncutting part of the perforators of more modern times--fortunately now\r\nobsolete.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Probe pointed blade with two cutting edges._\r\n\r\nThere is in the Orfila Museum, Paris, a fine little two-edged bistoury of\r\nbronze with a probe point (Pl. VIII, fig. 2). It is a relic of the Roman\r\noccupation of Egypt. Its use must remain a matter of conjecture as we have\r\nno written description of such an instrument. It is perhaps a fistula\r\nknife.\r\n\r\n\r\nII A. (_a_) _Curved bistoury--'Crow Bill.'_\r\n\r\nGreek, ὀξυκόρακον σμίλιον.\r\n\r\nIn extirpating warts Paul (VI. lxxxvii) says we put them on the stretch\r\nwith a vulsella and extirpate them radically with a scalpel shaped like a\r\ncrow's beak or a phlebotome (ὀξυκοράκῳ σμιλίῳ ἢ φλεβοτόμῳ ἐκ ῥιζῶν\r\nἐξελεῖν). This undoubtedly refers to a curved scalpel, for the grappling\r\nhook was called κόραξ.\r\n\r\nIn Celsus the instrument appears under the term _corvus_. In describing\r\nthe opening of the scrotal sac in the operation for the radical cure of\r\nhernia he says:\r\n\r\n    Deinde eam ferramento, quod a similitudine corvum vocant, incidere sic\r\n    ut intrare duo digiti, index et medius, possint (VII. xix).\r\n\r\nVulpes (Tav. VII, 3 and 4) figures two curved bistouries from the Naples\r\nMuseum. They have lost their tips. Both are of the same shape, but one has\r\nthe blade slightly larger than the other. The handles are of bronze, the\r\nblades of steel. A good example is seen in the Athens scalpel box (Pl.\r\nIV).\r\n\r\nA powerful variety so strongly curved as to resemble a small billhook was\r\nfound in the Roman hospital at Baden (Pl. IX, fig. 5). The handle is of\r\nivory, the blade is of steel, and there is a mounting of bronze.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pterygium Knife._\r\n\r\nGreek, πτερυγοτόμος, ὁ; Latin, _scalpellus_.\r\n\r\nPaul (VI. xviii), quoting Aetius, II. iii. 60, says that there were two\r\nmethods of curing pterygium. In the first the pterygium was raised by a\r\nsmall sharp hook, and a needle carrying a horsehair and a strong flaxen\r\nthread was passed under it. Tension being made on the thread by an\r\nassistant, the operator sawed off the pterygium towards the apex by means\r\nof the horsehair. The base of the pterygium was then severed with the\r\nscalpel for the plastic operation on entropion. The second method\r\nconsisted in dissecting away the pterygium (stretched as aforesaid with a\r\nthread) with the instrument called the pterygotome (πτερυγοτόμῳ) care\r\nbeing taken not to injure the lids.\r\n\r\nAetius (II. iii. 74) says that adhesion of the sclerotic to the lid may be\r\nseparated by means of the pterygotome. Paul (VI. xxii) in empyema of the\r\nlachrymal sac dissects out the part between the sac and the canthus with\r\nthe pterygotome, and again in excision of polypus aurium he says it may be\r\nemployed. These uses of the pterygotome point to its having been a\r\nsharp-pointed knife of a small size. Albucasis, who conveys entire the\r\npassage on pterygium from Paul, gives figures of both these instruments.\r\nThe pterygotome which Albucasis depicts is a small, narrow, sharp-pointed\r\nscalpel (Pl. IX, fig. 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Knife for plastic operation on the eyelid._\r\n\r\nGreek, ἀναρραφικὸν σμιλίον.\r\n\r\nI have in describing the pterygotome given one instance of the use of the\r\n'scalpel for the plastic operation', viz. to dissect away the base of a\r\npterygium the rest of which had been separated off by means of sawing with\r\na horsehair. The plastic operation for entropion seems to have been one\r\nwhich was very frequently required. We know that granular ophthalmia with\r\ntrichiasis as a sequela was very rife. Aetius (quoting from Leonidas) and\r\nPaul give very nearly the same account of the operation to remedy the\r\ntrichiasis. Paul says:\r\n\r\n    'Having placed the patient on a seat either before us or on the left\r\n    hand, we turn the upper eyelid outwards, and if it has long hairs we\r\n    take hold of them between the index finger and thumb of the left hand;\r\n    but if they are very short we push a needle having a thread through\r\n    the middle of the tarsus from within outwards. Then stretching the\r\n    eyelid with the left hand by means of this thread, with the point of\r\n    the scalpel held in the right hand, having everted the eyelid, behind\r\n    the thread we make the inferior incision inside the hairs which\r\n    irritate the eye, extending from the larger canthus to the smaller\r\n    along the tarsus. After the inferior incision, having extracted the\r\n    thread and having put a small compress under the thumb of the left\r\n    hand, we stretch the eyelid upwards. Then arranging other small\r\n    compresses on the canthi at their extremities we direct the assistant,\r\n    who stands behind, to stretch the eyelid by means of them. Then by\r\n    means of the 'scalpel for the plastic operation' (ἀναρραφικοῦ σμιλίου)\r\n    we make the first incision called the 'arrow-shaped' a little above\r\n    the hairs which are normal, extending from canthus to canthus and\r\n    penetrating only the depth of the skin. Afterwards we make the\r\n    incision called the crescent-shaped, beginning at the same place as\r\n    the former and carrying it upwards to such a height as to enclose the\r\n    whole superabundant skin and ending in like manner as it did. Thus the\r\n    whole skin within the incision will have the shape of a myrtle leaf.\r\n    Having perforated the angle of this portion with a hook we dissect\r\n    away the whole skin. Then washing away the clots with a sponge we\r\n    unite the lips of the incision with three or four sutures' (VII.\r\n    viii).\r\n\r\nThe use of the scalpel for the plastic operation, therefore, was to make\r\nan incision in the eyelid in such a way as to enclose a leaf-shaped area\r\nand to dissect off the skin surrounded by the incision. Albucasis figures\r\nit as a small but fairly broad blade with a rounded cutting tip (Pl. IX,\r\nfig. 3).\r\n\r\nIt must have been a small scalpel to suit the operation described, and to\r\nmake the dissection indicated it must have been sharp-pointed. It is\r\ncontrasted to some extent with the pterygotome by Paul, and we saw that\r\nthe pterygotome was narrow and sharp-pointed. These various references to\r\nits use are in agreement with the supposition that it was of the shape\r\nfigured by Albucasis. I have considered it here because the question of\r\nits shape is rather hypothetical, and therefore it seemed best to consider\r\nit close by its confrere the pterygotome. We may recall the fact that in\r\nthe grave of the third-century oculist Severus several tiny scalpel\r\nhandles were found. These were probably handles for these two ophthalmic\r\nscalpels, but unfortunately only a trace of the steel remains. Védrènes,\r\nin his edition of Celsus, figures an instrument from Pompeii of a shape\r\nwhich we are accustomed to associate with eye work (Pl. IX, fig. 6).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Uvula Knife._\r\n\r\nGreek, σταφυλοτόμον.\r\n\r\nThis is a special scalpel for throat work, of whose shape we know\r\nnothing. It is mentioned by Paul as a special scalpel for excision of the\r\nuvula:\r\n\r\n    'Wherefore, having seated the patient in the sunlight and directed him\r\n    to gape wide, we seize with the uvula forceps or a common tenaculum\r\n    upon the elongated part and drag it downwards and excise it with the\r\n    instrument called the uvula knife (σταφυλοτόμῳ), or the scalpel used\r\n    for the plastic operation on the eyelid' (VI. xxxi).\r\n\r\nThe knife figured by Albucasis as used for the purpose is a small curved\r\nbistoury (Pl. IX, fig. 4). We have no other means of determining its\r\nshape. I have placed it here because it was mentioned along with the\r\n'scalpel for the operation on the eyelid'.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blade curved on the flat.--Tonsil Knife._\r\n\r\nGreek, ἀγκυλοτόμον (ἀγκύλη, 'bend of elbow,' _or_ ἀγκύλος, 'crooked').\r\n\r\nThis instrument is described by Paul (VI. xxx) in the operation for\r\nremoving the tonsils:\r\n\r\n    'Wherefore, having seated the patient in the sunlight, and directed\r\n    him to open his mouth, one assistant holds his head and another\r\n    presses down the tongue with a tongue depressor. We take a hook and\r\n    perforate the tonsil with it and drag it outwards as much as we can\r\n    without dragging the capsule out along with it, and then we cut it off\r\n    by the root with the tonsillotome (ἀγκυλοτόμον) suited to that hand,\r\n    for there are two such instruments having opposite curvatures. After\r\n    the excision of one we may operate on the other in the same way.'\r\n\r\nThis passage clearly proves that there were two scalpels of a set, each\r\nhaving opposite curvatures after the manner of our right and left\r\nvesicovaginal fistula knives.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Curved blade cutting on one side, blunt-pointed.--Fistula Knife._\r\n\r\nGreek, συριγγοτόμον, from σῦριγξ, 'a fistula.'\r\n\r\nThis was a falciform blade whose end was blunt, but the handle end was\r\nprolonged into a slender, rounded sound-like portion with a sharp point\r\n(Pl. IX, fig. 1). The narrow point was passed into a fistula, caught, and\r\nthe whole instrument pulled outwards by means of it, thus dividing the\r\noverlying tissues with the falciform blade. This instrument remained in\r\nuse till comparatively recent times. Heister figures a large number of\r\nvarieties, and from him I have taken the figure shown, although it is also\r\ndescribed and figured by Fabricius. The two following passages, taken in\r\nconjunction with each other, show that the classical instrument was of the\r\nform I have indicated. The first passage, from Galen, shows that the end\r\nof the blade was blunt, and that there was only one cutting side. The\r\nsecond, from Paul, shows that the blade was falciform and was operated in\r\nthe manner I have stated. Galen (x. 415) says that in enlarging an\r\nabdominal wound we use a fistula knife (συριγγοτόμῳ). 'But the scalpels\r\nwhich are two-edged or have a point are distinctly to be avoided' (τὰ δ'\r\nἀμφήκη τῶν μαχαιρίων ἢ κατὰ τὸ πέρας ὀξέα παντὶ τρόπῳ φευκτέα).\r\n\r\nSecondly, Paul (VI. lxxviii) says:\r\n\r\n    'Having perforated the bottom of the fistula with the point of the\r\n    falciform part of the syringotome (τοῦ δρεπάνου τοῦ συριγγοτόμου)\r\n    bring the instrument out of the anus and so divide all the intervening\r\n    space with the edge of the falciform part' (τῇ ἀκμῇ τοῦ δρεπάνου).\r\n\r\nAnother passage in the same chapter indicates that some of the\r\nsyringotomes had an eye in the instrument:\r\n\r\n    Τινὲς δὲ ἐν τῷ τρήματι τοῦ συριγγιακοῦ δρεπάνου τὸ λίνον ἐνείραντες.\r\n\r\nThere was also a straight variety of the instrument (τὰ καλούμενα ὀρθὰ\r\nσυριγγοτόμα, Paul, VI. lii).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Curved blade cutting on two edges._\r\n\r\nA curved blade of a somewhat unusual type is described by Galen in\r\ndiscussing the dissection of the thorax (ii. 673). However, the\r\ndescription is unmistakably clear. He says:\r\n\r\n    Χρῆσθαι δ' αὐτῆς μάλιστα τῷ κυρτῷ μέρει κεχαλκευμένης ὁμοίως\r\n    ἑκατέρωθεν, ὥστε ἀμφικύρτους ἔχειν ἀμφότερας τὰς τεμνούσας γραμμὰς\r\n    ἀλλὰ κατὰ μὲν τὴν ἑτέραν σιμῆς, κατὰ δὲ τὴν ἀντικειμένην ταύτῃ κυρτῆς.\r\n\r\n    'It is best to have the curved part forged alike on both sides so that\r\n    the cutting edges are curved in two ways, viz. one concave and the\r\n    other convex.'\r\n\r\nA smaller variety for fine dissection is referred to in the same book (εἰς\r\nὅπερ ἐστὶν ἐπιτηδειοτάτη μυρσίνη κυρτή, ii. 674).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shears._\r\n\r\nGreek, ψαλίς; Latin, _forfex_.\r\n\r\nOribasius treats of cutting the hair as a regular medical procedure, in a\r\nspecial chapter, περὶ κουρᾶς καὶ ξυρήσεως. Celsus also frequently refers\r\nto cutting the hair as a therapeutic measure. Possibly the ancients found\r\ndifficulty in putting an edge sufficiently smooth for surgical purposes on\r\ntheir shears. We have a few references to the use of the shears for\r\ncutting tissues. Celsus, in the treatment of abdominal injury with\r\nprotusion of omentum, says:\r\n\r\n    Omentum quoque considerandum est: ex quo, si quid iam nigri et emortui\r\n    est, forfice excidi debet: si integrum est, leniter super intestina\r\n    deduci (VII. xvi).\r\n\r\nAgain in the operation for the radical cure of hernia he says:\r\n\r\n    Fuerunt etiam qui omentum forfice praeciderent: quod in parvulo non\r\n    est necessarium; si maius est, potest profusionem sanguinis facere,\r\n    siquidem omentum quoque venis quibusdam etiam maioribus illigatum est.\r\n    Neque vero, si discisso ventre id prolapsum forfice praeciditur, quum\r\n    et emortuum sit et aliter tutius avelli non possit, inde huc exemplum\r\n    transferendum est (VII. xxi):\r\n\r\n    'There have been others who cut away the omentum with scissors, which\r\n    is unnecessary if the portion is small; and if very great it may\r\n    occasion a profuse haemorrhage, since the omentum is connected with\r\n    some of even the largest veins. But this objection cannot be applied\r\n    in cases where, the belly being cut open, the prolapsed omentum is\r\n    removed with shears, since it may be both gangrenous and unable to be\r\n    removed in any other way with safety.'\r\n\r\nWe have also two references in Paulus Aegineta. He says some of the\r\nmoderns effect a cure of warty excrescences on the penis by a pair of\r\nshears (ψαλίδι, VI. lviii), and dealing with relaxation of the scrotum he\r\nsays that Antyllus, having first transfixed the superfluous skin with\r\nthree or four ligatures, cut off what was external to them with a pair of\r\nsharp-pointed shears or a scalpel (ψαλίδι ἐπάκμῳ ἢ σμίλῃ), and having\r\nsecured the parts with sutures he effected healing with the treatment for\r\nrecent wounds.\r\n\r\nShears are very common objects in museums. Some are of bronze and some are\r\nof steel. Judging from the relative numbers in which they have been\r\npreserved it would seem that the steel shears far outnumbered the bronze.\r\nIn Pl. X, fig. 5 is shown a bronze pair from the Naples Museum, found in\r\nPompeii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPROBES\r\n\r\n\r\nGreek, μήλη, κοπάριον, ὑπάλειπτρον, ὑπαλειπτρίς; Latin, _specillum_.\r\n\r\nThis is a very comprehensive class. The original specillum was no doubt a\r\nsimple sound. Varro thus defines the specillum: 'Quo oculos inunguimus\r\nquibus specimus specillum est. Graecis μήλη dicitur.' Thus it meant a\r\nprobe or sound.\r\n\r\nμήλη is probably derived from μῆλον, an apple or fruit, from the olivary\r\nenlargement at the end of a sound.\r\n\r\nThe term ὑπάλειπτρον, which is frequently used by Hippocrates, originally\r\nmeant an ointment spatula, being derived from ὑπαλείφω, to spread\r\nointment. But the custom of combining two instruments on one shaft\r\ngradually led to the application of these terms, especially the term\r\nspecillum, to denote a large variety of instruments.\r\n\r\nThe name κοπάριον is evidently derived from the resemblance of the probe\r\nto the pestle, which was such a frequent utensil in Greek homes. It is\r\nconnected with κόπανον, 'pestle,' κοπανιστήριον, 'mortar,' and κοπανίζω,\r\n'bray,' and κοπτάριον, a medicament pounded in a mortar (Dioscorides, iv.\r\n190). The exact significance of the term κοπάριον is sometimes difficult\r\nto determine. It is easy to prove that in general it is merely a sound.\r\nThus Paul (VI. lxxviii), in quoting a passage from Hippocrates,\r\nsubstitutes κοπάριον for the word μήλη, which Hippocrates uses to denote\r\nthe sound used for exploring a fistula. Throughout this chapter, in which\r\nthe word occurs ten times in all, Briau translates it by 'manche du\r\nscalpel', although the whole context shows that a probe is meant. Even\r\nwhere it is spoken of as an eyed probe (διὰ τετρημένου κοπαρίου) Briau\r\ntranslates it by 'au moyen du manche percé d'un scalpel', an expression\r\nwhich is meaningless to a surgeon. Briau evidently thinks it is derived\r\nfrom κόπτω, and at times it seems as if it might denote a cutting\r\ninstrument. Thus Adams, in a note to Paul, VI. lxxvii, says, 'if the\r\nκοπάριον, however, was the same as the μήλη or specillum it was evidently\r\nused for cutting with, as well as for cutting upon', and on one occasion\r\n(Paul, VI. lxxx) he translates κοπάριον by 'knife'. Liddell and Scott\r\ntranslate it as 'a small knife'. A careful examination of those passages\r\nwhere it seems to indicate a cutting instrument will show, however, that\r\nonly blunt dissection, which was frequently performed with the spatula end\r\nof a probe, is meant. I am quite convinced that the word κοπάριον is only\r\na late Greek term for the earlier μήλη, and means essentially a sound, and\r\nnot a knife. While on this subject we may note that throughout the codices\r\nand texts there is great confusion between words meaning probe and words\r\nmeaning scalpel. The proper forms σμίλη, 'scalpel,' and μήλη, 'probe,' are\r\ndistinct, but the inferior reading σμήλη is frequent in both codices and\r\ntexts as a bastard, for σμίλη is often written σμήλη incorrectly, and μήλη\r\noften becomes σμήλη, just as μικρός is written σμικρός. Thus in Paul (VI.\r\nviii), where the author is describing the eversion of the eyelid by means\r\nof the olivary point of a probe (τῷ πυρῆνι τῆς μήλης), four codices and\r\nthe Aldine and Basle texts read σμήλης, two codices read σμύλης, one reads\r\nμήλης, four μίλης, and Briau reads σμίλης. In a case like this only a\r\nknowledge of surgery can tell us whether a probe or scalpel is meant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Specillum as a Sound._\r\n\r\nThe ancients were fully aware of the value of the information to be gained\r\nby searching the recesses of a lesion with a rod of metal. Celsus (v. 28)\r\nsays regarding fistulae:\r\n\r\n    Ante omnia autem demitti specillum in fistulam convenit, ut quo tendat\r\n    et quam alte perveniat scire possimus; simul etiam protinus humida an\r\n    siccior sit: quod extracto specillo patet. Si vero os in vicino est\r\n    id quoque disci potest si iam necne eo fistula penetraverit et\r\n    quatenus nocuerit; nam si molle est quod ultimo specillo contingitur,\r\n    intra carnem adhuc vitium est, si magis id renititur, ad os ventum\r\n    est. Ibi deinde si labitur specillum, nondum caries est: si non\r\n    labitur sed aequali innititur, caries quidem, verum adhuc levis est:\r\n    si inaequale quoque et asperum subest, vehementius os exesum est. At\r\n    cartilago ubi subsit, ipsa sedes docet; perventumque esse ad eam ex\r\n    renisu patet.\r\n\r\n    'But first it is well to put a probe into the fistula to learn where\r\n    it goes and how deeply it reaches, also whether it is moist or rather\r\n    dry as is evident when the probe is withdrawn. Further, if there be\r\n    bone adjacent, it is possible to learn whether the fistula has entered\r\n    it or not and how deeply it has caused disease. For if the part is\r\n    soft which is reached by the end of the probe the disease is still\r\n    intermuscular; if the resistance be greater it has reached the bone:\r\n    if there the probe slip there is as yet no caries. If it does not slip\r\n    but meets with a uniform resistance there is indeed caries, but it is\r\n    as yet slight. If what is below is uneven and rough the bone is\r\n    seriously eroded, and whether there is cartilage below will be known\r\n    by the situation, and if the disease has reached it will be evident\r\n    from the resistance.'\r\n\r\nThese remarks show that with the probe the ancients had cultivated the\r\ntactus eruditus to a high degree, and the remarks of Aetius and Paul are\r\nequally to the point.\r\n\r\nThe tips of the probes which have survived vary considerably in size and\r\nshape. Some have a point which is almost sharp like a stylet; in others\r\nthe natural thickness of the shaft is kept right to the tip, which is\r\nsimply rounded off or there is an oval enlargement like that on our\r\nolivary probes and sounds. In rare cases the enlargement is globular. The\r\noval enlargement was named by the Greeks πυρήν, which means\r\n'olive-kernel'. The sixteenth-century translators uniformly render this by\r\n'nucleus', which is a convenient term to use, but it has no classical\r\nLatin authority. Indeed, there is no classical Latin equivalent used by\r\nmedical authors. Theodorus Priscianus uses _baca_ (_sic_), a berry, and\r\n_bacula_, little berry, and in the _Additamenta_ (I. viii. 21, ed. Rose)\r\nhe uses the transliteration _pyrena meles_. But this is African Latin.\r\n\r\nA probe without enlargement at the tip was called ἀπυρηνομήλη or\r\nἀπυρομήλη. The ear probe is frequently referred to as belonging to this\r\nclass. These probes without nuclei were specially adapted for wrapping\r\nround with wool to apply medicaments, or wipe away discharge.\r\n\r\nThe size of the nucleus varied in different varieties of probe, but was\r\npretty constant in each particular. It was largest in the probe known as\r\nthe spathomele--a combination of spatula and probe which was in extremely\r\ncommon use for pharmaceutical purposes. The nucleus of this probe was such\r\na well-known object that it is frequently referred to as a standard of\r\nsize and shape. Galen (ii. 898) says:\r\n\r\n    'In the cervix uteri is the foramen by which the woman both passes the\r\n    monthly flux and receives the semen of the husband. By it also the\r\n    foetus leaves the womb. It is marvellous how it varies in size\r\n    according to circumstances. When the woman is not pregnant it admits\r\n    the nucleus of a probe or something slightly larger' (πυρῆνα μὲν μήλης\r\n    ἐπιδέχεται ἢ βραχύ τι τούτου παχύτερον).\r\n\r\nHere Kühn translates πυρῆνα by 'acuminatum capitulum specilli', which is\r\nincorrect. It is an olivary enlargement, not sharp point. In Paul (VI.\r\nxc), we have the nucleus given at the measure of distance between the\r\nperforations by which a bone was surrounded preparatory to its excision by\r\nmeans of chisels: 'the space between the perforations made by the drills\r\nshould be the breadth of the nucleus of a probe' (τὸ μῆκος πυρῆνος).\r\n\r\nAetius (III. i. 16) says in volvulus the sphincter ani is so contracted\r\nthat the nucleus of a probe cannot be got in.\r\n\r\nPaul (VI. xxi) says that in couching a cataract we must enter the couching\r\nneedle a nucleus breadth from the iris.\r\n\r\nBesides its use as a sound the nucleus was frequently used as a means of\r\napplying medicaments, either in the form of ointments or dry powder, to\r\naffected parts.\r\n\r\nPaul (VI. ix) says that in the cases of entropion, where the ordinary\r\nplastic operation is objected to, an elliptical piece may be burnt out of\r\nthe eyelid with caustic applied on the nucleus of a probe (πυρηνοσμήλης),\r\nand similarly after removal of sebaceous cysts from the lid, levigated\r\nsalts may be applied on the nucleus (τὸν πυρῆνα τῆς μήλης).\r\n\r\nAetius (II. iv. 23), quoting from Galen, says that in caries of the teeth\r\nsome wax may be warmed on the nucleus of a probe (πυρῆνος μήλης), and\r\nagain (II. iv. 14) he directs us to use it for application of pomade to\r\nthe face (πυρῆνι μήλης). It would seem that this, and not the exploration\r\nof wounds, was the original use to which the olivary-pointed probe was\r\nput, for in early Egyptian tombs small pestle-like probes are, as a rule,\r\nfound accompanying the toilet pigment boxes which are so common. They are\r\nmostly made of wood (Pl. X, fig. 2). The kohl-stick was not unknown to\r\nGreek ladies. (See Eustathius, _Comment. in Iliad_.)\r\n\r\nHitherto I have spoken of the probe as if it were a single instrument;\r\nbut, as a matter of fact, the ends of the shaft are usually fashioned to\r\nserve different purposes. Thus at one end there will be a probe, at the\r\nother a spatula, a spoon, or a hook. Some of these combinations have names\r\nof their own, and others are so frequently met with that they too seem to\r\nhave been constant types.\r\n\r\nIt may simplify matters if we anticipate a little and remark that while\r\nthe uses of the probes in actual surgery were the same as at the present\r\nday, in the minor surgery, consisting of the application of medicaments\r\nand toilet preparations, they were used in a slightly different manner.\r\nSemi-solids, like eyebrow pigment and eye ointments, were applied on\r\nolivary-pointed probes. Liquids, like ear and eye drops, were usually\r\ninstilled by squeezing a ball of wool dipped in the liquid and placed\r\nround the middle of a probe, and letting it run off the point. Thus a\r\ncommon form of toilet instruments consists of a probe-like instrument with\r\nan olive at one end and a sharp stylet at the other. Ligulae with scoops\r\nwere used to withdraw drops of fluid essences, &c. from unguentaria. Some\r\nof these ligulae run up to a foot and a half in length.\r\n\r\nThe specilla which remain to us are mostly made of bronze. A few are\r\noverlaid with gold and silver, and a few are solid gold or solid silver.\r\nWe read, however, of specilla of lead, tin, copper, and wood, and of the\r\nuse of a boar's bristle or a stalk of garlic for searching fistulae.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to classify and discuss these different varieties,\r\npremising, however, that no hard and fast line can be drawn between\r\ndifferent types. They shade off into each other by imperceptible\r\ngradations, so that whatever system of classification we adopt bastard\r\nforms are sure to occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Double Simple Probe._\r\n\r\nGreek, ἀπυρηνομήλη, ἀπυρομήλη; Latin, _specillum_.\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of specillum is a plain rod of metal rounded off at\r\neither end. These are not infrequently met with. I figure one from my\r\ncollection. Its length is 14.5 cm., its diameter 2 mm. At either end it\r\ntapers rapidly off to a blunt point. At a distance of 3 cm. from one end\r\nis a raised ring (Pl. X, fig. 4). A similar probe in silver may be seen in\r\nthe Musée de Cinquantenaire, Brussels. It was found with other probes in\r\nan étui. Pl. X, Fig. 3 shows a rather longer specimen from the Naples\r\nMuseum. A variety with non-tapered ends is seen in Pl. X, fig. 1. It is\r\nalso from the Naples Museum. Pl. XI, fig. 4 shows a probe, from my own\r\ncollection, which carries the snake of Aesculapius at one end. One with a\r\ndouble snake (caduceus form) was found in the Roman Hospital at Baden (Pl.\r\nXI, fig. 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Specilla with two olivary ends._\r\n\r\nGreek, διπύρηνος μήλη, ἀμφίσμιλος.\r\n\r\nA slender sound with slight olivary enlargement at either end is very\r\nfrequently mentioned under the name διπύρηνος μήλη by Galen. He also calls\r\nit ἀμφίσμιλος. Thus he says:\r\n\r\n    Καί σοι διχόθεν ἔστι διεμβάλλειν αὐτοῦ τι τῶν παρασκευασμένων λεπτὸν\r\n    εἴτε ἀμφίσμιλον, εἴτε διπύρηνον ὀνομάζειν ἐθέλεις, εἰ δέ τι λεπτότερον\r\n    δέῃ καὶ μηλωτίδα (ii. 581).\r\n\r\n    'And in the double passage you must insert some one of the slender\r\n    instruments you have at hand, either a double-ended probe (a 'double\r\n    olive' if you prefer to call it so), or if something finer be\r\n    necessary, even an ear probe.'\r\n\r\nIn dealing with fistulae Paul (VI. lxxvii) says:\r\n\r\n    'We must first examine them with a sound if they be straight, or with\r\n    a very flexible 'double olive' (διπυρήνῳ εὐκαμπεῖ), such as those made\r\n    of tin or the smallest of those made of bronze, if they be crooked.'\r\n\r\nPaul refers to its use as a cautery to destroy the roots of hairs after\r\nepilation (VI. xiv):\r\n\r\n    'Some, preferring cauterizing to the operation of transplantation,\r\n    evert the eyelid, and with a cilia forceps dragging out the offending\r\n    hair, or two or even three hairs, apply a heated double-olive probe or\r\n    an ear probe, or some such slender instrument, to the place from which\r\n    the hair or hairs were removed' (Διαπυρίνον ἢ μηλωτίδα ἤ τι τοιοῦτον\r\n    λεπτὸν ὄργανον πεπυρωμένον εἴρουσι τῷ τόπῳ ὅθεν ἡ θρὶξ ἢ αἱ τρίχες\r\n    ἐκομίσθησαν).\r\n\r\nHere Briau reads πυρῆνα (an olivary point), but the balance of the\r\nevidence of the codices is in favour of διαπυρίνον, and the parallel to\r\nthe passage quoted from Galen is so complete that I have no hesitation in\r\nadopting the reading given above.\r\n\r\nI give an example of the dipyrene from my own collection. It is 11·2 cm.\r\nlong. The shaft is unequally divided by a ringed fluting into two\r\nportions; 4·5 cm. and 6·7 cm. long respectively. The shorter portion of\r\nthe shaft is plain, the longer is grooved longitudinally by eight grooves\r\n(Pl. XI, fig. 1). In many instances the dipyrene carried an eye in one of\r\nits olives. This variety is frequently mentioned. Thus Paul (VI. xxv)\r\nsays, under treatment of nasal polypus:\r\n\r\n    'Taking then a thread moderately thick like a cord, and having tied\r\n    knots on it at the distance of two or three finger-breadths, we\r\n    introduce it into the eye of a dipyrene (διπυρήνου τρήματι), and we\r\n    push the other end of the probe (τὸ ἕτερον πέρας τοῦ διπυρήνου)\r\n    upwards to the ethmoid openings, withdrawing it by the palate and the\r\n    mouth, and then pulling with both hands we, as it were, saw the fleshy\r\n    bodies away by means of the knots.'\r\n\r\nPl. XI, figs. 5 and 3 show single olive probes for the application of\r\nsemi-solid medicaments. The former is from the outfit of the oculist of\r\nRheims, in the Museum at St-Germain-en-Laye; the latter, more highly\r\nornamented by spirally twisting the stem, is from my own collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spathomele or Spatula probe._\r\n\r\nGreek, ὑπάλειπτρον, σπαθομήλη; Latin, _spathomele_ (Theodorus Priscianus),\r\n_spathomela_ (Marcellus); German, _Spatelsonde_.\r\n\r\nAlmost every medical writer mentions the spathomele. It consists of a long\r\nshaft with an olivary point at one end and a spatula at the other. Galen\r\n(_Lex._) calls the one στρόγγυλον μήλην, the other μήλη πλατεῖα. It was a\r\npharmaceutical rather than a strictly surgical instrument. The olive end\r\nwas used for stirring medicaments, the spatula for spreading them on the\r\naffected part or on lint. Galen (xiii. 466) says that certain applications\r\nare to be softened in the hand with rosaceum by means of the spathomele\r\n(μαλάξας ἐπὶ τῆς χειρὸς διὰ σπαθομήλης).\r\n\r\nMarcellus frequently refers to it as used for stirring liquids in a\r\nvessel:\r\n\r\n    Immo manu vel digitis moderantibus paulatim insperges et adsidue\r\n    spathomela commovebis et permiscebis, post haec omnia mittes oleum\r\n    chamaemelinum, et iterum igni non nimio adposita olla lente et\r\n    paulatim decoques medicamen, ita ut illud manu non contingas, sed\r\n    spathomela agites (vii. 19).\r\n\r\nIn xiv. 44 he mentions a spathomele of copper:\r\n\r\n    Oportet autem moveri aquam ipsam rudicula vel spathomela aeris rubri.\r\n\r\nThe following passage from Theodorus Priscianus refers to its use for\r\napplying ointment to an affected part:\r\n\r\n    Si veluti carbunculus innatus fuerit, lycium cum melle contritum\r\n    suppono frequenter per diem et spathomela temptante (_Euporiston_,\r\n    xxvii).\r\n\r\nAetius (II. iv. 16) directs a particular medicament to be rubbed in and to\r\nbe scraped off after a moderate space of time with a spathomele (τῇ\r\nσπαθομήλῃ).\r\n\r\nThe spathomele was used by painters for preparing and mixing their\r\ncolours. The very large numbers in which they are found would indicate\r\nthat their use was not confined to medical men.\r\n\r\nAlthough the nucleus of the spathomele was too large to admit of its use\r\nas a probe for small lesions, it is evident that in exploring large\r\ncavities it must have been a valuable instrument. Galen (ii. 712) says:\r\n\r\n    'In small bodies the opening into the torcular Herophili may not be\r\n    large enough to admit a spathomele nucleus, and therefore we must try\r\n    some of the other olivary probes or even an ear probe, and cut\r\n    alongside it.'\r\n\r\nPriscianus alludes to plugging the nares with it:\r\n\r\n    Prius spathomeles extremo in baca molli lana obvoluto glebas sanguinis\r\n    e naribus frequentius purgare nos convenit, post lana identidem\r\n    obturando perclaudere (xiv).\r\n\r\n    'First of all we must frequently wipe away the clots of blood from the\r\n    nose with the end of a spathomele wrapped on the 'berry' with soft\r\n    wool, and then occlude it by plugging with wool in the same way.'\r\n\r\nFrom Leonidas (Aetius, VI) we learn that it was used as a tongue\r\ndepressor. He says:\r\n\r\n    'In inflammation of the throat in adults seat the patient, open his\r\n    mouth and depress the tongue with a tongue depressor or a spathomele,\r\n    and open the abscess with a scalpel or a needle-knife.'\r\n\r\nThe following passage from Galen shows that it was used as a substitute\r\nfor the meningophylax (_q. v._):\r\n\r\n    'Having separated the pleura from the rib and placed a thin\r\n    meningophylax or a flat spathomele (σπαθομήλην πλατεῖαν) between the\r\n    ribs, and taking care that you neither tear nor perforate the\r\n    membrane, which being properly accomplished, cut the bone of the rib\r\n    with two chisels placed opposed to each other' (ii. 686).\r\n\r\nSoranus (xxvii) refers to its use as a cautery:\r\n\r\n    'After cutting off the umbilical cord, cauterize the umbilicus with a\r\n    heated reed, or the flat of a probe' (τοῦ πλάτεος τῆς μήλης).\r\n\r\nAn interesting passage in Aetius shows that it was used as a dissector in\r\nopening up an occluded vagina:\r\n\r\n    'Pass a sound into the cervix, and dissect with the spathomele below\r\n    the spot marked out by the sound' (Aet. IV. iv. 96).\r\n\r\nThis probably means blunt dissection only, as none of the spathomeles\r\nfound have edges sharp enough to be actually cutting. Large numbers of\r\nthis instrument have been found. It is the commonest surgical instrument\r\nin museums. It must be remembered, however, that not every spathomele is a\r\nsurgical instrument strictly speaking, as pharmacopolists and even artists\r\nused exactly similar instruments.\r\n\r\nThe average length of twenty specimens measured by me was 16 cm. Of this\r\nthe nucleus occupies 1·5 cm., the spatula 6 cm. The average diameter of\r\nthe nucleus is 7·5 mm. The width of the spatula averages 15 mm., but the\r\nsize and shape of the spatula both vary considerably.\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of shape will be better understood by a reference\r\nto the accompanying figures of actual specimens than from a written\r\ndescription. Pl. XII shows neatly formed specimens from various sources;\r\nthe specimen shown in fig. 3 having ornamental grooves along the length of\r\nthe shaft. Figs. 3 and 4, Pl. XIII show coarse, thick specimens, which are\r\nmost likely to have been used for non-medical purposes. All have the\r\ncharacteristic oar-blade shape, though the outline varies greatly. In some\r\nthe blade widens out at the end, so that the tip is broad and rounded. In\r\nothers the blade slopes to a rounded point, or the point is quite acute.\r\nThe edges of the blade are usually thick and blunt. In some specimens,\r\nhowever, the edges are thin, sharp, and almost suitable for use for\r\ncutting with. These are well adapted for use as blunt dissectors.\r\n\r\nThe shaft, as a rule, is plain, occasionally it is ornamented with\r\nlongitudinal or spiral fluting. More rare is a silver band, inlaid in a\r\nspiral round the shaft. I have seen a few specimens which have been\r\nentirely plated with gold.\r\n\r\nHitherto I have taken no notice of spathomeles in which the spatulae are\r\nnot flat. In many specimens, however, the blades are hollowed. For these\r\nit seems advisable to constitute a special class, which may be called the\r\ncyathiscomele class.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cyathiscomele._\r\n\r\nGerman, _Löffelsonde_.\r\n\r\nAlthough this variety of the spathomele is not one which is specially\r\nmentioned by any classical writer, it is convenient to have a name by\r\nwhich we can denote that variety of the spathomele in which the blade is\r\nnot flat.\r\n\r\nIt has the same large oval nucleus as the flat spathomele, and the same\r\nshaft, plain, or fluted, or overlaid with silver, but the spatula is\r\nreplaced by a spoon, the outline of which shows the same variety of form\r\nas we met with in the spatula. The depth of the spoon varies greatly. Pl.\r\nXIV, fig. 3 shows an instrument in which the two lateral halves of the\r\nblade, instead of lying exactly in the same plane, meet in the midline at\r\na slight angle so as to form a cavity obtusely angular on cross section,\r\nand gently rounded on longitudinal section:\r\n\r\n  Cross sec. [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  Long. sec. [Illustration]\r\n\r\nPl. XV, fig. 1 shows a similar arrangement, except that the cavity is more\r\nmarked, and the tip instead of being sharp is rounded. In Pl. XIV, fig. 1\r\nthe cavity is so marked that a typical spoon is formed. This specimen is\r\ninteresting as showing the ornamentation of the shaft by overlaying a\r\nspiral silver wire. It is from the Naples Museum, and it is figured by\r\nVulpes. Other varieties are seen in Plates XIV, XV. Pl. XV, fig. 4 shows\r\na very coarse, thick specimen. The scope of the cyathiscomele in medical\r\nart is evidently like the flat spathomele to act occasionally as a sound,\r\nbut mainly to mix, measure, and apply medicaments. Some are adapted for\r\nuse as curettes. But the large number in which this instrument occurs\r\nwould of itself indicate that it was used for lay as well as medical\r\npurposes. Many are toilet articles. An interesting discovery of two\r\ntypical specimens in the grave of a lady artist was made in Vendée in\r\n1847. Among a number of colour pots and alabaster mortars for rubbing down\r\nand mixing colours was an étui similar to the typical cylindrical\r\ninstrument case of the ancient surgeon, and in this were two spoon probes\r\nlike the one shown in Pl. XIV, fig. 1. Evidently they were favourite\r\ninstruments of the painter, and had been used by her for mixing and\r\npreparing her colours.[2]\r\n\r\n    [2] Blümner, _Technologie und Terminologie der Gewerbe und Künste bei\r\n    Griechen und Römern_, vol. iii. p. 458.\r\n\r\nThe form of cyathiscomele, in which the two lateral halves of the scoop\r\nmeet at an angle (Pl. XIV, fig. 1), has a tendency to split along the\r\nridge in the middle of the scoop if roughly handled. One of these, to\r\nwhich this accident has happened, is in the Naples Museum (Pl. XV, fig. 3)\r\nand has an interesting history. In 1847 Vulpes described it as a guard for\r\ndividing the fraenum linguae, and successive writers have copied this ever\r\nsince, and it is so described in the catalogue. As the photograph shows,\r\nit is only a spoon probe which had been trod on or otherwise damaged, and\r\nwhich had split down the centre, or rather near the centre, for the crack\r\nhas deviated at its termination from the midline. The termination of the\r\nnotch thus formed has quite a different appearance from the figure by\r\nVulpes. The accident is not an uncommon one. There is in the Capitoline\r\nMuseum an instrument to which precisely the same has happened, and I have\r\na probe in my own possession which has split, and which with a little\r\nmanipulation would make a beautiful duplicate of the one in the Naples\r\nMuseum (Pl. XV, fig. 1). It is almost certain that the guard is quite a\r\nmodern invention.\r\n\r\nMany ancient writers point out the danger of wounding the vein, but none\r\nmention the guard. Thus Celsus says:\r\n\r\n    Horum extrema lingua vulsella prehendenda est, sub eaque membrana\r\n    incidenda: magna cura habita ne venae quae iuxta sunt violentur et\r\n    profusione sanguinis noceant (VII. xii).\r\n\r\nPaul says:\r\n\r\n    'The patient is to be placed in a proper seat, the tongue is to be\r\n    raised to the roof of the mouth and the membranous fraenum cut\r\n    transversely. But if the curvature is occasioned by a cicatrix we\r\n    transfix the callus by a hook and draw it upwards, and making a cross\r\n    incision free the bent parts, taking care not to make deep incisions\r\n    of the parts, for haemorrhages, which have been found difficult to\r\n    stop, have thereby been occasioned' (VI. xxix).\r\n\r\nAetius gives a similar account.\r\n\r\nThese writers, then, all take note of the possibility of wounding the\r\nvein, but give no clue that they knew of the utility of a cloven plate in\r\npreventing the accident. Further, the Arabs, timid operators all and fond\r\nof describing safeguards such as this, give no mention of it, although\r\nAlbucasis, Rhases, Avicenna, and Haly Abbas all describe the operation. I\r\ncan find no reference to the use of a guard for this purpose until quite\r\nrecent times.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ear specillum._\r\n\r\nGreek, μηλωτίς, -ίδος, μηλωτρίς, ἀπυρομήλη, τῇ πυρῆνα μὴ ἐχούσῃ τούτεστι τῇ\r\nμηλωτρίδι (Galen, Lexicon); ὠτογλυφίς, μήλην ἐξωτίδα (Galen, Lexicon);\r\nLatin, _oricularium specillum_ (Celsus); _auriscalpium_ (Scrib. Largus);\r\nGerman, _Ohrlöffel_.\r\n\r\nOf all the specilla this is one of the most frequently mentioned by name.\r\nIt consists of a small narrow scoop at one end and a simple probe without\r\nolivary enlargement at the other. We shall discuss the scoop first. The\r\nfollowing passage from Archigenes describes it (Galen, xii. 652):\r\n\r\n    'If a bean, stone, &c., fall into the ear remove it with the small\r\n    narrow scoop of the ear specillum' (κυαθίσκῳ στενῷ μικρῷ μηλωτρίδος).\r\n\r\nAgain Galen (loc. cit.) and Paul (VI. xxiv) say that in cases where\r\nforeign bodies cannot be got out of the ear by more simple methods, we\r\nmust incise behind the ear and remove them by means of the ear scoop. The\r\nremoval of foreign bodies from the ear by means of this instrument is very\r\nfrequently referred to and shows that the scoop was small. Celsus says\r\n(VI. vii):\r\n\r\n    'When a person begins to experience a dullness of hearing, which very\r\n    often happens after long continued headaches, first of all we must\r\n    examine the ear itself, for there will appear either a scab such as\r\n    occurs upon ulcers, or a collection of sordes. If there is a scab it\r\n    ought to be fomented with warm oil or with verdigris in honey, or leek\r\n    juice or a little nitre in hydromel, and when the scabs have been\r\n    detached from the part, the ear is to be washed out with tepid water,\r\n    in order that being spontaneously separated it may be the more easily\r\n    extracted with the ear specillum (_oriculario specillo_). If there is\r\n    cerumen and it is soft, it is to be extracted with the same specillum,\r\n    or if it is hard vinegar with a little water is to be put in, and when\r\n    it is softened the ear is to be washed out and evacuated in the same\r\n    way.'\r\n\r\nIn VI. vii he says:\r\n\r\n    Ubi vero vermes orti sunt, protrahendi oriculario specillo sunt.\r\n\r\n    'Where worms have arisen they are to be extracted with an ear\r\n    specillum.'\r\n\r\nCelsus also recommends it for extracting a calculus from the meatus\r\nurinarius (VII. xxvi):\r\n\r\n    Eum, si fieri potest, oportet evellere vel oriculario specillo, vel eo\r\n    ferramento quo in sectione calculus protrahitur.\r\n\r\n    'It, if possible, is to be extracted with the specillum or the\r\n    instrument for extracting the calculus in lithotomy.'\r\n\r\nAetius (III. v) also describes removal of urethral calculus in this way.\r\n\r\nThe following passage from Paul (VI. xl) on venesection shows that in\r\ncases where the band of Antyllus could not be applied, the back of the ear\r\nscoop was pressed on the proximal end of the vein, in order to obstruct\r\nthe flow of blood and cause it to discharge by the opening made with the\r\nphlebotome:\r\n\r\n    'Tie a ligature round the neck, and when the frontal vein is properly\r\n    filled divide it with the point of a phlebotome or a scalpel. In the\r\n    same way we open the external jugulars for chronic ophthalmia,\r\n    producing a discharge of blood with the scoop of a probe' (κυαθίσκου\r\n    μήλης).\r\n\r\nAdams evidently misunderstood this passage. He translates it 'with the\r\nconcave part of a scalpel', which is meaningless. This use of the scoop\r\nwill also explain an otherwise obscure passage in Hippocrates (iii. 678).\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n    'In letting blood avoid pressing hard with the specillum (καὶ ὅταν\r\n    ἀφαιρῇς τὸ αἷμα τῇ μήλῃ μὴ κάρτα πιέζειν ὡς μὴ φλάσις προσγίνηται)\r\n    lest injury be caused.'\r\n\r\nOf the use of the ear scoop as a curette we have several instances. Thus\r\nAetius (II. iii. 81) recommends it for curetting the interior of a\r\nchalazion, and again (II. iii. 84), cf. Galen, _Comp. Med._ vii. 2. The\r\nscoop was also used for applying medicaments, especially to the eye.\r\nLiquid applications were poured from it, semi-solid were applied with the\r\nback of it (_averso specillo_). This use of the back of the scoop has\r\noften been misunderstood. The natural translation of the phrase _averso\r\nspecillo_ is 'with the probe turned away', i. e. the back of the probe.\r\nScultetus, however (_Tab._ VIII. vii), considers that it refers to a\r\nspatula probe, and says it means the probe turned end for end. Other\r\ntranslators adopt this meaning. Deneffe (_Les Oculistes Gallo Romains_, p.\r\n108), e. g., says:\r\n\r\n    Il faut entendre par _averso specillo_ la partie de la spatule\r\n    opposée à celle qui sert comme sonde, c'est-à-dire son extrémité\r\n    large, l'autre bout étant le plus souvent olivaire.\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus puts the true meaning of the phrase beyond doubt. He\r\ndirects us, after the application of caustic to haemorrhoids, to endeavour\r\nto get them to fall off by the back of an ear scoop, which part the Greeks\r\ncalled the spoon ('auriscalpio averso quam partem κυαθίσκον Graeci\r\nvocant').\r\n\r\nMarcellus copies this passage from Scribonius, but alters it. He says: 'de\r\nspecilli latitudine illinendae sunt' (xxxi. 6, p. 329).\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to give a few instances of this use of the back of the\r\nscoop in minor surgical manipulations.\r\n\r\nIn ancyloblepharon Celsus says the eyelids are to be separated with the\r\nback of the scoop.\r\n\r\nIgitur aversum specillum inserendum, diducendaeque eo palpebrae sunt (VII.\r\nvii. 6).\r\n\r\nThe back of the scoop was used as a retractor for delicate structures. In\r\nradical cure of hernia Celsus directs us to keep the bowel from prolapsing\r\nby means of it:\r\n\r\n    'For if the piece be small it is to be pushed back over the groin into\r\n    the abdomen, either with the finger or the back of the specillum.'\r\n\r\n    Nam quod parvulum est super inguen in uterum vel digito vel averso\r\n    specillo repellendum est (VII. xxi).\r\n\r\nIn the cure of varicocele it is used to replace the veins in position:\r\n\r\n    Tum venae, quaecunque protractae sunt, in ipsum inguen averso specillo\r\n    compelli debent (VII. xxii).\r\n\r\n    'Then the veins which have been drawn upon ought to be replaced with\r\n    the back of a specillum.'\r\n\r\nIn sloughing ulcer of the bladder it is used to separate the lips of the\r\nperineal wound:\r\n\r\n    Quod si antequam vesica purgata est orae se glutinarunt, dolorque et\r\n    inflammatio redierunt, vulnus digitis vel averso specillo diducendum\r\n    est (VII. xxvii).\r\n\r\n    'But, if before the bladder has become cleansed the lips unite and\r\n    pain and inflammation have returned, the wound is to be separated with\r\n    the fingers or the back of a specillum.'\r\n\r\nWe shall next proceed to discuss the other end of the ear specillum. This\r\nwas a simple probe. It had no nucleus. In his Lexicon Galen defines it\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n    Ἀπυρομήλῃ· τῇ πυρῆνα μὴ ἐχούσῃ τούτεστι τῇ μηλωτρίδι.\r\n\r\n    'Probe without olivary enlargement--that is to say \"the ear\r\n    specillum\".'\r\n\r\nNot only was its tip not expanded into a nucleus, it was actually sharp.\r\nGalen (xiv. 787) treating of fistula in ano, says in non-perforating\r\nfistulae we perforate all the sound flesh with the sharp end of an ear\r\nprobe (τῷ ὀξεῖ τῆς μηλωτίδος). The chief use of an ear probe in aural work\r\nwas to instil liquids into the ear. A large ball of wool saturated with\r\nthe liquid was wrapped round the middle of the probe, and on squeezing\r\nthis the liquid ran down and dropped into the meatus. There are many\r\nmediaeval illustrations showing the ear probe used in this fashion.\r\nSometimes, however, we read of the tip of the probe being wrapped in a\r\nsmall ball of wool, which was dipped in some sticky substance to extract\r\nforeign bodies from the ear. Galen (xii. 689) says foreign bodies may be\r\nremoved thus by a probe dipped in resin.\r\n\r\nThe ear probe seems to have been much used for probing wounds and fistulae\r\nwhen a very slender instrument was required. Galen (ii. 581), in\r\ndescribing the torcular Herophili, says:\r\n\r\n    'And in the double passage you may be able to insert some of the\r\n    slender instruments you have at hand, a double ended probe--a\r\n    'double-olivary' if you prefer to call it so--or if something smaller\r\n    be necessary even an ear specillum' (καὶ μηλωτρίδα).\r\n\r\nIn his chapter on the extraction of weapons (VI. lxxxviii) Paul says:\r\n\r\n    'If the weapon has a tang, which is ascertained by examination with an\r\n    ear probe' (ἐκ τῆς μηλωτῆς).\r\n\r\nAs a cautery it was used to destroy the roots of hairs, which had been\r\nremoved for trichiasis. Paul says:\r\n\r\n    'We may apply a double olive or an ear probe (μηλωτίδα) or some such\r\n    fine instrument heated' (VI. xiii).\r\n\r\nIn fistula in ano Paul says it may be used as a director to cut upon.\r\n\r\n    'Having introduced a sound or an ear probe (ὑποβάλλοντες κοπάριον ἢ\r\n    μηλωτίδα) through its orifice, we cut the skin over it at one\r\n    incision' (VII. lxxviii).\r\n\r\nIllustrations of two ear probes are given. What I regard as the type is\r\nseen in Pl. XV, fig. 5, which shows an instrument from the Roman Hospital\r\nat Baden. Typical specimens are not by any means common. Pl. XV, fig. 2\r\nshows another variety from my own collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Screw Probes._\r\n\r\nOn probes for wrapping round with wool we frequently raise a screw thread\r\nto enable the wool to adhere better. This useful contrivance was also\r\nknown to the ancients. I give a figure of one in my possession. It was\r\nfound in the Roman Camp at Sandy (Pl. XXI, fig. 5). It measures 9·7 cm. in\r\nlength and is 1·5 mm. thick. The screwed portion occupies 7 mm. of one\r\nend. The other end is plain. The little instrument is well adapted for\r\ntreating small cavities, such as an ear or a carious tooth by wrapping\r\nround the screw portion with wool and dipping in medicaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ear specillum for wounds._\r\n\r\nGreek, τραυματικὴ μήλη; Latin, _specillum vulnerarium_.\r\n\r\nThere was a special variety of ear specillum which was adapted for wounds.\r\nPaul (VI. lxxxviii) says:\r\n\r\n    'Stones and other missiles from slings may be removed by levers or the\r\n    scoop of an ear probe adapted for wounds' (κυαθίσκου τραυματικῆς\r\n    μηλωτίδος).\r\n\r\nThis was probably an instrument on the same principle as the ear probe, i.\r\ne. a combined probe and scoop, but on a larger scale. Possibly it may have\r\nhad a slight olivary enlargement. That it was large we learn from Galen's\r\nLexicon, where μήλην ἰσχυράν is stated to mean τὴν τραυματικὴν μήλην. It\r\nwill easily be seen that the _specillum vulnerarium_ has considerable\r\naffinity with the other class of spoon probes which I constituted, viz.\r\nthe class of cyathiscomeles--for these had a scoop at one end--and this\r\nbeing specially intended for wounds most likely had a certain amount of\r\nolivary enlargement at its tip, but smaller than the olive of a\r\ncyathiscomele, which was too large for ordinary wounds. The typical ear\r\nspecilla and the typical cyathiscomeles both form well defined groups, but\r\nbetween these innumerable gradations occur among the specimens extant. For\r\npractical purposes it is convenient to class all these intermediate forms\r\nas _specilla vulneraria_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Handled Needles._\r\n\r\nIn the find of the oculist Severus were no less than nine handles for\r\nneedles. Of these, six were merely cylinders of bronze, expanded slightly\r\nat one end and perforated at the other with a small hole for a needle.\r\nThey were from 72 to 40 mm. long and 7 to 5 mm. in diameter. Two were\r\nhexagonal, four were round (Pl. XXI, figs. 2, 4, Pl. XVI, figs. 3, 4, 5,\r\n6). Two others had the same holes for needles at one end, but at the other\r\nthey were pierced with a slot, 10 mm. deep, for the insertion of a knife\r\nblade. One was 60 x 7 mm., the other 53 x 5 mm. (Pl. II, figs. 1, 2).\r\nAnother, perforated at one end as before, carried at the other an\r\nolive-pointed probe. It was 8 cm. in length, and of this 3·5 cm. consisted\r\nof a hexagonal handle 3·5 cm. in diameter. The remainder was cylindrical,\r\nand it terminated in a probe point with a slight olivary enlargement (Pl.\r\nXVI, fig. 2). In all cases the needles had evidently been made of steel\r\nand had entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe have many allusions to the use of handled needles in ophthalmic work.\r\nIn describing the couching of cataract Celsus says:\r\n\r\n    Tum acus admovenda est, acuta ut foret sed non nimium tenuis (VII.\r\n    vii).\r\n\r\n    'Then a needle is to be applied, sharp so as to penetrate, but not too\r\n    fine.'\r\n\r\nSextus Platonicus (_Med. ex Animalibus_) says that cataract is depressed\r\nwith a specillum.\r\n\r\nA full description of the operation is given by Paul:\r\n\r\n    'We measure off a nucleus' breadth (ὅσον πυρηνομήλης) from the part\r\n    called the iris and in the direction of the outer canthus, then mark\r\n    with the olivary end of the couching needle (πυρῆνι παρακεντηρίου) the\r\n    place to be perforated. If it is in the left eye, we work with the\r\n    right hand, and vice versa. Bringing round the pointed end of the\r\n    perforator, which is round at the tip (καὶ ἀναστρέψαντες τὴν ἀκμὴν\r\n    στρογγύλην κατὰ τὸ πέρας ὑπάρχουσαν τοῦ κεντηρίου), we push it firmly\r\n    through at the part which was marked out until we come to an empty\r\n    space. The depth of the perforation should be as great as the distance\r\n    of the cornea from the iris. Then raising the needle to the apex of\r\n    the cataract (the bronze of it is plainly visible through the\r\n    transparent part of the cornea) we depress the cataract to the\r\n    underlying parts. After the couching of the cataract we gently extract\r\n    the needle with a rotatory movement' (VI. xxi).\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from Paul's vivid description that the couching instrument\r\nconsisted of a handle with a nucleus at one end, to measure off the spot\r\nat which to perforate, and a needle at the other. We saw that the outfit\r\nof the oculist Severus contained one such instrument (Pl. XVI, fig. 2).\r\nThe same combination is not infrequently met with. In the Museum at Aarau\r\nthere are four from the station at Vindonissa. I have one in my collection\r\nwhich is interesting as showing a screw thread for fitting on a cover to\r\nprotect the needle (Pl. XVI, fig. 7). It was found in Bedfordshire. It\r\nreminds one very strongly of the couching needle figured by Paré. Other\r\nhandled needles were used in eye work as cauteries. Of trichiasis Celsus\r\nsays (VII. vii):\r\n\r\n    Si pili nati sunt qui non debuerunt, tenuis acus ferrea ad\r\n    similitudinem spathae lata in ignem coniicienda est: deinde candens,\r\n    sublata palpebra sic ut eius perniciosi pili in conspectum curantis\r\n    veniant, sub ipsis pilorum radicibus ab angulo immittenda est ut ea\r\n    tertiam partem palpebrae transsuat; deinde iterum, tertioque usque ad\r\n    alterum angulum; quo fit ut omnes pilorum radices adustae emoriantur.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ophthalmic Probe._\r\n\r\nGreek, ὀφθαλμικὴ μήλη.\r\n\r\nIn Hippocrates (ii. 100) we find an ophthalmic probe mentioned.\r\n\r\n    Λεπίδος μῆλαι τρεῖς τῷ πλατεῖ καὶ ἀλήτου σητανίου κόλλης, πάντα ταῦτα\r\n    λεῖα τρίψας, καταπότια ποιήσας δίδου.\r\n\r\n    'Of squama aeris three times the full of a specillum and [as much] of\r\n    the gluten of wheat. Levigate all up fine, form into pills and\r\n    administer.'\r\n\r\nGalen in his Lexicon explains that μῆλαι τρεῖς τῷ πλατεῖ means τῷ κυαθίσκῳ\r\nὀφθαλμικῆς μήλης. This is the only mention which we have of a special\r\nophthalmic probe with scoop. In applying medicaments to the eye with a\r\nprobe whenever any variety of probe is mentioned it is always the ear\r\nspecillum which is named. It seems most likely that either the ear\r\nspecillum or some variety of it is referred to here. It may have had a\r\nnucleus for applying medicaments at one end and a scoop at the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rasping Specillum._\r\n\r\nGreek, βλεφαρόξυστον; Latin, _specillum asperatum_ (Celsus).\r\n\r\nA special burred specillum, for curetting the granular lids so common as a\r\nresult of the ophthalmia which is endemic in most Eastern countries, and\r\nwhich was rampant in ancient Greece and Rome, is described by Celsus and\r\nalso by Paul. Celsus says:\r\n\r\n    In hoc genere valetudinis quidam crassas durasque palpebras et\r\n    ficulneo folio, et asperato specillo, et interdum scalpello eradunt,\r\n    versasque quotidie medicamentis suffricant (VI. vi).\r\n\r\nPaul says:\r\n\r\n    'But if the granulation be hard and yield to none of these things we\r\n    must evert the eyelid, and rub it down with pumice stone, or the\r\n    shell of the cuttlefish, or fig-leaves, or the surgical instrument\r\n    called blepharoxyston' (διὰ τοῦ βλεφαροξύστου καλουμένου, III. xxii).\r\n\r\nHeister (vol. i. tab. xvi. p. 591) figures the blepharoxyston as a\r\nspoon-shaped instrument burred on the convex side. There is in the Orfila\r\nMuseum, Paris, an instrument of similar form. It consists of a handle with\r\nan olivary point at one end, and at the other a plate with transverse\r\nridges. This agrees well enough with what we know of the classical\r\ninstrument. It was found in Herculaneum. (Pl. XVI, fig. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Styli and Styloid Specilla._\r\n\r\nGreek, γράφιον, γραφεῖον, γραφίς; Latin, _stylus_ or _stilus_.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of deciding as to whether any particular instrument is a\r\nsurgical or a domestic article is often well illustrated by styloid\r\ninstruments. In the British Museum several types of instrument will be\r\nfound classed among surgical instruments, and a series of exactly similar\r\narticles will be found repeated among the styli used for inscribing and\r\nerasing characters on wax tablets. As even the writing stylus was\r\noccasionally used for surgical manipulations we are justified in looking\r\non all styloid instruments as potentially implements of minor surgery. The\r\nclaims of any doubtful instrument to be considered as once having been one\r\nof a surgeon's tools must be decided on such grounds as the circumstances\r\nof its discovery.\r\n\r\nGalen (xii. 865) says teeth may be extracted with the stylus (γραφείῳ\r\nἀνάλαβε) or with the finger.\r\n\r\nHippocrates (i. 46) thus describes the method of extraction of the\r\nsecundines:\r\n\r\n    'Place the patient on the obstetric chair and, leaving the cord uncut,\r\n    place the child on two bladders filled with water and puncture each of\r\n    the bladders with a stylus (γραφίῳ) so that the water may slowly flow\r\n    away.'\r\n\r\nThe writing stylus, then, from the fact of its being at hand and of\r\nsuitable shape was occasionally, perhaps often, used as a surgical\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nI give a figure of a stylus in silver, beautifully oxidized, which was\r\nfound at York while making excavations there in constructing the railway\r\n(Pl. XVII, fig. 3).\r\n\r\nPl. XVII, fig. 6 shows an instrument which is figured by Vulpes (op. cit.)\r\nas a specillum. Personally, I think its highly ornamented form shows that\r\nit is rather a domestic article, but, as no information is available as to\r\nthe surroundings among which it was found, we can only say that its shape\r\nfits it equally well either for writing or minor surgical manipulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grooved Director._\r\n\r\nAlthough we have no actual description of a grooved director, we have many\r\nmanipulations described in which such an instrument would be used\r\nnowadays. For example, in describing the treatment of fistulae Celsus\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    In has demisso specillo ad ultimum eius caput incidi cutis debet (VII.\r\n    iv).\r\n\r\n    'A director being inserted into them down to their termination the\r\n    skin ought to be incised.'\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find that we have at least one grooved director\r\nextant to prove that this instrument was known to the Romans. It is in the\r\nSection of Surgical Antiquities of the Musée de Cinquantenaire, Brussels,\r\nand it was discovered, along with several other surgical instruments, in a\r\nsurgeon's case of the usual cylindrical form.\r\n\r\nIt is 15 cm. long, 2 mm. in diameter. A deep groove runs for 6 cm. from\r\none end. The other end terminates in a small button. It is of silver, as\r\nalso were the other contents of the case. It is possible that grooved\r\nspecilla may have been in quite common use, but may have been made of wood\r\nor tin, and have therefore not survived; because we learn from Galen's\r\nManual of Dissection that probes which were used as directors in\r\ndissecting work were generally of wood, such as boxwood, so that they\r\nmight not chip the scalpel (ii. 711).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Surgical Needle (three cornered)._\r\n\r\nBefore discussing the eyed probes it will be well to clear the way by\r\ndisposing of the needles, and of these, as the most easily defined class,\r\nit will be best to take the surgical needles first. We have innumerable\r\nreferences to the surgical needle though we have no actual description of\r\nit. There must have been many different sizes of it, for the manipulations\r\nvary greatly in magnitude. I shall content myself with giving two\r\nquotations describing respectively one of the largest and one of the\r\nsmallest of these. Both passages are from Celsus. He thus describes the\r\noperation of suturing the abdominal parietes:\r\n\r\n    Sutura autem neque summae cutis neque interioris membranae per se\r\n    satis proficit; sed utriusque: et quidem duobus linis iniicienda est,\r\n    spissior quam alibi; quia et rumpi facilius motu ventris potest, et\r\n    non aeque magnis inflammationibus pars ea exposita est. Igitur in duas\r\n    acus fila coniicienda, eaeque duabus manibus tenendae; et prius\r\n    interiori membranae sutura, iniicienda est sic ut sinistra manus in\r\n    dexteriore ora, dextra in sinisteriore a principio vulneris orsa, ab\r\n    interiore parte in exteriorem acum immittat: quo fit ut ab intestinis\r\n    ea pars semper acuum sit quae retusa est. Semel utraque parte\r\n    traiecta, permutandae acus inter manus sunt, ut ea sit in dextra quae\r\n    fuit in sinistra, ea veniat in sinistram quam dextra continuit:\r\n    iterumque eodem modo per oras immittendae sunt: atque ita tertio et\r\n    quarto, deincepsque permutatis inter manus acubus plaga includenda.\r\n    Post haec, eadem fila eaedemque acus ad cutem transferendae similique\r\n    ratione ei quoque parti sutura iniicienda; semper ab interiore parte\r\n    acubus venientibus, semper inter manus traiectis: dein glutinantia\r\n    iniicienda (VII. xvi).\r\n\r\nIn the next case, where Celsus describes the treatment of staphyloma of\r\nthe cornea, a very small needle must have been used:\r\n\r\n    Haec fere circa oculum in angulis palpebrisque incidere consuerunt. In\r\n    ipso autem oculo nonnunquam summa attolitur tunica, sive ruptis intus\r\n    membranis aliquibus sive laxatis; et similis figura acino fit: unde id\r\n    σταφύλωμα Graeci vocant. Curatio duplex est: altera, ad ipsas radices\r\n    per mediam transsuere acu duo lina ducente; deinde alterius lini duo\r\n    capita ex superiore parte, alterius ex inferiore adstringere inter se;\r\n    quae paulatim secando id excidunt: altera in summa parte eius ad\r\n    lenticulae magnitudinem excidere (VII. vii).\r\n\r\nNow for suturing tissues, and more especially tissues of such toughness\r\nand thickness as the abdominal parietes, a round needle is absolutely of\r\nno use. A surgical needle not only requires to have cutting edges, as our\r\nthree-cornered needles have, but these edges need to be in good condition\r\nto work well. Three-cornered surgical needles were in use from very early\r\ntimes. They are fully described in the Vedas of the Hindoos (Wise, _Hindoo\r\nSystem of Medicine_, p. 171). A few three-cornered needles of Roman origin\r\nhave been found, although they are rare. Those which exist are of bronze.\r\nProbably the majority were of steel, and of these none have survived. I\r\ngive a photograph of a three-cornered needle from my collection (Pl. XVII,\r\nfig. 4). It is imperfect at the point. It measures 7·2 cm. in length, and\r\nthe sides are each 2 mm. in breadth. It is important to emphasize the fact\r\nthat only needles with cutting edges are to be looked on as surgical,\r\nbecause it is not unusual to find needles, which are round and of large\r\ncalibre, described as surgical, although they are quite unfitted for\r\nsurgical work. Such is the one figured by Vulpes (op. cit.).\r\n\r\nNeedles of this kind are sometimes found, as this one was, among surgical\r\ninstruments. But they are not surgical needles in the sense that they are\r\nintended for suturing tissues. They are for fixing bandages. I shall\r\ndescribe them in the next section.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Round Needles and Bodkins._\r\n\r\nHippocrates tells us that bandages for fixing dressings and splints on a\r\nfractured limb ought to be finished off by stitching with a thread (iii.\r\n55), and Celsus repeats the advice:\r\n\r\n    Hieme saepius fascia circumire debet: aestate quoties necesse est.\r\n    Tum extrema pars eius inferioribus acu assuenda est; nam nodus vulnus\r\n    laedit, nisi tamen longe est (V. xxvi).\r\n\r\nThe round sewing needle was therefore part of the recognized outfit of the\r\nsurgeon, and numbers have been found associated with surgical instruments.\r\nApart from this association with other instruments it is quite impossible\r\nto distinguish them from domestic needles. The same may be said of\r\nbodkins, as these too occur in surgical finds, and are also quite\r\nindistinguishable from the domestic articles for embroidering. Pl. XVII,\r\nfig. 2 shows a bronze needle from Roman London. A similar one from\r\nPompeii, now in the Naples Museum, is given by Vulpes as a surgical\r\nneedle, owing to the fact that it was found along with surgical\r\ninstruments; but it is evident that it is only a needle for sewing\r\nbandages, &c.\r\n\r\nOther types of needles and bodkins are found in bronze, but many also are\r\nof bone and ivory. Even the latter are quite serviceable, and in spite of\r\ntheir being comparatively thick will stitch compact cloth easily. An ivory\r\nneedle from Roman London is shown in Pl. XVII, fig. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eyed Probes._\r\n\r\nWe have frequent references to eyed probes, and we also possess a\r\nconsiderable number of different types. In dealing with the dipyrene I\r\nquoted a passage to show that it sometimes carried an eye in one of its\r\nolives. Hippocrates refers to an eyed probe of tin. In treating of fistula\r\nhe directs us to take a rod of tin having one end pierced with an eye\r\n(μήλην κασσιτερίνην ἐπ' ἄκρου τετρημένην), and having put one end of a\r\ntwisted piece of lint through the eye put the probe into the fistula, get\r\nthe end of the specillum, bend it and hold the thread with the finger and\r\nwithdraw the ends. Paul quotes this passage (VI. lxxvii), but alters the\r\nwording slightly:\r\n\r\n    'Hippocrates directs us to pass a thread consisting of five pieces\r\n    through the fistula by means of an eyed probe or a dipyrene' (διὰ\r\n    τετρημένου κοπαρίου ἢ διπυρήνου).\r\n\r\nAgain in polypus naris (ii. 243) Hippocrates directs us to cut a sponge to\r\nthe shape of a ball and tie the ball round with thread, and make it hard\r\nand of such a size as to fill the nose. To the sponge tie a thread of four\r\npieces, each a cubit long, and make one thread of them. Put the end\r\nthrough a fine tin rod having an eye at the end. Push the rod bent at an\r\nacute angle into the mouth, and catch the end of the thread under the\r\npalate and pull it through, propping it with another hoof-like probe, and\r\nextract the polypus. Pl. XVII, fig. 1 shows an eyed probe from the Baden\r\nHospital. Its shape is exactly the same as a lead probe figured by Paré\r\nfor the insertion of the apolinose.\r\n\r\nAn example of a scoop at one end and an eyed probe at the other was found\r\nat Augst, and is now in the Museum at Basle (Brunner, loc. cit., Taf. I,\r\nfig. 14). It is 16 cm. long, of which the spoon, slightly defective at its\r\ntip, occupies 3 cm. About 2 cm. from its tip, which is fine, there is an\r\nelongated eye, 5 mm. in length.\r\n\r\nVarious other combinations are met with.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ligula type of Specillum._\r\n\r\nGreek, κυαθίσκος; Latin, _ligula_.\r\n\r\nLigulae are found in enormous numbers and in very great variety. They are\r\ntoilet articles for extracting from tubes and boxes ointment, the various\r\nsalves, balsams, and powders which entered into the mysteries of the Roman\r\nlady's toilet. The ligula is therefore not strictly speaking a surgical\r\ninstrument, but as it was used by the laity, and no doubt also by\r\nphysicians, for making applications to affected as well as to unaffected\r\nparts, and as it is often found associated with surgical instruments, it\r\nis advisable to bring it within the scope of this investigation. It is\r\nalso convenient to do so, because some varieties approach so closely in\r\nform to the true surgical specilla that it is often difficult to decide\r\nwhich class to place a particular specimen in. In doubtful cases it is\r\nwell to remember that the specillum is most usually a combination of two\r\ninstruments on one shaft. Brunner (loc. cit.) figures a number of ligulae\r\nfrom the Swiss museums. These he names specilla oricularia, although\r\nadmitting that they are only domestic articles. I have shown, however,\r\nthat the specillum oricularium is a well-defined combination of scoop and\r\nprobe.\r\n\r\nPlate XVIII shows a variety of ligulae from various sources, some simple,\r\nsome combined instruments. Figs. 4, 5, 8 are most typical forms. Some of\r\nthis simple type are two feet in length. They are often overlaid with\r\ngold. Fig. 7 shows a ligula which has so been treated. It carries a small\r\nfork on which to poise a pellet of semi-solid medicament.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spoons for measuring, preparing, and pouring medicaments._\r\n\r\nA type of spoon not uncommonly met with has a round bowl about 2 cm. in\r\ndiameter, and a handle of about 10 cm. long. Usually they are of bronze;\r\nbut occasionally they are of silver, and a considerable number in bone\r\nwere found in the Roman Hospital at Baden. They are for measuring\r\nmedicaments, heating them, and removing them from unguentaria, &c. They\r\nare often found alongside the glass unguentaria which contained the\r\nsalves. They were also used for religious purposes.\r\n\r\nSimilar spoons with pointed handles are common in finds of domestic\r\narticles. The sharp end is for extracting shellfish, &c. A larger variety\r\nof the unguent spoon has a spout to assist in pouring the contents. This\r\nvariety is rather rare.\r\n\r\nPl. XIX, fig. 4 is from the British Museum. The bowl is 2.5 cm. in\r\ndiameter and the handle is 15 cm. long. The handle is round, and it has a\r\nsmall ringed ornamentation at its end and one close to the bowl. The\r\nbottom has been thinned out with heat, and there is a small perforation\r\nvisible in it. A similar spoon was found in the grave of the Paris\r\nsurgeon. Traces of medicament remain on it. This type is probably intended\r\nfor warming salves and pouring them into the eye and other affected parts.\r\nAnother variety is seen in Pl. XIX, fig. 1. This specimen is in the\r\nNaples Museum, and was found along with the spatula shown in Pl. XIX, fig.\r\n2. The handles of each are of bronze, the scoop and spatula parts are of\r\nsilver. Vulpes describes these as a lancet for drawing blood and a spoon\r\nfor collecting and examining the same. It is impossible to regard an\r\ninstrument of silver as a cutting instrument. These are for mixing and\r\nspreading medicaments. A large spoon of a peculiar shape from the Naples\r\nMuseum is seen in Pl. XIX, fig. 3. It is of silver. The handle, which is\r\nof ivory, is ornamented with spiral carving, and the end bears a ram's\r\nhead. Another interesting little shovel from the same museum is of bronze,\r\nand carries the head of Minerva Medica on the end of the handle (Pl. XX,\r\nfig. 5). We may here include the large double spatulae of the type shown\r\nin Pl. XX, fig. 1, which represents a specimen from Naples. A similar one\r\nwas found in the outfit of the Paris surgeon, and Scultetus shows\r\nprecisely similar instruments in use in his time for applying the\r\nstiffening to the bandages, &c. for setting fractures. The Romans probably\r\nused theirs for a similar purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tongue Depressor._\r\n\r\nGreek, γλωσσοκάτοχος.\r\n\r\nTo open a quinsy Aetius says (II. iv. 45):\r\n\r\n    'If the patient is adult, seat him and make him open his mouth, and\r\n    depress the tongue with a spathomele, or a tongue depressor, and open\r\n    the abscess with a probe or a needle knife.'\r\n\r\nIn excision of the tonsil Paul (VI. xxx) bids us seat the patient in the\r\nsun and depress the tongue with a tongue depressor (γλωσσοκατόχῳ).\r\n\r\nPl. XX, fig. 6 shows one of six bronze tongue depressors, burnished like\r\nsmall mirrors, from the Lépine collection (Védrènes, _Celse_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Uterine Sound._\r\n\r\nThe uterine sound is frequently mentioned by Hippocrates for correcting\r\nmalpositions of the uterus, and dilating and applying medicaments to the\r\ninterior of the cervix. After falling into disuse in the middle ages it\r\nwas reintroduced by Sir J. Y. Simpson, only to disappear once more almost\r\nentirely from sight.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to Galen's statement that the non-pregnant os is\r\nof such a size that it will just admit an olive-pointed probe (p. 54).\r\n\r\nHippocrates (ii. 836) directs us to treat hysteria by dilating the cervix,\r\nfirst with an ointment probe and then with the finger.\r\n\r\n    Καὶ ὑπάλειπτρον καθιέναι καὶ ἀναστομοῦν καὶ τῷ γε δακτύλῳ ὡσαύτως\r\n    λειοῦν.\r\n\r\nSoranus (II. x) describes plugging for uterine haemorrhage by means of the\r\nsound:\r\n\r\n    Καὶ τρυφερὸν ἔριον ἑνί τινι τῶν εἰρημένων χυλῶν διάβροχον διὰ δακτύλου\r\n    ἢ μήλης παρεντιθέσθω τῷ στόματι τῆς ὑστέρας. καὶ πολὺ μᾶλλον ἐντεῦθεν\r\n    τῆς αἱμορραγίας ὑπαρχούσης.\r\n\r\nHippocrates (iii. 34) alludes to applying medicament to the internal os\r\nwith the sound:\r\n\r\n    'Grind the pulp of colocynth, &c., and rub it up with honey and smear\r\n    it on the sound (περὶ μήλην) making the consistence such that it can\r\n    enter the os and always be pushed beyond until it has penetrated to\r\n    the interior of the uterus. When the medicament has liquefied extract\r\n    the sound, and again in the same way apply elaterium.'\r\n\r\nIf pus collect in the uterus post partum, or after abortion or from any\r\nother cause, it is good practice to pass a sound (μήλην ὑπαλειπτρίδα) into\r\nthe cervix (i. 471). In another place we are directed to draw off gas in\r\nthe uterus by fomenting the whole body and the uterus with vinegar and\r\nwater, warmed specilla being afterwards inserted (μήλας διαπύρους\r\nἐμβάλλοντα).\r\n\r\nAgain we find the sound applied to correct malposition of the uterus (iii.\r\n140):\r\n\r\n    'When the semen is extruded on the third day and the woman\r\n    consequently fails to conceive, take small soft feathers and tie them\r\n    together, and foment the uterus as we do the eyes. Make the feathers\r\n    even at the tips and tie the ends with a very fine thread, and anoint\r\n    with much rosaceum. Also place the patient on her back on a couch, and\r\n    place a pillow under the loins, and, the woman's thighs being extended\r\n    and separated, insert a sound and turn it to this side and that till\r\n    it project.'\r\n\r\nIn all these cases there is no special instrument designated as being used\r\nfor a uterine sound, only the spathomele (ὑπάλειπτρον) and the olivary\r\nprobe named. With both of these we have met before. However, I have\r\nthought it of historical interest to cast these passages together. It will\r\nalso clear the way for the discussion of other instruments, whose use is\r\nentirely reserved for the purpose of dilation of the cervix.\r\n\r\nA more questionable use of the sound is referred to by many authors.\r\nDuring the Empire the death of the foetus was frequently procured both by\r\nabortifacients and instruments. Frequent references to the use of drugs\r\nfor this purpose may be found in the lay writers such as Juvenal and\r\nSuetonius (_Domitian_), and the later medical authors do not hesitate to\r\ndescribe the composition of abortifacient pessaries. It will be remembered\r\nthat the Hippocratic oath specially forbids this practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Uterine Dilators--Solid, graduated wooden._\r\n\r\nGreek, διαστομωτρίς, μήλην τὴν διαστέλλουσαν--τὸν διαστολέα (Galen,\r\n_Lexicon_).\r\n\r\nBesides the ordinary probes, which we have just seen that Hippocrates used\r\noccasionally for dilating the os, we have frequent mention made of a\r\nspecial variety of dilators which, although they are called μήλη by\r\nHippocrates, are not, strictly speaking, probes or sounds, but a graduated\r\nset of dilators of wood, tin, or lead. They correspond, in fact, to our\r\nHegar's dilators.\r\n\r\nHippocrates describes these dilators (ii. 799). The patient is to have\r\nfumigations for five or six days till the cervix is softened. After these\r\nfumigations, dilators (προσθέτων) made of pieces of very smooth slipping\r\npinewood are to be introduced into the cervix. There were six of these.\r\nEach was six finger breadths (4·2 in.) in length. They ended in a point,\r\nand each succeeding rod was larger than the preceding one; the largest\r\nbeing of the diameter and shape of the index finger, being smaller at one\r\nextremity than the other. They should be as round as possible and with no\r\nsplinters. Before being introduced they were smeared with oil. First the\r\npoint was gradually introduced by rotating the dilator and pushing it\r\nsimultaneously till it entered for a distance of four finger breadths (2·8\r\nin.). After the first rod was introduced it was withdrawn and replaced by\r\na larger one. During the after treatment a leaden tube filled with mutton\r\nfat was left in the uterus at night, while through the day one of the pine\r\ndilators was used. Pl. XX, fig. 2 shows a specimen from Pompeii, which\r\nVédrènes regards as a uterine dilator. It is hollow, and is ornamented to\r\nresemble the head and body of a snake.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Metal Dilators mounted on handles of wood._\r\n\r\nHippocrates (i. 473) mentions a variety of dilator made of tin or lead,\r\nand hollow behind for mounting on a wooden handle:\r\n\r\n    'After douching and fumigation, dilate, and, if necessary, straighten\r\n    the cervix with a dilator of tin or lead (τῇ μήλῃ τῇ κασσιτερίνῃ ἢ\r\n    μολυβδαίνῃ), beginning with a fine one, and then a thicker if it be\r\n    admitted, until it seems to be in proper position. Dip the dilators in\r\n    some emollient. The dilators are to be made hollow behind, and fitted\r\n    round rather long pieces of wood and thus used.'\r\n\r\nThis evidently refers to a portable set of dilators, each capable of\r\nfitting on a common handle, like Fritsch's, Peaslee's, or Lawson Tait's of\r\nmodern times.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bifurcated Probe._\r\n\r\nGreek, μήλη δικροῦς, χηλή.\r\n\r\nIn treating of polypus naris Hippocrates directs us to take a sponge and\r\ntie it into a hard ball, and attach a four ply thread to it. Next to pass\r\nthe end of this thread by means of an eyed probe of tin till it is caught\r\nat the back of the mouth, and drawing it out of the mouth to place a\r\nbifurcated probe under the palate, and using this as a fulcrum pull until\r\nthe polypus is extracted (_De Morbis_, ii. 243: ἔπειτα χηλὴν ὑποθεὶς ὑπὸ\r\nτὸν γαργαρεῶνα ἀντερείδων ἕλκειν ἔστ' ἂν ἐξειρύσῃς τὸν πώλυπον). In\r\nGalen's _Lexicon_ we find χηλή explained as meaning a notched probe, split\r\nlike a hoof at the point (μήλην δικροῦν, κατὰ τὸ ἀκρὸν ἐκτετμημένην\r\nἐμφερῶς χηλῇ). And again under the heading δικροῦν he gives τὸ οἷον\r\nδίκρανον, ὅπερ καὶ δισχιδὲς ὀνομάζουσι τὸ δὲ αὐτὸ καὶ δηλοῖ, 'what they\r\ncall cloven and also cleft.' The same word also means the notch of an\r\narrow. In _De Morbis_ (ii. 245), Hippocrates describes another method of\r\nextracting polypus with the same instrument. Taking a piece of stringy gut\r\n(χορδήν) and making a loop on it pass the end through the loop, thus\r\nmaking a second larger one, i. e. a noose. Pass the end of the gut through\r\nthe nose into the mouth with a tin probe. Pull the loop into the nose and\r\nadjust it round the polypus with a notched probe (μήλῃ τῇ ἐντετμημένῃ),\r\nand when this is done pull on the gut, using the notched probe as a\r\nfulcrum.\r\n\r\nThere must have been one form of bifurcated probe with a rounded end\r\nbearing a notch like an arrow. This is the only form of cleft probe which\r\nit would be safe to use in the back of the throat in the manner described\r\nby Hippocrates. We know, however, of other forms of bifurcated probes.\r\nCelsus describes a bifurcated retractor used for the extraction of weapons\r\nburied in the flesh:\r\n\r\n    Saepius itaque ab altera parte quam ex qua venit recipienda est;\r\n    praecipueque quia fere spiculis cingitur; quae magis laniant si\r\n    retrorsus quam si contra eximatur. Sed inde aperta via caro diduci\r\n    debet ferramento facto ad similitudinem Graecae litterae Y; deinde,\r\n    ubi apparuit mucro, si arundo inhaeret propellenda est donec ab altera\r\n    parte apprehendi et extrahi possit (VII. v).\r\n\r\nVariant readings are V and Λ. The Aldine edition has ψ. The reading I have\r\nadopted is Daremberg's; but whichever is correct matters little, as all\r\nindicate a bifurcated instrument, except the Aldine, which would indicate\r\na three-pronged one. There are several bifurcated specilla in the British\r\nMuseum (Pl. XXII). One in the Orfila Museum, Paris, of slender\r\nconstruction, carries a hook at the other end. It is from Herculaneum (Pl.\r\nXXI, fig. 1). A plain variety is shown in Pl. XXI, fig. 6. The specimen\r\nshown in Pl. XXI, fig. 3 is interesting as showing a possible fallacy. It\r\nhas considerable affinity to the Roman netting-needle, and may not be a\r\nprobe at all. The typical netting-needle has, however, blunt points, and\r\nthe planes in which the forks lie are at right angles to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blunt Dissectors._\r\n\r\nIn his chapter on Angiology (or Division of the Temporal Blood Vessels)\r\nfor headache and ophthalmia (VI. v), Paul mentions the use of dissectors:\r\n\r\n    'Having therefore first shaven the hairs of the temples we make an\r\n    examination by palpation, applying warm fomentations or even a fillet\r\n    round the neck, and mapping out the vessels with ink as they become\r\n    apparent, we stretch the skin to either side with the fingers of our\r\n    own left hand and those of an assistant, and make a superficial\r\n    incision along the vessel. Then cutting down and retracting with hooks\r\n    and exposing the vessel with dissectors (δι' ἐξυμενιστήρων) we must\r\n    raise it up completely isolated. If it be small, having stretched it\r\n    and applied torsion we may divide it through in such a way as to\r\n    remove a piece of it at one stroke.'\r\n\r\nThe typical scalpel handle ends in a leaf-shaped dissector, and Celsus\r\nalways describes blunt dissection as being performed with the manubriolus\r\nof the scalpel. We have, however, a few dissecting manubrioli as separate\r\ninstruments not designed to carry scalpel blades. Three were found\r\ntogether in the grave of the surgeon of Paris. There are also two in the\r\nmuseum of St-Germain-en-Laye, and one in the Museum at Mainz. We may take\r\nas types two from the find of the oculist Severus in the\r\nSt-Germain-en-Laye Museum (Pl. XX, figs. 3, 4). They consist of elongated\r\nleaf-shaped blades carried on hexagonal handles, and are exactly similar\r\nin appearance to a scalpel handle, except that they do not carry a slot\r\nfor the insertion of a blade.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Curved Dissectors._\r\n\r\nGreek, ὑδροκηλικὸν κοπάριον.\r\n\r\nOn the cure of hydrocele Paul (VI. lxii) says:\r\n\r\n    'When the fluid is in the tunica vaginalis we make the incision where\r\n    the apex of the tunica makes its appearance, and, separating the lips\r\n    of the incision with a hook, and having dissected off the fascia with\r\n    the hydrocele specillum and the scalpel (ἐξυμενίσαντες τῷ τε\r\n    ὑδροκηλικῷ κοπάριω καὶ τῷ σμιλίῳ), we divide it through the middle\r\n    with a lancet.'\r\n\r\nTreating of the excision of varices (VI. lxxxii) he says:\r\n\r\n    'Having separated the lips of the wound with hooks, and dissected away\r\n    the fascia with curved hydrocele specilla, and laid bare the vein and\r\n    freed it all round' (ὑδροκηλικοῖς ἐπικαμπέσι κοπαρίοις).\r\n\r\nA curved dissector from the find of the oculist Severus, now in the Museum\r\nof St-Germain-en-Laye, has a neatly ornamented handle with a small hook at\r\none end, and at the other it curves first backward and then forward to\r\njoin a small leaf-shaped dissector 3 cm. long and 1 cm. in its greatest\r\nbreadth (Pl. XXIII, fig. 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sharp Hooks._\r\n\r\nGreek, ἄγκιστρον, ἀγκυρομήλη; Latin, _hamus_, _hamulus acutus_.\r\n\r\nHooks blunt and sharp are frequently mentioned in both Greek and Latin\r\nliterature, and served the same purposes as we use them for; the blunt for\r\ndissecting and raising blood-vessels like the modern aneurism needle, the\r\nsharp for seizing and raising small pieces of tissue for excision, and for\r\nfixing and retracting the edges of wounds. We are fortunate also in\r\npossessing many fine specimens of both sharp and blunt hooks in museums,\r\n&c. In the Naples Museum alone there are upwards of forty examples of\r\nhooks. Of pterygium Celsus says:\r\n\r\n    Tum idem medicus hamulum acutum, paulum mucrone intus recurvato,\r\n    subiicere extremo ungui debet eumque infigere; atque eam quoque\r\n    palpebram tradere alteri; ipse, hamulo apprehenso, levare unguem\r\n    eumque acu traiicere linum trahente (VII. vii).\r\n\r\nAetius also mentions this use of the sharp hook:\r\n\r\n    'And, transfixing the pterygium with a hook (καὶ ἀγκίστρῳ\r\n    καταπείροντες περὶ τὰ μέσα τὸ πτερύγιον), we gently make traction on\r\n    it' (_Tet._ II. iii. 60).\r\n\r\nPaul also says:\r\n\r\n    'Seizing the pterygium with a hook with a small curve, (ἀγκίστρῳ\r\n    μικροκαμπεῖ ἀναδειξάμενοι) we stretch it' (VI. xviii).\r\n\r\nThe method of excision of the tonsil described by Celsus, Aetius, and Paul\r\nis to bring the tonsil into view by dragging on it with a sharp hook and\r\nthen amputating it. Thus Paul says:\r\n\r\n    'Wherefore seating the person in the light of the sun, and, directing\r\n    him to open his mouth, while one assistant holds his head and another\r\n    presses down the tongue to the lower jaw with a tongue depressor we\r\n    take a hook (ἄγκιστρον) and transfix the tonsil with it and draw it\r\n    outwards as much as we can without drawing the capsule along with it,\r\n    and then we cut it out by the root with the tonsil knife suited to\r\n    that hand' (VI. xxx).\r\n\r\nIn contraction of the vulva, Paul says:\r\n\r\n    'Having transfixed the connecting body, whether flesh or membrane,\r\n    with hooks, we stretch it and divide it with the fistula knife' (VI.\r\n    lxxii).\r\n\r\nSimilarly Celsus (VII. xxviii) says:\r\n\r\n    At si caro increvit, necessaria est recta linea patefacere; tum ab\r\n    ora, vel vulsella vel hamo apprehensa, tamquam habenulam excidere.\r\n\r\nIn dissection, many of the manipulations which we perform with the\r\ndissecting forceps were performed by the ancients with sharp hooks. Pl.\r\nXXIV, figs. 1-5 represent specimens from various sources; some simple,\r\nothers combined with another implement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blunt Hooks._\r\n\r\nGreek, τυφλάγκιστρον; Latin, _hamus retusus_.\r\n\r\nAetius (_Tet._ III. i. 13) says:\r\n\r\n    'Whatever adhesions there are of the lower border of the lids to the\r\n    tunics of the eye, we must put them on the stretch with a blunt hook\r\n    (τυφλαγκίστρῳ) and with a pterygotome free the adhesion.'\r\n\r\nIn Aetius (_Tet._ II. iii) we see the blunt hook used in the same way as\r\nwe use an aneurism needle, except that the ligature is not introduced with\r\nit, but with another needle. He says we transfix the lips of the incisions\r\nwith two hooks and gradually dissecting with the scalpel we free the\r\nvessel from the underlying fascia. Then with a blunt hook (τυφλάγκιστρον)\r\nplaced under the vessel we raise it up from the depth, and beneath it when\r\nraised we place a two ply thread by means of a needle, and doubly tie and\r\ncut between.\r\n\r\nPaul says:\r\n\r\n    'Exposing the vessel with dissectors we must raise it up when it is\r\n    separated all round. If it be small, having stretched and twisted it\r\n    with a blunt hook, we may divide it through in such a way as to remove\r\n    part of it. But if it be large we must apply a double ligature under\r\n    it with a needle, either a piece of raw flax or some other strong\r\n    thing' (VI. v).\r\n\r\nThe 'eyed hook' is mentioned by Galen in describing the dissection of the\r\nspinal cord:\r\n\r\n    Ἐνδέχεται δὲ καὶ χωρὶς βελόνης ἀγκίστρῳ διατρήτῳ γενέσθαι τὴν\r\n    ἐγχείρησιν, ὡς ἐπὶ τῶν περὶ τὰς καρωτίδας ἀρτηρίας νεύρων εἴωθε\r\n    ποιεῖσθαι (ii. 669).\r\n\r\n    'It is advisable that the manipulation be performed not with a needle\r\n    but with an eyed hook, as is usually done in the case of the tendons\r\n    in the neighbourhood of the carotid arteries.'\r\n\r\nA small variety of the blunt hook is mentioned by Celsus, Galen, and Paul.\r\n\r\nOf the extraction of foreign bodies from the ear Celsus says:\r\n\r\n    Sin aliquid exanime est, specillo oriculario protrahendum est, aut\r\n    hamulo retuso paulum recurvato (VI. vii).\r\n\r\nPaul says that if stones of fruits, &c. fall into the ear they must be\r\nextracted with an ear scoop, a hook, or a forceps.\r\n\r\nBoth types of blunt hook are represented by extant specimens; see Pl.\r\nXXIII, figs. 3, 4. These remind us of our aneurism needles, and it is\r\ninteresting to note that Galen (_ut supra_) speaks of an 'eyed hook'. The\r\ninstruments shown in Pl. XXIII, figs. 2, 4 we might look on either as\r\ncurved retractors or dissectors as they are half sharp. Pl. XXV, fig. 2\r\nshows a hook of crotchet-hook type combined with a scoop. It is from\r\nHerculaneum.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Strigil._\r\n\r\nGreek, ξύστρα. Latin, _strigil_.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been a common method of applying remedies to the auditory\r\ncanal to warm them in a strigil and pour them in with it. Galen frequently\r\nmentions this. In _Med. Sec. Loc._ (xii. 622) he says:\r\n\r\n    Having warmed the fat of a squirrel in a strigil, instil it.\r\n\r\nCelsus (VI. vii. l) says:\r\n\r\n    In aurem vero infundere aliquod alimentum oportet quod semper ante\r\n    tepefieri convenit; commodissimeque per strigilem instillatur.\r\n\r\nMarcellus (IX. l) says:\r\n\r\n    Conteres et in strigili calefacies, et infundes, et lana occludes\r\n    aurem.\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus (xxxix) says:\r\n\r\n    Ad auriculae dolorem et tumorem sine ulcere prodest herbae urceolaris\r\n    aut cucurbitae ramentorum sucus tepens per strigilem in foramen auris\r\n    dolentis infusus.\r\n\r\nThe strigil varied much in size and shape. A common form was a\r\nsickle-shaped instrument, the circular part being hollow and semicircular\r\non section, and admirably adapted for warming and pouring oil and other\r\nmedicaments into the ear as above described. Pl. XXV, fig. 1 shows a small\r\nstrigil from my collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spoon for applying astringent liquids to the uvula._\r\n\r\nGreek, σταφυλεπάρτης.\r\n\r\nIn his description of the medical treatment of diseases of the mouth Paul\r\n(III. xxvi) says:\r\n\r\n    'When the uvula is inflamed we must use the gargles recommended for\r\n    inflammation of the tonsils, and those of a moderately astringent\r\n    nature, such as the juice of pomegranate, applied by means of a spoon\r\n    or the instrument called the \"uvula medicator\"' (σταφυλεπάρτου).\r\n\r\nIt is evident that it is quite a different instrument from the\r\nstaphylocaustus (_q. v._), which we are specially told had more than one\r\nhollow and was a grasping instrument like a forceps. The present\r\ninstrument is for applying liquids, and was apparently of the form of a\r\nspoon. Fabricius describes and figures such an instrument. It is a small\r\nround spoon with a long handle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFORCEPS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Epilation Forceps._\r\n\r\nGreek, τριχολαβίς, τριχολάβιον (== τριχολαβίδιον); Latin, _vulsella_.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the hair from the face for cosmetic purposes is a custom\r\nwhich has come down to us from prehistoric times, and seems to have been\r\nvery prevalent among all primitive races. In the bronze age the method by\r\nwhich this was accomplished seems to have been to fix the hairs with a\r\nbroad jawed forceps and cut them off close to the skin by means of a knife\r\nor 'razor'. Thus did primitive men 'shave', and very often in early bronze\r\nage graves in Scandinavia and in the Swiss lake-dwelling excavations these\r\nforceps and razors are found together. No doubt also epilation proper was\r\npractised occasionally, but the majority of the prehistoric forceps are\r\nnot for epilation but for fixing the hairs to allow the knife to divide\r\nthem close to the skin. At a later time, with the more common use of\r\nsteel, the Greeks and Romans shaved as we do, and epilation proper was\r\npractised for removing superfluous hairs from the face and also to remove\r\ntrichiasis. Aristophanes, a contemporary of Hippocrates (Ran. 516, Lys.\r\n89, 151), Persius (iv. 37) and Juvenal (vii. 114) refer to the depilation\r\nof the pubes as being common among certain classes, and the early\r\nChristian Fathers deplore the practice. See also the remarks of Suetonius\r\non the conduct of Domitian (xxii). Prosper Alpinus, who visited Egypt in\r\nthe sixteenth century and wrote an interesting book on the state of\r\nmedicine in that country, found the custom still prevalent among the\r\nEgyptian women, and thus explains the object with which it was practised\r\n(_Medicina Aegyptiorum_, cap. III. xv):\r\n\r\n    A pulveribus, qui Aegyptiis fere toto anno ventorum terraeque\r\n    siccitatis occasione perpetuo familiares existunt, atque ab assiduis\r\n    sudoribus quibus coeli calore omnia corpora continue abundant,\r\n    illuvieque quadam immunda redduntur, atque foetentia, ex quo pleraque\r\n    ipsorum et foetere et pediculis abundare solent. Balneis omnes hi\r\n    populi utuntur familiarissime pro corporum abstersione, maximeque\r\n    mulieres, quibus curae magis est corpora ipsarum pulchriora facere\r\n    ipsorum, illuviem et foetorem corrigentes, ut cariores sint suis\r\n    viris. Eae etenim saepissime corpora in iis lavant, at mundant ab\r\n    illuvie, perlotaque variis ornant odoribus ut recte unguentis oleant.\r\n    Ac veluti Italae mulieres atque aliarum multarum etiam nationum ad\r\n    capillorum facieique omne cultum adhibent studium, ita Aegyptiae\r\n    capillorum cultum negligunt ex consuetudine omnes capillos in bursam\r\n    serico panno paratam concludentes, ac ad pudendorum abditarumque\r\n    corporis partium ornatum omnem diligentiam adhibent. Pudendis igitur\r\n    tota cura in balneis ab iis adhibetur. Ea siquidem in primis lavant,\r\n    pilisque nudant, locaque pudendorum perpetuo glabra gestant, turpeque\r\n    ibi est mulierum pilis obsitam vulvam habere. Demum lotas eas partes\r\n    glabrasque effectas variis unguentis etiam exornant.\r\n\r\nThe custom survived in France and Italy in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nEpilation as a purely surgical operation was frequently necessary for the\r\ntrichiasis consequent on the granular ophthalmia which was so common among\r\nthe Romans. Paul (VI. xiii) says:\r\n\r\n    'Turn the eyelid outwards and, with an epilation forceps (τριχολαβίῳ)\r\n    dragging out the offending hairs, either one, or two, or three or\r\n    whatever number there are. Then apply a heated olivary probe or an\r\n    aural probe or some such slender instrument to the place from whence\r\n    the hair or hairs have been removed.'\r\n\r\nThe numbers of toilet epilation forceps which have been found are\r\nenormous. Moreover, forceps of exactly similar form were in use in every\r\nhousehold as accessories of the lamp for raising and snuffing the wick,\r\nand artisans used them also for the finer manipulations of their crafts;\r\nso that by far the largest number of forceps of this type are not surgical\r\ninstruments, but household implements. However, we have plenty of\r\nspecimens from purely surgical finds.\r\n\r\nOf the surgical instruments all forms agree in having no teeth. The\r\nsimplest form consists of a strip of metal bent on itself straight as in\r\nPl. XXVI, fig. 3, or with the jaws turned inwards, as in Pl. XXVI, fig. 5.\r\nThese are often pocket forceps. A 'pocket-companion', consisting of a\r\ntoilet forceps, an ear-pick and a nail-cleaner, such as is seen in Pl.\r\nXXVI, fig. 4, is a common object in museums, such as the Guildhall Museum,\r\nwhere this object is. A variety of epilation forceps with rounded legs is\r\nseen in Pl. XXVI, fig. 2. Several of these have been obtained from purely\r\nsurgical finds. Others are formed by sawing a bar of bronze up its centre,\r\nas in the specimen shown in Pl. XXVI, fig. 1, which is 13 cm. 4 mm. long,\r\nand with jaws 10 mm. broad. It is from the Naples Museum.\r\n\r\nThis is the form most typical of the surgical epilation forceps. Several\r\nof this type were found in the grave of the oculist Gaius F. Severus at\r\nRheims (Pl. XXVI, fig. 6). They are very large powerful instruments, from\r\n15 to 16 cm. long, and with jaws 7 to 8 mm. in breadth (Deneffe, _Oc. du\r\n3{e} siècle_, ii. 1-8). This form was no doubt used as a dissecting\r\nforceps or tumour vulsellum as well as for epilation, but the typical\r\ntumour forceps was toothed, and it is convenient to classify all those of\r\nthe untoothed type as epilation forceps.\r\n\r\nOther epilation forceps, which are however more likely to be toilet\r\narticles, have the jaws of extreme breadth, as in Pl. XXVII, fig. 3 from\r\nthe Mainz Museum. It has a sliding catch. They are evidently intended to\r\nremove a considerable number of hairs at once, or to fix them while they\r\nwere cut with razor or shears.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, however, that in addition to these broader forceps a\r\nvariety with quite narrow blades was used, as Paul (VI. xxiv) tells us\r\nthat stones, &c. may be removed from the ear with epilation forceps\r\n(τριχολαβίῳ), and again in fracture of the nose Paul (VI. xxiv) says that\r\nsplinters of detached bone are to be removed with these forceps. We have\r\nseveral forceps of this type. There are in the Naples Museum three, one\r\nfrom Pompeii, two from Herculaneum (Deneffe). One from my own collection\r\nis shown in Pl. XXVI, fig. 2. The points are narrow and rounded.\r\n\r\nA very interesting form is seen in Pl. XXVII, fig. 4, which shows a\r\nforceps in the Thorwaldsen Museum, Copenhagen. It is 12 cm. long, of which\r\n6 cm. of the upper end are solid and round. The remainder of the length is\r\noccupied by the blades of the forceps, each 5 mm. broad, except for 12 mm.\r\nat the extremity, where it expands into a leaf-shaped portion, 10 mm.\r\nbroad in its broader part. These leaf-shaped expansions oppose each other\r\naccurately, and on the narrow part of the blade above them there slides a\r\nrectangular catch which serves to clamp the blades and fix them like the\r\njaws of a vice.\r\n\r\nThe surgical epilation forceps is, as we have seen, usually a simple\r\ninstrument. Occasionally we meet with a forceps combined with some other\r\ninstrument. These are, as a rule, toilet articles. A pocket ear-scoop and\r\nepilation forceps combined was found in Paris. Precisely similar articles\r\nof steel may be bought in chemists' shops to-day. Another has a small\r\nunguent spatula combined with a forceps, while others carry olivary\r\nprobes. There are several of these in the St-Germain-en-Laye Museum (Pl.\r\nXXVII, figs. 5, 2). One from Melos, in the Athens Museum, has a\r\nporte-caustique.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polypus Forceps._\r\n\r\nGreek, πολυποξύστης.\r\n\r\nGalen (_Med. Sec. Loc._ xii. 685) alludes to the method of extraction of\r\npolypus from the nose by means of a forceps (ἔπειτα λαβιδίῳ ἐξαίρει), and\r\nfrom what Paul says it would seem that there was a special polypus\r\ninstrument, consisting of a forceps at one end and a rugine at the other.\r\nAfter describing extraction by means of a knife and scoop he says:\r\n\r\n    'If, however, any part of the tumour be left behind, we take another\r\n    polypus eradicator (ἕτερον πολυποξύστην), and with the end of it\r\n    (ἐπάκμου αὐτοῦ ξυστηρίου) bring away what remains, by stretching,\r\n    twisting, and scraping it strongly.'\r\n\r\nΞυστήριον means a small rugine, but stretching and twisting can only be\r\ndone with a forceps. Rare as the combination of an antique forceps with\r\nanother instrument is, we have one example of the combination of a rugine\r\nand a forceps, and, as it is admirably adapted for the extraction of nasal\r\npolypus, I think we are quite justified in considering it to be the\r\ninstrument indicated by Paul. This instrument was found in the grave of\r\nthe Paris surgeon. It is elegantly formed and is of one piece of bronze\r\nsawn down the middle. The upper part is surmounted by a rugine strongly\r\ncurved, pointed at the tip and cutting on one edge. The rugine measures 3\r\ncm. in length, and 5 mm. in breadth (Deneffe, _Tr. d'un Chir._, pl. v,\r\nfig. 1) (Pl. XXVII, fig. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tumour Vulsellum (Myzon)._\r\n\r\nGreek, μύδιον, μύγδιον, σαρκολαβίς, σαρκολάβος; Latin, _myzon_,\r\n_sarcolabon_, _vulsella_.\r\n\r\nThe form vulsellum has got so well established by usage in modern medical\r\nwritings that it would seem pedantic to write 'vulsella forceps', but so\r\nfar as I am aware it is not a form which has any classical authority. The\r\nclassical usage is _vulsella_, _-ae_, feminine. I shall follow custom and\r\nuse the modern term when using it as an English word.\r\n\r\nThe myzon, or tumour forceps, was a toothed instrument of the dissecting\r\nforceps type. Ducange says it takes its name from the shells which are\r\ncalled μυτίλοι, vulgo μύδια (mussels). It was used whenever it was desired\r\nto make traction on any object--such as a tumour--to excise it, or to\r\nraise and fix a piece of skin. Aetius (xvi. 106) says:\r\n\r\n    Μυδίῳ πλατυστόμῳ συλλαβὼν τὴν νύμφην διὰ τῆς εὐωνύμου χειρὸς\r\n    ἀποτεινέτω τῇ δὲ δεξιᾷ ἀποτεμνέτω παρὰ τοὺς ὀδόντας τοῦ μυδίου.\r\n\r\n    'Seizing the clitoris with a broad jawed vulsellum in the left hand,\r\n    put it on the stretch, and with the right cut it off close to the\r\n    teeth of the instrument.'\r\n\r\nPaul gives pretty much the same instructions (VI. lxx):\r\n\r\n    Μυδίῳ κατασχόντες τὸ περιττὸν τῆς νύμφης ἐκτέμνομεν σμίλῃ.\r\n\r\n    'Seizing the hypertrophied portion of the clitoris with a vulsellum,\r\n    excise it with a scalpel.'\r\n\r\nAetius (xvi. 107) also says:\r\n\r\n    Ὥσπερ οὖν ἐπὶ τῆς νύμφης προείρηται σχηματίζειν χρὴ τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ\r\n    μυδίῳ ἀποτείνειν τὴν ὑπεροχὴν καὶ τῷ πολυπικῷ σπαθίῳ ἐκβάσεως ὅλον τὸ\r\n    περιττὸν ἀφαιρεῖν.\r\n\r\nCf. also Paul, VI. lxxi and again Aetius (iv. ii. 3).\r\n\r\nAgain Aetius says:\r\n\r\n    'If there is a large and malignant excrescence in the angle of the\r\n    orbit, the enlarged part must be seized with vulsella (μυδίῳ) and cut\r\n    off' (vi. 74).\r\n\r\nIn the corresponding passage in Paul (VI. xvii) another name for the\r\nvulsellum is used, viz. σαρκολάβος:--'granuloma of the inner canthus we\r\nseize with vulsella and excise' (σαρκολάβῳ). In treating of epulis he\r\nagain uses the same term: 'Epulis we seize with vulsella and excise'\r\n(σαρκολάβῳ).\r\n\r\nIn Moschion (II. xxx), in the chapter 'De Haemorrhoidibus quae in matrice\r\nnascuntur', we find a Latin transliteration of the two terms μύδιον and\r\nσαρκολάβος side by side:\r\n\r\n    Myzo vel sarcolabo haemorrhoides teneantur ita ut in aliquantum\r\n    extensas scalpello prius radices earum scarifes, et in aliquantum\r\n    artifex sarcolabo convertat.\r\n\r\nHere, in all probability, Soranus, from whom Moschion is copying, has\r\nsimply used μύδιον, and the added 'vel sarcolabo' is simply a gloss, for\r\nthe terms μύδιον and σαρκολάβος are synonymous. However this part of\r\nSoranus is lost. Extant specimens of the vulsellum are common. A simple\r\nvariety is formed by folding a plate of bronze on itself, as in Pl.\r\nXXVIII, fig. 1, which shows a specimen in the British Museum. The jaws are\r\nfinely toothed.\r\n\r\nMore usually the myzon is formed by sawing a plate of bronze partly along\r\nits midline as in Pl. XXIX, fig. 2, which is taken from the find of the\r\noculist Severus.\r\n\r\nAn interesting variation is seen in the specimen shown in Pl. XXVIII, fig.\r\n3 which is from my own collection. The line of junction of the jaws\r\ninstead of being in the median plane is sloping. The object of this\r\narrangement is not quite clear. A small variety of the vulsellum is\r\nreferred to by Aetius:\r\n\r\n    'Epulis we seize with a small vulsellum and excise with a small\r\n    scalpel' (ἡ ἐπουλὶς μυδιοσκέλλῳ ἀποταθεῖσα ἐκτεμνέσθω σμιλαρίῳ στενῷ,\r\n    vii. 24, 25).\r\n\r\nWe have one or two of these instruments. They remind one of fixation\r\nforceps. I illustrate one in Pl. XXIX, fig. 3. It is from the Mainz\r\nMuseum. There are four similar ones in the Frankfort Historical Museum.\r\nThe specimen shown in Pl. XXVIII, fig. 2, from the Naples Museum, is\r\ninteresting as being stamped with the name of the maker, Acachcolus.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider an interesting variation produced by extending the\r\nextremity of the blade to one side so as to increase the width of the\r\nblade (coudée type). This is a rare type.\r\n\r\nPl. XXIX, fig. 1 represents one of two from the find of the surgeon of\r\nParis. It is 17 cm. long, and the legs of the forceps are 8 mm. wide. The\r\njaws debouch to one side at an obtuse angle for a distance of 2 cm. and\r\nend in a fairly sharp point. The jaw is thus increased to 2 cm. in\r\nbreadth. They are finely toothed. They are concave internally and convex\r\nexternally. The other forceps was 14·5 cm. long and 8 mm. wide. The Museum\r\nat Naples has a forceps of this type, but having a sliding ring to fix the\r\njaws after they have been applied (Pl. XXIX, fig. 4).\r\n\r\nThis angled type of forceps may be the one referred to by Paul in his\r\ndescription of the plastic operation on the eyelid for trichiasis (VI.\r\nviii), when he directs us to raise the redundant skin of the lid with a\r\nfixation forceps and cut it off with a scalpel (βλεφαροκατόχῳ μυδίῳ, τοῦτ'\r\nἔστι πρὸς τὴν περιφέρειαν τοῦ βλεφάρου ἐσχατισμένῳ ἀνατείναντες τὸ\r\nπεριττὸν δέρμα, σμιλίῳ ἀποκόπτουσι). It may be noted that this coudée type\r\nof forceps has considerable affinity with the type of forceps presently to\r\nbe described for strangling haemorrhoids and the relaxed uvula, the only\r\nessential difference being that the blades are not crossed here.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Uvula Forceps._\r\n\r\nGreek, σταφυλάγρα.\r\n\r\nIn Aetius (II. iv. 12) we have an interesting description of the\r\namputation of the uvula by first crushing it in a forceps so as to prevent\r\nhaemorrhage and then cutting it off:\r\n\r\n    'Then inserting a vulsellum and making traction on it, the uvula\r\n    crusher (τὴν σταφυλάγραν) is fitted on about the middle of the uvula\r\n    or a little below it, and then it is pulled and twisted (by the\r\n    vulsellum). By the torsion it becomes lifeless and, as it were, snared\r\n    off; it curls up, becomes livid and comes off without much effusion of\r\n    blood. Wherefore it is well to wait some time and hold it till the\r\n    patient can stand it no longer, and then cut it off--the cut being\r\n    made close to the vulsellum but nearer the tip than to it.'\r\n\r\nThe σταφυλάγρα therefore corresponds in its action to a pile-crusher. This\r\ninstrument I believe to be represented by the type of forceps shown in Pl.\r\nXXX, fig. 1. It is in the British Museum. The two branches of the forceps\r\ncross like scissor blades, and at their ends the jaws are formed in such a\r\nway as to project forwards and enclose a cavity 1 cm. deep and 18 mm.\r\nlong. Over all the forceps is 18 cm. long. The jaws are finely toothed.\r\nThere is in the same museum another instrument similar in all respects\r\nexcept that it is 1 cm. shorter, and that in each blade, which is 16 mm.\r\nlong (Pl. XXX, fig. 2), there is a small hole near the proximal end. A\r\nposterior view of a similar instrument is seen in Pl. XXXI, fig. 1. It is\r\nfrom the find of the surgeon of Paris. A similar specimen is in the Mainz\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nPl. XXXII, fig. 3 shows a smaller specimen from the Naples Museum. It is\r\n11 cm. in length. A large powerful variety with a different arrangement of\r\nthe handles is seen in Pl. XXXI, fig. 2 from a specimen in the Antiquarian\r\nMuseum at Basle. It is 20 cm. long.\r\n\r\nA forceps which I take to be a staphylagra occurs on the coins of Atrax in\r\nThessaly (_circa_ 400 B. C.). The forceps stands alongside a bleeding cup.\r\n\r\nThe object of the holes in several of the specimens is to permit the\r\ninsertion of a cord to bind the jaws firmly together, and thus keep up the\r\nstrangulation of the part for some time, as Aetius directs. The\r\napplication of a ligature in this way would, of course, not be possible\r\nwhile the instrument was applied to the uvula, but the following passage\r\nfrom Leonidas (Paul, vi. 79) shows that the uvula crusher was also used to\r\nclamp piles in the same way:\r\n\r\n    'Having seized the haemorrhoids and held them there for some time with\r\n    the uvula crusher (σταφυλάγρᾳ) he cuts them off with a scalpel.'\r\n\r\nIn such a case the application of a cord to clamp the jaws together would\r\nbe a distinct convenience. The short variety is more suitable for external\r\noperations, as for haemorrhoids; the long variety for manipulations in the\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nHippocrates mentions the uvula crusher as one of the instruments necessary\r\nfor the outfit of the physician (i. 63).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Forceps for applying Caustic to Uvula._\r\n\r\nGreek, σταφυλοκαύστης.\r\n\r\nA remarkable variety of forceps, of which there is only one extant\r\nspecimen (which is in the Vienna Museum) is shown in Pl. XXXII, fig. 2. It\r\nis formed of two branches which cross and are fixed by a rivet near the\r\nmiddle of the instrument. The jaws are 3·5 cm. long, concave internally,\r\nand fit accurately together, enclosing an oval cavity 1 cm. in diameter.\r\nThis forceps is, I believe, the one which Paul describes as used for\r\ndestroying the uvula with caustic. He says (VI. xxi) that if from timidity\r\nthe patient decline excision of the uvula, we are to take the caustic used\r\nfor operations on the eyelids, or some such caustic, and fill with it the\r\nhollows of the caustic holder for the uvula (τοῦ σταφυλοκαύστου τὰς\r\nκοιλότητας), and directing the patient to gape wide, and getting the\r\ntongue pressed down with a tongue depressor, we open the instrument\r\nsufficiently and grasp with it as much of the uvula as we cut off in the\r\nother operation. The medicament must neither be of too liquid consistence,\r\nlest it run down from the uvula and burn the adjoining parts, nor very\r\nhard, that it may quickly act on the uvula. And if from one application\r\nthe uvula becomes black this will be sufficient, but if not, we must use\r\nit again. In VI. lxxix he says that some, filling the hollows of the\r\nstaphylocaustes (τὰς κοιλίας σταφυλοκαύστου) with caustic, burn off\r\nhaemorrhoids in the same way as they do the uvula. An interesting use of\r\nthis instrument is mentioned by the same author in the chapter above\r\nreferred to, while describing the method of treating haemorrhoids by the\r\nligature:\r\n\r\n    'By means of the forceps for applying caustic to haemorrhoids, or the\r\n    forceps for applying caustic to the uvula (τῷ αἱμορροϊδοκαύστῃ ἢ τῷ\r\n    σταφυλοκαύστῃ), we surround them close to the jaws of the instrument\r\n    (πρὸς τὰ χείλη) with a five-ply thread of lint, and strangle the\r\n    haemorrhoids separately with this ligature.'\r\n\r\nIt would seem then that, just as there was a long instrument for crushing\r\nthe uvula and a short one for crushing haemorrhoids, there were\r\ncorresponding instruments for cauterizing these parts, probably differing\r\nfrom each other only in the length of the handle.\r\n\r\nThe passage above quoted has given much trouble to the scribes and\r\ncommentators apparently from a lack of knowledge of the instrument\r\nreferred to. About a third of the codices omit τῷ αἱμορροϊδοκαύστῃ, and\r\nCornarius and Dalechamps reject the words τῷ αἱμορροϊδοκαύστῃ ἢ τῷ\r\nσταφυλοκαύστῃ as superfluous and interpolated. Apparently they were\r\nunaware that both instruments were forceps of similar principle but\r\ndifferent lengths, and quite suitable for putting a haemorrhoid on the\r\nstretch. The reason why these instruments are preferred, for this purpose,\r\nto the staphylagra is apparently that not being toothed like the latter\r\ninstrument they would be both less painful and less likely to cause\r\nbleeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pharyngeal Forceps._\r\n\r\nGreek, ὁ ἀκανθοβόλος.\r\n\r\nPaul (VI. xxxii) describes a forceps for removing foreign bodies from the\r\npharynx:\r\n\r\n    'Prickles, fish-bones and other substances are swallowed in eating and\r\n    stick in different places. Wherefore such as can be seen we are to\r\n    extract with the special fish-bone forceps' (τοῖς ἰδίως ἀκανθοβόλοις\r\n    προσαγορευομένοις ἐξέλκομεν).\r\n\r\nThis is the only reference to the acanthobolus I have met with, and it\r\ngives us no information as to the appearance of the instrument. It is\r\nnoteworthy, however, that Paul in his chapter on the removal of spiny\r\nbodies from the pharynx is copying Aetius, and the instrument Aetius names\r\nis an epilation forceps. He says 'bones stick near the tonsil or back of\r\nthe pharynx and can be seen, and if a considerable part projects out of\r\nthe tonsil it can be removed with an epilation forceps (τριχολαβίῳ)'. A\r\nforceps of the epilation type, but angled in its length, is figured by\r\nVédrènes. It was found in Pompeii. This forceps is eminently suitable for\r\npharyngeal work (Pl. XXXII, fig. 1). Albucasis figures an acanthobolus\r\nwith an up-and-down, not lateral, movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBLEEDING CUPS, CLYSTERS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bleeding Cups._\r\n\r\nGreek, σικύα, κύαθος; Latin, _cucurbitula_.\r\n\r\nThe extraction of blood by means of cups has been practised from remote\r\nantiquity. The Hindoo Vedas mention it, and it is interesting to note that\r\none of the methods was to apply a gourd with fire in it, for both the\r\nLatin _cucurbitula_ and Greek σικύα signify a gourd. The usual theory as\r\nto its action was that in a diseased part there was a vicious πνεῦμα which\r\nrequired removal.\r\n\r\nCelsus (II. xi) thus describes the different kinds of cups:\r\n\r\n    Cucurbitularum vero duo genera sunt; aeneum, et corneum. Aenea, altera\r\n    parte patet, altera clausa, est; cornea, altera parte aeque patens,\r\n    altera foramen habet exiguum. In aeneam linamentum ardens coniicitur,\r\n    ac sic os eius corpori aptatur, imprimiturque donec inhaereat. Cornea\r\n    per se corpori imponitur; deinde ubi ea parte qua exiguum foramen est\r\n    ore spiritus adductus est, superque cera cavum id clausum est, aeque\r\n    inhaerescit. Utraque non ex his tantum materiae generibus, sed etiam\r\n    ex quolibet alio recte fit. Ac si cetera defecerunt, caliculus quoque,\r\n    aut pultarius oris compressioris, ei rei commode aptatur. Ubi\r\n    inhaesit, si concisa ante scalpello cutis est, sanguinem extrahit; si\r\n    integra est, spiritum.\r\n\r\n    'There are two kinds of cups, bronze and horn. The bronze is open at\r\n    one end and closed at the other, the horn, open at one end, as in the\r\n    previous case, has at the other end a small foramen. Into the bronze\r\n    kind burning lint is placed, and then the mouth is fitted on and\r\n    pressed until it sticks. The horn one is placed empty on the body, and\r\n    then by that part where the small foramen is, the air is exhausted by\r\n    the mouth, and the cavity is closed off above with wax, and it adheres\r\n    in the same way as before. Either may advantageously be constructed\r\n    not only of these varieties of material but of any other substance.\r\n    If other things are not to be had a small cup or a narrow mouthed jar\r\n    will answer the purpose. When it has fastened on, if the skin has\r\n    previously been cut with a scalpel it extracts blood; but if it be\r\n    entire, air.'\r\n\r\nPaul says:\r\n\r\n    'When we are about to apply the empty instrument, having placed the\r\n    limb in an erect position, we fasten it to the side, for if we apply\r\n    the light above when lying down, the wick falling upon the skin with\r\n    the flame burns in a painful manner, and for this there is no\r\n    necessity. It is necessary that the size of the instrument be\r\n    proportionate to the part to which it is applied, and on that account\r\n    there is great difference of cupping-instruments with regard to the\r\n    smallness and greatness of size. Moreover those which are made with\r\n    longer necks and broader bellies are possessed of a strong power of\r\n    attraction' (VI. xli).\r\n\r\nFrom Oribasius (_Med. Coll._ VII. xvi) we learn that sometimes the lips\r\nwere flat (ἐπίπεδα τὰ χείλεα) and sometimes concave (σεσιμωμένα τὰ\r\nχείλεα). This does not, however, mean that the border was guttered, but\r\nthat the whole lip instead of lying in one plane was arched.\r\n\r\nFrom a passage in Aretaeus we learn that one reason for the cup being\r\nbellied out above was that there was oil floating free in the instrument,\r\nwhich might otherwise escape and scald the patient. Aretaeus says:\r\n\r\n    'Apply plenty of heat so as to warm the part as well as attract. The\r\n    cup should be light earthenware (κεραμεοῦν κοῦφον) and adapted to the\r\n    side (ἁρμόζον τῇ πλευρᾷ), or bronze with flat lips (πρηνῆ τὰ χείλεα)\r\n    so as to comprehend the parts affected with pain, and we are able to\r\n    place inside it much fire with oil, so that it may keep alive for a\r\n    considerable time. We must not apply the lips closely to the skin, but\r\n    allow access to the air so that the fire may not be extinguished' (_De\r\n    Morb. Acut._ i. 10).\r\n\r\nAntyllus says there are three materials of which cups are made, glass,\r\nhorn, and bronze. He rejects the silver ones because they heat too\r\nreadily. The bronze are the ones most commonly used. Glass is used where\r\nwe wish to mark the quantity of blood extracted. Horn ones are useful\r\nabout the head, where bronze ones would be difficult to remove, and also\r\nin the case of nervous persons who dread the flame. Bronze and glass cups\r\nmay be used without flame like horn ones if a hole is bored in the summit\r\nand the air sucked out, and the finger or a piece of wax is applied\r\nimmediately (Oribasius, _Collect._ VII. xvi).\r\n\r\nAristotle in his _Poetics_ discusses various tricks and arts of authors\r\nand among these he mentions the riddle of which he gives as an example:\r\nἄνδρ' εἶδον πυρὶ χαλκὸν ἐπ' ἀνέρι κολλήσαντα 'I saw a man who had glued on\r\na man bronze by means of fire' the reference being to a bronze\r\ncupping-vessel (see also Mayor's note to Juvenal xiv. 58). The cups\r\nmentioned by Hippocrates are also of bronze. The earliest written\r\nreferences are thus to bronze cups worked by fire. Ethnological research\r\nwould indicate, however, that horns worked by suction represent the more\r\nprimitive form.\r\n\r\nA good number of cups have come down to us. There are fourteen in the\r\nNaples Museum. There are two prevalent or usual types, one conical, and\r\nthe other flatter and more rounded. The largest cup known is in the Athens\r\nMuseum. Attached to it had been a chain 20 cm. long to hang it up by. It\r\nis 16 cm. in height, and was found in a tomb at Tanagra. This cup with its\r\nchain and attachment is shown in Pl. XXXIII.\r\n\r\nIn the British Museum there is one of bronze, 4 inches high and of the\r\nelongated conical shape. It was found in Corfu (Pl. XXXIV). One in Naples\r\nof similar shape has a ring attached to its summit as the Athens specimen\r\nhad (Pl. XXXV).\r\n\r\nThere are four very small cups in the museum at Mainz. These are 2·5 to 3\r\ncm. in height and 3 to 3·5 cm. in diameter. Two of these are shown in Pl.\r\nXXXVI, figs. 1, 3.\r\n\r\nThere are ten cups of glass in the Athens museum. They are of the general\r\nshape of the Mainz cups, but vary in height from 4 cm. to 6·8 cm. and in\r\nthe Scottish National Museum of Antiquities there are two cupping-horns\r\nwhich correspond to the description of Celsus. They were brought from\r\nShetland, where they were in use until comparatively recent times. Prosper\r\nAlpinus, who visited Egypt in the sixteenth century and wrote a book on\r\nthe state of medicine in that country, found these cupping-horns in use\r\nthere, and he gives drawings of the instruments he saw (Pl. XXXVII, fig.\r\n1). The horns used were those of young bulls, highly polished and with a\r\nsmall hole at the tip, by which the air was extracted by suction. To close\r\nthis a small tab of parchment was taken into the mouth, and moistened and\r\naffixed by the tongue. The Egyptians also used cupping-vessels of glass,\r\nspecially shaped and worked by suction. Pl. XXXVI, fig. 2 shows the shape\r\nillustrated by Prosper Alpinus. The method of using fire with cups was not\r\nknown to the Egyptians at the time when Alpinus wrote (_De Med.\r\nAegyptiorum_, ed. 1541, lib. ii. ch. xii. p. 139).\r\n\r\nHorn cups worked by suction are spoken of in the Hindoo Vedas.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find that these horn cupping-vessels are still in use\r\nin some parts of Africa, and one, the property of a Hausa barber-surgeon,\r\nwas presented to the Aberdeen Anatomical Museum by Sir William Macgregor\r\n(_Proc. Aberdeen Anat. Soc._ 1900-2).\r\n\r\nAn interesting form of cup is described by Hero of Alexandria (B. C.\r\n285-222). Hero's description is quite intelligible, although it would be\r\ndifficult to give an accurate translation that would be readily\r\nunderstood. I shall content myself with summarising his account. The\r\nfigure (Pl. XXXVII, fig. 2) shows a cup of ordinary flattened form,\r\ndivided into two by a diaphragm. Two tubes pass through the fundus, one\r\npassing through the diaphragm, the other not. Each of these tubes is\r\nfitted with another which is open at its inner end, but closed at its\r\nouter end and provided with a small crossbar to rotate it. Each of these\r\nsets of tubes is perforated by small openings. In the case of the short\r\ntube these are outside the cup, in the case of the long tube they are\r\ninside the cup, in the chamber shut off by the diaphragm. By rotating the\r\npistons these openings can be placed in apposition or not at will, thus\r\nforming valves. Open valve A by placing the holes in apposition. Close\r\nvalve B by turning the holes away from each other. The inner chamber of\r\nthe cup is now shut off except for the small hole A. Apply the mouth to\r\nthe valve A and suck the air out of the chamber. Close valve A. Apply the\r\ncup to the affected part. Open valve B and the negative pressure draws on\r\nthe affected part. The advantage of this arrangement is that the affected\r\npart is not directly sucked upon by the mouth, and the instrument is\r\ntherefore more pleasant for the operator to use. Bleeding cups occur on\r\nthe coins of Epidaurus (300 B. C.), Atrax (400 B. C.) and Aegale (200 B.\r\nC.).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clysters._\r\n\r\nThe ancients made frequent use of injections into the various orifices of\r\nthe body. The apparatus used was a bladder or skin of an animal fixed to a\r\ntube. This form of instrument remained in use till the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century, although the elaborate enema syringe, on the principle\r\nof the force pump, had been in use since the fifteenth century at least.\r\nThe following passage from Heister (anno 1739) is interesting as showing\r\nexactly the method of its manipulation:\r\n\r\n    Pl. XXXVII, fig. 3 machinam clysteri iniiciendo adaptam designat, qua\r\n    Germani ut et Batavi vulgo utuntur. Litt. AA vesicam denotant cum\r\n    liquore contento; quae vero in adultis duplo vel triplo amplior quam\r\n    hic indicatur esse solet, pro libra circiter, et quo D excedit,\r\n    liquoris continenda; BB tubulum sive fistulam osseam ano immittendam,\r\n    per quam liquor in intestina iniicitur; CC vinculum superius, quod,\r\n    postquam fistula in ano est, solvitur ac removetur; DD vinculum\r\n    inferius, quo vesica clauditur, ne liquor immissus elabi queat (vol.\r\n    ii. p. 1117).\r\n\r\nThe rectal apparatus is called by Galen κλυστήρ, the uterine μητρεγχύτης,\r\nand the bladder injector is called καθετήρ. In x. 328 we find all these\r\nthree terms used in one paragraph:\r\n\r\n    Ἐς ταῦτα μὲν γὰρ διὰ =κλυστῆρος= εἰς μήτραν δὲ διὰ =μητρεγχυτῶν= τῶν\r\n    ἐπιτηδείων τι φαρμάκων ἐνίεμεν ὥσπερ γε καὶ εἰς κύστιν διὰ τῶν\r\n    εὐθυτρήτων καθετήρων.\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of injection apparatus which are specially named\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n    (1) Rectal: Greek, κλυστήρ, -ῆρος; Latin, _clyster_.\r\n\r\n    (2) Vaginal: Greek, μητρεγχύτης; Latin, _clyster_.\r\n\r\n    (3) Uterine: Greek, μητρεγχύτης; Latin, _clyster_.\r\n\r\n    (4) Bladder: Greek, εὐθύτρητος καθετήρ; Latin, _clyster_.\r\n\r\n    (5) Nasal: Greek, ῥινεγχύτης; Latin, _rhinenchytes_.\r\n\r\n    (6) Ear: Greek, ὠτεγχύτης; Latin, _oricularius clyster_.\r\n\r\n    (7) Sinus: Greek, πυουλκός; Latin, _oricularius clyster_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rectal Clyster._\r\n\r\nEarly Egyptian writings refer to rectal enemas: numerous prescriptions,\r\nincluding several for nutrient enemas, are given.\r\n\r\nOribasius gives us many interesting particulars about enemas (_Collect._\r\nVIII. xxiv). The amount necessary is less for men than for women. In any\r\ncase the largest amount is three heminae (τρεῖς κότυλοι), the smallest one\r\nhemina (a small half pint). In dysentery and other cases where the parts\r\nwould be easily hurt, and where a prompt evacuation was required, cannulae\r\nwith the opening placed in the side were used. Cannulae with the opening\r\nin the end of the instrument were used where a large evacuation was\r\ndesired to be brought down from the higher parts. To destroy ascarides,\r\ncannulae with a circle of small holes placed laterally were used.\r\n\r\nFrom ch. xxxii we learn that the injection pipe varied in length also, for\r\nOribasius says that in making injections into the rectum for affections of\r\nthe bladder (e. g. to excite expulsion of urine in cases of retention),\r\nthe tube (τὸ κέρας τοῦ κλυστῆρος) ought to be short.\r\n\r\nIn the case of nutrient enemas Mnesitheus says the tube ought to be\r\nextremely long, and in admitting an injection one ought to keep up\r\ncompression of the empty part of the clyster because it often happens that\r\nthe injection returns from the rectum unless this is done (Oribas. viii).\r\n\r\nHippocrates (ii. 276) mentions inflation of the rectum with air by an\r\nenema in cases of ileus. A bladder is to be attached to a tube and the air\r\ninjected with this. It is then to be removed and a clyster injected.\r\n\r\nIn the excavations of the Roman Hospital at Baden there was found the tube\r\nof a clyster in bronze. It is cast in one piece of stout bronze (Pl.\r\nXXXVIII, fig. 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vaginal and Intrauterine Clysters._\r\n\r\nGreek, μητρεγχύτης.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to separate ancient descriptions of injections into the\r\nvagina from those into the uterus, for the terms for the two parts are\r\nfrequently interchangeable. It is undoubted, however, that actual\r\nintrauterine injections were made. Hippocrates (iii. 17) says:\r\n\r\n    'The end of the enema (i. e. the tube) is smooth like a sound. The\r\n    tube is of silver. A perforation will be made in the side not far from\r\n    the small tip of the tube (καθετήρ). There will also be other\r\n    perforations, which will be placed at equal distances on each side of\r\n    the tube throughout its length. The extremity of the injection tube\r\n    will be solid, all the rest hollow. To the tube will be attached the\r\n    bladder of a sow, which has first been well scraped. Place the milk of\r\n    a mare in the bladder, having taken the precaution to close the\r\n    perforations in the tube with a linen rag. The bladder is then closed\r\n    with a cord and given to the woman herself, and she, when the cord\r\n    shutting off the bladder has been removed, puts it inside the uterus.\r\n    For she herself will know where it ought to be placed. Then you press\r\n    the bladder with your hand as long as pus escapes.'\r\n\r\nThe description quoted already from Heister will help to make clear the\r\ndescription of the manipulation. There is in the Naples Museum (No.\r\n78,235) an injection tube of bronze answering to the description given. It\r\nis 13 cm. long, and it has at the end a small opening, while on the side,\r\nnot far from the tip, eight small holes are arranged in two superposed\r\nrings (Pl. XXXVIII, fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThere is a similar but slightly smaller instrument in the same museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bladder Clyster._\r\n\r\nGreek, εὐθύτρητος καθετήρ.\r\n\r\nThere are frequent references to injection of the bladder. Although from\r\nsome passages it is clear that the injection really reached the bladder,\r\nit is probable that at other times, under the heading of 'Injection of the\r\nBladder', only irrigation of the urethra is meant, just as sometimes by\r\nirrigation of the uterus only vaginal douching is meant. Irrigation was\r\npractised by means of a bladder fixed to the end of a catheter. Galen (x.\r\n328), however, calls the bladder syringe εὐθύτρητος καθετήρ, which may\r\nindicate that the eye was in the tip and not in the side, as in the\r\nordinary catheter, for a catheter with a straight bore would not reach the\r\nmale bladder.\r\n\r\nPaul (VI. lix) says:\r\n\r\n    'But since we often have occasion to wash out an ulcerated bladder, if\r\n    an ear syringe be sufficient to throw in the injection it may be used,\r\n    and it is to be introduced in the manner described above. But if we\r\n    cannot succeed with it we must tie a skin, or the bladder of an ox, to\r\n    a catheter and throw in the injection through its lumen.'\r\n\r\nIt is highly improbable that with an ear syringe the injection would have\r\npassed the triangular ligament and have actually reached the bladder in\r\nthe male; but the use of the ear syringe may refer to irrigation of the\r\nfemale bladder, and then an ear syringe would suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blacksmith's Bellows._\r\n\r\nGreek, φῦσα.\r\n\r\nIn cases of volvulus, Hippocrates bids us insert a purgative suppository\r\nand administer an enema. If these means are not successful:\r\n\r\n    'Insert a blacksmith's bellows (φῦσαν χαλκευτικήν) and inflate the\r\n    intestine in order that you may dilate the contraction both of the\r\n    colon and the intestine. Then remove it and give an enema' (ii. 305).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nasal Syringe._\r\n\r\nGreek, ῥινεγχύτης; Latin, _rhinenchytes_.\r\n\r\nA special nasal syringe with a double tube is mentioned by Aretaeus (ed.\r\nAdams, vol. ii. 459). The medicament is made into liquid form and is\r\ninjected by means of a nasal pipe. The instrument consists of two pipes\r\nunited together by one outlet so that we can inject by both at one time,\r\nfor to inject each nostril separately is a thing which could not be borne.\r\n\r\nGalen also mentions a nasal syringe (ῥινεγχύτης), though he does not\r\ndescribe it (xi. 125).\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus also mentions it:\r\n\r\n    Per nares ergo purgatur caput his rebus infusis per cornu quod\r\n    rhinenchytes vocatur (_Compositiones_, vii).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aspiration Syringe and Sinus Irrigator._\r\n\r\nGreek, πυουλκός.\r\n\r\nGalen (xi. 125) says:\r\n\r\n    'In cases of sinus he uses a tube of bronze or horn with a straight\r\n    bore, or otherwise the instrument called the pus extractor (πυουλκόν),\r\n    which has a wide bore. But if you inject rosaceum into the former (i.\r\n    e. tube of bronze, &c.) it will not pass through the syringe\r\n    (πυουλκῷ), so that in that case a pipe of wide bore is to be fixed to\r\n    a sow's bladder.'\r\n\r\nThis passage shows that the pyulcus differed in principle from the syringe\r\nformed by fixing a bladder on a tube. Hero (_De Spiritalibus_, c. 57)\r\nshows that it was a syringe formed of a cylinder of metal with a\r\nwell-fitting plunger.\r\n\r\nHero says:\r\n\r\n    'And the instrument called pyulcus works on the same principle.\r\n\r\n    'For a long tube AB is made, to which let there be fitted another CD,\r\n    and let C, the end of it, be closed by a plate. At D let it have a\r\n    handle EF, and let the mouth of the tube AB at A be blocked by a plate\r\n    furnished with a slender syringe GH, perforated.\r\n\r\n    'When therefore we wish to draw out pus, applying the extreme mouth H\r\n    of the little syringe to the place in which the pus is, by the handle\r\n    we draw the tube CD outward, and the space which is in the tube being\r\n    emptied something else is of necessity drawn in, and since there is no\r\n    other space than the mouth of the tube the liquid at and near it must\r\n    of necessity be drawn into it.\r\n\r\n    'Again when we wish to inject some liquid we put it into the tube AB\r\n    and taking hold of EF and pressing in the tube CD we press out as much\r\n    as we think necessary.'\r\n\r\nNote that Hero's description does not tally with the drawings which\r\naccompany the edition of his works which we possess (Pl. XXXVIII, figs. 3,\r\n4, 5). These show an instrument with a piston formed by a plug at the end\r\nof a rod, whereas Hero says the piston is to be formed of a second tube\r\nfitting inside the first. This is interesting, because it is much easier\r\nto get a well-fitting piston in this way than in the other; and this\r\nprinciple has been reverted to in many of our best hypodermic syringes and\r\nin some of the best air pumps, such as Edwards's.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ear Syringe._\r\n\r\nGreek, ὠτεγχύτης, ὠτικὸς κλυστήρ; Latin, _oricularius clyster_.\r\n\r\nThe ear syringe is very frequently referred to by both Greek and Latin\r\nwriters; in fact, Celsus uses the term so often to denote a syringe for a\r\nlarge variety of uses that it is evident that it is almost a general term\r\nfor any small syringe.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its use in washing out the ear in cases of foreign bodies,\r\nimpacted cerumen, &c. he uses it to wash out the foreskin in balanitis, to\r\nsyringe fistulae, to wash out the bladder through a lithotomy wound, &c.\r\n\r\nIn cases of foreign bodies in the ear he says:\r\n\r\n    Sternutamenta quoque admota id commode elidunt, aut oriculario\r\n    clystere aqua vehementer intus compulsa (VI. vii).\r\n\r\nAetius and Paul tell us it was used to wash out the vagina, and Paul says\r\nit might be used to make injections into the bladder. Oribasius says:\r\n\r\n    'We use flushing with an ear syringe in abscess of the intercostal\r\n    space, and in fistulas to expel first the pus with warm water, then to\r\n    cleanse the cavity with melicrate' (_Collect._ viii. 24).\r\n\r\nFrom a consideration of the various uses to which this instrument was put,\r\nand from the fact that it is contrasted at times (e. g. in Paul, VI. lix)\r\nwith syringes formed by adding a bladder to a tube, I am of the opinion\r\nthat this instrument, like the pyulcus, was a syringe of the form of a\r\nmetal cylinder with a plunger like the ear syringe of to-day, and used, as\r\nthe ear syringe was a few years ago, for flushing sinuses and irrigating\r\nwounds, and as a handy instrument for all general purposes of the kind.\r\nThis is borne out by the fact that the ear syringe, described in detail by\r\nAlbucasis (p. 157), is a cylinder of bronze or silver, wide above and\r\nnarrowed to a point with a small opening in it and with a well-fitting\r\nplunger wrapped with a little cotton at one end. His figure, though quite\r\nintelligible, is too conventionalised to give any additional information.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Insufflator for Powder._\r\n\r\nInsufflation in powder form was a common method of applying medicaments to\r\nthe throat and nose. All writers mention this, but the fullest description\r\nof the tube used is given by Oribasius, who says (_Collect._ xii):\r\n\r\n    'Those things which evacuate the head we use in the following manner.\r\n    A reed slender and with a straight bore, six inches in length, and of\r\n    such a size that it can be placed in the nares, is taken and its\r\n    cavity entirely filled with medicament. The reed may be either natural\r\n    or of bronze. This being placed in the nares, we propel the medicament\r\n    by blowing into the other end.'\r\n\r\nAlexander Trallianus (IV. viii) describes the insufflation of the woolly\r\nhairs of the platanus to stop epistaxis, and Aretaeus mentions the\r\ninsufflation of sternutatories (459, vol. ii), and again (408, vol. ii) he\r\nsays medicines may be blown into the pharynx by a reed, or quill, or wide\r\nlong tube (καλάμῳ ἢ πτίλῳ ἢ καυλῷ παχεῖ καὶ ἐπιμήκει).\r\n\r\nA fine example of a bronze insufflator was discovered among the\r\ninstruments of the surgeon of Paris. It is 15-1/2 cm. in length, and 5 mm.\r\nin diameter. It is formed by a plate of bronze bent round and soldered. It\r\nterminates in a little elliptical shovel slightly cup-shaped, of which the\r\ntransverse diameter is 3 cm. and the longitudinal 3 mm.; it had originally\r\nbeen overlaid with gold (Pl. XL, fig. 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cannulae for draining Ascites and Empyema._\r\n\r\nCelsus describes the cannula for draining ascites (VII. xv):\r\n\r\n    Ferramentum autem demittitur magna cura habita ne qua vena incidatur.\r\n    Id tale esse debet ut fere tertiam digiti partem latitudo mucronis\r\n    impleat; demittendumque ita est ut membranam quoque transeat qua caro\r\n    ab interiore parte finitur; eo tum plumbea aut aenea fistula\r\n    coniicienda est vel recurvatis in exteriorem partem labris vel in\r\n    media circumsurgente quadam mora, ne tota intus delabi possit. Huius\r\n    ea pars quae intra paulo longior esse debet quam quae extra, ut ultra\r\n    interiorem membranam procedat. Per hanc effundendus humor est; atque\r\n    ubi maior pars eius evocata est claudenda demisso linteolo fistula\r\n    est; et in vulnere si id ustum non est relinquenda. Deinde per\r\n    insequentes dies circa singulas heminas emittendum, donec nullum aquae\r\n    vestigium appareat.\r\n\r\nThe following passage from Paul shows that the tip was bevelled off like a\r\nwriting pen:\r\n\r\n    Χαλκοῦν καλαμίσκον ... καθίσομεν ἔχοντα τὴν ἐκτομὴν παραπλησίαν τοῖς\r\n    γραφικοῖς καλάμοις.\r\n\r\n    'We introduce through the incision in the abdomen and peritoneum, a\r\n    bronze cannula having a tip like that of a writing pen' (VL. l).\r\n\r\nTwo instruments answering to the above description are to be seen in the\r\nmuseum on the Capitol at Rome.\r\n\r\nAnother, answering more closely to the description of Celsus, is to be\r\nseen at Naples (Pl. XXXIX, fig. 2). It consists of a bronze tube, 9 cm. in\r\nlength, 7 mm. wide at one end, narrowing to 4 mm. at the other end, which\r\nis bevelled off as described by Paul. Surrounding the tube and 2·5 cm.\r\nfrom the bevelled tip is a ring 2·5 cm. in diameter.\r\n\r\nA more elaborate form of the cannula for ascites is seen in another\r\nspecimen, also in the Naples Museum (Pl. XXXIX, fig. 3). A tube 6·5 mm. in\r\ndiameter and 39·2 cm. long, has one end rounded and closed, except for a\r\nsmall hole in its tip and another in the side near the first. The other\r\nend carries a circular plate 2·5 cm. in diameter. Near the middle of the\r\ntube there is a slightly raised projection as if to carry a circular disc.\r\nInside the cannula is fixed by oxidation an obturator, which carries on\r\nits end a small handle fixed on in T-fashion. Scoutetten described this to\r\nthe Royal Academy of Medicine of Paris as a trocar and cannula, but the\r\nformation of the end is not such that the instrument could have pierced\r\nits own way through. It is rather an instrument which could be inserted in\r\nan incision made by a scalpel, and which could be closed after the\r\nabstraction of a certain amount of fluid--the obturator acting as an\r\nimprovement on the pledget of wool described by Celsus--but otherwise\r\ninserted like the previous example. A tube on similar principles to the\r\nascites cannula was employed in empyema (Hippocrates, ii. 259):\r\n\r\n    'After opening let out pus once a day. After the tenth day, when\r\n    everything has been evacuated, flush with wine and tepid oil. At night\r\n    let out what you have put in, and when the pus becomes thin and watery\r\n    insert a hollow tin tube' (ἐντιθέναι μοτὸν κασσιτέρινον κοῖλον).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tubes to prevent Contractions and Adhesions._\r\n\r\nGreek, μοτὸς μολυβοῦς; Latin, _plumbea fistula_.\r\n\r\nAfter operations on the nose, rectum, vagina, &c. it was usual to insert a\r\ntube of lead, bronze, or tin, to prevent contraction or adhesion and also\r\nto convey medicaments.\r\n\r\nCelsus says that after the operation for occlusion of the vagina a tube of\r\nlead is to be inserted during cicatrization:\r\n\r\n    Quumque iam ad sanitatem tendet, plumbeam fistulam medicamento\r\n    cicatricem inducente illinere, eamque intus dare; supraque idem\r\n    medicamentum iniicere, donec ad cicatricem plaga perveniat (VII.\r\n    xxviii).\r\n\r\nA similar tube is recommended by Celsus and Paul for insertion after\r\noperations on the rectum and vagina. Hippocrates (ii. 244) and Paul (VI.\r\nxxv) direct a leaden tube to be inserted in the nostril after the\r\nabstraction of nasal polypus.\r\n\r\nAfter dilation of the cervix uteri a hollow tube was put in to keep it\r\nopen. The tube was also filled with medicaments which were intended to\r\nhave a beneficial effect on the interior of the uterus. The fullest\r\ndescription of this is given by Hippocrates (ii. 799). After describing\r\nthe dilation of the womb with graduated dilators, he says:\r\n\r\n    'It is necessary to insert a leaden tube, similar in shape to the\r\n    largest dilator but hollow so as to contain substances, and the width\r\n    of the bore will be the same as that used for ulcers, in order that\r\n    the mouth of the tent may be smooth and do no damage, and it will be\r\n    prepared like the wooden dilators. When the tent has been prepared\r\n    fill it with rubbed down mutton fat, and when ready extract the wooden\r\n    dilator and insert the leaden one.'\r\n\r\nThis leaden dilator is referred to over and over again by Hippocrates.\r\nThere are in the Naples Museum three of these metal tubes. They are of\r\nbronze. One is 18 cm. long, 14 mm. wide at one end, narrowing gradually to\r\n6 mm. at the point (Pl. XXXIX, fig. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calamus Scriptorius._\r\n\r\nGreek, γραφικὸς κάλαμος; Latin, _calamus scriptorius_.\r\n\r\nThe writing pen reed is frequently referred to as an implement of minor\r\nsurgery.\r\n\r\nAlexander Trallianus (IV. viii) says that a calamus scriptorius whose\r\njoints have been removed may be used as an insufflator. Celsus (VII. v)\r\nsays that when a weapon buried in the flesh has barbs too strong to be\r\nbroken with forceps they may be shielded with split writing reeds, and the\r\nweapon thus withdrawn:\r\n\r\n    Fissis scriptoriis calamis contegenda, ac, ne quid lacerent, sic\r\n    evellenda sunt.\r\n\r\nPaul says 'Some apply a tube (καλαμίσκον) round about the barbs' (VI.\r\nlxxxviii).\r\n\r\nCelsus (III) mentions a narrow tube of this sort for drinking water\r\nthrough in cases of nocturnal thirst.\r\n\r\nPaul (VI. xxiv and III. xxiii) says that foreign bodies may be sucked from\r\nthe ear with a reed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quill._\r\n\r\nGreek, πτίλον.\r\n\r\nGalen (x. 1011) says that warts may be extracted by means of quills of\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nPaul quotes this (VI. lxxxvii):\r\n\r\n    'Some, among whom are Galen, advise us to scarify round the wart with\r\n    the quill of a hard feather, such as those of old geese or of eagles,\r\n    and to push it down so as to remove the wart from its roots. Others do\r\n    the same with a copper or iron tube.'\r\n\r\nAretaeus says a quill may be used for blowing powder into the pharynx\r\n(408, vol. ii).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCAUTERIES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cautery._\r\n\r\nGreek, καυτήριον, καυτήρ, καυτηρίδιον σιδήρεον; Latin, _Ferrum candens_.\r\n\r\nThe cautery was employed to an almost incredible extent in ancient times,\r\nand surgeons expended much ingenuity in devising different forms of this\r\ninstrument. A considerable number of these shapes are definitely\r\nmentioned. The cautery is nearly always spoken of as made of iron. Bronze\r\nbecomes too soft to act well as a cautery, so that even the earliest\r\nreferences to the cautery in the authentic Hippocratic writings refer to\r\ncauteries as 'the irons' (σιδήρια). It is true, of course, that in special\r\ncases bronze was used--and Priscianus recommends a cautery of gold or\r\nsilver for stopping haemorrhage from the throat (_Logicus_, xxii)--but\r\niron was the usual thing, and in spite of the enormous numbers of\r\ncauteries which must have existed only a very few have come down to us, as\r\nthe iron has perished. The cautery was employed for almost every possible\r\npurpose, as a 'counter-irritant', as a haemostatic, as a bloodless knife,\r\nas a means of destroying tumours, &c.\r\n\r\nThe following passage is interesting as showing its application in two of\r\nthese capacities (Aet. IV. iv. 45):\r\n\r\n    'I put the patient lying on her back, then I incise the sound part of\r\n    the breast outside the cancer and burn the incision with cauteries\r\n    until the eschar produced stops the flow of blood. By and by I incise\r\n    again and dissect the depth of the breast and again burn the incision;\r\n    and often repeat the same, both cutting and cauterizing to stop the\r\n    haemorrhage, for then the danger of a rush of bleeding is avoided, and\r\n    after the amputation is completed I again burn all the parts to\r\n    desiccation. The first cauterization is for the sake of stopping the\r\n    haemorrhage, the second for eradicating all traces of the disease.'\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cautery Knife._\r\n\r\nGreek, ξυράφιον.\r\n\r\nPaul on several occasions mentions the use of the cautery knife. In\r\nradical cure of hydrocele, as an alternative to the excision of the sac by\r\nthe knife, he explains how it may be done with the cautery, and says,\r\n'Afterwards, when the whole is laid bare, we stretch it with hooks and\r\nremove it with a sword-shaped cautery (μαχαιρωτῷ καυτῆρι)' (VI. lxii).\r\n\r\nGalen, speaking of cancer, says, 'Some use heated razor blades\r\n(ξυραφίοις), at once cutting and burning' (xiv. 786).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trident Cautery._\r\n\r\nFor forming issues over the spleen Paul (VI. xlviii) says:\r\n\r\n    'Some pick up the skin with hooks and push through it a long cautery,\r\n    and repeat this three times so that there are six eschars. Marcellus,\r\n    however, by using the instrument called a trident or trident-shaped\r\n    cautery (τριαίνῃ ἢ τριαινοειδεῖ καυτηρίῳ), formed six eschars at one\r\n    application.'\r\n\r\nVulpes describes an instrument of bronze which he considers to be a\r\ntrident-shaped cautery. It was found along side an instrument which I take\r\nto be a phlebotome. If it is for the purpose described above by Paul it is\r\nunusual in being of bronze, and it must have lost a good part of its\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Olivary Cautery._\r\n\r\nGreek, πυρηνοειδὲς καυτήριον.\r\n\r\nMalignant polypus of the nose is removed, says Paul (VI. xxv), with\r\nolivary pointed cauteries (πυρηνοειδὲς καυτήριον); and again, quoting\r\nLeonidas, he says empyema may be opened in the same way (VI. xliv).\r\n\r\nThe special cautery which was used for 'aegilops' (fistula lachrymalis)\r\nwas probably an olivary pointed cautery, as the cautery recommended by\r\nboth Scultetus and Paré for this is an olivary pointed one. Paul (VI.\r\nxxii) says, 'Some after excision of the flesh use a perforator, and make a\r\npassage for the fluid or matter to the nose, but we are content with\r\nburning alone, using the cauteries for fistula lachrymalis (αἰγιλωπικοῖς\r\nκαυτηρίοις) and burning down till a lamina of bone exfoliates.'\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gamma-shaped Cautery._\r\n\r\nPaul (VI. lxii), describing the radical cure of hernia, says:\r\n\r\n    'Wherefore having heated ten or twelve cauteries shaped like the Greek\r\n    letter Γ (γαμμοειδῶν καυτήρων) and two cautery knives, we must first\r\n    burn the scrotum through with the Γ-shaped ones, &c.'\r\n\r\n\r\n_Obol Cautery._\r\n\r\nIn the treatise on haemorrhoids (iii. 340) Hippocrates says:\r\n\r\n    'I order, therefore, seven or eight instruments to be prepared, a palm\r\n    long, and the thickness of a thick specillum, bent towards the end and\r\n    flattened on the point like a small obol' (ὡς ἐπὶ ὀβολοῦ μικροῦ).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lunated Cautery._\r\n\r\nGreek, μηνοειδὲς καυτήριον.\r\n\r\nPaul says in cases of sloughing of the prepuce we must cut it off, and if\r\nthere be haemorrhage we must use lunated cauteries (μηνοειδέσι\r\nκαυτηρίοις). They both stop the haemorrhage and prevent the spreading of\r\nthe sore (VI. lvii).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nail, Tile and Button Cautery._\r\n\r\nTreating of bubonocele, Paul says (VI. lxvi):\r\n\r\n    'Make a triangular mark over the centre of it and apply to the mark\r\n    nail-shaped (ἡλωτούς) cauteries heated in the fire, and afterwards\r\n    burn the triangle with gamma-shaped cauteries, and afterwards level\r\n    the triangle with cauteries shaped like bricks (πλινθωτοῖς) or lentils\r\n    (φακωτοῖς).'\r\n\r\nCauteries of nail shape are also referred to by Hippocrates in the\r\ntreatment of recurrent dislocation of the shoulder:\r\n\r\n    'Raise up the skin. Burn with cauteries which are not thick nor much\r\n    rounded but of an elongated shape (προμήκη). For thus they pass more\r\n    readily through' (iii. 151).\r\n\r\nGalen has a long note in explanation of this term:\r\n\r\n    Φαλακρὰ κέκληκε τὰ περιφέρειαν ἔχοντα κατὰ τὸ πέρας οἷον οἱ κατὰ τὰς\r\n    μασχάλας ἔχουσι πυρίνας ἤτοι τὰ διαπύρινα καλούμενα καὶ αἱ\r\n    σπαθομήλαι, προμήκη δὲ τὰ τούτοις ἐναντίως διακείμενα προσηγόρευσεν,\r\n    ὧν οὐκ ἔστι περιφερὲς τὸ πέρας ἀλλ' ὀξύτεραν περ' ἐμπλήρωμα\r\n    παραπλήσιόν πως τοῖς εἰς τὰς παρακεντήσεις ἐπιτηδείοις ὀργάνοις.\r\n\r\n    'He (Hippocrates) calls φαλακρά (globose) those having a ball at the\r\n    tip, such as those for the axilla, which have olivary points and also\r\n    those which are called double olivary probes and spathomeles. But\r\n    those which are the reverse he calls προμήκη, i. e. those which have\r\n    the end not globose but rather sharp, exactly like the instruments for\r\n    paracentesis' (xviii. 376).\r\n\r\nIn the Naples Museum there are three tile-shaped cauteries, one of iron\r\nand two of bronze. One of the latter is shown in Pl. XL, fig. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wedge-shaped Cautery._\r\n\r\nHippocrates (iii. 223) says that the oblique veins of the head are to be\r\nburned with wedge-shaped cauteries (σφηνίσκοισι σιδηρίοισι).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Needle Cautery._\r\n\r\nCelsus (VII. viii) says:\r\n\r\n    At ubi aures in viro puta, perforatae sunt et offendunt, traiicere id\r\n    cavum celeriter candente acu satis est, ut leviter eius orae\r\n    exulcerentur.\r\n\r\nTreating of trichiasis he says (VII. vii. 8):\r\n\r\n    Si pili nati sunt qui non debuerunt tenuis acus ferrea, ad\r\n    similitudinem spathae lata, in ignem coniicienda est; deinde candens,\r\n    sublata, palpebra sic ut eius perniciosi pili in conspectum curantis\r\n    veniant, sub ipsis pilorum radicibus ab angulo immittenda est, ut ea\r\n    tertiam partem palpebrae transsuat; deinde iterum, tertioque usque ad\r\n    alterum angulum; quo fit ut omnes pilorum radices adustae emoriantur.\r\n\r\nThis indicates a needle beaten out into the shape of one of our spuds for\r\nremoving foreign bodies from the eye. The needle handles from the find of\r\nthe oculist Severus are well adapted for this work, but are dealt with\r\nelsewhere (p. 69).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cautery guarded by a Tube._\r\n\r\nIn the treatise on haemorrhoids (iii. 345) Hippocrates says:\r\n\r\n    'We must make a [tubular] cautery like a writing reed and fit it to a\r\n    well-fitting iron' (καυτῆρα χρὴ ποιήσασθαι οἷον καλαμίσκον φραγμίτην,\r\n    σιδήριον δὲ ἐναρμόσαι καλῶς ἁρμόζον).\r\n\r\nAgain, in the treatment of polypus of the nose, he says:\r\n\r\n    'When that occurs we must insert a tube and cauterize with three or\r\n    four irons'(ὅταν οὕτως ἔχῃ, ἐνθέντα χρὴ σύριγγα καῦσαι σιδηρίοισιν ἢ\r\n    τριοσὶν ἢ τέσσαρσιν) (ii. 244).\r\n\r\nCelsus says this tube may be a calamus or a tube of pottery:\r\n\r\n    Apud quosdam tamen positum est, vel fictilem fistulam vel enodem\r\n    scriptorium calamum in narem esse coniiciendum, donec sursum ad os\r\n    perveniat: tum per id tenue ferramentum candens dandum esse ad ipsum\r\n    os (VII. xi).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wood dipped in boiling Oil._\r\n\r\nHippocrates, in diseases of the liver, says that cauterization may be\r\nperformed with boxwood spindles dipped in boiling oil (πυξίνοισιν\r\nἀτράκτοισι βάπτων ἐς ἔλαιον ζέον) (ii. 482). Aetius (XII. iii) says that\r\nthe root of the birthwort (aristolochia) may be used in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ignited Fungi, &c._\r\n\r\nIn the passage in Hippocrates on cauterizing for disease of the liver,\r\nHippocrates, as an alternative to the hot iron, says that eschars may be\r\nproduced by fungi. This must mean that they were set on fire like the old\r\nmoxa.\r\n\r\nThis is probably what is meant by Paul when, in treating of cauterizing\r\nover the stomach, he says (VI. xlix):\r\n\r\n    'But some do not burn with iron but with the substances called iscae.\r\n    The iscae (ἴσκαι) are spongy bodies forming on oaks and walnut trees,\r\n    and are mostly used among the barbarians.'\r\n\r\nAetius (II. iii. 91) says iscae are the medullary wood of the walnut tree.\r\n\r\nIn Hippocrates (ii. 482) the word μύκης, a fungus, is used--ἢ μύκησιν ὀκτὼ\r\nἐσχάρας καῦσαι (or with fungi burn eight scars).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nBONE AND TOOTH INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Raspatory._\r\n\r\nGreek, ξυστήρ; Latin, _scalper excisorius_, _scalper medicinalis_.\r\n\r\nThe raspatory or rugine consists of a blade of varying shape fixed at\r\nright angles to the shaft, and it is operated by pulling instead of by\r\nbeing driven forwards by striking or pushing. Although no ancient\r\nraspatory has been preserved to us we are quite familiar with the\r\ninstrument, as it has been in continuous use throughout ancient and\r\nmediaeval times, and it is in use at the present day. The raspatory is the\r\ninstrument upon which Hippocrates relies for eradicating fissured and\r\ncontused bone in injury to the skull:\r\n\r\n    'If you cannot discover whether the bone is broken or contused, or\r\n    both the one and the other, nor can see the truth of the matter, you\r\n    must dissolve black ointment and fill the wound with the solution, and\r\n    apply a linen rag smeared with oil, and then a poultice of maza with a\r\n    bandage; and on the next day, having cleaned out the wound, scrape the\r\n    bone with the raspatory (ἐπιξύσαι). And if the bone is not sound but\r\n    fractured and contused, the rest of the bone will be white when\r\n    scraped, but the fracture and contusion, having imbibed the\r\n    preparation, will appear black, while the rest of the bone is white.\r\n    And you must again scrape more deeply the bone where it appears black,\r\n    and if you thus remove the contusion and cause it to disappear you may\r\n    conclude that there has been a contusion of the bone to a greater or\r\n    less extent, which has occasioned the fracture that has disappeared\r\n    under the raspatory' (ὑπὸ τοῦ ξυστῆρος) (iii. 366).\r\n\r\nFrom Galen we learn that there were different sizes and shapes of the\r\nraspatory (x. 445):\r\n\r\n    'In simple fissure reaching to the second plate narrow raspatories\r\n    are used, and they should be of different sizes to suit all cases. The\r\n    affected bone being exposed _secundum artem_, first the broader ones\r\n    are to be used, then the smaller down to the narrowest. The narrowest\r\n    are to be used in the diploe.'\r\n\r\nPaul refers to a small raspatory (ξυστήριον) for use as a tooth scaler (q.\r\nv.). All the mediaeval writers figure numerous shapes of raspatories--many\r\nmore than we use to-day, but all on the same principle as ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chisel._\r\n\r\nGreek, ἐκκοπεύς; Latin, _scalper_, _scalprum planum_.\r\n\r\nThe flat chisel is referred to by Celsus in his description of the\r\nlevelling of an elevation on one side of a depressed fracture of the\r\ncranium:\r\n\r\n    Ergo, si ora alteri insedit, satis est id quod eminet plano scalpro\r\n    excidere; quo sublato, iam rima hiat quantum curationi satis est\r\n    (VIII. iv).\r\n\r\nNumerous references occur in other authors. There is a fine example of a\r\nflat chisel in the Cologne Museum (Pl. XLI, fig. 2). It is all of steel,\r\nand delicately ornamented with spiral indentations. This interesting\r\nlittle instrument was found in the surgeon's outfit already described, and\r\nis one of the best authenticated instruments--as regards its having been\r\nthe property of a surgeon--we possess. The chisel figured by Vulpes,\r\nconsisting of a cylindrical bronze handle and a flat blade, is, I believe,\r\na variety of scalpel.\r\n\r\nWe have many interesting references to the use of the chisel in bone work.\r\nIt was used as an osteotome to divide the bone in distorted union:\r\n\r\n    'If the callus be of stony hardness incise the skin with a scalpel,\r\n    and divide the union with chisels' (ἐκκοπεῦσι) (Paul, VI. cix).\r\n\r\nIn the removal of supernumerary digits we are to cut away the flesh all\r\nround, and either chop the bone through with a chisel (τῷ ἐκκοπεῖ), or\r\nremove it by sawing (Paul, VI. xliii). In using the chisel as an\r\nosteotome one chisel was often placed behind the bone to steady it while\r\nit was being struck by another in front. This method of applying two\r\nchisels, which is only described by the Greek authors, is always referred\r\nto by the phrase ἐκκοπέων ἀντιθέτων.\r\n\r\nThe following passage from Galen fully describes the manipulation (ii.\r\n687):\r\n\r\n    'Separate off the membranes adhering to the bone, which being properly\r\n    done, divide the bone of the rib by means of two chisels placed in\r\n    opposition to each other _secundum artem_' (ἀντιβαλλομένων δυοῖν\r\n    ἀλλήλοις ἐκκοπέων ὡς ἔθος).\r\n\r\nThe following passage from Paul shows the chisel used for a similar\r\npurpose:\r\n\r\n    'If part of the clavicle is broken off and unconnected, and if we find\r\n    it irritating the parts, we must make a straight incision with a\r\n    scalpel and remove the broken portion and smooth it with chisels (δι'\r\n    ἐκκοπέων), taking care that the instrument called 'meningophylax' (q.\r\n    v.), or another chisel, be put under the clavicle (μηνιγγοφύλακος ἢ\r\n    ἑτέρου ἐκκοπέως) to steady it' (VI. xciii).\r\n\r\nThe phrase δι' ἐκκοπέων ἀντιθέτων, which Paul uses in describing the\r\ntreatment of a fistula leading to carious bone, is translated by Briau--'à\r\nl'aide de tenailles tranchantes'. It does seem here, and occasionally in\r\nother passages, as if the phrase might suggest 'cutting forceps', but we\r\nhave no knowledge of such an instrument being used by surgeons in\r\nclassical times, and the passages from Paul and Galen show that only two\r\nchisels are meant. We may compare the passage on extraction of the foetus\r\nin Paul (VI. lxxiv), where he directs a second hook to be fixed on\r\nopposite the first (καὶ ἀντίθετον τούτῳ δεύτερον).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gouge._\r\n\r\nGreek, κυκλίσκος, κοιλισκωτὸς ἐκκοπεύς, κυκλισκωτὸς ἐκκοπεύς, σκυλισκωτὸς\r\nἐκκοπεύς; Latin, _scalper excisorius_.\r\n\r\nThe Greek writers frequently refer to the gouge. Celsus never does so by\r\nany special name, although it is evident that many of the manipulations\r\nhe describes as being performed by the 'scalper', his general term for\r\nchisels of all kinds, could only be performed with gouges and not with\r\nflat chisels. The gouge was a favourite instrument of Galen's, especially\r\nin injury to the skull. With it he removed pieces of fractured bone from\r\nthe skull. He also used it to groove a path for the vertical cutting\r\ninstrument called the lenticular (q. v.). He calls it a 'hollow chisel'\r\n(τῶν κοίλων ἐκκοπέων οὓς καὶ κυκλίσκους ὀνομάζουσιν, x. 445).\r\n\r\nPaul (VI. xc) says:\r\n\r\n    'And if the bone be weak, naturally, or from the fracture, we cut it\r\n    out with gouges (σκυλισκωτοῖς), beginning first with the broader ones,\r\n    and changing to the narrower, and then using those which are\r\n    probe-like, striking gently with the mallet to prevent concussion of\r\n    the head.'\r\n\r\nThe gouge is still familiar to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lenticular._\r\n\r\nGreek, φακωτός.\r\n\r\nThe lenticular of the ancients was a vertical chisel cutting on one edge\r\nand struck on the other by a hammer, while the end carried a rounded\r\nbutton, which being smooth did not injure the brain (Pl. XL, fig. 4). It\r\ntakes its name from the lentil-like (φακωτός) shape of the button. Galen\r\nhad a high appreciation of it, and gives a full description of its\r\nprinciple (x. 445), which is transcribed by Paul (VI. xc):\r\n\r\n    'The method of operating with a sort of incisor called lenticular is\r\n    greatly praised by Galen, being performed without drilling after the\r\n    part has been grooved all round with gouges.'\r\n\r\nWherefore he says:\r\n\r\n    'If you have once exposed the place, then applying the chisel, which\r\n    has at its point a blunt (rounded), smooth, lentil-shaped knob, but\r\n    which longitudinally is sharp, when you apply the flat part of the\r\n    lenticular to the meninges divide the cranium by striking with the\r\n    small hammer. For we have all that we require in such an operation,\r\n    for the membrane, even if the operator were half asleep, could not be\r\n    wounded, being in contact only with the flat part of the lenticular,\r\n    and if it be adherent anywhere to the calvarium the flat part of the\r\n    lenticular removes its adhesion without trouble. And behind it follows\r\n    the incisor or lenticular itself, dividing the skull, so that it is\r\n    impossible to discover another method of operating more free from\r\n    danger or more expeditious.'\r\n\r\nThe earliest illustration of the lenticular I have been able to obtain is\r\nthat given by Vidus Vidius (Pl. XL, fig. 2). It evidently is the same\r\ninstrument as that described by Galen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hammer._\r\n\r\nGreek, σφῦρα; Latin, _malleolus_.\r\n\r\nI have already quoted passages where the hammer is referred to as being\r\nused in cranial surgery. Paul says: 'When you apply the flat part of the\r\nlenticular to the meninges divide the skull by striking with a small\r\nhammer,' and again in using gouges, 'strike gently with hammer (σφῦρα) to\r\navoid concussion of the head' (VII. xc).\r\n\r\nPaul and Celsus describe a method of extracting foreign bodies from the\r\near by laying the patient on a board and striking the under side with a\r\nmallet. Paré mentions a hammer made of lead, and Fabricius describes one\r\npadded with leather, but neither of these is described by the ancients.\r\nThere is, however, a Roman hammer of lead from the excavation at Uriconium\r\nin the Shrewsbury Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Block._\r\n\r\nGreek, ἐπίκοπον, a butcher's block.\r\n\r\nThe ancients frequently amputated parts by placing them on a block and\r\nstriking them with a chisel. The mediaeval surgeons amputated parts as\r\nlarge as the forearm in this way, but the Greeks all describe amputation\r\nby knife and saw. We have reference to the 'block' in Greek literature,\r\nhowever. In describing the plastic removal of a portion of the scrotum\r\nPaul (VI. lxvii) says:\r\n\r\n    'Leonidas, laying the patient on his back, cuts off the redundant\r\n    portion upon a chopping block of any kind of wood or stiff leather'\r\n    (κατ' ἐπικόπου σανιδίου τινὸς ἢ σκληροῦ δέρματος).\r\n\r\nGalen uses the same word in the eighth book of his work on Practical\r\nAnatomy--apologizing somewhat for calling the article used by anatomists\r\nand surgeons by the undignified term of butcher's block:\r\n\r\n    Χρώμενος ἐπικόπῳ, καλέσαι γὰρ οὕτως οὐδὲν χεῖρον ἔστιν ὁμοίως τοῖς\r\n    ἀνατομικοῖς τε καὶ χειρουργοῖς τὸ στήριγμα τῶν ὑποβεβλημένων τῇ τομῇ\r\n    τῶν σωμάτων (ii. 685).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Meningophylax._\r\n\r\nGreek, μηνιγγοφύλαξ; Latin, _membranae custos_.\r\n\r\nThe meningophylax was a small plate, which was inserted under a bone which\r\nwas being cut in order to protect underlying structures. 'In cutting or\r\nsawing the bone,' says Paul (VI. lxxvii), 'when any vital parts are\r\nsituated below, such as the pleura, spinal marrow, or the like, we must\r\nuse the instrument called the meningophylax for protecting them\r\n(μηνιγγοφύλακα).'\r\n\r\nCelsus thus describes it (VIII. iii):\r\n\r\n    Factis foraminibus eodem modo media septa, sed multo circumspectius,\r\n    excidenda sunt, ne forte angulus scalpri eandem membranam violet;\r\n    donec fiat aditus, per quem membranae custos immittatur; μηνιγγοφύλακα\r\n    Graeci vocant. Lamina aenea est, firma paulum resima, ab exteriore\r\n    parte laevis; quae demissa sic ut exterior pars eius cerebro proprior\r\n    sit, subinde ei subiicitur quod scalpro discutiendum est; ac si\r\n    excipit eius angulum, ultra transire non patitur; eoque et audacius,\r\n    et tutius, scalprum malleolo medicus subinde ferit, donec undique\r\n    excisum os eadem lamina levetur, tollique sine ulla noxa cerebri\r\n    possit.\r\n\r\nPl. XL, fig. 3 shows a figure of the meningophylax from Vidius.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drill._\r\n\r\nGreek, τρύπανον; Latin, _terebra_, _terebella_.\r\n\r\nThere are, says Celsus, two kinds of drills. The first like those used by\r\nartisans and driven by a thong, the second with a guard to prevent the\r\ninstrument from sinking too deeply into the bone. The drill was used in\r\nexcising a piece of the skull where the diseased portion was larger than\r\ncould be comprehended by the modiolus of a trephine. The part to be\r\nremoved was surrounded by perforations with the drill and the intervening\r\nspaces were divided with chisels or raspatories. Celsus says:\r\n\r\n    At si latius vitium est quam ut illo comprehendatur, terebra res\r\n    agenda est. Ea foramen fit in ipso fine vitiosi ossis atque integri;\r\n    deinde alterum non ita longe, tertiumque, donec totus is locus qui\r\n    excidendus est his cavis cinctus sit. Atque ibi quoque, quatenus\r\n    terebra agenda sit, scobis significat. Tum excisorius scalper ab\r\n    altero foramine ad alterum malleolo adactus id quod inter utrumque\r\n    medium est excidit; ac sic ambitus similis ei fit qui in angustiorem\r\n    orbem modiolo imprimitur (VIII. iii).\r\n\r\nPaul says:\r\n\r\n    'If a weapon be lodged deep in bone of considerable thickness it may\r\n    be bored out with drills' (τρυπάνοις) (VI. lxxxviii).\r\n\r\nAretaeus (ed. Adams, p. 467) says that exposed bones are to be surrounded\r\nwith perforations by means of the drill and thus reduced (τερέτρῳ χρὴ\r\nπερικόπτειν τὰ γυμνά).\r\n\r\nThe boring parts of drills are not unfrequently found. The most ancient\r\nillustrations known to me of drills driven by thongs are in the work by\r\nVidus Vidius (_Chirurgia e Graeco in Lat. Conversa_, V. Vidio. Florent.\r\ninterprete c. nonn. eiusd. commentariis. Lutec. Paris., 1544).\r\n\r\nVidius shows three arrangements for driving these drills with thongs: the\r\nfirst method consists simply of a thong attached to the shaft of the drill\r\n(Pl. XLII, fig. 4); the second consists of a bow with the string of the\r\nbow wound once round the shaft (Pl. XLII, fig. 5); and the third consists\r\nof a crosspiece with a hole in the centre of it through which the shaft\r\npasses, and having strings from the end of the crosspiece to the top of\r\nthe shaft (Pl. XLII, fig. 3). Primitive arrangements truly, yet all three\r\nmethods of producing rotary motion are to be seen in use at the present\r\nday, and be it known that some of the most delicate boring performed by\r\nthe hand of man at the present day is done with drills turned by the thong\r\nstretched across a bow. The latest developments in mechanical devices for\r\ndrilling have failed to displace thong-driven drills for boring the holes\r\nin which the wheel spindles of the best hand-made chronometers move, and\r\nthe spindles themselves are turned in chucks rotated not by belts in\r\ncontinuous rotary motion, but in alternating motion by means of a thong\r\nstretched across a bow. A bow of cane with a strong but fine thread, one\r\nturn of which is taken round the drill, is drawn backwards and forwards\r\nand rotates the drill with marvellous rapidity and accuracy. The bows used\r\nby watchmakers average about a foot along the string. Similar drills are\r\nused by engineers in turning out small work. The form with the crosspiece\r\nmay be seen in use by travelling crockery menders, who drill holes in\r\nbroken pottery and clamp the pieces with rivets. A turn or two of the\r\nstring is made round the shaft, and the point of the drill being adjusted\r\non the spot to be bored the crosspiece is gently pressed down by the first\r\nand third fingers, causing the shaft to rotate. When the thong has nearly\r\nuncoiled itself the pressure is slightly removed, the momentum causes the\r\nshaft to overrun and coil the thong in the opposite direction to which it\r\noriginally was. The crosspiece is again depressed and the alternating\r\nrotation goes on without intermission, and the drill bores through the\r\npottery. The travelling crockery mender is, in the northern towns of\r\nEngland, not an unusual sight squatting at work on the kerb. On the\r\ncontinent the 'Rastelbinder' is a regular domestic institution. Not only\r\ncrockery but glass is readily drilled by these means, and one who has seen\r\nthe rapidity with which these drills rotate can readily understand the\r\nnecessity for the advice given both by Hippocrates and Celsus to\r\nfrequently remove the drill and dip it in cold water, in case sufficient\r\nheat be generated by the friction to cause subsequent exfoliation of the\r\nneighbouring bone.\r\n\r\nThe remaining method of producing rotation by means of a string fixed to\r\nthe shaft can be seen in use by boatmen when clearing water out of a boat\r\nwith a mop, The mop is laid over the side of the boat. A few turns of a\r\nrope fixed to the shaft are made round it and the rope being pulled the\r\nshaft rotates. The momentum generated causes the shaft to overrun and the\r\nrope to coil itself in the reverse way to the original. This is repeated\r\ntill the speed generated causes the water to fly off the mop by\r\ncentrifugal motion.\r\n\r\nThe fire drill of the ancient Egyptians was turned by a bow, and it is\r\ninteresting in connexion with the advice of Hippocrates to avoid\r\ngenerating too much heat in drilling the skull, and also because it helps\r\nto explain the construction of the instruments of Vidius. A sketch of an\r\nancient fire drill found by Flinders Petrie (_Ten Years Digging in Egypt_)\r\nshows that the head of the drill was separate and the points were also\r\nremovable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drill with Guard._\r\n\r\nGreek, τρύπανον ἀβάπτιστον; Latin, _terebra abaptista_.\r\n\r\nThis is the second variety of drills described by Celsus. It had a collar\r\nwhich prevented it from sinking beyond a certain depth, so that in\r\nexcising a piece of bone from the skull, which was the object for which it\r\nwas used, there was little danger of its doing injury to the brain or its\r\nmembranes:\r\n\r\n    Terebrarum autem duo genera sunt; alterum simile ei quo fabri utuntur;\r\n    alterum capituli longioris, quod ab acuto mucrone incipit, deinde\r\n    subito latius fit; atque iterum ab alio principio paulo minus quam\r\n    aequaliter sursum procedit (VIII. iii).\r\n\r\nFurther on in the same passage Celsus states that they were to be\r\nfrequently removed and dipped in water lest too great heat should be\r\ngenerated, so that they were evidently driven at a rapid rate with a thong\r\nlike the other drills. They are not mentioned by Hippocrates, but Galen\r\n(x. 445) describes them:\r\n\r\n    'In order to make less chance of error they have invented drills\r\n    called abaptista (ἀβάπτιστα τρύπανα), which have a circular border a\r\n    little above the sharp point of the drill. It is best to have several\r\n    for every thickness of the calvarium; for thicker bone longer are\r\n    required, for thinner bone shorter.'\r\n\r\nPaul (VI. xc) says:\r\n\r\n    'But if the bone is strong it is first to be perforated with that kind\r\n    of perforators called abaptista (περιτρυπήσαντες ἀβαπτίστοις τοῖς\r\n    λεγομένοις), which have certain eminences to prevent them sinking down\r\n    to the membrane, and then with chisels we remove the bone not whole,\r\n    but in pieces.'\r\n\r\nThe illustrations of drills given from Vidius (Pl. XLII) are really\r\nabaptista.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saw._\r\n\r\nGreek, πρίων, μαχαιρωτὸς πρίων (as if from μαχαιρόω); Latin, _serrula_.\r\n\r\nThe saw is very frequently mentioned in the description of operation on\r\nbone. Celsus (VII. xxxiii), in describing the amputation of a gangrenous\r\nlimb, says:\r\n\r\n    Dein id serrula praecidendum est, quam proxime sanae carni etiam\r\n    inhaerenti: ac tum frons ossis, quam serrula exasperavit, laevanda\r\n    est.\r\n\r\nAnd Paul says that in amputating a gangrenous limb the flesh ought to be\r\nretracted with a band lest it be torn by the saw. Saws were also used in\r\ncranial surgery. Hippocrates frequently mentions a saw (πρίων) in this\r\nconnexion, but it is evident that he means the trephine, as he describes\r\nits circular motion. Paul, however, makes it quite clear that he means\r\nflat cranial saws, for he mentions both saws and trephines in one\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n    Ἤδη καὶ τῶν πριόνων τε καὶ χοινικίδων χειρουργίαι, κτλ.\r\n\r\n    'The method of operating with saws and trephines is condemned by the\r\n    moderns as a bad one' (VI. xc).\r\n\r\nPl. XLI, fig. 3 shows a surgical saw from the British Museum (No. 2,328).\r\nIt is of bronze, and measures 112 mm. long, 3 cm. broad at one end,\r\nnarrowing to 23 mm. at the other. There are surgical saws of steel in the\r\nNaples Museum. Many of the saws extant are for use as 'frame' saws. Others\r\nhave the saw portion continuous with the handle, like a knife. Galen\r\n(xviii. 331) mentions these 'knife-shaped' saws: 'For in this way each\r\ndoes not become so exactly smooth as with sword-shaped saws (μαχαιρωτῶν\r\nπριόνων).' There is an example of this form of saw in the Guildhall\r\nMuseum, London.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trephine._\r\n\r\nGreek, τρύπανον, πρίων, πρίων χαρακτός, χοινικίς, ὀρθοπρίων; Latin,\r\n_modiolus_.\r\n\r\nThe ancient trephine is referred to by Hippocrates, who mentions a saw\r\n(πρίων and πρίων χαρακτός) having a circular motion (iii. 374):\r\n\r\n    'In trephining you must frequently remove the trephine, on account of\r\n    the heat in the bone, and plunge it in cold water. For the trephine\r\n    (πρίων), being heated by the circular motion (περιόδου) and heating\r\n    and drying the bone, burns it and makes a larger piece of bone\r\n    exfoliate than would otherwise be necessary.'\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n    'You must saw the bone down to the meninges with a serrated trephine\r\n    (πρίονι χρὴ χαρακτῷ ἐμπρίειν), and in doing so must take out the\r\n    trephine (πρίονα), and examine with a probe and by other means along\r\n    the track of the trephine' (πέριξ κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ πρίονος).\r\n\r\nIn injuries to the head in young people (iii. 371) he mentions a small\r\ntrephine (σμικρὸν τρύπανον), so that apparently several sizes were\r\navailable. Hippocrates, we have seen, uses the words πρίων and πρίων\r\nχαρακτός to denote the trephine. Galen always uses χοινικίς, but in his\r\nLexicon he gives two other words, viz. ὀρθοπρίονι and περητηρίῳ,\r\nostensibly from the works of Hippocrates:\r\n\r\n    Ὀρθοπρίονι--τῇ χοινικίδι.\r\n\r\n    περητηρίῳ--τρυπάνῳ τῷ εὐθεῖ καὶ ὀξεῖ, ἔστι γὰρ καὶ ἕτερον ἡ χοινικίς.\r\n\r\nThese terms do not, however, occur in any extant Hippocratic writings,\r\nunless, as seems possible to me, the latter term περητηρίῳ be a _var.\r\nlect._ for the obscure word τρυγλητηρίῳ applied to τρύπανον in ii. 470 in\r\nthe description of trephining a hole through a rib to drain an empyema.\r\nGalen held the trephine in little esteem. It must have been difficult to\r\nmanufacture a satisfactory instrument of bronze. In x. 448 he says: 'Some\r\npeople, shall I call them rather cautious or rather timid, have used\r\ntrephines' (χοινικίσιν); and Paul, in a passage I have already quoted,\r\nsays: 'The mode of operating with saws and trephines is condemned by\r\nmoderns as a bad one.'\r\n\r\nThe term χοινικίς is derived from χοινίκη and χνόη, the nave of a wheel.\r\nThe Latin term for the trephine, _modiolus_, has the same meaning. Celsus\r\ngraphically describes the trephine and the method of its application. From\r\nhim we learn how the ancients solved the problem of the centre-pin, which\r\nis necessary until the toothed portion has begun to bite. In modern\r\ntrephines this difficulty is got over by withdrawing the pin up the centre\r\nof the shaft. In mediaeval trephines it was solved by providing two\r\ninstruments, a male and a female, the male with centre-pin being used till\r\na circular track had been cut by the toothed ring, the female without pin\r\nbeing then used. In the time of Celsus the centre-pin was removable, being\r\ntaken out after the instrument had begun to bite. From Celsus too we learn\r\nthat the trephine was driven by a thong.\r\n\r\nCelsus and Hippocrates both remark that, as in the case of the drill, it\r\nis necessary to dip the trephine in cold water at intervals in order to\r\ncool it, lest heat sufficient to injure the surrounding bone be generated.\r\nThe thong manipulated by a bow would seem to be the method most applicable\r\nto an instrument like the trephine, which has a large boring radius, as\r\nslower motion is more easily produced by this arrangement than by one\r\nconsisting of a cross-piece with thongs. Celsus says:\r\n\r\n    Exciditur vero os duobus modis: si parvulum est quod laesum est,\r\n    modiolo, quem χοινικίδα Graeci vocant: si spatiosius, terebris.\r\n    Utriusque rationem proponam. Modiolus ferramentum concavum teres est,\r\n    imis oris serratum; per quod medium clavus, ipse quoque interiore\r\n    orbe cinctus, demittitur. Terebrarum autem duo genera sunt: alterum\r\n    simile ei quo fabri utuntur: alterum capituli longioris, quod ab acuto\r\n    mucrone incipit, deinde subito latius fit; atque iterum ab alio\r\n    principio paulo minus quam aequaliter sursum procedit. Si vitium in\r\n    angusto est quod comprehendere modiolus possit, ille potius aptatur:\r\n    et si caries subest, medius clavus in foramen demittitur; si\r\n    nigrities, angulo scalpri sinus exiguus fit qui clavum recipiat ut, eo\r\n    insistente, circumactus modiolus delabi non possit: deinde is habena,\r\n    quasi terebra convertitur. Estque quidam premendi modus, ut et foret\r\n    et circumagatur; quia si leviter imprimitur parum proficit, si\r\n    graviter non movetur. Neque alienum est instillare paulum rosae vel\r\n    lactis, quo magis lubrico circumagatur; quod ipsum tamen, si copiosius\r\n    est, aciem ferramenti hebetat. Ubi iam iter modiolo impressum est,\r\n    medius clavus educitur, et ille per se agitur: deinde, quum sanitas\r\n    inferioris partis scobe cognita est, modiolus removetur.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Perforator for Fistula Lachrymalis._\r\n\r\nGreek, λεπτὸν τρύπανον.\r\n\r\nGalen (xii. 821) says that Archigenes in cases of fistula lachrymalis\r\nperforated the nasal bone with a small drill (λεπτὸν τρύπανον), and Paul\r\n(VI. xxii) says:\r\n\r\nSome, after excision of the flesh, use a perforator (τρύπανον) and make a\r\npassage for the fluid or matter to the nose.\r\n\r\nAlbucasis figures a drill for this purpose which he says had a triangular\r\niron point and a conical wooden handle.\r\n\r\nIn the find of instruments of the third-century oculist Severus is a drill\r\nwhich Deneffe regards as intended for this purpose. It is 6 cm. in length\r\nand 7 mm. on each of its four sides. One end is pointed, the other has a\r\nslit for a knife-blade. It is beautifully damascened with silver (Pl. II,\r\nfig. 7).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bone Lever._\r\n\r\nGreek, μοχλίσκος, ἀναβολεύς.\r\n\r\nInstruments for levering fractured bones into position are described in\r\nseveral places. Hippocrates (iii. 117) says:\r\n\r\n    'In those cases of fracture in which the bones protrude and cannot be\r\n    restored to their place, the following mode of reduction may be\r\n    practised: pieces of steel (σιδήρια) are to be prepared like the\r\n    levers (οἱ μοχλοί) which the cutters of stone make use of, one being\r\n    rather broader and the other narrower, and there should be at least\r\n    three, or even more, so that you may use those that suit best, and\r\n    then along with extension we must use these as levers, applying the\r\n    under surface of the piece of iron to the under fragment of bone, and\r\n    the upper surface to the upper bone, and in a word we must operate\r\n    powerfully with the lever as we would do upon a stone or a log. The\r\n    pieces of steel should be as strong as possible so that they may not\r\n    bend.'\r\n\r\nIn a note to this passage Galen (xviii. 593) says:\r\n\r\n    'It is evident that the instruments described resemble those of stone\r\n    cutters, not in size but in principle. For the instruments prepared by\r\n    us for levering bone are similar in size to those used for levering\r\n    out teeth. But for levering bones several ought to be prepared,\r\n    differing from each other in length as well as breadth and thickness\r\n    at the point, by which means they may afford their greatest effect.'\r\n\r\nPaul (VI. cvi) gives us some additional information:\r\n\r\n    'Of whatever bones therefore we endeavour to replace the protruded\r\n    ends, we must not meddle with them when in a state of inflammation.\r\n    But on the first day before inflammation has come on, or about the\r\n    ninth day after inflammation has gone off, we may set them with an\r\n    instrument called the lever (τῷ λεγομένῳ μοχλίσκῳ). It is an\r\n    instrument of steel about seven or eight fingers' breadth in length,\r\n    of moderate thickness that it may not bend during the operation, with\r\n    its extremity sharp, broad, and somewhat curved.'\r\n\r\nThere are two bone levers in the Naples Museum, both of bronze. Pl. XLI,\r\nfig. 1 shows one of them (No. 78,012). It is 15·5 cm. in length, and with\r\nits ends flattened, and curved, and pointed, as described by Paul. The\r\nother instrument is of similar shape, but is somewhat less in size. The\r\nconcave surface at one end is smooth, at the other ridged like a file.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked, that though the similarity in form to the instruments\r\nfigured by Paré as in use in his time for levering up depressed bones\r\nshows that these are undoubtedly bone levers, it is quite possible, from\r\nwhat Galen says, that they may also have been used for levering out teeth.\r\nThe smooth end also corresponds to the description of the meningophylax,\r\nso that it is possible it may have been used in that capacity also.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bone Forceps._\r\n\r\nGreek, ὀστάγρα.\r\n\r\nGalen (x. 450) says, in comminuted fracture of the skull we must make a\r\nway for the lenticular with the bone forceps (διὰ τῆς ὀστάγρας); and in\r\ndepressed fracture Paul (VI. xc) says:\r\n\r\n    'If the bone is strong it is first to be perforated with the drills\r\n    called abaptista and the fractured bone is to be removed in fragments,\r\n    with the fingers if possible, if not, with a tooth forceps or a bone\r\n    forceps' (ὀδοντάγρα ἢ ὀστάγρα).\r\n\r\nSoranus (lxiv. p. 366) says that in impaction of the foetal cranium the\r\nhead may be opened with a sharp instrument and the pieces of the skull\r\nremoved with tooth or bone forceps (ὀδοντάγρας ἢ ὀστάγρας). Aetius copies\r\nthis (IV. iv. 24) and so does Paul (VI. lxxiv).\r\n\r\nAn excellent specimen of the sequestrum forceps was found in the house of\r\nthe physician at Pompeii, and is now in the Museum at Naples (No. 78,029).\r\nIt is formed of two crossed branches moving on a pivot. The handles are\r\nsquare, the jaws are curved, and have across the inside of them parallel\r\ngrooves which oppose each other accurately (Pl. XLIII). It is classed in\r\nthe catalogue as an instrument for crushing calculus of the bladder. This\r\nis, however, not a manipulation which is described by the ancients. The\r\nonly case in which splitting of calculi is referred to is in Celsus, and\r\nthen a chisel is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Varix Extractor._\r\n\r\nAn instrument, apparently a forceps, for extracting varicose veins in\r\nsegments is mentioned by Galen:\r\n\r\n    'And with regard to varices in the legs, first having mapped them out\r\n    on the surface with scarifications, then setting about the operation,\r\n    taking hold of the skin we divide it first. Then pulling up the varix\r\n    with a hook we tie it, and, doing this at all the cuts in the skin,\r\n    and cutting the ends, we either remove it with a varix extractor\r\n    (κιρσουλκῷ) or, taking hold of it with a doubled thread, we draw it\r\n    through the channel of the varix after the manner of flaying' (xiv.\r\n    790).\r\n\r\nCelsus (VII. xxxi) directs us to expose the vein and raise it by a blunt\r\nhook at intervals of four finger breadths, and divide the vein at one hook\r\nand pull the vein out at the next place. Galen, however, indicates that\r\nthere was a special instrument for the purpose, and this can scarcely have\r\nbeen anything else than a forceps of some kind. The operation must have\r\nbeen excessively painful. Pliny (xi. 104) remarks that C. Marius was the\r\nonly man who had undergone it in the upright position.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blacksmith's Tongs._\r\n\r\nLatin, _vulsella quali fabri utuntur_.\r\n\r\nFor replacing a protruding bone in a case of compound fracture Celsus\r\n(VIII. x) says that a forceps such as smiths use may be employed:\r\n\r\n    Tum ipsum recondendum est; ac, si id manus facere non potest, vulsella\r\n    quali fabri utuntur iniicienda est, recte se habenti capiti ab ea\r\n    parte qua sima est; ut ea parte qua gibba est eminens os in suam sedem\r\n    compellat.\r\n\r\n    'Then it is to be replaced, and if that cannot be done by hand the\r\n    forceps such as smiths use is to be inserted, the head being kept\r\n    straight by the snub-nosed part so that the curved part forces the\r\n    bone into position.'\r\n\r\nThe blacksmith's tongs is very frequently represented in ancient art. Pl.\r\nXLII, fig. 2 shows a forceps from Roman London in the Guildhall Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tooth and Stump Forceps._\r\n\r\nGreek, ὀδοντάγρα, ῥιζάγρα.\r\n\r\nThe ancients regarded tooth extraction as an operation to be avoided\r\nwherever possible. Caelius Aurelianus says death had followed in some\r\ncases, and that in the temple of Apollo at Delos there hung a tooth\r\nforceps of lead as a reminder for operators to exert little force in tooth\r\nextraction (_Pass. Tard._ II. iv). Scribonius Largus (_Comp._ liii) is\r\nequally pessimistic:\r\n\r\n    Ad dentium dolorem quamvis plurimi dicant forcipes remedium esse,\r\n    multa tamen citra hanc necessitatem scio profuisse.\r\n\r\nCelsus (VII. xii) says extraction may result in injury to the temples and\r\neyes, and fracture or dislocation of the jaw may occur. He recommends\r\ntherefore to free the tooth all round down to the socket, then to shake it\r\nrepeatedly till it has been thoroughly loosened, and remove it with\r\nfingers or forceps. If the tooth be hollow, it should be plugged with lint\r\nor lead to prevent it breaking under the forceps. The tooth should be\r\npulled out straight, lest the alveolus be broken. Stumps are to be removed\r\nwith the forceps which the Greeks call ῥιζάγρα. Paulus Aegineta (VI.\r\nxxvii) bids us scarify down to the socket and loosen the tooth gradually\r\nby shaking with a tooth extractor (ὀδοντάγρα) and extract it.\r\nSupernumerary teeth are, if fast, to be rasped down with a graving tool;\r\nif loose, to be extracted with tooth forceps (διὰ τῆς ὀδοντάγρας). There\r\nis no ancient forceps which can with certainty be set down as a tooth\r\nforceps, although some have looked upon the Pompeian forceps (see p. 135)\r\nas a tooth extractor. Although its shape is not otherwise unsuitable for\r\nthis purpose its jaws are not particularly well adapted for seizing a\r\ntooth, as they are not hollowed inside. It may be noted that the tooth\r\nforceps was evidently a 'universal', as no special variety is ever\r\nmentioned beyond the two I have given--'tooth' and 'stump'. Whatever the\r\nshape of the Graeco-Roman forceps was it seems to have been a handy\r\ninstrument for many different manipulations. Soranus (ii. 63) says that in\r\nimpaction of the foetal cranium we may open the head and remove the bones\r\nwith a bone forceps or a tooth forceps (ὀστάγρας ἢ ὀδοντάγρας). Paul (VI.\r\nxc) says that in fracture of the skull the fragment is to be surrounded\r\nwith perforations by the drill and finally separated with chisels, the\r\nchips being removed with the fingers or with tooth forceps, bone forceps,\r\n&c. (ὀδοντάγρα ἢ ὀστάγρα). Again in ch. lxxxviii he says that if the shaft\r\nof a weapon imbedded in the flesh be broken off, the weapon may be\r\nextracted with a tooth forceps or a stump forceps (ὀδοντάγρας ἢ ῥιζάγρας).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tooth Elevator._\r\n\r\nIn a note on a passage in Hippocrates describing the lever for replacing\r\nthe protruding end of a fractured bone, Galen mentions an instrument for\r\nlevering teeth. He says the instruments for levering the bone are of the\r\nsame size as the instrument for levering teeth (xviii. 593). As we know\r\nfrom Paul (VI. cvi) that these bone levers were seven or eight finger\r\nbreadths in length, we may take this as the length of the tooth elevator.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tooth Scalers._\r\n\r\nGreek, ξυστήριον, σμιλίον, σμιλιώτον (sc. ὄργανον); Latin, _scalper\r\nmedicinalis_.\r\n\r\nPaul (VI. xxviii) mentions a small raspatory used for removing tartar from\r\nteeth:\r\n\r\n    'The scaly concretions which adhere to teeth we may remove with the\r\n    scoop of a specillum, or with a scaler (ξυστηρίῳ) or a file.'\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus (_Comp._ liii) mentions an excavator:\r\n\r\n    Itaque cum etiam exesus est aliqua ex parte, tum non suadeo protinus\r\n    tollendum, sed excidendum scalpro medicinali, qua cavatus est, quod\r\n    sine ullo fit dolore, reliqua enim solida pars eius et speciem et usum\r\n    dentis praestabit.\r\n\r\nMarcellus conveys this passage entire (_De Med._ xii).\r\n\r\nPaul (VI. xii) says supernumerary teeth may be cut down with excavators\r\n(τῶν σμιλιωτῶν).\r\n\r\n\r\n_File._\r\n\r\nGreek, ῥινάριον, ῥίνη, ῥινίον; Latin, _lima_, _limula_.\r\n\r\nIn compound fracture with protrusion of bone Celsus says:\r\n\r\n    'Should any small piece of bone protrude, if it is blunt it should be\r\n    reduced to its place. If it is sharp its point should first be cut off\r\n    if it is long, and if short it should be filed. \"In either case it\r\n    should be smoothed with the raspatory.\"' (Si longius est,\r\n    praecidendum; si brevius, limandum, et utrumque scalpro laevandum.)\r\n\r\nThe application of the raspatory to smooth the bone after the use of the\r\nfile shows that it must have been more of the nature of a rasp than a file\r\nwhich was used for bones. Scribonius Largus speaks of a wood file or rasp\r\nused in reducing a hart's horn to powder (_Comp._ cxli):\r\n\r\n    Ad lumbricos satis commode facit et santonica herba, quae non viget,\r\n    et cornum cervinum limatum lima lignaria.\r\n\r\nFiles were largely used in dental work. All the surgeons state that where\r\na tooth projects above its fellows it should be filed down; Galen says\r\nthat for this purpose he has invented an olivary pointed file of steel:\r\nσιδήριον ἐποίησα ῥινίον πυρηνοειδές (xiv. 871).\r\n\r\nAetius copies Galen's chapter word for word (II. iv. 30). Paul (VI.\r\nxxviii) says the file (ῥινάριον) may be used to remove tartar from teeth.\r\n\r\nThere are several files of steel in the Naples Museum which are classed\r\namong the surgical instruments. Many Roman files of steel which have been\r\nfound in London are now in the Guildhall Museum. Some of these have\r\ntransverse edges like our own files. Other extant specimens have coarse\r\nfrets on them, like our wood rasps. Pl. XLII. fig. 1 shows one in the\r\nGuildhall collection, which is of the rasp variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Forceps for extracting Weapons._\r\n\r\nGreek, βελουλκόν (sc. ὄργανον).\r\n\r\nPaul has a most interesting chapter on the extraction of weapons, and in\r\nit he mentions a special instrument for extracting weapons, evidently a\r\nforceps:\r\n\r\n    'If the head of the weapon has fixed in the flesh, it is to be drawn\r\n    out with the hands, or by laying hold of the appendage which is called\r\n    the shaft, if it has not fallen off. This part is commonly made of\r\n    wood. When it has fallen off we make the extraction by means of a\r\n    tooth forceps, or a stump forceps, or a forceps for extracting weapons\r\n    (βελουλκοῦ), or any other convenient instrument. And sometimes we make\r\n    an incision in the flesh around it in the first place, if the wound do\r\n    not admit the instrument' (VI. lxxxvii).\r\n\r\nIt is true that etymologically we are only entitled to translate βελουλκοῦ\r\nby 'weapon-extractor', but its association with the other two forceps\r\nshows pretty conclusively that a forceps is meant, and Celsus says weapons\r\nare to be extracted with the forceps under similar conditions. In the\r\npicture of Aeneas wounded, found in a house at Stabiae and now in the\r\nNaples Museum, the surgeon, Iapix, is engaged in extracting a weapon from\r\nthe wound in the thigh of the hero. The instrument he is using is a long\r\nforceps with crossed legs (Pl. XLIV).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Periosteal Elevator for the Pericranium._\r\n\r\nGreek, ὑποσπαθιστήρ, σπαθιστήρ.\r\n\r\nThe hypospathister was an elevator for separating the pericranium from the\r\ncalvarium. It gave the name to a formidable operation in which it was\r\nused, viz. hypospathismus. This operation is described by Galen, Aetius,\r\nand Paul, by the latter (VI. vi) best of all. Paul is the only one who\r\nmentions the instrument by name. The operation consisted in making three\r\nvertical incisions, one down each side of the forehead and one down the\r\ncentre. Next the skin was raised along with the pericranium from the whole\r\nof the front of the forehead with the hypospathister (ὑποσπαθιστήρ), and\r\nthe vessels lying in the raised flaps were subcutaneously divided by a\r\nknife passed under them, with its back to the skull. The elevator by which\r\nthe pericranium was separated is called by Paul ὑποσπαθιστήρ. The\r\noperation is mentioned by Epiphanius, a bishop of Alexandria in the fourth\r\ncentury, by whom the instrument is referred to as σπαθιστήρ.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Impellent._\r\n\r\nGreek, διωστήρ.\r\n\r\nIn his chapter on the extraction of weapons, one of the most remarkable\r\nchapters in the whole of his works, Paul mentions an impellent for forcing\r\nan arrow head through a part so as to extract it at the side opposite to\r\nthat by which it went in.\r\n\r\n    'If the head of the weapon has passed to the other side and it is\r\n    found impossible to extract it by the way it entered, having divided\r\n    the parts opposite we extract it through the middle of them, either\r\n    extracting it in the manner spoken of (i. e. with forceps), or we make\r\n    an opening by means of the weapon itself, pushing it by the shaft, or,\r\n    if that has come away, by an impellent instrument (διωστῆρος), taking\r\n    care not to divide a nerve, artery, vein, or any important part; for\r\n    it would be malpractice if, in extracting the weapon, we should do\r\n    more mischief than the weapon itself had done. If the weapon has a\r\n    tang, which is ascertained by examination with the probe, having\r\n    introduced the female part of the impellent instrument and engaged it,\r\n    we push the weapon forwards, or, if it has a socket, the male part'\r\n    (τὴν θήλειαν τοῦ διωστῆρος καθέντες καὶ ἐναρμόσαντες ὠθήσομεν τὸ βέλος\r\n    εἰ δὲ αὐλὸν τὸν ἄρρενα).\r\n\r\nImpellents formed an important part of the armamentarium of the surgeon,\r\nat least down to the time of Scultetus, and in his works and in those of\r\nAlbucasis and Paré there are numerous figures of these instruments. None\r\nof these quite agree with the idea of the instrument which one gathers\r\nfrom Paul's description. It would seem to have been a very simple affair,\r\nprobably a plain rod of metal pointed at one end and hollowed at the\r\nother, the pointed end being introduced into the socket of an arrow where\r\nit possessed one, the hollow end being fitted over the tip of the tang in\r\ncases where the arrow was tanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arrow Scoop._\r\n\r\nGreek, κυαθίσκος Διοκλεῖος.\r\n\r\nA scoop for extracting arrow heads is thus described by Celsus (VII. v):\r\n\r\n    Latum vero telum, si conditum est, ab altera parte educi non expedit,\r\n    ne ingenti vulneri ipsi quoque ingens vulnus adiiciamus. Evellendum\r\n    est ergo genere quodam ferramenti quod Διοκλείου κυαθίσκον Graeci\r\n    vocant, quoniam auctorem Dioclem habet: quem inter priscos maximosque\r\n    medicos fuisse iam posui. Lamina, vel ferrea vel etiam aenea, ab\r\n    altero capite duos utrimque deorsum conversos uncos habet; ab altero\r\n    duplicata lateribus, leviterque extrema in eam partem inclinata quae\r\n    sinuata est, insuper ibi etiam perforata est. Haec iuxta telum\r\n    transversa demittitur; deinde ubi ad imum mucronem ventum est paulum\r\n    torquetur, ut telum foramine suo excipiat; quum in cavo mucro est, duo\r\n    digiti subiecti partis alterius uncis simul et ferramentum id\r\n    extrahunt et telum.\r\n\r\n    'But a broad weapon if buried should not be extracted from a counter\r\n    opening, lest to one large wound we add another; therefore it is to be\r\n    extracted with a special variety of instrument which the Greeks call\r\n    the Scoop of Diocles, since Diocles invented it. I have already stated\r\n    that he was one of the most eminent of the old practitioners. Its\r\n    blade of iron, or even of bronze, has at one end two hooks, one at\r\n    each side turned backwards. At the other end it is folded over at the\r\n    sides, and the end is slightly curved up towards that part which is\r\n    bent. Moreover in it there is a perforation. This is introduced\r\n    crosswise near the weapon, then when it comes near the point it is\r\n    twisted a little so that it receives the point in the hole. When the\r\n    weapon is in the cavity two fingers placed under the hooks at the\r\n    other end simultaneously extract both the instrument and the weapon.'\r\n\r\nThis description seems very definite until we attempt to reconstruct the\r\ninstrument, when it becomes evident that more than one construction may be\r\nput on some parts of it. Pl. XLV, fig. 4, shows the instrument as\r\nconceived by me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nBLADDER AND GYNAECOLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Catheter._\r\n\r\nThe catheter is very frequently referred to. Galen (xiv. 787) thus\r\ndescribes it:\r\n\r\n    'When urine is not passed on account of excessive dilatation of the\r\n    bladder so that it cannot contract, we draw off the urine with a\r\n    catheter. Therefore an instrument like the Roman letter S is let down\r\n    into the bladder by the urethra. A thread is passed into it which has\r\n    in its tip a little wool dipped in urine. Then it is drawn out and the\r\n    urine follows it like a guide.'\r\n\r\nThis method of preparing the catheter and the reasons for so doing are\r\ndiscussed at somewhat greater length in the following selection from Paul\r\n(VI. xix):\r\n\r\n    'Wherefore taking a catheter proportionate to the age and sex we\r\n    prepare the instrument for use. The mode of preparation is this:\r\n    having bound a little wool round with a thread and introduced the\r\n    thread by means of a sharp rush into the pipe of the catheter, and\r\n    having cut off the projecting parts of the wool with a pair of\r\n    scissors, we put the catheter into oil. Having then placed the patient\r\n    on a convenient seat and used fomentation, if there be no\r\n    contra-indication we take the catheter and introduce it direct down to\r\n    the base of the penis, then we must draw the penis up to the umbilicus\r\n    (for at this part there is a bend in the passage), and in this\r\n    position push the instrument onwards. When in the perinaeum it\r\n    approaches the anus we must bend the penis with the instrument in it\r\n    down to its natural position, for from the perinaeum to the bladder\r\n    the passage is upwards, and we must push the instrument onwards till\r\n    we reach the cavity of the bladder. We afterwards take out the thread\r\n    fastened into the opening of the catheter, in order that the urine,\r\n    being attracted by the wool, may follow as happens in syphons.'\r\n\r\nIt is occasionally, in cases of cancer of the prostate, of service to\r\nadopt this proceeding to prevent the eye of the catheter from getting\r\nblocked before the bladder is entered, but it is strange that Galen should\r\nhave fallen into the mistake of thinking that it is necessary to set up a\r\nsyphon action, as he was well aware of the expulsive power possessed by\r\nthe bladder; in fact, his explanation of the physiology of urination is\r\nalmost up to date.\r\n\r\nCelsus gives a good description of the catheter both male and female (VII.\r\nxxvi):\r\n\r\n    Res vero interdum cogit emoliri manu urinam, quum illa non redditur,\r\n    aut quia senectute iter eius collapsum est, aut quia calculus vel\r\n    concretum aliquid ex sanguine intus se opposuit: ac mediocris quoque\r\n    inflammatio saepe eam reddi naturaliter prohibet. Idque non in viris\r\n    tantummodo, sed in feminis quoque interdum necessarium est. Ergo\r\n    aeneae fistulae fiunt; quae ut omni corpori ampliori minorique\r\n    sufficiant, ad mares tres, ad feminas duae medico habendae sunt; ex\r\n    virilibus maxima decem et quinque digitorum, media duodecim, minima\r\n    novem, ex muliebribus maior novem, minor sex. Incurvas vero esse eas\r\n    paulum, sed magis viriles, oportet, laevesque admodum; ac neque nimis\r\n    plenas neque nimis tenues.\r\n\r\nThere are fine specimens of the catheter, both male and female, in the\r\nNaples Museum. The male catheter is from the 'House of the Physician' in\r\nPompeii. It is 24 cm. in length and is about the size of a No. 11 English.\r\nIt has two gentle curves, so that it closely resembles the instrument\r\nreintroduced by Petit in the eighteenth century. See Pl. XLV, fig. 1. A\r\ncatheter of similar shape, but broken in three pieces, was found by some\r\nworkmen at Baden in the Seventies. They were given by Dr. Wagner, of\r\nBaden, to Mr. Atkinson, M.P., London, and are possibly now in some English\r\ncollection (Brunner, _op. cit._ p. 42).\r\n\r\nIn the excavation of the Roman Military Hospital at Baden, 1893, a\r\nfragment of a catheter was found, and is now in the possession of M.\r\nKellersberger. It consists of the curved part of a catheter, and it is 13\r\ncm. long and about the size of a No. 10 English. The curve is\r\nconsiderably greater than that of the Naples specimen (Un Hôpital\r\nMilitaire Romain, planche ix).\r\n\r\nThe female catheter in the Naples Museum is 0·98 m. long, and of the same\r\ndiameter as the male one. It is straight (Pl. XLV, fig. 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bladder Sounds._\r\n\r\nHad the ancients solid bladder sounds? They must have been well aware of\r\nthe characteristic grating sensation conveyed to the skilled hand on\r\nstriking a stone with a metal instrument, for we have several references\r\nin the classics to the manœuvre of pushing back, by means of a catheter, a\r\nstone impacted in the urethra. Rufus of Ephesus (Περὶ λιθιώσης κύστεως)\r\nsays of impacted urethral calculus: 'Those that are stuck fast push back\r\nwith the catheter if you prefer not to do lithotomy' (ἐρείδοντας οὖν εἰ μὴ\r\nθέλοις τέμνειν ἀπῶσαι τῷ αὐλίσκῳ). Soranus (II. xviii) says if a stone is\r\nthe cause of dystocia we must push it out of the neck of the bladder into\r\nthe bladder with a catheter (καθετήρ). The word Rufus uses puts it beyond\r\ndoubt that a hollow tube is meant, or we might have argued that καθετήρ\r\ndid not necessarily mean a hollow tube, since Hippocrates uses it in the\r\nsense of a uterine plug (ii. 830). Yet strange to say, the sensation\r\nconveyed to the hand and ear on striking a stone with a metal instrument\r\nis nowhere definitely given as a cardinal symptom by a classical writer.\r\n\r\nRufus describes the symptoms of vesical calculus at length and finishes\r\nwith instructions for searching the bladder. The word he uses (μήλωσις) at\r\nfirst sight seems to indicate that this was done with a sound, but it\r\nturns out to be bimanual rectal examination only which he describes. The\r\nuse of the sound as a staff in lithotomy, or as a dilator of a strictured\r\nurethra, was not known to the ancients, and thus we have no evidence from\r\nthe literature that a solid bougie existed. Some instruments have come\r\ndown to us, however, which seem undoubted solid bladder sounds. There are\r\nthree sounds of bronze in the Naples Museum, which have the identical\r\nappearance of our modern bladder sounds. It might be argued that these\r\nhave not quite the shape of the catheter described by the ancients, but\r\nthere is an instrument in the Mainz Museum against which even this\r\nobjection cannot be brought. It is a solid sound of the double curvature\r\ndescribed by Celsus, and is identical in shape with the catheter from the\r\nPompeian surgeon's house (Pl. XLV, fig. 3).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lithotomy Scoop._\r\n\r\nGreek, λιθουλκός; Latin, _uncus_, _ferramentum quo in sectione calculus\r\nprotrahitur_.\r\n\r\nCelsus thus describes the extraction of calculus through a perineal\r\nincision by means of a lithotomy scoop:\r\n\r\n    Quum vero ea patefacta est, in conspectum calculus venit; in cuius\r\n    colore nullum discrimen est. Ipse si exiguus est, digitis ab altera\r\n    parte propelli, ab altera protrahi potest; si maior, iniiciendus a\r\n    superiore parte uncus est, eius rei causa factus. Is est ad extremum\r\n    tenuis, in semicirculi speciem retusae latitudinis; ab exteriore parte\r\n    laevis, qua corpori iungitur; ab interiore asper, qua calculum\r\n    attingit. Isque longior potius esse debet; nam brevis extrahendi vim\r\n    non habet. Ubi iniectus est in utrumque latus inclinandus est, ut\r\n    appareat an calculus teneatur; quia si apprehensus est, ille simul\r\n    inclinatur.\r\n\r\n    'When it is opened there comes into view the calculus, the colour of\r\n    which is unmistakeable. If it is small it is to be pushed by the\r\n    fingers from one side and pulled from the other. If too large the hook\r\n    for the purpose is to be put in above it. The hook is slender at the\r\n    end and flattened out in the shape of a semicircle, smooth externally\r\n    where it comes in contact with the tissues, rough internally where it\r\n    meets the calculus. The hook should be pretty long, for a short one\r\n    has no power of extraction. When it has been inserted it should be\r\n    inclined to either side, so that it may be seen whether the calculus\r\n    is caught, because if it is held it also is inclined to the side'\r\n    (VII. xxvii).\r\n\r\nThe above passage gives a very complete account of the lithotomy scoop.\r\nThe only thing it leaves undecided is the breadth. Was it a broad,\r\nspoon-like scoop, or was it a hook-like instrument? That the latter was\r\nthe case is proved by the following passage also from Celsus (VII. xxvi):\r\n\r\n    Nonnunquam etiam prolapsus in ipsam fistulam calculus: quia subinde ea\r\n    extenuatur non longe ab exitu inhaerescit. Eum, si fieri potest,\r\n    oportet evellere vel oriculario specillo, vel eo ferramento quo in\r\n    sectione calculus protrahitur.\r\n\r\n    'Sometimes also a stone slips into the urethra itself and lodges near\r\n    the meatus, because at that part there is a constriction. It should if\r\n    possible be extracted either with an ear probe, or with the instrument\r\n    for the extraction of calculus in lithotomy.'\r\n\r\nThis shows that the scoop must have been quite a narrow instrument, or it\r\ncould not have passed into the urethra. It must have had very much the\r\nsame appearance as the modern 'Ferguson's Scoop'. We have two extant\r\nspecimens of the ancient lithotomy scoop in the Naples Museum, one of\r\nwhich is shown in Pl. IV; and in the marble _ex voto_ tablet in the Athens\r\nMuseum, to which I have already referred, there is a representation of a\r\nmanubriolus curved so as to serve as a lithotomy scoop (Pl. XLVI, fig. 2).\r\nRufus of Ephesus mentions this form of scalpel handle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lithotomy Forceps._\r\n\r\nWas there a forceps for extracting calculus from the bladder? The\r\nsixteenth-century translation of Aetius (IV. iv. 94) by Cornarius has the\r\nfollowing passage, under the treatment of calculus in the female:\r\n\r\n    Et tunc paululum supra pudendi alas, quo loco calculus occurrit\r\n    sectionem facito et per calcularium forcipem extrahito.\r\n\r\nThe original Greek of this part of Aetius has not yet been published, but\r\nfrom a pretty intimate knowledge of Cornarius's methods I have a strong\r\nsuspicion that 'calcularium forcipem' may be a free translation of\r\nλιθουλκός, as in the following passage in Paul:\r\n\r\n    'Sometimes from the pressure of the finger or fingers at the anus the\r\n    stone starts out readily at the same time as the incision is made,\r\n    without requiring extraction. But if it does not of itself start out\r\n    we must extract it with the instrument called the stone extractor'\r\n    (τοῦ λιθουλκοῦ) (VI. lx).\r\n\r\nAdams translates λιθουλκός by 'forceps for extracting stone', but this is\r\nnot quite a justifiable translation. The instruments whose names end in\r\n-ουλκός, and which are derived from ἕλκω, are certainly in many instances\r\nforceps, e. g. βελουλκός, a forceps for extracting weapons, but in other\r\ncases they are as certainly not. I need only refer to ἐμβρυουλκός, which\r\nis conclusively described as a hook for extracting the dead foetus. Thus\r\nwhile it is possible that the λιθουλκός may have been a forceps, the\r\netymology of the word does not entitle us to translate by any term more\r\ndefinite than 'stone extractor'. Galen (xiv. 787) uses the word λιθολάβος,\r\nwhich has a more definite meaning. The majority of words compounded of\r\n-λάβος means some variety of forceps, e. g. σαρκολάβος, tumour vulsellum.\r\nThe etymological evidence thus leaves the matter open, with a slight\r\nbalance in favour of there having been a forceps. I should have had no\r\nhesitation in translating λιθολάβος to mean a forceps, had it not been\r\nthat Celsus evidently had no cognizance of a stone forceps. Galen,\r\nhowever, lived after Celsus, and we may note that the Arabians used such\r\nan instrument. Albucasis says that if the stone does not start out it must\r\nbe seized with a forceps or a hook, and failing removal by these means it\r\nis to be broken up with forceps. One forceps in the Naples Museum, from\r\nthe house of the physician, seems to be suited for the operation (Pl.\r\nXLVI, fig. 3). The handles are short in proportion to the blades, and it\r\nseems better suited to grasp some substance inside the bow than between\r\nthe jaws. The unfinished condition of the tips of the handles indicates\r\nthat they had been inserted into handles of wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lithotrite._\r\n\r\nLatin, _ferramentum_.\r\n\r\nA sort of chisel by which a calculus was split is thus described by\r\nCelsus:\r\n\r\n    Si quando autem is maior non videtur nisi rupta cervice extrahi posse,\r\n    findendus est; cuius repertor Ammonius ob id λιθοτόμος cognominatus\r\n    est. Id hoc modo fit: uncus iniicitur calculo sic ut facile eum\r\n    concussum quoque teneat, ne is retro revolvatur; tum ferramentum\r\n    adhibetur crassitudinis modicae, prima parte tenui, sed retusa, quod\r\n    admotum calculo, et ex altera parte ictum, eum findit.\r\n\r\n    'If at any time it seems too large and impossible to be extracted\r\n    without splitting the cervix, it is to be split. The originator of\r\n    this is Ammonius, hence called the lithotomist. It is performed in\r\n    this manner. A scoop is put over the calculus in such a way that it\r\n    easily holds it even when struck from sliding back; then there is\r\n    applied an instrument of moderate thickness, slender at the tip, but\r\n    blunt, which being placed against the calculus and struck on the other\r\n    end splits it' (VII. xxvi).\r\n\r\nThe above paragraph really gives us all the information we possess about\r\nthe instrument. It is evidently a slender chisel. A passage in Aretaeus\r\n(_Morb. Chron._ ii. 9) is held by some to refer to lithotripsy (digital).\r\nThe reading, however, is dubious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rectal Speculum._\r\n\r\nGreek, ἑδροδιαστολεύς, μικρὸν διόπτριον, κατοπτήρ.\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention of the rectal speculum is to be found in the treatise\r\non fistula by Hippocrates:\r\n\r\n    Ὕπτιον κατακλίνας τὸν ἄνθρωπον κατοπτῆρι κατιδὼν τὸ διαβεβρωμένον τοῦ ἀρχοῦ.\r\n\r\n    'Laying the patient on his back and examining the ulcerated part of\r\n    the bowel by means of the rectal speculum' (iii. 331).\r\n\r\nAgain, a little further on, he mentions its use in the treatment of piles;\r\nand Paul (VI. lxxviii) says:\r\n\r\n    'With regard to blind fistulae Leonidas says: \"We dilate the anus, as\r\n    we do the female vagina, with the anal or small speculum\"' (τῷ\r\n    ἑδροδιαστολεῖ (τῷ μικρῷ διοπτρίῳ λέγω) διαστεῖλαι τὴν ἕδραν ὡς γυναικεῖον κόλπον).\r\n\r\nThere is a rectal speculum in the Naples Museum (No. 78,031). It is a\r\ntwo-bladed instrument, working with a hinge in the middle. It is O·15 m.\r\nin length, and the greatest stretch of the blades is O·07 m. It represents\r\nan instrument used to dilate the vagina as well as the rectum, and got its\r\nname 'small dilator' in contradistinction to the other vaginal speculum,\r\nwhich we shall see was worked by a screw, and was called the speculum\r\nmagnum. The rectal speculum was also called κατοπτήρ, in contradistinction\r\nto the vaginal speculum which was called διόπτρα. In Galen's Lexicon they\r\nare explained as follows:\r\n\r\n    Κατοπτῆρι, τῷ καλουμένῳ ἑδροδιαστολεῖ, ὥσπερ γε καὶ διόπτρα ὁ γυναικῶν διαστολεύς.\r\n\r\n    'The catopter, which is called the anal dilator, in the same way as\r\n    the diopter is called the female dilator.'\r\n\r\nPl. XLVI, fig. 1 shows one of two similar rectal specula from Pompeii\r\n(Naples Museum).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vaginal Speculum._\r\n\r\nGreek, διόπτρα; Latin, _speculum magnum matricis_ (late).\r\n\r\nSoranus is the first author who makes mention of the speculum specially\r\nmade for the vagina. The original Greek of this chapter of Soranus is\r\nlost, but we have a Latin translation of it preserved to us by Moschion.\r\nThe heading of this chapter in Soranus, which was No. xxxiv, was Περὶ\r\nδιοπτρισμοῦ. I shall give part of this chapter from Moschion:\r\n\r\n    QUA DISCIPLINA ORGANO APERIENDAE SINT MULIERES.\r\n\r\n    Scio me retro ad inspiciendam altitudinem mulieris frequentius organi\r\n    mentionem fecisse quod Graecitas dioptran vocat. Et quoniam nisi\r\n    insinuata fuerit disciplina quatenus hoc ipsud fieri possit,\r\n    occurrente necessitate obstetrices facere non audent, idcirco placuit\r\n    nobis ut etiam hoc gynaeciis adderemus, ut ex rebus huic corpori\r\n    necessariis nihil dimisisse videamur. Itaque supinam iactans eam quae\r\n    inspici habet, accipies fasciam longam et in media parte eius duobus\r\n    laqueis factis, ita ut inter se cubitum unum habeant laquei illi,\r\n    duabus vero manibus mulieris missis, medietatem quae interest cervici\r\n    eius inducis. Deinde reliqua fasciae sub anquilas missa ad manus\r\n    alligabis, ita ut patefacti pedes ventri eius cohaereant. Deinde\r\n    accepto organo et uncto priapisco, quem Graeci loton dicunt, in\r\n    aliquantum ad prunas calefacere (debes), deinde sine quassatione\r\n    priapiscum inicere, susum scilicet axe posito, iubere etiam ministro\r\n    ut aperiendo organo axem torquere incipiat, ut paulatim partes ipsae\r\n    aperiantur. Cum vero post visum organo tollere volueris, ministro\r\n    iubere ut iterum axem torqueat quo organum claudi possit, ita tamen ut\r\n    cum adhuc in aliquantum patet sic auferatur, ne universa clusura\r\n    aliquas teneat et nocere incipiat.\r\n\r\nWe have also preserved by Paul a chapter by Archigenes on abscess of the\r\nwomb (VI. lxxiii), in which the different parts of the speculum are again\r\nnamed, and from it also we learn that there were different sizes of the\r\ninstrument proportioned to suit different ages. The patient having been\r\nfixed in the lithotomy position in the manner described by Soranus:\r\n\r\n    'The operator is to make the examination with a speculum (διόπτρα)\r\n    proportioned to the age of the patient. The person using the speculum\r\n    should measure with a probe the depth of the woman's vagina, lest the\r\n    priapiscus of the speculum (τοῦ τῆς διόπτρας λωτοῦ) being too long it\r\n    should happen that the uterus be pressed on. If it be ascertained that\r\n    the tube is longer than the woman's vagina, folded compresses are to\r\n    be laid on the labia in order that the speculum may be laid on them.\r\n    The priapiscus is to be introduced while the screw (τὸν κοχλίον) is\r\n    uppermost. The speculum is to be held by the operator. The screw is to\r\n    be turned by the assistant, so that the blades of the tube (τῶν\r\n    ἐμπλησμάτων τοῦ λωτοῦ) being separated, the vagina may be expanded.'\r\n\r\nWe have little difficulty in recognizing among the instruments found in\r\nPompeii three of the vaginal specula referred to in these passages. All\r\nare excellent specimens of the instrument maker's skill. They are in the\r\nNaples Museum. The first discovered (No. 78,030) was found in the house of\r\nthe physician at Pompeii. The blades are at right angles to the instrument\r\n(Pl. XLVII), and when closed form a tube the size of the thumb. On turning\r\nthe screw a cross-bar forces the two upper blades outwards, till\r\nsufficient dilation is got for operative purposes. The diameter of the\r\ntube at its maximum of expansion is 0·09 m. The whole instrument is 0·23\r\nm. long. Another instrument on a similar principle but with a quadrivalve\r\npriapiscus was discovered in 1882 (Pl. XLIX). It is 0·315 m. long. It is\r\nnow fixed by oxidation, so that the blades cannot be moved. On turning the\r\nscrew the lower blades could be drawn downwards, at the same time\r\nseparating slightly, while the upper blades diverged also (No. 113,264\r\nNaples Mus.). Lately a third, similar to that shown in Pl. XLVII, has been\r\nfound in Pompeii. Note that the screw in the three-bladed instrument is a\r\nleft-handed one. That in the four-bladed instrument is right-handed. This\r\ncauses right-handed motion to open the instrument in either case. There\r\nis, however, an instrument similar to these trivalve instruments in the\r\nmuseum at Athens. It differs in having the screw right-handed (Pl.\r\nXLVIII). Mr. Bosanquet, late of the British Institute of Archaeology at\r\nAthens, was kind enough to procure me a photograph of this instrument, but\r\nhe tells me that there is no satisfactory account of its provenance and\r\nits authenticity is doubtful. It seems possible that it is a copy of one\r\nof the Naples specimens by some one who has omitted to observe that the\r\nscrew in these is left-handed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Traction Hook for Embryo._\r\n\r\nGreek, ἐμβρυουλκός; Latin, _uncus_.\r\n\r\nCelsus has an interesting chapter on the removal of the foetus in\r\ndifficult labour. He says (VII. xxix):\r\n\r\n    Tum, si caput proximum est, demitti debet uncus undique laevis,\r\n    acuminis brevis, qui vel oculo, vel auri, vel ori, interdum etiam\r\n    fronti recte iniicitur; deinde attractus infantem educit. Neque tamen\r\n    quolibet is tempore extrahi debet. Nam, si compresso vulvae ore id\r\n    tentatum est, non emittente eo, infans abrumpitur, et unci acumen in\r\n    ipsum os vulvae delabitur; sequiturque nervorum distentio, et ingens\r\n    periculum mortis. Igitur, compressa vulva, conquiescere; hiante,\r\n    leniter trahere oportet; et per has occasiones paulatim eum educere.\r\n    Trahere autem dextra manus uncum; sinistra intus posita infantem\r\n    ipsum, simulque dirigere eum debet.\r\n\r\n    'Then if the head presents there ought to be inserted a hook, smooth\r\n    all round, with a short point which is properly fixed in the eye or\r\n    the ear or the mouth, sometimes even in the forehead, which being\r\n    drawn on extracts the child. Nor is it to be drawn on without regard\r\n    to circumstance. For if the attempt is made with an undilated cervix,\r\n    not getting exit the foetus is broken up, and the point of the hook\r\n    catches on the cervix and inflammation follows and much danger of\r\n    death. Therefore, it is necessary with a contracted cervix to wait\r\n    quietly, with a dilated one to make gentle traction, and during these\r\n    times to extract it gradually. The right hand ought to make the\r\n    traction on the hook, the left place inside to draw the child and at\r\n    the same time to direct it.'\r\n\r\nThe following passage in Soranus shows that it was customary also to\r\ninsert a second hook opposite the first and to make traction on both at\r\nthe same time:\r\n\r\n    'The best places for the insertion of the hooks are in head\r\n    presentations, the eyes, the occiput, and the mouth, the clavicles,\r\n    and the parts about the ribs. In footling cases the pubes, ribs, and\r\n    clavicles, are the best. Warm oil having been applied as a lubricant\r\n    the hook is to be held in the right hand; the curvature concealed in\r\n    the left hand is to be carefully introduced into the uterus, and\r\n    plunged into some of the places mentioned till it pierce right through\r\n    to the hollow part beneath. Then a second one is to be put in opposite\r\n    to it (καταπείρειν δὲ καὶ ἀντίθετον τούτῳ δεύτερον), in order that the\r\n    pulling may be straight and not one-sided' (II. xix).\r\n\r\nAetius (IV. iv. 23) and Paul (VI. lxxiv) copy this.\r\n\r\nHippocrates (ii. 701) bids us break up the head with a cephalotribe in\r\nsuch a way as not to splinter the bones, and remove the bones with bone\r\nforceps; or, a traction hook (τῷ ἑλκυστῆρι) being inserted near the\r\nclavicle so as to hold, make traction but not much at once, but little by\r\nlittle, withdrawing and again inserting it.\r\n\r\nThere are three traction hooks from Pompeii in the Naples Museum. One of\r\nthese is given in Pl. L, fig. 1. They are of steel, with handles of\r\nbronze. Hooks on the same principle, and differing in appearance very\r\nlittle from the Pompeian hooks, are still used by veterinary surgeons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Decapitator._\r\n\r\nOf transverse presentations, Celsus says:\r\n\r\n    Remedio est cervix praecisa; ut separatim utraque pars auferatur. Id\r\n    unco fit, qui, priori similis, in interiore tantum parte per totam\r\n    aciem exacuitur. Tum id agendum est ut ante caput deinde reliqua pars\r\n    auferatur.\r\n\r\n    'The treatment is to divide the neck so that each part may be\r\n    extracted separately. This is done with a hook which, though similar\r\n    to the last, is sharpened on its inside only, along its whole border.\r\n    Then we must endeavour to bring away the head first, and then the rest\r\n    of the body.'\r\n\r\nDecapitation has now given way before Caesarean section; but the\r\ndecapitator, little altered since the days of Celsus, still finds a place\r\nin surgical instrument catalogues.\r\n\r\nPaul and Aetius both mention division at the neck, but do not describe a\r\nspecial instrument. A ring knife for dismembering the foetus has already\r\nbeen discussed among the cutting instruments; but this seems to be a\r\ndifferent variety with a handle, which it is convenient to discuss in\r\nproximity to the embryo hook. Pl. L, fig. 2 shows a knife on this\r\nprinciple in the Bibliothèque Nationale.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cranioclast._\r\n\r\nGreek, πίεστρον, ἐμβρυοθλάστης, θλάστης;\r\n\r\nThe cranioclast is mentioned by Hippocrates (ii. 701).\r\n\r\n    Σχίσαντα τὴν κεφαλὴν μαχαιρίῳ ξυμπλάσαι ἵνα μὴ θραύσῃ τῷ πιέστρῳ καὶ\r\n    τὰ ὀστέα ἕλκειν τῷ ὀστεουλκῷ.\r\n\r\n    'Opening the head with a scalpel, break it up with the cranioclast in\r\n    such a way as not to splinter it into fragments, and remove the bones\r\n    with a bone forceps.'\r\n\r\nThe nature of the cranioclast is pretty well indicated by this passage,\r\nand in Galen's Lexicon we find πιέστρῳ defined as τῷ ἐμβρυοθλάστῃ\r\nκαλουμένῳ. I give drawings from Albucasis of a 'forceps to crush the\r\nchild's head' (Pl. LI, fig. 3).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cephalotribe._\r\n\r\nWhether or not the instrument last described was used also for the\r\noperation of cephalotripsy, or whether there was a special instrument, we\r\ncannot say, but it is certain that the operation of crushing the head and\r\ndelivering the child without removing the bones was practised. In Aetius\r\n(IV. iv. 23) cephalotripsy is thus described:\r\n\r\n    'But if the foetus be doubled on itself and cannot be straightened, if\r\n    the head is presenting, break up the bones of it without cutting the\r\n    skin. Then to some part of it fix on a traction hook and make\r\n    traction, and the legs becoming straightened out we get it away.'\r\n\r\nThough there is an essential difference between the operations of\r\ncephalotripsy and cranioclasie there is no essential difference between\r\nthe instruments necessary for carrying out the same, and it is possible\r\nthat the instrument used may be the same as the last. The cephalotribe\r\nfigured by Albucasis is not essentially different from his cranioclast\r\n(see Pl. LI, fig. 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Midwifery Forceps._\r\n\r\nHad the Greeks and Romans a forceps for extracting the child alive?\r\nProbably not. We have no mention of any such instrument by Soranus or\r\nPaul, both accomplished obstetricians, nor can any description of such an\r\ninstrument be found in the voluminous pseudo-Hippocratic works on women.\r\nAdams, in a note to Paul, III. lxxvi, says that though the Roman and Greek\r\nwriters do not mention the forceps, Avicenna does so, and he says that a\r\nforceps was dug up in the house of an obstetrix at Pompeii bearing a\r\nconsiderable resemblance to the modern forceps. The only passage I have\r\nmet with in the slightest degree supporting the notion that the ancients\r\never delivered the child alive with instruments is one in the\r\npseudo-Hippocratic treatise _De Superfoetatione_, where we are told that:\r\n\r\n    'If the woman has a difficult labour, and the child delay long in the\r\n    passage and be born not easily but with difficulty and with the\r\n    mechanical aids (μηχαναῖς) of the physician, such children are of weak\r\n    vitality, and the umbilical cord should not be cut till they make\r\n    water or sneeze or cry' (i. 465).\r\n\r\nWe are not entitled to translate μηχαναῖς by 'instruments', because it may\r\nmean any mechanical aid such as a fillet, or even assistance with the\r\nfingers of the accoucheur; but, even granting that it refers to\r\ninstruments, it might mean no more than, e. g., the embryo hooks already\r\ndescribed. With them, terrible as they were, the child must frequently\r\nhave been born alive, though mutilated. A child would have had a far\r\nbetter chance of being born alive with them than with the murderously\r\ntoothed forceps of Albucasis (Pl. XLI, figs. 3, 4), with which probably no\r\nchild could have been born alive. As regards the statement that Avicenna\r\nknew of the forceps, his directions are that the fillet is to be applied,\r\nand, if that fail, the forceps is to be put on and the child extracted\r\nwith it. If that fail, the child is to be extracted by incision, as in the\r\ncase of a dead foetus. This passage, says Adams, puts it beyond doubt that\r\nthe Arabians were acquainted with the method of extracting the child alive\r\nwith the forceps.\r\n\r\nThis is, however, not quite correct. A full consideration of Avicenna's\r\nwords seems to me to lead to the conclusion that he is describing no more\r\nthan extraction with a craniotomy forceps. If the forceps fail the child\r\nis to be extracted by incision, as in the case of a foetus already dead\r\n(and decomposed so that the forceps would not hold).\r\n\r\nAs regards Adams' statement that a forceps like ours was dug up in Pompeii\r\none may ask, 'Where is that forceps now?' It is certainly not in the\r\nNaples Museum, where all the finds from Herculaneum and Pompeii have been\r\nstored since the excavations were commenced. Adams has probably been\r\nmisled by some notice of the 'Pompeian forceps' (Pl. XLIII), which many\r\nconsider adapted for removing the cranial bones when the child's head is\r\nbroken up in cephalotripsy. It is, however, a sequestrum forceps.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Uterine Curette._\r\n\r\nHippocrates (ed. Van der Linden, vol. ii, p. 394) says:\r\n\r\n    If the menses form thrombi ... we must wind the skin of a vulture or a\r\n    piece of vellum round a curette and curette the os uteri (καὶ περὶ\r\n    ξύστραν περιειλίξας γυπὸς δέρμα ἢ ὑμένα, διαξύειν τὸ στόμα τῶν μητρέων).\r\n\r\nξύστρα may of course mean the strigil, and some forms of strigil, such as\r\nthe one shown in Pl. XXV, fig. 1, are not ill adapted for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Instrument for destroying foetus in utero._\r\n\r\nGreek, ἐμβρυοσφάκτης; Latin, _aeneum spiculum_.\r\n\r\nApart from the destruction of the foetus in criminal abortion, which was\r\nso common at Rome in the time of the Empire, we have mention of an\r\ninstrument for legitimately producing the death of the foetus from humane\r\nmotives before forced delivery. It is mentioned by Tertullian in his\r\nsermon _De Anima_, and the passage is so interesting that I give it in\r\nfull. It is, moreover, an example of the unexpected places in which\r\ninformation regarding the surgery of the ancients crops up. Tertullian is\r\narguing that the foetus is alive in utero, and does not, as others hold,\r\nsimply take on life in the act of birth, and to support his conclusions he\r\nuses the following argument:\r\n\r\n    Denique et mortui eduntur quomodo, nisi et vivi? qui autem et mortui,\r\n    nisi qui prius vivi? Atquin et in ipso adhuc utero infans trucidatur\r\n    necessaria crudelitate, quum in exitu obliquatus denegat partum;\r\n    matricida, ni moriturus. Itaque et inter arma medicorum et organon\r\n    est, quo prius patescere secreta coguntur tortili temperamento, cum\r\n    anulo cultrato, quo intus membra caeduntur anxio arbitrio, cum hebete\r\n    unco, quo totum facinus extrahitur violento puerperio. Est etiam\r\n    aeneum spiculum, quo iugulatio ipsa dirigitur caeco latrocinio;\r\n    ἐμβρυοσφάκτην appellant de infanticidii officio, utique viventis\r\n    infantis peremptorium. Hoc et Hippocrates habuit et Asclepiades et\r\n    Erasistratus et maiorum quoque prosector Herophilus et mitior ipse\r\n    Soranus, certi animal esse conceptum, atque ita miserti infelicissimae\r\n    huiusmodi infantiae, ut prius occidatur ne viva lanietur.\r\n\r\n    'Finally there are cases of children that are dead when they are born,\r\n    how so unless they have also lived? For who are dead unless they have\r\n    previously been alive? And yet, an infant is sometimes by an act of\r\n    necessary cruelty destroyed when yet in the womb, when owing to an\r\n    oblique presentation at birth delivery is made impossible and the\r\n    child would cause the death of the mother unless it were doomed itself\r\n    to die. And accordingly there is among the appliances of medical men\r\n    an instrument by which the private parts are dilated with a priapiscus\r\n    worked by a screw, and also a ring-knife whereby the limbs are cut off\r\n    in the womb with judicious care, and a blunt hook by which the whole\r\n    mass is extracted and a violent form of delivery in this way effected.\r\n    There is also a bronze stylet with which a secret death is inflicted;\r\n    they call it the ἐμβρυοσφάκτης (_foeticide_) from its use in\r\n    infanticide, as being fatal to a living infant. Hippocrates had this\r\n    (instrument), Asclepiades and Erasistratus, and of the ancients also\r\n    Herophilus the anatomist, and Soranus, a man of gentler character.\r\n    Who, being assured that a living thing had been conceived, mercifully\r\n    judged that an unfortunate infant of this sort should be destroyed\r\n    before birth to save it from being mangled alive.'\r\n\r\nWe have here apparently a different instrument from the embryotome, which\r\nwe saw was a form of knife. This is a pointed spike-shaped instrument. It\r\nmust have had much the shape of one of the huge bodkins in the Naples\r\nMuseum (Pl. LI, fig. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Apparatus for fumigating the Uterus and Vagina._\r\n\r\nFumigation formed an important part of the treatment of all varieties of\r\ndisease of the uterus and vagina. The notion that the uterus was an animal\r\nwithin the body which could wander about on its own initiative and which\r\nwas attracted by pleasant smells and repelled by disagreeable smells, was\r\nresponsible for much of the treatment of gynaecological diseases by the\r\nancients. To make a fumigation, Hippocrates directs us to take a vessel\r\nwhich holds about four gallons (δύο ἑκτέας), and fit a lid to it so that\r\nno vapour can escape from it. Pierce a hole in the lid, and into this\r\naperture force a reed about a cubit in length so that the vapour cannot\r\nescape along the outside of the reed. The cover is then fixed on the\r\nvessel with clay. Dig a hole about two feet deep and sufficiently large to\r\nreceive the vessel, and burn wood until the sides of the hole become very\r\nhot. After this remove the wood and larger pieces of charcoal which have\r\nmost flame, but leave the ashes and cinders. When the vessel is placed in\r\nposition, and the vapour begins to issue out, if it is too hot wait for\r\nsome time; if, however, it be of the proper temperature the reed should be\r\nintroduced into the uterine orifice and the fumigation made. Oribasius,\r\nquoting Antyllus (_Coll._ X. xix) varies the treatment somewhat by placing\r\na vessel similarly prepared underneath an obstetrical chair, which had an\r\nopening in the seat, allowing a leaden pipe connected with the tube of the\r\nfumigating vessel to be passed into the vagina.\r\n\r\nA fumigating apparatus of a more portable nature is mentioned by Soranus\r\n(xxiii) who tells us that Strato, a pupil of Erasistratus, used to place\r\nin a small vessel of silver or bronze, closed by a cover of tin, herbs of\r\nvarious kinds, and, having adjusted a small tube to the vessel, the mouth\r\nof the tube was placed in the vagina, and the vessel was then gently\r\nheated. Soranus admits that severe burning might follow this practice if\r\nunskilfully used.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pessaries._\r\n\r\nGreek, βάλανος, πεσσόν, πεσσός; Latin, _pessum_, _pessus_, _pessulum_.\r\n\r\nPessaries are frequently mentioned. They are usually bags filled with\r\nmedicaments and not mechanical supports. However, in ii. 824, Hippocrates\r\nsays that prolapse of the womb is to be reduced and the half of a\r\npomegranate is to be introduced into the vagina. Soranus says that in\r\nprolapse Diocles was accustomed to introduce into the vagina a\r\npomegranate soaked in vinegar. He also says that a large ball of wool may\r\nbe introduced after reduction, and Aetius, Oribasius, and Paul copy him.\r\n\r\nHippocrates (iii. 331) says that in cases of fistula in ano, after the\r\nintroduction of a medicated plug of lint, a pessary of horn is to be\r\ninserted (βάλανον ἐνθεὶς κερατίνην). This would appear to be partly to\r\ndistend the rectum, but partly also most likely to carry medicament, like\r\nthe leaden tubes full of medicaments which were inserted into the uterus.\r\n\r\nA pessary of bronze was found in Pompeii (Pl. LI, fig. 2), and is\r\ndescribed by Ceci. It is hollow and has a plate perforated with holes\r\n(evidently for stitching it on a band, to fix it round the body). Heister\r\nfigures a similar instrument. It is impossible to say whether this\r\nspecimen was intended for rectal or vaginal use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSUTURES, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sponge._\r\n\r\nGreek, σπόγγος; Latin, _spongia_.\r\n\r\nSponges were used for many purposes. Paul (VII. iii) says they should be\r\nfresh and still preserve the smell of the sea. They were applied with\r\nwater, wine, or oxycrate to agglutinate wounds, and also soaked in asphalt\r\nand set fire to and applied to wounds to stop haemorrhage.\r\n\r\nGalen (_De Simp._ xi) says he has seen haemorrhage stopped by applying a\r\nsponge dipped in asphalt to a bleeding wound and setting fire to it, and\r\nleaving the unburnt part to cover the wound. Celsus says a sponge dipped\r\nin oil and vinegar or cold water relieves gouty swellings. He also\r\nrecommends a sponge dipped in vinegar or cold water for stopping\r\nhaemorrhage.\r\n\r\nDioscorides says that fistulae may be dilated with sponge tents.\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus says that in epistaxis the nose may be plugged with\r\nsponge:\r\n\r\n    Proderit et spongeae particulam praesectam apte forfice ad\r\n    amplitudinem et patorem narium figuratam inicere paulo pressius ex\r\n    aceto per se (xlvi).\r\n\r\nSoranus (xli) says haemorrhage from the uterus may be stopped with a\r\nsponge tent:\r\n\r\n    Ὁπότε τρυφερὸν καὶ καθαρὸν σπογγάριον ἐπιμήκες ὡσαύτως διάβροχον ὡς\r\n    ἐσωτάτω παρεντιθέναι προσήκει.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sutures._\r\n\r\nCelsus (V. xxvi) says sutures should be of soft thread not overtwisted\r\nthat they may be the more easy on the part: 'Ex acia molli non nimis\r\ntorta quo mitius corpori insidat'. They were made of flax. The apolinose\r\ndescribed by Hippocrates (iii. 132) is directed to be made of crude flax\r\n(ὠμολίνου), the strands of which were stronger than those of dressed lint.\r\nThis also is what Paul used for the deligation of arteries.\r\n\r\nGalen alludes to sutures of wool, and Paulus Aegineta in the operation for\r\nectropion says:\r\n\r\n    'Afterwards we unite the divided parts with a needle carrying a\r\n    woollen thread, being satisfied with two sutures.'\r\n\r\nWe have no mention of catgut being used for this purpose, though that\r\nsubstance was early known to the Greeks. The Homeric harp was strung with\r\ncatgut. In fact χορδή, the term for harp-string, simply means intestines.\r\nPaul used a woman's hair in a needle to transplant hairs in trichiasis\r\n(VI. xiii). Horsehair was used to raise a pterygium in Paul VI. xviii, but\r\nit is not mentioned as being used for suturing wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Serres Fines._\r\n\r\nGreek, ἀγκτήρ; Latin, _fibula_.\r\n\r\nCelsus (V. xxvi) in describing the closing of wounds says:\r\n\r\n    Nam si plaga in molli parto est, sui debet, maximeque si discissa\r\n    auris ima est, vel imus nasus, vel frons, vel bucca, vel palpebra, vel\r\n    labrum, vel circa guttur cutis, vel venter. Si vero in carne vulnus\r\n    est hiatque, neque in unum orae facile attrahuntur, sutura quidem\r\n    aliena est; imponendae vero fibulae sunt; ἀγκτῆρας Graeci nominant;\r\n    quae oras paulum tamen contrahant, quo minus lata postea cicatrix sit.\r\n\r\n    'Suture is indicated if the lesion is in a soft part, especially in\r\n    the lobule of the ear, or the ala nasi, or the forehead, or cheek, the\r\n    edge of the eyelid, or the skin over the throat, or the abdominal\r\n    wall. But if the wound is in a muscular part and gape, and the edges\r\n    cannot easily be opposed, suture is contraindicated, and fibulae\r\n    (Graece ἀγκτῆρας) are to be used in order that the cicatrix afterwards\r\n    may not be wide.'\r\n\r\nWe have here contrasted two methods of closing a wound, and the conclusion\r\nis readily arrived at that sutures in the first case and some metal\r\ncontrivance in the second are intended. Celsus goes on to say, however:\r\n\r\n    Utraque optima est ex acia molli, non nimis torta, quo mitius corpori\r\n    insidat. Utraque neque nimis rara, neque nimis crebra iniicienda.\r\n\r\n    'Both are best made of soft thread, not too hard twisted that it may\r\n    sit easier on the tissues, nor are too few nor too many of either of\r\n    them to be put in.'\r\n\r\nA consideration of various passages in which the Greek authors use the\r\nterm leaves a distinct impression on one's mind that a metal clasp is\r\nintended. Thus Paul (VI. cvii), in treating of compound fractures, says\r\nthat if a large portion of the bone is laid bare we use fibulae and\r\nsutures (ἀγκτῆρσι καὶ ῥαφαῖς). It must be confessed, however, that the\r\nwords of Celsus render it difficult for us to assert with certainty that\r\nfibulae were metal clasps, and we find ancient commentators in equal\r\ndifficulty. Fallopius and Fabricius d' Aquapendente think fibulae mean\r\ninterrupted sutures. Guido de Cauliac thinks they mean metal clasps. There\r\nis just the possibility that a contrivance like our harelip pin with a\r\nfigure of eight thread may be indicated. This would satisfy both sides of\r\nthe question. If fibulae were metal clasps, however, we have several\r\nvarieties of ancient fibulae that might have been used for closing wounds.\r\nThat most suited for the purpose in hand seems to me to be one consisting\r\nof a small bar terminating in two hooks. Several of these from Roman\r\nLondon are in the Guildhall Museum (Pl. LII, figs. 5, 6, 7). They\r\nrepresent a useful form of 'clip' still in use by cyclists, and they could\r\nbe applied to wounds to act on the principle of Malgaigne's hooks for the\r\npatella. A modicum of support for this view may be derived from the fact\r\nthat whereas Galen, from whom the above passage on compound fractures is\r\nquoted by Paul, uses the word ἀγκτῆρσι, the codices of Paul almost\r\nunanimously have ἀγκίστροις. Fourteen out of fifteen give the latter\r\nrendering.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Band of Antyllus._\r\n\r\nIn the interesting dissertation which Oribasius gives on the subject of\r\nphlebotomy (_Med. Collect._ vii) he states that Antyllus directs us to\r\napply a ligature of two fingers' breadth round the arm when going to let\r\nblood at the elbow. He says that they are mistaken who affirm that the\r\nsame effect may be produced by applying the band below, for the veins will\r\nnot then swell even if the arm be fomented. When going to bleed at the\r\nankle the ligature is to be applied at the knee. When the blood does not\r\nflow well he advises us to slacken the bandage if too tight. This is the\r\nfamous 'band of Antyllus'.\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned also in the pseudo-Hippocratic treatise on Ulcers (iii.\r\n328):\r\n\r\n    'When you have opened the vein and after you have let blood and have\r\n    loosened the fillet (ταινίαν) and yet the blood does not stop.'\r\n\r\nPaul also mentions the band, including one round the neck when the veins\r\nof the forehead are to be opened for ophthalmia. So far as we know the\r\nfillet was nothing more than a plain strip of linen or some such material,\r\nbut Deneffe, commenting on two bronze fibulae which were found in the\r\ngrave of the surgeon of Paris, conjectures that they may have been used to\r\nfix the fillet in venesection. I give figures of these after Deneffe, but\r\nit seems to me that these buckles are more likely to have belonged to the\r\nstraps of a portable instrument-case of canvas or leather which had\r\ndisappeared. One is a neat little heptagonal fibula, 2·8 cm. in its widest\r\npart, with a tongue 27 mm. long (Pl. LII, fig. 2). The other fibula is in\r\nthe form of a penannular ring, formed by a two-headed serpent curved on\r\nitself so that the two heads look at each other, separated from each other\r\nby a space of a few millimetres (Pl. LII, fig. 8). Opposite the heads\r\nthere is a small rectangular opening to receive the end of the strap.\r\nThere is no tongue. It may have been fixed by a metal bar attached to the\r\nother end of the strap.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sieves and Strainers._\r\n\r\nGreek, ἠθμός, κυρτίς; Latin, _cribrum_.\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus mentions sieves of different sizes. In ch. xc a small\r\none is mentioned:\r\n\r\n    Contunditur hic cortex per se et cribratur tenui cribro.\r\n\r\nIn other places larger sizes are mentioned:\r\n\r\n    In his macerantur res quae infra scriptae sunt, contusae et\r\n    percribratae grandioribus foraminibus cribri (cclxix).\r\n\r\nMarcellus (_De Medicamentis_, xxxiii. 9) says:\r\n\r\n    Pulverem facito, et cribello medicinali omnem pulverem cerne et\r\n    permisce, et cum vino vetere calefacto locum inline.\r\n\r\nThere are large numbers of sieves and strainers in bronze and earthenware\r\nin the Naples Museum.\r\n\r\nPaul (VII. xx) says oil of sesame is to be prepared from sesame pounded,\r\nsoftened, and pressed in a strainer with screws (διὰ κυρτίδων τῶν\r\nκοχλιῶν). The word κυρτίς literally means a basket or wicker eel-trap.\r\nHere it must mean a strainer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mortar and Pestle._\r\n\r\nGreek, ἰγδίον, mortar: δοῖδυξ, pestle; Latin, _mortarium_, _pilum_.\r\n\r\nIn the find of the oculist Severus is a bronze dish which Deneffe regards\r\nas a mortar. It is 8 cm. in diameter and 3·5 deep, and rests on a base of\r\n3 cm. diameter, so that it sits firmly. Marcellus (_De Medic._ i) mentions\r\na mortar of marble:\r\n\r\n    Haec universa conteres in mortario marmoreo, et aceto admixto fronti\r\n    inlines.\r\n\r\nHe also mentions one of wood:\r\n\r\n    Huius radicem colliges et findes in partes duas, quarum unam siccabis\r\n    ac minutatim concides et mittes in pilam ligneam atque illic\r\n    diligenter tundes (xxiii).\r\n\r\nScrib. Larg. speaks of pestles of wood:\r\n\r\n    Hoc medicamentum cum componitur pilum ligneum sit (clii).\r\n\r\nIn Paul we have a mortar of lead and a leaden pestle mentioned several\r\ntimes:\r\n\r\n    Ἐν μολυβδίνῳ ἰγδίῳ καὶ μολυβδίνῳ δοίδυκι λειώσας.\r\n\r\n    'Triturate ceruse with wine and rose oil in a leaden mortar with a\r\n    leaden pestle and anoint with it' (III. lix).\r\n\r\nGalen (_De Simpl._ x) speaks of bronze mortars:\r\n\r\n    'Wherefore, some call only the natural mineral by this name, but some\r\n    also the substance which is prepared in a bronze mortar with a copper\r\n    pestle by means of the urine of a boy, which some value according to\r\n    the differences of the verdigris. But it is better to prepare it in\r\n    summer, or at least in hot weather, rubbing up the urine in the\r\n    mortar, and it answers the more excellently if the bronze of which you\r\n    make the mortar is red and the pestle too, for more is thus rubbed off\r\n    by the turning of the pestle when the bronze is of a softer nature.'\r\n\r\nPaul mentions a mortar of marble. A small mortar of bronze was found\r\namongst the instruments of the surgeon of Paris. Another small one from my\r\nown collection is shown in Pl. LII, fig. 3. The excavation of the temple\r\nof Aesculapius in the forum has brought to light a large number of mortars\r\nof marble. They are mostly about six or seven inches in diameter, but are\r\nmuch deeper in proportion than our modern mortars are. The spathomele and\r\nother olivary probes were no doubt often used as small pestles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Whetstone._\r\n\r\nGreek, ἀκόνη; Latin, _cos_.\r\n\r\nWe saw that several of the slabs on which ointments were prepared had\r\nevidently been used for sharpening knives, and whetstones are often found\r\nof varying degrees of roughness from sandstone to fine argillaceous smooth\r\nstones. Paul (VII. iii) says:\r\n\r\n    Τό γε μὴν τῆς Ναξίας ἀκόνης ἀπότριμμα ψυκτικὸν εἶναι φασὶν ὥστε καὶ\r\n    τιτθοὺς παρθένων καὶ παίδων ὄρχεις προστέλλειν. τῆς ἐλαιακόνης δὲ τὸ\r\n    ἀπότριμμα ῥυπτικὸν ὑπάρχον ἀλωπεκίαις ἁρμόττει.\r\n\r\n    'The filings of the Naxian whetstone are said to be refrigerant,\r\n    repressing the breasts of maidens and the testicles of boys. The\r\n    filings of the oilstone being detergent suit with alopecia.'\r\n\r\nIt is uncertain what the Naxian whetstone was, but it was considered the\r\nbest variety of whetstone. It is mentioned in Pindar. From the fact that\r\nemery is found in Naxos one might conclude that the Naxian whetstone was\r\nof emery, but a few lines before the passage quoted from Paul he has\r\nalready mentioned the emery:\r\n\r\n    Ἡ δὲ σμύρις ῥυπτικὴν ἔχουσα δύναμιν ὀδόντας σμήχει.\r\n\r\n    'The emery having detergent powers cleanses teeth.'\r\n\r\nGalen makes the Naxian stone a variety of ostracites which was apparently\r\nmarble formed of shells. One of the marble ointment tablets had, we saw,\r\nbeen used as a whetstone, but the whetstones for which Naxos was famous\r\nmust, if not emery, have been some variety of shale or slate. It seems\r\ncontrasted to some extent with the 'oilstone', i. e. whetstone which\r\nrequired oil. This was a clay slate (see Pliny, _H. N._ xxxvi. 47).\r\n\r\nThere are several whetstones from Stabiae in the Naples Museum which are\r\nclassed among surgical implements. Whetstones are common objects in the\r\nfinds from any Roman settlement, but they are not ground to regular shapes\r\nas our whetstones are. They usually consist of fine sandy schistaceous\r\nshale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nÉTUI, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Portable Outfit._\r\n\r\nAfter describing the larger apparatus necessary for the equipment of the\r\nsurgery, Hippocrates mentions a portable equipment for use on journeys:\r\n\r\n    'Have also another apparatus ready to hand for journeys, simply\r\n    prepared, and handy too by method of arrangement, for one cannot\r\n    overhaul everything' (i. 72).\r\n\r\nThe component parts of this portable outfit so far known to us are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe scalpels of different shapes seem to have been carried in boxes,\r\nprobably wooden, which opened in two halves like a modern mathematical\r\ninstrument box. In these the scalpels lay head and tail, separated from\r\neach other by small fixed partitions. A box of scalpels of this kind is\r\nrepresented in a marble votive tablet which was found on the Acropolis on\r\nthe site of the Temple of Aesculapius. A similar box with different\r\ninstruments is seen in a donarium in the Capitoline Museum. The probes and\r\nforceps were carried in cylindrical cases like those in which the scribes\r\ncarried their pens. A good many of these have come down to us. From the\r\nfact that in the grave of the surgeon of Paris there were found two\r\nbuckles, it is probable that there had been buried along with the\r\ninstruments a case of leather or some such perishable material, which had\r\nbeen used to contain instruments, but which had disappeared when the grave\r\nwas opened. There have also been found boxes of various shapes for\r\ncontaining medicaments, cylindrical boxes for drugs in sticks, boxes\r\ndivided into little partitions for drugs in semi-solid form, and other\r\nboxes for powders.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Portable Probe Cases._\r\n\r\nThe spatulae, sounds, hooks, and forceps were carried about in a\r\ncylindrical case of bronze. Several of these étui have been found\r\ncontaining instruments. They average 18 cm. in length and 1·5 cm. in\r\ndiameter. The lid lifts off. One in the museum at Lausanne was found in a\r\nRoman conduit at Bosséaz and contained a cyathiscomele of the usual type\r\n(Bonstetten, _Recueil des Antiqq. Suisses_, pl. xii, figs. 11 and 12). A\r\ncase exactly similar to the above containing a cyathiscomele and a toothed\r\nvulsellum was found in the Rhine Valley. Another case of the same kind was\r\nfound at Bregenz. It contained a long ligula, a spathomele, a\r\ncyathiscomele, and a double olivary probe.\r\n\r\nIn the Naples Museum are four of these cases, three of which were found in\r\nPompeii and one in Herculaneum. One of these is a plain cylindrical case\r\n18 cm. long and 1·5 in diameter. It contained instruments (Pl. LIII, fig.\r\n1). Another case is ornamented with raised rings. It was found in the\r\nHouse of the Physician, and contained six specilla of different kinds and\r\na vulsellum. A third is of similar size and shape, but it is considerably\r\ndestroyed by oxidation, and it is adherent to a rectangular slab of black\r\nstone which had been used for mixing medicaments. Through the cracks in\r\nthe case there may be seen the probes which it contains. The case from\r\nHerculaneum is a plain cylindrical case 19 cm. long and 2 cm. in diameter.\r\n\r\nLately, several other cases have been found in Italy which are placed in\r\nthe Naples Museum. One in a fragmentary condition showing its contents is\r\nseen in Pl. LIII, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nIn the Musée de Cinquantenaire, Brussels, there is one of these cases\r\nwhich was brought by M. Ravenstein from Italy. It contained three\r\ninstruments all of silver, a cyathiscomele, a grooved director, and a\r\nplain double-ended stylet. It is 18 cm. long and 1·5 in diameter.\r\n\r\nA fragment of a similar case was found in the Roman Hospital at Baden.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Box for Scalpels._\r\n\r\nAmong the ruins of the Temple of Aesculapius on the top of the Acropolis\r\nat Athens there was found a marble donarium or votive tablet, which\r\nrepresents a box of scalpels flanked by a pair of bleeding-cups.\r\n\r\nThe box reminds one of a modern box for mathematical instruments, being\r\ndivided into a top and bottom half, each of which contains instruments\r\nseparated from each other by small blocks. There are three instruments in\r\neach half and they are arranged head and tail. Five are scalpels of\r\ndifferent shapes; the sixth has a curved cutting instrument at one end and\r\nat the other a lithotomy scoop. The size of each half of the box is 9 × 18\r\ncm. outside measurement, and 7 × 16·5 cm. inside. See Pl. IV.\r\n\r\nA similar box is seen in a marble tablet in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.\r\nHere the instruments are different.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ointment Boxes._\r\n\r\nAmong the instruments of the surgeon of Paris was a box which Deneffe\r\nregards as a portable unguentarium. Unlike the medicament boxes it is not\r\ndivided into compartments and the lid lifts off instead of sliding in\r\ngrooves. It is 83 mm. long, 45 wide, and 35 deep. A line running round the\r\nmiddle of the box divides it into two equal parts and shows the division\r\nbetween cover and box. On the top is a little ring attached by a little\r\npyramidal eminence 1·5 cm. high by which the cover was lifted off. Several\r\ncircular ointment boxes, some containing medicaments, are to be seen in\r\nthe Naples Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collyrium Boxes._\r\n\r\nA large number of cylindrical boxes containing sticks of medicament have\r\nbeen found in Pompeii. In the find of the oculist of Rheims there were\r\nfive cylindrical boxes, all of the same size and shape. They were 14 cm.\r\nlong and 12 mm. in diameter. The covers are 35 mm. high. In them were the\r\nremains of sticks of collyria which they had contained. The term collyrium\r\nincludes in classical writings not only liquid but also solid\r\napplications. Collyria were often moulded into sticks for portability, and\r\nliquefied with water, wine, white of egg, &c., as required. These boxes\r\nwhich have come down to us are exactly similar to the case shown in Pl.\r\nLIII, but they are on a smaller scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Slabs for preparation of Ointment._\r\n\r\nIn the Roman provinces small rectangular slabs are occasionally found\r\nwhich have evidently been used for rubbing medicaments upon. Some have\r\nalso their edges worn by the sharpening of scalpels. As they are rarely of\r\nthe stone of the country in which they are found they have evidently been\r\nmanufactured in Italy and carried by their owners on their travels. They\r\nare rather rare. There are two in the museum at Naples. One was discovered\r\nin Herculaneum which is 13 cm. long and 8 cm. broad. A cylindrical\r\ninstrument case is adherent to it. The edges are bevelled on its upper\r\nsurface. One of similar size and shape, but made of white marble, was\r\nfound in the grave of the surgeon of Paris. It shows by the hollowing out\r\nof one of its edges that it has been used for sharpening scalpels.\r\n\r\nThere are two in the Archaeological Museum at Namur. They are of black\r\nmarble. They measure 11 cm. by 7·5, but a bevelling of ·75 cm. all round\r\nreduced the top surface to 9·5 cm. by 6. One of these was found along with\r\nsurgical instruments in a second-century cemetery at Wancennes near Namur.\r\n\r\nThere is one of a dark-coloured stone in the museum at Chesters,\r\nNorthumberland. A small specimen of my own is shown in Pl. LII, fig. 4.\r\nSimilar small slabs, engraved with oculists' names and the names of drugs\r\nto serve as seals, have been found in considerable numbers, but these\r\noculists' seals have already an extensive literature of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boxes for Drugs._\r\n\r\nA considerable number of medicament boxes have been found. They are\r\nusually of bronze, rectangular and of a convenient size and weight for\r\ncarrying in the pocket. In size they average 12 cm. in length by 7·5 in\r\nbreadth and 2 in height. As a rule they are divided into four or more\r\nsmall divisions by partitions. Those reported are as follows:\r\n\r\nThere are two in the Royal Antiquarian Museum at Berlin. Of these, one was\r\nfound in the Rhenish country between Neuss and Xanten. It is of bronze.\r\nInlaid with silver on its sliding cover is the figure of Aesculapius\r\nstanding in a small temple.\r\n\r\nThe second, of similar construction and appearance, was brought by\r\nFriedlander from Naples and presented by him to the museum.\r\n\r\nA third, in the museum at Mainz, was found in the Rhine while dredging\r\nnear the town. It is of bronze, 10 cm. long, 8 wide, 2 in height. It\r\nweighs 123 grammes. The sliding lid is decorated with the snake of\r\nAesculapius, twisted round the stem of a laurel tree. The tree and the\r\nbody of the snake are formed by inlaying copper in the bronze. The outline\r\nof the head of the snake and the scales of the body are of silver. On\r\nwithdrawing the lid the interior is seen to be divided into four\r\ncompartments each shut by a little hinged lid, which may be lifted by\r\nmeans of a little ring. Two of these compartments are 6 cm. by 3, the two\r\nothers are 4 cm. by 3.\r\n\r\nIn the Naples Museum there are three of these boxes. They are all of\r\nbronze and divided into compartments. One is divided into five\r\ncompartments. It is 18 cm. long by 8 wide and 2 deep. Of the compartments\r\nthree are 8 cm. by 2 and two are 5 cm. by 3. There is at the upper end of\r\nthe box a small handle by which to carry it. Another box is 13 cm. by 7·5.\r\nOn removing the lid it is seen to be divided into six compartments, two of\r\nwhich have hinged lids of their own, like the Mainz box. These\r\ncompartments still contain medicaments (Pl. LIV).\r\n\r\nThe third of the Naples boxes is of an unusual type. It is 12·5 cm. by\r\n7·5, but it is 3 cm. high and is divided into an upper and a lower\r\ndivision each 1·5 cm. deep. Each division has a sliding lid of its own.\r\nThe upper division is separated into four compartments, two of which are 7\r\ncm. by 2 and two are 4 cm. by 2. The lower stage occupies the whole area\r\nof the box.\r\n\r\nA medicament box of a unique character was in use in a chapel as a\r\nreliquary till its original use was pointed out. It is of ivory, and\r\ncarved on its sliding lid is a representation of Aesculapius and his\r\ndaughter Hygeia. Aesculapius carries in his left hand a staff, round which\r\nis coiled a snake, and in his right a pine cone. Hygeia carries a snake in\r\nher right hand, and in her left a bowl from which she feeds the snake. The\r\nexecution of the design shows the box to belong to the third century. The\r\nbox is divided into eleven compartments. It is now in the Castle Valeria\r\nat Sitten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nI. INVENTORY OF CHIEF INSTRUMENTS IN VARIOUS MUSEUMS\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH MUSEUMS.\r\n\r\nThe _British Museum_ contains the following (Case ii. B):\r\n\r\nBleeding cup (No. 2313); collyrium spoon with spout (two, Nos. 2314-5);\r\nstaphylagra (two, Nos. 2316-7); hook, sharp (No. 2318); ditto blunt, i. e.\r\nretractor (No. 2319); forceps (No. 2320); two-pronged retractors (Nos.\r\n2322-6); scarifier (No. 2327); knife, steel (No. 2321); scalpel handles\r\n(Nos. 2331-9); spathomeles; cyathiscomeles; spatulae; ligulae; ear\r\nspecilla; aneurism needle (No. 2372); epilation forceps (narrow), ditto\r\n(broad), ditto ditto with catch.\r\n\r\nThe Guildhall Museum contains a good few instruments found in London,\r\namongst others a considerable number of ear specilla, vulsella, lancets,\r\nand numberless instruments common to both domestic and surgical use, such\r\nas strigils, ligulae, styli, and needles. The Celtic cutting instruments\r\nare of interest for comparison. This collection is in many ways one of the\r\nmost interesting we have in England.\r\n\r\nThe museum at Shrewsbury contains several surgical instruments from the\r\nancient Roman city of Uriconium on which Wroxeter now stands. The most\r\ninteresting is a bleeding lancet. There are also styli and an ointment\r\nslab and the seal of an oculist.\r\n\r\nThe museum at Chesters, Northumberland, containing finds from the Roman\r\ncamps at Cilurnum, Procolitia, Borcovicus, and other sites on the Roman\r\nWall, contains amongst other things hooks, spatulae, bougie, a triangular\r\nmedicine weight of tin, forceps, needles of bone and bronze, borers, knife\r\nblades, ear specilla, steelyard, counterpoises, many in the form of snakes\r\nand therefore, perhaps, for pharmaceutical purposes, the serpent being the\r\nsymbol of Aesculapius.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSEUMS IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\n_Saint-Germain-en-Laye._ Outfit of Severus, viz. two iron pitchers, four\r\nbowls, mortar, two balances, seven forceps, one spathomele, scalpel\r\nhandle, ditto damascened, spatulae (two), two knife-and-needle handles,\r\nfour needle handles, olive-and-needle, scalpel-handle-and-borer, three\r\nsharp hooks, blunt and sharp hook, small blunt hook, seal.

(January 19, 1847.)\r\n\r\nIn March, 1846, Quaranta made a communication to the same Society\r\nentitled 'Osservazioni sopra nu forcipe Pompeiano', in which he expressed\r\na different opinion from that held by Vulpes, and pointed out that the\r\nforceps described by the latter in his first communication was found in\r\nPompeii. This is the famous forceps which is always referred to as the\r\n'Pompeian Forceps'.\r\n\r\nThese valuable papers of Vulpes and Quaranta were published in vol. vii of\r\nthe _Memorie della Regale Academia Ercolanese di Archeologia_. These\r\narticles are profusely illustrated. In 1847 Vulpes gathered these papers\r\ntogether, and with some slight alterations published them under the title\r\nof 'Illustrazione di tutti gli instrumenti chirurgici scavati in Ercolano\r\ne in Pompeii'.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Vulpes wrote there were in the Museum among other things\r\n45 probes of various kinds, upwards of 90 forceps, 13 bleeding-cups of\r\nbronze, and 16 scalpels.\r\n\r\nVACHER.--Les instruments de chirurgie à Herculanum et Pompeï.
