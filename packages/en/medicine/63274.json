Thus from the\r\nstandpoint of clinical investigation and of practical experience, the\r\nbook will be a contribution towards the solution of the sexual problem,\r\nnowadays recognized as one of supreme importance.\r\n\r\nIt is thirty years since I published a work on the histological changes\r\nthat occur in the ovaries during the climacteric period (Archiv. für\r\nGynecologie, Vol. xii, Section 3); and ever since that time, the\r\ninfluence exerted upon the general health of women by the physiological\r\nand pathological processes occurring in their reproductive organs, has\r\nbeen to me a favourite subject for observation and experiment. The\r\nresult of these studies is incorporated in my monographs, “The\r\nClimacteric Period in Women” (Erlangen, 1874), “Sterility in Women” (2nd\r\nEd., Vienna, 1895), “The Uterus and the Heart” (Leipzig, 1898), and in\r\nvarious contributions to medical periodicals. I now have a welcome\r\nopportunity of drawing a general picture of sexual activity in women,\r\nand of illuminating this picture both by the light of my own experience\r\nand by numerous references to the works of other authors. In passing, I\r\nhave devoted considerable attention to questions of education and\r\npersonal hygiene, both of which are greatly influenced by the processes\r\nof the sexual life. Thus, I hope, the work will be rendered more\r\ninteresting to the physician, and the general picture it is intended to\r\nconvey will be more fully characterized by contemporary actuality.\r\n\r\nNatural divisions of the subject are, I consider, furnished by the three\r\ngreat landmarks of the sexual life of woman: the _onset_ of\r\nmenstruation—the _menarche_: the _culmination_ of sexual activity—the\r\n_menacme_; and the _cessation_ of menstruation—the _menopause_. These\r\nseveral sexual epochs are differentiated by characteristic anatomical\r\nstates of the reproductive organs, by the external configuration of the\r\nfeminine body, by functional effects throughout the entire organism,\r\nand, finally, by pathological disturbances of the normal vital\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nThus in separate chapters a description is given of sexual processes, a\r\ndetailed exposition of which will be vainly sought in the textbooks of\r\ngynecology, yet which are none the less of far-reaching importance in\r\nrelation to the physical, mental, and social well-being of women, and in\r\nrelation also to the development of human society; such topics are, the\r\nsexual impulse, copulation, fertility, sterility, the employment of\r\nmeans for the prevention of conception, the determination of sex, sexual\r\nhygiene. To the topics of pregnancy, parturition, lying-in, and\r\nlactation, since these are adequately discussed in works on midwifery,\r\nbut little space has here been allotted.\r\n\r\nIt is my earnest hope that physicians and biologists may derive benefit\r\nfrom the book equal in amount to the pleasure I have gained in the work\r\nof writing it.\r\n\r\n                                                      E.

These writings of _Hippocrates_ contain some very\r\nremarkable observations on the influence exercised by disorders of the\r\nreproductive organs on the general health of women.\r\n\r\n_Aristotle_ wrote at some length on the functions of the female genital\r\norgans. In the writings of _Aretæus_ and _Galen_ on the diseases of\r\nwomen we find striking observations, as for instance, in _Galen’s De\r\nLocis Affectis_,[4] which contains a “Statement of the Similarity and\r\nDissimilarity of Man and Woman.” Another notable work is that of\r\n_Albertus Magnus_, entitled _De Secretis Mulierum_.[5]\r\n\r\nThe numerous works on the diseases of women published in the sixteenth\r\ncentury consisted for the most part of a repetition of the observations\r\nof ancient writers. The gynecological treatises of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, however, bore witness to an increased knowledge of the anatomy\r\nof the female reproductive organs, and were illumined by _Haller’s_\r\nresearches on the functions of these organs.\r\n\r\nThe subject with which we are especially concerned is discussed in a\r\nwork by _Boireau-Laffecteur_, _Essai sur les Maladies Physiques et\r\nMorales des femmes_,[6] Paris, 1793; and also in _Marie-Clement’s\r\nConsiderations Physiologiques sur les Diverses Epoques de la Vie des\r\nFemmes_,[7] Paris, 1803. the same connection we must mention _von\r\nHumboldt’s_ treatise, _Ueber den Geschlechtsunterschied und dessen\r\nEinfluss auf die organische Natur_.[8] The first comprehensive work in\r\nwhich an exhaustive inquiry was made into the functional disorders of\r\nthe female genital organs and the relation of these disorders to the\r\nfemale organism as a whole and to the physical and mental peculiarities\r\nof woman was _Busch’s: Das Geschlechtsleben des Weibes_,[9] Leipzig,\r\n1839.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the nineteenth century a very large number of\r\nmonographs were published, investigating and describing the reflex\r\ndisturbances produced alike in the individual organs and in the nervous\r\nsystem as a whole by changes in the uterus and its annexa. Many of these\r\nworks will be mentioned more particularly in the course of this\r\ntreatise.\r\n\r\nThe sexual life, based upon the purpose, so important to every creature,\r\nof the propagation of the species, possesses in the female sex a vital\r\nsignificance enormously greater than sexual activity possesses in the\r\nmale. From the very beginning of sexuality, when the idea of a bisexual\r\ndifferentiation dawns for the first time in the brain of the little\r\ngirl, down to the sexual death of the withered matron, who laments the\r\nloss of her sexual potency, physical and mental activity, work and\r\nthought, function and sensation, arise for the most part, wittingly or\r\nunwittingly, from that germinal energy which is the manifestation of the\r\nunalterable law that the existing organism endeavors to reproduce its\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nEvery phase of the sexual life of woman, from the threshold of puberty\r\nto the extinction of sexual activity, the first appearance of\r\nmenstruation, the complete development of the sexual organs, the act of\r\ncopulation, conception, pregnancy, parturition, and the puerperium,\r\nfinally the involutionary process which accompanies the cessation of\r\nmenstruation at the climacteric period—every one of these sexual phases\r\nentails consecutive physiological processes and pathological changes\r\nalike in the individual organs and in the nutritive condition of the\r\nentire organism, in the functions of the cardio-vascular apparatus, of\r\nthe brain and the nerves, of the skin and the sense-organs, in the\r\nprocesses of digestion and general metabolism. Herein we see a striking\r\nillustration of the old saying of _von Helmont_, _propter solum uterum\r\nmulier est quod est_;[10] also of the similar aphorism of _Hippocrates_,\r\n_uterus omnium causa morborum qui mulieres infestant_;[11] a conception\r\nsummed up by _Goethe_ in the words of Mephistopheles:\r\n\r\n                     “Es ist ihr ewig Weh und Ach\r\n                     So tausendfach\r\n                     Aus einem Punkte zu kurieren.”\r\n\r\nJust as in a tree the process of growth is made manifest to the\r\nsuperficial observer by the pleasure he feels at the sight of the buds\r\nand blossoms, by the refreshment he obtains from the fruit, and by the\r\nsadness which the withering of the leaves causes him, so in the sexual\r\nlife of woman there are landmarks which no one can possibly overlook, by\r\nmeans of which three great epochs are distinguished. These are: puberty\r\n(the menarche), recognized by the first appearance of menstruation and\r\nthe awakening of the sexual impulse; sexual maturity (the menacme), in\r\nthe fully developed woman, characterized by the functions of copulation\r\nand reproduction; and sexual involution (the menopause), in which we see\r\nthe gradual decline and ultimate extinction of sexual power and all its\r\nmanifestations. In all these three epochs the sexual life of woman not\r\nonly affects the hidden domain of the genital organs, but controls also\r\nall the vegetative, physical, and mental processes of the body, and is\r\nclearly and incontestably apparent in all vital manifestations. What\r\nMadame de Staël said of love is indeed true of the entire sexual life of\r\nwoman: _l’amour n’est qu’unc épisode de la vie de l’homme; c’est\r\nl’histoire tout entière de la femme_.[12].\r\n\r\nThe sexual life of woman is coextensive with the peculiar vital activity\r\nof the female sex, for it endures from the moment when individuality\r\nfirst begins to develop out of the indifferent stage of childhood until\r\nthe decline into the dead-level of senility.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this fact, I have drawn up a curve of the sexual life of\r\nwoman, making use of the statistical data available in central Europe\r\nregarding the age at which menstruation first appears, the age at which\r\nmaidens marry, the age at which the largest number of women give birth\r\nto a child, and the age at which menstruation ceases; and reducing the\r\nfigures to averages. * denotes the fifteenth year of life, as the\r\naverage age at the menarche; ** denotes the twenty-second year of life\r\nas the average age at marriage; *** denotes the thirty-second year of\r\nlife, in which woman exhibits her maximum fecundity; **** denotes the\r\nforty-sixth year of life as the average age at the menopause. (FIG. 1.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.—Curve of the sexual life of woman from the tenth to the\r\n    sixtieth year of life.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNot in this respect alone, however, is the sexual life of woman of\r\nparamount importance; it is, in addition, the mainspring of the\r\nwell-being and progress of the family, of the nation, of the entire\r\nhuman race. In the evolution of man from the primitive state in which he\r\nexisted merely for the performance of vegetative functions up to the\r\nhighest stage of contemporary culture, in the history of all races and\r\nof all times, the sexual life has been a most potent determining factor.\r\nWith that life, religion, philosophy, ethics, natural science, and\r\nhygiene, have been most intimately related; for that life, they have\r\nfurnished precepts and laws. The history of the sexual life is identical\r\nwith the history of human culture.\r\n\r\nIn a primitive condition of society, among people living in a state of\r\nnature and among the lower races of mankind, the sexual life of woman\r\npossesses no great general interest, the female being merely a chattel;\r\nthe ownership of this chattel, moreover, being often temporary and\r\ntransient. The investigations of anthropologists have shown that among\r\nprimitive people this form of property is neither highly esteemed nor\r\ncarefully safeguarded. In such societies no restraint is imposed on the\r\nsexual impulse, which is gratified without shame and without formality.\r\nNo hindrance is offered to the mutual intercourse of the two sexes.\r\nChastity in the females is not prized by the males, nor do the latter\r\ncompete for the favors of the former. Procreation is no more than a\r\ngregarious impulse of the masses among whom the common ownership of all\r\nbooty is a matter of tribal custom. The woman has no disposing power\r\nover that which every one desires and which every one has the right to\r\ndemand. Very gradually, however, a change takes place in this respect,\r\nso that in every period of social life since the very earliest, the\r\nmodesty of young girls, the high valuation put upon the preservation of\r\nvirginity, the ethical approbation of chastity in the wife, respect for\r\nthe duties and rights of the mother, the reverence felt for the\r\nmatron—all these, throughout the sexual life of woman, have had a\r\ncivilizing, ennobling, and elevating effect. Thus, as family life has\r\nbecome developed, and as love and marriage have been more highly\r\nesteemed, woman has become the much-prized embodiment of all that is\r\nbeautiful and good, of all that is summed up in the idea of the\r\n“housewife,” and her sexual life has been more completely, more ideally\r\nadmired. The danger is not remote, however, that the leveling tendencies\r\nof the present day, and an inclination to despise the sexual life of\r\nwoman, far from resulting in a further elevation of the social status of\r\nwomanhood, will result rather in its abasement.\r\n\r\nThe Bible, as we may expect from the patriarchal relationships of the\r\nwomen of that time, bears witness to the worth of woman, and, whilst\r\nesteeming child-bearing, refers to yet higher duties. Precise religious\r\nand social precepts are furnished for all the phases of sexual life.\r\n\r\nIn classical antiquity, also, we see that woman rose to some extent\r\nabove the low position she had previously occupied in the family circle\r\nand in society at large. Both among the Greeks and among the Romans,\r\nthere was open to women a more intimate place in social life and a more\r\ninfluential rôle in the life of the family, than would have been their\r\nportion regarded merely in relation to their child-bearing activity.\r\nAmongst the Germans in the very earliest times, chastity gave rise to\r\npurer and more moral sexual relations; whereas among the Slavonic\r\npeoples the conception of woman as the childbearer continued to dominate\r\nthese relations.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the diffusion of Christianity, woman became man’s\r\ncompanion and equal, and her life, the sexual life included, acquired a\r\ndeeper significance, owing to the stress which that religion laid on\r\nchastity as a virtue, and as a result of the educational influence of\r\nwoman in the family circle.\r\n\r\nWith the progress of civilization the sexual life of woman comes to\r\nexhibit its activities only within the bounds of morality and law, which\r\nin human society have replaced the crude rule of nature, and have\r\nsupplied regulations adapted to the changing phases of sexual vital\r\nmanifestations. The wise adaptation of these regulations requires,\r\nhowever, a full understanding of the mental and physical processes, an\r\nexact recognition of the bodily states and intellectual sensibilities,\r\nof woman regarded as a sexual being.\r\n\r\nModern culture and the social organization of the present day, in\r\nassociation with the resulting sexual neuropathy of women, have\r\nexercised on their sexual life an influence as powerful as it is\r\nunfavorable, manifesting itself in the overpowering frequency of the\r\ndiseases of women. In one of the most thoughtful books ever written on\r\nthe subject of woman, _Michelet’s L’Amour_,[13] the author remarks that\r\nevery century is characterized by the prevalence of certain diseases:\r\nthus, in the thirteenth century, leprosy was the dominant disease; the\r\nfourteenth century was devastated by bubonic plague, then known as the\r\nblack death; the sixteenth century witnessed the appearance of syphilis;\r\nfinally, as regards the nineteenth century, “_se siècle sera nommé celui\r\ndes maladies de la matrice_”.[14] It is certain that the education and\r\nmode of life of the modern woman belonging to the so-called upper\r\nclasses are, as far as sexual matters are concerned, in direct\r\nopposition to those that are agreeable to nature and those that the laws\r\nof health demand.\r\n\r\nEven before sexual development begins, before the physical ripening of\r\nthe reproductive organs to functional activity, the imagination of young\r\ngirls is often prematurely occupied with sexual ideas in consequence of\r\nunsuitable literature, owing to visits to theatres and exhibitions, or\r\non account of social intercourse with young men who are not\r\noverscrupulous in the selection of topics for conversation. From the\r\ntime of puberty up to the time of marriage the growing woman is under\r\nthe influence of the now awakened sexual impulse, which experiences\r\never-renewed stimulation. A sedentary mode of life, unsuitable\r\nnutriment, and the early enjoyment of alcoholic beverages, exhibit their\r\ninevitable result in the frequency with which, in this epoch of the\r\nsexual life, chlorotic blood-changes, neurasthenic conditions, and\r\ndiverse symptoms of irritation of the genital organs, make their\r\nappearance. Thus, when marriage, so often unduly postponed in\r\nconsequence of the condition of modern society, does at length take\r\nplace, it is apt to find the woman not only fully enlightened as regards\r\nsexual matters, but often in a state of nervous weakness from sexual\r\nstimulation, one of the type whose characteristics have been happily\r\nsummed up by the French writer _Prévost_ in the expression\r\n_demi-vierge_.[15] The conjunction of this state of affairs in the bride\r\nwith the frequent partial impotence of the bridegroom, who has already\r\ndissipated the greater part of his virile power before entering upon\r\nmarriage, leads often to the appearance of vaginismus and other sexual\r\nneuroses in young married women. Even more disastrous in its\r\nconsequences as regards the future sexual life of the wife is the\r\never-increasing frequency of gonorrhœal infection in the first days of\r\nmarital intercourse, with all the evil results of that infection. On the\r\nother hand, an ever-larger proportion of girls belonging to the “middle\r\nand upper classes,” abstaining alike from the good and the evil results\r\nof marriage, falls under the yoke of sexual impulses denied satisfaction\r\nor gratified by abnormal means, and suffers in consequence both\r\nphysically and mentally. Further sources of injury arising from the\r\nconditions of modern social life are to be found in the neglect by women\r\nof the well-to-do classes of the duty of suckling their children, and in\r\nthe ever-increasing frequency with which the women of these classes,\r\nafter giving birth to one or two children, resort to the use of measures\r\nfor the prevention of pregnancy, which result in serious consequences as\r\nregards both the nervous system and the genital organs of the women\r\nconcerned. Thus there comes an accelerated ebb in the sexual life,\r\nleading to a premature appearance of the general phenomena of senility,\r\nwith a cessation of the menstrual flow. The modern wife, who claims the\r\nright to lead the life that best pleases her, will be more rapidly\r\novertaken by sexual death.\r\n\r\nFor the elucidation of the manifold reflex and other processes which are\r\ndependent upon or accompany the sexual phases of woman, we must in the\r\nfirst place consider the anatomical changes and physiological functions\r\nof the female reproductive organs characteristic of the several periods\r\nof sexual life which have already been distinguished. We must not fail\r\nalso to take into consideration the mental states which accompany and\r\ncharacterize these respective phases.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical changes which occur in the female genital organs during\r\nthese different phases of sexual life give rise to a number of manifold\r\nlocal stimuli, increasing and decreasing, varying greatly in intensity\r\nand area of distribution, upon which depend the reflex effects and\r\nremote manifestations in the sphere of the nervous and circulatory\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nWe must first consider the changes in the ovaries, which play an\r\netiologically important part. At the onset of puberty, the follicular\r\nmasses of the ovary exhibit a more active growth, the follicles increase\r\nin size, with their contained ova they approach the surface, and\r\nfinally, by the bursting of the follicles, the ova are extruded. Then,\r\nin the life-phase in which conception occurs, and under the influence of\r\nthe hyperæmia of all the pelvic viscera that accompanies this process, a\r\nnotable development of the corpus luteum takes place, this latter body\r\nreaching its maximum size in the eleventh week of pregnancy,\r\nsubsequently undergoing involution and leading to the formation of a\r\nconsiderable scar. Finally, in the critical period of life in which the\r\nmenstrual flow ceases, a continually increasing growth and new formation\r\nof connective tissue-stroma takes place in the ovaries at the expense of\r\ntheir cellular constituents, and a regressive metamorphosis of the\r\ngraafian follicles occurs.\r\n\r\nIn association with these sexual processes there ensues a series of\r\nstriking changes in the shape and consistency of the ovaries, affecting\r\nboth the surface and the parenchyma of these organs, and capable of\r\nstimulating the nervous ramifications in their tissue. In this\r\nconnection it is worthy of note that the branches supplying the ovaries\r\nfrom the spermatic plexuses of the sympathetic contain a considerable\r\nproportion of sensory fibres.\r\n\r\nQuite as significant, moreover, as the changes in the ovaries, are those\r\nwhich, in the course of the sexual life, the uterus undergoes, in shape\r\nand size, in its muscular substance and mucous lining, and in its\r\nvascular and nervous supply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 2.—Portion of the pelvic viscera in the female, and their\r\n    relation to the muscles of the pelvic outlet (or perineal muscles),\r\n    shown in the left half of the pelvis, seen from the right side.—The\r\n    parametrium. (From Toldt: Atlas of Human Anatomy.—Rebman Company,\r\n    New York.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt the time of puberty the infantile uterus undergoes changes affecting\r\nboth its external form and the shape of its interior cavity. The body of\r\nthe uterus enlarges to the size characteristic of sexual maturity, and\r\nits mucous membrane becomes the seat of periodic changes. This waxing\r\nand waning growth and transformation of the uterine mucous membrane\r\ncontinues throughout the period of menstrual activity, the most\r\nsuperficial layers of the membrane being shed during menstruation, a\r\nprocess followed by regeneration, which is itself succeeded by the\r\npremenstrual thickening. When conception occurs, still more extensive\r\nchanges ensue, the fertilized ovum becoming imbedded in the uterine\r\nmucous membrane, and the pregnant uterus, in shape and structure and in\r\nthe respective relations of the body and neck of the organ, in the\r\nincreasing distension of its veins and the increasing size of its\r\nnerves, becoming adapted to the important functions it has now to\r\nfulfil. When these have been fulfilled, and, parturition having taken\r\nplace, the uterus is empty once more, the organ again adapts itself to\r\naltered circumstances by the process of involution. Later, in the\r\nclimacteric period, a slow regressive process occurs, the outward\r\nmanifestation of which is the cessation of the menstrual flow,\r\ncharacterized anatomically by atrophy of the muscular tissue of the\r\nuterus and of its vascular apparatus, by the dessication of its mucous\r\nmembrane, by obliteration of the lumen of the uterine cavity, and\r\nultimately by senile degeneration and atrophy of the now entirely\r\nfunctionless organ, so that it becomes an insignificant, cicatrized,\r\nsolid body.\r\n\r\nNext to the ovaries and the uterus, it is the pelvic fascia which in its\r\nentire architectonic structure as well as in its individual parts\r\nundergoes the most notable changes in consequence of the processes of\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nA short account of the nerves and blood vessels of the female genital\r\norgans appears indispensable, to facilitate the comprehension of the\r\nmanner in which sexual processes are influenced by the nervous system,\r\nand to demonstrate the intimate connection between the blood-supply of\r\nthe genital apparatus and the general circulation.\r\n\r\nThe complex nervous network of the female sexual organs is supplied by\r\nspinal as well as by sympathetic fibres, the fibres from the two systems\r\nanastomosing in a very intimate manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 3.—The distribution of the pudic nerve, n. pudendus, in the\r\n    female perineal and pubic regions. The trunk of the pubic nerve, n.\r\n    pudendus, is covered by the gluteus maximus muscle. On the right\r\n    side of the body the branches of the inferior pudendal nerve, rami\r\n    perineales, nervi cutanei fermoris posterioris have been dissected\r\n    out; but the branches of this nerve to the labium majus have been\r\n    cut short. The formation of the anococcygeal or subcaudal nerves,\r\n    nn. anococcygei, out of the posterior primary division of the\r\n    coccygeal nerve and out of the perforating branches which arise from\r\n    the anterior primary divisions of the fourth and fifth sacral nerves\r\n    and the coccygeal nerve. (From Toldt: Atlas of Human Anatomy.—Rebman\r\n    Company, New York.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the spinal nerves distributed to the genital\r\norgans arise from the lumbar portion of the spinal cord, pass as rami\r\ncommunicantes to the first four lumbar ganglia of the great sympathetic\r\ncord, whence they proceed to the series of symmetrical (paired) and\r\nasymmetrical (azygos) sympathetic plexuses in front of, and adjacent to\r\nthe abdominal aorta, which already contain afferent and efferent spinal\r\nfibres derived from the pneumogastric, phrenic, and splanchnic nerves. A\r\nsmall number only of coarse nerve-filaments, a larger number of fine\r\nnerve-filaments, derived from the sacral nerves, proceed direct to the\r\ninternal genital organs; many of these fibres enter the lower extremity\r\nof the pelvic or inferior hypogastric pleans, some pass to the cervical\r\nganglia of the uterus. Below the bifurcation of the aorta and in front\r\nof the sacral promontory, a large number of the uterine nerves, both of\r\nspinal and of sympathetic origin, unite to form an azygos plexus which\r\nhas been shown by experiment to possess great functional importance.\r\nAnatomically this constitutes the upper undivided portion of the\r\nhypogastric plexus, which is the downward continuation of the abdominal\r\naortic sympathetic plexus; but inasmuch as it is the principal channel\r\nof nervous impulses to the uterus it is often known at the present day\r\nas the great uterine plexus (_plexus uterinus magnus_). The nerves to\r\nthe ovary and Fallopian tube (ovarian nerves) are derived from the\r\nspermatic (ovarian) plexus, an offshoot of the renal plexus; as the\r\nspermatic plexus descends, it is reinforced by branches from the\r\nabdominal aortic plexus, these branches often arising from a small\r\nganglion (spermatic ganglion). The hypogastric or great uterine plexus,\r\nsingle and median above, divides below into the paired pelvic or\r\ninferior hypogastric plexuses, which pass downward and forward on either\r\nside of the rectum; these plexuses are reinforced by spinal elements\r\nderived from the sacral nerves. Before the terminal expansions of the\r\npelvic or inferior hypogastric plexus enter the tissues of the internal\r\ngenital organs, the bladder, and the rectum, small masses of ganglionic\r\nmatter are interspersed among the nerve fibres.\r\n\r\nTo the above general sketch, which has been based on the synoptical\r\ndescription of _Chrobak von Rosthorn_, must be added a more detailed\r\naccount of the innervation of the ovaries, this branch of the subject\r\nbeing of especial importance. The nerves of the ovary are derived from\r\nthe sympathetic system, in part from the spermatic ganglion, in part\r\nfrom the second renal ganglion, and in part from the superior mesenteric\r\nplexus. The nerves of the ovary are for the most part vascular nerves,\r\nwhich unite before entering the ovary to form the ovarian plexus, and\r\nthen pass into the hilum with the vessels, envelop the vessels of the\r\nmedullary layer, and thence pass to the follicular region; exceedingly\r\nnumerous, they form a close-meshed network, surrounding all the vessels\r\nup to the finest capillary ramifications; those fibres which terminate\r\nin the capillary walls and those also which reach the follicles are\r\nregarded by _Riese_ as sensory. The great trunks of the uterine nerves\r\nare transversely disposed in relation to the great lateral vessels of\r\nthe uterus, and passing inward toward the mucous membrane they break up\r\ninto pencils of filaments; the uterine nerves proper are distributed for\r\nthe most part to the muscular substance. In the Fallopian tubes, the\r\nnerves form arches around the lumen of the tube; some fibres also pass\r\nto the longitudinal folds of the mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nThis expansion of the nerves of the cerebrospinal and sympathetic\r\nsystems in the female reproductive organs manifests the multiple\r\ninterconnection of the two systems in this region, and proves beyond\r\ndoubt that the sensory nerves of the genital organs have manifold\r\nconnections with the motor tracts of the whole organism on the one hand\r\nand with the sensory ganglia of the central nervous system on the other,\r\nand in addition with the vasomotor centres and with efferent motor and\r\nsecretory fibres.\r\n\r\nAs regards the vascular system of the female genital organs, the latter\r\nare supplied by the internal iliac artery. One of the two terminal\r\nbranches of the common iliac, the internal iliac artery, descends into\r\nthe pelvis over the sacro-iliac synchondrosis. Its branches may be\r\narranged in four groups: anterior group, the hypogastric, iliolumbar,\r\nand obturator arteries; posterior group, the lateral sacral, gluteal,\r\nand sciatic arteries; internal group, the inferior vesical, uterine, and\r\nmiddle haemorrhoidal arteries; inferior group, comprising a single\r\nartery only, the internal pudic; the uterine artery supplies the uterus\r\nand the vaginal fornices; the ovarian artery supplies the ovary, the\r\nFallopian tube, and the broad ligament of the uterus; the vaginal,\r\ncervicovaginal, or vesico-vaginal artery supplies the vagina; the\r\ninternal pudic artery supplies the vestibule and the clitoris; the\r\nsuperior and inferior external pudic arteries (branches of the femoral\r\nartery) supply the labia majora. The veins of the female genital organs\r\ncorrespond in general to the arteries in their course and nomenclature,\r\nand empty their blood into the internal iliac vein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 4.—The distribution of the lateral sacral arteries, the superior\r\n    haemorrhoidal or superior rectal artery, the uterine artery, the\r\n    ovarian artery and the distal portion of the internal pudic artery.\r\n    (From Toldt: Atlas of Human Anatomy.—Rebman Company, New York.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nAttention must also be paid to the extremely rich lymphatic vascular\r\nsystem of the female genital apparatus. The body of the uterus and the\r\nannexa of that organ, the neck of the uterus and the vaginal fornices,\r\nthe middle segment of the vagina, the lower segment of the vagina, the\r\nvestibule and the external genital organs—each of these possesses an\r\nindependent set of lymphatic vessels, leading moreover to independent\r\ngroups of lymphatic glands. It may be said that the lymph from the vulva\r\npasses to the inguinal glands, that from the vagina and the neck of the\r\nuterus to the internal and the external iliac lympathic glands, that\r\nfrom the upper part of the uterus and also that from the ovaries and\r\nFallopian tubes to the median group of lumbar lymphatic glands (also\r\nknown, from their position in front of the aorta and the vena cava, as\r\nthe aortic lymphatic glands) (_Chrobak von Rosthorn_).\r\n\r\nThe important influence which the genital processes exercise on the\r\nfemale organism as a whole is established not only by the anatomical\r\nrelations just described but also by a number of physiological\r\ninvestigations and experiments and by the result of operations on the\r\nfemale genital organs.\r\n\r\nThermic and mechanical stimulation of the female genitals has, as my own\r\nexperiments have shown, a notable influence on the heart and the general\r\ncirculation. In these experiments, when uterine douches were given at\r\ntemperatures of 4° C. (39° F.) and 45° C. (113° F.), the reflex nervous\r\nimpulse which resulted from these manipulations had a two-fold influence\r\non the circulation, manifesting itself first by an immediate and\r\nconsiderable augmentation in the functional activity of the heart, the\r\nfrequency of which was increased in a degree proportional to the nervous\r\nsensibility of the individual, and secondly by a notable rise in blood\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nWith a view to determining the influence of stimulation of the ovary on\r\nblood-pressure, _Röhrig_ carried out some experiments on bitches, from\r\nwhich it appeared that electrical stimulation of the ovary invariably\r\nproduced a remarkable increase in the general blood-pressure, an\r\nincrease ranging from twelve to twenty-four millimeters of mercury. It\r\nfurther appeared in the course of these experiments that toward the end\r\nof the period of stimulation the rise in blood-pressure was always\r\nfollowed by a decline; to which, however, a renewed rise of\r\nblood-pressure succeeded after the stimulation was discontinued,\r\nprovided the duration of this had not been excessive. Only after this\r\nsecond rise was the normal mean blood-pressure regained. Finally it was\r\nestablished that the pronounced phenomena of vagus-irritation exhibited\r\nby the curve during and immediately after the stimulation of the ovary\r\nwere invariable concomitants of the rise of blood-pressure produced by\r\nsuch stimulation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations of _Federns_, the blood-pressure undergoes\r\na rhythmical change between one menstrual period and the next, the\r\npressure curve being normally at its lowest at the time of the\r\ncommencement of the flow, and at its highest at some time during the two\r\ndays immediately preceding the flow. This rhythmical change of\r\nblood-pressure manifests itself also some time before the first onset of\r\nmenstruation, when the approach of puberty is indicated only by the\r\nmenstrual molimina.\r\n\r\nObservations made by _Kretschy_ in a patient with a gastric fistula have\r\nproved the influence exercised on gastric digestion by the physiological\r\nprocesses occurring in the female reproductive organs. In this patient,\r\nhis attention was especially directed to determining at what period of\r\ndigestion the secretion of acid by the stomach attains its maximum, and\r\nhow that secretion increases and diminishes. He observed that the\r\ndigestion of breakfast was completed in four and one-half hours, the\r\nacid-maximum occurring in the fourth hour, and the reaction of the\r\ngastric contents becoming neutral one and one-half hours later. This\r\napparently constant acid-curve began, however, to become irregular as\r\nsoon as the first symptoms of the approach of menstruation became\r\napparent. When the flow had actually begun, he found that the reaction\r\nof the gastric contents remained acid throughout the entire day. As soon\r\nas the flow was over, the normal acid-curve was immediately\r\nreëstablished.\r\n\r\nThese observations have been confirmed by _Fleischer_. This investigator\r\ncarried out his researches in menstruating women with normal stomachs,\r\nand found that with the appearance of the catamenia the process of\r\ndigestion was almost always notably retarded, but that with the\r\ndiminution and cessation of the flow digestion returned to the normal.\r\n\r\nBy stimulation of the central segment of the divided hypogastric or\r\ngreat uterine plexus, _Cyon_ was able to provoke vomiting, a\r\nconfirmation of the well-known physiological fact that irritative\r\ndisturbances of the female reproductive organs have a reflex influence\r\non the vomiting centre.\r\n\r\nIt is also clearly established that diverse stimulation of peripheral\r\nnerves, those for instance of the mammary gland, of the internal\r\ngenitals, or of the epigastrium, is capable of affecting the motor\r\ncentre of the uterus.\r\n\r\nWorthy of note also are _Strassmann’s_ experiments, showing that rise of\r\npressure in the ovary causes swelling and structural changes in the\r\nuterine mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nStriking also are _Neusser’s_ discoveries that during menstruation there\r\nis an increase in the eosinophil cells of the blood, and that by the\r\nintermediation of the sympathetic nervous system the ovaries exercise an\r\ninfluence on the hæmatopoietic function of the red marrow of the bones.\r\nMost noteworthy is the connection between the functional activity of the\r\novaries and osteomalacia. In this disease of metabolism we have to do,\r\naccording to _Fehling’s_ now generally accepted assumption, with a\r\ntrophoneurosis of the bones, a stimulation of the vasodilator nerves of\r\nthe osteal vessels, dependent on a reflex impulse from the ovaries. The\r\nconnecting path between the ovaries and the bones _Neusser_ finds in\r\nthis case also in the sympathetic nervous system.\r\n\r\nThe reflex influence exercised on the heart and the general circulation\r\nhas been shown also by the results of operations on the female genital\r\norgans. In cases in which the ovaries have been removed, or in which\r\nthese organs have been roughly handled, _Hegar_ has noticed a great\r\ndiminution in the frequency of the pulse, sometimes even cessation of\r\nthe heart’s action. In similar circumstances _Champonière_ also observed\r\nas a rule diminished frequency of the pulse, but in some cases increased\r\nfrequency. _Mariagalli_ and _Negri_ have described tachycardia following\r\nlaparotomy and the extirpation of double pyosalpinx. _Bonvalot_ has\r\npublished cases in which, in consequence of vaginal or intra-uterine\r\ninjections, in consequence of simple examination, and in consequence of\r\nthe performance of version, sudden death has resulted from cardiac\r\nsyncope.\r\n\r\nThe psychical influences which proceed from the female genital organs in\r\nthe different periods of sexual life have also great significance for\r\nthe organism as a whole. Manifold impulses both stimulating and\r\ndepressing arising in the reproductive organs affect the workings of the\r\nmind. The maiden at puberty is affected by the knowledge of sexuality;\r\nthe sexually mature woman, by the desire for sexual satisfaction, and by\r\nthe yearning for motherhood; the wife, by the processes of pregnancy,\r\nparturition, and suckling, or, on the other hand by the distressing\r\nconsciousness of sterility; the woman at the climacteric period, by the\r\nknowledge of the disappearance of her sexual potency. The mind is\r\nfurther sympathetically influenced by the stimulation of the terminals\r\nof the sensory nerves in the genital organs. Through the increase of\r\nsuch stimulation, through its spread to adjacent nerves and nerve tracts\r\nand to the entire nervous system, the mind is affected, directly by\r\nirradiation, or indirectly by vasomotor processes and spinal\r\nhyperæsthesia.\r\n\r\nPsychical manifestations and the nervous states associated with these\r\nare somewhat frequently, and even actual psychoses occasionally,\r\nencountered in the various phases of the sexual life of woman, sometimes\r\ntaking the form of violent sexual storms, which may indeed, as ordinary\r\nmenstrual reflexes, accompany every catamenial period.\r\n\r\nOf great interest are the facts which have, in recent times especially,\r\nbeen scientifically established, pointing to a certain periodicity, to\r\nan undulatory movement of the general bodily functions of the female\r\norganism, dependent upon the sexual life. The observations of _Goodman_,\r\n_Jacobi_, _von Ott_, _Rabuteau_, _Reinl_ and _Schichareff_, have shown\r\nthat in woman the principal vital processes pursue a cycle made up of\r\nstages of increased and diminished intensity, and that this periodicity\r\nof the chief general processes of vital activity finds expression also\r\nin the functions of the reproductive organs. _Goodman_ has compared this\r\nplay of general vital functions to an undulatory movement. According to\r\nthis writer, a woman’s life is passed in stages, each of which\r\ncorresponds in duration with a single menstrual cycle. Each of these\r\nstages exhibits two distinct halves, in which the vital processes are\r\nrespectively ebbing and flowing: in the latter we see an increase of all\r\nvital processes, a larger heat production, a rise in blood-pressure, and\r\nan increased excretion of urea; in the former we see, on the contrary,\r\nthat all these vital processes display a diminished intensity. The\r\nmoment when the period of increased vital activity is at an end, the\r\nmoment when the ebb begins, corresponds, according to _Goodman_, to the\r\ncommencement of the catamenial discharge.\r\n\r\n_Goodman_ sought for verification of this undulatory theory of the\r\nsexual life of woman in certain data regarding the bodily temperature\r\nand the blood-pressure. A more extensive research was undertaken by\r\n_Jacobi_, who, as the result of her observations, came to the following\r\nconclusions. In eight cases she noticed in the premenstrual epoch a rise\r\nof temperature ranging from 0.05° C. to 0.44° C. (0.09° F.–0.79° F.);\r\nand during the catamenial discharge a gradual fall of 0.039° C.–0.25° C.\r\n(0.072° F.–0.45° F.), never less, that is to say, than a quarter of a\r\ndegree Centigrade; but in the majority of cases the temperature did not,\r\nwhile the catamenia lasted, regain the normal mean. She further observed\r\nin the generality of cases an increased excretion of urea during the\r\npremenstrual epoch; and a notable fall in blood-pressure during\r\nmenstruation.\r\n\r\n_Reinl’s_ observations on healthy women, in whom menstruation ran a\r\nnormal course, showed that in the great majority of cases in the\r\npremenstrual epoch the temperature was elevated as compared with that of\r\nthe interval, that in eleven out of twelve cases the temperature\r\ngradually declined during menstruation, to fall in three-fourths of the\r\ncases below the mean temperature of the entire interval, and exhibiting\r\nin the post-menstrual epoch a still further depression, giving place,\r\nhowever, to a somewhat higher mean temperature during the first half of\r\nthe interval. In the second half of the interval a higher mean\r\ntemperature was observed than in the first half.\r\n\r\nIf we make a graphic representation of the mean differences in\r\ntemperature commonly observed throughout the various stages of an entire\r\nmenstrual cycle, we see that the curve does in fact take the form of a\r\nwave. That drawn by _Reinl_ is shown in the following figure: (FIG. 5.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 5.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe rising portion of the wave, the beginning of the tidal flow,\r\ncorresponds to the second half of the interval; the height of the tidal\r\nflow, the crest of the wave, corresponds to the premenstrual epoch. As\r\nthe flow gives place to the ebb, as the wave begins to decline, we come\r\nto the actual period of the catamenial discharge; later in the ebb is\r\nthe post-menstrual epoch, and the lowest portion of the declining wave\r\ncorresponds to the first half of the interval. Rhythmic changes\r\ncorresponding to those observed in the temperature have been recorded—at\r\nleast in isolated stages of the menstrual cycle—affecting the\r\nblood-pressure by _Jacobi_ and by _von Ott_, affecting the excretion of\r\nurea by _Jacobi_ and by _Rabuteau_, and affecting the pulse by _Hennig_.\r\nIt is evident that the vital activity of the organism attains its\r\nmaximum shortly before menstruation; and that with or immediately before\r\nthe appearance of the catamenial discharge, a decline of that activity\r\ncommences.\r\n\r\n_Schrader_, through his researches on metabolism during menstruation in\r\nrelation to the condition of the bodily functions during this process,\r\nhas established that immediately before menstruation the elimination of\r\nnitrogen in the fæces and the urine is at its lowest, a fact which\r\nindicates that at this period of the menstrual cycle the disintegration\r\nof albumen in the body is notably diminished.\r\n\r\n_Von Ott_ found in thirteen cases out of fourteen that at the beginning\r\nof the catamenial discharge or just before a considerable fall in\r\nblood-pressure occurred, and that throughout the flow the pressure\r\nalmost always remained below the mean, no rise taking place till\r\nmenstruation was finished; this fall in blood-pressure during\r\nmenstruation was more considerable than could be accounted for by the\r\nmoderate hæmorrhage. The same author, in conjunction with _Schichareff_,\r\nexamined fifty-seven healthy women in respect of heat-radiation,\r\nmuscular power, respiratory capacity, expiratory and inspiratory power,\r\nand tendon-reflexes. He found that the energy of the functions of the\r\nfemale body increased before the beginning of menstruation, but declined\r\nwith or immediately before the appearance of the catamenial discharge.\r\nHe exhibited this rhythmical variation in the vital processes by means\r\nof the following curve, in which the line _A B_ represents these\r\nphysiological variations, whilst on the abscissa line _c e_, the days of\r\nobservation are recorded, and the interval _m n_ represents the\r\nmenstrual period. The degree of intensity of the united functions is\r\nindicated by the numbers 0–100 on the ordinate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 6.\r\n]\r\n\r\nStill another point of view from which the influences affecting the\r\nfemale organism as a whole may be regarded has very recently become\r\napparent in consequence of the doctrine of _Brown-Séquard_ relating to\r\nthe internal secretions of ductless glands. As regards the female\r\nreproductive glands, which in consequence of their structure must be\r\nreferred to the group of ductless glands, and yet owing to their\r\nsecretory function must be classed among secreting glands (so that the\r\nnature of the ovary is that of a secreting gland without an excretory\r\nduct), it would appear that these glands are not concerned only with the\r\nspecific female reproductive functions of menstruation and ovulation,\r\nbut that they also exercise a powerful influence on the nutritive\r\nprocesses, on metabolism and hæmatopoiesis, and on growth and\r\ndevelopment in their mental as well as their physical relations.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that these glands under normal conditions enrich the\r\nblood with certain substances, which in part assist in hæmatopoiesis,\r\nand in part by regulating the vascular tone in the various organs are\r\nconcerned in the normal processes of assimilation and general\r\nmetabolism. According to _Etienne_ and _Demange_, ovariin possesses an\r\noxidising power similar to that possessed by spermin. Thus it becomes\r\neasy to understand how disturbances in the functions of the ovaries give\r\nrise to disturbances in the processes of general metabolism and of\r\nassimilation. Some go even further, though in doing so they leave the\r\nground of assured fact, suggesting that the ovary in certain\r\ncircumstances produces toxins, or that the normal ovary possesses an\r\nantitoxic function, and speaking of an occasional ovarian\r\nauto-intoxication of the body or of a menstrual intoxication. Thus,\r\nchlorosis is by some regarded as a disturbance of hæmatopoiesis,\r\ndependent on an abnormal condition of the female reproductive organs\r\nduring the period of development, and referable to a disturbance of the\r\ninternal secretion of the ovaries (_Charrin_, _von Noorden_, _Salmon_,\r\n_Etienne_, and _Demange_). And it is now generally assumed, the\r\nassumption being based on the observations recently made concerning the\r\norgano-therapeutic employment of the chemical constituents of the ovary,\r\nthat many of the disorders, and especially those connected with the\r\nvasomotor system, common during the climacteric period, are dependent on\r\nthe deficiency of the products of the internal secretion of the ovary\r\nthat accompanies the cessation of the menses.\r\n\r\nRecent experimental investigations on this subject have shown that the\r\ninterconnection between the female genital organs and the organism as a\r\nwhole, between the functions of the reproductive organs and the\r\nfunctions of other organs, does not depend on nervous influences only,\r\nbut that in this interconnection the blood vascular system and the\r\nlymphatic vascular system also play their parts. _Goltz_ has proved by\r\nactual experiment that the nervous influence on menstruation and\r\novulation is not the only determinant. In a bitch, he divided the spinal\r\ncord at the level of the first lumbar vertebra, and observed, as soon as\r\nthe animal had recovered from the operation, the appearance of the usual\r\nsigns of heat; the bitch was impregnated, and gave birth to one living\r\nand two dead puppies; lactation and sucking took place as in a normal\r\nanimal. When the bitch was killed and the body examined it was found\r\nthat no reunion had taken place in the severed spinal cord. The\r\nexperiments of _Halban_ gave similar results. He found that in apes, if\r\nthe ovaries are removed from their normal situation and successfully\r\ntransplanted to some region remote from the genital organs, the animals\r\nremain capable of menstruating. But if the ovaries, which have been\r\ntransplanted beneath the skin or beneath the peritoneum, are\r\nsubsequently entirely removed, menstruation, which has continued\r\nregularly after the first operation, ceases altogether after the second.\r\nIt follows from these experiments that the cessation of the menstrual\r\nprocess may be considered to be brought about through the intermediation\r\nof the lymphatic or blood-vascular system, by the absence of a kind of\r\ninternal secretion.\r\n\r\n_Loewy_ and _Richter_ have further proved by experiment that in spayed\r\nbitches the consumption of nitrogen is less by about 20 per cent. and\r\nthe entire gaseous interchange less by about 9 per cent., as compared\r\nwith what takes place in normal animals, and that this change in\r\nrespiratory metabolism lasts for a long time after the oöphorectomy, for\r\nas much as nine to twelve months. If dried ovaries are given to such\r\nanimals in their food, the gaseous interchange rises to the former level\r\nand even higher.\r\n\r\nThe undulatory movement of the vital processes in woman is apparently in\r\nsome way dependent on ovulation, though the nature of the connection has\r\nnot hitherto been fully elucidated. This view is confirmed by the fact\r\nthat no such rhythmic variation in the bodily functions can be detected\r\neither in girls under thirteen years of age, or in women from\r\nfifty-eight to eighty years of age in whom menstrual activity has\r\nentirely disappeared. The menstrual rhythm begins at puberty and ends\r\nwhen ovulation ceases.\r\n\r\nA further contribution to the doctrine of the undulatory movement of the\r\nvital processes in woman is to be found in my own observations that\r\npathological symptoms which have become manifest before and at the time\r\nof the first onset of menstruation, and have given but little trouble\r\nthroughout the period of developed and regular sexual activity, are apt\r\nwhen menstruation ceases to recrudesce, and to become as prominent as\r\nthey were at the commencement of the sexual life. Women who at the time\r\nof puberty suffered from cardiac troubles, from digestive disturbances,\r\nor from various forms of nervous irritation, and in whom as they grew up\r\nthese disorders passed more or less into abeyance, are apt at the\r\nclimacteric period to exhibit, as I have frequently been able to\r\nobserve, a violent return of these symptoms, in the form, as the case\r\nmay be, of tachycardia, of dyspeptic troubles, or of psychoneuroses. In\r\nthis connection we may mention an observation of _Potain’s_, who\r\ndistinguishes a peculiar form of chlorosis, occurring in individuals of\r\ndelicate constitution, which, though apparently cured, reappears at the\r\nmenopause.\r\n\r\nRelated to the sexual life of woman is another attribute, one intimately\r\nconnected with the idea of the female sex, and one which since the\r\nprimeval days of humanity has filled men with delight and poets with\r\ninspiration—the attribute of beauty.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of woman, a prominent secondary sexual character, makes its\r\nfirst appearance at puberty, when the girl’s form, hitherto\r\nundifferentiated in its external bodily configuration, begins to assume\r\na soft and rounded appearance, when the features become regular, the\r\nbreasts enlarge, and the pubic hair begins to grow—when, in short, to\r\nthe primary sexual characters already existing, the secondary sexual\r\ncharacters are superadded.\r\n\r\nFeminine beauty continues to increase until the attainment of sexual\r\nmaturity. In her third decade woman arrives at the acme of her sexual\r\nlife and at the same time attains the perfection of her beauty.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing sexual phases, pregnancy, parturition, and lactation, entail\r\na decline in beauty, not rapid indeed, but advancing gradually, with the\r\nslow yet sure-footed pace of time. The organic revolutions accompanying\r\nthese processes leave traces recorded upon the surface of the body in\r\nconspicuous and indelible characters. The illnesses, also, which so\r\noften accompany the fulfilment of sexual functions, in injuring health\r\nimpair also beauty.\r\n\r\nA woman who has given birth to and nursed an infant begins to lay on\r\nfat, and this tendency to obesity becomes more pronounced as the\r\nclimacteric period approaches. The breasts become inelastic and pendent,\r\nthe abdomen becomes ungracefully prominent; the tonicity of the entire\r\norganism gradually declines, and, in consequence of the loss of\r\nelasticity in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, the dreaded wrinkles\r\nmake their appearance and the features become wizened. Beauty is a thing\r\nof the past. With the cessation of the sexual life the external\r\nsecondary sexual characters disappear, and the old woman is even farther\r\nremoved than the old man from our conception of beauty.\r\n\r\nAs _Mantegazza_ insists, the beauties peculiar to women are one and all\r\nsexual; they depend, that is to say, upon the peculiar functions that\r\nnature has allotted to woman in the great mystery of procreation. One of\r\nthe most vivid and poetical descriptions in ancient or modern literature\r\nof these secondary sexual characters on which feminine beauty depends is\r\nto be found in the Song of Solomon.\r\n\r\nIn the following figure (FIG. 7) the curve of beauty of woman is given\r\nas drawn up by _Stratz_. In one case it may rise very quickly, to\r\ndecline with equal quickness—the so-called _beauté du diable_;[16] in\r\nother cases, again, the curve rises very slowly, and declines also very\r\nslowly, the culmination of the curve being in this case attained later,\r\nand when attained being absolutely higher, than in the case of the\r\nsteeper curve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 7.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe age at which the maximum of beauty is attained is a very variable\r\none. In the southern races this often occurs as early as the fourteenth\r\nor fifteenth year of life; but in the peoples of the Teutonic stock,\r\nGermans, Dutch, Scandinavians, and English, not as a rule before the\r\ntwentieth year, and it may be even later. _Stratz_ has known cases in\r\nwhich women did not attain the prime of their beauty until the thirtieth\r\nand even the thirty-third year. The same author, a most competent\r\nauthority as regards the subject of feminine beauty, affirms that a\r\nbeautiful woman is most beautiful when the period of maximum beauty\r\ncoincides in her case with the first month of her first pregnancy. With\r\nthe commencement of pregnancy the processes of nutrition are\r\naccelerated, all the tissues are tensely filled, the skin is more\r\ndelicately and at the same time more brightly tinted owing to the\r\ngreater activity of the circulation, the breasts become firmer and more\r\nelastic. Thus the attractive characteristics of beauty at its fullest\r\nmaturity become enhanced, but for a short time only, since the\r\nenlargement of the abdomen in the further course of pregnancy impairs\r\nthe harmony of the figure. Finally we must point out, before dismissing\r\nthis subject, that women of the so-called better classes arrive as a\r\nrule at maturity later, and remain beautiful for a longer period, than\r\nwomen of the working classes.\r\n\r\nThe degree to which the female organism as a whole is influenced by the\r\nprocesses of the sexual life that occur in the genital organ depends\r\nupon many of the characteristics that combine to make up the\r\nindividuality. Inherited characteristics, temperament, and race, play a\r\ngreat part in this connection; and not less important than these are the\r\nsocial conditions, the environment, in which the women under\r\nconsideration pass their life. Thus, among women belonging to the\r\npoorer, labouring classes, the reflex manifestations in other organs\r\ndependent upon the processes of the genital organs are less frequent and\r\nless intense than among women belonging to the well-to-do strata of\r\nsociety and to the cultured classes; less also in the country than in\r\nlarge towns. In phlegmatic individuals, such manifestations exhibit less\r\nintensity than in those of an active, ardent temperament; they are less\r\nfrequent in persons with a powerful constitution than in those endowed\r\nby inheritance with an unstable nervous system. Finally, they are less\r\noften encountered among families whose upbringing has aimed at hardening\r\nthe constitution and at inculcating the control of instinctive impulses,\r\nthan among those in whom from early childhood sensibility and\r\nimpulsiveness have been given a loose rein.\r\n\r\nExtremely variable also are the sympathetic disturbances and morbid\r\nstates which depend on the processes of the sexual life of woman. “Le\r\ncri de l’organe souffrant ne vient pas de l’utérus, mais de tout\r\nl’organisme,”[17] says _Courty_. And a large number of isolated\r\nobservations has shown how complex are the relations between the healthy\r\nand unhealthy female genital organs and the other organs of the body as\r\nwell as the organism as a whole. Precise and incontestable proofs exist\r\nof such relations between the female genital organs and morbid changes\r\nin the eye and ear, the skin, the respiratory organs, and the vascular\r\nand nervous systems.\r\n\r\nThe influence exercised by the reproductive system on the general vital\r\nprocesses of woman is indicated also by the general statistics of\r\nmortality and the incidence of disease. Mortality in women, the earliest\r\nyears of childhood being left out of consideration, is at its highest\r\nprecisely during the great sexual epochs, namely at the time of puberty,\r\nduring pregnancy, during the puerperium, and at the climacteric period.\r\nThe complete performance of the reproductive functions entails a higher\r\nproportion of illnesses and death; and statistical records show that the\r\nmortality of married women between twenty and forty years of age, during\r\nthe period, that is to say, in which in consequence of marriage they\r\nfulfil the duties of sexual intercourse and procreation, and are exposed\r\nto the dangers connected with these sexual acts, is much higher than the\r\nmortality of unmarried women of corresponding ages. Infection with the\r\ngonococcus and with the virus of syphilis, chronic salpingitis,\r\nmetritis, and parametritis, the manifold diseases of pregnancy, the\r\ndiseases of the puerperium, the various displacements of the uterus,\r\nosteomalacia—all these are pathological states the dependence of which\r\nupon the sexual life of the married or at any rate sexually active woman\r\nis indisputable. But the complete renunciation of sexual activity\r\nappears also to exercise an injurious influence on the health, and to\r\ngive rise or at least predispose to morbid manifestations. Hysteria, for\r\ninstance, chlorosis, uterine myomata, and various neuroses, have long\r\nbeen supposed to depend in part upon such renunciation, though the\r\ncausal connection cannot be regarded as yet fully established.\r\n\r\nEspecially true as regards woman, indeed, is that which _Ribbing_ says\r\nconcerning the sexual life in general: “Since all human life and being\r\nhas its origin in sexual relations, these sexual relations may be\r\nregarded as the heart of humanity. We may work day and night for the\r\ngood of humanity, we may sacrifice for that good our time and our blood,\r\nbut all this work and all this sacrifice appear to me to remain useless\r\nif we neglect and despise the sexual life, the eternally self-renewing\r\nelementary school of true altruism.”\r\n\r\nFrom the vital phase in which, marked by the visible manifestations of\r\npuberty and by the first appearance of menstruation, ovulation is\r\nassumed to begin, the sexual life of woman continues to the period of\r\nlife in which, marked by the climacteric cessation of menstruation,\r\novulation also ceases. The total duration of this sexual period in\r\nwoman’s life is usually about thirty years; but it is subject to great\r\nvariations, from six to forty-six years according to the available\r\nstatistics, these variations depending upon climate, race, constitution,\r\nand the sexual activity of the person under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe duration and the intensity of the sexual life of woman depends upon\r\na series of external conditions affecting the individual, but especially\r\nupon the inherited predispositions, upon the constitutional conditions,\r\nupon the varying vital power of the individual. My own observations have\r\nled me to formulate, as a general law, that the earlier a woman\r\n(climatic and social conditions being similar in the cases under\r\ncomparison) arrives at puberty, the earlier, that is to say, that\r\nmenstruation first makes its appearance, the greater will be the\r\nintensity and the longer the duration of sexual activity, the more will\r\nthe woman in question be predisposed to bear many children, the more\r\npowerfully will the sexual impulse manifest itself in her, and the later\r\nwill the menopause appear. It seems that in such women a more intense\r\nvitality animates the reproductive system, bringing about an earlier\r\nripening of ova, a more favorable predisposition on the part of these\r\nova to fertilization by the spermatozoa, a livelier manifestation of\r\nsexual sensibility, and a longer duration of ovarian functional\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nMy general views on this subject are embodied in the following\r\npropositions:\r\n\r\n1. The duration of sexual activity is less in the women belonging to the\r\ncountries of southern Europe than in those belonging to the countries of\r\nnorthern Europe. It would appear that in those climates in which\r\novulation begins sooner and menstruation first appears at an earlier\r\nage, the menopause also appears earlier; but that, on the contrary, in\r\nthose climates in which puberty is late in its appearance, the decline\r\nof sexual activity is similarly postponed.\r\n\r\n2. Women in our mid-European climates, in whom puberty appears at an\r\nearly age, the first menstruation occurring between the ages of thirteen\r\nand sixteen, exhibit a more prolonged duration of the sexual life, of\r\nmenstrual functional activity, than women in whom menstruation begins\r\nlate, between the ages of seventeen and twenty. Extremely early\r\nappearance of the first menstruation—so early as to be altogether\r\nabnormal—has, however, the same significance as abnormally late onset of\r\nmenstruation; both indicate that the sexual life will be of short\r\nduration.\r\n\r\n3. Women whose reproductive organs have been the seat of a sufficient\r\namount of functional activity, who have had frequent sexual intercourse,\r\nhave given birth to several children, and have themselves suckled their\r\nchildren, have a sexual life of longer duration, as manifested by the\r\ncontinuance of menstruation, than women whose circumstances have been\r\njust the opposite of these, unmarried women, for instance, women early\r\nwidowed, and barren women. Sexual intercourse at a very early age,\r\nhowever, accelerates the onset of the climacteric period and the\r\ntermination of the sexual life. The same result follows severe or too\r\nfrequent confinements.\r\n\r\n4. The sexual life has a shorter duration in the women of the laboring\r\nclasses and belonging to the lower strata of social life, as compared\r\nwith upper class and well-to-do women. Bodily hardships, grief, and\r\nanxiety also hasten the onset of sexual death.\r\n\r\n5. Women who are weakly and always ailing have a shorter sexual life\r\nthan women who are powerfully built and always in good health. When\r\nirregularities and disorders have appeared in the various sexual phases,\r\nthe decline of sexual activity occurs earlier than in women whose\r\nfunctions have in this respect been normal. Certain constitutional\r\nconditions, such as extreme obesity, certain acute diseases, such as\r\ntyphoid fever, malaria, and cholera, and certain diseases of the uterus\r\nand its annexa, chronic inflammatory conditions for instance, bring\r\nabout a notable shortening of the duration of the sexual life.\r\n\r\nIn 500 cases that have come under my own observation, the women\r\nconcerned belonging to very various nationalities, the duration of the\r\nsexual life, as witnessed by the continuance of menstruation, was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nMenstruation continued for:\r\n\r\n                          6 years in  1 woman.\r\n                          7 years in  1 woman.\r\n                          9 years in  2 women.\r\n                         11 years in  4 women.\r\n                         15 years in  6 women.\r\n                         16 years in  8 women.\r\n                         17 years in 12 women.\r\n                         18 years in 15 women.\r\n                         19 years in  9 women.\r\n                         20 years in  6 women.\r\n                         21 years in 18 women.\r\n                         22 years in 20 women.\r\n                         23 years in 24 women.\r\n                         24 years in 18 women.\r\n                         25 years in 16 women.\r\n                         26 years in 25 women.\r\n                         27 years in 26 women.\r\n                         28 years in 29 women.\r\n                         29 years in 36 women.\r\n                         30 years in 22 women.\r\n                         31 years in 32 women.\r\n                         32 years in 49 women.\r\n                         33 years in 31 women.\r\n                         34 years in 26 women.\r\n                         35 years in 12 women.\r\n                         36 years in 12 women.\r\n                         37 years in 10 women.\r\n                         38 years in  8 women.\r\n                         39 years in  6 women.\r\n                         40 years in  2 women.\r\n                         43 years in  2 women.\r\n                         45 years in  1 woman.\r\n                         46 years in  1 woman.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the duration of the sexual life varies from 6 to 46\r\nyears. The most frequent duration is one of 32 years, next to this one\r\nof 29, next again, 31, 33, and 37 years, respectively. In 6 women only\r\ndid the duration of the sexual life exceed 40 years, and in 4 only was\r\nit less than 11 years. In half of all my cases the duration of the\r\nsexual life was between 27 and 34 years, and from these figures we\r\nobtain an average duration of about 30 years.\r\n\r\nFor North Germany, _Krieger_ gives data from which it appears that in\r\nthis region the average duration of the sexual life is 30.49 years. In\r\nmore than half of the 722 cases recorded by this writer the duration was\r\nbetween 31 and 37 years.

Still more favorable is the contrast\r\nbetween the temperate zone and the countries of the tropics, in which\r\nthe duration of the period of menstrual activity is limited to eighteen\r\nor twenty years. According to some isolated observations the duration of\r\nsexual activity in Arabian women in Africa was as little as nine years.\r\n\r\nA certain influence on the duration of the sexual life is exercised by\r\nthe commencement of menstruation at an earlier or later age than the\r\naverage. The total duration of menstrual activity is more variable in\r\nwomen who begin to menstruate early than in women who begin to\r\nmenstruate late, in whom the duration of the sexual life is a more\r\nregular one. In those women who begin to menstruate early the mean\r\nduration of the sexual life is about thirty-three years, in those who\r\nbegin to menstruate late it is about twenty-seven years.\r\n\r\nThe following data, based on the observation of 250 cases, are published\r\nby _W.

Mayer_, _Krieger_ has instituted a comparison\r\nbetween the duration of menstrual activity in 101 women who began to\r\nmenstruate early and 180 women who began to menstruate late, finding in\r\nthe case of the former a mean duration of 33.673 years, and in the case\r\nof the latter a mean duration of 27.344 years, showing therefore a\r\nsexual life longer on an average by 6.429 years in those in whom puberty\r\nwas early as compared with those in whom puberty was late.\r\n\r\nFrom the tables of _Tilt_, based on the observation of 164 cases, 76\r\nwomen in whom menstruation appeared early and 88 in whom it appeared\r\nlate, we learn that among the former the shortest duration of menstrual\r\nactivity was 18 years, among the latter 12 years; among the former the\r\nlongest duration was 37 years, among the latter only 33. The majority of\r\nthose who began to menstruate early continued to menstruate for 28, 31,\r\n32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, or 39 years; those who began to menstruate late,\r\nfor 23, 27, 28, 30, or 31 years. The mean duration of the sexual life in\r\nthose who began to menstruate early was 33.66 years; in those who began\r\nto menstruate late it was 28.28 years. Since the average duration of the\r\nmenstrual function is given by _Tilt_ as 31.33 years, those who began to\r\nmenstruate early exceeded this average by 2.33 years, while those who\r\nbegan to menstruate late exhibited a duration of menstrual activity of\r\nat least three years less than the average.\r\n\r\nIn addition to climate, nationality, and the age at which menstruation\r\nbegins, the sexual activity of women also exercises an influence on the\r\nduration of their sexual life, and of especial importance in this\r\nconnection are the number of children born, and exercise or neglect of\r\nthe function of lactation. From my own observations on this matter it\r\nappears, that in women who are healthy and of powerful constitution,\r\nwhose reproductive organs have been sufficiently exercised, who have\r\ngiven birth to several children and have suckled these children\r\nthemselves, the duration of menstrual activity is in general notably\r\nlonger than in women whose circumstances have been just the opposite in\r\nthese respects. Among the women in my own series of cases in whom\r\nmenstrual activity lasted longest, of the 177 women in whom menstruation\r\nceased between the forty-fifth and the fiftieth year of life, 1 only was\r\nunmarried, 2 were married but childless, 32 married with 1 or 2 children\r\nonly, and 142 married and with more than 2 children; of the 89 women in\r\nwhom menstruation ceased between the fiftieth and the fifty-fifth year\r\nof life, none were either unmarried or childless, 19 were married with 1\r\nor 2 children, 17 married and with more than 2 children; of the 17 women\r\nin whom menstruation ceased later than the fifty-fifth year of life,\r\nthere were 2 only with less than 2 children, but 10 who had each given\r\nbirth to from 6 to 8 children. A similar influence is exercised by the\r\nfunction of lactation. Among 40 women who had not suckled their\r\nchildren, the average duration of menstrual activity was 4 years less\r\nthan the general mean.\r\n\r\nAs regards the conditions of life, _L. Mayer_ affirms that the duration\r\nof sexual activity among well-to-do women is on the average a year and a\r\nhalf longer than among women of the working classes.\r\n\r\n_Metschnikoff_ has drawn attention to the remarkable disharmony in the\r\ndevelopment of three of the phases of the sexual life of woman, inasmuch\r\nas the sexual impulse, the union of the sexes, and the capacity for\r\nprocreation, which, considering their nature and purpose, might have\r\nbeen expected to be attuned so as to act in harmony, exhibit as a matter\r\nof fact no such relation; the different factors of the sexual function\r\ndevelop independently and unharmoniously. In a child not yet fitted to\r\nfulfil the function of procreation, the sexual impulse will none the\r\nless make its appearance, and be liable to misuse. In the girl the\r\npelvis does not attain that complete development which fits it for the\r\nprocess of parturition until toward the age of twenty, whilst puberty\r\noccurs at the age of sixteen. “A girl of ten is capable of aspiring to\r\nplay the part of a woman, but not before the age of sixteen is she\r\nfitted to play that part, nor indeed fitted to become a mother before\r\nthe age of twenty.”\r\n\r\nIn general, we may say, regarding the women of our own part of the\r\nworld, that in those who are healthy, who lead a regular life, are well\r\nfed, free from the pressure of anxieties, with their sexual functions\r\nsufficiently exercised, the duration of the sexual life is longer than\r\nin women whose circumstances are the reverse of those just enumerated.\r\nIt is a sign of decadence when women of the well-to-do classes, leading\r\na life of ease, manifest a diminished duration of the sexual life. The\r\ngreatest physical power and the highest ethical development are\r\nassociated with a lengthening of life in general, and associated also\r\nwith a lengthening alike in the sexual life of woman and the sexual\r\npotency of man. A decline in morals and culture entails a diminution of\r\nsexual vital capacity, this being true alike of individuals, of\r\nfamilies, and of nations. Woman is venerated and valued the more, the\r\nlonger the duration of her sexual life; a woman in whom the sexual life\r\nis short quickly loses value and significance, both in domestic and in\r\nsocial circles.\r\n\r\nThe social significance of the sexual life of woman is\r\ndisproportionately greater and farther reaching than the sexuality of\r\nthe male, as the former is concerned with the fundamental principles of\r\nhuman social life, influencing the constitution of the family, and\r\ncontrolling the good of the coming race. Sexual purity, which to the\r\nyouth is a romantic dream, is to the maiden a vital condition of\r\nexistence; adultery, in the husband a pardonable transgression, is in\r\nthe wife an overwhelming sin committed against family life. To the\r\nfreedom of the male in affairs of love is opposed the strict restraint\r\nof the female, based on monogamic marriage. The sexual needs and desires\r\nof the female are transformed in an ideal manner by means of the feeling\r\nof duty of the wife and mother; the violent pressure of the sexual\r\nimpulse is restrained by the opposition of ethical forces. When this\r\nrestraint fails, the running off the rails that ensues has a far\r\nprofounder influence in the case of the female than of the male, an\r\ninfluence not limited to her own personality, but dragging down the\r\nwhole family into the abyss of consequences, into the depths of moral\r\nand physical destruction.\r\n\r\nThough in nature everywhere the same, the sexual life of woman exhibits\r\nin the various gradations of social life different outward\r\nmanifestations, from the brutal sexual congress that does not greatly\r\nshun publicity, to the modern would-be philosophical free love. And\r\nthroughout all variations the two darkest points remain, the\r\nillegitimate child and venereal infection, both of which entail upon the\r\nwoman the most unspeakable anxieties and the greatest possible misery,\r\nwhilst the man who is in either case to blame passes comparatively\r\nunscathed.\r\n\r\nThe social sexual position of woman suffers most at the present day from\r\nthe mature age at which under existing social conditions men are alone\r\nable to marry and from the ever-increasing number of cases of venereal\r\ninfection. In both these directions social science and medical skill\r\nmust work hand in hand for the amelioration of the sexual life of woman.\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth century falls the duty of furnishing a solution for\r\nthese problems. Contesting voices are heard on all sides. _Tolstoi’s_\r\nrigid demand for complete sexual abstinence, the exhortation of the\r\nprofessors of the German universities to their students in favor of\r\nmoral purity, the associations for the official prevention of venereal\r\ndiseases, the agitation among young men in favor of abstinence from\r\nsexual intercourse before marriage, finally, the clamorous voices of the\r\nsupporters of women’s rights—all these are influences within the sphere\r\nof sexual morality, which must lead slowly but surely to extensive\r\nsocial changes in the sexual life of women.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the sexual life of woman, which for many centuries was\r\nconcealed by a thick veil from the eyes of the profane, or was viewed\r\nonly through the frosted glass of poetical metaphor, has in recent times\r\nassumed a quite revolting character. Not only have the acquired\r\nliberties and the social aims of the present day a tendency to give to\r\nwomen in general a freer and higher position, to emancipate them from\r\nthe bonds in which owing to the conditions of family life they have so\r\nlong been shackled, but some members of the women’s rights party go even\r\nfarther, and demand for women greater freedom in the sphere of sexual\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nWith this end in view the sexual life of woman is used as the fulcrum of\r\nthe lever, and is withdrawn from the twilight into the open light of\r\nday, or indeed too often into a dazzling and altogether false\r\nillumination. Women writers especially, who have hitherto been\r\naccustomed to delude themselves and the world with sensational\r\nrepresentations of the feminine soul, of feminine modesty, and the\r\nfineness of feminine sensibility in matters sexual, now find their\r\ngreatest joy in unveiling themselves and their sisters before the face\r\nof all the world, and in discussing in the plainest language the most\r\nintimate processes of the genital organs. In writings exhibiting but\r\nlittle good taste, though all the more temperament, they emphasize again\r\nand again one side only of the sexual life, to wit, the sexual impulse,\r\nthe force of which is intentionally exaggerated to a high degree, so\r\nthat it is described as a mighty current of passion, which may with\r\ngreat pains be held in check for a season, but must ultimately break\r\nloose, and with devastating rage must overwhelm everything which has\r\nhitherto been regarded as discipline and good morals. Young girls, even,\r\nstep down into the arena to take part in the contest concerning the\r\nreform that is to take place in the relations between men and women.\r\nEspecially sensational in this connection was _Eine für Viele_. _Aus dem\r\nTagebuche eines Mädchens von Vera_,[18] a book which, totally ignoring\r\nthe biological differentiation of the sexes and their diverse\r\nsociological course of development, goes so far as to insist that from\r\nthe man entering upon marriage, as from the woman, sexual purity and\r\nvirginity are to be demanded. (The heroine of the book commits suicide\r\nbecause her lover has in earlier years had experience of sexual\r\nintercourse.)\r\n\r\nFrom a mistaken standpoint other supporters of women’s rights oppose the\r\nideal method in sex-relations, life-long monogamy, and the ideal of\r\nsexual sensibility, motherhood, and they put forward quite new sexual\r\npretensions on behalf of women, as belonging to them by natural right.\r\nUpon these pretensions it is the duty of physicians, who truly know and\r\ntruly prize womanhood, to pass their judgment, and that judgment, which\r\nwill find ample justification in the ensuing descriptions of the\r\nindividual phases of the sexual life of woman, is that the modern\r\nmovement on behalf of the emancipation of women goes much too far. We do\r\nnot, however, mean to imply that this movement is totally unjustified.\r\n\r\nThe growing girl must not, as has hitherto been the case, be kept in a\r\nstate of ignorance (which is indeed in most cases apparent merely)\r\nregarding the sexual processes of her own body, she must no longer, when\r\nshe asks to be informed concerning these matters, be put off with\r\nconventional lies and prevarication. But her enlightenment must not be\r\neffected in such a manner as to lead to excitement and excessive\r\nstimulation, to the awakening of slumbering feelings, and to the\r\nconversion of fantasy into a devouring flame. Sexual enlightenment must\r\nnot be made an excuse for the unchaining of sensibility. When about to\r\nbe married, a woman should certainly be instructed regarding her sexual\r\nduties and rights, and enter as one well informed into the act in which\r\nshe is to play a leading part. But she ought not, with the excessive\r\nvaluation of herself attained in recent times, to regard the man as her\r\nenemy, as one whom she is always justified in fighting and always ready\r\nto fight with the equal weapons of sexual transgression. It cannot be\r\ndoubted that the ideal of “pure marriage” at an early age is one greatly\r\nto be prized as the foundation of a powerful future generation; but the\r\nreal nature of the male must not be overlooked, nor must his sexual\r\nhonor be put to too difficult a test. We regard as reasonable the modern\r\ndemand of woman that in marriage her individuality should not be buried,\r\nand that space should be given for the development of her personality;\r\nbut every sober-minded person will reject the “moral demand” for “ideal\r\npassion” in accordance with “entire mutual freedom” in the sexual\r\nrelation between man and wife, and will regard such free love as social\r\ninsanity and as a barbaric retrogression toward the rude sexual habits\r\nof savage peoples. Further, in view of the continually increasing\r\nintensity of the struggle for existence and in view of the difficulties\r\nof the task of rearing children, we cannot fail to recognize that it is\r\nnot right for women to be overburdened with the task of reproduction,\r\nand that she does not live simply and solely for the bearing of\r\nchildren—but those rush to the other extreme who undervalue motherhood\r\nand the duties of maternity, who speak scornfully of the woman who is “a\r\nmother, and a mother only,” who despise women whom they regard merely as\r\n“means for the production of children,” and who employ all possible\r\nmethods to free women from the pressing claims of nature and of society.\r\n\r\nIn all social circumstances, and in all times the great principle of\r\nsexual morality must dominate the sexual life of woman. As the ethical\r\ncharacteristics of the three great epochs in that sexual life we\r\nrecognize the purity of the maiden, the faithfulness of the wife, and\r\nthe love of the mother. But within the limits imposed by these demands\r\nit is still possible to satisfy the modern claim for a free development\r\nof the personality, and to accommodate the circumstances of the sexual\r\nlife to the individual vital needs and vital claims of the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  I. THE SEXUAL EPOCH OF THE MENARCHE.\r\n\r\n                               (PUBERTY.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term _menarche_ (μήν, a month, ἀρχή, the beginning) was introduced\r\nby me into medical literature to denote the period of life in which, as\r\na sign of puberty, menstruation first makes its appearance.\r\n\r\nThe age at which this occurs is subject to variations depending upon\r\nrace, occupation, hereditary tendencies, and climate; but in Germany and\r\nAustria the average age at puberty is 14 or 15, the extreme limits being\r\n12 to 19.\r\n\r\nUntil about the age of 13, the physical differentiation of the sexes,\r\nexcept for the anatomical peculiarities of the genital organs, is in our\r\nclimates a trifling one. But at puberty the important changes occur by\r\nwhich the sexes are so strikingly differentiated. Whereas in the growing\r\nboy all physical change takes the form of increasing strength and\r\nenergy, in the development of the girl, we note the appearances of the\r\nrounded outlines so characteristic of womanhood. At the same time the\r\nvoice alters, becoming less sharp, with a softer quality, and yet a\r\nfuller tone; and we may observe that young brunettes have commonly a\r\ncontralto voice, young blondes, more often a soprano. The intellectual\r\nchanges undergone by the girl at puberty are no less extensive and\r\ncharacteristic than the physical changes. In brief, the\r\nundifferentiated, neuter girl is transformed into a young woman, endowed\r\nwith all the attributes, mental and bodily, characteristic of\r\nfemininity.\r\n\r\nAs regards the age at which the menarche usually occurs, and the manner\r\nin which its occurrence is anticipated or retarded by the various\r\ninfluences already mentioned, the following propositions may be put\r\nforward, based on the available statistics and observations:\r\n\r\n1. Climate is an important factor. In the torrid zone, menstruation\r\nappears at a very early age, on the average from 11 to 14; in the\r\ntemperate zone, it appears later, on the average from the age of 13 to\r\n16; in the frigid zone, later still, on the average from the age of 15\r\nto 18. The mean temperature of the atmosphere appears to have a direct\r\ninfluence on the age at which menstruation begins, the hotter the\r\nclimate, the earlier being the menarche. The height of the place of\r\nresidence above the sea level and its distance from the coast also have\r\na certain influence.\r\n\r\n2. Race and constitution have a distinct influence upon the age at which\r\nmenstruation makes its appearance. In women of the Semitic races the\r\nmenarche occurs earlier than in women of the Aryan races. The average\r\nage at which menstruation begins is in Jewish girls, from 14 to 15; in\r\nMagyar girls from 15 to 16; in German girls from 16 to 16½; and in\r\nSlavonic girls from 16 to 17.\r\n\r\nIn general the menarche is earlier in girls of a sanguine, lively\r\ntemperament and a powerful constitution than in girls of a phlegmatic\r\ntemperament and a weakly constitution; further, other things being\r\nequal, menstruation appears earlier in brunettes, girls with black hair,\r\nthick skin, dark eyes, and a dark complexion, than it appears in\r\nblondes, girls with light hair, thin skin, blue eyes, and a fair\r\ncomplexion.\r\n\r\n3. The age at which menstruation begins is also affected by the\r\nconditions of life and the social circumstances. In the higher circles\r\nof society, in the upper, well-to-do classes, menstruation appears\r\nearlier than among women of the laboring classes, who are compelled to\r\nstrive for their daily bread. Amongst upper-class girls the menarche\r\noccurs at the age of 14 in one-fourth of their number, whereas among\r\nlower-class girls barely one-sixth begin to menstruate at the age of 14.\r\n\r\nIn large towns, again, menstruation appears earlier than in small towns,\r\nwhilst in the open country the menarche is still further delayed. In the\r\nwomen of Paris the average age at the menarche is 14 years and 6 months,\r\nin the women of smaller French towns it is 14 years and 9 months, in\r\nFrench countrywomen it is 14 years and 10 months.\r\n\r\nHow far the mode of nutrition is concerned in the production of these\r\nresults is not yet determined.\r\n\r\n4. The time of the menarche appears to be influenced by inheritance to\r\nthis extent, that the daughters of women who began to menstruate early\r\nbegin themselves to menstruate at an early age, whereas in other\r\nfamilies we observe that both mothers and daughters began to menstruate\r\nlate. But this relation is by no means a constant one.\r\n\r\n_Ploss_ has collected observations made in various countries and towns\r\nregarding the age at which menstruation begins, and the mean results of\r\nthese observations are given below.\r\n\r\nThe average age at which menstruation began was:\r\n\r\n            In Swedish Lapland 18 years,  0 months,  0 days.\r\n            In Christiania     16 years,  9 months, 25 days.\r\n            In Copenhagen      16 years,  9 months, 12 days.\r\n            In Munich          16 years,  5 months, 12 days.\r\n            In Göttingen       16 years,  2 months,  2 days.\r\n            In Vienna          15 years,  8 months, 15 days.\r\n            In Berlin          15 years,  7 months,  6 days.\r\n            In Stockholm       15 years,  6 months, 22 days.\r\n            In Manchester      15 years,  6 months,  0 days.\r\n            In Warsaw          15 years,   1 month, 23 days.\r\n            In London, between 15 years,   1 month,  4 days.\r\n                   and         14 years,  9 months,  9 days.\r\n            In Paris, between  15 years,  7 months, 18 days.\r\n                   and         14 years,  5 months, 17 days.\r\n            In Madeira         14 years,  3 months,  0 days.\r\n            In Montpellier     14 years,  2 months,  0 days.\r\n            In Corfu           14 years,  0 months,  0 days.\r\n            In Marseilles      13 years, 11 months, 11 days.\r\n            In Calcutta        12 years,  6 months,  0 days.\r\n            In Egypt           10 years,  0 months,  0 days.\r\n\r\nThe collective results of the investigations of French authors regarding\r\nthe average age at which menstruation first appears are given in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n     I.

The age 14 comes next, with 1,193 instances, or 18.2 per\r\ncent. The case in this series in which menstruation appeared earliest,\r\nnamely in the ninth year, was observed by _Mayer_, the girl being a\r\nblonde of average height, good family, and German descent; the case in\r\nwhich menstruation appeared latest, namely in the twenty-ninth year, was\r\nthat of a woman living in Berlin, who was sickly and chlorotic up to the\r\ntime of her marriage, and in whom menstruation did not appear until some\r\nyears after that event.\r\n\r\nAs regards climatic influences, all the data at our disposal prove that\r\nthe hotter the climate the earlier the menarche. According to _Marc\r\nd’Espine_ the age at puberty varies in an almost geometrical ratio with\r\nthe mean annual temperature.\r\n\r\nThe dependence of the menarche upon climatic influences is clearly shown\r\nby the statistical data collected from various regions of the world. We\r\nappend the general compilation of _Gebhard_ dealing with this question.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               A. EUROPE.\r\n\r\nFor Europe the data furnished by _Ploss_ are grouped by _Gebhard_ in the\r\nfollowing manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         1. _Northern Europe._\r\n\r\nThe average age at which menstruation first appears, according to the\r\nolder statistics, is in Swedish Lapland 18, in Norway, 16.12. In\r\nCopenhagen it is 16.75, in St. Petersburg 14.5.\r\n\r\nMore recent statistics for Finland are furnished by _Engström_. Among\r\n3,500 women of pure Finnish descent, he found that menstruation began:\r\n\r\n                       At the age of:\r\n\r\n                        8 years in   2 instances.\r\n                        9 years in   2 instances.\r\n                       10 years in   4 instances.\r\n                       11 years in  41 instances.\r\n                       12 years in 178 instances.\r\n                       13 years in 458 instances.\r\n                       14 years in 715 instances.\r\n                       15 years in 778 instances.\r\n                       16 years in 614 instances.\r\n                       17 years in 369 instances.\r\n                       18 years in 195 instances.\r\n                       19 years in  91 instances.\r\n                       20 years in  31 instances.\r\n                       21 years in   8 instances.\r\n                       22 years in  10 instances.\r\n                       23 years in   2 instances.\r\n                       24 years in    1 instance.\r\n                       25 years in    0 instance.\r\n                       26 years in    1 instance.\r\n\r\nThus, in nearly half of all Finnish women, menstruation begins with the\r\ncompletion of the fourteenth and fifteenth years. The statistics include\r\nwomen of all classes of society.\r\n\r\nAt the Pirogoff Congress _Grusdeff_ furnished particulars of the first\r\nonset of menstruation in Russia among 10,000 women. Menstruation began:\r\n\r\n                      At the age of:\r\n\r\n                       9 years in     1 instance.\r\n                      10 years in    4 instances.\r\n                      11 years in   31 instances.\r\n                      12 years in  244 instances.\r\n                      13 years in  864 instances.\r\n                      14 years in 1641 instances.\r\n                      15 years in 1795 instances.\r\n                      16 years in 2012 instances.\r\n                      17 years in 1692 instances.\r\n                      18 years in  910 instances.\r\n                      19 years in  498 instances.\r\n                      20 years in  183 instances.\r\n                      21 years in   65 instances.\r\n                      22 years in   19 instances.\r\n                      23 years in    5 instances.\r\n                      24 years in    3 instances.\r\n                      32 years in     1 instance.\r\n\r\nIn women of German race living in Russia puberty was earliest, occurring\r\nat the average age of 15.16 years; in Finnish women it was latest,\r\noccurring at the average age of 16.17 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          2. _Middle Europe._\r\n\r\nIn Germany, according to the tables of _Krieger_ and _L. Mayer_, who\r\nhave recorded 11,500 cases in all, menstruation begins most commonly (in\r\n18.931 per cent. of the cases) at the age of 15; the next most frequent\r\nage is 14 (18.213 per cent. of the cases).\r\n\r\nFor Berlin, in a number of cases collected from the lower classes of\r\nsociety, we find the average age for the first appearance of\r\nmenstruation to be 16.18 years.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the more northerly situation of Berlin, the average age\r\nat puberty is somewhat less than in Munich, situated 4½ degrees to the\r\nsouthward, for the reason that the retardation dependent upon altitude\r\nmakes itself manifest in the latter town, which is situate about 500\r\nmetres (1,640 feet) higher above the sea level. Whereas in Berlin 18 per\r\ncent. of all cases begin to menstruate at the age of 14, and 19 per\r\ncent. at the age of 15, in Munich the two leading years are 15 with a\r\npercentage of 17½, and 16 with a percentage of 18¾.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, according to _Krieger_, the average age at which\r\nmenstruation begins is 15 years, 1 month, and 5 days. For Manchester the\r\nage given is 15 years, 6 months, and 23 days. In France, according to\r\nthe calculation of _Brierre de Boismont_, the most frequent age for the\r\nfirst onset of menstruation is 16. In Paris the average age is 14 years,\r\n6 months, and 14 days. Bohemia, Upper and Lower Austria, and Moravia\r\nhave an average age of 16 years and 2 to 3 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         3. _Southern Europe._\r\n\r\nIn Southern Europe the influence of the higher mean temperature\r\nmanifests itself. The average age at which Spanish girls begin to\r\nmenstruate is 12. In Northern and Middle Italy the most frequent age is\r\n14; in Southern Italy, 13. In Lyons the average age at which\r\nmenstruation begins is 14 years, 5 months, and 29 days; in Marseilles\r\nand Toulon it is 13 years and 10 months. For Hungary, _Doktor_ gives the\r\nstatistics of 9,600 cases. In 22⅓ per cent. menstruation began at the\r\nage of 15; in 20½ per cent. at the age of 16, and in 10 per cent. at the\r\nage of 17. The earliest age among these cases was 8 years; the latest,\r\n33 years. (The latter must no doubt be regarded as pathological.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                B. ASIA.\r\n\r\nIn Palestine puberty most commonly occurs at the age of 13; in Turkey\r\neven as early as 10. _Rouvier_ calculated the average of 742 cases\r\nobserved in Syria to be the age of 12. As regards Persian women, the\r\ndata vary between the age of 14 for the northern part of the country and\r\nthe age of 9 or 10 for the southern. According to _Joubert’s_ data in\r\n46.4 per cent. of the indigens of India, menstruation begins at the age\r\nof 12 or 13. Similar figures are given for Ceylon and for Siam. In Japan\r\nmenstruation most frequently begins at the age of 14, sometimes as early\r\nas 13; mothers of 15 are by no means rarities in this country, but for\r\nmenstruation to begin before the age of 12 is considered a very\r\nexceptional occurrence. According to a table dealing with 584 women of\r\nTokio menstruation began:\r\n\r\n                       At the age of:\r\n\r\n                       11 years in   2 instances.\r\n                       12 years in   2 instances.\r\n                       13 years in  26 instances.\r\n                       14 years in  78 instances.\r\n                       15 years in 224 instances.\r\n                       16 years in 228 instances.\r\n                       17 years in  68 instances.\r\n                       18 years in  44 instances.\r\n                       19 years in  10 instances.\r\n                       20 years in   2 instances.\r\n\r\nThe data available regarding China are so exceedingly variable that\r\nlittle importance can be attached to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    C. AFRICA, OCEANIA, AND AMERICA.\r\n\r\nThe average age at which menstruation begins in the negro women of\r\nAfrica is from 10 to 13. In Algeria puberty occurs at 9 or 10 years.\r\nAmong the Australian indigens, menstruation commonly begins as early as\r\n8 years, and at the very latest at the age of 12 years. The data\r\navailable concerning the indigens of the Oceanic Archipelago are\r\nextremely variable and inexact, but we cannot go far astray in stating\r\nthe age of puberty among these to be from 10 to 13. In tropical South\r\nAmerica girls begin to menstruate from the age of 9 to 14 years. The\r\nIndian women of North America begin to menstruate at the ages of 12, 13,\r\n14, or even as late as 18 or 20. In the Arctic zone of North America and\r\nin Greenland the onset of menstruation is delayed till 17 and even till\r\n23 years.\r\n\r\nAs regards the position in life and the upbringing years it has been\r\nshown by numerous observers that among the well-to-do classes, whose\r\nmode of living is luxurious, and whose social circumstances allow free\r\nplay to the imagination, menstruation begins at an earlier age than\r\namong the working classes, whose life is one of want and privation.\r\nAccording to the statistical data of _Mayer’s_ regarding 6,000 women,\r\nmenstruation began:\r\n\r\n                         _In women of the upper _In women of the lower\r\n                               classes._              classes._\r\n  At the age of 13 years        11.73 per cent.         7.06 per cent.\r\n  At the age of 14 years        23.90 per cent.        13.33 per cent.\r\n  At the age of 15 years        22.83 per cent.        14.56 per cent.\r\n  At the age of 16 years        14.10 per cent.        16.53 per cent.\r\n  At the age of 17 years         9.60 per cent.        13.33 per cent.\r\n\r\nFrom this table we learn that in nearly one-fourth of the girls of the\r\nupper classes puberty occurs at the age of 14, whilst in girls of the\r\nlower classes barely one-sixth begin to menstruate at this age. The\r\naverage age at the first menstruation in girls belonging to the upper\r\nclasses is seen to be 14.69 years, but in girls belonging to the lower\r\nclasses, 16.00 years. According to other observers the average age at\r\nthe first menstruation is:\r\n\r\n                     _Brierre de   _Tilt._   _Krieger._      _Ravn._\r\n                     Boismont._  (_London._) (_Berlin._) (_Copenhagen._)\r\n                     (_Paris._)\r\n Amongst gentle folk 13y. 8m.    13y. 5½m.   14y. 1m.    14y. 3m.\r\n   and the rich\r\n Amongst the         14y. 5m.    14y. 3½m.   15y. 5m.    15y. 5½m.\r\n   well-to-do middle\r\n   classes\r\n Amongst the lower   14y. 10m.               16y. 8m.    16y. 5½m.\r\n   classes\r\n\r\nComparative observations on women living in towns and women living in\r\nthe country show also that in the former, menstruation begins on the\r\naverage at an earlier age. According to _Brierre de Boismont_, the\r\naverage age at the first menstruation is:\r\n\r\n               In Paris             14 years,  6 months.\r\n               In small towns       14 years,  9 months.\r\n               In country districts 14 years, 10 months.\r\n\r\nSimilarly it was found by _Ravn_ that menstruation first occurred:\r\n\r\n        In Copenhagen at the average age of 15 years, 7 months.\r\n        In industrial towns                 15 years, 4 months.\r\n        In country districts                16 years, 5 months.\r\n\r\n_Mayer_ states that the average age at which the first menstruation\r\noccurs is:\r\n\r\n                      In townswomen   15.98 years.\r\n                      In countrywomen 15.20 years.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, according to _Calderini_, in a thousand instances,\r\nmenstruation begins at the age of 14 in 280, at the age of 15 in 219, at\r\nthe age of 13 in 205, at the age of 12 in 116, at the age of 16 in 89,\r\nat the age of 17 in 55, at the age of 18 in 14, at the age of 11 in 7,\r\nat the age of 10 in 6, and at the age of 20 in 6 instances. In girls\r\nattending town schools, the first menstruation most commonly occurs in\r\nthe months of June and August; but in girls attending country schools\r\nmost commonly in the spring months.\r\n\r\nA certain hereditary predisposition is so far determinant in the matter\r\nof the early or late onset of the first menstruation, that from a\r\nknowledge of the age at which menstruation began in the mother, we are\r\nable with great probability to predict the age at which it will begin in\r\nthe daughter. Among fifty cases which I investigated with this point in\r\nview, I found forty-one in which the daughters of mothers who had begun\r\nto menstruate early began themselves to menstruate early, usually indeed\r\nin about the same year of life; or conversely that when the mother had\r\nbegun to menstruate late, late onset of menstruation was usually to be\r\nobserved in the daughter also. _Tilt_ relates a case in which a woman\r\nbegan to menstruate at the age of fourteen, and her daughter and\r\ngranddaughter both began to menstruate at the same age. _Courty_\r\nobserved a mother who began to menstruate at the age of eleven, and\r\nwhose eight daughters all began to menstruate at the same age.\r\n\r\nGynecologists agree in stating that girls of sanguine temperament and\r\npowerful constitution begin to menstruate earlier than weakly and\r\nphlegmatic individuals. _Tilt_ describes a peculiar ovarian temperament,\r\nin which menstruation begins early; such women have as a rule striking\r\nnervous sensibilities, with a dark complexion and glistening, longing\r\neyes, always surrounded by dark rings.\r\n\r\nThe opinion is general that in girls with black hair, dark eyes, thick\r\nskin, and dark complexion, menstruation begins earlier than in blondes\r\nwith blue eyes and delicate white skin. _Brierre de Boismont_ states in\r\nthis connection that not fair hair only, but also chestnut-tinted locks,\r\nindicate a late onset of menstruation. _L. Mayer_ found that:\r\n\r\n   _Of blondes._  _Of brunettes._\r\n\r\n  17.20 per cent. 18.84 per cent. began to menstruate at the age of 14\r\n  16.89 per cent. 18.02 per cent. began to menstruate at the age of 15\r\n  15.14 per cent. 16.59 per cent. began to menstruate at the age of 16\r\n\r\nAccording to the same author, the average age at which menstruation\r\nbegins is:\r\n\r\n                       In blondes   15.55 years.\r\n                       In brunettes 15.26 years.\r\n\r\nAs regards race, it is well known that in Jewesses menstruation begins\r\nat an early age. According to _Joachim_ the age of puberty varies very\r\ngreatly among the different races inhabiting Hungary. The first\r\nmenstruation appears:\r\n\r\n            In Slavonic girls between the ages of 16 and 17\r\n            In Magyar                             15 and 16\r\n            In Jewish                             14 and 15\r\n            In Styrian                            13 and 14\r\n\r\n\r\n                   FIRST APPEARANCE OF MENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of menstruation is commonly preceded by various\r\nsymptoms dependent on the increased flow of blood to the genital organs.\r\nSuch symptoms are: Sacrache; dragging sensation in the loins; an\r\nindefinite feeling of pressure in the lower part of the belly,\r\nespecially in the region of the uterus and the ovaries, which region is\r\nsometimes also tender on pressure; a slight feeling of weariness in the\r\nlower extremities; sudden flushings or pallors; alternating sensations\r\nof heat and chilliness, sometimes accompanied by actual though slight\r\nchange of temperature. In many cases also there are disturbances in the\r\nintestinal evacuations and urinary secretion, in the process of\r\ncutaneous transpiration, and in the functional activity of the\r\ngastro-intestinal canal. A frequently observed symptom is an increased\r\nirritability of the entire nervous system, with an inclination to\r\nmelancholy and indefinite amorous desires—symptoms which _Tilt_ denotes\r\nby the term “ovarianismus,” _Emmet_ by the term “erection,” _Lecal_ by\r\nthe term “phlogose amoureuse,” and the older writers by the term\r\n“molimina menstrualia.”\r\n\r\nThe nervous irritability manifests itself already before the appearance\r\nof the menstrual flow by headache and moodiness, weariness, nervous\r\nirritability, and low spirits; further, by slight changes in the facial\r\naspect, dark rings round the eyes, spontaneous blushing, uneasy\r\nsensations, epigastric pain, loss of appetite, a sensation of pressure\r\nin the abdomen, palpitation, vertigo, dragging sensations passing from\r\nthe loins to the thighs, feeling of weakness and numbness in the lower\r\nextremities—symptoms which often endure for several months and in such\r\ncases tend to lower the resisting powers of the organism.\r\n\r\n_Courty_ enumerates as prodromal symptoms which are observed in the\r\nmajority of girls before the first appearance of menstruation: swelling\r\nand tenderness of the breasts, sensation of fulness and weight in the\r\nhypogastric region, moderate intestinal meteorism, sacrache,\r\naqueo-mucous vaginal discharge, finally, an itching sensation in the\r\ngenital organs. These manifestations may also assume a morbid character,\r\ntaking the form of violent abdominal and lumbo-sacral pain, general\r\nfatigue and weakness, dyspepsia and diarrhœa, cephalalgia, various kinds\r\nof neuralgia, some degree of moral aberration. After the first\r\nmenstruation, two or three months may elapse before the girl menstruates\r\nagain, but after the lapse of a year the flow usually recurs at quite\r\nregular periods. Sometimes the early periods are very violent and recur\r\nvery frequently, every twenty days, for instance.\r\n\r\nThe greatest increase in size and weight occurs in the female sex at the\r\ntime of the menarche. Amongst the poorer classes the greatest\r\ndevelopment in size and strength occurs between the ages of 13 and 15\r\nyears, whereas in the upper classes of society, those who ultimately\r\nattain the same weight exhibit their greatest growth at the ages of 12,\r\n13, and 14 years. According to _Pagliani_ the greatest growth in the\r\nfemale sex always precedes puberty, so that for example a girl who\r\nbegins to menstruate at the age of 12 will grow most rapidly in the year\r\npreceding this, whereas a girl who begins to menstruate at a more\r\nadvanced age will not undergo her most rapid phase of growth so early as\r\nthe age of 11. According to the observations of _Bowditch_, _A. Hey_,\r\n_Lombroso_, _Pagliani_, and _Ploss_, up to the age of 11 or 12 years the\r\ngrowth of girls exceeds that of boys, but whereas in girls growth ceases\r\nsuddenly at the age of 14, in boys growth proceeds regularly up to the\r\nage of 16 years. At birth boys are on the average 1 cm. (⅖″) longer than\r\ngirls; but during puberty the female sex catches up the male in height,\r\nor even surpasses it. According to _Ploss_, a girl of 16 or 17 years is\r\nas tall as a young man of 18 or 19 years.\r\n\r\nThe earlier development of the female as compared with the male at the\r\ntime of puberty is a constant phenomenon, to be observed in all races,\r\nin every climate, and in all strata of society. According to the\r\nstatistical data published by the authors just quoted, the age of\r\ngreatest development in the respective sexes is:\r\n\r\n                                               _In the female._ _In the male._\r\n\r\n As regards weight at the age of                12 to 14 years. 14 to 17 years.\r\n As regards height at the age of                12 to 13 years. 12 to 15 years.\r\n As regards respiratory capacity at the age of  12 to 15 years. 15 to 17 years.\r\n As regards muscular strength at the age of     12 to 14 years. 14 to 15 years.\r\n\r\nPuberty occurs in the female on the average about two years earlier than\r\nin the male, and upon this difference the observed differences in growth\r\nalso depend.\r\n\r\nThe menarche in the wider signification of the term includes the\r\ndevelopment which occurs at the time of puberty, and continues through a\r\nperiod of several months, and even years, before complete sexual\r\nmaturity is attained; and includes also the time, which may be\r\nconsiderable, following the first appearance of the menses and before\r\nthe regular rhythm of the menstrual function is established and the full\r\ndevelopment of the female genital organs is attained. This time, which\r\nforms a notable phase of the sexual life of woman, is characterized by\r\ngreat changes in the genital organs and in the vital processes connected\r\ntherewith, by a strong tendency to suffer from a series of very various\r\npathological changes and disorders of function in the principal organs,\r\nand a lessened general resisting power to disease—a change which finds\r\nits most definite expression in the well-established fact that in this\r\nperiod of life the mortality among females is much greater than among\r\nmales of corresponding age. According to the statistical data of\r\n_Quetelet_ and _Smits_, from the age of 14 to the age of 18 (the period\r\nof the menarche) there are 128 deaths of females for every 100 deaths of\r\nmales; and even in the four succeeding years, from the age of 18 to the\r\nage of 22, the unfavorable conditions peculiar to sex are witnessed by\r\n105 deaths of females to every 100 deaths of males.\r\n\r\nMany authors draw a distinction between the age of puberty (from the\r\nLatin _pubes_, _puberis_), when the growth of the pubic hair occurs as\r\nan external sign of sexual development, and the age of nubility (from\r\nthe Latin _nubere_), when the individual becomes fitted for marriage.\r\nThe distinction is a partial one only, inasmuch as capacity for\r\ncopulation is attained already at puberty. The law, however, maintains\r\nsuch a distinction, the Austrian Penal Code, for example, regarding\r\nintercourse with a female less than fourteen years old as rape, and the\r\nGerman Code likewise punishing carnal knowledge of a girl under\r\nfourteen.\r\n\r\nThe signs of puberty in girls were noticed and explained in very early\r\ntimes. From the anthropological studies of _Ploss_ and _Bartels_ we take\r\nthe following data regarding this matter. In the Bible we read (Ezekiel,\r\nxvi, 7): “Thy breasts are fashioned and thine hair is grown, whereas\r\nthou wast naked and bare.” The early Indian physician, _Susruta_, refers\r\nonly to the regular recurrence of menstruation as a sign of puberty.\r\nThat a woman is menstruating may be known by the fact that her face is\r\nswollen and bright. In the Roman Empire _Justinian_ ordained that all\r\nyoung women should be examined as to the growth or absence of the pubic\r\nhair in order to ascertain if they were ripe for marriage. The early\r\nChinese physicians recorded that in every woman at the age of fourteen\r\nor fifteen years a monthly flow of blood from the genital organs began,\r\nthe period of recurrence being thirty days. The physicians of the Talmud\r\nexpress themselves variously regarding puberty in women. In one place\r\nthey advance as a sign of puberty the growth of the hair on the genital\r\norgans; in another they speak of the notable enlargement of the breasts,\r\nand mention as a sign of more complete sexual development that the\r\nnipples become elastic. Other Talmudists refer to the appearance of a\r\ndark brown coloration in the areola and to the enlargement of the mons\r\nVeneris as signs of puberty. Savage races regard the first appearance of\r\nthe menstrual flow as the only certain sign of puberty, and among many\r\nsuch races this is the occasion of peculiar ceremonial rites. The\r\nattainment of puberty in savage tribes is often solemnized by the\r\nseclusion of the girls from the time of the first menstruation; they\r\nfast during the period of seclusion, which sometimes terminates in an\r\nelaborate ritual of purification.\r\n\r\nFor two reasons in particular, the period of the menarche is a time of\r\nstorm and stress to women, first on account of the developmental\r\nprocesses in the genital organs, and secondly on account of the\r\nintellectual changes that occur at this period.\r\n\r\nThe local cause is to be found in the extensive transformation of the\r\novaries and the uterus, by means of which a peculiar and powerful\r\nstimulus, the menstrual stimulus, is elaborated, which has a reflex\r\ninfluence upon heart and brain, vascular and nervous systems, and\r\nsecretory and nutritive processes. Since we know that in every\r\npremenstrual period by the growth of the follicles hyperæmia is excited\r\nin the ovary, by means of which the liquor folliculi is increased in\r\namount, we can well understand that at the time of the menarche the\r\nripening of the graafian follicles is accompanied by a considerable\r\ndegree of hyperæmia of the ovaries and of the whole of the genital\r\norgans, now undergoing their fullest development, and we can easily see\r\nhow this hyperæmia may result in manifold reflex disturbances. But in\r\naddition to these reflex disturbances, we have once more to take into\r\nconsideration the as yet imperfectly known chemical processes which are\r\nassociated with the ripening and development of the graafian follicles,\r\nand an abnormal course of which may give rise to a disordered\r\nconstitution of the blood, manifesting itself as chlorosis or in other\r\nways. In connection with the growth and ripening of the ova, extensive\r\nand novel demands are made on the organism, and these may well endanger\r\nmetabolic processes which are not established on a very secure\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nThe other cause is to be found in the intellectual processes which occur\r\nat this time in the youthfully receptive, highly sensitive organ of\r\nmind, the brain. The girl growing into womanhood, who with astonishment\r\nand stress has witnessed the visible changes in her body, the outward\r\nsigns of puberty, as they gradually make their appearance, receives\r\npowerful psychical stimulation which cannot fail to exercise an\r\ninfluence upon the entire nervous system and its complex interlacements,\r\nalike in the sensory and in the motor sphere.\r\n\r\nThe degree to which these influences radiating from the genital organs\r\nmake themselves manifest is chiefly dependent upon the resisting power\r\nof the nervous system as a whole, upon the temperament, the inherited\r\nconstitution, and the mode of education of the young girl. In children\r\nbelonging to families noted for sensibility and irritability, in\r\ndwellers in large cities who have attended high schools for girls and\r\nhave at an early age lifted the veil that covers the sexual processes,\r\nthe reflex disturbances of the menarche will be more manifold and will\r\nmanifest themselves with greater intensity than in children brought up\r\nin country districts, whose sensibilities are chiefly physical and whose\r\nmind is less susceptible to the influence of external stimuli.\r\n\r\nA further important consideration is the time at which the menarche\r\noccurs, and whether on the one hand it is at or near the average age, or\r\nwhether on the other, as precocious menstruation, it is unusually early,\r\nanticipating the general bodily development, or again as retarded\r\nmenstruation it is unduly delayed. In some cases of retarded\r\nmenstruation, the external genital organs are thoroughly well developed,\r\nand it is menstruation only that remains in abeyance; but in other cases\r\nthe external genitals are also backward in development, the pubes and\r\nmons Veneris being but sparsely supplied with hair, and the breasts\r\nremaining very small.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these abnormal temporal relations of the menarche,\r\ncertain other irregularities at the commencement of menstruation are\r\nworthy of note. Thus, the first menstruation may be normal, but\r\nthereafter amenorrhœa may persist for several months, or if the flow\r\noccurs it may be exceedingly scanty, or very pale in color; on the other\r\nhand, menstruation may be very profuse, lasting many days.\r\n\r\nThe environment in which the young girl is placed during the period of\r\nher sexual development has a great influence on the processes of the\r\nsexual life and on the pathological disturbances that affect these\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nIn working-class families the immoderate physical strain often thrown\r\nupon girls, in many cases continuous movements of the upper extremities\r\nwhilst the lower extremities and the pelvis are absolutely quiescent, or\r\nconversely, an excessive employment of the muscles of the lower\r\nextremities—these circumstances in conjunction with insufficient\r\nnutriment, night-work, association when at work with persons of the\r\nopposite sex, and the frequent premature sexual stimulation, will\r\ncombine to have a most deleterious effect.\r\n\r\nAmongst country-folk, indeed, the girl has the enjoyment of fresh air,\r\nand as a rule nutritive food, moreover, there are not so many occasions\r\nof nervous stimulation; puberty therefore arrives more slowly and gives\r\nrise to less disturbance; but the ignorance of the girls very frequently\r\nleads to an early experience of coition, the natural and unnatural\r\nconsequences of which have then to be taken into account.\r\n\r\nAmongst the better classes of townspeople such hygienic regulations and\r\neducational measures are in common employment that young girls during\r\nthe years of development usually receive reasonable care and\r\nattention—but very frequently, intercourse with older girls, association\r\nwith young men, visits to theatres, evening-parties, and balls, and the\r\nperusal of stimulating literature, form unfavorable features of urban\r\nlife which exercise their inevitable effects in the sexual sphere. In\r\nsome cases, fortunately sufficiently rare, the stimulation of the sexual\r\nimpulse and the longing for its satisfaction are so intense, that a kind\r\nof _demi-vierge_ is brought into being, a young woman who is concerned\r\nonly to preserve the physical token of virginity, but whose thoughts and\r\nfancies are anything but maidenly. It is to be feared that in\r\nconsequence of the excessive freedom in education and the emancipated\r\nindependence of feminine youth, these “half-virgins” are increasing both\r\nin number and in intensity, a fact which cannot fail to increase also\r\nthe number of sexual maladies and perversions.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Anatomical Changes in the Female Genital Organs in the Period of the\r\n                               Menarche._\r\n\r\nThe female reproductive organs, which in childhood were in a\r\ncomparatively quiescent state, now become powerfully active, as is\r\nwitnessed by the changes that occur in the external genitals.\r\n\r\nThe soft, hairless vulva of the child becomes enlarged at the time of\r\nthe menarche by the deposit of fat, and its substance becomes tough and\r\nelastic. Some time before puberty, fine, pale hairs make their\r\nappearance here and there, but not until puberty does the hairy covering\r\nof the pubic region become more or less thick. The growth of the denser\r\npubic hair begins with the appearance of hairs along the middle of the\r\nmons Veneris and at the margins of the labia majora. Early sexual\r\ndevelopment is commonly indicated by an early and thick growth of the\r\npubic hair. In the virgin this hair is smoother and less curly than in\r\nthe later course of the sexual life. In certain tribes of negroes it is\r\nthe custom for the young unmarried girls to shave off the pubic hair,\r\nwhich is not allowed to grow freely until after marriage. In some of the\r\ntribes of South Sea Islanders it is customary at puberty to tattoo the\r\nexternal genitals and the surrounding skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 8.—Internal genital organs of a new-born, powerfully developed\r\n    female infant. (From Toldt: Atlas of Human Anatomy.—Rebman Company,\r\n    New York.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn young virgins the rima urogenitalis or vulval cleft is closed by the\r\naccurate opposition of the labia majora; the labia minora or nymphæ are\r\ndelicate in texture, rose-red in color, hairless, free from fat, and\r\ncompletely covered by the labia majora; whilst the clitoris is likewise\r\nconcealed. The sebaceous glands of the labia minora secrete a smegma\r\nwhich collects especially around the glans clitoridis, and as it\r\nundergoes decomposition diffuses a peculiar odor, resembling that of old\r\ncheese. A wing-like elongation of the labia minora in young girls, with\r\nfree secretion and a generally moist appearance, leads to a suspicion of\r\nthe practice of masturbation. In the virgin the orifice of the vagina is\r\ncovered by the hymen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 9.—Reproductive organs of a new-born, powerfully developed female\r\n    infant in median sagittal section.

Owing to the small size of the body (_corpus uteri_), the\r\nwhole uterus is very flat, and its borders ascend in a direction almost\r\nparallel to each other, diverging somewhat abruptly into the Fallopian\r\ntubes, recalling in some degree the two-horned embryonic form of the\r\norgan (_uterus bicornis_). The plicæ palmatæ on the surface of the\r\ncervical canal, which make up the arbor vitæ uterina, are strongly\r\ndeveloped; the median longitudinal ridge bifurcates, and its divisions\r\ncan be traced on either side into the uterine orifice of the Fallopian\r\ntube (_ostium uterinum tubæ_). The lips of the vaginal portion of the\r\ncervix are comparatively speaking very large and terminate in sharp\r\nangles. The vaginal mucous membrane is everywhere beset with long\r\npapillæ. The development of the uterus shortly before puberty consists\r\nchiefly in the enlargement of the body of the uterus, and the growth of\r\nits walls in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 14.—Sagittal section of the female pelvis (after Breiolei).\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt the time of puberty, according to _Toldt_, the body of the uterus in\r\nthe virgin has already increased till its length is half that of the\r\nentire organ; and at the first appearance of menstruation the body and\r\nneck of the virgin uterus are nearly equal, with perhaps a slight\r\npreponderance in size of the cervix, and the walls of the uterus have\r\nbecome convex. In consequence of this change the organ becomes\r\npear-shaped, and the uterine cavity (_cavum uteri_) assumes the form of\r\na triangle with moderately incurved sides. The cervical canal becomes\r\nwider in the middle; the margin of the os uteri becomes smooth and\r\nrounded. The walls of the virgin vagina are marked with numerous dentate\r\ntransverse ridges (_rugæ_), especially near the lower end and on the\r\nanterior walls, the columns of the vagina (_columnæ rugarum_), from\r\nwhich the transverse ridges run to either side at right angles, extend\r\nhalf way up the vagina, and are of a hard consistence.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic changes in the ovary at the time of the menarche\r\noriginate in the changes undergone by the ovarian follicles. A large\r\nnumber of small separate follicles is to be found already in the ovary\r\nof the new-born infant. These structures, known as primitive follicles,\r\nare formed by detachment from the egg-tubes that grow down into the\r\nstroma from the superficial germinal epithelium; they are spheroidal\r\nvesicles, enveloped by a single layer of cubical cells, and their\r\ninterior is entirely filled by the primitive ovum or egg-cell. This\r\nlatter consists of very finely granulated protoplasm with spherical\r\nnucleus and distinct nucleolus, but no trace of an investing membrane\r\ncan as yet be discerned. The further development of the ovarian\r\nfollicles takes according to _Toldt_ the following course: A rapid\r\nmultiplication of the cubical cells that form the wall of the follicle\r\noccurs, so that the ovum is surrounded by two, three, or several layers\r\nof cubical or rounded cells, and the whole follicle gradually increases\r\nin size. At the same time the ovum assumes an eccentric position in the\r\ninterior of the follicle. At or near the middle of the follicle a\r\nslit-shaped space now appears, filled with a clear colorless fluid. As\r\nthis space gradually enlarges, the follicle[19] becomes converted into a\r\nvesicle filled with fluid, the wall of which is composed of small\r\ncubical cells. Simultaneously with the growth of the follicle a\r\nlamination of the elements of the surrounding stroma takes place, so\r\nthat a somewhat sharply defined capsule is formed. In this condition\r\nthese glandular structures of the ovary are known as graafian\r\nfollicles.[19]\r\n\r\nBefore puberty, these graafian follicles are small vesicles of a\r\ndiameter of one to two millimetres, containing the large unicellular\r\nova. Each of these consists of an envelope, the zona pellucida (also\r\nknown as the zona radiata, or striated membrane of the ovum); an\r\nexternal granular mass of protoplasm, the vitellus or yolk; a vesicular,\r\nspherical nucleus, the germinal vesicle; and a nucleolus, which if\r\nsingle is large and prominent, the macula germinativa or germinal spot.\r\nAs early as the second year of infancy every imaginable intermediate\r\nstage between the primitive follicle and the fully-developed vesicular\r\ngraafian follicle can be observed.\r\n\r\nAt the time of puberty certain larger follicles are always to be\r\ndistinguished, which have moved inward toward the interior layers of the\r\novary, whereas the smaller follicles have a more peripheral situation;\r\nthus, according to _Waldeyer_, we observe at this time in a section of\r\nthe ovary, proceeding from without inward, first the epithelium, next\r\nthe fibrous tunic, next the zone of younger follicles, and finally the\r\nzone of older follicles. According to _Henle_ and _Waldeyer_, at the\r\ncommencement of puberty, there are in each ovary about 36,000 ova,\r\ngiving a total for the two of 72,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 15.—Primitive follicles.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the further course of development of the graafian follicles at this\r\nperiod, the most advanced now reapproach the surface of the ovary, so\r\nthat a fully-matured follicle comes to occupy almost the entire\r\nthickness of the cortical substance, and may even give rise to a\r\nlocalized bulging of the surface of the organ. In such a mature\r\nfollicle, which has attained nearly the size of a pea, we recognize an\r\noutermost connective-tissue investment (_theca folliculi_), consisting\r\nof condensed ovarian stroma, in which two layers are distinguished,\r\nsometimes called simply _outer tunic_ and _inner tunic_, sometimes known\r\nby the names of _tunica fibrosa_ (outer) and _tunica propria_ (inner),\r\nrespectively; within this is the cellular layer known as the _membrana\r\ngranulosa_ (or _stratum granulosum_), the portion of which, now greatly\r\nenlarged, immediately surrounding the ovum is known as the _discus\r\nproligerus_ (or _cumulus oöphorus_); the interspace between the _discus\r\nproligerus_ and the membrana granulosa is filled with a clear fluid, the\r\n_liquor folliculi_. In consequence of the continued increase in its\r\nfluid contents, the graafian follicle ultimately bursts along the most\r\nprominent portion of the superficial wall, and the ovum passes out\r\nthrough the rupture, finding its way under normal conditions into the\r\nFallopian tube and through this into the uterus. The follicle itself\r\nthen undergoes a regressive metamorphosis, forming the _corpus luteum_,\r\nthe rent in the envelope of which, after the absorption of the yellowish\r\nsemi-fluid contents, undergoes cicatrization. Contemporaneously with\r\nthis development at puberty of the process of ovulation, menstruation\r\nalso for the first time makes its appearance, recurring thenceforward at\r\nfour-weekly intervals as the regular catamenial discharge.\r\n\r\nWe append the account given by _Pfannenstiel_ regarding the ovarian\r\nfollicles. He writes: “In correspondence with the especial function of\r\nthe female reproductive gland, which is to bring to maturity and to\r\nevacuate only after the lapse of a considerable period and at successive\r\nintervals, the ova which it has contained from the very outset, we find\r\nthat primitive follicles continue to exist in the ovary up to the very\r\nend of the period of sexual activity, though naturally in diminishing\r\nnumbers; and the size and shape of these primitive follicles remain\r\nnearly identical throughout the various periods of life. As the follicle\r\nripens, the epithelium grows, the cells becoming cubical with a rounded\r\nnucleus, and increasing in number by cell-division, so that several\r\nlayers are formed. As soon as these layers are three or four in number,\r\na space, at first slit-shaped, forms in the epithelium on the peripheral\r\nsurface of the ovum; this space is filled with fluid, known as the\r\nliquor folliculi; the peripheral layer of cells, the membrana granulosa,\r\nis thus separated from the mass of epithelial cells immediately\r\nenveloping the ovum, the discus proligerus, which is situate in the side\r\nof the follicle adjacent to the hilum of the ovary. By the increase of\r\nthe liquor folliculi the graafian follicle is formed, a vesicle the\r\nenvelope of which is formed by the multilaminar membrana granulosa,\r\nwhilst in the pole of the vesicle directed toward the hilum ovarii is\r\nthe ovum imbedded in the mass of cells forming the discus proligerus, a\r\nmass which has the form of a truncated cone. The liquor folliculi is\r\nformed by the epithelium, the nuclei of which disappear by chromatolysis\r\nor by simple atrophy whilst the cell-bodies liquefy in consequence of\r\nalbuminous, not fatty, degeneration (_Schottländer_). Within the\r\nepithelium of the follicle we find the faintly glistening epithelial\r\nvacuoles of _Fleming_, likewise cells which liquefy and assist in\r\nincreasing the bulk of the liquor folliculi. This liquor is a thin,\r\nserous fluid, and contains albumin. * * * Every graafian follicle has a\r\nbilaminar investing membrane, which is formed by the ovarian\r\nstroma. * * * The ovum of the growing follicle increases in size very\r\nslowly indeed, attaining on the average, according to _Nagel_, a\r\ndiameter of 165 to 170 µ, it retains its zona pellucida, the greater\r\npart of the protoplasm of the cell is transformed into deutoplasm\r\n(food-yolk, or yolk-granules), the nucleus assumes an eccentric\r\nposition. Between the zona pellucida and the cell-body a narrow\r\nperivitelline space appears. The ovum is then full-grown, but not yet\r\nfully prepared for fertilization; for this, maturation is required,\r\ncertain changes in the germinal vesicle, which occur after the bursting\r\nof the follicle. * * * As a rule each follicle contains a single ovum.\r\nBut two and even three ova have beyond doubt been observed in one\r\nfollicle.”\r\n\r\nAccording to _Waldeyer_, the bursting of the follicle is not to be\r\nregarded as dependent upon a sudden rise of pressure in its interior,\r\nbut as the result of a gradual ripening process. At the deepest pole of\r\nthe follicle, which in the course of its development has now approached\r\nthe surface of the ovary, an exuberant growth takes place in the\r\ninternal layer (tunica propria) of the theca folliculi, with a profuse\r\nformation of new vessels. Here numerous “epithelioid” cells, the\r\n“lutein-cells,” make their appearance. In consequence of this\r\nproliferation of the lutein-cells, the contents of the follicle are\r\ngradually pressed toward the “stigma,” the superficial pole of the\r\nfollicle, and the follicle itself is pushed toward the surface until it\r\nfinally comes into contact with the germinal epithelium. Meanwhile the\r\nfollicular epithelium undergoes fatty degeneration, alike in the\r\nmembrana granulosa and in the discus proligerus. In consequence of the\r\nproliferation of the lutein-cells, on the one hand, and the fatty\r\ndegeneration of the epithelium, on the other, the follicle opens at its\r\nweakest point, the stigma, and the ovum is extruded, with the liquor\r\nfolliculi, and a number of cells belonging to the follicular epithelium.\r\n(To illustrate these changes we have borrowed FIGS. 15, 16, and 17 from\r\nthe monograph, by _Pfannenstiel_ on _Diseases of the Ovary_, in _J.\r\nVeits’ Handbook of Gynecology_.)\r\n\r\nThe ovaries, which in the new-born female infant are flattened,\r\nribbon-like bodies one-half to one centimeter (0.2 to 0.4″) in length,\r\nand in childhood are cylindrical, with a perfectly smooth surface,\r\nassume at the time of puberty a more or less flattened form. During the\r\nmenarche they have an elongated oval shape, flattened from side to side,\r\ntheir average length being 2.5 to 5.0 centimetres (1 to 2″), width 1.5\r\nto 3.0 centimetres (0.59 to 1.18″), thickness 0.6 to 1.4 centimetres\r\n(0.24 to 0.55″), weight 5 to 8 grammes (77 to 123 grains). After the\r\nrepeated occurrence of ovulation, the surface of the ovary becomes more\r\nand more uneven, being thickly covered with fossæ or scar-like fissures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 16.—Ripening follicles.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe vagina during virgin girlhood is narrow, and its mucous surface is\r\nbeset with numerous rugæ, which may be plainly felt as well as seen. The\r\ncalibre of the vagina is proportionately less the younger the girl. The\r\nexamining finger is gripped by the vaginal wall as by an india-rubber\r\ntube (_Maschka_). The vaginal portion of the cervix is felt in the form\r\nof a truncated cone, with a smooth surface, rather dense in consistence;\r\nthe external os opens at the bottom of a small depression on its\r\nsurface, in the form of a short oval, the long axis of which is\r\ntransversely directed. Shortly before the menarche, Bartholin’s glands\r\nbecome noticeable on either side of the lower end of the vagina between\r\nthe sphincter muscles.\r\n\r\nThe clitoris in many cases attains a very large size, and this is apt to\r\nlead to sexual malpractices. According to _Hyrtl_, in southern countries\r\nthe clitoris is larger than in temperate and cold climates. In the women\r\nof Abyssinia and among the Mandingoes and the Ibboes, the size is\r\nportentous, and amongst the first-named, circumcision of females is a\r\ncustomary operation. It is said that female slaves belonging to these\r\nraces are greatly esteemed by the ladies of the harem, and are eagerly\r\nsought for. In the anatomicopathological museum at Prague there is a\r\npreparation of the female genital organs with a clitoris as large as the\r\npenis of a full-grown man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 17.—Graafian follicles.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Sonini_ describes “as peculiar to women of Egyptian or Koptic descent,\r\nthe presence of a thick, fleshy, but soft and pendent outgrowth in the\r\npubic region, completely covered with hair,” which he compares to the\r\nhanging caruncle on the bill of the male turkey. This appendage becomes\r\nthicker and longer with advancing years. Sonini found such an appendage\r\none-half inch in length in a girl of eight years, one of more than four\r\ninches in a woman of twenty to twenty-five years. Circumcision in girls\r\nconsists in the removal of this outgrowth, which hinders copulation; in\r\nthat part of the world the operation is usually effected in the seventh\r\nor eighth year, just before puberty.\r\n\r\nThe circumcision of girls as practiced by Mahommedan peoples in Africa\r\nis said by _Ploss_ and _Bartels_ to consist in abscission of the labia\r\nminora, the clitoris, and the præputium clitoridis. _Brehm_ is of\r\nopinion that the object of the operation is to diminish the intensity of\r\nthe sexual impulse, so overpowering among these races; but others\r\nbelieve that the great enlargement of the clitoris and the labia minora\r\nusual in those countries is regarded as a serious defect in beauty, a\r\ndefect removed by the operation; whilst others again hold that the\r\ncircumcision is required for the removal of the hindrance to copulation\r\npresented by the abnormally large clitoris. Closely related to the\r\noperation of circumcision in females, according to _Ploss_ and\r\n_Bartels_, is the custom peculiar to Africa of infibulation, wherein,\r\nafter a preliminary cutting operation like that for circumcision, the\r\nfresh wound surfaces are brought into accurate opposition, either by\r\nsutures or by appropriate bandages, so that when cicatrization occurs\r\nthe vulval cleft is closed except for a very small aperture. The object\r\nof infibulation is to enforce on girls complete abstinence from sexual\r\nintercourse. (Before marriage, the vulval cleft is reopened to an extent\r\ncorresponding with the size of the genital organs of the future husband;\r\nand when pregnancy occurs, the opening is still further enlarged before\r\nparturition; but after that event, the wound surfaces are refreshed, and\r\nthe whole opening is once more closed). On the other hand, in many\r\nsavage tribes, elongation of the labia minora and the clitoris is\r\nartificially undertaken from the earliest years of girlhood, this\r\nelongation being regarded as a beauty.\r\n\r\nThe parts of the external reproductive organs of the female concerned in\r\nsexual sensation, first described as such by _Kobelt_, are already fully\r\ndeveloped at the time of the menarche. Of these parts a small portion\r\nonly, the glans clitoridis, is visible externally, surrounded by the\r\npræputium clitoridis, a prolongation of the labia minora, which passes\r\nround the front of the clitoris, and sends from each side a fine process\r\nbehind the glans to become attached to its under surface, forming the\r\nfrænum of the clitoris. The erectile apparatus of the external genitals\r\nis formed by the corpora cavernosa clitoridis. As two delicately\r\nconstructed trabecular masses of erectile tissue, the crura of the\r\nclitoris, these are attached on either side to the inferior or\r\ndescending rami of the pubic bones; at first passing upwards parallel to\r\nthe bones, they subsequently curve downward as they converge and unite\r\nto form the body of the clitoris; these masses of erectile tissue\r\nembrace the sides and the front of the lower extremity of the vagina.\r\nThis erectile apparatus, when the supply of arterial blood is greatly\r\naccelerated and at the same time the outflow of venous blood is\r\ndiminished, becomes distended with blood, enlarged and stiffened; the\r\nprocess of erection plays an important part, as we shall explain more\r\nfully later, in the production of sexual excitement and sexual pleasure\r\nduring the act of copulation.\r\n\r\nIn the virgin and in the earlier phases of the sexual life, the hymen is\r\nso characteristic an organ that its more minute description would seem\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nThe hymen, a fold of mucous membrane, springing from the periphery of\r\nthe vaginal orifice, separates as a perforated diaphragm the vagina from\r\nthe vulva. Between the two epithelial layers of which, as a fold of\r\nmucous membrane, the hymen consists, is a supporting layer of connective\r\ntissue of variable strength; in other respects the mucous membrane of\r\nthe hymen has the same structure as the mucous membrane of the vagina.\r\nOn its inner surface the rugæ and folds of the vaginal mucous membrane\r\nare prolonged. The shape of the hymen is very variable; most commonly\r\nits aperture is more or less central, so that the hymen has a ringed or\r\nsemilunar shape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 18.—Annular Hymen.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 19.—Annular Hymen.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the new-born female infant, the hymen has the appearance of a tubular\r\nstopper closing the lower end of the vagina; according to _Dohrn_ it\r\nexhibits as a rule one of three typical forms: _Hymen annularis_,\r\n_denticulatus_, _et linguiformis_; the _annular_, the _denticulate_, and\r\nthe _linguiform_ (or _linguliform_) _hymen_. The transverse ridges on\r\nthe inner surface of the hymen, prolongations of the rugose columns of\r\nthe vagina, are strongly developed. During the girl’s further growth, in\r\nassociation with the enlargement of the vagina, the hymen undergoes\r\nimportant changes in form and structure. Its border becomes thinner and\r\nmore tense; and in the virgin at the time of the menarche, the annular\r\nhymen is the fundamental type, subject, however, to extensive\r\nvariations. In most cases, at any rate, the aperture in the hymen is\r\nmore or less centrally situated; very commonly, however, this opening is\r\ncrescentic, when we have a semilunar hymen, the height of the border\r\nposteriorly being much greater than anteriorly. The consistency of the\r\nhymen, its extensibility, and its thickness, are as variable as its\r\nshape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 20.—Semilunar Hymen.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 21.—Annular Hymen with congenital Symmetrical Indentations.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 22.—Fimbriate Hymen.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 23.—Deflorated Fimbriate Hymen.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the normal position of the reproductive organs the hymen has very\r\nrarely the appearance of a tense membrane; as a rule it is folded up,\r\nand becomes plainly manifest only when the genital organs are stretched.\r\nThe margin of the hymeneal aperture, as a close examination shows, is\r\nsometimes sharp and regular, sometimes lobulated, with small congenital\r\nnotches. These congenital notches are to be distinguished from the\r\nlacerations resulting from defloration by the fact that the former have\r\na smooth border, which is of the same consistency as the general\r\nsubstance of the hymen. In some instances the border of the aperture in\r\nthe hymen is beset with small, fine villi (villous hymen).\r\n\r\nThe common varieties of the hymen are thus classified by _Maschka_:\r\n\r\n1. The _annular hymen_, in which the membrane when stretched is seen to\r\nhave a rounded aperture, which may be central or eccentric; very often,\r\nindeed, the aperture is more toward the upper half of the hymen, in\r\nwhich case it is not always circular, but frequently rather ovoid in\r\nshape.\r\n\r\n2. The _semilunar_ or _crescentic hymen_, in which the aperture is\r\neccentrically placed in the upper half of the membrane, in such a manner\r\nthat the hymen exhibits a wide surface below the aperture, which surface\r\nnarrows at either side as it passes upwards until it disappears, the two\r\nsides failing to reunite above the aperture.\r\n\r\n3. The _heart-shaped_ or _cordiform hymen_, the general shape of which\r\nmay be circular, ovoid, or even semilunar, but in which from the middle\r\nof the upper or lower margin a three-cornered tongue projects across the\r\naperture, which is thus given the form of the conventional heart of a\r\npack of cards.\r\n\r\n4. _The infundibuliform hymen_ has the form of a small projecting funnel\r\nresembling in appearance the invaginated end of the finger of a glove.\r\n\r\n_Maschka_ refers also to the rare condition in which the hymen is\r\nsometimes said to be absent. As a matter of fact, however, in such\r\ncases, it is represented by a very narrow annular eminence, the genitals\r\nbeing in other respects normal. The smooth character of the eminence\r\nwill serve to differentiate it from the remains of a destroyed hymen.\r\nOther rare forms are:\r\n\r\n1. The _imperforate hymen_, an occlusive membrane, entirely blocking the\r\nvaginal orifice. In some cases, however, the hymen is not absolutely\r\nimperforate, a very small, punctiform aperture being present.\r\n\r\n2. The _cribriform hymen_, a hymen which is “imperforate” in the sense\r\nthat there is no opening of a size approaching the normal, but in which\r\nseveral minute apertures are present.\r\n\r\n3. The _septate_, _bridged_ or _divided hymen_ (_hymen bifenestratus_,\r\netc.), exhibits a strip of mucous membrane, most commonly running\r\ndirectly from before backward, occasionally, however, somewhat\r\nobliquely, across the aperture in the membrane, which is thus divided\r\ninto two equal or unequal parts. In some instances the process that\r\nbridges the aperture of the hymen is expanded in the vertical plane to\r\nform a septum which projects for some distance into the vagina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 24.—Septate Annular Hymen.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 25.—Septate Semilunar Hymen.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 26.—Extremely tough Annular Hymen, with an obliquely disposed\r\n    Septum.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 27.—Septate Hymen with Apertures of unequal size.\r\n]\r\n\r\n4. The _lobate_, _lobulated_, or _labiate hymen_, which consists of\r\nseveral (two to four) lobes on either side, each overlapping the next\r\nlike the tiles in a roof, whilst the aperture between the two sides has\r\nthe form of an antero-posterior slit (FIG. 37); in some cases the lobes\r\nof a lobulated hymen are so disposed that the membrane has the\r\nappearance of a fold of mucous membrane with a central furrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 28.—Septate Hymen with Apertures of unequal size.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 29.—Hymen with rudimentary Septum.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 30.—Hymen with posterior rudimentary Septum.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 31.—Labiate Hymen with posterior rudimentary Septum.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that an imperforate or cribriform hymen, by the hindrance\r\nit offers to the passage of the menstrual discharge, is liable at the\r\ntime of the menarche, and as soon as menstruation begins, to give rise\r\nto serious disorder and to pathological states.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 32.—Hymen with anterior rudimentary Septum.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 33.—Hymen with anterior rudimentary Septum projecting in a\r\n    opiniform Manner.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 34.—Hymen with anterior and posterior rudimentary Septa.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 35.—Hymen with filiform process projecting from the anterior\r\n    margin.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 36.—Hymen in which there are two symmetrically disposed thinned\r\n    areas.

The labia majora are elastic in consistence and\r\nare in close apposition with one another; the labia minora or nymphæ are\r\ncovered by the labia majora and are but little pigmented; the vestibule\r\nand the vaginal orifice are narrow, and the vagina itself is narrow,\r\ntense, and markedly rugose; the hymen is normal and uninjured (this, of\r\ncourse, is the most trustworthy of all the signs of virginity); the\r\nbreasts have the virgin conformation. In opposition to the plea that the\r\nhymen can be destroyed by other causes than defloration, as by a fall,\r\nespecially a fall which brings the external genitals in contact with\r\nsome hard body, or by diphtheritic, variolous, or syphilitic ulceration,\r\n_Maschka_ maintains that such occurrences are among the greatest\r\nrarities.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it is sufficiently well known that the presence of an\r\nuninjured hymen affords no certain assurance of actual virginity. Cases\r\nenough are recorded, both in older and more recent medical literature,\r\nin which even pregnancy occurred in women in whom the hymen had remained\r\nintact, the explanation being that during copulation penetration of the\r\npenis had failed to occur, the semen being ejaculated on the vulva.\r\n_Scanzoni_ and _Zweifel_ have recorded cases in which the intact hymen\r\noffered a hindrance to parturition. The first-named author explains\r\nthese occurrences by the assumption that the hymen was so stout that the\r\npenis was unable to rupture it. _Veit_ remarks that both male and female\r\nyouth, in these days of the continued advance of knowledge, are well\r\nacquainted with _coitus sine immissione penis_, and that very frequently\r\na woman who is informed that she is pregnant makes answer that this is\r\nimpossible, her paramour having assured her that pregnancy could not\r\noccur. On the other hand, cases are met with in which the aperture in\r\nthe hymen is a very large one, so large that the penis can penetrate to\r\nthe vagina without lacerating the membrane.\r\n\r\n_Broudardel_ reports a case of rape in which the lacerated hymen healed\r\nso completely that an expert maintained the integrity of the membrane,\r\nuntil another pointed out the fine scar.\r\n\r\nIn general, that we may be assured of the existence of virginity, we\r\nmust find the hymen uninjured; and, on the other hand, we must regard\r\nthe laceration of the membrane, unless known to be the result of\r\ngynecological examination or other manipulation, as a proof of\r\ndefloration.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times among savage races the integrity of the hymen was\r\nprized as a proof of virginity, and in the Bible also great stress is\r\nlaid on this sign in connection with defloration, and its absence was\r\neven regarded as a ground for the death punishment (Deut. xxii, 21). But\r\namongst other races the hymen was held in no particular esteem as a\r\ntoken of virginity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 46.—Mamma, the breast of a virgin aged eighteen years. (From\r\n    Toldt: Atlas of Human Anatomy.—Rebman Company, New York.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, and even at the present day in the Philippine Islands,\r\nthe Ladrone Islands, and certain other islands of the Polynesian\r\nArchipelago, also among many African tribes, the right of defloration\r\nbelonged, not to the bridegroom, but to every man belonging to the same\r\ntribe; sometimes on the bridal night all the men of the tribe had access\r\nto the bride, the bridegroom coming last, but thenceforward having\r\nundisputed possession of his wife. Amongst certain other tribes a\r\nsimilar custom prevails, differing however in this respect, that the\r\nrite of defloration is performed by a priest or by one of the chiefs of\r\nthe tribe. In mediæval Europe, again, the great landed proprietors\r\nexercised the well-known _jus primae noctis_ or _droit du seigneur_.\r\n\r\nIn girls at the time of the menarche who have long practiced\r\nmasturbation, some of the following indications of the habit will be\r\nfound: Elongation, redness, and general enlargement of the clitoris;\r\nelongation and thickening of the nymphæ, which are also of a tough\r\nconsistency and deeply pigmented; flaccidity of the labia majora;\r\nredness of the vaginal orifice; flaccidity of the hymen, which also may\r\nexhibit lacerations, caused by the forcible introduction of the finger\r\nor of some hard foreign body.\r\n\r\nNot until the time of the menarche do the breasts attain the\r\nhemispherical form which constitutes one of the graces of young\r\nwomanhood, and at the same time these organs assume a firm, elastic\r\nconsistency; their size of course varies in different individuals. The\r\nnipple now has a rose-red color, darker in brunettes than in blondes; it\r\nis usually small, sometimes quite inconspicuous, being withdrawn into a\r\ncutaneous furrow. The two breasts when regarded from the front are seen\r\nto diverge from the longitudinal axis of the body. In some cases even in\r\nchildhood, before the time of the menarche, the breasts are powerfully\r\ndeveloped, being as large as an apple or larger. This depends on\r\nclimate, race, and sexual excitement; as regards the last of these,\r\nearly sexual stimulation promotes premature mammary development.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is unusual for any secretion to appear in the mammary gland\r\nbefore the occurrence of pregnancy, cases have certainly been observed\r\nin which the breasts of virgins secreted a milk-like fluid, especially\r\nin consequence of sexual excitement or during menstruation. Thus\r\n_Maschka_ observed in a girl the condition of whose genital organs\r\nshowed her to be a _virgo intacta_ that pressure on the breast caused a\r\nfew drops of an opalescent fluid having the appearance of milk to exude\r\nfrom the nipple. She acknowledged that amatory relations had long\r\nsubsisted between her and a lover who was in the habit of handling her\r\nbreasts, and that this always produced strong sexual excitement.\r\n_Hofmann_ also reported that in two virgins who died during menstruation\r\nhe was able to express a drop of milk from the breast.\r\n\r\nThe most important indication of the general changes occurring in the\r\nexternal and internal genital organs, the proof that the young woman has\r\nbecome fitted for the fulfilment of her reproductive vocation, is the\r\nappearance of menstruation, a sanguineous discharge from the genital\r\norgans recurring every four weeks as the external manifestation of the\r\ninternal process of ovulation.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical changes that have already been described as occurring in\r\nthe genital organs at the time of the menarche will serve to elucidate\r\nthe numerous reflex processes that manifest themselves at this period of\r\nlife in so many departments of vital activity.\r\n\r\nIt is especially the extensive developmental processes in the ovary,\r\ninfluencing the nerves of that organ, which give rise to centripetal\r\nstimuli and evoke reflex manifestations. In the working of the\r\ncirculatory system, such influences are apparent; and during the\r\nmenarche, some time already before the first onset of menstruation,\r\nvariations occur in the blood-pressure, and these during menstruation\r\ntake the form of a typical undulatory curve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 47.—Horizontal section through the female breast. (From Toldt:\r\n    Atlas of Human Anatomy.—Rebman Company, New York.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThus it becomes comprehensible that even in healthy girls, the first\r\nappearance of the catamenia and likewise the expectation of the flow\r\ninduce a certain modification and alteration in the whole nature and\r\ndisposition. Girls often lose their previous cheerful and lively\r\ncharacter, becoming quiet, self-absorbed, sometimes even melancholy;\r\nthey are disinclined for study, have a repugnance to all sustained\r\nphysical or mental activity, become annoyed and snappish on slight\r\noccasion, are restless at night, consider themselves to be ailing, and\r\nso on. During the first menstruation girls commonly appear pale and\r\nanxious, they have blue lines beneath the eyes, the face has a tired\r\naspect, the movements lack energy, and a general want of tone combined\r\nwith an abnormal irritability may be noticed. Some days before the first\r\nmenstruation, the vulva, the labia majora and minora, and the vaginal\r\nmucous membrane, are swollen, the clitoris becomes conspicuous in\r\nconsequence of erectile processes, a slight secretion appears in the\r\ngenital passage, and the breasts become sensitive and slightly turgid.\r\nThe urine deposits a thick sediment, and occasionally severe strangury\r\nis observed. In many cases, also, digestive disturbances occur, loss of\r\nappetite, constipation, or a tendency to diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nThe first menstruation usually lasts four or five days. On the first day\r\nthe discharge is blood-stained mucus, thereafter becoming sanguineous.\r\nIn some cases, the bleeding at the first menstruation is profuse and of\r\nlong duration.\r\n\r\nIt is not always after the first menstruation that the subsequent\r\ndischarges follow at the regular intervals of four weeks. In delicate,\r\nanæmic girls the second menstruation may not occur till several months\r\nhave elapsed after the first; less often the second menstruation ensues\r\na fortnight after the first, or even earlier.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the menarche the sexual impulse, which has hitherto been\r\ndormant, becomes strongly developed. It is evoked at this time of life\r\nby the anatomico-physiological changes undergone by the reproductive\r\nglands; the stimulus aroused by these processes in the ovary, being\r\nconducted to the brain, awakens passion. At the same time the\r\nobservation of the growth of the hairy covering on the genital organs,\r\nthe development of the breasts, and the appearance of menstruation, tend\r\nto arouse erotic presentiments. The reading of romances, conversations\r\nwith female friends, and observation of the conduct of full-grown\r\npersons, convert these presentiments into clear ideas, and excite the\r\nimpulse to the production of passionate sexual sensations, the sexual\r\nimpulse. How far these stimuli arising from the reproductive apparatus\r\nare encouraged and accentuated, on the one hand, or repressed and\r\ndiminished, on the other, depends on external impressions of various\r\nkinds. The environment is the determinant for the further transformation\r\nof the as yet undifferentiated sexual impulse into the fully-developed\r\ncopulative and reproductive impulses.\r\n\r\nIn his work on the _Physiology of Love_, _Mantegazza_ describes the\r\nyearning and stress of the awakening sexual life, arising out of the\r\npresentiments, hazy sensations, and impulses, which are felt in the very\r\nearliest period of the developmental phase known as puberty.\r\n\r\nIn general, in a young girl during the menarche, the sexual impulse\r\nmanifests itself rather in the form of semi-conscious reverie, of\r\nplatonic love. The adolescent girl exercises her imagination with the\r\ncircumstances of her chaste love, her mind turns to this subject when in\r\nsolitude, her mood is apt to become melancholy, and it is the perusal of\r\nequivocal novels, or the educational assistance of sexually experienced\r\nfemale friends, that transforms the sexual impulse to a vivid flame.\r\n\r\nSome authors believe that a sign of the awakening of the sexual impulse\r\nwhen directed toward some particular man is a change of color on the\r\npart of the girl when she sees this individual or hears him spoken of.\r\nPalpitation of the heart comes on, the pulse is increased in frequency,\r\nthe respiration also, and the voice fails. In this manner, it is\r\nasserted, _Galen_ discovered the love of a Roman lady, Justa, for the\r\ndancer, Pylades.\r\n\r\nThe psychological reaction of the sexual impulse at the time of puberty\r\nmanifests itself, as _von Krafft-Ebing_ points out, in manifold ways,\r\ncommon to all of which, however, is the emotional state of the mind, and\r\nthe need that the strange and new feelings now experienced should find\r\nsome objective centre of interest. Such objective and emotional\r\ninterests lie ready to hand in religion and poetry, both of which, after\r\nthe period of sexual development is at an end, and the originally\r\nincomprehensible desires and impulses have received an explanation,\r\ncontinue to have intimate relations with the world of sexual experience.\r\nAny one who doubts this must be reminded of the frequency with which\r\nreligious fanaticism makes its appearance at the time of puberty. No\r\nless influential is the sexual factor in the awakening of æsthetic\r\nfeelings. This world of the ideal opens itself at the time when the\r\ndevelopment of the sexual processes begins. * * * The love of early\r\nyouth, continues _von Krafft-Ebing_, has a romantic, idealizing\r\ntendency. In its first manifestations it is platonic, and willingly\r\nexercises itself in poetry and history. But as the sensibility awakens,\r\nthe danger arises that this passion, with its idealizing power, will be\r\ntransferred to persons of the opposite sex who in intellectual,\r\nphysical, and social relations are by no means all that could be wished.\r\nHence proceed misalliances, elopements, and seductions, with the entire\r\ntragedy of impassioned love, which conflicts with the dictates of\r\nmorality and convention, and sometimes finds its bitter end in suicide\r\nor a double self-destruction. Love in which the senses play too\r\nprominent a part can never be a true and lasting love. For this reason,\r\nfirst love is as a rule very transitory, since it is in most cases no\r\nmore than the first flare of passion. * * * Platonic love is a thing\r\nwithout existence, a self-deception, a false description of sexual\r\nsensations.\r\n\r\n_Bebel_ remarks that the number of suicides among women of the ages of\r\nsixteen to twenty-one years is an exceptionally large one, and he refers\r\nthis chiefly to unsatisfied sexual impulse, unfortunate love, secret\r\npregnancy, and to betrayal by men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MENARCHE PRAECOX ET TARDIVA.\r\n\r\n\r\n            (_Precocious and Retarded Menstrual Activity._)\r\n\r\nBy the term _precocious menarche_ we understand the pathological state\r\nin which a typical, four-weekly, sanguineous discharge from the female\r\ngenital organs sets in at an abnormally early age, and is to be regarded\r\nas a symptom of a premature sexual development. Very commonly such\r\nchildren with precocious menstruation and premature sexual development,\r\nexhibit a comparatively high body-weight, great development of fat,\r\nearly dentition; they look older than their years; and they have genital\r\norgans that also develop very early, with hair on the pubes and in the\r\naxillæ; the labia majora and the breasts resemble those of full-grown\r\nwomen, and the pelvis also has the adult form. Commonly also the sexual\r\nimpulse develops early, whilst, in other respects, the intellectual\r\ndevelopment lags behind the physical. It is most probably a primary\r\nhyperplasia of the ovaries that gives rise to precocious menstruation,\r\nthe ovarian follicles ripening earlier than usual. Frequently other\r\npathological processes are associated with this early sexual\r\ndevelopment, such as general lipomatosis, rachitis, and new growths of\r\nthe ovaries. In several cases of this nature, early conception has also\r\nbeen observed. According to oriental tradition, Khadijah was married at\r\nthe age of five years to the prophet Mohammed, who cohabited with her\r\nthree years later.\r\n\r\nEven if we except those cases in which in earliest infancy there is a\r\nsanguineous discharge from the vagina which remains, however, an\r\nisolated occurrence, or if repeated is repeated a few times only and at\r\nquite unequal intervals (cases in which the bleeding cannot be regarded\r\nas menstrual—such, for instance as were reported by _Eröss_ of six\r\nnew-born female infants in whom a sanguineous discharge from the vagina\r\nappeared three or four days after birth and lasted two to five days, the\r\ninfants not remaining subsequently under observation),—numerous\r\nwell-authenticated cases yet remain in which menstrual hæmorrhage was\r\nobserved before the end of the first year of life. One case, even, is\r\nrecorded by _Bernard_ in which from the time of birth to the twelfth\r\nyear menstruation with molimina occurred every month, lasting two days;\r\nfrom the twelfth to the fourteenth year menstruation ceased, recurring\r\nsubsequently at irregular intervals.\r\n\r\nIn the recorded cases of such precocious menstruation the menstruation\r\nrecurred as a rule at regular intervals of four weeks; only in quite\r\nexceptional cases were the intervals three to five months.\r\n\r\nSome of the most striking and well-authenticated cases of precocious\r\nmenstruation recorded in the recent literature of the subject are\r\nappended.\r\n\r\nObserved by _Combys_: A girl aged 6 years and 2 months had the\r\nappearance of a girl aged 14 or 15; she was a brunette, 3′ 10½″ in\r\nheight, with full, firm, rounded breasts, girth of chest 28⅓″, mons\r\nVeneris covered with hair, uterus normal on rectal examination, hymen\r\nintact; menstruation had occurred regularly since the second year of\r\nlife. Mother and five sisters began to menstruate between the ages of\r\ntwelve and fourteen. General condition good.\r\n\r\nCase recorded by _Diamant_: A girl aged 6 years, weight 75 pounds,\r\nthighs, buttocks, and breasts developed like those of a sexually mature\r\nwoman, axillæ and mons Veneris covered with hair. Menstruation began at\r\nthe age of 2 and recurred regularly, the flow lasting 4 days.\r\n\r\nCase recorded by _Plyette_: A girl with precocious physical development\r\nbegan to menstruate in the fourth year of life; menstruation continued\r\nregularly with the exception of two monthly periods, when vicarious\r\nepistaxis occurred.\r\n\r\nFrom the collection made by _Gebhard_ of the records of fifty-four cases\r\nof precocious menstruation, giving the first appearance and the type of\r\nmenstruation, the development of the breasts, the other signs of\r\npremature sexual development, and any complications that may have been\r\nobserved, we extract the age at which the first menstruation occurred.\r\nThis was:\r\n\r\n             In a new-born infant in               1 case.\r\n             At the age of 2 weeks in              1 case.\r\n             At the age of 2 months in             1 case.\r\n             At the age of 3 months in             1 case.\r\n             At the age of 4 months in             1 case.\r\n             At the age of 5 months in             1 case.\r\n             At the age of 7 months in             1 case.\r\n             At the age of 9 months in             4 cases.\r\n             At the age of 10 months in            2 cases.\r\n             At the age of 12 months in            5 cases.\r\n             At the age of 15 months in            1 case.\r\n             At the age of 16 months in            1 case.\r\n             At the age of 18 months in            2 cases.\r\n             At the age of 19 months in            1 case.\r\n             At the age of 22 months in            1 case.\r\n             At the age of 2 years in              4 cases.\r\n             At the age of 2½ years in             1 case.\r\n             At the age of 2 years and 9 months in 1 case.\r\n             At the age of 3 years in              6 cases.\r\n             At the age of 3½ years in             1 case.\r\n             At the age of 4 years in              4 cases.\r\n             At the age of 4 years and 3 months in 1 case.\r\n             At the age of 5 years in              1 case.\r\n             At the age of 5½ years in             1 case.\r\n             At the age of 6 years in              1 case.\r\n             At the age of 6½ years in             1 case.\r\n             At the age of 7 years in              3 cases.\r\n             At the age of 9 years in              2 cases.\r\n             At the age of 11½ years in            1 case.\r\n\r\nFrom this collection of _Gebhard’s_ we learn that in one case\r\nmenstruation already existed at birth, and that in a large number of\r\ncases it occurred before the expiration of the first year. In many cases\r\nthe development of the breasts preceded the appearance of menstruation,\r\nand was noticed from the time of birth. The vulva also early exhibited\r\nthe characteristics seen in the sexually mature woman. Further, a high\r\nbody-weight, great development of fat, and early dentition, were usually\r\nseen in these cases, in which, however, the intellectual development was\r\nnot in correspondence with that of the body.\r\n\r\nIn several of these cases of premature puberty, moreover, sexual\r\nintercourse and even parturition occurred at a very early age. A girl in\r\nwhom menstruation began at the age of one year, gave birth to a child\r\nwhen she was ten years old (_Montgomery_). A girl who began to\r\nmenstruate at the age of nine years, became pregnant very shortly\r\nafterward (_d’Outreport_). The well-known case recorded by _Haller_, in\r\nwhich at birth the pubic hair was already grown, and in which\r\nmenstruation began at the age of two years, was also one of very early\r\npregnancy, the girl giving birth to a child when nine years old. Another\r\ngirl in whom at birth the pubes were already covered with hair began to\r\nmenstruate when four years old, copulated regularly from the age of\r\neight, and at nine years became pregnant, and was delivered of a\r\nvesicular mole with an embryo (_Molitor_). A girl began to menstruate at\r\nthe age of two, had a growth of hair on the pubes and developed mammæ at\r\nthe age of three, and became pregnant at the age of eight (_Carus_).\r\nWith these cases must be classed that observed by _Martin_ in America of\r\na woman who was a grandmother at the age of twenty-six. _Lantier_, in\r\nhis Travels in Greece, speaks of a mother of twenty-five with a daughter\r\nof thirteen.\r\n\r\nObservations made by _Kussmaul_ and by _Hofmeier_ prove that in many\r\ncases changes in the ovaries form the probable cause of precocious\r\nmenstruation and the other phenomena of premature puberty. In one case\r\nof _Hofmeier’s_, for instance, of a girl of five with precocious\r\nmenstruation, the removal of a rapidly growing ovarian tumor was\r\nfollowed by the cessation of menstruation, and the pubic hair, which had\r\nbeen shaved off, did not grow again.\r\n\r\nAbnormally early puberty related to the early practice of sexual\r\nintercourse is seen in many prostitutes. This is shown by the following\r\nfigures relating to 150 prostitutes in Russia. Sexual intercourse began:\r\n\r\n               In   1 prostitute at the age of  9 years.\r\n               In   1 prostitute at the age of 10 years.\r\n               In  4 prostitutes at the age of 12 years.\r\n               In 12 prostitutes at the age of 13 years.\r\n               In 14 prostitutes at the age of 14 years.\r\n               In 33 prostitutes at the age of 15 years.\r\n               In 36 prostitutes at the age of 16 years.\r\n\r\nThus, among the 150 prostitutes, 65 were less than 16 years of age.\r\n\r\n_Parent-Duchatelet_ found among 3,517 prostitutes under official\r\nobservation, 5.6 per cent. under 17 years of age. There were:\r\n\r\n                   2 prostitutes under 10 years of age.\r\n                   3 prostitutes under 11 years of age.\r\n                   3 prostitutes under 12 years of age.\r\n                   6 prostitutes under 13 years of age.\r\n                  20 prostitutes under 14 years of age.\r\n                  51 prostitutes under 15 years of age.\r\n                 111 prostitutes under 16 years of age.\r\n\r\n_Martineau’s_ observations also showed that in nearly all prostitutes\r\nthe first coitus took place in very early youth. Of 607 prostitutes\r\nthere were 489 in whom defloration had occurred between the ages of 5\r\nand 20 years. According to _Grimmaldi_ and _Gurrieri_ defloration\r\nusually takes place in prostitutes before they attain the age of 10\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nSometimes we find increased sexuality in early life as a pathological\r\nmanifestation—psychopathia sexualis. Thus, _Esquirol_ records the case\r\nof a little girl aged four years who undertook improper manipulations in\r\nassociation with little boys. A female prisoner, _Lombroso_ writes, had\r\nat the age of six years practiced mutual masturbation with her brother\r\naged seven, and at the age of eight years underwent defloration; another\r\nmurderess, while still a schoolgirl, had conducted herself after the\r\nmanner of an experienced prostitute. _Laurent_ reports the case of a\r\ngirl who from the age of ten was engaged in sexual malpractices with her\r\nbrothers and sisters, and finally underwent defloration at the age of\r\nfifteen.\r\n\r\nIn many cases premature sexual development is manifested by enlargement\r\nof the breasts and growth of the axillary and pubic hair, and yet\r\nmenstruation fails to appear. Thus, _Kussmaul_ has observed girls who\r\nwhile yet children exhibited all the external characteristics of\r\nsexually mature women, but who had not yet begun to menstruate. _Ploss_\r\nhas published a photograph showing in a girl five years of age the mons\r\nVeneris and the labia majora developed like those of a full-grown young\r\nwoman, and covered with long thick hair; in this case, however, not only\r\nhad menstruation not yet begun, but the breasts were still in the\r\ninfantile condition.\r\n\r\nThe opposite state to menarche praecox is that in which the first\r\nappearance of menstruation is unduly delayed; it may be even till after\r\nthe age of twenty. Such a postponement of the menarche sometimes occurs\r\nin girls who exhibit at this period of life an extraordinarily great\r\ngeneral fatty development of the body, or a notably severe chlorotic\r\nstate of the blood, or in whom during the years of development some\r\nsudden and extensive change in the mode of life has occurred, as for\r\ninstance when the girl’s place of residence has been removed from the\r\ncountry to the town, or when she has had to undertake some completely\r\nnew kind of physical or mental work. _Raciborski_ attributes the late\r\nappearance of menstruation, at the ages of 20, 22, 24, or 26, in\r\notherwise healthy girls, to an “apathy of the sexual sense,” a phrase\r\nwhich does not convey much meaning.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Marc d’Espine_, puberty occurs early in girls with dark\r\nhair, grey eyes, a delicate white skin, and of a powerful build; late,\r\non the other hand, in girls with chestnut hair, greenish eyes, a coarse\r\ndarkly-pigmented skin, and of a delicate weakly build.\r\n\r\nThe genitals of girls in whom the first appearance of menstruation is\r\ndelayed, frequently exhibit distinct signs of the backwardness of the\r\nreproductive organs in their development. The external genitals, in such\r\ncases, have little if any covering of hair, and are flabby and relaxed;\r\nthe body and the fundus of the uterus are shorter and more slender than\r\nusual, the uterus as a whole is small and flaccid, sometimes anteflexed;\r\nthe vaginal portion of the cervix is small, often almost undeveloped,\r\nits anterior lip barely projecting above the surface of the vaginal\r\nfornix; the vagina is usually short and narrow. The ovaries also are\r\nflaccid and inelastic, and occasionally are remarkably small. The\r\nbreasts are small, the nipples and areolæ undeveloped.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, notwithstanding the delay in the appearance of the\r\nmenarche, the genital apparatus is developed to a degree quite in\r\ncorrespondence with the age, but some pathological condition is present,\r\nfor instance, the mucous membrane secretes excessively, exhibits a\r\ncatarrhal tendency, there are erosions at the os uteri, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PATHOLOGY OF THE MENARCHE.\r\n\r\nA series of disturbances of function and pathological changes in the\r\norgans may occur at the time of the menarche, either directly connected\r\nwith the genital organs, or etiologically dependent upon the changes\r\noccurring in these organs.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of menstruation, as we have already mentioned, may\r\nitself be abnormal in character, being either precocious (menarche\r\nprecox), or retarded (menarche tardiva). But even where menstruation\r\nbegins in a normal manner, the period of the menarche may be disturbed\r\nby a great number of pathological phenomena, of which the developmental\r\nprocesses occurring in the genital organs of the young girl must be\r\nregarded as the cause. First of all, the menstrual hæmorrhage itself may\r\nbe abnormal in amount and duration. Then, again, functional disturbances\r\nof the most various character may occur: especially prominent are,\r\ndisturbances of hæmatopoiesis, of the cardiac functions, and of the\r\nnervous system, and constitutional anomalies, which deserve attentive\r\nconsideration; in addition we have to mention disorders of digestion and\r\ndisorders of the sense-organs, among which latter certain changes in the\r\nskin especially deserve attention.\r\n\r\nThe diseases of the female genital organs at the time of the menarche\r\nare very various in nature. Whereas during infancy and early childhood\r\nthe uterus and its annexa are in a state of complete quiescence, so that\r\nnothing occurs in them to attract attention, at the approach of puberty\r\nthese organs emerge from obscurity, and the percentage of diseases of\r\nthe reproductive organs suddenly rises to a great height. In very young\r\ngirls, among diseases of these organs, we observe only malformations,\r\nmalignant tumors, and gonorrhœal infections, and these pathological\r\nstates, even, are quite rare; but at puberty all this is altered, and we\r\nhave to do with disturbances of the menstrual function and their\r\nconsequences, and with various inflammatory processes, and the period of\r\nsexual maturity offers us an overplus of diseases connected with the\r\nreproductive system, justifying the epigram of the French gynecologist\r\nwho defined a sexually mature woman as “_un uterus servi par des\r\norganes_.”[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Anomalies of Menstruation._\r\n\r\nNot infrequently, though the catamenial flow has appeared at the usual\r\nage and has for a time been regular, pathological disturbances of this\r\nfunction ensue.\r\n\r\nAmenorrhœa at the time of the menarche may depend on complete aplasia of\r\nthe ovaries, associated with a rudimentary and imperfect development of\r\nthe uterus. In such girls, the development of whose reproductive system\r\nis thus imperfect, the continually expected menstrual flow fails to\r\nappear, in spite of the fact that a recurrent menstrual discomfort,\r\nevoked by the congestion of the genital organs, recurs at intervals of\r\nfour weeks; as, for instance, colicky pains in the abdomen, irritable,\r\nnervous states, and mental disturbances. Further, amenorrhœa may be due\r\nto one of the various forms of atresia of the genital organs, as for\r\ninstance to vaginal or hymeneal atresia. In such individuals the first\r\nperiod passes by without anything to attract attention. But at the\r\nsecond period, distress will usually be manifested; and from this time\r\nforward, painful contractions of the uterus will continue to occur at\r\nfour-weekly intervals, and to become more violent as period succeeds\r\nperiod, whilst the menstrual discharge is wanting, or, to speak\r\nstrictly, fails to find an outlet. The blood collects behind the seat of\r\natresia, and the accumulation gives rise to pressure symptoms affecting\r\nthe bladder and the rectum, and ultimately also the sacral nerves.\r\n\r\nMenstruation, after its first appearance in normal fashion, may be\r\nsuppressed in young girls in consequence of mental impressions, such as\r\nsudden fright; such cases are observed after an escape from a fire, or\r\nafter a railway accident. Mental stimuli of less intensity but longer\r\nduration have a similar effect; sometimes these take the form of\r\nauto-suggestion. A well-known instance of the latter phenomenon is\r\nfurnished by the case of a girl who, in consequence either of actual\r\nintercourse or it may be merely of too intimate an embrace with a man,\r\nfears she has become pregnant, and actually suffers from amenorrhœa\r\nthough pregnancy does not really exist. I saw a case in which amenorrhœa\r\nwas thus produced in a girl seventeen years of age, whose ideas on the\r\nprocess of sexual intercourse were still far from clear. She had\r\npermitted a young man to kiss her repeatedly and fervently, and to clasp\r\nher in a close embrace. She was then afraid that she had become\r\npregnant; the catamenial flow, which had been regular since she was\r\nfifteen years old, ceased to appear; and it was not until at length I\r\nwas consulted, was able to assure myself that the girl was essentially\r\nvirgin, and was, therefore, in a position to reassure her as to her own\r\ncondition, that menstruation again became regular.\r\n\r\nFunctional amenorrhœa may also occur in young girls in consequence of a\r\nsudden change in the conditions of life, a removal from town to country,\r\nfor instance, or the reverse, travel in regions where the climatic\r\nconditions differ widely from those hitherto experienced, or a change\r\nfrom an active to a sedentary kind of occupation. Of this nature is the\r\nfollowing case observed by _Winter_: Miss Q., aged 20; menstruation\r\nbegan at the age of 13 and was regular thereafter; on three successive\r\noccasions amenorrhœa occurred during a visit to Berlin, in one case\r\nlasting 3 months, another 2 months, and a third 6 weeks, whereas when at\r\nhome menstruation was regular though somewhat scanty. There were no\r\nmolimina. Examination showed the wall of the uterus to be thin, length\r\nof this organ 7 centimetres (2¾″), both ovaries distinctly palpable.\r\nSuch a form of amenorrhœa as this, commonly disappears when the girl\r\nremoves from the conditions unfavorable to the fulfilment of her sexual\r\nfunctions to the conditions favorable to that function.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently a chill is in young girls the cause of suppression of\r\nthe menstrual flow that has hitherto been quite regular, especially\r\neffective in this respect being, standing in cold water, getting the\r\nfeet wet, the influence of rain and wind at the menstrual period on the\r\ninsufficiently clothed lower extremities, and vaginal injections with\r\nwater at too low a temperature. Such cases are common among the working\r\nclasses, especially in washerwomen; but they are also observed among the\r\nwell-to-do. An example is given by _Winter_: Miss H., aged 19;\r\nmenstruation began at the age of 13, regular, at intervals of 4 weeks,\r\nthe flow lasting 2 to 3 days, and being normal in amount. Several years\r\nago the patient caught a severe cold through paddling in cold water\r\nduring the period. Suppression of the menses resulted, amenorrhœa being\r\ncomplete for a year and a half. Then menstruation recommenced, but was\r\nirregular, sometimes anticipating, sometimes postponing the proper\r\nperiod, the interval being occasionally as long as four months; when it\r\noccurred, the flow was represented by a drop or two of blood only, and\r\ndysmenorrhœa was severe. At each proper period, if the flow failed to\r\nappear, severe molimina occurred in the form of abdominal cramps and\r\nheadache. Examination showed the uterus to be normal in shape, 4½\r\ncentimetres (1¾″) in length, with a very thin wall; both ovaries were\r\npalpable, but smaller than normal.\r\n\r\nThe commonest form of amenorrhœa at this period of life is, however, the\r\nconstitutional amenorrhœa associated with chlorosis. In chlorotic\r\nsubjects we have to do, not with a symptomatic absence of the menstrual\r\ndischarge, but with a failure of the ovarian function, the graafian\r\nfollicles failing to ripen. We generally find, according to _Gebhard_,\r\nthat chlorotic girls begin to menstruate at the usual age, or even\r\nearlier. Menstruation recurs once or twice at irregular intervals, and\r\nthen gives place to complete amenorrhœa, it may be suddenly, it may be\r\ngradually, the flow on each occasion being scantier than before. In\r\nchlorotic patients, the menstrual discharge, when present, is very thin\r\nand watery, and often contains a large admixture of mucus derived from\r\nthe cervical canal and the cavity of the uterus. The amenorrhœa may be\r\nof short duration; or it may last for a long time; so that it is not\r\nuntil after the lapse of months or years, and as a rule in consequence\r\nof suitable treatment, that menstruation recurs, being henceforward\r\neither normal in frequency and strength, or on the other hand\r\npermanently scanty and of the postponing type. The associated disorders\r\nfrom which the patients suffer take the form of headache, dizziness,\r\nsyncope, feelings of oppression, disinclination for mental and physical\r\nexertion, and so on. Since in such cases the ripening of the ovarian\r\nfollicles also fails to occur, when the amenorrhœa is complete the\r\nmenstrual molimina are generally wanting (_Gebhard_).\r\n\r\n_Stephenson_ also states that in girls who have been chlorotic for a\r\nlonger or a shorter time, menstruation frequently begins very early, in\r\nany case earlier than in healthy girls.\r\n\r\nUsually in these cases various other disorders are associated with the\r\namenorrhœa, such as colicky pains in the abdomen, sensitiveness of the\r\nabdominal wall to contact or pressure, headaches, attacks of hemicrania,\r\ngeneral mental depression, and hysterical manifestations.\r\n\r\nIn chlorotic girls, at the times when menstruation is due, a watery\r\ndischarge often occurs, sometimes slightly tinged with blood.\r\nDysmenorrhœa may also occur at such times.\r\n\r\nAttacks of menorrhagia in young girls are usually dependent on\r\ndisturbances of the nervous system. Sometimes such an attack occurs at\r\nthe very first menstrual period. Occasionally also menorrhagia may occur\r\nin association with chlorosis, to be distinguished according to\r\n_Virchow_ from a rare condition named by him “menorrhagic chlorosis,”\r\ncharacterized by excessive menstruation of an anticipating type. The\r\nbleeding is in such cases seldom very profuse, however, but the periods\r\nare very long, and the intervals exceedingly short. _Castan_ regards\r\nsuch profuse menorrhagia and metrorrhagia occurring in young chlorotic\r\ngirls, especially at the commencement of puberty, as of an endoïnfective\r\nnature dependent upon auto-intoxication. The toxins lead to inflammatory\r\nand degenerative changes in the muscular substance of the uterus.\r\nAccording to _Frænkel_ in these cases the ovaries are usually enlarged,\r\nseldom smaller than normal.\r\n\r\n_Frœlich_ has discussed this subject exhaustively in his monograph on\r\n_Menorrhagia of Young Girls and Hypertrophy of the Cervix Uteri_.[21] He\r\nstates that the cases of menorrhagia in young girls at the time of the\r\nmenarche may be arranged in two groups. In one of these the patients are\r\nchlorotic, and menstruation is normal neither in amount nor in duration,\r\nbut it is the long continuance of the flow rather than its profuseness\r\nthat gives rise to danger; in the cases belonging to the other group the\r\npatients are in excellent health at the commencement of puberty, but\r\nmenstruation soon takes the form of long-continued and profuse\r\nmenorrhagia. Cases of the latter kind are due to hypertrophy of the\r\ncervix uteri and fungous metritis. Such attacks of menorrhagia in young\r\ngirls are seen also in cases of infectious disorders, as in smallpox,\r\nmeasles, scarlatina, and above all, influenza. The hæmorrhage often\r\nbegins in the first days of the infection, and even during the period of\r\nincubation, one or two days before the appearance of the general\r\nsymptoms. If the patient is attacked by influenza while menstruating,\r\nthe menstrual flow may assume the character of a true menorrhagia. More\r\noften, however, in such cases, we have to do with an extra-menstrual\r\nhæmorrhage, such as may indeed be observed in girls who have not yet\r\nbegun to menstruate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Inflammatory Processes._\r\n\r\nChronic metro-endometritis, both corporal and cervical, occurs\r\noccasionally in young girls during the years of development. It is\r\nespecially common in chlorotic subjects; and next to these in girls who\r\nare careless about the observance of hygienic precautionary measures\r\nduring the menstruation. Thus it may result from physical exertion among\r\nthe working classes; and from dancing, skating, riding, or\r\nmountaineering, among girls belonging to the well-to-do classes, during\r\nmenstruation. Again, we meet with it in girls who work very hard at the\r\nsewing-machine; and, finally, in those who have long practiced\r\nmasturbation. Through uncleanliness at the time of menstruation, the\r\nblood with which chemise and drawers are stained and the pubic hair\r\nsoiled, undergoes decomposition, and this may lead to catarrhal\r\ninflammation of the vulva and vagina and of the endometrium. The most\r\nstriking symptom in persons thus affected is the discharge of mucus,\r\nwhich in cervical metro-endometritis leads to a very moist condition of\r\nthe external genitals, and leaves greenish-yellow spots on the\r\nunder-linen; in corporal metro-endometritis the discharge is of a\r\nthinner consistence, milky in appearance, and not very abundant. As a\r\nresult of the endometritis, the patient suffers from various pains in\r\nthe body, a feeling of fulness, sacrache, general sense of fatigue, and\r\ndiverse nervous manifestations; sometimes also from dysmenorrhœa,\r\nstrangury, or obstinate constipation. In consequence of the great\r\nthickening of the mucous membrane that often occurs, menstruation\r\nbecomes very profuse and long-continued, lasting from one to two weeks.\r\n\r\nA form of chronic vulvitis, sometimes, though indeed quite rarely, met\r\nwith in girls at this time of life, is inflammation of the external\r\ngenitals dependent on masturbation. As characteristic signs of this we\r\nmay observe an elongation of the nymphæ, the clitoris, or the præputium\r\nclitoridis, and at the same time on the inner surface of the greatly\r\nstretched labiæ we may notice a great increase in the sebaceous glands,\r\nso that the yellowish spots formed by these structures may be seen\r\nbeneath the mucous membrane with the unassisted eye—the mucous surface,\r\nindeed, may be slightly uneven in consequence of their enlargement, so\r\nthat they resemble small retention-cysts. The mucous membrane of the\r\nvulva between the margin of the hymen and the nymphæ is moreover,\r\naccording to _Veit’s_ description of masturbatory vulvitis, often beset\r\nwith small pointed excrescences, the soft furrow between the clitoris\r\nand the external orifice of the urethra being very commonly marked by\r\nswelling of the mucous membrane and the presence of these little\r\noutgrowths; but sometimes also the parts lying to either side of the\r\nurethral orifice may exhibit similar changes. These small structures\r\ndiffer entirely from pointed condylomata—they do not branch, they occur\r\nonly upon the vulval surface proper, not upon the parts exhibiting the\r\ncharacters of true skin, and they are non-infecting. More particularly,\r\nit must be remembered, we find these changes principally in virgins in\r\nwhom on account of obscure symptoms an examination of the genital organs\r\nhas been undertaken, and who suffer in addition from nervous and\r\nhysterical manifestations. The hymen, when intact, as it usually is in\r\nthese cases, furnishes objective evidence that sexual intercourse is not\r\nthe cause of the patient’s trouble, and indeed a distinctly\r\nascertainable cause is hard to find. The patient usually exhibits\r\nabnormal sensitiveness and excessive prudery. _Veit_ is of opinion that\r\nthe association of all these symptoms justifies the diagnosis of\r\nmasturbation as the exciting cause of the chronic vulvitis; in such\r\ncases we may at one time find the mucous membrane pale, but at a later\r\nexamination fiery red, and we often see a clear, transparent secretion\r\nexuding from the ducts of Bartholin’s glands.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of long-continued masturbation, other pathological\r\nchanges may take place in the female genital organs, such as hypertrophy\r\nof the nymphæ, proliferation or glandular hypertrophy of the uterine\r\nmucous membrane, ovarian irritation, pains in the ovarian region which,\r\nin severe attacks, may radiate to the thighs. These pains become more\r\nsevere at the menstrual period, especially at the beginning of that\r\nperiod; and are sometimes also especially troublesome in the middle of\r\nthe intermenstrual interval, in this case usually as a result of great\r\nbodily exertion.\r\n\r\nThese morbid processes in the genital organs of young girls have long\r\nattracted the attention of physicians, and it is more than sixty years\r\nsince _Bennet_ described the “virginal metritis” observed by him in\r\ntwenty-three virgins. _Bonton_ published in 1887 a monograph on this\r\ncondition. _Gallard_ assigns masturbation as its principal cause.\r\n\r\nRetroflexion of the uterus is also sometimes observed in virgins,\r\ninduced by the bad habits which are so common in young girls of\r\nretaining the urine for excessively long periods and of neglecting\r\nconstipation. The prolonged distension of the bladder leads to a daily,\r\nlong-continued stretching of the ligamentous apparatus of the uterus;\r\nthe full bladder presses the uterus backwards, and after the viscus has\r\nbeen emptied, the flaccid ligaments are no longer able to restore the\r\nuterus to its normal position of anteflexion. The organ is left with its\r\nfundus directed backwards, and the intra-abdominal pressure keeps it\r\npermanently in this position; at the same time, an accumulation of fæces\r\nin the rectum, by pressing the cervix forward, favors this displacement\r\nof the uterus. Moreover, when the uterine tissues are flaccid through\r\nmalnutrition in chlorotic or anæmic subjects, the organ yields more\r\nreadily to mechanical influences than it would if its muscular tone was\r\nhealthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Disorders of Hæmatopoiesis._\r\n\r\nChlorosis is in general rightly regarded as a disease of the period of\r\npuberty etiologically dependent on the processes that at this time of\r\nlife occur in the genital organs. Its appearance generally coincides\r\nwith the menarche, occurring at the age of 14 to 16, or even later, at\r\nthe age of 19 to 21. As regards the composition of the blood in\r\nchlorosis, investigations have shown that its hæmoglobin-richness is\r\nalways diminished; its specific gravity is proportionately lessened, but\r\nthe specific gravity of the serum is normal. The erythrocytes are normal\r\nin number, or only slightly diminished; their shape is sometimes normal,\r\nsometimes, however, poikilocytosis is present. The leucocytes are\r\ngenerally normal both as regards number and form; myelocytes\r\n(_Markzellen_) are also described as present in the blood of chlorotic\r\npatients (_Neusser_, _Hammerschlag_, _Gilbert_, _Weil_); the\r\nblood-plates are normal in number, the alkalinity of the blood also\r\nnormal, the isotonicity of the erythrocytes rather low.\r\n\r\nThe relation of chlorosis to the menarche is variously explained.\r\n_Kahane_, in his elaborate monograph on chlorosis, regards it as an\r\nindependent disease belonging to the group of “disorders of vegetation”\r\n(_Kundrat_), one which “according to its essential nature is an\r\nexpression of the disharmony that obtains between the congenitally\r\ninefficient hæmatopoietic apparatus and the demands made upon the\r\nfeminine organism by the processes of puberty.”\r\n\r\nAn insufficiency of the hæmatopoietic organs as regards their functional\r\ncapacity is believed by _Kahane_ to be in the case of women so far\r\nphysiological inasmuch as their blood is inferior to that of men in\r\nhæmoglobin-richness and corpuscular richness to the extent of about 10\r\nper cent. In this way the predisposition of the female sex to chlorosis\r\nmay perhaps be explained. A further fact which must be taken into\r\nconsideration is the difference between the development undergone by the\r\nrespective sexes at puberty. In the female sex, this development is\r\nquickly completed, and has the characteristics of a revolution; but in\r\nthe male, the development is a more gradual one, and has the\r\ncharacteristics of an evolution.\r\n\r\n_F. A. Hoffmann_ also regards chlorosis as associated with the\r\ndevelopment of the uterus and the establishment of menstruation. It is\r\npossible that these processes exercise some reflex influence; but we\r\nmust also remember that the chemical processes involved in the growth\r\nand maturation of the ovarian follicles are still insufficiently\r\nunderstood, and that it is quite possible that these too may have\r\npowerful and unaccustomed effects on the organism such as may well\r\ndisturb metabolic processes of a somewhat unstable character.\r\n\r\n_Grawitz_, who regards chlorosis as a vasomotor neurosis in which\r\ndisturbances arise in the interchange of fluids between the tissues and\r\nthe vessels, refers the appearance of chlorosis at puberty to the\r\ngeneral disposition to disorder exhibited at this age by the vasomotor\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nOther authors consider chlorosis to be an ovarian auto-intoxication,\r\nbelieving that under certain conditions the ovaries give off into the\r\norganism certain poisons; or, on the other hand, supposing that a\r\ncertain antitoxic function, normally possessed by the ovary, fails. _Von\r\nNoorden_, for instance, regards chlorosis as a disorder of blood\r\nformation referable to a disturbance of the internal secretion of the\r\novary during the developmental period.\r\n\r\n_Blondel_, who also regards ovarian auto-intoxication as causal, is of\r\nopinion that chlorosis is induced by products of decomposition formed in\r\nthe organism during the process of growth. As in childhood the thymus\r\ngland, so later in life the ovary, renders these products innocuous.\r\nWhen this peculiar functional activity of the ovary is retarded in its\r\nappearance, the intoxication effected by the products of decomposition\r\nformed during the process of growth gives rise to chlorosis.\r\n\r\n_Meinert_, in an interesting manner, brings the harmfulness of wearing a\r\ncorset during the years of development into etiological relations with\r\nchlorosis. In the transitional period between childhood and the age of\r\npuberty the wearing of the corset usually begins. Now _Meinert_\r\ndiscovered that in chlorosis, as a result of wearing a corset, a\r\nvertical or subvertical position of the stomach ensues as a partial\r\nmanifestation of enteroptosis, leading to tension on the abdominal\r\nplexus of the sympathetic, which in turn results in changes in the\r\nblood, and other nervous symptoms. According to this view, chlorosis is\r\na peculiar general neurosis dependent upon an artificially induced\r\ngastroptosis; this form of enteroptosis being due, not to relaxation of\r\nthe suspensory ligaments of the abdominal viscera, but to pressure\r\nexercised by adjacent organs in consequence of a change in the form of\r\nthe thorax, which has been permanently constricted by tight-lacing\r\n(_fixierter Schnurthorax_).\r\n\r\nOf importance is the fact that in girls suffering from chlorosis a\r\ncondition of hypoplasia of the genital organs is not infrequently met\r\nwith. It would seem, not only that imperfect development of the female\r\ngenital organs may be a cause of chlorotic changes in the blood, as\r\nappears possible in view of the relations between the ovaries and the\r\nhæmatopoietic organs through the intermediation of the sympathetic\r\nsystem; but also that genuine chlorosis and the anomalies of the genital\r\norgans met with in this disease, may perhaps be common manifestations of\r\nsome more general disturbance.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Virchow_, two distinct forms of chlorosis are to be\r\nrecognized, one form in which no great abnormalities of the reproductive\r\napparatus exist, and another form in which imperfections in the\r\ndevelopment of the central portion of the vascular system are associated\r\nwith similar imperfections in the reproductive apparatus. In many cases\r\nof chlorosis, he found the ovaries small and imperfectly developed, in\r\nan infantile condition; in other cases, however, they were three times\r\nthe normal size; the development of the uterus in such cases usually\r\ncorresponds with that of the reproductive glands. With regard to the\r\netiological connection between chlorosis and developmental disturbances,\r\n_Virchow_ inclines to the view, that in chlorosis a predisposition,\r\neither congenital or else acquired in early youth, must be assumed to\r\nexist, but that this does not manifest itself by the production of\r\nactual disorder until the arrival of puberty; and he considers it likely\r\nthat primary deficiencies of the blood and the vascular apparatus hinder\r\nthe development of the reproductive apparatus.\r\n\r\n_Stieda_ found that in chlorotics displacements of the uterus were\r\ncommon, with abnormal narrowness of the vagina, absence of the pubic\r\nhair, imperfect development of the pelvis, and the growth of the breasts\r\ninterfered with to this extent, that the nipples and areolæ were\r\nabnormally small. He classifies these manifestations as disturbances of\r\ndevelopment in the sense that they are among the so-called stigmata of\r\ndegeneration. If in chlorotics the breasts in certain cases have a\r\nnormally full and rounded appearance, this appearance is sometimes\r\ndeceptive, the fulness being due, not to a proper growth of the\r\nparenchymatous mammary tissue, but to an excessive deposit of fat.\r\nGenuine chlorosis, therefore, not referable to some other primary\r\ndisorder, is a developmental disorder, in the sense in which various\r\nother stigmata of degeneration met with in the human body are\r\ndevelopmental disorders, and is indeed frequently associated with other\r\nstigmata of degeneration, or with malformations due to arrest of\r\ndevelopment, as for instance, an infantile type of pelvis or of genital\r\norgans, abnormalities of the cranial bones, vaulted palate, the root of\r\nthe nose broad and depressed, extreme prognathism.\r\n\r\n_Hegar_ also maintains the view that chlorosis is in most cases a\r\ndevelopmental disturbance, the origin of which is not limited to the\r\nso-called years of puberty; it often arises from noxious influences\r\nwhich are either strictly inherited or began to operate when the infant\r\nwas still in her mother’s womb. _Frænkel_ is inclined to regard a\r\nprimary developmental disorder of the genital organs as the cause of\r\nmany cases of chlorosis.\r\n\r\nRecently, _Breuer_ and _Seiler_ have undertaken experiments on bitches,\r\nwhich they spayed at the outset of puberty, and from the results of\r\nthese experiments it seems probable that a disordered influence\r\nexercised by the ovaries on the blood plays a part, at least, in the\r\npathological mechanism by which chlorosis is induced.\r\n\r\nThe intimate relationship believed to exist between chlorosis and the\r\nsexual life of woman finds expression in the opinion, which dates back\r\nto the days of antiquity, and has been widely held even by physicians,\r\nthat the disease (hence designated _morbus virgineus_ or _febris\r\namatoria_) is due to sexual abstinence in individuals with powerful\r\nsexual impulse, and that for this reason chlorosis is often cured by\r\nmarriage. This result of marriage, which, though apparent merely, may\r\nindeed often be witnessed, is explained by _Kahane_ on the ground, that\r\nin very many cases, the symptoms of chlorosis become less severe after\r\nthe first five years have elapsed since the commencement of puberty, the\r\nimprovement occurring quite independently of the marriage or continued\r\ncelibacy of the sufferer. The influence of marriage in curing chlorosis\r\nis thus apparent merely to this extent, that a very common age for\r\nmarriage in women is precisely in the twentieth, twenty-first, or\r\ntwenty-second year, when five years have passed since menstruation\r\nbegan. By this time the organism will to a large extent have become\r\naccommodated to the demands made upon it by the processes of puberty.\r\nExperience also shows that chlorotic girls sometimes continue to suffer\r\nfrom the various symptoms of chlorosis even after they have become\r\nwives, and that chlorosis is not infrequently rendered more severe by\r\nthe puerperium—but in a wife it is no longer customary to describe such\r\nsymptoms by the name of chlorosis, they are called anæmia, hysteria,\r\nnervousness, etc. Further, in order to give the doctrine of morbus\r\nvirgineus its death-stroke, _Kahane_ directs attention to the fact that\r\nnumerous cases of chlorosis are met with in young girls who are far from\r\npracticing sexual abstinence, especially, for instance, amongst the\r\nlower classes, amongst whom it is hardly customary to wait for marriage\r\nbefore beginning sexual intercourse. The connection between masturbation\r\nand chlorosis, which has also been widely alleged from the etiological\r\nstandpoint, is moreover one that cannot be admitted. On the other hand\r\nit is easy to understand that the erotic reveries which are so often\r\nseen in chlorotic girls are very likely to induce the habit of\r\nmasturbation.\r\n\r\nIn young girls at the time of the menarche, especially in those who\r\nsuffer from amenorrhœa or from irregular menstruation, the anæmic form\r\nof obesity not infrequently develops. Such patients at the time of\r\npuberty exhibit signs of marked anæmia in association with a notable\r\nincrease in fat. The skin in such cases is always strikingly pale and of\r\na whitish-yellow color; in bodies which are in other respects beautiful\r\nthe bust may have the appearance of a marble statue. Such girls are\r\nstrikingly stout, but the fatty tissue is flaccid, soft, and spongy, and\r\ndependent parts readily become œdematous; the muscular system is\r\ngenerally feeble.\r\n\r\nWhat especially characterises this anæmic form of lipomatosis in young\r\ngirls is, that, even in mild forms of the affection, cardiac symptoms\r\nare apt to become prominent. Frequent and violent palpitation will occur\r\neven in the absence of any severe exertion or especial excitement, often\r\nalso we see shortness of breath, precordial pain, anxiety, respiratory\r\ndistress, and sensations of chilliness and fatigue.\r\n\r\nThe principal cause of the obesity in these cases is to be found in the\r\nanæmia, inasmuch as the diminution in the number of the erythrocytes is\r\na diminution in the number of the oxygen-carriers, and this entails\r\ndefective and insufficient oxidation. The deficiency in the albuminous\r\nconstituents of the body also gives rise to a rapid and extensive\r\ndeposit of fat, the power for the combustion of the fats absorbed from\r\nthe food being insufficient. An auxiliary factor in producing obesity in\r\nsuch anæmic girls is their disinclination to physical exercise,\r\ndependent on the speedy onset of sensations of fatigue. The\r\nlong-continued repose of the muscles, and the remaining almost\r\ncontinuously in close rooms insufficiently supplied with oxygen, also\r\nresult in the withdrawal from the blood of the circulating fat and its\r\ndeposit as adipose tissue.\r\n\r\nAlbuminuria at the time of the menarche is a disease of development\r\nwhich is not infrequently met with in chlorotic girls, as in adolescent\r\nboys. On examination of the urine in such young girls we detect the\r\npresence of a variable quantity of albumin, which is present especially\r\nafter severe physical exertion, mental application, or emotional\r\nexcitement, whilst the urine secreted at night is usually free from\r\nalbumin. The skin is pale, the accessible mucous surfaces are\r\ncomparatively colorless, the face is puffy, the eyelids are œdematous;\r\nthe patients suffer from various nervous troubles, especially headache\r\nand dizziness, and they are also liable to dyspeptic disorders.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this albuminuria of puberty is according to _von Leube_ in\r\npart disordered hæmatopoiesis, in part a slight degree of cardiac\r\ninsufficiency with a tendency to stasis. At the time when the processes\r\nof development and the growth of the body in height are most active,\r\nthere is not a corresponding increase in the energy of hæmatopoiesis,\r\nand the heart also fails to keep pace with the growth of the body and to\r\nmeet the demands thus made upon it by vigorous growth and increased\r\nenergy. In general the capacity of the heart in such individuals is\r\nindeed sufficient to maintain the circulation through the kidneys; but\r\nas soon as the functional activity of the heart is more strongly taxed\r\nand the energy of the circulation consequently declines, albuminuria\r\noccurs—and occurs all the more readily in consequence of the fact that,\r\nthe hæmoglobin-richness of the blood having been lowered by the\r\ncustomary anæmia, the epithelium of the renal glomeruli is badly\r\nnourished and functionally inadequate.\r\n\r\nWhen the period of the menarche is safely passed, when the menses recur\r\nwith regularity, and the chlorotic manifestations disappear, when the\r\nprocess of hæmatopoiesis has improved in quality, and the growth of the\r\nbody is completed—when, in short, the functional equilibrium of all the\r\nvital processes becomes re-established, the albuminuria of puberty\r\nceases. It seems, however, that those who have suffered in this way are\r\npredisposed to a return of the albuminuria at the climacteric period,\r\nwhen the metabolic balance is once more disturbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Cardiac Disorders._\r\n\r\nThe commonest cardiac disorder at this period of life is nervous\r\npalpitation, occurring in young girls who are in other respects in good\r\nhealth, being free from anæmia and from any discoverable disease of the\r\nheart or vessels. That this disorder is dependent on the sexual\r\nprocesses is indicated by the fact that it first manifests itself in a\r\nstormy manner some time, weeks it may be or months, before the first\r\nappearance of menstruation; recurring at irregular intervals, the\r\nattacks continue till after the first menstruation, and cease soon after\r\nthe regular return of the period. Objectively, the palpitation of the\r\nheart manifests itself by an increase in the frequency and strength of\r\nthe cardiac impulse, and increased frequency and tension of the pulse;\r\nin a few cases, however, it is perceived subjectively only by the\r\npatient, as a distressing sensation of excessively frequent and powerful\r\ncardiac action. In the former group of cases, the enhanced activity of\r\nthe heart is perceptible, not only by auscultation, by which we usually\r\nfind the heart-sounds quite pure, but also by inspection, which shows us\r\nthe violent agitation of the thoracic wall and increased pulsation of\r\nthe carotids. On percussion, no change is found in the area of cardiac\r\ndulness. The frequency of the pulse is increased, usually reaching 120\r\nto 140 beats per minute; it is full, and may be intermittent or\r\nirregular. In those cases in which the palpitation of the heart is a\r\npurely subjective sensation, we find no increase either in the frequency\r\nor in the strength of the pulse, which may indeed be less frequent than\r\nnormal. With the palpitation is associated a sensation of strong\r\npulsation in the great vessels of the neck, and often there is pain on\r\nthe left side of the lower part of the chest, with a sensation of\r\nshortness of breath, respiratory distress, precordial pain, and a\r\nfeeling of pressure upon the chest. Respiration is shallow, and\r\nabnormally frequent. The attacks of palpitation recur daily in some\r\npatients, in others at intervals of several days; they may occur\r\nentirely without exciting cause, or with a cause so trifling that it\r\nwould not in a normal subject have produced any nervous excitement; the\r\nduration of the attacks varies from a few minutes to several hours, and\r\nthey may occur either by day or by night; in the intervals between the\r\nattacks the functions of the heart and the arteries are conducted in a\r\nnormal manner. The pulse-curves I have obtained during the attacks of\r\npalpitation, in those cases in which the manifestations were objective\r\nas well as subjective, exhibit a high pulse-wave, the upstroke being\r\nrapid and steep, the downstroke also sudden and steep, the predicrotic\r\nelevation but little marked, the dicrotic elevation often very distinct.\r\n\r\nLess frequent than such attacks of palpitation recurring at irregular\r\nintervals are paroxysmal attacks of tachycardia, in which the frequency\r\nof the heart and pulse is increased to an enormous extent. This disorder\r\nmanifests itself a little time before the first appearance of\r\nmenstruation, thenceforward recurring regularly every three or four\r\nweeks, accompanying menstruation, or occurring at the proper menstrual\r\nperiod if menstruation is in abeyance; the attacks last several days.\r\nThis trouble also disappears a few months after the establishment of\r\nmenstruation.\r\n\r\nAssociated with these cardiac troubles are, not constantly indeed, but\r\nin the majority of cases, disturbances of the digestive organs.\r\n\r\nFrom the heart-troubles already described, another group of cases must\r\nbe distinguished, which are also observed at the time of the menarche.\r\nThey occur in girls in whom the first appearance of menstruation is\r\nstrikingly delayed, not having yet begun at the ages of 18, 19, or 20\r\nyears, or in whom considerable irregularities have occurred in\r\nconnection with the commencement of menstruation. In such girls, in whom\r\nmenstruation has appeared late and been irregular, or who are perhaps\r\nentirely amenorrhoeic, cardiac troubles may be so pronounced that the\r\nphysician may be led to suspect the presence of organic disease of the\r\nheart. The most prominent symptom is frequent and violent palpitation,\r\nwith strong pulsation in the carotids, respiratory distress, and feeling\r\nof anxiety, on continued exertion or even on very slight occasion. On\r\npercussion, the heart is not found to be enlarged; on auscultation, the\r\nheart-sounds are found to be very loud, often with a systolic murmur in\r\nthe mitral region, whilst over the lower end of the internal jugular\r\nvein, the humming-top murmur (_bruit de diable_) is audible. The pulse\r\nis increased in frequency, at times arhythmical, and easily\r\ncompressible. The sphygmographic tracing usually shows a subdicrotic or\r\ndicrotic character. The upstroke is not high; the downstroke descends\r\nlow, almost to the lowest level of the curve, before the enlarged\r\ndicrotic elevation begins. The skin is always strikingly pale, pale also\r\nare the visible mucous surfaces, the hæmoglobin-richness and the\r\ncorpuscular richness of the blood are considerably diminished, a feeling\r\nof fatigue and various other nervous manifestations are constantly\r\npresent—in short, in all cases we have to do with the well-known\r\nchlorotic disposition, sometimes in association with the manifestations\r\nof the anæmic form of lipomatosis universalis. In several such cases,\r\nskin affections were also present. Some suffered from acne vulgaris of\r\nthe face with the usual comedones; others perspired profusely from the\r\npalms of the hands and the soles of the feet; others exhibited a bluish\r\ncoloration of the nose and the ears.\r\n\r\nThere is yet a third form of heart trouble, much rarer indeed than the\r\nforms already described, from which young girls sometimes suffer at the\r\ntime of the menarche. It occurs in girls who just before the first\r\nappearance of menstruation have grown very rapidly, “shooting up to a\r\ngreat height.” They are not anæmic, nor do they appear “nervous;” but\r\nthey are extremely thin, and they have grown enormously in height during\r\nthe previous year. These individuals also, who in the previous course of\r\ntheir life have been free from heart trouble, now complain of cardiac\r\ndistress. As in the cases previously described, they complain of severe\r\npalpitation, a feeling of fulness in the chest, shortness of breath on\r\nexertion, etc.; but the results of the objective examination are very\r\ndifferent. The cardiac dulness is increased in area, especially in\r\nvertical extent, the apex-beat may be normal in position or displaced\r\noutwards, the impulse is always heaving, abnormally powerful and\r\nresistant, the heart-sounds, especially those of the left ventricle, are\r\nlouder than usual, the aortic second sound accentuated, sometimes\r\nringing, the carotids pulsate visibly. The radial pulse, the tension of\r\nwhich is abnormally high, can be compressed by the finger only with\r\ndifficulty; sometimes it is jerky in character. The sphygmographic\r\ntracing shows a rapid and steep upstroke; in the downstroke, the\r\npredicrotic elevation is much larger than normal and also nearer the\r\nsummit of the curve. Thus we see that all the signs of cardiac\r\nhypertrophy are present, hypertrophy, that is to say, of the left\r\nventricle.\r\n\r\nThe cases of this nature that have come under my observation have not\r\nbeen in girls of the working classes, but among the well-to-do. We\r\ncannot therefore regard them as due to overstrain of the heart in\r\nconsequence of excessive bodily exertions, comparable to the cases met\r\nwith in young recruits after long marches and violent exercise. We must\r\nrather assume that the development of the female genital organs has\r\nevoked a storm in the cardio-vascular system, more especially that in\r\nsome way an increased resistance has been offered to the work of the\r\nheart, and that thus the hypertrophy has been brought about; though we\r\nmay suppose that other unfavorable influences have also been in\r\noperation. Such an influence, in these cases, is the rapid growth of the\r\nbody, which makes enhanced demands on the work of the heart; another is\r\nfurnished by the almost universally worn unhygienic article of clothing,\r\nthe cuirass-like corset, which offers a rigid hindrance to the rapid\r\ngrowth of the female body, to the development of the breasts, the\r\nthorax, and the upper abdominal organs, and which fails to accommodate\r\nitself to the changing conditions of growth, so that much extra work is\r\nthrown upon the heart. In such young girls we have very frequently found\r\ntight stays, which were worn unchanged without regard to the growth of\r\nthe body in length, and which, by pressure on the epigastric region,\r\nelevation of the diaphragm, and limitation of the respiratory movements\r\nof the thorax, actually offered such considerable resistances to the\r\ndriving power of the heart, as ultimately to lead to hypertrophy of the\r\ncardiac muscle.\r\n\r\nSumming up our observations, we find that at the time of the menarche\r\ncardiac disorders occur in young girls which may be arranged in three\r\ngroups of cases:\r\n\r\n1. Nervous palpitation and paroxysmal tachycardia in persons in other\r\nrespects in good health, the affection appearing shortly before the\r\ncommencement of menstruation, and disappearing soon after the flow is\r\nregularly established.\r\n\r\n2. Cardiac disorders occurring in young girls suffering from chlorosis,\r\nwhich itself results from the processes of the menarche.\r\n\r\n3. Cardiac hypertrophy developing at the time of the menarche, and\r\ndependent on the circulatory disturbances associated with that process,\r\nits appearance being favored also by rapid growth of the girl and by\r\nunsuitable clothing (tight lacing).\r\n\r\nWith respect to the activity of the heart and the circulation of the\r\nblood at the time of the menarche, the little-known observations made by\r\nBeneke, on the growth of the heart and arteries in the various stages of\r\ndevelopment, deserve especial attention. According to this writer, the\r\ngrowth of the heart is slow until the age of fifteen years is attained,\r\nbut becomes accelerated at the commencement of puberty. During this time\r\nof puberty, the blood-pressure attains its highest level, being\r\ncomparatively low in childhood and later in life. The development at\r\npuberty of the female heart is less extensive than that of the male\r\nheart, and for this reason throughout adult life the capacity of a\r\nwoman’s heart is on the average 25 to 30 cubic centimeters (1.5 to 1.8\r\ncubic inches) less than that of a man. In women, also, the great\r\narteries are on the average somewhat smaller than in men. The various\r\narteries do not develop with equal rapidity throughout the period of\r\ngrowth; after puberty the common carotid grows very much more slowly\r\nthan the common iliac artery, the former vessel being the only large\r\ntrunk which has already nearly reached its maximum size at puberty.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively great development which the heart undergoes at the\r\ntime of puberty is a phenomenon so important alike in its physiological\r\nand its pathological relations that it deserves the special designation\r\nof the _puberal development of the heart_; the commencement and the\r\ncompletion of puberty appear beyond question to be to a large extent\r\ndependent upon this development of the heart and upon the simultaneous\r\nrise in the blood-pressure of the systemic circulation due to the\r\ncomparative diminution in the calibre of the arteries.\r\n\r\nIn the literature of this subject of cardiac disorders during the\r\nmenarche, we find only short annotations on palpitation of the heart in\r\nyoung adolescent girls, and on cardiac manifestations in chlorotic\r\nsubjects. Further, the statistical fact that valvular lesions of the\r\nheart are commoner in women than in men is by many authors explained on\r\nthe ground that the disturbances of the time of puberty, which certainly\r\noccur more frequently and are more severe in the female sex than in the\r\nmale, play an important part in their causation. Changes also in the\r\nvessel, such as cirsoid aneurysm (_angioma arteriale racemosum_), are\r\nsupposed to be connected with the sexual processes of this period of\r\nlife. _C. Heine_ maintains that in consequence of puberty and of the\r\nsexual functions that become established at this period, a\r\ntelangiectases will not infrequently undergo transformation into a\r\ncirsoid aneurysm; especially in cases in which menstruation is scanty\r\nand irregular, angiectatic tumors may exhibit a vicarious periodic\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n_Krieger_ describes nervous palpitation and also “cramps of the\r\nheart”[22] as occurring in girls who have not yet begun to menstruate,\r\nin the form of prodromal manifestations; similar attacks may occur also\r\nat every menstrual period in girls in whom menstruation is fully\r\nestablished. In most of these cases the pulse is increased in the\r\npatients who complain of a sensation of anxiety, and speak of feeling\r\nthe heart roll, tremble, or flutter, to which is sometimes superadded a\r\nsensation of sudden cessation in its activity. Not infrequently there is\r\na blowing adventitious sound, masking or accompanying the heart-sounds;\r\nthere are also venous murmurs, especially when the heart-trouble is\r\nassociated with anæmia or chlorosis. Of the cases of pseudo-angina\r\npectoris[22] observed by _Krieger_, the attacks occurred as prodromal\r\nmanifestations before the first appearance of menstruation in 22 per\r\ncent. of the cases, after menstruation was fully established in 78 per\r\ncent. of the cases; as regards the relation of the attacks, in cases of\r\nthe latter group, to the menstrual period, they occurred before the flow\r\nin 33 per cent., during the flow in 67 per cent.; menstruation was\r\nirregular in 10 per cent. of the cases under observation, in most of the\r\nother cases menstruation had been irregular, but was now regular.\r\n\r\n_Hennig_ records a case in which he observed as a prodromal symptom\r\nbefore the establishment of menstruation the regular recurrence of\r\ncongestion of the pelvic organs associated with cardiac disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Diseases of the Nervous System._\r\n\r\nThe extensive transformatory processes occurring in the genital organs\r\nof young girls at the time of the menarche, and the powerful impression\r\nwhich the new thoughts, hopes, and fears excited at this period of life\r\ncannot fail to exercise on the nervous and emotional life, will enable\r\nus to understand how it is that the appearance of the first menstruation\r\nmay give rise, especially in neurasthenic or psychopathic subjects, to\r\nmanifold nervous disturbances and also to disorders of the mind.\r\n\r\nAmongst the severe neuroses and psychoses liable to occur at the\r\nmenarche in those suffering from congenital nervous weakness, in those\r\nthe conditions of whose life are very unfavorable, and in those affected\r\nby some sudden disagreeable and powerful influences, we may enumerate:\r\nHemicrania, precordial pain, hysteria, and epilepsy; impulsive\r\nmanifestations, such as bulimia, longings for various unsuitable things,\r\nkleptomania, and pyromania; severe feelings of anxiety; various forms of\r\npsychoses.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the first appearance of menstruation has sometimes a\r\nfavorable influence in girls suffering from nervous or mental disorder.\r\nThis is seen, for example, in cases of chorea in fully developed,\r\nrapidly growing girls who have not yet begun to menstruate; in such\r\nsubjects the chorea sometimes disappears as soon as menstruation is\r\nregularly established.\r\n\r\nQuite frequently, the first appearance of hemicrania in young girls\r\ncoincides with the menarche. According to _Warner_, hemicrania made its\r\nfirst appearance:\r\n\r\n                     In  1 girl  of  3 to  4 years.\r\n                     In  2 girls of  5 to  6 years.\r\n                     In  1 girl  of  6 to  7 years.\r\n                     In  5 girls of  8 to  9 years.\r\n                     In  5 girls of  9 to 10 years.\r\n                     In  4 girls of 10 to 11 years.\r\n                     In  2 girls of 11 to 12 years.\r\n                     In  4 girls of 12 to 13 years.\r\n                     In 15 girls of 13 to 15 years.\r\n\r\nToothache, according to _Holländer_, in the early days of puberty\r\nsometimes exhibits the twenty-eight-day type of menstruation. The same\r\nperiodicity has been recorded in cases of vicarious bleeding from the\r\ngums in girls suffering from disturbance of the menstrual function.\r\n\r\nIn the period of the menarche and before this period, chorea minor\r\noccurs, as a functional disturbance of the motor region of the nervous\r\nsystem, and especially in girls is it associated with the processes of\r\nthe period of physical development. The statistical data supplied by a\r\nnumber of authors, _Hughes_, _Pye-Smith_, _Russ_, _Sée_, and _Steiner_,\r\nshow that the proportion of boys to girls affected with chorea minor is\r\n1 to 2.8, and that of all ages 49 per cent. of the cases occurred at the\r\nages of 6 to 11 years, 29.8 per cent. at the ages of 11 to 13 years. In\r\nseveral cases, in quite young girls suffering from chorea, pathological\r\nchanges were found in the genital organs. Thus, in 24 out of 27 girls\r\nfrom the age of 9 to 15 years affected with chorea, _Marie_ found the\r\nsymptom-complex designated by _Charcot_ as _ovarie_. Ovarian tenderness\r\nwas manifested on palpation, and always on that side on which the chorea\r\nhad first manifested itself. _Leonard_ found in a girl aged eleven\r\nsuffering from chorea, adhesion of the præputium clitoridis; after the\r\nseparation of the prepuce, the chorea disappeared.\r\n\r\nAs in respect of various nervous affections, so also in respect of\r\nvarious mental abnormalities, we witness at the time of the menarche\r\nnumerous manifestations confirming the statement that, “no spinal reflex\r\nhas such widely-opened and easily accessible paths of conduction toward\r\nthe organ of mind, as the sexual reflex.” “The menstrual process,”\r\ncontinues _Friedmann_, “is the only bodily process in relation to which\r\nthe organ of mind somewhat readily loses the remarkable stability of its\r\nequilibrium.”\r\n\r\nIn the experience of all alienists, it is, speaking generally, the\r\ninherited psychopathic tendency that especially manifests itself at\r\nthe time of puberty; and it appears that this predisposition, the\r\nmanifestations of which the resisting powers of childhood have\r\nhitherto been competent to suppress, undergoes a sudden and stormy\r\ndevelopment in consequence of the action of the menstrual stimulus,\r\nleading to the unexpected appearance of mental disorders. The\r\ncommonest of these are mania and melancholia of the ordinary type, the\r\nprognosis in first attacks being favorable; next in frequency to these\r\nare the psychoses characterized by fixed ideas, which usually\r\nterminate favorably after a short time; finally, we meet with the\r\nmoral psychoses of puberty, and the form of melancholia distinguished\r\nby _Kahlbaum_ as _Hebephrenie_,[23] the prognosis of which is very\r\nunfavorable, for it speedily terminates in dementia, similarly to the\r\ndementia of puberty described by _Svetlin_, dependent upon or\r\nassociated with premature synostosis of the cranial bones. Very often\r\nwe witness at puberty the beginning of the periodic varieties of\r\nmental disorder, which develop into periodic menstrual psychoses,\r\nmanifesting themselves regularly at the recurrence of every menstrual\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe fact that hysteria often first manifests itself at the time of the\r\nfirst appearance of menstruation was noticed already by _Hippocrates_,\r\nwho indeed believed that the association was sufficiently explained by\r\nthe well-known manifold relations between this nervous disease and\r\ndisturbances in the female genital organs. The first hysterical attack\r\noften coincides with the first menstruation; or the first menstruation\r\nmay lead to the recrudescence of hysteria which had manifested itself\r\npreviously, but had passed into abeyance. We have to deal chiefly with\r\nthe minor forms, such as uncontrollable and unconditioned attacks of\r\nlaughing and crying, globus hystericus, clavus hystericus, etc.;\r\nhysteria major, on the other hand, is very seldom observed at the time\r\nof the menarche. As regards the frequency of hysteria at the time of\r\npuberty, we append certain statistical data.\r\n\r\n_Landouzy_ found:\r\n\r\n       4 cases of hysteria occurring at the ages of  1 to 10 years.\r\n      45 cases of hysteria occurring at the ages of 10 to 15 years.\r\n     105 cases of hysteria occurring at the ages of 15 to 20 years.\r\n      80 cases of hysteria occurring at the ages of 20 to 25 years.\r\n\r\nAfter the age of twenty-five is attained, the frequency of hysteria\r\ndeclines very rapidly.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Bernutz_, all the statistical data prove that hysteria in\r\nmore than half the cases first manifests itself either just before or\r\nsimultaneously with the commencement of menstruation. It seems also that\r\nat the time of puberty amenorrhoeic and dysmenorrhœic manifestations may\r\ngive rise to the development of hysteria. In girls at this time of life,\r\nhysteria seldom takes the form of the great hystero-epileptic crisis,\r\nmanifesting itself rather as nervous and moody states of mind, moral\r\nchanges, weakness of will, in association with various forms of\r\nanæsthesia, spasm, and paralysis.\r\n\r\nOn the threshold of puberty the girl with a hereditarily neuropathic\r\ndisposition may exhibit a tendency to epilepsy. In such cases, as\r\n_Kowalewski_ writes, the patient has sudden attacks of loss of\r\nconsciousness, commonly ushered in by a wild scream; during the attacks,\r\ntonic and clonic muscular spasms occur, the patient is completely\r\ninsensible, the pupils are dilated and do not react to light, the\r\npulse-frequency is increased—in short, the typical phenomena of an\r\nepileptic fit are exhibited. The loss of consciousness lasts from two to\r\nthree minutes; and when the girl recovers, she remembers nothing of what\r\nhas occurred during the fit. Though consciousness has returned, the mind\r\nis still at first somewhat disordered; but this disorder soon passes\r\noff, the girl becomes calm, and forgets what has happened. The physician\r\nis summoned, but in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, he assures the\r\nrelatives that “the attack is nothing of any consequence—a simple\r\nfainting-fit, the result of menstruation—a transient trouble merely.” A\r\nsecond “fainting-fit” disturbs the calm of the parents, but the\r\nreiterated authoritative assurance of the physician that “the trouble\r\nwill soon pass away” restores their confidence; and they gradually\r\nbecome accustomed to the “fainting-fits” from which their daughter\r\nsuffers at each successive menstrual period. The daughter marries, and\r\ngives birth to neuropathic and psychopathic children, and every one\r\nwonders what can be the cause of this misfortune. Hence it is necessary\r\nto pay careful attention to these “fainting-fits during menstruation.”\r\nIn the great majority of cases they are in fact epileptic seizures, and\r\nas such they must be treated. _Binswanger_ points out that in such\r\ncases, in which epilepsy first appears at the commencement of\r\nmenstruation, the attacks may continue to accompany menstruation for\r\nseveral years thenceforward. Already established epilepsy is said by\r\nsome authors, _Lawson Tait_, _Tissot_, and _Marotte_, for instance, to\r\nundergo at puberty in young girls an increase both in the severity and\r\nin the frequency of the attack; _Esquirol_, on the contrary, attributes\r\nto puberty a favorable influence on the course of epilepsy, a view held\r\nalready by _Hippocrates_.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently, attacks of precordial pain associated with tachycardia\r\noccur during the first menstruation. These attacks are usually of short\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nAcromegaly, a disease regarded as a trophoneurosis, also requires\r\nmention here, this disturbance of growth being considered by several\r\nauthors, and especially by _W. Freund_, to be in some way connected with\r\nthe development of puberty; the tendency to acromegaly, it is suggested,\r\nis produced by the remarkable transmigration that occurs at puberty of\r\nthe energy of growth from its accustomed paths into new channels. The\r\nrelations which _Neusser_ has shown to exist between the ovaries on the\r\none hand and the vegetative nervous system and the process of\r\nhæmatopoiesis on the other, give a certain amount of support to this\r\nhypothesis, even though we have no intimate knowledge of disturbances\r\noccurring in the reproductive system during the period of development,\r\nwhich might have an influence in the causation of acromegaly.\r\n\r\nOf old and of recent observations on the psychoses connected with the\r\nmenarche, there is no lack. From the time of _Hippocrates_ down to the\r\npresent day, the authorities have continued to report cases in which the\r\ncommencement of menstruation proved the exciting cause of the appearance\r\nof psychoses. _Rousseau_ writes of a girl at the time of the menarche,\r\nwho before the first appearance of menstruation suffered from attacks of\r\nmelancholia and a tendency to pyromania, and under the influence of the\r\nlatter tendency she twice committed acts of incendiarism.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Kirn_, the psychoses that manifest themselves in the first\r\nperiod of the commencement of menstruation, sometimes melancholia,\r\nsometimes amentia in the form of slight and transitory maniacal\r\nderangement, more rarely a katatonic[24] condition, may precede the\r\nmenarche, or may accompany or follow it.\r\n\r\nA special form of psychosis is associated with the menarche (_von\r\nKrafft-Ebing_, _Griesinger_, _Friedmann_, _Schönthal_). The influence\r\nexercised by puberty in this direction manifests itself in various ways,\r\nand is the more powerful for the reason that several factors are in\r\noperation, each of which exercises an individual influence upon the type\r\nof the psychical affection; these factors are, childhood, the\r\ndevelopment of puberty, and the periodicity of the disturbance exercised\r\nby the menstrual reflex. The last named of these influences is the most\r\npotent. It manifests itself in the following manner: Certain psychoses\r\nwhich develop before the commencement of menstruation or during the\r\nsuppression of the flow, undergo modification when menstruation appears;\r\nfurther, in the typical menstrual psychoses of psychopathically\r\npredisposed girls, the attacks recur either at the beginning of each\r\nperiod, or, when the flow is in abeyance, at the dates when it should\r\nappear—the menstrual stimulus thus being the exciting cause of the\r\nsuccessive attacks in an organ of mind whose resisting powers are\r\ndeficient; and, finally a disturbance in the development of menstruation\r\nmay be, not merely the exciting cause, but the efficient cause of the\r\npsychosis.\r\n\r\nIn cases of the last kind, which have been observed by _Schönthal_ and\r\nalso by _Friedmann_, who has described them very fully under the name of\r\nprimordial menstrual psychosis, we have to do with young girls in whom\r\nthe appearance of menstruation is retarded, or in whom the flow has been\r\nsuppressed very soon after its commencement. The girls were as a rule\r\nhereditarily well endowed, and the psychosis thus appeared without\r\nwarning, like a storm from a clear sky. Exactly periodical in form and\r\ncharacter, the period of recurrence being three or four weeks, this\r\npsychosis clearly showed its dependence upon menstruation; the\r\nindividual attacks usually lasted a few days only, and were\r\ncharacterized by distinct mental disorder, in the form either of\r\nmaniacal restlessness, or of dominant depression; vasomotor disturbances\r\nwere very prominent, with disordered pulse, as for instance, a rapid\r\nrise in the pulse-wave just before the onset of the attack, succeeded\r\nduring the attack by a correspondingly rapid decline.\r\n\r\n_Friedmann_ enumerates a number of the peculiarities that characterize\r\nthese attacks. The general course of the malady is an exceptionally\r\nstormy one. The ultimate cure may coincide with the definite\r\nregularization of menstruation; or, in cases in which menstruation is\r\nrestored but remains inadequate, the course of the disorder may become a\r\ngentle undulatory one, the violent stimulus of total suppression being\r\nreplaced by a more moderate stimulus—here also, however, a cure\r\nultimately follows when menstruation at length becomes free as well as\r\nregular. But during the height of the malady a proper development of\r\nmenstruation is always wanting. The total duration of the malady may\r\nvary from as little as two to as long as nine months, or even longer.\r\nThe cure is, however, ultimately a complete one. The combination of a\r\ndisturbed and delayed development of menstruation with a stormy periodic\r\ncycle of attacks of mental disorder, and the ultimately favorable\r\ntermination, constitute according to _Friedmann_ the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of this form of puberal psychosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Masturbation._\r\n\r\nMasturbation is sometimes practised in very early childhood, being then\r\ncommonly due to local irritation of some kind, as for instance when\r\nthreadworms find their way into the vagina. Itching results, leading the\r\nchild to rub the genital organs. This rubbing produces a pleasurable\r\nsensation, and gives rise to repeated masturbation. But in adolescent\r\ngirls at the time of the menarche, a vague impulse arises to handle the\r\ngenital organs, depending upon cerebral processes which are themselves\r\nthe result of sexual sentiments, of reading, or of conversations with\r\nsexually instructed female friends. This vague impulse may lead to\r\nmasturbation, and will do so earlier and more surely if the girl is a\r\nneuropsychopath by inheritance. The local influence of menstrual\r\ncongestion, however, also plays a part in provoking the impulse toward\r\nmasturbation, since at every period a hyperæsthetic state recurs in the\r\ngenital organs.\r\n\r\nGirls thus addicted have sometimes a very striking general appearance.\r\nThey are pale, with a weary expression of countenance, their eyes are\r\ndull-looking and darkly ringed, their movements are sluggish, they like\r\nto spend a long time in bed—signs, however, which I by no means wish to\r\nadduce as characteristic of onanists.\r\n\r\nTemperament and mode of life are decisive in determining the greater or\r\nless frequency of the habit of masturbation in young girls. Girls of a\r\npassionate temperament, those also who from early childhood have been\r\naccustomed to mix much with young persons of the opposite sex, and\r\nthose, finally, in whom from conversation on the subject with female\r\nfriends or from the perusal of erotic literature, sexual enlightenment\r\nhas occurred at an early age, experience the awakening of the sexual\r\nimpulse earlier and with greater force, than phlegmatic girls, than\r\nthose who have grown up apart from boys, and than those who have been\r\nstrictly and carefully brought up. Masturbation may arise either\r\ninstinctively or from instruction.\r\n\r\nIn young girls masturbation is usually effected by friction of the\r\nclitoris; less often by intra-vaginal manipulation, since this is liable\r\nto lead to injury to the hymen. For the former purpose the finger may be\r\nused; or some other article, such as a knot tied in the nightgown, or a\r\nrounded projection on some article of furniture; in one case the\r\nfriction was effected by the naked heel. If two female onanists come\r\ntogether, they practice tribadism, presently to be described.\r\nOpportunity for this practice occurs especially in institutions in which\r\nyoung girls occupy a common dormitory, and sleep together without adult\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nAn experienced physician, _Gutceit_, is of opinion that in young girls\r\nof 10 to 16 years of age masturbation is on the whole less common than\r\nin boys of the same age, but that on the other hand from the ages of 18,\r\n19, and 20 onward, “sexual self-gratification is almost universally\r\npracticed by women, even if it be not always practiced to excess,” an\r\nopinion which cannot, however, be regarded as conclusive. As\r\nconsequences of masturbation in the female sex, this author has\r\nobserved: Fluor albus, menorrhagia, enlargement and prolapse of the\r\nuterus, pains in one or other ovary, hysterical paroxysms, great pallor.\r\n\r\n_L. Löwenfeld_ remarks that the manifestations of the sexual impulse are\r\nnot normally present in the days of childhood. In consequence of\r\npathological conditions, especially of such as effect the genital\r\norgans, in consequence of chance impressions, or in consequence of a bad\r\nexample, sexual passion may indeed be awakened in children in its\r\nfullest intensity. Normally, however, the distinct manifestation of the\r\nsexual impulse is associated with a certain degree of development, of\r\nripeness, of the reproductive organs. Physiologically, sexual passion is\r\nentirely wanting in young girls before the age of puberty.\r\n\r\nAs regards the act of sexual self-gratification, this author\r\ndistinguishes two forms of masturbation: (a) Peripheral-mechanical; (b)\r\nmental (psychical onanism). In the former class of cases, the sexual\r\norgasm is produced solely or chiefly by mechanical stimulation of the\r\nskin or mucous membrane of the genital organs. In the female sex, in\r\naddition to manual stimulation, an extraordinary variety of hard and\r\nsoft articles are introduced into the vagina for this purpose. Many\r\nfemales effect sexual self-gratification by rubbing and pressing\r\nmovements of the thighs one against the other, in which the clitoris is\r\nimplicated. In psychical onanism, on the contrary, as _Löwenfeld_ points\r\nout, the orgasm is produced solely by central stimulatory\r\nrepresentations, without the assistance of any manipulation of the\r\ngenital organs. The ideas that have this effect are for the most part\r\nlascivious trains of thought or the recollection of previous sexual\r\nexperiences, on which the attention is concentrated. If we wish to\r\nestimate the harmfulness of the different forms of masturbation as\r\nregards the mind and the nervous system, psychical onanism must\r\nincontestably be regarded as the most deleterious.\r\n\r\nIn the female sex onanism is, in _Löwenfeld’s_ opinion, less widely\r\npracticed than in the male; none the less, it is in the former sex far\r\ncommoner than is generally believed, a fact on which _Eulenburg_\r\nlikewise insists. Frequently, also, in females, a congenital neuropathic\r\ntendency plays a part in the causation of masturbation, in so far as\r\nthis tendency takes the form of premature sexual excitement or of\r\nexcessive intensity of the sexual impulse. In the absence of this\r\ntendency, masturbation rarely leads to the production of well-marked\r\nnervous disturbances, and does so only when practiced to very great\r\nexcess. _Beard_ reports that in the powerful and full-blooded\r\nworking-class girls of the Irish race, masturbation, even when practiced\r\nfor many years, did not result in any notable disorder to health.\r\n\r\nAs regards the nature of the nervous manifestations met with in women as\r\na result of masturbation, there develops, according to _Löwenfeld_, in\r\none group of the cases, the sexual form of myelasthenia, characterized\r\nprincipally by sacrache and lumbago, hyperæsthesia and paræsthesia in\r\nthe domain of the genital organs (ovarie,[25] pruritus vulvæ et vaginæ,\r\netc.), irritable bladder, coccygodynia, weakness and paræsthesia of the\r\nlegs (feelings of fatigue and chilliness), finally, the onset of erotic\r\ndreams. In many cases, in the course of time, to these symptoms are\r\nsuperadded the manifestations of cerebral and visceral neurasthenia\r\n(headache, insomnia, nervous dyspepsia, palpitation), so that the\r\nclinical picture comes to be one of general neurasthenia. In addition to\r\nthe neurasthenic troubles, manifold hysterical manifestations may occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Disorders of Digestion._\r\n\r\nDisorders of the digestive apparatus are quite common in girls during\r\nthe period of puberty, and usually take the form of nervous dyspepsia.\r\nDisturbances of sensibility predominate, with a sensation of pressure\r\nafter meals, sometimes increasing to nausea, retching, and vomiting, as\r\nmanifestations of general hyperæsthesia of the gastric mucous membrane,\r\nloss of appetite, a pasty or acid disagreeable taste, sometimes bulimia,\r\nperverse sensations of taste, and pyrosis. Especially in chlorotic\r\ngirls, periodic attacks of pain occur, localized in the epigastrium and\r\nits neighbourhood, and exhibiting no relation to the ingestion of food.\r\nThe free hydrochloric acid varies in amount, being now normal, now\r\ndiminished, sometimes also increased. In chlorotic cases, the symptoms\r\nof round ulcer of the stomach are sometimes observed. Intestinal\r\nactivity is usually depressed, peristalsis is diminished, so that more\r\nor less obstinate constipation is one of the most frequent symptoms.\r\n\r\nHypertrophy of the tonsils at the time of puberty is in some way related\r\nto the menstrual processes, whether by the intermediation of the nervous\r\nsystem or by that of the blood. _Eisenhart_ quotes observations made by\r\n_Chassaignac_, of girls eighteen or nineteen years of age with\r\nhypertrophy of the tonsils, associated with retarded puberty,\r\nmenstruation having begun late and being scanty, and the breasts being\r\nunderdeveloped; in one young girl with tonsillar hypertrophy, one of the\r\nbreasts had failed to develop properly, but after the removal of the\r\ntonsils it speedily grew to the normal size.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Diseases of the Respiratory Organs._[26]\r\n\r\nNot uncommonly at this period of life the growth of a goitre is\r\nobserved. The influence of puberty on the growth of the thyroid body has\r\nindeed been asserted by several authors; and _Neudörfer_ maintains that\r\nprecisely during the period of puberty to this body must be assigned an\r\nimportant regulatory trophic significance for the nourishment and growth\r\nof the reproductive organs. _Steinberger_ and _Sloan_ record the\r\nobservation of cases occurring in young girls in whom, menstruation\r\nhaving first been regular, but having been suddenly suppressed in\r\nconsequence of external noxious influences, a rapidly growing goitre\r\nsuddenly appeared.\r\n\r\n_P. Müller_ states that in many regions, as for instance in Canton Berne\r\nin Switzerland, where the school children exhibit with extraordinary\r\nfrequency a hereditary tendency to the formation of goitre, during the\r\nyears of childhood these growths are much less frequent in girls than in\r\nboys. At the time of puberty, however, this relation is entirely\r\nchanged. Whereas in boys from this time onward no further growth of the\r\nthyroid body is observed, in girls at puberty the hypertrophy greatly\r\nincreases, so that very large goitres are formed. The same author recurs\r\nto the earlier observations of _Heidenreich_ and _Schönlein_, as well as\r\nto those of _Friedreich_, by which this influence of puberty is\r\nstrikingly manifested, and he believes it to be established by\r\nexperience that sexual excitement can produce a transient swelling of\r\nthe thyroid body. He alludes also to the remarkable fact that a swelling\r\nof the thyroid body, to which a number of animals show a tendency,\r\noccurs chiefly at the time of heat or rut; this is especially well known\r\nto occur in the case of stags. Similarly, during menstruation, a\r\ntransient swelling of the thyroid body can sometimes be detected; the\r\nswelling is greater if the menstrual discharge fails to occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Diseases of the Organs of the Senses._\r\n\r\nAt the time of the menarche in cases in which there is retardation or\r\nsome other disturbance in the regular appearance of menstruation,\r\naffections of the eye are observed, which are in part functional,\r\ndependent on reflex influences proceeding directly from the genital\r\norgans without organic changes, and in part are due to circulatory\r\ndisturbances. _Mooren_, _S. Cohn_, and _Power_ have discussed the\r\nrelations between the uterus and the eyes in general, and also in this\r\nespecial connection. Of ocular troubles during the menarche,\r\niridochoroiditis, hæmorrhages into the vitreous body, long-continued\r\nblindness, and pannous keratitis, are mentioned, which may either\r\ndisappear with the reestablishment of menstruation (spontaneous or\r\nartificially effected), or may exhibit in such circumstances a notable\r\nalleviation. Chronic inflammatory states of the conjunctiva, usually of\r\nan eczematous nature, which frequently occur at the time of puberty,\r\noften exhibit a relation to the menstrual process, a monthly\r\nexacerbation of the ocular trouble coinciding with disordered\r\nmenstruation, and cure taking place only when menstruation has become\r\nperfectly regular. Vicarious hæmorrhages into the vitreous body also\r\noccur, associated with disturbances of menstruation, the relapses\r\nceasing as soon as menstruation becomes regular; such a case was\r\nobserved by _Courserants_ in a girl of fourteen years.\r\n\r\nDisturbances of hearing have been observed at the time of puberty in\r\nyoung girls addicted to masturbation; the patients complain of\r\nsubjective noises, rising in intensity till actual hallucinations may be\r\nexperienced. _Lichtenberg_ reports the case of a strong girl eighteen\r\nyears of age, in whom the congestion associated with puberty was\r\nfollowed by atrophy of the auditory nerve. The same author, also\r\n_Ashwell_, _Law_, _Puech_, _Rossi_, _Stepanow_, and _Gilles de la\r\nTourette_, have published cases of vicarious menstrual hæmorrhage from\r\nthe external auditory meatus, occurring in girls of ages varying from 14\r\nto 16, 17, 20, and 22 years. Amongst these cases, in some the auditory\r\norgan was in a healthy condition, but in others there was associated\r\npurulent discharge; the bleeding took place from the ears at the\r\nmenstrual periods, the proper menstrual discharge being absent or\r\nscanty; after the ear trouble was cured, menstruation was normal. Of 200\r\ncases of vicarious menstruation, there were, according to _Puech_, six\r\nin which the vicarious bleeding was from the ears.\r\n\r\nDisturbances of the olfactory sense, taking the form, sometimes of\r\ndiminished acuteness of this sense, sometimes of increased acuteness,\r\nand sometimes of perversion, also anomalies in the secretion of the\r\nnasal mucous membrane, either abnormal dryness, or greatly increased\r\nsecretion of mucus, come under observation at this period of life,\r\neither as reflex manifestations through the intermediation of vasomotor\r\nnerves at the time of the first appearance of menstruation, or in\r\nconsequence of chronic nasal catarrh, which may be connected with\r\nmasturbation. In cases in which the menarche is retarded, vicarious\r\nepistaxis may also occur, the bleeding sometimes being very profuse, in\r\none case, indeed, reported by _Fricke_, in a girl seventeen years of\r\nage, having a fatal termination. According to _Mackenzie_, sexual\r\nexcitement leads to swelling of the nasal mucous membrane, and habitual\r\nmasturbation to chronic nasal catarrh; the same author asserts that\r\nduring menstruation, swelling of the turbinate bodies may always be\r\nobserved, and that in this lies the explanation of the fact that many\r\nwomen complain of a monthly cold in the head as an accompaniment of\r\nmenstruation.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the skin are not uncommon in young girls at the time of the\r\nmenarche, and later as an accompaniment of each successive menstruation.\r\nIt is a well-known fact that at puberty girls sometimes lose a hitherto\r\nbeautiful complexion, and suffer from various disfigurements of the skin\r\nof the face. These are produced especially by the profuse secretion of\r\nsweat, and by the excessive secretion of the sebaceous glands, which so\r\noften results in acne, an inflammation of these glands. Ecchymoses also,\r\neffusions of blood into the skin, are observed, especially, as a form of\r\nvicarious menstruation, in cases in which menstruation is irregular.\r\nWhen actual bleeding occurs from the intact skin, the blood finds its\r\nway out through the sudoriferous ducts—hæmatidrosis occurs; in some\r\ncases, however, the hæmorrhage takes place from areas of skin altered\r\nand injured by disease, from wounds or other injuries, from ulcers, or\r\nfrom excrescences. Hæmorrhage into the skin occurs also in the so-called\r\nstigmatization, in which condition also an etiological role has been\r\nassigned to menstruation.\r\n\r\nIn the skin, remark _Spietschka_ and _Grünfeld_, a new life begins at\r\nthe time of the development of puberty, and it is this which first gives\r\nto human beings the external characteristics of sexual maturity. In\r\ncertain regions which have hitherto been covered only by fine downy\r\nhairs,[27] thick, strong hairs develop, and at the same time the general\r\ngrowth of hair becomes more active. These regions are, the genital\r\nregion, and the axillæ. This increased growth of hair is accompanied by\r\na stronger secretion of the sebaceous glands, which very often is in\r\nexcess of actual requirements, and may thus lead to cosmetic\r\ndisturbances and to various diseases of the skin. Thus arise the various\r\nforms of seborrhœa.[28] The commonest of these is the formation of\r\ncomedones, which, at the time of puberty, may make their appearance\r\nespecially on the nose, the forehead, and below the corners of the\r\nmouth, but also on other parts of the face or on the back and the\r\nbreast; in those regions, that is to say, in which the sebaceous glands\r\nattain a considerable size. The retention of the sebum may give rise to\r\ninflammation, which the access of micro-organisms converts into\r\nsuppuration. Thus arises acne vulgaris. In another form of\r\nseborrhœa,[28] the secretion is more fluid in consistence, and collects\r\non the surface of the skin, furnishing this with an oily\r\ncovering—seborrhœa oleosa.[28] This most commonly occurs on the face; if\r\nthe fatty layer is removed, the skin remains dry for a brief period\r\nonly, and soon becomes greasy and shiny once more. Dust readily adheres\r\nto the greasy surface, and this gives the face a dirty appearance.\r\nSeborrhœa faciei is readily converted into eczema.\r\n\r\nWith the puberal development of the external genital organs is\r\nassociated an increase in the sebaceous secretion of these regions. On\r\nthe clitoris and its prepuce, and on the folds and in the furrows of the\r\nvulva, in consequence of insufficient cleanliness, an accumulation of\r\nsebum and cast-off epidermic scales readily occurs; such an accumulation\r\nmay become rancid, may irritate the skin, and may thus give rise to\r\nerosions and to purulent secretion.\r\n\r\nIn chlorotic girls at the time of puberty, on account of the anæmic\r\ncondition of the blood, eczema is not uncommon, especially on the hands\r\nand the face. On the face, or on the forehead, red papules appear on\r\ncircumscribed areas, and become vesicular; raw, weeping spots are thus\r\nformed, and have a very disfiguring appearance. Such eczema may occur\r\nalso in connection with disturbances of menstruation, when the menses\r\nare scanty and pale, or when dysmenorrhœa is present.\r\n\r\nAt the time when menstruation ought to appear, but fails to do so,\r\nsometimes also, when menstruation is regular, with each successive\r\nperiod, an eruption of urticaria takes place; it usually disappears\r\nquickly, but in some cases is more persistent; owing to the intense\r\nitching it is always an extremely distressing complaint. Sometimes it\r\ntakes the form of urticaria factitia, in which the skin reacts to every\r\nkind of mechanical stimulation, such as rubbing, scratching, or\r\npressure, all of which alike lead to the formation of weals, which may\r\nbe diffused all over the body. Less often in association with\r\ndisturbances of menstruation, acute œdema or erythema are observed.\r\n\r\nFinally, we must mention herpes progenitalis, a rather uncommon acute\r\ncondition in which, with violent itching and burning sensation, intense\r\nredness and œdematous swelling of the skin, vesicles form on the\r\npræputium clitoridis, the nymphæ, and the inner surface of the labia\r\nmajora.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Hygiene During the Menarche._\r\n\r\nIt is the object of rational hygiene to increase the resisting power of\r\nthe organism, which has been depressed by the processes of the menarche,\r\nin order that the increased demands made by the awakened sexual life may\r\nbe adequately met.\r\n\r\nThe principal means for this purpose are, suitable diet, a suitable mode\r\nof life, and the employment of physical therapeutic measures, among\r\nwhich strengthening and hardening measures are to be preferred.\r\n\r\nThe diet should be at once as richly albuminous as possible and readily\r\ndigestible, there should be several, four or five, meals every day; in\r\nchlorotic patients food should be taken at regular intervals of two to\r\nthree hours. Meat should be a predominant article in the diet, but fresh\r\nvegetables should also be eaten in abundance for the sake of the\r\nnutritive salts they contain; the vegetables rich in compounds of iron,\r\nsuch as spinach, oats, beans, and lentils, are to be recommended; fruit,\r\nraw or cooked, should also be taken in considerable quantities. The\r\nevening meal[29] should not be too succulent or too plentiful; it may\r\nbest consist of soft-boiled eggs, an omelette, or milk. Alcoholic\r\nbeverages should be avoided or taken in minimal quantities; only as a\r\nstomachic may a glass of beer or of light wine be recommended.\r\n\r\nChlorotic patients should even at their first breakfast[29] have a meal\r\nrich in albumin, such as a considerable helping of meat, or a beefsteak,\r\nwith rolls, butter, and tea or coffee. Milk should be taken in small\r\nquantities only, not more than a pint to a pint and a half daily; only\r\nwhen solid food cannot be tolerated should milk be given freely. Beer\r\nand wine are often of value in chlorotic girls from their stimulant\r\naction on digestion and circulation. Half an hour’s rest before and\r\nafter meals is useful.\r\n\r\nFor the bill of fare of these patients I recommend especially: Roast\r\nbeef and veal, underdone beefsteak à l’Anglaise, ham; roasted venison,\r\nhare, partridge, grouse, fieldfare, hazel-hen, ptarmigan, pheasant,\r\nchicken, pigeon, turkey, oysters; asparagus, cauliflower, and spinach.\r\nFor variety, fish or shellfish may occasionally be taken. Sweetbread in\r\nsoup or with sauce forms a very delicious and easily digestible dish.\r\n\r\n_Kahane_ recommends for chlorotic patients the systematic use of\r\nBavarian beer, to the amount of about two pints daily; it should, he\r\nsays, be a beer rather dark in tint, full-brewed, rich in malt, but\r\ncontaining a comparatively small proportion of hops, alcohol, and\r\ncarbonic acid. _Jaworski_ has recommended a dietetic iron-beer,\r\ncontaining 4.7 per cent. of alcohol and from 0.0317 to 0.0644 per cent.\r\nof iron.\r\n\r\nWhen girls are at the same time anæmic and very thin, fat-containing\r\nfoods must be taken in abundance, such as milk, butter, and cream; also\r\nlarge quantities of carbohydrates. Farinaceous foods, rice, potatoes,\r\narrowroot, sago, tapioca, oatmeal, barley meal, carrots, turnips, sweet\r\nfruits, grapes, dates, pippins, plums, pears, and preserved fruits—all\r\nthese must appear at table more frequently than usual; beverages, in\r\naddition to milk, that are suitable are chocolate and cocoa, Bavarian\r\nbeer, and sweet, heavy wines.\r\n\r\nThe diet-table of such thin chlorotic patients should be as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst breakfast, 7.30 to 8 A. M.: Coffee or cocoa with milk, or a pint\r\nof milk, white bread and butter, honey. Second breakfast, 10 A. M.: Half\r\na pint to a pint of milk, egg and bread and butter, or sandwiches of\r\nsausage, ham, or roast meat. Mid-day dinner, 1 P. M.: Soup, roast meat\r\nwith vegetables and potatoes, or fish may take the place of the soup,\r\nsweets to follow. Afternoon, 4 P. M.: Coffee with milk, or a pint of\r\nmilk, with bread and butter. Supper, 7.30 P. M.: A plate of meat with\r\naccessories. Evening, 9 P. M.: A glass of milk.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of the anæmic form of obesity, to which chlorotic\r\npatients of the better classes are subject, in consequence of sedentary\r\nhabits and overfeeding, the diet must be so arranged that albumins\r\npredominate, whilst carbohydrates should be given sparingly, and as\r\nlittle fat as possible. As the average quantities of the food elements\r\nrequired in such cases, I suggest, 200 grammes of albumin, 12 grammes of\r\nfat, and 100 grammes of carbohydrate.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of fluid taken must be as small as possible, since the\r\ndeprivation of water may result in a proportionate increase in the solid\r\nconstituents of the blood, and thus increase its hæmoglobin-richness.\r\n\r\nThe amount of physical exercise taken by young girls at this period of\r\nlife must vary according to the circumstances of each individual case.\r\nIn general, we may recommend for them much active movement, especially\r\nin the open air, in order to counteract the effects of sedentary habits\r\nand confinement in close rooms. Chlorotic patients must, however, be\r\ncareful to avoid overdoing their exercise, and in some cases it will be\r\nnecessary to limit the amount of this very strictly. In severe cases of\r\nchlorosis, _Nothnagel_, _Hayem_, and other authorities recommend\r\ncomplete rest in bed for from four to six weeks. This rest-cure can be\r\ncarried out as far as possible in the open air, and can be combined with\r\nsystematic massage and the use of passive movements.\r\n\r\nI have drawn up the following diet-table for obese chlorotic patients:\r\n\r\n ┌───────────────┬────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n │               │Quantity in │              CONTAINS OF               │\r\n │               │  Grammes.  │                                        │\r\n ├───────────────┼────────────┼────────────┬────────────┬──────────────┤\r\n │       „       │     „      │  Albumin.  │    Fat.    │Carbohydrates.│\r\n ├───────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼──────────────┤\r\n │   Morning:    │            │            │            │              │\r\n │Beefsteak      │         100│        38.2│         1.7│            ——│\r\n │A cup of tea   │         150│        0.45│          ——│           0.9│\r\n │White bread    │          30│         2.9│         0.2│          18.0│\r\n │               │            │            │            │              │\r\n │   Mid-day:    │            │            │            │              │\r\n │Meat soup      │         100│         1.1│         1.5│           5.7│\r\n │Roast meat     │         200│        76.4│         3.4│            ——│\r\n │Vegetables     │          50│         0.8│         0.2│           4.2│\r\n │White bread    │          50│         4.8│         0.4│          30.0│\r\n │Light wine     │         150│          ——│          ——│           1.0│\r\n │               │            │            │            │              │\r\n │  Afternoon:   │            │            │            │              │\r\n │A cup of coffee│         120│         0.2│        0.67│           1.7│\r\n │White bread    │          25│         2.4│         0.2│          15.0│\r\n │               │            │            │            │              │\r\n │   Evening:    │            │            │            │              │\r\n │Roast meat     │         200│        46.4│         3.4│            ——│\r\n │Vegetables     │          25│         0.4│         0.1│           2.1│\r\n │Wine           │         150│          ——│            │            ——│\r\n │White bread    │          30│         2.9│         0.2│          18.0│\r\n ├───────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼──────────────┤\r\n │          Total│        1380│      206.97│       11.92│          97.6│\r\n ├───────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼──────────────┤\r\n │Contains about │            │            │            │              │\r\n │1300 calories. │            │            │            │              │\r\n └───────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴──────────────┘\r\n\r\nFor young girls at this period of life systematic gymnastic exercises\r\nare usually valuable, not only for strengthening the muscular system and\r\nimproving the physique during these years of growth, but also for\r\nassisting the functions of respiration, circulation, and digestion.\r\nBeginning with the simplest and easiest exercises of chamber gymnastics,\r\nthe girl gradually proceeds to more difficult and elaborate exercises\r\nand to the use of medico-mechanical apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe clothing of young girls at the time of the menarche must receive\r\nattention to this extent, that all articles of clothing should be\r\nrejected which increase the tendency already existing to hyperæmia of\r\nthe genital organs or offer any hindrance to the circulation in general.\r\nAbove all, the physician must take his part in the contest so long and\r\nso vainly urged against the corset. But further, all tight clothing,\r\nsuch as restricts the freedom of movement of the thorax and the abdomen,\r\ntight collars, and tight garters—all these must be forbidden; moreover\r\nexcessively warm underclothing, of the lower extremities especially,\r\nwhich may stimulate the genital organs, must also be prohibited.\r\n\r\nAs regards the night hours, a thick feather bed is unsuitable. The young\r\ngirl should sleep on a hair mattress, and the bed clothing should be\r\nlight. Eight to nine hours sleep is sufficient; in the words of the\r\nEnglish proverb, “early to bed and early to rise, is the way to be\r\nhealthy, and wealthy, and wise.”\r\n\r\nTo live by rule, with regular hours of work and suitable pauses for\r\nrest, is of great importance. Among the well-to-do classes also care\r\nshould be taken that the adolescent girl takes moderate physical\r\nexercise for several hours daily; she should go for a good walk, and not\r\nspend hour after hour recumbent upon a sofa in idle reverie. Sitting for\r\ntoo long a time, whether engaged in sewing or at the piano, is harmful;\r\nworking at the sewing-machine is permissible for short periods only, and\r\nis indeed at this period of life better altogether avoided. Bicycling is\r\nalso an unsuitable exercise at this age and readily leads to\r\nmasturbation. Lawn tennis and croquet, on the other hand, are very\r\nsuitable active open-air games; in winter, skating may be indulged in if\r\nproper precautions are taken against chill; in summer, swimming and\r\nrowing. The reading of light literature should be kept under\r\nsupervision; equivocal novels, such as may give rise to erotic reverie\r\nand sensual excitement, must be strictly forbidden. A watch should be\r\nkept for any indications of the habit of masturbation; and if the habit\r\nexists, appropriate measures should be taken.\r\n\r\nHydrotherapeutic procedures and baths are of great hygienic and\r\ntherapeutic importance for girls at the menarche. In healthy girls at\r\nthis period of life, a cold sponge-bath lasting one or two minutes, the\r\ntemperature of the water ranging from 10° to 20° C. (50° to 63° F.),\r\ntaken either on rising in the morning or immediately before going to\r\nbed, is a valuable means for hardening the whole body; equally useful\r\nare cold shower-baths, lasting from a few seconds up to half a minute.\r\nIf the girl is somewhat anæmic, it will be well for her to take a glass\r\nof warm milk or a cup of tea half an hour before the bath, in order to\r\nguard against too great an abstraction of heat. Cold bathing in rivers,\r\nwhen available, may also be recommended. In cases in which a\r\nconsiderable degree of anæmia or chlorosis is present, cold baths and\r\nevery form of strong mechanical stimulation by the use of water, douches\r\nand the like, are to be avoided, since we have to fear both excessive\r\nabstraction of heat and overstimulation of the nerves. In such anæmic\r\nand chlorotic patients, either partial washing with lukewarm water or\r\ngeneral lukewarm baths, the temperature of which may be gradually and\r\ncautiously lowered, either on rising or at bedtime, have a refreshing\r\nand stimulating effect.\r\n\r\nIn girls who are in other respects healthy, but in whom the menarche is\r\ndelayed, and in whom menstruation, when begun, has been scanty and\r\nirregular, cold sitz-baths of short duration, the abdomen being\r\nsimultaneously douched from a considerable height, or cold shower-baths\r\nin combination with powerful abdominal douches, are often of value.\r\n\r\nRecently, hot air and vapor baths have been especially recommended for\r\ngirls suffering from chlorosis, at first, by _Scholz_ and _Schubert_, in\r\nassociation with phlebotomy, but also without this. _Kühne_, for\r\nexample, has seen the most satisfactory results follow the simple use of\r\nsudatory baths in cases of chlorosis; improvement was manifested by an\r\nincrease in the corpuscular richness of the blood, an increase in the\r\nhæmoglobin-richness, and an increase in the body-weight. In cases of\r\nchlorosis, _Traugott_ also has seen favorable results follow the use of\r\nhot air baths and the consequent diaphoresis.\r\n\r\nStill more recently _Dehio_ and especially _Rosin_ have recommended hot\r\nbaths for girls suffering from chlorosis. In fifty cases of chlorosis,\r\nin which other methods of treatment had given negative results, _Rosin_\r\ngave three times a week baths at a temperature of 40° C. (104° F.),\r\nlasting at first a quarter of an hour, but later half an hour. After the\r\nbath, in those strong enough to bear it, a very short cold douche or\r\ncold sponging followed; then the patient had to lie down for an hour.\r\nThe treatment was carried out for from four to six weeks. Each bath by\r\nitself had a notable refreshing effect in these patients, and at the end\r\nof the course most of the cases exhibited an improvement in all their\r\nsymptoms, such as other methods of treatment had failed to produce.\r\n\r\nThe favorable influence exercised by these hot baths, as by steam\r\nbath-cabinets, light baths, sun baths, wet packing, and similar\r\nsudorific measures, may in part be explained by the dehydration of the\r\nsystem that is thus effected; whilst those who maintain the\r\nauto-intoxication theory of chlorosis may regard the diaphoresis as a\r\nmeans for the elimination of noxious substances from the body.\r\n\r\nBathing in water aerated with carbonic acid may be recommended for\r\npatients suffering from anæmia and chlorosis at this period of life, for\r\nthe reason that such baths can be tolerated at a lower temperature than\r\nbaths of ordinary water. The natural mineral waters containing free\r\ncarbonic acid, and chalybeate waters rich in carbonic acid, when used as\r\nbaths, are effective principally in virtue of the carbonic acid they\r\ncontain, which stimulates the skin; this stimulus being conducted by the\r\nnervous system from the periphery to the nerve-centres, is reflected\r\nthence, and by irradiation exercises a quickening effect on all the\r\nprocesses of nutrition. These baths are usually taken at a temperature\r\nprogressively reduced from 32° C. to 25° C. (90° F. to 77° F.), and each\r\nbath lasts from ten to twenty minutes; they are in most cases taken\r\nevery other day only. For young girls in whom the menarche is delayed,\r\nalso for chlorotic patients with amenorrhœa and neuralgic\r\nmanifestations, chalybeate peat baths are indicated, which influence the\r\nperipheral nerves by the exercise of a gentle yet considerable thermic\r\nstimulus. These chalybeate peat baths have further been shown to\r\nincrease the hæmoglobin-richness, the corpuscular richness, and the\r\nspecific gravity of the blood, transitorily after each bath, but to some\r\nextent permanently also, a certain increase enduring after the course is\r\nover.\r\n\r\nYoung girls suffering from disturbances of their general health\r\ndependent upon a scrofulous or rachitic habit of body may with advantage\r\nbe sent to brine baths, especially to such as are situated in the Alps\r\nor other mountainous regions. These weakly, lymphatic, scrofulous girls,\r\nsuffering from scanty or irregular menstruation, may also practice\r\nsea-bathing with advantage, especially at watering places on the sea\r\ncoast, where the waves are powerful. In such cases, however, it is\r\nadvisable in the first instance to take artificially warmed sea-water\r\nbaths, before proceeding to actual sea-bathing.\r\n\r\nIf the sensibility of a chlorotic patient is so great that she can\r\nendure neither peat baths nor carbonic acid containing mineral water\r\nbaths, we must add to the latter, in order to make their action milder,\r\ndecoctions of chamomile, wheat bran, malt, and the like.\r\n\r\nIn cases in which nervous symptoms predominate, with an apathetic,\r\nmelancholic frame of mind, aromatic herb baths are sometimes useful. For\r\nthis purpose such herbs should be employed as contain a notable quantity\r\nof ethereal oils, such as sage (salvia officinalis), wild thyme (thymus\r\nserpyllum), hyssop (hyssopus officinalis), wild marjoram (origanum\r\nvulgare), rue (ruta graveolens), archangel (archangelica officinalis),\r\nlevisticum (levisticum officinale). Equally useful are the balsamic pine\r\nneedle baths, for which the fluid obtained by the distillation of pine\r\nneedles (pinus sylvestris), freshly collected day by day, is employed.\r\n\r\nAs regards the climatic conditions suitable for adolescent girls\r\nsuffering from the disorders of the menarche, from the nervous\r\nconditions associated therewith, and from chlorosis, residence either in\r\nthe mountains or at the seaside is especially to be recommended. An\r\naltitude of about 1,200 metres (4,000 feet) is the most suitable, being\r\nthat at which the peculiar characteristics of mountain climates are most\r\nfully developed. The influence of such a climate on hæmatopoiesis has to\r\nbe taken into consideration, as well as its special influence on the\r\nmenstrual function.\r\n\r\nEven though it cannot yet be regarded as fully determined whether the\r\nincrease observed by _Viault_, _Egger_, and _Mercier_, in the\r\ncorpuscular richness and hæmoglobin-richness of the blood in consequence\r\nof residence in a mountain climate, is lasting or merely transitory, yet\r\nit is certain that the hæmatopoietic organs are favorably influenced by\r\nsuch residence, and that the good results are augmented by the\r\nstimulating effect mountain air exercises on the appetite and the\r\ndigestion. _Lombard_ has moreover observed, that at a high altitude the\r\nmenstrual flow is more abundant and dysmenorrhœa is less common. For\r\nyoung girls, therefore, suffering from irritable conditions of the\r\nheart, increased frequency of the pulse, or increased arterial tension,\r\nand for those also in whom the resisting power of the organism appears\r\ndeficient, a visit to a mountain health resort situated amid forests may\r\nbe recommended. For scrofulous girls a visit to the coast of the North\r\nSea is especially suitable. For the slighter forms of anæmia, a sea\r\nvoyage, in which the benefits of sea air can be obtained more fully, and\r\nfor a longer period, may be advised; but such a voyage is quite\r\nunsuitable for those suffering from severe anæmia or chlorosis.\r\n\r\nSuch very weakly, intensely anæmic and chlorotic patients should spend\r\nthe winter in some southern health resort.\r\n\r\nThe skin, in which disturbances so readily occur at the time of the\r\nmenarche, requires careful attention, all the more because it is\r\nprecisely at this age that young girls have the greatest need of their\r\npersonal charms. The skin of the face, which is often disfigured by\r\ncomedones and acne, must be carefully guarded against the accumulation\r\nof sebum in the sebaceous glands by sedulous washing with warm water and\r\na good soap. If the seborrhœic[30] process in these glands becomes at\r\nall severe, ordinary soaps are unsuitable, and a potash soap must be\r\nused, such as sapo viridis, or spiritus saponatus kalinus, which have\r\ngreat power of dissolving fats.\r\n\r\nThe best way of dealing with seborrhœa is according to _Spietschka_ and\r\n_Grünfeld_ the following: The washing is best effected in the evenings,\r\nwhen the skin will not again for many hours be exposed to the fresh air,\r\nto wind, or to dust. Pour into a basin about a pint of warm water and\r\nadd from one to two teaspoonfuls of spirit of soap (equivalent to the\r\nlinimentum saponis of the British Pharmacopœia) or as much soft soap as\r\ncan be taken up on the end of a table-knife. The water is then stirred\r\nvigorously till a good lather is formed, and with the water and the\r\nlather the face is thoroughly washed. The skin must then be carefully\r\ndried, and thereafter it is well to smear it with some greasy material,\r\nsuch as boric vaseline, in order to prevent the plugging of the pores\r\nwith dust, and to protect the sebum subsequently exuded from\r\ndessication. On the next day the washing should be repeated only if the\r\nface has become covered with sebum within an hour or two after the first\r\nwashing. If the exudation is less free, the eyes only should be washed\r\nwith fresh water, whilst the rest of the face should not be wetted, but\r\nmerely be wiped with a dry face towel lightly dusted with toilet powder,\r\nin order to remove any accumulation of sebum.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the genital regions must be carefully cleansed, especially\r\nin cases in which there is a tendency to hypersecretion of the sebaceous\r\nglands, to eczema, or to herpes progenitalis; subsequently it should be\r\npowdered, and pads of absorbent cotton-wool dusted with toilet powder\r\nshould be placed in the labial furrows.\r\n\r\nIt is of great importance that in girls at this time of life\r\ngynecological examination should be undertaken only in cases of the\r\nutmost need, and this restriction should be especially inflexible in the\r\ncase of girls with a neuropathic predisposition. Instances have been\r\nobserved in which a vaginal examination, the introduction of a vaginal\r\nspeculum, or the use of the uterine sound, has determined the onset of a\r\npsychosis. Still more does what has been said hold true of local\r\ntreatment in gynecological cases. Repeated passage of the uterine sound,\r\ncauterization of the cervix, and the manipulations of gynecological\r\nmassage, make a very deep impression upon the mind of a girl, and give\r\nrise to morbid ideas and erotic storms, so that even in those with a\r\npowerful constitution, various neuroses, neurasthenic states, and even\r\nmental disorders may result. If in such cases, especially in girls of a\r\nneuropathic temperament, gynecological treatment is quite indispensable,\r\na single, though energetic, operative procedure is to be preferred to a\r\nnumber of successive, though taken singly less extensive, manipulations\r\nof and in the female genital organs. The importance of this proposition\r\nhas been repeatedly established. _Saenger_, for instance, points out as\r\na fact to be regretted that uterine cauterization with mild caustics is\r\nfar too frequently undertaken; and _Odebrecht_ from the same standpoint\r\nproclaims the advantage of a single curetting as compared with milder\r\nintra-uterine impressions repeated during a course of treatment lasting\r\nmany months. On the other hand, the physician must bear in mind the\r\nfact, established by the record of a very large number of cases, that in\r\nwomen predisposed to psychoses severe gynecological operations are apt\r\nto lead to the actual appearance of mental disorders, or to the\r\nexacerbation of mental disorders which have previously been very mild or\r\nhave merely threatened to appear. Careful consideration is needed, on\r\nthe one hand as regards the severity of the disease of the genital\r\norgans, and on the other as regards the resisting power, temperament,\r\nand constitution of the girl concerned, and in many cases a consultation\r\nbetween the gynecologist and the neurologist is expedient.\r\n\r\nA very powerful influence on the physical and moral well-being of the\r\ngirl at puberty is exercised by her domestic upbringing. The general\r\ntruth of _Gœthe’s_ saying, that the circumstances into which we are born\r\nexercise a determining influence on the whole life, being admitted, we\r\nhave to remember that this applies with especial force in the case of\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nThe educational views which obtain at the present day among the upper\r\nten thousand, are by no means calculated for the production of a woman\r\nhealthy in body and sound in mind. From the time when the young girl\r\nbecomes sexually developed, the claims which society makes upon her\r\nbecome pressing. Every day, by a number of stimuli, her curiosity and\r\nher desires are directed toward sexual matters. Visits to museums,\r\npicture galleries, and theatres, the perusal of modern romances, the\r\nfree mingling of the sexes in all places of amusement—all these combine\r\nto awaken prematurely an instinct to which the “old fashioned” methods\r\nof education allowed a much more prolonged slumber. In other cases, the\r\nmother’s supervision of the developing girl is hindered and rendered\r\ninsufficient because the mother herself is claimed by her society duties\r\nand taken much away from her home. In addition, the young brain is\r\noverburdened with mental work, the modern idea of the equality of the\r\nsexes in matters of love is instilled, and a desire is artificially\r\nevoked, and is matured by a certain idle vanity, to indulge the\r\n“natural” instincts—to manifest sexual passion and to indulge it to\r\nexcess—and thus the modesty so natural and so becoming to young girls is\r\ncompletely lost. Nourished in such a soil, neurasthenic and hysterical\r\nstates, disorders of menstruation, and masturbation, cannot fail to\r\nflourish.\r\n\r\nIn these respects also a change is requisite, and a mode of upbringing\r\nmust be inculcated from which everything likely to inflame the sexual\r\nimpulse is removed. For the adolescent girl a systematic alternation of\r\nwork and recreation must be arranged. From great entertainments where\r\nshe will mix with young men, from theatres, evening parties, and balls,\r\nthe young girl at the time of the menarche, at the period when\r\nmenstruation commences, must as far as possible be kept away, and such\r\npleasures must be reserved for a more advanced stage of this period of\r\ndevelopment. Intellectual overstrain, the overtaxing of the young head,\r\nmust be avoided; the acquirement of knowledge must take place gradually\r\nand slowly, and in a manner adapted to individual peculiarities.\r\nIntercourse with female friends also requires supervision in respect of\r\nthe moral characteristics of these latter. Religious reverie must be\r\navoided, but also to be avoided is the modern nihilism in respect of\r\nreligion and good morals. Books must be carefully chosen in order that\r\nthe imagination may remain pure and in order that girlish illusions may\r\nnot be prematurely destroyed. Domestic recreations in the way of games,\r\nmusic, singing, painting, and other forms of artistic culture, are of\r\nimportance for the development of a strenuous faculty for learning.\r\nTravel in regions where the scenery is beautiful, forms a most valuable\r\nmeans for the ennoblement of the intellect and the emotions.\r\n\r\nAdditional matters demanding attention are, as already mentioned, the\r\nsuitability of the diet, and proper physical exercise. All stimulating\r\narticles of food are to be avoided, the excessive use of meat is to be\r\nforbidden, and a sufficient mixed diet, containing both animal and\r\nvegetable substances, is to be prescribed. Tea and coffee should be\r\ntaken as sparingly as possible, and alcoholic beverages must be\r\nabsolutely prohibited. The regulation of the bowels is of great\r\nimportance. Young girls should accustom themselves to evacuate the\r\nbowels every day at a fixed hour, the best time to adopt being either\r\nimmediately on rising or just after breakfast. Constipation is very apt\r\nto lead to the production of irritable conditions of the genital organs.\r\n\r\nWe can point out as a happy instance of modern progress that the\r\npractice of certain physical exercises has actually become the fashion\r\nfor young girls. Gymnastics, with or without apparatus, swimming,\r\nskating, and lawn tennis, involve a number of bodily movements\r\nadvantageous for the health; and in connection with most of these the\r\nenjoyment of fresh air offers an additional favorable influence.\r\nBicycling, however, at this period of life is open to many objections,\r\nnot only on account of the likelihood of direct injury to the genital\r\norgans now in course of development, but also on account of the impulse\r\nit produces toward onanistic manipulations.\r\n\r\nEspecial attention must be paid to the clothing, regarding which the\r\nrequirements of fashion so often conflict with those of hygiene, the\r\nvictory, unfortunately, in most cases falling to the former. The period\r\nof the menarche is indeed usually regarded as the proper time for the\r\nyoung girl to begin wearing a corset, if it has not been worn before. In\r\nthis connection _M. Runge_ makes the significant remark: “As long as\r\nbodice and skirt form the two principal articles of woman’s clothing,\r\nthe corset or some similar article cannot be dispensed with. The vicious\r\nfeatures in the corset are its constriction of the thorax, with the\r\nobject of giving the woman a ‘figure,’ and the introduction into its\r\nsubstance of strips of whalebone or steel in order to give firmness to\r\nthe figure. The harm done by the former feature, the compression of the\r\nabdominal viscera, the corset liver (lacing liver, constricted liver,\r\nGer. _Schnürleber_), the movable kidney, etc.—all are so well known that\r\nthey need not be particularly described. But the strong pressure from\r\nabove has a deleterious effect upon the internal genital organs also,\r\nleading to passive hyperæmia and to displacements. The ‘bones’ of the\r\ncorset take part in the compression, and they replace the functions of\r\nthe muscles of the back. If a woman who has long worn a corset lays it\r\naside later in life, she complains that she is no longer able to hold\r\nherself upright. In consequence of insufficient work the muscles of the\r\nback have become incapable of keeping the back straight. The corset,\r\nthen, must neither constrict the body, nor must it contain ‘bones.’ An\r\narticle of clothing analogous to the corset is, however, required for\r\nthe support of the skirt and the petticoats that clothe the lower limbs.\r\nThese latter are usually fastened by means of bands which encircle the\r\nbody above the crest of the ilium. In order to give these bands a\r\nsufficient hold, this region of the body is compressed by the corset.\r\nThe burden of skirt and petticoats is thus borne by a furrow, above the\r\npelvis and below or in the region of the asternal or false ribs, which\r\nis in great part artificially produced. All this is bad. In order to\r\navoid the necessity for any constriction, the petticoats should be\r\nfastened to the corset, and this latter should be supported from the\r\nshoulders by means of shoulder-straps or braces crossing one another\r\nbehind. No constriction of the thorax then occurs, and if the corset has\r\nsuitable supporting pouches for the breasts, and the wearer is\r\naccustomed to hold herself erect, the figure of a well-formed woman thus\r\nattired is far from unpleasing, and is, above all, natural. If the\r\nweight of skirt and petticoats is too great to be borne by the\r\nshoulders, the burden can be divided, some being fastened to the corset,\r\nothers tied round the waist. This method is less to be commended, but\r\nmay be regarded as a permissible middle course. If chemise and drawers\r\nare woven in one piece, as in the ‘combination’ under garment, there is\r\none article the less to be attached to the corset. Recently a number of\r\ncorsets and articles of clothing have been made in accordance with these\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n“The growing girl, then, may wear a soft corset with shoulder-straps,\r\nmade to measure, to which all the garments clothing the parts below the\r\nwaist should be made to fasten. It must unfortunately be admitted that\r\nthis rational mode of arranging the clothing cannot be adapted to the\r\n‘low dress’ which etiquette demands on so many occasions for evening\r\nwear, since with the latter the shoulder-straps cannot be worn.\r\n\r\n“It is most unhygienic for women to wear, as they so often do, drawers\r\nthat are widely open. Both cleanliness and the need for an equable\r\nwarmth demand that these garments should be closed between the thighs,\r\nnot to speak of other reasons.”\r\n\r\nIn order to diminish the sexual impulse in girls at the menarche, where\r\nthis impulse has developed prematurely or is abnormally intense, and\r\neven in later years with the same end in view, it is necessary, not\r\nmerely that the diet should be suitable and non-stimulating and that the\r\neducational environment should be satisfactory, but above all that there\r\nshould be regular occupation and regular physical activity. _Ribbing_\r\nrightly calls attention to his experience in dealing with animals, that\r\nequally in the case of the stallion and of the mare, the whole of life\r\nmay without difficulty be passed in complete abstinence from sexual\r\ngratification, provided that the diet is suitable, being neither too\r\nrich nor too meagre, and that the animal has regular occupation of a\r\nnature and degree adapted to its powers. In these animals a certain\r\namount of disquiet, of restlessness, of sulky irritability, etc., may\r\nindeed be noticed at times, but these manifestations are to be overcome\r\nby mingled gentleness and firmness, aided now and again also by mild\r\nchastisement, but altogether without any severity. “Chastity,” says\r\n_Oesterlen_, “is possible only when the mode of life is simple and\r\nregular, and is characterized by appropriate self-command and frugality.\r\nFor this reason it is rarely encountered in palaces and similar places,\r\nin which from youth onwards every one can do what he pleases; but just\r\nas little is it really practicable amid conditions of lack of culture,\r\nrudeness, and poverty.”\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of education, what _Moreau_ wrote a hundred years\r\nago is of importance: “In the ordinary course of nature the young woman\r\nat the time of the first appearance of menstruation is still in full\r\npossession of those amiable qualities of blamelessness and chastity\r\nwhich we are accustomed to denote by the term _moral virginity_. To an\r\nhonorable and pure-minded man this beautiful attribute of budding\r\nwomanhood is much dearer and more estimable than physical virginity. By\r\nlibertines only is the latter regarded as a most valuable possession,\r\nsince it furnishes a powerful stimulus to their jaded imaginations. But\r\nmoral virginity and physical virginity are not always and necessarily\r\nassociated, for either can be present in the absence of the other.\r\nPhysical virginity may be destroyed by diverse forms of violence, and\r\nyet moral virginity may remain pure and uninjured amidst its ruins. Thus\r\nthe two are widely different one from the other, widely different also\r\nare they in value and significance.”\r\n\r\nWhat _Eulenburg_ says regarding the prophylaxis of sexual neurasthenia\r\nin general is true regarding the sexual life of the girl at this period\r\nof life. “What is needed,” he writes, “is the control of educational\r\ninfluences with these ends in view, that, on the one hand, the sexual\r\nexcitability of developing youth shall be diminished and kept within\r\nbounds, and that nevertheless, on the other, the urgently needed\r\nenlightenment shall be afforded to the young people at the proper time\r\nand in a suitable form. How these aims are to be effected cannot be\r\nexplained in generally applicable propositions. It is a matter which\r\nmust be left to the tact of the parents and of other members of the\r\nfamily, who will be guided by the insight they have acquired into the\r\nmental life of those concerned. * * *. Children inclined to onanism must\r\nbe carefully supervised by day and by night; they must be protected from\r\nall stimulating things and from bad company; in boarding-schools it is\r\nthe common dormitories that require the most strict, most careful, and\r\nmost continuous control. In the case of auto-onanists, female as well as\r\nmale, we must enquire into the possible existence of local stimulating\r\ninfluences, among which, in both sexes, oxyuris must be mentioned—but in\r\ntruth it is rare for such local conditions to be the exciting cause of\r\nmasturbation. A healthy mode of life in respect of clothing, sleep, and\r\ndiet, and the systematic practice of bodily exercises to the point of\r\nconsiderable fatigue, are the most effectual means of counteracting the\r\nnoxious propensity to onanism.”\r\n\r\nA high degree of freedom permitted to girls from a very early age is, as\r\n_Rousseau_ already maintained, by no means favorable to the preservation\r\nof virginity.\r\n\r\nA wise mother or a wise instructress can do much towards the\r\npreservation of physical and moral virginity, by enlightening her\r\ndaughter or pupil at the right time and in a proper manner as to the\r\nnature of the sexual processes, and their significance for the whole\r\nlife of woman. Ignorance in this respect, equally with pseudo-knowledge,\r\nentails many dangers. I regard it as indispensable that the adolescent\r\ngirl should in good time learn from her mother the nature of\r\nmenstruation, lest she should first receive enlightenment in an\r\nunfitting manner from some more experienced female friend. The mother\r\nshould explain that the impending flow of blood is a natural process,\r\nunattended by danger, but indispensable to the sexual life, and a\r\ncharacteristic part of the process of “growing up.”\r\n\r\nThe knotty and important topic of how the young girl may best receive\r\nsexual enlightenment from her mother, is discussed by _E. Stiehl_ in her\r\nnotable work “A Maternal Duty.”[31] The authoress points out that this\r\nenlightenment must not take place suddenly and without apparent motive,\r\nbut that the mother must in a gentle and gradual manner introduce to her\r\nchild the secrets of nature. A beginning may be made by teaching the\r\nchild to observe the nature and growth of plants; then she may be led to\r\ninterest herself in the family life of animals; and thus an easy way is\r\nfound to answer the questions connected with reproduction—to answer them\r\nin a manner at once true and befitting.\r\n\r\nLet the mother indicate to her child the methods employed by nature for\r\nthe preservation of the life of the young plant; let her demonstrate in\r\na flower the stamens and the pistil as male and female organs\r\nrespectively; and let her explain how when the pollen-grain reaches and\r\nfertilizes the tiny ovule in the ovary, this ovule becomes capable of\r\ndevelopment into a large seed containing an active rudimentary plant,\r\nwhich latter itself enlarges to become a new full-grown specimen of its\r\nkind. The opportunity may then be seized to draw attention to the\r\nresemblance between the little ovules in the ovary of the flower and the\r\nminute ova by means of which all animal life reproduces its kind.\r\nProceeding further, an earnest and thorough introduction to the sanctity\r\nand responsibility, the perils and duties, of the sexual life, is\r\nurgently required by the young girl before she proceeds either to\r\nmarriage or to an economically independent mode of life.\r\n\r\nNot only in America and England, but now also in Germany, there exist\r\nexcellent books which may actually be put into the growing girl’s own\r\nhands, by means of which she will be introduced in an intelligent manner\r\nto a knowledge of the method of reproduction in the human species.\r\n\r\nOften enough, when the mother is lacking in intelligence or sympathy, it\r\nwill be the duty of the physician to give this enlightenment to the\r\nyoung girl. The interpreter of such tidings at the time of love’s\r\ndawning will be the family doctor, to whom the girl and her family have\r\nbeen confidently accustomed to turn for information regarding the bodily\r\nstate and well-being. He is accustomed to remove many a veil without any\r\noffense to maidenly modesty. Many sexual disorders and much sexual\r\naberration may thus be prevented.\r\n\r\nCertain definite hygienic rules must now be prescribed. First of all,\r\nthe strictest cleanliness must be observed, not only in the intervals,\r\nbut also during menstruation. The prejudice against changing the under\r\nlinen during the flow must be overcome, and care must be taken that at\r\nthis time the external genitals are washed twice daily with water at a\r\ntemperature of 26° C. to 28° C. (about 80° F.), and a wad of absorbent\r\ncotton-wool or a piece of clean linen (sponges are not to be used for\r\nthis purpose); any article of underclothing that becomes soiled with\r\nblood must be changed. Most useful are the so-called “sanitary towels,”\r\nmade of sterilized absorbent cotton-wool, fastened to a linen band which\r\nsurrounds the waist, or simple pads of absorbent material may be used,\r\nkept in place by means of a bandage. During menstruation, full baths,\r\nwarm or cold, are to be avoided, likewise long walks, riding, long\r\njourneys by rail, gymnastics, with or without apparatus, skating, lawn\r\ntennis, and bicycling; dancing, above all, must be prohibited, since it\r\ninvolves a combination of several noxious influences—the very active\r\nmovement, which produces hyperæmia of the genital organs, sexual\r\nexcitement, loss of sleep, long hours spent in close rooms, prolonged\r\nvoluntary retention of urine, and the risk of a chill. Singing, also,\r\nmust be discontinued during menstruation, since otherwise an injury to\r\nthe voice is very likely to result. A certain limitation in respect of\r\nphysical and mental activity is indicated as a general precautionary\r\nmeasure during menstruation, but this measure must not be pushed to\r\nexcess, so that the habit is acquired of resting completely during the\r\nperiod, passing the days on a sofa. The favorite practice, in cases of\r\nscanty menstruation, of taking hot foot-baths is to be rejected. At the\r\nconclusion of each menstrual period, however, a tepid bath should be\r\ntaken. The knowledge we have now acquired of the rhythmical “menstrual\r\nwave” process (see p. 19 _et seq._) points to the practical conclusion\r\nthat the physician should not direct his attention to the actual\r\nmenstrual period only, but also, and more than has hitherto been\r\ncustomary, to the premenstrual period, in which temperature,\r\nblood-pressure, and excretion of urea attain their acme; especially\r\nshould this be done, with the aim of prescribing suitable hygienic\r\nprecautions, in cases in which the menstrual discharge is very profuse\r\nor in which nervous manifestations accompany menstruation.\r\n\r\nImportant is it also for the physician to take precautions against the\r\npractice by young girls of unduly prolonged voluntary retention of the\r\nurine, resulting in over-distension of the bladder; also against the\r\nperformance of very active movements and against powerful muscular\r\nefforts when the bladder is in a distended state. All of these are\r\nliable to result in displacements of the uterus.\r\n\r\nDuring menstruation the diet should be sufficient, but free from\r\nstimulating elements. When the menstrual flow is greatly in excess,\r\nstrong tea and coffee, wine, and beer should be forbidden; conversely,\r\nwhen menstruation is scanty, an invigorating diet is especially\r\nindicated, and the use of strong wines. According to the investigations\r\nof _T. Schrader_, in order to maintain the nitrogenous balance during\r\nmenstruation, it is necessary to give the following daily diet,\r\nrepresenting a heat value of 2,013 to 2,076 calories:\r\n\r\n                   125–150 grammes of fowl.\r\n                       100 grammes of butter.\r\n                   125–140 grammes of white bread.\r\n                       150 grammes of brown bread.\r\n                     70–80 grammes of eggs.\r\n                       600 grammes of coffee.\r\n                       600 grammes of soup.\r\n                       560 grammes of Seltzer water.\r\n                        20 grammes of salt.\r\n\r\nFor chlorotic girls the following diet may be recommended during\r\nmenstruation. Before rising a pint of milk should be taken slowly, in\r\nsips, during a period not exceeding half an hour; for the first\r\nbreakfast (see note to p. 112), tea or coffee with an abundance of milk,\r\na considerable portion of meat (roast beef, cold fowl, cutlets, or\r\nbeefsteak); for the second breakfast, a tumbler of milk, bread, butter,\r\nand a couple of eggs; for mid-day dinner, a good helping of fresh meat\r\nso cooked as to be easily digested, green vegetables, potatoes,\r\nfarinaceous pudding, stewed fruit, and a glass of burgundy or claret; at\r\n4 P. M., coffee and bread and butter, or a tumbler of milk; at 7 P. M.,\r\na similar meal to the mid-day dinner, but lighter; no supper. In this\r\ndiet-table, which represents a heat-value of about 2,200 calories,\r\nalbumin and fat are present in abundance (182.8 grammes albumin and 763\r\ngrammes fat), but carbohydrates in small quantity only (176.9 grammes).\r\n\r\nFor those chlorotic patients who find it difficult to digest much\r\nbutcher’s meat, the necessary quantum of albumin must be supplied by\r\nincreasing the amount of milk, soup, and the white varieties of flesh\r\n(chicken and the like), giving also a considerable amount of the more\r\neasily digested vegetables, with fruit, beer, and a little claret. For\r\nsuch cases _Desqué_ has drawn up the following diet-table, representing\r\n3,290 calories and containing 150 grammes of albumin, 110.7 grammes of\r\nfat, and 449.6 grammes of carbohydrate; meat is given once a day only:\r\n\r\n   7.30 A. M.— Half a pint of milk, 50 grammes roll, 10 grammes butter.\r\n\r\n     10 A. M.— 300 grammes apples, strawberries, or cranberries, 50\r\n                 grammes roll, 10 grammes butter.\r\n\r\n  12.30 P. M.— 200 grammes of beefsteak, 100 grammes of macaroni, 300\r\n                 grammes of bread, 400 grammes of spinach, 200 grammes\r\n                 of stewed apples or gooseberries.\r\n\r\n      4 P. M.— 200 grammes vegetable-peptone-cocoa, 50 grammes roll, 10\r\n                 grammes butter.\r\n\r\n   7.30 P. M.— 200 grammes rice-broth, 500 grammes buttermilk, 100\r\n                 grammes bread, 10 grammes butter, 200 grammes salad,\r\n                 300 grammes uncooked pears, 40 grammes curds.\r\n\r\nIn cases of profuse metrorrhagia in girls, _von Winckel_ recommends in\r\naddition to rest in the recumbent posture, a diet containing large\r\nquantities of fluid, and much easily assimilable albuminous nutrient\r\nmaterial, all stimulating articles and those likely to cause nausea and\r\nvomiting being avoided. He gives the following diet-table:\r\n\r\n 7 A. M.— 250 grammes of milk.\r\n\r\n 9 A. M.— 250 grammes of bouillon, 1 egg, 20 grammes of brandy.\r\n\r\n 11 A. M.— 250 grammes of milk.\r\n\r\n 1 P. M.— 100 grammes of roast meat, 250 grammes of rice-broth with 5 grammes\r\n       of somatose, and 150 grammes of claret.\r\n\r\n 3 P. M.— 250 grammes of milk.\r\n\r\n 5 P. M.— 1 egg, 20 grammes of brandy.\r\n\r\n 7 P. M.— 250 grammes of bouillon or white soup with 5 grammes of somatose.\r\n\r\nAs a beverage in the intervals, weak cold tea is allowed. When the\r\nhæmorrhage has ceased, the following beverages are suitable: oatmeal,\r\ncocoa, Pilsener beer (one pint daily), milk (2 to 3 pints daily), claret\r\n(a half bottle daily). For food, the lighter varieties of meat, 200 to\r\n300 grammes daily, sweetbread, pigeon, ham, nutrient and easily\r\ndigestible vegetables, spinach, carrots, and pea-soup, may be\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nIn cases of amenorrhœa or scanty menstruation, especially when due to\r\nanæmia or to underfeeding, mental excitement, or over-exertion, warm\r\nbaths at a temperature of 28° to 29° R. (90° to 92° F.), rubbing the\r\nbody with wet towels, and warm sitz-baths, are of good service.\r\n\r\n  [NOTE: Although in this translation the English equivalents of the\r\n  measures used on the Continent have as a rule been appended in\r\n  parenthesis, this has not been thought necessary in the case of the\r\n  diet-tables, since even in English works these are commonly stated\r\n  in terms of the metric system. It may here be mentioned that, as\r\n  regards fluid measures, 250 grammes (a quarter of a litre) is\r\n  roughly equivalent to half a pint, an ordinary tumblerful or\r\n  breakfast-cupful; and that, as regards solid measures, 30 grammes\r\n  are equivalent to a very little more than an avoirdupois ounce.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Menstruation._\r\n\r\nMenstruation is the name given to the process which manifests itself in\r\nthe human female after the age of puberty by the discharge from the\r\ngenital organs at regular four-weekly intervals of a mucosanguineous\r\nsecretion. This discharge is not merely the result of a local hyperaemic\r\ncondition, but is the expression of a periodic excitation of the entire\r\nnervous system and blood vascular system, intimately related with the\r\nwhole sexual life of woman; this excitation is itself dependent upon the\r\nprocess of ovulation, an incident in the series of manifestations that\r\narise from the periodic undulatory movement in the vital processes of\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nThe Mosaic law regarded the process of menstruation as unclean in\r\nnature; the menstruating woman was unclean, and must be purified in a\r\nprescribed manner. In the fifteenth chapter of Leviticus, vv. 19–29, we\r\nread: “And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be\r\nblood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her\r\nshall be unclean until the even. * * * Every bed whereon she lieth all\r\nthe days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her\r\nseparation. * * * But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall\r\nnumber to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean. And on\r\nthe eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young\r\npigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle\r\nof the congregation.”\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner the adherents of the faith of Islam regard a\r\nmenstruating woman as unclean.\r\n\r\nThis view is found also in the earliest medical writings, alike in the\r\nearly Indian book of _Susruta_ and in the later writings of\r\n_Hippocrates_, and it persists to the present day in the use of the\r\nexpression “monthly purification.” _Susruta_ teaches that in India\r\nmenstruation begins at the age of twelve, and recurs monthly, the flow\r\nlasting three days. In the Jewish Talmud it is asserted (see “La\r\nMédécine du Talmud,” by _Dr. Rabbinowicz_) that menstruation begins as\r\nsoon as the girl has two hairs on the pubic region, or at the age of\r\ntwelve, even in the absence of any growth of the pubic hair. The\r\nmenstrual blood is quite peculiar in its characters. Thus, _Raschi_\r\nrelates, the mother of the King of Persia exhibited sixty varieties of\r\nblood, and among them _Rabba_ was able to detect which was the menstrual\r\nblood. According to a rabbinical authority, a woman can become pregnant\r\nas soon as she has completed her twelfth year. As signs of puberty,\r\n_Rabbi Jossé_ mentions the appearance of a fold beneath the nipple,\r\n_Rabbi Akiba_, the erection of the nipples, _Rabbi d’Azai_, the\r\nappearance of a dark areola around the nipples, _Rabbi Jossé_, the\r\nrecession of the nipple under pressure followed by its gradual\r\nprotrusion when the pressure is removed, also the softening of the mons\r\nVeneris (in consequence of the deposit of fat in its substance). As\r\nprodromal signs of the first appearance of menstruation, the Talmud\r\nmentions, pain in the region of the umbilicus and in the uterus,\r\nflatulence, shivering, white flux, heaviness in the head and the limbs,\r\nand nausea.\r\n\r\nThe blood discharged during menstruation has certain peculiar\r\nproperties. It is always fluid, and rarely contains fibrinous clots, it\r\nis always mixed with a larger or smaller quantity of mucus, which gives\r\nit a sticky character; the reaction is alkaline, the smell\r\ncharacteristic. Only when the bleeding is very profuse are coagulated\r\nmasses evacuated. On microscopical examination of menstrual blood, we\r\ndetect erythrocytes and leucocytes, the proportional number of the\r\nlatter being greater than in pure blood; there is an admixture also of\r\nepithelium from the genital mucous membranes, cylindrical cells from the\r\nuterus, flattened cells from the superficial layers of the stratified\r\nscaly epithelium of the vagina, also various micro-organisms and\r\ngranular detritus. At the beginning of each menstruation, the admixture\r\nof mucus is greatest, so that the discharge sometimes has the appearance\r\nof blood-stained mucus; but during the height of the discharge the\r\nconsistency is almost that of pure blood. The quantity of blood lost at\r\neach period is said to vary from 90 to 240 grammes (about 3 to 8 fluid\r\nounces); but in tropical climates the average is said to be 600 grammes\r\n(20 ounces). According to the accurate analysis of _Denis_, menstrual\r\nfluid contains in a thousand parts:\r\n\r\n   Total solid constituents                                   175.00\r\n                            Comprising\r\n                                       Fat               3.90\r\n                                       Blood-corpuscles 64.40\r\n                                       Albumin          48.30\r\n                                       Extractives       1.10\r\n                                       Salts            12.00\r\n                                       Mucus            45.30\r\n                                                        —————\r\n   Water                                                      825.00\r\n                                                              ——————\r\n\r\nBoth the quality and the quantity of the blood are subject to great\r\nvariations. Thus, for instance, _Bouchardat_ estimates the solid\r\nconstituents at 99.20 per mille, _Vogel_ at 161 per mille, and _Simon_\r\nat 215 per mille. The amount of blood discharged during menstruation\r\ndepends upon the temperament, the constitution, and the occupation, of\r\nthe woman concerned. It is greater in vivacious brunettes than in\r\nphlegmatic blondes, greater in southern women than in those dwelling in\r\nthe north, greater in town dwellers than in women living in the open\r\nplains, greater in those whose mode of life is sedentary than in those\r\nengaged in some active occupation.\r\n\r\nSimilar considerations apply with regard to the duration of each period.\r\nThe mean duration is in the great majority of cases from four to five\r\ndays, being generally the same in successive periods in the same\r\nindividual; in exceptional cases the flow may last a week or more.\r\nMenstruation lasting more than eight days must be regarded as abnormal.\r\n\r\n_Krieger_ has collected data relating to the duration of the individual\r\nperiods. He found the duration constant in the great majority of cases,\r\n_i. e._, 93.285 per cent.; but variable in a small minority, _i. e._,\r\n6.715 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe periods in which the duration was regular did not always last\r\nprecisely the same number of days, the duration in many cases being 3 to\r\n4 days, 5 to 6 days, etc.; but the same duration recurred regularly at\r\neach successive period, so that all these instances must be reckoned\r\namong the periods of regular duration. The duration must be regarded as\r\nirregular or variable in those cases in which the variation was from 2\r\nto 4 days, 3 to 8 days, etc. Sometimes a regular three-day or five-day\r\nperiod becomes transformed into an eight-day period; or conversely an\r\neight-day period into a four-day period.\r\n\r\nAmong the cases in which the duration was regular, it amounted\r\n\r\n    Most frequently to 8 days, in                  26.695 per cent.\r\n    Next in frequency was a duration of 3 days, in 20.762 per cent.\r\n    Next, a duration of 4 days, in                 16.949 per cent.\r\n    Next, a duration of 5 days, in                 11.864 per cent.\r\n\r\n_L. Mayer_ has also drawn a distinction between constant and variable\r\nduration of the menstrual periods. Among 4,927 women, he found 4,542\r\n(92.185%) in whom the duration was constant, and 385 (7.815%) in whom it\r\nwas variable. Of the constant periods, the duration was:\r\n\r\n           8 days in 1182 women, that is in 26.024 per cent.\r\n           4 days in  829 women, that is in 18.252 per cent.\r\n           3 days in  731 women, that is in 16.094 per cent.\r\n           5 days in  730 women, that is in 16.072 per cent.\r\n\r\nAn extremely short duration, less than 24 hours, was found in 70 women,\r\nan extremely long duration, 7 to 14 days, was found in 175 women, and\r\nfinally a duration exceeding 14 days was found in 19 women.\r\n\r\nThe mean duration in these cases was 5.387 days.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by _Szukits_, who investigated the duration of the\r\nperiods in 1,013 women, are somewhat divergent from the above. He found:\r\n\r\n A duration of a few hours only in    95 women, that is in  9.38 per cent.\r\n A duration of 1 to 2 days in         66 women, that is in  6.51 per cent.\r\n A duration of 3 days in             407 women, that is in 40.17 per cent.\r\n A duration of 4 days in             171 women, that is in 16.88 per cent.\r\n A duration of 5 to 6 days in        115 women, that is in 11.35 per cent.\r\n A duration of 7 to 8 days in        118 women, that is in 11.63 per cent.\r\n A duration of 9 days and upwards in  41 women, that is in  4.05 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe mean duration in these cases was 3.87 days.\r\n\r\nThe mean duration of the menstrual flow is:\r\n\r\n         In Paris      5   days.\r\n         In London     4.6 days.\r\n         In Berlin     4.5 days.\r\n         In Copenhagen 4.3 days (according to Mayer, 5.3 days).\r\n         In Austria    3.8 days.\r\n\r\nThe interval between one menstruation and the next (the period that\r\nelapses, that is to say, between the commencement of one period and the\r\ncommencement of the next) is in the great majority of cases twenty-eight\r\ndays. The recurrence in many women is extraordinarily exact, not merely\r\nas regards the day, but even as regards the hour of the day. The\r\ntwenty-eight-day type of menstruation is found in about 70 per cent. of\r\nthe cases; in the remainder, the thirty-day type is most frequent, and\r\nnext to that the twenty-one-day type. The periodicity of menstruation in\r\nany individual may however be very irregular.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of blood lost during menstruation varies within wide\r\nlimits; according to approximate estimates the usual loss at a single\r\nperiod is from 90 to 240 grammes (about 3 to 8 fluid ounces). The\r\nfollowing summary statement is made by _Krieger_ regarding the quantity\r\nlost in different social circumstances and in various nationalities:\r\n\r\nThe amount of blood lost and the duration of the flow are less in\r\nstrong, healthy women, leading an occupied, active, and regular life,\r\nespecially in countrywomen and in women who are poor and chaste, than it\r\nis in delicate, weakly women, leading a sedentary life, whose diet is\r\nabundant and stimulating, and who are accustomed to an ultra-luxurious\r\nand enervating existence. In nuns, for example, the quantity of the\r\nmenstrual discharge gradually declines; shortly after their entrance\r\ninto the cloister, various irregularities are apt to occur, but\r\nultimately the flow becomes exceedingly scanty and lasts for a single\r\nday only. Climate also has a great influence, for in hot countries women\r\nusually menstruate very abundantly, whilst in cold countries the flow is\r\nscanty, and often appears only in the warmer months of the year. Of the\r\nLapp and Samoyede women this was already reported by _Linnæus_ and\r\n_Virey_. _Tilt_ further relates that Eskimo women menstruate only during\r\nthe summer months, and even then scantily. In southern France, according\r\nto _Courty_, the quantity varies from 120 to 240 grammes (about 4 to 8\r\nounces); but it may rise to 300, 350, and even to 500 grammes (about 10,\r\n12, and 16½ fluid ounces). In the tropics, severe menorrhagia is said to\r\nbe common; and the fact was already known to _Blumbenbach_, that women\r\nof European descent born in the tropics not infrequently succumb to\r\nhæmorrhage during childbirth.\r\n\r\n_L. Mayer_ has endeavored to determine the relations between the\r\nquantity and the quality of the discharge, and distinguishes the regular\r\ncomposition, when a considerable quantity of dark-tinted, fluid blood is\r\npassed, from the irregular composition, when a small quantity of blood,\r\nusually pale in color, is passed, or an excessive quantity of dark\r\nblood, often coagulated, or a discharge of varying composition.\r\n\r\nOf 4,542 women questioned by _Mayer_ in regard to this matter, there\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n 2,998, that is 66.006 per cent., in whom the composition was regular.\r\n 1,544, that is 33.994 per cent., in whom the composition was irregular.\r\n\r\nand among the latter the discharge was\r\n\r\n   Scanty and for the most part pale in 511; that is 12.250 per cent.\r\n   Profuse or profuse and coagulated in 838; that is 18.428 per cent.\r\n   Variable in                          196; that is  4.315 per cent.\r\n\r\nInvestigation regarding the individual variations that occur in this\r\nrespect among women, showed that blondes usually menstruate more\r\nprofusely than brunettes, and that in the former also the duration of\r\nthe individual periods is longer.\r\n\r\nThe loss of blood must be considered less in respect of its absolute\r\nquantity than in respect of the effect which continued observation shows\r\nits loss to have upon the organism. If the loss of blood continues to\r\nhave an effect after the flow has ceased, if a woman recovers but\r\nslowly, or even fails to recover fully from one loss before another\r\nbegins, if symptoms of increasing anæmia become apparent, the bleeding\r\nmust be regarded as a pathological perversion of normal menstruation.\r\nPathological is it also if the menstrual flow does not exhibit the\r\nnormal slowly rising and slowly declining curve, but sets in profusely,\r\nceases or almost ceases for a time, and then again suddenly recurs. In\r\nsome cases the flow is not profuse, but lasts for a long time, and owing\r\nto this long duration it has a debilitating effect, especially in anæmic\r\nand chlorotic individuals.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, in normal menstruation, the admixture of the alkaline\r\ncervical mucus suffices to keep the menstrual discharge fluid and to\r\nprevent the formation of fibrin. On the other hand, the discharge of\r\ncoagulated masses of blood will alone suffice to indicate an abnormally\r\nfree and rapid flow of blood.\r\n\r\nThe commonest type of menstruation is the more or less regular\r\nrecurrence of the flow at intervals of twenty-eight days. Variations in\r\nthis respect are, however, very frequent, and are dependent upon\r\nconstitution, position in life, and race. In general it may be said that\r\nin persons of strong constitution, the type of menstruation is much more\r\nregular, than in persons of a weakly, delicate constitution; that in\r\nvivacious, ardent natures the menses more readily anticipate the\r\nexpected period of their return, whereas in those of a flaccid,\r\nlymphatic temperament a retardation is more likely to occur; and that\r\namongst women of the upper classes of society the type of menstruation\r\nis far more frequently irregular than amongst women of the working\r\nclasses and amongst countrywomen. Whereas in many women the regularity\r\nof the menstrual rhythm is so precise that the flow recurs, not merely\r\nat regular intervals of twenty-eight days, but even time after time at\r\nexactly the same hour of the day—in other cases the interval between two\r\nperiods may vary from twenty-one to thirty days.\r\n\r\n_L. Mayer_, who made observations on the type of menstruation in 5,671\r\nwomen, and tabulated his results, distinguishes between constant and\r\ninconstant intervals. Among the constant intervals he enumerates those\r\nforms, both regular and irregular, which do not during the whole life of\r\nthe individual undergo transformation into another form, but remain\r\nalways of the same type. If, for instance, in any individual the\r\ninterval is always either two or eight weeks, in that woman menstruation\r\nis indeed irregular, but constant in type. If, however, for some years\r\nshe menstruates at intervals either of two or of eight weeks, and then\r\nproceeds to menstruate at intervals of four weeks, her menstruation is\r\nof the inconstant type. _Mayer_ found among his 5,671 cases\r\n\r\n      The constant type in 4,981 women, that is in 87.83 per cent.\r\n      The inconstant type in 690 women, that is in 12.16 per cent.\r\n\r\nOf the cases in which the type was constant there were 69.68 per cent.\r\nin which the regular period of four weeks obtained, and 20.31 per cent.\r\nin which it was irregular in the sense above defined. Among these\r\nlatter, the commonest periods were 15 to 21 days and 22 to 27 days. The\r\nsame author observed the irregular type of menstruation in nearly\r\none-fourth of the women belonging to the well-to-do classes.\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations of _Krieger_ on 481 cases in which the\r\nperiods were regular, that is, in which the intervals in each case were\r\nequal in duration, the time from the commencement of one period to the\r\ncommencement of the next was:\r\n\r\n                       28 days in 70.80 per cent.\r\n                       30 days in 13.74 per cent.\r\n                       21 days in  1.66 per cent.\r\n                       27 days in  1.45 per cent.\r\n\r\nAs regards the season in which menstruation first appears, _Krieger_\r\nstates that in one-half of the women examined by him menstruation had\r\nbegun in the autumn season, in the month of September, October, or\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n_Szukits_, as a result of an investigation into the menstrual functions\r\nof Austrian women, determined that among 1,013 women menstruation\r\noccurred:\r\n\r\n                 Every 28 to 30 days in     642 women.\r\n                 Every 8 to 21 days in      169 women.\r\n                 Every 35 to 56 days in     128 women.\r\n                 And was quite irregular in  74 women.\r\n\r\nIn 500 Jewish women, _Hirsch_ found that menstruation occurred:\r\n\r\n      23 days after the beginning of the last menstruation in  19\r\n      24 days after the beginning of the last menstruation in  29\r\n      25 days after the beginning of the last menstruation in  36\r\n      26 days after the beginning of the last menstruation in  56\r\n      27 days after the beginning of the last menstruation in  62\r\n      28 days after the beginning of the last menstruation in  73\r\n                                                              ———\r\n                                                              275\r\n                                                              ===\r\n\r\nand in the remaining cases at other intervals than those stated. He is,\r\ntherefore, of opinion that in the majority of Jewish women the type of\r\nmenstruation is shorter then twenty-nine days.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Brierre de Boismont_, among 100 women menstruation\r\nrecurred:\r\n\r\n             Every 4 weeks in                    61 women.\r\n             Every 3 weeks in                    28 women.\r\n             Every 2 weeks in                     1 woman.\r\n             And at various irregular periods in 10 women.\r\n\r\n_Tilt_ found among 100 women that menstruation recurred:\r\n\r\n                       Every 4 weeks in 77 women.\r\n                       Every 3 weeks in 17 women.\r\n                       Every 2 weeks in  1 woman.\r\n                       Every 6 weeks in  5 women.\r\n\r\n_Foster_ instituted inquiries regarding this matter in 56 healthy women.\r\nIn 380 periods, 45 recurred after an interval of 28 days, 225 after a\r\nshorter interval than this, 110 after a longer interval. The duration of\r\nthe flow varied from 1 to 14 days; most commonly it lasted from 3 to 5\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nA peculiar change in the type of menstruation sometimes manifests itself\r\nin this way, that in women in whom the regular four-weekly type of\r\nmenstruation has prevailed, exactly in the middle of this four-weekly\r\nperiod the menstrual molimina, with or without menstrual discharge, make\r\ntheir appearance; the patient suffers from pain in the lower belly,\r\nsacrache, sensation of weight, and bearing-down pains. _Courty_,\r\n_Dubois_, and _Pajot Négrier_ have described such cases of _molimen\r\nutérin intermenstruel_, which _Tilt_ denotes by the term _remittent\r\nmenstruation_.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times the process of menstruation has attracted the\r\nattention of natural philosophers, and has led them to formulate\r\nhypotheses and to institute investigations, especially in order to\r\nascertain whether the connection between ovulation and menstruation is\r\none of temporal succession merely, or whether the relation is a causal\r\none.\r\n\r\nFrom _Hippocrates_ and _Galen_ downwards until well beyond the middle\r\nages, the view of the father of medicine was generally accepted, that\r\nmenstruation is a purificatory process by means of which materials\r\nharmful to the organism are eliminated from the body—a view which finds\r\nexpression also in the religious and legal ordinances of all times.\r\n\r\nA new epoch of scientific research into the nature of menstruation began\r\nwith _de Graaf’s_ discovery of the ovarian follicles (1672). This\r\ndiscovery did not, indeed, bring ovulation and menstruation into\r\nimmediate relationship, but it certainly paved the way for the opinion\r\nexpressed by _Sintemma_, a countryman of _de Graaf_, that the ova, even\r\nin virgins, leave the ovary spontaneously, and by their contact with the\r\ncapillary terminations of the bloodvessels give rise to the menstrual\r\nbleeding (1728).\r\n\r\nAs a result of anatomical investigations, _Négrier_, in 1840, was the\r\nfirst to establish the thesis that in women suffering from congenital\r\nabsence of the ovaries, menstruation never occurs; that after the loss\r\nof the ovaries, menstruation always ceases; that during pregnancy and\r\nlactation and during the climacteric period, ovulation ceases; and that\r\na relation of temporal succession obtains between ovulation and\r\nmenstruation. This close relation between the two processes was\r\nmaintained also by _Gendrin_ at about the same date. Later, _Girdwood_,\r\nby post mortem research, proved that the number of scars in the ovary\r\ncoincides with the number of previous menstruations.\r\n\r\n_Brierre de Boismont_, in his exhaustive work on _Menstruation_, lays\r\nstress on the view that the periodically recurring ovulation furnishes\r\nthe impulse for the menstrual flow. First among German investigators,\r\n_Bischoff_ upheld the opinion that maturation and discharge of ova are\r\nspontaneous processes occurring independently of sexual intercourse, and\r\ncompared heat or rut in other animals to menstruation in women—a view\r\nshared by _Pouchet_ and _Coste_. Ovulation occurs simultaneously with\r\nthe menstrual flow, and the follicles burst toward the end of\r\nmenstruation.\r\n\r\n_Pflüger_, in his important work on the significance and cause of\r\nmenstruation, has demonstrated the causal connection between\r\nmenstruation and ovulation. The bleeding and the discharge of the ova\r\nare according to him joint effects of a common cause. It is not the\r\nbursting of the follicle, but the ripening of the follicle, that gives\r\nrise to the menstrual congestion. The pressure of the growing follicle\r\non the surrounding ovarian tissue gives rise to a continued stimulation\r\nof the ovarian nerves; the summation of these stimuli, which after the\r\nlapse of a certain time attain always a certain degree of intensity,\r\nresults in a reflex from the spinal cord taking the form of great\r\ncongestion of the genital organs; this congestion leads, on the one\r\nhand, to hæmorrhage from the uterine mucous membrane, and, on the other\r\nhand, and as a rule simultaneously, to the bursting of the ovarian\r\nfollicle. The swelling and granulation of the uterine mucous membrane at\r\nevery menstrual period signifies nothing else than the commencement of\r\nthe formation of the decidua.\r\n\r\n_Nägele_ already mentioned the view, that inasmuch as immediately after\r\nthe first appearance of menstruation a woman has become capable of\r\nreproducing the species, each process of menstruation must be regarded\r\nas a renewal of the exhausted faculty for conception.\r\n\r\n_Pflüger’s_ teaching has been opposed by _Sigismund_, who, whilst\r\nadmitting the periodicity of ovulation and menstruation, yet regards the\r\ntwo processes, in the uterus the formation of the menstrual decidua, in\r\nthe ovary the rupture of the graafian follicle, as independent of one\r\nanother, even though they occur simultaneously. Should fertilization\r\noccur, the ovum implants itself in the prepared soil; should\r\nfertilization fail to occur, the menstrual hæmorrhage ensues. Thus, the\r\noccurrence of menstruation indicates that fertilization of the ovum has\r\nfailed to occur. On this theory, then, the ovum that is fertilized\r\nbelongs to the first period missed, whereas _Pflüger_ assumes that when\r\npregnancy occurs, it is always the ovum belonging to the time of the\r\nprevious menstruation—the last actual menstrual discharge—that is\r\nfertilized.\r\n\r\n_Löwenhardt_, in his work on the _Diagnosis and Duration of Pregnancy_,\r\nadvances the same views as _Sigismund_. The fertilized ovum, in his\r\nopinion also, is that of the first period missed; and since at the time\r\nat which he believes fertilization to occur the ovum is certainly still\r\nin the ovary, fertilization, on this theory, must always take place in\r\nthe ovary itself, and the fertilized ovum cannot begin its intra-uterine\r\nlife till a month has elapsed after fertilization. _Reichert_,\r\n_Kundrat_, _Engelmann_, and _Williams_, basing their views on anatomical\r\ndata, are of opinion that ovulation recurs periodically, and that the\r\nextrusion of the ovum occurs not before but after the commencement of\r\nmenstruation.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Hensen_, the observed facts support the view that the\r\nfollicles burst as a rule toward the end of menstruation; anticipation\r\nor postponement of the opening of the follicle (conception before or\r\nafter menstruation) would, however, appear not to be impossible.\r\n\r\n_Leopold_, who assumes that menstruation may occur without ovulation and\r\novulation without menstruation, maintains on anatomical grounds that the\r\nrupture of the graafian follicle occurs chiefly during menstruation,\r\nunder the influence of the swelling due to menstrual congestion.\r\nMenstruation with ovulation he believes to be a common occurrence,\r\nmenstruation without ovulation, an unusual occurrence. Further, it is\r\ncertain that, at the time when the periodic bleeding is due, ovulation\r\nmay occur, even though the menstrual discharge fails to make its\r\nappearance (ovulation without menstruation).\r\n\r\n_Chazan_ and _Gläveke_ also adhere to the generally accepted view that\r\novulation is a periodic process, usually but not necessarily synchronous\r\nwith menstruation.\r\n\r\n_Strassmann_ bases on clinical facts and on experiments the following\r\nview of the connection between ovulation and menstruation. The principal\r\nprocesses in the organism of the sexually mature woman run their course\r\nin a periodic rhythm resembling an undulatory movement, the acme of\r\nwhich occurs in the antemenstrual period with the aim of preparing for\r\nthe development of an infantile organism. Whilst an ovum is maturing in\r\nthe ovary, in the uterus, in dependence upon this maturation, the\r\nantemenstrual mucous membrane, fitted for the reception and nutrition of\r\nthe fertilized ovum, is also undergoing development. At the acme of the\r\nundulatory movement, the graafian follicle ruptures and the ovum is\r\nliberated, to undergo fertilization in the infundibulum of the Fallopian\r\ntube. If fertilization fails to occur, or if for any reason the graafian\r\nfollicle fails to rupture, then, in consequence of and at the time of\r\nthe highest intra-ovarian tension, at the time, when the rupture of the\r\nfollicle usually occurs, the extrusion of blood from the capillaries of\r\nthe uterine mucous membrane begins. The intermediation between the ovary\r\nand the uterus is probably effected by means of the sympathetic ganglion\r\nin the ovary discovered by _Elizabeth Winterhalter_, and effected in\r\nthis manner, that the stimulus proceeding from the ripening follicle\r\npasses along the nerve-fibrils surrounding the follicle to the processes\r\nof the nerve cells of this sympathetic ganglion, accumulating in these\r\ncells till a certain degree of intensity has been reached, and then, by\r\nmeans of other processes and of the vasomotor nerves, influencing the\r\nvessels of the uterus.\r\n\r\n_Gebhard_ likewise believes menstruation to be dependent on the ovarian\r\nfunction, and thinks that it is probably brought about in a reflex\r\nmanner by the gradual growth of the ovarian follicles. It appears that\r\nmost commonly at the time of menstruation a graafian follicle ripe to\r\nbursting is to be found in the ovary, but to this rule there are many\r\nexceptions. We cannot exclude the possibility, that the ovum from a\r\nfollicle that burst after the commencement of the menstrual flow may be\r\nfertilized; but more commonly the ovum that is fertilized is that of the\r\nfirst period missed. The sudden decline in vital energy that occurs just\r\nbefore menstruation is explained by _Gebhard_ as a kind of atavism,\r\ndependent on the fact that many of the lower animals, butterflies, for\r\ninstance, succumb as soon as they have fulfilled their duty of\r\nreproducing the species.\r\n\r\nA number of modern investigators, however, deny that any relation,\r\ntemporal or causal, exists between ovulation and menstruation, and\r\naffirm that the latter process is quite independent of the former.\r\n\r\nThus, _Christopher Martin_ maintains that a special menstrual centre\r\nexists in the lumbar portion of the spinal cord, the impulses from which\r\nproceed to the uterus by way of the splanchnic plexus, the ovarian\r\nplexus, or perhaps by both. Similar views are held by _Lawson Tait_,\r\n_Collins_, and _Johnstone_, who severally maintain that the ovaries are\r\nno more concerned in the production of menstruation than any other organ\r\nof the body—the liver, for instance. They direct attention to the\r\nperiodicity that occurs in the functional activity of various other\r\norgans, in respiratory and cardiac activity, for instance, both of which\r\nundergo rhythmical changes as a result of nervous influences. The\r\ncessation of menstruation after oöphorectomy they attribute, not to the\r\ncessation of ovulation, but to the division of the nerves which run\r\nacross the broad ligaments of the uterus and upon which menstruation\r\ndepends. Heat and rut in animals have a different significance from\r\nmenstruation. The latter process is induced by civilization and by the\r\nadoption of the upright posture.\r\n\r\nBut, taking all this into consideration, we must hold fast to the\r\nfundamental principles, that ovulation occurs at that period of life,\r\nand only at that period, during which menstruation proceeds regularly;\r\nthat ovulation begins when externally and in the whole development of\r\nthe girl the signs of sexual maturity manifest themselves; and that\r\novulation ceases at the climacteric, when menstruation also ceases. We\r\nmust regard as rare exceptions to this rule cases in which ovulation\r\nbegins before the menarche and persists after the menopause.\r\n\r\nA physiological interruption of menstruation occurs during pregnancy and\r\nlactation; it seems improbable, however, that during this interval\r\novulation also is in abeyance. It is established by anatomical\r\ninvestigations that ovulation and menstruation commonly occur in\r\nassociation; but that menstruation sometimes, though rarely, occurs in\r\nthe absence of ovulation; and, finally, that intermenstrual ovulation is\r\nalso a rare occurrence. In the majority of cases, either just before or\r\njust after the commencement of the menstrual flow, rupture of a graafian\r\nfollicle occurs. After complete oöphorectomy, menstruation ceases; it is\r\nonly when functionally active portions of ovarian tissue have been left\r\nbehind, that menstruation continues to occur. In the absence of the\r\novaries, the menstrual function is in abeyance; hence, for the\r\nperformance of that function, the presence of ripening ovarian follicles\r\nand of other follicles capable of ripening later, is an indispensable\r\nrequisite.\r\n\r\nA certain analogy between heat and rut in animals and menstruation in\r\nwomen may, according to the investigations of _Bischoff_, _Hegar_,\r\n_Strassmann_, and others, certainly be maintained. Heat or rut is a\r\nprocess occurring in mammals, dependent on the reproductive glands,\r\ncharacterized by an increase in sexual and general excitability, with\r\ncongestion of the pudendum and the vagina, swelling of the sebaceous\r\nglands of the external genitals, and increased secretion; from the\r\nvulval cleft there flows a peculiar, strong-smelling mucus, often tinted\r\nred from admixture with blood; there is frequent micturition, the\r\nuterine glands are swollen, the Fallopian tubes are also swollen, and\r\nare soft and erected. A well-developed menstrual bleeding, analogous to\r\nthat which occurs in the human species, occurs, among the lower animals,\r\nonly in apes. Maturation of ova precedes the period of heat, and rupture\r\nof the graafian follicle occurs during that period.\r\n\r\nHeat or rut occurs in animals at certain seasons of the year, which may,\r\naccording to the species and the mode of life of the animal concerned,\r\nbe in spring, summer, autumn, or winter. The season of heat or rut has\r\nfurther several periods of heat, each lasting several days, and among\r\ndomesticated animals, mares, cows, and bitches, succeeding one another\r\nat intervals of three or four weeks; in wild animals, rut occurs once\r\nonly in the year. In animals, sexual intercourse takes place during the\r\ntime of the menstrual discharge, and during this time also the capacity\r\nfor conception is increased; in the absence of heat, the genital organs\r\nare in a more quiescent condition. In this connection, the experiments\r\non animals made by _Strassmann_, with a view to determining the\r\ninfluence upon the uterus of rise of pressure in the ovary, are of great\r\ninterest; these experiments showed that a rise of intra-ovarian\r\npressure, produced by the injection of fluid into the parenchyma of the\r\novary, led to changes in the endometrium and the external genital organs\r\ncorresponding to those occurring in an animal on heat.\r\n\r\nIn the human species, however, in contradistinction to what occurs in\r\nthe lower animals, there is a certain disinclination, on the part of the\r\nmale at any rate, to sexual intercourse during menstruation. The human\r\nfemale moreover, notwithstanding the periodicity of her sexual life, is\r\nat all times capable of conception; this capability is not confined to\r\nany particular part of the intermenstrual period, for conception may\r\noccur at any time during that period, and has even been known to result\r\nfrom intercourse during menstruation. This peculiar characteristic of\r\nthe human reproductive capacity has been regarded as compensatory,\r\nfurnished by nature in her continual endeavour for the perpetuation of\r\nthe species, to counteract the restricting influences imposed by\r\ncivilization on the normal process of reproduction.\r\n\r\nCredible observations even exist, indicating that among many primitive\r\npeoples, in whom at the time of puberty no social laws hinder the\r\nlimitless exercise of the reproductive functions, this capacity on the\r\npart of woman to conceive at any time has no existence, and that the\r\nreproductive capacity of such human beings is, like that of the lower\r\nanimals, confined to a certain season of the year. Thus, _G.\r\nSchlesinger_ reports of the Ainus of the island of Yezo, “A friend of\r\nmine in Sapporo believes himself to have observed that the Ainus have a\r\ncertain definite rutting period, and that in them, as in many of the\r\nlower animals, the process of reproducing the species occurs only at a\r\ncertain season of the year.” An identical statement is current\r\nconcerning the Indians of Western America.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane of the uterus undergoes during menstruation\r\nimportant changes, and a question much disputed is, whether in the\r\ncourse of menstruation the whole of the uterine mucous membrane is\r\nremoved, or a part only, whether it is shed in its entire thickness, or\r\nis at least deprived of its epithelium. According to the observations\r\nmade by _Leopold_ on dead bodies, the mucous membrane of the uterus\r\nbecomes swollen shortly before the commencement of the menstrual\r\ndischarge, until, partly in consequence of cellular proliferation,\r\npartly in consequence of œdematous infiltration, and partly in\r\nconsequence of enlargement of the lymph-spaces, it attains a thickness\r\nof 6 to 7 millimetres (¼ of an inch). The superficial capillaries are\r\nnotably enlarged, and an effusion of blood-elements continues for\r\nseveral days, without the occurrence of any fatty degeneration in the\r\ntissues. The epithelium and the most superficial cell-layers of the\r\nmucous membrane are, however, undermined and shed. No complete\r\ndestruction of the mucous membrane occurs, however, and fatty\r\ndegeneration forms no part of the menstrual process as such.\r\n\r\n_Möricke_, who examined portions of the uterine mucous membrane removed\r\nwith the curette during menstruation from living women, found the\r\nsuperficial layers of the mucous membrane to be intact, and he regards\r\nthe shedding of the epithelium described by other authorities as\r\ncadaveric phenomenon. _Sinéty_, who also found the uterine mucous\r\nmembrane intact during menstruation, adheres to the same view.\r\n\r\n_Von Kahlden_ concludes, as a result of investigations made post mortem,\r\nthat during menstruation the greater part of the mucous membrane, not\r\nthe superficial epithelium only, but the stroma itself down to its\r\ndeepest layers, is shed. According to _von Tassenbroek_ and _Mendes le\r\nLeon_, however, the most superficial layers only are shed during\r\nmenstruation.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Westphalen_, whose investigations were made, partly on\r\nmasses removed by the curette, and partly on freshly extirpated uteri, a\r\nsanguineo-serous infiltration of the mucous membrane begins about ten\r\ndays before menstruation. Great vascular dilatation occurs only just\r\nbefore menstruation. The uterine glands undergo enlargement, and during\r\nand immediately after the flow, numerous shed epithelium cells occupy\r\nthe lumen of the glands. For the rest, however, in the interior of the\r\nuterus shortly after menstruation, we find an almost continuous\r\nepithelial covering. Some days after menstruation, the proper\r\nregeneration of the mucous membrane occurs.\r\n\r\n_Mandl_, who examined totally extirpated uteri, asserts that during\r\nmenstruation the epithelial covering of the mucous membrane is never\r\ncompletely lost, but that just as little does it remain completely\r\nintact. The regeneration of the lost areas of epithelium proceeds even\r\nduring menstruation.\r\n\r\nThe researches of _Kundrat_ and _Engelmann_ on uteri obtained post\r\nmortem led these authors to describe as follows the anatomical changes\r\nthat occur in the uterine mucous membrane at the time of the catamenial\r\nhæmorrhage. In the premenstrual epoch a round-cell infiltration occurs\r\nin the interglandular tissue, the lumina of the uterine glands become\r\nenlarged, and the bloodvessels dilated; subsequently, fatty degeneration\r\nof the superficial epithelium and the epithelium of the glands occurs,\r\nleading to laceration of the vessels and destruction of the affected\r\narea of tissue; after the cessation of the bleeding, regeneration of the\r\nmucous membrane occurs.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Gebhard_, three stages may be distinguished. The first\r\nstage is that of premenstrual congestion, or stage of engorgement: the\r\ncapillary vessels of the mucous membrane become distended with blood,\r\nthe membrane itself becomes softened, the meshes of the stroma become\r\nenlarged and are filled with the morphological constituents of the\r\nblood, subepithelial hæmatomata are formed. The second stage is that in\r\nwhich the blood finds its way to the exterior: owing to the turgescence\r\nof the mucous membrane the blood is able to exude between the cells of\r\nthe intact epithelium; further, the epithelium becomes lacerated in\r\nvarious places where hæmatomata have formed beneath it, allowing the\r\nblood to exude through the apertures thus formed; shreds of epithelium\r\nmay be washed away by the blood-stream. The third stage is that of\r\npost-menstrual regeneration: the swelling of the mucous membrane\r\ndisappears, the detached areas of epithelium readhere, the blood effused\r\ninto the interstices of the tissue is reabsorbed, or is in part\r\ntransformed into yellowish-brown flakes of pigment. According to\r\n_Gebhard’s_ view, during menstruation destruction of the uterine mucous\r\nmembrane does not occur. At no time is the membrane denuded of large\r\nareas of epithelium; a very active process of regeneration occurs,\r\nhowever, in the superficial epithelium and the epithelium of the glands,\r\nwhich fits the uterine mucosa for the reception of the fertilized ovum\r\nby keeping it in an ever-young and renovated condition. The mucous\r\nmembrane of the cervix takes part in menstruation at most by an\r\nincreased secretion of mucus.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Landau_ and _Rheinstein_, the mucous membrane of the\r\nFallopian tubes contributes to the menstrual hæmorrhage; _Fritsch_ and\r\n_Strassmann_, however, are opposed to the view that there is a regular\r\ntubal menstruation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Pathology of Menstruation._\r\n\r\nOnly a small proportion of girls and women are entirely free, at the\r\ntime of menstruation, from all change both in their bodily and in their\r\nmental state. A very great majority complain of feeling more or less\r\nunwell, of sensations of weight and pressure in the hypogastric region,\r\nof a general feeling of languor, loss of appetite, headache,\r\nirritability, sometimes of an inclination to weep; in women, a change in\r\nthe intensity of the sexual impulse manifests itself, an increase in\r\nsome, a decrease in others.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently during menstruation, the cardiac activity is notably\r\naffected, so that, regularly at the commencement of each period,\r\ndisagreeable sensations occur in the cardiac region, with increased\r\nfrequency of the heart’s action; or complaint is made of coldness and\r\ndampness of the hands, of icy coldness of the feet, which feel as if\r\n“dead” to half way up the calves, and cannot be warmed—phenomena which,\r\nin the cases under consideration, occur only at the time of\r\nmenstruation, and are to be regarded as manifestations of the menstrual\r\nreflex.\r\n\r\nI examined 140 women in whom the heart and the vascular system were\r\nnormal, during a number of successive menstrual periods, and in 12 of\r\nthese women, either at the commencement or during the course of the\r\nflow, I observed an increase in the frequency of the heart to the extent\r\nof from 12 to 28 beats per minute; in young girls, a systolic murmur was\r\nsometimes audible during menstruation, but was inaudible in the\r\nintermenstrual intervals. In all these persons, menstruation was\r\nregular; there was no abnormality in respect either of the duration or\r\nof the quantity of the flow. The heart in these cases was, therefore,\r\naffected by the normal menstrual process.\r\n\r\nA remarkable illustration of the alleged influence of menstrual\r\ndisturbances on the pulse is reported by _de Villeneuve_, who states\r\nthat Chinese physicians, being accustomed to feel the pulse in many\r\ndifferent arteries, are able, by a comparison of the characters of the\r\npulse in the two arms, to determine whether a woman menstruates\r\nregularly or irregularly.\r\n\r\nMany women and girls show well-marked menstrual molimina, uneasy or\r\nactually painful local sensations in the genital organs, sacrache,\r\npainful uterine contractions, and disturbances of the general\r\nconstitutional state, which are dependent upon menstrual congestion of\r\nthe pelvic organs, upon local engorgement; sometimes such symptoms are\r\nthe result of uterine contractions caused by hyperæmia of the uterus,\r\nand these cases often take a paroxysmal form.\r\n\r\nImportant disturbances of the general constitutional state result from\r\nsudden suppression of the normal menstrual flow, such as may be the\r\neffect of a severe chill, of sudden mental impressions, even of errors\r\nin diet or the use of certain drugs, and may sometimes follow artificial\r\nwithdrawal of blood.\r\n\r\nIn many women, a few days or it may be a few hours only before every\r\nmenstruation, changing manifestations of manifold disorders may recur.\r\nAmong these may be mentioned, general excitement of the nervous system,\r\nnotable alteration in the voice, strong inclination to sadness,\r\ntearfulness, erotic longings, great irritability and sensitiveness of\r\nthe sensory system, drowsiness, flushings of the face, giddiness,\r\nswooning. The appetite is impaired, the breath has a disagreeable smell,\r\nthe digestion is disturbed, there is a tendency to diarrhœa; the facial\r\naspect may be altered, there are blue rings round the eyes, eruptions on\r\nthe skin, tendency to sweating, palpitation and feeling of anxiety, and\r\na sensation in the extremities as if they had been beaten. Local\r\nsymptoms also occur: disturbances of the function of micturition,\r\nswelling of the breasts, pains and colics in the renal region, feeling\r\nof warmth in the genital organs, pruritus vulvæ, sensation of weight in\r\nthe uterus, and a strong impulse toward coition. The secretions may be\r\npathological, sometimes there are profuse sweats, sometimes profuse\r\nmucous or bilious diarrhœa, whilst the urine may either be very\r\nabundant, almost colorless, and nearly free from saline matter, or thick\r\nand overladen with phosphates and urates.\r\n\r\n_Schauta_ writes regarding the complex of menstrual phenomena which\r\noccur in normal menstruation: “In the process of menstruation, blood and\r\nsanguineous mucus find their way through a mucous canal, the normal\r\ncalibre of which is merely a capillary fissure. If the flow is slow,\r\nwithout the formation of coagula, and if the passage through the cervix\r\nis free, very gentle contractions of the uterine muscle suffice on the\r\nwhole, as the blood exudes into the cavity of the uterus, to expel it\r\ninto the vagina. Without such contractions, menstruation is hardly\r\nconceivable. Physiologically, they are characterized by a bearing-down\r\nsensation, passing down toward the thighs, and by pains in the back. It\r\nis rarely, that no pain at all is experienced; there are some women,\r\nhowever, who affirm that in their case menstruation begins quite\r\nunexpectedly, and without the slightest warning; but it does not follow\r\nthat contractions of the uterus do not occur in these women also during\r\nmenstruation. * * * The local disturbances which occur as an\r\naccompaniment even of physiological menstruation are, a sensation of\r\nfulness and weight in the pelvis, and pains in the lower part of the\r\nback, and these probably all result from the uterine contractions. The\r\ngeneral disturbances of a reflex nature consist of tenderness on\r\npressure in the epigastrium, headaches, general sense of languor,\r\nirritability, and an inclination to shed tears. Among changes in the\r\nfunctions of remote organs may be mentioned, swelling of the breasts, of\r\nthe vocal cords, and of the thyroid body, increased respiratory capacity\r\nshortly before menstruation followed by rapid decrease during the flow,\r\ntendency to diarrhœa, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, salivation, profuse\r\nsecretion of the sebaceous glands of the vulva, increased secretion of\r\nsweat, tendency to the formation of acne pustules. The mental condition\r\nalso exhibits as a rule a considerable change during menstruation, even\r\nin cases which cannot in any sense be regarded as pathological. In many\r\ninstances, an apparently normal woman may during menstruation exhibit a\r\nmental state so abnormal that we are led to speak of it as a menstrual\r\npsychosis. Apart from this, however, it appears that during menstruation\r\nthe mental life of woman never remains entirely unaffected. Finally, we\r\nmust mention certain changes in the sense-organs which not infrequently\r\naccompany menstruation, such as herpes conjunctivæ, exophthalmos,\r\nlimitation of the visual field, and swelling of the nasal turbinate\r\nbodies.”\r\n\r\nIn the digestive organs, during the menstrual process, changes in the\r\nsecretions of the glands, nausea, vomiting, and flatulence are not\r\ninfrequently observed. In one-half of the women concerning whose state\r\nduring menstruation _Krieger_ made inquiries, he found, especially just\r\nbefore and during the discharge, a tendency to diarrhœa, or at least to\r\nmore copious and more frequent evacuations of the bowels than occurred\r\nat other times. On the surface of the tongue, at the premenstrual epoch,\r\na pronounced exfoliation of the epithelium may occur, so that in some\r\ninstances the papillæ are entirely exposed.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently hyperæmia of the liver appears to be connected with the\r\nmenstrual process; and by many observers, among whom _Senator_ and\r\n_Fleischmann_ may be mentioned, jaundice, slight or intense, has been\r\nseen to occur during menstruation. In a case of long-standing\r\namenorrhœa, _Duncan_ noted the appearance of a transient vicarious\r\njaundice, apparently reflex in its origin. In some cases, jaundice\r\nprecedes menstruation, and disappears as the flow becomes established.\r\n\r\nIn the respiratory organs also, menstrual changes frequently occur.\r\nAccording to _von Ott_, respiratory capacity attains a maximum shortly\r\nbefore menstruation, and diminishes rather rapidly during the flow; the\r\nexpiratory power is similarly affected. In the larynx, according to\r\n_Bottermund_, great swelling of the posterior wall occurs during\r\nmenstruation, whereby the closure of the glottis is hindered, and a\r\nrapid onset of fatigue ensues in the muscles that perform this action\r\nwhen the woman sings or speaks; the fulness of the voice is also\r\ndiminished. More or less extensive swelling of the thyroid body[32]\r\noccurs during the menstrual period. According to _Fliess_, in most\r\nwomen, the inferior, sometimes the middle and the inferior nasal\r\nturbinate bodies are greatly swollen; sometimes also the tubercula septi\r\nare swollen. It is said that the right half of the nose is more\r\nfrequently and more intensely swollen than the left half. Epistaxis is\r\nsometimes observed at the menstrual periods.\r\n\r\nIn the urinary organs, the influence of the menstrual period is\r\nmanifested by a change in the urine. According to _Schrader_, the\r\nelimination of urea is diminished shortly before menstruation; according\r\nto _Laval_, the elimination of uric acid undergoes a sudden diminution\r\non the second day of the flow, followed by an increase on the third day,\r\nsubsequently rising above the normal level. This change is to be\r\nattributed, not to any excitation of the genital organs, but to the loss\r\nof blood.\r\n\r\n_Hebra_ already drew attention to the connection between diseases of the\r\nskin and the physiological and pathological processes occurring in the\r\nfemale genital organs; and emphasized the fact that for the cure of\r\ncertain eruptions, local treatment of the disorder of the reproductive\r\norgans was requisite. He gave four examples of such eruptions: 1, an\r\nacute attack of eczema, which disappeared only after the removal of a\r\nbadly fitting pessary; 2, in a chlorotic girl, two large red spots on\r\nthe cheeks disappeared when menstruation was established; 3, improvement\r\nof a skin-affection when a coexisting disorder of the genital organs\r\nreceived appropriate treatment, followed by recrudescence of the skin\r\ntrouble when the genital disorder became more severe; 4, a case of\r\nobstinate seborrhœa, lasting for many years, which disappeared only when\r\nthe patient became pregnant, for the first time, seven years after her\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nSimilar cases have been recorded by subsequent observers, and numerous\r\nmonographs have been published on menstrual skin-eruptions. _Schramm_,\r\nfor instance, reports the case of a woman in whom at each menstrual\r\nperiod tubercles and papules appeared on the backs of the hands and on\r\nthe neck; and the same author mentions another case in which during\r\nmenstruation red papules arranged in rows appeared on the back.\r\n_Wilhelm_ observed dark blue macules, the size of hazelnuts, which\r\nappeared on the thighs shortly before menstruation and disappeared when\r\nthe flow was over. Of two cases of menstrual disorder of the skin\r\nreported by _Stiller_, in one, an itching eruption appeared on the upper\r\nand the lower extremities; in the other, small red papules appeared on\r\nthe dorsum of the hands and feet. Other cases of menstrual\r\nskin-eruptions were published by _Joseph_, _Pauli_, _Janovsky_, and\r\n_Schwing_. Sometimes at the menstrual periods severe pruritus vulvæ\r\noccurs, due, no doubt, to the temporary increase in the secretion of the\r\nmenstrual passages, and to the more active influence exercised by this\r\nsecretion on the vulva.\r\n\r\nIn two cases in which the menstrual flow was in abeyance, _Heitzmann_\r\nobserved affections of the skin. In one of these, a young woman aged\r\ntwenty who had not yet begun to menstruate, there appeared every four\r\nweeks isolated papules surrounded by a bright red areola, itching so\r\nviolently that scratching resulted. In the other, macules the size of a\r\nlentil, of a light red or dark red color, appeared, and lasted two or\r\nthree days; when menstruation became regular, fresh crops no longer\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n_Schauta_, in a case of chronic oöphoritis, observed the regular\r\nrecurrence of urticaria at each successive menstrual period. The\r\nsuffering being very great, the rest at night being greatly disturbed\r\nduring the periods of eruption, and the patient’s general health\r\ndeclining more and more in consequence, extirpation of the ovaries was\r\nundertaken, and the operation resulted in a complete cure. _Schauta_\r\nfurther observed that in cases of obstinate skin-affections of unknown\r\ncausation occurring in persons of the female sex, some disorder of the\r\ngenital organs was nearly always present; moreover, in many of these\r\ncases, as soon as the genital disorder was cured by appropriate\r\nmeasures, the skin-affection disappeared spontaneously and without any\r\nfurther treatment. He had been able to collect twenty-six cases of this\r\nnature, in which an indubitable connection obtained between disease of\r\nthe skin and disease of the reproductive system. The forms of affection\r\nof the genital organs chiefly noticed in this association were,\r\nretroflexion and retroversion of the uterus, erosion and ectropium or\r\neversion of the cervix (chronic cervical catarrh), chronic endometritis,\r\noöphoritis, and salpingitis, and finally with especial frequency uterine\r\nmyomata; the skin-diseases observed were, acne, eczema, disorders of\r\npigmentation, psoriasis, lichen, and urticaria.\r\n\r\nDuring menstruation we observe not infrequently a number of changes in\r\nthe skin, such as hyperidrosis, acne, seborrhœa, erythema, and the form\r\nof dermatitis known as erysipelas of menstruation; sometimes also\r\neffusion of blood into the skin as a form of vicarious menstruation, and\r\npeculiar forms of cutaneous œdema. In many women during menstruation the\r\nsecretion of sweat is markedly increased every month; in exceptional\r\ncases, menstruation is vicariously replaced by profuse sweating. In\r\nassociation with menstruation we frequently observe excessive secretion\r\nof the sebaceous glands, especially of those of the hairy scalp. Often\r\nurticaria manifests itself as a recurrent menstrual eruption. In cases\r\nof scanty menstruation and of amenorrhœa, discoloration and excessive\r\npigmentation of the skin may occur, sometimes taking the form (as also\r\nin pregnancy) of chloasma uterinum. Sometimes also in these cases the\r\nformation of dark rings round the eyes, already seen in slighter degree\r\nas an accompaniment of normal menstruation, is excessive.\r\n\r\nIn the organ of vision, changes associated with menstruation have been\r\nrecorded by various observers. Hordeolum menstruale (menstrual stye) may\r\nrecur month after month at the menstrual periods as an exacerbation of a\r\nchronic conjunctivitis. Herpes of the ocular or palpebral conjunctive\r\nand eczematous affections may be connected with menstruation; also\r\nexophthalmos may occur during menstruation in association with swelling\r\nof the thyroid body and palpitation of the heart (_H. Cohn_); again, as\r\nan accompaniment of normal menstruation, severe papillitis with retinal\r\nhæmorrhages may occur (_Heber_). According to the investigations of\r\n_Finkelstein_, a limitation of the field of vision may be noticed during\r\nmenstruation, beginning on the first, second, or third day of the flow,\r\nattaining its greatest intensity on the third or fourth day of the flow,\r\nand gradually disappearing during the three or four days next ensuing.\r\n\r\nThe organ of hearing is stated by _Haug_ to be affected during\r\nmenstruation, inasmuch as congestive redness and swelling of the\r\nexternal ear, of the external auditory meatus, and of the skin over the\r\nmastoid process, sometimes occurs; occasionally also, periodic neuralgia\r\nmanifests itself at the menstrual periods.\r\n\r\nIn the circulatory organs, as already mentioned, normal menstruation\r\nquite frequently manifests its influence by the production of disorders\r\nof greater or less severity, referable to the stimulus of ovulation. In\r\n8.5 per cent. of the women of whom I have made inquiries with regard to\r\nthis matter, palpitation of the heart of variable severity occurred\r\nduring menstruation, and was most frequent and most severe on the first\r\nand second days of the flow. Associated with the palpitation in some\r\ncases were, vasomotor disturbances, transient feelings of heat, a sense\r\nof congestion in the head, and profuse perspiration without apparent\r\ncause. The day before the commencement of the flow, the blood-pressure\r\nrises considerably, but falls rapidly during the flow. This menstrual\r\nrise in blood-pressure is accompanied by a rise in temperature and an\r\nincrease in metabolic activity. The influence of menstruation on the\r\nheart is most powerfully displayed in cases in which for some reason a\r\ndisturbance occurs of the normal appearance or normal course of\r\nmenstruation.\r\n\r\nDisorders of menstruation likely to give rise to cardiac disorders are,\r\namenorrhœa, menorrhagia, and dysmenorrhœa.\r\n\r\nAmenorrhœa is especially apt to induce cardiac disorder in cases in\r\nwhich, in consequence of some sudden impression, such as a fright or a\r\nsevere chill, menstruation, which began at puberty in normal fashion and\r\nsubsequently recurred with perfect regularity, has undergone sudden and\r\ncomplete suppression; also in cases in which severe anæmia or obesity\r\nhas rapidly led to the onset of amenorrhœa. In such cases, attacks of\r\ntachycardia sometimes occur, it may be at irregular intervals, or it may\r\nbe exhibiting a menstrual rhythm, the cardiac affection manifesting\r\nitself always a few days before the date at which menstruation ought to\r\nbegin. In these cases, also, systolic murmurs are not infrequently\r\naudible.\r\n\r\nIn cases in which menstruation is very painful, the dysmenorrhœa may\r\ngive rise to attacks of colic or to convulsive seizures, whether the\r\ndysmenorrhœa is itself due to inadequacy or to complete suppression of\r\nthe flow, to metritis, to anteflexion, to new growths in the uterus, or,\r\nfinally, to diseases of the ovaries or to pathological disorders of\r\novulation. Among the various disorders associated with dysmenorrhœa,\r\nheart troubles are not infrequent, most often taking the form of reflex\r\nneuroses, evoked by the stimulus of the pain in the genital organs; but\r\nit has also been asserted that an acute dilatation of the heart occurs\r\nin these attacks.\r\n\r\nVery threatening cardiac symptoms as an accompaniment of severe\r\ndysmenorrhœa have been seen by me especially in the case of two women,\r\none of whom was in the thirties and the other in the forties. The\r\nattacks took the form of increased frequency of the heart’s action, with\r\nsevere cardiac dyspnœa on trifling exertion, sense of suffocation, and\r\nintense anxiety. This severe cardiac and respiratory distress was a\r\nsequel to the appearance of severe dysmenorrhœa, and was relieved as\r\nsoon as the course of menstruation became regular and painless; but the\r\ncardiac trouble recurred in association with each successive attack of\r\ndysmenorrhœa. In one of these two women, the dysmenorrhœa was the result\r\nof extreme anteflexion of the uterus; in the other woman, the cause of\r\nthe dysmenorrhœa was not apparent. I was unable to decide with certainty\r\nwhether in these cases an acute dilatation of the heart occurred. French\r\nauthorities, who describe similar cardiac trouble resulting from\r\ndiseases of the liver and the stomach by the name of _asystolic\r\ngastrohépatique_ (_Potain_), give the following explanation of its mode\r\nof occurrence. The intra-abdominal plexus of the sympathetic is\r\nstimulated, this stimulus is reflected to the lungs, in which organs it\r\ngives rise to vaso-constriction, resulting in increased tension in the\r\nlesser circulation; in consequence of this the right heart has\r\ndifficulty in emptying itself, when weak it undergoes dilatation, and a\r\nmoderate or extreme tricuspid insufficiency ensues. We have to do, then,\r\nin these cases, with reflex symptoms, with a reflex arc, the starting\r\npoint of which is the sensory nerve-terminals in the abdomen, the\r\nafferent tract of which is formed by the sympathetic and pneumogastric\r\nnerves, and the efferent tract of which passes along the pulmonary\r\nsympathetic nerves.\r\n\r\nIn other cases of dysmenorrhœa we observed signs of cardiac weakness;\r\nthe pulse was small, very frequent, and barely perceptible, the face\r\nbecame suddenly pale, the hands and feet were cold; complete syncope\r\nsometimes occurred.\r\n\r\nMenorrhagia sometimes leads to cardiac symptoms, owing to the severity\r\nof the anæmia which follows extensive and long-continued loss of blood;\r\nsometimes, however, the heart troubles associated with menorrhagia are\r\nreflex manifestations, dependent on the disease which has also caused\r\nthe menorrhagia, endometritis, it may be, new growths, lukæmia, or\r\nscurvy. Sometimes here also we observe transient attacks of acute\r\ndilatation of the heart.\r\n\r\nNervous disturbances during menstruation, which are so frequent that\r\n_Emmet_ regards it as abnormal for a menstruating woman to be entirely\r\nfree from pain and from uneasy sensations, are divided by _Windscheid_\r\ninto two classes, general nervous disorders, and local nervous\r\nmanifestations. Among general disorders, the commonest is a general\r\nbodily incapacity; in women, who in other respects are quite healthy,\r\nduring menstruation everything will be too great an exertion, and\r\nfatigue speedily ensues on the performance of occupations which at other\r\ntimes are undertaken without the slightest difficulty. Another common\r\nnervous disorder is an uneasy sensation in the head, it may be a feeling\r\nof weight or pressure, sometimes described as a feeling as if an iron\r\nband were compressing the forehead. Slight mental irritation is commonly\r\npresent also, the woman is capricious, her mental equilibrium is\r\ndisturbed. Very common also are vasomotor disturbances, transient\r\nfeelings of heat, a sense of congestion in the head, or an outbreak of\r\nperspiration. Among local nervous disturbances, _Windscheid_ enumerates,\r\npains in the back (occasionally and erroneously described as spinal\r\nirritation), sacrache, pains in the lower extremities, which by\r\npreference generally take the course of the great sciatic nerves. Pains\r\nin the abdomen also frequently accompany menstruation; these may be\r\ndiffused over the whole abdomen, or may predominate in the two\r\nhypochondriac regions. Disorders of the sense-organs sometimes occurring\r\nduring menstruation are, the flickering of objects before the eyes,\r\nphotophobia, and tinnitus aurium. The heart may also be affected with\r\npalpitation in association with these nervous disturbances; the stomach\r\nmay exhibit associated disorder in the form of cardialgia, or more\r\nfrequently in the form of vomiting, this latter being very frequent at\r\nthe outset of the flow. Less common is profuse diarrhœa, pain in the\r\nanus, or spasm of the sphincter ani.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of such nervous manifestations during menstruation is\r\ndependent upon the woman’s general state of nutrition, upon the degree\r\nof instability of her nervous system, and upon her occupation. Robust\r\nand powerful women, regularly employed in the open air, such as the\r\nwives and daughters of farmers and agricultural laborers, are much less\r\naffected by the nerve-weakening influences of menstruation than the\r\nsedentary and anæmic town-dwelling women, whether these latter belong to\r\nthe higher classes of society and are addicted to nerve-straining\r\nenjoyments, or to the class of shop-girls, seamstresses, and\r\nfactory-women, whose employment is apt to lead to nervous exhaustion.\r\n\r\nAs regards the forms of neuralgia most apt to accompany menstruation,\r\n_Windscheid_ mentions trigeminal neuralgia as the commonest, especially\r\naffecting the first division of the nerve, and producing localized pains\r\nwhich are to be distinguished from the headaches already mentioned. They\r\nare characterized by their intensity and their persistence in spite of\r\nanti-neuralgic treatment, and by their spontaneous disappearance as soon\r\nas menstruation is over. According to the same author, the relations\r\nbetween hemicrania and the process of menstruation are indisputable; at\r\nthe very least it must be admitted that menstruation predisposes to an\r\nattack of hemicrania.\r\n\r\nCases also occur in which convulsions almost invariably accompany\r\nmenstruation, convulsions which are to be regarded as symptoms of\r\nhysteria.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinarily powerful influence which the menstrual stimulus\r\nexercises on the mind is shown by the frequency with which the slighter\r\npsychopathic states occur as an accompaniment even of normal\r\nmenstruation, these manifestations being sometimes melancholic in type,\r\nsometimes maniacal or erotic, and, when of long duration, leading\r\nultimately to pronounced mental disorder. This influence of the\r\nmenstrual stimulus is yet more potent in cases in which important\r\nchanges in the course of menstruation have occurred, in cases, for\r\ninstance, of suppressed, painful, or irregular menstruation. In this\r\nconnection, however, in order to avoid a confusion of cause and effect,\r\nwe must carefully bear in mind, that it is a much commoner causal\r\nsequence for psychical disorders to disturb the normal course of\r\nmenstruation, than for disorders of menstruation to evoke psychical\r\ndisorders. This view has only quite recently become established, and for\r\nthis reason it is necessary to regard such data when obtained from the\r\nwritings of the older gynecologists in a somewhat critical spirit.\r\n\r\nBy the modern alienist, the influence of the menstrual reflex on mental\r\naffections is recognized only in cases in which a proper valuation of\r\nthe predisposing causes has been made, in such cases as the following:\r\nFirst, we have to recognize the modifying influence exercised by the\r\nmenstrual stimulus on established psychoses, inasmuch as these latter\r\nnot infrequently undergo cure when previously irregular menstruation has\r\nbecome regular, and, moreover, the recurrence or the first appearance of\r\nmenstruation has often a powerful influence on the course of some\r\nestablished mental disorder. In some cases this influence is a\r\nstrikingly favorable one on psychoses that have developed before the\r\ncommencement of menstruation, or during the suppression of that\r\nfunction; it may be, however, and, indeed, more frequently is, an\r\nunfavorable influence, inasmuch as such a psychosis, on the first\r\nappearance or on the reappearance of menstruation, may assume a\r\nmenstrual type, the attacks becoming more frequent or more violent with\r\nthe successive recurrence of each menstrual or premenstrual period. This\r\nis the history of the typical menstrual psychosis.\r\n\r\nAgain, certain processes of the sexual life, disorders of menstruation,\r\ndiseases of the genital organs, operations on these organs, and the\r\nprocesses of the climacteric, influence the origin and the character of\r\nmental disorder, generally giving rise to chronic affective insanity\r\n(insanity of the emotions and feelings) or to paranoia (chronic\r\ndelusional insanity, insanity of the intellect). The menstrual stimulus\r\nmust in these cases be regarded as a psychopathically exciting physical\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nFurther, physical disturbances may equally affect the menstrual function\r\nand the functions of the mind, rendering the exact causal sequence in\r\nsuch cases a difficult one to determine; and, conversely, the\r\ncircumstances that restore the normal working of the mind may also\r\nregulate the menstrual function.\r\n\r\nFinally, we may have to do with isolated sporadic occurrences in which\r\nthe exciting influence of menstrual processes may be traced. Thus, for\r\nthe outbreak of a periodical menstrual psychosis, an especial temporal\r\npredisposition must exist, connected with the great developmental epoch\r\nof the sexual life.\r\n\r\nThere is, for instance, a group of transitory states occurring during\r\nmenstruation, and taking the form of disorders of the intelligence or of\r\nexplosive emotional states; such may be witnessed, not in those\r\nsuffering from psychopathic predisposition, but in quite healthy\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nThe successive menstruations as they recur regularly throughout the\r\ncourse of the sexual life may, just like the first menstruation, though\r\nwith diminished intensity, give rise to manifestations of nervous and\r\nmental disorders. In many women who are in other respects healthy, we\r\nsee during menstruation, hemicrania, nervous irritability, ill-temper,\r\nlow-spiritedness, and even hysterical and epileptic attacks; these occur\r\nchiefly on the first and second days of the flow, and disappear\r\naltogether toward the end of the period. These manifestations are more\r\nsevere in individuals weakened by profuse losses of blood or by chronic\r\ndisorder in various organs, more severe also in those predisposed to\r\nsuch disturbances in consequence of neuropathic inheritance, more severe\r\nin women suffering from menorrhagia and dysmenorrhœa, and from any kind\r\nof mental stress.\r\n\r\nIn his work on the influence of the so-called menstrual wave on the\r\ncourse of mental disorders, _Schüle_ remarks that the mental equilibrium\r\neven of a perfectly healthy woman is not a stable one, but is subject to\r\na series of oscillations. “The menstrual period,” he continues, “has a\r\ndistinct influence on woman’s mental equilibrium. Even in those whose\r\nnervous system is a healthy one, menstruation evokes a state, now of\r\ndepression, now of excitement; in neurotic women, on the other hand,\r\nmenstruation may give rise to nervous diseases which may equally exhibit\r\nthe characteristics of depression or the characteristics of excitement.\r\nIn nervously predisposed women, the influence of regularly established\r\nmenstruation, even when the circumstances are favorable, is pretty much\r\nthe same as the influence of menstruation when it first makes its\r\nappearance; the influence is merely somewhat weaker in so far as the\r\nwoman has learned to endure and to be patient. The menstrual state, in\r\nnervously predisposed women, evokes the particular neurosis to which the\r\nindividual happens to be liable. The disorders most commonly met with in\r\nthis association are, hysteria, hemicrania, swimming in the head,\r\nepileptic paroxysms, toothache, and neurasthenia.”\r\n\r\nEspecially frequent during menstruation is hemicrania. Sometimes\r\nhemicrania may begin a day or two before menstruation, as a prodromal\r\nsign, and may accompany its whole course, becoming, however, less severe\r\ntoward the end of the flow. Hysteria most commonly manifests itself in\r\nassociation with menstruation by a depressed emotional state, by\r\ntearfulness, by complaints made without sufficient grounds, by globus\r\nhystericus or clavus hystericus; sometimes also by paroxysms of muscular\r\nspasm; very rarely by hystero-epileptic seizures. Epilepsy may occur\r\neither by day or by night. Nocturnal seizures usually occur without any\r\napparent external cause, as a result of the central stimulus; diurnal\r\nattacks, on the other hand, have usually some external exciting cause.\r\nOften, however, years may elapse without any attack of major epilepsy\r\noccurring, the disease manifesting itself in one or more of the many\r\nvarieties of the minor form (_petit mal_), as transient absences of\r\nmind, attacks of vertigo, etc.\r\n\r\nThe nervous disturbance in a menstruating woman may be so great as to\r\nlead to the production of psychoses. The question of the existence of a\r\nmenstrual insanity _sui generis_ has been answered by many alienists in\r\nthe affirmative; by others, however, who see in the alleged cases\r\nnothing specific, it has been answered in the negative. The relation of\r\nmenstruation to the mental disorder may be a double one: 1, menstruation\r\nmay occur repeatedly in the course of an already established mental\r\ndisorder; 2, menstruation and its morbid variations may favor the\r\noccurrence of psychoses that exist already in a latent form, and may\r\nlead to the origination of psychoses to which the organism is\r\npredisposed.\r\n\r\nIn the former connection, _Brierre de Boismont_ undertook an\r\ninvestigation which showed that in women suffering from mental disorder,\r\nan exacerbation of that disorder was to be observed during menstruation.\r\n_Schlager_, who regards the menstrual process as possessing when\r\nanomalous a high significance for the development and course of mental\r\ndisturbances, observed that in 33 per cent. of women suffering from\r\nmental disorder, the menstrual state had an unfavorable influence upon\r\nthe course of that disorder, inasmuch as it led to an increased\r\nirritability; in the rest of the cases, however, menstruation was\r\nwithout influence upon the course of the ordinary chronic psychoses. In\r\nthe cases that were unfavorably influenced, epileptic attacks usually\r\nbecame more frequent, and chronic melancholia became much more profound.\r\n_Schröder_ observed in chronic forms of melancholia that during\r\nmenstruation the sadness became intolerable and was associated with a\r\nsuicidal tendency; in chronic maniacal forms of mental disorder, the\r\nexcitement underwent an increase during menstruation. _Von\r\nKrafft-Ebing_, as a result of his investigations into insanity during\r\nmenstruation, came to similar conclusions with regard to the unfavorable\r\ninfluence of the menstrual process. _Algeri_ likewise states that\r\nmenstruation notably aggravates the cerebral symptoms in the course of\r\nmental disorders.\r\n\r\nOther authors, _Marcé_ and _Kowalewski_ for instance, whilst emphasizing\r\nthe powerful influence exerted by menstruation on any existing\r\npsychosis, point out that in some instances, as in states of mental and\r\nphysical depression, this influence is for the worse; but in other\r\ninstances, especially in states of maniacal excitement, the condition of\r\nthe patient undergoes notable amelioration during menstruation.\r\n_Schäfer_ also, in his researches into the relations between the\r\nprocesses of menstruation and psychoses, discovered that anomalies in\r\nthe course of menstruation ran almost parallel with anomalies in the\r\ncourse of mental activity.\r\n\r\nIn psychopathically predisposed women, disorders of menstruation, such\r\nas amenorrhœa, delayed menstruation, and dysmenorrhœa, are more\r\neffective than the normal process of menstruation in evoking\r\nmanifestations of psychical abnormalities previously latent, and in\r\nleading to attacks of precordial anxiety, pathological emotional states,\r\nmelancholic seizures, epilepsy in all its varieties, and impulsive\r\nmanifestations, such as pyromania, kleptomania, infanticide, homicide,\r\netc. As results of a special predisposition may appear in this\r\nconnection, congenital imbecility, idiocy, melancholia, and chronic\r\nweak-mindedness.\r\n\r\nA rich literature exists of cases in which mental abnormalities occurred\r\nin psychopathically predisposed individuals as a result of menstruation.\r\nThus, _von Krafft-Ebing_ reports a case in which, during menstruation, a\r\nmentally undeveloped woman murdered her husband; and another case in\r\nwhich to chronic weak-mindedness and chronic delusional insanity were\r\nsuperadded during menstruation peculiar attacks having the character of\r\npsychical storms. _Tuke_ reports a case in which a mother, in a state of\r\nalcoholic excess during menstruation, murdered her daughter. _Pelmann_\r\nrecords acts of pyromania committed during menstruation by a girl\r\nseventeen years of age. _Mabille_ records a case in which a woman\r\nsuffering from severe mental disorder was affected during menstruation\r\nby impulsive kleptomania, whilst after the periods the memory of what\r\nhad happened passed away. _Philo-Indicus_ records the case of a woman\r\nsuffering from severe neuropathy who at the menstrual periods exhibited\r\ngreat irritability, experienced marked sexual excitement, and had\r\nsuicidal impulses, and who on one occasion attempted to murder a female\r\nfriend who had refused to assist her in the practice of sexual\r\naberrations. _Giraud_ describes a woman suffering from passive\r\nmelancholia, in whom during menstruation horrible fantastic ideas\r\noccurred. _Ball_ records the case of a woman who suffered always from\r\nacute mental disorder during menstruation, and who, in one of these\r\nattacks, murdered her son. _Kowalewski_ reports a case of chronic\r\nimbecility, in which during menstruation attacks of precordial anxiety\r\ndeveloped, and in the course of one of these attacks the patient set\r\nfire to her own house. “In such cases,” remarks _Kowalewski_,\r\n“menstruation represents the last drop that makes the full goblet\r\noverflow.”\r\n\r\nIn addition, we meet with cases in which the influence of menstruation\r\nis so powerful that it must be regarded as the principal cause of the\r\npsychosis. We must then speak of a true menstrual psychosis, the impulse\r\nto which is supplied by the normal or abnormal changes occurring in the\r\nprocess of menstruation, and characterized by the menstrual periodicity\r\nand the brief duration of the attacks. These are the characteristics of\r\nthe menstrual psychoses of the menarche and of the climacteric period;\r\nand such cases occur also during the period of full menstrual activity.\r\n\r\nThe menstrual psychosis most commonly makes its appearance shortly\r\nbefore the flow, becomes less severe with the establishment of the flow,\r\nand disappears when the flow ceases; in other cases, the psychosis\r\nappears toward the end of menstruation, and speedily passes away; or,\r\nagain, in amenorrhoeic cases, the attacks of mental disorder replace the\r\nproper menstrual flow, and become less severe or disappear entirely as\r\nsoon as the flow is regularly re-established. The commonest forms of\r\nthese menstrual psychoses are, melancholia, mania, irresistible\r\nimpulses, acute amentia, in rare cases alternating insanity (_folie\r\ncirculaire_) in which the periods of alternation assume the menstrual\r\nrhythm. The duration of these psychoses is usually short, from a few\r\ndays up to a fortnight; there may be only a single attack, or there may\r\nbe a number of attacks presenting precisely similar characters.\r\n\r\nThe consciousness may be more or less disturbed. _Von Krafft-Ebing_\r\npoints out, as a very dangerous peculiarity of the menstrual psychoses,\r\nthat the fact that the morbid process has once occurred in connection\r\nwith menstruation furnishes in itself a sufficient reason for the\r\nrecurrence of such attacks, which are dependent on constantly repeated\r\nfunctional changes in the brain closely analogous to those that occur in\r\nepilepsy. When the menstrual insanity recurs frequently, it gradually\r\nbecomes less acute in its characters and more protracted in its course;\r\nthe lucid intervals are less clearly indicated and shorter in duration;\r\nand thus in course of time the mental disorder may be transformed into\r\nchronic imbecility—a transformation liable to occur in all forms of\r\nperiodic psychosis. In such cases we must always assume the existence of\r\na certain lack of resisting power on the part of the organism,\r\nespecially of the nervous system, which amounts to a congenital\r\npredisposition. During the period of full menstrual activity, the\r\nfavorable soil for the cultivation of such disorders is usually\r\nfurnished by anomalies of menstruation, by difficult labor and its\r\nconsequences, severe losses of blood, prolonged lactation, physical\r\nover-exertion, and mental shock and stress.\r\n\r\nIn the development under the influence of menstruation of such periodic\r\nacute mental disorders, we may observe various gradations, as for\r\ninstance short, syncope-like cataleptic seizures, states of\r\nhallucinatory confusion lasting several hours or several days,\r\ndisordered consciousness, and even severe mania.\r\n\r\nSuch a case was observed by _Wille_. Under the influence of menstruation\r\nand of a trifling source of mental disturbance (having soldiers billeted\r\non them in a quiet country village), a young woman aged twenty-one,\r\nwhose mental health had previously been good, had a sudden attack of\r\nanxiety, succeeded by a violent but transitory mania, lasting five or\r\nsix hours; after a short free interval came another attack, this time\r\nlasting several days. Similar cases were recorded by _Friedmann_. A\r\nblooming and healthy maid-servant eighteen years of age (some mental\r\nunsoundness was recorded in both grandfather and aunt on the maternal\r\nside) fell asleep in a chair a few days before menstruation, awakened\r\nwith a start, was subsequently disordered in mind, though tranquil, with\r\nmany hallucinations, listening to voices which repeated monotonously\r\n“they come,” was drowsy, and slow to answer when spoken to. On the third\r\nday she was recovered, her mind being clear and normal; she was not\r\nfully aware of what had happened. Since this attack, her mind has been\r\nfree from disorder, during menstruation as well as at other times. She\r\nis said to have had a similar attack about four years ago, that is, at\r\nthe commencement of puberty.—A girl aged thirteen, quite healthy, not\r\nnervous, physically rather powerful, with quite healthy family history.\r\nComplaints of having suffered for two days from general sense of\r\ndepression with pains in the abdomen; during the afternoon was lying on\r\na sofa, but suddenly sprang up, looked extremely anxious and confused,\r\nran about the room, begged to be protected from the black man, etc., her\r\nspeech was disconnected, gabbling, and difficult to understand. After\r\ntwo hours she became quiet, and fell into a sound sleep, from which she\r\nawoke calm and quite forgetful of what had passed. On the following day\r\nmenstruation appeared for the first time, with abdominal pains, but\r\nwithout any mental abnormality. During the subsequent six years she has\r\nremained quite well.\r\n\r\nSince the days of antiquity an extremely important part has been\r\nassigned to suppression of the menses in the production of mental\r\ndisorders; but in the opinion of modern alienists, who are opposed to\r\nthe old humoral pathology, no more is to be recognized in this\r\nconnection than the ordinary menstrual stimulus, which, indeed, when the\r\nsoil is already prepared, may furnish a causal determinant for an\r\nincrease in the intensity of an already existing anomalous mental\r\ncondition. Quite recently numerous cases have been published in which\r\nsuch an influence has been recognized as powerful. _Von Krafft-Ebing_\r\nwrites: “In isolated cases, as a sequel of sudden cessation of the\r\nmenstrual flow, generally, due to a fright or to a chill, the\r\ndevelopment of insanity (usually acute mania) has been observed, and the\r\nsuppression of menstruation has been regarded as the causal determinant.\r\nIt is indeed conceivable that the connection between the two events is\r\nsupplied by a collateral vicarious congestion of the brain. As a rule,\r\nhowever, the psychosis and the suppression of menstruation are the\r\ncoeffects of the same cause, and are both of vasomotor origin.”\r\n\r\n_Mairet_ reports a case of violent mental disorder of a maniacal type,\r\nassociated with chorea, occurring at puberty, the exciting cause of\r\nwhich, in a constitution hereditarily predisposed to insanity, he\r\nbelieved to be suppression of the menses. _Diamant_ had under\r\nobservation a girl in whom, at the age of six years, menstruation\r\nceased, having previously been regular since the age of two years; after\r\nthe suppression of menstruation, violent epileptiform seizures set in,\r\noccurring at what should have been the menstrual periods. _Westphal_\r\ndescribed a case of infanticide committed in a state of melancholia at\r\nthe proper menstrual period, the menses being suppressed.\r\n\r\nMenstrual psychoses are observed for the most part in comparatively\r\nyoung women; after the age of thirty-five they are uncommon. Among _von\r\nKrafft-Ebing’s_ cases there were:\r\n\r\n            4 patients between the ages of 15 and 20 years.\r\n            6 patients between the ages of 20 and 25 years.\r\n            2 patients between the ages of 25 and 30 years.\r\n            6 patients between the ages of 30 and 35 years.\r\n            2 patients above the age of    35 years.\r\n\r\nThe same author insists that for the development of a menstrual\r\npsychosis a predisposition on the part of the brain must exist, either\r\nin the form of an inherited predisposition, or in the form of a primary\r\nmental disorder, or, finally, as the result of some special exciting\r\ncause, such as emotional disturbance, the abuse of alcohol, or bodily\r\nillness. Among 19 cases observed by _von Krafft-Ebing_\r\n\r\n   12 were hereditarily predisposed.\r\n    4 had previously exhibited great nervousness during menstruation.\r\n    7 suffered from primary mental weakness.\r\n\r\nVery remarkable is the influence, demonstrated especially by _Lombroso_,\r\nexercised by menstruation on the commission of certain crimes. Of eighty\r\nwomen taken into custody for resisting the police, there were nine only\r\nwho were not menstruating at the time. Four notorious murderesses and\r\none woman convicted of arson were all menstruating at the times when\r\ntheir crimes were committed. _Krugenstein_ found evidence of\r\nmenstruation in the bodies of 107 women who committed suicide. Thefts\r\ncommitted by ladies in the great shops of Paris are most commonly\r\neffected during menstruation, as was found by _Legrand du Saulle_ to be\r\nthe case in thirty five instances out of fifty-six investigated by him\r\nin respect to this matter. According to the same author, hysterical\r\ngirls who steal articles of clothing, bottles of scent, and the like,\r\nfrom the counters of shops, are almost always menstruating at the time.\r\n\r\n_Von Krafft-Ebing_ puts forward the following propositions with regard\r\nto the forensic significance of offences committed by women during\r\nmenstruation: 1. The mental integrity of a menstruating woman is\r\nquestionable from the forensic standpoint. 2. In the case of women on\r\ntrial for any offence, the point should be determined whether that\r\noffence was committed at a menstrual period. 3. An inquiry into the\r\nmental condition is expedient in cases in which such a coincidence is\r\nestablished; light is thrown on the matter when investigation shows the\r\nexistence of hereditary predisposition, when we learn that psychopathic\r\nmanifestations have occurred at previous menstrual periods, or when the\r\nvery nature of the offence is one suggesting the presence of mental\r\ndisorder. 4. A recognition of the powerful influence which the menstrual\r\nprocess exercises upon the mental life should lead, even in cases in\r\nwhich no menstrual psychosis has been proved to exist, to the admission\r\nof extenuating circumstances in apportioning the punishment for the\r\noffence. 5. In the case of the commission of a punishable act during\r\nmenstruation by a weak-minded individual, we must as a rule admit the\r\nplea of irresponsibility—at any rate in the case of an offence committed\r\nunder the influence of strong emotion. 6. Persons who have been\r\ndischarged without punishment on the plea of mental disorder\r\naccompanying menstruation must be regarded as dangerous to the\r\ncommunity, and should always be under careful supervision during the\r\nmenstrual periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _Amenorrhœa, Menorrhagia, and Dysmenorrhœa._\r\n\r\nAmenorrhœa, permanent or transient abnormal lack of the menstrual flow,\r\nmay depend upon anatomical changes in the genital organs, upon\r\nincomplete development or absence of the uterus and the ovaries, upon\r\nenduring or transient defective nutrition or upon atrophy of these\r\norgans, or upon parenchymatous disease of the ovaries; or it may be due\r\nto functional disturbances of ovarian activity, itself dependent upon\r\nchanges in the nervous system, upon constitutional diseases, or upon\r\ngeneral nutritive disturbances in the body. Among the latter conditions\r\nmust be especially mentioned chlorosis, obesity, diabetes, chronic\r\nalcoholism, and morphinism, myxoedema, exophthalmic goitre, etc.\r\n\r\nThe amenorrhœa that occurs at the time of the menarche has already been\r\ndescribed in connection with the symptomatology of that period.\r\n\r\nIf in cases of amenorrhœa the ovaries continue to perform their\r\nfunctions, we frequently witness severe and painful menstrual molimina,\r\noccurring periodically at the times when the flow might be expected, but\r\nfails to appear. In cases of atrophy of the uterus and the ovaries, we\r\nsee complete and permanent amenorrhœa without any discomfort. As a kind\r\nof vicarious menstruation, in certain cases of amenorrhœa, we see\r\nhæmorrhages into the vitreous body or conjunctival hæmorrhages; also, as\r\nmore extensive disturbances of the visual organs, interstitial\r\nkeratitis, disseminated choroiditis, intermittent amaurosis, acute\r\nretrobulbar neuritis, amblyopia, and limitation of the field of vision.\r\n\r\n_Mooren_ publishes the following cases, showing the influence of\r\namaurosis on the eye. A girl aged fourteen, with severe bilateral\r\npannous keratitis, was amenorrhoeic notwithstanding the existence of\r\nwell-marked menstrual molimina. Every four weeks, at the times when the\r\nmenstrual flow should have appeared, the corneal inflammation became\r\nmore severe; it became amenable to treatment for the first time a year\r\nlater, when the menstrual flow had become established. A peasant woman,\r\ntwenty-eight years of age, had never menstruated; the uterus was badly\r\ndeveloped; every month an intolerable heat and swelling of the face\r\nrecurred. Since the age of fifteen she had suffered from bilateral\r\ninterstitial keratitis, which had resisted all treatment, and had been\r\nsubject every four weeks to a recurrent exacerbation of this trouble,\r\nlasting several days. The exhibition of powerful emmenagogues and the\r\nuse of Friedrichshall water brought about on a few occasions a scanty\r\ndischarge of blood. The comfort to the patient, relieved as if by\r\nmiracle from her pain and photophobia, was most remarkable.\r\nUnfortunately, however, this state of comparative happiness lasted from\r\ntwelve to fourteen weeks only, after which, in spite of everything that\r\nwas tried, there was no further recurrence of menstruation, and the\r\ncondition of the eyes relapsed to what had existed for thirteen years.\r\nIn other cases described by _Mooren_ the amenorrhœa was complicated with\r\ndisseminated choroiditis and with posterior sclero-choroiditis.\r\n\r\n_Beer_ reports a case of retrobulbar neuritis occurring with amenorrhœa,\r\nconsequent on infantile aplasia of the uterus. An interesting case was\r\nrecorded by _Dunn_ of a girl fifteen years of age, who had not yet begun\r\nto menstruate, and who suffered from interstitial keratitis, with severe\r\nphotophobia. The ocular symptoms vanished with extreme rapidity as soon\r\nas menstruation first appeared. _Napier_ observed complete blindness,\r\nwithout discernible anatomical cause, associated with amenorrhœa of\r\nsudden onset; the amaurosis disappeared as soon as menstruation was\r\nre-established.\r\n\r\nStriking and manifold are the disturbances of the nervous system which\r\nmay be caused by amenorrhœa, ranging from increased irritability,\r\nhyperæsthesia of various nerve tracts, neuralgia, and the like, to\r\nsevere psychoses.\r\n\r\n_Barnes_ reports a case of mental disturbance consequent upon amenorrhœa\r\nin a woman twenty-seven years of age, who had begun to menstruate when\r\nsixteen years old, and in whom the menses had been suppressed a year\r\nearlier when she was informed of the sudden death of her father. From\r\nthat time a progressively increasing weakness of the mind was observed.\r\nIn a case recorded by _Macnaughton Jones_ the mental depression\r\nconsequent on amenorrhœa was so great that it led to an attempt at\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\n_Lawrence_ observed in young girls who from any cause suffered from\r\namenorrhœa, that an increased pigmentation of the skin sometimes\r\noccurred, analogous to that met with in _Addison’s_ disease. This\r\namenorrhoeic pigmentation he compares to the chloasma that is seen in\r\npregnant women.\r\n\r\nBy menorrhagia we understand the occurrence of typical discharges of\r\nblood from the uterus, occurring at more or less regular intervals and\r\ndiffering from normal menstruation in respect either of the greater\r\nintensity or of the longer duration of the hæmorrhage; whereas by\r\nmetrorrhagia we understand the occurrence of atypical discharge of blood\r\nfrom the uterus, which is related to menstruation neither in respect to\r\nits causation nor in respect to the time of its appearance.\r\n\r\nMenorrhagia may be due to local changes in the genital organs, to\r\norganic diseases of other organs, and to general diseases.\r\n\r\nLocal changes which may give rise to menorrhagia are, active hyperæmia\r\nand passive hyperæmia (hyperæmia from engorgement) of the genital\r\norgans, such hyperæmia being itself due to sexual excitement, especially\r\nwhen ungratified, to violent physical exercise, or to chill during\r\nmenstruation; menorrhagia is also liable to occur when the abdominal\r\ncirculation is disturbed by extreme obesity or by the presence of\r\ntumors, also in connection with endometritis, uterine myomata, erosions\r\nof the cervix, etc. Diseases of organs other than those belonging to the\r\nreproductive system which are especially likely to give rise to severe\r\nbleeding are, disease of the heart, such as valvular incompetence, lung\r\ndisease, and nephritis. General diseases in which menorrhagia may occur\r\nare, anæmia, chlorosis, hæmophilia, scurvy, scarlatina, cholera,\r\nsmallpox, influenza, and obesity.\r\n\r\nThrough severe loss of blood in menorrhagia, whether the bleeding be\r\nsudden and profuse or more moderate but long continued, a condition of\r\nchronic anæmia results, with all its threatening consequences to the\r\nhealth and the life of the woman affected. She becomes pale and weak,\r\nunfitted for any great physical or mental exertion, and is liable to\r\nattacks of cardiac enfeeblement and to fainting fits; in some cases\r\ndegenerative changes ensue in the cardiac muscle.\r\n\r\nDysmenorrhœa is characterized by severe pain occurring before, during,\r\nand after menstruation. The pain is caused either by abnormally powerful\r\ncontractions of the uterus or else by abnormal sensitiveness of that\r\norgan. Abnormally powerful contractions are caused by various mechanical\r\nhindrances to the normal processes of menstruation; abnormal\r\nsensitiveness is due to inflammatory and congestive states of the uterus\r\nand its annexa or to a general increase of nervous sensibility.\r\n\r\n_Schauta_, therefore, distinguishes a mechanical, an inflammatory, and a\r\nnervous form of dysmenorrhœa. Mechanical dysmenorrhœa is most frequently\r\ndue to stenosis or flexion of the canal of the cervix in some part of\r\nits course from the internal to the external os, dependent upon\r\nmalformation or flexion of the uterus, hyperplasia of the mucous\r\nmembrane, chronic metritis, scarring resulting from operative\r\nprocedures, uterine polypi, etc. In inflammatory dysmenorrhœa we have to\r\ndo “either with an inflammatory process or with excessive tension of the\r\nintrapelvic organs, dependent upon abnormal distension of their blood\r\nvessels.” To the same category belong ovarian dysmenorrhœa, and\r\ndysmenorrhœa due to inflammatory changes in the Fallopian tubes and to\r\npelvic peritonitis. In nervous dysmenorrhœa, no anatomical cause is\r\napparent, but the uterine contractions normally occurring during\r\nmenstruation, and the normal congestive distension of the intrapelvic\r\norgans at that period, become extremely painful, in consequence of a\r\nmorbid increase in the sensibility of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nThe influence of dysmenorrhœa on the general condition of the woman\r\nsuffering from it is often a very potent one.\r\n\r\nThe normal undulatory course of the bodily temperature—which as _Reinl_\r\nhas shown, undergoes a gradual rise until shortly before the appearance\r\nof the menstrual flow, gradually falls during menstruation, and\r\ncontinues to fall for a time after menstruation is over—undergoes a\r\nchange in cases of dysmenorrhœa due to anteflexion of the uterus,\r\nparametritis, or salpingitis, inasmuch as in these cases the acme of the\r\ntemperature curve is reached actually during menstruation and the\r\ndecline of temperature comes, not at the commencement of the menstrual\r\nflow, but often only after the flow has ceased. The curve of blood\r\npressure and the curve indicating the excretion of urea are similarly\r\naffected in these cases.\r\n\r\nAs symptoms in other organs occurring in cases of dysmenorrhœa _Schauta_\r\nmentions “sensations of heat, coldness of the feet, retching and\r\nvomiting, cramps of the stomach and of the voluntary muscles, general\r\ndisorders of nutrition, loss of appetite, strangury, constipation,\r\ndyspepsia, headache, and finally hysteria. As symptoms of the latter\r\naffection we may notice, anæsthesia, hyperæthesia of certain parts of\r\nthe abdomen, attacks of cramp, paralysis, uterine cough, hiccough, spasm\r\nof the glottis, epileptiform seizures. The repeated severe attacks of\r\npain may seriously disturb the nervous system, leading to the appearance\r\nof general neuroses and psychoses. Frequently we observe, as a peculiar\r\naccompaniment of dysmenorrhœa, changes in the fulness of the blood\r\nvessels of the face and also in other regions of the skin, in\r\nconsequence of vascular paralysis. In other cases, actual effusion of\r\nblood occurs, and, as a sequel of this, deposits of pigment; and the\r\nsemicircles beneath the eyes may become so dark as to look as if they\r\nhad been artificially tinted (_Macnaughton Jones_). In one case, during\r\nmenstruation periodic swelling of the gums was observed (_Regnier_).\r\nFinally, in association with dysmenorrhœa, various forms of neuralgia,\r\nchanges in refraction, and slight attacks of neuritis and retinitis may\r\noccur.”\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest symptoms and sequelæ is headache, sometimes in the\r\nform of hemicrania, which may be associated with dyspeptic\r\nmanifestations, sometimes diffused over the whole surface of the skull.\r\n\r\nDyspepsia is a very frequent associate of dysmenorrhœa. Thus we meet\r\nwith pain and tenderness in the gastric region, nausea, vomiting, and\r\nalso cardialgia. Sometimes the liver becomes enlarged and tender on\r\npressure; in many cases also jaundice is witnessed.\r\n\r\n_Gebhard_ refers to another phenomenon which may be classed under the\r\nhead of dysmenorrhœa, from the character of the pain that is\r\nexperienced, even though this pain is not felt at the menstrual periods,\r\nbut in the intermenstrual epoch. This is the so-called intermediate\r\ndysmenorrhœa (intermenstrual pain, Ger. _Mittelschmerz_). In the\r\ncharacter of the localized pain, intermediate dysmenorrhœa closely\r\nresembles ordinary dysmenorrhœa; it recurs often with precise regularity\r\non certain days during the intermenstrual interval. _Croom_\r\ndistinguishes three forms of intermediate dysmenorrhœa; that in which\r\nthere is no discharge at all from the uterus, that in which there is a\r\nsanguineous discharge, and that in which there is a clear watery\r\ndischarge. The first form he attributes to asynchronism in the processes\r\nof ovulation and menstruation; the second form, to endometritis with\r\ndisintegration of the mucous membrane; the third, to a kind of hydrops\r\ntubæ profluens (profluent dropsy of the Fallopian tubes—hydrosalpinx in\r\nwhich the fluid accumulates in the tube, and at a certain stage of its\r\naccumulation flows into the uterus). Cases of intermediate dysmenorrhœa\r\nare somewhat rare, if we eliminate the cases in which pains occur in the\r\nintermenstrual epoch in consequence of disease of the uterine annexa.\r\nInflammatory manifestations may be discovered in nearly all typical\r\ncases of intermediate dysmenorrhœa.\r\n\r\nLong-continued dysmenorrhœa may give rise to numerous hysterical\r\ntroubles, general convulsive seizures, local muscular spasm and\r\nparalysis, hiccough, spasm of the glottis, uterine cough, twitching and\r\nspasm of various groups of voluntary muscles. In some cases we see fully\r\ndeveloped epileptic convulsions, with complete loss of consciousness and\r\nimmobility of the pupils. Finally, psychoses may arise in association\r\nwith dysmenorrhœa.\r\n\r\nIn cases of pathological changes in menstruation, a carefully arranged\r\nhygiene at the menstrual periods is of importance both for prophylactic\r\nand for therapeutic purposes, and in this connection I may refer to what\r\nI have written in the section on _Hygiene during the Menarche_. In cases\r\nof dysmenorrhœa a certain amount of repose and precaution are needed\r\nduring the flow, with avoidance of chill, scrupulous cleanliness, and\r\nregulation of the bowels. In cases of amenorrhœa we must prescribe\r\nattention to the general nutrition by means of an easily digested\r\nroborant diet, as much fresh air as possible, and systematic bodily\r\nexercise. In these cases, bicycling, lawn tennis, and suitable\r\ngymnastics are often of value; also baths, in the form of warm general\r\nbaths, hot sitz baths, and hot foot baths.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Vicarious Menstruation._\r\n\r\nIn cases in which, in consequence of morbid conditions of the uterus,\r\nthe ovaries, or the organism as a whole, the menstrual flow has at the\r\ntime of the menarche either failed entirely to appear or been\r\nexceedingly scanty, hæmorrhages from other organs have since ancient\r\ntimes been witnessed, and these hæmorrhages have been regarded as\r\nvicarious menstruation. The congestion that occurs during menstruation\r\nis not limited to the genital organs, and when the flow of blood from\r\nthe uterus fails to occur, the organism seeks another outlet, in order\r\nto restore the disturbed equilibrium of blood distribution, and\r\nvicarious hæmorrhages take place from the mouth, the nose, the\r\nintestines, the anus, the gums, the mammæ, the ears, and the lungs; or\r\nhæmorrhages occur in the brain, the nerves, or the eyes.\r\n\r\nAlthough it must be admitted that confusion has often occurred between\r\nvicarious menstruation and hæmorrhages dependent on pre-existing genuine\r\norganic disease, such as hæmoptysis due to pulmonary tuberculosis, or\r\nhæmatemesis due to gastric ulcer, still the existence of a true\r\nvicarious menstruation must be regarded as fully established.\r\n\r\nThus, _Fricker_, _Fleischmann_, _Obermeier_, _Beigel_, _Withrow_,\r\n_Plyette_, and _Parsons_ observed vicarious epistaxis; _Watson_,\r\n_Decaisne_, _Edebohls_, _Fischel_, and _Seeligmann_, vicarious\r\nhæmatemesis; _Franchi_, _Hotte_, _Ratgen_, _Voigt_, and _Windmüller_,\r\nvicarious hæmoptysis; _Dunlap_, vicarious gingival hæmorrhage; _Law_ and\r\n_Petiteau_, vicarious otorrhagia; _Heusinger_ and _le Fort_, vicarious\r\nhæmorrhages, occurring variously from the anus, bladder, hand, ear,\r\nnipple, stomach, and nose; _Baumgarten_, vicarious hæmorrhage from the\r\nvocal cords and trachea; _Hahn_, from the bladder; _Kerley_, in the\r\nthyroid body; _Gallemairts_, in the eyes. _Puech_ found, in the cases he\r\ncollected, that vicarious menstrual hæmorrhage occurred from the stomach\r\nthirty-eight times, from the mammary glands twenty-five times, from the\r\nlungs twenty-four times, and from the nasal mucous membrane eighteen\r\ntimes. In all the cases menstruation had long been in abeyance.\r\n\r\nRegarding vicarious epistaxis, especially exact observations have been\r\npublished, showing the mutual relationship between the genital and the\r\nnasal mucous membrane. A series of cases has been recorded by _Fliess_.\r\nIn one of these a remarkably well-developed girl of fourteen, who\r\ncomplained at three-weekly intervals of molimina, in the form of\r\nlanguor, headache, and sacrache, after an interval of four weeks\r\nepistaxis occurred instead of the expected menstruation; three weeks\r\nlater came another attack of epistaxis; and finally, after an interval\r\nof seven weeks, came the first menstruation, which henceforward recurred\r\nevery three weeks. In another case, that of a girl aged fifteen,\r\nmenstruation appeared once; four weeks later came an attack of epistaxis\r\ninstead of menstruation, and these attacks of epistaxis were continually\r\nrepeated, at intervals of twenty-nine days, in place of menstruation,\r\nuntil finally pregnancy occurred. During pregnancy the epistaxis ceased,\r\nto recur however six weeks after parturition; the attacks continued for\r\neight monthly periods, when they ceased finally at the commencement of\r\nthe second pregnancy.\r\n\r\nOther similar cases are known in which epistaxis recurred with all the\r\nregularity of the menstruation it replaced _during_ pregnancy and ceased\r\nat parturition. Analogous cases occur in which epistaxis has persisted\r\nduring pregnancy, during the puerperium, and at the climacteric period,\r\nreplacing the physiologically suppressed menstrual flow. Similarly\r\n_Liégois_ has observed vicarious hæmoptysis during pregnancy. According\r\nto _Baumgarten_, in vicarious epistaxis the bleeding almost always\r\nproceeds from the region of the cartilaginous septum, and may become\r\nvery violent; vicarious hæmorrhage from the larynx proceeds from the\r\ntrue and false vocal cords. Tracheal hæmorrhage is a much rarer\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nAnalogous to these cases are those in which the vicarious hæmorrhages\r\noccur after removal of the ovaries. Thus _Tauffer_ in one case saw\r\nepistaxis replace menstruation after this operation. _Schmalfuss_\r\nreports a case in which a woman suffering from valvular disease of the\r\nheart, was said after oöphorectomy to have had almost daily attacks of\r\nhæmoptysis and epistaxis. _Glaevecke_ found in the post-operative\r\nhistory of forty-four cases of oöphorectomy that two patients suffered\r\nfrom vicarious hæmorrhages. The last-quoted author is of opinion that\r\nthe suppression of menstruation resulting from oöphorectomy rarely leads\r\nto vicarious hæmorrhages, and that even when these do occur they are so\r\ninconsiderable in amount as to have no practical significance.\r\n\r\n_Quain_ records the case of a woman aged thirty-three, in whom uterus\r\nand ovaries were absent, and in whom for two years epistaxis recurred\r\nevery month with considerable regularity.\r\n\r\nIn cases in which menstruation is in abeyance, we sometimes witness,\r\ninstead of vicarious hæmorrhages, the occurrence of non-sanguineous\r\nvicarious discharges from various mucous membranes. Thus, vicarious\r\nleucorrhœa is seen, especially in chlorotic patients, in whom, from the\r\ntime of the menarche onward, such a discharge may occur every month,\r\ninstead of the delayed menstruation. Similarly, vicarious diarrhœa and\r\nvicarious salivation have been observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SEXUAL IMPULSE.\r\n\r\nBy the term _sexual impulse_, we understand the impulse shared by women\r\nand by men towards intimate physical contact and sexual intercourse with\r\nindividuals of the opposite sex. In the child this impulse slumbers, to\r\nawaken at the menarche with the onset of puberty, to increase slowly at\r\nfirst, and then more rapidly, after the manner of an avalanche, until it\r\nbecomes a powerful passion, dominant throughout the active sexual life\r\nof the woman, and it may even continue far beyond this period. The\r\nproper aim for whose attainment the sexual impulse in woman strives is\r\nby no means (as is asserted in some quarters) the fulfilment of “the\r\nimpulse toward motherhood,” but is merely the complete satisfaction of\r\nsensual passion by intercourse with the male. Still, the sexual impulse\r\nis often satisfied by the minor degrees of sexual gratification in the\r\nform of the mutual contact, so agreeable to the sense of touch, of\r\nportions of the body, and even by the play of imagination and illusion\r\nunder the dominion of love. Finally, also, love amounts to what\r\n_Buffon_, the celebrated naturalist, expressed with coarse incisiveness\r\nin the phrase, “L’amour c’est le frôlement de deux intestins.”\r\n\r\nIn the sexually mature woman, the sexual impulse always exists, though\r\nits strength varies in accordance with individual inheritance, with\r\nphysical and mental condition, and with external circumstances, and\r\nthough its manifestation may be repressed by force of will. The\r\nsensation of the sexual impulse in a maiden during the years of\r\ndevelopment is described by _Goethe_ in a masterly manner in the\r\nverses.[33]\r\n\r\n                       “Meine Ruh ist hin\r\n                       Mein Herz ist schwer,\r\n                       Ich finde sie nimmer\r\n                       Und nimmermehr.\r\n                       Mein Busen drängt\r\n                       Sich nach ihm hin,\r\n                       Ach, dürft ich ihn fassen\r\n                       Und halten ihn\r\n                       Und küssen ihn,\r\n                       So wie ich wollt,\r\n                       An seinen Küssen\r\n                       Vergehen sollt.”\r\n\r\nA resemblance to heat or rut in animals, who exhibit the sexual impulse\r\nonly at definite periods, those at which the ovules ripen, is manifested\r\nin females of the human species only in so far as there is during\r\nmenstruation a more intense sexual sensibility; but the limitation of\r\nthe sexual impulse to definite periods, and its close association with\r\nreproduction, are not found in women. Education and morality impose\r\nartificial limitations on the sexual impulse in women, whilst nature\r\nendows this impulse with a coercive power, a fact recognized by thinkers\r\nof all times and all peoples. Thus, _Buddha_ wrote: “The sexual impulse\r\nis stronger than the ankus with which the wild elephant is controlled,\r\nit is hotter than flame, it is like unto an arrow driven into the spirit\r\nof man.” In a similar sense _Luther_ writes: “He who wishes to restrain\r\nthe impulse of nature and not to allow it free play, as nature will and\r\nmust, what does he do but this, to insist that nature shall not be\r\nnature, that fire shall not burn, that water shall not wet, that man\r\nshall neither eat, drink, nor sleep.” _Schopenhaur_ describes the sexual\r\nimpulse as “the completest outward manifestation of the will to live,\r\nthe concentration, that is to say, of all wills. * * * The affirmation\r\nof the will to live concentrates itself in the act of generation, and\r\nthis act is its most determined expression.” _Mainländer_ in his\r\n_Philosophy of Deliverance_ makes the following statement: “In the\r\nsexual impulse lies the centre of gravity of human life. To nothing does\r\nman devote a more earnest attention than to the business of generation,\r\nand in the pursuit of no other aim does he concentrate the intensity of\r\nhis will in so striking a manner as in the performance of the act of\r\ngeneration.” _Debay_ similarly insists on the strength of the sexual\r\nimpulse, saying: “The union of the sexes is one of the great laws of\r\nnature; to that law men and women are subordinated as completely as all\r\nother creatures, they cannot escape its operation.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the general opinion, the sexual impulse is not so strongly\r\ndeveloped in women as it is in men. _Hegar_, _Litzmann_, _Lombroso_, _P.\r\nMüller_, and many others, assume that the sexual sensibility of women is\r\nless than that of men; _Fürbringer_ is inclined to attribute the\r\ncharacteristic of sexual frigidity to the great majority of German\r\nwives. I do not believe that this view, of the slight intensity of the\r\nsexual impulse in women in general, is well grounded, and can admit only\r\nthis much, that in adolescent girls who are inexperienced in sexual\r\nmatters, the sexual impulse is less powerful than in youths of the same\r\nage who have undergone sexual enlightenment. From the moment when the\r\nwoman also has been fully enlightened as to sexual affairs, and has\r\nactually experienced sexual excitement, her impulse toward intimate\r\nphysical contact and toward copulation is just as powerful as that of\r\nmen. According, however, to the dominant artificial conditions, man\r\nassumes it as his right to give free rein to his sexual desires and to\r\ngratify them without regard to consequences, whereas woman, narrowly\r\nconfined within the boundaries imposed by law and convention, cannot so\r\nreadily yield to her inclination in the direction of physical love, and\r\nmust forcibly control that inclination. Moreover, a powerful check on\r\nthe free indulgence of the sexual impulse is imposed on woman by the\r\nconsequences of such indulgence, consequences which exist for woman\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nI may further indicate as differential characteristics, that in woman\r\nthe sexual impulse is more accessible to voluntary control than it is in\r\nman, the ardor of female sexual passion is more readily diminished than\r\nthat of the male; and again that in the female the gratification of the\r\nsexual impulse is less narrowly restricted than in the male. Excessive\r\nsexual gratification on the one hand and suppression of sexual desire on\r\nthe other are, generally speaking, less harmful to the female organism\r\nthan to the male. In these differentiæ is to be found, in my opinion,\r\nthe influence which determines the type of sexuality in the respective\r\nsexes.\r\n\r\nThe following account is given by _Havelock Ellis_ of the differential\r\ncharacters of the sexual impulse in the female: “In courtship, woman\r\nplays a more passive part than man; in woman the physiological mechanism\r\nof the sexual processes is more complicated, and the orgasm develops\r\nmore deliberately; the sexual impulse in woman needs more frequently to\r\nbe actively stimulated; the culmination of sexual activity is attained\r\nlater in the life of woman than in the life of man, the strength of\r\nsexual desire in woman becomes greater after she has entered upon\r\nregular sexual intercourse, women bear sexual excesses better than men;\r\nthe sexual sphere is larger and more widely diffused in women than it is\r\nin men; finally, in woman the sexual impulse exhibits a distinct\r\ntendency to periodic exacerbations, and it is in any case much more\r\nvariable than in man.” The same author, who has published several\r\nnotable biological studies on subjects connected with sex, maintains\r\nthat the source of erotic pleasure in the case of the male lies in\r\nactivity, but in the female in the passive state, in the experience of\r\ncompulsion, and he holds that sexual subordination is a necessary\r\nelement in the sexual enjoyment of women.\r\n\r\n_Hegar_ maintains that under the term _sexual impulse_ two distinct\r\nconceptions are confounded: First, the impulse toward copulation, the\r\ndesire of carnal union with a member of the opposite sex; secondly, the\r\nimpulse toward reproduction, the desire for children. At the same time,\r\nthis author admits that it is questionable if we can properly speak of\r\nan impulse toward reproduction, when reproduction is merely a\r\nconsequence of copulation; in the case of civilized man, at any rate, so\r\nmuch reflection is connected with the idea of reproduction that it can\r\nhardly be proper to speak of anything of the nature of an impulse. In\r\nthe case of woman, the expression is less unsuitable, since in woman\r\nspecial organs exist for the maintenance of the ovum after\r\nfertilization, and these organs may perhaps lead to the production of\r\nthis peculiar form of mental activity.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Darwin_, a comparatively less intensity of sexual desire\r\nis common to the females of all species of the animal kingdom. The\r\nfemale demands a prolonged courtship, and often endeavors for a\r\nconsiderable time to elude the male. In the lowest classes of the animal\r\nkingdom the female leads a separate existence as soon as she has been\r\nfertilized by the male, the sexual functions being thus subordinated to\r\nthe maternal. Among birds at the pairing season the male is always the\r\nmore passionate and active of the two, whilst the female commonly\r\nremains passive and occupies herself in building the nest. Among\r\nmammals, it is difficult to determine whether sexual feeling is stronger\r\nin the female or in the male; but it is certain that sexual relations\r\nare seldom long lasting, they continue in most cases only during the\r\nperiod of heat or rut, and at most only till the birth of the young.\r\n\r\nFrom these phenomena witnessed in the animal kingdom, many naturalists\r\nhave concluded that in females of the human species also, sexual\r\nsensibility and the intensity of the sexual impulse are less than in the\r\nmales, and even that the sexual sense in general is but little developed\r\nin the female sex, or sometimes entirely wanting. The complicated\r\napparatus which the primary and secondary sexual characters of the\r\nfemale combine to make up, exists, according to this view, not for the\r\ngratification of the sexual impulse, but for the fulfilment of the\r\nfunction of motherhood. “Love in women,” says _Lombroso_, “is in its\r\nfundamental nature no more than a secondary character of motherhood, and\r\nall the feelings of affection that bind woman to man arise, not from\r\nsexual impulses, but from the instincts, acquired by adaptation, of\r\nsubordination and self-surrender.”\r\n\r\n_Mantegazza_ lays stress on the fact that in the female, sexual desire\r\nis very rarely accompanied by pains analogous to those which occur in\r\nman, in whom sexual excitement manifests itself in painful tension of\r\nthe testicle and the seminal vesicles, or in spasmodic, long-continued\r\npriapism.\r\n\r\n_Sergi_ writes to _Lombroso_: “The normal woman loves to be flattered\r\nand wooed by man, but yields herself to his sexual desires only like an\r\nanimal at the sacrifice. It is well known how much pains must be taken,\r\nhow many caresses must be expended, before a woman will yield with\r\npleasure to a man’s desires, and will share his sexual passion. Without\r\nthe employment of these means, a woman remains cold and gives as little\r\nsatisfaction as she feels. There are girls who are quite obtuse to the\r\njoys of love, and either resist energetically a man’s approaches, or\r\nyield to him passively, without ardor and without enthusiasm. It is well\r\nknown, also, that among the lower races of mankind, means are employed\r\nto stimulate the sexual sensibility in women, means that seem to us to\r\namount to torture; and that the male, with the same end in view,\r\nundergoes the most painful operations, from which it is apparent that\r\nthe slight sexual sensibility of women in these lower grades of\r\ncivilization is fully recognized.” And again: “If a normal woman marries\r\nfor love, she hides that love deep in her heart, and even on the\r\nwedding-day exhibits no great sexual excitement; she often complains\r\nlater that in her husband the love-fervor of the first days still\r\ncontinues; the very moderate sexual needs of the wife form a natural and\r\nmost valuable check to the much more powerful passion of the male.”\r\n\r\n_Saint Prospêre_ expresses himself to a similar effect: “Women do not\r\nfall in consequence of the excessive power of the senses—in this domain\r\nthey are overlords, in striking contrast to men, whose weakest side is\r\nhere. It is not by means of the senses that a woman is to be overcome;\r\nher weakness lies elsewhere—in her heart, in her vanity.” And _de\r\nLambert_ wrote the epigram, “Women play with love, and yield themselves\r\nto love, but they do not abandon themselves to love.”\r\n\r\nWell known also is the saying of _Dante_:\r\n\r\n      “We know how speedily in women the fire of love is consumed\r\n      Unless eye and hand continually supply it with fresh fuel.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is asserted in the laws of the Hindus that sexual\r\ndesire in women can as little be satisfied or fed full as a devouring\r\nfire can be fed full of combustible materials, or as the ocean can be\r\noverfilled by the rivers that pour their waters into it.\r\n\r\n_Lombroso_ finds a proof of the sexual indifference of women and of the\r\ngreater sexual needs of man, in the existence of prostitution, with\r\nwhich can be contrasted the existence only among the degenerate classes\r\n(both rich and poor) of a small group of male prostitutes (alfons,\r\nsouteneurs). This author also refers to the rarity and uniformity in\r\nwomen of the sexual psychoses so frequent in men, as indications of the\r\nminor intensity of sexual desire in the former; and he refers also to a\r\nseries of facts, as for instance, to the occurrence of platonic love,\r\nwhich, though indeed often hypocritical, has a real existence more often\r\nin the female sex than in the male; to the long-enduring chastity of\r\ngirls, and to vows of chastity, which are rarely made except by females;\r\nmoreover, the ready adaptation of women to polygamy, as well as their\r\nscrupulous observance of monogamy, which latter for the male is nominal\r\nrather than actual. If in general the opposite view concerning women\r\nprevails, this is ascribed by _Lombroso_ to the fact, that love is the\r\nmost important circumstance in a woman’s life. The reason therefore,\r\nhowever, is to be found, not in the erotic sphere, but in the desire for\r\nthe satisfaction of the maternal instinct, and in a woman’s need for\r\nprotection. A celebrated accoucheur, _Giordano_, has remarked: “Man\r\nloves woman for the sake of the vulva; what woman loves in man is the\r\nhusband and the father. Comprehensively we may express the matter by\r\nsaying that woman has less eroticism and more sexuality.”\r\n\r\nAs a rule, remarks _Erb_, it is believed that the sexual impulse is less\r\nintense in women than in men. This is true enough, he writes, as regards\r\nyouthful and virgin individuals, who have not yet come into intimate\r\ncontact with men, and in whom sexual desire and sensibility have not yet\r\nbeen directly excited; later, however, when sexual intercourse has been\r\nbegun, a change usually takes place, and the sexual needs become active\r\nin women also, and demand satisfaction. It is well known that not a few\r\nwomen experience powerful and uncontrolled sensual inclinations, just\r\nlike those of men. On the other hand, we must insist that quite a large\r\nnumber of women possess the so-called _naturae frigidae_, and have no\r\nsensual inclination to sexual intercourse, to which they are either\r\nindifferent, or in some cases strongly averse, even regarding it with\r\nhorror. This lack of the sexual sense in women, is especially common in\r\nhysterical subjects, and _Erb_ reports that he has encountered quite a\r\nlarge number of cases of this character. Whether in quite healthy women\r\nwith normal sexual impulse, complete abstinence from sexual intercourse,\r\ntoo often compulsory but sometimes voluntarily undertaken, is harmful in\r\nits consequences—this, says _Erb_, is a question very difficult to\r\nanswer. Many such unfortunate women have assured him that they suffered\r\nseverely in consequence of their enforced continence; the majority of\r\nthese became neurasthenic or hysterical. The complication of purely\r\nphysical influences with mental influences, increases the difficulty of\r\nthe problem. Neurologists have observed women on whom continence was\r\nforced either during marriage or after its dissolution, who thereupon\r\nfell into a state of severe nervous exhaustion or nervous excitement, or\r\nsuffered from threatening or even actually developed psychoses. That\r\nsexual abstinence is “absolutely harmless,” as moralists and many\r\nphysicians would so gladly believe, appears to _Erb_ a quite\r\nunwarrantable assumption.\r\n\r\n“In the processes of reproduction,” continues Erb in his discussion of\r\nthis subject, “woman is the principal sufferer. With inhuman cruelty,\r\nnature has condemned woman to a far more difficult rôle than man in the\r\nintercourse of the sexes and in the preservation of the species; she is\r\noverpowered and forced by man, she is compelled to make the most severe\r\nsacrifices for the sake of the new generation, first when it is\r\ngerminating within her womb, and later when it is entrusted to her care;\r\nand only too frequently she fails to find the respect and protection due\r\nto her for the performance of these functions! Compared with the\r\nsacrifices made by woman, the temporary continence which is all that is\r\ndemanded from man will be admitted to be a small matter! It is fortunate\r\nthat as a rule the young woman who has never come into intimate contact\r\nwith the male, appears to be endowed by nature with a relatively weak\r\nsexual impulse! This unequal and unjust distribution of the male and\r\nfemale rôles on the part of nature may be regretted, but it cannot be\r\naltered.”\r\n\r\nThe modern advocates of the rights of women, who demand that in the\r\nsexual sphere also, woman should receive emancipation, oppose the view\r\nthat in the male the sexual impulse is stronger than in the female, and\r\nalso the view that whilst in the male the impulse is simply one toward\r\nsexual congress, in the female the determining motive to intercourse is\r\nfurnished by the desire for motherhood. They complain of “the perverse\r\nrepression in woman of the sexual impulse and its physiological\r\ngratification,” since sexual energy and sexual sensibility are equal in\r\nintensity and identical in quality in the female and in the male. Thus,\r\n_Johanna Elberskirchen_ writes (_Die Sexualempfindung bei Weib und\r\nMann_—Sexual Sensation in Woman and Man): “Body and soul, the whole\r\nbeing is subordinated to a single powerful feeling and impulse, a single\r\nwill flows through nerves and blood, forcing and driving the female\r\ntoward the male with irresistible power; the yearning, the longing for\r\nthe relief of sexual tension, the craving for the euphoria and fleshly\r\ndelight that dominate the whole personality. And this elementary sexual\r\nlonging it is that clouds the woman’s brain, that drives her into the\r\nman’s arms, that leads her to forget all the shame threatening her and\r\nher child, that brings her to sexual union—not the longing for a child,\r\nnot the so-called impulse to motherhood.” And again: “Woman yearns for\r\nlove, all her love-organs cry out for love, soul and body * * *. We do\r\nnot long only for the rude sexual act. We spiritualise it—at least some\r\nof us do so; at any rate we individualize it. It is one particular man\r\nwhom we desire, he alone can still our longing, our bodily and mental\r\nhunger for love. He satisfies us with all his love-affinities.”\r\nNaturally, also, the consequence is deduced, “a free course must be\r\ngiven to sexual sensation in women, and to the satisfaction of sexual\r\ndesire, within physiological limits, within the bounds of physiological\r\nnecessity.”\r\n\r\n_Löwenfeld_ asserts that in the life of woman the sexual functions play\r\na comparatively much greater part than in the life of man, woman’s\r\nthoughts and feelings are, that is to say, much more powerfully\r\ninfluenced by sexual matters than those of men; but none the less he is\r\nof opinion that in the normal woman the desire for sexual satisfaction\r\nis on the average less keen than in the normal man. Distinctly greater\r\nin woman is the erotic element only, the need to love and to be loved\r\nafter an ideal manner, which is excited by the reproductive glands just\r\nas much as is the simple sensual desire. Very frequently, manifestations\r\nof this ideal need are erroneously attributed to the sensual impulse,\r\nyet this latter may be entirely absent in cases in which the erotic\r\nelement is strongly developed. According to _Löwenfeld_, the sexual\r\nimpulse is altogether wanting in young girls before the time of puberty,\r\nand in elderly women (in the case of the latter we consider this\r\nassertion most questionable); this lack of the sexual impulse persists\r\nin girls for an indeterminate time even after puberty, as long as they\r\nremain free from all experience of sexual stimulation. In this respect\r\nthey offer a notable contrast to males of the same age. In normal girls,\r\naccording to the same author, erotic dreams and similar occurrences are\r\nentirely wanting, and specific sexual sensations therefore remain\r\nabsolutely unknown to them; hence it follows that the sexual impulse\r\ncannot, properly speaking, arise in such individuals, and in so far as\r\nthey experience any desire for sexual intercourse it can only take the\r\nform of a craving for some enjoyment, the nature of which is entirely\r\nunknown. The absolute lack of the sexual impulse (complete frigidity)\r\npersists, according to _Löwenfeld_, in a not inconsiderable proportion\r\nof women even after their introduction to sexual intercourse—_Effertz_\r\nestimates that such complete frigidity is permanent in 10 per cent. of\r\nall women—and in a still greater proportion of women the sensual impulse\r\nnever exceeds a certain minimal intensity (partial frigidity). It is\r\nprobable that in the higher classes of society, inherited\r\npredisposition, education, and perhaps also higher intelligence, combine\r\nto diminish the intensity of the sexual impulse. In contrast with these\r\nwomen of frigid temperament, however, we meet with women, certainly in\r\nvery limited numbers, whose sexual passions are extremely powerful, and\r\nwhose needs no man can satisfy.\r\n\r\n_Hegar_, who considers that the sexual impulse in women is seldom very\r\npowerful, draws the following conclusions in respect of the influence of\r\nsexual gratification, on the one hand, or of continence, on the other,\r\non the duration of life and on physical and mental health: “As far as\r\ncomparisons between married women and women vowed to celibacy (nuns and\r\nmembers of other celibate religious orders) justify any conclusion,\r\nsexual activity and inactivity, respectively, would appear to have\r\nlittle influence on the duration of life. Comparisons between married\r\nand single women show, indeed, that the gratification of the sexual\r\nimpulse and the processes of reproduction are distinctly injurious when\r\nexperienced before the attainment of complete sexual maturity. In\r\nmarried women up to the age of thirty, in some countries even up to the\r\nage of forty, the mortality is greater than in unmarried women. The\r\nnotably smaller mortality of married women, as compared with unmarried,\r\nafter the age of forty, is usually explained as the result of the\r\ncomplete fulfilment of the genital functions. It may, however, find a\r\ntruer explanation in the selection effected by marriage, especially when\r\nwe take into consideration that from the women thus selected the weaker\r\nindividuals have been previously weeded out by the processes of\r\nreproduction:\r\n\r\n“The lesser mortality of married men from the age of twenty upwards is\r\nto be explained by the selection of the fit which occurs in marriage, by\r\nthe smaller proportion of marriages among men engaged in hazardous\r\noccupations, and by the deterioration in the quality of the unmarried\r\nwhich results from emigration. Still the directly favorable influence of\r\nmarriage is undeniable, and, no doubt, the ethical factors of this\r\ninstitution have a beneficial effect, whereas the gratification of the\r\nsexual impulse hardly enters into the account.\r\n\r\n“Suicide is certainly very little dependent upon repression of the\r\nsexual impulse, since all the motives arising out of the affairs of love\r\nplay together but a small part among the causes of suicide.\r\n\r\n“The beneficial influence of marriage in the prevention of insanity is\r\nin part apparent merely, since, in the selection exercised by marriage,\r\nthose predisposed to mental disorder, and those in whom such disorder\r\nhas already manifested itself, are, for the most part, already excluded.\r\nStill, as regards the male sex at any rate, the beneficial influence of\r\nmarriage is undeniable, and consists principally in the favorable\r\nethical factors of this state. In women, on the other hand, the\r\nadvantage of marriage is doubtful, since the nerve centres and the\r\nnervous system as a whole are strongly affected by the processes of\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\n“Satyriasis, nymphomania, and hysteria are in no way dependent upon the\r\nrepression of the sexual impulse.\r\n\r\n“Criminality in the married is comparatively less common than in the\r\nunmarried. In criminal assaults on young persons, repressed sexual\r\nimpulse plays a part.\r\n\r\n“Chlorosis is not in any way dependent on repression of the sexual\r\nimpulse. A disease apparently analogous to chlorosis, occurring in\r\nunmarried women from twenty to thirty years of age, is dependent rather\r\non mental causes, and is relieved by other means than marriage,\r\nespecially by suitable occupation. Marriage and gestation are distinctly\r\ninjurious in cases of true chlorosis.\r\n\r\n“The satisfaction of the sexual impulse, and still more gestation, favor\r\nin women the origin and growth of tumors, give rise often to mechanical\r\ndisturbances, and open the way for the invasion of toxic pathogenic\r\ngerms.\r\n\r\n“Osteomalacia occurs only in parous women.”\r\n\r\n_Moll_ divides the sexual impulse into two components: The impulse\r\ntoward intimate contact (in a sense both physical and mental) with a\r\nperson of the opposite sex, which he calls the contrectation-impulse\r\n(_Kontrektationstrieb_); and the impulse to bring about a change in\r\nthe genital organs, which he calls the detumescence-impulse\r\n(_Detumeszenztrieb_). The former impulse induces intimate physical and\r\nmental contact between the two persons concerned, the latter impulse\r\ninduces the local processes of copulation. In women, detumescence\r\nresults from the passing off of local swelling and the release of\r\nnervous tension in the genital organs, with the discharge of\r\nindifferent glandular secretions, notably the secretion of Bartholin’s\r\nglands, and perhaps also the secretion of the uterine glands. The\r\nintensity of the detumescence-impulse in women varies greatly in\r\ndifferent individuals, these variations being more extensive than\r\nthose occurring in the male. In some women the impulse toward intimate\r\ncontact, the contrectation-impulse, is normal, though the\r\ndetumescence-impulse is wholly wanting (_vide_ Dyspareunia).\r\n\r\n_Runge_ defines the sexual impulse as the impulse which brings the sexes\r\ntogether. This impulse is subservient to an instinct, namely the\r\ninstinct of reproduction; that is to say, the sexual impulse induces the\r\nindividual to perform actions which subserve the purpose of reproduction\r\nwithout the agent’s being directly or chiefly concerned with this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe sexual impulse, as sensation, perception, and impulse, is,\r\naccording to _von Krafft-Ebing_, a function of the cerebral cortex; a\r\ncentre for the sexual sense has not as yet, however, been localized.\r\nThe close relations which obtain between the sexual life and the sense\r\nof smell lead to the supposition that the sexual and the olfactory\r\nspheres of the cerebral cortex are in close proximity one with the\r\nother. The development of the sexual life has its beginnings in the\r\norganic sensations of the developing reproductive glands. A mutual\r\ndependence now arises between the cerebral cortex as place of origin\r\nof sensations and perceptions, and the organs of generation. By\r\nanatomico-physiological processes these now give rise to sexual\r\nperceptions, representations, and impulses. The cerebral cortex, by\r\napperceived or reproduced sensuous perceptions, influences the organs\r\nof generation. This influence is effected by the intermediation of the\r\ncentres of vascular innervation and ejaculation, which are situated in\r\nthe lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord, and are certainly in close\r\nproximity one with the other. Both are reflex centres.\r\n\r\nThe psycho-physiological process embraced in the conception of the\r\nsexual impulse is according to _von Krafft-Ebing_ constituted in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\nI. Of the central or peripherally aroused perceptions.\r\n\r\nII. Of the pleasurable sensations associated with these.\r\n\r\nHence arises the impulse to sexual satisfaction (libido sexualis). This\r\nimpulse becomes stronger in proportion as cerebral excitement,\r\nconsequent on appropriate perceptions and the working of the\r\nimagination, strengthens the intensity of these pleasurable sensations.\r\nIf the conditions are favorable to the performance of the sexual act by\r\nmeans of which satisfaction is attained, the continually increasing\r\nimpulse finds expression in action; in other circumstances, inhibitory\r\nperceptions intervene, sexual excitement diminishes, the activity of the\r\ncentre for erection is inhibited, and the sexual act itself is\r\nprevented. In the case of civilized humanity the ready action of such\r\nperceptions for the inhibition of the sexual impulse is necessary and\r\ndecisive. On the strength of the impulsive perceptions the constitution\r\nand various organic processes have an important influence; on the\r\nstrength of the inhibitory perceptions, education and the cultivation of\r\nself-control are powerfully operative.\r\n\r\nIn addition to mental influences, all forms of local irritation of the\r\nsensory nerves of the female genital organs and adjacent parts, by\r\ninternal processes or external friction, serve to increase the strength\r\nof the sexual impulse. Among internal processes which stimulate the\r\nerectile centre by centripetal impulses must be included, the stimulus\r\nof the enlarged graafian follicle, stasis in various vascular areas of\r\nthe genital organs in consequence of a sedentary mode of life, abdominal\r\nplethora from excessive consumption of food and stimulating drinks, and\r\nhabitual constipation. External friction may be in the form of\r\nintentional manipulation, but it may be due to certain bodily attitudes\r\nor to the arrangement of the clothing.\r\n\r\nIn normally constituted individuals, the sexual impulse is by no means\r\nconstant in its intensity. Apart from the temporary indifference\r\nresulting from sexual gratification, and apart from the decline in the\r\nimpulse that occurs after prolonged continence, ensuing after a certain\r\nreactionary intensity of desire has been happily overcome, the mode of\r\nlife has a very great influence. The town-dweller, who is continually\r\nreminded of sexual matters, and continually solicited to sexual\r\nintercourse, is in any case more subject than the countryman to sexual\r\nexcitement. A sedentary and sheltered mode of life, a chiefly animal\r\ndiet, the free use of alcohol and of spices, and the like, have a\r\nstimulating action on the sexual life. In the female, the sexual impulse\r\nis stronger just after menstruation. In neuropathic women this increase\r\nof excitement may occur to a pathological degree. Not infrequently also\r\nin the climacteric period, women are subject to sexual excitement due to\r\npruritus, especially in those neuropathically predisposed. _Magnan_\r\nreports the case of a lady who was subject to matutinal accesses of\r\nintense erethismus genitalis. The same author writes of a young lady who\r\nsince puberty had been subject to continually increasing sexual impulse,\r\nwhich she gratified by masturbation. Gradually it came to pass that the\r\nsight of a good-looking man produced violent sexual excitement, and on\r\nthese occasions, since she felt herself unable to answer for her own\r\nconduct, she used to lock herself up in her bedroom till the storm had\r\npassed away. Ultimately she surrendered herself to any available man in\r\norder to obtain rest from her torturing desires, but neither intercourse\r\nnor onanism gave her relief, so that she was finally sent to an asylum.\r\n\r\nAs regards pathological increase of the sexual impulse, hyperæsthesia\r\nsexualis, the constitution of the individual is, according to _von\r\nKrafft-Ebing_ (Psychopathia Sexualis), of great importance. He writes:\r\n“With a neuropathic constitution, a pathological increase of sexual\r\ndesire is often associated, and such individuals bear for the greater\r\npart of their life the heavy burden of this constitutionally anomalous\r\nsexual impulse. The intensity of the sexual impulse may be such as to\r\namount to an organic compulsion, and the freedom of the will may thus be\r\nseriously imperilled. Non-satisfaction of this desire may induce a true\r\nsexual heat (like that of lower animals), or a mental state\r\ncharacterized by sensations of anxiety, in which the individual yields\r\nto the impulse, and his responsibility for his action is most\r\nquestionable. Should the person so affected not give way to his desire,\r\nhe runs the danger, by this enforced abstinence, of injuring his nervous\r\nsystem by the induction of neurasthenia, or of seriously aggravating\r\nneurasthenia that already exists.\r\n\r\n“Excessive sexual desire may arise either from peripheral or from\r\ncentral causes. The former variety is less common. Such cases as do\r\noccur, may arise from pruritus of the genitals, from eczema, or from\r\nsubstances which by their remote local action stimulate sexual desire,\r\nsuch for instance as cantharides.\r\n\r\n“Sexual excitement of central origin is common in those suffering from\r\ncongenital neuropathic predisposition, in hysterical subjects, and in\r\nstates of mental exaltation. In such cases, when the cerebral cortex,\r\nincluding the psychosexual centre, is in a state of hyperæsthesia\r\n(abnormal excitability of the imagination, facilitated association of\r\nideas), not only optical and tactile sensations, but also auditory and\r\nolfactory impressions, will arouse lascivious perceptions.\r\n\r\n“Sexual hyperæsthesia may be continuous, with exacerbations, or\r\nintermittent, and even periodic. In the last case, according to _von\r\nKrafft-Ebing_, it is either an independent cerebral neurosis, or else a\r\npartial manifestation of a general condition of mental excitement\r\n(mania, dementia paralytica, dementia senilis, etc.).”\r\n\r\nErotogenic zones, the stimulation of which leads to an increase in the\r\nintensity of the sexual impulse and of sexual sensibility, are in woman\r\nfirst of all and principally the clitoris, which indeed is said to be\r\nthe only zone of this nature in the virgin state (an opinion held by\r\n_von Krafft-Ebing_ and others, but certainly most improbable); next to\r\nthis comes the whole of the external genitals, and especially the parts\r\ncovered with hair; also the vagina by friction and inter coitum; finally\r\nthe nipple and its areola when stimulated by titillation—an increase of\r\nthe excitability of this region appears to result from suckling.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Hensen_, the direct stimulation of the sexual impulse\r\nproceeds by way of the dorsal nerve of the (penis or) clitoris; he\r\nassumes, however, that certain states of the reproductive glands are\r\nable to induce an increase in the irritability of the centres connected\r\nwith the aforesaid nerves. In women it certainly appears that particular\r\nstates of the ovary have a stimulating or inhibiting influence\r\nrespectively on sexual excitement, so that we might ascribe to the\r\novaries the rôle of a regulator of the sexual impulse. The processes\r\nthat occur in the ovary at the time of the ripening and rupture of the\r\ngraafian follicle, and the resulting tension of the follicular wall,\r\ninduce by stimulation of the ovarian nerves an increased sensibility of\r\nthe central zones, and produce in a menstruating female a condition of\r\nincreased sexual excitability, so that slight stimuli will give rise to\r\na powerful orgasm more readily than would otherwise be the case, when\r\nthe reflex irritability of the centre is less pronounced and the sexual\r\nimpulse is consequently less intense. Still more than during these\r\nordinary menstrual processes may this stimulation be effective at the\r\ntime of the menarche, when the changes in the ovary occur for the first\r\ntime and with the greatest intensity, so that at this time the\r\nindividual may be especially susceptible to sexual stimulation.\r\n\r\nAt such times of sexual excitement, very slight external peripheral\r\nstimuli, in the form either of tactile stimulation of the sensory nerves\r\nof the skin and the external genital organs, or of stimulation of the\r\nimaginative and perceptive faculties of the brain, suffice to induce a\r\npowerful increase of the sexual impulse; whereas at other times, at\r\nwhich no particular sexual excitement exists, much stronger stimuli are\r\nneeded to produce such an effect. Thus the sexual impulse in women is\r\nmore readily and more powerfully increased in proportion as the central\r\norgan is in a condition of temporarily enhanced excitability in\r\nconsequence of the condition of the ovaries.\r\n\r\nThe gratification of this impulse, the act of copulation, produces the\r\nspecific sensation of sexual pleasure; in the female this is effected\r\nchiefly by friction of the glans clitoridis, the organ when erect\r\nprojecting downwards at a right angle, and pressing upon the intromitted\r\npenis—the friction of the glans produces powerful mechanical stimulation\r\nof the numerous plexuses of sensory nerve fibres, which terminate in the\r\ngenital corpuscles of _Krause_. In woman, then, we find in the ovary the\r\nplace of origin and the means of regulation of the sexual impulse, and\r\nin the clitoris we find the seat of the specific sensation of sexual\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nIn the poorer classes of society, an increase of the sexual impulse\r\noccurs in women chiefly in consequence of bad example and of unfavorable\r\ndomestic conditions, such as lead to persons of opposite sexes sleeping\r\nin the same bed, and also in consequence of the abuse of alcohol. In the\r\nwell-to-do classes, it is the perusal of modern equivocal romances,\r\nvisits to theatres, balls, and evening parties, and, speaking generally,\r\nidleness combined with luxurious living, that serve to stimulate the\r\nsexual impulse in woman.\r\n\r\nA certain dependence of the sexual impulse upon seasonal variations\r\nappears to exist also in the human species. At any rate in certain\r\nmonths of the year, a definite increase in the number of conceptions\r\ncontinues to recur, which indicates that during these months a larger\r\nnumber of sexually mature individuals is engaged in the discharge of\r\nsexual functions. _Rosenstadt_ regards this as the manifestation of a\r\n“physiological custom,” immanent in the physical constitution of\r\ncivilized man, and inherited by him from his animal ancestors. He\r\nexplains it in the following terms: “Primitive man inherited from his\r\nmammalian forefathers the peculiarity of reproducing his kind only\r\nduring a certain definite period, the period of heat or rut. After\r\nhumanity had entered upon this period, copulation was effected _en\r\nmasse_, as was easy in view of the primitive community of sexual\r\nintercourse before the origin of marriage. In the course of his progress\r\ntoward civilization, however, man began to reproduce his kind\r\nindifferently throughout the entire year; but the original\r\n“physiological custom,” in accordance with which reproduction occurred\r\nat definite seasons only, did not disappear, and persists, indeed, to a\r\ncertain extent even to the present day as a survival of earlier\r\nmammalian life, and manifests itself in the annual recurrence in certain\r\nmonths of an increase in the number of conceptions. The analogy in\r\nstructure and function between the genital organs of the human species\r\nand those of other mammals (the female anthropoid apes do not merely\r\nexhibit from time to time a period of heat, but are subject to a more or\r\nless regular menstruation), which for the most part reproduce their kind\r\nonly at certain definite periods, leads to the conclusion that in the\r\nhuman species also the sexual impulse may originally have awakened only\r\nat a particular season of the year, and that the persistence of this\r\nphysiological custom in man, in spite of the fact that sexual\r\nintercourse occurs all through the year, and notwithstanding that the\r\nconditions necessary to awaken the sexual impulse are actually\r\nperennial, must be ascribed to inheritance.”\r\n\r\nThis view, which is maintained also by other gynecologists, finds\r\nsupport in _Kulischer’s_ assumption, based upon ethnological\r\ninvestigations, according to which coupling in primitive man took place\r\nonly at certain seasons, namely, at spring and at harvest-time. In\r\nsupport of this view, which was held also by _von Hellwald_, _Kulischer_\r\nrefers to a number of actual and symbolical practices among different\r\nraces, which make the assumption extremely probable.\r\n\r\nSexual desire in women, the sexual impulse, outlasts the proper sexual\r\nlife, and manifests itself even after the cessation of menstruation,\r\nwhen the possibility of conception has passed away; it appears,\r\ntherefore, to have no necessary connection with the function of\r\novulation.\r\n\r\nThis is indicated by the always respectable number of women who enter\r\nupon marriage even after the climacteric age. Thus the percentage of\r\nbrides who were more than 45 years of age was: In Prussia, 2.58 per\r\ncent.; in England, 1.38 per cent.; in Sweden, 1.53 per cent.; in\r\nIreland, 0.31 per cent. Of quite peculiar interest are the figures\r\nrelating to elderly women who marry men considerably younger than\r\nthemselves. Thus we learn from the tables of _Routh_ that in the space\r\nof 10 years in Ireland:\r\n\r\n Women between the ages of 46 and 55 years married\r\n     Men below the age of 17 in                              1 instance.\r\n     Men between the ages of 17 and 25 in                  35 instances.\r\n     Men between the ages of 26 and 35 in                 145 instances.\r\n     Men between the ages of 36 and 45 in                 227 instances.\r\n\r\n And women of ages greater than 55 years married\r\n     Men below the age of 17 in                              1 instance.\r\n     Men between the ages of 17 and 25 in                   3 instances.\r\n     Men between the ages of 26 and 35 in                  12 instances.\r\n     Men between the ages of 36 and 45 in                  15 instances.\r\n     Men between the ages of 46 and 55 in                  52 instances.\r\n\r\nIn England during the year 1855 the age of the bride exceeded the\r\nclimacteric age in 778 instances. The brides were:\r\n\r\n              From 46 to 50 years of age in 135 instances.\r\n              From 51 to 55 years of age in 219 instances.\r\n              From 56 to 60 years of age in  89 instances.\r\n              From 61 to 65 years of age in  22 instances.\r\n              From 66 to 70 years of age in   7 instances.\r\n              From 71 to 75 years of age in   3 instances.\r\n              From 76 to 80 years of age in   3 instances.\r\n\r\nIn Bohemia in the year 1872 the oldest bride numbered no less than—86\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n_Börner_ reports cases in which the sexual impulse remained in full\r\nactivity after the change of life, and in some cases was greatly\r\nincreased in intensity—these latter individuals being in a condition of\r\nreal torment, which induced them to masturbate to obtain relief.\r\n\r\nThe sexual impulse may be present in cases in which the ovaries are\r\nentirely wanting. Thus, _Hauff_ reports the case of a young girl who had\r\nno ovaries, but was nevertheless excessively addicted to masturbation.\r\n_Gläveke_ speaks of a puella publica in whom the uterus and the ovaries\r\nwere entirely absent, but who asserted that she experienced during\r\ncoitus active sexual sensation. Both _Kussmaul_ and _Puech_ report\r\nsimilar experiences in cases of absence or arrested development of the\r\nuterus.\r\n\r\nAs regards the effect on the sexual impulse of the operation of\r\noöphorectomy, most authors state that no change occurs; still, there\r\nremain many who express the opposite opinion. From the collective\r\nsummary of cases bearing on this question made by _Gläveke_, it appears\r\nthat after extirpation of the ovaries the sexual impulse remains\r\nunchanged in the great majority of cases, or at most is but slightly\r\ndiminished in intensity. _Hegar_ states that he has often witnessed a\r\ndiminution of the sexual impulse after oöphorectomy, but that this\r\ndecline is by no means constant, indeed he states that one of his\r\npatients assured him that in her case no decline in the intensity of the\r\nsexual impulse had followed the operation. Similarly variable reports\r\nwere the experience of _Schmalfuss_. In one case he found there was but\r\nlittle sexual inclination; in one case, disinclination; in one case\r\ndisinclination at first, followed by a return of inclination. _Bruntzel_\r\nreports that in four patients subjected to oöphorectomy, in two cases\r\nthe sexual impulse persisted, but in the remaining two it was\r\nextinguished. _Köberle_ is of opinion that sexual inclination diminishes\r\nas a result of this operation. _Peaslee_, on the contrary, asserts that\r\nthe patients remain striking examples of womanhood, in whom all the\r\nqualities peculiar to their sex are preserved. _Péan_ observed as a rule\r\nno difference in the sexual impulse to result from this operation, but\r\nhe considers that the patients are apt to describe in exaggerated terms\r\nthe amount of sexual feeling that remains to them. In one case, _Spencer\r\nWells_ observed after oöphorectomy an increase in sexual excitability;\r\n_Tissier_ had the same experience, and this author believes that in\r\nthese cases the sexual impulse is generally preserved. On the other\r\nhand, _Bailly_ observed a case, in which both ovaries were removed on\r\naccount of new growths, where the sexual impulse at first became\r\nexcessive, and then completely disappeared. _Anger_ and _Goodell_ speak\r\nin the same sense.\r\n\r\nI am myself acquainted with a woman twenty-six years of age who in\r\ngirlhood underwent oöphorectomy on account of extremely severe nervous\r\ntroubles associated with menstruation; she had not experienced in\r\nconsequence any loss of the sexual impulse; she married a man belonging\r\nto the upper strata of society, and consulted me four years later to\r\nlearn if she could by any means be rendered capable of bearing a child.\r\nTwo other cases have come within my personal experience in which young\r\nwomen married after extirpation of the ovaries, and in whom sexual\r\ndesire and sexual sensation were all that could be wished.\r\n\r\nIn twenty-seven women who had undergone the operation of oöphorectomy,\r\n_Gläveke_ made inquiries regarding the three following points: First,\r\nwhether the sexual impulse had been affected by the operation; secondly,\r\nwhether during intercourse sexual pleasure was experienced to the same\r\ndegree as formerly; and thirdly, whether during intercourse any kind of\r\ndifference was observed as compared with pre-operative experience. He\r\nobtained the following results:\r\n\r\n Sexual inclination was\r\n     Unaffected in 6 cases                                  22 per cent.\r\n     Diminished in 10 cases                                 37 per cent.\r\n     Extinguished in 11 cases                               41 per cent.\r\n Sexual pleasure during coitus was\r\n     Unaffected in 8 cases                                  31 per cent.\r\n     Diminished in 10 cases                                 38 per cent.\r\n     Extinguished in 8 cases                                31 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn a considerable number of cases the sexual impulse was thus found by\r\n_Gläveke_, not indeed to be entirely extinguished, but still notably\r\ndiminished. In another set of cases, the sexual impulse was entirely\r\nextinguished, but only in one case was there actual aversion to coitus.\r\nThe women readily permitted intercourse when their husbands desired it,\r\nbut remained themselves quite indifferent. The greater number of these\r\nwomen stated that the specific sensation of pleasure during coitus was\r\nmarkedly weakened, but not entirely lost; in a small proportion, this\r\nsensation was completely extinguished. In the case of seven women who\r\ncomplained that coitus was very painful, _Gläveke_ found that the\r\ncalibre of the vagina was much diminished. In these cases, the sensation\r\nof pleasure during coitus was either greatly diminished or completely\r\nextinguished. The women permitted intercourse very unwillingly, their\r\nunwillingness arising, not from any actual aversion, but because they\r\ndreaded the pain which coitus produced. An extremely hysterical woman,\r\naffected with severe prolapse of the uterus, stated that every attempt\r\nat intercourse was frustrated by violent hysterical convulsions. The\r\nsexual impulse appears always to suffer first and most severely, and\r\nonly after this is the sensation of pleasure during coitus affected. In\r\na few women only, according to the experience of this author, was the\r\nsexual impulse quite unaffected by the removal of the ovaries.\r\n\r\nAmputation of the clitoris appears notably to diminish both the sexual\r\nimpulse and the sensation of sexual pleasure, but the results of\r\nclitoridectomy for the cure of masturbation are by no means always\r\nfavorable. In the women of the Russian sect of the _Skopstki_, the\r\nclitoris, the nymphæ, and a part of the labia majora are removed, in\r\norder to destroy sexual desire. According to _von Krafft-Ebing_ it is\r\nprobable that in the virgin the clitoris is the only erotogenic zone,\r\nthat is to say, that only by the stimulation of the clitoris can\r\nerection, the orgasm, and the sensation of ejaculation be induced. It is\r\nprobable that the vagina becomes erotogenic only as a result of coitus;\r\nthenceforward, however, the erotogenic significance of the clitoris is\r\nnotably lessened, and in multiparæ may entirely disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n           NYMPHOMANIA, ANÆSTHESIA AND PSYCHOPATHIA SEXUALIS.\r\n\r\nThe sexual impulse in women is subject to morbid changes, both in the\r\nway of increase and of diminution, exhibiting abnormal violent increase\r\n(nymphomania), or declining to the state of complete frigidity and\r\nsexual indifference, or, finally, manifesting itself in some perverse\r\nmanner (psychopathia sexualis).\r\n\r\nPsychopathically increased sexual impulse in woman is known as\r\nnymphomania or uteromania. In such women there is a dominant state of\r\npsychical hyperæthesia, principally in the genital sphere. The most\r\nindifferent perceptions give rise to erotic sensations and to lascivious\r\nimpulses. All sensory perceptions obtain a sexual content, and induce\r\nstimulation of the cerebral cortex. All sensation and all activity in\r\nsuch unhappy beings ultimately concentrates itself in the act of\r\ncopulation, or in some other form of sexual gratification, the greatest\r\nperversities of sexual practice frequently arising, masturbation,\r\ntribadism, and, for the most part, prostitution, even in the case of\r\nmarried women.\r\n\r\nThe nymphomaniacal woman, says _von Krafft-Ebing_, endeavors to allure\r\nmen by means of exposure of the genital organs or indecent gestures; the\r\nsight of man produces intense sexual excitement, which is gratified by\r\nmasturbation or by stimulatory movements of the pelvis. According to\r\nthis author, nymphomania is not very infrequent at the climacteric\r\nperiod; it may even occur in old age. Abstinence in association with\r\nsimultaneous excitement of the sexual sphere by mental or by peripheral\r\nstimuli (pruritus pudendi, oxyuris, etc.), may induce these states,\r\nprobably, however, only in those hereditarily predisposed.\r\n\r\nThe history of antiquity contains records of the corrupt practices of\r\nnymphomaniacal empresses. Thus, Messalina furnishes a well-known\r\nhistorical example of the abnormal violence of a pathologically\r\nintensified sexual impulse in woman. She was given the agnomen of\r\n_invicta_, having received the embraces of fourteen athletes. _Pliny_\r\nsays of her, _die ac nocte superavit quinto et vicessimo concubitu_; and\r\n_Juvenal_ writes of her the verses,\r\n\r\n              ... tamen ultima cellam\r\n              Clausit, adhuc ardens rigidæ tintigine vulvæ\r\n              Et resupina jacens multorum absorbuit ictus\r\n              Et lassata viris, necdum satiata, recessit.\r\n\r\nIn corrupt Rome, Messalina was not the only woman _necdum satiata_, ever\r\ninsatiable; we need only refer to the orgies of an Aggripina, a Livia, a\r\nMallonia, or a Poppæa; and _Seneca_ hurls against the women of his day\r\nthe reproach, _adeo perversum commentæ genus impudicitiæ viros ineunt_.\r\nAnd of Cleopatra, the beautiful Egyptian queen, Marcus Antonius writes\r\nin a letter to his physician, Soranus, that she had such violent sexual\r\ndesire as to lead to her having connection in a brothel with 106 men.\r\n\r\nThrough the report of _Herodotus_ it is well known that the pyramid of\r\nCheops was built by the numerous lovers of the daughter of this king,\r\nwho raised this enormous monument in recognition of the innumerable\r\ntimes she had yielded herself to their desires. On record also are the\r\nsexual excesses of the Roman ladies at the festival of Saturn, the\r\nfestival of the Bona Dea, and the festival of Priapus; indeed, many of\r\nthese women allowed themselves to be debauched in the temples (_Ploss_\r\nand _Bartels_).\r\n\r\nBut returning to the present day, both gynecologists and alienists\r\nrecord numerous cases of great pathological increase in the intensity of\r\nthe sexual impulse in women. According to _Lombroso_, such continued\r\nardency of sexual desire occurs chiefly in women with an inherited\r\ntendency to crime and to prostitution, whose natures exhibit a\r\ncommingling of lasciviousness with barbarism. He gives examples of such\r\nwomen, one of whom surrendered herself to her husband’s laborers;\r\nanother had as her lovers all the desperadoes of Texas; a third had\r\nintercourse with all the herdsmen of her village; a fourth, though her\r\nhusband occupied a good social position, led the life of a prostitute; a\r\nfifth, a cultured and intelligent woman, entertained a common\r\nbricklayer, and wrote to him letters full of shameless declarations of\r\nher sexual passion; further he writes of a series of criminals, in whom,\r\nindeed, increased sexual desire is a common phenomenon; one of these, a\r\nthief, experienced sexual excitement at a mere glance at a good-looking\r\nman; a murderess, in whom lascivious feeling induced masturbation\r\nwhenever she saw a man, and who made experiments in sexual intercourse\r\nwith dogs; another, who often took to bed with her, in addition to her\r\nson, three or four men selected at random from the streets; and many\r\nothers. _Jolly_ reports the case of a widow, a celebrated _lionne_ of\r\nthe _demi-monde_, who kept in her desk, side by side with devotional\r\nliterature, a number of lascivious books and preparations of\r\ncantharides, and entertained quite a number of powerfully-built lovers\r\ndrawn from the lowest _canaille_.\r\n\r\nIn hysterical women the sexual impulse is frequently excessive, and may\r\nincrease to such a degree as to produce hallucinations of coitus;\r\nsometimes, on the other hand, the impulse is extinguished, or\r\npsychopathically metamorphosed, passing in a most paradoxical manner\r\nfrom sexual frigidity to lascivious reflections and continuous\r\noccupation with sexual affairs; not uncommon in such women are false\r\naccusations of indecent assaults of which they assert themselves the\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\n_Lombroso_ gives several examples of the increase of the sexual impulse\r\nin hysterical women: “A hysterical girl visited a physician, and said to\r\nhim: ‘I am still a virgin, take me;’ she submitted him to the utmost\r\nextremity of provocation, and asserted afterward that she had been\r\nviolated. Another hysterical subject, a rich young lady, met a workman\r\nin the street, offered herself to him, was accepted, and when she\r\nreturned home related the affair with laughter. A third sought men from\r\nthe street in order to find one suffering from syphilis, her object\r\nbeing to infect her own husband with the disease.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations of _Schüle_, young married, hysterical\r\nwomen not infrequently run away with a waiter during the honeymoon\r\njourney. This author also points out that in women moral insanity is\r\nespecially apt to manifest itself during the first years of married\r\nlife. Many advocate a far-reaching libertinism, and threaten to enter a\r\nbrothel. In these forms we observe, in addition to ill-temper and\r\nmalignity, especially obscenity and tribadism.\r\n\r\nSuch a case, observed by _Giraud_ and quoted by _von Krafft-Ebing_, is\r\nthe following: Marianne L., of Bordeaux, during the night, while her\r\nmaster was sleeping soundly under the influence of narcotics she had\r\nadministered, was in the habit of giving up her master’s children to her\r\nlover for his sexual gratification, and made them witnesses of the most\r\nimmoral scenes. It appeared that L. was hysterical, suffering from\r\nhemianæsthesia and convulsive seizures, and that before her illness she\r\nhad been a sensible and trustworthy individual. After the illness,\r\nhowever, she prostituted herself in the most shameless manner and\r\ncompletely lost her moral sense.\r\n\r\n_Galen_ relates of his own mother that she suffered from nymphomania,\r\nand that in the attacks she bit her female slaves like a wild animal.\r\n\r\nAs a negative aspect of the sexual impulse in woman we must regard the\r\nabsence of the impulse, or anæsthesia sexualis, and also the deficiency\r\nof the sensation of pleasure during the act of copulation, or\r\ndyspareunia.\r\n\r\nOf dyspareunia we shall speak more at length later, in connection with\r\nthe pathology of copulation. As regards the entire lack of the sexual\r\nimpulse, however, in women whose genital organs are normally developed\r\nand normal in the performance of their functions, and whose cerebral\r\ncondition is also normal, we must consider such lack an extremely rare\r\ncondition, if indeed it ever occurs. It is only in cases in which the\r\nfemale genital organs are wanting, wholly or to a considerable extent,\r\nor in which there are important cerebral disturbances or states of\r\nmental degeneration, that the sexual impulse is wanting.\r\n\r\nNormally, in the young, sexually unspoiled girl, the sexual instinct[34]\r\nslumbers in the cerebral cortex, but becomes active, as sensation,\r\nperception, and impulse, as soon as the cerebral centre has been aroused\r\nby mental impressions or by physical peripheral stimulation of the\r\ngenital organs and their environment. Among stimuli of the latter class\r\nmust be reckoned the menstrual stimulus, set on foot by the\r\ndevelopmental processes of puberty. These stimuli arouse in the cerebral\r\ncortex sensations and perceptions which, rising to specific sexual\r\nfeelings, produce an impulse to increase the intensity of these feelings\r\nby purposive action; thus is awakened the sexual impulse, the strength\r\nof which is extremely variable.\r\n\r\nOnly when the cerebral cortex, as the place of origin of sensations and\r\nperceptions, fails to perform its functions in the manner just\r\ndescribed, or when the anatomico-physiological processes in the genital\r\norgans which normally act as peripheral stimuli fail to occur, or when\r\nthere is a failure in the conducting tracts, are sexual perceptions and\r\nimpulses lacking. Such anomalies may be congenital. A milder form is\r\nthat, likewise congenital, in which a woman has a sexually “cold\r\nnature;” in these cases the sexual impulse is not completely wanting,\r\nbut it is so slight in intensity that it can be awakened only by very\r\npowerful stimuli, and in her normal state the woman so affected is quite\r\nfree from any wish for sexual gratification.\r\n\r\nSuch congenital subnormal intensity or entire lack of the sexual impulse\r\nmay be due to very various causes. According to _von Krafft-Ebing_,\r\nthese causes may be organic or functional, mental or physical, and\r\ncentral or peripheral. The declining intensity of the sexual impulse\r\nwith the advance of years, and the temporary disappearance of that\r\nimpulse after the sexual act, are both physiological occurrences.\r\nEducation and mode of life have a marked influence on the intensity of\r\nthe vita sexualis. Strenuous mental activity, earnest study, severe\r\nphysical exertion, mental depression, and sexual continence, notably\r\ndiminish the excitability of the sexual impulse. At first, indeed,\r\nabstinence leads to an increase in the intensity of the impulse, but\r\nsooner or later the functional activity of the organs of generation\r\ndeclines, and therewith also the intensity of the sexual impulse. As\r\nperipheral causes of diminution or disappearance of the sexual impulse,\r\n_von Krafft-Ebing_ mentions oöphorectomy, degeneration of the\r\nreproductive glands, marasmus, sexual excess, whether in the form of\r\ncoitus or of masturbation, and alcoholism. In like manner is to be\r\ninterpreted the disappearance of the sexual impulse in general disorders\r\nof nutrition (diabetes, morphinism, etc.).\r\n\r\nA decline in the intensity of the sexual impulse in consequence of\r\ndegeneration of the conducting tracts, is found, according to _von\r\nKrafft-Ebing_, in diseases of the brain and the spinal cord. Central\r\naffection of the sexual impulse may be due to organic disease of the\r\ncerebral cortex (dementia paralytica, general paralysis of the insane,\r\nin the later stages), or it may be due to functional disorder, such as\r\nhysteria, or to mental diseases (melancholia or hypochondriasis).\r\n\r\nFinally, in some instances, the sexual impulse in women manifests\r\nitself, not in the normal manner with copulation with the male as its\r\ngoal, but in a form demanding some abnormal kind of gratification\r\n(psychopathia sexualis), whether it be because sexual intercourse with\r\nthe male affords the woman no enjoyment, or simply because no\r\nopportunity exists for such intercourse.\r\n\r\nMasturbation is very frequent; the habit having been acquired from bad\r\nexample by the girl during the menarche, it is sometimes continued by\r\nthe wife during married life. In these cases we often find distinct\r\nchanges in the genital organs, such as hypertrophy of the clitoris,\r\nenlargement and bluish discoloration of the nymphæ, retroversion of the\r\nuterus, tenderness and displacement of the ovaries, considerable vaginal\r\ndischarge, and sometimes menorrhagia.\r\n\r\n_Kussmaul_ draws attention to the connection between masturbation and\r\nnymphomania, on the one hand, and imperfect development of the uterus\r\nand the other genital organs, on the other. _Campbell_ records the case\r\nof a woman addicted to masturbation, who had never menstruated, and who,\r\nin addition to imperfectly developed genital organs, had a dermoid cyst\r\nof the ovary. In a young woman who indulged in masturbation, _Aran_\r\nfound that the uterus and its annexa were imperfectly developed.\r\n_Vaddington_ also describes a case of abnormal sexual impulse which was\r\nassociated with absence of the uterus.\r\n\r\n_Troggler_ reports the case of a woman twenty years of age, who had been\r\nsix months married to a healthy, potent man, was herself healthy and\r\nblooming, with a good family history, and had never suffered from any\r\nsevere illness. At the age of thirteen she had learned to masturbate,\r\neffecting this by stimulation of the clitoris. Now she found no\r\ngratification in coitus, so that she continued to masturbate, and during\r\ncoitus obtained satisfaction by manual friction of the clitoris.\r\nExamination showed that the clitoris was strikingly large, the vagina\r\nflaccid, and that there was some vaginal discharge; in other respects\r\nthe genital organs were normal.\r\n\r\nNot infrequent, it may be in those whose mental condition is in other\r\nrespects fairly normal or it may be in psychopathic subjects, is the\r\nexistence of contrary sexual sensation, or sexual inversion, a condition\r\nwhich has been described by _Casper_, _Westphal_, _von Krafft-Ebing_,\r\nand _Moll_, and has indeed been well known since the days of antiquity.\r\nIn the case of a considerable number of notable women, homosexual\r\npractices have been recorded. According to the observations of\r\n_Coffignon_, in Paris the homosexual instinct, when occurring in other\r\nwomen than prostitutes, is found chiefly among the ladies of the\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nOf homosexually inclined women, some engage in the practice of\r\ntribadism, familiar to the ancient world, and recorded by _Martial_ in a\r\nsatire, in which sexual gratification is obtained by mutual friction of\r\nthe genital organs, or by penetration of one woman’s clitoris into the\r\nvagina of the other; whilst some indulge in the _amor lesbicus_, in\r\nwhich gratification is obtained _lambendo linguâ genitalia_, a very\r\nancient practice indeed, transported from Phœnicia to Greece (where in\r\nespecial it was indulged in by the women of Lesbos), and later from\r\nSyria to Italy, where it was widely diffused among the Romans of the\r\nimperial age. _Sappho_, celebrated as the tenth muse, is supposed to\r\nhave been addicted to the practice of Lesbian love.\r\n\r\nAll such homosexual (female) individuals are, then, endowed with the\r\nperverse instinct toward sexual connection with women instead of with\r\nmen. In such cases, the genitals are usually quite normal; sometimes,\r\nhowever, the woman thus affected is markedly of a male type, being\r\ncalled by _von Krafft-Ebing_ a _gynandrist_, the affection itself being\r\ntermed _gynandry_; when the woman concerned not only possesses a\r\nhomosexual impulse, but also in other respects exhibits tendencies\r\nproperly characteristic of the male sex, she is called _virago_, and the\r\naffection is termed _viraginity_.\r\n\r\nI had under my care such a woman, belonging to the upper circles of\r\nsociety, who had been married sixteen years before, had lived a married\r\nlife for six years (during which she remained barren), and had then\r\nseparated from her husband. She was of a very masculine disposition,\r\nsmoked, gamed, drank like a student, and preferred to wear men’s\r\nclothing, and she bestowed her affections on a female companion.\r\nExamination of the genital organs disclosed no abnormality beyond a\r\nslight vaginal catarrh. Menstruation was regular, and the general\r\nappearance showed no departure, with the exception of a slight moustache\r\nthat shaded the upper lip, from that of a normal feminine beauty.\r\n\r\n_Mantegazza_ is of opinion that in the case of many unhappy marriages,\r\nin which the source of the unhappiness is obscure, the trouble is to be\r\nfound in the homosexual inclination of the wife. _Martineau_ and _Moll_\r\nreport that married women who are homosexually inclined, indulge in\r\nsexual intercourse with other women behind their husbands’ back.\r\n_Duhousset_, at a meeting of the Anthropological Society at Paris in\r\n1877, related the almost incredible case of a married homosexual woman\r\nwho, in intercourse with another woman, transferred to the latter her\r\nhusband’s semen, so as to induce pregnancy.\r\n\r\nMany writers on forensic medicine, _Tardieu_, _Pfaff_, _Schauenstein_,\r\n_Wald_, and _Mantegazza_, for instance, have recorded that in numerous\r\ncircles of European society women practice masturbation and tribadism\r\n(sodomy, so called) with dogs and monkeys; and _Plutarch’s_ statement is\r\nwell known regarding Egyptian women and the sacred goat, Mendes, that\r\nthe women who were locked in with this animal practiced sodomy\r\ntherewith; and again it is asserted that the serpents in the temple of\r\nÆsculapius and also in private houses were employed in the practice of\r\nsodomy.\r\n\r\n_Von Maschka_ records a case which came before the courts a few years\r\nago in Prague, in which a woman forty-four years old confessed that “in\r\nconsequence of the very ardent temperament she possessed, she had,\r\nperhaps, as often as six times indulged herself with her house dog,\r\nwhich jumped between her legs and licked her; that she took the animal\r\nbetween her bare legs, stroked its belly until its penis became erect;\r\nthen, supporting herself on the back of a chair, she pressed the animal\r\nagainst herself, introduced its penis between her labia majora, and let\r\nit continue its movements until its semen had been ejaculated.”\r\nExamination of the genital organs of this woman disclosed no\r\nabnormality.\r\n\r\n_Schauenstein_ reports the case of a girl who carried out unchaste\r\npractices with a little dog to an utterly immoderate extent, so that\r\nafter the lapse of some years she died in an asylum. In a case recorded\r\nby _Wald_, a maid servant was observed in lewd practices with a poodle;\r\nshe supported herself on elbows and knees, while the dog copulated with\r\nher from behind.\r\n\r\nA woman about thirty years of age, who had lived with her husband in\r\nsterile marriage for nine years, complained to me that she had not for a\r\nlong time had sexual intercourse, since during copulation she not only\r\nexperienced no sexual pleasure, but actually felt a loathing to the act;\r\non the other hand, she was subject to an uncontrollable impulse to\r\nhandle the genital organs of children, both of the male and of the\r\nfemale sex, and this performance gave her sexual gratification; during\r\nthe menstrual period, this impulse overpowered her will. Local\r\nexamination in this patient showed that the uterus was enlarged and\r\nretroflexed, and that there was anæsthesia of the vagina.\r\n\r\n_Anjel_ reports the following case of periodic psychopathia sexualis,\r\nassociated with menstruation. A lady of quiet disposition, near the\r\nclimacteric. Serious congenital predisposition. During youth suffered\r\nfrom attacks of minor epilepsy. Married, but childless. Several years\r\nago, after violent emotional disturbance, she had a hystero-epileptic\r\nseizure, followed by post-epileptic mania lasting several weeks.\r\nThereafter, insomnia for several months. As a sequel, continually\r\nrecurrent menstrual insomnia, accompanied by an impulse to embrace boys\r\nunder ten years of age, to kiss them, and to handle their genital\r\norgans. Impulse toward coitus, to close sexual contact with a grown man,\r\nnon-existent at this time. The patient often speaks openly of her morbid\r\nimpulse, and begs that she may be supervised, as she feels unable to\r\nanswer for her own conduct. In the intervals, however, she carefully\r\navoids all reference to the matter, is strictly decent in her conduct,\r\nand in no way sexually ardent.\r\n\r\nTribadism is frequently mentioned by the writers of classical antiquity,\r\nespecially by those of Greece, where the cult of naked beauty encouraged\r\nsexual excitement of this character. This form of unchastity was common\r\namong the flute-playing girls of Greece, and at the secret festivals of\r\nsuch associates Aphrodite Peribasia was invoked. _Lucian_, in his\r\ndialogues of hetairai, depicts the intensely passionate nature of these\r\nhomosexual unions between girls. _Lombroso_ reproduces _Juvenal’s_\r\ndescription of such a love-feast. “When the flute calls to the dance,\r\nthe mænads, inflamed with wine and beer, loosen their long tresses, they\r\nsigh languishingly and eagerly, and an ardent desire draws them one to\r\nanother, the desire and the passion of the dance gives their voices an\r\nalluring sound; nothing now can serve to bridle their unrestrained\r\ndesires. _Lacasella_ swings her wreath, which she has won in the contest\r\nof lascivious gestures and movements, but even she must give way before\r\nMedullina with her ardent postures. About these games there is no trace\r\nof unreality, and the most rigid Spartan, hardened from the very cradle,\r\neven old Nestor himself, notwithstanding his hernia, could not fail to\r\nbe stimulated by such an inflammatory spectacle.”\r\n\r\nIn the present day, also, the practice of tribadism is more widely\r\ndiffused than people in general imagine. I have often encountered\r\ninstances of it in ladies of good position, who were past their first\r\nyouth, who would not or could not marry, and who undertook extensive and\r\nlong-enduring journeys with a female “companion,” of similar age, or\r\nperhaps a little younger. Their erotic needs, which could not be\r\ngratified in normal fashion, led to this sexual perversion—a tendency\r\nobservable especially in persons with neuropathic predisposition, or\r\nwith a liability to hysteria or to epilepsy. Sometimes such girls, even\r\nbefore puberty, show an inclination to wear boys’ clothes, to avoid all\r\nfeminine manual occupations, and to examine and to handle the genital\r\norgans of their playmates. Even after puberty, such tribadists like to\r\nmake a parade of masculine attitudes, they have their hair cut short,\r\nwear clothes of a masculine cut, smoke a great deal, and show in their\r\nconversation, and still more in their letters, great exaltation of the\r\npassions. It not infrequently happens that an elderly lady who has lived\r\nwell in her day, and from youth upward has had much intercourse with\r\nmen, comes at last to lament her worthlessness to men, and from this\r\nproceeds to the idea of obtaining sexual enjoyment by means of\r\ntribadism. The tribadistic union sometimes lasts for several years, but\r\nin most cases the alliances are quickly and frequently changed.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Taxil_, tribadism is fairly common among the married women\r\nof Paris, and in upper-class women is extremely prevalent. This author\r\ndescribes with what industry and perseverance many elderly tribadists\r\nendeavor to win for themselves and to seduce young girls, just as old\r\nwomen often work hard to gain money for the enjoyment of the favored\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nIn these unions, according to the descriptions of _Lombroso_, very\r\nremarkable phenomena occur. A particular jargon arises with tender\r\ndesignations for this or that bodily beauty; a violent jealousy\r\ndevelops, and a newly united pair keep together as much as possible for\r\nfear of losing one another’s affection; the “friends” tread always in\r\none another’s footsteps. This author rightly points out that the very\r\nnumerous romances describing relations of this kind prove the diffusion\r\nof this vice in “high life.” Novels of this class are referred to by\r\n_Mantegazza_ in his book, “Woman as Criminal and Prostitute.” He\r\nmentions: _Diderot_, “La Religieuse;” _Balzac_, “La Fille aux Yeux\r\nd’Or;” _Gautier_, “Mademoiselle de Maupin;” _Feydeau_, “Le Comtesse de\r\nCholis;” _Flaubert_, “Salammbô;” _Bélot_, “Mademoiselle Giraud ma\r\nFemme;” _Willbraud_, “Fridolins Heimliche Ehe;” _Graf Stadion_, “Brick\r\nand Brack;” _Sacher-Masoch_, “Venus im Pelz.” _Zola_, also, in “Nana”\r\nand “La Curée,” and _Butti_ in “L’Antona,” make some reference to this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n_Sauval_ relates of the dissolute life at the court of the French king,\r\nFrancis I, that the women learned also to play the part of men; a\r\nprincess had a hermaphrodite maid-of-honor, and the court and all Paris\r\ngossiped about the Lesbian-loving ladies, whose husbands were delighted,\r\nsince they were thus quite freed from jealousy, and prized their wives\r\nabove all on this account. Such a mode of life was so pleasing to many\r\nladies that they refused to marry, and refused also to allow their\r\n“friends” to marry.\r\n\r\nTribadism is very common among prostitutes. According to\r\n_Parent-Duchatelet_, tribadism begins only after prostitution has long\r\nbeen practised, between the twenty-fifth and the thirtieth year of life;\r\ngenerally there is a notable difference in age and also in beauty\r\nbetween the two women forming a tribadistic alliance, and as a rule the\r\nyounger and prettier of the pair is the more passionately sensitive and\r\nthe more constant. _Parent-Duchatelet_ endeavours to explain the origin\r\nof tribadism by referring to the manner in which in brothels and\r\nreformatories the women are closely packed together, to the enforced\r\nabstinence from normal sexual intercourse (in prisons and\r\nreformatories), to the loathing for men sometimes felt by prostitutes,\r\nand to the opportunities for mutual observation of the most intimate\r\nnudities. Even women who at first object to it most vehemently, commonly\r\ngive way to this vice after eighteen or twenty months.\r\n\r\nAmong 103 prostitutes examined by _Lombroso_, he found tribadism to be\r\npracticed by five. He considers the principal cause of tribadism to be\r\nin the lascivious search for new and unnatural pleasures, and quotes in\r\nillustration the characteristic remark of Catharine II, herself a\r\ntribadist, “Why did not nature endow us with a sixth sense?” Female\r\ncriminals who seduce others to the practice of tribadism have usually\r\nthemselves acquired the vice during a long term of imprisonment—it is,\r\nin fact, the long-sentence criminals, women with a congenital\r\ninclination toward crime, that incline also to unnatural vice. The\r\ninfluence of environment is, according to _Lombroso_, indicated by the\r\nfact that the most confirmed criminals, in prisons for women, corrupt in\r\nthis manner so many of the inmates who are merely “criminaloids,” and\r\ncorrupt even the wardresses. Further, he is led to conclude, the\r\nconfinement in close association of so many extremely sensual and\r\nprostituted women, leads to the origin of a kind of ferment of new\r\nlascivious desires, and causes an increase of one form of degeneracy by\r\nmeans of another. Prostitutes often see one another naked, sleep two or\r\nthree together in the same bed; similar things occur in\r\nboarding-schools. In asylums also we may observe that the admission of a\r\ntribadist will result in the infection of all the inmates with this\r\nvice.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Moll’s_ estimate, 25 per cent. of the prostitutes of\r\nBerlin practice tribadism. According to the experience of this author,\r\nin cases in which tribadists live in concubinage, one of them is always\r\na prostitute; the active and the passive rôle are always played by the\r\nsame respective members of the alliance; the active member is called\r\n“papa” or “uncle,” is usually a prostitute, and, like the man in the\r\nmarried state, possesses great comparative freedom in sexual matters,\r\nwhilst the passive member, the “mother,” is not allowed to form any\r\nsexual relations outside the concubinage.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Ricardi_, many frigid prostitutes practice with pleasure\r\nclitoris-masturbation, cunnilictio, and, especially, sapphism,\r\npreferring these perversions to the normal sexual act. Moreover, among\r\nprostitutes and female criminals there is no lack of lovers of\r\nmartyrization, of flagellation, even to the drawing of blood, of\r\ntyrannical treatment, and of the initiation of children into the\r\nmysteries of sex.\r\n\r\n[For a detailed account of Sadism and Masochism, see _von\r\nKrafft-Ebing’s_ “Psychopathia Sexualis.” These particular perversions,\r\ncommon in men, are rare in women; hence but passing allusion is made to\r\nthem in the present work.]\r\n\r\n_Lombroso_ records on account of its rarity a case of masochism observed\r\nby him in a woman thirty-five years of age, who liked being whipped.\r\n\r\n_Moraglia_ reports a remarkable instance of sexual perversion in a girl\r\nof eighteen, who preferred to coitus, masturbation associated with the\r\nstimulating influence of the odor of male urine; this peculiar form of\r\nirritability was so powerful as to drive the girl to masturbation in\r\npublic urinals, notwithstanding the risk of arrest, which indeed often\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Carlier_, there are four or five brothels in Paris which\r\nare not infrequently visited by rich ladies in search of tribadistic\r\nenjoyments, and ladies of “high life” assemble there for communal\r\norgies; it is noteworthy that prostitutes surrender themselves for such\r\npurposes to these women who are outside their own circle with great\r\nreluctance, and only for a very high fee.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, however, sexual perversion is rarer and less intense\r\nin women than in men. This fact is explained by _Lombroso_ on the ground\r\nthat the erotic element in women’s nature is less active, and that women\r\nare less often affected by epilepsy, the principal source of these\r\nanomalies. In cases in which the genital organs are healthy we must,\r\nwith _Westphal_, conclude, with reference to contrary sexual sensation,\r\nthat the abnormal sexual feelings have a cortical origin.\r\n\r\nFrom _von Maschka’s_ elaborate account of unnatural offences, in his\r\n_Handbook of Forensic Medicine_, we abstract the following passage\r\nrelating to the female sex: “Lascivious procedures liable under certain\r\ncircumstances to legal punishment may consist: 1. In handling or other\r\nmanipulation of the genitals, without actual intercourse. If the genital\r\norgans of a female have merely been gently handled, without any more\r\nviolent manipulations, we shall not, as a rule, either in the case of\r\nchildren or of adults, find any local changes as a result; contrariwise,\r\nif the handling has been rough and brutal, if the fingers have been\r\nforcibly thrust within the vulval cleft, or if the pudendum has been\r\npulled and rent, we may expect to find excoriations, redness, swelling,\r\nlaceration of the hymen, or even of the vagina and the perineum. 2. In\r\nlicking the female genitals (cunnilingere). An analogous process also\r\neffected by members of the female sex, whether children or adults, is\r\n_irrumare, id est, penem in os arrigere; fellare, id est, vel labiis vel\r\nlingua perfricandi atque exsugendi officium penis præstare_. 3. In\r\nintroduction of the membrum virile into the rectum, either of children\r\nor of adults, pæderasty.” That this form of sexual gratification is not\r\ninfrequently practiced upon women has been pointed out especially by\r\n_Parent-Duchatelet_, and is asserted by _von Maschka_ from personal\r\nknowledge of cases in which it has occurred.\r\n\r\nTribadism and Lesbian love, unnatural vice practiced by two individuals\r\nof the female sex, occur, according to _von Maschka’s_ description in\r\nthe following manner: _a._) By masturbation, either one person\r\ngratifying the other by manipulation, or mutual masturbation. In a case\r\nof this kind recorded by _Tardieu_, a wife still young repeatedly, and\r\nby day as well as by night, introduced her finger deeply into the vagina\r\nor the rectum of her little girl, moving it about there sometimes for as\r\nlong as an hour. According to the child’s account, the mother herself at\r\nthese times was in a condition of excitement, no doubt sexual, which she\r\ngratified in this manner. In another case, several older girls engaged\r\nwith their own fingers and tongues in lascivious practices with the\r\ngenital organs of a little girl of seven. According to _Krausold_, among\r\nfemale prisoners such “forbidden friendships” are extremely common,\r\nformed for the purpose of mutual masturbation, and in connection with\r\nwhich the bitterest jealousy and the most ardent love are exhibited.\r\n_b._) With the assistance of an enlarged clitoris, with which one woman\r\nperforms the sexual act by introducing the organ within the vagina of\r\nanother. In France in the nineteenth century a woman is said to have\r\nlived whose genital organs were so formed that, on the one hand, as a\r\nwoman she played the passive part in intercourse with men, and, on the\r\nother hand, was able to give sexual gratification to women by assuming\r\nthe active part of the male. _c._) By the employment of an artificial\r\n_membrum virile_. This mode of obtaining satisfaction of sexual desire\r\nwas known already to the ancients, and such a priapus was by the Greeks\r\ntermed ὸλισθος. The fact that such articles are manufactured and sold,\r\naffords sufficient proof that their use is not unknown in our own day.\r\n_Von Maschka_ describes such priapi as being made of india rubber, of\r\nthe size and shape of an erect penis, perforated longitudinally and\r\nfitted at the lower end with a testicle-like attachment, to be filled\r\nwith warm water or milk, so that by squeezing it an ejaculation can be\r\ncounterfeited. This priapus is also so constructed that it can be\r\nattached to the body by means of a girdle and can thus be employed for\r\nthe gratification of another individual.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to sodomy, unnatural intercourse with the lower\r\nanimals. _Von Maschka_ gives several instances of this, which we have\r\npreviously mentioned, and states also that some years before, during his\r\nstay in Paris, a female was accustomed to hold a secret exhibition, the\r\nentry to which cost ten francs, and at which she had sexual intercourse\r\nwith a bulldog trained for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Lombroso_, even at the present day, the inmates of\r\nlicensed brothels frequently hold exhibitions, for admission to which a\r\nfee is charged, of tribadistic couples in _poses plastiques_, and of\r\nanother prostitute in _coitus caninus_.\r\n\r\nIn his widely-celebrated work on _Psychopathia Sexualis, von\r\nKrafft-Ebing_ discusses these morbid sexual processes in women. We\r\nselect certain data from his exposition. Regarding the congenital morbid\r\nphenomenon of the lack of sexual feeling in women, as contrasted with\r\nperversion of sexual feeling, and the sexual impulse toward an\r\nindividual of the same sex (antipathic sexual feeling), _von\r\nKrafft-Ebing_ writes: “The woman-loving woman feels herself sexually to\r\nbe a man, she rejoices in the exhibition of courage, of masculine\r\nsentiments, since these characteristics make the man desirable to the\r\nwoman. The female _urning_,[35] therefore, likes to have her hair cut\r\nshort and her clothes of a masculine cut; and one of her greatest\r\npleasures is when opportunity offers to appear in male attire. Her\r\nideals are notable feminine personalities, distinguished by spirituality\r\nand energy; in the theatre and in the circus, it is only the female\r\nperformers that attract her interest; and in the same way, in\r\ncollections of pictures and statues, it is only the representations of\r\nwomen that awaken her æsthetic sense and her sensibility.” _Von\r\nKrafft-Ebing_ insists that in nearly all cases of antipathic sexual\r\nfeeling in which a family history was attainable, that history was found\r\nto exhibit instances of neuroses, psychoses, stigmata of degeneration,\r\netc. In hysteria, according to this author, the sexual life is\r\nespecially often abnormal; in cases with neuropathic inheritance, one\r\nmay say always: “All possible anomalies of the sexual functions occur in\r\nsuch cases, with the utmost variety and the strangest commingling, based\r\nupon hereditary degenerative processes, and accompanied by moral\r\nimbecility in its most perverse manifestations. * * *. Frequently, in\r\nhysterical subjects, the sexual life is morbidly excitable. This\r\nexcitement may be intermittent (? menstrual). Shameless prostitution may\r\nresult, even in married women. In cases of a milder type, the sexual\r\nimpulse is exhibited in the form of onanism, nude perambulations about\r\nthe room, wearing of male attire, etc. In cases of hysterical mental\r\ndisorder, the morbidly excited sexual life may manifest itself in the\r\nform of maniacal jealousy, baseless complaints against men of indecent\r\nassault, hallucinations of coitus, etc. Sometimes there may be\r\nfrigidity, with lack of sexual pleasure, commonly due to genital\r\nanæsthesia.”\r\n\r\nIncest in women, dependent upon psychopathic causes, is also alluded to\r\nby _von Krafft-Ebing_; it occurs in those in whom a partial imbecility\r\nthat leaves the sense of modesty undeveloped is combined with eroticism.\r\nThus, a case reported by _Schürmayer_ is mentioned, in which a mother\r\nhad, or attempted, intercourse with her son, aged five and one-half\r\nyears; and again a case reported by _Lafarque_, in which a girl of\r\nseventeen laid her thirteen-year-old brother on herself for the\r\ngratification _conjunctionis membrorum_, while simultaneously\r\nmasturbating her brother; _Magnan’s_ case, an unmarried woman\r\ntwenty-nine years of age, who could hardly resist the impulse toward\r\ncopulation with her nephews as long as they were quite young;\r\n_Legrand’s_ cases, in one of which a girl fifteen years of age seduced\r\nher brother to the performance of all possible sexual excesses on her\r\nbody; another, a married woman aged thirty-five, who committed incest\r\nwith her eighteen-year-old brother; and a third, a mother aged\r\nthirty-nine, who committed incest with her son.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Moll_, women who suffer from antipathic sexual sensation\r\nare, in many cases, married; it appears, however, that for the most part\r\nthey have no inclination to marry. In isolated cases there may exist a\r\npsychical hermaphroditism, the woman thus affected having sexual\r\ninclination both towards men and towards women. In the case of\r\nhomosexual women, normal intercourse appears not to furnish complete\r\nsatisfaction. As regards fetichistic, masochistic, and sadistic\r\ninclinations on the part of women with antipathic sexual sensation,\r\n_Moll_ was unable to obtain any trustworthy information. Sometimes in\r\nwomen the perverse sexual impulse appears periodically, being then often\r\nassociated with the appearance of other psychical abnormalities. In some\r\nwomen the perverse impulse is especially active at the menstrual\r\nperiods; whilst at other times these subjects, even though not quite\r\nsexually normal, are still very much quieter. Antipathic sexual\r\nsensation in women may depend upon inherited predisposition, and may\r\noften be traced back to a very early age. In many cases an exciting\r\ncause may be demonstrated.\r\n\r\n_Mantegazza_, who relates that homosexual practices are common among the\r\ninmates of harems, believes that antipathic sexual feeling is readily\r\ncurable in women soon after marriage, but that later a cure is rare.\r\n\r\nA perverse form of sexual gratification sometimes met with in women is\r\nflagellation. By chastisement with birches, straps, or whips on the bare\r\nbuttocks, the nerves of the sexual apparatus are stimulated, and these\r\norgans become congested, with an effect resembling that of onanism. Such\r\nflagellation was practiced by the wanton ladies of ancient Rome. In the\r\nMiddle Ages, hysterical women derived great pleasure from the\r\nstimulatory effect of whippings. It is reported of Catharine de Medici,\r\nthat she had herself whipped, and that she delighted in seeing the\r\nladies of her court undergoing similar treatment. In the present day\r\nmany women derive intense sexual pleasure from being birched by their\r\nlovers on bared portions of their bodies. In Paris and other large towns\r\nthere are special places of resort for those who pursue this form of\r\nperverse sexual gratification. Sometimes such women are only the active\r\n_fouetteuses_ for worn-out, perversely-feeling men.\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks, a woman who had remained barren during the early years\r\nof marriage would visit the temple of Juno, in order to receive from a\r\npriest of Pan the gift of fertility. She stripped naked, and, while thus\r\nexposed to the flagellant priests, she received all over the back of her\r\nbody numerous blows inflicted with thongs of a he-goat’s hide—this\r\nprocess being supposed to induce fertility. The object of this form of\r\nflagellation would appear to be to induce an increase of sexual desire.\r\n\r\nSexual neurasthenia is defined by _Eulenburg_ as a neuropsychosis of\r\nchronic course, manifesting itself chiefly in the form of excessive\r\nirritability of the sensory and psychosensory neuron-systems, in\r\nassociation with excessive tendency to exhaustion of the motor and\r\npsychomotor neuron-systems. This exhaustion occurs especially in\r\nrelation to the genital system, in which we see exhibited the phenomena\r\nof irritable weakness, of increased excitability combined with increased\r\ntendency to fatigue of the genital nerve apparatus—such chronic morbid\r\ndisturbances are, according to this author, comparatively rare in women,\r\nthat is to say, the developed typical picture of the disease does not\r\noccur in women, or occurs very rarely. Among 168 patients suffering from\r\nsexual neurasthenia, only six were women. Two of these latter were\r\naddicted to masturbation, and in the anatomical sense both were still\r\nvirgins; the rest were married women, not receiving sufficient sexual\r\ngratification in their married life, two of these were probably also\r\naddicted to masturbation, two indulged in homosexual practices.\r\n\r\nOnanism, according to _Eulenburg_, is the cause of sexual neurasthenia\r\nin women as well as in men. If, however, among the relatively very large\r\nnumber of women addicted to masturbation, there appears to be such a\r\nvery small proportion of instances of sexual neurasthenia, this depends\r\non the fact that from the nature of onanism in women the physical and\r\nalso as a rule the psychical consequences are as a whole apt to be much\r\nless severe than those arising from similar practices in men; but it\r\ndepends also on the circumstances that neuromental abnormalities of\r\nother kinds and denoted by other names, such as dyspareunia, vaginismus,\r\nsexual hysteria, nymphomania, feminine sadism, and tribadism, are apt to\r\narise in consequence of onanism. As regards onanism, so also may it be\r\nin regard to sexual excesses and aberrations in general; they may be on\r\nthe one hand causes, but on the other symptoms and sequelæ, of sexual\r\nneurasthenia. Early-acquired or inherited homosexual tendencies and\r\nhabits may, as _Eulenburg_ further points out, lead to sexual\r\nneurasthenia only, but then very easily, when such individuals have\r\nallowed themselves, against their nature but in obedience to\r\nconventional points of view and to the advice of the relatives, to be\r\npersuaded into marriage. That sexual abstinence alone is competent to\r\ninduce sexual neurasthenia must be dismissed as a fable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  II. THE SEXUAL EPOCH OF THE MENACME.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the term _menacme_ I designate the culmination of the sexual\r\ndevelopment of woman, during which the processes of reproduction,\r\ncopulation, conception, pregnancy, parturition, and lactation occur.\r\n\r\nThe processes of puberty in woman are fully completed at the age of from\r\neighteen to twenty years, so that from this time forward she is fully\r\nequipped for the performance of her sexual duties. The first act in the\r\nfulfilment of these duties is copulation, which in civilized countries\r\nis in the great majority of women first undertaken at the commencement\r\nof married life. The average age at marriage in the women of this part\r\nof the world is 22; but marriages at an earlier age are very common, and\r\nin many circles of society the average age is as low as 20. The fullest\r\nmaturity of sexual activity in women occurs, however, in the\r\nthirty-second year of life, this being the year in which on the average\r\nthe maximum fertility is attained.\r\n\r\nAt the menacme, the beauty and energy of women attain their fullest\r\nevolution, her sexual characteristics their strongest development. It is\r\nthis period of life, however, that entails the greatest dangers to\r\nbeauty and health in connection with the functions of the genital\r\norgans. Copulation, the first act of sexual intercourse with the male,\r\noften produces in the female injuries from which she never completely\r\nrecovers. Gonorrhœal infection has been a source of unspeakable miseries\r\nto women. Motherhood itself entails the risk of a great number and\r\nvariety of illnesses, which, as puerperal sequelæ, affect this phase of\r\nwoman’s life. The struggle for existence, in which woman at her prime is\r\nalso involved, and the fulfilment of duties to husband and children,\r\nfurther lead to the production of a series of changes, both physical and\r\nmental, in the feminine organism, which influence all the functions.\r\n\r\nThe great characteristic of this epoch is maternity. In maternity the\r\nfully developed woman lives and has her being, but to maternity also she\r\noften succumbs as a sacrifice to the fulfilment of her natural\r\nfunctions. Inasmuch as in this sexual phase the functions of the genital\r\norgans are of greater importance, to the same degree is enhanced the\r\nimportance of the mutual relations between these organs and the other\r\norgans of the female body.\r\n\r\nAnother influence of fundamental importance in the sexually mature woman\r\nis that of the sexual impulse, the force of which is at times\r\noverwhelming, so that its gratification is sometimes sought without\r\nregard for the consequences to married and family life.\r\n\r\nThe physiology and pathology of the menacme coincides with the normal\r\nprocesses and pathological changes respectively of the female genital\r\norgans consequent on their functional activity as organs of sexual\r\nsensation and of reproduction. Woman as wife and mother stands at the\r\nclimax of her existence.\r\n\r\nIn a quite astonishing manner, however, many of the advocates of the\r\nmodern movement for the emancipation of women contest the significance\r\nof maternity to women.\r\n\r\nA modern authoress and supporter of women’s rights, _Ellen Key_, avows\r\nthat she was in error when at an earlier date she “regarded maternity as\r\nthe central point in woman’s existence.” She asserts that it lies within\r\nthe sphere of a woman’s individual rights, as of a man’s, to reject\r\nmarriage, or to accept marriage while rejecting maternity. “The grounds\r\nfor the rejection of maternity may as well be deeply altruistic as\r\ndeeply egoistic. It lies within the sphere of individual rights to\r\ndispense with love or with maternity when either is regarded or both are\r\nregarded from this point of view. It is entirely within a woman’s rights\r\nto transform herself into a member of the ‘third sex,’ the sex of the\r\nworker bee, of the neuter ant, if she finds therein her greatest\r\npleasure. * * * Women exist in whom erotic feeling is totally atrophied;\r\nthere are yet others who fail to find in intercourse with the modern man\r\nthat soulful and deep erotic harmony which they rightly desire; and\r\nthere are others still more numerous who desire love, but not maternity,\r\nwhich indeed they dread.”\r\n\r\nA celebrated German authoress of the present day, _Gabriele Reuter_,\r\nrefers in similar terms to the justifiable fear with which so many\r\naspiring and hard-working women regard maternity, “the perpetual,\r\nwatchful, emotional dread of motherhood, a dread which causes them to\r\nturn at bay. A dread, a hatred, it is, which has grown so strong, so\r\nactive, that one might almost regard it as an obscure perverse instinct,\r\nawakened and developed and strengthened by bitter necessity. It is as if\r\nin the innermost recesses of their nature such women had a belief that\r\nshould they pay their tribute to sex they would loose all the energy,\r\nclearness, and brightness of mind, by means of which they have raised\r\nthemselves above the level of their sex. And perhaps women of a certain\r\ntype are justified in this fear.”\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, the woman who does not prize maternity still\r\nremains an exception. The great instinct for the preservation of the\r\nspecies, which nature has planted deeply in every human being, still as\r\na rule in women remains much more powerful than the instinct of\r\nself-preservation at every one else’s expense—more powerful than such\r\nself-sufficient egoism. And now as ever it is the duty of humanity to\r\neducate women for maternity from her youth upward, so that she is in\r\nevery way fitted for the supreme duty of her sexual nature, the renewal\r\nof life from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nAgainst the significance and importance of maternity to woman, the\r\nmountainous waves of the movement for the emancipation of women dash\r\nthemselves as vainly as against the solid rock. Much justification may\r\nbe found for the efforts of women in modern civilized communities to\r\nengage in departments of activity to which hitherto men only have been\r\nadmitted; and as regards the intellectual capacity of women we may\r\nacknowledge their competence for the higher scientific professions; but\r\nwhile admitting this we must hold firmly to the physiological standpoint\r\nand must more especially bear in mind the sexual life of woman. Such\r\nprofessions only are suitable for a woman as do not entail a restriction\r\nof the sphere of her reproductive activity, a hindrance to her principal\r\nduty, that of maternity, an interference with the discharge of her\r\nobligations to husband and children, or a diminution of her domestic\r\nvalue and an evasion of her responsibilities in family life. As _L. von\r\nStein_ so justly remarks, the woman who spends the whole day at a desk,\r\nin the law courts, or in a house of assembly, may be a most honorable\r\nand most useful individual, but she is no longer a woman, she cannot be\r\na wife, she cannot be a mother. In the condition of our society, the\r\nemancipation of woman is in its very nature the negation of marriage.\r\n\r\nWe may not agree with the great misogynist, _Schopenhaur_, in his\r\ndepreciation of the female sex, or in his assertion that woman exists\r\nsimply and solely for the propagation of the species, and that “her life\r\nshould therefore flow more quietly, more inconspicuously, and more\r\ngently than that of man toward its goal;” nor need we regard as\r\njustified the severe sentence of the philosopher, _E. von Hartmann_,\r\nthat from the moral standpoint, “the greater number of women pass the\r\nwhole of their lives in a state of minority, and, therefore, to the end\r\nstand in need of supervision and guidance;” but the statement made by\r\n_Friedr. Nietsche_ in his book _Also sprach Zarathustra_ deserves\r\nacceptation, “Everything in woman is a riddle, and everything in woman\r\nhas its answer: it is called pregnancy,” and again, “For woman, man is\r\nonly the means; the end is always the child.”\r\n\r\nUnsearchable in its judgments, nature has imposed on woman alone the\r\nconsequences of the act of generation; man has the pleasure, but not the\r\nlabor and the pain. We might indeed regard as highly unjust the\r\ndistribution of the rôles in the process of reproduction, were it not\r\nthat in a mother’s love and a mother’s joys, woman finds a compensatory\r\nsolace. The man’s part is a much easier one and costs far less than that\r\nof woman; with the gratification of his sexual desire, man shakes off\r\nany further responsibility, whereas the woman’s body becomes the\r\nworkshop in the wonderful act of creation of a new human life.\r\n\r\nMaternity, says _Lombroso_, is the characteristic function of the female\r\nsex, upon which rests her whole organic and physical variability, and\r\nthis function is indeed throughout of an altruistic nature. Although\r\nthere is a certain antagonism between the sexual impulse and\r\nmaternity—according to _Icard_, the sexual impulse is extinguished in\r\nwomen during pregnancy,—still, maternity appears to depend upon sexual\r\nperceptions. For instance, the act of suckling the infant often arouses\r\nvoluptuous sensations, and _Icard_ mentions a case in which a woman\r\npermitted fertilization to occur solely on account of the pleasure\r\nobtained by suckling. The anatomical cause of this fact is to be found\r\nin the connections between the nipple and the uterus by way of the\r\nsympathetic nervous system. * * * It is likewise probable that in the\r\nhappy feeling of maternity there intermingle very gentle voluptuous\r\nsensations derived from the genital organs. According to _Bain_ also,\r\nvery delicate sensations of contact form an element in maternal love.\r\n\r\nThe epoch of the menacme is that in which, independently of maternity,\r\nthe sexual impulse often becomes so powerful in woman as to be entirely\r\ndominant. The problems relating to marriage and to the sexual position\r\nof woman, so widely discussed at the present day, are, therefore, of\r\nespecial importance in regard to women at this period of life. The\r\nforcible repression and control of the sexual impulse inculcated by\r\nmoral and religious ordinances are now, according to the modern leaders,\r\nboth male and female, of the woman’s movement, to be abandoned; and it\r\nis loudly asserted that every woman has the same right as man to\r\nphysical love and the happiness it produces. Hence, free love is\r\ndemanded. “Freedom in love, freedom for love—this is what the dignity of\r\nthe human race demands,” asserts the authoress of a book recently\r\npublished (_Elisabeta von Steinborn_, _The Sexual Position of Woman_).\r\nWith laws for the regulation of marriage, this section of the women’s\r\nrights party will have nothing to do. A truly good and honorable man,\r\nthey contend, has as little need of laws to regulate his amorous\r\nrelations as he has of laws against murder and theft. In the first\r\nplace, love, the sexual relation between man and woman, must be free,\r\nand humanity, freed from vexations and needless control, will then seek\r\nand find the proper path, even if at the expense of a few errors by the\r\nway. Only after this unrestrained sexual intercourse has lasted for a\r\nlong time, will free marriage become the rule. “Out of this phase will\r\ndevelop the monogamic system willed by God, for which, in its most ideal\r\nform, we are not yet sufficiently ripe.” It is hardly necessary to\r\ndiscuss in detail the general deleterious influence of such unlimited,\r\nunregulated free love upon the community, upon human society as a whole,\r\nto describe the results of free love, to attempt to realize the chaos\r\nwhich it would bring about in the social relations of civilized\r\nhumanity. We must rather indicate it as desirable from the medical\r\nstandpoint also, that such a change in general domestic economy shall be\r\naimed at as will enable the great majority of women to share in married\r\nlife and family happiness, and thus making allowance both for human\r\nnature and the demands of social life, to effect a true harmony between\r\nsexual morality and sexual practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 48.—The female pudendum, or vulva, with the labia majora. The\r\n    vulval cleft. Female perineum. Mons veneris, with the pubic hair.\r\n    (From Toldt: Atlas of Human Anatomy.—Rebman Company, New York.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe must point out that in so far as the modern woman’s movement aims at\r\ndispensing with man and at basing the entire life of woman upon the\r\nindependent ego, that movement is in opposition to nature and its\r\neternal laws. A woman who thus seeks the solution of the woman’s\r\nquestion in the direction of freedom and independence is one who\r\nendeavors to avoid the burthen of womanhood. She desires to escape,\r\nalways from guardianship, often from maternity, and usually from the\r\nrestrictions, the unselfishness of womanhood. But none the less does she\r\nremain unable to escape from her femininity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 49.—Vestibule of the vagina, with the labia minora or nymphæ, the\r\n    vaginal and urethral orifices, and the glans clitoridis. (From\r\n    Toldt: Atlas of Human Anatomy.—Rebman Company, New York.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The true significance of woman,” insists _Laura Marholm_ in opposition\r\nto the modern tendency, “has at all times consisted rather in what she\r\nis than in what she performs, and it is precisely in the former point\r\nthat the women of the present day seem so unusually wanting. Their\r\nperformances are indeed many and various, they study and they write\r\ninnumerable books, they are the directors or principals of all possible\r\nconcerns and collect funds for every possible object, they wear doctors’\r\ngowns, conduct agitations, and found clubs, and they come continually\r\nmore and more into publicity. And yet their public significance is after\r\nall diminished. The greater the influence of woman in the mass and as a\r\nnumerical majority, the less is her influence as an individual, the\r\nsmaller is the triumph of her sex. She herself has induced man to sound\r\nthe trumpet note of the abhorrence of women. _Tolstoi_ in The _Kreuzer\r\nSonata_, _Strindberg_ in numerous dramas, _Huysmans_ in _En Ménage_,\r\nwrite in this strain; and in the works of many lesser luminaries we\r\nencounter this mistrust of love. * * * The modern system of education\r\nfor girls, with its polyglossia and polymathy, favors a superficial\r\ndevelopment of the understanding, and produces women who are pretentious\r\nwithout being profound.”\r\n\r\nFeminine beauty suffers during the menacme from the stress of the\r\ndemands made on the sexual activity as well as on the functional\r\ncapacity of the individual. Repeated, rapidly succeeding pregnancies and\r\nconfinements impair the beauty of the breasts and the abdomen, the\r\nfigure and the carriage. In consequence of suckling, the breasts,\r\nhitherto firm and elastic, usually become more or less pendent and\r\nwrinkled, sometimes also flabby and inelastic, sometimes nodular.\r\nDiseases of the genital organs and the disorders of the general health\r\ndependent thereon, leave disfiguring wrinkles in the face and other\r\ntraces in the whole structure of the body. Toil, anxiety, and grief also\r\nwrite their horrible marks deeply on the appearance. The mature\r\nworking-class woman, through sharing in masculine labors, through\r\nlong-continued muscular exertion, and through neglect of bodily care,\r\nfrequently assumes in her features, her carriage, her figure, and her\r\nwhole appearance, a rather masculine type.\r\n\r\nThe beauty and the youthful freshness of girls belonging to the\r\nlabouring classes seldom endure for long after the menarche, and in\r\ncases in which the environment is one of poverty, they last through a\r\nvery short part only of the epoch of the menacme. The early appearance\r\nof wrinkles in the face, the stiff, angular character of the movements,\r\nthe ungraceful carriage of the body, all these combine to make a woman\r\nof five-and-twenty who groans under the burthen of toil appear at the\r\nfirst glance an elderly woman, and a closer investigation shows what\r\ndamage has been wrought to the attributes of beauty, how the breasts are\r\nflabby and flattened, the belly prominent, the buttocks pendulous, the\r\narms muscular.\r\n\r\nIn the well-to-do classes, again, at this period of life, when generous\r\ndiet combines with insufficient exercise, an abundant deposit of adipose\r\ntissue may already have occurred, resulting in a great impairment of\r\nbeauty, the body and limbs being enlarged, the gait and the carriage\r\ncorrespondingly altered for the worse—changes which seem desirable only\r\nto those orientals to whom such obesity, such exaggeration of\r\nfemininity, is sexually stimulating. If, however, this deposit of fat is\r\nnot excessive, this it is which endows women during these years of\r\nfullest development with an imposing appearance and buxom form. In\r\nfavourable circumstances, beauty of this type may persist to the\r\nfortieth year of life and even beyond, and it is of such a character as\r\nto justify the proverb that woman’s first sexual epoch is dedicated to\r\nlove, her second to voluptuousness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 50.—The uterus, the left Fallopian tube and the left ovary, in\r\n    their connection with the broad ligament of the uterus, which has\r\n    been fully unfolded.

(From Toldt: Atlas of Human Anatomy.—Rebman Company, New\r\n    York.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Bountiful nature,” writes _Mantegazza_, regarding woman at this sexual\r\nepoch, “sends to woman an ingenious engineer, who enlarges the hills to\r\nmountains and fills up the valleys with a soft alluvium of fat. The\r\ncommencing wrinkles disappear, being smoothed out under the beneficial\r\ninfluence of this plastic material; the slender, elastic palm-tree stems\r\nare converted into majestic columns of Parian marble; quality is\r\nreplaced by quantity, and if the eye has lost a few provinces, the hand\r\nhas gained just as many. * * * A certain number of chosen women\r\nunderstand how to preserve for as long as ten years the unstable\r\nequilibrium of the period which separates these two ages of life. There\r\nare divine beings who with every oscillation of their tresses or rocking\r\nof their hips, with every undulation of their bosom, every serpentine\r\nmovement of their limbs, instil desire. * * * They constitute our most\r\nintense delight, and our intensest torment, they make our life a\r\nblessing or a curse, they are the uttermost goal of human passion, of\r\nhuman voluptuous desire.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 51.—Female internal genital organs in the fully developed state.\r\n    (From Toldt: Atlas of Human Anatomy.—Rebman Company, New York.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmong the injuries to beauty effected by pregnancy, one above all\r\nevident to the eye is the almost invariably ensuing change in the skin,\r\nprincipally taking the form of a change in pigmentation, with the\r\nappearance of spots varying in size and tint, on the face and especially\r\non the lips and the forehead; there is greatly increased pigmentation\r\nalso of the areola mammæ and the linea alba, and in addition of the\r\nlabia majora and minora and of the anal region. It is not certain\r\nwhether this chloasma uterinum is dependent, as _Jeamin_ assumes, on the\r\ndiscontinuance of menstruation, or, as _Virchow_ believes, on changes in\r\nthe blood and the blood-pressure. Sometimes also, in pregnant women, we\r\nobserve on the face, chiefly on the nose and the cheeks, dilatations of\r\nthe small cutaneous vessels, often associated with acne nodules.\r\n\r\nA permanent disfigurement is caused by the _lineæ_ (vel _striæ_)\r\n_albicantes_, white lines or streaks of varying length and resembling\r\nscar tissue in appearance on the skin of the abdomen, the adjoining\r\nparts of the buttocks and thighs, the lower part of the front of the\r\nthorax, and the mammæ. They are not true scars, not being new formations\r\nof connective tissue, being on the contrary dependent on solutions of\r\ncontinuity, on relative diminution, that is to say, of the connective\r\ntissue layer of the skin. They are formed in consequence of the fact\r\nthat the connective tissue bundles are not able to keep pace in their\r\nsuperficial enlargement with the necessarily rapid extension of the\r\ncutis, hence great meshes appear in the former, situate in the direction\r\nof the greatest tension of the skin. (_Spietschka_ and _Grünfeld_).\r\n\r\nTransiently during pregnancy, but in some cases permanently also, the\r\nbeauty of the lower extremities is apt to be impaired by enlargements of\r\nthe veins, the formation of varices, and sometimes also by œdema; these\r\nconditions depend upon the hindrance to the venous return caused by the\r\npressure of the pregnant uterus. Thick, vermicular, bluish strings or\r\nnodular enlargements appear in the course of the great veins, with\r\nconsequent eczema and ulceration. In pregnant woman, eczema is common in\r\nother regions, on the face, the hands, the forearms, and the genitals;\r\nalso erythema, urticaria, and the pustular eruption known as impetigo\r\nherpetiformis.\r\n\r\nParturition and lactation entail further disfigurement of the skin\r\nthrough the production of various lesions, such as cracks and fissures\r\nof the skin of the breast, dermatitis due to venous thrombosis in the\r\nlower extremities, scarring of the breast after mastitis, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the description of the sexual life of woman in the epoch of the\r\nmenacme, we shall consider at some length copulation and conception, the\r\nrelations of fertility and sterility, the important topic of the use of\r\nmeasures for the prevention of pregnancy, and the interesting subject of\r\nthe determination of sex; on the other hand, pregnancy, parturition, and\r\nthe puerperal state, since these subjects are specially treated in the\r\nordinary textbooks on midwifery, we shall discuss only in so far as\r\ncertain relations between these reproductive processes and the organism\r\nas a whole and its functions, appear to us especially worthy of note.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANATOMICAL CHANGES IN THE FEMALE GENITAL ORGANS IN THE PERIOD OF THE\r\n                                MENACME.\r\n\r\nIn the fully-developed woman during the period of the menacme, the mons\r\nVeneris forms a rounded elevation which consists of very dense\r\nconnective tissue containing large quantities of fat, while the\r\nintegument that covers it is usually coated with a thick growth of hair.\r\nThe form of this hairy covering, which by the Roman poets was designated\r\n_Hebe_, by the Greeks _zunaikomustax_ (translated by _Albrecht Dürer_ as\r\n_Weybsbart_—woman’s beard), by _Galen_ termed _ornamentum loci_, is\r\nvarious, and, as an external sexual character, it deserves more accurate\r\nobservation than it has hitherto received from anatomists.\r\n\r\nThe hairy covering of the female genital organs is in adults, and\r\nespecially in brunettes, very abundant; above, it is usually sharply\r\nlimited by a transverse line across the top of the mons Veneris, and it\r\nextends outwards only a little beyond the labia majora, whilst below it\r\nextends only to about the middle of the sides of the perineum. According\r\nto _Bergh_, however, who made an exact study of this matter in 2,200\r\nwomen of ages for the most part between fourteen and thirty years, in\r\nsome cases the shape of the patch of hair (which is in such instances\r\nalways very thick) resembles that so common in the male, there being a\r\npointed process, usually rather narrow, extending upward toward the\r\nnavel. This masculine form of the pubic hair is by no means common in\r\nwomen; according to _Lombroso_ it is met with more frequently in Italian\r\nwomen than in those belonging to other European nations. In most women,\r\nthe thick hairy covering of the mons Veneris is sharply limited above by\r\nthe curved line that indicates the upper margin of the eminence, whereas\r\nin men a strip of hair usually passes up from the mons pubis to the\r\numbilicus. Still, exceptions are met with. Thus, in 100 women,\r\n_Schultze_ found five in whom the hairy covering extended up to the\r\nnavel. Sometimes other variations occur, for instance, the hair may\r\nextend laterally into the groin, occasionally as far as the anterior\r\nsuperior spine of the ilium, and across the upper part of the front of\r\nthe thigh, not infrequently in association with a thick growth of hair\r\nalong the sides of the perineum as far as the anus. Of women with the\r\nhair growing in this fashion, not a few appeared to _Bergh_ to have\r\nunusually strong sexual passion.\r\n\r\nIn contradistinction to these cases in which the development of the\r\npubic hair is thick and even excessive, we meet with others in which it\r\nis very scanty, and this not only in quite young individuals (at an age\r\nfrom 15 to 18 years), with but slight development of the labia, but also\r\nin older and fully developed women—for the most part blondes.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the pubic hair is thickest and strongest near the median\r\nline, whilst laterally the hairy covering is thinner and weaker. The\r\nthickness is extremely variable. “In some women we find a flattened,\r\noccasionally frizzled, turf-like covering; in others, a dense, elevated,\r\nluxuriant bush of hair” (_Bergh_). The length of the pubic hair is\r\nvariable, but as a rule it is somewhat shorter in the female than in the\r\nmale. Still, cases have been known in women in which it reached to the\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the pubic hair commonly resembles that of the hair of the\r\nhead, but the pubic hair is usually the darker of the two. Blondes with\r\ndark or black eyebrows have, according to _Bergh_, usually dark or black\r\npubic hair. The pubic hair turns grey late in life, later as a rule than\r\nthe hair of any other part, a fact known already to _Aristotle_; it is\r\nrather late in life also that the pubic hair becomes thin, and in this\r\nstate it remains almost invariably up to an advanced age, even when the\r\nscalp has become almost or quite bald.\r\n\r\nThe pubic hair, according to the same author, is seldom straight, being\r\nalmost always curly, frizzled, or more or less rolled up into rings or\r\nspirals, generally forming smaller or larger locks. Fairly often, we\r\nmeet with curled locks, either one pair or two, symmetrically disposed\r\non either side of the depression adjoining the præputium clitoridis;\r\nthese usually have an outward direction. Much more rarely we find\r\nsimilar locks symmetrically attached further back on the labia.\r\n\r\nIn the case of 1,000 adult women examined by _Eggel_ with regard to the\r\ncolour of the pubic hair, the colour of the eyes, and the colour of the\r\nhair of the head, there were 239 with dark eyes, 333 with dark hair on\r\nthe head, and 329 with dark pubic hair; contrariwise, 761 had light\r\neyes, 667 light hair on the head, and 679 light pubic hair. Obviously,\r\nthen, a considerable number of women with light-coloured eyes must have\r\nhad dark pubic hair. _Roth_, in 1,000 North German women examined by\r\nhim, found the pubic hair blonde, but a rather dark blonde, in a large\r\nmajority of the cases; in red-haired women, the pubic hair was in all\r\ncases bright red, in black-haired women the pubic hair was black in\r\ntwo-thirds only of the cases, in nearly a third it was brown, in two\r\ncases dark blonde; in Jewesses, in a large majority of instances, the\r\npubic hair is brown. The arrangement of the pubic hair is described by\r\n_Roth_ as very variable. “Sometimes it is short and frizzly, sometimes a\r\nluxuriant bushy growth; sometimes the hairs are scanty and thinly set;\r\nsometimes they are irregularly distributed; sometimes we see only a\r\nnarrow strip of long hairs down the middle of the mons Veneris, which is\r\nbare at the sides. In some the lateral boundaries of the pubic hair are\r\nsharply defined, in others the hairy covering spreads beyond the usual\r\nlimits.”\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient Greeks and Romans, it was customary for women to\r\nremove the pubic hair, a custom even now observed by all oriental races;\r\nfor this reason in ancient art the nude female body is depicted without\r\npubic hair. According to _Stratz_, in the _Chansons de Bilitis_ it is\r\nsaid of the priestesses of Astarte: “They never draw their hairs out, in\r\norder that the dark triangle of the goddess shall represent on their\r\nbodies the form of a temple.”\r\n\r\nThe physiological purpose of the pubic hair is to prevent irritation of\r\nthe genital organs by the sweat that would otherwise run down upon them,\r\nand to protect the skin from direct friction during the act of\r\ncopulation.\r\n\r\nThe labia majora in women during the menacme are usually strongly\r\ndeveloped, their outer surface is hairy; in parous women we almost\r\ninvariably observe small or even large lacerations of the frænulum\r\npudendi or fourchette, in front of the posterior commissure of the\r\nvulva. On the inner surface also of the labia majora, the general\r\ncharacters of which are those of mucous membrane rather than of skin,\r\nfine hairs are also to be found. In multiparæ, and even in women who\r\nhave frequently had sexual intercourse, these inner surfaces of the\r\nlabia majora are not usually any longer in mutual contact, so that the\r\nrima urogenitalis or vulval cleft gapes more or less. In well-nourished\r\nwomen who have led the “sheltered life,” the dense and fat-containing\r\nconnective tissue of the labia majora (continuous with and similar to\r\nthat of the mons Veneris) gives these structures a certain firmness and\r\nelasticity, and the labia minora or nymphæ do not project beyond them.\r\nBut when the genital organs are not well preserved, projection of the\r\nnymphæ occurs. In women whose genital organs are beautifully formed, the\r\nnymphæ are of a soft, delicate consistency, and their mucous membrane is\r\nof a pink color; but when the reproductive organs have been subjected to\r\nexcessive stimulation, the nymphæ are dry, hard, brown in color, and\r\nthey project from the vulval cleft. In women of the Hottentot and\r\nBosjesman races, the nymphæ attain, as is well known, an excessive\r\nlength, forming the so-called “Hottentot-apron;” and in certain other\r\nindigenous races of Africa, the enormous size of these organs renders\r\nresection necessary.\r\n\r\nDuring this sexual epoch, in women with strong sexual passion and having\r\nfrequent sexual intercourse, the clitoris is largely developed, and\r\nsometimes the dorsum of the organ protrudes from between the anterior\r\nextremities of the labia majora.\r\n\r\nThe vaginal orifice gapes a little, so that the irregular carunculæ\r\nmyrtiformes are visible. In parous women, the vaginal orifice is\r\nenlarged in such a manner that the wall of the vagina passes directly\r\nand without limitation into the wall of the vestibule, and the external\r\norifice (meatus) of the urethra is situate immediately in front of the\r\nanterior vaginal column, and thus lies within the vaginal orifice.\r\n\r\nThe breasts of a strong, healthy woman who has attained complete sexual\r\nmaturity are more or less firm in consistency, and considerable in size,\r\nexceeding now _Ovid’s_ demand concerning these organs, _ut sit quod\r\ncapiat nostra tegatque manus_. The normal hemispherical form and the\r\nsomewhat soft texture are subject to many variations, these being\r\ndependent upon race, climate, and sexual activity and also upon the kind\r\nof clothing worn. The nipple and its encircling areola are usually of a\r\nbrownish colour; but in beautiful women they sometimes retain the pink\r\ncolour characteristic of these structures in the virgin. In parous women\r\nwho have suckled their children, the breasts are usually pendent, and\r\noften the left breast will be found to be somewhat larger than the\r\nother; generally also in such women the nipples are longer and thicker\r\nthan normal. Not infrequently the nipples are withdrawn into a furrow of\r\nthe skin, and become prominent only on local stimulation or as a result\r\nof sexual excitement. Sometimes in the region of the areola, especially\r\nin brunettes, we see a circle of small glands, which produce eminences\r\nbeneath the skin.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that the breasts of such women in general no\r\nlonger have the virginal form of small hemispheres, but have matured to\r\na greater fulness and size. This, however, does not diminish their\r\nbeauty, for the ideal of beauty must take into account the natural\r\ndevelopment of the body. Whereas at the present time, under the\r\ninfluence of the modern negation or at any rate undervaluation of\r\nmaternity as the goal of woman’s life, it is the tendency of a certain\r\nschool of art to misprize the influence of that state on the form of the\r\nbreast, and to esteem the “flat bosom,” at an earlier day under the\r\ninfluence of _Rousseau’s Emile_, a book in which mothers are strongly\r\nurged to suckle their own children, the full bosom as a beauty was the\r\nfashion in art.\r\n\r\nOnly a perverted taste can find a woman beautiful without bosom—without\r\n“that golden chalice, from which men quaff love, and children life”\r\n(_Mantegazza_),—an angular, flat being, without a rounded form. Nothing\r\nbut a morbid desire for equality with man can induce woman herself to\r\nendeavor to conceal also the external manifestation of her sexual\r\ncharacteristics, and by her clothing to disguise, like a nun, the sexual\r\ncurves of her figure.\r\n\r\nGreat deposit of fat, such as occurs from liberal feeding in conjunction\r\nwith a sedentary mode of life, or as a result of several pregnancies,\r\ndestroys the beautiful form of the breasts, which attain an immoderate\r\nsize, thus disturbing the grace and symmetry of the feminine figure, a\r\nfact recognized already by the Romans. _Hyrtl_ condemns, from the point\r\nof view of anatomical beauty, the nude female figures in the pictures of\r\nRubens, remarking that “the goddesses and angels of this painter are as\r\nluxuriant in their development as a Flemish dairy-maid;” and the buxom\r\n“goat’s-udder breast” prized by the Arabs does not represent any nobler\r\nideal of beauty. Sometimes these excessively large and fat breasts hang\r\ndown in a conical form, or, as more or less flattened hemispheres, reach\r\nright down over the gastric region; moreover, the interspace between the\r\ntwo breasts seems to disappear, and they touch or rub against one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Ploss_ and _Bartels_, the various forms of breast\r\noccurring in different races may be classified as follows: A. According\r\nto size: 1, very large; 2, large; 3, medium; 4, small. B. According to\r\nconsistency and firmness: 1, high; 2, semi-pendent; 3, pendent. C.\r\nAccording to shape: 1, shell-shaped (disc-shaped); 2, hemispherical; 3,\r\nconical. The nipples also, according to these authors, exhibit\r\nvariations dependent upon race, being in some cases small and flat, like\r\na little knob, in some cases large and conical in shape, with a broad\r\nbase and a rounded extremity, and in some cases large and cylindrical,\r\nhaving almost the shape of a finger-joint. The areola, finally, is in\r\nsome women quite pale in color, in some dark pink, in some brown and\r\neven almost black from excess of pigment.\r\n\r\nThe uterus of a woman who has attained complete sexual maturity, has\r\nundergone such alterations in its proportions that the cervix and the\r\nbody are of almost the same length. The constriction, visible\r\nexternally, indicating the separation between these two segments of the\r\norgan, is depressed somewhat toward the external os. In sexually active\r\nwomen, a widening and an increased curvature of the region of the fundus\r\noccur, the uterine extremities of the Fallopian tubes becoming more\r\nwidely separated; at the same time the posterior wall becomes more and\r\nmore convex. The more frequently the uterus has functioned as a\r\nreproductive organ, the more strongly marked is the convexity of the\r\nbody of that organ. The relative lengths of the corporal and cervical\r\nportions of the uterine cavity are now the reverse of those that obtain\r\nin the uterus of the child; the transverse and antero-posterior\r\ndiameters have greatly increased. Transverse diameter at the fundus;\r\nvirgin, 4 centimetres (1.575″), multipara, 5.5–6.5 centimetres\r\n(2.165–2.559″): sagittal (antero-posterior) diameter; virgin, 2\r\ncentimetres (0.787″); multipara, 3–3.5 centimetres (1.181–1.378″).\r\n(_Chrobak_ and _von Rosthorn_.)\r\n\r\nDuring the menacme, in consequence of the act of reproduction, the\r\nuterus undergoes important changes in form. In a nulliparous married\r\nwoman, the uterus differs little from that of a virgin; the cavity is\r\nsomewhat more extensive, the convexity of the outer surface a little\r\ngreater, there is some increase in width in the neighborhood of the\r\nfundus, the plicæ palmatæ (_arbor vitæ uterinum_) are confined to the\r\ncervical canal; further, under the influence of copulation the\r\nappearance of the vagina changes, it becomes larger, and its walls\r\nbecome smoother, sometimes quite smooth, from the disappearance of the\r\nrugæ of the mucous membrane and especially of those attached to the\r\nposterior vaginal column. Much more extensive are the alterations in the\r\nuterus of a multipara. According to _Toldt_, “the parts of the cavity\r\nrepresenting the cornua, which are pointed on either side as they pass\r\ntoward the Fallopian tubes, become completely included in the lower\r\nundivided portion of the cavity, this change being effected chiefly by\r\nmeans of the increasing outward curvature of the walls, so that the\r\ncavity comes to assume an amygdaloid form; the cervical canal is also\r\nenlarged, especially the lower part, where also the plicæ palmatæ\r\n(_arbor vitæ uterinum_) becomes less distinct; the vaginal portion of\r\nthe cervix is shortened, the os uteri externum gapes, the lips of the\r\ncervix are tumid, nearly equal in length, and usually beset with scarred\r\ndepressions.” In nulliparae, the vaginal portion of the cervix is, as in\r\na virgin, of a rather tough consistency, smooth on the surface, while\r\nthe external os is small, like a dimple, or transversely oval; the color\r\nof the vaginal portion of the cervix is identical with that of the\r\nvaginal mucous membrane in general. Through frequent copulation,\r\nhowever, the form of the vaginal portion of the cervix is so far altered\r\ninasmuch as it is more freely supplied with blood, and, therefore,\r\nchanges slightly, in consistency. In multiparæ, in consequence of\r\nlacerations of the cervix, the os uteri externum changes to a wide\r\ntransverse fissure with tumid margins, justifying the old designation of\r\nthis orifice as _os tincæ_;, carp’s mouth. A large size of the external\r\nand internal os, moderate enlargement of the cavity, rounding of the\r\nupper angles adjacent to the uterine orifices of the Fallopian tubes,\r\nincreased convexity of the walls, and partial or complete effacement of\r\nthe plicæ palmatæ (_arbor vitæ uterinum_), are the characteristics of\r\nthe uterus of a multipara (_Chrobak_ and _von Rosthorn_). According to\r\n_Hennig_, the vaginal portion of the cervix is longest in women who have\r\nundergone defloration, and in nulliparae; widest in prostitutes;\r\nnarrowest in childless wives; thickest in young widows. This author\r\ngives the following measurements of the external os, showing its\r\nvariations in accordance with age and sexual activity:\r\n\r\n In childhood, transversely oval             0.46–0.56 cm. (0.18–0.22″)\r\n In the virgin, rounded                      0.20–0.50 cm. (0.08–0.20″)\r\n In prostitutes, transversely, oval          0.60–2.50 cm. (0.24–0.98″)\r\n In sterile married women, round                  0.16 cm.      (0.06″)\r\n In parous married women, transverse fissure      1.10 cm.      (0.43″)\r\n After the menopause                              0.81 cm.      (0.32″)\r\n\r\nIn the fully-developed woman, the ovaries undergo changes in size,\r\nshape, and consistency, these changes being dependent upon the\r\nage, the sexual functional activity, and the constitutional\r\npredispositions of the individual. The average length of the ovary\r\nis 3–4 centimetres (1.18–1.58″); the average width, 2–3\r\ncentimetres (0.79–1.18″); and the average thickness 1 centimetre\r\n(0.39″). The surface of this organ gradually assumes a ragged\r\nappearance, from the scarred depressions caused by the great\r\nnumber of successive menstruations (ovulations)—sometimes the\r\nappearance produced resembles that of a mulberry.\r\n\r\nIn the vagina at this sexual epoch, the surface of the anterior and\r\nposterior vaginal walls is rendered uneven and rugose by well-developed\r\nvaginal columns (_columnæ rugarum_), which feel almost as hard as\r\ncartilage, and project considerably above the general level of the wall;\r\nthe transverse ridges (_rugæ_) run horizontally outward from the\r\ncolumns. By frequent copulation, the rugæ are partially effaced, and the\r\ncolumns themselves become flatter and softer; still, except in cases in\r\nwhich the genital functions are exercised to great excess, the vagina\r\nremains tense and rugose until after several children have been born,\r\nwhen it becomes soft, flaccid, and smooth. Even in women who have been\r\naccustomed to frequent intercourse, the narrowest portion of the vagina\r\nis still the orifice and the part of the passage lying immediately\r\nwithin the orifice, which can be constricted by the levator ani muscle;\r\nchildbirth, however, brings about great and permanent distension of\r\nthese parts also. The widest and most distensible portion of the vagina\r\nis the uppermost segment, the region of the fornices.\r\n\r\nA special significance must be attached to the glands of the cervix\r\nuteri, which, according to my own observations, have the function of\r\nproviding a secretion that increases the mobility of the spermatozoa,\r\nand this enables them more readily to find their way into the uterus. I\r\nhave endeavored, by a series of histological observations, to determine\r\nthe properties of these glands and the changes they undergo in the\r\ndifferent phases of sexual life. The most important results of these\r\nresearches may be stated as follows. These glands, which are lined with\r\ncolumnar ciliated epithelium, are but slightly developed before puberty,\r\nbeing then simple excavations; at the time of the menarche, they become\r\ntubular; later, during the menacme, they become long, dendriform,\r\nblind-ending glands, which during menstruation and under the influence\r\nof sexual excitement, furnish a secretion, variable in quantity, and in\r\nquality distinguished especially by its alkaline reaction; further, in\r\nconnection with a number of pathological disorders of the female genital\r\norgans, these glands undergo various changes both in their anatomical\r\nstructure and in their secretory activity. At the time of the menopause\r\nand after the climacteric age, these glands, which have hitherto\r\nconsisted of branched tubules, tend to undergo cystic degeneration,\r\nleading to the formation of the vesicles known as _ovula Nabothi_. After\r\nthe climacteric, the existence of these cysts may be regarded as a\r\nnormal occurrence; and, sometimes arranged in grape-like clusters, they\r\noften project so as to occupy the greater part of the lumen of the\r\ncervical canal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 52.—Sagittal section through the cervix uteri of a woman 26 years\r\n    of age, dendriform branched glands.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 53.—Cervix of a woman 72 years of age, with glands that have\r\n    undergone cystic degeneration.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 54.—Sagittal section through the cervix uteri of a woman 65 years\r\n    of age. The glands have undergone cystic degeneration.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDiseases of the uterine mucous membrane during the period of sexual\r\nmaturity often induce various pathological changes in these cervical\r\nglands. In consequence of obstruction of their excretory ducts, they may\r\nundergo cystic degeneration, forming follicles filled with mucus and\r\nepithelium, or cavities containing blood, which pass through the\r\nsubstance of the cervix in every direction; or they may give rise to the\r\nformation of slowly-growing glandular polypi and other glandular new\r\nformations—changes the general result of all of which is to interfere\r\nwith the secretory function of the glands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PATHOLOGY OF THE MENACME.\r\n\r\nThe full evolution of the sexual life brings in its train many dangers\r\nto a woman’s life. This appears at first sight from a comparison of the\r\nmortality of married women during the period of greatest sexual activity\r\nwith that of single women of similar age. Between the ages of 20 and 25\r\nyears, the mortality of married women is in all races higher than that\r\nof unmarried women; and the same is true between the ages of 25 and 30\r\nyears, except in France, in which country from artificial causes\r\nmaternity ceases at a very early age. In Prussia, in the year 1880, of\r\nevery 10,000 married women, between the ages named, 21 died, of every\r\n10,000 unmarried women, only 2. In Holland, Belgium, and Bavaria, this\r\nexcess in the mortality of married women continues up to the age of 40\r\nyears; whilst in Prussia, from the age of 30 upward, the mortality of\r\nmarried women and unmarried is practically the same. In many countries,\r\nthe mortality of married women at many ages exceeds even that of\r\nunmarried men.\r\n\r\nThis greater comparative mortality of married women is ascribed by\r\n_Hegar_ to the satisfaction of the sexual impulse, and this authority\r\nbelieves that the dangers attendant on this function would be manifested\r\nyet more clearly if the contrast were made, not between married women\r\nand single, but between those habituated to sexual indulgence and those\r\nwho are continent. We, however, are of opinion, that the satisfaction of\r\nthe sexual impulse is only harmful to this extent, that it exposes women\r\nto the consequences of venereal infection, and also to the risk of\r\nnumerous puerperal and other diseases of the genital organs. This is\r\nproved also by the statistical results of the investigations concerning\r\nmortality during pregnancy, parturition, and the puerperium. According\r\nto _Hegar_, adding deaths resulting from premature delivery to deaths\r\nresulting from delivery at full term, we find the mortality of\r\nchildbirth in Germany to be about 0.6 per cent.\r\n\r\nWhilst _Bertillon_ and _Simpson_ believe that the lower mortality of\r\nmarried women above forty years of age as compared with unmarried women\r\nat the same period of life is dependent upon the advantage to the former\r\nof the fulfilment of sexual functions, _Hegar_, on the contrary, gives\r\nanother explanation. He writes: “At the age of 40, the less powerful\r\nmarried women have already been weeded out. At first, owing to the\r\nselection exercised by marriage, the quality of the unmarried women was\r\ninferior to that of the married women; the former, however, have not\r\nbeen exposed to the dangers attendant on the reproductive process, and\r\nso have passed through the time during which the body possesses the\r\ngreatest elasticity; but in the years in which a decline in the vital\r\npowers naturally sets in, the originally inferior quality of the\r\nunmarried women is manifested by a comparatively higher mortality. Also\r\nwe have to take into account among the unmarried, the consequences of\r\nextra-marital sexual intercourse and of prostitution, and further the\r\nlack of a family, of the support furnished by husband and children.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to the far-reaching disturbances of health dependent on\r\nsexual activity at this period of life, there are the minor domestic\r\ntroubles by which woman is depressed and by which her powers are\r\nexhausted. The influence of these latter is admirably described by _G.\r\nvon Amyntor_: “How many millions of brave house-wives boil and scrub\r\naway their vital energy, their rosy cheeks, their merry dimples, in the\r\nperformance of their household duties, until they become wrinkled,\r\nworn-out, dried-up mummies. The ever-renewed question, ‘what must be\r\ncooked for dinner to-day,’ the perpetually recurring necessity for\r\nscouring and sweeping and dusting and washing-up—these are the continual\r\ndropping which slowly but surely wears away soul and body. * * * On the\r\nflaming altar on which the sauce-pan simmers, youth and simplicity,\r\nbeauty and good temper, are offered up; and who can recognize in the\r\nold, hollow-eyed cook whose back is bent with toil and trouble, the once\r\nblooming, energetic, chastely coquettish bride adorned with her myrtle\r\ncrown?”\r\n\r\nA great number of the diseases of the female genital organs occurring at\r\nthe epoch of the menacme need only a passing mention. Even coitus, in\r\ncases in which there is great disproportion in size between the penis\r\nand the vaginal orifice, or when the organ is very rapidly introduced or\r\nthe act is very roughly performed, may lead to injury to the vulva or\r\nthe vagina, a fact to which a very large number of recorded cases bears\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\nDuring the acme of the sexual life of woman, disturbances of the\r\nmenstrual function are also frequent. Menstruation may cease in\r\nconsequence of intercurrent diseases or constitutional anomalies;\r\namenorrhœa may occur during the convalescence from acute diseases, in\r\nobese women, in those suffering from tuberculosis, diabetes, alcoholism,\r\nor psychoses. On the other hand, severe menorrhagia or atypical\r\nmetrorrhagia may occur, the bleeding either being due to diseases of the\r\nuterus, such as endometritis, retroflexion of the uterus, or uterine\r\nmyomata, or resulting from infectious diseases, disease of the heart or\r\nkidney, or from general disturbance of the health by chill or\r\nover-exertion. Or, again, dysmenorrhœa may arise, either as a symptom of\r\nsome local uterine disease or in consequence of external noxious\r\ninfluences or weakness of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nDuring the life-epoch of the menacme, moreover, disturbances of the\r\nnutrition of the uterus are of common occurrence, as, for example,\r\nhyperplastic processes in the mucous membrane of the cervical canal and\r\nof the cavity of the body of the uterus. Common also during the menacme\r\nis chronic oöphoritis, which may be due to mal-regulation of marital\r\nintercourse (especially to coitus too soon after childbirth), to\r\ncarelessness during menstruation (dancing, skating, or mountaineering),\r\nto incomplete coitus (_congressus interruptus_), and not infrequently,\r\nto gonococcal infection; or, finally, the oöphoritis may occur soon\r\nafter the puerperium in association with subinvolution of the uterus.\r\n\r\nNext we may mention inflammatory diseases of the Fallopian tubes. In the\r\netiology of these diseases in latter-day marriage, a dominant rôle must\r\nbe assigned to the gonococcus; but they also arise in many cases from\r\nnutritive disturbances, infection (other than gonorrhœal), and\r\nindiscretions during menstruation. Pelvic peritonitis owns similar\r\ncausation.\r\n\r\nIn this phase of women’s life, the commonest new growths of the uterus,\r\nmyomata, also develop, most commonly between the ages of thirty-six and\r\nforty-five, and they occur in strikingly larger proportion in unmarried\r\nwomen; it is between the same ages also that cysto-adenomata of the\r\novaries are of commonest occurrence.\r\n\r\nSexual intercourse gives frequent opportunities for the introduction of\r\ninfective germs into the vagina, and for the origination of inflammatory\r\naffections of the mucous membrane (_colpitis_), the intensity of which\r\ndepends upon the species, the quantity, and the virulence of the germs\r\nin question, on the one hand, and upon the local and constitutional\r\npredisposition of the infected person, upon the other. Especially grave\r\nin its consequences is gonorrhœal infection transmitted by the male, for\r\nthis virus gives rise to a great variety of pathological processes in\r\nthe female genital organs. In the act of defloration, considerable\r\ninjuries are sometimes produced, and these readily supply a breach for\r\nthe invasion of infective organisms. The condition of passive hyperæmia\r\nthat occurs in the genital organs during pregnancy also provides a\r\nfavorable soil for their growth.\r\n\r\nGonorrhœal infection of young married women is so frequent and so\r\nserious an occurrence in the sexual life of woman, that it requires\r\nspecial consideration. The cases in which the man entering upon marriage\r\nis so unscrupulous and so brutal as to deflower his young wife and to\r\ncontinue copulating with her, while suffering himself from a quite\r\nrecent and active gonorrhœa, are on the whole rare. More common is it\r\nfor the bridegroom to believe himself completely cured of his previous\r\nclaps, and he is declared cured by his physician. The disease is,\r\nhowever, latent merely, the gonorrhœa has become chronic, the discharge\r\nis so slight that it is overlooked; but by the stimulation of the\r\nfrequent acts of coition usual in the early days of marriage, the\r\ndisease is lighted up afresh, the gonococci multiply quickly and\r\nintensely, the young wife is infected, and suffers from an acute\r\ngonorrhœa, which may often escape observation for a considerable period.\r\n\r\nIn a gonorrhœal marriage, one in which both husband and wife have\r\ngonococci in their genital organs, very diverse phenomena may be\r\nobserved and very various conditions may result. On this subject _M.\r\nRunge_ writes: “If the husband’s gonorrhœa is not cured, fresh, virulent\r\ncocci are repeatedly transmitted to the wife, in whom, therefore, the\r\ndisease often gets worse by distinct stages. If the wife undergoes\r\ntreatment, the effect in these circumstances will naturally be nil,\r\nsince the husband is always supplying fresh infection. On the other\r\nhand, the wife on her side returns the gonococci to her husband, and in\r\nthis way his gonorrhœa may undergo aggravation. If the husband is\r\ncompelled, by illness, for instance, or by absence, to abstain for a\r\nlong period from intercourse with his wife, the latter’s gonorrhœa may,\r\nin favorable circumstances, undergo alleviation and cure. It may happen,\r\nhowever, that in the husband, in consequence of sexual rest, the\r\ngonorrhœa becomes latent, and even entirely disappears, whilst the wife\r\nstill suffers from infection. If now, after long abstinence, the husband\r\nhas renewed intercourse with his wife, he may be reinfected, and suffer\r\nfrom an acute attack of gonorrhœa, though this is due to the descendants\r\nof the very gonococci that he himself sometime before conveyed to the\r\ngenital organs of his wife—he reinfects himself, as people say. Such\r\ncases have given rise to suspicions of unchastity on the part of the\r\nwife, when the husband is in actual fact enjoying his own work in a new\r\nedition. A further possibility is that both husband and wife have become\r\nhabituated to their own gonococcal interchange; that is to say, the\r\norganisms produce no notable effect in either. But if the wife in such a\r\ncondition receives the embraces of a lover, the latter may be infected\r\nwith an acute gonorrhœa—a fact that has long been known.”\r\n\r\nThe principal rôle in the etiology of the diseases of the female genital\r\norgans must be assigned to pregnancy and childbirth. Anæmic women\r\nreadily suffer during pregnancy from a further decrease in the\r\ncorpuscular richness of the blood; those affected with valvular\r\nincompetence find their troubles much aggravated by pregnancy; where the\r\nkidneys are in an irritable condition, pregnancy not infrequently\r\nresults in the onset of nephritis, those with disordered digestion often\r\nsuffer from increased disturbance of the functions of the stomach and\r\nthe intestinal tract; those with gall-stones are apt to suffer from\r\nexceptionally severe attacks of biliary colic, and acute yellow atrophy\r\nof the liver is especially apt to occur during pregnancy. In women in\r\nwhom dilatations of the veins already exist, very great increase of the\r\nenlargement is apt to occur during pregnancy; and in the same\r\ncircumstances, trifling telangiectases increase to extensive angiomata.\r\nEnlargements of the thyroid body undergo rapid increase during\r\npregnancy, so that they may attain threatening proportions. In women in\r\nwhom the abdominal walls are flaccid, the viscera may protrude during\r\npregnancy through the enlarged lacunæ, giving rise to herniæ. The great\r\nrelaxation of the peritoneal and other ligamentous attachments of the\r\ngreat abdominal glands, occurring during pregnancy and the puerperium\r\nresults in displacements of these organs; hepatoptosis (migrating or\r\nmovable liver), lienoptosis (splenoptosis or wandering spleen),\r\nnephroptosis (ren mobile, floating or movable kidney), and other\r\nvarieties of enteroptosis (splanchnoptosis, visceroptosis, or Glénard’s\r\ndisease). During pregnancy, previously sound teeth are apt to become\r\ncarious, and already existing caries rapidly advances. New growths of\r\nvarious kinds originate at this period, those previously present exhibit\r\nrapid increase; and relapse after operations for the extirpation of\r\nmalignant tumors is especially apt to occur. Even the bones are\r\nunfavorably influenced. A weakened nervous system is subject to a storm\r\nof changing nervous troubles, in some cases so severe as to lead to the\r\noutbreak of actual psychoses; while mental disorder already present\r\ntends, as a rule, to be seriously aggravated during pregnancy. In the\r\neyes, serious disorders may occur, such as retinitis, and atrophy of the\r\nchoroid with complete amaurosis. As regards the hearing, tinnitus aurium\r\nis not uncommon, and sometimes complete deafness occurs. Numerous\r\ndiseases of the skin are apt to occur during pregnancy; in addition to\r\nthe well-known pigmentation of the face, the areola mammæ, and other\r\nparts, we may have herpes, eczema, or pruritus.\r\n\r\nThe serious aggravation which pregnancy is liable to induce in many\r\ndisorders previously existent, is well known, and this exacerbation\r\nprovides in some cases an indication for the induction of artificial\r\nabortion. This necessity may arise in severe cases of renal, cardiac,\r\npulmonary, or hepatic disease, in progressive anæmia, severe\r\nosteomalacia, hæmophilia, and many other acute and chronic pathological\r\nstates, since, in exceptional cases, as pregnancy advances, the symptoms\r\nof any one of these diseases may become so threatening, that the\r\npatient’s life is either in immediate danger or is almost certain to be\r\nin danger within a very short space of time—this may occur, for\r\ninstance, in diabetes, struma (goitre), or certain nervous diseases,\r\nsuch as chorea, polyneuritis (multiple neuritis), or mental disorders.\r\nUndoubtedly, in this connection, as _W. A. Freund_ insists, it is not\r\nthe actual nature of the disease that is of decisive importance, but\r\nrather its intensity, and its influence on the health of the pregnant\r\nwomen; these circumstances, considered in relation to the resisting\r\npowers of the patient, must be determinative in the adoption of measures\r\nfor terminating the pregnancy. An indication for the induction of\r\nartificial abortion is generally furnished also by uncontrollable\r\nvomiting dependent on pregnancy and endangering the life of the patient;\r\nirreducible incarceration of a retroflexed gravid uterus in the pouch of\r\nDouglas, or of a gravid uterus in a hernia, or irreducible prolapse of a\r\ngravid uterus will also necessitate abortion.\r\n\r\n_W. A. Freund_ gives an example of a common pathological state, usually\r\nquite free from danger, but now and again, when associated with\r\npregnancy, seriously endangering life and rendering the induction of\r\nartificial abortion absolutely necessary—this is acute _struma\r\nvasculosa_—(vascular enlargement of the thyroid body), which may during\r\nthe first three months of pregnancy exhibit such rapid growth as to lead\r\nto severe orthopnœa and cyanosis and so to imperil the patient’s life.\r\n\r\nIn cases in which laryngeal tuberculosis exists as a complication of\r\npulmonary tuberculosis, the former disease sometimes progresses so\r\nrapidly in the course of pregnancy that sudden death from œdema of the\r\nglottis is by no means rare. _Freund_, therefore, sees in this\r\ncomplication an absolute indication for the artificial termination of\r\nthe pregnancy.\r\n\r\nIn cases of previously well-compensated valvular lesions of the heart,\r\ndisturbances of compensation not infrequently occur as a result of\r\npregnancy; whilst in cases in which cyanosis, dyspnœa, albuminuria, and\r\ndropsy existed even before pregnancy, the latter condition is likely to\r\nresult in an aggravation of these symptoms to a degree that imperils\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nParturition, to an even greater extent than pregnancy, may induce\r\nserious injuries to the female organism. Thus, during parturition,\r\nlacerations of the vagina are frequent, with consequent scar-formation\r\nand stenosis; lacerations of the perineum are also common, causing great\r\ninconvenience, and when complete, leading to incontinence of fæces with\r\nall its unpleasant consequences. Great is the danger arising from septic\r\npuerperal inflammations, such as pelvic peritonitis (perimetritis);\r\nserious are the results of puerperal vesico-vaginal and recto-vaginal\r\nfistulæ.\r\n\r\nA large part in the local pathology of the female genital organs is\r\nplayed by the various displacements of the uterus, either arising in\r\nconsequence of inflammatory processes in their ligaments, or dependent\r\nupon relaxation of these ligaments from subinvolution of the internal\r\ngenerative organs, either following delivery at full term or following\r\nabortion.\r\n\r\nThe injury which women alike of the well-to-do and of the laboring\r\nclasses suffer in consequence of numerous and frequently repeated\r\npregnancies, is minutely described by _Hegar_. “We can,” he writes,\r\n“calculate the danger to life to which such an unfortunate woman is\r\nexposed by the act of reproduction. If we assume the ordinary mortality\r\nof women in childbed to be 6 per mille, then, in a woman who within 15\r\nyears has been delivered 16 times (whether prematurely or at full term),\r\nthe danger will be 16 times as great as that of a single delivery, and\r\nthe mortality will be 6 × 16 = 96 per mille; that is to say, of 1,000\r\nwomen who have all been pregnant that number of times, 96 will\r\ndie—nearly 1 in 10. Moreover, in this calculation the increased danger\r\nconsequent upon the unusually rapid sequence of the deliveries has not\r\nbeen taken into consideration. And, again, only the immediate results of\r\nthe deliveries have been taken into the account. Not infrequently women\r\nsuccumb at a later date to illnesses acquired in childbed; whilst\r\nothers, in consequence of repeated pregnancies, have their powers of\r\nresistance so greatly diminished, that they are unequal to the contest\r\nwith incidental diseases. In any case, a woman who has experienced\r\nnumerous and rapidly successive pregnancies, has sustained damages which\r\nwill endure for the rest of her life. Her tissues have lost their\r\nelasticity, the abdominal walls are flaccid, the abdomen is prominent,\r\nthe abdominal viscera are displaced, the vessels dilated, the\r\nreproductive organs in a state of subinvolution, and are the seat of\r\nstructural alterations. The greatest dangers arise in cases in which the\r\npregnancies are consequences that have to be paid for illicit love,\r\nsince in such cases syphilitic and gonorrhœal infection are\r\nexceptionally common. These complications, indeed, are not excluded in\r\nthe case of married women, since marital infidelities occur, and, again,\r\na premarital but not completely cured venereal illness may bear fruit in\r\nmarriage, the latter occurrence being almost always attributable to the\r\nhusband. Syphilitic or gonorrhœal infection may also arise in some other\r\nway than by copulation, and to this women are more exposed than men,\r\nowing to the greater size of the genital passage in the former.”\r\n\r\nVery numerous are the disorders of the nervous system referable to the\r\nsexual functional activity of woman during this epoch of her sexual\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n_Freund_, in his description of a neurasthenic symptom-complex to which\r\nhe gives the name of _angst-neurosis_,[36] maintains that the cause of\r\nthese attacks of anxiety[36] is very frequently to be found in a number\r\nof injurious influences in the sphere of the sexual life. In women,\r\nthese anxiety-neuroses occur:\r\n\r\n_a_) As virginal anxiety, or anxiety of adolescents. _Freund_ has\r\nobserved a number of unequivocal instances showing that a first\r\nencounter with the sexual problem, a rather sudden unveiling of what has\r\nhitherto been concealed, as, for instance, the sight of some sexual act,\r\nor something read or heard in conversation, may, in a girl at the time\r\nof puberty, give rise to an anxiety-neurosis, which is in a very typical\r\nmanner combined with hysteria.\r\n\r\n_b_) As anxiety of the newly married. Young wives who have been without\r\nsexual feeling in their first experience of intercourse are not\r\ninfrequently attacked by an anxiety-neurosis, which, however, disappears\r\nas soon as the sexual feeling becomes normal. Since, indeed, the\r\nmajority of young women who lack sexual feeling in their first\r\nexperience of sexual intercourse remain nevertheless quite healthy, it\r\nis evident that some other cause must coöperate in arousing the\r\nanxiety-neurosis.\r\n\r\n_c_) As anxiety in married women whose husbands suffer from _ejaculatio\r\npraecox_ or from great diminution of sexual potency, or\r\n\r\n_d_) Whose husbands practice _coitus interruptus_ or _coitus\r\nreservatus_. Cases in these two classes are closely associated, since it\r\nis easy to ascertain, from the analysis of a sufficiently large number\r\nof cases, that the really important question is, whether during coitus\r\nthe wife obtains or fails to obtain sexual satisfaction. In the latter\r\nevent, the condition requisite to arouse the anxiety-neurosis is\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\n_e_) As anxiety in widows and in voluntary abstinents, not infrequently\r\nin typical combination with impulsive ideas.\r\n\r\n_f_) As anxiety in the climacteric period, during the final flare-up of\r\nsexual passion.\r\n\r\nNumerous anomalies of the genital organs which gave rise in the virgin\r\nto no trouble whatever display their influence during the menacme by\r\nunfavorably affecting the nervous system. Thus, in cases of\r\nmalformations of the external organs of generation, slight atresia of\r\nthe vagina, a rudimentary condition of the vagina, a rigid hymen, or\r\nlocal changes in the vagina, it is only when sexual intercourse begins\r\nthat neuroses or hysteroneurasthenic troubles ensue. So also at times\r\nnervous diseases which, though the disposition to them was present, were\r\nlatent in the girl, such as epilepsy and various mental disorders, first\r\nbecome apparent in consequence of sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical irritation of the nerves of the pelvis that occurs in\r\nsexual intercourse may, even in women whose reproductive organs are\r\nhealthy, arouse sensations of weight, pressure, and bearing-down,\r\nvarious painful sensations in the sacral region, over the coccyx, in the\r\nbuttocks, or in the upper part of the thighs, and also “lumbar\r\nenlargement symptoms,”[37] viz., weakness of the lower extremities,\r\nabnormal sensations of fatigue in the lower extremities and the back,\r\nsometimes also disorders of micturition and defæcation.\r\n\r\nThroughout the manifold diseases of women in or connected with the\r\nreproductive system during the age of sexual maturity, associated mental\r\nprocesses take place, which powerfully affect the nervous system. Such\r\nprocesses are, melancholy and anxious thoughts concerning the possible\r\ninfluence of the illness on the happiness of married life, concerning\r\nchildlessness, or concerning loss of a husband’s sexual esteem, or\r\nagain, fear that the affection will become cancerous, fear of some\r\nnecessary operative procedure, or vexation in consequence of the\r\nlimitation of her usefulness as housewife, wife, and mother. Thus in\r\nwomen suffering from sexual affections, a state of general neurasthenia,\r\nor some neurasthenic functional disturbance of other organs, very\r\ncommonly arises.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge that she is suffering from an affection of the genital\r\norgans, makes a deep and lasting impression on the mind of a woman who\r\ntakes a serious view of her duties as a wife, and whose thoughts and\r\nfeelings are concentrated in the sexual sphere. The result is, that\r\nminor troubles are regarded through the magnifying lens of anxiety, and\r\nthe general sensibility is increased. This hyperæsthesia is not confined\r\nto the affected region, but manifests itself in various other parts of\r\nthe body by numerous phenomena of a reflex character. In the first place\r\nmust be mentioned severe headaches, sacrache, sensations of pressure in\r\nthe abdomen, cardiac troubles, palpitation, stomach-ache, nausea and\r\nretching and disorders of appetite and digestion. Capacity for work and\r\nthe enjoyment of life are destroyed by these disorders.\r\n\r\nWe have further to take into account the numerous conditions liable to\r\ndisturb the mind at this period of life. In childless women, we have the\r\nsubject of their sterility, the continued yearning to be blessed with\r\nchildren, the eager search for a remedy, and not rarely in these cases\r\nthe conflict between the reproductive impulse and the ethical principle\r\nof conjugal fidelity. In fruitful mothers, on the other hand, we have\r\nthe anxiety lest, by too frequent child-bearing their beauty should be\r\nimpaired and the livelihood of the family endangered; these\r\nconsiderations leading in many cases to the practice of _coitus\r\nreservatus_, with its deleterious physical and moral consequences. In\r\nthe middle and working classes, we have the strain of the endeavor to be\r\na helpful companion to the husband and at the same time to assist in the\r\nsupport and the education of the children. Last but not least, we have\r\nthe potent influence of local therapeutic measures, and the fear of\r\noperative procedures, both of which have a most agitating effect on a\r\nwoman’s mind. In truth, the menacme is a period full of stormy\r\nexcitations and powerful revolutions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its influence on the genital organs themselves, the\r\nsexual life of woman during the period of the menacme manifests its\r\npowers for evil especially in relation to the digestive functions, and\r\nto the functions of the heart and the nervous system.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the various consequences which may be induced in the\r\nprincipal organic systems as a result of functional disturbances and\r\norganic diseases of the female genital organs, we find that in respect\r\nof the frequency of their occurrence the diseases of the nervous system\r\noccupy the first rank; next in frequency come the disorders of the\r\ndigestive organs that arise in sympathetic association with diseases of\r\nthe female reproductive organs; whilst the third rank in respect of\r\nfrequency and importance is occupied by the cardiac disorders that arise\r\nin connection with changes in the female organs of generation, and take\r\nthe form either of disturbances of the heart’s functions or structural\r\nchanges in the heart’s muscle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Dyspepsia Uterina._\r\n\r\nAlthough it has long been a familiar observation that pregnant women and\r\nwomen suffering from diseases of the reproductive organs suffered from\r\nvarious dyspeptic troubles, I was myself the first (in the _Berliner\r\nKlinische Wochenschrift_, 1883) to bring together, and to describe under\r\nthe name of _dyspepsia uterina_, a peculiar group of dyspeptic\r\nconditions which are dependent upon diseases of the female reproductive\r\norgans. I dismissed from consideration organic diseases of the stomach\r\nand intestine dependent upon anatomical changes in these organs, even\r\nthough these also might owe a similar etiology, and described only the\r\nmore frequent dyspepsias occurring without organic change in the\r\ndigestive apparatus, the origin of which is to be explained by the fact\r\nthat certain structural changes and displacements of the uterus (to be\r\ndiscussed later) arouse centripetal impulses, and that these exercise a\r\nreflex influence on digestive activity.\r\n\r\nThis influence, according to my observations, affects the secretory and\r\nmuscular apparatus and also the nervous elements of the digestive tract,\r\nand I regard the following conditions as characteristic of uterine\r\ndyspepsia, though they do not necessarily all occur simultaneously:\r\nchanges in the gastric secretion, excitement of the vomiting centre, an\r\ninhibitory influence on intestinal peristalsis, and hyperæsthesia of the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of uterine dyspepsia may vary greatly in intensity, but not\r\ninfrequently become so severe as to disturb very seriously the general\r\nhealth of the woman so affected. They may be enumerated as follows: The\r\nappetite in uterine dyspepsia is variable, but is generally good; the\r\ntongue is not usually coated to any great extent, nor does the mucous\r\nmembrane of the mouth commonly exhibit any notable change; pain in the\r\nepigastrium is common after meals, with acid eructations and heartburn\r\n(pyrosis);[38] sometimes there is violent vomiting, occurring after\r\nevery meal, or in the morning on an empty stomach; in addition,\r\nconstipation is an almost constant symptom, associated with excessive\r\ndevelopment of gases in the intestinal canal. The pain is usually dull\r\nin character, and somewhat relieved by pressure, but it may be severe\r\nand lancinating, and may shoot along the intercostal spaces. The\r\naccumulation of flatus within the abdomen gives rise to various painful\r\nsensations, distension, a sense of fulness; and its expulsion is\r\nattended with notable relief.\r\n\r\nAs regards the composition of the gastric secretion, an increase of\r\nacidity is sometimes noticed. Gastric digestion is retarded;\r\nexperimental evacuation of the stomach, after a simple test meal\r\n(beefsteak and roll) showed that small quantities of undigested remnants\r\nwere to be found in the stomach as long as seven or eight hours\r\nafterwards. The frequent eructations evacuate flatus, or else a watery\r\nfluid with an acid reaction (_pyrosis_ or _water-brash_—see note 38). By\r\nthe act of vomiting, larger or smaller masses of the food that has been\r\ntaken are evacuated; in the vomit, sarcinæ in large numbers may\r\nfrequently be detected by the microscope. Constipation is present in\r\nnearly all cases of uterine dyspepsia; and even in cases in which\r\nattacks of diarrhœa occur from time to time, careful examination will\r\nshow that these are generally transient, being sequelæ of constipation\r\ndue to the irritation caused by the accumulated masses. In one case of\r\nlong-standing uterine dyspepsia, I observed, in the absence of any\r\ngastric dilatation, the well-known phenomenon of “peristaltic\r\nrestlessness of the stomach” (_tormina ventriculi nervosa_), in which\r\nthe peristaltic activity of the stomach is greatly exalted, and becomes\r\nvisible to the naked eye in the form of large and powerful undulations\r\nin the gastric region, moving from left to right.\r\n\r\nWith these symptoms affecting the digestive organs are associated\r\nvariable nervous manifestations in different organs, such as neuralgia\r\nof various nerves, palpitation of the heart, vertigo, headache, and\r\nnervous asthma. The general nutrition of the body often suffers\r\nconsiderably in cases of long-enduring uterine dyspepsia; excessive\r\nemaciation and general marasmus may ensue; we see also mental\r\ndepression, melancholia, an irritable disposition, and disinclination\r\nfor every kind of work.\r\n\r\nVery important, but very difficult, is the differential diagnosis\r\nbetween uterine dyspepsia, on the one hand, and, on the other, chronic\r\ngastric catarrh, chronic ulcer of the stomach, nervous dyspepsia, and\r\nsometimes even carcinoma of the stomach.\r\n\r\nAs regards the distinction from chronic gastric catarrh, in this latter\r\ndisease loss of appetite and changes in the oral mucous membrane are\r\nprominent symptoms; the vomit also usually contains much mucus. More\r\ndifficult is the differential diagnosis of chronic ulcer of the stomach,\r\nin cases in which anæmic subjects complain of anomalies of menstruation,\r\nassociated with dyspeptic troubles and cardialgia. In severe cases of\r\nuterine dyspepsia, the distinction from carcinoma of the stomach may be\r\nvery difficult—at any rate in cases in which no examination of the\r\ngenital organs has been made. Obstinate dyspeptic troubles, resisting\r\nall curative measures (unless indeed these are directed to the relief of\r\nthe local disorder of the reproductive organs), progressive anæmia,\r\ngreat emaciation, and pains localized in the stomach, are all conditions\r\ncommon to both of these maladies. The absence of a tumor of the stomach,\r\ncareful examination of the vomit, and examination of the genital organs,\r\nwill lead to a correct diagnosis if the case is one of uterine\r\ndyspepsia. A superficial investigation is exceedingly likely to result\r\nin a case of uterine dyspepsia being regarded as one of nervous\r\ndyspepsia (_von Leube_); none the less, even though a very close\r\nresemblance exists between the symptoms of the two diseases, to\r\ndifferentiate them is a matter of importance. In nervous dyspepsia, the\r\nact of digestion influences the nervous system in such a manner that,\r\neven when the chemical processes are normal, the organism as a whole is\r\nsympathetically affected by a reflex from the stimulation of the nerves\r\nof the stomach, and in return reacts on the mechanical process of\r\ndigestion in a more or less violent manner. In uterine dyspepsia,\r\nhowever, the relationship that obtains is exactly the reverse of this,\r\ninasmuch as the gastric activity is influenced by the nervous system, by\r\nreflex impulses originating in the morbid processes in the reproductive\r\norgans; moreover, in this form of dyspepsia, in direct contrast with\r\nnervous dyspepsia, the chemistry of digestion is often disordered, and,\r\nin addition, the process is not completed within the normal period.\r\n\r\nOftentimes, the diagnosis of uterine dyspepsia can be made with\r\ncertainty only _ex juvantibus_.[39] For this disorder cannot be cured\r\nunless the disease of the reproductive organs on which it depends is\r\nfirst relieved; and, conversely, local measures for the relief of\r\nuterine disease, will often at once remove all the dyspeptic troubles\r\nfrom which the patient suffers.\r\n\r\nMy own experience has led me to conclude that it is certain distinct\r\nlocal mechanical stimuli affecting the female genital organs which,\r\nacting for a long period on the sensory nerves of the uterus or its\r\nannexa, induce by reflex action the before-mentioned digestive\r\ndisturbances. Diseases of the vulva and the vagina, catarrhal\r\ninflammation, colpitis and leucorrhœa, and prolapse of the vagina, do\r\nnot by themselves lead to the occurrence of uterine dyspepsia; nor do\r\ninflammations of the uterine mucous membrane, such as endometritis\r\n(unless associated with parenchymatous changes of the whole uterus),\r\nchronic catarrh of the mucous membrane, erosion and ulceration of the\r\ncervix to an inconsiderable extent, or moderate perimetritic and\r\nparametritic exudations. On the other hand, uterine dyspepsia frequently\r\nensues in cases of uterine displacements, flexions, or versions, or in\r\ncases of structural changes of the uterus accompanied by enlargement of\r\nthe organ, chronic metritis, myomata, especially when intramural\r\n(interstitial), displacement of the Fallopian tubes and the ovaries,\r\nchronic oöphoritis, extensive inflammatory exudations, resulting from\r\npelvic peritonitis, and leading to dislocation, “compression” or\r\ndistortion of the uterus and its annexa, deep follicular or\r\ncarcinomatous ulceration of the cervix, or, finally, ovarian tumors. As\r\nthe commonest condition giving rise to dyspeptic disturbances of the\r\nkind under consideration, retroflexion of an enlarged uterus must be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of uterine dyspepsia, we may also classify dyspeptic\r\ndisturbances occurring at the time of puberty or of the menopause, and\r\nin association with certain amenorrhoeic and dysmenorrhœic conditions,\r\nand, in addition, the vomiting of pregnant women.\r\n\r\nThe vomiting of pregnant women, which must be regarded as a reflex\r\ndisturbance of the stomach, occurs, with especial severity in first\r\npregnancies, in the early months of pregnancy, with such regularity that\r\nit is regarded as one of the most typical signs of pregnancy. Thus, in\r\n177 pregnant women, _Horwitz_ observed vomiting in 147 (83 of whom were\r\nprimiparæ, and 64 multiparæ), and in 29 only was this symptom wanting.\r\nIn this series of cases, it most commonly made its appearance between\r\nthe tenth and eleventh week of the pregnancy. The vomiting of pregnant\r\nwomen occurs most commonly early in the morning, immediately after\r\nrising (morning sickness), but also at other times of the day; it\r\nusually takes place easily, without any great distress, and after it is\r\nover the patient feels quite comfortable. It rarely continues later than\r\nthe fourth month of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nVery serious in its effect on the general state of nutrition is the\r\nuncontrollable vomiting that sometimes occurs in pregnant women\r\n(_hyperemesis gravidarum_), lasting throughout the whole term of\r\npregnancy. It must be regarded as an exaggeration of the physiological\r\nvomiting of pregnant women, in patients whose nervous equilibrium is\r\nprofoundly disturbed; but equally with the ordinary “morning sickness”\r\nis it dependent on the reflex stimulation of the nerves of the stomach\r\nexercised by the growing uterus. One source of such stimulation may be\r\nfound in the stretching of the peritoneal investment of the uterus which\r\nresults from the enlargement of that organ; another, in certain\r\ndisplacements of the uterus; but in addition to these local anomalies,\r\nwe must assume the existence of a peculiar predisposition on the part of\r\nthe nervous system, in virtue of which reflex irritability is increased,\r\nwhile the power of reflex inhibition is diminished.\r\n\r\nThe prognosis and treatment of uterine dyspepsia depend chiefly upon the\r\nnature of the diseases of the female genital organs that have given rise\r\nto the disturbances of digestion, and this pathological relationship\r\ndemands above all a careful investigation. The following instance from\r\nmy own case-book may be regarded as typical of cases of this class. Mrs.\r\nN., aged 25, married 6 years, barren, complains of severe dyspeptic\r\ntrouble. Appetite fairly good, but after every meal severe gastralgia\r\noccurred, with heartburn and acid eructations, and very often the food\r\nwas rejected; there was also obstinate constipation, and great distress\r\nfrom the accumulation of flatus in the intestinal canal. No blood was\r\never seen in the vomit. The patient was much emaciated, and was greatly\r\ndepressed in spirits. Neither in the lungs nor in the digestive organs\r\nhad any of the physicians under whose care the lady had been for the\r\nlast four years found any abnormal change to account for the stormy\r\nmanifestations. Now, at length, the gynecological examination, which had\r\nhitherto been neglected, was undertaken. The uterus was found to be\r\nstrongly retroflexed and enlarged. Rectification of the position of this\r\norgan was immediately followed by the disappearance of all the stomach\r\ntroubles; the vomiting ceased, some months later the woman became\r\npregnant, and pregnancy and parturition were quite normal; since then\r\nthere has been no return of the dyspepsia.\r\n\r\nSince the appearance of my work on dyspepsia uterina, numerous\r\nobservations have in recent years been published, proving even more\r\nclearly the causal dependence of disturbances of the gastric function\r\nupon diseases of the female genital apparatus.\r\n\r\n_Lamy_, for example, has made an elaborate study of one of the\r\nabove-mentioned symptoms of uterine dyspepsia, namely, excitement of the\r\nvomiting centre. His conclusions are as follows: Among the general\r\nsymptoms of diseases of the uterus, dyspepsia, in all its forms and in\r\nall degrees of intensity, occupies the first rank in respect of\r\nfrequency of occurrence. Among the accompaniments of these reflex\r\nprocesses, uterine vomiting must be mentioned. It seldom occurs as the\r\nsole symptom of disorder of the digestive organs; but when it does occur\r\nalone, it is of great importance that the cause of the affection should\r\nnot be misunderstood. Diseases of the uterus and periuterine affections\r\nare the conditions that most commonly give rise to this trouble, but in\r\na certain number of cases it is due to physiological changes in the\r\nfemale genital organs. Such changes are those associated with the\r\nfunctional activity of the reproductive apparatus at the time of\r\npuberty, during menstruation, in connection with coitus, during\r\npregnancy, and at the change of life, the menopause. The vomiting of\r\npregnant women is of the same nature, and confirms our belief in the\r\nuterine origin and pathogenesis of vomiting at other times than during\r\npregnancy. The diagnosis of the true cause of uterine vomiting cannot be\r\nmade from the nature of the latter, but only from a knowledge of the\r\nconditions in which it occurs, just as with other uterine reflexes, such\r\nas neuralgia or cough. The vomit may consist merely of the food last\r\ntaken, or it may contain bile, without the presence of this latter\r\nconstituent indicating the existence of any disease of the liver. The\r\ntreatment of this disorder, which indeed does not threaten life, but\r\ndoes seriously impair the general state of nutrition, must be local,\r\ndirected against the disease of the genital organs: Thus, in one case of\r\nthis nature, a cure was effected by oöphorectomy.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the women in whom _Lamy_ observed this symptom of\r\nuterine dyspepsia were chloro-anæmic individuals with an irritable\r\nnervous system, town-dwellers, young girls in whom frequent evening\r\nparties and dances, ill-chosen diet, and a generally unsuitable mode of\r\nlife, had led to the development of a “virginal metritis.” The signs of\r\nthe disturbance of the gastric functions were in the first place a\r\nretardation of gastric digestion while the appetite remained good.\r\nMoreover, the stomach was often distended with flatus, and this caused\r\nfrequent gaseous eructations; there was also epigastric pain, which made\r\nit difficult for the patient to bear the pressure of the clothing, and\r\nsometimes great pain was aroused by the slightest contact. The attacks\r\nof vomiting, which occurred in a characteristic manner with periodical\r\nintervals of freedom, were usually preceded for a longer or shorter\r\nperiod by dyspeptic symptoms. The vomiting itself, if it occurred\r\nimmediately after a meal, was not accompanied by nausea, a feeling of\r\nfaintness, or cold sweats, but rather resembled a kind of painless\r\nregurgitation; but when the vomiting did not occur till some hours after\r\nfood had been taken, it was painful, and the vomit was then green-tinted\r\nowing to the admixture of bile.\r\n\r\nThe gastric troubles that occur during menstruation are regarded by _P.\r\nMüller_ as a further indication of the intimate connection between the\r\ngenital organs and the digestive tract. In women who suffer from\r\nhysterical manifestations, gastric disturbances, cardialgia, and nervous\r\ndyspepsia, are very frequently associated with menstruation. These\r\ngastric symptoms generally make their appearance a few days before\r\nmenstruation is due, and disappear as soon as the flow is established.\r\nIn other forms, again, the digestive troubles set in with the appearance\r\nof the flow, to disappear during the later course of menstruation; and\r\nin yet other cases the gastric disturbance begins even later, and ceases\r\nonly when the flow comes to an end. These symptoms may occur in women in\r\nwhom the genital organs are perfectly healthy and in whom menstruation\r\nruns a regular course. More severe symptoms may, however, appear if\r\nmenstruation is disturbed for any reason, or if it is suppressed. Not\r\nrarely such women, when they become pregnant, suffer, especially during\r\nthe early months, from dyspeptic symptoms; but similar dyspepsia may\r\noccur in pregnant women who have previously been quite healthy.\r\n\r\nTo the same category belong the cases formerly described by _von Leyden_\r\nunder the designation of neuralgia and hyperæsthesia of the stomach,\r\nwhich he observed in young girls as a sequel of menstrual disturbances,\r\nand more particularly of _suppressio mensium_. In these circumstances,\r\nthe sensibility of the stomach may become so extreme that every time\r\nfood is taken the patient suffers from such severe pains, or from so\r\ndistressing a sense of anxiety and oppression, that she comes to eat\r\nless and less, and an extreme degree of emaciation and marasmus results.\r\nIn one such case, congenital atrophy of the uterus was discovered on\r\ngynecological examination.\r\n\r\nAccording to _R. Arndt_, it is especially in chloro-neurotic individuals\r\nthat the stimuli proceeding from morbid conditions of the reproductive\r\norgans frequently induce, by reflex action, all kinds of disturbances of\r\nthe alimentary tract, such as constipation and flatulence, gastric\r\nuneasiness and loss of appetite, weakness of digestion, cardialgia, and\r\nstricture of the œsophagus. Even simple menstruation suffices to give\r\nnumerous proofs of this fact, but still more do such consequences arise\r\nfrom serious diseases of the reproductive organs, such as changes in\r\nform, displacements, and inflammatory states, and also, on the other\r\nhand, more or less pronounced hypoplasia.\r\n\r\n_G. Braun_ has published three cases illustrating the connection between\r\nneurosis of the stomach and uterine disorders. In the first of these\r\ncases, severe digestive disturbances occurred after every meal, with\r\noccasionally violent vomiting, in a woman, aged twenty-five years. No\r\nchanges were found in the stomach or other digestive organs, and the\r\nsymptoms obstinately resisted all direct treatment. Gynecological\r\nexamination showed extreme mobility of the uterus, and for the relief of\r\nthis a suitable pessary was introduced. The vomiting thereupon\r\nimmediately ceased, all the other digestive troubles passed completely\r\naway, and the general state of nutrition, which had before been so much\r\nimpaired as to necessitate the use of nutrient enemata of meat-solution,\r\nnow became normal. The second case was that of a woman aged thirty, who,\r\nsince her last confinement two years before, had continually suffered\r\nfrom disagreeable gastric sensations and from vomiting, which latter had\r\nproved quite uncontrollable. Gynecological examination disclosed\r\nextensive laceration of the cervix with ectropium of the mucous\r\nmembrane. An operation was performed for the relief of this condition,\r\nand the vomiting of two years standing was also thereby cured. In the\r\nthird case, that of a woman twenty-eight years old, vomiting began three\r\nmonths after her confinement, and recurred whenever the patient left the\r\nrecumbent posture, in which latter she felt quite well. On local\r\nexamination, the uterus was found to be prolapsed, the vaginal portion\r\nof the cervix moderately enlarged and just within the vaginal orifice.\r\nAmputation of the vaginal portion of the cervix cured the vomiting and\r\ncompletely restored the patient’s health.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of gastric affections in cases of retroflexion of the\r\nuterus is insisted on by _Panecki_. In eight instances he found neuroses\r\nof the stomach consequent upon such retroflexion, and in all cases a\r\ncure immediately followed rectification of the position of the uterus.\r\nHe urges that if after the reposition of the retroflexed uterus the\r\ngastric troubles should still persist, a careful local examination of\r\nthe stomach is indispensable.\r\n\r\n_Eisenhart_, in a woman forty-two years of age, corrected a mobile\r\nretroflexion of the uterus, and thereupon very severe gastric symptoms\r\nof several months’ duration soon disappeared. _Graily-Hewitt_, in an\r\nunmarried woman twenty-seven years of age, cured by reposition of a\r\nretroflexed uterus a gastric disorder which had subsisted for nine\r\nyears; _Elder_ and _Henrik_ report identical results in gastric troubles\r\nconsequent on retroflexion or retroversion of the uterus. _Jaffé_, in a\r\nvirgin, aged twenty-three, who had been brought near to death by gastric\r\ndisorder with vomiting, found on local examination that there was a\r\nprofuse, thick, purulent discharge from the interior of the uterus;\r\ncuretting, and irrigation of the uterine cavity with antiseptic\r\nsolutions, gave immediate relief to the stomach trouble. Similar\r\nexperiences are recorded by _C. van Tussenbeck_ and _Mendes de Leon_ in\r\ncases of gastric disorder consequent on _endometritis fungosa_ and\r\n_endometritis interstitialis parenchymatosa_; and by _Gottschalk_, in\r\ncases consequent on sarcoma of the chorionic villi. _Lewy_ and\r\n_Butler-Smythe_ have observed the relief of pernicious vomiting by\r\n_Emmet’s_ operation (trachelorraphy).\r\n\r\nAs regards the relations of gastro-intestinal affections to the diseases\r\nof the reproductive organs, _Theilhaber_, in the cases observed by\r\nhimself, distinguishes three groups. In the first group of cases, the\r\ngynecological abnormality was a chance accessory, and was not the cause\r\nof the gastric trouble. In the second group, he regards the\r\ngynecological trouble as dependent upon the affection of the\r\ngastro-intestinal tract, believing that, in consequence of atony of the\r\nintestine and an accumulation therein of fæces and flatus, a retardation\r\nof the circulation occurs in the region of the inferior vena cava,\r\nresulting in venous stasis in the uterus, and so giving rise to\r\nmetrorrhagia, dysmenorrhœa, and fluor albus. In the third group of\r\ncases, _Theilhaber_ believes that the uterine trouble is the cause of\r\nthe disturbances in the stomach and intestine. He, like myself, has\r\nfound in all these patients an inhibition of the intestinal movements;\r\nbut he found, on the other hand, that the gastric secretions were more\r\ncommonly normal, and that only in a small proportion of the cases was\r\nthe vomiting centre excited. Further, in the majority of these women,\r\nthe course of the digestive processes was quite normal; and, finally, in\r\nhis series of cases, endometritis was one of the commonest causes of\r\nconsecutive gastric disorders. His observations led him to conclude that\r\n“in consequence of affections of the uterus a large number of different\r\nsymptom-complexes of gastric trouble occur:” the pure nervous dyspepsia\r\nof Leube, dependent on atony of the large intestine and atony of the\r\nstomach, hyperchlorhydria and anacidity, periodic gastralgia without\r\nanatomical cause, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Cardiopathia Uterina._\r\n\r\nI use the term _cardiopathia uterina_ to denote the manifold cardiac\r\ndisorders which occur in women as reflex processes excited by the\r\nphysiological functions and the pathological disorders of the genital\r\norgans, and take the form of very various disturbances of the cardiac\r\nfunction. Every phase of the sexual life of women—that in which the\r\nreproductive organs attain complete development and menstruation first\r\nappears (the menarche); the commencement of sexual intercourse;\r\npregnancy, parturition, and the puerperium; finally the retrogressive\r\nprocess at the climacteric age, of which the menopause is the outward\r\nmanifestation—may give rise to the occurrence of such cardiac troubles.\r\nIn order to explain these troubles as reflex in their nature, we must on\r\nthe one hand recur to the anatomical changes in the uterus and its\r\nannexa that take place in every one of the above-mentioned phases of the\r\nsexual life; and on the other hand we must take into consideration the\r\nmental processes that accompany these anatomical changes, in order to\r\nestimate their influence upon the motor and sensory nerves of the heart\r\n(see the sections on the _Menarche_ and the _Menopause_).\r\n\r\nA certain predisposition to uterine cardiopathy exists in many\r\nindividuals and in many families. This predisposition may be manifested\r\nin this way, that in women who at the time of the menarche have suffered\r\nfrom cardiac disorder, similar cardiac disorder is likely to recur at\r\nthe time of the menopause, the symptoms of the recurrent attack being in\r\nmost cases identical with those that occurred during the menarche. In\r\nthe well-to-do and cultured circles of society, uterine cardiopathy is\r\nfar more frequently encountered than among the working classes. Both\r\nunusually early and unusually late commencement of menstruation tend to\r\nfavor the occurrence of uterine cardiopathy. The most valuable\r\ntherapeutic measures that we can employ to combat these disorders are\r\nsuitable dietetic and hygienic regulations, in association with\r\nfavorable mental influences.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the female reproductive organs, including simple functional\r\ndisturbances, are very frequently accompanied—far more frequently than\r\nhas hitherto been supposed—by cardiac disorders. But whereas in some\r\ncases these cardiac disorders are directly dependent upon the disease of\r\nthe genital organs; in other cases no such etiological relationship can\r\nbe shown to exist, and the association must, therefore, be regarded as\r\nfortuitous.\r\n\r\nIn cases of the former kind, the dependence of the cardiac disorder upon\r\nthe disease of the genital organs is very variable in its nature.\r\n\r\nReflex manifestations on the part of the nervous system may be aroused\r\nby pathological changes in the genital organs, in a manner similar to\r\nthat discussed in other parts of this work in regard to the cardiac\r\ntroubles that are liable to occur during the menarche and the menopause;\r\nsuch cardiac disorders are indeed excited especially by changes in the\r\novaries, by disturbances of menstrual activity, by suppression of the\r\nmenses—as manifestations, that is to say, of the menstrual reflex. The\r\ncardiac disorder most commonly takes the form of tachycardiac paroxysms,\r\nrecurring periodically, either in association with the menstrual flow,\r\nor, if this is in abeyance, at the times at which it ought to appear. We\r\nmust assume in these cases that the local stimuli aroused by the\r\npathological changes in the uterus and the ovaries have a reflex\r\ninfluence upon the cardiac nerves, by means of which the heart’s action\r\nis increased in frequency, without inquiring more particularly whether\r\nthe reflex influence is effective by inhibiting the normal action of the\r\nvagus, or by stimulating the sympathetic, or, perhaps, by a combination\r\nof these factors. Much more rarely do we notice, in association with\r\ndisorders of the reproductive system, a reflex decrease in the frequency\r\nof the heart’s action, this effect being explicable in the same manner\r\nas the well-known experiment of _Golz_, in which, if the abdomen of a\r\nfrog be laid bare, and the intestine be struck sharply with the handle\r\nof a scalpel, the heart will stand still in diastole with all the\r\nphenomena of vagus inhibition.\r\n\r\nIn another group of diseases of the genital organs, the disturbances of\r\ncardiac activity may be brought about by pressure which, in consequence\r\nof the morbid processes in the reproductive organs, is exercised upon\r\nindividual nerves or upon an entire nerve plexus. Tumefied and prolapsed\r\novaries, an enlarged and misplaced uterus, inflammatory nodules and\r\nhyperplasias of the intrapelvic connective tissue, contractile processes\r\nin the parametric connective tissue,[40] tumors of the uterus whether\r\nintramural or in the interior of that organ, ovarian tumors, prolapse of\r\nthe uterus, and intrapelvic peritoneal adhesions resulting from\r\ninflammatory processes—these are the principal conditions liable to\r\noccasion reflex cardiac disorder; but certain tissue changes, such as\r\nendometritis, erosions (chronic cervical catarrh), and ulcerations of\r\nthe genital passages, with or without exposure of nerve-endings, are\r\nalso competent to produce the same effect. Here the sympathetic nervous\r\nsystem constitutes the channel by means of which the stimuli affecting\r\nthe nerves of the genital organs are conveyed to the central nervous\r\nsystem, and by means of which also the reflex manifestations of this\r\nstimulation are produced, taking the form, partly of disorder of the\r\ncardiac action, of palpitation of the heart and paroxysmal tachycardia,\r\nand partly of pains in the cardiac region and disturbances along the\r\ncourse of the great vessels.\r\n\r\nFurther, in cases of long-continued disease of the female genital organs\r\nassociated with severe hæmorrhage and in some cases fluor albus,\r\nnutrition in general and hæmotopoiesis may be seriously affected, and\r\ndisturbances of cardiac activity may result, as, for instance, is\r\nfrequently witnessed in chloro-anæmic states. In such cases we have\r\npalpitation of the heart, both subjective and objective, a weak and\r\ncompressible pulse, often irregularity of the heart’s action, singularly\r\nclear heart sounds, often, however, systolic murmurs at various\r\norifices, increased frequency of heart and respiration to a\r\ndisproportionate degree on slight exertion, strong pulsation of the\r\ncarotids, and slight œdema of the ankles.\r\n\r\nOften, however, the disturbance of cardiac activity is dependent also\r\nupon degenerative processes in the myocardium, upon fatty degeneration\r\nand the consequent dilatation of the cavities, this degeneration being a\r\nconsequence of the growth of a uterine tumor and especially of uterine\r\nmyomata, or resulting from some constitutional disorder which is itself\r\ndependent upon the affection of the genital organs. In such cases the\r\nsigns of degeneration of the heart are very striking: weakening of the\r\ncardiac impulse, notable faintness of the sounds of the heart,\r\noccasionally reduplication of the second sound, a galloping rhythm,\r\nwhile percussion shows the existence of considerable dilatation of the\r\nleft, and still more frequently of the right ventricle; in many cases\r\nalso we have angina pectoris, passive hyperæmia of the lungs, the mucous\r\nmembranes, and the extremities; and sudden death sometimes ensues.\r\n\r\nNo less important are the mental influences exercised by diseases of the\r\ngenital organs in which operation is proposed or actually performed,\r\nalso by long-lasting diseases of the reproductive organs and by the\r\ndisturbances these diseases produce in the reproductive functions, more\r\nespecially in relation to copulation and the actual process of\r\nreproduction. In this way cardiac neuroses of various kinds may be\r\ninduced.\r\n\r\nFinally, cases have come under my notice in which the cardiac trouble\r\nwas not the direct result of the disease of the genital organs, but was\r\na consequence of the therapeutic measures employed for the relief of the\r\nlatter; and in this connection I must regard as especially blameworthy,\r\nin addition to intra-uterine manipulations, such as sounding and\r\ncauterization, the modern practice of gynecological massage.\r\n\r\nNot all diseases, however, of the female reproductive apparatus, tend in\r\na similar manner and with equal frequency to give rise to consecutive\r\ncardiac disorders. According to my own observations, the diseases of the\r\nvulva and the vagina, catarrhal inflammation, colpitis (vaginitis),\r\nleucorrhœa, and prolapse of the vagina (cystocele and rectocele), are\r\nthose which most rarely induce cardiopathy; unless, indeed, the diseases\r\njust enumerated have led to the occurrence of vaginismus, for in this\r\nlatter condition cardiac trouble not uncommonly ensues. More commonly\r\nthan by vulval and vaginal diseases, cardiac troubles are induced by\r\ninflammation of the uterine mucous membrane, as by chronic endometritis,\r\nby erosion and “ulceration” of the cervix (chronic cervical catarrh);\r\nthey also sometimes occur in connection with perimetritic and\r\nparametritic exudations. Most frequently of all, and most severely,\r\ncardiac disorders are aroused by displacements of the uterus, flexions\r\nor versions; by structural changes of the uterus accompanied by\r\nenlargement of that organ, such as chronic metritis and the growth of\r\nmyomata (especially intramural); by prolapse, enlargement, and tumor of\r\nthe ovary; by intrapelvic exudations which when extensive give rise to\r\ndisplacement or compression of the uterus or its annexa. In cases of\r\ncarcinomatous or other malignant new growths affecting the reproductive\r\norgans, I have in comparison very rarely observed the occurrence of\r\nreflex cardiac disorders.\r\n\r\nDisturbances of menstrual activity, amenorrhœa, menorrhagia, and\r\ndysmenorrhœa, owning the most varied causes, very frequently give rise\r\nto cardiac trouble, a point on which we have already insisted. (See page\r\n142, _et seq._)\r\n\r\nVery violent forms of cardiac neurosis have been observed by me in women\r\nsuffering from chronic disorder of the reproductive organs, who have\r\nconsulted one gynecologist after another and have been subjected to many\r\ndifferent methods of local treatment; also in women who have for a long\r\ntime suffered from some gynecological ailment hitherto believed to be\r\ntrifling, but who have at length suddenly been informed that some severe\r\noperative procedure has become necessary. In such cases the cardiac\r\ntrouble took a paroxysmal form, the intervals being usually\r\nconsiderable, several weeks or months in duration, and the general\r\nsystem was as a rule seriously involved in the attacks. These latter\r\nbegan with severe cardialgia, radiating from the cardiac region outward\r\nalong the intercostal spaces, upward to the shoulder and along the left\r\narm, sometimes indeed extending into both arms. At the same time the\r\nheart’s action was greatly increased in frequency, there being sometimes\r\nmore than 200 beats per minute, the pulse was soft, small, difficult to\r\ncount, the respiration greatly increased in frequency, sometimes very\r\nshallow, with respiratory anxiety, and exceptionally severe general\r\nexcitement and sense of impending death. In some cases also I observed\r\nspasm of various groups of muscles, dizziness (with a sense that the\r\nobjects of vision were flickering), aphasia, and mental stupor. The\r\nparoxysms lasted for some time, two or three hours, as a rule, and\r\ngradually passed away. Their character was that of the cardiac disorder\r\nvariously described under the names of pseudo-angina and angina pectoris\r\nhysteria.\r\n\r\nSuch attacks as these are followed by a sense of severe general\r\ndepression and want of energy, and by a decline in body-weight. They are\r\ndistinguished from true angina pectoris by the absence of any signs of\r\narteriosclerosis or of degeneration of the myocardium. They may be\r\nregarded as cardiac disorder of duplex causation, being partly dependent\r\non the disease of the genital organs, which gives rise to a number of\r\nlocal afferent stimuli, and partly dependent on mental influences which\r\nhave a depressant, paralyzing influence on the cardiac nerves; it is\r\npossible also that spasmodic contraction of the walls of the coronary\r\narteries or of the myocardium itself is induced as a reflex effect of\r\nthe local disorder of the reproductive organs.\r\n\r\nWith regard to uterine myoma as the exciting cause of cardiac\r\ndegeneration, very numerous observations and experiments have recently\r\nbeen made, and the reality of the occurrence is no longer open to\r\ndispute, even if its significance is subject to various interpretations,\r\nwhilst no satisfactory explanation has yet been forthcoming.\r\n\r\n_L. Landau_ writes concerning the disturbances induced in the\r\ncirculatory apparatus by the growth of myomata in the uterus: “The\r\nformation of varices, the occurrence of thrombosis, and, finally, the\r\nonset of degeneration of the myocardium, are very common. Should the\r\nlast-named process result—and it is truly alarming to observe the\r\nfrequency with which cardiac affections are associated with uterine\r\nmyomata,—then, by a vicious circle, the uterine hæmorrhages become\r\ncontinually more profuse, in consequence of increasing passive hyperæmia\r\ndependent upon diminishing power of the cardiac pump. Venous congestion\r\nin the province of the inferior vena cava results in ascites, and\r\nsometimes in general œdema; and even in cases in which no increase of\r\nthe uterine hæmorrhages is observed, the patient may succumb in\r\nconsequence of secondary disease of the heart. * * * In the great\r\nmajority of cases, the myoma and the uterine hæmorrhages that result\r\nfrom its growth are the primary cause of the morbus cordis. Naturally in\r\ncases which come under observation only when both uterine and cardiac\r\ndisease are already present, it is difficult to determine with certainty\r\nthe true causal connection. When, however, a number of patients\r\nsuffering from uterine myomata are observed, in whom at first the heart\r\nwas found to be healthy, and subsequently to have become affected; and\r\nwhen, on the other hand, we see patients affected with myoma uteri in\r\nwhom operation is undertaken notwithstanding the existence of cardiac\r\ndisease, and in whom, after the operation has been successfully\r\nperformed, the cardiac murmurs disappear as well also as the other signs\r\nof heart disease, when dilatation can no longer be detected, when the\r\npulse-frequency declines to normal, whilst a previously feeble and\r\ncompressible pulse gains in tension and power—then it is impossible to\r\ndoubt that the heart disease was secondary, and was etiologically\r\ndependent upon the primary myoma and the uterine hæmorrhages.”\r\n\r\n_Lehmann_ and _P. Strassmann_ examined the material of the\r\nCharité-Policlinik at Berlin in order to throw light on the relation\r\nbetween uterine myomata and diseases of the heart, a connection already\r\nproved to exist alike by recent pathologico-anatomical researches, by\r\nclinical experience of the results of operations (death from shock),\r\nand, finally, by the subjective troubles of the patients (palpitation,\r\nvenous congestion, giddiness, and syncope). Examining 71 women suffering\r\nfrom myoma uteri, _Lehmann_ and _Strassmann_ found in 29 (41%) that some\r\nabnormality existed in the cardio-vascular system, such abnormalities\r\nbeing extremely variable in character, as for instance: hypertrophy or\r\ndilatation of the heart, irregularity of the cardiac action, passive\r\nhyperaemias, œdema, albuminuria, angina pectoris, and cardiac asthma.\r\nThe next point was to determine the mutual relations between the heart\r\ndisease and the development of the uterine myoma. Hitherto it has been\r\nassumed that the latter is the primary disease, and such a sequence is\r\ncertainly the commoner, more especially in cases in which hæmorrhage has\r\nbeen profuse, with consecutive anæmia and fatty degeneration of the\r\nheart. In these cases, a certain time after the commencement of the\r\nsevere hæmorrhages, cardiac troubles make their appearance; such\r\ntroubles are beyond question secondary, and they disappear as soon as\r\nthe hæmorrhage has been controlled. In other patients, however, we\r\nobtain a history of the appearance of cardiac disorder at a date prior\r\nto that when any symptoms occurred indicating the growth of a myoma; in\r\nthese cases, therefore, the heart disease has developed independently of\r\nthe uterine disease, and has run a parallel course to the latter;\r\nperhaps, indeed, by leading to venous congestion or to rapid changes in\r\nblood-pressure, the heart disease may have favored the growth of the\r\ncommencing or fully developed tumor. In some of the patients, operative\r\nmeasures were followed by rapid recovery from the cardiac disorder\r\n(cases of simple anæmia); in a second group of cases, however, the heart\r\ndisease was uninfluenced by operation (cases of irreparable anæmia, and\r\ncases of heart disease independent of the myomata); and, finally, a\r\nconsiderable number of patients remained, constituting a third group, in\r\nwhom, notwithstanding the removal of the tumor by operation, the heart\r\ndisease continued to grow worse (cases of progressive heart disease\r\nindependent of the myomata, especially cases of arteriosclerosis).\r\n\r\nAmong 120 women of ages between 17 and 48, in whom I found very various\r\nfunctional disorders of or pathological changes in the genital organs,\r\nand in whom I made a particular investigation concerning the presence or\r\nabsence of heart disease and examined the heart carefully, I was able to\r\ndetect the presence of cardiac troubles in 38 instances. Thus, heart\r\ntrouble was found to exist in 32.7 per cent. of women suffering from\r\ndisease of the reproductive organs.\r\n\r\nIn these 38 persons suffering from cardiac disorder, I found:\r\n\r\n Nervous Tachycardia in 21 instances, that\r\n   is, in about                             55.2 per cent. of the cases.\r\n Hypertrophy of the Heart in 4 instances,\r\n   that is, in about                        10.4 per cent. of the cases.\r\n Pseudo-Angina Pectoris in 3 instances,\r\n   that is, in about                         7.8 per cent. of the cases.\r\n Asthenia Cordis in 7 instances, that is,\r\n   in about                                 18.4 per cent. of the cases.\r\n Mitral Incompetence in 1 instance, that\r\n   is, in about                              2.6 per cent. of the cases.\r\n Fatty Heart in 2 instances, that is, in\r\n   about                                     5.2 per cent. of the cases.\r\n\r\nAs regards the varieties of functional and organic disease of the\r\ngenitals met with in the 120 cases, and the number of instances\r\ncomplicated with heart trouble in each variety, I found:\r\n\r\n Chronic Metritis in 32 patients, complicated with cardiac\r\n   disorder in                                             13 instances.\r\n Chronic Oöphoritis in 10 patients, complicated with\r\n   cardiac disorder in                                      4 instances.\r\n Parametric Exudations in 14 patients, complicated with\r\n   cardiac disorder in                                      6 instances.\r\n Chronic Endometritis in 16 patients, complicated with\r\n   cardiac disorder in                                      2 instances.\r\n Flexions and Versions of the Uterus in 26 patients,\r\n   complicated with cardiac disorder in                     9 instances.\r\n Stenosis of the Cervix in 6 patients, complicated with\r\n   cardiac disorder in                                      0 instances.\r\n Tumors of the Uterus and its Annexa in 8 patients,\r\n   complicated with cardiac disorder in                     4 instances.\r\n Infantile Uterus in 3 patients, complicated with cardiac\r\n   disorder in                                              0 instances.\r\n Colpitis (Vaginitis) in 5 patients, complicated with\r\n   cardiac disorder in                                      0 instances.\r\n\r\nFrom these figures we obtain the following percentages, showing the\r\nfrequency with which heart trouble occurred as a complication of the\r\nrespective diseases of the genital organs:\r\n\r\n In Chronic Metritis, cardiac disorder was\r\n   found in                                 40.6 per cent. of the cases.\r\n In Chronic Oöphoritis, cardiac disorder\r\n   was found in                             40   per cent. of the cases.\r\n In Parametric Exudations, cardiac disorder\r\n   was found in                             42.8 per cent. of the cases.\r\n In Chronic Endometritis, cardiac disorder\r\n   was found in                             12.5 per cent. of the cases.\r\n In Versions and Flexions of the Uterus,\r\n   cardiac disorder was found in            34.6 per cent. of the cases.\r\n In Tumors of the Uterus and its Annexa,\r\n   cardiac disorder was found in            50   per cent. of the cases.\r\n\r\nTo summarize the result of my observations regarding the cardiac\r\ndisorders secondary to diseases of the female genital organs:\r\n\r\n1. Tachycardial paroxysms in cases of amenorrhœa were premenstrual in\r\nrhythm, the paroxysms occurred, that is to say, some days before the due\r\ndate of the suppressed flow.\r\n\r\n2. In cases of dysmenorrhœa, I observed heart trouble with severe\r\ndyspnœa and feelings of anxiety, also in some cases symptoms of cardiac\r\nasthenia; these symptoms were perhaps dependent upon acute dilatation of\r\nthe heart. The heart trouble associated with profuse menorrhagia\r\nexhibited similar characters.\r\n\r\n3. Attacks of pseudo-angina pectoris occurred in women in whom local\r\ntreatment for disease of the genital organs had been carried out for a\r\nlong time, and in cases in which operative measures were in\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\n4. Paroxysms of tachycardia and cardiac distress were observed in\r\nconnexion with displacements of the uterus, and especially in cases of\r\nretroflexion; also in association with oöphoritis and with parametric\r\nexudations.\r\n\r\n5. Cases of degeneration of the myocardium, sometimes running a rapidly\r\nfatal course, were found to be consecutive to tumors of the uterus and\r\nits annexa, especially to myomata of the uterus.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Nervous Diseases Secondary to Diseases of the Genital Organs._\r\n\r\nIn earlier chapters of this work we have frequently referred to the\r\nreflex influence exercised upon the nervous system in general, alike by\r\nthe normal functions and the pathological states of the female genital\r\norgans. We must now briefly explain the more intimate connection between\r\nnervous diseases and diseases of the genital organs, the causal\r\ndependence of local nervous disturbances and of general neuroses upon\r\ndiseases of the reproductive organs.\r\n\r\nThe origination of a local nervous disease by a primary disease of the\r\ngenital organs is dependent upon a simple mechanical process, which is\r\nexplained by _Windscheid_ in the following terms: “In this connection,\r\nthe two principal mechanical factors are pressure and traction. Pressure\r\nmay affect individual nerves or an entire nerve plexus, and may be\r\nexercised by a tumour, an exudation or a misplaced organ (_Hegar_);\r\nfurther causes of pressure are furnished by inflammatory nodules, by\r\nconnective tissue hyperplasias, and, according to _Freund_, by\r\ncontractile processes in the organs themselves and in the ligaments.\r\nTraction on the nerves results from displacements, as from prolapse of\r\nthe uterus or the ovaries, and, according to _Hegar_, from traction on\r\nthe pedicle of small tumours. A combination of pressure and traction\r\noccurs especially in affections of the abdominal attachments of the\r\nuterus, also where there is scarring of the neck of the uterus and of\r\nthe vaginal fornices. Great importance, also, in relation to the\r\nproduction of local nervous disorders, must be attributed to the laying\r\nbare of nerve-terminals by catarrhal and other inflammatory processes.\r\nAbnormal mobility of the genital organs as a partial manifestation of\r\nenteroptosis must also be mentioned as a cause of mechanical stimulation\r\nof the nerves. Finally, in this connection, must be considered the\r\nparesis of the abdominal walls that follows frequent and severe\r\nconfinements.”\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of the local nervous disorders to which these mechanical\r\nstimuli may give rise, are very various, but may, according to _Hegar_,\r\nbe comprised under the general designation of _lumbar enlargement\r\nsymptoms_ (_Lendenmarksymptome_), inasmuch as the local stimulation of\r\nthe intrapelvic nerves, affects the nerve-centres of the lumbar\r\nenlargement of the spinal cord. Among the symptoms, severe pains are\r\nprominent, either continuous or intermittent, within the pelvis and in\r\nthe sacral region, accompanied by a sense of weight and pressure in the\r\nabdomen, or by dragging pain in the region of the hips, in the gluteal\r\nregion, in the outer and back parts of the thighs, in the inner surface\r\nof the leg, in the calf, in the dorsum of the foot, the sole of the\r\nfoot, and the heel; or by coccydynia (pain over the coccyx and the lower\r\nextremity of the sacrum), or hyperæsthesia and anæsthesia of the\r\nexternal genitals in the region of the vaginal orifice, or, finally, by\r\ndisorder of the processes of micturition and defæcation. In some of\r\nthese cases, the weakness of the lower extremities is so severe that a\r\nparalytic condition is simulated. Actual paralysis may however occur, in\r\nconsequence of the extension of peritoneal inflammation to the\r\nnerve-plexuses of the pelvis, leading to the occurrence of neuritis.\r\n\r\nThe development of a general neurosis in consequence of disease of the\r\ngenital organs, either as a complication dependent upon the nervous\r\nstimulation excited by the primary disease, or as a reflex consequence\r\nof this disease, implies, as _Windscheid_ strongly maintains, the\r\nexistence prior to the occurrence of the disease of the genital organs\r\nof diminished power of resistance on the part of the nervous system.\r\nThis neuropathic constitution may be the result of inheritance, and,\r\naccording to _Engelhardt_, was so in 40 per cent. of his cases of women\r\nsuffering from nervous disease secondary to the disease of the genital\r\norgans; or it may be acquired. Given this weakness of the nervous\r\nsystem, a local disturbance of the genital organs may act as the\r\nultimate exciting cause of the onset of the neurosis in one of two\r\ndifferent ways (_Windscheid_). “1. The stimulus which the nerves of the\r\naffected genital organ (or those of some adjacent area, affected by\r\ndirect extension) have received, proceeds upward from segment to segment\r\nof the spinal cord, and ultimately passes to the highest centres. 2. Or,\r\non the other hand, the local nerves are not directly involved in the\r\nmorbid process in the genital organs, but this latter acts as a source\r\nof reflex disturbance, a disturbance which must also pass through\r\nnervous channels. To this latter class of cases belong the instances,\r\ncomparatively so frequent, in which, for example, a trifling\r\nretroflexion of the uterus must be regarded as the exciting cause of the\r\nneurosis.” The commonest neurosis of those that may be excited by local\r\ndisease of the genital organs is undoubtedly hysteria, next in frequency\r\ncome chorea and epileptic seizures.\r\n\r\n_Schauta_ draws attention to the important fact that hereditarily\r\npredisposed, neurasthenic individuals bear very badly repeated\r\ngynecological examinations and long-continued local treatment, inasmuch\r\nas, in such persons, a notable increase in the severity of the nervous\r\naffection may result, and even the outbreak of actual mental disorder;\r\nand he further points out that in hereditarily predisposed individuals,\r\npsychoses not infrequently occur in consequence of the performance of\r\ngynecological operations.\r\n\r\nThe processes of pregnancy make a deep impression on woman’s entire\r\nnervous system, and more especially on her mental functions. This is\r\nespecially noticeable in the case of primiparæ. The fact is easily\r\nunderstood, for a woman is filled with expectation and anxiety\r\nconcerning the unknown event, the complete revolution in her\r\norganization, the powerful impressions on her physical ego, the\r\nformation of a new being within her womb. How many joyful hopes, how\r\nmany distressing fears, are connected with that which is about to take\r\nplace, with the act of creation within her bosom; what changeful\r\nglimpses into the future, on the one hand the gladness, on the other the\r\nterror, of motherhood; often, also, the anxious doubts as to the\r\nprobable sex of the newcomer. Consider, too, the stormy sensations\r\nexperienced by a woman who, unmarried, has become pregnant contrary to\r\nher desires and expectations, especially one in a poverty-stricken\r\ncondition—consider the agonizing thoughts in such a case regarding the\r\nconsequences of giving birth to a child. It is only to be expected that\r\nin pregnant women in general there will almost always be increased\r\nirritability of the nervous system combined with a tendency to the rapid\r\nvariation of emotional states. _Neumann_ found, in almost all the\r\npregnant women he examined in respect to the point, that there was an\r\nincrease of the knee-jerks, as a manifestation of the general increase\r\nof nervous irritability. Nor does this change depend upon mental\r\ninfluences exclusively; there are other factors, such as the reflex\r\nprocesses aroused by the enlargement of the uterus, and also the changes\r\nin the composition of the blood which occur during pregnancy, and cannot\r\nfail to have an influence on the nutrition of the brain. Finally, also,\r\nthe deposit of carbonate of lime on the inner surfaces of the cranial\r\nbones (the parietal and frontal bones) which occurs during pregnancy,\r\nmay be regarded as having some casual connection with the changes in the\r\nnervous system; and, again many authors assume that the cerebral\r\ncirculation is influenced by the formation of the placental circulation.\r\n\r\nThe pathological consequences of pregnancy, as far as they affect the\r\nnervous system, take the form of neuralgia and of peripheral neuritis of\r\nvarious nerves, of chorea, of disturbances of the sense organs, and of\r\nactual psychoses.\r\n\r\nPeripheral neuritis in pregnant women affects chiefly the lower\r\nextremities, but has been observed in the arms also; it is characterized\r\nby muscular wasting with reaction of degeneration, by trophic\r\ndisturbances, and by disorders of sensation. A cure may ensue even\r\nduring the pregnancy, but in other cases the illness persists until\r\nafter parturition and on into the puerperium. To the same cause\r\n_Windscheid_ assigns the paræsthesias of pregnancy, burning, prickling,\r\nand numb sensations of the finger-tips, less commonly of the toe-tips;\r\nthese sensations are continuous, not paroxysmal, and cause very great\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nPregnancy favors the occurrence of chorea, a circumstance explicable by\r\nthe increased irritability of certain nerve centres characteristic of\r\nthe pregnant woman. The chorea of pregnancy occurs for the most part in\r\nprimiparæ, it is commoner in young than in older pregnant women, and\r\nappears especially in the early months of pregnancy. In the majority of\r\ncases the disease undergoes spontaneous cure before the end of the\r\npregnancy, but cases with a fatal termination have been observed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a curative influence in previously subsisting\r\nhysteria has been assigned to pregnancy. This in fact only occurs in\r\ncases in which the hysterical manifestations have been evoked by\r\ninfluences which are counteracted or removed by the occurrence of\r\npregnancy, such, for instance, as intense longing to bear a child,\r\ndissatisfaction with the existing circumstances of married life, etc.\r\nConversely, it is by no means unusual to observe that, in patients who\r\nhave previously suffered from hysteria, the attacks become more frequent\r\nduring pregnancy, and that other nervous disturbances associated with\r\nthe hysteria become more prominent; hysterical paralysis, even, may\r\nappear. Very variable also is the influence of pregnancy in epileptics.\r\nMost commonly, indeed, a certain quiescence sets in, the attacks\r\nbecoming less frequent and less severe; but the reverse of this is at\r\ntimes observed. In the domain of the sense organs we observe amblyopia\r\nand hemianopia, deafness, and tinnitus aurium, and disorders of taste;\r\nall these appear as pure nervous disturbances without known anatomical\r\nbasis (_Windscheid_).\r\n\r\nFinally, among neuroses, tetany may be mentioned. In women, this disease\r\noccurs almost exclusively during pregnancy and the puerperal state, in\r\nthe form of paroxysmal spasm, affecting chiefly the extremities, and\r\nespecially the hands; the spasm is bilateral, tonic in character, and\r\npainful. The tetany of pregnancy usually runs a favourable course.\r\n\r\nThe slighter forms of mental disorder consist of perversions of taste\r\nand smell. Of actual psychoses occurring during pregnancy, the commonest\r\nforms are melancholia and mania. The former condition, which, according\r\nto _Ripping_, occurs in 84.4 per cent. of the cases, is usually very\r\nsevere, and is characterized by a peculiar dreamy condition; it often\r\nleads to suicide, or to infanticide immediately after parturition. The\r\npsychoses of pregnancy are seen with greater frequency in the second\r\nhalf of pregnancy, they occur especially in primiparæ, and are also\r\ncommoner in unmarried women. The prognosis is on the whole an\r\nunfavorable one; sometimes, indeed, the mental disorder terminates with\r\nthe pregnancy, but in other cases it continues during the puerperium.\r\nMental alienation occurring in the early months of pregnancy is apt to\r\nbe less severe and to permit of a more favorable prognosis, than that\r\nwhich makes its appearance during the later months or at the end of the\r\npregnancy.\r\n\r\nIn 32 cases of insanity of pregnancy recorded by _Ripping_, 8 cases\r\noccurred in the first pregnancy, 5 in the second, 6 in the third, 3 in\r\nthe fourth, 4 in the fifth, 1 in the sixth, 1 in the seventh, 3 in the\r\neighth, 1 in the tenth. Of these women\r\n\r\n          3 became affected in the 1st month[41] of pregnancy.\r\n          4 became affected in the 2d month of pregnancy.\r\n          1 became affected in the 3d month of pregnancy.\r\n          2 became affected in the 4th month of pregnancy.\r\n          1 became affected in the 5th month of pregnancy.\r\n          0 became affected in the 6th month of pregnancy.\r\n          5 became affected in the 7th month of pregnancy.\r\n          5 became affected in the 8th month of pregnancy.\r\n          5 became affected in the 9th month of pregnancy.\r\n          6 became affected in the 10th month of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe neuralgias of pregnancy affect the most diverse nerve tracts, and\r\nmay occur either spontaneously, without any discernible local exciting\r\ncause, or in consequence of the pressure exercised by the enlarging\r\nuterus. To the former class of cases belong severe trigeminal neuralgia,\r\nthe familiar toothache affecting quite sound teeth at the very beginning\r\nof pregnancy, intercostal neuralgia, and paroxysms of mastodynia. The\r\npressure neuralgias affect chiefly the domain of the great sciatic\r\nnerve, manifesting themselves by the occurrence of pain down the back of\r\nthe thigh, in the calf, and on the dorsum of the foot, sometimes\r\nassociated with formication and other kinds of paræsthesia.\r\n\r\nParturition, by its powerful effect on the emotional nature in\r\ncombination with intense physical suffering, may give rise to numerous\r\nnervous disturbances. The chief of these are, neuralgia, occasioned by\r\nthe pressure of the fœtal head as it passes through the pelvis of the\r\nmother, paræsthesias, convulsions, maniacal paroxysms, transitory mental\r\nalienation, cerebral hæmorrhages, and eclampsia.\r\n\r\nThe nervous disturbances dependent upon the processes of the puerperium\r\nare numerous and severe. According to _Windscheid_, four types of\r\naffection of the motor nerves may arise at this period. 1.\r\nPressure-paralysis may occur in cases of generally contracted pelvis, or\r\neven in the absence of such contraction in cases of prolonged labor,\r\nfrom the pressure exercised by the child’s head upon the intrapelvic\r\nnerves, and above all on the great sciatic nerve; pressure-paralysis may\r\nalso result from obstetric operations, and especially from forceps\r\ndelivery. The symptoms of pressure-paralysis consist chiefly of\r\nparalysis of the extensors of the feet and the toes; sensory symptoms\r\nare usually wanting. 2. Inflammatory infective paralyses, due to the\r\nextension to adjacent nerves of puerperal inflammation of the pelvic\r\nconnective tissue. 3. Acute multiple neuritis, occurring either during\r\nthe latter half of pregnancy or a few days after delivery, and affecting\r\nnot only the nerves of the lower extremities, but those of remote\r\nregions, even the cranial nerves. 4. The rare puerperal hemiplegia due\r\nto cerebral hæmorrhage, occurring usually at the time the patient leaves\r\nher bed after delivery; puerperal hemiplegia may also arise from\r\nembolism consecutive to endocarditis, which may itself have originated\r\nbefore the termination of the pregnancy.\r\n\r\nOther puerperal diseases of the nervous system requiring mention are, on\r\nthe one hand, tetany, occurring during lactation, and permitting of a\r\nfavorable prognosis, and on the other, the infective puerperal tetanus,\r\nthe prognosis of which is exceedingly unfavorable. Finally, the\r\npuerperal state has to be considered as a factor in determining the\r\nonset of psychoses.\r\n\r\nThe puerperal psychoses are for the most part dependent upon the great\r\nloss of blood occurring during delivery, leading to anæmia and increased\r\nirritability of the brain, in association also with the circulatory\r\ndisturbances that arise in the central nervous organs in consequence of\r\nthe sudden emptying of the abdomen by the act of childbirth; but\r\nadditional causes of mental disorders are to be found in the changes in\r\nthe composition of the blood that occur during pregnancy, and the\r\ninfluence of these changes upon the nutrition of the brain. Inherited\r\npredisposition plays its usual part in these cases; and accessory\r\nfactors in producing mental disturbance during the puerperal state are\r\nto be found in puerperal infection, eclampsia, osteomalacia, and\r\nemotional shock.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, among 49 cases of puerperal psychoses, _Hansen_ found\r\nthat in 42 instances there was puerperal infection; and among 200 cases\r\nof puerperal eclampsia, _Olshausen_ found 11 patients suffering from\r\nmental disorder. The principal forms of insanity occurring at the\r\npuerperium are mania and melancholia, next in frequency come monomania\r\n(Ger. _Verrücktheit_), dementia (Ger. _Blödsinn_), alternating or\r\ncircular insanity (_folie circulaire_), hallucinatory paranoia (chronic\r\ndelusional insanity with hallucinations), and hysterical mental\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Windscheid_, the commonest cases are those which are\r\npurely puerperal, the rarest those in which the insanity of pregnancy\r\ncontinues during the puerperal state; the age at which puerperal\r\npsychoses most commonly occur varies between 31 and 35 years, the\r\naverage age being 29.1; multiparæ are more often affected than\r\nprimiparæ; the outbreak of mental disorder most commonly occurs within a\r\nweek after the birth of the child; there is nothing specific about the\r\nvarious forms of puerperal insanity, which are identical with the\r\nrespective varieties owning another etiology. According to this author,\r\nbefore an attack of puerperal mania, prodromal symptoms usually occur,\r\nsuch as headache, dizziness (Ger. _Augenflimmern_), feelings of anxiety,\r\ninsomnia, followed by various congestive symptoms, and either by great\r\nrestlessness or by great apathy, and very often by indifference to the\r\ninfant; to these symptoms succeeds the period of motor excitability,\r\ncharacterized by great bodily restlessness and by continued\r\ntalkativeness; the culmination takes the form of a maniacal outburst, in\r\nwhich infanticide even may occur; the delirium runs mostly in erotic and\r\nreligious channels. Puerperal melancholia also exhibits the usual\r\nclinical picture of this form of mental disorder; after prodromal\r\nheadache, stupor sets in, often associated with attacks of anxiety and\r\nwith hallucinations of sense, and always characterized by great loss of\r\nappetite and by a suicidal tendency.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the puerperal psychoses, it appears that the first\r\nmenstruation after the birth of the child has, like the very first\r\nappearance of the menstrual flow during the menarche, a tendency to\r\nfavor the onset of mental disorder. According to _Marcé_, this first\r\npost-puerperal menstruation has a very definite significance in the\r\ncausation of psychoses. Among forty-four cases of puerperal psychoses,\r\nthere were eleven instances in which the mental disorder made its\r\nappearance six weeks after childbirth, exactly at the moment, that is to\r\nsay, in which, had the mothers not given suck to their children,\r\nmenstruation ought to have reappeared. In those who did not nurse their\r\ninfants, and in whom menstruation recommenced at the due date, the\r\npsychosis usually began on the first day of menstruation, less often on\r\nthe fourth or fifth day. In some instances the psychosis appeared at the\r\ntime at which menstruation might have been expected to occur, but when\r\nthe flow was still in abeyance. And in some women who suckled their\r\nchildren for a time and then weaned them, the psychosis made its\r\nappearance at the time of the first recurrence of menstruation.\r\n\r\nAmong diseases of the sense-organs occurring during the menacme, ocular\r\nlesions are by no means rare as sequels of pathological changes in the\r\ngenital organs. Thus, in cases of displacements of the uterus,\r\nespecially prolapse, retroflexion, and retroversion, we sometimes see\r\nretinal hyperæsthesia and reflex amblyopia, photophobia and\r\nlachrymation, and accommodative or muscular asthenopia. Inflammation of\r\nthe pelvic connective tissue, perimetritic and parametritic exudations,\r\nand especially parametritis atrophicans, may give rise to functional\r\ndisorders of the eye, reflex hyperæmia of the trigeminal and optic\r\nnerves, various painful sensations, and photophobia. Severe metrorrhagia\r\nmay also cause disturbances of vision, either by inducing local anæmia\r\nand consequent functional failure of the nervous apparatus, or by\r\nleading to serious infiltration of the optic nerve which manifests\r\nitself also in the retina in the form of a transudation. In cases alike\r\nof congenital and of acquired atrophy of the uterus, and frequently,\r\ntherefore, in sterile women, optic nerve atrophy may occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n        COMPETENCE FOR MARRIAGE OF WOMEN SUFFERING FROM DISEASE.\r\n\r\nIn this section we must consider the competence for marriage of women\r\nsuffering from heart disease, of those suffering from hereditary\r\ntendency to mental disorders and neurasthenic states, and, finally, of\r\nthose affected with tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nEvery doctor is confronted during the practice of his profession by the\r\nproblem whether a young woman known to suffer from heart disease is\r\njustified in entering upon marriage and in exposing herself to the\r\ndangers entailed on her diseased heart by copulation, pregnancy,\r\nparturition, and the puerperium. The solution of this problem is as\r\nimportant as it is difficult. On the one hand, it determines the whole\r\nfuture course of a human life which is still ascending the upward path\r\nof its vital career, and a negative decision often annuls in a moment\r\nthe young woman’s ideals and hopes; on the other hand, an affirmative\r\ndecision involves the responsibility for the consequences of marriage,\r\noften grave in these cases.\r\n\r\nThe consequences are in fact apt to be very serious indeed. The normal\r\nact of intercourse, in a young and sensitive woman, has already an\r\nexciting influence on the nerve apparatus by which the movements of the\r\nheart are controlled. The frequency of the heart’s action is greatly\r\nincreased, the cardiac impulse becomes much stronger, there is marked\r\npulsation of the peripheral arteries, the conjunctiva is injected, the\r\nrespiration more frequent. These manifestations, which normally are\r\nquite transient, attain a greater intensity and exhibit a longer\r\nduration in persons affected with heart disease. In some instances,\r\nviolent tachycardial paroxysms occur, with considerable dyspnœa, pains\r\nin the cardiac region, headache, and even syncopal attacks.\r\n\r\nPregnancy, in consequence of the extensive changes undergone not only by\r\nthe reproductive apparatus but also by the general system, and further\r\nin consequence of the vital needs of the developing embryo, involves\r\nextensive claims upon the cardiac activity. It is easy to understand\r\nthat the diseased heart must be taxed more severely than the healthy\r\nheart by the extension of existing vascular areas, the addition of new\r\nvascular areas, and the increase in the quantity of the blood, during\r\npregnancy; and it is not surprising if the overtaxed organ threatens\r\nsometimes to give way under the strain. Thus, during pregnancy in women\r\naffected with morbus cordis, we observe numerous troubles in the way of\r\ndisturbances of cardiac activity and passive congestion of various\r\norgans, culminating at times in abortion.\r\n\r\nParturition and the puerperium, moreover, bring several factors into\r\nplay which tend to affect unfavorably even a heart that is quite normal;\r\nand in cases in which there is disease either of the heart or of the\r\ngreat vessels, these factors may lead to the occurrence of most alarming\r\nsymptoms. In this connection we may refer to endocarditis, to fatty\r\ndegeneration of the myocardium, and to the rupture of atheromatous\r\narteries.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of _Galen_ onwards all medical writers have agreed that\r\nthe heart is unfavorably influenced by pregnancy and its\r\nconsequences—but from this incontestable proposition to deduce the\r\ngeneral conclusion that young women affected with heart disease must be\r\nforbidden to marry is in my opinion too great a jump, and altogether too\r\nsweeping a statement. The apophthegm of _Peters_, an author to whom we\r\nare certainly indebted for some of our knowledge of the _accidents\r\ngravido-cardiaques_, that in the case of women suffering from morbus\r\ncordis the rule must be enforced, _fille pas de mariage_, _femme pas de\r\ngrossesse_, _mère pas d’allaitement_, has a fine air of apodictic\r\nbrevity, but is entirely devoid of justification. No such rigid\r\nprohibition is advanced by recent writers on heart disease, such as\r\n_Huchard_, _von Leyden_, and _Rosenbach_; not, at least, without\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the permissibility of marriage to girls and women\r\naffected with heart disease cannot, in fact, be answered by any general\r\nproposition; and each case demands separate inquiry and a careful\r\nbalancing of individual considerations. I have known cases in which the\r\nmarriage of young girls suffering from morbus cordis was equivalent to a\r\nsentence of death, the execution of which was delayed for a few months\r\nonly. On the other hand, I have known many women belonging to the upper\r\nclasses and suffering from cardiac defects to pass through numerous\r\npregnancies and to give birth to a number of children with no more than\r\ntrifling disturbances of compensation. I am acquainted with a lady who\r\nwhen a young girl was urgently advised against marriage, on account of\r\nextensive aortic valvular incompetency, by two celebrated physicians.\r\nThe advice was disregarded, and this lady is now the mother of four\r\nchildren, the eldest of whom is twenty-two years of age, and her general\r\ncondition is in no way worse than it was before her marriage. The\r\ndangers of marriage in women suffering from morbus cordis are in my\r\nopinion generally overrated.\r\n\r\nThe degree to which a woman affected with heart disease will be injured\r\nby married life, will depend on the nature of the cardiac affection, on\r\nthe time it has already existed, on the adequacy of compensation or the\r\nintensity of existing disturbances of compensation, on the general state\r\nof nutrition of the patient, on the more or less favorable social\r\nposition, and on the manner in which sexual intercourse is regulated.\r\n\r\nMy own opinions in respect of this question may be summed up as follows:\r\nA woman who has comparatively recently (within a few years) acquired a\r\nvalvular defect, and in whom the disease has run such a course that, in\r\nconsequence of dilatation of certain chambers of the heart and of\r\nhypertrophy of those segments of the myocardium on which increased work\r\nhas been thrown, and thus in consequence of adaptation of the\r\ncardio-vascular apparatus to the new conditions, the circulation and\r\ndistribution of the blood take place in a manner closely resembling that\r\nin which these functions are effected in a normal, healthy individual—in\r\na word, a woman in whom the valvular disease appears to be adequately\r\ncompensated,—if, in addition, the patient is well nourished, if the\r\nhæmatopoietic function has not undergone any notable disturbance, if the\r\nmuscular system is powerful and the nervous system possesses sufficient\r\npower of resistance—then marriage may be permitted without hesitation.\r\nIn the case of such a girl or woman, we can confidently assume that the\r\nadequate compensation of the valvular disease will enable the heart to\r\nmeet with success the claims made upon its reserve energies by sexual\r\nintercourse, by pregnancy, and by parturition, and that these processes\r\nwill not involve any excessive danger to life.\r\n\r\nA woman with valvular heart disease, even when that disease is well\r\ncompensated, will indeed during pregnancy and still more during\r\nparturition and the early days of the puerperium, be liable to suffer\r\nfrom various manifestations of cardiac disorder. The action of her heart\r\nwill be subject to paroxysmal increase in frequency and force, sometimes\r\nalso there may be transient attacks of cardiac asthenia; at the same\r\ntime the breathing will become more frequent and deeper, and\r\noccasionally, even, there may be severe dyspnœa. Perhaps also symptoms\r\nof venous congestion may manifest themselves, digestive disturbances,\r\nsense of pressure in the head, swelling of the feet, œdema of the\r\nabdominal wall, even slight albuminuria. Just after childbirth,\r\nmoreover, an abnormally intense depression of the circulation with\r\ninfrequency of the heart’s action will be liable to ensue. In the great\r\nmajority of cases, however, in which the conditions detailed above are\r\nfulfilled, the disturbances of compensation occasioned by pregnancy and\r\nthe puerperal state will not seriously threaten life; and as soon as the\r\npuerperal period has been safely passed through, the heart will again be\r\ncompetent for its duties and will do its work as well as before.\r\n\r\nThese statements apply, not only to cases of well-compensated valvular\r\ndisease, especially mitral insufficiency, mitral stenosis, and aortic\r\ninsufficiency, but also to cases in which the heart has made a good\r\nrecovery after an attack of pericarditis, and to cases of moderately\r\nextensive disease of the myocardium consequent on acute articular\r\nrheumatism or the acute infections.\r\n\r\nAs indispensable conditions for such a favorable prognosis, we naturally\r\nassume that the pregnant woman is in a position to command the extreme\r\nbodily care that in her condition is doubly needful, that she is able to\r\navoid all severe physical exertion, and that she will be subjected to\r\ncontinuous medical supervision in respect of the adoption of suitable\r\ndietetic and hygienic measures.\r\n\r\nSuch a favorable prospect as regards marriage in cases of\r\nwell-compensated heart disease will, however, be clouded in the case of\r\nwomen who are either very anæmic or predisposed to nervous disorders;\r\nnor is the prognosis favorable as regards women in whom the heart\r\ndisease is either congenital, or acquired in early youth, or as regards\r\nwomen contemplating marriage when already well up in years.\r\n\r\nFor in very anæmic women, even when the heart is quite sound, frequently\r\nrecurring attacks of tachycardia often occur during pregnancy, in the\r\nabsence of any obvious exciting cause; œdema of the lower extremities,\r\nand the formation of extensive varices, are also common. Increased\r\nnervous reflex irritability has also an unfavorable influence upon\r\ncardiac innervation. In cases, again, in which the heart disease is of\r\nlong standing, the functional capacity of the heart is so notably\r\ndepressed that the organ is likely to prove incompetent to meet the\r\nincreased demands made upon it by the processes of pregnancy. Finally,\r\nin elderly women, superadded to the valvular defects, we have the\r\ndangers dependent upon the already beginning arteriosclerotic changes in\r\nthe bloodvessels. In all such cases, therefore, it will be the duty of\r\nthe physician to advise his patient not to marry; and in any case to\r\nimpress upon her mind the extreme probability, amounting almost to\r\ncertainty, of serious aggravation of the heart disease by marriage, with\r\npermanent impairment of the general health.\r\n\r\nIn cases of valvular disease accompanied by serious disturbances of\r\ncompensation, and in cases of notable degeneration of the myocardium in\r\nwhich pronounced symptoms of cardiac muscular insufficiency have made\r\ntheir appearance, marriage must be absolutely forbidden, as directly\r\nimperilling life. When even moderate bodily exertion suffices to cause\r\npalpitation, increased frequency of the pulse, and shortness of breath,\r\nwhen extensive œdema of the lower extremities is present and fails to\r\ndisappear even after the patient has been strictly confined to bed, when\r\nthe pulse very readily becomes irregular both in rhythm and force,\r\nwhilst the urine is often scanty and contains variable quantities of\r\nalbumin, when conditions of cardiac asthenia readily arise,\r\ncharacterized by a small, irregular pulse, coldness of the extremities,\r\ncyanotic tint, nausea, respiratory need,[42] and syncopal attacks—in all\r\nsuch cases, whether the symptoms just described are dependent upon\r\nvalvular defects, upon pathological changes in the arteries, or upon\r\ndiseases of the myocardium, in all alike the occurrence of pregnancy is\r\na true disaster, which in the vast majority of cases causes a great and\r\nenduring aggravation of the disease, and frequently enough costs the\r\npatient her life.\r\n\r\nEven in such cases as were previously described, in which, the heart\r\ndisease not being severe, the patient was told that marriage was\r\npermissible, it is the duty of the physician to lay down certain rigid\r\nrules regarding sexual activity.\r\n\r\nWomen suffering from heart disease should not have sexual intercourse\r\nfrequently, because, if the peripheral nervous stimulation of the\r\ngenital organs is excessive in consequence of too frequent acts of\r\ncoitus, cardiac activity is likely to be influenced powerfully in a\r\nreflex manner, leading to the occurrence of attacks of cardiac asthenia.\r\nAgain, sexual intercourse must always be effected in such a manner that\r\nthe act attains its physiological conclusion, and that in the woman as\r\nwell as in the man the orgasm has its normal outcome, that is to say\r\nthat at the conclusion of the act the woman’s cervical glands are\r\nevacuated with the accompaniment of the sense of ejaculation. The\r\n_congressus interruptus_, which precisely in these cases in which the\r\nwife suffers from heart disease is so frequently practiced by the\r\nhusband with a view to preventing conception, must be strictly\r\nforbidden, since this mode of intercourse tends to give rise to various\r\nforms of reflex cardiac disturbance, most commonly to paroxysms in which\r\nthe cardiac action becomes unduly frequent, in association with\r\ndiminution of vascular tone, vasomotor disturbances, and states of\r\nmental depression; and where organic heart disease already exists, these\r\nreflex functional disturbances involve various dangers.\r\n\r\nThe physician is further justified in advising that a woman with organic\r\nheart disease should not give birth to more than one or two children.\r\nThis advice is the more needful for the reason that with each successive\r\npregnancy the functional capacity of the woman’s diseased heart\r\ndiminishes according to a geometrical ratio, and to a corresponding\r\ndegree the danger to life increases. These are cases in which in my\r\nopinion it is the physician’s duty to concern himself with the\r\nsubject—in general so equivocal—of the use of preventive measures, and,\r\nhaving regard for the preservation of a woman’s life, and uninfluenced\r\nby any false delicacy, but with moral earnestness, to inform his patient\r\nwith respect to the needful prophylactic measures. The artificial\r\ntermination of pregnancy, which unquestionably is often justified in\r\nwomen suffering from heart disease, but which unfortunately is apt to\r\nhave very unfavorable results, will rarely need to be discussed if by\r\nthe proper employment of preventive measures care is taken that\r\npregnancy does not recur too frequently.\r\n\r\nTo enable us to answer the question whether, in the case of neurasthenic\r\nand hysterical young women, and in those hereditarily predisposed to the\r\noccurrence of mental disorders, the physician shall advise for or\r\nagainst marriage, attention must in the first instance be directed to\r\nthe established facts relating to the favorable or unfavorable\r\ninfluence, as the case may be, of sexual intercourse and its\r\nconsequences (pregnancy and childbirth) upon existing nervous disorders\r\nand upon the predisposition to their occurrence.\r\n\r\nWithout regarding as fully justified the opinion that in the female sex\r\nsexual abstinence has in all circumstances an unfavorable influence upon\r\nthe nervous system or even that such abstinence is to be regarded as the\r\nprincipal cause of nervous and hysterical troubles, we must consider it\r\nfully proved that in a number of the commonest varieties of nervous\r\ndisease occurring in neurasthenically predisposed subjects, such as\r\nneurasthenia, hysteria and neurosis of anxiety[43], the lack of sexual\r\nsatisfaction aggravates these troubles, whilst suitably regulated sexual\r\nintercourse has an actively beneficial effect. Not, indeed, that it is\r\nan infallible means, but none the less the effects are often striking,\r\nas I have frequently had occasion to observe, both in young women so\r\naffected entering upon marriage for the first time, and also in young\r\nwidows who have remarried. Especially is this true of women in whom the\r\nsexual impulse is exceedingly powerful, and even pathologically\r\nincreased to the extent of marked sexual hyperæsthesia; likewise also in\r\nwomen whose social circumstances and manner of life induce increased\r\nsexual appetite. Be it understood, I refer here to regular and moderate\r\nsexual intercourse, and not to sexual excesses, which latter, by\r\ninducing nervous exhaustion, may have a distinctly deleterious effect.\r\nIn many cases, however, we observe in women suffering from sexual\r\nneurasthenia, that sexual intercourse, even when practiced at long\r\nintervals, gives rise to nervous prostration with deep emotional\r\ndepression and long-lasting aggravation of the existing nervous\r\ndisorder. This statement applies with especial force to very hysterical\r\nepileptic girls with hereditary predisposition to mental disorder.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that among persons hereditarily predisposed to mental\r\ndisorder, the unmarried are on the average more often affected with\r\ninsanity than the married, the inference has been drawn that marriage\r\nmay be recommended to such persons as a measure likely to counteract\r\ntheir hereditary tendency to insanity. The argument, however, lacks\r\nvalidity, more especially as regards women; among whom, moreover, from\r\nthe age of sixteen to the age of thirty, insanity is proportionately\r\nmore prevalent among the married, though above the age of thirty it is\r\nmore prevalent among the unmarried.\r\n\r\nIn the great majority of neurasthenic women, normal sexual intercourse,\r\npracticed in moderation, has, according to _Löwenfeld_, no deleterious\r\neffect; often, indeed, as a consequence of unaccustomed abstinence, an\r\naggravation of existing nervous troubles may be observed. But, as this\r\nauthor maintains, nervous exhaustion may result in the complete\r\ndisappearance of the orgasm during sexual intercourse, or in great\r\ndifficulty in its production; this circumstance suffices for the most\r\npart to explain the fact that in women suffering from great depression\r\nof the nervous functions, the fulfilment of their sexual duties has\r\nsometimes an unfavorable influence on their general condition. As\r\nregards hysteria, it cannot be denied, that in many hysterical women\r\nmarriage results in a favorable change in the general condition; we\r\nmust, however, be careful not to overrate the significance of such\r\nobservations. As a rule all that actually takes place is a diminution in\r\nthe intensity or even a disappearance of certain morbid manifestations\r\npreviously present, without, however, an eradication of the hysterical\r\ntemperament.\r\n\r\nIn epileptic young women, the first experience of sexual intercourse may\r\nprecipitate a fit. Cases are indeed on record in which, in hereditarily\r\npredisposed girls, the first coitus was the exciting cause of the first\r\nepileptic fit, the fits recurring every time sexual intercourse was\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nIt is a comparatively frequent occurrence in psychopathically\r\npredisposed girls for severe mental disturbances to make their\r\nappearance during the honeymoon, after the first experience of sexual\r\nintercourse; when this occurs, it is doubtless to be accounted for by\r\nthe combined influence upon the mind of all the changes in the\r\ncircumstances of life which have resulted from the marriage. In the case\r\nof two newly married women, one of whom had well-marked hereditary\r\npredisposition, whilst in the other there was no known family history of\r\nmental disorder, _Löwenfeld_ observed shortly after marriage the onset\r\nof severe melancholia, with refusal of food. The delicate, nervous\r\ntemperament of these two women, on the one hand, and, on the other,\r\npossibly, a somewhat too eager and passionate attitude on the part of\r\ntheir respective husbands, led their first experience of sexual\r\nintercourse to result in a nervous impression of the nature of shock,\r\nwhich their nervous system was too weak to resist.\r\n\r\nFrequently recurring pregnancy and childbirth may, according to\r\n_Krönig_, act as the predisposing cause in the production of\r\nneurasthenia. In regard to hysteria also we must admit that the onset of\r\nsome disease of the organs of generation frequently leads previously\r\nlatent hysteria to manifest itself openly, and further we have to\r\nrecognize that diseases of the reproductive system often give the\r\nclinical picture of hysteria a quite distinctive coloration; the\r\nphysiological course of the functions of the generative organs is also\r\ncompetent to produce both of these effects. _Krönig_, however, rejects\r\nthe view that the lack of sexual intercourse has an unfavorable\r\ninfluence upon the nervous system in women, and gives rise to hysterical\r\nand neurasthenic disorders. The favorable influence which marriage is\r\noften observed to exercise upon the course of nervous disorders is\r\nexplicable with reference to psychical considerations of a very\r\ndifferent nature. Sexual abuses, masturbation, and the use of preventive\r\nmeasures, give rise in women far less often than in men to neurasthenic\r\nand hysterical conditions.\r\n\r\n_Féré_ asserts that in certain neurasthenic patients sexual intercourse\r\ninduces a general blunting of the senses, and especially of hearing and\r\nsight. Actual amaurosis of short duration may even be observed; also\r\ncutaneous anæsthesias, paralytic conditions of the extremities taking\r\nthe form either of hemiplegia or paraplegia, convulsive attacks, and\r\nsomnolent paroxysms.\r\n\r\n_Delasiauve_ observed that epileptic patients, who during residence in\r\nan asylum had remained almost entirely free from fits, after returning\r\nhome and resuming sexual intercourse, even in strict moderation,\r\nsuffered from a recrudescence of the convulsive seizures; when\r\nintercourse was excessive, the relapse was naturally even more severe.\r\n\r\nIn two instances, in women who in a single night had practiced\r\nintercourse to very great excess, _Hammond_ observed paralysis of both\r\nlegs to ensue; he saw also in numerous cases spinal irritation and other\r\nnervous disturbances as a consequence of sexual excesses.\r\n\r\n_Von Krafft-Ebing_ points out, with reference to the prophylactic\r\ninfluence of marriage in respect of mental disorder, that in men early\r\nmarriage diminishes the danger of the occurrence of such disorder,\r\nwhereas in women marriage is undesirable before the attainment of\r\ncomplete physical maturity.\r\n\r\nWith regard to marriage in the case of persons suffering from nervous\r\ndiseases, _Ribbing_ lays down the rule that when such diseases have been\r\nsevere and have occurred in numerous members of a family, whilst a few\r\nonly in the family have remained healthy, when, moreover, the illness\r\nhas been accustomed to make its first appearance only after the\r\nattainment of maturity, no indications of its onset being noticeable in\r\nchildhood or youth—one belonging to a family thus afflicted should be\r\nadvised not to marry. Where, however, the hereditary tendency is to a\r\ndisease likely to manifest itself in childhood or youth, a member of\r\nsuch a family who has been fortunate enough to pass through the years of\r\ndevelopment without exhibiting any pronounced disturbance of the nervous\r\nsystem, may be permitted to marry if certain precautions are observed. A\r\nwoman with a tendency to alcoholism should in no circumstances be\r\nallowed to marry. In the cases, fortunately rare, in which the\r\ndrink-craving exists in women, marriage is even more undesirable than it\r\nis in the case of men similarly afflicted, for the female drunkard is in\r\na position in which she can mishandle and neglect her children\r\nthroughout the entire day; and, moreover, this affection appears to be\r\neven more obstinately incurable in women than it is in men.\r\n\r\n_Löwenfeld_ very rightly insists that in deciding on the advisability of\r\nmarriage in the case of neurasthenic and hysterical girls the\r\nanticipated influence of sexual intercourse must not be the sole\r\ndeterminant. “Regulated sexual intercourse, such as is rendered possible\r\nby marriage, has often a favorable influence on previously existing\r\nstates of nervous weakness. But we should go too far if we were to\r\nattribute the beneficial effect of married life on such conditions\r\nsolely to sexual intercourse. This latter is but one factor among\r\nseveral, the others being no less important. These others are: The\r\npleasures of an orderly domestic activity; the withdrawal of the\r\npatient’s attention from her own condition, partly by domestic duties\r\nand difficulties, and partly by the novelty of marital companionship;\r\nthe gratification, especially strong in women, at having obtained a\r\nsupport in life; and, finally, the joyful expectation of motherhood.\r\nThese factors, however, are not present in every marriage. When their\r\npresence cannot reasonably be anticipated, when, in consequence of\r\ninsufficient means, the marriage is likely to entail increasing\r\ntroubles, or when, owing to the want of suitability of temperament,\r\nannoyances and quarrels are likely to occur, we must throw the weight of\r\nour advice into the scale against the proposed marriage, since the\r\nadvantages of regulated sexual intercourse are not likely to outweigh\r\nthe disadvantages just detailed. Even when means are ample and the\r\ncharacters of the couple contemplating marriage are unquestionably\r\nharmonious, we must nevertheless (temporarily, at any rate) advise\r\nagainst marriage, we must, that is to say, advise the postponement of\r\nmarriage, if the bride is suffering from severe hysterical or\r\nneurasthenic states. Where, further, such neurasthenic or hysterical\r\ntroubles occur in a woman with pronounced hereditary predisposition to\r\nnervous disease, we must, both for the sake of the possible progeny and\r\non account of the uncertain influence of married life on the health of\r\nthe patient, absolutely and unconditionally prohibit marriage. In cases\r\nalso in which severe hereditary predisposition to mental disorder exists\r\n(especially when derived from both parents), and in addition stigmata of\r\npsychopathic degeneration are actually apparent in the patient, or she\r\nhas already suffered from the development of a psychosis, we must\r\ndecisively object to the patient’s marriage.”\r\n\r\nAs regards the marriage of young women suffering from tuberculosis, we\r\nmust take into consideration a fact that medical experience has\r\nconclusively established, namely, that the processes of generation have\r\nan unfavorable influence upon pulmonary phthisis. Girls with an\r\ninherited predisposition to tubercular disease, sometimes first manifest\r\nthe symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis at the time of the menarche. In\r\ncases of developed tuberculosis, copulation and the excitement of the\r\nvascular system associated therewith have a more or less unfavorable\r\ninfluence—and all the more inasmuch as, in accordance with the saying\r\n_omnis phthisicus salax_, women affected with tuberculosis often exhibit\r\na very lively sexual impulse, an almost insatiable sexual appetite.\r\nSexual excesses are, moreover, very likely to lead to the occurrence of\r\nhæmoptysis.\r\n\r\nIn former days it was believed that conception and pregnancy, when\r\noccurring in women suffering from tuberculosis, had a restraining\r\ninfluence on the progress of the pulmonary disease, a view which found\r\nexpression in the assertion of _Baumes_ and _Rosières de la Chassagne_\r\nthat of two women affected with tuberculosis to the same degree of\r\nseverity, one who became pregnant would always outlive the other who\r\nfailed to become so. Careful and sufficient observations on the part of\r\nphysicians and gynecologists have, however, shown that this view was\r\nfallacious, and, on the contrary, that during pregnancy tuberculosis\r\nadvances with more rapid strides, that pregnancy, and lying-in\r\naccelerate the fatal event (_Grisolle_, _Lebert_), that tuberculosis\r\nacquired shortly before pregnancy or in the course of that condition,\r\nprogresses with exceptional rapidity (_Larcher_), and that the lying-in\r\nperiod is especially perilous to these patients (_A. Hanau_). In some\r\ncases of consumption it is the first pregnancy that is the most\r\nperilous, but in other cases a later pregnancy proves more destructive.\r\n\r\n_Ribbing_ goes even further, insisting that neither man nor woman\r\naffected with pulmonary consumption should marry. “If, indeed,” he\r\nwrites, “consumptives desire to enter upon marriage, merely with the aim\r\nof being faithful to one another and assisting one another for the short\r\ntime that remains to them, I should offer no opposition. But there must\r\nbe a complete mutual understanding of the facts of the case, and an\r\nunalterable determination on the part of both to carry out the\r\nresolutions made prior to marriage, for failing this the consequences\r\nwill be most disastrous. In most cases, however, the course adopted by\r\n_Bulwer’s Pilgrims of the Rhine_ is to be preferred, the lovers\r\ncontenting themselves with the condition of a betrothed pair, and in\r\nthat state awaiting the approach of death—or, if exceptionally\r\nfortunate, proceeding to marriage only after restoration to health.”\r\n\r\nIt would certainly appear that in the case of girls suffering from\r\npronounced phthisis, we are justified in advising against marriage, on\r\naccount of the great danger which this state entails of a rapid advance\r\nin the pulmonary disease.\r\n\r\nBased upon the observations of _Schauta_ and _Fellner_, the latter\r\nauthor advances the rule that in the case of a woman suffering from\r\ndisease, marriage should be forbidden only when the mortality from the\r\ndisease in question is not less than 10 per cent. In this category we\r\nmust include severe cases only of pulmonary tuberculosis; whilst cases\r\nof laryngeal tuberculosis will, according to this rule, be absolutely\r\nunfitted for marriage. Among heart-affections contra-indicating\r\nmarriage, he includes mitral stenosis, other valvular affections in\r\nwhich there is serious disturbance of compensation, and myocarditis; he\r\nconsiders marriage inadmissible also in cases of chronic nephritis, and,\r\namong surgical affections, in cases of malignant tumour. In cases in\r\nwhich during a previous pregnancy the patient has been affected by one\r\nof the following diseases, viz., severe chorea, mental disorders, severe\r\nepilepsy, pulmonary tuberculosis which progressed much during the\r\npregnancy, morbus cordis with considerable disturbance of compensation,\r\nsevere heart trouble due to Graves’ disease—in all such cases, a\r\nrepetition of pregnancy should be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      HYGIENE DURING THE MENACME.\r\n\r\nDuring the sexual epoch of the menacme a woman’s principal hygienic need\r\nis marriage completely satisfactory alike to body and to mind. It cannot\r\nbe denied that sufficient sexual gratification, regular, of course, and\r\nfree from all excess, such as is usually experienced in married life, is\r\nvery advantageous to the health of a woman who has attained sexual\r\nmaturity—even though we admit that the drawbacks of sexual abstinence,\r\nregarded as a cause of disease of the female genital organs and the\r\nnervous system have been as a rule greatly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe inability to marry always makes a deep impression on the mental life\r\nof woman, and in many cases also gives rise to burning desire and\r\ntormenting yearning of an erotic nature. The unmarried miss life’s true\r\ngoal and fail to enjoy the natural exercise of their functional\r\ncapacities; alike in the cultured lady and in the poor working woman who\r\nhas failed to marry, the thoughts and feelings return again and again to\r\nher own condition in a self-tormenting manner.\r\n\r\nThe physical and mental disadvantages entailed by sexual gratification\r\nwhen obtained by an unmarried woman, one who, according to modern\r\nphraseology, “wishes to secure her natural share of the joys of love,”\r\nand who regards voluntary chastity as “a sacrifice to meaningless\r\nprejudices”—need not be more particularly described.\r\n\r\nFree love, moreover, is the most important disseminator of gonorrhœal\r\ninfection. “In any future commonwealth,” says _Runge_, “in which\r\nmarriage is abandoned in favour of the general practice of free love,\r\nthe human race will be overwhelmed by gonococci in a manner now hardly\r\nconceivable, and the reproductive capacity in both sexes will be\r\ndiminished by the results of gonorrhœa to a very serious extent.”\r\n\r\nFrequently enough, also, free love leads to prostitution, which at the\r\npresent day is so widely prevalent. Various reasons have been suggested\r\nto account for the increase of prostitution. Among these are: The growth\r\nof modern industry, with the consequent aggregation of the population in\r\nlarge towns; the decline in the marriage rate; the postponement of\r\nmarriage; universal military service; the freer mutual companionship of\r\nthe sexes; and many others. At any rate, the fact would appear to be\r\nestablished, that in the case of woman the determining cause of\r\nprostitution is hunger rather than the sexual impulse. The worst paid\r\nclasses of workwomen are shown by official statistics to furnish the\r\nlargest number of recruits to the ranks of prostitutes; and it is during\r\ntimes of deficient employment that the number of women practicing\r\noccasional prostitution increases. Thus, material need is the most\r\nimportant of the causes of prostitution.\r\n\r\nThis remains true even though the doctrine of _Lombroso_ and _Tarnowsky_\r\nshould find fuller justification, the doctrine that the practice of\r\nprostitution by women is the natural expression of a congenital morbid\r\npredisposition, “which impels them, in defiance of their direct\r\nadvantage, of reason, and of all counter-advice, to adopt this accursed\r\nmode of life.” Prostitution, in this view, is to be regarded as the\r\ninevitable outcome of congenital moral insanity. This is certainly true\r\nof a small proportion of prostitutes, but is as certainly false of the\r\ngreat majority, in whom unfavorable, difficult conditions of life form\r\nthe determining cause. A certain inherited or acquired mental\r\ndisposition may, indeed, be assumed to exist in these cases also—an\r\nunstable moral equilibrium, an insufficient development of the force of\r\nthe will and of the power of resistance.\r\n\r\nThe hygienic requirement of married life for woman during the menacme is\r\nundoubtedly sometimes hard to fulfil in our day, when the more elaborate\r\nand expensive standard of life has increased the difficulty of\r\nsupporting a family; but from the medical point of view it is necessary\r\nto insist forcibly on this categorical imperative, in opposition to the\r\nview advanced by the modern women’s rights’ party, that “love is moral\r\nalso in the absence of legal marriage” (_Ellen Key_); in opposition to\r\nthe yet more extreme opinion of _George Sand_ and of _Almquist_, who,\r\nregardless of consequences, declare marriage to be immoral; and,\r\nfinally, in opposition to the advocates of “free love,” who wish woman\r\nto be as free as man in sexual relations.\r\n\r\nMuch as we may wish that man and wife should be in complete harmony in\r\nmarriage, and that they should feel themselves to be firmly united alike\r\nby mutual love and by a reciprocal sense of duty, none the less we must\r\nconsider the modern maiden ripe for marriage as unjustified in\r\ndemanding, before undertaking marriage, “perfect love as typifying the\r\ninner yearning of two beings to become one;” and we must regard the\r\nlatter-day woman as extravagant in insisting that the man shall enter\r\nupon marriage in a condition as virgin as that of his contemplated wife.\r\n“Perfect love” is as rare and as little to be expected as perfect\r\nbeauty; and the sexual life of man differs entirely in nature and in the\r\ncourse of its development from the sexual activity of women.\r\n\r\nDoubtless they spring deep from the soul of woman, the demands expressed\r\nby the writer of the book “_Vera_” and by her numerous imitators, the\r\napostles of “Veraism,”—the demands of the maiden entering upon marriage\r\nthat her husband shall be as chaste and sexually as unspotted as\r\nherself. Difficult of fulfilment as they are, if fulfilment is even\r\npossible, these demands must none the less be regarded as characteristic\r\nof the sexual life of modern womanhood. “Is man’s sexual honor,”\r\nexclaims _Vera,_ “then altogether different from that of woman? Is not\r\nthe alleged necessity for sexual gratification in youth either a\r\nwell-organized fraud or an enormous error on the part of physicians? Is\r\nit possible that chastity can entail diseases as terrible, as\r\ndestructive to life and happiness as those that result from unchastity?\r\nAnd is it not a crying sin, even if some of these fears are justified,\r\nto ruin both mentally and physically the whole race of women? * * * Man\r\ndemands from the girl of his choice, not chastity alone, but an\r\nabsolutely unblemished character. And rightly so. But the wife must\r\nshare her husband with street-walkers? She must bear the pangs of\r\nmaternity, while fortified by the terrible knowledge that the father of\r\nher children has wasted his youthful virility in purchased embraces,\r\nthat he has not recoiled from impurity, that he has exposed himself to\r\nthe risk of infection with the most horrible diseases, that he has\r\nsquandered his virginity in the most bestial sensuality? * * * We girls\r\nmust also be granted the right to demand from the man of our choice the\r\nsame purity, the same unspottedness by sensuality, that he so rigorously\r\ndemands from ourselves! We must no longer content ourselves with the\r\nremnants that are left for us by others! We must no longer be satisfied\r\nwith man’s moral inferiority! Then there will be more happiness, more\r\nlove, more health and joy of life!”\r\n\r\nThese accusations and demands so boldly made are not to be disposed of\r\nby mere mockery. With deep sorrow we must admit the absolute truth of\r\nthe charge that too many men clamber out of the abyss of debauchery to a\r\nblighted marriage. But the demand for equal moral rights, for the\r\nabandonment of the hitherto prevalent bisexual ethical standards, is in\r\nvain conflict with actuality, with the defensive instincts of young men,\r\nwith the difficulties entailed by the struggle for existence, with the\r\nincreasing pretensions (to sexual freedom) of women themselves; but\r\nabove all is it in conflict with the thousand-year-old notions of sexual\r\nhonor in the male and the female respectively, and with the undeniable\r\nfact that the mature man is capable of elevating himself out of the base\r\nintoxication of the senses characteristic of youth, to attain the\r\nnoblest and most intimate married love, whereas the girl who has once\r\ndescended into such an abyss sinks therein and is beyond the possibility\r\nof rescue. Thus early marriage with equal purity of husband and wife\r\nremains a postulate which the present can hardly be expected to satisfy,\r\nand one whose fulfilment must be left to the future.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of modern writings and discussions concerning the erotic\r\nproblem, there has arisen a hypersensibility on the part of women in\r\nrespect of the conditions in which they pass their married life, leading\r\nthem to demand greater independence, a greater expansion of their own\r\nindividuality; this tendency must, however, be resisted, if the marriage\r\nis to be a happy one, with mutual comfort and reciprocal consideration,\r\none suitable, not for exceptional beings in an ideal state, but for men\r\nand women as they really are. In such a marriage, affection and a sense\r\nof duty will strengthen love and preserve fidelity. A prudent, clever\r\nwoman will always understand how, notwithstanding all necessary\r\nself-surrender, to preserve the freedom of her own individuality and the\r\nesteem of her husband.\r\n\r\nMarriages based upon true inclination usually result in the birth of\r\nstronger and more beautiful children than marriages in which the\r\nmoney-bags were the sole or the principal determining cause. In England,\r\nwhere people commonly marry when still quite young, beautiful and\r\nhealthy children are more often seen than in France, where marriages of\r\nexpediency form the great majority. According to _Bertillon_, of 1,000\r\nyoung men from 20 to 25 years of age, in England 120 marry, but in\r\nFrance less than half that number, viz., 57 only. And 100 wives between\r\nthe ages of 15 and 40 give birth annually, in England to 39 children, in\r\nFrance to 26 only, a number less by one-third.\r\n\r\nIn deciding upon marriage, hereditary influences deserve careful\r\nconsideration in respect alike of the family of the prospective husband\r\nand that of the prospective wife. For it is well established that the\r\nlaw of inheritance relates not only to the peculiarities of external\r\nconfiguration, to the features, the stature, the tint of the skin, but\r\nalso that children inherit from their parents their mode of bodily\r\ndevelopment, the functional activity of their organs, the duration of\r\ntheir life, their predisposition to disease, and even their intellectual\r\nand moral qualities. As regards hereditary predisposition to disease,\r\nthe most important are, as is well known, the predisposition to\r\ntuberculosis, that to malignant tumors, and that to mental disorders.\r\n\r\nGreat disparity in the respective ages of prospective husband and wife\r\nentail various kinds of unsuitability for marriage. An elderly man who\r\nmarries a young girl, even if he still possesses a certain amount of\r\nvirility, is unlikely to procreate healthy and powerful children; and\r\nthese latter for the most part will be weakly, scrofulous cachectic,\r\nendowed with deficient powers of resistance, and often badly equipped\r\nfrom the intellectual standpoint. Similar considerations prevail in\r\nrespect of marriages in which the husband has been exhausted by earlier\r\nsexual excesses, so that he retains no more than remnants of virility,\r\nwhilst his semen is of doubtful fertilizing power. _D. Richard_ relates\r\nthat Louis XIV asked his physician why it was that the children he (the\r\nking) had by his wife were delicate and deformed, whilst those he had by\r\nhis mistresses were beautiful and powerful. “Sire,” was the answer,\r\n“c’est parce que vous ne donnez à la reine que les rincures.”\r\n\r\n_Plato_ maintains that before every marriage the man and the woman\r\nshould both undergo official examination to determine their fitness or\r\nunfitness for the married state, the man being absolutely nude, and the\r\nwoman stripped to the waist, for the examination. This author goes so\r\nfar as to regard it as “a form of homicide for a man to embrace a woman\r\nwhen he is incapable of fertilizing her.” How rarely it happens in our\r\nday, however, that the physician, the official with the requisite\r\nknowledge to fulfil _Plato’s_ requirements, is asked for his opinion\r\nregarding the desirability of a contemplated marriage! The only occasion\r\non which this is likely to occur is when a man intending to marry wishes\r\nto be assured that he is completely cured from an earlier infection with\r\nsyphilis, and, therefore, runs no risk of transmitting the disease to\r\nhis wife or to possible offspring. But it never occurs to the parents of\r\na girl about to marry to ask the physician whether she is physically\r\nsuitable for marriage.\r\n\r\nIn deciding on marriage, however, care should before all be taken to\r\ndetermine that the girl has attained complete physical and especially\r\ncomplete sexual development. The age at which woman attains complete\r\nsexual maturity is in our climate and race coincident on the average\r\nwith the twentieth year of life.\r\n\r\nFor the hygiene of marriage it is necessary that the bride should not be\r\nextremely youthful. Notwithstanding the fact that the legal codes of\r\ncivilized countries nowhere demand for girls a greater age than fifteen\r\nyears before permitting marriage, this limit is, generally speaking,\r\nfixed far too low. Before becoming a wife, the girl should not merely\r\nhave attained complete physical development, with her reproductive\r\norgans in a state of maturity, but she must also be developed\r\nintellectually to such an extent that she is fully capable of\r\nunderstanding the nature and significance of marriage. At the age at\r\nwhich marriage is legally permissible, a girl is still far from having\r\nattained physical and mental ripeness for marriage, reproduction, and\r\nmaternity.\r\n\r\nEspecially with reference to the last consideration is it inadvisable\r\nthat in our climates a girl should marry earlier than from 18 to 20\r\nyears of age, and preferably even she should first attain the age of\r\nfrom 20 to 22. In that case her happiness as a mother will be more\r\nsecure, and there will be a greater probability of her producing a\r\nhealthy progeny. In the East, indeed, quite different views prevail.\r\nAccording to the laws of _Manus_, a girl might marry on attaining the\r\nage of eight years; if within three years thereafter her father failed\r\nto provide her with a husband, she might choose one for herself. Among\r\nthe Hindus it is regarded as a disgrace to the parents if a girl does\r\nnot marry quite young, indeed before the first appearance of\r\nmenstruation. _Atri_ and _Kasypa_ state that if a girl begins to\r\nmenstruate before she leaves her father’s house, the latter must be\r\npunished as if he had destroyed a fœtus, while the daughter herself\r\nloses caste. Marriage delayed till after the appearance of menstruation\r\nbeing regarded as sinful, girls are married while still children, in\r\norder to prevent the loss of mature ova, which is regarded as equivalent\r\nto infanticide. Very early marriage has thus in India been legally\r\nordained for thousands of years. The Hindus, who even now regard every\r\nmenstruation which has not been preceded by coitus in the light of\r\ninfanticide, marry their daughters before the age of puberty.\r\n\r\nAccording to oriental tradition, Mahomet married Khadijah when five\r\nyears of age, and cohabited with her three years later. In the Bible,\r\nnumerous similar examples are recorded. Among many savage tribes, as,\r\nfor instance, among some of the aborigines of India, and among the\r\nindigens of Australia, copulation is usually effected before girls reach\r\nthe age of puberty; in India, indeed, according to _Ploss_ and _Bartels_\r\n(_Das Weib in der Natur und Völkerkunde_), marriage with immature girls\r\nis a widely diffused custom, and in Australia a child of ten or eleven\r\nis often found to be the wife of a man of fifty or the concubine of a\r\nsailor. In general, according to these authors, we find that the age of\r\nnubility in girls is lower in proportion to the lowness of the stage of\r\ncivilization attained by the race or people to which they belong. Among\r\nthe ancient Romans, girls were commonly married between the ages of\r\nthirteen and sixteen years.\r\n\r\nIn the Talmud, _Rabbi Joshua_ gives the following advice regarding early\r\nmarriage in Jewish girls: “If your daughter has attained puberty and is\r\ntwelve years and six months old, she must be married at any cost. If no\r\nother means are available, manumit one of your slaves, and give her to\r\nthe freedman to wife.”\r\n\r\nExperience proves, however, that in our climate, at any rate, girls who\r\nmarry at a very early age are inferior in fertility to those who refrain\r\nfrom marriage until the genital organs have attained complete maturity;\r\nand statistics show that those women who marry before attaining the age\r\nof twenty must wait longer for their first pregnancy than those who\r\nmarry between the ages of twenty and twenty-four. At the higher age\r\nalso, women bear parturition and its consequences more easily than those\r\nwho marry very young. A similar influence in marriage to that resulting\r\nfrom undue juvenility is exercised by its opposite, marriage when a\r\nwoman is already elderly; in this case fertility is limited, and health\r\nalso is especially apt to suffer. When the indications of the\r\nclimacteric are clearly apparent, marriage is contra-indicated, not only\r\non account of the impossibility of fertilization, but also in respect of\r\nits general unsuitability in the closing stage of the sexual life.\r\n\r\nNot only is the absolute age of the woman of importance in deciding on\r\nthe advisability of marriage, but the relative ages of the proposed\r\nhusband and wife must also be taken into account, first of all in\r\nrespect of the wife’s possible fertility, and secondly in respect of her\r\ngeneral health. The most suitable arrangement is that in which there is\r\nno marked difference in age. The husband may be, and indeed in existing\r\nsocial circumstances almost necessarily is, somewhat older than his\r\nwife, as much perhaps as eight or ten years. But a very great disparity\r\nof age (in either direction) is a serious error. If a very young girl\r\nmarries an elderly man, or a developed matron marries a young man, the\r\ntrue purpose of marriage is unfulfilled, the eternal laws of nature and\r\nall ethical principles are infringed. In the breeding of animals, the\r\nfundamental principle has long prevailed that the animals chosen for\r\ncoupling should be well suited each to the other and should be in\r\nperfect physical condition; and breeders are also familiar both with the\r\nfavorable influence of good nourishment and with the advantage of the\r\nopportune crossing of distinct varieties. The same principles are\r\nequally applicable to the human race, neglected as they commonly are in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the marriage of near kin, we can only remark that the\r\nmarriage of those closely related by blood should as far as possible be\r\navoided, and that such a marriage must be absolutely prohibited when in\r\nboth families there is a history of tuberculosis, mental disorders,\r\ndiabetes, and the like. When first cousins contemplate marriage, it is\r\nindispensable, not only that both individuals should be in perfect\r\nhealth, but also that on neither side there should be any serious family\r\nhistory of transmissible disease or transmissible morbid tendency; and,\r\nfurther, it is absolutely necessary that no such marriage of near kin\r\nshould have taken place in the proximate ancestry of the cousins, _i.\r\ne._, their cousinship must not be a double one, derived both from the\r\npaternal side and the maternal. It is indeed to be recommended, with a\r\nview to the production of a healthy and powerful posterity, that\r\nmarriage should bring about a crossing of healthy individuals proceeding\r\nfrom different families, different places, and different constitutional\r\ntypes. An instance of the advantage to be found in this practice is\r\npointed out by _Ribbing_, who shows that the most powerful aristocracy\r\nin Europe, that of England, by the gradual creation of new peers, on the\r\none hand, and by the gradual decline of younger sons and their\r\ndescendants into the middle class, on the other, has undergone a\r\ncontinual crossing with less exalted but originally sounder stocks; in\r\nthis way its vigor and fertility have been maintained, in contrast to\r\nthe nobility of many continental states, which has so largely perished,\r\nin consequence of its exclusiveness in the matter of marriage.\r\n\r\n“In this connection,” continues _Ribbing_, “we must bear in mind, that\r\nblood-relationship is not the only matter that has to be considered; in\r\nthe interest alike of the family, and of society, it is necessary to\r\ndemand that certain degrees of relationship by marriage alone, should\r\nfall within the ‘prohibited degrees’ of love and marriage. There are\r\ncertain groups related by marriage and held together by the bond of\r\naffection, from which foster-parents and guardians may most suitably be\r\nselected to fulfil the duties as regards education and training of\r\nchildren who have been orphaned in early years. For such a purpose none\r\nseem better adapted than the brothers and sisters of the deceased\r\nparents; but the upbringing of the children can be confidently entrusted\r\nto the former only if the relationship between the older and the younger\r\nbranches of the family is one regarded by law, and still more by\r\nmorality and custom, as one precluding the possibility of the occurrence\r\nof sexual love and marriage.”\r\n\r\n_Möbius_, writing on “The Ennobling of the Human Race by Selection in\r\nMarriage,” observes: “The most important aim of natural development is\r\nthe perfection of humanity. The qualities of the coming generation\r\ndepend for the most part upon the qualities of the parents. Marriage\r\nfrom affection ensures the fulfilment of nature’s aims with more\r\nsecurity than marriage from reason; since what we have to think of is\r\nnot the happiness of the married pair but the quality of their children.\r\nOf great importance, also, to the development of the human race are the\r\nconditions during the commencement of life, and the mode of education.\r\nThe improvement of the race has not hitherto been the conscious aim of\r\nthe generality of people. The law does not as yet, as it should, take\r\ninto account the advantage of posterity. Capital punishment is fully\r\njustified and purposive. Criminals should not be allowed to marry. The\r\nperpetuation of disease by inheritance should be checked by the utmost\r\npowers of the state. Any one marrying while suffering from any venereal\r\ndisease still in an infective condition should be punished. The marriage\r\nof persons suffering from tuberculosis should be prohibited. For the\r\nprevention of disease is more important than its cure. The most\r\nimportant factor in preventive medicine is an improvement in the\r\nconditions of life. The human ideal should be, goodness of heart in\r\nassociation with physical and mental health. Goodness, beauty, and\r\nstrength should be simultaneously pursued. Since, however, man is made\r\nby birth far more than by education, selection in marriage is of\r\nfundamental importance. In the choice of a partner, attention is rightly\r\npaid to beauty, since beauty and health are fundamentally identical;\r\nmoreover, a human being endowed with beauty is usually also more moral\r\nthan one devoid of that attribute. Equality of birth is as a rule\r\ndesirable in marriage; but not the family only is to be considered in\r\ndetermining the existence of such equality, individual characteristics\r\nmust likewise be taken into account. Whether the crossing of races is\r\ndesirable is not yet certainly determined.”\r\n\r\nFrom the hygienic standpoint it is necessary that in marriage also the\r\nfrequency and the manner of sexual intercourse should be regulated.\r\n\r\nWise men and lawgivers of all the nations of antiquity have insisted\r\nupon the necessity of certain intervals between the acts of intercourse.\r\nThus, _Mahomet_ prescribed 8 days, _Zoroaster_ 9 days, _Solon_ 10 days,\r\n_Socrates_ also 10 days. _Moses_ forbade intercourse during menstruation\r\nand for a week after the cessation of the flow. _Luther_ prescribed\r\nintercourse “twice a week.”\r\n\r\nBirds and many mammals are competent to perform intercourse at\r\nexceedingly short intervals. A well-bred cock will repeat this act 50\r\ntimes daily; a sparrow, 20 times in an hour; a bull, 3 to 4 times in an\r\nhour. In the human species, however, too rapid repetition of intercourse\r\nis deleterious not only to the male, but to the female also, though the\r\nlatter certainly suffers in less degree. For in this act the female\r\nplays a more passive part, and for this reason can repeat it with\r\nimpunity more frequently than the male, who loses semen at each\r\nrepetition. It is not possible, however, to lay down precise rules as to\r\nthe permissible frequency of intercourse in either sex; the matter must\r\ndepend upon physical needs. Moderate and regular indulgence in sexual\r\nintercourse is unquestionably advantageous to women both physically and\r\nmentally, regulating all the functions of the body, and tending to\r\nproduce a contented and cheerful frame of mind.\r\n\r\nDuring menstruation, a woman should refrain from intercourse. By the\r\nMosaic law the death punishment was allotted both to the man and to the\r\nwoman who indulged in coitus while the latter was menstruating. As a\r\nmatter of fact, considerations alike of hygienic cleanliness and of\r\nsanitary precaution prohibit the performance of coitus during this\r\nperiod. Severe menorrhagia, perimetritic irritation, and parametritic\r\ninflammations, have been observed to follow such indiscretions. On the\r\nother hand, it is more than doubtful whether, in the event of pregnancy\r\nresulting from intercourse performed during menstruation (and conception\r\nis especially apt to occur at this time), the child is likely, as\r\nearlier authors maintained, to be unfavorably affected, and to suffer\r\nfrom cachexia, scrofula, or rickets.\r\n\r\nAfter the act of intercourse, a woman should rest; and indeed sleep for\r\nsome hours is especially to be recommended. A vaginal douche should not\r\nbe administered until several hours have elapsed, otherwise there will\r\nbe a risk of preventing fertilization of the ovum. The water employed\r\nfor vaginal irrigation should never be quite cold; a temperature of\r\n79°–82° F. (26°–28° C.) is best.\r\n\r\nAll measures for the purpose of artificially increasing sexual desire,\r\nsuch as alcoholic beverages (especially champagne), and certain drugs\r\n(especially cantharides), are even more harmful to women than they are\r\nto men. The woman who conceives while in a state of intoxication commits\r\na great sin against the coming generation.[44] Just as harmful, however,\r\nare the anaphrodisiacs sometimes employed to diminish the intensity of\r\nsexual desire when this cannot be gratified. When affected with intense\r\nsexual excitement, a woman is much more unfavorably situated than a man,\r\nsince man claims the right to indulge in sexual intercourse whenever he\r\nfeels disposed, and has, moreover, ample opportunity for sexual\r\ngratification. A woman, however, properly endowed with self-respect,\r\nwill understand how to bridle her senses. Bodily exercise, moderate,\r\nunstimulating diet, intellectual occupation with serious matters, the\r\navoidance of equivocal literature and of sensual dramatic\r\nrepresentations, cold bathing, and the use of a hard mattress and light\r\nbed-clothing—these means will coöperate powerfully toward the prevention\r\nof excessive sexual desire. _Horace_ already remarked: “Otia si tolles,\r\nperiere Cupidinis arcus.”\r\n\r\nThe wife should know how to bridle, not her own desires only, but also\r\nthose of her husband. She must not demand too much during the\r\nintoxication of youthful vigor; she must prevent the complete combustion\r\nof the flames of masculine passion, and must keep sparks glowing in the\r\nashes. Economy during the sexual prime preserves sexual power, enables a\r\nman to continue intercourse to a ripe age, and avoids premature\r\nexhaustion and satiety. When the husband is drawing near the end of his\r\nsixth decade, the wife must accustom herself to see in him rather the\r\nfather of her children than her own husband, and must reduce her sexual\r\ndemands to that measure which will not be injurious to his health.\r\n_Demosthenes_, writing of the sexual life of the Athenians of his time,\r\nsaid: “In order to obtain legitimate offspring and to provide a faithful\r\nguardian of our household, we marry a wife; for our service and for the\r\nperformance of daily household duties, we keep concubines; for the joys\r\nof love, we seek the hetairai.” The task is extremely difficult, but a\r\nclever and virtuous modern wife must endeavor to combine in her single\r\npersonality the sensual attractiveness of an Aspasia, the chastity of a\r\nLucrece, and the intellectual greatness of a Cornelia; she must bear in\r\nmind the epigram of _Bacon_, “A wife must be a young man’s mistress, a\r\nmiddle-aged man’s companion, an old man’s nurse.”\r\n\r\nIn the act of intercourse the woman must always play the more passive\r\npart; she must be desired, rather than desire. Woman’s modesty increases\r\nman’s desire. By this coquetry, permissible because natural, the woman\r\ncan bind the man to herself, and can give the lie to the assertion that\r\nmarriage is the grave of love. Partial concealment of her desire on the\r\npart of the woman is more stimulating to the man than an open\r\nmanifestation of the sexual impulse; and a certain amount of modest\r\nreluctance is more alluring to him than a plain invitation. Plenty of\r\nroom must be left for the play of fancy and imagination. _Schiller_\r\nmakes Fiesco say to the Countess Julia, as he covers up her bosom, “The\r\nsenses must be blind letter-carriers only, and must not be aware of that\r\nwhich nature and the imagination communicate each to the other. The best\r\nof news is stale as soon as it has become the talk of the town.”\r\n\r\nFor this reason, also, it is more suitable that intercourse should take\r\nplace, not by day, consequent on the brutal prompting of vision, but by\r\nnight only, beneath the protecting veil of darkness. A night’s rest,\r\nmoreover, will serve to restore the exhausted nerves, and to replace the\r\nexpended secretions. Less advisable is coitus in the morning, on awaking\r\nfrom sleep, since the labors of the day must immediately thereafter be\r\nundertaken. Partially impotent men only, who wake up with an erected\r\npenis, endeavour to avail themselves without delay of this favorable\r\nopportunity, bearing in mind the French proverb, “On aime quand on peut,\r\net non pas quand on veut.”\r\n\r\nThe French custom, in accordance with which the married pair sleep\r\ntogether in a double-bed is undesirable on several hygienic grounds,\r\nand, in the first place, for the reason that this continuous nocturnal\r\nproximity is likely to give rise to the habit of indulging in\r\nexcessively frequent acts of intercourse. The best and most affectionate\r\nof men has neither disposition nor capacity to play the part of Romeo\r\nevery night, and thus the value and enjoyment of marital duties becomes\r\nlessened. The fulfilment of his desires should not be rendered quite so\r\neasy to the husband; he should always appear the lover, one who seeks a\r\nwoman’s favours because he longs for her; he should not be the master,\r\nexacting an unquestioned right. For this reason, separate beds are\r\nadvisable for the married pair, and, when possible, even separate\r\nbedrooms.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancients, _Lycurgus_, the Spartan law-giver, regarded\r\nmaternity as woman’s principal attribute, and considered the sexual\r\nimpulse to be the means merely by which healthy citizens were provided\r\nfor the state. In accordance with this view, the sanctity of marriage\r\nwas violated, and every powerful, handsome, and valiant Spartan had the\r\nright to request the privilege of intercourse with the wife of another,\r\nin order to enrich that other’s family with his seed. Elderly, impotent\r\nmen conducted well-formed young men into the arms of their own wives.\r\nThe girls, like the young men, went through a course of gymnastic\r\nexercises, in order to harden their bodies, and to fit them for the\r\nbearing of strong and healthy children. No man might marry before\r\nattaining the age of thirty, no woman before attaining the age of\r\ntwenty. Girls ripe for marriage were assembled in a dark place, and\r\nthere the young men chose their brides, as chance might direct. The\r\nyoung men were allowed to visit their wives by night only, and secretly,\r\nin order that the vigor of the sexual impulse might be increased and\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nAmong the Spartans, it happened quite frequently, that a man whose wife\r\nhad remained childless, and who believed himself to be at fault in the\r\nmatter, would beg one of his fellow-countrymen, or even a foreigner, to\r\ncome to his assistance. It was enacted by one of Solon’s laws, to\r\nprevent a man from neglecting his marital duties, that he should have\r\nintercourse with his wife not less than three times monthly. According\r\nto another of Solon’s laws, an Athenian heiress might call upon her\r\nnearest relative for the gratification of her sexual desires.\r\n\r\nThe bluntest contrast to this Spartan simplicity is furnished by the\r\nunbridled lasciviousness that prevailed in Rome under the Cæsars, when\r\nwomen’s sole desire was sexual enjoyment, while maternity was a state to\r\nbe avoided. To such an extreme was this carried, that the Roman ladies\r\nof that day preferred to marry eunuchs, and further, as _Pliny_ reports,\r\nhermaphrodites were in great request. _Juvenal_ writes: “There are women\r\nwho prize the infertile embraces of base eunuchs; thus they are able to\r\ndispense with the use of abortifacients.”\r\n\r\nThe hygiene of the nuptial night deserves from the physician more\r\nattention than it has hitherto generally received. He should warn and\r\nenlighten the young husband, in order that the brutality with which the\r\nact of defloration is apt to be performed may be lessened, and further\r\nin order that mistakes in this connection, resulting from ignorance and\r\nlikely to have serious consequences, may be avoided. It is well known\r\nthat lacerations of the hymen and its environment, and even serious\r\ninjuries of the genital organs, may result from maladroit attempts at\r\npenetration. The physician will admonish the husband in the words of\r\n_Michelet_: “Bear in mind in this hour that thou art an enemy, a tender,\r\nconsiderate, and gentle enemy!”\r\n\r\nThe young woman entering upon marriage should receive instruction from\r\nher mother regarding all the sexual processes of copulation, instruction\r\nat once earnest and complete. By such enlightenment, the young bride\r\nwill be spared much suffering, and a sudden disillusionment which might\r\nseriously affect the whole of her future life will be avoided; complete\r\nignorance, on the other hand may lead, not merely to needless mental and\r\nphysical suffering, but to the most tragic consequences on the bridal\r\nnight. In one case known to me, the young wife, who before marriage was\r\nutterly ignorant of the nature of physical love, was so completely\r\noverwhelmed in her ideals by the somewhat energetic procedure of the\r\nbridegroom as soon as he found himself alone with his wife, that she\r\nfled from her new home then and there in the night, and by no\r\npersuasions could be induced to return.\r\n\r\nIn that decisive moment in which the maiden loses her virginity, she\r\nmust find in her husband, not the brutal man who forcibly takes\r\npossession of her body, but the chosen man of all, to whom her love can\r\nrefuse nothing.\r\n\r\n“Delicate foresight and restraint,” writes _Ribbing_, “are needful above\r\nall at the commencement of married life. The young wife, coming to the\r\nbridal bed a pure virgin, is not, like her husband, fully prepared for\r\nwhat is to take place. In all cases she is somewhat fearful of the new\r\nexperience. The first act of intercourse involves for her a certain\r\namount of pain, and this pain is not solely physical. * * * Moreover, we\r\nmust remember that the entire change in her mode of life makes a deep\r\nimpression upon a woman’s mind; time and quiet are needed before she can\r\nfind herself at home in the novel surroundings, before she can adapt to\r\nthe changed circumstances her moral and religious convictions, and\r\nbefore she can ‘think true love acted simple modesty’ (Romeo and Juliet,\r\nIII, 2.16). Impatient husbands, through want of knowledge and lack of\r\nconsideration during the honeymoon, have often ruined the happiness of\r\nsubsequent married life.”\r\n\r\nIt happens often, unfortunately, that the wife has reason to complain of\r\nthe reckless manner in which her husband has used, or misused, his\r\nsexual powers. Frequently enough, on the bridal night, the man proceeds\r\nwith such violence in his assault on the virgin reproductive organs of\r\nhis newly-wedded wife, that we must actually speak of him as ravishing\r\nan ignorant and timid girl. Later, when the stimulus of novelty has\r\npassed away, the husband often performs intercourse in a manner more\r\ncalculated to awaken his wife’s sexual desires, but in seeking his own\r\nlordly gratification and obtaining it he is still apt to leave out of\r\nthe reckoning the need for effecting coitus in such a way as will give\r\ncomplete satisfaction also to his wife.\r\n\r\nThe wedding journey likewise deserves consideration from the hygienic\r\nstandpoint. Much is to be said in favor of such a journey, inasmuch as\r\nit endows the necessarily somewhat brutal first act of intercourse with\r\nan aspect of romance. The removal to a foreign country, to a strange\r\nenvironment, will spare the chaste maiden much shame and vexation. On\r\nthe journey, moreover, the young couple are much in each other’s\r\ncompany, and the process of mutual adaptation is agreeably favored. And\r\nyet this modern custom of making a wedding journey entails certain\r\nserious disadvantages. The young woman leaves her home and her nearest\r\nrelatives, and is in a moment involved in the excitement of travel, an\r\nexcitement liable to increase to the degree of morbid anxiety. The\r\nfatigues of railway-travel, of wandering about strange towns, of visits\r\nto museums and picture-galleries, are apt to cause general loss of\r\nnervous tone, and also local hyperæmia of the genital organs. In\r\naddition, false modesty and the prescribed arrangements for the journey\r\nmay lead the onset of menstruation to be ignored and the customary rest\r\nat this period to be dispensed with. Still more, the possibility of the\r\noccurrence of conception and of the commencement of pregnancy is usually\r\nleft altogether out of the account. Many an attack of menorrhagia, of\r\nperimetritis, and of endometritis, many a miscarriage, and many\r\ninstances of protracted sterility, are dependent upon the hygienic\r\nmistakes of the wedding journey, and less, indeed, upon the abuses\r\narising out of the intoxication of passion, than upon the fatigues of\r\nexcessive travel both by day and by night. The bride who on her\r\nwedding-day was young, healthy, and full of vitality, not infrequently\r\nreturns from the wedding journey a sickly and debilitated woman.\r\n\r\nWith regard to wedding journeys in relation to the causation of chronic\r\nmetritis, _Scanzoni_ has expressed an authoritative opinion. “After many\r\nweeks of unsatisfied sexual desire, the young married pair, now freed\r\nfrom all restraint, give themselves up to the joys of love; the intense\r\nsexual excitement causes great stimulation and hyperæmia of the female\r\nsexual organs; in addition, the noxious influences of travel make\r\nthemselves felt, and also hygienic indiscretions are perpetrated,\r\ndependent upon the young wife’s modesty; it is, therefore, by no means\r\nto be wondered at that, having left home a perfectly healthy woman, she\r\nreturns from her wedding journey with the germs of an illness from which\r\nshe never fully recovers, and which is the source of unending suffering,\r\nand more particularly of a sterile marriage.”\r\n\r\nSexual hygiene demands a certain moderation in the enjoyment of physical\r\nlove, and also a certain constancy, such as may be expected in a happy\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to lay down a general rule with regard to the\r\nfrequency of sexual intercourse, notwithstanding the earnestness with\r\nwhich religious zealots, physicians, and moral teachers have in all ages\r\nendeavored to determine how often it was proper for a man to cohabit\r\nwith his wife. The rules that have been prescribed by the various\r\nauthorities had in view, for the most part, the protection of the wife\r\nfrom excessive demands on the part of her husband; sometimes, however,\r\nby the establishment of a minimum period, a certain amount of sexual\r\ngratification was secured to the wife; finally, also, the generation of\r\na healthy posterity had to be taken into consideration. _Ribbing_,\r\nhowever, justly observes: “Sexual intercourse results from a natural\r\nimpulse, and he whose senses are unimpaired, and who has learned, at the\r\nsame time, amid the tumult of his sensations, to preserve proper\r\nconsideration for his wife—such a man runs little danger of making any\r\nmistake. In opposition to the opinion of many, I regard it as entirely\r\nright and reasonable that husband and wife should have intercourse\r\nwhenever physically and mentally impelled to that act. Nor do I see any\r\nreason why, during the first period in which they are able to enjoy\r\nwithout intermission the pleasures of sexual intercourse, they should,\r\nin accordance with any theory whatever, impose on themselves further\r\nrestraints than those demanded by care for their physical and mental\r\nhealth. The touchstone of marital hygiene is this, that on the day\r\nfollowing intercourse both husband and wife should feel perfectly fresh,\r\nvigorous, and lively, alike in body and mind—even more so, perhaps, than\r\non other days. In the absence of such feelings, we may feel assured of\r\nthe occurrence of sexual excesses.” The same author quotes a saying of\r\n_Pomeroy’s_: “We may quaff the nectar as freely as we will—nature\r\nherself mixes the draught and holds the goblet to our lips; if, however,\r\nwe drink too much, she first dilutes the draught with water, later adds\r\ngall, and ultimately perhaps deadly poison.”\r\n\r\nThe occupation, trade, or profession, and the nutritive condition and\r\nphysical constitution of the married pair, have an important bearing on\r\nthe frequency with which, without detriment to health, cohabitation is\r\npermissible. The rules of the Hebrew Talmud already take these\r\ncircumstances into account, ordering as they do that young and powerful\r\nmen not engaged in any regular occupation shall have intercourse with\r\ntheir wives daily; manual labourers, on the other hand, once a week\r\nonly; whilst brain-workers, finally, or those whose work is extremely\r\narduous, should allow an interval of one or more months to elapse\r\nbetween the acts of intercourse. _Acton_ also prescribes that in the\r\ncase of brain-workers and of those manual workers whose labours are\r\nexhausting, intercourse must not occur more frequently than once every\r\nweek or ten days.\r\n\r\nThe married couple should understand how to impose on themselves a\r\ncertain restraint in the matter of marital intercourse, without,\r\nhowever, going so far as on altogether trifling grounds to refuse the\r\nhusband access to his wife. In this respect also, the opinions that have\r\nrecently come to prevail concerning the rights of women have had an\r\ninfluence. _W. Acton_ relates a case that came under his observation in\r\nwhich the wife refused to allow her husband any voice in determining\r\nwhen and how often intercourse should take place; the wife, she\r\nmaintained without hesitation, since she had to bear the consequences of\r\nintercourse, was fully justified, whenever she thought fit, in refusing\r\nher husband’s embraces.\r\n\r\nThe dangers to the sexual life of woman which are involved by the modern\r\nwoman’s rights agitation are seen already in the changes which the\r\nemancipation of women in North America has produced in the functions of\r\nwoman as wife and mother. In that part of the world, everything possible\r\nhas been done “to transform” (to quote the words of a brilliant\r\njournalist) “the doll into an independent existence, to enable the\r\nhelpless woman to earn her own subsistence, and the result of these\r\nendeavors has been most striking. The American woman has obtained the\r\nright to enter every profession and to follow every kind of occupation\r\nwhich have hitherto been reserved for men; she is physician, lawyer,\r\nmerchant, professor; her boudoir has become an office, often connected\r\nwith the stock exchange by a private wire. Legally, also, she now\r\npossesses the same rights as man; in many States she has both the\r\nsuffrage and the right of entering the house of representatives; she has\r\nfully emancipated herself from her former condition of tutelage, and in\r\nher shrillest tones can cry to heaven ‘I am free, I am independent, I am\r\nemancipated, I am myself!’ And observe, as the result of all these\r\nattempts at the conversion of woman into man, that in the matter of\r\nmarriage also she acts as if she were no longer woman. The American\r\nwoman no longer marries; perhaps, indeed, because she no longer has the\r\ncapacity. So long and so eagerly has she given herself up to masculine\r\noccupations, that her inward feminine nature has also perhaps undergone\r\ntransformation, so that she has become affected with a kind of neutral\r\nlack of desire. Unquestionably, the desire for marriage on the part of\r\nthis modern ‘emancipated’ woman has vanished in the most alarming\r\nmanner, there is a notable fall in the birth-rate, and the indigenous\r\n(white) population actually threatens to disappear.”\r\n\r\nThe wife acts wisely, not on hygienic grounds alone, in not always\r\nacceding at once and unconditionally to her husband’s demand for the\r\nrepetition of intercourse. Her modest reluctance enhances her\r\ndesirability in the eyes of her amorous husband. Thus, _Shakespeare_\r\nmakes Posthumus exclaim (Cymbeline, Act II., Sc. 5, l. 9):\r\n\r\n               “Me of my lawful pleasure she restrained\r\n               And prey’d me oft forbearance; did it with\r\n               A pudency so rosy the sweet view on’t\r\n               Might well have warmed Old Saturn.”\r\n\r\nEspecially justified is such refusal when coitus has been already once\r\nor twice performed, or when the consumption of alcoholic beverages has\r\nmade the husband unduly lustful. On the other hand, the refusal of\r\nintercourse when demanded by the husband should never depend upon\r\nbaseless feminine caprice, or upon the now so frequently asserted\r\n“rights of women.”\r\n\r\nExperience has long ago established as a fact that unduly frequent\r\nsatisfaction of the sexual impulse entails serious consequences to the\r\nhealth of the individual. And in the case of the wife these consequences\r\nmay be especially disastrous when intercourse is indulged in recklessly\r\nduring menstruation, during all stages of pregnancy, and even during the\r\npuerperium. “Incontinence during menstruation leads to serious\r\ncirculatory disturbances and to the consequences of these disturbances;\r\nduring pregnancy it is likely to give rise to miscarriage; during the\r\npuerperium, to congestions and inflammations. Should conception occur as\r\na result of intercourse during the lying-in period (and this may happen\r\nvery shortly after childbirth), abortion, and even more serious\r\nconsequences, are likely to ensue. By intercourse during lactation, the\r\npremature recurrence of the menstrual flow is induced, and the gradual\r\nreversion of the reproductive apparatus to the condition in which it was\r\nbefore pregnancy (the process of involution) is hindered; moreover, the\r\nsecretion of milk is diminished or even entirely suppressed.” In these\r\nterms _Hegar_ depicts the consequences of premature resumption of\r\nmarital intercourse, taking perhaps a somewhat extreme view of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this author is undoubtedly right in declaring that one of\r\nthe principal disadvantages to a woman of excessively frequent sexual\r\nintercourse is that pregnancy occurs too often. It is astonishing to\r\nobserve the number of full-term deliveries and miscarriages that a woman\r\nwill experience within a comparatively short period of time, as is seen\r\ntoo frequently among the labouring classes and more especially among\r\nfactory workers. “If we assume the ordinary mortality of childbed to be\r\n6 per mille, a woman who in the course of 15 years undergoes labour (at\r\nfull term or prematurely) 16 times, runs a risk of death to be expressed\r\nby the ratio of 6 × 16 = 96 per mille; that is to say, on the average,\r\nof 1,000 women who become pregnant as often as this, nearly 1 in 10 will\r\ndie in childbed.”\r\n\r\nYoung men who have previously suffered from gonorrhœa and who wish to\r\nmarry, must, unless they wish to cause unspeakable misery, undergo an\r\nexact and thorough examination; not only must the physician inquire as\r\nto the presence of certain symptoms, such as smarting during\r\nmicturition, adhesion of the lips of the urethral meatus, “clap-threads”\r\nin the urine, etc., but during a considerable period of time repeated\r\nmicroscopical examinations of the urine must be undertaken, and the\r\nfilaments, if present, must be examined for gonococci. The physician\r\nwill also have to determine whether any vestiges remain of epididymitis,\r\nand whether the quality of the semen has been impaired by the attack of\r\ngonorrhœa. Unfortunately, it is not yet within our power absolutely to\r\nforbid marriage to a man exhibiting all the symptoms of chronic\r\ngonorrhœa; but it is the duty of the physician to explain to such a man\r\nthe scientific views regarding this matter that now prevail, in order to\r\nfurnish him with the grounds for a decision.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible, when discussing the hygiene of married life, to\r\npreserve silence respecting the extremely pressing question of the use\r\nof measures for the prevention of conception, for in recent years their\r\nuse has become extraordinarily general, chiefly, indeed, in the upper\r\nand middle classes of society, but to some extent also among the\r\nworking-class population. Although we devote a special chapter to this\r\ntopic, we must here express the opinion that, except in certain\r\ninstances in which their employment can be justified on carefully\r\nweighed and well-established medical grounds, the use of any mechanical\r\nor chemical means for the prevention of conception must be\r\ndiscountenanced as injurious to health. The wife who wishes to preserve\r\nher psychical purity and moral chastity, which is not only possible in\r\nmarriage but also greatly to be desired, must not concern herself much\r\nwith the technique of the sexual life, but must give herself up to\r\nsexual enjoyment only as the result of a delicate and immediate bodily\r\nand mental desire. Not only for reasons of national economy regarding\r\nthe means of providing for the family, but also for well-grounded\r\npersonal reasons regarding the wife’s health, must the latter be spared\r\nan unduly rapid succession of pregnancies and confinements. And this\r\nshould be effected by a certain degree of continence and by the\r\nobservation of extensive periods of sexual quiescence.\r\n\r\nTo preserve a woman’s health during the acme of her sexual activity, a\r\ncareful general hygiene is an important requisite. The dwelling should\r\nbe dry and roomy; above all the bedroom should not be too small, neither\r\ndamp nor dark, and it should be well ventilated. The wife’s occupations\r\nshould be so arranged as to afford a suitable alternation of activity\r\nand repose, and there should be as little night work as possible.\r\nCertain occupations are especially potent in the causation of the\r\ndiseases peculiar to women, principally, for the reason that they do not\r\npermit of the requisite repose during menstruation. Thus, washerwomen,\r\nvocalists, and sewing-machine operatives, suffer with especial frequency\r\nfrom diseases of the genital organs.\r\n\r\nGreat care in the cleansing of the genital organs is indispensable in\r\nthe case of women; the vulva and its environment should be frequently\r\nand carefully washed; and an occasional vaginal injection is\r\nadvantageous. As regards the last-named measure, however, we must point\r\nout that it is possible to err by excess as well as by defect, and that\r\na daily vaginal douche can by no means be regarded as a necessary part\r\nof the hygiene of the reproductive organs. For recent researches have\r\nshown, on the one hand, that the vagina constitutes a natural mechanism\r\nfor the destruction of pathogenic organisms, and on the other hand, that\r\ncomplete disinfection of the vagina is extremely difficult to effect.\r\nInflammations of the vulva, which are somewhat frequent in consequence\r\nof excessive perspiration and undue discharge from the genital canal,\r\ndemand careful cleansing with soap and water and the use of a soft\r\nbrush. The addition to the water of lysol (in the proportion of ¼ to ½\r\nper cent.) is advantageous. A general bath or a local sitz bath, the\r\nwater being moderately warm (95°–99° F.; 35°–37° C.), may be recommended\r\non grounds of beauty as well as of health, and should be taken at least\r\nonce a week.\r\n\r\nThe regular use of lukewarm sitz baths is a most valuable hygienic\r\nmeasure for the prevention of various general or local disturbances\r\nconsequent upon increased flow of blood to the genital organs. These\r\nlocal baths are best taken at a temperature of 95° F. (35° C.), and\r\nshould last twenty minutes; they should be taken just before going to\r\nbed, and while sitting in the hip bath the skin of the abdomen and of\r\nthe lower part of the back should be rubbed with the hand encased in a\r\nfriction-glove. The bather on leaving the bath should get straight into\r\nbed, and should dry herself beneath the bedclothes, rubbing the skin\r\ntill it glows. Such sitz baths serve also to keep the external genitals\r\nclean, and to guard against infection. For vaginal douching, water\r\nsterilized by boiling should be employed, and where any catarrh of the\r\nvaginal mucous membrane is present, some alum, permanganate of\r\npotassium, or boric acid may be added with advantage; the pressure of\r\nwater, when a vaginal douche is given, should never be high, the\r\nreservoir of the irrigator being raised not more than twenty inches\r\nabove the outlet of the nozzle; as a rule the water should be lukewarm;\r\nthe patient should be in the recumbent posture. The reservoir of the\r\nirrigator and the intra-vaginal nozzle are most suitably made of glass,\r\nto insure cleanliness; the nozzle should not be thrust too far in, two\r\ninches being quite sufficient. After the use of the douche, the woman\r\nshould remain ten or fifteen minutes in the recumbent posture.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the hygienic employment of such full baths and local\r\nbaths, a number of mineral baths have important therapeutic applications\r\nin cases of disease of the female genital organs, the traditional value\r\nof such baths having been scientifically endorsed by the modern science\r\nof balneo-therapeutics. By means of suitably selected mineral water\r\nbaths, a powerful derivative stimulus may be given to the skin, and the\r\naffected reproductive organs may thus be beneficially influenced.\r\nFurther, in acute inflammatory conditions or hyperæmia of the uterus or\r\nits annexa, these baths have an antiphlogistic influence; on the other\r\nhand, when intrapelvic exudations have formed, the baths promote the\r\nabsorption of these inflammatory products; again, in congestive states\r\nof the female genital organs, with relaxation, thickening, and\r\nhypersecretion of the genital mucous membrane, the baths have an\r\nastringent and tonic influence on the tissues; finally, they have a\r\nfavorable effect on the innervation and nutrition, not only of the\r\nreproductive apparatus, but of the entire organism. It is easy to\r\nunderstand why women during the menacme are frequent visitors to spas.\r\n\r\nAt this period of life, and especially in women who lead luxurious\r\n“society” lives, the thoughts tend strongly in the sexual direction; to\r\navoid this, and to prevent the ever more and more frequent breaches of\r\nmarital fidelity, the best means are the practice of vigorous bodily\r\nexercises, and active employment, either in household affairs or in\r\nintellectual occupations. Cold sponging of the body or cold full baths\r\nwill also be found an excellent measure for the prevention of sexual\r\nexcess. In such cases also the diet should be limited, strong and\r\nstimulating food should be avoided, but little butcher’s meat should be\r\ntaken, whilst green vegetables and raw and cooked fruits should be\r\nliberally consumed; at the same time, all alcoholic beverages must be\r\nrigidly prohibited. Moreover, care must be taken that during the night\r\nthere should be no undue physical stimulation in consequence of\r\nexcessively warm and soft bedding; hair mattresses are to be preferred\r\nto feather beds, with light down quilts for a covering. Finally, no\r\nstimulation of an erotic character should be offered to the imagination,\r\nand for this reason equivocal literature and lascivious dramatic\r\nrepresentations must be avoided. By a sufficiency of occupation,\r\nregular, interesting, and demanding a considerable expenditure of\r\nphysical energy, a woman may be enabled to a great extent to escape the\r\ninconvenience and distress attendant on entire or partial lack of\r\ngratification of the sexual impulse.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be disputed that a certain and moderate amount of sexual\r\ngratification is requisite for the perfect maintenance of physical\r\nhealth in woman, and that the absence of this gratification, or the\r\ngratification of the impulse in an abnormal or incomplete manner,\r\nentails disturbance of alike the mental and the physical equilibrium;\r\nbut, on the other hand, the deleterious consequences of sexual\r\nabstinence have been greatly exaggerated by many writers—both by\r\nphysicians and social economists. Owing to the fact that to the\r\ncultivated woman sexual gratification is possible only in the married\r\nstate, whilst social conditions render marriage impossible to many women\r\ngreatly in need of such gratification; in consequence, also, of the\r\nmodern and ever more widely diffused practice by husbands of coitus\r\ninterruptus altogether regardless of the woman’s need for complete\r\nsexual gratification—there arise in women numerous local disorders and\r\nnervous disturbances, hysteria and even insanity being results by no\r\nmeans infrequent. The significance of ungratified sexual impulse in the\r\npathogenesis of nervous disorders has been established by _von\r\nKrafft-Ebing_, who points out that in unmarried women insanity most\r\nfrequently occurs between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five years,\r\nduring the decade, that is to say, in which youthful bloom and the hopes\r\nof marriage simultaneously disappear; whereas in the male sex the\r\ngreatest incidence of insanity is between the ages of thirty-five and\r\nfifty years, the period of life in which the struggle for existence is\r\nfiercest.\r\n\r\n_Hegar_, on the other hand, is a firm opponent of the view that the\r\nfavourable influence of marriage is overrated. According to this author,\r\nthe favourable effect of marriage in respect of mental disorders is to\r\nbe found, not in the gratification of the sexual impulse, but in the\r\nethical factors of marriage. Statistics show that even in the favourable\r\ncircumstances of marriage, sexual gratification has in women an\r\nunfavourable influence, inasmuch as the proportion of sufferers from\r\nmental disorders is higher among married women than it is among married\r\nmen. A study of the mental disorders which in women are especially\r\nassociated with the process of reproduction (puerperal mania) confirms\r\nthis impression. _Hegar_ insists that he has never seen nymphomania\r\narise in women in consequence of forcible repression of the sexual\r\nimpulse; but that he has not infrequently seen this disorder result from\r\nunnatural excesses or from long-continued sexual irritation, especially\r\nin hereditarily predisposed persons. Such unnatural stimulation of the\r\nfemale is not infrequently practiced by the male—by the lover and even\r\nby the husband—it may be because he himself derives pleasure from such\r\nperverted practices, and wishes to obtain sexual gratification without\r\nthe risk of impregnation, or because he is himself incompetent for\r\nnormal complete intercourse. _Hegar_ is further of opinion that in the\r\ncausation of hysteria and also in that of chlorosis the repression of\r\nthe sexual impulse plays a quite subordinate rôle. And he regards as\r\npure fable the belief that continence in women is liable to lead to the\r\nformation of mammary, uterine, or ovarian tumors. He would more readily\r\nincline to the contrary opinion; the reproductive process being in this\r\nrespect distinctly disadvantageous to the female sex. The unfavorable\r\ninfluence of the reproductive process is shown most clearly in the case\r\nof carcinoma of the uterus; the majority of the patients suffering from\r\nthis disease are either married or widowed, and many of them have given\r\nbirth to a large number of children. “Gratification of the sexual\r\nimpulse, and more particularly the reproductive process, give rise in\r\nwomen to the formation and growth of tumors, cause numerous mechanical\r\ndisturbances, and open the way to infection with various pathogenic\r\norganisms.”\r\n\r\n_Hegar_ considers that there is hygienic justification for the\r\nlimitation of the number of children to which a woman gives birth. The\r\nmost suitable age for motherhood lies in his opinion between the ages of\r\ntwenty and forty years. Childbirth in women younger or older than this\r\nentails too much danger both to mother and child. At least two and a\r\nhalf years ought to elapse between two successive births; and these\r\nfigures give us eight as the maximum family. If we assume that the\r\nduration of pregnancy is nine months, and that of lactation nine to\r\ntwelve months (or in cases in which the mother does not nurse her own\r\ninfant, that a like period must be devoted to the careful supervision of\r\nthe wet-nurse or of the methods of artificial feeding), we cannot\r\nconsider it unreasonable to devote a further period of from six to nine\r\nmonths to the complete reestablishment of the woman’s health. “Moreover,\r\nwoman does not exist solely for the purpose of subserving during two\r\ndecades of her life the processes of reproduction. And to permit the\r\nmaximum number of children to be as great as eight, we must presuppose\r\nthat the woman is in perfect health, and that she lives in a perfectly\r\nhealthy environment. Any illness or infirmity which renders the duties\r\nof housekeeping and the rearing of the existing family unduly difficult,\r\nindicates the need for a further limitation of child-bearing. And if the\r\nreproductive function is to be rationally controlled, we must above all\r\nattend to the age and the health of the parents. Occupation, habitation,\r\nand general environment have also to be considered. The correct ideal is\r\nindeed not difficult to discover.”\r\n\r\n_Hegar_ concludes that strict moderation and even absolute continence in\r\nsexual matters are often, and for long periods of time, a pressing duty.\r\n“The numerous and various disasters which are brought upon the world by\r\nunbridled and unregulated sexual passion can be prevented only by\r\nenlightenment, moderation, and continence. If marriage were postponed\r\nuntil the attainment of complete physical maturity, in women till the\r\nage of 20, in men till the age of 25, while at the same time procreation\r\nwere no longer undertaken by women above the age of 40 or by men above\r\nthe age of 45 to 50 years; if, again, between successive pregnancies a\r\nsufficient pause for the woman’s recuperation were insisted upon, and\r\nintercurrent illnesses and states of debility were taken into account;\r\nand if, finally, sickly individuals, those hereditarily predisposed to\r\ndisease, and those in any way below par either mentally or physically,\r\nwere more than heretofore prevented from marrying; then the increase of\r\npopulation, which in Germany is unquestionably too rapid, would to some\r\nextent be checked. Thoroughgoing regulation of the reproductive process\r\nwill not, however, be thus attained without the adoption of a method of\r\nselection too rigorous for present-day notions; and for a further\r\nadvance we must in the meantime depend upon moderation and continence.”\r\nAs regards the modern demand of the “right to love,” the same\r\nexperienced gynecologist writes: “Whoever preaches to mankind the\r\ndoctrine that ‘a man sins against his own personality if he neglects to\r\nexercise every limb he possesses, and if he denies himself the\r\ngratification of every natural impulse,’ or the doctrine that ‘it is the\r\nduty of every human being to gratify all his natural impulses, since\r\nthese are most intimately inter-connected with his personality—are\r\nindeed his personality itself;’ such a preacher does harm to his kind.\r\nSuch rights and such duties are chimerical for this reason if for no\r\nother, because two persons are necessary in the case of sexual\r\ngratification, and sometimes—though not as often as might be wished—Hans\r\nfails to find his Grete, without any consequent loss to society at\r\nlarge.”\r\n\r\nAn especially important chapter in the history of woman at this period\r\nof life relates to the dietetics of pregnancy and parturition, and to\r\nthe regulations to be observed for the maintenance of health at this\r\ntime and in connection with the processes of pregnancy, parturition,\r\npuerperal involution of the uterus, and lactation. This subject cannot\r\nnow however be considered at length, and for our present purposes it is\r\nsufficient to point out how important it is alike for mother and child,\r\nalike for family and society, that the ever more and more widely and\r\ngenerally diffused practice of the artificial feeding of infants should\r\nbe abandoned, and that there should be a return to the natural method\r\naccording to which each mother nurses her own infant. The prevailing\r\ncustom costs every year thousands of mothers their health, and thousands\r\nof children their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       COPULATION AND CONCEPTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Copulation._\r\n\r\nThe reproduction of the species is effected by means of an act of\r\ncopulation on the part of a male and a female individual, both of whom\r\nmust have attained complete sexual development. In all the sequence of\r\nreproductive processes it is copulation alone that is a voluntary act,\r\nall the other processes being independent of the will and even of\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nA characteristic difference between man and the lower animals lies in\r\nthe fact that in the human species sexual pleasure and the act of\r\ncopulation may occur at any season of the year; and a further\r\ncharacteristic difference may perhaps be found in the fact that in the\r\ngreat majority of individuals of the human species the psychical process\r\nof “love” plays a determinative part. _Voltaire_ pointed out that to man\r\nalone among animals are known the embrace and the joy of the kiss.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the kiss is depicted by _Grillparzer_ in the\r\nfollowing verses:\r\n\r\n                    Auf die Hände küsst die Achtung,\r\n                    Auf die Wangen Wohlgefallen,\r\n                    Seelige Liebe auf den Mund.\r\n                    Auf den Nacken das Verlangen;\r\n                    Uberall sonsthin Raserei.[45]\r\n\r\nIn this act of conjugation between two individuals of the same species,\r\ndifferentiated each from the other by the characteristics of sex, the\r\nactive, provocative rôle is allotted to the male, the passive, receptive\r\nrôle, to the female. The modest and coy reluctance characteristic alike\r\nof the maiden and of the wife, promote an increase of sexual excitement\r\nin the opposite sex, and this not only in a man of purely sensual\r\ncharacter, whose vanity is stimulated by his being the chosen one among\r\nmany—a circumstance which, in view of the great dependence of the sexual\r\nact upon psychical processes and imaginative influences, is by no means\r\ndevoid of importance. The woman’s coy reluctance must be overcome by\r\nmeans of a tender strategy before she is willing to grant the final\r\npossession of her body; and the act of copulation forms at the same time\r\nthe conclusion of the physical and mental yearnings of the lover, and\r\nthe commencement of the new-coming being. There is thus a physiological\r\nreason for the advice given by the celebrated surgeon, _Ambroise Paré_,\r\nthat a man, before completing coitus, should employ some of the delicate\r\nand sensually stimulating manipulations of the earlier stages of\r\ncourtship, for, he writes, “aucunes femmes ne sont pas si promptes à ce\r\njeu que les hommes.”\r\n\r\nThe potency for intercourse of the sexually mature man, his capacity for\r\nthe introduction of the erect penis during the act of copulation, is\r\ndependent on the fact that sexual excitement gives rise to a sufficient\r\nstimulus which, acting on the erection centre (and presuming that the\r\ncentre and its afferent and efferent tracts are normal), leads to an\r\nincreased flow of arterial blood to the penis and a diminished outflow\r\nthrough the veins of that organ, and consequently to its erection. The\r\ncerebrum is the organ in which the sensation of libido sexualis, of\r\nsexual excitement, has its seat; with this higher centre is connected by\r\nmeans of intercentral nerve tracts a lower, mechanical, reflex centre,\r\nsituated in the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord, and presiding\r\nover the performance of the act of copulation; it is moreover probable\r\nthat nerve fibres proceed from the spinal cord direct to the blood\r\nvessels of the erectile tissue, by means of which the calibre of these\r\nvessels can be lessened or their extensibility diminished. The relation\r\nof the erector nerves (nervi erigentes) to the penis is by many\r\nphysiologists compared to the relation of the vagus nerve to the heart.\r\nIn the quiescent state the small arteries of the penis and perhaps also\r\nthe cavernous spaces of that organ are in a state of mean contraction,\r\nso that they offer a considerable resistance to the passage of the blood\r\ncurrent. When now the nervi erigentes are excited to activity, the\r\nhitherto tonically contracted vessels of the penis undergo, according to\r\nthe school of physiologists just mentioned, relaxation, so that they\r\ndilate under the pressure of the blood within their walls, and, the\r\nprevious resistance to the flow being now removed, the blood pours\r\nfreely into the cavernous spaces of the penis, and distends these to the\r\nuttermost. In this manner erection is effected, rendering possible the\r\ninsertion of the penis into the genital passage of the female; with the\r\nculmination of the sexual act, the semen is ejaculated, the muscles of\r\nthe prostate and the membranous portion of the urethra together with the\r\nischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles, all acting strongly and\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\nBy the contraction of the muscular apparatus just described, the penis\r\nis constricted in the neighborhood of the pubic symphysis, and this\r\nfurther hinders the outflow of the blood from the corpora cavernosa,\r\nincreasing the intensity of the state of erection of the penis. Should\r\nthe relaxation of the corpora cavernosa, dependent upon the stimulation\r\nof the nervi erigentes, be incomplete, it is not possible for sufficient\r\nblood to pass into the cavernous spaces to exercise considerable\r\npressure upon the efferent veins, and thus complete erection fails to\r\noccur. If, again, the contraction of the muscular apparatus at the root\r\nof the penis is insufficiently vigorous, complete erection likewise\r\nfails to occur; the organ becomes semi-erect only, or erect for a period\r\ntoo short to permit of the completion of intercourse.\r\n\r\nSince, physiologically speaking, conception is the purpose with which\r\ncopulation is effected, the ejaculation of the semen must be regarded as\r\nthe principal object of that act; now in normal conditions, ejaculation\r\ntakes place only when the penis is fully erect. Associated with the\r\nerection of the corpora cavernosa is a swelling of the caput\r\ngallinaginis, whereby the orifices of the ejaculatory ducts are directed\r\nforwards toward the membranous portion of the urethra, and at the same\r\ntime the backward passage to the bladder is cut off. By this mechanism,\r\nthe urethra, which usually serves as the canal for the outflow of urine,\r\nis made for the time being solely subservient to the purposes of the\r\nsexual act. That the outlet from the bladder is obstructed by the\r\nswollen caput gallinaginis when the penis is erect, is shown by the\r\nfamiliar fact that a man whose penis is erect cannot pass water,\r\nalthough the way is freely open for the ejaculation of the semen.\r\n\r\nBefore ejaculation begins, the urethral glands already begin to secrete;\r\nand when erection is powerful and prolonged, this secretion often makes\r\nits appearance at the urethral orifice in the form of drops of a clear\r\nsomewhat tenacious fluid. _Ultzmann_ considers that the function of this\r\nsecretion is probably to moisten the walls of the urethra, over which\r\nthe acid urinary secretion is continually flowing, with a protective\r\nalkaline fluid, and thus to prepare the canal for the passage of the\r\nsemen. An analogy may be found in the secretion of the cervical glands\r\nof the uterus in the female, for this secretion has been found to\r\nenhance the activity of the movements of the spermatozoa. If now during\r\ncopulation the moment of ejaculation begins, the male experiences at the\r\nsame time a sense of voluptuous pleasure and a feeling of muscular spasm\r\nin the perineal region, and this indicates the commencing evacuation of\r\nthe contents of the seminal vesicles through the ejaculatory ducts.\r\nSimultaneously, the secretion of the prostate is poured into the\r\nurethra. The semen now gradually passes out through the narrow\r\nejaculatory ducts, and, since in consequence of the swelling of the\r\ncaput gallinaginis, it cannot pass backwards towards the bladder, it\r\nruns forwards, and accumulates in the bulb of the urethra, the\r\nphysiological excavation of that tube. As soon as a considerable\r\nquantity of the semen has collected in this situation, so that the bulb\r\nof the urethra becomes distended, reflex contractions of the\r\nbulbocavernosus muscles ensue, by means of which the seminal fluid is\r\nforced out of the urethral orifice. In cases in which this muscular\r\napparatus does not function properly, as in the paralytic form of\r\nimpotence, the semen during ejaculation is not ejected in a forcible\r\njet, but rather flows slowly, as from a lax tube partially filled with\r\nfluid, from the urethral orifice.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to _Roubaud_ for a classical description of the\r\nphenomena of copulation, and this description is here appended. It runs\r\nas follows: “As soon as the penis enters the vaginal vestibule, it first\r\nof all pushes against the glans clitoridis, which yields and bends\r\nbefore it. After this preliminary stimulation of the two chief centres\r\nof sexual sensibility, the glans penis glides over the inner surfaces of\r\nthe two vaginal bulbs; the collum and the body of the penis are then\r\ngrasped between the projecting surfaces of the vaginal bulbs, but the\r\nglans penis itself, which has passed further onward, is now in contact\r\nwith the fine and delicate surface of the vaginal mucous membrane, which\r\nmembrane itself, owing to the presence of erectile tissue between its\r\nlayers, is now in an elastic, resilient condition. This elasticity,\r\nwhich enables the vagina to adapt itself to the size of the penis,\r\nincreases at once the turgescence and the sensibility of the clitoris,\r\ninasmuch as the blood that is driven out of the vessels of the vaginal\r\nwall passes thence to those of the vaginal bulbs and the clitoris. On\r\nthe other hand, the turgescence and the sensitiveness of the glans penis\r\nitself are heightened by compression of that organ, in consequence of\r\nthe ever increasing fulness of the vessels of the vaginal mucous\r\nmembrane and the two vaginal bulbs.\r\n\r\n“At the same time the clitoris is pressed downward by the anterior\r\nportion of the compressor muscle, so that it is brought into contact\r\nwith the dorsal surface of the glans and of the body of the penis; in\r\nthis way a reciprocal friction between these two organs takes place,\r\nrepeated at each copulatory movement made by the two parties to the\r\naction, until at length the voluptuous sensation rises to its highest\r\nintensity and culminates in the sexual orgasm, marked in the male by the\r\nejaculation of the seminal fluid, and in the female by the aspiration of\r\nthat fluid into the gaping external orifice of the cervical canal; so\r\ntrue, indeed, is this, that it is a difficult matter to give a picture\r\nat once accurate and complete of the phenomena attending the normal act\r\nof copulation. Whilst in one individual the sense of sexual pleasure\r\namounts to no more than a barely perceptible titillation, in another\r\nthat sense reaches the acme of both mental and physical exaltation.\r\n\r\n“Between these two extremes we meet with innumerable states of\r\ntransition. In cases of intense exaltation, various pathological\r\nsymptoms make themselves manifest, such as quickening of the general\r\ncirculation, and violent pulsation of the arteries; the venous blood,\r\nbeing retained in the larger vessels by general muscular contractions,\r\nleads to an increased warmth of the body; and further, this venous\r\nstagnation, which is still more marked in the brain in consequence of\r\nthe contraction of the cervical muscles and the backward flexion of the\r\nneck, may cause cerebral congestion, during which the consciousness and\r\nall mental manifestations are momentarily in abeyance. The eyes,\r\nreddened by injection of the conjunctiva, become fixed, and the\r\nexpression becomes vacant; lids close conclusively, to exclude the\r\nlight. In some, the breathing becomes panting and labouring; but in\r\nothers, it is temporarily suspended, in consequence of laryngeal spasm,\r\nand the air, after being pent up for a time in the lungs, is finally\r\nforcibly expelled, and they utter incoherent and incomprehensible\r\nwords.”\r\n\r\nThe impulses proceeding from the congested nerve-centres are confused.\r\nThere is an indescribable disorder both of motion and of sensation, the\r\nextremities are affected with convulsive twitchings, and may be either\r\nmoved in various directions or extended straight and stiff; the jaws are\r\npressed together so that the teeth grind against each other; and certain\r\nindividuals are affected by erotic delirium to such as an extent that\r\nthey will seize the unguarded shoulder, for instance, of their partner\r\nin the sexual act, and bite it till the blood flows.\r\n\r\nA period of exhaustion follows, which is the more intense in proportion\r\nto the intensity of the preceding excitement. The sudden fatigue, the\r\ngeneral sense of weakness, and the inclination to sleep, which\r\nhabitually affect the male after the act of intercourse, are in part to\r\nbe ascribed to the loss of semen; for in the female, however energetic\r\nthe part she may have played in the sexual act, a mere transient fatigue\r\nis observed, much less in degree than that which affects the male, and\r\npermitting far sooner of a repetition of the act. “_Triste est omne\r\nanimal post coitum, praeter mulierem gallumque_,” wrote _Galen_, and the\r\naxiom is essentially true, at any rate so far as the human species is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThe question has been mooted, and many earnest inquirers have devoted\r\nmuch thought thereto, whether in this moment of most intense sexual\r\ngratification it is the male or the female that experiences the greatest\r\namount of pleasure. As in the case of all questions the data for the\r\nsolution of which are at once very various and very variable, so in this\r\ncase also, very different opinions have been put forward. “In fact,”\r\nwrites _Roubaud_, “when we take into consideration all the circumstances\r\nby which the intensity of sexual sensation is influenced, it may well be\r\ndoubted if it is at all possible to find an a priori solution for the\r\nproblem. When we take into consideration the influence exercised by\r\ntemperament, constitution, and a large number of conditions both general\r\nand special, on sexual sensibility, we cannot fail to be convinced that\r\nthis problem, in consequence of all the complicated characteristics it\r\npresents, is actually insoluble.”\r\n\r\nIn regard to the pleasure experienced in the act of intercourse, a\r\nremarkable distinction is drawn by _Gutceit_. The male, in every case\r\nand with every woman, experiences the full degree of pleasure; and even\r\nthough from the mental point of view this pleasure may be enhanced by\r\ninclination, attraction, and mutual love, from the physical point of\r\nview there is no difference between different acts of intercourse, so\r\nthat the cynical old Roman was right when he wrote. “_Sublata lucerna\r\nnullum discrimen inter foeminas._” But in the case of the female it is\r\nvery different. Her first experience of sexual relations is a very\r\npainful one, and this pain prevents all enjoyment as long as it\r\ncontinues, as it does in many women for one, two, or even four weeks.\r\nAnd when this period is once over, not more than two women in every ten\r\nexperience the pleasure of sexual intercourse in its full intensity. Of\r\nthe remaining eight, four have indeed an agreeable sensation during the\r\nrubbing movements of the sexual act, but it is a long time before they\r\nexperience a sensation analogous in its intensity to that which in man\r\naccompanies the act of ejaculation. In some women it may be six months\r\nafter marriage before the true sexual orgasm is experienced, in others\r\nit may be a year, or even several years; in a considerable number this\r\ndoes not happen until after they have given birth to several children.\r\nAs a result of numerous observations on this point, _Gutceit_ asserts\r\nthat in women sexual pleasure is experienced only in intercourse with a\r\nman who is beloved, or against whom, at least, no repulsion is felt; and\r\nthat no pleasure is felt by a woman in intercourse with a man towards\r\nwhom she feels an actual dislike. Further, he maintains, that a woman,\r\nloving another man, and feeling pleasure in intercourse with him, has on\r\nthe other hand no voluptuous sensations during intercourse with her\r\nhusband, whose embraces she permits only from a sense of duty. Thus in\r\nthe male, intercourse is always pleasurable, while in the female,\r\npleasure is experienced only when certain conditions are fulfilled.\r\n\r\nContact with the male genital organs stimulates in the female the\r\nsensory nerves of the vulva, the vestibule, and the vagina; the nervous\r\nstimulus is transmitted to the cerebral cortex, where it gives rise to\r\nthe sensation of sexual pleasure, and causes, through the intermediation\r\nof the genito-spinal centre, a number of reflex actions. As sensory\r\nnerve terminals of such reflex arcs, the final ramifications of the\r\npudic branch of the sciatic plexus play the most important part; in the\r\nclitoris these nerves are beset with a peculiar kind of end-bulbs, the\r\ngenital corpuscles discovered by _W. Krause_; from their structure these\r\ncorpuscles seem admirably adapted to respond to the very slightest\r\nstimulation, producing voluptuous sensations and perceptions, and giving\r\nrise to various reflex manifestations. The first part of the path of the\r\nafferent impulses by which sexual pleasure is aroused is constituted by\r\nthe dorsal nerves of the clitoris. The reflex changes consequent upon\r\nsexual excitement begin already in the vestibule, inasmuch as the\r\nsecretion of Bartholin’s glands, which are compressed by the action of\r\nthe constrictor cunni muscle, is expelled during coitus, the secretion,\r\nowing to the situation of the orifices of Bartholin’s ducts, passing\r\nover the external genitals. The clitoris becomes erect; the blood in the\r\nbulbs of the vestibule, the venous plexus situated around the margin of\r\nthe vestibule along the boundary between the labia majora and the labia\r\nminora, is pressed into the glans clitoridis, the erection and\r\nsensibility of this structure being proportionately heightened. By the\r\naction of the constrictor cunni and ischiocavernosus muscles, the\r\nclitoris, the distal extremity of which is bent downwards at a right\r\nangle, is drawn down and pressed against the penis.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the vagina is the sphincter vaginæ muscle, whose\r\naction is reinforced by muscular fibres running in the middle coat of\r\nthe vagina itself. It is probable that the muscular activity of the\r\nvagina and the uterus facilitates the entrance of the semen into the\r\ncavity of the uterus.\r\n\r\nDorsal decubitus is rightly regarded as the most correct position,\r\nphysiologically speaking, for the woman to assume during coitus. That\r\nfrom the earliest times and in the most diverse races, this position has\r\nbeen customary, is shown by numerous antique paintings and statues, and\r\nby the reports of those who have studied the customs of savage races.\r\nVarious other positions are, however, occasionally assumed; thus,\r\n_Ploss_ and _Bartels_ report, that among the Soudanese, coitus is\r\npracticed in the erect posture, with the man standing behind the woman;\r\nthat among the Inuits (Eskimo), the act is performed in the manner usual\r\namong quadrupeds; that among the Swahelis in Zanzibar, and among the\r\nindigens of Kamschatka, the lateral posture is customary; and that among\r\nthe Australian blacks, coitus is usually effected in the crouching\r\nposture, both parties squatting on their hams. The same writers remind\r\nus, that in the old calendars of the fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth,\r\nand eighteenth centuries, definite commands and prohibitions for the\r\nconduct of marital intercourse are to be found, and that lucky and\r\nunlucky days, respectively, are specified for the performance of the\r\nact. These recommendations would appear to be relics of antiquity, for\r\nin the Sanscrit work _Kokkogam_, under the heading “_Sexual Intercourse\r\nAccording to the Days of the Month_,” exact instructions are given for\r\nthe proper performance of coitus.\r\n\r\nIn the _Kamasutra_ (the Indian _ars amatoria_, a work only in recent\r\ndays rendered accessible to European readers in the translation of _R.\r\nSchmidt_), several chapters are devoted to the detailed description of\r\nthe various methods of copulation, and rules are given for the carnal\r\nunion of man and wife. But, as the Indian author justly remarks, “Rules\r\nare of value only for the control of moderate desire; when the wheel of\r\npassion has once begun to roll, to prescribe a course is no longer of\r\nany avail.” In this work, sixty-four varieties of erotic enjoyment are\r\nenumerated, and we find an _explicatio coitus secundum mensuram, tempus,\r\nnaturam, de modis inter coitum procumbendi, de minis coitibus, de coitu\r\ninverso, de viri inter coitum consuetudinibus_.\r\n\r\nAt times, in order that coitus may be effective, some other position\r\nthan the natural one is indispensable. Such a necessity has been\r\nrecognized even by theologians, by whom any divergence from nature in\r\nthis matter has usually been regarded as sinful. For instance, in the\r\nwork of _Craisson_, _De Rebus Venereis ad Usum Confessariorum_, we read:\r\n“_Situs naturalis est ut mulier sit succuba et vir incubus, hic enim\r\nmodus aptior est effusionis seminis virilis et receptioni in vas\r\nfemineum ad prolem procreandum. Unde si coitus aliter fiat, nempe\r\nsedendo, stando, de latere, vel praepostere (more pecudum), vel si vir\r\nsit succubus et mulier incuba, innaturalis est.... Sed tamen minime\r\npeccant conjuges si ex justa causa situm mutent, nempe ob aegritudinem,\r\nvel viri pinquetudinem, vel ob periculum abortus; quandoque ait St.\r\nThomas, sine peccato esse potest quando dispositio corporis alium modum\r\nnon patitur._”\r\n\r\nIn certain pathological states, as for the prevention of sterility, an\r\nabnormal posture during coitus may advantageously be recommended, in\r\norder to favour the entrance of the semen into the cervical canal, and\r\nto allow the semen to stay longer in the vagina before it flows out. An\r\nold and often efficacious means for this purpose is the performance of\r\ncoitus with the woman in the knee-elbow posture. In order to favour the\r\nentrance of the semen into the deeper portion of the genital tract,\r\n_Hegar_ and _Kaltenbach_ recommend that after coitus the woman should\r\nremain for some time in the knee-elbow posture, while the man from time\r\nto time gently presses up the anterior abdominal wall, and then abruptly\r\nrelaxes the pressure.—In the _Talmud_, coitus was regarded as unfruitful\r\nif performed when the woman was in the erect posture.\r\n\r\n_Casper_ reports the case of a woman with severe scoliosis, who had long\r\nremained sterile, and who only conceived (and was subsequently happily\r\ndelivered) after performing coitus in the abdominal decubitus.\r\n\r\n_Guéneau de Mussy_ suggests the following, very characteristic, method\r\nof ensuring fertilization, one which also certainly dates from great\r\nantiquity: “_Sed haud illicitum mihi visum est, si post diversa\r\ntentamina diutius uxor infecunda manserit, ipsum maritum digitum post\r\ncoitum in vaginam immittere, et ita receptum semen uteri osteo admovere.\r\nEt cum ostiolo uteri haeret, ut in pervium canalem spermatozoidum\r\nmotibus faventibus, prodeat, sperare non absurdum._” _Eustache_ reports\r\na case, the wife of a physician, in which this manoeuvre was effective\r\nin ensuring conception.\r\n\r\nA similar procedure has been employed with success by Kehrer, in a case\r\nof enfeebled potency on the part of the male, leading to premature\r\nejaculation. A speculum was introduced into the vagina, and through this\r\ninstrument the semen, ejaculated in consequence of sexual excitement,\r\nwas introduced into the vaginal fornix; conception ensued. In an\r\nanalogous manner, _A. Peyer_ recommended, in a case of partial\r\nimpotence, in which special manipulations were needed to bring about\r\nejaculation, that conception should be favoured in the following manner:\r\nErection having been effected by ordinary sexual contact, the\r\nmanipulations needed to produce ejaculation were carried out, and the\r\npenis was intromitted into the vagina the moment before ejaculation\r\noccurred. This has been done with fruitful results. _Englisch_ reports\r\nthe case of a hypospadiac who, in order to render coitus effective, used\r\na condom in the anterior extremity of which he made an aperture. In this\r\nway he became the father of three children.\r\n\r\nIn very obese men with extremely protuberant abdomens, we may recommend\r\nfor the furtherance of conception that they should have intercourse with\r\ntheir wives _a parte posteriori_; and the same recommendation may be\r\nmade in cases in which the wife herself is extremely obese. In\r\nAustralia, it is said that among the indigens, coitus is usually\r\npracticed _a posteriori_; and there is a saying in the Talmud to the\r\neffect that sexual intercourse performed in the ordinary manner does not\r\nlead to the conception of infants so good, wise, talented, and promising\r\nas those whose conception is the result of coitus _a posteriori_.\r\nMohammed, on the other hand, declares, “Your wives are your tillage, go\r\ntherefore unto it in whatsoever manner ye will.”\r\n\r\nIn cases of retroflexion of the uterus, with a markedly forward\r\ndirection of the vaginal portion of the cervix, I have recommended to\r\nthe husband that he should perform coitus with his wife in the upright\r\nsitting posture. In this posture the fundus uteri passes downwards and\r\nforwards, whilst the vaginal portion of the cervix passes upwards and\r\nbackwards.\r\n\r\nIn cases of retroversion of the uterus with the formation of a\r\ncul-de-sac in the posterior vaginal fornix, _Pajot_ recommends, with the\r\naim of temporarily restoring the uterus to a position in which the\r\noccurrence of conception is favored, that for three or four days prior\r\nto coitus the patient should retain the fæces, eating the while freely\r\nof eggs and rice, and taking a small opium pill every evening; in cases\r\nof anteversion, the patient should retain her urine for a considerable\r\ntime—five or six hours—before coitus; and in cases of lateral version he\r\nrecommends that the patient should have intercourse while lying on that\r\nside towards which the vaginal portion of the cervix is directed.\r\n\r\n_Edis_ recommends that in cases in which there is sterility dependent\r\nupon backward displacements of the uterus, that the organ should be\r\nreplaced while the patient is in the genu-pectoral posture, and a\r\npessary inserted; coitus should then be effected without the patient’s\r\nchanging her posture.\r\n\r\nIn the human species as compared with the lower animals, there has been\r\na notable diminution in the frequency of the separate acts of\r\nintercourse, a diminution dependent upon the higher vital aims of the\r\nformer. _Burdach_ formulates as a physiological law that the frequency\r\nof sexual intercourse is inversely related to the duration of the act.\r\n\r\nAmongst all civilized races, sexual intercourse ceases during\r\nmenstruation, since in the normal man there is aversion to intercourse\r\nwith a menstruating female.\r\n\r\nBy the Mosaic law, intercourse with a woman during menstruation and for\r\nseven days after the cessation of the flow, was forbidden under pain of\r\ndeath. The _Talmud_ further ordains that a purifying bath shall be taken\r\nby the woman a week after menstruation. By intercourse itself, moreover,\r\nboth man and woman were rendered unclean to the evening; and, according\r\nto the Mosaic law, both must bathe after the act of coitus. In the\r\n_Koran_, also, intercourse is forbidden during menstruation, and until\r\nthe woman has been purified with water. The law’s of Islam demand from a\r\nman who marries a virgin that he shall have intercourse with her the\r\nfirst seven nights in succession; whilst he who marries a wife no longer\r\nvirgin, needs to visit her only the first three nights in succession.\r\nSubsequently, during married life, the Mohammedan shall have intercourse\r\nwith his wife regularly once a week. Amongst many savage races,\r\nintercourse is forbidden with a woman during pregnancy, the puerperium,\r\nand lactation.\r\n\r\nThe first act of intercourse is difficult and painful to the virgin. At\r\ntimes the rupture of the hymen is exceedingly difficult. Even after\r\nthis, it is some time before genuine pleasure is experienced in sexual\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nTo the female, intercourse is harmful when performed with undue\r\nfrequency, or during menstruation, or indiscriminately throughout\r\npregnancy, or during the puerperium, or incompletely or in an unnatural\r\nmanner, or finally when performed in an unsuitable bodily attitude.\r\n\r\n“Unduly frequent performance of the act of coitus,” writes _Hegar_,\r\n“which is liable to occur either in marital or in illicit intercourse,\r\ngives rise to anæmia, defective nutrition, muscular weakness,\r\nintellectual and nervous exhaustion. Young and healthy individuals\r\nrecuperate rapidly after excesses of brief duration, as is often seen in\r\nyoung married pairs. Sickly and elderly persons, on the other hand, are\r\nmuch more severely affected by sexual excess, and recover therefrom but\r\nslowly if at all. Long continued sexual excesses ultimately wear out\r\neven the strongest.”\r\n\r\nIntercourse effected by force, or with a girl of immature age, is\r\ndistinguished as rape, a punishable offence both in Germany and in\r\nAustria. The offence is defined as extra-marital intercourse with a\r\nfemale under the age of fourteen years, with or without the latter’s\r\nconsent; or extra-marital intercourse with a female of any age against\r\nher will or deprived of the power of resistance—either by the use of\r\nactual force, by the employment of threats, or by loss of consciousness.\r\nWith regard to the last specification, the law regards as rape\r\nintercourse with a woman unable to resist through loss of consciousness,\r\nwhether that loss of consciousness is or is not produced by the direct\r\naction of the violator.\r\n\r\nIn the female, the act of intercourse, alike physically, in its natural\r\nconsequences, and mentally, is at once more difficult and of more\r\nenduring results than in the male. A writer of the new school, who\r\naccording to his own admission has no other interest than the study of\r\nthe sexual life, writes of himself: “I have often enough had intercourse\r\nwith members of the other sex, in a few cases, indeed, out of pure\r\ninclination; but in all cases alike the aim and the result were the\r\nsame—as soon as I had gained my end, the affair was finished. Passion, a\r\nbestial act, exhaustion, commonly a feeling of loathing; in the best\r\npossible case a fugitive but not an agreeable memory; voilà tout.” To\r\nwomen, such a description, happily, is applicable only in the most\r\nexceptional cases.\r\n\r\nWith the completion of coitus, the voluntary and conscious action of the\r\ntwo parties to the act is at an end; the subsequent stages of the\r\nfunction of generation are independent alike of consciousness and will.\r\n\r\nWhen complete intromission of the penis has been effected, and\r\nejaculation takes place, the semen is usually deposited at the os uteri\r\nor in the immediate neighborhood of that orifice. During the act of\r\nejaculation, a peristaltic contraction of the vagina occurs, by means of\r\nwhich the semen at the os uteri is subjected to a moderate degree of\r\npressure; the contraction and the pressure may perhaps persist for some\r\nlittle time after the completion of the coitus. In rabbits on heat, such\r\ncontractions of the vagina, by means of which the semen was forced under\r\npressure into the interior of the uterus, have been actually observed.\r\n\r\nDuring coitus, the uterine muscle is also active. During strong sexual\r\nexcitement, the uterus descends in the pelvis, the downward movement\r\nbeing increased by the pressure on the woman’s abdomen. The os uteri\r\nexternum is drawn open, and the aperture, hitherto flattened, now\r\nbecomes rounded. At the same time, the secretion of the cervical glands\r\nis expelled, and small quantities of semen are sucked into the cervical\r\ncanal. The _plicae palmatae_ offer a certain hindrance to the entrance\r\nof the semen; but the surface of the interior of the canal is rendered\r\nmuch smoother by the free secretion of mucus by the cervical glands.\r\nFurther, it appears highly probable that during the excitement of\r\ncoitus, the mouths of the Fallopian tubes, ordinarily more or less\r\ntightly closed, become widely opened, so that the entrance of the\r\nspermatozoa is favored.\r\n\r\nThe muscular movements of the uterus were observed by _J. Beck_ in a\r\nwoman suffering from prolapse. During sexual excitement, the os uteri\r\nopened and closed rapidly five or six times in succession, remaining at\r\nlast firmly closed. Further, in bitches on heat, _Basch_ and _Hoffmann_\r\nobserved the vaginal portion of the cervix to descend in the vagina, the\r\nos uteri opened, mucus was extruded, and the os was then retracted.\r\n\r\n_Hohl_, _Litzmann_, and others have reported, that in women endowed with\r\ngreat nervous susceptibility, friction of the vaginal portion of the\r\ncervix with the finger arouses sexual sensation, with rounding of the os\r\nuteri externum, descent of the uterus, and hardening of the vaginal\r\nportion; this latter is regarded by _Graily Hewitt_ and by _Wernich_ as\r\na necessary accompaniment of copulation. _Henle_ believes that the\r\nhardening and protrusion of the vaginal portion of the cervix are due to\r\na change in the tension of the delicate vessels of this structure, which\r\nhave an exceptionally thick muscular coat; _Rouget_ compares the\r\nmechanism with that by which erection of the penis is produced. These\r\nauthors consider that sexual excitement is indispensable for the\r\nerection of the vaginal portion of the cervix.\r\n\r\nThus, _Hohl_ writes: “Numerous observations have shown that in females\r\nendowed with a considerable degree of nervous susceptibility, and\r\nespecially in nulliparae, during examination and during any increasing\r\nirritation, not only is there an increased secretion of the vaginal\r\nmucus, but also a momentary descent of the uterus and an opening of the\r\nos uteri externum, so that this orifice has the appearance for the\r\ninstant of the open mouth of a tube.” _Litzmann_ reports that during the\r\nvaginal examination of a young, extremely erethistic woman, the uterus\r\nsuddenly assumed a more vertical position, and came lower down in the\r\npelvis; at the same time, the lips of the cervix became equal in length,\r\nthe os uteri externum became rounded, soft, and penetrable by the\r\nfinger; whilst the breathing and the voice indicated the occurrence of\r\nintense sexual excitement. _Rouget_ assumes that the body and the fundus\r\nof the uterus constitute an erectile organ, which however possesses\r\ncapability for erection only during the period of ovulation; _Hewitt_,\r\non the other hand, considers it extremely probable that the erection may\r\noccur at any time during sexual intercourse, whether ovulation is\r\nproceeding or not. _A. Wernich_ considers, basing his views in part on\r\npersonal observations, that erection of the lower segment of the uterus\r\noccurs, like erection of the penis, whenever a moderate degree of sexual\r\nexcitement is experienced; in women, however, he believes that erection\r\nis seldom extreme, and that it declines with the other symptoms of\r\nsexual excitement, viz., flushing of the face, moisture and glistening\r\nof the eyes, peculiar groaning expiration, etc. Whereas during\r\novulation, erection is merely a necessary concomitant of the other\r\nmenstrual processes; during coitus, erection not only occurs much more\r\npowerfully, but it is also an important—perhaps the most\r\nimportant—contributory factor in effecting fertilization.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer possible to accept the view of earlier physiologists\r\nthat the purpose of this erection of the lower segment of the uterus is\r\n“to constitute with the penis a continuous canal between the male and\r\nthe female genital organs.” Contact between the glans penis and the os\r\nuteri externum is not indeed an occurrence of extreme rarity; but, on\r\nthe other hand, it is in no sense a constant nor even a frequent\r\nincident of sexual intercourse. It is ejaculation, especially, which is\r\nsubserved by the erection of the vaginal portion of the cervix. In the\r\nfemale, ejaculation occurs at the moment of the most intense sexual\r\npleasure, and is marked by the evacuation from the os uteri externum of\r\na moderate quantity of mucous fluid with an alkaline reaction. In some\r\ncases, in which a chronic discharge of this cervical mucus occurs, it\r\nforms an elongated coagulum of delicate vitreous jelly, the\r\n“mucus-string” of _Kristeller_. The last-mentioned author is of opinion\r\nthat the spermatozoa slowly, but by active movements, find their way\r\nalong this string into the cavity of the uterus. This assumption,\r\nhowever, is met by _C. Mayer_ and _Marion Sims_ with the objection, that\r\n_Kristeller’s_ observations were for the most part carried out on women\r\nwho were out of health, and that a gelatinous secretion of this\r\ncharacter obstructs the orifice of the cervical canal, and hinders the\r\noccurrence of conception. From the erection of the portio vaginalis\r\nduring sexual excitement, and its sudden relaxation post cohabitationem,\r\n_Wernich_ deduces the occurrence of a process of aspiration, by which\r\nthe semen is drawn up through the cervical canal into the cavity of the\r\nuterus; a process which has been seen in actual occurrence in vivisected\r\nanimals. It is said that to many women this feeling of a process of\r\nsuction is so well known, that thereon, in association with the\r\nconsequent almost complete absence of mucus and seminal fluid from the\r\nvagina, they are accustomed to base a belief that conception will occur.\r\nIt is said that this aspiratory activity on the part of the uterus may\r\nbe perceived during coitus by the male also (?). It is assumed by\r\n_Grohe_ that the wave motion of the cilia of the epithelium lining the\r\ncervical canal, is of importance in promoting the ascent of the\r\nspermatozoa; it may be that the vibration of the cilia exercises a\r\nmotile stimulus on the spermatozoa, it may be that the continually\r\nrepeated stroke of the cilia serves to prevent the permanent\r\nagglutination of the spermatozoa into groups.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Sims_, the aspiratory action of the uterus is effected in\r\nthe following manner: By the contraction of the constrictor vaginae\r\nsuperior muscle, the cervix is pressed downwards against the glans\r\npenis, and by this pressure its contents are evacuated; the parts then\r\nrelax, the uterus suddenly returns to its normal state, and thus the\r\nseminal fluid with which the vagina is filled is drawn into the interior\r\nof the cervical canal.\r\n\r\n_Eichstadt_ also attributes to the uterus an aspiratory force, dependent\r\nupon coitus, and competent to force into the interior of the uterus the\r\nsemen ejaculated into the os uteri. The changes in the uterus which are\r\nthe necessary antecedents of this aspiration, namely, an engorgement\r\nwith blood whereby the flattened form of the uterus gives place to a\r\nmore rounded form, and the cavity of the organ is increased in capacity,\r\ntake place, in the opinion of this author, only when during intercourse\r\nthe woman has attained the acme of sexual gratification, by which alone\r\ncan the aforesaid change in the uterus be brought about. _E. Martin_ and\r\n_Chrobak_ have also directed attention to the fact, that some importance\r\nin this connexion must be attached to the facultative enlargement in the\r\nsize of the os uteri externum.\r\n\r\n_Lott_, by his researches into the behaviour of the cervix uteri in\r\nrelation to the act of conception, is led to the conclusion that the\r\nlocomotive capacity of the spermatozoa forms the principal factor in\r\neffecting a fertilizing contact between the spermatozoa and the ovum.\r\nThis locomotive capacity may be increased or diminished by a number of\r\nconditions, among which the principal are: the activity of the cervix\r\nuteri (the ciliated epithelium); the character of the secretions; and\r\nthe position, shape, and size of the cervix. Thus, this author\r\nconcludes, the part played in conception by the normal cervical canal is\r\na purely passive one, with the sole exception of the activity of the\r\nciliated epithelium—and the influence of this factor must be regarded as\r\nextremely doubtful. That during ejaculation the external orifice of the\r\nmale urethra and the os uteri externum are in close apposition, is\r\ndenied by _Lott_, who adduces in support of his views data derived from\r\ncomparative investigations on various animals. In the dog, the\r\nconfiguration of the genital organs is such that it is impossible to\r\nsuppose that any apposition can occur; the same is the case with the\r\nsheep; and still more so with the rabbit, who possesses two quite\r\ndistinct portions vaginales, projecting freely into the vagina. In the\r\nhuman species also, the character of the walls of the cervical canal,\r\nwhere in the normal state the plicae palmatae may almost be said to\r\ninterlock, separated only by a thin stratum of mucus, offers a hindrance\r\nto the entrance of the ejaculated semen by the direct force of\r\nejaculation itself. As regards the independent motile powers of the\r\nspermatozoa, the researches of _Lott_ showed that not only can they\r\novercome strong capillary currents, and can traverse the width of a\r\ncoverglass (18mm.—about ¾ in.) in about five minutes; but further that\r\nthey are capable of migration through the finest interstices (those of\r\nan animal membrane) provided that the fluid with which the membrane is\r\nmoistened is one favourable to their vital activity.\r\n\r\n_Kehrer_, who in general supports the view that the _modus coeundi_ and\r\nan active attitude on the part of the female have an important influence\r\non the occurrence of conception, assumes that independent contractions\r\nof the cervix occur, whereby is expelled the delicate plug of mucus that\r\nfills the cervical canal and offers an obstacle to the passage of the\r\nspermatozoa. He believes that the duration of the act of intercourse,\r\nthe mechanical relations between the penis and the vagina, the activity\r\nof the uterine muscle, the secretory activity of the utero-vaginal\r\nmucosa during the act, and the posture of the female _post coitum_, are\r\nall important factors in the occurrence of conception. Thus, he believes\r\nthat if during intercourse there is a failure of the uterine\r\ncontractions, which should expel the plug of cervical mucus, the semen\r\nflows away without effecting fertilization; if an unsuitable posture is\r\nassumed during intercourse the woman remains sterile, but can be\r\nfertilized without difficulty by coitus effected in the proper manner.\r\n\r\n_Haussmann_ has shown, that in the same woman, and in similar\r\nconditions, spermatozoa will on one occasion be found in the cervical\r\ncanal, and on another occasion will not be found there; and he has\r\nfurther shown, that in some women we fail to find spermatozoa in the\r\ncervical canal in circumstances in which, in other women, we regularly\r\nfind them in that situation.\r\n\r\nFar as we may be from a complete knowledge of the conditions upon which\r\nconception depends, this at least is certain, that the passage of\r\nspermatozoa through the os uteri externum is a sine qua non of\r\nfertilization. Indeed, it would seem that we must accept as true the\r\nassumption of _Meyerhofer_, that fertilization is possible only if the\r\nsemen passes at once into the cervical canal, mingles, that is, at once\r\nwith the alkaline cervical mucus—unless, indeed, the coitus takes place\r\nduring the catamenial flow, when the blood has neutralized the acid\r\nreaction in the vagina, or takes place when some morbid condition has\r\nhad the same result. The theory of _Johann Müller_, regarding the\r\npiston-like action of the penis during coitus, by which the semen is\r\nactually forced through the cervix, must be rejected; equally unsound is\r\n_Holst’s_ assumption that during intercourse the semen is ejaculated\r\nthrough the enlarged cervical canal directly into the cavity of the\r\nuterus. It would appear, however, to be a necessary condition of\r\nfertilization, that the semen should be ejaculated into the uppermost\r\nsegment of the vagina, so that the fluid comes into actual contact with\r\nthe os uteri externum; it may be that the alleged aspiratory force of\r\nthe uterus then comes into play, by means of which the semen is sucked\r\ninto the cavity of that organ; it may be, on the other hand, that\r\n_Beigel_ is right in his theory of the existence of a _receptaculum\r\nseminis_, formed by the anterior and posterior lips of the cervix uteri\r\nand the uppermost segment of the vagina—in this space, he supposes, a\r\npart of the semen is retained in contact with the orifice of the\r\ncervical canal.\r\n\r\nIt is, also, exceedingly probable that during coitus a reflex nervous\r\nmechanism becomes active, by means of which the uterine orifices of the\r\nFallopian tubes are opened, the vaginal portion of the cervix descends\r\nin the vagina, the os uteri externum enlarges, the orifice becoming\r\nrounded where before it was flattened, and finally small quantities of\r\nsemen may be aspirated into the cavity of the uterus.\r\n\r\nI further regard it as important in promoting conception, that\r\nsimultaneously with the changes above described, the reflex nervous\r\nstimulation should lead to the secretion by the cervical glands of a\r\ngelatinous material, alkaline in reaction, and therefore adapted to\r\nincrease the locomotive powers of the spermatozoa, so that these latter,\r\naided by the activity of the ciliated epithelium lining the cervical\r\ncanal, will gain the interior of the cavity of the uterus, and thence\r\npass onwards to the Fallopian tubes. The significance of the glands in\r\nthe mucous membrane lining the cervical canal has hitherto been\r\nunderestimated in this connexion.\r\n\r\nWhereas in the primitive state of mankind, among savage races at the\r\npresent day, as among our own prehistoric ancestry, nakedness is the\r\nrule, so also intercourse in these circumstances is effected altogether\r\nwithout any regulation by law or custom, on the mere prompting of\r\nunbridled natural passion, and, moreover, there is the fullest\r\npromiscuity in sexual relations; but civilization has led man to impose\r\nrestraints upon sexual intercourse, and has introduced marriage as a\r\nsacred institution. Among certain primitive peoples, however, among whom\r\nthe wives are common to all the men, transitory pairings nevertheless\r\noccur, especially when a woman becomes pregnant; to cease, however,\r\nduring the period of lactation. “This is the origin of marriage, which\r\nhas evolved from rape and prostitution, as law has evolved from crime”\r\n(_Lombroso_). This author makes an interesting observation when\r\ndescribing the entire freedom of sexual intercourse that obtains among\r\nthe Red Indians of North America, to the effect that “often, times of\r\ngeneral promiscuity occur, as with rutting animals, generally in the\r\nwarm season of the year, when nutriment is abundant; it is difficult to\r\nindicate any distinction between the tumultuous orgies of the baboon,\r\nand those of the Australian Blackfellows, among whom the sexes keep\r\napart during the greater part of the year, to intermingle like rutting\r\nbeasts during the season of the yam-harvest.”\r\n\r\nThe paths of civilization, from the complete promiscuity of sexual\r\nintercourse to the lofty ideal of life-long monogamic union, has not\r\nbeen a straightforward one, but has been marked by various aberrations\r\nof sexual relationship; hetairism, prostitution, polyandry, incest,\r\nrape, the _jus primae noctis_, etc. The anthropologist is able to trace\r\nthe successive stages of the development of the institution of monogamic\r\nmarriage; the community of wives within the clan; free sale of wives and\r\ndaughters; bestowal of a man’s wife or concubine for the honour of a\r\nguest; ritual prostitution for the honour of the gods and at numerous\r\nreligious festivals; æsthetic and literary hetairism, with bestowal of\r\nfavours according to free inclination; community of wives among all\r\nmales of the same family; the claim of the wife to as many as five or\r\nsix husbands; the right of brothers to their sisters; the defloration of\r\nvirgins by the priests in heathen temples; the temporary possession of\r\nthe wife by the chief of the community, prior to her possession by her\r\npermanent husband; defloration of the bride by the bonze before her\r\nmarriage; the feudal right of the mediæval seigneur to the _prima nox_\r\nof the bride of his retainer.\r\n\r\nIn the lower stages of civilization, copulation appears so natural an\r\naction that it is performed in public entirely without shame. Thus,\r\n_Cook_, in his first voyage, describes having seen an indigen engage in\r\nsexual intercourse with a girl of eleven years, under the very eyes of\r\nthe queen, with whom _Cook_ was then having audience; the sexual act\r\nwas, according to _Cook_, the favourite topic of conversation between\r\nthe sexes. _Herodotus_ reports that many peoples of antiquity had no\r\nregard for privacy in sexual intercourse, but that, like the lower\r\nanimals, they had connexion in any company. In the _Bible_, also, it is\r\nrecorded that sexual intercourse was practised in public: “So they\r\nspread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in\r\nunto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.” (II. _Samuel_,\r\nXVI. 22.) According to _Athenaeus_, the Etruscans, at their public\r\nbanquets, were equally unrestrained. _Plutarch_ reports that among the\r\nSpartans the maidens and the young men went about naked together. Even,\r\nindeed, after the sense of modesty had begun to develop, it was long\r\nbefore any secret was made about the act of intercourse. In classical\r\nantiquity, it was very frequently the subject of pictorial and plastic\r\nrepresentation. Even in more recent days, there have been artists who\r\nhave not hesitated to depict the sexual act: thus we have the _Venus\r\nwith a Faun_ by _Caracci_; the _Jupiter and Io_ of _Correggio_; the\r\n_Leda and the Swan_ of _Tintoretto_; and similar pictures by _Luca\r\nGiordano_, _Rubens_, _Titian_, and _Franceschini_.\r\n\r\nEven in the early centuries of the Christian era, the sect of the\r\nAdamites practised intercourse openly in the light of day, on the ground\r\nthat that which was right in the dark, could not be wrong in the light.\r\nThe same is reported of the sect of Turlupins, in France in the\r\nfourteenth century. We cannot refrain from quoting at length from\r\n_Lombroso_ and _Ferrero_ a passage relating to the evolution of sexual\r\nmanners in the female sex (_Woman as Criminal and Prostitute_): “In the\r\nlowest stages of development, the feeling of modesty is entirely\r\nwanting; limitless freedom in sexual intercourse is the general rule;\r\nand even where no system of promiscuity prevails, marriage rather\r\nfosters than discourages prostitution, especially in countries in which\r\nhusbands are accustomed to expose their wives for sale. This fact may be\r\nbrought into relation with the well known lasciviousness of apes and\r\nother animals high in the scale, showing that sexual excitability\r\nincreases _pari passu_ with intelligence, so that to man it is as\r\nimpossible as to an ape to satisfy his sexual needs with a single\r\nfemale. Whilst among the apes, a single male possesses a number of\r\nwives, we find in the gregarious life of primitive man that community of\r\nwives has taken the place of polygamy, which institution, however,\r\nreappears in a higher stage of culture for the benefit of the more\r\npowerful masculine natures.\r\n\r\n“To the dominion of prostitution as a normal institution succeeds the\r\nperiod in which it persists as a variously metamorphosed survival: it\r\nmay be as the duty of the wife to surrender her person to any other\r\nmale of the same family; or the woman may have to bestow her favors on\r\na religious or political chief, as in the institution of\r\ntemple-prostitution, where the wife must give herself, it may be to\r\nany one and at any time, or it may be to defined persons only and at\r\nstated festivals. Frequently we meet with another development of\r\nprostitution, finding that while the wife must remain chaste, the\r\nunmarried woman is allowed unrestricted intercourse; or, again, the\r\nwife at certain definite periods may dispense with fidelity to her\r\nhusband, and return to the primitive condition of promiscuity. In\r\ncertain instances prostitution is combined with the duties of\r\nhospitality, and marriage, though approximating to the monogamic\r\nideal, must tolerate the intrusion of the guest into the marriage\r\nbed.”\r\n\r\n“In a third period, prostitution no longer fills the place of a\r\ntraditional survival, but is a morbid manifestation confined to a\r\ncertain class of the community. But bridging this transition of\r\nprostitution from a normal to a morbid manifestation, we have the\r\nremarkable phenomenon of æsthetic prostitution. Thus, in India and in\r\nJapan, an agreeable class of prostitutes practices the arts of singing\r\nand dancing, and forms a privileged caste; similarly, in the most\r\nflourishing period of Grecian culture, the leading men of the time\r\nformed a social circle around the hetairæ, from whom they derived a\r\nfruitful stimulus to intellectual and political activity. In this\r\nrespect, history repeated itself in Italy in the sixteenth century.\r\nAlike in classical Greece and in mediæval Italy, this æsthetic\r\nprostitution fanned the flames of a period of intense spiritual\r\nactivity—for in individuals as in races, intellectual quickening is ever\r\naccompanied by erotic excitability.”\r\n\r\nThe unbridled passion of the primitive races of mankind, the coercive\r\nlove of beauty felt by the ancient Greeks, the swelling flood of erotism\r\nof the great mass of people of all times, is gradually guided into the\r\nquiet channel of the marriage bed; and even though monogamic marriage is\r\nincapable of fully providing for all manifestations of sexual passion,\r\nstill, from the medical point of view, we must maintain that marriage is\r\nfor women the most hygienic and the most proper means of gratification\r\nof the sexual impulse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Conception._\r\n\r\nThe union between ovum and spermatozoön, whereby fertilization is\r\neffected, appears to occur in the human species as a rule in the outer\r\nthird of the Fallopian tube, the ampulla of this structure\r\n(_receptaculum seminis_ in _Henle’s_ terminology) serving to store the\r\nsemen for a considerable period; in the lower animals, the usual\r\noccurrence of fertilization in this region has been established by\r\ndirect observation. The open mouth of the tube receives the mature ovum,\r\nguided thither from the ovary by appropriate movements of the ovarian\r\nfimbriae; these movements have been seen in active occurrence in the\r\nguinea pig by _Hensen_. Once within the tube, the onward movement of the\r\novum is effected by the cilia of the epithelium lining of the canal.\r\n\r\n_His_ has formulated the theory that in the human species fertilization\r\nis possible only in the uppermost segment of the tube; an assumption\r\nthat is probable enough, but cannot be regarded as definitely\r\nestablished. An analogy certainly exists among the lower divisions of\r\nthe animal kingdom, for _Coste_, _His_, and _Ohlschläger_ have proved\r\nthat an ovum which passes through the Fallopian tube without being\r\nfertilized, undergoes notable alterations. Further, _Coste_ has shown,\r\nin the case of the ovum of the domestic fowl, that this is no longer\r\ncapable of being fertilized after it has passed through the upper\r\nsegment of the oviduct. Other authorities, however, namely _Löwenthal_,\r\n_Mayrhofer_, and _Wyder_, oppose the extension of this rule to the human\r\nspecies. _Löwenthal_ assumes that in the human female, fertilization\r\nordinarily occurs in the cavity of the uterus, in the wall of which the\r\nunfertilized ovum has already embedded itself; and he supports his\r\ncontention by the statement that spermatozoa are not to be found in the\r\nFallopian tubes or on the surface of the ovaries. _Mayrhofer_ and\r\n_Wyder_ point out that the movement of the cilia of the ciliated\r\nepithelium is in the interior of the uterus in an upward direction, but\r\nin the Fallopian tubes is downwards in the direction of the uterus.\r\n\r\nThe contention of _Löwenthal_ was disproved by _Birch_ and _Hirschfeld_,\r\nwho, in a prostitute dying during the act of intercourse, found, fifteen\r\nhours after death, living spermatozoa in the Fallopian tubes. On the\r\nother hand, more recent investigations, those, for instance, of\r\n_Hofmeier_, _Mandl_, and _Bonn_, have confirmed the data given above\r\nwith regard to the direction of the ciliary movement in the interior of\r\nthe genital passages. Moreover, _O. Becker_ has shown that the ciliated\r\nepithelium of the tubes extends over the fimbriae and even on to the\r\nadjoining pavement epithelium of the peritoneum; and he believes that\r\nthe ciliary movement of this region keeps up a constant current, the\r\npurpose of which is to sweep the ovum into the ostium of the tube, and\r\nthence down towards the uterus. _Lode_ has adduced positive experimental\r\nevidence of the occurrence of such a movement of translation.\r\n\r\nThe general result of anatomical investigation is, that the conjugation\r\nof the ovum with the spermatozoön takes places in the ampulla of the\r\nFallopian tube; but it is established that fertilization may also take\r\nplace lower down in the tubes, or in the uterine cavity, or even on the\r\nsurface of the ovary, _i. e._, in the abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\nThe fertilization of the mature ovum—maturation having occurred within\r\nthe ovarian follicle before its rupture—has been shown by numerous\r\nresearches on the ova of other animals to consist in the fusion of the\r\nmale and the female nuclear substance; and it appears that of the\r\nenormous number of spermatozoa, estimated by _Lode_ at 226 million at a\r\nsingle ejaculation, that enter the female genital passage, but a single\r\none penetrates the ovum. Towards the head of this spermatozoön there\r\nextends from the surface of the ovum a process, flat at first, but\r\nbecoming more and more prominent, until it surrounds the head, and fuses\r\nwith it. The motile tail of the spermatozoön disappears, whilst the\r\nhead, which has now passed through the vitelline membrane and entered\r\nthe ovum, assumes the appearance of a nucleus, and is called the _male\r\npro-nucleus_. The original nucleus of the ovum has previously prepared\r\nitself for fertilization by the extrusion through the vitelline membrane\r\nof portions of its substance (known as _polar globules_), and now\r\nconstitutes the _female pro-nucleus_. Towards this latter, situated\r\nsomewhere near the centre of the cell, the male pro-nucleus continues to\r\nmove, the vitelline granules meanwhile being disposed round about it in\r\nradiating lines, forming a star-shaped figure. Having come into contact,\r\nthe two pronuclei fuse completely to form a new nucleus, the nucleus of\r\nthe now fertilized egg-cell. The result of fertilization is the\r\nformation of the first _segmentation-sphere_, from which, by further\r\nsubdivision, the new individual is formed. Thus is effected that which\r\n_Hippocrates_ describes in the words: “The seed possessed both by man\r\nand by woman, flow together from all parts of the body; the fruit is\r\nformed by the mingling of the two seeds.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 55A.—First Stage.

In 248 instances in which the date of\r\nthe fruitful coitus was exactly known, it was ascertained by Hasler that\r\nin 82½ per cent. of all cases, conception was effected in the fourteen\r\ndays succeeding the menstrual period. In general it may be stated that\r\nthe theory of the periodicity of ovulation and of the causal relation of\r\nthis process to menstruation, has not been shaken by the result of\r\nresearches recently undertaken by opponents of that theory; hence it\r\nappears that the fertilized ovum is the ovum of the last completed\r\nmenstruation.\r\n\r\nAlready in the writings of the old Indian physician _Susruta_, we find\r\nexpression of the view that the period that immediately succeeds the\r\ncessation of the menstrual flow is one most favourable to conception.\r\n“The time of generation,” he says, “is the twelfth night after the\r\ncommencement of menstruation.” In the Jewish _Talmud_, the day before\r\nthe onset of menstruation, and the days immediately succeeding the\r\ncessation of the flow, are indicated as those most favourable to the\r\noccurrence of conception; moreover, in the _Talmud_, notwithstanding the\r\nfact that intercourse during menstruation is prohibited on pain of\r\ndeath, and that coitus is not regarded as permissible until the lapse of\r\ntwelve clear days after the cessation of the flow, nevertheless the\r\nassertion is made that intercourse during menstruation may lead to\r\nconception.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 58. —Passage of spermatozoon through the zona pellucida of the\r\n    ovum of asterakanthion.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 59.—Ovum of scorpæna scrofa thirty-five minutes after\r\n    fertilization.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 60.—Male pro-nucleus and female pro-nucleus in fertilized ovum of\r\n    frog, prior to the formation of the segmentation nucleus.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Hippocrates_ writes: _Hae nempe post menstruam purgationem utero\r\nconcipat_. _Aristotle_ says: _Plerasque post mensum fluxum nonnullas\r\nvero fluentibus adhuc menstruis_. _Galen_ writes: _Hoc autem\r\nconceptionis tempus est vel incipientibus vel cessantibus menstruis_.\r\n\r\n_Soranus_ writes to a similar effect: Just as the soil is suitable only\r\nat certain seasons for the reception of the seed, so also in the human\r\nrace intercourse does not always take place at a time suited for the\r\nreception of the semen. To be effective, coitus must occur at the proper\r\ntime.... The act of intercourse that is to lead to conception may best\r\noccur either just before or just after the menstrual flow, when,\r\nmoreover, there is strong desire for the sexual embrace, and neither\r\nwhen the body is fasting, nor when it is full of drink and undigested\r\nfood. The time before menstruation is, however, unsuitable, for then the\r\nwomb is heavy from the flow of blood, and two conflicting tendencies\r\nwill come into operation, one for the absorption of material and the\r\nother for its outflow. During menstruation, again, conception is\r\nunlikely to occur, for then the semen is wetted and washed away by the\r\nflowing blood. The sole proper time is that immediately after the flow,\r\nwhen the womb has freed itself from its humours, and warmth and moisture\r\nstand in harmonious relationship.\r\n\r\nAmong many of the castes of Hindustan, it is a religious ordinance that\r\non the fourth day of menstruation a man shall have intercourse with his\r\nwife, “since this day is that on which conception is most likely to\r\noccur.” Indian physicians advise, in order to bring about conception,\r\n“that coitus be effected always as soon as the menstrual flow has\r\nceased, at the end of the day, and when the lotus has closed.” In Japan,\r\nmedical opinion is to the effect that a woman is capable of conceiving\r\nduring the first ten days after menstruation, but not later (_Ploss_ and\r\n_Bartels_).\r\n\r\nThe view that the first days of the intermenstrual interval are those\r\nmost favourable to the occurrence of conception, is further confirmed by\r\nthe statistical data collected by _Löwenfeld_, _Ahlfeld_, _Hecker_, and\r\n_Veit_; and it appears that as the date of the next menstruation is\r\napproached, there is a continual decline in the frequency of conception;\r\njust before the flow, conception hardly ever occurs. _Hensen_, from the\r\nrecords of 248 conceptions in which the date of the fruitful intercourse\r\nwas exactly known, draws the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n1. The greatest number of conceptions follow coitus effected during the\r\nfirst days after the cessation of the menstrual flow.\r\n\r\n2. When coitus is effected during menstruation, the probability of\r\nconception increases day by day as the end of the flow is approached.\r\n\r\n3. The number of conceptions following coitus effected shortly before\r\nmenstruation is minimal.\r\n\r\n4. However, there is no single day either of the menstrual flow or of\r\nthe intermenstrual interval, on which the possibility of the occurrence\r\nof conception can be excluded.\r\n\r\n_Feokstitow_ has drawn up from statistical data an ideal\r\n“conception-curve,” which teaches that conception most readily ensues\r\nupon coitus effected soon after the end of the menstrual flow, in the\r\nfirst week, that is to say, of the intermenstrual interval; moreover,\r\nthe curve shows that the highest percentage of conceptions occurs on the\r\nvery first day after the cessation of the flow, and that after this day\r\nthe percentage of conceptions declines. The percentage frequency of\r\nconceptions from coitus effected on the last day of menstruation, and on\r\nthe first, ninth, eleventh, and twenty-third days, respectively, of the\r\nintermenstrual interval, is expressed by the ratio 48 : 62 : 13 : 9 : 1;\r\nand between the points given, the course of the curve is almost\r\nrectilinear. The probability of the occurrence of conception on the\r\ntwenty-third day of the interval (on which day the curve reaches its\r\nlowest point), is one-sixty-second of the maximum probability.\r\n\r\nThe proper performance of coitus depends upon the _potentia coeundi_ of\r\nthe male; the attainment of conception depends upon his _potentia\r\ngenerandi_. The _potentia generandi_ demands from the man the functional\r\ncompetence of the testicles, the perviousness of the seminal passages\r\n(namely, of the vasa deferentia and the urethra), the secretion of a\r\nnormal semen, and, finally, a proper formation of the penis, whereby\r\nduring ejaculation the semen may be deposited in sufficient proximity to\r\nthe os uteri externum.\r\n\r\nNormal semen is a whitish, semi-transparent fluid, of the consistency of\r\nthin cream. It contains aggregations of a nearly spherical shape,\r\nconsisting of a vitreous, transparent, colourless or light yellow,\r\ngelatinous, elastic substance. Under the microscope this substance has a\r\nhyaline appearance, and exhibits in its interior innumerable clear\r\nspaces of varying size, which are apparently filled with a clear fluid.\r\nNot infrequently, these spaces are extremely narrow and therewith\r\ngreatly elongated and disposed in parallels, so that the whole substance\r\nthus obtains a striated appearance. When treated with water, this\r\nmaterial becomes whitish and non-transparent, and assumes under the\r\nmicroscope a finely granular aspect. When allowed to stand without\r\nagitation for twenty-four hours, this substance dissolves and becomes so\r\nintimately mingled with the seminal fluid that it can no longer be\r\nclearly differentiated therefrom. In all probability it is merely a\r\nsecretory product of the seminal vesicles.\r\n\r\nThe truly fluid portion of the semen contains the following\r\nmorphological elements:\r\n\r\n1. Microscopic aggregations of hyaline substance, variously shaped.\r\n\r\n2. Very numerous granules, small and extremely pale, albuminous in their\r\nnature, and disappearing on treatment with acetic acid.\r\n\r\n3. A small number of rounded or oval cells, about the size of\r\nleucocytes, containing one, or sometimes two small round nuclei.\r\n\r\n4. Prostatic calculi. These are an inconstant constituent, but are very\r\nfrequently met with after repeated coitus. According to some observers\r\nthey are derived also from the bladder and urethra. They are\r\ndistinguished by their yellowish colour, their irregular form (sometimes\r\ntriangular, sometimes rounded or oval), and by their characteristic\r\nstructure. They are composed of a substance arranged in concentric\r\nlaminæ, which in the centre has a granulated appearance; they often\r\nexhibit one or more oval nuclei.\r\n\r\n5. Spermatozoa in countless numbers.\r\n\r\nIn exceptional cases we find as additional morphological\r\nelements, especially in elderly people, scattered erythrocytes,\r\ncylinder-epithelium cells, and masses or granules of yellow pigment.\r\n\r\nThe spermatozoa are about fifty micromillimetres in length. Two parts\r\nmay be distinguished in each, a head and a tail. The head, four or five\r\nmicromillimetres in length, is flattened, and differs in apparent\r\nshape—though generally more or less pear-shaped—according as to whether\r\nit is seen sideways or on the flat.\r\n\r\nThe tail, which is about forty-five micromillimetres in length, narrows\r\nfrom before backwards. The fine posterior extremity is said to contain\r\nthe contractile element, so that it is upon this portion that the\r\nfamiliar movements of the spermatozoa depend (Fig. 61).\r\n\r\nThe spermatozoa are made up of a substance very rich in sodium chloride,\r\nand strongly resistent to reagents and to putrefaction. In consequence\r\nof their richness in mineral constituents, the ash, when they are\r\ncalcined, retains their original form.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the spermatozoa can be properly observed only in fresh,\r\npure semen (Fig. 62).\r\n\r\nIf freshly ejaculated semen is treated with water, the movements of the\r\nspermatozoa very shortly cease, and their tails become rolled up in a\r\nspiral form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 61.—a. b. c.

(After Bizzozero.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 62.—Normal semen.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf semen is left undisturbed for twenty-four hours or longer, the\r\nvitreous substance dissolves in the surrounding fluid, and this latter\r\nseparates into two layers, an upper which is thinner, and a lower, which\r\nis thicker and non-transparent. In the former, the morphological\r\nelements are found but sparingly, whilst in the latter, they are\r\nplentiful. In addition to the elements already described, we find often\r\ntwo varieties of crystals. One of these varieties, which appears only\r\nwhen decomposition is far advanced, consists of ammonium magnesium\r\nphosphate. The other variety has a chemical composition not yet\r\ndetermined. These crystals belong to the monoclinic system, forming\r\nprisms or pyramids, often with curved surfaces; they are colourless or\r\nlight yellow; they lie superimposed, often forming beautiful star-shaped\r\nfigures. They are soluble in mineral and vegetable acids, and in\r\nammonia, but are insoluble in alcohol, ether, and chloroform; they are\r\nremarkably resistent to the solvent powers of cold water, but not so to\r\nthose of boiling water. _Shreiner_ has proved that these crystals\r\nconsist of a phosphate of a base which is represented by the formula C2.\r\nH5. N. According to _Fürbringer_, these crystals are produced as a\r\nresult of the action of the semen upon the prostatic secretion.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of semen ejaculated during coitus is very variable,\r\ndepending upon the age and size of the individual and the formation of\r\nhis testicles, upon his individual sexual capacity, and upon the\r\nquestion whether antecedently there has been sexual excess on the one\r\nhand or long continued continence on the other. In general, the quantity\r\nof semen ejaculated at one time varies between 0.75 and 6 c.c. (10 to\r\n100 minims).\r\n\r\nIf healthy, normal semen, with adequate fertilizing potency, is properly\r\npreserved from cold and light, we may, even after the lapse of\r\ntwenty-four hours, find under the microscope spermatozoa still engaged\r\nin active movement. _Ultzmann_ employs for the description of a drop of\r\nfresh semen, the comparison that it is full of movement, “like a stirred\r\nup ant-heap.” Influenced by the whiplike lashings of the tail, the\r\nspermatozoön moves steadily forwards, finding its way through the\r\nnarrowest passages on the microscopic field without striking any of the\r\ncellular structures that may lie in its path. The longer the semen\r\nremains under observation, the less active are these movements of the\r\nspermatozoa, for after ejaculation they gradually die, exhibiting after\r\ndeath an extended, or at most a slightly curved tail; those spermatozoa,\r\non the other hand, that were dead before ejaculation, have the tail\r\nspirally twisted, rolled up, or acutely bent. In the case of spermatozoa\r\nwhich have been destroyed by the action of some other deleterious\r\nsecretion, as by urine or by acid vaginal secretion, such a condition of\r\nthe tail is very commonly seen. When the semen is treated with water,\r\nthe movements of the spermatozoa soon cease, and the ends of their tails\r\nfrequently roll up to form loops. By the addition, however, of\r\nconcentrated solutions of neutral salts, of albumen, of urea, etc., it\r\nis possible to reanimate these motionless spermatozoa, so that they once\r\nmore are seen to perform active movements. Moderately concentrated\r\nanimal secretions of an alkaline reaction are favourable to the motor\r\nactivity of the spermatozoa, whilst on the other hand dilute and acid\r\nsecretions, such as urine, acid mucus (including the acid vaginal\r\nmucus), and catarrhal secretions, even when alkaline in reaction, have a\r\ndepressant influence on this activity. Caustic potash and caustic soda\r\nstimulate the movements of the spermatozoa. When they are cooled down to\r\na temperature below 15° C. (59° F.), the movements cease entirely. Salts\r\nof the heavy metals, and mineral acids in solution, also bring their\r\nmovements to a pause. Frequent repetition of coitus causes a diminution\r\nin the number and in the motor activity of the spermatozoa.\r\n\r\nSemen which contains no spermatozoa, or in which the spermatozoa are\r\nmotionless, is absolutely devoid of fertilizing power; in the case of\r\nsuch semen, it makes no difference whatever that the external genitals\r\nof the man generating it are strongly formed, that his testicles are of\r\nnormal size, and that erection and ejaculation take place promptly. Of\r\nvery little value, though not absolutely sterile, is semen containing\r\nvery few living spermatozoa, or, among very numerous motionless\r\nspermatozoa, containing a few only that are engaged in active movement.\r\nSuspect, is semen which does not possess the normal light greyish white\r\ntint, but is brownish-red, brownish-yellow, yellow, or violet; these\r\nvariations in colour indicating an admixture with the semen of varying\r\nquantities of blood or pus, in consequence of disease of the urethra,\r\nthe prostate, the seminal vesicles, or some other part of the uropoietic\r\nsystem; such admixtures seriously impair the quality of the semen. An\r\nunfavourable judgment must also be passed on semen which, at each\r\nsuccessive ejaculation, is voided in very small quantities only—from\r\nhalf a drachm to a drachm. When thus scanty, semen is often found to\r\ncontain an exceptionally large proportion of dead spermatozoa. We may\r\nregard very favourably semen which is voided in quantities considerably\r\nin excess of the average; sometimes, when there is a veritable\r\npolyspermia, there may be an ounce or upwards, more than three times as\r\nmuch as normal—provided, of course, that this semen so richly voided is\r\nof a satisfactory quality, and contains an ample proportion of active\r\nspermatozoa. The most valuable characteristic in semen is exhibited when\r\nthe spermatozoa it contains are not only very numerous and vigorously\r\nactive, but when they are also very long-lived, when, that is to say,\r\nthey retain the power of active movement sometimes for as long as three\r\ndays. A decisive opinion as to the quality of a man’s semen can be given\r\nonly as the result of precise and repeated microscopic examinations, and\r\nthe medical man must be most careful, when in his first examination he\r\nhas not been able to detect the presence of any living spermatozoa, to\r\nabstain from giving, on that account alone, an adverse decision—from\r\npronouncing sentence of death on the man’s reproductive potency.\r\n\r\nIt has not hitherto been accurately determined how long spermatozoa can\r\ncontinue to live in the interior of the uterus, although the point is of\r\ngreat importance, not only in relation to conception, but also in regard\r\nto the theory of menstruation. _Percy_ has published a case in which,\r\neight and a half days after the last coitus, he saw living spermatozoa\r\nemerge from the os uteri externum. _Sims_ bases upon his own researches\r\nthe decisive opinion that in the vaginal mucus, spermatozoa can never\r\nsurvive longer than twelve hours, but states that in the mucus of the\r\ncervical canal they can live much longer. If thirty-six to forty hours\r\nafter coitus, we examine the cervical mucus under the microscope, we\r\ncommonly find living and dead spermatozoa in about equal numbers. Many\r\nof the living ones will survive their removal from the cervix for as\r\nmuch as six hours longer.\r\n\r\nOf especial interest are the conditions which are liable to deprive a\r\nman of the power to produce fertilizing semen. In the first place must\r\nbe mentioned congenital absence of both testicles—a condition which, in\r\notherwise normally formed male individuals, is one of extreme rarity.\r\nCongenital absence of _one_ testicle is less rare, and is usually\r\naccompanied by absence also of the epidydimis, vas deferens, and seminal\r\nvesicle of the same side. The potentia gestandi of a monorchid depends\r\nupon the proper development of his single testicle, and the functional\r\ncapacity of this organ must be ascertained by a careful microscopic\r\nexamination of his semen. Much more frequent than absence of the\r\ntesticle, though still sufficiently rare, is the condition of\r\ncryptorchism, non-descent of one or both testicles, a state not\r\nnecessarily associated with functional incapacity of the organ. Most\r\ncommonly, however, an undescended testis is an imperfectly developed\r\ntestis, and in the very great majority of cases the ejaculated fluid\r\ncontains no spermatozoa.\r\n\r\nA further cause of the lack of potent semen is atrophy of the testicles\r\nwith notable diminution in the size of the glands, and more or less\r\ncomplete disappearance of the seminiferous tubules and their cellular\r\ncontents. This state is rarely congenital, being nearly always acquired:\r\nin consequence of inflammatory conditions affecting the testicle proper\r\nor the epididymis (syphilitic inflammation, especially, is apt to lead\r\nto overgrowth of the interstitial connective tissue and to gradual\r\ndestruction by pressure of the seminal tubules)[46]; or in consequence\r\nof the pressure of a hernia, a varicocele, a hydrocele, or a tubercular,\r\ncarcinomatous, or other new growth; or in consequence of constitutional\r\ndisorders, especially long-lasting, severe, and exhausting diseases,\r\nsuch as diphtheria, diabetes, or chronic alcoholism; in consequence of\r\ndiseases affecting that portion of the central nervous system from which\r\nthe nerves supplying the genital organs arise; in consequence of\r\ndegenerative changes resulting from sexual excesses; or, finally, in\r\nconsequence of senile changes, such as fatty changes in the cells of the\r\nseminiferous tubules. Certain drugs also, digitalis, salicylic acid,\r\nmercury, iodide of potassium, arsenic, and morphine, have an\r\nunfavourable influence alike on the quality of the testicular secretion\r\nand on the potency of the individual. _Von Gyurkovechky_ reports that in\r\nBosnia a plant locally known as “neven” is employed among the peasantry\r\nfor the temporary suppression of sexual potency, wives giving it to\r\ntheir husbands when the latter are about to leave them and go upon a\r\njourney, and sprinkling the leaves of the plant among the underclothing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 63—Semen consisting chiefly of sperm-crystals, cylindrical\r\n    epithelium and small granules exhibiting molecular movement—but\r\n    containing _no_ spermatozoa.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy the name of azoospermia is denoted a condition whose existence can be\r\ndetermined only by microscopic examination.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this affection has normal potentia coeundi, the semen is\r\nejaculated in quite normal fashion, and it is its constitution only that\r\nis faulty. In appearance it is extremely fluid, and is somewhat cloudy;\r\nits sediment contains molecular detritus and spermatic crystals, but no\r\nspermatozoa (Fig. 63). If the medical man makes it his rule, in all\r\ncases in which he is consulted on account of sterility, in deciding how\r\nfar this sterility is dependent on the condition of the husband, not to\r\nconfine himself solely to the customary questions, whether intercourse\r\nis regularly practised, whether before or after menstruation, etc.—but\r\nif in every case he makes a careful examination of the semen under the\r\nmicroscope, he will be astonished to learn the comparative frequency\r\nwith which he will note the complete or nearly complete absence of\r\nspermatozoa. This condition of azoospermia may be permanent or\r\ntransitory.\r\n\r\nTo _Kehrer_ belongs the credit of having pointed out that sterility is\r\nless often due to impotence or to aspermatism than to azoospermia—a\r\ncondition often unsuspected by husband and wife, and one to be diagnosed\r\nby the physician only after repeated microscopic examinations of the\r\nsemen. For this reason, indeed, its existence is often overlooked.\r\n_Kehrer_ believes himself to be justified in asserting that one-fourth\r\nof all cases of sterility (if not indeed more) must be referred to\r\nconditions affecting the husband, and most often to azoospermia; hence\r\nhe concludes, that the husband must still more often be regarded as the\r\none to blame for the occurrence of sterility, when the cases are borne\r\nin mind in which a man marries with an imperfectly healed gonorrhœa, and\r\ninfects his wife, giving rise to a chronic tubo-uterine blennorrhœa, and\r\nultimately to sealing up of the tubes and to sterility.\r\n\r\nComplete absence or marked scarcity of spermatozoa in the semen may\r\noccur also without any change in the testicle that can be detected by an\r\nexternal examination, as a consequence of contusions of the testicle, or\r\nof gonorrhœal inflammation of the epididymis or vas deferens; further as\r\na sequel of severe general diseases, long-continued physical exertion,\r\nor great sexual excess.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, a microscopical examination reveals, not azoospermia, but\r\noligozoöspermia, that is to say, the number of living spermatozoa in the\r\nsemen is remarkably small. Or, again, the anomaly may be of this\r\ncharacter that the spermatozoa are smaller than normal, that they are\r\nmotionless, and that their tails are broken off—such are the\r\npeculiarities, as a rule, of the semen of old men.\r\n\r\nA less common condition than azoospermia, but one the pathological\r\nimportance of which is equally great, is aspermatism, in which the man,\r\nneither during coitus, nor in any other form of sexual excitement, is\r\nable to ejaculate any semen. This condition may be congenital or\r\nacquired; it may be permanent, or transitory (lasting a few weeks or\r\nmonths). In these cases we have to do with organic changes in the\r\ntesticles, diseases of the prostate, gonorrhœal processes, or nervous\r\ndisturbances resulting in a loss of irritability in the reflex centre\r\nfor ejaculation. Aspermatism in the narrower sense of the term, a\r\ncondition, that is to say, in which there is total suspension of the\r\nactivity of all the three glands which combine to secrete the composite\r\nfluid known as semen, namely, of the testicle, the prostate, and the\r\nseminal vesicles—is, according to _Fürbringer_, probably non-existent.\r\nThe pathological state underlying aspermatism would rather appear to be,\r\nnot a failure to secrete semen, but a failure to ejaculate it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 64.—Oligozoöspermia. a. Living spermatozoa, b. Dead spermatozoa,\r\n    c. Pus corpuscles, d. Erythrocyte, e. Seminal granules.\r\n]\r\n\r\nLast of all, we have to speak of conception without copulation, of\r\nartificial fertilization. In consequence of the mechanical hindrances\r\nwhich in many cases prevent the entrance of the semen into the interior\r\nof the uterus, the idea has arisen to introduce the semen by means of\r\ninstruments directly into the cervical canal, dispensing with the\r\nnatural act of copulation. Experience long ago gained in artificial\r\npisciculture, no doubt gave rise to this idea. _Spallanzani_ and _Rossi_\r\nby means of a syringe injected the semen of a dog into the vagina of a\r\nbitch, the procedure resulting in impregnation. _Girault_ appears to\r\nhave been the first,[47] in the year 1838, to introduce semen\r\nartificially into the human uterus, if we leave out of consideration the\r\nexperiment of _Léseurs_, who introduced a tampon moistened with semen\r\ninto the interior of the vagina. The procedure employed by _Girault_ is\r\nthus described: The patient having been placed in the position usually\r\nemployed for gynecological examination, a canula resembling a male\r\ncatheter with the eye in its point, and with a funnel-shaped enlargement\r\nat the opposite extremity, is introduced into the uterus, this\r\ninstrument having first been prepared by moistening its interior with\r\nmucilage and filling it with semen; by insufflation, the semen is now\r\nexpelled into the uterine cavity. It is stated that neither uterine\r\ncolic nor any other dangerous symptom has ever been brought on by this\r\nprocedure. The experiments were made at various periods between the year\r\n1838 and the year 1861; they were ten in number, and of these eight\r\nproved successful, two unsuccessful. In the ten cases, the total number\r\nof insufflations made was twenty-one—the minimum number in any single\r\ncase being one, the maximum five. In one case, the insufflation was\r\neffected immediately after the cessation of menstruation; in the\r\nmajority, from one to four days after the cessation of menstruation; in\r\none case twelve days, in one case twenty-three days, after the cessation\r\nof the flow. _Gautier_, instead of insufflations, has employed\r\ninjections of semen, using two injections in each case, one just before\r\nmenstruation was expected, the other a day or two after the cessation of\r\nthe flow. _Marion Sims_ endeavoured in twenty-seven cases to bring about\r\nconception by the injection of semen into the uterus; in one of these\r\ncases only was the desired result obtained. In this latter instance the\r\npatient was twenty-eight years of age, had been married for nine years,\r\nbut had remained barren. Throughout her menstrual life, she had suffered\r\nmore or less from dysmenorrhœa, often accompanied by severe\r\nconstitutional disturbance, such as syncope, vomiting, and headache.\r\nLocal examination disclosed the existence of retroversion of the uterus\r\nwith hypertrophy of the posterior wall, an indurated, conical cervix,\r\nwith stricture of the cervical canal, especially in the region of the os\r\nuteri internum. In addition to all these mechanical obstacles to\r\nconception, it was found that the semen was never retained in the vagina\r\nafter coitus. _Sims_ examined the patient immediately after coitus had\r\ntaken place, but never found a single drop of semen in the vagina,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that this fluid had been ejaculated in\r\nabundance. _Sim’s_ first care was to bring about reposition of the\r\nuterus, and to keep the organ in its proper place by the insertion of a\r\nsuitable pessary. Injections of semen were then undertaken, and were\r\ncontinued throughout a period of nearly twelve months. In two instances,\r\nthe injection was effected immediately before the onset of the menstrual\r\nflow; in eight instances it was effected at varying times (two to seven\r\ndays) after the cessation of the flow. At first, three drops of semen\r\nwere injected, but later only half a drop. The semen (first ejaculated\r\ninto the vagina during normal intercourse) was injected by means of a\r\nglass syringe, which was kept in a vessel of warm water at a temperature\r\nof 98° F. Since during the removal of the instrument from the water and\r\nits insertion into the vagina, some fall in temperature necessarily\r\noccurred in the vagina, _Sims_ allowed the syringe to remain for some\r\nminutes in the vagina before he drew the semen into it, in order that he\r\nmight feel assured that syringe and vagina had regained the temperature\r\nmost adapted to the vital activity of the spermatozoa. The nozzle of the\r\nsyringe was then carefully introduced into the cervical canal, and half\r\na drop of semen was slowly injected into the uterine cavity. For two or\r\nthree hours after the operation, the patient remained lying quiet in\r\nbed. After the tenth experiment, conception ensued—the first recorded\r\ncase of artificial fertilization in the human species.\r\n\r\nWith right, however, this case of _Sim’s_ was not regarded as\r\nconclusive, since both before and after the injection, ordinary coitus\r\nhad been effected, and it is therefore impossible to determine whether\r\nthe fertilizing spermatozoön was one of those introduced by means of the\r\nsyringe, or in the antecedent or subsequent coitus—more especially in\r\nview of the fact that by the insertion of a pessary _Sims_ had,\r\npreviously to undertaking the injections, restored the uterus to a\r\nposition more suited to the occurrence of conception in the natural\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIn a case which a priori seemed exceedingly well adapted for the\r\nperformance of artificial fertilization, one of marked hypospadias in a\r\nman whose semen was abundant and contained a large number of vigorously\r\nmoving spermatozoa, I saw this experiment fail, in spite of all possible\r\ncare in its performance. In fact, not a single conclusive instance of\r\nsuccessful artificial fertilization in the human species is known to me,\r\nthough I have seen reports of numerous disagreeable and even dangerous\r\nresults of attempts to effect it. Both parametritis and perimetritis\r\nhave occurred in such cases; and semen, being a material in a state of\r\nmost intense molecular movement, may be regarded as extremely liable to\r\nnoxious transformations.\r\n\r\n_Sim’s_ procedure has been modified by other gynecologists. Thus,\r\n_Courty’s_ plan was that during coitus the semen should be collected in\r\na condom, fitting not too closely, from which receptacle it was drawn up\r\ninto a syringe and carefully injected into the cervical canal. _Pajot’s_\r\nplan was that the semen should be ejaculated into the vagina in natural\r\ncoitus, and should thence be pressed into the uterine cavity by means of\r\na piston-like instrument introduced into the vagina.\r\n\r\nIn London, _Harley_ frequently made the experiment of injecting semen\r\ninto the uterine cavity, but in all cases without any result.\r\n\r\n_P. Muller_, in two cases, on account of extreme anteflexion of the\r\nuterus, performed this experiment. Though the general conditions were in\r\nboth cases extremely favourable, in neither instance was there any\r\nresult. It must, however, be mentioned that in one of his cases only had\r\nthere been any preliminary examination of the semen under the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\n_Fritsch_ reports a case in which gonorrhœal secretion was injected in\r\nplace of semen. Peritonitis, which for a month endangered life, was the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, _Lutaud_ has earnestly advocated artificial impregnation in\r\ncases of sterility in which all other means have failed. It is obvious\r\nthat it would be useless to employ this measure after the menopause, or\r\nin women in whom menstrual activity has ceased prematurely, with\r\nsimultaneous disappearance of all menstrual molimina. Equally useless\r\nwould it be in uterine atrophy and in cases of irremediable malformation\r\nof the female genitals. Further contra-indications, according to\r\n_Lutaud_, are offered by chronic pelvic peritonitis, since here, on\r\naccount of the obliteration of the lumen of the Fallopian tubes, the\r\noperation is foredoomed to failure. Chronic inflammatory states of the\r\nuterus and its mucous membrane, will also render the attempt useless.\r\nMoreover, it is a condition indispensable to success that the semen to\r\nbe employed shall have been examined microscopically, and shall have\r\nbeen found to be thoroughly healthy. The operation has the greatest\r\nprospect of success when undertaken from three to two days before the\r\ndue date of menstruation. The method employed is that of _Sims_. If\r\nafter the first attempt, the due menstruation should begin, the\r\ninjection should be repeated a week after the flow has ceased; the\r\nattempt should not, however, be repeated more than about six times in\r\nall, since the probability of success rapidly diminishes with each\r\nsuccessive endeavour. Before the operation is undertaken, the\r\npermeability of the cervical canal must be ascertained. Further, in\r\norder that the spermatozoa shall be placed in conditions in which they\r\nhave the best possible chance of survival, a weak alkaline solution,\r\nsuch as 1 per cent. of potassium bicarbonate, should as a preliminary\r\nmeasure be injected into the vagina.\r\n\r\n_Lutaud_ thus describes the procedure he employs. Immediately after the\r\nwoman has had intercourse with her husband, a Fergusson’s speculum is\r\nintroduced into the vagina, the patient remaining in the dorsal\r\ndecubitus. As the speculum passes in, its margin scrapes the surface of\r\nthe vagina, and by this means the semen is collected in the vicinity of\r\nthe cervix. The semen is then drawn up into a Pravaz syringe or an\r\nanalogous instrument, such as a uterine catheter armed at one end with a\r\nrubber ball. The fluid is then carefully injected into the cervical\r\ncanal, or preferably into the uterine cavity, great care being taken not\r\nto injure the mucous membrane in any way, since the slightest bleeding\r\nmay nullify the whole procedure. Finally, a small tampon of absorbent\r\ncotton-wool is inserted into the os uteri externum. For some hours the\r\nwoman must remain quiet in bed; the tampon is not removed for ten hours.\r\nAs regards results, _Lutaud_ informs us that he has in this way treated\r\ntwenty-six cases. In twenty-two of these, failure was complete; in one\r\ncase, success was partial—the patient was impregnated, but abortion\r\noccurred two weeks later; in another case, abortion occurred after three\r\nmonths pregnancy; finally, in two cases, success was complete.\r\n\r\nIndications for the employment of artificial impregnation are: first,\r\nthe existence of stenosis in the upper part of the cervical canal,\r\nespecially stenosis from flexion, provided, of course, that other\r\nmeasures are contra-indicated or have been fruitlessly employed;\r\nsecondly, a deleterious character of the secretion of the cervical\r\ncanal; thirdly, extreme cases of hypospadias in the male. _Haussmann_\r\nrecommends the employment of artificial impregnation in cases in which\r\nthe spermatozoa are found to enter the cervical canal, but fail to pass\r\nthrough the os uteri internum. Whilst artificial impregnation is\r\ntheoretically a sound measure, yet in the practice the indications for\r\nits performance are by no means easy to establish. For, in cases in\r\nwhich there is some mechanical hindrance to the contact of the\r\nspermatozoön with the ovum (and it is for such cases only that this\r\nmethod of artificial fertilization can properly be employed), it is\r\noften extremely difficult, and may even be quite impossible, to exclude\r\nthe possibility of there being some failure in ovulation itself, or in\r\nthe maturation of the ova; or, again, sterility may depend, not on the\r\nfact that no ova are fertilized, but on the fact that when fertilized\r\nthey always fail, for some reason, to find a resting place in the\r\nuterus; in a word, in any case in which sterility appears to be due to\r\nmechanical obstacles to conception, it may in reality be due to some\r\nother disease which has escaped recognition, some organic disease of the\r\nuterus, the tubes, the ovaries, of the periuterine tissues.\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be remembered that the manipulation is far from easy in\r\nits performance. Above all, the semen must be subjected to a most\r\nrigorous microscopical examination in respect of its fertilizing\r\ncapacity. But this examination cannot be made in the case of the semen\r\nthat is actually used for the attempt at artificial fertilization; it\r\ncan only be done with an earlier specimen from the same man. If the\r\nsemen contains no living spermatozoa, or very few only and these\r\nsluggish in their movements, still more if it contains pus corpuscles or\r\ngonococci, all idea of its employment for artificial fertilization must\r\nbe rejected.\r\n\r\nThe method employed by _Sims_, in which the semen is drawn into a\r\nsyringe inserted into the vagina post coitum, is one which I am not able\r\nto recommend, since in this way together with the semen some vaginal\r\nmucus is drawn up, thus, instead of pure semen, we inject into the\r\nvagina semen mixed with various impurities, and more especially with an\r\nacid secretion known to be unfavourable to the life of the spermatozoa—a\r\ncircumstance that will doubtless explain many of the failures that have\r\nhitherto taken place. It is certainly better that the semen of the\r\nhusband should be collected in a rubber condom. The preservation of the\r\nmaterial to be injected at a suitable temperature (the normal\r\nbody-temperature), is by no means easy. The syringe, an ordinary Braun’s\r\nuterine syringe, is first disinfected, and then lies ready in water of\r\nthe proper temperature. The semen is rapidly drawn up into the syringe,\r\nthe nozzle of which is then passed down to the fundus uteri. Quite a\r\nsmall quantity of semen will suffice. After the manipulation, which\r\nshould of course be undertaken at the time most favourable to\r\nconception, just after menstruation, the woman should lie quiet in bed\r\nfor some hours.\r\n\r\nIn considering the probability of a successful issue to any such attempt\r\nto secure artificial fertilization, we cannot leave out of consideration\r\nthe likelihood that that result may be prejudiced by the lack of all\r\nnormal sexual feeling on the part of the wife; concerning the\r\nsignificance of such feeling in relation to the sexual act, we have\r\nhowever as yet no certain knowledge.\r\n\r\nThat this procedure of artificial fertilization is extremely\r\ndisagreeable to all concerned therein, the physician not excepted, and\r\nthat various moral and social considerations can be alleged against it,\r\nis incontestable. It is indeed recorded that in Bordeaux a legal penalty\r\nwas inflicted on a medical man who undertook to bring about artificial\r\nfertilization. The Society of Medical Jurists debated this matter, and\r\ncame to the conclusion that, whilst a medical man was not justified in\r\nrecommending the practice, neither was he justified in refusing to\r\nundertake it when requested by his patients. In Paris, a candidate for\r\nthe degree of Doctor of Medicine made artificial fecundation the subject\r\nof his thesis, and maintained that its practice, when effected with all\r\nproper social precautions and according to scientific principles, was\r\npossible, reasonable, useful, and moral, and that in many instances it\r\nshould be recommended by the physician. After a long and stormy debate,\r\nthe Faculty of Medicine determined to reject the thesis and to destroy\r\nall specimens of it already printed, on the ground that “they feared, if\r\nthey gave their sanction to the practice, that a number of more or less\r\nunscrupulous physicians would make that sanction the basis of improper\r\npractices, dangerous alike to the family and to the state, since the\r\noperative method under consideration was one likely to be eagerly\r\nexploited by the whole tribe of medical charlatans.” This weighty\r\npronouncement would appear to be sufficient ground for rejecting\r\nartificial fecundation as a matter of routine practice; still, very\r\nexceptional cases may be encountered in which it may be seized as an\r\nultimum refugium.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Pathology of Copulation._\r\n\r\nThe act of copulation may be interfered with or entirely prevented by\r\npathological conditions affecting the genital canal of the woman, and\r\nalso by disturbances of the nervous system—naturally also by any\r\nabnormality affecting the performance of the male partner in the act.\r\n\r\nAbnormality of the hymen, such as excessive strength and rigidity,\r\nrendering the organ unduly persistent, is a not infrequent hindrance to\r\nintercourse, one that sometimes is not overcome even after years of\r\nmarried life; to such a state of affairs ignorance on the part of the\r\nmarried pair in respect to the proper method of intercourse, lack of\r\nsufficient sexual power on the part of the male, or inflammation of the\r\nfossa navicularis brought on by maladroit attempts at penetration, may\r\ncontribute, likewise undue passivity on the part of the female partner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 65.—Septate Hymen, the septum having a tendinous consistency.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA notable and sometimes an insuperable obstacle (of which it has been\r\nwritten, _nec Hannibal quidem has portas perfringere valuisset_) is\r\nconstituted by that abnormality of the hymen in which the aperture in\r\nthat membrane is guarded by a sagittally placed or sometimes oblique\r\nseptum, dense and almost tendinous in structure. In a woman of\r\ntwenty-four years, who for two years had lived in sterile wedlock, I\r\nfound such a tendinous hymen septum. She had menstruated regularly since\r\nthe age of seventeen years, but always painfully. She complained that\r\nher husband was “very weak,” inasmuch as on her bridal night he was\r\nunable to succeed in completing intercourse, and since then whenever he\r\nattempted intercourse, premature ejaculation resulted, before\r\npenetration of the penis had been effected. In consequence of this\r\nrepeated ineffectual sexual excitement, she had herself become very\r\nnervous. On local examination, I found an elongated oval hymen, not\r\ncompletely covering the vaginal orifice, rather strong and thick, and\r\ndivided in two halves by a median sagittal septum, of a densely\r\ntendinous consistency. On either side of the septum, the vaginal orifice\r\nwould admit no more than the head of an ordinary uterine sound. I\r\ndivided this septum, and was informed later that the woman had become\r\npregnant as a result of the first subsequent act of intercourse (Fig.\r\n65).\r\n\r\nA remarkable case of abnormality of the hymen is recorded by\r\n_Heitzmann_, having been observed by him in a woman aged twenty-seven\r\nyears. In this instance, the hymen was represented by a swelling, smooth\r\non the surface and separated from the nymphæ by a deep furrow. Behind\r\nthis swelling, between it and the posterior commissure, there was a deep\r\ndepression, into which the finger could be passed to a depth of an inch\r\nand a half or more. Anteriorly, the very firm and fleshy prominence was\r\nbounded by a ridge, from the middle of which to the urethral orifice ran\r\na short but strong and tense septum. Right and left of this septum were\r\nsmall apertures, with difficulty admitting the point of a probe. Between\r\nthe anterior extremity of the septum and the urethral orifice was a\r\nnodular representative of the swelling normally present in this\r\nsituation. Surrounding the urethral orifice were two or three additional\r\nsmall nodules. The two lateral margins of the hymen were prolonged\r\naround the urethral orifice, and united in front thereof to form a\r\nraphe, which could be traced as far as the base of the clitoris. The\r\nyoung woman had been married for some months, and asserted that she had\r\nrepeatedly had intercourse. With such a condition of the female\r\ngenitals, penetration of the penis into the vagina was however quite\r\nimpossible. During coitus, the penis must have been inserted into the\r\naforesaid depression behind the swelling, which was sufficiently\r\nextensible for the purpose.\r\n\r\nA less serious hindrance to intercourse, but one more frequently\r\nencountered, is a partial persistence of the septum of the hymeneal\r\norifice, in such a manner that there is a projecting tongue of membrane\r\nfrom the anterior and posterior margins of the orifice, partially\r\nblocking this latter; or there may be a single median projection only,\r\neither in front or behind. Such processes may be remarkable alike for\r\ntheir size and their shape. _Liman_ describes a cordiform hymeneal\r\norifice, constituted by an anterior or posterior protection of the kind\r\nhere described.\r\n\r\nIn cases of imperforate hymen in which the occlusion of the vagina is\r\nnot complete, impregnation may in rare instances occur, even though\r\nproper intromission of the penis is quite impossible. Cases of this kind\r\nhave been observed by _Scanzoni_, _Horton_, _K. Braun_, _Leopold_,\r\n_Brill_, _Breisky_, and others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 66.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn most of these cases there was a thick, dense, “imperforate,” or\r\nrather _persistent_ hymen, with an orifice no larger than the head of an\r\nordinary probe, notwithstanding which pregnancy had occurred. The cases\r\nreported by _Brill_ were of a different character, being those of two\r\nyoung unmarried Russian girls, with normal undestroyed hymens, who were\r\nfound to be pregnant. According to _Brill_, such cases are by no means\r\nuncommon among the peasantry of Little Russia, where the barbarous\r\npractice prevails of adolescent girls and boys sleeping together. In\r\nthese circumstances, sexual intercourse takes place, but, from fear of\r\nconsequences, it is often incomplete. Hence, in occasional cases,\r\nresults pregnancy in a young girl with intact hymen.\r\n\r\nIn the first complete act of intercourse, the defloration of the virgin,\r\nthe hymen is as a rule torn in several directions, and in consequence\r\nthere is usually moderate bleeding. The lacerations of the hymen soon\r\nskin over. When the initial coitus is effected maladroitly or roughly,\r\nmore extensive lacerations are apt to occur, and the injury may not be\r\nlimited to the hymen, but may extend longitudinally along the vaginal\r\nwall, and even involve the posterior vaginal fornix. Or, again, without\r\nany such extensive laceration, there may result very profuse bleeding,\r\nin consequence of abnormally profuse vascularization of the hymen. Cases\r\nare also recorded in which (presumably not from normal coitus alone, but\r\nfrom other, unacknowledged manipulations), whilst the hymen has been\r\nleft intact, false passages have been made, leading to the formation of\r\nfistulæ, with subsequent death from haemorrhage or sepsis.\r\n\r\nApart from impotence in the male, the hymen may remain intact when it is\r\nnot touched at all during coitus. Inexperience, as _Veit_ remarks, will\r\nin this matter lead to results almost incredible. This author has been\r\ninformed by such inexperienced married couples, that in attempts at\r\nintercourse “the penis of the man is introduced between the thighs of\r\nthe woman, which are closely pressed together, the man having his legs\r\non either side. Naturally, in this method of intercourse, the hymen\r\nescapes destruction. In such attempts at coitus, things are done which\r\ncan hardly be compared with the normal act of copulation.”\r\n\r\nIn isolated instances, the introduction of the penis is prevented by\r\ncongenital or acquired defects in the formation of the external\r\ngenitals. Adhesion between the labia majora and the labia minora is\r\nsometimes met with a congenital deformity, which may or may not be\r\nassociated with atresia of the urethral orifice; in some cases the\r\nadhesion is dependent merely upon a superficial epithelial continuity,\r\nbut in others the labia are firmly adherent throughout. Less rare are\r\nacquired adhesions, the result of accident, between the labia majora and\r\nthe labia minora, leading to atresia of the vulva, and thus making\r\ncopulation impossible.\r\n\r\nIntromission of the penis may be rendered quite impossible by excessive\r\nsize of the labia majora, consequent upon elephantiasis, in which\r\ndisease there is enormous hypertrophy of the subcutaneous connective\r\ntissue. New growths may have the same result, fibroids, for instance,\r\nlipomata, and cysts, which may attain a remarkable size in the cellular\r\ntissue of the labia, the mons veneris, and the perineum, and also in the\r\nnymphæ and in the cellular tissue between the clitoris and the urethral\r\norifice. In a very obese woman twenty-eight years of age I saw a lipoma\r\nattached to the right labium majus. In the course of six years it had\r\ngrown to such an enormous size, that it extended downwards over the\r\nthigh, blocked the entrance to the vagina, and made coitus absolutely\r\nimpossible (Fig. 67). Various forms of labial hernia are also competent\r\nto occlude the vaginal orifice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 67.—Lipoma of the right labium majus, occluding the vaginal\r\n    inlet.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHypertrophy of the nymphæ, which, as the so-called _Hottentot Apron_ has\r\nto be regarded as a racial peculiarity, is known also in Europe as a\r\npathological condition which may at times constitute a hindrance to\r\nsexual intercourse (Fig. 68). According to _Otto_ there are three\r\nfundamental forms of the Hottentot apron, viz., excessive enlargement of\r\nthe nymphæ, overgrowth of the labia majora, and, lastly, the formation\r\nof a peculiar lobe of flesh and skin, attached to the mons veneris by a\r\npedicle, containing the clitoris, and covering the genital fissure as\r\nwith a valve. Hypertrophy of the nymphæ is said to be common also in\r\nTurkish and in Persian women. Owing to the obstacle to intercourse\r\npresented by hypertrophied nymphæ, it is among certain races an\r\nestablished custom to amputate clitoris and nymphæ together. _Virey_\r\nwrites: “The Portuguese Jesuit missionaries to Abyssinia in the\r\nsixteenth century, endeavoured to abolish this practice of the\r\ncircumcision of women, which they regarded as a relic of Mohammedanism;\r\nthe uncircumcised maidens, however, could find no husbands, owing to the\r\ninconvenient length of their nymphæ. The pope sent surgeons to the\r\ncountry, to enquire into the matter, and their reports were in such\r\nsense that circumcision was permitted as necessary.” Davis reports\r\nobservations made by Sonini on the female indigens of lower Egypt, in\r\nwhom the vulva hangs down in the form of a loose, flabby mass of flesh,\r\nof striking length and thickness, completely covering the genital\r\nfissure. He believes that the circumcision that was practised on the\r\nwomen of ancient Egypt consisted in the removal of this hypertrophied\r\nvulva.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 68.—“Hottentot apron” in an adult woman, hanging down between the\r\n    thighs. (After Zweifel.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Courty_ saw a case in which the remarkable length of the labia minora,\r\nwhich when an attempt was made to introduce the penis, covered the\r\nvaginal orifice, had rendered coitus ineffective, and had caused\r\nsterility for five years. Resection of the labia minora was followed by\r\nsuccessful intercourse and conception.\r\n\r\nThe lipomatous form, especially, of elephantiasis vulvae often attains a\r\ngigantic size. Growths of this nature, of the size of a child’s head,\r\nweighing six or seven kilo (thirteen to fifteen pounds), and reaching\r\ndown to below the knee, are by no means rare. I have known several cases\r\nin which an excessive accumulation of fat in the vulva associated with\r\npendulous belly has constituted a mechanical obstacle to the completion\r\nof sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 69.—Elephantiasis of the labia majora\r\n]\r\n\r\nHypertrophy of the clitoris may constitute an obstacle to coitus. In\r\nexceptional cases, this organ is as large as the male penis, and hangs\r\ndown over the genital fissure like a valve. _Hyrtl_ relates that in\r\ncertain African races, this congenital enlargement of the clitoris is so\r\nenormous, that the organ, made fast to the perineum with rings, serves\r\nfor the protection of virginity. _Schönfeld_ describes the case of a\r\nwoman aged twenty-eight years, in whom the vaginal orifice was almost\r\ncompletely occluded by a dry and firm growth, with a granulated surface.\r\nClose observation proved this growth to be produced by a hypertrophied\r\nand degenerated clitoris, which had attained the size of a child’s head.\r\nElephantiasis of the clitoris is especially inconvenient in consequence\r\nof the hindrance which the enlarged organ offers to sexual intercourse.\r\n_Bainbridge_ describes a case of tumour of the clitoris measuring 8 cm.\r\n(3.2 in.) in length and 5 cm. (2 in.) in width. The following remarkable\r\ncase is recorded by _Oesterlen_: A young man wished to break off his\r\nengagement on the ground that his intended wife was a hermaphrodite.\r\nExamination, however, disclosed the existence of a strong intact hymen,\r\na very large clitoris, and pregnancy of the twentieth week.\r\n\r\nInjuries of the vagina resulting from coitus are, generally speaking,\r\nrare. The usual cause of such injuries is disproportion in size between\r\nthe erect penis and the calibre of the vagina, or else brutal violence\r\nin the performance of coitus; sometimes, however, it is dependent on the\r\npathological state of the female genital organs, which have undergone\r\nsenile atrophy.\r\n\r\nTo the first group belongs the case reported by _Albert_, in which a\r\ngirl of eleven years was found to have a laceration of the vagina\r\ncommunicating with the peritoneal cavity, the injury resulting from\r\ncoitus. To the second group belongs the case reported by _Böhm_, of\r\nlacerations of the vaginal mucous membrane resulting from forcible\r\ncoitus in elderly women. _E. Frank_ reports a case of injury due to\r\nviolent coitus in a woman in whom the vagina was already greatly\r\nstretched by retroflexion; and another case in which injury occurred\r\nduring intercourse in a woman with vagina duplex—in this case, not only\r\nwas the hymen of the right vagina torn, but also the septum between the\r\ntwo vaginae.\r\n\r\nBy no means extremely rare are injuries to the vagina in the act of\r\ndefloration, causing severe hemorrhage. _Martin_ records a fatal case of\r\nthis nature. _Maschka_ and _Hofmann_, the authorities on Forensic\r\nMedicine, deny that vaginal laceration is the result of simple coitus,\r\nand _Hofmann_ maintains that such serious injury can occur only from\r\ndigital manipulations; in fact, these writers believe that the penis\r\nalone cannot be employed with sufficient force to cause laceration.\r\n_Barthel_ and _Anderson_, however, saw vaginal lacerations in\r\nnulliparous women; and _Zeis_ records a case of vaginal laceration in a\r\nwoman twenty-five years of age, with whom, six weeks after parturition,\r\nher husband, then in a state of intoxication, had had intercourse in the\r\nposition _à la vache_.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the vagina, absence, stricture, duplication, and abnormal\r\napertures, also diseases of the vaginal tissues, may induce incapacity\r\nfor sexual intercourse. In frequency as in significance, among these\r\ndisorders, absence of the vagina and stenosis and atresia of the canal,\r\nstand in the first rank. Congenital atresia may be complete or only\r\npartial, according as the two ducts of _Müller_ from the fusion of which\r\nthe tube is formed, remain totally or only partially solid—or, having\r\nduly canalized, subsequently, by a foetal inflammatory process, become\r\ntransformed into a thick, more or less solid cord. If the obliteration\r\nof the vagina is at the lower extremity of the canal, coitus is\r\nimpossible, unless, as sometimes happens, by frequent attempts at\r\nintercourse, the short blind sac representing the lower end of the\r\nvagina has been stretched upwards in the form of a pouch. When the\r\nobliteration of the ducts of _Müller_ is complete, we have total atresia\r\nof the vagina, in which case the uterus is also as a rule wanting, or is\r\nbut imperfectly represented. In some cases, from the ducts of _Müller_,\r\ninstead of the normal vagina, there is formed a tract of membrane of\r\nvarying density and width, through which passes a small canal for the\r\npassage of the menstrual discharge; this condition is known as atresia\r\nvaginalis membranacea.\r\n\r\nWhen, notwithstanding malformation of the external genital organs and\r\npartial absence of the vagina, there is no defect in the internal\r\ngenital organs, conceptions may sometimes be effected through some\r\nabnormal channel, as for instance through a communication established\r\nper anum; or, again, some operative procedure may bring relief. _Rossi_\r\nreports a case of congenital absence of the external genital organs, in\r\nwhich an incision was made in the region of the absent vagina, and an\r\nartificial vagina was thus constructed; copulation was in this way\r\nrendered possible, and conception ensued. In this connection, we may\r\nturn with interest to the essay by _Louis_, entitled _Deficiente Vagina,\r\nPossuntne per Rectum Concipere Mulieres?_ Here we are told of a case in\r\nwhich vulva and vagina were absent, and there was a monthly discharge of\r\nblood per anum; the woman’s lover employed this passage also _ad\r\nimmissionem penis_, and the woman became pregnant. Pope Benedict XIV\r\nexpressly allowed to women suffering from _imperforatio vaginae_ the\r\npractice of _coitus parte posteriori_.\r\n\r\nFurther, in cases of atresia vaginae in which the genital canal\r\nterminates in the urethra, conception can result from urethral coitus,\r\nas is proved by cases recorded by _K. von Braun_, _Weinbaum_, and\r\n_Wyder_. In _Weinbaum’s_ case, the obliteration of the vagina was\r\ncomplete, neither eye nor finger could detect the slightest aperture;\r\nthe woman having become pregnant after _coitus per urethram_, delivery\r\nwas effected by Caesarian section. In _Wyder’s_ case, the vaginal\r\norifice was closed, with the exception of a minute aperture, by means of\r\ndense fibrous tissue; the woman was in labour and the head of the child\r\nwas in the pelvis. Under anæsthesia, the septum, which was nearly an\r\ninch thick, was divided, the opening was enlarged, and the child was\r\nextracted by forceps. An investigation disclosed that the husband had\r\nalways had intercourse by introducing his penis into the dilated\r\nurethra; it was evident that the semen had passed through the urethra\r\ninto the bladder, and thence had found its way through a vesico-vaginal\r\nfistula into the vagina and uterus.\r\n\r\nAcquired obliteration and stricture of the vagina from the contraction\r\nof scar tissue, in consequence of deep ulceration, especially when\r\ncroupous or diphtheritic in nature, following typhus or typhoid,\r\npyaemia, puerperal sepsis, and the acute exanthemata (especially\r\nvariola)—may likewise serve as obstacles to coitus. Syphilitic\r\naffections also, through contraction of exudations, the adhesion of\r\nulcerated opposing surfaces, condylomata, etc., may give rise to\r\nstricture or obliteration of the vagina. The same conditions may be\r\ninduced by trauma, as by wounds, by attempts at rape, or by the use of\r\ncaustic acids and alkalis.\r\n\r\nThus, _Ahlfeld_ saw severe stricture of the vagina as a sequel of the\r\nexcision of four large condylomata. _Hennig_ the same, after variola,\r\nand again in lunatics who had introduced caustic fluids into the vagina.\r\nBy _L. Mayer_, atresia vaginae was seen as a sequel of typhoid; by\r\n_Weiss_ as a sequel of diphtheria; by _Martin_ from the action of\r\nirritant secretions in cases of uterine tumour; by _Billroth_ as a\r\nresult of continued irrigation of the vagina with alkaline urine after\r\nlithotomy or urethrotomy, and in cases of vesico-vaginal fistula.\r\nUlcerative processes set up by the long continued action of a vaginal\r\ntampon, a pessary, or some other foreign body, have been noted as\r\nleading to consecutive obliteration of the vagina.\r\n\r\nSuch stenosis, when partial only, may prevent complete coitus, and yet\r\nallow conception to occur. Cases illustrating this fact have been\r\nnumerously recorded. Thus, _van Swieten_ already reported the case of a\r\ngirl aged sixteen years, whose vagina was strictured to such an extent\r\nthat the passage would barely admit a crow-quill; nevertheless she\r\nbecame pregnant, and was successfully delivered. Similar cases are\r\nmentioned by _von Scanzoni_, _Kennedy_, _Devilliers_, _Varge_, _Moreau_,\r\nand _Plenk_.\r\n\r\nSerious obstacles to coitus, of a nature analogous to acquired stenosis\r\nof the vagina, are constituted by the irregular ligamentous bridges\r\nwhich sometimes arise in the vagina from the adhesion of a strip torn\r\nfrom the mucous membrane on one side of the vagina to the other side of\r\nthat tube—or, again, a portion of a lacerated cervix may adhere to the\r\nwall of the vagina. An interesting case of this nature came under my own\r\nobservation. It was a woman aged thirty-two years, who had twice had\r\ndifficult deliveries, the last time nine years before. Since then she\r\nhad been barren. On local examination I found in the vagina a fleshy\r\nbridge, about 4 cm. (1.6 in.) wide and 6 cm. (2.4 in.) long, extending\r\nfrom the left side of the portio vaginalis to the right wall of the\r\nvagina; this mass of tissue was so placed that the intromitted penis\r\nmust necessarily have slipped past it into a blind sac, such as the\r\nFrench name _une poche copulatrice_. Similar membranes in the vagina\r\nhave been described by _Breisky_, _Murphy_, and _Thomson_.\r\n\r\nVarious tumours may narrow or even completely close the vaginal passage,\r\nmyoma, sarcoma, carcinoma, and especially the polypoid form of\r\nfibromyoma, which may even project without the vaginal orifice. And even\r\nwhen tumours of or in the vagina do not actually hinder coitus by the\r\nspace they occupy, they may affect that operation by bleeding whenever\r\nit is undertaken, a manifestation extremely alarming to young married\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nThe vagina may also be partially occupied, and coitus may be impeded, by\r\nelongation of the hypertrophied cervix uteri, by inversion or prolapse\r\nof the uterus, by cystocele or rectocele, and by uterine polypi.\r\n_Horwitz_ records the case of a woman aged twenty-two years in whom\r\n_impotentia coeundi_ was dependent upon the occlusion of the vaginal\r\norifice by a rounded, strongly projecting body, which proved on closer\r\nexamination to be a hypertrophied vaginal bulb.\r\n\r\nTumours of the rectum and other intrapelvic growths may encroach upon\r\nthe vaginal passage and impede coitus. Closure of the vagina has been\r\nbrought about even by abnormal size and abnormal toughness of the\r\nperineum.\r\n\r\nFinally, in extreme degrees of pelvic contraction, the vagina may be so\r\nmuch narrowed as to interfere with coitus. _Von Hofmann_ records a case\r\nof this nature: In a woman thirty years of age, affected with\r\nkypho-scoliosis, who suffered extreme pain whenever her husband\r\nattempted sexual intercourse, the pelvis was twisted and narrowed to\r\nsuch an extent that the conjugate measured barely one inch, and the\r\nvagina was so small as barely to admit the finger.\r\n\r\nDuplication of the vagina will constitute an obstacle to coitus when\r\nboth halves of the passage are too narrow to allow of intromission of\r\nthe penis. Difficulty in intercourse will also be caused by abnormal\r\ntermination of the vagina, as by its termination in the rectum, likewise\r\nby severe perineal laceration which has converted the lower parts of the\r\nvagina and rectum into a cloaca, likewise by recto-vaginal and\r\nvesico-vaginal fistulæ; in the case of all these latter states a feeling\r\nof disgust is apt to be aroused in the male which may effectually check\r\nsexual desire. Still, coitus, and even conception, are quite possible in\r\nthese conditions. _Kroner_, among sixty cases of vaginal fistula,\r\nobserved six in which conception took place while the fistula was\r\nactually open.\r\n\r\nApart from all local pathological conditions, coitus may be interfered\r\nwith by general nervous disturbances, manifesting themselves locally,\r\nand depriving the woman so affected of potentia coeundi. First among\r\nsuch states must be mentioned vaginismus, a condition so important as to\r\ndemand discussion in a separate chapter.\r\n\r\nAn important and by no means rare obstacle to the completion of\r\nintercourse, affecting the male partner in the act, is partial or\r\ncomplete incapacity for erection of the penis. Even excessive smallness\r\nof the penis may render coitus inadequate; still more so, however,\r\norganic diseases of the membrum, such as obliteration of the corpora\r\ncavernosa, or of some of the trabecular channels of these bodies,\r\nnodular formations resulting from injury, or cavernitis from gonorrhoea.\r\nIn such cases, erection is extremely irregular, and the erect penis is\r\nsharply bent (chordee) instead of being straight, a condition which\r\nrenders intromission mechanically difficult if not impossible. A similar\r\neffect is produced by ossification of some part of the tunica albuginea\r\nof the corpora cavernosa—the so-called penis bone. Mechanical obstacles\r\nto coitus are also offered by inguinal and scrotal hernias; and by\r\nexcessive obesity, where the increase in thickness of the panniculus\r\nadiposus of the abdominal wall and the mons pubis, whilst the penis\r\nitself remains as slender as before, causes the organ almost to\r\ndisappear from view.\r\n\r\nPsychical impotence in the male is much more frequently observed than\r\norganic impotence. We meet with this condition especially in\r\nneurasthenically predisposed individuals, or in men who have been given\r\nto excessive venery or have masturbated excessively in youth, and who,\r\nwhen entering upon married life, fear they will be unable to satisfy the\r\nlegitimate desires of their wives; or in newly married men who have\r\nsuffered often from gonorrhoeal inflammations, such as prostatitis,\r\nvesical catarrh, and epididymitis. The fear and anxiety from which such\r\npersons suffer has an inhibitory influence upon the erection of the\r\npenis. In some instances, this inhibitory influence is partial only, and\r\nthe man thus affected, while perfectly competent in intercourse with a\r\nprostitute, who employs means of sexual stimulation to which he has\r\nbecome accustomed, is unable to complete intercourse with his wife, who\r\nis ignorant and innocent, and assumes a purely passive role; or it may\r\nbe that erection is not sufficiently powerful to bring about rupture of\r\nthe hymen, and thus to overcome the difficulties _primae noctis_.\r\n\r\nAs regards gonorrhoeal infection, it appears that in men who in other\r\nrespects are perfectly competent, this disease has an inhibitory\r\ninfluence upon the nervous mechanism concerned in producing erection of\r\nthe penis.\r\n\r\n_Psychical impotence_ is usually transitory, but it may endure for a\r\nvery long time; and it may be many months before the husband, whose\r\nnervousness has led to failure in the decisive moment at the outset of\r\nmarried life, is able to command an erection sufficiently powerful to\r\nbring about the defloration of his wife. Occasionally such psychical\r\nimpotence is not absolute but relative, it relates, that is to say, to\r\none particular woman—unfortunately, as a rule, a man’s own lawful\r\nwife,—whilst coitus with another woman, even in default of any measures\r\nfor artificial sexual stimulation, is easily effected. This fatal\r\nmisfortune is especially liable to occur in cases in which a man fully\r\nexperienced in sexual matters marries a woman whom he dislikes or for\r\nwhom he has no regard; the marriage being determined by material\r\nconsiderations. From such women I have heard the painful confession that\r\nthe husband, a man renowned for his gallantries, played a very poor part\r\nin the bridal bed.\r\n\r\nThe impotence of _irritable weakness_ is characterized by premature, and\r\ntherefore fruitless ejaculation. A man thus affected has a powerful\r\nerection of the penis, preparatory to coitus, but at the moment of\r\ncontact with the female genital organs, before there has been time for\r\npenetration to occur, ejaculation takes place, and is immediately\r\nfollowed by relaxation of the penis. Such irritative impotence is often\r\nmet with in young men at the outset of their sexual career, in\r\nbeginners, whose sexual passion is very readily excited, whose\r\nimagination shoots forward to the goal, and who are unable to restrain\r\nthemselves. This form of impotence can also be cured by wisely chosen\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nThe _paralytic_ form of impotence, on the other hand, is characterized\r\nby the entire absence of erections of the penis, both overnight in bed,\r\nand during the early morning hours; the penis always remains flaccid, or\r\nat most becomes semi-erect only, insufficiently rigid for penetration.\r\nEjaculation is much retarded or altogether wanting.\r\n\r\nImpotentia coeundi in the male may be _complete_, in cases in which the\r\nerection-apparatus is entirely inactive, and in which even an attempt at\r\nintercourse is out of the question; or, and this is more frequently met\r\nwith, it may be partial only, and manifests itself in various degrees of\r\nimperfection in the performance of coitus.\r\n\r\nThis latter form may often escape the woman’s notice. Whilst complete\r\nimpotentia coeundi, in which intromission of the penis is impossible, is\r\na state about which neither husband and wife can fail to be fully\r\ninformed, cases of partial impotence, with semi-erection of the penis or\r\npremature ejaculation, are often glozed over by the husband, ignored by\r\nthe wife, and underestimated by the physician—and yet such incomplete\r\nintercourse entails a series of ill-consequences alike upon the genital\r\norgans and upon the nervous system of the wife. Erection is incomplete,\r\nand thus the penis passes into the vestibule only, and not deep into the\r\nvagina; even if penetration is more thorough, the venous return of the\r\nblood from the corpora cavernosa is not checked sufficiently to distend\r\nthe penis to its full size, and to bring it into close contact with the\r\nvaginal walls; or ejaculation occurs prematurely, before the sexual\r\norganism of the wife has attained that supreme degree which is needful\r\nalike for the attainment of sexual gratification and for the occurrence\r\nof conception.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Vaginismus._\r\n\r\n_Vaginismus_ is a disordered state, characterized by hyperaesthesia of\r\nthe hymen and of the entrance to the vagina, so extreme that, even\r\nthough the organs may be entirely free from any anatomical abnormality,\r\ncoitus is prevented, whenever attempted, by violent, involuntary\r\nspasmodic contractions of the constrictor cunni and the other muscles of\r\nthe urogenital and anal region.\r\n\r\nThe centripetal paths of the reflex spasm characteristic of vaginismus,\r\nrun through the branches of the inferior hypogastric plexus, and\r\nespecially through the utero-vaginal plexus. The spinal nerves connected\r\nwith this part of the sympathetic are the 2d, 3d, and 4th sacral. The\r\nplexuses are constituted by fibres in part from sympathic and in part\r\nfrom the 2d, 3d, and 4th sacral nerves. Through the same nerves passes\r\nthe centripetal motor tract for the transversus perinei muscle, and for\r\nthe sphincter and levator ani muscles. According to _Eulenburg_, the\r\ncentre for this reflex is to be found at the level of the first sacral\r\nnerve; when the disturbance irradiates more widely, the lumbar and\r\nsacral plexuses as a whole are involved. The constrictor cunni\r\n(sphincter vaginæ or bulbocavernosus muscle) is supplied by the perineal\r\nbranch of the pudic nerve. The symptom-complex of vaginismus consists of\r\nviolent spastic contraction, for a term varying greatly in duration, of\r\nthe constrictor cunni (bulbocavernosus), sphincter ani, levator ani, and\r\ntransversus perinei muscles, the spasm spreading, in severe cases, to\r\nother muscles in the neighbourhood, and especially to the adductor\r\nmuscles of the thigh; the spasm comes on when any attempt at intercourse\r\nis made, and even when the genitals are merely touched.\r\n\r\nIn young married couples especially, vaginismus is an extremely\r\ndistressing condition, and one that entails very serious consequences,\r\ninasmuch as the pains and reflex spasms which result from any attempt at\r\ncoitus, and even from the mere approximation of the penis to the female\r\ngenital organs, render sexual intercourse absolutely impossible. The\r\ncause of this pathological manifestation is in part to be found in\r\nunskilful attempts at intercourse, which have stimulated the female\r\ngenital organs at some improper region. It may be that the young husband\r\nis not fully instructed in sexual matters, and does not really know how\r\ncoitus ought to be effected; in other cases there is some abnormality of\r\nthe hymen, which has rendered the rupture of that membrane extremely\r\ndifficult; in some cases there is partial impotence in the male, whose\r\npenis becomes semi-erect only, so that ever-renewed attempts at\r\nintercourse are followed by ever-renewed failure. Any of these causes\r\nmay suffice, in susceptible women, to originate vaginismus. The sufferer\r\nin these cases will usually be found on enquiry to be hereditarily\r\npredisposed to nervous disorder, and to be extremely sensitive to pain.\r\nBy the fruitless efforts of her ignorant or partially impotent husband,\r\nshe is sensually excited without ever being satisfied; the injured\r\nnervous system responds by these local spasms, whilst ultimately, in\r\nsome of these cases, an actual psychosis ensues.\r\n\r\nIn a certain number of cases, however, the husband is in no way\r\nresponsible for the origin of vaginismus, which may depend on\r\npathological states of the female external genitals, leading to\r\nhyperaesthesia; or, again, on primary hyperaesthesia of the pudic nerve\r\nand its branches; or, finally, on general neurasthenia and hysteria, on\r\nexcessive sensibility and lack of self-control on the part of a young\r\ngirl, who has entered upon married life under the dominion of\r\nextravagant ideas. Vaginismus dependent upon general neurasthenia\r\nespecially in cases in which there is no strong affection for the\r\nhusband to give the spur to desire, and to enable the woman to bear with\r\nfortitude the pangs which form the necessary introduction to the joys of\r\nwedded life. It must not be forgotten, as throwing light on the origin\r\nof vaginismus, that in the digital vaginal examination of a virgin or\r\neven of a young wife, unless extreme care is taken, pain and painful\r\nmuscular spasms are liable to be evoked.\r\n\r\nThe local pathological conditions of the female genital organs that are\r\nmost often met with in cases of vaginismus are: a very rigid state of\r\nthe hymen; inflammation and excoriation of the hymen and its\r\nsurroundings; fissures at the vaginal orifice; inflammatory affections\r\nof the vaginal follicles; inflammation of the carunculæ myrtiformes; a\r\npeculiar formation of the vulva, which extends forwards over the pubic\r\nsymphysis, whereby the urethral orifice and the hymeneal aperture come\r\nto lie upon the pubic symphysis or the subpubic ligament; vulvitis;\r\nherpes or eczema of the vulva; colpitis; urethritis; fissure of the\r\nanus; papillary growths; pruritus papules; urethral caruncle;\r\ninflammation of Bartholin’s glands; at times gonorrhoeal infection.\r\n\r\nA case came under my own observation in which a newly married woman\r\nsuffered from vaginismus. The husband believed the cause of the trouble\r\nwas his own partial impotence, consequent upon youthful venereal\r\nexcesses, and yielded to the desire of his wife and her relatives that a\r\ndivorce should be obtained. A year later, the woman remarried, when, to\r\nher horror, the symptoms returned in full force. Now for the first time\r\nshe consulted me, and on local examination I could detect no abnormality\r\nwhatever. The vaginismus was in this instance a pure neurosis, the only\r\npossible cause of which was to be found in bygone overstimulation of the\r\nvaginal orifice, the wife admitting previous onanistic excesses. In\r\nanother case known to me, vaginismus in the wife made the husband an\r\ninvoluntary sodomite. The movements of the wife when the spasm came on\r\nled to the introduction of the penis per anum, and coitus had repeatedly\r\nbeen effected by this abnormal route, when the fact first became\r\napparent as the result of a local examination.\r\n\r\n_Le Fort_ reports the case of a young Russian wedded pair who were\r\nspending their honeymoon in Paris. The husband took so much to heart his\r\ninability to fulfil his marital obligations in consequence of the\r\nvaginismus from which his wife suffered, that he shot himself through\r\nthe heart. The distressing situation of a husband whose wife suffers\r\nfrom vaginismus, rendering coitus impossible, is depicted in the\r\nwell-known French romance, “_Mademoiselle Giraud, Ma Femme_.” From a\r\nfalse shame, women often continue to suffer from vaginismus for months\r\nand even years, without a single effective coitus having ever taken\r\nplace; it is only the consequent sterility which at last leads to\r\nmedical advice being sought. The physician then usually ascertains that\r\nthe hymen is still intact, or at least incompletely destroyed, that on\r\nthis membrane and on various parts of the vulva there are erosions, and\r\nthat the whole of the external genitals outside the hymen are in a state\r\nof inflammation more or less acute. In other cases, however, neither\r\nexcoriations, erosions, nor inflammation can be detected, and the\r\nexistence of vaginismus can be proved only by the pain and the muscular\r\nspasm set up by contact with the vagina. Often, indeed, the cause of\r\nthis most distressing affection cannot be discovered.\r\n\r\nIntroduction of the penis may be rendered impossible by spasm of the\r\nconstrictor cunni (bulbocavernosus) muscle, but equally so by spasm of\r\nthe transversus perinei or the levator ani muscle. Sometimes the spasm\r\naffects all three muscular groups; in which case the narrowing of the\r\nvagina is extreme, and extends for some way up into the canal. When the\r\nlevator ani alone is affected by the spasm, the penis can, indeed, be\r\nintroduced into the vagina, to encounter a powerful obstacle in the\r\ninterior of that canal; and it may happen, when the spasm comes on and\r\naffects the levator ani only after complete intromission of the penis,\r\nthat the glans is retained in the vaginal fornix by the active\r\ncontraction of the pelvic floor.\r\n\r\nMore or less credible instances of _penis captivus_ thus brought about\r\nare on record. The following history is by _Davis_: A gentleman entering\r\nhis stable found therein his coachman and a servant-maid in a most\r\ncompromising position. All endeavours of the pair thus surprised to\r\nseparate proved ineffectual, and their attempts to draw apart caused\r\nthem intense pain. _Davis_ was sent for, and ordered an iced douche,\r\nwhich, however, failed to liberate the imprisoned penis. Release was\r\nimpossible until the woman had been placed under chloroform. The swollen\r\nand livid penis exhibited two strangulation-furrows, a proof that two\r\ndistinct areas of the levator ani muscle had been spasmodically\r\ncontracted.\r\n\r\n_Hildebrand_ records three cases observed by himself in which there was\r\nspasm of the upper part only of the vagina, unaccompanied by vaginismus\r\n(_i. e._, by pain). In two of these cases, the spasm was originated by\r\nthe contact of the examining finger with very painful ulcers of the\r\nportio vaginalis; the third patient had a very sensitive prolapsed\r\novary. _Fritsch_ reports having had on one occasion to give a woman\r\nchloroform for the release of a swollen and imprisoned penis.\r\n\r\n_Hildebrand_ suggests that vaginismus may be caused by an abnormal size\r\nof the penis, or by a condition occurring in weaklings and alcoholic\r\nsubjects, in whom the greatest swellings of the glans penis occurs\r\nbefore intromission, whilst this greatest swelling is normally deferred\r\nuntil towards the end of the act, when the glans is in the vaginal\r\nfornix.\r\n\r\n_Schröder_ writes as follows regarding the etiology of vaginismus: “The\r\naffection is dependent upon trauma, sustained in maladroit, frequently\r\nrepeated attempts at sexual intercourse; for this reason it is met with,\r\nin the great majority of cases in young, newly married women. Impotence\r\nin the male is by no means necessary for its production, and such\r\nimpotence is not even a frequent antecedent. Abnormal narrowness of the\r\nvagina, or extreme firmness of the hymen, is occasionally found, but\r\nneither is in any way necessary; all that can be said in this connection\r\nof a small vaginal orifice is, that it _predisposes_ to vaginismus. If\r\nthe husband is devoid of previous experience in sexual matters,\r\nmaladroit attempts at intercourse are exceedingly likely to occur. The\r\npenis is thrust in the wrong direction, pressing against either the\r\nanterior or the posterior commissure of the vulva. Very often, moreover,\r\nthe position of the vulva, which is subject to very striking individual\r\nvariations, is concerned in the production of vaginismus. There are many\r\nwomen in whom the vulva lies in part in front of the symphysis pubis, so\r\nthat the lower border of the symphysis lies below the urethral orifice.\r\nIn such cases the penis is directed too far backwards, and instead of\r\npassing into the vaginal orifice, slips into the fossa navicularis. The\r\nfrequent repetition of such maladroit attempts at intercourse gives rise\r\nto a gradually increasing sensitiveness of the parts concerned, with the\r\nformation of excoriations. It now results that, on the one hand, the\r\nwoman dreads attempts at intercourse on account of the pain to which\r\nthey give rise; she shrinks away from the man, so that penetration of\r\nthe vagina by the penis is rendered even more difficult than it was\r\nbefore; and, on the other hand, ungratified sexual desire leads to the\r\nfrequent repetition of attempts at complete intercourse (from which,\r\nmoreover, if conception should ensue, a cure of the trouble is\r\nexpected). In this way, the trauma is rendered more severe, the\r\ncongestion and excoriation of the fossa navicularis or of the urethral\r\nregion are aggravated, and the sensitiveness of the parts increases to\r\nsuch a degree that the woman thus affected screams out when the vulva is\r\nmerely touched. Ultimately reflex cramps set in whenever intercourse is\r\nattempted, and we then have the fully developed clinical picture of\r\nvaginismus.”\r\n\r\n_Winckel_ maintains that in most cases there are two principal elements\r\nin the causation of vaginismus. In the first place, in consequence of\r\nmore or less pronounced anatomical changes, there is undue sensitiveness\r\nand tenderness of the vaginal inlet and its neighbourhood, and in\r\nexceptional cases also of the upper part of the vagina, the uterus, and\r\nthe ovaries. In the second place, the patient manifests an increased\r\ngeneral sensitiveness and nervous irritability; this is in some cases\r\nprimary, but in others it is entirely the result of the repeated\r\nstimulation; and in either case it is heightened by the effects of\r\nungratified sexual desire.\r\n\r\n_A. Martin_ points out that the spasm of the muscles of the pelvic\r\nfloor, and especially of the levator ani muscle, upon which vaginismus\r\ndepends, may be due in some cases to the influence of chill, since the\r\nsame cause will lead to pathological contractions in other muscular\r\nareas. But in such cases it is always open to question if masturbation\r\nor some other sexual perversion is not the true cause of the disorder.\r\nIn some instances vaginismus is merely a symptom, in extremely sensitive\r\nwomen, of various diseases of the reproductive organs, and is brought on\r\nby the increased pain which in such cases is caused by attempts at\r\nintercourse; when produced in this way, vaginismus is usually a\r\ntransient manifestation.\r\n\r\n_Veit_ considers that among the pathological conditions giving rise to\r\nvaginismus, we must also enumerate diseases of the internal pelvic\r\norgans, such as chronic metritis, displacements of the uterus,\r\noöphoritis, etc.; but he also attaches great importance to nervous\r\npredisposition, consequent upon previous sexual stimulation, and upon\r\npre-existing inflammatory changes due to gonorrhœal infection. A\r\npeculiar form of vaginismus is, according to _Veit_, sometimes observed\r\nafter the birth of the first child; happily the duration of this is\r\nusually brief. After parturition the vulval mucous membrane remains for\r\na time very tender, and when cohabitation is resumed, often too soon,\r\nand perhaps, after the enforced abstinence, too frequently repeated at\r\nbrief intervals, fissures are readily produced. Moreover, vaginismus\r\nwhich has existed prior to parturition may, in some cases, recur after\r\nthat event. An unusual position of the vulva, undue smallness of the\r\nvaginal inlet, and relative impotence of the man, may combine to cause\r\nsuch a recurrence. Finally, vaginismus often persists throughout\r\npregnancy, and manifests itself during parturition. The magical effect\r\nwhich chloroform has in some primiparæ, when the head is delayed at the\r\nvulva, is explicable only by the supposition of vaginismus.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Arndt_, vaginismus is not purely a local disorder, but is\r\nin many cases the local manifestation of a neuropathic diathesis, which\r\nmay in some instances lead to general mental disorder.\r\n\r\n_Olshausen_ regards hyperæsthesia and vaginismus as different stages of\r\na single disease; he believes that the excessive sensitiveness is seated\r\nchiefly in the hymen; he explains the spasm as the reflex result of\r\nfissures and inflammatory changes. _Pozzi_ considers that excessive\r\nnervous irritability and an irritable state of the vulva are the\r\nindispensable preliminaries to the occurrence of vaginismus. _Herman_\r\ndistinguishes between excessive smallness of the vaginal inlet and\r\nvaginismus; he regards the latter as a nervous disorder, characterized\r\nby hyperæsthesia of the vulva, and by spasmodic contraction of the\r\nlevator ani and adjoining muscles. _Frost_ distinguishes vaginodynia\r\nfrom vaginismus; in vaginodynia the pain is so intense as to cause\r\nsyncope, and the muscular spasm involves the entire length of the\r\nvagina.\r\n\r\nIt is a notable fact, to which _Veit_ has especially drawn attention,\r\nthat among the poorer classes of the population, vaginismus is\r\npractically unknown. Among women of these classes, their sexual needs,\r\nnot having been so much lessened by “culture,” suffice to withdraw their\r\nattention even from the pains of defloration, which would otherwise\r\noften be very severe; whereas the sexually neurasthenic woman of the\r\nupper classes, filled with dread at the idea of the pain she expects to\r\nsuffer, and not infrequently in a condition of hyperexcitability or\r\nhypersensibility dependent upon previously employed abnormal means of\r\nsexual gratification, is unable to endure the pains of defloration even\r\nwhen these might be expected to prove far from severe.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, painful contractions of the vagina, to which we cannot\r\nproperly give the name of vaginismus, arise from organic diseases of the\r\nuterus and the uterine annexa; these painful contractions render\r\ncopulation impossible. _Von Hofmann_ reports the case of a young\r\nprostitute, who found herself unable to continue the practice of her\r\nprofession owing to the severe pain she suffered during intercourse; she\r\ndied, and the post mortem examination disclosed bilateral salpingitis,\r\nwith reproductive organs in other respects normal.\r\n\r\nMaladroit and incomplete attempts at intercourse, and the consequent\r\nrepeated failure to obtain complete sexual gratification, affect a\r\nwoman’s nervous system to a varying degree; but apart from this, in\r\nwomen who have long cohabited with men of deficient sexual potency, we\r\noften find a remarkable condition of complete relaxation of the genital\r\norgans, associated with great hypersecretion of the mucous membrane,\r\nflaccidity of the muscles of the pelvic floor, and displacements of the\r\nuterus. Moreover, the nervous shock to which the repeated but\r\nunsatisfying attempts at intercourse give rise, affects the spinal cord\r\nin such a manner that symptoms of spinal irritation ensue. The patient\r\ncomplains of pains in the back, the loins, and the nape of the neck;\r\nthese pains also radiate round the front of the abdomen and along the\r\nintercostal spaces; hyperæsthetic points may be detected when the finger\r\nis passed along the spine; there is weakness of the limbs with a\r\nsensation of numbness; and neuralgic manifestations of varying nature\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nThe dangers which sexual intercourse may entail upon women—over and\r\nabove the irritable conditions and inflammatory disorders of the female\r\nreproductive organs, dependent upon impetuous or unduly frequent coitus,\r\nor upon coitus practised during menstruation—are principally due to\r\ngonorrhœal and syphilitic infection transmitted by the cohabitating\r\nmale.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Cardiac Troubles Due to Sexual Intercourse._\r\n\r\nAmong the troubles from which women at times suffer as a result of\r\nsexual intercourse, certain cardiac disorders are especially worthy of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nEvery act of sexual intercourse in a young and sensitive woman exercises\r\nan exciting influence on the nervous mechanism controlling the cardiac\r\nmovements, and this influence is more clearly manifested in a degree\r\ndirectly proportional to the intensity of the sexual orgasm. The heart’s\r\naction is markedly increased in frequency, the cardiac impulse is more\r\npowerful, the large arteries of the neck are seen to pulsate far more\r\nvigorously, the conjunctiva is markedly injected, the respiration is\r\nincreased in frequency, the respiratory movements are more superficial\r\nand have a panting character.\r\n\r\nBut when, in a woman who is sexually irritable in an excessive degree,\r\nthe peripheral stimulation occurring in the act of sexual intercourse is\r\nunusually powerful, there may result a notable increase or modification\r\nof the reflex manifestations which normally occur during sexual\r\nintercourse in the province of cardiac activity; similar results ensue\r\nwhen there is a summation of stimuli owing to excessive sexual\r\nintercourse, or contrariwise when the act of intercourse is broken off\r\njust before its physiological climax and the natural termination of the\r\norgasm fails to occur.\r\n\r\nThe former cause is not infrequent in young wives during the period of\r\nthe honeymoon. The latter cause is in operation when there are diseases\r\nof the female reproductive organs preventing the physiological\r\ncompletion of intercourse; but especially in consequence of the modern\r\npractice of coitus interruptus, in which the man breaks off the act of\r\nintercourse the moment he feels that ejaculation is imminent, without\r\ntroubling himself regarding the natural course of sexual excitement in\r\nthe woman. Yet another cause of excessive cardiac reflex manifestations\r\nin women is incomplete potency of the male, which may either cause a\r\npremature ejaculation of semen, or may lead to incomplete penetration of\r\nthe penis.\r\n\r\nIn all such cases, as a result of sexual intercourse, there may arise\r\ncardiac disorders of various kinds; among these, tachycardial paroxysms\r\nare the most frequent, occurring either _inter actum_, or at a longer or\r\nshorter interval after intercourse.\r\n\r\nIn several cases of vaginismus occurring in young married women which\r\nhave come under my notice, it was observed that the attempts at\r\nintercourse gave rise to violent involuntary spasmodic contractions of\r\nthe constrictor cunni and the other muscles of the urogenital and anal\r\nregions, and in addition it was found that these attempts were followed\r\nby tachycardial paroxysms with dyspnœic manifestations, lasting for a\r\nconsiderable period, it might be as long as one or two hours.\r\n\r\nIn women who had practised coitus reservatus for a prolonged period, in\r\nfact for several years, in such a manner that, notwithstanding the\r\noccurrence of intense voluptuous excitement, complete sexual\r\ngratification rarely, if ever, occurred—in such women, in whom these\r\nmarital malpractices seemed to have profoundly influenced their\r\npsychical life, I have frequently witnessed a form of reflex cardiac\r\ndisorder which I must regard as a variety of the multiform neurasthenia\r\ncordis vasomotoria. In such women, still at the climax of their physical\r\npowers and of their sexual needs, attacks of palpitation suddenly occur\r\nat irregular intervals, several times daily or less frequently.\r\nAssociated with this increased frequency of the cardiac activity are an\r\nextremely distressing feeling of anxiety, a sensation of faintness,\r\nheadache, vertigo, a weakness of the muscular system, and at times\r\nactual attacks of syncope. Physically, the women are extremely\r\ndepressed, irritable, inclined to weep, unhappy, and weary of life. At\r\nthe same time, digestion is impaired, the appetite is small, and there\r\nis constipation. The pulse is in most cases feeble, small, of low\r\ntension, easily compressible, increased in frequency, often\r\nintermittent, sometimes more distinctly arhythmical. The heart is found\r\nto be sound on physical examination, nor can any abnormality be detected\r\nin the great vessels. The lower extremities are free from œdema; the\r\nurine does not contain albumen.\r\n\r\nWomen thus affected are sometimes believed to be suffering from cardiac\r\ndisorder, in other cases they are subjected to various modes of\r\ngynecological treatment; until at length the physician, by appropriate\r\nquestions, becomes enlightened regarding the true cause of the cardiac\r\ndisorder, namely, coitus interruptus. If it is possible to prohibit\r\neffectually this unwholesome practice, the cardiac symptoms soon cease\r\nto recur.\r\n\r\nFinally, in women at the climacteric age, cardiac troubles sometimes\r\nensue, which are dependent on interference with sexual intercourse in\r\nconsequence of anatomical changes in the vagina; changes of this\r\ncharacter frequently occur at the time of the menopause; owing to\r\nhyperaemic or inflammatory processes, a partial or general stricture of\r\nthe vaginal passage results; in many cases this passage becomes\r\nnarrower, shorter, and almost conical in shape, whilst the vaginal inlet\r\nis greatly diminished in size. Such a vaginal stricture, which _Hegar_\r\nhas also seen in younger women after an artificial climacteric\r\n(oöphorectomy), interferes with sexual intercourse; and the incomplete\r\nsexual gratification gives rise to a series of nervous manifestations,\r\nand, among others, to the above described reflex cardiac neurosis.\r\n\r\nWhether, and in which cases, the cardiac disorders evoked as a result of\r\nthe local stimulatory influences of sexual intercourse, are dependent on\r\na reflex stimulation of the sympathetic nerve on the one hand, or upon a\r\ntransient paresis of the inhibitory centre of the heart and of the\r\nvasomotor centre on the other, cannot here be fully discussed; just as\r\nlittle can we consider in what manner the psyche is sympathetically\r\naffected by the irritative processes in the genital organs, and its\r\nfunctional activity thus impaired.\r\n\r\nHere I can do no more than briefly state that experience has taught me\r\nthat sexual intercourse is competent to originate cardiac troubles in\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n1. In extremely sensitive, sexually very irritable women, tachycardial\r\nparoxysms may result from sexual excesses.\r\n\r\n2. Tachycardial paroxysms with dyspnœa occur in young women affected\r\nwith vaginismus; also in women at the climacteric with constrictive\r\nchanges in the vagina.\r\n\r\n3. Cardiac troubles, characterized mainly by symptoms indicating\r\ndiminished vascular tone, occur in women who have long practised coitus\r\ninterruptus with incomplete gratification of their voluptuous desires.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Dyspareunia._\r\n\r\nIn normal conditions the act of sexual intercourse is accompanied in\r\nwomen, as in men, by a voluptuous sensation, and this sensation must be\r\nregarded as a necessary link in the chain of those processes by which\r\ngratification of the sexual impulse—the most powerful of all our natural\r\nimpulses—is obtained. The absence of this voluptuous sensation in a\r\nwoman, the state in which she experiences during coitus no voluptuous\r\nsensations, but feels either apathy, or positive distaste, is termed\r\ndyspareunia: in former times it was also known as anaphrodisia. This\r\nabnormal state of sexual sensibility, which up to the present is hardly\r\nalluded to in gynecological textbooks, has received remarkably little\r\nattention from the medical standpoint, and its importance has been\r\nunderestimated. Most unfortunately so, for dyspareunia is an important\r\nsymptom, exercising a powerful influence on the general health of the\r\nwoman who suffers from it, upon her social status in marriage, and, as\r\nis easy to understand, upon her procreative capacity.\r\n\r\nDyspareunia must be clearly distinguished from two somewhat similar\r\nconditions, with which at first sight it is liable to be confused,\r\nnamely, from anæsthesia sexualis, and from vaginismus. By sexual\r\nanæsthesia we understand, as previously explained, the absence of the\r\nsexual impulse, a symptom which, when the reproductive organs are normal\r\nin structure and function, is either of central nervous origin, a result\r\nof disease of the brain or spinal cord, or else is due to general\r\nnutritive disorders such as diabetes, morphinism, or alcoholism. A woman\r\naffected with dyspareunia does, however, experience the sexual impulse,\r\nit may be very actively, but sexual intercourse brings about no\r\ngratification of her desires. In vaginismus, on the other hand, the\r\nintroduction of a foreign body, that is to say of the membrum virile,\r\ninto the vagina, gives rise to painful reflex cramps of the sphincter\r\nvaginæ, or of the muscles of the pelvic floor, whereby the completion of\r\ncoitus is rendered impossible: whereas in dyspareunia coitus can be\r\neffected, but gives rise to no voluptuous sensations.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure which normally occurs in woman during sexual intercourse is\r\nbrought about in this way, that contact with and friction by the penis\r\nstimulates the sensory nerves of the clitoris, the vulva, the vestibule,\r\nand the vagina; this stimulus is propagated to the cerebral cortex,\r\nwhere it gives rise to voluptuous sensations, and then, by reflex\r\nstimulation of the genito-spinal centre, gives rise to a series of\r\nreflex discharges. The pudic nerve, a branch of the sacral plexus,\r\nsupplies the female external genital organs. Some of its branches pass\r\nin the clitoris to a peculiar form of nervous end-organ discovered by\r\n_W. Krause_, Krause’s genital corpuscles: the structure of these\r\ncorpuscles appears to fit them exceptionally well for the transmission\r\nof stimulatory waves to the nerve centres. “When this stimulus,” says\r\n_Hensen_, in his work on the physiology of reproduction, “in addition to\r\nother effects, also gives rise to a voluptuous sensation, the cause must\r\nbe sought in central nervous connections and apparatus. Similar\r\nrelations are to be found in connection with the mechanism of nutrition,\r\nfor example, in the association of hunger, appetite, agreeable\r\nsensations of taste, the act of mastication, and the secretion of\r\nsaliva.” By means of this stimulus, several reflex processes are\r\noriginated in the reproductive canal, the most notable of which are the\r\nerection of the clitoris, and the ejaculation of the secretions of\r\nvarious glands. The cavernous tissue of the clitoris is connected with\r\nthat of the bulbus vestibuli, and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris is\r\none of the principal nerves of voluptuous sensation. The venous plexus\r\nconstituting the bulb of the vestibule lies at either side along the\r\nmargin of the vestibule at the boundary between the labium majus and the\r\nlabium minus, and laterally it is covered by the constrictor cunni[48]\r\nmuscle. During coitus the blood is driven out of this bulb into the\r\nglans clitoridis, and thus the sensibility and the erection of the glans\r\nare increased. The constrictor cunni and ischiocavernosus muscles draw\r\nthe clitoris, which is bent at a right angle downwards, into contact\r\nwith the penis. By means of the pressure of the constrictor cunni, the\r\nmucous secretion of Bartholin’s glands, which open into the vulva at the\r\nback of the labia majora, is expressed.\r\n\r\nAs additional reflex actions, dependent upon the activity of the reflex\r\ncentre in the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord, there ensue\r\ncontractions of the vagina, peristaltic movement of the tubes, some\r\ndescent of the uterus, relaxation of the os uteri and rounding of this\r\norifice, and induration of the portio vaginalis, whereby the tubal and\r\nuterine mucus and the secretion of the cervical glands are expressed.\r\nThis process of _ejaculation_ constitutes the culminating point of the\r\nvoluptuous sensation occurring in the sexual act; this act thus exhibits\r\ntwo phases, the sensation of friction, and the sensation of ejaculation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to voluptuous sensations, and processes analogous to\r\npollutions, occurring in women, we append an extract from _von\r\nKrafft-Ebing_.\r\n\r\n“The occurrence of voluptuous excitement during coitus is dependent in\r\nthe women, just as in the man, upon:\r\n\r\n“1. The peripheral influence of the intensity and duration of the\r\nsensory stimulation (anæsthesia of the genital passage may be the cause\r\nof the absence of voluptuous sensation). 2. The condition of\r\nexcitability of the reflex (ejaculation) centre in the lumbar spinal\r\ncord. The activity of this centre varies within wide limits, not merely\r\nin different individuals, but in the same individual at different times.\r\nThere are, indeed, women in whom it seems as if this centre were always\r\nin vigorous activity. In normal women, the irritability of the centre\r\nappears to be most marked at the menstrual epoch, and to decline rapidly\r\nsoon after menstruation. In pathological conditions, the activity of the\r\ncentre may be temporarily in abeyance (organic inhibitory processes,\r\nsuch as are seen in certain cases of hysteria with temporary frigidity);\r\nor again the centre may be abnormally active owing to irritable weakness\r\n(neurasthenia sexualis), in consequence of which ejaculation may, just\r\nas in the male in similar circumstances, occur too easily. 3. The\r\noccurrence of the voluptuous sensation in woman is unfavourably\r\ninfluenced by psychical inhibitory perceptions (analogous to the\r\ninhibitory influence of psychical processes in the male, such as, for\r\nexample, fear of incapacity to perform sexual intercourse). As examples\r\nof such inhibitory perceptions in women may be mentioned, dislike of the\r\nman, physical loathing to sexual intercourse, etc.”\r\n\r\n_Gutceit_ records interesting experiences, which are readily\r\nintelligible in view of what we have already quoted. He finds that of\r\nten women after defloration, two only immediately experience full sexual\r\npleasure. Of the eight others, four only have an agreeable sensation\r\nproduced by the friction during coitus: but the sensation of ejaculation\r\ndoes not make its appearance until the lapse of at least six months, or\r\nit may be even several years, after marriage. In the remaining four\r\nwomen, pleasure during sexual intercourse may never become properly\r\nestablished. The women of the first class are described by the author as\r\nbeing of a very ardent temperament, and passionately attached to their\r\nhusbands. In such women, the sensation of ejaculation occurs during\r\nintercourse with any man toward whom they are sympathetic. Women of the\r\nsecond class are of a less ardent temperament, and are often\r\ncomparatively indifferent toward the man with whom they cohabit. Women\r\nof the third class have little or no amatory feeling, and they either\r\nhate the man with whom they are cohabiting, or at least feel physical\r\nrepulsion to the idea of intercourse with him. _Gutceit_ considers that\r\nmeretrices usually belong to the third category. In the practice of\r\ntheir trade, they make a counterfeit of voluptuous enjoyment, and only\r\nexperience real sexual gratification in intercourse with the man of\r\ntheir choice.\r\n\r\nIt is of great practical interest, alike from the gynecological and from\r\nthe neuropathological standpoint, to determine the consequences in women\r\nof ungratifying sexual intercourse. In the present state of our\r\nexperience it must be assumed that the effect of abnormal sexual\r\nintercourse, that is of intercourse which does not culminate in\r\ngratification produced by the sensation of ejaculation, is deleterious.\r\nThis is explained by the fact that, owing to the absence of the muscular\r\ncontraction of the genital passage, the latter remains engorged with\r\nblood; the resultant hyperæmia passes away very slowly, and, when\r\nfrequently repeated, gives rise to chronic tissue changes, manifesting\r\nthemselves as diseases of the reproductive organs. Injury to the nervous\r\nsystem ensues, partly in consequence of these organic changes, partly\r\nalso in consequence of psychical non-gratification in the widest sense\r\nof the term. The nervous disorders thus produced are typical forms of\r\n(sexual) neurasthenia; and in cases in which the pathogenesis is\r\npredominantly psychical (antipathy to the husband, etc.) hysterical\r\ntypes of disorder are especially frequent. _Von Krafft-Ebing_ believes\r\nthat incomplete coitus, that is, coitus not culminating in the sensation\r\nof ejaculation, is a frequent cause of hysterical disorders in women.\r\n\r\nWhen once the clinical picture of neurasthenia sexualis is fully\r\ndeveloped, each act of intercourse (like pollutions or coitus in the\r\nsexually neurasthenic male) gives rise to renewed troubles, which are\r\neasily recognized as symptoms of venous stasis in the reproductive\r\norgans (sacrache, sensations of weight and bearing-down in the pelvis,\r\nfluor albus): in addition we observe exacerbations of the lumbar spinal\r\ndisorder, in the form of spinal irritation, irradiating pains in the\r\nsacral plexus, etc. In this way general neurasthenia develops. The\r\nconditions found in such cases on gynecological examination (chronic\r\nendometritis, metritis, oöphoritis, etc.) are produced by the same cause\r\nas the nervous symptoms, namely, by an unhygienic mode of sexual\r\nintercourse. They are not the cause of the neurosis, but important\r\nconcomitant disorders; and their effect in rendering the nervous\r\ndisturbances more severe must be freely admitted.\r\n\r\nAmong important causes of ungratifying coitus must be enumerated: weak\r\nerection and ejaculatio praecox in the male, rendering the stimulation\r\ninefficient; in addition, coitus reservatus, coitus interruptus, and\r\ncoitus condomatus. If the noxious influence is frequently repeated, the\r\noccurrence of neurasthenia sexualis and its consequences is greatly to\r\nbe feared, and in women of neuropathic constitution it is practically\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nUnsympathetic coitus appears to act, not merely in a somatic manner, but\r\nmainly upon the psyche, and to originate states of hystero-neurasthenia\r\nor pure hysteria. If the influence of such unhygienic conditions of the\r\nvita sexualis co-operates with that of inherited or acquired sensuality,\r\nfurther dangers ensue: in cases of ungratifying sexual intercourse, the\r\ndanger of manustupration; in cases of unsympathetic intercourse, the\r\ndanger of psychical onanism, or that of marital infidelity.\r\n\r\nAlthough until recently the matter received but little attention, it\r\nmust now be regarded as a well-established fact, that in the female (as\r\nin the male) the climax of voluptuous sensation in sexual intercourse is\r\nnormally characterized by a process of ejaculation, accompanied by a\r\nvoluptuous sensation of ejaculation, dependent upon the acme of\r\nexcitement of a reflex centre in the lumbar enlargement of the spinal\r\ncord.\r\n\r\nJust as in the male, this centre may be excited to action, not only by\r\nlocal stimulation of the genital organs, but also by (psychical) stimuli\r\nproceeding from the brain (pollutions), so also in the female a similar\r\nprocess may occur, and for this reason it is correct to speak of\r\n“pollutions in the female.” _Rosenthal_ appears to have been the first\r\nwriter to speak of pollutions in women. In his clinical study of nervous\r\ndiseases, _Rosenthal_ described processes of the nature of pollutions,\r\noriginated in erotically over-stimulated women by lascivious dreams. In\r\none case he detected the outflow of a “mucus-like” fluid from the\r\napparently intact genital organs; he believed this to proceed from the\r\nducts of Bartholin’s glands, and from the mucous glands surrounding the\r\nurethral orifice. _Féré_ reports the case of a patient who had an\r\nerogenic zone in the region of the upper part of the sternum; pressure\r\non this zone gave rise to a profuse secretion of vulvo-vaginal fluid. In\r\nthis connection we may also recall the “clitoris-crises” to which\r\ntabetic women are subject. _Gutceit_ described the process of pollution\r\nin women in the following words: “It is remarkable that in dreams such\r\nwomen experience the sensation of ejaculation.”\r\n\r\nThe psychical preliminary is invariably constituted by lascivious dream\r\nperceptions. It merely remains open to question whether this process,\r\nwhich in the male is indisputably physiological, in the female may be\r\nsaid to occur within physiological limits. The researches published by\r\n_von Krafft-Ebing_ more than twenty years ago, under the title\r\n“Concerning Processes Analogous to Pollutions Occurring in the Female,”\r\ngave negative results as far as healthy individuals were concerned; on\r\nthe other hand, the phenomenon in question was by no means rare in\r\nnervously disordered, and above all in sexually asthenic women. The\r\nneurosis was in part found as a result of psychical or manual onanism in\r\nvirgins with morbidly intensified libido: in part in married women, as a\r\nresult of ungratifying coitus, as previously described: in part, also,\r\nin married women with powerful libido and enforced abstinence from\r\nintercourse, owing to acquired impotence or death of the husband.\r\n\r\nJust as in the case of the neurasthenic male, these pollutions made the\r\nprimary neurosis more severe, and relief from the nervous trouble was\r\nnot obtained until the factor of the “pollutions” had been recognized,\r\nand made the object of special treatment. In exceptional cases the\r\n“pollutions” appeared to be the starting point of the entire neurosis.\r\n\r\nIt was further remarkable, again here displaying analogy with what\r\noccurs in the male, how much stronger and more deleterious was the\r\nshock-effect of an inadequate process of ejaculation occurring in a\r\nsexual dream, as compared with the far less deleterious influence of\r\nsimilar incomplete ejaculation when occurring _viâ coitus_. In very\r\nsevere degrees of neurasthenia sexualis, just as in the male, the waking\r\nimagination may give rise to a “pollution.” In such cases the\r\nshock-effect on the nerve centres tends to be excessively severe. A\r\nstill higher degree of irritability of the genital system appears to\r\nexist in cases in which excitement and orgasm of the reproductive organs\r\nmay culminate in a “pollution” by purely spinal paths, without the\r\nintervention of the imagination. The significance of this fact would\r\nappear to be considerable for the proper comprehension and for the\r\ntreatment of certain conditions of neurasthenia (sexualis) in the\r\nfemale. The “pollution” may here be the actual cause of the neurosis.\r\nBut in any case, in the female, the occurrence of pollutions is an\r\nextremely important symptom as regards both diagnosis and therapeutics.\r\nIt is extremely probable that hallucinations of coitus, and the\r\ncomplaints made by insane women of attempted violation during the night,\r\nare really dependent upon such “pollutions.”\r\n\r\n_Von Krafft-Ebing_ reports the following characteristic case. Miss X.,\r\nthirty years of age, belonging to a family predisposed to insanity, and\r\nherself neuropathic since early childhood, declared that since she was\r\nsix years old she had been subject to lascivious imaginations, to which\r\nshe became continually more liable as she grew older. Ultimately,\r\ntypical psychical onanism developed, and in recent years her trouble\r\nassumed the form of sexual neurasthenia. The patient herself suspected\r\nthere was a connection between her nervous disorder and her evil habit.\r\nThe popular work by _Bock_ finally brought her full enlightenment,\r\nassociated with severe emotional disturbance. This latter was now\r\nincreased by misfortunes from which the family suffered. The patient\r\nthen relinquished her bad habit, but her state of health nevertheless\r\nbecame worse. She was nervously extremely irritable; her sleep was\r\ninsufficient, unrefreshing, and disturbed by lascivious dreams; she\r\nsuffered from spinal irritation, anæmia, scanty and painful\r\nmenstruation. Inclination toward the opposite sex and toward marriage,\r\nhitherto but slight, now sank to a minimum: on the other hand, the\r\npatient, in spite of all efforts to the contrary became more and more\r\nsubject to a condition analogous to priapism in the male, a genital\r\norgasm by no means voluptuous in character, and often indeed actually\r\npainful. Associated therewith, nocturnal pollutions occurred, the\r\npatient awaking from lascivious dreams with a voluptuous sensation and\r\nmoistness of the external genital organs. After such pollutions,\r\nthroughout the ensuing day, she felt extremely weary and depressed and\r\nsuffered from severe spinal irritation. After a time, the nocturnal\r\npollutions occurred without being preceded by lascivious dreams, and\r\nultimately analogous states were experienced in the daytime. With much\r\ndifficulty the patient now made up her mind to seek medical advice. She\r\nwas anæmic, emaciated, emotional, and moody. The lumbar and cervical\r\nregions of the spine were extremely sensitive to pressure. Sleep was\r\nscanty and unrefreshing, the patient felt weary and miserable, she\r\ncomplained of dragging sensation and other paralgic sensations, in the\r\nregions supplied by the lumbar and sacral plexuses. The deep reflexes\r\nwere increased. She dreaded the onset of disease of the spinal cord, and\r\nbelieved that the cause of her illness was to be found in the prolonged\r\nindulgence in psychical onanism. The perusal of _Bock’s_ book had first\r\nmade her understand the true nature of her misconduct. She had never\r\npractised manual masturbation. Her principal complaint was of an almost\r\nunceasing uneasiness and excitement in the genital organs. She compared\r\nit to the uneasiness in the stomach produced by hunger. In the genital\r\norgans (which on examination appeared quite normal), she had a\r\ndistressing sense of burning heat, of pulsation, of disquiet as if there\r\nwere a clockwork mechanism working there. Very rarely now were these\r\nsensations associated with voluptuous ideas. This sexual neurosis had an\r\nintensely depressing constitutional effect. She had transient relief\r\nonly when the local sensations culminated in pollution; but this, on the\r\nother hand, increased her general neuropathic troubles. She suffered\r\nmost severely during the menstrual period. She was ordered sitz-baths at\r\na temperature of 23° to 19° R. (84° to 75° F.), suppositories of\r\nmonobromide of camphor, 0.6 (9 grains), with extr. belladon. 0.04 (⅗\r\ngr.), sodium bromide 3.0 to 4.0 (45 to 60 grains), every evening; also\r\npowders containing camphor 0.1 (1½ grains), lupulin 0.05 (¾ grain),\r\nextr. secal 0.08 (1¼ grains), twice daily. This treatment gave the\r\npatient great relief, and secured complete ease during the daytime.\r\nTherewith returned her greatly impaired trust in the future, and her\r\nemotional calm was restored.\r\n\r\nThe frequent occurrence of pollutions in women, the so-called\r\nvulvo-vaginal crises and clitoris-crises, is regarded by _Eulenburg_ as\r\na striking manifestation of sexual neurasthenia in woman; in such cases\r\na lascivious dream is spontaneously followed by a more or less abundant\r\ndischarge of the clear gelatino-mucous secretion of Bartholin’s glands.\r\nIn women who masturbate, and in tribadists, a profuse and even violent\r\nsecretion of these glands is produced by touching the clitoris or the\r\nerogenic zones at the entrance to the vagina, close to the orifices of\r\nBartholin’s ducts.\r\n\r\nDyspareunia, the absence of voluptuous sensation in women during coitus,\r\nmay be referred to three fundamental causes:\r\n\r\n1. Insufficient or completely wanting peripheral stimulation of the\r\nsensory nerve terminals in the female reproductive canal: in these cases\r\nthe conducting tracts to the nerve centres never become active.\r\n\r\n2. Diminution or cessation of the excitability of the reflex centre in\r\nthe lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord: this leads to failure of the\r\nsensation of ejaculation.\r\n\r\n3. Inhibitory influences proceeding from the cerebral cortex whereby\r\nvoluptuous sensations and perceptions are checked.\r\n\r\nThe first-named of these etiological influences is in my experience the\r\ncommonest. Incomplete or quite inadequate stimulation of the sensory\r\nnerves of the genital canal may be due to the maladroit performance of\r\ncopulation on the part of the male, owing to inexperience, or it may\r\ndepend on gross disproportion in size between the reproductive organs of\r\nthe man and the woman; in other cases it may be due to disease of the\r\nreproductive organs in either sex, influencing unfavourably the\r\nsensibility to stimulation of the nerves of the genital canal. Awkward\r\nor incomplete performance of coitus may thus lead to failure of\r\nvoluptuous sensation, and this may ultimately pass into permanent\r\ndyspareunia. Temporary dyspareunia is very common in young wives during\r\nthe first months of married life, ensuing on the pains of defloration;\r\nand very gradually gives place to normal voluptuous sensation. It may be\r\none or two years after marriage before the sensation of ejaculation is\r\nfirst experienced. Not infrequently, dyspareunia depends on incomplete\r\npotency in the husband, who is incompetent to arouse voluptuous\r\nsensation in his wife. For this reason, dyspareunia is common in young\r\nwomen married to elderly men; but is common also, where (as so\r\nfrequently among Russo-Polish Jews) the men also marry very young, at an\r\nage of from sixteen to seventeen years, and where, moreover, the husband\r\nhas often before marriage impaired his potency by masturbation: finally\r\ndyspareunia is common when girls still undeveloped sexually are married\r\nto powerfully built men.\r\n\r\nRegarding the pathological conditions of the female reproductive organs\r\nwhich counteract the peripheral sensory excitants of voluptuous\r\nsensation, we exclude from further consideration the obvious causes,\r\nabsence and atrophy of the reproductive organs, and senile marasmus. Of\r\nprime importance as a cause of the failure of sexual sensibility in the\r\nearly period of married life must be mentioned inflammation of the fossa\r\nnavicularis, due to awkward attempts at intercourse. Other causes of\r\ndeficient sensibility are: complete or partial persistence of the hymen,\r\nlesions of the vaginal inlet, acute or chronic vulvitis in consequence\r\nof irritating abundant secretion, especially as a sequel of gonorrhœal\r\nvaginitis. The last named infective disorder is especially harmful,\r\nbecause Bartholin’s glands are involved in the associated vulvitis. Even\r\nafter the cure of the vulvitis, permanent dyspareunia may remain.\r\nPerineal fissures may result in the stimulant effect of coitus being\r\ninsufficient, owing to the slight friction possible at the vaginal inlet\r\nin these cases. Not less serious sometimes are small, hardly discernible\r\nfissures in the vagina. Additional causes of deficient sexual\r\nsensibility are recto-vaginal, and vesico-vaginal fistulæ.\r\n\r\nThe second cause of dyspareunia, diminution or complete lack of\r\nirritability of the reflex centre of the lumbar enlargement of the\r\nspinal cord, appears to be less frequently operative. We must, however,\r\nassume that certain nervous disorders, such as hysteria and pathological\r\nchanges in the spinal cord, are responsible in this connection. The\r\nactivity of the lumbar sexual centre appears in women to be normally\r\nsubject to variation within certain limits; and seems usually to attain\r\nits maximum irritability during menstruation. But normally these\r\nvariations are never so great as to produce in women complete though\r\nmerely temporary dyspareunia; in this respect offering a marked contrast\r\nto what occurs in other animals at other times than the rutting season,\r\nand of which every bitch not on heat furnishes an example when she\r\nrefuses the sexual advances of the dog.\r\n\r\nAs regards the third causal influence in the production of dyspareunia,\r\nthe influence of the brain, this, though important, is less frequently\r\nin operation. Diseases of the brain, degenerative processes, may\r\nconstitute a cerebral cause for the failure of sexual sensation. But\r\nmore frequently, certain cortical perceptions, such as dislike or hatred\r\nof the cohabiting male, an ardent passion for some other lover, grief\r\nand trouble, exercise inhibitory influences, which render the occurrence\r\nof voluptuous pleasure during the sexual act difficult or quite\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nA condition like dyspareunia, our knowledge of which depends entirely\r\nupon the subjective sensations of the woman concerned, is naturally one\r\nregarding whose existence accurate information is difficult to obtain.\r\nVery rarely does it happen that women spontaneously approach the\r\nphysician with complaints of this condition; indeed, in my experience,\r\nthey do so only when they are sterile, and when they assume, in\r\naccordance with the widespread popular belief, that their sterility is\r\nconnected with the absence of voluptuous sensation during sexual\r\nintercourse. More commonly, however, it is the husband who feels it his\r\nduty to confide to the medical man the remarkable apathy of his wife in\r\nsexual intercourse. But when once the medical man’s attention has been\r\ndirected to this question, and when he institutes enquiries among his\r\npatients in a scientific, passionless manner, one making due allowance\r\nfor a woman’s modesty, as the moral importance of the subject demands,\r\nhe will be astonished at the frequency of dyspareunia, and he will find\r\nherein the explanation of many obscure phenomena in the life of women.\r\nOn the other hand, it must never be forgotten that a certain number of\r\nwomen complain of dyspareunia without any justification whatever, in\r\norder to arouse interest and sympathy, by representing themselves as\r\nunwilling sacrifices on the marital altar: the experienced gynecologist\r\nwill readily detect the cases in which he is being misinformed; he can,\r\nmoreover, always check the wife’s statements by conversation with the\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nThe constant sign of dyspareunia is the failure of ejaculation during\r\ncoitus. We have previously described the muscular contractions which\r\nlead to ejaculation of the secretion of Bartholin’s glands and to the\r\nexpulsion of the uterine and cervical mucus, as reflex actions evoked by\r\nthe sensory stimulus dependent on friction of the female genital organs.\r\nThe voluptuous sensation of ejaculation, associated with these muscular\r\ncontractions, which the woman whose sensibility is normal experiences as\r\nthe culminating point of her sexual “gratification,” is either quite\r\nunknown to a woman affected by dyspareunia, or is experienced by her\r\nonly in a voluptuous dream, as a pollution, in which the sexual\r\ndream-perceptions act as the psychical stimuli by which the reflex\r\ndischarge is originated. It has repeatedly happened to me, that on\r\nenquiring of women suffering from dyspareunia regarding their experience\r\nof the sensation of ejaculation, I have been informed that such\r\nsensations are known to them only from the descriptions of their female\r\nfriends, or occasionally from dreams from which they have awakened with\r\na feeling of moisture in the external genitals. _Von Krafft-Ebing_\r\nrefers this process to a peristaltic contraction of the muscular fibres\r\nof the Fallopian tubes and the uterus, “whereby the tubal and uterine\r\nmucus is expressed;” whereas, for my part, I am of opinion, that\r\nejaculation affects in the first place and principally the glands of\r\nBartholin, the secretion of which is expressed by the contraction of the\r\nconstrictor cunni muscles, and secondarily only affects the cervical\r\nglands of the uterus.\r\n\r\nAs a second sign of dyspareunia, I recognize a remarkably rapid outflow\r\nof the male semen from the female genital canal, immediately after\r\ncoitus (_profluvium seminis_). The woman thus affected complains, when\r\nsuitably questioned, that she is unable to retain the semen, and that it\r\nflows out of the vagina immediately after ejaculation. The cause of this\r\nremarkable phenomenon no doubt lies in the fact, that, owing to the\r\nabsence of the voluptuous sensation, the reflex contractions of the\r\nmuscles of the female genital organs, normally accompanying this\r\nsensation during intercourse, fail to occur. At the vaginal inlet, in\r\nnormal conditions, the constrictor cunni muscle contracts, and farther\r\nup in the vagina a peristaltic contraction of the circularly disposed\r\nmuscular fibres of the tunica media occurs: in this way the semen\r\nejaculated into the vagina is for a time retained under a certain\r\npressure. But in the absence of these muscular contractions, as well as\r\nof the muscular contraction of the pelvic floor, retention of the semen\r\nfails to occur. Cattle-breeders and horse-breeders have made similar\r\nobservations regarding cows and mares, namely, that these animals are\r\nsometimes unable to retain the semen after coitus, and it is suggested\r\nthat in these cases the animals are not properly on heat. Experienced\r\ncattle-breeders recommend in such cases that the retention of the semen\r\nshould be promoted by douching the root of the tail and the external\r\ngenitals with cold water. It is well known that by stimulating the\r\nperipheral sensory nerves in the neighbourhood of the genital organs, a\r\nreflex excitement of the lumbar sexual nerve centre is produced, as is\r\nseen, for example, in the practice of flagellation of the buttocks, for\r\nthe increase of sexual desire.\r\n\r\nPassing to the consideration of the pathological changes to be found in\r\nthe reproductive organs of women suffering from dyspareunia, the nature\r\nof these will for the most part be obvious in relation to the etiology\r\nof the disorder. Most frequent, in my experience, were chronic\r\ninflammatory states of the vulva and of the vaginal and uterine mucous\r\nmembrane, chronic metritis and parametritis. A very frequent appearance,\r\nand one practically characteristic of dyspareunia when of long standing,\r\nis a marked total relaxation of the reproductive apparatus. The uterus\r\nis extremely mobile, usually retroverted and partially prolapsed, thin,\r\nwith lax walls, and usually an enlarged cavity; the portio vaginalis is\r\nflaccid, and runs to a point; the vagina is roomy; there is marked\r\nhypersecretion of the mucous membrane of the entire genital canal; there\r\nis great flaccidity of the constrictor cunni and levator ani muscles,\r\nand of the perineum. In several women with dyspareunia, I found old\r\nunhealed lacerations of the perineum. In some cases, the very small size\r\nof the clitoris is noteworthy. In one case amenorrhœa was present with\r\nan infantile uterus. In a large proportion of the cases I was able to\r\ndetect a diminution both of the tactile and algic sensibility of the\r\nvaginal mucous membrane. The women were for the most part anæmic; many\r\nwere extremely obese, and of lymphatic constitution. In some cases,\r\nhowever, no pathological changes whatever could be detected in the\r\nreproductive apparatus.\r\n\r\nDyspareunia is a condition which affects a woman’s whole nature,\r\npowerfully influences her mental life, and thus gives rise to greater\r\npsychical than physical damage. The consciousness of being deprived of\r\nthe greatest joy of physical love produces great emotional depression,\r\neven in a woman by no means sensually inclined, and gives rise to a\r\nhypochondriacal state, at times even to melancholia. In other cases, the\r\nidea, not infrequently suggested by more happily situated women friends,\r\nthat the woman herself is not to blame for this condition, has a\r\ndemoralizing effect upon her, and destroys the happiness of married\r\nlife. (It has been confessed to me, in isolated cases, that the\r\ndyspareunia was relative only.) Apart from this, the absence of sexual\r\ngratification gives rise to a series of nervous troubles, presenting\r\neither the variable characters of hysteria, or else the symptoms of\r\nneurasthenia. Finally, the frequently repeated incomplete coitus,\r\nincomplete inasmuch as the woman does not experience the sensation of\r\nejaculation, induces chronic hyperæmia in the female reproductive\r\norgans, passing on into blood stasis, and ultimately into chronic\r\ninflammatory tissue changes; in this way arise metritis, perimetritis,\r\nand parametritis, salpingitis, oöphoritis, disorders of menstruation,\r\nmenorrhagia, and atypical uterine hæmorrhages. The possibility cannot be\r\ndisproved, that in this way new-growths of the reproductive organs may\r\nalso originate. The act of sexual intercourse, which at first may be to\r\nthe woman a matter of comparative indifference, and in which she plays\r\nher part merely from a sense of duty, becomes, in cases of long-standing\r\ndyspareunia, something to which she feels a positive dislike, and is\r\nrecognized by her as the actual cause of the troubles that ensue upon\r\nintercourse, such as sacrache, sensations of weight and pressure in the\r\npelvis, strangury, fluor albus, a feeling of exhaustion, etc.\r\n\r\nAt times, perverse sexual sensation is associated with dyspareunia.\r\nWomen who find no enjoyment in normal sexual intercourse with a male,\r\nsometimes masturbate, sometimes indulge in amor lesbicus, etc.\r\n\r\nOf great importance appears to me the relation between dyspareunia and\r\nsterility in women. As already pointed out, dyspareunia comes chiefly\r\nunder medical observation in cases in which it is associated with\r\nsterility. The husband, seeking advice concerning his wife’s failure to\r\nconceive, complains of her frigidity in sexual intercourse as the\r\nprobable cause; or the wife comes to seek advice, saying that she never\r\nexperiences sexual gratification, and that for this reason she has\r\nfailed to become pregnant. As a matter of actual fact, dyspareunia and\r\nsterility are associated with such remarkable frequency, that my own\r\nexperience leads me to believe in the existence of an etiological\r\nconnection between the two conditions, at least in a certain proportion\r\nof the cases. Among 69 sterile women whom I questioned regarding\r\ndyspareunia, the latter condition was present in 26, that is to say, in\r\n38% of the cases. _Matthews Duncan_ reported that of 191 sterile women,\r\n62 did not experience sexual enjoyment. Sexual excitement of the woman\r\nduring copulation would certainly appear to have a definite bearing upon\r\nthe occurrence of conception, for we know that by the voluptuous\r\nsensation reflex actions are aroused in the genital canal, favouring the\r\nretention of semen and its passage through the os to the interior of the\r\nuterus, and perhaps also giving rise to reflex changes in the cervical\r\nsecretion which favour the passage of the spermatozoa into the uterine\r\ncavity.\r\n\r\nIn cases of relative dyspareunia, the influence of this condition in\r\nproducing sterility is also manifested, the unfaithful wife being\r\nimpregnated by her lover though she has remained sterile in intercourse\r\nwith the husband to whom she is indifferent. To dyspareunia of this\r\nnature (dependent upon sexual disharmony), we may also refer the\r\nsterility of a married pair who have for some time lived together in\r\nunfruitful intercourse, whereas, after divorce and the contraction of\r\nfresh unions, both the man and the woman prove normally fertile. Such\r\ncases have been personally known to me; and similar instances aroused\r\nthe attention of the natural philosophers of antiquity, for instance,\r\nthat of Aristotle. The importance of voluptuous sensation in promoting\r\nconception is also manifest from the fact that in the majority of women,\r\nafter the pains of defloration, dyspareunia usually persists for a\r\nseason during the early period of married life; and, corresponding with\r\nthis, the first conception is usually deferred for some little time\r\nafter marriage, to a period corresponding with the awakening of the\r\nsensation of ejaculation. In this connection, _Courty_ reports the case\r\nof a lady who, although in blooming health, remained sterile during the\r\nfirst fifteen years of her married life; she then gave birth to a child\r\nwhose father was unquestionably her lover; and after this in succession\r\nto two other children whose progenitor was the legal husband. This lady\r\nhad never experienced voluptuous sensation in intercourse prior to the\r\ntime of her first conception. Similar circumstances with an even clearer\r\nsignificance have been frequently observed among the lower animals; and\r\n_Darwin_ records several striking observations of this character. Taking\r\nall the evidence into consideration, we are compelled to regard\r\ndyspareunia as a condition capable of causing sterility in women,\r\nalthough the sequence is not an absolutely necessary or invariable one.\r\n\r\nIn order to excite voluptuous sensation during intercourse, savage races\r\nmake use of various means, some of which we here transcribe from the\r\nwork of _Ploss-Bartels_. In Abyssinia, and on the Zanzibar coast, young\r\ngirls receive instruction in certain rotary muscular movements known by\r\nthe name of duk-duk, which they employ during coitus for the increase of\r\nsexual pleasure. Many Daiaks perforate the glans penis with a silver\r\nneedle from above downwards; this needle is kept in place like a seton,\r\nuntil a permanent canal is formed through the glans: in order during\r\ncoitus to stimulate the woman more powerfully, into this canal, just\r\nbefore coitus, various small articles are inserted, such as little rods\r\nof brass, ivory, silver, or bamboo, or silver instruments ending in\r\nsmall bundles of bristles; these project from the surface of the glans,\r\nand exercise a more powerful friction of the vagina, thus increasing the\r\nsexual pleasure of the woman. Men without such an apparatus are rejected\r\nby the women, whilst those who have made several such canals in the\r\nglans, and can therefore insert several instruments, are especially\r\nsought after and prized by the women. Such an apparatus is known as an\r\nampallang, and in a symbolic manner the woman indicates to a man of her\r\nchoice her desire that he should make use of one; he finds in his bowl\r\nof rice a rolled-up leaf, enclosing a cigarette which represents the\r\nsize of the desired ampallang. Among the Alfurs of North Celebes, in\r\norder to increase the voluptuous pleasure of the woman during\r\nintercourse, the men bind round the corona glandis the eyelids of a\r\ngoat, beset with the eyelashes, thus forming a bristly collar; in Java\r\nand in Sunda, before coitus, the men surround the penis with strips of\r\ngoat-skin, leaving the glans free. In China they wind round the corona\r\nglandis torn fragments of a bird’s wing; these also project like\r\nbristles and increase the friction. Among the Batta of Sumatra,\r\ntravelling medicine-men perform an operation by means of which they\r\ninsert, beneath the skin of the penis, small stones, sometimes to the\r\nnumber of ten, at times also angular fragments of gold or silver; these\r\nheal in beneath the skin, and increase the stimulus of coitus for the\r\nwomen. Among the Malays of Borneo the penis is perforated, and some fine\r\nbrass wire with the ends turned inwards is inserted: before coitus, the\r\nsharp ends of the wire are drawn out so as to project from the skin.\r\n\r\nIn our own part of the world, voluptuaries make use of an india-rubber\r\nring beset with spines, which before coitus is passed over the corona\r\nglandis, in order to promote sexual gratification in the woman during\r\nintercourse. In cases of diminished potency in the male, in order to\r\nproduce sufficient sexual excitement in the female by more powerful\r\nerection of the penis, various mechanical means are now employed. For\r\ninstance, in such a partially impotent man, a constricting band of\r\nindia-rubber may be passed over the root of the penis, whereby the\r\nreflux of blood from the corpora cavernosa is hindered, and a more\r\ncomplete and more enduring erection is induced. Elderly men have\r\nfrequently declared to me that they were well satisfied by the\r\nemployment of this simple measure, whilst behind their backs, their\r\nwives have assured me that the results were far from satisfactory. The\r\napparatus described by _Roubaud_ for the enlargement of the penis is no\r\nlonger employed. Partially impotent men make use, however, of an\r\ninstrument known by the name of “schlitten,” made of gold, silver, or\r\nwhite-metal; it consists of two delicate laminæ, united at the base by a\r\nmetal ring, and at the upper end by an india rubber ring. This small\r\napparatus, which must be made exactly to measure, renders possible the\r\nintroduction of the imperfectly erect penis into the vagina; it supports\r\nthe penis, and readily accommodates itself to the change in size of the\r\norgan as it slowly becomes erect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FERTILITY IN WOMEN.\r\n\r\nFertility in women is the basis of the fecundity of a nation, of its\r\ngrowth, its power, and its importance. It is especially the fertility of\r\nmarried women which enters here into consideration, and forms the source\r\nof the statistical data of fertility; these are usually obtained by\r\ndrawing a ratio between the number of marriages contracted in a given\r\nperiod, and the number of children born in the same period.\r\n\r\nThe fertility of women is a function beginning at an age varying in\r\ndependence on many conditions, and undergoing extinction at a definite\r\nperiod of life. It is, in fact, associated with the duration of the\r\nsexual life of woman, and, generally speaking, extends from the\r\nsixteenth to the fiftieth year of life. Climate, race, constitution, and\r\nmorbid conditions, influence alike the first appearance of menstruation\r\nand the first pregnancy; and as they influence the duration of menstrual\r\nactivity, so also do they influence the duration of fertility.\r\n\r\nIn the Bible are recorded numerous instances of the early commencement\r\nof fertility. At the present time also, in warm climates we meet with\r\nmany examples of early motherhood. From the great work of\r\n_Ploss-Bartels_, from which we have already frequently quoted, we\r\nextract and summarize the following ethnographical details. Among the\r\nwives of the Bosjesman, mothers aged ten are frequently seen; travellers\r\nin New Zealand often saw mothers of eleven years, and mothers of the\r\nsame age among the Samoyedes and in Palestine; mothers of twelve in\r\nBritish Guiana, in Jamaica, among the Schangallas, at Shiraz in Persia,\r\namong the Copts in Egypt; mothers aged thirteen in Cuba, among the Sioux\r\nand the Dakotas, and in New Caledonia; mothers aged fourteen among the\r\nNegroes of Gaboon.\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations of Robertson, of sixty-five Indian women\r\nthere gave birth for the first time:\r\n\r\n                       At the age of 10 years  1\r\n                       At the age of 11 years  4\r\n                       At the age of 12 years 11\r\n                       At the age of 13 years 11\r\n                       At the age of 14 years 18\r\n                       At the age of 15 years 12\r\n                       At the age of 16 years  7\r\n                       At the age of 17 years  1\r\n\r\nMoreover, in the records of European countries, we find numerous\r\ninstances of very early motherhood. _Molitor’s_ case, a girl nine years\r\nold giving birth to a vesicular mole with an embryo; _von Haller’s_\r\ncase, pregnancy in the ninth year of life; _Carus’_ case, pregnancy at\r\nthe age of eight. _Caspar_ saw a girl in Berlin who became pregnant at\r\nthe age of twelve, and was delivered of a living child. _Rüttel_ saw a\r\ngirl nine years of age pregnant. _King_ attended the confinement of a\r\ngirl who at the time of her delivery was not yet eleven years old.\r\n_Taylor_ reports the case of a girl twelve years and six months of age\r\nwho was then in the last month of pregnancy. _Koblanck_ attended a girl\r\nof fourteen who was delivered of a child weighing four and a half\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nIn most of these cases the premature fertility is followed by a\r\npremature cessation of fertility. And there is more or less truth in\r\n_Bruce’s_ statement regarding the Arab women in Africa, that those who\r\nbegan to bear children at the age of eleven were seldom still fertile at\r\nthe age of twenty.\r\n\r\nAt times we may observe a remarkable extension of fertility beyond the\r\naverage age, that is, beyond the age of fifty years.\r\n\r\nIn northern Europe pregnancy at a comparatively advanced age is by no\r\nmeans rare. From the official statistics of Denmark we learn that among\r\n10,000 women, 465 were delivered at ages between 50 and 55 years. In\r\nSweden, of 10,000 mothers, 300 gave birth to children when more than 50\r\nyears of age. In Ireland, the proportion of mothers over 50 was 345 per\r\n10,000. In England the official figures dealing with the delivery of\r\n483,613 women, showed that 7,022 were between 45 and 50 years of age,\r\nand 167 over 50 years of age.\r\n\r\nThe Surgical Academy of Paris, in an authoritative statement regarding\r\nthe late age at which conception could take place, alluded to the fact\r\nthat Cornelia, of the family of the Scipios, gave birth to Volusius\r\nSaturninus when sixty years of age, that the physician _Marsa_ in Venice\r\nrecorded the existence of pregnancy in a woman of sixty, that _de la\r\nMotte_ recorded pregnancy in a woman of fifty-one, and that he believed\r\nit to be true that another Parisian woman had given birth to a girl at\r\nthe age of sixty-three, and had herself suckled the infant.\r\n\r\nIn an important case, however, which came before the Court of Chancery\r\nin England, the court held that there was no definite evidence of the\r\npossibility of pregnancy in a woman sixty years of age; but that the\r\ngreatest age at which, in England, pregnancy had indisputably occurred,\r\nwas 54.\r\n\r\nAmong 4,925 deliveries occurring in the Prague Maternity Hospital,\r\nSchwing reports that there were 9 women delivered for the first time\r\nwhen over 40 years of age. Of these:\r\n\r\n                        3 were 41 years of age.\r\n                        2 were 42 years of age.\r\n                        1 was  43 years of age.\r\n                        2 were 44 years of age.\r\n                        1 was  47 years of age.\r\n\r\n_Haller_ reports the cases of two women who gave birth to children, one\r\nat the age of 63, the other at the age of 70 years. _Meissner_ delivered\r\na woman of 60 years of her seventh child; _Rush_ attended the delivery\r\nof a woman aged 60; _Dewees_ that of a woman aged 61. _Mende_ and\r\n_Bernstein_ report cases of delivery at the age of 60. _Marion Sims_\r\nsaw, in the state of Alabama, a negro woman 58 to 60 years of age, who\r\ngave birth to a child at this age, at an interval of twenty years since\r\nher last pregnancy. _Nieden_ reports a case in which the first pregnancy\r\noccurred 26 years after marriage. When married, the wife was 18 years of\r\nage, the husband 30; during their first twenty-five years of married\r\nlife there was no sign of pregnancy, but when the wife was 44 years of\r\nage, menstruation, hitherto regular, suddenly ceased; the cause of the\r\ncessation proved to be pregnancy, and at term a healthy girl weighing\r\nnine pounds was born; the mother was able to nurse the child herself.\r\n_Smith_ attended a woman aged 52 who was delivered of twins; the\r\nyoungest of her eight other children, who were then all living, was ten\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\n_Rodzewitsch_ collected from the Russian literature of the years 1872 to\r\n1881, eleven cases in which women aged 50 to 55 had given birth to\r\nchildren. _Talquist_ reports that in Finland, in the year 1883, a woman\r\n58 years of age was delivered; whilst _Ansell_ records the case of an\r\nEnglishwoman who became a mother when 59 years of age. _John Kennedy_\r\nrecords the case of a woman of 62 who was normally delivered at this\r\nage; she had begun to menstruate at the age of 13, and since the age of\r\n20 had previously given birth to 21 children, the last five when she was\r\n47, 49, 51, 53, and 56 years of age, respectively. _Prior_ even reports\r\nthe case of a woman 72 years of age, who not only menstruated, but had\r\nan abortion(!)\r\n\r\nThe ideal of fertility in women is that the first completed act of\r\nsexual intercourse should be followed immediately by conception, that\r\nthe pregnancy should terminate after the normal lapse of time in the\r\nbirth of a child, and that the same process should be repeated at\r\nintervals of about ten months until the end of active sexual life. In\r\nactual experience, however, this never occurs. Fertilization as an\r\nimmediate consequence of the first act of sexual intercourse (which in\r\nthe lower animals is regarded as the rule) is a very rare occurrence in\r\nhuman beings. Moreover, in no single marriage is the reproductive\r\ncapacity of the wife utilized to the full, up to the time of extinction\r\nof her generative faculty; either because the potency of the male\r\npartner undergoes a gradual decline, or, it may be, because, after a\r\nwhile, sexual intercourse becomes less frequent, or because precautions\r\nagainst procreation are taken.\r\n\r\nThe number of children to which during the three decades of her sexual\r\nlife, from the menarche to the menopause, a woman might theoretically\r\ngive birth, is never actually born. If we assume that, during the period\r\nof active sexual life, a woman requires a period of fifteen months to\r\ntwo years for each pregnancy, parturition, and lactation, a woman could\r\neasily during this period have fifteen or sixteen children, and this\r\nfigure would represent the normal product of the normal fertility of the\r\nhuman female. There are indeed, women who, it may be in consequence of\r\nan exceptionally long period of sexual activity, or through giving birth\r\nrepeatedly to twins or triplets, or because they have married several\r\nhusbands in succession, have given birth to twenty-four children or even\r\nmore. In Berlin, in the year 1901, there lived a woman 41 years of age\r\nwho had had 23 children; there were three women, aged respectively 40,\r\n43, and 46 years, who had had each 21 children; 246 women with families\r\nnumbering 13 to 20; and 169 women each of whom had given birth to 12\r\nchildren. In the very great majority of cases, however, the fertility of\r\nthe wife of the present day is never fully developed. It is modified in\r\nvarious ways by the conditions of marriage, by social circumstances, by\r\nconsiderations relating to the health of husband or wife, by actual\r\nillnesses, and by voluntary limitation of fertility. Generally speaking,\r\naccording to the investigations of _Quetelet_, _Sadler_, and\r\n_Finlayson_, the fertility of women is greatest in marriages in which\r\nthe husband is as old as the wife, or a little older, but without marked\r\ndifference in age. Marriages contracted at a very early age are less\r\nfruitful; the highest fertility is found in marriages contracted when\r\nthe husband is 23 and the wife 26 years of age.\r\n\r\nConception does not generally take place until sexual intercourse has\r\nbeen frequently repeated. As the result of a statistical enquiry of my\r\nown, relating to 556 fruitful marriages, I ascertained that in these the\r\nfirst delivery occurred:\r\n\r\n          Within 10 months after marriage in 156 cases.\r\n          Within 11 to 15 months after marriage in 199 cases.\r\n          Within 16 to 24 months after marriage in 115 cases.\r\n          Within 2 to 3 years after marriage in 60 cases.\r\n          More than 3 years after marriage in 26 cases.\r\n\r\nThus we learn that in 35.5% of the cases the first delivery occurred\r\nwithin 1¼ years after marriage; in 15.6% within 10 months; and in 19.9%\r\nwithin 15 months after marriage; and 11.5% of the cases, the first\r\ndelivery was more than 1¼ years and less than 2 years after marriage; in\r\n6.0% it was between 2 and 3 years after marriage; and in 2.6%, the first\r\ndelivery did not occur until more than 3 years after marriage.\r\n\r\nFrom examination of the birth registers of Edinburgh and Glasgow,\r\n_Matthews Duncan_ determined the mean interval between marriage and the\r\nbirth of a living child to be seventeen months. In the majority of\r\ncases, the first delivery does not occur until a complete year has\r\nelapsed since marriage; in fact, in nearly two-thirds of the instances\r\nthe first delivery occurs during the second year of married life.\r\n\r\nThe interval between two successive births is, according to _Matthews\r\nDuncan_, on the average 18 to 24 months, according to Goehlert, 24 to 26\r\nmonths; the latter, however, points out that in cases in which the child\r\ndies very soon after birth, the birth of the next child ensues on the\r\naverage in 16 to 18 months. In this connection, we must not fail to take\r\ninto consideration the influence of lactation, inasmuch as mothers who\r\ndo not suckle their children become pregnant considerably earlier, on\r\nthe average, than those who undertake this duty. In reigning families,\r\nfor instance, it is by no means uncommon for the consort to be delivered\r\ntwice within a single year. The degree to which lactation hinders\r\nconception is so widely known, that women often suckle their infant for\r\na very long period, with the definite aim of preventing the speedy\r\nrecurrence of pregnancy. A high official from the Dutch Indies informed\r\nme that for this reason the native women were accustomed to suckle their\r\ninfants for several years, and that it was by no means uncommon to see a\r\nsmall boy running about smoking a cigar, and then hurrying to his mother\r\nin order to be suckled.\r\n\r\nThe age at which a woman contracts marriage has also to this extent an\r\ninfluence upon her fertility, inasmuch as it appears that those who\r\nmarry very young are far less fertile than those who marry between the\r\nages of 20 and 25 years; the latter moreover have, on the average, a\r\nshorter time to wait for their first conception than women who marry\r\nbefore the age of 20. Women who marry after the age of 25 have to wait\r\nlonger after marriage for their first delivery; in fact the older the\r\nwoman after 25, the greater, on the average, the interval between\r\nmarriage and the first delivery.\r\n\r\nArranging the data already referred to, regarding 556 fruitful women, in\r\nrelation to this point of view, it appears that the first birth ensued:\r\n\r\n ═════════════════════╤═════════╤═════════╤═════════╤═════════╤═════════\r\n                      │         │         │15 months│         │\r\n                      │         │10 to 15 │  to 2   │ 2 to 3  │More than\r\n                      │Within 10│ months  │  years  │  years  │ 3 years\r\n                      │months of│  after  │  after  │  after  │  after\r\n                      │marriage.│marriage.│marriage.│marriage.│marriage.\r\n ─────────────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n In 163 women marrying│         │         │         │         │\r\n   at ages 15 to 20   │         │         │         │         │\r\n   years              │       36│       53│       46│       18│       10\r\n In 313 women marrying│         │         │         │         │\r\n   at ages 20 to 25   │         │         │         │         │\r\n   years              │       98│      113│       56│       32│       14\r\n In 70 women marrying │         │         │         │         │\r\n   at ages 25 to 33   │         │         │         │         │\r\n   years              │       18│       30│       12│        9│        1\r\n In 10 women marrying │         │         │         │         │\r\n   at ages over 33    │         │         │         │         │\r\n   years              │        4│        3│        1│        1│        1\r\n ═════════════════════╧═════════╧═════════╧═════════╧═════════╧═════════\r\n\r\nTo give percentages, the first birth occurred,\r\n\r\n ═════════════════════╤═════════╤═════════╤═════════╤═════════╤═════════\r\n                      │         │         │15 months│         │\r\n                      │         │10 to 15 │  to 2   │ 2 to 3  │More than\r\n                      │Within 10│ months  │  years  │  years  │ 3 years\r\n                      │months of│  after  │  after  │  after  │  after\r\n                      │marriage.│marriage.│marriage.│marriage.│marriage.\r\n ─────────────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Women marrying at    │         │         │         │         │\r\n   ages 15 to 20      │         │         │         │         │\r\n   years, in          │    22.0%│    32.5%│    28.2%│    11.0%│     8.1%\r\n Women marrying at    │         │         │         │         │\r\n   ages 20 to 25      │         │         │         │         │\r\n   years, in          │    31.3%│    36.1%│    17.8%│    10.2%│     4.4%\r\n Women marrying at    │         │         │         │         │\r\n   ages 25 to 33      │         │         │         │         │\r\n   years, in          │    25.7%│    42.8%│    17.1%│    12.8%│     1.4%\r\n Women marrying at    │         │         │         │         │\r\n   ages over 33 years,│         │         │         │         │\r\n   in                 │    40.0%│    30.0%│    10.0%│    10.0%│    10.0%\r\n ═════════════════════╧═════════╧═════════╧═════════╧═════════╧═════════\r\n\r\nThus whereas in women who contracted marriage between the ages of 15 and\r\n20 years, only 54.5% were confined for the first time within 15 months\r\nafter marriage, in women who contracted marriage between the ages of 20\r\nand 25 years, in 67.4% the first delivery occurred within 15 months of\r\nmarriage. And whereas in those who married at the earlier age, the\r\npercentage of first deliveries occurring between 15 months and 2 years\r\nafter marriage was 28.2, in those who married between the ages of 20 and\r\n25, the percentage of first deliveries after the stated interval was\r\nonly 17.8.\r\n\r\nThe figures compiled by _Whitehead_ and _Pfannkuch_ give similar\r\nresults. Of 700 women who married between the ages of 15 to 20 years,\r\nthere were 306 only who gave birth to a child within the first two years\r\nafter marriage; whereas of 1,835 women who married between the ages of\r\n20 and 25 years, no less than 1,661 gave birth to a child within two\r\nyears after marriage—a percentage of 43.7 in the former case, and 90.6\r\nin the latter case. _Pfannkuch_, as the result of a very large\r\ncollection of figures relating to this question, found that in women\r\nmarrying before the age of 20 years, the average number of months before\r\nthe first delivery was 26; whereas in women marrying after the age of 20\r\nyears, the average number of months before the first delivery was 20.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Matthews Duncan_\r\n\r\n ═══════════════════════════════════╤═══════════════════════════════════\r\n    OF EVERY 100 WOMEN WHO MARRY    │       THERE BECOME MOTHERS\r\n ───────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┬─────────────────\r\n                  „                 │ In the 1st year │In the 2d year of\r\n                                    │of married life. │  married life.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n Between the ages of 15 and 20 years│            13.71│            43.70\r\n Between the ages of 20 and 25 years│            18.48│            90.51\r\n Between the ages of 25 and 30 years│            12.41│            75.80\r\n Between the ages of 30 and 35 years│            11.44│            62.93\r\n Between the ages of 35 and 40 years│             9.27│            40.97\r\n ═══════════════════════════════════╧═════════════════╧═════════════════\r\n\r\n_Sadler_ examined the relationship between the age at which marriage was\r\ncontracted and the number of offspring in the case of the wives of\r\nEnglish peers.

What a marked influence the age at marriage has upon fertility\r\nis shown by the comparison of the figures relating to married women with\r\nthose relating to unmarried women; the fertility of unmarried mothers\r\nattains its maximum at the ages of 20 to 25 years. In the countries\r\nunder consideration the average age of women at the time of marriage is\r\n25 to 27 years.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a still clearer picture of the fertility of women in\r\nrelation to age, _Goehlert_ has combined the figures relating to the\r\nmarried and the unmarried, and then calculated the percentages, with the\r\nfollowing results:\r\n\r\n ════════════════════════════════════════════╤══════════════════════════\r\n                    AGES.                    │  MARRIED AND UNMARRIED\r\n                                             │          WOMEN.\r\n ────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────┬────────┬────────\r\n                      „                      │Denmark.│Sweden. │Norway.\r\n ────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────┼────────┼────────\r\n Under 20 years.                             │     1.7│     1.6│     1.1\r\n From 20 to 25 years.                        │    16.6│    15.1│    14.1\r\n From 25 to 30 year                          │    26.6│    25.0│    25.3\r\n From 30 to 35 years.                        │    25.3│    25.1│    24.4\r\n From 35 to 40 years.                        │    19.6│    20.4│    20.0\r\n From 40 to 45 years.                        │     9.2│    11.2│    12.2\r\n ────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────┼────────┼────────\r\n From 45 to 50 years.                        │   } 1.0│     1.6│     2.9\r\n Over 50 years.                              │   „    │   „    │   „\r\n ────────────────────────────────────────────┴────────┴────────┴────────\r\n\r\nIf, finally, we combine into a single table the figures relating to all\r\nthree of these countries, we obtain the following results:\r\n\r\n                       Under 20 years       1.5%\r\n                       From 20 to 25 years 15.3%\r\n                       From 25 to 30 years 25.6%\r\n                       From 30 to 35 years 24.9%\r\n                       From 35 to 40 years 20.0%\r\n                       From 40 to 45 years 10.9%\r\n                       Over 45 years        1.8%\r\n\r\nFrom these figures it appears that the maximum fertility of married\r\nwomen is attained, in Denmark at the age of 31, in Norway at the age of\r\n31.7, and in Sweden at the age of 32 years. In the case of unmarried\r\nwomen, the maximum fertility is at the ages of 24 to 26 years. In the\r\nAustrian Empire, the maximum fertility of women is attained at about the\r\nage of 30 years; in England it is attained between the ages of 20 and 25\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nDivergent results as regards the fertility of married women at different\r\nages were obtained by _Goehlert_ from the examination of 5,290 cases\r\nfrom the reigning families of Europe. In the favourable position as\r\nregards means of subsistence occupied by the members of these families,\r\nmarriage naturally occurs, in most cases, much earlier in life, the mean\r\nage at marriage being between 19 and 22 years—the youngest mother (in\r\nthe Capet dynasty) was only 13 years of age—and for this reason the\r\nfigures relating to the younger age-classes are larger than in the\r\nprevious tables. But as a result of this, the reproductive capacity also\r\nundergoes an earlier extinction, so that of these women, not one gave\r\nbirth to a child when she was over 50 years of age. _Goehlert_ gives the\r\nfollowing table, compiled from these 5,290 instances:\r\n\r\n                       Under 20 years       8.8%\r\n                       From 20 to 25 years 25.4%\r\n                       From 25 to 30 years 29.4%\r\n                       From 30 to 35 years 21.6%\r\n                       From 35 to 40 years 11.5%\r\n                       Over 40 years        3.3%\r\n\r\nIn these cases the maximum fertility was obtained at the age of 27.\r\n\r\nThe physiological fertility of women is much more clearly manifested\r\nwhen we compare the fertility of women who have been married a few years\r\nonly, with the fertility of women in the later years of married life. In\r\nthe earlier period, the effective fertility more nearly approaches the\r\nphysiological fertility, because at this time the various influences by\r\nmeans of which fertility is later so greatly diminished have not yet\r\ncome into operation. In this connection the following data, published by\r\n_Körösi_, regarding the percentage fertility of recently married women,\r\nand that of married women in general, will be found of interest:\r\n\r\n ═══════════════════════╤═══════════════════════╤═══════════════════════\r\n                        │Recently-married women.│  All married women.\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n At ages 20 to 35 years.│                  32.9%│                  20.6%\r\n At ages 35 to 40 years.│                  32.7%│                  14.7%\r\n At ages 40 to 45 years.│                  21.4%│                   5.9%\r\n ═══════════════════════╧═══════════════════════╧═══════════════════════\r\n\r\nInasmuch as we learn from this table that in the case of women aged 40\r\nand upward, the newly married exhibit a fertility of four times as great\r\nas that of married women in general, in whom pregnancy has already\r\nbecome rare, we can infer the influence upon fertility of abstinence and\r\nof artificial measures for the prevention of conception.\r\n\r\nOn the average, the maximum fertility of woman, that is, the maximum\r\nof effective fertility, is attained at the age of 18 to 20 years.\r\nExtreme youthfulness, and also the opposite condition, too advanced an\r\nage, when marriage is entered on, impair a woman’s fertility; whereas\r\nthe conditions most favourable to fertility are that, at the time of\r\nmarriage, the uterus should have attained its fullest development, and\r\nthe ovaries also should be completely mature; this is not usually the\r\ncase at puberty, but rather at the age of 20, 21, or 22 years. In\r\nAustria-Hungary, of 100 marriages in which the wife’s age at marriage\r\nwas less than 18 years, the average offspring in the course of a\r\nsingle year were 36 to 38 children; in the case of 100 marriages in\r\nwhich the wife’s age at marriage was 18 to 20 years, the average\r\noffspring in a year were 40; this being the maximum fertility, the\r\nnumber of offspring in a year per hundred marriages (i. e., the\r\npercentage fertility), now undergoes a regular decline as the wife’s\r\nage at marriage increases; at an age of 25, the percentage fertility\r\nis 32; at the age of 30 years, the fertility is 24%; at the age of 35,\r\n17%; at the age of 40 years barely 10%; at the age of 45, 7%; at ages\r\n45 to 50, 0.1%. Thus, from the last figure, we see that of a thousand\r\nwomen marrying at the age of 50 years, one only gives birth to a\r\nchild. Men obtain their maximum fertility (i. e., procreative\r\ncapacity) at the age of 25 or 26 years; at this age their fertility\r\namounts to 35% (that is, of 100 marriages at this age, 35 children\r\nwill on the average be born within a single year); at the age of 35\r\nyears, the percentage fertility of men falls to 23; at the age of 45\r\nyears, it is 9½%; at 55, 2.2%; at 65, ½% (_Körösi-Blaschko_).\r\n\r\nWhereas hitherto we have considered only the monogenous fertility of\r\nmarried women, we must remember that the figures relating to their\r\nbiogenous fertility are also of interest—that is to say, the changes\r\nwhich a woman’s fertility experiences in married life in respect of the\r\npeculiarities of her husband; and of these peculiarities, the easiest to\r\nmake the object of statistical investigation is the husband’s age. The\r\nage of the husband exercises an important influence upon the fertility\r\nof the wife, as is proved by the following figures published by\r\n_Körösi_:\r\n\r\n ════════════════════════════╤════════════════════════════════════════════\r\n      AGE OF THE FATHER.     │             AGE OF THE MOTHER.\r\n ────────────────────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────\r\n              „              │  25 years.   │  30 years.   │  35 years.\r\n ────────────────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n 25 to 30 years              │         35.6%│         25.0%│         21.2%\r\n 30 to 35 years              │         31.2%│         23.6%│         19.9%\r\n 35 to 40 years              │         27.5%│         21.8%│         19.4%\r\n 40 to 45 years              │              │         16.7%│         14.0%\r\n 45 to 50 years              │              │         14.4%│         10.9%\r\n 50 to 55 years              │              │              │         10.9%\r\n ════════════════════════════╧══════════════╧══════════════╧══════════════\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\n ══════════════╤═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\r\n   AGE OF THE  │                    AGE OF THE FATHER.\r\n    MOTHER.    │\r\n ──────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────\r\n       „       │  25 years.   │  35 years.   │  45 years.   │  55 years.\r\n ──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────\r\n Under 20 years│         49.1%│              │              │\r\n 20 to 25 years│         43.0%│         31.3%│         16.0%│\r\n 25 to 30 years│         30.8%│         27.3%│         18.5%│\r\n 30 to 35 years│         33.5%│         23.7%│         14.4%│          8.1%\r\n 35 to 40 years│              │         18.9%│         11.8%│          6.7%\r\n 40 to 45 years│              │          6.6%│          6.1%│          3.0%\r\n ══════════════╧══════════════╧══════════════╧══════════════╧══════════════\r\n\r\nWe learn from these figures that the maximum fertility is exhibited by a\r\nwoman 18 years of age, when married to a man 25 years of age; less\r\nfertile is a woman 25 to 30 years of age married to a man 28 years of\r\nage; still less fertile is a woman 35 years of age married to a man 29\r\nyears of age. Neither the age of the mother alone, nor that of the\r\nfather alone, is determinative of the fertility of the marriage, for the\r\nfertility of young wives married to elderly husbands is quite different\r\nfrom that of young wives married to young husbands. Very various\r\nage-combinations are possible, and each exhibits an average fertility\r\npeculiar to itself.\r\n\r\nWe can also regard the question from the standpoint of the _difference_\r\nbetween the ages of husband and wife respectively. In this connection,\r\n_Körösi_ is led by his tables to the conclusion that wives between the\r\nages of 18 and 20 years attain their maximum fertility when married to\r\nmen 7 years older than themselves; women of 25 years when married to men\r\n3 years older than themselves; women of 29 years when married to men of\r\nthe same age; women of 30 years and upward attain their maximum\r\nfertility only when married to men younger than themselves. Men, on the\r\ncontrary, always attain their maximum fertility when married to women\r\nyounger than themselves. The age of maximum fertility differs in the two\r\nsexes, and those marriages will be most fruitful in which husband and\r\nwife are each of the age most favorable to fertility. This will be the\r\ncase when the age of the wife is 18 to 20 years, and that of the husband\r\n24 to 26 or perhaps 29 years.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the question of fertility, we have also to take into\r\nconsideration the vitality of the children born, that is, what\r\nproportion of those born survive. According to _Körösi’s_ interesting\r\npapers regarding the fertility of the inhabitants of Buda-Pesth, we\r\nlearn that for every 100 marriages which have persisted for thirty years\r\nand upward, there were born, on the average, 539 children, of whom\r\nduring this period 241 died, so that the percentage of survivals was\r\n55.28. Parents who have lost one only of several children must,\r\ntherefore, regard themselves as exceptionally favoured by fortune.\r\n\r\nSocial position, occupation, and religion, have, according to the\r\nlast-quoted author, a notable influence on fertility. His investigations\r\nshowed that the Roman Catholics and the Jews exhibited the greatest\r\nfertility; among the Catholics there were 541 children, and among the\r\nJews 557 children, per 100 marriages. Amongst 100 Protestant families,\r\non the other hand, only 479 children had been born. It will be seen that\r\nthe theory of the comparatively enormous fertility of the Jewish race is\r\nnot supported by these statistics. The Jews do, however, exhibit a\r\ngreater power of rearing children, for among them the marriages of more\r\nthan 30 years’ duration had 61⅔\t% of the children still living; among\r\nthe Protestants 57¾% survived; and among the Catholics only 52–⅗%. It\r\nthus appears that the surviving offspring per 100 marriages of 30 years’\r\nduration were, among the Catholics 278, among the Protestants 252, and\r\namong the Jews 349.\r\n\r\nThe question whether, and to what extent, the age of the parents has an\r\ninfluence on the vitality of the children, is answered by _Körösi’s_\r\nmortality statistics in the sense that mothers below 20 years of age\r\ngive birth to a larger proportion of children deficient in vital power.\r\nWhere the mothers had married at the age of 16, the mortality of their\r\noffspring was, among Catholics 43%, among Jews 33%; married at 17,\r\nCatholic mortality 44%, Jewish 30%; married at 18, Catholic mortality\r\n42%, Jewish 32%; married at 19, Catholic mortality 41%, Jewish 29%;\r\nmarried at 20, Catholic mortality 40%, Jewish 26%. Of the children whose\r\nfathers had married at the age of 24, 32% had died; of those whose\r\nfathers had married at 23, 37% had died; of those whose fathers had\r\nmarried at 20, 42% had died; and of those whose fathers had married\r\nbefore 20, actually 44% had died. It thus appears that the children\r\nalike of very young mothers and of very young fathers have a lessened\r\nchance of survival.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the fertility of the wife is a product of two factors, her\r\nown peculiar fertility, and that of the procreating male, the question\r\nof the fertility of women cannot be accurately treated independently of\r\nthis second consideration; hereby, however, is introduced a multiplicity\r\nof obscure combinations, by which the value of all the statistical data\r\nof fertility in women is seriously impaired.\r\n\r\nThese data give as the measure of fertility, the number of children per\r\nmarriage actually brought up, embracing fruitful marriages, sterile\r\nmarriages, and those not yet fruitful. In Berlin, in Copenhagen, and in\r\nBuda-Pesth, the average thus attained was slightly less than three\r\nbirths to each family, whilst the number of children actually living\r\naveraged two per family. A more accurate representation of fertility is\r\nobtained by ascertaining the number of children born, and the number of\r\nchildren living in relation to the duration of marriages reckoned in\r\nyears, that is beginning with marriages of one year’s duration, and\r\nproceeding year by year to the highest recorded duration of marriage. In\r\nthis way interesting statistics have been obtained; for example, one who\r\nhas completed thirty years of married life may count on the average that\r\nfive or six children will have been born to him, but may also reckon on\r\nhaving buried two or three at least of these. (_Körösi._)\r\n\r\nFertility is, as many facts indicate, also dependent on nutrition. A\r\ndistinct proof, says _Spencer_, writing on the “Coincidence between high\r\nNutrition and Genesis,” that abundant nutriment increases the number of\r\nbirths, and vice versa, is found among the mammalia; compare, for\r\ninstance, the litter of the dog with that of the wolf and the fox.\r\nWhilst the dog’s litter numbers 6 to 14, that of the wolf numbers 5 to\r\n7, that of the fox 4 to 6. The wild cat gives birth to 4 or 5 kittens\r\nonce a year, the domesticated cat to 5 or 6, twice or thrice annually.\r\nThe most remarkable contrast, in this respect, exists between the wild\r\nand the domesticated breeds of swine. The wild sow gives birth once a\r\nyear to a litter of 4, 8, or 10 pigs (the number increasing in\r\nsuccessive litters); the domesticated sow has often as many as 17 in a\r\nsingle litter, whilst in two years five litters, each numbering 10 pigs,\r\nare commonly born.\r\n\r\n_Darwin_ also draws attention to the fact that animals under\r\ndomestication, being fed more abundantly and regularly than their wild\r\nallies, procreate at shorter intervals and are markedly more fertile\r\nthan the latter. He states that the wild rabbit has four litters\r\nannually, each numbering 4 to 8 young; whereas the tame rabbit\r\nreproduces its kind six to seven times annually, and gives birth to\r\nlitters numbering 4 to 11. Among birds, analogous phenomena are\r\nobserved. The wild duck, for instance, lays 5 to 10 eggs in the course\r\nof the year, whereas the tame duck lays from 80 to 100; the wild grey\r\ngoose lays 5 to 8 eggs, the domesticated goose 13 to 18.\r\n\r\nIt must be added that this exceptional fertility is manifested in\r\nanimals that are quite inactive in comparison with their wild allies;\r\nnot only are they richly fed, but they get their food without working\r\nfor it. Moreover, it is easy to observe that among the domesticated\r\nmammals the well-fed are more fertile than the ill-fed.\r\n\r\nThat in the human species also, fertility is influenced to a notable\r\ndegree by nutritive conditions, is shown by statistical investigation.\r\nAfter years distinguished by an exceptionally good harvest the number of\r\nchildren born is considerably greater than in normal conditions; whereas\r\nafter a famine the opposite is observed. _Malthus’s_ law of population\r\nstates, _inter alia_, that the population increases when the amount of\r\navailable nutriment increases, that is, that favourable nutritive\r\nconditions cause an increase, that unfavourable nutritive conditions\r\ncause a decrease, of population. Hardships and exhausting occupations\r\ndiminish the fertility of women. The remarkable fertility of the Kaffirs\r\nis referred to the fact that this people, possessing large herds of\r\ncattle, lead a life comparatively free from care; it is no less true\r\nthat the Boer women, who lead a life of well-fed leisure, have very\r\nlarge families; whereas the Hottentot women, poor, ill-nourished, and\r\nhard working, seldom bear more than three children.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, it may be said that fertility of the soil, in\r\nconnection with an easily gained livelihood, favours also human\r\nfertility, notwithstanding the fact that certain statistical data seem\r\nto conflict with this proposition. _Sadler_, for instance, concludes\r\nthat an increase in the price of the necessaries of life does not _per\r\nse_ check fertility, but, indeed, rather increases it; he considers that\r\nthe apparent decline in fertility is due to the fact that the number of\r\nmarriages diminishes, owing to the rise in prices. We must, however,\r\npoint out, that an increase in price of the necessaries of life is often\r\nassociated with a rise in wages, and is therefore not necessarily\r\nidentified with deficient nutrition; when, however, such a rise in\r\nprices leads to actual want, a limitation of fertility will certainly\r\nresult; this has been proved by _Legoyt_ and _Villermé_ with regard to\r\nfailure of the crops. Famine and disease lower the number of births; a\r\nless severe deficiency of nutriment often lowers only the quality of\r\nthose born. _Malthus_ was of opinion that the population of a country at\r\nany time was related to the quantity of nutriment produced or imported\r\ntherein, on the one hand, and, on the other, to the liberality with\r\nwhich this nutriment was distributed to the individual. In countries\r\nwhere corn forms the principal crop, we find a thicker population than\r\nin pasture lands; and where rice is the principal crop, the population\r\nis even more abundant than it is in corn growing countries.\r\n\r\nPassing to the consideration of the individual nutritive elements, we\r\nfind that these also influence fertility. Above all, it has been proved\r\nthat alcohol notably diminishes the fertility of women. _Lippich_ states\r\nthat of 100 women in Kärnten and Krain suffering from chronic\r\nalcoholism, 28.3 were barren. In England, where the abuse of alcoholic\r\nbeverages is also very frequently observed in women, the same phenomenon\r\nhas been noted. _Matthews Duncan_ held that alcohol exercised a specific\r\ndeleterious influence on fertility. Moreover, in addition to the\r\nconstitutional disturbances produced by the abuse of alcohol, this\r\nbeverage also exercises a well-known pathogenetic influence upon the\r\nfemale reproductive organs; with especial frequency, chronic oöphoritis\r\nmay be shown to depend on this exciting cause.\r\n\r\nA diet consisting mainly of fish is known to increase the sexual\r\nimpulse, and is said also to increase fertility. Further, a diet\r\nconsisting mainly of potatoes or rice is said to favour reproduction;\r\ncompare, for instance, the fertility of the Hindoos, who abstain\r\nentirely from animal food, and of the Chinese, who live chiefly on rice.\r\n_Davy_ maintained that the women of races living chiefly on fish were\r\nhandsomer and more fertile than others: and _Montesquieu_ suggested that\r\nthere was an association between the abundant population of sea-ports\r\nand also of Japan and China, and the large quantity of fish consumed in\r\nthose places. On the other hand, a diet consisting chiefly of meat is\r\nsaid to have an unfavourable influence in this direction; in support of\r\nthis view it is pointed out that races living by the chase, and living\r\ntherefore almost entirely on meat, have very small families. This\r\ngeneralization is invalidated by the fact that Englishwomen, who eat far\r\nmore meat than the women of the Latin races, are nevertheless\r\ndistinguished by their great fertility.\r\n\r\nIn his “History of Civilisation in England” _Buckle_ writes: “The\r\npopulation of a country, although influenced by many other conditions,\r\nunquestionably rises and falls in proportion as the supply of nutriment\r\nis abundant or the reverse.” _Herbert Spencer_ also states that “every\r\nincrement in the supply of nutriment is followed by an increment in\r\nfertility.”\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that, in addition to the more or less abundant\r\nsupply of nutriment, there are always other influences affecting\r\nfertility; the general mode of life, race, climatic conditions, etc.,\r\nmay, in various ways, co-operate with or countervail the influence of\r\nnutritive conditions. If, with the best possible supply of nutriment,\r\nthere is associated a luxurious and enervating mode of life, the abuse\r\nof alcohol, severe intellectual exertion, or sexual excesses, the\r\ngeneral result will be a diminution in fertility. And it is easy to\r\nunderstand why _Cros_, although perhaps with little justification, goes\r\nso far as to regard easy circumstances as an active cause of\r\ndepopulation. “It is the poor,” he writes, “and the less wealthy\r\ndepartments of France, in which we find the most children.” In\r\nestimating fertility, however, we must never fail to take into\r\nconsideration the more extensive employment of means for the prevention\r\nof pregnancy among the upper classes of society.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent we can trace the influence of climate and of season\r\nupon fertility. Heat appears to favour fertility; _Haycraft’s_ figures\r\nfor the eight largest towns of Scotland show clearly how the number of\r\nconceptions rises and falls _pari passu_ with the temperature. Lower\r\nanimals also, when brought from a colder to a warmer neighbourhood,\r\nexhibit an earlier and more frequently recurring “heat.” In Europe,\r\nhowever, the Northern races appear more fertile than those of the south.\r\n\r\nOf the seasons, spring is the one especially favourable to fertility.\r\n_Quetelet_, who proves by numerous statistical data that the maximum of\r\nconceptions occurs in May, attributes this fact to a general increase in\r\nthe vital forces occurring in spring, after the cold of winter.\r\n_Villermé_, however, goes back to the older explanation, that the\r\nincrease in the number of conceptions in May and June is due to social\r\nand economic conditions. The return of spring, especially the end of\r\nspring and the beginning of summer, a time of year in which the means of\r\nsubsistence are provided in exceptional quantity, and of especially good\r\nquality, the season also of festivals and social reunion, when the two\r\nsexes are brought into more intimate contact and when the majority of\r\nmarriages occur—these are the conditions associated with the season of\r\ngreatest fertility. The figures of _Wappaeus_ also confirm the influence\r\nof spring in favouring fertility. He found, however, that there were two\r\nseasons of maximal fertility. The first at the end of spring and the\r\nbeginning of summer; the second in winter, especially in December.\r\nMid-winter is for most people a period of domestic amusement and\r\nrelaxation, one of exceptionally good nutrition, and of social reunion;\r\nthe spring increase in fertility is a part of the awakening and increase\r\nof the reproductive forces of nature at large, which recurs every\r\nspring-time.\r\n\r\nEvery marked and sudden change in the mode of life has an unfavourable\r\ninfluence on fertility. _Darwin_ reports that mares who have for some\r\ntime been stall-fed with dry fodder and are then put out to grass are at\r\nfirst infertile after the change. Europeans going to reside in the\r\ntropics experience a notable decline in fertility as a result of the\r\nchange of climate. According to _Virchow_, the fertility of European\r\nwomen who become acclimatized in the tropics declines very gradually,\r\nbut in the course of a few generations is almost completely annulled.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of near kin is believed also to diminish fertility. As\r\nregards inbreeding in the lower animals, it is well known that when\r\nnearly related animals copulate, the number of the offspring is below\r\nthe average. _Nathusius_ paired a sow with its own uncle, the boar\r\nhaving proved productive in intercourse with other sows; the litter\r\nnumbered five to six only. This sow, which belonged to the great\r\nYorkshire race, was then paired with a small black boar, which in\r\nintercourse with sows of its own variety had procreated litters\r\nnumbering six or seven; as a result of her first pairing with the black\r\nboar, the sow cast a litter numbering twenty-one whilst the second\r\nattempt produced a litter of eighteen. Similar results were obtained by\r\n_Crampe_, in his experiments in the inbreeding of rats.\r\n\r\nSome authorities declare that the results of inbreeding are similar in\r\nthe human species, that the marriages of near kin are less fruitful than\r\nthe average. _Darwin_ writes in this connection: “With regard to human\r\nbeings, the question whether breeding in-and-in is also deleterious,\r\nwill probably never receive a direct answer, for man reproduces his kind\r\nso very slowly, and cannot be made the object of experiment. The very\r\ngeneral disinclination of nearly all races to the marriage of near kin,\r\nwhich has existed from the very earliest times, is of weight in relation\r\nto this question. Indeed we appear almost justified in applying to the\r\nhuman race the experience gained by experiment on the higher mammals.”\r\n\r\n_Darwin’s_ assumption regarding the effect upon fertility of the\r\nmarriage of near kin in the human species, cannot, however, be accepted\r\nwithout qualification. In ancient times there was no uniformity of\r\nopinion on this topic. It is well known that among the Phœnicians, a son\r\nmight marry his mother, and a father his daughter; and among the ancient\r\nArabs it was the legal duty of the son to marry his widowed mother.\r\nMoses, on the contrary, forbade marriages between parents and children,\r\nbetween brothers and sisters, also marriage with a father’s sister, with\r\na wife’s mother, and with an uncle’s widow.\r\n\r\n_Darwin_ considered that the marriage of first cousins was not\r\nunfavourable to fertility. Of 97 such marriages, 14 were sterile, whilst\r\nof 217 marriages of those not akin, 35 were sterile; the percentage in\r\nboth cases being almost identical. _Mantegazza_, who regards kinship in\r\nmarriage as unfavourable to fertility, found nevertheless that among 512\r\nmarriages of near kin, only 8 to 9% were sterile. It is widely believed\r\nthat the dying out of many aristocratic families is dependent on the\r\ninbreeding so common in this class—but it must be admitted that\r\nscientific evidence in support of this belief is lacking. Incest in the\r\nhuman species may certainly result in fertilization. Among the Jews,\r\nmarriages of near kin are very common, and often prove extremely\r\nfruitful.\r\n\r\n_Göhlert_ made a statistical investigation of the fertility of the\r\nreigning families of Europe, in order to throw light on this question.\r\nIn the Capet dynasty, 118 marriages of near kin took place, and of these\r\n41 were sterile; in the Wettin dynasty (Saxony), there were 28 such\r\nmarriages, of which 7 were sterile, and 1 produced one child only; in\r\nthe Wittelsbach dynasty (Bavaria), 29 such marriages, of which 9 were\r\nsterile, and 3 produced only one child each. Thus of 175 marriages of\r\nnear kin, 57, or 32.6% remained sterile. Further, in the\r\nHabsburg-Lothringen dynasty, of 110 marriages, 25 were marriages of near\r\nkin, and of these 33% remained sterile.\r\n\r\nIt has been assumed since the days of antiquity that temperament and\r\nconstitution exercise some influence on fertility. _Hippocrates_,\r\n_Soranus_, and _Diokles_, are among the ancient authors who refer to\r\nthis matter. _Soranus_ says very justly: “Since most marriages are\r\ncontracted, not from love, but for the procreation of children, it is\r\nirrational, when choosing a wife, to have regard, not to her probable\r\nfruitfulness, but instead of this to the social position and the wealth\r\nof her parents.”\r\n\r\nIt would appear that a certain dissimilarity in physical constitution\r\nand temperament between husband and wife is favourable to the fertility\r\nof the marriage. For instance, a vivacious, dark husband, and a\r\nlethargic, fair wife, are better suited to one another than a husband\r\nand wife both extremely active, or both of extremely phlegmatic\r\ntemperament.\r\n\r\n_Toussaint Loua_ published the following figures regarding the fertility\r\nof the women of the various countries of Europe:\r\n\r\n ══════════════╤═════════════╤═════════════════════════════════════════\r\n               │  Number of  │\r\n    COUNTRY.   │ births per  │FERTILITY OF WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 15\r\n               │   hundred   │              AND 45 YEARS.\r\n               │inhabitants. │\r\n ──────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────\r\n       „       │      „      │  Married.   │ Unmarried.  │  Average.\r\n ──────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Hungary       │         4.94│             │             │         17.8\r\n Russia        │         4.12│             │             │         20.5\r\n Austria       │         3.93│             │             │         16.4\r\n Germany       │         3.77│         34.8│          2.9│         17.7\r\n Italy         │         3.67│         28.8│          2.4│         16.1\r\n Holland       │         3.67│         35.3│          1.0│         16.0\r\n Finland       │         3.63│             │             │         15.8\r\n England       │         3.58│         29.7│          1.6│         15.5\r\n Scotland      │         3.53│         32.8│          2.5│         15.8\r\n Belgium       │         3.25│         33.7│          1.8│         14.8\r\n Denmark       │         3.12│         28.5│          2.8│         14.4\r\n Roumania      │         3.12│             │             │         13.5\r\n Norway        │         3.10│         29.3│          2.2│         14.0\r\n Sweden        │         3.05│         29.1│          2.5│         13.7\r\n Switzerland   │         3.04│         29.7│          1.1│         13.1\r\n Greece        │         2.96│             │             │         13.2\r\n Ireland       │         2.69│         29.8│          0.5│         12.3\r\n France        │         2.63│         20.3│          1.8│         11.6\r\n ══════════════╧═════════════╧═════════════╧═════════════╧═════════════\r\n\r\nIn towns, conjugal fertility is less, extra-conjugal fertility greater,\r\nthan in the country. An increase in factory labour gives rise to an\r\nincrease in the population, but to a decline in the vitality of the\r\noffspring; that is to say, it causes a quantitative increase, and a\r\nqualitative decrease, in fertility. An increase in agricultural labour\r\nhas precisely the opposite effect. The influence of war upon fertility\r\nis unfavourable both quantitatively, and qualitatively. According to\r\n_Tschouriloff_, the introduction of universal military service, by\r\nwithdrawing for a time all the most vigorous men from domestic life,\r\ntends to diminish fertility. Extensive emigration from a country in\r\nwhich the soil is fertile, and where the vital conditions are generally\r\nfavourable, is stated by _Bertillon_ to cause an increased fertility in\r\nthe mother country; he further states that an increase in the number of\r\nthe proprietors of the soil is followed by diminished fertility, and\r\nvice versa.\r\n\r\nProstitutes show as a rule a very low fertility. According to the data\r\nof _Tarnowskaja_, the fertility of prostitutes in Russia is 34%, whilst\r\nmarried women of similar ages in Russia exhibit a fertility of 51.8%.\r\n_Gurrieri_ found 60% of prostitutes childless.\r\n\r\nThe fertility of female criminals was found by _Lombroso_ to be\r\nundiminished. On the average, poisoners had given birth to 4.5 children,\r\nother murderesses to 3.2 children, child-murderesses to 2 children; thus\r\nthe prisoners whose crime is commonly dependent on an abnormal eroticism\r\nhad a fertility above the average.\r\n\r\nThe diminished fertility of prostitutes depends in part upon frequent\r\nvenereal infection, in part upon the unfavourable influence of the\r\nmercury and iodide of potassium administered for the cure of such\r\ninfection, also upon the frequency with which they consume excessive\r\nquantities of alcohol, upon the excessive frequency of coitus, which\r\nexercises a traumatic influence, upon the irregular mode of life, and\r\nupon their disinclination to be burdened with children.\r\n\r\nConjugal fertility, that is to say, the ratio between legitimate births\r\nand the number of married women between the ages of 15 and 50 years, has\r\ndeclined in Germany during the last decades. It was:\r\n\r\n                  During the years 1872 to 1875 29.7%\r\n                  During the years 1879 to 1882 27.4%\r\n                  During the years 1889 to 1892 26.5%\r\n\r\nThis decline is small, but it is much more manifest in urban than in\r\nrural districts. This fact is shown by the following figures, relating\r\nto fertility in Prussia:\r\n\r\n                                 1872 to 1879. 1894 to 1897.\r\n            In all towns                  26.9          24.0\r\n            In Berlin                     23.8          16.9\r\n            In other large towns          26.7          23.5\r\n            In rural districts            28.8          29.0\r\n\r\nThis difference depends principally on the fact that in the large towns\r\nof Germany (and still more in those of France) the use of means for the\r\nprevention of pregnancy is continually increasing, whereas the\r\npopulation of the rural districts is as yet less familiar with the use\r\nof these measures.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Hellstenius_, conjugal fertility, that is, the number of\r\nchildren per married couple, is as follows:\r\n\r\n                        In the Netherlands 4.88\r\n                               Norway      4.70\r\n                               Prussia     4.60\r\n                               Bavaria     4.55\r\n                               Sweden      4.52\r\n                               Saxony      4.35\r\n                               England     4.33\r\n                               Belgium     4.23\r\n                               Denmark     4.18\r\n                               France      3.46\r\n\r\n_Talquist_, who has published a statistical investigation concerning the\r\nmodern tendency to diminished fertility, arrives at lower figures than\r\n_Hellstenius_. According to him, conjugal fertility is:\r\n\r\n           In Prussia                              4.11\r\n              England                              4.10\r\n              Belgium                              4.12\r\n              France                               2.09\r\n           In various States of the American Union 2.5 to 3.0\r\n\r\nFrom the Almanach de Gotha _Vacher_ obtained figures showing that each\r\nfamily of the higher aristocracy has on the average the following number\r\nof children.\r\n\r\n                             In France  2.0\r\n                                Italy   3.0\r\n                                Germany 4.8\r\n                                England 4.9\r\n                                Russia  5.1\r\n\r\nAccording to the figures we have published, the fertility of women\r\nsuffices for the production during the sexual life of a small number\r\nonly of children, averaging, in fact, 4 to 5 children per marriage. Many\r\nmothers, however, give birth to a very large number of children. Among\r\n73,000 families inhabiting Buda-Pesth, _Körösi_ found 300 mothers who\r\nhad had 15 children or more; 7 mothers who had each had 21 children; and\r\n3 mothers who had given birth respectively to 22, 23 and 24 children.\r\n\r\nA newspaper report states that the wife of a citizen of Buda-Pesth,\r\nduring the 43 years of her married life, gave birth to 32 children. In\r\nthe year 1902, a Bohemian woman gave birth to her twenty-fourth child.\r\n_Stieda_ reports the cases of two mothers, one of whom had 21, and the\r\nother 23 children. The wife of the German Emperor, Albrecht I, and the\r\nwife of Prince Jost of Lippe-Biesterfeld, each bore 21 children.\r\n\r\nThe so-called _two-children-system_ obtains most commonly in France.\r\n\r\nIt is true that even in France there are on an average nearly three\r\nchildren born per marriage; but if we take into account surviving\r\nchildren only we find an average per family of 2.1 children only.\r\nSimilar conditions obtain in New England, and in Transylvania; and the\r\nsame practice is spreading throughout the United States. Another way in\r\nwhich the attempt is made to keep down the population is that customary\r\nin Alsace, where, if there are several children in a family one only\r\nmarries, in order to avoid a division of the family property. It cannot\r\nbe denied that in France, doubtless in consequence of the two-children\r\nsystem, a somewhat widely diffused prosperity exists, a prosperity which\r\nis lacking in the rare districts in France, such as Brittany, in which\r\nlimitation of the family is not practised. What a disastrous influence\r\nthe general use of measures for the prevention of pregnancy exercises on\r\nthe military power and political status of a nation has, however, in\r\nrecent years been made especially manifest in the case of France. In\r\nthat country, of ten million families, two million are absolutely\r\nchildless, and two million have only one child each, so that two-fifths\r\nof the French families are as good as inactive in maintaining the\r\npopulation of the country. The injury thus done to France is shown still\r\nmore clearly by a tabular comparison of the excess of births over deaths\r\nin the German and French nations, respectively, during the two decades\r\n1874 to 1894 (from _G. von Mayr’s_ _Population Statistics_).\r\n\r\n                         Year.

Among the Jews, it was the\r\nduty of a man to marry his widowed and childless sister-in-law; if he\r\nwere unwilling or unable to perform this duty he was compelled to take a\r\npart in a ritual termed “chaliza,” in which his foot was bared and the\r\nbereaved woman spat upon him, because he was unwilling to maintain his\r\nbrother’s house. In the law book of the Hindoos of _Manus_, we read, “If\r\nhusband and wife have no children, it is proper for them to obtain the\r\ndesired offspring by a union between the wife and the husband’s brother,\r\nor some other relative;” the child obtained in this way was legally\r\nregarded as the child of the husband. _Confucius_ wrote: “If your wife\r\nis barren, take a second wife; she must be subordinate to the first\r\nwife, for her only duty is the bearing of children.” An analogy to this\r\nordinance is to be found in the Bible; Abraham’s barren wife Sarai says\r\nto Abraham: “Behold now, the Lord has restrained me from bearing: I pray\r\nthee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her.\r\nAnd Abraham hearkened unto the voice of Sarai.” In the same way the\r\nbarren Rachel speaks to her husband Jacob, “Behold my maid Billah, go in\r\nunto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have\r\nchildren by her.”\r\n\r\n_Luther_, in his treatise on marital love published in the year 1522,\r\nbases, doubtless on the above biblical precedents, the following\r\nstatement regarding fertility: “If a sexually potent woman is married to\r\nan impotent man, if she is unable to take any other man openly, yet is\r\nunwilling to do anything dishonourable, she should say to her husband,\r\n“Dear husband, you cannot fulfil your duty to me, and you have deceived\r\nmy young body, you have endangered my honour and my happiness, and in\r\nthe eye of God our marriage is null, forgive me therefore if I form a\r\nsecret union with your brother or with your nearest friend; the fruit of\r\nthis union will be yours in name, thus your possessions will not fall to\r\nstrangers, and you will willingly allow me to deceive you, because\r\ninvoluntarily you have deceived me.””\r\n\r\nIn ethnography, the term _endogamy_ is used to denote a law or custom by\r\nwhich marriage is allowed only within the limits of a specified race,\r\ntribe, or caste; thus, in the Old Testament, Jews are forbidden to marry\r\nwomen of other races. The ethnographical term _exogamy_ indicates the\r\nprohibition of marriage between persons who are more closely allied, as,\r\nfor instance, the Mosaic prohibition of marriage within certain degrees\r\nof blood-relationship. Such exogamic prohibitions persist even in the\r\nlegislation of the present day. In many ecclesiastical and national laws\r\nwe find the marriage of first cousins and of uncle or aunt with niece or\r\nnephew forbidden; and even a prohibition of the marriage of a man with\r\nhis deceased wife’s sister.\r\n\r\n_Hegar_ considers the danger of inbreeding to be very great in the human\r\nspecies; for whereas in the lower animals breeders employ a methodical\r\nand carefully considered selection of the best specimens, nothing of\r\nthis kind occurs among human beings; and the health of modern civilized\r\nman is such that there are few families without a skeleton in the\r\ncloset. “Not only in families, but also in villages, in small and large\r\ntowns, even in classes, and in entire nations, certain peculiar\r\nqualities, morbid tendencies, and predispositions, are handed down from\r\ngeneration to generation. We have, for instance, the tendency of the\r\nJews to nervous disorders and diabetes, that of the English to gout,\r\nthat of the Germans to myopia.” _Strahan_ has therefore employed the\r\nterm “social consanguinity,” to indicate that by means of common\r\ncustoms, environment, occupation, and mode of nutrition, a similarity in\r\ntype is produced, leading to a similar predisposition to disorders and\r\ndiseases transmissible from father to son.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of inbreeding are believed by _Hegar_ to be, under\r\npresent-day conditions, so considerable that he would allow the marriage\r\nof near kin in exceptional cases only, and where the circumstances are\r\npeculiarly favourable—for instance, where both parties to the projected\r\nmarriage are in excellent health, and where there is no great similarity\r\nbetween them in feature or mental type. Certain anomalies transmitted\r\nfrom remote ancestors, dependent on deeply-marked peculiarities of the\r\ngerm cells, may be so developed by inbreeding as to become absolutely\r\nfixed characteristics. If the morbid manifestations can be traced back\r\nfor several generations, if the bodily defects and disturbances of\r\ndevelopment (the so-called stigmata of degeneration), are well marked\r\nand numerous, if the functional disorders of the nervous system and of\r\nthe sense organs are pronounced, leading to idiocy, insanity, epilepsy,\r\ncongenital deafmutism, blindness, instinctive criminality,—there is in\r\nsuch cases little or no hope of the regeneration of the family. It dies\r\nout, because the members are sterile; because they are confined in\r\nprisons or asylums; or because the children, if any are born, are\r\ndeficient in vitality, and fail to reach maturity.\r\n\r\nAccording to the brief summary of the subject given by _Hegar_, the\r\npeculiarities of the offspring at the time of birth depend upon:\r\n\r\nFactors which give rise to peculiarities of the germ-cells:\r\n\r\n  I. Germinal rudiments derived from the ancestors;\r\n\r\n  II. Influences acting on the germ-cells within the parent organism;\r\n\r\n  a. Owing to peculiarities of the fluids and tissues of the parental\r\n  body;\r\n\r\n  b. Owing to substances which penetrate the parental body and reach\r\n  the germ.\r\n\r\nGerminal rudiments altered by the conjugation of the male and female\r\nreproductive cells:\r\n\r\n  I. On the mother’s side;\r\n\r\n  a. Owing to peculiarities of the fluids and tissues of the maternal\r\n  body;\r\n\r\n  b. Owing to substances which penetrate the maternal organism and\r\n  reach the fertilized ovum.\r\n\r\nII. On the father’s side, owing to substances which adhere to the\r\npaternal reproductive cells, or are enclosed within these.\r\n\r\nThe number of consanguineous marriages at the present day is not less\r\nthan 5½ to 6½ per 1,000; the fertility of these marriages appears to be\r\nidentical with the fertility of ordinary marriages. _Mayet_ has made a\r\nstatistical investigation to determine the influence of consanguineous\r\nmarriages in the pathogenesis of mental disease. He finds that the\r\nnumber of those congenitally affected with mental disorder is twice as\r\ngreat in the offspring of consanguineous marriages as in the offspring\r\nof crossed marriages; in the case of simple mental disorder, of\r\nparalytic dementia, and of epileptic dementia, the ratio is actually\r\ngreater than two to one (the actual figures are 218, 257, 208 : 100).\r\nThus we see that when there exists any cause of inheritable mental\r\ndisorder, blood-relationship of the parents more than doubles the danger\r\nto the children. In the case of imbecility and idiocy the danger is less\r\nin this respect (the ratio is 150 : 100); the factor of inheritance\r\nplays a less prominent part than in the case of other psychoses.\r\n\r\nIt was remarkable that among the offspring of marriages of nephew and\r\naunt, cases of mental disorder were almost entirely lacking. Among the\r\noffspring of marriages of uncle and niece, the inheritance of mental\r\ndisorder was more prominent than among the children of first cousins. It\r\nis interesting to determine the influence of blood-relationship in cases\r\nin which the existence of inheritable predisposition could not be\r\nproved. In these cases, as regards simple insanity, paralytic dementia,\r\nand epileptic dementia, the number of cases among the offspring of\r\nconsanguineous marriages was only one-half as compared with the\r\noffspring of crossed marriages; whereas in the case of imbecility and\r\nidiocy this ratio was reversed. In idiocy, where inheritance generally\r\nspeaking plays a small part, the origination of the disease would often\r\nappear to depend directly on the blood-relationship of the parents;\r\nwhilst as regards other forms of mental disorder, if there is no\r\ninheritable predisposition, blood relationship in the parents appears to\r\nbe a positive advantage; where, however, a family predisposition to\r\ninsanity exists the likelihood of actual insanity appearing in the\r\noffspring is notably enhanced by a consanguineous marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Restriction of Fertility and the Use of Means for the Prevention of\r\n                              Pregnancy._\r\n\r\nAs we have already pointed out, a restriction of the fertility of women\r\noccurs in the majority of marriages, to this extent, that the potential\r\nreproductive powers of the wife are not fully utilized. In recent times,\r\nhowever, the restriction of fertility, by the deliberate use of measures\r\nfor the prevention of pregnancy, has become so widely diffused, that it\r\nappears unwise from the scientific standpoint simply to ignore the\r\nquestion, and it has become indispensable to study how the practice\r\ndeveloped, and to consider what are its actual results. From our own\r\npoint of view, it is the more necessary to do this, for the reason that\r\nthe use of preventive measures has come to play an important part in the\r\nsexual life of woman, and therefore deserves the fullest attention, not\r\nmerely from the standpoint of the sociologist, but in addition from the\r\npurely medical point of view.\r\n\r\nIn many divisions of the population, and even in entire nationalities,\r\nthe prevention of pregnancy, not merely in illicit intercourse, but also\r\nin married life, has become so general a practice that the fertility of\r\nthe nation as a whole has been profoundly modified. Thus, in France at\r\nthe present day, the average number of children per marriage is less\r\nthan two; and the two-children-system is almost universally practised in\r\nTransylvania and Norway, whilst it is very rapidly spreading in North\r\nAmerica. In the principal towns of the whole of Europe, this system is\r\nlargely on the increase among the upper classes of society. The\r\nmarriages of the poor, partly owing to ignorance, and partly to\r\nindolence, are as yet comparatively little affected by this depopulative\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nIn the days of antiquity, many lawgivers endeavoured to set bounds to\r\nexcessive fertility, and artificial abortion was methodically practised\r\nby those who wished to avoid an inconveniently large family. Even among\r\nsavage peoples, we find that certain preventive measures are\r\noccasionally employed in sexual intercourse. Among civilized peoples,\r\nhowever, until the beginning of the nineteenth century, religious and\r\nmoral ideas derived from the Bible continued to dominate the sexual\r\nlife. It is well known that Old Testament law and Christian morality\r\nalike forbid any artificial restriction of human increase. “Increase and\r\nmultiply” was the command given in Genesis to the first parents of the\r\nrace; and the psalmist exclaims, “Happy is the man that hath his quiver\r\nfull” of children.\r\n\r\nA remarkable revolution in thought was initiated toward the beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth century by the great philanthropist and powerful thinker,\r\n_Thomas Robert Malthus_, founder of the doctrine of the propriety of\r\nchecking the increase of population, author of the work “An Essay on the\r\nPrinciple of Population,” London, 1798, whose Law of Population soon\r\nattracted world-wide attention. Modern civilization having greatly\r\nincreased the cost of bringing up a family, while simultaneously there\r\nhas been a general rise in the price of the necessaries of life, there\r\nhas resulted an extraordinary diffusion of Malthusianism; in comparison\r\nwith the causes just alluded to for the use of preventive measures,\r\ndiseases which render renewal of pregnancy dangerous to the mother’s\r\nlife have comparatively little to do with the causation of voluntary\r\nsterility.\r\n\r\nIn his “Essay on the Principle of Population,” _Malthus_ indicates, as\r\nthe cause which has hitherto hindered mankind in the pursuit of\r\nhappiness, the unceasing tendency of all organic life to increase in\r\nexcess of the means of subsistence. In the case of plants and of\r\nunreasoning animals, the natural process is a very simple one. Both\r\nanimals and plants are impelled by a powerful instinct to reproduce\r\ntheir kind, and the operation of this instinct is quite undisturbed by\r\nany anxiety regarding the livelihood of their offspring. The\r\nreproductive function is thus exercised at every available opportunity,\r\nand the superfluous individuals of the next generation are destroyed by\r\nlack of space and nutriment. In the human species the restriction of\r\npopulation is effected by a more complex mode of operation. Man is\r\nimpelled to reproduce his kind by an instinct not less powerful than\r\nthat of other animals; but the gratification of this instinct is checked\r\nby reason, which makes him ask himself whether he is not about to bring\r\ninto the world beings for whom he will be unable to provide the means of\r\nsubsistence. If he is influenced by this consideration, the resulting\r\nrestriction of population may often entail serious consequences; if, on\r\nthe other hand, he gratifies his instinct, regardless of the appeal of\r\nreason, the human species will inevitably tend to increase more rapidly\r\nthan the means of subsistence.\r\n\r\n_Malthus_ declared that population, when its increase was unrestricted,\r\ndoubled itself every twenty-five years, and therefore increased in a\r\ngeometrical progression; he considered that in the most favourable\r\ncircumstances the means of subsistence could not possibly increase more\r\nrapidly than in an arithmetical progression. The contrast between these\r\ntwo modes of increase will be more striking if we write out the actual\r\nfigures. According to the theory of _Malthus_, the increase of human\r\npopulation would be represented by the figures 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,\r\n128, 256, whereas the simultaneous increase in the means of subsistence\r\nwould be represented by the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Such an\r\nincrease in population is, however, always prevented by certain checks,\r\nclassed by _Malthus_ as of two kinds, preventive checks and positive\r\nchecks.\r\n\r\nA preventive check, in so far as it is voluntary, is peculiar to the\r\nhuman species, and originates in the intellectual faculty which enables\r\nman to foresee the consequences of his actions. A man who looks around\r\nhim, and sees the poverty into which those with large families so often\r\nfall, who reckons up his present property or earnings, which barely\r\nsuffice to provide for his own personal necessities, cannot fail, when\r\nhe considers how hardly they would suffice for seven or eight additional\r\npersons, to doubt whether it would be possible for him to provide for\r\nthe offspring he might bring into the world. Such considerations as\r\nthese are likely to lead a large number of persons of all civilized\r\nnations to resist their natural instincts, and to refrain from early\r\nmarriage. If abstinence entailed no serious consequences, it would be\r\nthe least of all evils resulting from the principle of population.\r\n\r\nThe positive checks to increase of population are manifold, and embrace\r\nall the causes which are competent to lessen the natural duration of\r\nhuman life. Among these we may enumerate: all unhealthy occupations,\r\nsevere toil, climatic conditions, poverty, errors in the rearing of\r\nchildren, town life, excesses of all kinds, the whole army of illnesses\r\nand epidemics, war, pestilence, and famine. In all countries, preventive\r\nand positive checks are more or less powerfully operative, and yet there\r\nare few in which the population is not continually tending to increase\r\nbeyond the means of subsistence. As a further consequence of this\r\ntendency of population to increase, we observe the wider diffusion of\r\npoverty among the lower classes, so that any permanent improvement in\r\ntheir condition is rendered impossible.\r\n\r\nAfter _Malthus_ had carefully stated his thesis, he gave a summary\r\nrecord of the conditions of population in nearly all nations of the past\r\nand of his own time, in order to show how in all alike the three\r\nprincipal means of limiting population, moral restraint, disease, and\r\npoverty, had been in continuous operation.\r\n\r\nHe showed, for instance, how the population of the South Sea Islands had\r\nbeen limited by certain conditions, cannibalism, castration of the\r\nmales, infibulation of the females, late marriages, the sanctification\r\nof virginity, contempt for marriage, etc.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Greece, Solon’s laws permitted infanticide. _Plato_, in “The\r\nRepublic” asserts that it is the duty of the Government to regulate the\r\nnumber of the citizens, and to prevent an immoderate increase; men and\r\nwomen should be allowed to procreate only during their period of maximum\r\nstrength, all weakly children should be killed. _Aristotle_ advised that\r\nmen should not be allowed to marry before the age of 37, and women\r\nbefore the age of 18; the women should give birth to a limited number of\r\nchildren only; if, after this, they again became pregnant, abortion\r\nshould be induced. He maintained that if all were at liberty, as was the\r\ncase in most countries, to bring into the world as many children as they\r\npleased, poverty, the mother of crime and insurrection, must inevitably\r\nensue.\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans war was as a positive check unceasingly operative: in\r\nthis time of the Empire, preventive methods came into general use, in\r\nthe form of various kinds of sexual perversity. _Juvenal_ complains of\r\nthe skilled methods employed in the induction of abortion; during the\r\nlater period of the Roman Empire, sexual morality became so degenerate\r\nthat marriage was hated and despised.\r\n\r\nPassing to the consideration of the checks on population among the\r\nnations of modern Europe, _Malthus_ examined the registers of marriages\r\nand deaths, and came to the conclusion that in few countries is the mass\r\nof people sufficiently capable of self-restraint to postpone marriage\r\nuntil they are reasonably assured of being able to provide for all the\r\nchildren they are likely to have; still, he ascertained that at the\r\npresent day positive checks on population were less active, and\r\npreventive checks more active, than in earlier times and among savage\r\nraces.\r\n\r\n_Malthus_ did not base upon his conclusions the advice that in sexual\r\nintercourse means of preventing pregnancy should be employed, as the\r\nmodern “Malthusians” advise; in his eyes, moral restraint, that is to\r\nsay, sexual abstinence, was the only remedy for the prevention of\r\npoverty and the other evil consequences of the principle of population.\r\nMoral restraint was in his opinion the only virtuous method of avoiding\r\nthe evils of excessive fertility. It was a man’s duty not to marry until\r\nhe had a definite prospect of being able to maintain his children; the\r\ninterval between puberty and marriage must be passed in strict chastity.\r\nMan’s duty is not the mere reproduction of his species, but the\r\nreproduction of virtue and happiness, and if he is not able to do the\r\nlatter, he has no right whatever to do the former. _Malthus_ lays great\r\nstress on educating the people in this matter; “in addition to the\r\nordinary subjects of instruction, it is necessary to explain the\r\nprinciple of population, and the manner in which it gives rise to\r\npoverty.” In the nature of the case, no lasting and general improvement\r\nin the condition of the poor is possible without an increase in the\r\npreventive restriction of population.\r\n\r\nThe _Malthusian_ doctrine of the law of population gave rise to an\r\nenormous sensation, and some of his disciples soon proceeded to\r\ntranslate his conclusions into practice; such authorities as _James\r\nMill_ and _Francis Place_ recommended measures by means of which,\r\n“without any injury to health, or to the feminine sense of delicacy,\r\nconception can be prevented:” the avowed aim of these measures was to\r\nprevent the increase of population beyond the means of subsistence.\r\nPhysicians and physiologists joined the ranks of these innovators; among\r\nothers _Raciborski_, _Robert Dale Owen_ in his “Moral Physiology,”\r\n_Richard Carlile_ in his “Book of Woman,” the first work to give an\r\nexact description of the means to employ for the prevention of\r\nconception, _Knowlton_ in his “Fruits of Philosophy.” In the year 1827\r\nin the Northern counties of England leaflets were for the first time\r\ndistributed among the working classes to instruct them in the use of\r\npreventive measures. _Bradlaugh_ founded the Malthusian Society, which\r\naimed at the dissemination of instruction in the use of preventive\r\nmethods. There is now in England a “Malthusian League,” numbering\r\nleading physicians among its members; this supplies to all classes the\r\nmeans by which the family can be artificially limited. A new edition of\r\nthe above-mentioned book, “The Fruits of Philosophy,” was circulated in\r\nLondon in an edition of several hundred thousand copies, and prominent\r\npersons spoke at congresses on the subject of Neo-Malthusianism. In\r\nGermany, also, a “Union of Social Harmony” was founded, for the free\r\ndistribution of a hand-book on the use of measures for the prevention of\r\nconception, and for an investigation regarding the results of these.\r\n\r\nWe do not propose here to subject the teaching of _Malthus_ to a\r\ncritical examination; he has found formidable opponents, who have\r\nendeavoured to prove that his fundamental assumption is false; they\r\nmaintain that work or the power of work increases in direct ratio with\r\nthe population; and they also assert that population tends to increase,\r\nnot, as _Malthus_ maintained, in a geometrical, but simply in an\r\narithmetical progression. We shall merely quote _Liebig’s_ reply to the\r\nlaw of Malthus, “when human labour and manure are provided in sufficient\r\nquantity, the soil is inexhaustible, and will continue to yield\r\nunceasingly, the most abundant harvests;” and _Rodbertus’_ remark that\r\n“agricultural chemistry will ultimately be competent to create nutritive\r\nmaterials; this will some day be just as much within the power of\r\nsociety, as it is at present to provide any requisite quantity of\r\ntextiles, given the necessary amount of raw material.” The celebrated\r\nsocialist _Bebel_, is a strong opponent of _Malthus_. He writes: “The\r\nearth is doubtless thickly populated, but none the less only a small\r\nfraction of its surface is occupied and utilized. Not merely could Great\r\nBritain produce, as has been proved, a far larger supply of nutritive\r\nmaterials than at present, but the same is true of France, Germany and\r\nAustria, and in a still higher degree of the other countries of Europe.\r\nEuropean Russia, were it as thickly populated as Germany, could support,\r\ninstead of ninety millions, as at present, a population of four hundred\r\nand seventy-five millions. For the purposes of the higher civilization,\r\ntoward which we are striving, we have to-day in Europe, and shall have\r\nfor a long time to come, not an excess of population, but an\r\ninsufficiency, and every day brings new discoveries and inventions\r\nwhereby the means of subsistence are potentially increased. In other\r\nparts of the world, the insufficiency of population and the superfluity\r\nof ground are even more noticeable. _Carey_ is of opinion that the\r\nsingle valley of the Orinoco, fifteen hundred miles in length, would\r\nsuffice to provide nutritive material in sufficient quantities to feed\r\nthe whole existing population of the world. Central and South America,\r\nand more especially Brazil, have a soil of extraordinary fertility, but\r\nare as yet practically unutilized by the world. To increase, not to\r\ndiminish, the numbers of the human race, that is the appeal made by\r\ncivilization to mankind!” A similar position on this question was\r\nrecently taken by Roosevelt, the President of the United States, himself\r\nthe father of six children, in a letter to two American women, _Mrs. J._\r\nand _M. Van Vorst_, authors of the book “Woman Who Toils (Factory Life\r\nin America).” In this book, the writers prove that in the United States\r\nthe average size of the family is now less than in any other country of\r\nthe world, France alone excepted. President Roosevelt, in his letter,\r\ndeclares himself an ardent supporter of the biblical injunction,\r\n“increase and multiply!” He writes: “Whoever evades his\r\nresponsibilities, through desire for independence, convenience, and\r\nluxury, commits a crime against the race to which he belongs, and should\r\nbe an object of contempt and horror to a healthy nation. When men avoid\r\nbecoming fathers of families, and when women cease to regard motherhood\r\nas the most important career open to them, the nation to which these men\r\nand women belong has cause for uneasiness about its future.” President\r\nRoosevelt continues: “To the American woman marriage is no longer a\r\nlife-duty, a profession, as it is to her sisters who are members of the\r\nolder civilizations. A woman who manages an extensive business, who\r\nsupervises her own landed property, or who plays her own part in the\r\nworld of finance,—for such as these, the ‘lottery of marriage’ is\r\nnaturally something they dread rather than desire.” President Elliott,\r\nof Harvard College, has expressed similar views in a speech on this\r\nsubject. He deplores the late marriages and small families of the\r\ncultured Americans. According to the last census, an American family has\r\non the average less than three children; twenty years ago the average\r\nnumber was from four to five children.\r\n\r\nI pass now to consider the medical point of view of this question of the\r\nprevention of pregnancy. It is my opinion that the physician as such\r\nshould intervene in the matter, not in any case for the relief of the\r\ndominant economic parental dread of insufficient means for the\r\nupbringing of children, but only on account of the purely medical\r\nconsideration of the physical dangers of motherhood. That is to say, the\r\nphysician should lend his skilled assistance toward the attainment of\r\nfacultative sterility, only when his own special scientific knowledge\r\nleads him to consider this urgently necessary; it is not his province to\r\nassist in preventing the birth of an immoderate number of offspring; his\r\nintervention is justified only when deliberate reflection has convinced\r\nhim that his patient’s health or life would be endangered by pregnancy\r\nor childbirth. A woman’s life and well-being must appear to him of\r\ngreater importance than the existence or non-existence of a possible\r\ninfant. That this view is morally sound, is shown by the fact that\r\npublic opinion justifies the accoucheur in the destruction of an already\r\nliving child, when the mother’s life is endangered. In this connection\r\nwe may recall the words of the great Napoleon; the physician Dubois,\r\nattending Marie Louise in a difficult confinement, asked Napoleon\r\nwhether, if matters came to an extremity, he should save the mother or\r\nthe child; Napoleon, notwithstanding his strong desire for the birth of\r\nan heir to his dynasty, replied, “The mother, it is her right.”\r\n\r\nIn isolated cases, which deserve always very serious consideration, some\r\npathological condition in the wife may justify the prevention of\r\npregnancy. In certain very serious general disorders, in diseases of the\r\nheart or of the lungs, in pelvic deformity, and in pathological changes\r\nof the female reproductive organs, it may be right to employ means for\r\nthe prevention of pregnancy—not merely sexual abstinence, but actual\r\nmeasures to prevent fertilization.\r\n\r\nThe misuse of medical knowledge for the recommendation or employment of\r\npreventive measures, on the ground of humanitarian sentiment or social\r\nand economic considerations, must, however, be strongly resisted. Even\r\nleading gynecologists have erred in this way. _Saenger_ writes,\r\n“Scientifically-trained accoucheurs will do much more to promote the\r\nhealth and well-being of women, and to protect them from sexual and\r\nother diseases, than the humanitarian efforts of the Neo-Malthusians,\r\nwho transfer a purely scientific question, such as the disproportion\r\nbetween the number of births and the supply of nutritive material, to\r\nthe sphere of medicine, regarding themselves as justified in preventing\r\nconception whenever they please, independently of considerations\r\nrelating to the health of the mother * * * * * * * * A woman exhausted\r\nby frequent child-bearing, anæmic and suffering, is certainly a figure\r\nto arouse everyone’s sympathy; in so far as she is ill in consequence of\r\ninjury received in childbirth, it is our duty to prevent further injury,\r\nand to relieve to the best of our ability that which has already\r\noccurred; in so far, however, as she is not suffering from any affection\r\nof the reproductive organs, but is ill owing to the lack of sufficient\r\nfood, or from overwork, it is the duty of society to render assistance.\r\nHere we have to do with the social problem; the solution of which will\r\nbe brought no nearer by the use of the occlusive pessary.” _Fehling_\r\nalso maintained that a text-book of gynecology is not the proper place\r\nin which to pass judgment on so important a socio-political question.\r\nThe business of the gynecologist in this matter is merely to say a word\r\nof caution against the use of various measures which are so often\r\nrecommended as harmless, but are in fact dangerous to the woman who uses\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Kleinwächter_, who declares that he is far from recommending the use of\r\npreventive measures when a healthy woman wishes to save herself the\r\ntrouble of child-bearing, gives as legitimate indications for their use:\r\n1, the various forms of severe pelvic deformity; 2, certain tumours in\r\nthe pelvic cavity; 3, after the removal of malignant tumours of the\r\nreproductive organs, certain general disorders, recently arrested\r\npulmonary tuberculosis, organic heart disease, etc. Regarding these\r\ncases, _Kleinwächter_ writes: “The wife’s life would be endangered by\r\npregnancy, which must therefore be prevented without forbidding coitus,\r\nand avoiding the practice of coitus interruptus, which endangers her\r\nhealth, or of any mode of intercourse repugnant to the feelings of wife\r\nor husband.”\r\n\r\nThe most trustworthy, but unquestionably at the same time the least\r\npracticable method, for the prevention of pregnancy, is that of\r\n_Malthus_—permanent sexual continence. This recommendation, to which\r\n_Tolstoi_ in “The Kreuzer Sonata” gives his adhesion, has recently found\r\nan advocate in a modified sense in a distinguished gynecologist,\r\n_Hegar_, who considers that the great fertility of the modern civilized\r\ncountries of Europe entails many disadvantages—inferior physical\r\ndevelopment, increased general mortality, emigration, an unfavourable\r\ndistribution of population in relation to dwelling and occupation,\r\noccasional famine—and who sees the only effective remedy in a\r\n“regulation of reproduction,” whereby the tendency to marriage and the\r\nnumber of births are to be diminished. The question “when is the number\r\nof children in a family too large?” is answered by _Hegar_ as follows “A\r\nmaximal limit is easy to establish. The most suitable age for\r\nchild-bearing is from twenty to forty. At an earlier and a later age\r\nthan this, both the mother and the offspring are liable to suffer.\r\nBetween two successive births there should be an interval of about two\r\nand a half years; this would leave time for the birth of eight children.\r\nIf we assume that pregnancy lasts nine months, that lactation is\r\ncontinued from nine to twelve months after delivery, (and if the mother\r\ndoes not herself nurse the child, artificial feeding or careful\r\nsupervision of the wet-nurse will occupy her for a like period), to\r\ndevote an additional period of six months to nine months to the complete\r\nrestoration of the mother’s health cannot be regarded as excessive. For\r\nthis maximum family we assume a perfect state of health on the part of\r\nthe mother, a pure atmosphere, and a sufficient supply of all the\r\nnecessaries of life. Illnesses, weakness, or infirmity of the mother,\r\noften indicate that the number of children should be further limited. It\r\nis easier to provide a suitable dwelling and a pure atmosphere for a\r\nsmall family than for a large one. The same thing is true as regards the\r\nmeans of subsistence.\r\n\r\n“If the reproductive function is to be intelligently controlled,”\r\ncontinues _Hegar_, “above all it is necessary to devote attention to the\r\nage and health of the parents; but occupation, dwelling, and general\r\nenvironment, must also not be overlooked. Among the cultured classes of\r\nour Fatherland, people are gradually learning to form sound opinions\r\nabout these matters. Among the working classes, on the other hand,\r\nespecially among those engaged in factory labour, the heedless\r\ngratification of the sexual impulse is responsible for untold misery.”\r\n_Hegar’s_ advice may be summarized as follows: If the marriage takes\r\nplace after the attainment of complete maturity, in the wife at twenty\r\nand in the husband at twenty-five, and if procreation is discontinued in\r\nthe wife at forty and in the husband at forty-five to fifty, if between\r\nsuccessive deliveries the intervals necessary for the wife’s restoration\r\nto health are maintained, if illness and states of debility are taken\r\ninto account, if sickly, hereditarily-tainted individuals are forbidden\r\nto marry—the excessive increase in population, as far as Germany is\r\nconcerned, will cease to give cause for anxiety. The regulation of\r\nreproduction will, however, still be incomplete, unless we enforce a\r\nselection too rigorous for our present views. Moderation and continence\r\nmust aid as far as may be necessary in preventing an undue increase in\r\npopulation. _Hegar_ does not fail to point out the evil effects of an\r\nexcessive limitation of the family. In a marriage when one child only is\r\nborn, this child is the object of unceasing anxiety and attention, and\r\nreal or imaginary dangers assume an excessive importance in the morbidly\r\nexcited imagination of the parents. Hence we find a continuous excess of\r\nwatchfulness and over-education in the case of the only child, to whom\r\nindependent thought and action are entirely unknown. Boys become\r\nmilksops, girls nervous and hysterical. In the two-children-system,\r\nagain, one or both of the children may die when the age of the parents\r\nis already considerably advanced. Still in those districts of France in\r\nwhich this system obtains the population is well-to-do, and an\r\nexceptionally large proportion of the males are fit for military\r\nservice. The use of various measures for the prevention of conception is\r\nconsidered by _Hegar_ to be harmful, at any rate in the case of young\r\nwomen; this practice gives rise to anæmic conditions, and to nervous\r\nweakness and irritability, seldom, however, to more serious disorders,\r\nas indeed is apparent from the fact that the mortality of married women\r\nas compared with unmarried women is lower in France than in other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n_Gräfe_, with reference to the view that if for any reason conception\r\nmust be prevented, this should be done by abstinence from sexual\r\nintercourse, remarks: “Doubtless an ideal demand, but one which even\r\nthose with exceptional strength of will are unlikely to satisfy. And the\r\nworst of it is, that even a single indiscretion will often result in\r\nimpregnation. Moreover, it is distinctly contrary to natural conditions,\r\nthat a healthy married couple united by an intimate affection should\r\nlive together abstaining completely from sexual intercourse. The\r\nquestion has already been much discussed, both in speech and writing,\r\nand this will continue in the future, without altering the fact that the\r\nphysician will be asked, and will be compelled to give, advice regarding\r\nthe use of means of the prevention of pregnancy.”\r\n\r\n_Ribbing_ writes, “Although the sexual impulse is the product of a\r\npowerful natural developmental force, still the temporary, and sometimes\r\neven the permanent, control of this impulse is a moral civilizing force\r\nof enormous importance.” This writer is opposed to the use of artificial\r\npreventive measures; he considers them untrustworthy and dangerous to\r\nhealth. Untrustworthy, for the reason that nature has endowed living\r\norganisms with a strong impulse toward conjugation and has equipped with\r\nvery powerful forces the processes by which fertilization is effected.\r\nEvery physician is familiar with cases in which preventive measures have\r\nproved ineffective. This fact is proved also by the statistics of\r\nprostitution. Although prostitutes are fully instructed in the use of\r\npreventive measures, which they almost universally employ, nevertheless\r\nevery year a smaller or larger number of prostitutes become pregnant.\r\nThese measures are dangerous to health, partly because of their\r\ninterference with natural functions, because many of them are clumsy and\r\nill adapted; and partly, again, because owing to their use the woman\r\nfails to enjoy the natural periods of repose which are entailed by\r\npregnancy, parturition, and lactation. Noteworthy also are the psychical\r\nconsiderations adduced by _Ribbing_ against the use of preventive\r\nmeasures. The majority of well-bred women feel deeply wounded if they\r\nbelieve themselves to be regarded merely as a means of enjoyment, not as\r\nindividuals, as persons with inalienable rights. For the man also there\r\nis danger, for it is easy for him to acquire a dislike to the wife who,\r\neven though on his own initiative, occupies herself with the technique\r\nof the sexual life in a manner which he feels instinctively to be\r\nopposed to the chastity and puremindedness demanded by every man from\r\nhis wife. _Ribbing_ therefore advises a certain measure of sexual\r\nabstinence in married life.\r\n\r\n_Max Nordau_ also insists on the moral disadvantages of the wide\r\ndiffusion of the use of preventive measures. “If a race or nation has\r\nreached this point in its downward career, the individuals of which it\r\nis composed lose the capacity of loving in a healthy and natural manner.\r\nThe sense of the family disappears; the men will not marry, because they\r\nfind it inconvenient to burden themselves with the responsibility for\r\nanother human life, and to care for any other creature than themselves;\r\nthe women dread the pains and inconveniences of motherhood, and if they\r\nmarry, they endeavour, by the employment of the most immoral means, to\r\nensure barrenness. The reproductive instinct, of which reproduction has\r\nceased to be the aim, is in some annulled, whilst in others it\r\ndegenerates into the most peculiar and irrational perversities. The act\r\nof sexual union, the most sublime function of the organism, is degraded\r\ninto a profligate act of lust; it is no longer undertaken in the\r\ninterest of the perpetuation of the species, but exclusively for the\r\npleasure of the individual, and without any relation to the needs of the\r\ncommunity.”\r\n\r\n_Alfred Russel Wallace_ has advocated sexual continence as a preventive\r\nmeasure during the period of maximum vitality and strength; he advises\r\nthat the age of marriage of women should be considerably advanced, in\r\norder to diminish their fertility. If woman’s average age at marriage\r\nwere 29, instead of 20 years, the fertility of marriages would be\r\nreduced in the ratio of 8 : 5.\r\n\r\nThe desired goal of artificial sterility will not, however, be reached\r\nthrough the advocacy of moderation and continence. The numerous\r\nadditional measures employed for this purpose may be classified as\r\n_physiological_ and _artificial_; the latter class may be further\r\nsubdivided into _mechanical_ and _operative_.\r\n\r\nBy physiological means for the prevention of conception, we understand\r\nmeasures which aim at producing sterility by reducing the number of acts\r\nof intercourse and by restricting these acts to certain defined periods\r\nof time. The physiological preventive measures, apart from the higher\r\nethical value they possess in comparison with artificial measures, have\r\nthe advantage that they may be regarded as harmless to the general\r\nhealth of the woman and to the integrity of her reproductive organs in\r\nparticular; they have, however, this very serious disadvantage, that the\r\nresults of their use are very uncertain, so that they offer no more than\r\na probability, and often a very moderate probability that conception\r\nwill be prevented.\r\n\r\nAs a physiological measure for the attainment of facultative sterility\r\n“without breaking any moral law,” _Capellmann_ advised abstinence from\r\ncoitus during a period of fourteen days after menstruation and three to\r\nfour days before the commencement of the flow. Without laying too much\r\nstress on the fact that by following this recommendation the period\r\nduring which the intercourse is permissible would be extremely\r\nrestricted, it is necessary to point out that, whilst in this way the\r\noccurrence of conception may be rendered less probable, its prevention\r\nis by no means guaranteed, for it is an established fact that a woman\r\nmay be impregnated by intercourse on any single day of the\r\nintermenstrual interval. _Capellmann’s_ advice, embodying, as he\r\nexpresses it, the “only morally permissible” means for the prevention of\r\nconception, was not original, for the same recommendation was given at\r\nan earlier date by _Raciborski_, who, however, regarded the measure as\r\nvery uncertain. _Capellmann_ is of opinion that it is sufficiently\r\ntrustworthy for practical purposes.\r\n\r\n_Bebel_, who is a declared opponent of Malthusianism, none the less lays\r\ndown positive rules for the diminution of procreative capacity and of\r\nfertility by regulation of the diet. He refers to the example of the\r\nbees, which, by a change of nutriment, can produce a new queen-bee at\r\nwill. “Thus the bees,” he says, “are in advance of human beings in their\r\nknowledge of sexual development. Presumably they have not been\r\ncompelled, for a couple of thousand years, to listen to sermons\r\ninforming them that to occupy themselves about sexual matters is\r\n‘improper’ and ‘immoral.’ There is no doubt whatever that the mode of\r\nnutrition has an influence on the composition of the male semen, and\r\nalso on the susceptibility to fertilization of the female ovum; hence\r\nthe increase in population must to a very important extent depend on the\r\nmode of nutrition. If this could be definitely established, we should\r\nhave, in the supply of nutriment, a means of regulating the population.\r\nAs an example of the effect, in this connection, of the mode of\r\nnutrition in the human species, it is reported that in consequence of\r\nthe fatty and nutritious diet of the old Bavarian peasants, who lived\r\nchiefly on very rich puddings, the marriages of the well-to-do peasants\r\nwere frequently childless. However, it must not be forgotten that\r\npre-conjugal intercourse, which was customary in that part of the world,\r\nand was somewhat promiscuous in character, may have contributed to cause\r\nthis sterility.” Finally, _Bebel_ points out that the woman of the\r\nfuture “will be unwilling to bear a large number of children. She will\r\nwish to enjoy a measure of personal freedom and independence, and will\r\nnot consent to pass half or three-quarters of the best years of her life\r\neither pregnant, or with a child at her breast. From this it will result\r\nthat the population will be regulated, without unwholesome sexual\r\nabstinence, and without the employment of unpleasant preventive\r\nmeasures.” However, _Bebel_ gives us no details as to the precise manner\r\nin which this regulation is to be effected.\r\n\r\n_Tolstoi_, in his widely celebrated book “The Kreuzer Sonata,” condemns\r\nabsolutely the gratification of the sexual impulse. He demands the\r\nrecognition of the fact that “sexual congress, in which a man either\r\navoids the natural consequences—the birth of children,—or else throws\r\nthe whole burden of these consequences on the woman, is opposed to the\r\nsimplest demands of morality, is in fact utterly base.” To render\r\npossible the sexual abstinence he regards as morally necessary, men must\r\nnot only endeavour to live in a natural way, but they must consume no\r\nalcohol, eat with great moderation, abstain from meat, and not be afraid\r\nof hard work. _Tolstoi_ even demands that men and women shall be so\r\nbrought up “that both before and after marriage they may regard love,\r\nand the sensual passion associated therewith, not as they do at present,\r\nas a sublime and poetical state, but as a bestial condition degrading to\r\nhumanity.” _Tolstoi_ is, however, utterly opposed to the use of\r\npreventive measures: “first, because they liberate men from the cares\r\nand sorrows entailed by having children, which must be regarded as the\r\npenance to be paid for sensual love; and, secondly, because their use is\r\nclosely allied to the crime most repugnant to the human conscience, the\r\ncrime of murder.” Chastity is no less a duty after marriage than before;\r\nafter marriage man and wife must “continue to pray to be delivered from\r\ntemptation, and must endeavour to replace sensual love by the pure\r\nrelationship of brother and sister.”\r\n\r\n_Eulenburg_ regards the modern diffusion and the continuous increase in\r\nthe use of preventive measures as signs of decadence; _Löwenfeld_, on\r\nthe other hand, regarding the social conditions of the present day as\r\nthe principal source of the use of preventive measures, sees therein no\r\nmoral decay, but on the contrary rather a rise in the moral standard of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAnother physiological means of prevention is to be found in avoiding\r\ncohabitation in that season or month in which, judging by the woman’s\r\nprevious deliveries, she would appear to have been peculiarly\r\nsusceptible to impregnation. _Cohnstein_ maintained that in woman, as in\r\nthe lower animals, the capacity for conception was associated with a\r\nparticular season of the year, that there was, in fact, an individual\r\ntime of predilection for impregnation. The assumption that there is such\r\na time of predilection is, however, traversed by the fact, familiar to\r\nall who have recorded the birthdays of children in large families, that\r\nthese occur in the most diverse months of the year. It has, indeed, been\r\nstatistically proved that certain months and seasons are especially\r\nfavourable to conception, that a maximum of conceptions occurs in the\r\nspring, and a second much smaller maximum in the winter; but these\r\nvariations in the number of conceptions depend mainly on social factors,\r\nas, for instance, upon the customary season for marriage, opportunity\r\nfor intercourse between the sexes, common labours in the house or in the\r\nopen, etc. This alleged time of predilection for conception cannot,\r\ntherefore, seriously be considered in the discussion of measures for the\r\nprevention of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nAs a physiological means for preventing conception, passivity of the\r\nwoman during sexual intercourse has also been recommended. It is well\r\nknown that an active participation on the part of the woman in the\r\nsexual act, by increasing her voluptuous sensations, gives rise to\r\ncertain reflex actions, viz., descent of the uterus, rounding of the os\r\nuteri, induration of the portio vaginalis, and, finally, ejaculation of\r\nthe secretion of the cervical glands and of the glands of Bartholin;\r\nthese changes accelerate the entrance of the semen into the cavity of\r\nthe uterus, and increase the motility of the spermatozoa. Upon this fact\r\nis based the assumption, that, in consequence of deficient sexual\r\nexcitement during intercourse, either spontaneous, or when the woman\r\nintentionally remains “cold,” the reflex actions by which the upward\r\npassage of the spermatozoa is favoured, fail to occur; there is a good\r\ndeal of evidence in favour of the truth of this view. _Riedel_ reports\r\nregarding the women of the Island of Buru, that they often have sexual\r\nintercourse with strange men, “but during sexual congress in such cases\r\nthey maintain a passive and indifferent state, for the purpose of\r\navoiding impregnation.” _Von Krafft-Ebing_ points out that prostitutes,\r\nwhen having sexual intercourse with men to whom they are attached,\r\nexperience voluptuous excitement, whilst in intercourse with men to whom\r\nthey are indifferent they remain entirely passive. From this it would\r\nappear that these uterine reflexes are under the dominion of the\r\nconscious will; but sufficient dependence cannot be placed on this fact\r\nin all circumstances for it to be possible to employ such voluntary\r\ncontrol as a trustworthy means of prevention. Allied to this is\r\npreviously-mentioned Chinese practice of Kong-fou, a kind of hypnosis,\r\nin which during sexual intercourse the thoughts are concentrated on some\r\nother matter, and thereby conception is supposed to be prevented.\r\n\r\nArtificial protraction of the period of lactation is an old and\r\nwell-known method, practised by many savage peoples, for the prevention\r\nof fertilization. As a general rule, as long as lactation continues,\r\namenorrhœa persists, and sexual intercourse remains unfruitful. But this\r\nrule also is not universally valid.\r\n\r\nArtificial means for the attainment of facultative sterility are those\r\nby which the attempt is made to prevent pregnancy by some mechanical\r\nhindrance to the contact of the semen with the ovum, since without this\r\ncontact conception cannot possibly occur.\r\n\r\nThe oldest of these means is that described in the book of Genesis (ch.\r\nxxxviii, verses 9, 10), congressus interruptus, where, however, the\r\npractice was punished by death, “And Onan knew that the seed should not\r\nbe his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife,\r\nthat he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his\r\nbrother. And the thing which he did displeased the Lord, wherefore he\r\nslew him.” This mode of preventing pregnancy, in which the membrum\r\nvirile is completely withdrawn from the vagina before the ejaculation of\r\nthe semen takes place, is at the present time a very widely diffused\r\npractice; and, when properly carried out, it is thoroughly efficacious\r\nin the production of sterility. _Thompson_ relates that this practice is\r\nemployed by the Massai youths, who are allowed free intercourse with the\r\ngirls, but if a girl becomes pregnant she is put to death.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged practice of coitus interruptus leads in my experience—in\r\naddition to the injury to the nervous system as a whole in consequence\r\nof the intense hyperæmia of the uterus and the uterine annexa,\r\nunrelieved by the occurrence of the orgasm—to a condition of stasis in\r\nthe female reproductive organs; and this ultimately passes on into\r\nchronic metritis (with relaxation of the uterus, retroflexion or\r\nanteflexion, catarrhal disease of the mucous membrane, erosions, and\r\nfollicular ulceration of the portio vaginalis), oöphoritis and\r\nperimetritis. As a result of certain remarkable observations, I must\r\neven regard it as not improbable, although actual proof is still\r\nlacking, that the recent striking increase in the frequency of\r\nneoplasmata of the female reproductive organs is causally dependent on\r\nthe ever-increasing employment in all circles of society of means for\r\nthe prevention of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe evil effects of coitus interruptus for a woman are dependent on the\r\nfact that the woman fails to obtain complete sexual gratification, and\r\nthat this has an important influence upon her entire organism. Owing to\r\nthe failure of ejaculation to occur, the blood, which during the stage\r\nof sexual excitement has accumulated in the erectile structures and\r\ncavernous spaces of the genital passage, does not, as in normal\r\nconditions, flow rapidly away; but the congestion persists for an\r\nindefinite period, and is said by _von Krafft-Ebing_ to give rise to\r\nfunctional disorders, and also to serious tissue changes. The functional\r\ndisorders take the form of hyperæmia of the pelvic organs, and probably\r\nalso of the lumbar portion of the spinal cord (dull pain in the sacral\r\nregion, a sensation of pain and dragging in the pelvis and in the lower\r\nextremities, lassitude); these symptoms often continue for several hours\r\nafter intercourse. If this ungratifying coitus is frequently repeated,\r\nin a voluptuous woman, disorders of the reproductive organs ensue; and\r\neven more frequently, nervous disorders, in the form of neurasthenia\r\nsexualis. This author considers that, more especially in women, coitus\r\ninterruptus, and unphysiological modes of sexual intercourse in general,\r\nare extremely potent causes of sexual neurasthenia—as potent as\r\nmasturbation.\r\n\r\n_Beard_, in his work on sexual neurasthenia, maintains that the sudden\r\ninterruption of coitus (and also the use of condoms and similar\r\nappliances) is not only far more deleterious than unduly frequent normal\r\nintercourse; but he points out that it is necessary also to take into\r\naccount the fact that (inasmuch as, owing to the unnatural mode of\r\nsexual intercourse, the possibility of fertilization is almost\r\ncompletely prevented) sexual intercourse is apt, in such cases, to be\r\nindulged in far more frequently, and often to gross excess. More\r\nparticularly in such circumstances are evil effects on the nervous\r\nsystem likely to ensue, since we have a combination of excessively\r\nprolonged and frequent sexual intercourse, and of interference with\r\ncomplete sexual gratification.\r\n\r\n_Mantegazza_ believes that organic diseases of the spinal cord may\r\nactually result from congressus interruptus.\r\n\r\n_Hirt_ considers that even when marital intercourse is carefully\r\nregulated in respect of frequency, congressus interruptus may lead to\r\nneurasthenic manifestations.\r\n\r\n_Von Hösslin_ believes it to be indisputable that preventive methods of\r\nsexual intercourse may cause nervous troubles, and more particularly\r\nneurasthenic disorders, manifesting themselves chiefly in the sphere of\r\nthe reproductive organs.\r\n\r\n_Eulenburg_ also declares that coitus interruptus is already a frequent\r\ncause of sexual neurasthenia in women, and that its evil influence in\r\nthis respect is becoming more and more frequently manifest. He publishes\r\ntwo typical cases, in which, from this cause, in the one case,\r\nfunctional neuropathy, and in the other, local disorder of the\r\nreproductive organs, ensued.\r\n\r\n_Freud_ describes an “anxiety-neurosis,” which is due to incomplete\r\ngratification of the woman during sexual intercourse. Coitus interruptus\r\nis almost invariably harmful to the man; to the woman it is harmful if\r\nthe man thinks only of himself, and interrupts the coitus as soon as\r\nejaculation is imminent, without concerning himself about the woman’s\r\nstate of sexual excitement. If, on the other hand, the man waits until\r\nthe woman’s sexual gratification is complete, the significance of such\r\nan interrupted coitus as far as the woman is concerned is that of normal\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nIsolated authorities, as for instance _Stille_ and _Thompson_, have\r\ncontested the alleged evil consequences of preventive methods of sexual\r\nintercourse. “It is habitual excess,” says _Fürbringer_, “which does the\r\nmischief, not the unnatural character of the isolated act.” _Löwenfeld_,\r\nwho considers the opposition of medical men to “Malthusianism” not\r\nwholly justified, and believes that the dangers to health “which occur\r\nin isolated cases” are not very serious, maintains none the less that\r\nthe medical man must advise his patients not to practise coitus\r\ninterruptus. The mode in which conception is prevented is not, he\r\nthinks, a matter of indifference to the woman. The use of occlusive\r\npessaries and similar appliances does not in any way interfere with the\r\nnormal development of sexual gratification and cannot, therefore, have\r\nany direct influence in the production of nervous disturbances. A\r\nforgotten occlusive pessary, however, has in many cases caused local\r\ndisorder in the vagina. When the man is fully potent the use of condoms\r\ncan do no harm to the woman, since the only effect of the condom (in a\r\nvery excitable woman) is to render the development of the orgasm a\r\nlittle more difficult, but not to prevent it. Congressus interruptus\r\nitself is, according to _Löwenfeld_, harmful to the woman only when,\r\nowing to deficient potency in the male or to deficient excitability in\r\nthe female, the interruption takes place before the occurrence of the\r\norgasm.\r\n\r\n_Valenta_ declared that coitus interruptus was one of the chief causes\r\nof chronic metritis. _Elischer_ saw perimetritis result from this\r\npractice; _Gräfe_ enumerates, as consequences of frequently repeated\r\ncoitus interruptus, chronic hyperæmia of the uterus and oöphoritis;\r\n_Goodell_ observed elongation of the cervix uteri; _Mensinga_,\r\ninfarction of the uterus, œdema of the portio vaginalis, ulceration of\r\nthe cervix, hysterical paroxysms, convulsions, cephalalgias,\r\ncardialgias, etc. _Lier_ reports a case in which, after three years’\r\ncontinued practice of coitus interruptus, the menopause set in, with\r\natrophy of the uterus; _Ascher_, in a similar case, saw chronic metritis\r\nensue. According to _Kleinwächter_, coitus interruptus is harmful to the\r\nwoman to an extent by no means trifling, whereas the man, in whom\r\nejaculation occurs, suffers comparatively little. _Fehling_ believes\r\nthat when coitus interruptus is practised only a small proportion of\r\nwomen experience sexual excitement. _Neugebauer_ states that among the\r\nvery numerous cases of uterine carcinoma he has treated, the majority of\r\nthe patients admitted having practised coitus interruptus. _Pigeolot_\r\nmakes a similar statement.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be admitted that a certain number of medical men\r\nabsolutely deny the dangers of coitus interruptus, whilst others\r\nconsider them altogether trifling. Just as the trend of modern opinion\r\nis to believe that in normal men and women the dangers of masturbation\r\nare far less serious than was formerly maintained, so also many are now\r\nfound to maintain that coitus interruptus is harmful only to those with\r\nhereditary neuropathic predisposition. Still more unwilling are many to\r\nadmit that other preventive methods do women any harm. Thus _Wille_\r\nmaintains that the continued fear of pregnancy will in most instances do\r\nmore injury to the feminine nervous system than all the preventive\r\nmeasures in the world. To the nervously weak woman a trustworthy\r\npreventive of pregnancy is therefore often necessary and most helpful.\r\n\r\nAn artificial method for the prevention of the ejaculation of semen was\r\ncommunicated to me by a celebrated anatomist. It is practised in\r\nTransylvania and in France. During intercourse the woman, just before\r\nthe male ejaculation begins, presses forcibly with her finger on the\r\nbase of the erect penis just in front of the prostate; the urethra is\r\noccluded by this digital compression, the semen regurgitates into the\r\nbladder and is subsequently evacuated with the urine.\r\n\r\nThis practice may be compared with the mechanical expulsion of the semen\r\nfrom the female genital passage immediately after coitus. _Tairi_\r\nreports that women of the poorer classes in Italy sit upright in bed\r\nimmediately after intercourse, and by coughing, in conjunction with\r\npressure on the abdomen, effect the expulsion of the semen. _Morton_\r\ninforms us that the native women of Northern Australia, when they have\r\nhad intercourse with a white man and wish to avoid impregnation,\r\nlikewise deliberately effect the outflow of the semen _post actum_. The\r\nwoman squats upright, with the legs widely separated, and by a sinuous\r\nmovement of the perineum and a simultaneous powerful bearing-down\r\npressure she expels the semen on to the ground.\r\n\r\nAnother way in which the attempt is made to avoid impregnation is by the\r\nuse of vaginal injections; a fluid lethal to the spermatozoa being used\r\nfor this purpose immediately after coitus. Douches of cold water, ½ to\r\n1% solution of copper sulphate, 1% solution of alum, ¼% solution of\r\nsulphate of quinine, are the fluids most commonly employed; but all\r\nthese are quite untrustworthy, for it is impossible to be sure that all\r\nthe spermatozoa will be acted on and destroyed. _Allbutt_, who as\r\nmedical secretary of the Malthusian League in London has unquestionably\r\nhad a very wide experience, agrees with _Haussmann_ in denying that the\r\nwidely advocated cold water douche can be relied on for the prevention\r\nof pregnancy. The sudden driving of the blood out of the vessels of the\r\ngenital passage at the very moment when they are intensely congested,\r\nwhich must inevitably result from a cold douche, is, moreover, likely to\r\ngive rise to metritis, perimetritis and oöphoritis.\r\n\r\nMore trustworthy are the various apparatus, the aim of which is to\r\nprevent the contact of the semen with the ova by the interposition of an\r\nartificial wall. Although even as regards these we must bear in mind the\r\nobservation of _Lott_, who found that spermatozoa were capable of\r\npassing through the intact membrane in favourable regions in as short a\r\ntime as ten minutes. The commonest of all these apparatus is the article\r\nknown as a condom, which envelops the penis with a membrane, variously\r\nconsisting of isinglass, the lamb’s cæcum, or caoutchouc. Condoms, if\r\nmade of suitable material, and if carefully used, are the most\r\ntrustworthy of all preventives. Moreover, the injury caused by their use\r\nto the woman’s health is trifling, for they do no more than diminish to\r\na degree the intensity of the stimulus, thus necessitating a somewhat\r\nlonger duration of its action in order to effect the most intense\r\norgasm, and thus to induce the natural physiological termination of the\r\nnervous excitement. In fact, though somewhat delayed, the normal\r\nreaction takes place in the reproductive organs. The evil effect of the\r\nuse of the condom bears no comparison with that of coitus interruptus.\r\nThere is, however, some justification for _Ricord’s_ well-known epigram,\r\nthat the condom is “a spider’s web for the prevention of danger, and a\r\ncuirass for the prevention of voluptuous pleasure.”\r\n\r\nWhen the gynecologist, from well-considered reasons based on some\r\npathological condition affecting his patient, feels justified in\r\nrecommending the prevention of pregnancy, it is my opinion that the most\r\ntrustworthy and least harmful measure at present available, and one\r\npreferable to all other mechanical apparatus, is a carefully selected\r\nand well-made condom.\r\n\r\nThe condom was already in use in Italy in the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, in the form of a linen investment adapted to the shape of the\r\npenis; subsequently, according to _Grünfeld_, condoms were made from the\r\ncæcum of the lamb; while later still, isinglass was employed for this\r\npurpose. According to _Hans Ferdy_, the cæcal condom is made from the\r\nconnective-tissue layer of the cæcum of the sheep or of the calf (a very\r\nyoung animal); to a less extent, also, the cæca of the goat, the stag,\r\nand the roe-deer, are employed for this purpose. The different varieties\r\nof cæcal condom are distinguished chiefly by variations in the thickness\r\nand the softness of the membrane. _Ferdy_ states that the four best\r\nkinds are made from the cæcum of the sheep; these have a thickness: I.\r\n0.008 to 0.01 mm. (0.00032 to 0.0004 in.); II. 0.012 to 0.015 mm.\r\n(0.00048 to 0.0006 in.); III. 0.017 to 0.023 mm. (0.00068 to 0.00092\r\nin.); IV. 0.025 to 0.03 mm. (0.001 to 0.0012 in.) Next in quality come\r\nfour varieties obtained from the calf, varying in thickness from 0.015\r\nto 0.04 mm. (0.006 to 0.016 in.) Finally we have three varieties\r\nobtained from the three other animals already mentioned. Thus there are\r\nin all eleven varieties of cæcal condom, and in so far as during the\r\nprocess of manufacture the membrane has remained free from any injury,\r\nthey are sold as “undamaged.” But if in the process of preparation a\r\nhole has been made in the membrane, this aperture is closed by sticking\r\non a small patch of membrane. Such patched condoms are naturally quite\r\nuseless, since the patch is readily loosened by the moisture to which it\r\nis exposed, and falls off, when the protective and preventive functions\r\nare entirely destroyed; nevertheless, such defective condoms are often\r\nsold. Rubber condoms, continues _Ferdy_, are prepared from a caoutchouc\r\nmembrane 0.03 to 0.1 mm. (0.0012 to 0.04 in.) in thickness; but these,\r\nhe says, are not hygienic, for “such a rubber membrane, which both in\r\nthe man and in the woman completely covers the erogenic zones normally\r\nstimulated in coitus, deadens the necessary stimulation, so that the\r\nsensations during coitus are seriously dulled by the interposition of\r\nthis foreign body; by nervously predisposed individuals, this kind of\r\ncondom cannot be used regularly for a long period, without rendering\r\nprobable the onset of serious functional disturbances of the genital\r\napparatus.” This opinion appears to me to be unfounded. We must also\r\nmention the “glans-condom,” made of rubber membrane, which serves to\r\ncover the glans penis only during coitus, and to retain the seminal\r\nsecretion; its grave defect, however, consists in this, that in the act\r\nof withdrawing the penis, the condom is very likely to be peeled off,\r\nwhen the semen will, after all, pass into the vagina.\r\n\r\nPassing now to the consideration of apparatus which are inserted into\r\nthe woman’s genital canal, in order to prevent impregnation, we may\r\nfirst mention sponges, which have long been in use; after thorough\r\ncleaning, these may be rendered aseptic by immersion in carbolic acid or\r\nlysol solution. These sponges should be very soft; they are cut into\r\nballs of 3 to 7 cm. (1.2 to 2.8 in.) in diameter; before coitus they are\r\nintroduced into the vagina and after coitus they are withdrawn by means\r\nof the tape which should always be attached to them. This method is,\r\nhowever, quite untrustworthy, for the sponge offers no impermeable wall\r\nto the passage of the spermatozoa, and on its withdrawal, some of the\r\nsemen may very likely be left in the vagina. The same objection must be\r\nmade to the similarly constructed anti-conceptional cotton-wool plugs;\r\nsometimes these are moistened with a fluid intended to destroy the\r\nspermatozoa. Recently _Gunzburg_ has recommended the introduction into\r\nthe vagina of a cotton-wool plug moistened with a three per cent.\r\nsolution of carbolic acid in glycerine; he considers this method safe,\r\nbecause the spermatozoa are immediately destroyed on contact with the\r\nweakest carbolic acid solutions.\r\n\r\nTo destroy the vitality of the spermatozoa, vaginal suppositories made\r\nof cocoa-butter medicated with hydrochlorate of quinine have also been\r\nemployed; these, the so-called “security-pessaries” or “security-ovals,”\r\nare inserted into the vagina half an hour before coitus; the\r\ncocoa-butter is melted by the body heat, and the vaginal mucous membrane\r\nand the os uteri are covered with the medicated fatty material, by which\r\nthe spermatozoa are (or should be) destroyed. This method is one easy to\r\nemploy, but it is extremely uncertain.\r\n\r\nEven more uncertain are the insufflators charged with various powders\r\n(boric acid, citric acid, thymol, etc.); the tube of the insufflator\r\nhaving been passed into the vagina, the powder is blown over the vaginal\r\nmucous membrane and the portio vaginalis. This procedure may sometimes\r\nbe followed by symptoms of intoxication; and in any case, owing to the\r\ndesiccative effect which the powder has upon the vaginal mucous\r\nmembrane, it exercises a disturbing influence on coitus.\r\n\r\n_Kleinwächter_, in cases in which pregnancy must be prevented in the\r\ninterest of a woman’s health or her life, has recommended the\r\nintroduction into the vagina of globules of which the active constituent\r\nis boric acid.\r\n\r\nA rationally constructed apparatus, and one which in general appears to\r\nfulfil its purpose very well, is the _pessarium occlusivum_ constructed\r\nby _Mensinga_, and now manufactured in various modifications. The\r\nocclusive pessary is a hollowed hemisphere of rubber membrane, around\r\nthe margin of which passes a steel ring. The size of the pessary must be\r\nadapted to the individual case. It is introduced into the vagina in such\r\na way that the outer surface of the hemisphere occupies the vaginal\r\nfornix, while the steel ring touches the vaginal wall all round; by this\r\nmeans, the vaginal fornices and the os uteri are completely shut off\r\nfrom the lower part of the vagina. The disadvantage of this instrument\r\nis, that either the woman must wear it continuously, which involves\r\nnumerous inconveniences, or else it must be introduced by the skilled\r\nhand immediately before coitus—and not every woman becomes competent to\r\nadjust it herself, even after careful explanation, since the pessary\r\nmust be accurately placed with the anterior margin of the ring\r\nimmediately behind the pubic symphysis, and the posterior margin of the\r\nring behind the os uteri. Moreover, the instrument may easily be\r\ndisplaced by violent movements, coughing, sneezing, etc. In any case,\r\nthe pessary must be carefully selected to correspond within the\r\nconfiguration of the vagina, as otherwise it may exercise a deleterious\r\npressure upon the vaginal walls, and may give rise to other bad\r\nconsequences, such as are apt to attend the wearing of any pessary for a\r\nprolonged period—excoriations, erosions, fluor albus, etc. In the\r\nmajority of cases it will be found that the woman herself is not\r\ncompetent to introduce the occlusive pessary. The skilled hand is needed\r\nfor the proper adjustment of the surrounding ring.\r\n\r\n_Gall’s balloon-occlusive-pessary_ consists of a soft elastic rubber\r\ndisc, surrounded by a thin-walled rubber ring, the interior of which is\r\nconnected by means of a fine tube with an inflating rubber ball. The\r\nwoman can herself insert the instrument and inflate the ring; it\r\noccludes the vaginal passage without exercising any deleterious\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nOther pessaries consist of hollow rubber balls containing some fluid\r\nlethal to the spermatozoa, which can be discharged into the vagina on\r\nopening a valve by pulling a string. These, however, are as insecure as\r\nthe above-mentioned vaginal discs and the insufflators. The\r\nduplex-occlusive-pessary has the form of a truncated cone with double\r\nwalls; in its base are a number of rounded apertures, and a single\r\nelongated aperture; through this latter a boric acid tablet is\r\nintroduced into the cavity of the cone. By means of the cone the passage\r\nto the uterus is mechanically occluded; the semen passes through the\r\napertures in the base into the interior of the instrument, and as the\r\nboric acid tablet is dissolved by the moisture to which it is now\r\nexposed, the vitality of the spermatozoa is destroyed. The management of\r\nthis apparatus is, however, not easily effected by the woman herself.\r\nThe “Matrisalus-Pessary” differs but little from other occlusive\r\npessaries. The latest instrument for the prevention of impregnation is\r\nknown as the “Venus-Apparatus;” it consists of a syringe with two balls,\r\na large and a small one, at either end of a rubber tube; by pressure on\r\nthe larger ball, and subsequent relaxation of pressure, the smaller ball\r\nis filled with a fluid for the destruction of the spermatozoa (prepared\r\nby the solution of one of the “Venus-powders” sold with the instrument);\r\nwhen filled, this smaller ball is introduced into the vagina and remains\r\nconnected by means of the tube with the larger ball, which lies between\r\nthe woman’s thighs. At the moment of the male ejaculation the woman\r\npresses on this ball, and by this means the fluid filling the smaller\r\nball is expressed into her vagina.\r\n\r\nAll these mechanical occlusive pessaries are open to the objection that\r\nthey are apt to give rise to irritative conditions of the genital\r\norgans, causing offensive discharges, pruritus, etc. (Recently in order\r\nto diminish this drawback, the pessary has been constructed of\r\nvulcanized cambric, instead of rubber, and appears then to have a less\r\nirritating effect.) Still worse is the injury to the uterus and to the\r\ncervical mucous membrane caused by certain intra-uterine instruments\r\nwhich have been recommended for the prevention of conception. The latest\r\nof these is an “obturator,” consisting of a silver or silver-gilt tube,\r\nwhich is passed through the os uteri into the interior of the uterus,\r\nand left _in situ_. It is claimed for it that “it allows the menstrual\r\ndischarge to flow freely away, but renders the entrance of the\r\nspermatozoa extremely difficult.” _Biermer_ reports five cases in which\r\nserious injury to health followed the use of one of these obturators. In\r\none of these cases in which there were very severe pains and a discharge\r\nfrom the uterus, _Biermer_ removed from the interior of the uterus a\r\nbroken wing of the obturator; the patient died, however, and the autopsy\r\ndisclosed perforation of the uterus. In another of the cases the\r\napparatus was also broken.\r\n\r\nLess dangerous is the recently invented tampon-speculum. This is passed\r\ninto the vagina by the woman herself, in order that through it she may,\r\nby means of a special introducer, insert a tablet of boric acid,\r\nhydrochlorate of quinine, citric acid, or some other substance lethal to\r\nthe spermatozoa. Without some such instrument, the introduction of these\r\n“ovals” to the proper place is often found difficult by women.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable means of bringing about artificial sterility, one\r\nresembling the operative procedures sometimes adopted in western\r\ncountries, is employed in various parts of the world, and notably in the\r\nEast Indies and in the Sunda Islands, namely, the induction of an\r\nartificial malposition of the uterus, more especially of anteversion.\r\nThus, _van der Burg_ writes from the Dutch Indies: “In the girls the\r\nsexual impulse develops very early, and is gratified without fear of\r\nconsequences, when the services of certain skilled elderly women have\r\nbeen requisitioned.” These women appear, in fact, to understand, by\r\nmeans of pressure, rubbing, and kneading, through the abdominal walls\r\n(not by the vaginal route), how to induce anteversion or retroversion of\r\nthe uterus, to such an extent as to prevent the occurrence of\r\nconception. It is said that the only inconvenient consequences of this\r\nprocedure are trifling pains in the lumbo-sacral and inguinal regions,\r\nand some trouble in passing water during the first few days after the\r\nmanipulations have been effected. Later, when a girl who has been\r\ntreated in this way wishes to marry and become a mother, by a reversal\r\nof the manipulations the uterus is restored to its natural position. It\r\nis said that these skilled women have been called in by European women\r\nin the Dutch Indies, who did not wish to have many children; but it\r\nappears that in a woman who has once given birth to a child, the result\r\nof the manipulations is less to be depended upon, than in the case of a\r\nvirgin.\r\n\r\nA means of ensuring artificial sterility, which in all civilized states\r\nis punishable as a criminal offence, and which is nevertheless very\r\nfrequently practised, is the artificial induction of abortion.\r\nEspecially in North America it would appear that there exist regular\r\nprofessional abortionists. In this connection, _Thomas_, the well-known\r\nAmerican gynecologist, writes as follows: “Statistics showing the\r\nfrequency of criminal abortion are not, and probably never will be,\r\navailable, for this crime cannot be adequately controlled by human\r\nsociety, and commonly eludes legal punishment. It seems a hard saying,\r\nbut it is a true one, to assert, that the law pursues unremittingly him\r\nwho has killed his fellow-man, while it leaves immune him who has killed\r\nthe embryo in the mother’s womb. On my table there lies at this moment\r\none of the most widely circulated, most respected, and most carefully\r\nedited daily newspapers of New York—a paper which finds its way into the\r\nbest circles of society, and also into the hands of girls and women\r\nthroughout the country. In its columns I find fifteen advertisements\r\nwhich emanate beyond all question from professional abortionists—from\r\nmen and women who gain their livelihood by child-murder.”\r\n\r\n_O. Reyher_ remarks also that in American newspapers advertisements such\r\nas the following are of every-day occurrence: “Pills for the regulation\r\nof the periods. Ladies expecting to be confined are warned not to use\r\nthem on any account, for if they do so abortion will infallibly ensue.”\r\n\r\n_Emmet_, in his “Textbook of Gynecology” also complains of the terrible\r\nfrequency of criminal abortion, so that “every day we see more\r\nunhappiness and misery result from the misuse of conjugal relationships\r\nthan we see in an entire month as a result of births which take place in\r\na natural manner.”\r\n\r\n_Pomeroy_ also says that “The prevention of conception and the\r\ndestruction of the unborn life are pre-eminently American sins;” and he\r\nadds that if no bounds are set to their spread, “they must, sooner or\r\nlater, lead to universal misfortune. In the course of our practices we\r\ncome into contact with women who would hesitate to kill a fly, but who\r\nthink nothing of having destroyed half a dozen or more of their own\r\nunborn children.”\r\n\r\nThe American Medical Congress offered a prize for a brief and readable\r\nessay, suitable for diffusion among women, showing the criminality and\r\nthe physical harmfulness of artificial abortion. The prize was awarded\r\nto _Storer’s_ essay, entitled “Why Not?”\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient Greeks, the fear of over-population led to the\r\npractice of homosexual intercourse. The states of ancient Greece were in\r\nmost cases of a very small area, so that a very moderate increase in\r\npopulation would render the means of subsistence insufficient. Hence\r\nintercourse with women was avoided, and the sexual impulse was gratified\r\nin unnatural ways. Inspired by this fear of over-population, Aristotle\r\nurged upon men that they avoid women, and should indulge in the love of\r\nmen and boys, and at an earlier date, Socrates had celebrated the love\r\nof boys as a mark of higher culture. The most notable men of classical\r\nGreece practised homosexual intercourse; authors and poets celebrated\r\nthe love of boys. Stimulated by their example, Sappho of Lesbos became\r\nthe inspired poetess of the love of women for members of their own sex\r\n(Lesbian love).\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans it was rather satiety in consequence of sexual excesses\r\nwhich led in that country to the diffusion of the Greek love of boys;\r\nthe consequent childlessness diminished to such an extent the numbers of\r\nthe Roman burghers and patricians, that Augustus, in the year 16 B. C.,\r\nenacted the Julian law, by which the procreation of children was\r\nrewarded, whilst celibacy became a punishable offence.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the fear of an excessively large number of children,\r\nin relation to the property possessed by the parents and in regard to\r\nnutritive possibilities, has led among whole classes, and even among\r\nentire nations, to the adoption of preventive measures in sexual\r\nintercourse; these measures have, in fact, been developed into a system,\r\nwhich finds adherents among all strata of the population, but more\r\nespecially, as it is easy to understand, among certain well-to-do\r\nsections of the community. In France this system has been adopted to\r\nsuch an extent as to amount to a national calamity.\r\n\r\nIn few countries of the civilized world, remarks _Bebel_, are marriages\r\nso frequent, relatively to the population, as they are in France, whilst\r\nin no country is the average number of children per marriage so small,\r\nor the increase of population so slow. The French bourgeoisie long ago\r\nadopted this system, and the peasantry and the artizan classes are\r\nfollowing their example. In many parts of Germany the same causes have\r\nled to the same results. In France, in addition to the prevention of\r\npregnancy and the practice of artificial abortion, infanticide and the\r\nexposure of children are also actually employed to keep down the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nOperative measures for the production of artificial sterility have been\r\npractised from very ancient times, and by civilized and savage peoples\r\nalike. According to _Strabo_, the ancient Egyptians and Lydians were\r\nacquainted with the art of removing the ovaries from girls and women.\r\nThe kings of Lydia, Andromytes and Gyges, had the women of their harems\r\ncastrated, _ut iis semper ætate et forma florentibus uteretur_. _Von\r\nMicklucho-Mackay_ reports that in some parts of Australia the indigens\r\nremove the ovaries of certain girls, in order to provide their young men\r\nwith hetairæ who cannot possibly become pregnant. _M. Gillirray_ saw at\r\nCape York a native deaf and dumb woman whose ovaries had been removed,\r\nto prevent her procreating deaf and dumb infants.\r\n\r\nWe cannot refrain from reference to the astounding proposal of _C. A.\r\nWeinhold_, contained in his work upon the over-population of Central\r\nEurope and its consequences to the countries concerned and to\r\ncivilization in general. He advises, “as a general and urgently required\r\nmeasure, the widespread practice of a sort of infibulation, which is to\r\nbe undertaken at the age of fourteen and preserved until marriage, and\r\nis to be performed in the case of all those individuals who can be\r\nproved not to possess sufficient property for the upbringing of an\r\ninfant, if they should become pregnant as a result of extra-conjugal\r\nintercourse. And in those who never attained a financial position in\r\nwhich they might be able to bring up a family, the infibulated condition\r\nshould be allowed to persist throughout life!”\r\n\r\nThis proposal is, in fact, no novelty, inasmuch as the bringing about of\r\nan artificial adhesion of the labia with a view to the prevention of\r\nconception—the operation of _infibulation_—is practised by many savage\r\npeoples. According to the detailed account given by _Ploss-Bartels_,\r\nthis operation, in which the inner surfaces of the labia majora are\r\nfreshened, stitched together, and allowed to adhere, is practised by the\r\nBedschas, the Gallas, the Somalis, the inhabitants of Harrar, at\r\nMassaua, etc. The purpose of this practice is to preserve the chastity\r\nof the girls until marriage, when the reverse operative procedure is\r\nundertaken. If the husband goes away on a journey, in many cases the\r\noperation of infibulation is once more performed upon his wives.\r\nSlave-dealers also make use of this operation so as to prevent their\r\nslaves from becoming pregnant. It is reported, however, that the\r\noperation does not invariably produce the desired effect. _Hartmann_\r\ninforms us that in Nubia, in Senaar, and in part of Kordofan, the\r\npræputium clitoridis or the entire clitoris is cut away, and the margins\r\nof the nymphæ are then freshened and stitched together, so that the only\r\naperture left is one sufficiently large for the outflow of the urine.\r\n\r\n_Brehm_ states that the operation is performed by old women, who make\r\nthe necessary incisions with razors; shortly before marriage, the\r\nbridegroom sends the girl’s relatives a model of his penis, carved in\r\nwood, according to the size of which an aperture is made between the\r\nadherent nymphæ; when the woman becomes pregnant, the incision is still\r\nfurther enlarged. In the kingdom of Darfur, the labia majora as well as\r\nthe nymphæ are freshened and stitched together. In the Berber country,\r\n_Werne_ became acquainted with a young widow whose husband had had her\r\nsubmitted to the operation of infibulation no less than seven times.\r\nAnother somewhat less brutal method of performing infibulation is\r\ndescribed by _Ploss_, as being practised by many Eastern races; a ring\r\nis fastened through the labia in such a way as to guard the introitus\r\nvaginæ In Europe, during the Middle Ages, such and similar apparatus\r\n(“girdles of chastity”) are said to have been employed for the\r\nprotection of the honour of an absent husband.\r\n\r\nOf gynecologists who have advised operative measures for the prevention\r\nof pregnancy, in women in whom that condition involved serious dangers,\r\nthe first, as far as I know, was _Blundell_. As a result of experiments\r\nmade on rabbits, he suggested division of the Fallopian tubes as the\r\nbest way of attaining this end. Later, _Froriep_ and _Kocks_ also\r\nendeavoured to induce artificial sterility in women by occlusion of the\r\nFallopian tubes. _Froriep’s_ idea was to bring about obliteration of the\r\nlumen of the tubes by means of cauterization with nitrate of silver;\r\n_Kocks_ constructed for the same purpose a galvano-caustic uterine\r\nsound. But, in the first place, both the methods advocated are too\r\nuncertain to be relied upon; and, in the second place, their application\r\nis neither easy, nor devoid of serious risk.\r\n\r\nMuch more effective, however, is the method recommended by _Kehrer_ for\r\nthe sterilization of women, namely, division of the Fallopian tubes by\r\nthe vaginal route. _Kehrer_ considers that the physician is justified in\r\npreventing the occurrence of pregnancy in a number of morbid\r\nconditions—incurable nervous, cardiac, pulmonary, gastric, and renal\r\ndisorders; various constitutional affections; and, finally, in cases of\r\npelvic deformity of such a degree that the delivery of a living child is\r\nimpossible except by means of Cæsarean section, but the patient does not\r\nwish to be exposed to the risks of this operation. He believes,\r\nmoreover, that all the methods commonly recommended for the prevention\r\nof pregnancy are untrustworthy. So powerful, however, is the sexual\r\nimpulse, that, as experience shows, the mere prohibition of sexual\r\nintercourse, however earnestly made, invariably proves ineffectual. For\r\ncoitus interruptus to be effective, the interruption must occur at the\r\nright moment; and this does not always take place. Cold water douches\r\nafter coitus are unhygienic; douches of warm water, medicated with\r\nsublimate, alcohol, and other drugs lethal to the spermatozoa, are\r\nindeed rationally conceived, but often fail of their effect, either\r\nbecause they are deferred until too late, or else because they fail to\r\nirrigate all parts of the vagina. Plugs of cotton wool, sponges, etc.,\r\nare not always introduced in such a way as effectually to occlude the\r\nvaginal passage. A suitable and properly introduced occlusive pessary\r\nis, indeed, a relatively trustworthy preventive apparatus, but if worn\r\ncontinuously it is apt to become very foul. A thorough douching of the\r\ngenital passage with an antiseptic solution, performed by the skilled\r\nhand, immediately after coitus, would doubtless destroy the spermatozoa\r\nwith the like certainty with which the same procedure destroys\r\nmicro-organisms when performed prior to a gynecological operation—but\r\nwhen carried out by the layman, the value of the method is more than\r\ndoubtful. The operation, for a time actually fashionable, of extirpation\r\nof the uterine annexa, certainly gives rise to sterility, but entails\r\nthe serious disadvantage that the consequent premature menopause is\r\nattended by the same disturbances as the natural change of life. On the\r\nother hand, section and ligature of the Fallopian tubes is considered by\r\n_Kehrer_ to induce sterility without in any other way disturbing the\r\nfunctions of the female reproductive organs. By means of anterior\r\ncolpotomy we obtain a suitable route for the ligature and section of\r\nboth tubes at the isthmi. When carried out with the proper antiseptic\r\nprecautions the operation is almost entirely free from risk; and when\r\nthe organs are healthy the closure of both the upper and the lower\r\nsegments of the tubes is effected, and no retention of secretions need\r\nbe feared as a result of the operation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the indications for the performance of this operation,\r\n_Kehrer_ insists that it should be undertaken only in cases of serious\r\ndisease, and when the pros and cons have been conscientiously weighed. A\r\nconsultation is also indispensable. Moreover, it is essential that\r\nhusband and wife should both fully understand the nature of the proposed\r\noperation, and should form an unbiassed judgment regarding its\r\nadvisability. To avoid any possibility of subsequent reproaches,\r\n_Kehrer_ advises that a written report should be drawn up, giving the\r\nreasons for undertaking the sterilization, and that this should be\r\nsubscribed by the physicians in consultation, by the patient herself,\r\nand by her husband.\r\n\r\n_Arndt_ considers that in cases in which there already exists serious\r\nconstitutional disease, the performance of this operation may lead to\r\nfever, severe hæmorrhage, injury to adjacent organs, and even death. He\r\nholds, therefore, that in such cases the physician should advise the use\r\nof some of the more ordinary methods of preventing conception (if simple\r\nabstinence from intercourse cannot be practised). Only in women with\r\npelvic contraction of the second or third degree, in whom previous\r\nchildren have been still-born, or subjected to craniotomy, is operative\r\nsterilization by _Kehrer’s_ method justifiable. But in preference to\r\nanterior colpotomy, as recommended by _Kehrer_, he prefers the\r\nlongitudinal incision in the posterior vaginal fornix advised by\r\n_Boileux_. If the uterus is drawn down firmly, and the portio vaginalis\r\nthen pushed forward against the pubic symphysis, it is easy, at any rate\r\nwith the assistance of a little abdominal pressure, to draw part of the\r\nFallopian tubes into the vaginal incision.\r\n\r\nRecently _Pincus_ has recommended the cauterization of the uterine\r\ncavity with superheated steam (_atmocausis_, _castratio uterina_). He\r\nadvises it only in women who are incurably ill (tuberculosis, morbus\r\nBrightii, hæmophilia), so that pregnancy and parturition would involve\r\nalmost certain death.\r\n\r\n_Kossmann_ considers that when pregnancy and parturition will endanger a\r\nwoman’s health and life, it is the physician’s duty to acquaint both\r\nhusband and wife with this fact; but having done so his duty is fully\r\ndischarged. “If, after being warned, the married pair choose to indulge\r\nin sexual intercourse, they have knowingly and voluntarily run into\r\ndanger, and for this the physician is in no way responsible.”\r\n\r\nAs indications for facultative sterility _Levy_ enumerates tubercular\r\ndisease of the lungs, mental disorders, severe organic or functional\r\ndiseases of the central nervous system, active syphilis (in certain\r\ncircumstances), pernicious anæmia, hæmophilia, diabetes mellitus, severe\r\nheart disease, chronic disease of the kidneys or liver, certain pelvic\r\ndeformities, and the tendency to habitual abortion.\r\n\r\nI have myself before now stated my opinion that it is the duty of the\r\nphysician, in the case of a married woman suffering from heart disease,\r\nwith due regard to the danger which pregnancy will entail upon her, to\r\ngive needful advice in the matter of the prevention of conception. In\r\nwomen affected with valvular heart disease, and in whom there are\r\nserious disturbances of compensation, conception is absolutely to be\r\navoided; also in conditions of marked cardiac degeneration, and when\r\nthere are distinct symptoms of insufficiency of the heart muscle. When,\r\non slight exertion, palpitation, increased frequency of the pulse, and\r\nrespiratory need (“air-hunger”), ensue; when there is extensive œdema of\r\nthe lower extremities which persists even after confinement to bed; when\r\nthe pulse readily becomes arhythmical both in respect of the strength\r\nand the temporal succession of the beats; when the urine is scanty and\r\ncontains varying quantities of albumen; when there are frequent attacks\r\nof heart-weakness, with a small irregular pulse, coldness of the\r\nextremities, a cyanotic tint of complexion, nausea, dyspnœa, sense of\r\nfaintness, or actual syncope—in all such cases, whether dependent upon\r\nvalvular disease, on pathological changes in the arteries, or upon\r\ndisease of the myocardium, the occurrence of pregnancy is a true\r\ndisaster, giving rise in most cases to a grave aggravation of the heart\r\ntrouble and often enough costing the patient her life. I further regard\r\nit as a sound medical axiom that in cases of cardiac disorder of a less\r\nsevere type than that just described the woman thus affected should not\r\nhave more than one or two children. This is the more necessary because\r\nwith each successive pregnancy the functional capacity of the diseased\r\nheart decreases in geometrical progression and the danger to life\r\nproportionately increases. But in such cases of heart disease the\r\nprevention of pregnancy must never be effected by the interruption of\r\ncoitus by the man before ejaculation, for the reason that this procedure\r\ngives rise to manifold reflex cardiac troubles, and especially to\r\nparoxysms of tachycardia, with simultaneous diminution in vascular tone,\r\nvasomotor disturbances, and states of mental depression—and these entail\r\nexceptional dangers in women suffering from heart disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE DETERMINATION OF SEX.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the determination of sex in the human species is one\r\nwhich has occupied natural philosophers from the very earliest times,\r\nand has always greatly interested all classes of the population.\r\n\r\nThe interest awakened by the subject depends principally on the fact\r\nthat female children have usually been less desired than male in all\r\nperiods of history and among almost all races. In the uppermost circles\r\nof society the truth of this statement is manifested by the fact that\r\nthe birth of a prince is announced by a salute of 101 guns, that of a\r\nprincess by a salute of 35 guns only.\r\n\r\nIt would serve no useful purpose to transcribe here the opinions, or\r\nrather guesses, which were ventured on this topic in earlier days when\r\nthe very nature of the reproductive process was still entirely unknown,\r\nand we shall merely mention that the curious will find various\r\nreferences to the determination of sex in the works of _Hippocrates_,\r\n_Aristotle_, _Plutarch_, _Soranus_, _Susruta_ and _Galen_.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the earlier theories may be said to diverge in two\r\nmain directions, some holding that the sex of the infant was in some way\r\ndetermined by the mode of intermixture of the male and the female\r\nelements in the act of generation, and others maintaining that sex was\r\nalready inalterably predetermined at the time of intercourse either in\r\nthe male or in the female sexual elements.\r\n\r\n_Pari passu_ with the modern development of the theory of evolution, and\r\nwith the enormous increase in recent days in anatomical and\r\nphysiological knowledge, the theory of the determination of sex has been\r\nvery widely extended. The rival views may be briefly arranged in the\r\nfour following categories:\r\n\r\nI. That sex is already inalterably predetermined in the ovum, upon the\r\nconstitution of which it solely depends; there are therefore male and\r\nfemale ova, and the process of fertilization exercises no influence\r\nwhatever upon the determination of sex. The alternative theory to the\r\nabove, that sex is determined solely by the constitution of the\r\nfertilizing spermatozoon—_i. e._, that the spermatozoa, and not the ova,\r\nare male and female, respectively—is one which in recent years has\r\ntended more and more to disappear from the field.\r\n\r\nII. That sex is determined in the moment of fertilization by the\r\nreciprocal interaction of male and female, of zoösperm and ovum. One\r\nvariant of this theory maintains that each reproductive element strives\r\nfor the reproduction of its own sex; that a struggle takes place and\r\nthat the victor in the contest stamps its own sex-likeness upon the\r\nfertilized product. According to another view, however, sex is not\r\ndirectly transmitted in this manner; it is supposed that the more\r\npowerful the proper reproductive element (according to this theory the\r\novum) the more strongly does it tend to determine the reproduction of a\r\nstronger, _i. e._, a male organism; thus the greater potency of the\r\nfemale element in the act of reproduction tends to favour the\r\ndetermination of the male sex.\r\n\r\nIII. That sex is not determined until after fertilization, during the\r\nearly stages of the development of the embryo; the determining causes\r\nare supposed to be various factors capable of influencing the developing\r\norganism during this period, and more particularly the nutritive\r\nconditions of the mother.\r\n\r\nIV. That the determination of sex is not dependent solely upon the\r\naction of any single one of the factors above enumerated, but arises as\r\na resultant effect of the operation on the germ of all three of these\r\nacting in temporal succession.\r\n\r\nModern physiology has endeavoured to solve this problem by statistical\r\ninvestigations, by anatomical demonstration, and finally by experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _I. Statistical Investigations._\r\n\r\nStatistical data have been collected showing the ratios between male and\r\nfemale births in the most varied conditions possible, and from these\r\ndata the attempt has been made to draw valid conclusions regarding the\r\ncauses of the determination of sex. Now in the first place it is above\r\nall necessary to bear in mind that such statistical data cannot possibly\r\nhave any value unless they relate to very numerous instances, and even\r\nthen they are liable to be invalidated by various sources of fallacy. We\r\nmay with advantage quote in this connection the remarks of _Hensen_ in\r\nhis work on the “Physiology of Reproduction:” “Each individual instance\r\nis rendered unique in kind by the interaction of certain incommensurable\r\nelements; for instance the state of health of the individual organs in\r\ntheir innumerable combinations, variations in the general health of the\r\nparents, the frequency of coitus and the time at which it took place,\r\nthe desire of the parents to have a son and then no more children, their\r\nsocial position—in these ways innumerable complications are introduced\r\ninto the problem, and the difficulty of drawing valid conclusions is\r\nrendered almost insuperable, unless the number of instances dealt with\r\nis enormously large.”\r\n\r\nOne fact definitely established is that more boys are born than girls,\r\nthe proportion between the two, known as the sexual ratio, being\r\n106 : 100. Statistics relating to the half of Europe (_Oesterlen_) and\r\ndealing with 59,350,000 births, showed a ratio of 106.3 male to 100\r\nfemale births; in individual countries variations from this mean are\r\nfound to occur, but these are not very extensive, the highest ratio\r\nbeing 107.2 : 100, and the lowest ratio 105.2 : 100.\r\n\r\nFrom the works of _Hofacker_ (“Ueber die Eigenschaften welche sich\r\nbei Menschen und Tieren von den Eltern auf die Nachkommen\r\nvererben”—Concerning the Qualities transmitted from Parents to\r\nOffspring in Men and Animals—Tuebingen, 1828) and _Sadler_ (“Law of\r\nPopulation,” London, 1830) conclusions have been drawn regarding the\r\neffect of a variation in the age ratio of the parents on the\r\ndetermination of sex. The deductions in question, known as\r\n_Hofacker_ and _Sadler’s_ law, are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. If the husband is older than the wife more boys are born than girls.\r\n\r\n2. If husband and wife are the same age somewhat fewer boys are born\r\nthan girls.\r\n\r\n3. If the wife is older than the husband the excess of female births is\r\nlarger still.\r\n\r\n_Hofacker’s_ actual figures were the following:\r\n\r\n  Father younger than mother                  90.1 boys to 100 girls.\r\n  Father same age as mother                   93.3 boys to 100 girls.\r\n  Father 4 to 6 years older than mother      108.8 boys to 100 girls.\r\n  Father 6 to 9 years older than mother      124.7 boys to 100 girls.\r\n  Father 9 to 12 years older than mother     143.7 boys to 100 girls.\r\n\r\nSadler’s results were closely similar:\r\n\r\n  Father younger than mother                  86   boys to 100 girls.\r\n  Father same age as mother                   94   boys to 100 girls.\r\n  Father 1 to 6 years older than mother      103   boys to 100 girls.\r\n  Father 6 to 11 years older than mother     126   boys to 100 girls.\r\n  Father 11 to 16 years older than mother    147   boys to 100 girls.\r\n  Father 16 years and more older than mother 163   boys to 100 girls.\r\n\r\n_Goehlert_ found that the offspring of marriages in which the husband\r\nwas younger than the wife were 71 boys and 86 girls; of marriages in\r\nwhich husband and wife were of the same age, 263 boys and 282 girls; and\r\nof marriages in which the husband was older than the wife, 2,017 boys\r\nand 1,865 girls.\r\n\r\n_Wappaeus_, combining the data supplied by these three investigators,\r\n_Hofacker_, _Sadler_ and _Goehlert_, obtained the following sexual\r\nratios for the entire 8,000 cases (_i. e._, the number of boys born to\r\neach 100 girls born): When the husband was younger than the wife, 88.2;\r\nwhen husband and wife were of the same age, 93.5; when the husband was\r\nolder than the wife, 113.0.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the mean sexual ratio of these 8,000 cases is\r\n109.6; whilst, as we saw above, when a sufficiently large number of\r\ninstances is taken, the sexual ratio always closely approximates to\r\n106.3. From this it appears that the numbers dealt with by _Hofacker_,\r\n_Sadler_ and _Goehlert_ in their investigations were too small for the\r\ndeduction of trustworthy averages.\r\n\r\nThe same criticism is applicable to the observations of _Ahlfeld_,\r\n_Breslau_ and _Noirot_, whose results conflict with those just given.\r\nAccording to _Ahlfeld_, in the case of 1,376 births where the father was\r\nat least 10 years older than the mother, the sexual ratio was only 98.2.\r\nAccording to _Noirot’s_ data, in cases in which the father was older\r\nthan the mother, this ratio was 99.7.\r\n\r\n_Oesterlen_ gives the following brief summary of the researches made for\r\nthe establishment and confirmation of the law of _Hofacker_ and\r\n_Sadler_:\r\n\r\n ═══════════════╤══════════╤══════════╤══════════╤══════════╤══════════\r\n                │  Father  │Father and│  Mother  │  Sexual  │Number of\r\n     AUTHOR.    │older than│  mother  │older than│  ratio.  │instances.\r\n                │ mother.  │same age. │ father.  │          │\r\n ───────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n Hofacker       │     117.8│      92.0│      90.6│     107.5│     1,996\r\n Sadler         │     121.4│      94.8│      86.5│     114.7│     2,008\r\n Goehlert       │     108.2│      93.3│      82.6│     105.3│     4,584\r\n Noirot         │      99.7│          │     116.0│     103.5│     4,000\r\n Legoyt (Calais)│     109.9│     107.9│     101.6│     107.9│     6,006\r\n Legoyt (Paris) │     104.4│     102.1│      97.5│     102.9│    52,311\r\n Breslau        │     103.9│     103.1│     117.6│     106.6│     8,084\r\n ═══════════════╧══════════╧══════════╧══════════╧══════════╧══════════\r\n\r\nThe law of _Hofacker_ and _Sadler_ cannot be regarded as possessing\r\nuniversal validity, although the figures on which it is based seem to\r\nshow pretty clearly that we are justified in regarding the mutual\r\ninteraction of the male and female reproductive elements at the moment\r\nof fertilization as effective in the determination of sex. In the\r\ninvestigations to which we have hitherto alluded it is only the relative\r\nages of husband and wife that have been taken into account; but other\r\nresearches have shown that the absolute age alike of the husband and of\r\nthe wife has an influence in the determination of sex.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the absolute age of the mother in the determination of\r\nsex has been very clearly established. _Ahlfeld_ was the first to draw\r\nattention to the fact that among the children of elderly primiparæ there\r\nwas always to be found an excess of boys, and that there was an increase\r\nin this excess proportionate to the greater age of the mother. Among 102\r\nchildren born to primiparæ over 32 years of age the sexual ratio was\r\n137 : 100; and a later investigation made by the same author in\r\nconjunction with _Schramm_ showed that among 1,038 children born to\r\nprimiparæ over 28 years of age the sexual ratio was 124 : 100.\r\n\r\n_Hecker_ obtained similar results. Among 432 children born to primiparæ\r\nover thirty years of age the sexual ratio was 133 : 100. _Winckel_,\r\ndealing with primiparæ of the same ages, found a sexual ratio of\r\n136.8 : 100.\r\n\r\n_Düsing_, examining the records of the lying-in hospitals of Leipzig,\r\nDresden and Jena and thus obtaining a very large number of instances\r\nwhereon to base his conclusions, confirmed the view that elderly\r\nprimiparæ give birth to an excess of boys, and further that the older\r\nthey are the larger the excess of male births.

In multiparæ also it is possible to trace the\r\ninfluence of a deficiency of male individuals. When there is such a\r\ndeficiency the interval between successive births is unduly protracted.\r\n_Düsing_ found (once more from the records of the lying-in hospitals of\r\nDresden, Leipzig and Jena) that the longer the interval between one\r\nparturition and the next the longer, that is to say, the mother has had\r\nto wait for her next conception, the greater is the excess of male\r\nbirths. _Düsing_ therefore lays down the law: “Delayed impregnation\r\ngives rise to an excess of male births.”\r\n\r\n ═══════════╤════════════╤════════════╤════════════╤════════════╤═══════\r\n   Age of   │  Leipzig.  │  Dresden.  │   Jena.    │ Total Nos. │Sexual\r\n primiparæ. │Boys.

Among the offspring of 363\r\nmothers, at ages varying from 16 to 26 years, _Hofacker_ found the\r\nsexual ratio to be 121; among the offspring of 1,056 mothers, at ages 26\r\nto 36, the ratio was 101; and among the offspring of 567 mothers at ages\r\n36 to 46, the ratio was 111. _Hampe_ tabulated 5,992 instances as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n ═══════════════════════╤═══════════════════════╤═══════════════════════\r\n     AGE OF MOTHER.     │ Number of instances.  │     Sexual ratio.\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n Below 20 years         │                     56│                  107.7\r\n 20 to 25 years         │                    871│                   90.6\r\n 25 to 30 years         │                  1,633│                  114.9\r\n 30 to 35 years         │                  1,631│                  108.3\r\n 35 to 40 years         │                  1,185│                  117.1\r\n Over 40 years          │                    616│                  124.0\r\n ═══════════════════════╧═══════════════════════╧═══════════════════════\r\n\r\nWe learn, therefore, that if the age of the progenitors is to be\r\nregarded as one of the causes by which sex is determined, we must take\r\ninto consideration not only the relative ages of husband and wife but,\r\nin addition, the absolute age of the wife.\r\n\r\n_Goehlert_ undertook a statistical investigation in which the absolute\r\nage of the husband was taken into consideration as well as that of the\r\nwife. From this it appeared that the maximum sexual ratio was exhibited\r\nwhen the father was between the ages of 30 and 35 years. When the age of\r\nthe mother is treated as the determining influence, we find the maximum\r\nsexual ratio in the offspring of mothers between the ages of 25 and 30\r\nyears. _Goehlert_ believes, however, that the paternal influence is more\r\npowerful than the maternal in the determination of sex. The respective\r\ninfluences are compared in the following table:\r\n\r\n ══════════════╤═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════\r\n AGE OF FATHER.│                    AGE OF MOTHER.\r\n ──────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────\r\n       „       │  20 to 30   │  30 to 40   │   Over 40   │   Totals.\r\n               │   years.    │   years.    │   years.    │\r\n ──────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n 25 to 35 years│       105.76│       107.87│       109.14│        106.6\r\n 35 to 45 years│        102.8│        105.1│        105.3│        104.7\r\n Over 45 years │             │        104.3│        103.9│        109.1\r\n In general    │       105.25│       105.97│        104.9│        105.5\r\n ══════════════╧═════════════╧═════════════╧═════════════╧═════════════\r\n\r\n_Geissler_, studying the data obtainable regarding the sexual ratio\r\nduring a 10–year period in the Kingdom of Saxony, ascertained that in\r\nfamilies possessing two children or more there was a very definite\r\ndistribution of the possible sex-combinations. Where there was an even\r\nnumber of children those families were in the majority in which the\r\nnumber of boys and girls was identical. If the number of children in the\r\nfamily is an unequal one, those combinations are most frequent in which\r\nthe number of boys exceeds the number of girls by one; next in frequency\r\nare those combinations reversed to this, _i. e._, in which the number of\r\ngirls exceeds the number of boys by one. All other combinations are\r\ncomparatively infrequent in proportion as the discrepancy in number\r\nbetween boys and girls is larger. Rarest of all are families in which\r\nthe children are all of the same sex; and among these, again, the most\r\nunusual are those consisting of boys only.\r\n\r\nThis distribution of the sex-combination is believed by _Geissler_ to\r\ndepend upon the fact that in the first birth and all the subsequent\r\nbirths there is generally speaking a slight advantage in favour of the\r\nmale sex. It has not been proved that the sex of the first-born\r\nexercises a determining influence on the sex of the subsequent children.\r\nIt does, however, seem clear that in the case of parents who have given\r\nbirth in succession to several children of one sex only, there exists\r\nsome definite obstacle to the procreation of children of the opposite\r\nsex. Putting these exceptions out of consideration, there seems to exist\r\na tendency in the later births of a series toward the procreation, more\r\nespecially of that sex which has been absent or deficient in the earlier\r\nbirths of the series. The strength of this equalizing tendency increases\r\nas soon as it has for the first time manifest itself. It is always\r\ngreater when the sex deficient in the earlier births of the series has\r\nbeen the male.\r\n\r\nI have myself undertaken a statistical investigation of the births\r\noccurring in the reigning families of Europe and in the families of the\r\nleading members of the aristocracy. The necessary particulars are to be\r\nobtained from the genealogical court calendars; and it is my belief that\r\nthe data obtained regarding these uppermost strata of society are\r\ncomparatively free from many sources of error by which the ordinary\r\nstatistics of the subject are apt to be invalidated. For 556 marriages\r\nthere were 1,972 births, comprising 1,023 boys and 949 girls, and thus\r\nexhibiting a sexual ratio of 107.7.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the relative ages of the parents, the following table was\r\ndrawn up:\r\n\r\n ══════════════════════════════════════════════════╤══════╤══════╤══════\r\n                                                   │      │      │Sexual\r\n                                                   │Boys. │Girls.│ratio.\r\n ──────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────┼──────┼──────\r\n Husband older than wife by one to five years      │   294│   283│ 103.8\r\n Husband older than wife by more than five and less│      │      │\r\n   than ten years                                  │   327│   306│ 106.8\r\n Husband older than wife by more than ten and less │      │      │\r\n   than fifteen years                              │   190│   167│ 113.7\r\n Husband older than wife by more than fifteen years│   138│   113│ 122.1\r\n Husband same age as wife                          │    34│    42│  80.9\r\n Husband younger than wife                         │    40│    38│ 105.2\r\n ══════════════════════════════════════════════════╧══════╧══════╧══════\r\n\r\nFrom these figures we may deduce the following conclusions, which are\r\nnot wholly concordant with the law of _Hofacker_ and _Sadler_: When the\r\nhusband is older than the wife the excess of male births among the\r\noffspring is greater than it is in the case of an average drawn from the\r\noffspring of all marriages (in my cases the difference was 111.8 as\r\ncompared with 107.7). But a closer analysis shows the difference to be\r\nless simple than at first sight appears. If the husband is older than\r\nthe wife by one to five years, the excess of male births among their\r\noffspring (103.8) is less than in the average of all marriages (107.7);\r\nthe same is true of the offspring of marriages in which the husband is\r\nmore than five and less than ten years older than the wife, though the\r\ndifference here is very trifling (106.8 as compared with 107.7). It is\r\nnot till we come to the offspring of marriages in which the husband is\r\nfrom ten to fifteen years older than the wife that the increase in the\r\nexcess of male births becomes notable (113.7 as compared with 107.7);\r\nand when the husband is more than fifteen years older than the wife the\r\nexcess of males is higher still (122.1).\r\n\r\nIf we arrange these data so as to show, in cases in which the husband is\r\nolder than the wife, the additional influence of the absolute age of the\r\nwife, we obtain results which partially conflict with those of _Bidder_,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n ══════════════════════════════════════════════════╤══════╤══════╤══════\r\n              HUSBAND OLDER THAN WIFE.             │      │      │Sexual\r\n                                                   │Boys. │Girls.│ratio.\r\n ──────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────┼──────┼──────\r\n Wife’s age, 15 to 20 years                        │   280│   287│  97.6\r\n Wife’s age, 20 to 26 years                        │   595│   513│ 116.0\r\n Wife’s age, 26 to 33 years                        │    74│    69│ 110.1\r\n ══════════════════════════════════════════════════╧══════╧══════╧══════\r\n\r\nThus we see that when the wife is very young, i e., less than twenty\r\nyears of age, even though the husband is older than the wife, there is\r\namong their offspring no excess of male births, but the contrary—a\r\nsexual ratio of 97.6 only. Most marked is the excess of boys in cases in\r\nwhich the husband is older than the wife, and the age of the wife is\r\nfrom twenty to twenty-five years. When the husband is older than the\r\nwife, and the wife’s age lies between twenty-five and thirty-two years,\r\nthe excess of male births is not so great, though still considerable.\r\n\r\nHence it appears that the law of _Hofacker_ and _Sadler_, which cannot\r\nbe regarded as fully valid in the terms in which it was originally\r\nexpressed, must be modified as follows: If the husband is at least 10\r\nyears older than the wife, and the latter is at an age when her\r\nreproductive capacity is at its maximum (twenty to twenty-five years),\r\nthe offspring exhibit a notable excess of male births. There is still a\r\nconsiderable excess of male births in the offspring of marriages in\r\nwhich the husband is at least ten years older than the wife, and the\r\nwife is more than twenty-five years of age. On the other hand fewer boys\r\nare born than girls as the offspring of marriages in which, although the\r\nhusband is older than the wife, the wife has not yet attained the age of\r\nmaximum reproductive capacity—_i. e._, is less than twenty years of age.\r\nThe excess of female births is most marked when the husband and wife are\r\nof the same age. When the wife is older than the husband there is a\r\nmoderate excess of male births.\r\n\r\nI admit, however, that the figures upon which I have based these\r\nconclusions are, like those of _Hofacker_, too few in number for the\r\nfoundation of trustworthy inferences. The instances in my computation\r\nnumber 1,972; those in that of _Hofacker_, 1,996; but, as I have already\r\nremarked, there are reasons for believing that the data I have employed\r\nadmit of the introduction of fewer sources of error.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the absolute age of the mother in the determination of\r\nsex having been statistically proved, many have inferred that this\r\ndetermination is not effected during the instant of fertilization, but\r\noccurs at a later stage of intra-uterine life, and is influenced by the\r\nmanner in which the embryo is nourished by the maternal organism. It is\r\nsuggested that elderly and immature mothers are unable to furnish the\r\nembryo with nutriment so well as those mothers who are at the age of\r\nmaximum reproductive capacity, and that upon this fact depends the\r\nexcess of male births in the latter case. (We shall return to this\r\nmatter—the influence of deficient nutrition in relation to the excess of\r\nmale births). But the proof of the fact that the absolute age of the\r\nfather has also an influence in the determination of the sex of the\r\noffspring offers a ground for opposing this assumption that the sex of\r\nthe embryo is determined during intra-uterine life subsequent to\r\nfertilization, and suggests that the father also exercises a determining\r\ninfluence in the origination of sex during the act of fertilization.\r\n\r\nThe absolute age of the husband seems also to have some influence upon\r\nthe sexual ratio. The absolute age, like the relative age, of the father\r\nappears favourable to the procreation of a greater excess of boys. Thus,\r\n_Hofacker_ found in 1,193 cases, in which the age of the father was from\r\ntwenty-four to thirty-six years, that the sexual ratio was 100; in 683\r\ncases in which the age of the father was from thirty-six to forty-eight\r\nyears, the sexual ratio was 114; and in 105 cases, in which the age of\r\nthe father was from forty-eight to sixty years, the sexual ratio was\r\n169.\r\n\r\nIn investigations based upon larger collections of cases _Schumann_ and\r\n_Düsing_ have endeavoured to determine the variation in the sexual ratio\r\naccording to the absolute age of the father.\r\n\r\n_Düsing_ examined the statistics of births in Norway, Alsace-Lorraine\r\nand Berlin, and from the data thus obtained he compiled the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n ════════╤════════════════════╤════════════════════╤════════════════════\r\n  AGE OF │  30 TO 35 YEARS.   │  25 TO 30 YEARS.   │  20 TO 25 YEARS.\r\n MOTHER. │                    │                    │\r\n ────────┼──────┬──────┬──────┼──────┬──────┬──────┼──────┬──────┬──────\r\n  AGE OF │Boys. │Girls.│Sexual│Boys. │Girls.│Sexual│Boys. │Girls.│Sexual\r\n FATHER. │      │      │ratio.│      │      │ratio.│      │      │ratio.\r\n ────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────\r\n 15 to 30│ 8,525│ 7,887│ 108.1│27,389│25,843│ 106.0│21,560│20,330│ 106.0\r\n   years │      │      │      │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n 30 to 35│23,283│21,823│ 106.9│23,394│23,486│ 103.9│ 7,954│ 7,469│ 106.5\r\n   years │      │      │      │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n 35 to 40│17,885│17,070│ 104.7│10,272│ 9,838│ 104.2│ 2,426│ 2,416│ 100.4\r\n   years │      │      │      │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n ────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────\r\n 40 to 45│ 7,972│ 7,681│ 103.8│ 3,165│ 3,058│ 103.5│     }│ 1,100│ 105.0\r\n   years │      │      │      │      │      │      │ 1,154│      │\r\n Over 45 │ 4,220│ 3,997│ 105.6│ 1,734│ 1,525│ 113.8│  „   │  „   │  „\r\n   years │      │      │      │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n ────────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────\r\n\r\nIn this table we find the births arranged in relation to varying ages of\r\nthe fathers and in relation to mothers whose ages are tabulated in three\r\nclasses, the ages of the latter being those at which they are most\r\nprolific. The table shows clearly that the excess of boys is larger at\r\nthe beginning and at the end of each column. Thus, the age of the mother\r\nremaining constant, young fathers and elderly fathers procreate a larger\r\nproportion of boys than do fathers of intermediate age.\r\n\r\nBut I find in this table, which is based upon a very large number of\r\ninstances indeed, a confirmation of the thesis which I stated above, for\r\nthe highest sexual ratio of 113.8 is in this table found in the case of\r\nfathers over forty-five years of age who are married to mothers of ages\r\ntwenty-five to thirty years; this is, as I said, the case in which “the\r\nhusband is at least ten years older than the wife, and the latter is at\r\nthe age at which her reproductive capacity is at its maximum.”\r\n\r\nFrom such figures as these, which seem to show the influence of the\r\nabsolute age of the father upon the determination of sex, it has by many\r\nbeen inferred that the man exercises a preponderating influence upon the\r\ndetermination of the sex of the embryo, impressing his own sex upon it,\r\nand that the greater the sexual potency of the begetter the more\r\npowerful also is the influence exercised by the latter; that the point\r\nof first importance in this connection is the sexual capacity of the\r\nman; and that the excess of male births increases _pari passu_ with the\r\nincrease in the potency of the procreating male.\r\n\r\nTwo additional considerations have been adduced to demonstrate the\r\ninfluence of the father in determining the sex of the offspring. The\r\nfirst of these is a comparison of the ratio between male and female\r\nbirths in towns and in rural districts, respectively; and the second is\r\na comparison between the ratio of males to females in the offspring of\r\nmarried and of unmarried parents, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn towns the excess of male births is smaller than it is in the country.\r\nThe average sexual ratio in Prussia during the five-year period, 1875 to\r\n1880, is given by _Düsing_ as follows:\r\n\r\n                      In Berlin             105.70\r\n                      In other large towns  105.72\r\n                      In medium sized towns 105.44\r\n                      In small towns        106.17\r\n                      In rural districts    106.62\r\n\r\nThe indisputable fact that in towns more girls are born than in rural\r\ndistricts is referred to the fact that in the country the husband\r\nusually enters on marriage with his virile powers completely unimpaired,\r\nwhereas in towns many men only marry after they have for many years\r\nexpended their best forces in irregular sexual intercourse, and thus\r\nreserve for their wives only the dregs. But, as we shall show presently,\r\nthe difference between town and country in this respect is susceptible\r\nof a different interpretation.\r\n\r\nIt has also been asserted (_Horn_) that extra-conjugal sexual\r\nintercourse is favourable to the procreation of boys, the suggestion\r\nbeing that the greater sexual vigour in the former case determines a\r\npreponderance of males in the offspring; but this assumption is\r\ninvalidated by the statistical evidence which now accumulates, that\r\namong illegitimate offspring there is a smaller excess of boys than\r\namong legitimate offspring. _Babbage_, for instance, came to this\r\nconclusion as a result of the comparison of 1,000,000 illegitimate\r\nbirths with 14,000,000 legitimate births. On the other hand, the\r\nfollowing utterance of _Ploss_ appears extremely artificial: “In a\r\ncountry in which illegitimate births are very numerous, in which the\r\nillegitimate children are for the most part begotten by enervated\r\ndebauchees, the excess of male births is smaller; but in a country in\r\nwhich the illegitimate births are less numerous, and in which the\r\nillegitimate infants are for the most part the fruit of love and are\r\nbegotten by youthful lovers, the excess of male offspring is larger.”\r\n\r\nNext to the age of the progenitors, their nutritive condition is shown\r\nby statistical investigations to exercise an important influence in the\r\ndetermination of sex. The following proposition has, in fact, been\r\nestablished: Where the supply of nutriment is deficient, the offspring\r\ncontains an excessive proportion of boys.\r\n\r\n_Ploss_, in an article on “The Causes of Variations in the Sexual\r\nRatio,” published in twelfth volume of the “Berliner geburtsh.\r\nMonatsheft,” has collected a number of statistical data to demonstrate\r\nthat the determination of sex is principally dependent upon the\r\nnutritive condition of the mother. In his opinion the determination of\r\nthe sex of the embryo depends neither upon the quality of the ovum nor\r\nupon that of the spermatozoon, nor again upon the reciprocal influences\r\nexerted by ovum and spermatozoon on one another. During the earliest\r\ntime after fertilization the embryo is sexually neutral and only later,\r\nas a result of some new influence acting upon it, does it receive an\r\nimpulse toward the formation either of the male or of the female sex.\r\nAmong all the external conditions which are capable during this period\r\nof exercising a determinative influence the most important are the\r\nnutritive conditions, for nutrition is the most important factor in\r\ndetermining the form of the young animal, and most of the other outward\r\nconditions, such as light, heat, and chemical changes, affect the embryo\r\nin a mediate manner only, through the changes they are respectively\r\ncapable of inducing in its nutrition and metabolism. But _Ploss_ is not\r\ncontent with asserting that the nutritive condition of the mother is of\r\ngreat importance in determining the sex of the embryo; he goes further\r\nthan this, and declares that it is scanty nutrition of the mother which\r\nespecially gives rise to the birth of males, whereas abundant nutrition\r\nof the mother tends to give rise to the birth of females. He refers to\r\nobservations made in respect of other animals than man. _St. Hilaire_\r\nobserved that among the underfed animals in menageries there was an\r\nexcess of male births. _Hofacker_ and _Girou de Bazarcingues_ have noted\r\nsimilar phenomena in the case of domestic animals; they found that when\r\nthese were richly fed they gave birth to an excess of females, but that\r\nwhen they were poorly nourished they gave birth, on the contrary, to an\r\nexcess of males. Among sheep, with whom the number of male and of female\r\nbirths is approximately identical, _Martegoute_ found that those animals\r\nwhich had given birth to female lambs had on the average a greater\r\nweight than those ewes which had given birth to male lambs. During the\r\nperiod of lactation, also, the former lost weight more than the latter.\r\n\r\nWhen _Ploss_ had further ascertained that among those engaged in the\r\nfur-trade it is the established belief that from fruitful regions the\r\nskins chiefly of female animals will be obtained, but from barren\r\nregions, on the other hand, among the skins obtained those of male\r\nanimals will preponderate, it appeared to him that he was justified in\r\ndrawing the conclusion that among the mammalia a well-nourished mother,\r\none capable of providing abundant nutriment for her offspring, is, on\r\nthe whole, more likely to give birth to a female than to a male, and\r\nconversely. He then endeavoured, by reference to the statistics of\r\npopulation, to show that in the case of human beings also, when the\r\nmother is exceptionally well nourished, there is especial likelihood of\r\na girl being born; whereas when the mother is ill nourished she is more\r\nlikely to give birth to a boy—odd as it may seem, at first sight, that a\r\nrich diet should determine the production of the so-called less powerful\r\nsex, the female; and conversely. (_Ploss_, be it noted however, denies\r\nthat male new-born infants are more powerful than female.) The fact that\r\nin the country, comparatively speaking, many more boys are born than in\r\ntowns (_vide supra_) is explained by _Ploss_ as dependent on the fact\r\nthat townswomen are on the whole better nourished than the countrywomen,\r\nowing to the greater consumption of meat by the former.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance again (likewise alluded to above), that in the case of\r\nillegitimate births almost always the excess of male births is less\r\nmarked than in the case of the offspring of legal unions, is regarded by\r\n_Ploss_ as offering further proof of the influence of nutritive\r\nconditions upon the determination of sex. Illegitimate mothers are on\r\nthe average women at the very best age for child-bearing, women who have\r\nworked vigorously, are themselves well nourished, and are therefore\r\nbetter able to nourish their unborn offspring than (on the average)\r\nmarried women. Further, it is a remarkable fact that in Saxony, regions\r\nof which the elevation above the sea-level is less than 1,000 feet,\r\nproduce comparatively more girls than regions at an altitude of 1,000 to\r\n2,000 feet above the sea. This _Ploss_ refers to the worse nutrition of\r\nthe women living at the higher altitude, for the fact is well known that\r\nthe higher we go above the sea the less fertile is the soil and the more\r\nlimited is its produce.\r\n\r\nStarting from the view that the lower classes of the population are in\r\ngood years better nourished than they are in bad years, _Ploss_ compared\r\nstatistically the rise and fall of the prices of foodstuffs, in Saxony,\r\nwith the variations of the sexual ratio in the same kingdom; and he\r\nfound, in correspondence with his theory, that in bad times there was a\r\ngreater excess of male births than there was during periods in which\r\nfood was cheaper. Moreover, the consumption of meat appeared to have\r\nmore influence upon the variations in the sexual ratio than was\r\nexercised by the consumption of vegetable foodstuffs. _Ploss_\r\nendeavoured to show graphically that with an increase in the price of\r\nprovisions there corresponded an increase in the excess of male births,\r\nand _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nThat after times of great wars, pestilence, and emigration, in which the\r\nmale portion of the population has been decimated, there occurs a\r\nnotable increase in the excess of male births, is explained by _Ploss_\r\nby the assumption that in consequence of the deficiency of male labour,\r\nthe general supply of provisions is deficient, just as it is after years\r\nof bad harvests; hence, in consequence of the scanty nutrition of the\r\nmothers, the number of female births is depressed and the number of male\r\nbirths increases. Those countries which in general possess a more\r\nthriving population, such as Saxony, England, Belgium, Prussia, etc.,\r\nexhibit a smaller excess of male births when compared with those\r\ncountries in which a more widespread poverty exists, such as Russia,\r\nLombardy, Bohemia, and even France. With increasing prosperity,\r\nfruitfulness increases, and there is an increase also in the proportion\r\nof female births.\r\n\r\nThese views of _Ploss’s_ are, however, rightly contested by _Breslau_\r\nand _Wappaeus_.\r\n\r\n_Breslau_ (“The Causes of the Determination of Sex”) offers in the first\r\nplace theoretical objections to the view that nutritive conditions in\r\nthe mother are determinative in the production of the sex of the\r\noffspring; and he then proceeds to quote statistical data which are\r\nopposed to any such theory. He rightly insists, in the first place,\r\nthat, inasmuch as it is unquestionable that in the act of fertilization\r\nthe spermatozoon induces in the ovum certain changes, the effect of\r\nwhich is manifested in days far later than those of intra-uterine life,\r\nby the production of the most manifold and various somatic and psychical\r\nresemblances to the father, it is obvious that this single occurrence of\r\nthe fusion of the spermatozoon, the bearer of the paternal influences,\r\nwith the ovum is competent to induce in the ovum a molecular arrangement\r\nupon which the determination of sex may be supposed to depend—it is not\r\nnecessary to suppose that for this determination, repeated actions, or a\r\nprolonged period of time, is requisite.\r\n\r\nIn this connection a reference to birds is instructive, for in this\r\ndivision of the animal kingdom we seem absolutely compelled to assume\r\nthat the sex of the offspring is irrevocably determined in the moment of\r\nfertilization. “In birds, who lay an egg every day, eggs which are kept\r\nall at the same temperature during the period of incubation, and some of\r\nwhich develop into cock and others into hen birds—how is it possible to\r\nimagine that the nutritive condition of the parent is determinative of\r\nthe sex of the offspring, since this nutritive condition cannot\r\nreasonably be supposed to change to any notable extent from one day to\r\nthe next and then back again?”\r\n\r\nThe paternal influence in the determination of sex is regarded by\r\n_Breslau_ as likely to be at least as important as that exercised by the\r\nmother. Unquestionably the semen is subject to certain variations in\r\nquality and in quantity, and it is possible that these variations may\r\nmake themselves felt in the subsequent development of the embryo. Of the\r\nsemen, as of all secretions, we can assume with some probability that in\r\ncertain conditions (conditions which are, indeed, but little\r\nunderstood), it may exhibit a greater or less intensity in its\r\nstimulating qualities, and that in this way it may be subject to\r\nchanges, according to which it will tend to influence the development of\r\nthe embryo, now in the female, and now in the male direction. Again, in\r\nview of the continued interchange of nutritive materials between the\r\nembryo and the maternal organism, it is probable enough that the\r\nconstitution of the maternal organism and likewise that of the ovum, at\r\nthe moment of fertilization, are not matters of indifference to the\r\ndetermination of sex. But to attribute to the nutritive condition of the\r\nmaternal organism the sole or even the principal influence in the\r\ndetermination of the sex is an unjustifiable assumption.\r\n\r\nThe proofs alleged by _Ploss_ from the animal world in support of his\r\nthesis, viz., that in the case of poorly nourished animals there is a\r\nmarked excess of male offspring, are justly controverted by _Breslau_\r\nwith the remark that the observations on animals are but few in number,\r\nand further that we know nothing whatever regarding the normal sexual\r\nratios among the offspring of such animals as lions, tigers, hyænas,\r\nbears, etc., in the free state.\r\n\r\nIf, again, domestic animals when well nourished give birth to an excess\r\nof female offspring, and when ill nourished and overworked to an excess\r\nof male offspring, in the former case we can only regard the excess of\r\nfemale births as a pathological phenomenon, inasmuch as a superabundant\r\nsupply of nutriment is not that which furnishes the highest powers or is\r\nmost suited to the preservation of life. Again, the accounts given by\r\nfur-dealers are quite untrustworthy, since these men commonly obtain\r\ntheir goods at third and fourth hand; moreover, most of the animals\r\nwhose pelts form articles of commerce, are beasts of prey, such as the\r\notter, the lynx, the bear, the wolf, the fox, etc.—and these animals\r\nhave no “pasturage.” Among vegetable-feeding animals the females are no\r\ndoubt found on the pasturage more often than the males, for the reason\r\nthat the females have to nourish both themselves and their young,\r\nwhereas the males, which have themselves only to provide for, are\r\ncontented with less food and inhabit chiefly more retired and less\r\nfertile regions; they are also shyer and are less easily shot and\r\ntrapped. Regarding statistical data relating to the influence of\r\nnutrition on the production of boys, _Breslau_ shows, from the figures\r\nof the Canton of Zurich, that with few exceptions, the years in which\r\nthe price of corn was lowest were the years in which the production of\r\nboys was greatest, and _vice versa_—the exact opposite of the results\r\nobtained by _Ploss_ from his examination of the figures relating to\r\nbirths and the price of provisions in Saxony.\r\n\r\n_Wappaeus_ contests the conclusions of _Ploss_ even more vigorously, and\r\nadduces the statistics of Sweden in the 20–year period 1770 to 1790, in\r\nwhich period this kingdom repeatedly suffered from famine in consequence\r\nof failure of the crops, so that the births and deaths were largely\r\naffected. It appeared, however, that the more abundant or more scanty\r\nnutrition of the inhabitants of Sweden during this period had no marked\r\ninfluence upon the sexual ratio.\r\n\r\nIf scanty nutrition of the mother had, in fact, any influence upon the\r\ndetermination of the sex of the embryo in the direction alleged by\r\n_Ploss_, viz., so as to bring about the birth of a greater excess of\r\nboys, this influence should be manifested with exceptional clearness in\r\nthe case of twins, for it is obvious that the nutriment that is\r\ninsufficient for one embryo would be still scantier for two. Hence\r\nvarious statistical investigations have been undertaken to determine the\r\nsexual ratio in the case of twin births. _Ploss_ found that in Saxony,\r\nin the case of 23,420 twin births, the sexual ratio was 106.7 boys to\r\n100 girls; _Moser_ gives the sexual ratio in the case of twin births as\r\n106; _Meckel von Hemsbach_ gives it as 105.4; _Hecker_, 116 and 122;\r\n_Sickel_, 112.3. _Düsing_ combined the figures relating to twin births\r\nin various lying-in hospitals, published by _Hecker_, _Sickel_,\r\n_Baillarger_, _Siebold_, _Elsässer_, and _Levy_, respectively, and thus\r\nobtained a sexual ratio of 121.5 boys to 100 girls. This excess of boys\r\nis notably greater than among births in general.\r\n\r\nBut other statistical data are available which show a reversed\r\ncondition, viz., that in the case of twin births the sexual ratio is\r\nlower than usual. According to _von Frick’s_ collection of twin births\r\nin Prussia, the sexual ratio was 104.7 boys to 100 girls; whereas in the\r\ncase of single births in the same country the sexual ratio was 106.35 to\r\n100. _Riecke_, in Württemberg, in the case of 60 twin births found 58\r\nboys and 62 girls. In the case of twin births observed by _Braun_,\r\n_Chiari_, and _Späth_, 94 in all, the children were in 64 of these of\r\nidentical sexes, namely, in 30 instances boys, and in 34 instances\r\ngirls. According to _Breslau_, in the case of twin births in the Canton\r\nZurich, the sexual ratio was 104.1 to 100; whereas in the case of single\r\nbirths the sexual ratio was 106.2 to 100.\r\n\r\nAs regards triplets the reports of the sexual ratio vary from\r\n111.76 : 100 (_Meckel von Hemsbach_) to 104.55 : 100 (_Neefe_).\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the statistical data at present available regarding\r\nthe sexual ratio in the case of multiple births are far too variable for\r\nit to be possible to base upon them any valid conclusions as to the\r\ninfluence of the nutritive condition of the mother upon the\r\ndetermination of the sex of the offspring. And taken as a whole the\r\nstatistical data hitherto available do not enable us to infer with\r\nconfidence that nutritive conditions, and more especially the nutritive\r\nstate of the maternal organism, exercise any effect upon the\r\ndetermination of the sex of the offspring.\r\n\r\nAnother attempt at the utilization of statistics has been to ascertain\r\nwhether the time of fertilization in relation to menstruation, (in the\r\nfirst days after the flow, or later in the intermenstrual interval) has\r\nany influence upon the determination of sex. The starting point in this\r\ninvestigation was the earlier view that sex depends upon the state of\r\nthe ovum, and the belief that a very favourable state of ovum and sperm\r\nfavours the production of the female sex. The ovum, after its discharge\r\nfrom the ovary, like the spermatozoon after its discharge from the\r\ntesticle, tends sooner or later toward death, and the only thing that\r\ncan save either from this ultimate fate, is for the two to unite to form\r\na new organism. Precisely what moment in the history of the detached\r\novum is the most favourable, is a matter regarding which we have no\r\nexact information, but it is probable that at the moment of its\r\ndischarge from the ruptured follicle, it is at the zenith of its vital\r\npowers. On this theory the determination of sex depends upon the period\r\nat which, after its liberation from the follicle, the ovum encounters a\r\nspermatozoon; the ovum which is fertilized early in its career becomes a\r\nfemale embryo; the ovum, on the other hand, which is not fertilized\r\nuntil it has become comparatively old, becomes a male embryo. But, as\r\n_Hensen_ points out, a spermatozoon, according to _its_ condition, may\r\neither fail sufficiently to fortify an ovum which itself is in good\r\ncondition; or, on the other hand, a powerful spermatozoon may fortify an\r\novum of deficient vitality. But it is difficult to say precisely on what\r\nconsiderations the greater or less vitality of the spermatozoon\r\ndepends—or, to speak more in accordance with the terms of the theory, we\r\ndo not know exactly what makes it a good spermatozoon or the reverse. It\r\nmay be “bad,” either because it has remained too long in the testicle or\r\nbecause it has been discharged too quickly, is too recently secreted;\r\nmoreover, a long sojourn of the spermatozoon in the uterus will\r\ndoubtless suffice to lower its vitality.\r\n\r\nThe Jews, more especially, whose religious ordinances forbid them to\r\nhave sexual intercourse either during or shortly after menstruation, and\r\namong whom there is a great excess of male births, have been adduced as\r\na proof of the thesis that sexual intercourse during the later part of\r\nthe intermenstrual interval tends to favour the procreation of boys. In\r\nLeviticus xv. 19, we read: “And if a woman have an issue, and her issue\r\nin her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days.” From the\r\ncommentary in the Talmud it appears that these seven days are to be\r\nreckoned from the commencement of the flow. Statistical reports from\r\nvarious countries show that among the Jews there is a greater excess of\r\nmale births than among the other inhabitants of the respective\r\ncountries. The overplus of male births exhibited by the Jews varies from\r\n1 to 15%, the difference probably depending on the fact that the number\r\nof instances under consideration is too small for uniform results to be\r\npossible. In Prussia, during the period 1820 to 1834, the sexual ratio\r\namong the Jewish births was 111 : 100; during the period 1849 to 1852 it\r\nwas 106 : 100; in Hungary during the period 1835 to 1855 it was\r\n117.1 : 100; in Sweden, 1851 to 1855, it was 108 : 100. Among\r\nillegitimate children of the Jewish community the sexual ratio was, in\r\nAustria, 123.9, in Prussia, 118.6.\r\n\r\n_Fürst_, examining the cases in _von Braun’s_ clinic, and making a\r\nstatistical collection of the days of conception and of delivery, has\r\nendeavoured to prove that “there is an excess of boys when conception\r\noccurs during the period of post-menstrual anæmia.” His figures show, in\r\nfact, a very notable excess of boys in cases in which conception has\r\noccurred during the five days immediately following the cessation the\r\nmenstrual flow; and an excess of girls when conception has occurred\r\nduring the later part of the intermenstrual interval. Thus, in the\r\nformer case the excess of boys is represented by the figures 37 : 12; in\r\nthe latter case the excess of girls is represented by the figures 79\r\n(girls) : 65 (boys). These figures are explained by _Fürst_ on the\r\ntheory that in the human species conception during the period of\r\npost-menstrual anæmia probably leads to an enormous excess of male\r\nconceptions (owing to the fact that the unfertilized ovum is badly\r\nnourished during the days just before conception); whereas in the later\r\npart of the intermenstrual interval the better nourishment of the ovum\r\nprobably leads to the procreation of an excess of girls—hypotheses which\r\nare based on a quite inadequate number of instances. _Fürst_ gives the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n ═════════════════╤═════════════════╤═════════════════╤═════════════════\r\n  NUMBER OF DAYS  │ Number of boys  │ Number of girls │ Boys and girls\r\n  BETWEEN REPUTED │      born.      │      born.      │    together.\r\n      END OF      │                 │                 │\r\n MENSTRUATION AND │                 │                 │\r\n      REPUTED     │                 │                 │\r\n   OCCURRENCE OF  │                 │                 │\r\n    CONCEPTION.   │                 │                 │\r\n ─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n                 1│                7│                1│                8\r\n                 2│                6│                3│                9\r\n                 3│                9│                5│               14\r\n                 4│               15│                3│               18\r\n                 5│                3│                6│                9\r\n                 6│                5│                6│               11\r\n                 7│                6│                5│               11\r\n                 8│                2│                8│               10\r\n                 9│                4│                5│                9\r\n                10│                6│                4│               10\r\n                11│                6│                5│               11\r\n                12│                3│                6│                9\r\n                13│                4│                5│                9\r\n                14│                6│                5│               13\r\n                15│                1│                2│                3\r\n                16│                2│                5│                7\r\n                17│                2│                3│                5\r\n                18│                3│                 │                3\r\n                19│                1│                3│                4\r\n                20│                1│                2│                2\r\n                21│                1│                1│                2\r\n                22│                4│                1│                5\r\n                23│                 │                1│                1\r\n                24│                1│                 │                1\r\n                25│                 │                2│                2\r\n                26│                2│                 │                2\r\n                27│                 │                1│                1\r\n                28│                1│                1│                2\r\n                31│                1│                 │                1\r\n ─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n                  │              102│               91│              193\r\n ═════════════════╧═════════════════╧═════════════════╧═════════════════\r\n\r\n_Baust_ gives a report, based, he says, upon “thoroughly trustworthy\r\ndata,” furnished by personal friends, regarding 14 cases, which show, in\r\nhis opinion, that every conception occurring in a week after the\r\ncessation of the menstrual flow leads to the birth of a girl; but that\r\nwhen conception occurs on the fifth or sixth day after menstruation the\r\nresult varies as regard sex. _Swift_, from a report of 20 cases, draws\r\nthe conclusion that in the intermenstrual interval, boys, in the latter\r\npart of the interval girls are conceived.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the strength of menstruation upon the determination of\r\nsex has also been studied by the statistical method, starting with the\r\nidea that menstruation, in proportion to its strength, affords on the\r\naverage a measure for the subsequent nutrition of the embryo, and this\r\nnutrition is further supposed to determine the sex. _Düsing_ therefore\r\narranged the births occurring in the lying-in hospitals of Dresden,\r\nLeipzig and Jena, according to the information given regarding\r\nmenstruation in the clinical history of each case; it appeared that when\r\nmenstruation was comparatively scanty, there was a greater excess of\r\nboys than when menstruation was comparatively abundant.

In the tables we learn how many mares on an average a stallion had\r\ncovered in each year, that is, we learn how great were the demands made\r\nupon the sexual capacity of the stallion in that particular breeding\r\nstable in that year. The figures relating to the years 1859 to 1892 were\r\ntabulated and averages were drawn with the following results:\r\n\r\n ═════════════════╤═══════════════════════════════════╤═════════════════\r\n  NUMBER OF MARES │       NUMBER OF FOALS BORN.       │  Sexual ratio.\r\n      SERVED.     │                                   │\r\n ─────────────────┼─────────────────┬─────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n         „        │     Colts.      │    Fillies.     │        „\r\n ─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n 60–70            │           42,445│           41,933│           101.22\r\n 55–59            │           56,511│           66,226│           100.49\r\n 50–54            │           59,940│           61,096│            98.18\r\n 45–49            │           57,077│           59,216│            96.39\r\n 40–44            │           59,967│           62,007│            96.71\r\n 35–39            │           38,348│           40,181│            95.44\r\n 20–34            │           26,354│           27,069│            97.35\r\n ═════════════════╧═════════════════╧═════════════════╧═════════════════\r\n\r\nFrom these figures, which relate a very large number of instances\r\nindeed, we learn that when greater demands are made upon the stallion,\r\nmore males are procreated. In fact, except for two slight divergencies,\r\nthe rise in the sexual ratio proceeds strictly _pari passu_ with the\r\nincrease in the number of mares covered.\r\n\r\nI must, however, draw attention to the fact that this assumption when\r\napplied to the human species, that the man on whom whose sexual capacity\r\nespecially extensive demands are made, procreates an especially large\r\nnumber of male children, is not confirmed by the sexual ratio among the\r\noffspring of polygamous marriages in which unquestionably greater\r\ndemands are made upon the husband’s sexual powers than is the case in\r\nmonogamic unions.\r\n\r\nThe reports of travellers of earlier days, to the effect that in\r\nOriental countries more girls are born than boys, have recently been\r\nconfirmed by several observers. _Campbell_ states that in the harems of\r\nSiam the number of boys and girls born is equal. _Clarke_ states that\r\namong the Mohammedan Indians more girls are born than boys. According to\r\n_McLennan_ Indian experience teaches us that where polyandry prevails\r\nmale offspring predominate in numbers; but where polygamy prevails there\r\nis, on the contrary, an excess of female infants. The following data\r\ncollected by _Goehlert_ from historical reports and from genealogical\r\nwritings, regarding the progeny of notable persons living in polygamous\r\nunions, show certainly a large excess of female offspring over male:\r\n\r\n ═════════════════╤═══════════════════════════════════╤═════════════════\r\n                  │             CHILDREN.             │  Sexual ratio.\r\n ─────────────────┼─────────────────┬─────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n         „        │      Male.      │     Female.     │        „\r\n ─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n Morocco: Muley   │               24│              124│             19.4\r\n   Scherif        │                 │                 │\r\n Palestine:       │                 │                 │\r\n   Rehoboam, King │               28│               60│             46.6\r\n   of the Jews    │                 │                 │\r\n Arabia: Imon of  │               14│               74│             18.9\r\n   Sana           │                 │                 │\r\n Turkey: nine     │              110│              128│             85.9\r\n   sultans        │                 │                 │\r\n ═════════════════╧═════════════════╧═════════════════╧═════════════════\r\n\r\nAccording to _Tousenel_, love marriages give rise to more daughters than\r\nsons, whereas among the offspring of conventional or compulsory\r\nmarriages, male children predominate. Further, among the offspring of\r\nlegitimate unions, the excess of males is greater than among the\r\noffspring of illegitimate unions. A physician, _V. J. Cook_, maintains\r\nthat boys are procreated in the evenings (before midnight), but girls\r\nduring the early morning hours—at which latter time women are less\r\n“impressionable” than during the evening hours.\r\n\r\n_Düsing_, starting from the common belief that all animals have the\r\nfaculty, when there is a lack of individuals of one sex, of procreating\r\nan excess of offspring of the sex which is deficient and thus of\r\nrestoring the balance between the sexes, maintains that numerous\r\nfactors, through the co-operation of which the sexual ratio is\r\nregulated, act in temporal succession. He shows that the individuality\r\nof the mother has an influence upon the sex. But this finds expression\r\nthrough the qualitative constitution of the ovum; hence already before\r\nfertilization there must exist a tendency toward the development of one\r\nsex or the other—for example, younger ova tend to become females; older\r\nova, on the contrary, to become males. It has further been shown that\r\nthe individuality of the father, that is to say, the qualitative\r\nconstitution of the sperm, has an influence in the determination of sex.\r\nThus, by means of the influence of the sperm, the already-mentioned\r\npre-existing tendency of the ovum can in some instances be counteracted\r\nand overpowered. The influences in the personality of the father and of\r\nthe mother, which during fertilization find expression in the\r\nqualitative constitution of the sperm and of the ovum, respectively, can\r\nthus bring about a resultant tendency, acting in one direction or the\r\nother with varying force. Thus, after fertilization, we have this\r\nresultant tendency toward the formation of a male or female embryo.\r\n\r\nBut, _Düsing_ continues, at this time the sex is not definitely\r\ndetermined. The influence of the nutritive condition in which the\r\nfertilized ovum finds itself has yet to make itself felt. This influence\r\non the determination of sex through the maternal nutrition, continues\r\n(in the human embryo) for as long as three months, but even when the\r\nreproductive organs of the embryo have definitely begun to diverge in\r\nthe direction of the masculine or the feminine type, as the case may be,\r\nsome nutritive influence, if it is sufficiently powerful, may yet turn\r\nthe balance in the other direction, so that a partial or complete\r\nhermaphrodite results, a being uniting the characteristics of both\r\nsexes.\r\n\r\nActual inheritance of sex, of which people used to speak, cannot, in\r\n_Düsing’s_ opinion, possibly occur. The mode in which one sex or the\r\nother develops is indeed inherited; but the decision which sex shall\r\ndevelop does not depend upon inheritance, but is determined by the\r\nco-operation of several outward influences. The qualities by which this\r\nis effected are acquired by adaptation to general or special vital\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n_Wilckens_ (“A study of the Sexual Ratio and of the Causes of the\r\nDetermination of Sex in Domestic Animals”) opposes the views of Düsing,\r\non account of the results of his own investigations, relating to the\r\nbirths of 30,000 domestic animals. He formed the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n1. _Locality_ (soil and climate) has an influence upon the sexual ratio\r\nand upon the determination of sex in domestic animals, but this\r\ninfluence is probably indirect only, being exerted through the\r\nintermediation of the nutrition of the embryo _in utero_.\r\n\r\n2. _The season_ in which the domestic animal is conceived affects the\r\nsex; the hot season favours the production of males, the cold season\r\nthat of females; in the hot season, in general, the appetite and\r\nnutrition of domestic animals diminish, whereas in the cold season these\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n3. Regarding the _male progenitor_, neither his age, nor his sexual\r\nenergy, nor the demand made upon that energy, nor the age of the semen,\r\nhas any influence upon the sexual ratio or the determination of the sex\r\nof the offspring.\r\n\r\n4. The age of the _female progenitor_ influences the sexual ratio and\r\nthe determination of the sex of the offspring in this way, that in\r\ngeneral, primiparæ and young mothers conceive a larger number of female\r\noffspring. This influence of age may be referred to the fact that in\r\ngeneral young mothers nourish their offspring _in utero_ better than\r\nolder mothers.\r\n\r\n5. The _nutrition of the fruit in utero_ influences the determination of\r\nsex, speaking generally, in the following way, that better nutrition\r\nfavours the determination of the female sex, worse nutrition favours the\r\ndetermination of the male sex.\r\n\r\n6. In addition to the influence of nutrition of the fruit upon the\r\ndetermination of sex, _other influences_, whose nature still remains\r\n_obscure_, must also co-operate, because one and the same progenitor in\r\nsimilar nutritive conditions does not always procreate offspring of the\r\nsame sex.\r\n\r\n7. Owing to the operation of these _unknown influences_, prediction of\r\nthe sex of the offspring, and voluntary determination of the sex of the\r\noffspring, remain impossible. All we can say is that there is some\r\nprobability that young and well-nourished mothers will procreate a\r\ncomparatively larger number of female offspring, whilst elderly and\r\nill-nourished mothers will procreate a comparatively larger number of\r\nmale offspring.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _II. Anatomical Investigations._\r\n\r\nOf anatomical investigations and discoveries, those more especially\r\nrelating to the sex-relationships of twins and triplets have been\r\napplied to the elucidation of the problem of the determination of sex.\r\n\r\nThe first and most important fact in this connection, one that is not\r\nmerely a rule confirmed again and again by anatomists and gynecologists,\r\nbut is further, as _Mayrhofer_ has demonstrated as a result of his\r\nresearches in _von Braun’s_ clinic, a “natural law,” is this, that twins\r\nand triplets enclosed in a common chorion are invariably of the same\r\nsex. The sex-identity of such twins has been referred to the similarity\r\nof their nutritive conditions (_Leuckart_, _Ploss_), and more especially\r\nto the communication between their bloodvessels; and an intimate\r\nconnection between these relationships and the determination of sex has\r\nbeen believed to exist.\r\n\r\n_Mayrhofer_, however, opposes this assumption by the following\r\ndeductions (“The Determination of Sex in the Human Species”); “Fœtuses\r\nenclosed within a single chorion always possess a common placenta, in\r\nwhich the blood-channels from both umbilical cords frequently, in the\r\ncase of twins perhaps invariably, communicate. It might therefore be\r\nsupposed that the sex-identity of embryos enclosed within a single\r\nchorion is due to the intermixture of their blood in the placenta.\r\n_Hyrtl_, however, describes a triplet’s placenta, in which, though all\r\nthree fœtuses were enclosed within a single chorion, the vessels passing\r\nto the umbilical cord of one of the fœtuses were entirely distinct from\r\nthe vascular area common to the two other fœtuses; it is therefore\r\nprobable that in the case also of twins enclosed within a single chorion\r\nthere is not _necessarily_ any communication between their bloodvessels\r\nin the common placenta. But even if it were proved that in the case of\r\ntwins enclosed within a single chorion their bloodvessels always do\r\ncommunicate in the common placenta, we could not therefore infer that\r\nthe intermixture of the blood of the two fœtuses is the cause of their\r\nsexual identity.\r\n\r\n“For the intermixture of the blood of the two fœtuses in the common\r\nplacenta could never lead to a complete identity in the composition of\r\nthe blood of the two; it could only lead to a diminution of the\r\ndifferences which would exist between the bloods if their placental\r\ncirculations were entirely distinct, and the similarity in the bloods\r\nthus established could not be expected to do more than make it a general\r\nrule that such twins or triplets should be of the same sex; but to this\r\nrule exceptions might be expected to occur in certain cases, as when\r\nhæmatopoiesis in the two (or three) fœtuses was very different, or when\r\nthe circulation through the intercommunicating bloodvessels was\r\ninterfered with through the pressure of fibrinous deposits—differences\r\nbetween the bloods would then arise sufficient to cause differences in\r\nsex (if identical composition of the bloods is presumed to be the cause\r\nof the sexual identity).\r\n\r\n“Experience teaches us that the existence of communicating vessels in\r\nthe placenta does not suffice to induce a close similarity of growth and\r\nof the formation of the organs in twin fœtuses; nor does it prevent the\r\nillness and death of one fœtus leaving the health of the other\r\nundisturbed, although the communicating channels remain open; so that,\r\nif we except acardiac monsters, it is correct to say that each fœtus\r\npursues a secluded life, uninfluenced by the life of its neighbour.\r\nAcardiac monsters, on the other hand, always receive blood which has\r\nalready served for the nutrition of the normal fœtus, and the result of\r\nthis is an arrested development and a striking preponderance of\r\nconnective tissue in the acardiac twin. But notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat the failure of its own proper circulation (which is indeed rendered\r\npossible by the existence of the communicating vessels in the placenta)\r\nleads to its defective nutrition with a blood inferior to that supplied\r\nto the normal fœtus, the acardiac monster is always of the same sex as\r\nthe normal twin.”\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations _Mayrhofer_ rightly infers that the identity\r\nof sex of two fœtuses contained in a single chorion, since it does not\r\ndepend upon the existence of communicating vessels in the placenta, must\r\narise from a developmental tendency already existing in the two germs at\r\nthe time of conception—or, in other words, that at the time of\r\nconception their sex is already inalterably determined.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion with respect to the sex of twins contained in a single\r\nchorion may very readily be extended to the inference that in the case\r\nof all human fœtuses the sex is already determined at the time of\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nAnother anatomical fact is that many twins are contained in a single\r\nchorion for this reason, that they originate from two germinal vesicles\r\nwithin a single ovum. It is an open question whether it is not possible\r\nfor two embryos contained in separate chorions to come to lie in a\r\nsingle chorion through atrophy of the intermediate wall. If this is\r\nindeed possible, the invariable identity of sex in the case of fœtuses\r\nlying in a single chorion must lead us to agree with _Mayrhofer_ in\r\ninferring that two ova lying within a single follicle, simultaneously\r\nfertilized, give rise to embryos of identical sex.\r\n\r\n_B. S. Schultze_ and _Ahlfeld_, as a result of the investigations\r\nregarding twins, also came to the conclusion that the sexual identity of\r\ntwins depends upon their derivation from a single ovum. If, in\r\naccordance with what has been said above, an explanation of the sexual\r\nidentity of certain twins is to be found in the fact that for such twins\r\nthere has been a single conception only, and hence the influence,\r\nwhatever it may be, by which sex is determined acts on both germs at the\r\nsame time—still the sexual identity of twins in general is remarkable\r\nand has not yet been fully explained. The sexual identity in fact occurs\r\nmuch more frequently than appears to correspond to the percentage of\r\ntwins derived from a single ovum. _Von Fricks_ examined the data\r\nrelating to multiple births in Prussia during the period of 1826 to 1879\r\nand compiled the following table:\r\n\r\n ══════════════╤═════════════╤═════════════╤═════════════╤═════════════\r\n   Per Cent.   │   Twins.    │  Triplets.  │Quadruplets. │Quintuplets.\r\n ──────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n Boys only     │         32.6│         24.5│         14.3│         33.3\r\n Girls only    │         30.3│         22.5│         19.4│\r\n Boys and girls│         37.1│         53.0│         66.3│         66.7\r\n ──────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n               │  2 B. 1 G.  │         28.5│             │\r\n               │  1 B. 2 G.  │         24.5│             │\r\n ──────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n               │             │  2 B. 2 G.  │         23.4│\r\n               │             │  3 B. 1 G.  │         19.5│\r\n               │             │  1 B. 3 G.  │         23.4│\r\n ──────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────\r\n               │             │             │  4 B. 1 G.  │         33.3\r\n               │             │             │  3 B. 2 G.  │         33.3\r\n ══════════════╧═════════════╧═════════════╧═════════════╧═════════════\r\n\r\nAccording to _Ahlfeld_, of twin births in general, the ratio of those\r\nwith a common chorion to those with separate chorions is 1 : 8.15. If,\r\nhowever, we wished to explain the frequency with which twins are of\r\nidentical sex from the occurrence of such twins derived from a single\r\novum, we should expect to find a very different ratio, namely, 1 : 3.84;\r\nthat is to say, twins with a common chorion would have to be nearly\r\nthree times as common as they actually are. From these facts _Düsing_\r\nendeavours to draw the conclusion that external conditions have an\r\ninfluence upon the determination of sex, for very many external\r\nconditions are identical in the case of twins; as, for instance, the age\r\nof the father, the age of the mother, the nutritive conditions of the\r\nova and of the spermatozoa, the nutrition of the embryo, etc.—all of\r\nthese would influence both the twins in the same direction. A difference\r\nin the sex of twins, on the other hand, might be due to two successive\r\nfertilizations.\r\n\r\n_B. S. Schultze_ has been led by his embryological studies to the\r\nconclusion that there are male and female ova. Thus he believes that\r\nsexually identical twins originate from a single ovum with two germinal\r\nvesicles, thus assuming that a double fertilization of such ova is\r\npossible. But since in such cases the sexes of the resulting twins are\r\nalways identical the spermatozoon can have no influence upon the\r\ndetermination of sex, but the conditions leading to the development of\r\none sex or the other must pre-exist in the ovum—_i. e._, there must be\r\nmale and female ova.\r\n\r\nThat as a matter of actual fact in some cases the female progenitor\r\nexercises an overwhelming influence on the determination of sex, and\r\nthat the opinion held by so many that this determination depends upon\r\nthe mother alone is sometimes supported by facts, is shown by the\r\nincident recorded by _Darwin_ (“Descent of Man,” Vol. I.), that an Arab\r\nmare was delivered seven times successively of a filly, never of a colt,\r\nalthough she was covered by seven different stallions. On the other\r\nhand, the circumstance, if it is not to be attributed to pure chance,\r\ncan also be explained by the constitutional vigour of this mare\r\n(_Hensen_) without adopting the above hypothesis.\r\n\r\nRecently _Upjohn_ has maintained that there are two kinds of\r\nspermatozoa, male and female; the latter are the commonest, but the\r\nformer are the more energetic.\r\n\r\nAn interesting anatomical fact bearing upon this question has been\r\ndiscovered by _M. Nussbaum_, namely, that in ascaris megalocephala the\r\nreproductive glands are indicated already before the separation of the\r\ngerminal layers; and _Nussbaum_ suggests that this is also the case in\r\nall animals, although the proof cannot be obtained in every instance.\r\n\r\n_Semper_ has shown also in the case of some of the plagiostomata that\r\nlong before the beginning of the definitive development of the\r\nreproductive organs, the apparently hermaphrodite embryo already\r\npossesses at least the tendency toward the constitution of one sex or\r\nthe other. For in these animals, at a time so early that as yet the\r\nreproductive glands exhibit no sexual differentiation whatever, the\r\nsexes can nevertheless be distinguished by what appears to be a\r\nsecondary sexual character. In the female, namely, one ovary only is\r\ndeveloped; and very early indeed in the embryos destined to become\r\nfemales we can observe an asymmetrical development of the two germinal\r\nfurrows. By this characteristic the two sexes can be distinguished far\r\nearlier than it is possible to do so by the recognition of a\r\nhistological differentiation of the reproductive glands.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Mayrhofer_ the prepotency of the male gives rise to the\r\nprocreation of an excess of males in this way, that physical prosperity\r\nof the male probably leads to the generation of boys, whereas prosperity\r\nof the female tends to give rise to the generation of girls. Moreover,\r\neconomizing of the semen by infrequent sexual intercourse tends to\r\noriginate offspring of the male sex. In this connection _Hensen_\r\nremarks, apropos of the greater excess of male offspring among the Jews:\r\n“We might ask whether, in consequence of the comparative sexual\r\ncontinence of the Jews which demands a definite power of endurance on\r\nthe part of the ova, there may not be effected a certain selection of\r\nthe ova; and thus we may perhaps explain how it is that in this race an\r\nexceptional vigour is somewhat more often to be observed than in other\r\nraces.” _Bock_ assumes that “thinner semen,” such as results from more\r\nfrequent sexual intercourse, favours the procreation of the female sex,\r\nwhereas when intercourse is less frequent a larger number of boys is\r\nlikely to be born. _Janke_ indicates as two important fundamental\r\nprinciples of scientific physiology that, (1) sexual intercourse\r\nrepresents as it were a contest between the two parties to the sexual\r\nact as to which shall transmit his or her sexual influence to the child,\r\nthe victor in the contest determining the sex of the offspring, and (2)\r\nthat a crossed inheritance occurs, inasmuch as whichever progenitor\r\nproves stronger in this contest transmits to the child the sex other\r\nthan his or her own. He therefore advises women who long to have a boy\r\nto drink a glass of champagne before fulfilling their conjugal duties in\r\norder to gain increased sexual vigour.\r\n\r\n_Fiquet_ also expresses the opinion that when a vigorous, passionate,\r\nand sanguine male progenitor has intercourse with a frigid and\r\nphlegmatic woman there will be a preponderant tendency for the offspring\r\nto be female; whereas, when the conditions are the opposite of these,\r\nthe male progenitor being phlegmatic and cold, the female on the\r\ncontrary sanguine, passionate, and ardent, the offspring will probably\r\nbe of the male sex.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to these opinions of _Fiquet_ and _Janke_, to the effect\r\nthat the temperament and the sexual vigour of the progenitors have a\r\ndetermining influence in the origination of the sex of the offspring,\r\n_Düsing_ insists that the quality of the reproductive products are alone\r\ninfluential. _Düsing_ lays down the following proposition: “The greater\r\nthe scarcity of individuals of one sex is, the more extensive\r\nconsequently the demands made upon the sexual capacities of the\r\nindividuals of that sex, the more rapidly their reproductive products\r\nare employed; and the younger these products therefore are when employed\r\nthe more individuals of their own sex will appear among the offspring.”\r\n\r\n_Richarz_ believes, on the contrary, that the prepotency of the male\r\ngives rise to the procreation of more girls; a mother of high\r\nreproductive capacity will have more boys, one of less reproductive\r\ncapacity, on the other hand, more girls.\r\n\r\n_Starkweather_ (“The Law of Sex,” London, 1883) states his view in the\r\nproposition: “The superior parent produces the opposite sex;” and he\r\nholds the quaint view that this superiority is displayed in certain\r\nanatomical characters of the face of the progenitor. He endeavours from\r\nthe shape of the head and from the facial expression to deduce the\r\nsuperiority of the male and the female progenitor respectively. A high,\r\nsquare forehead, with prominent supra-ciliary ridges, constitutes,\r\naccording to _Starkweather_, one of the principal symptoms of this\r\nsuperiority; important also are a strongly developed middle third to the\r\nnose, narrow lips, etc. He declares that in families known to him the\r\npossession of this Roman nose in the father is signalized by the\r\npossession also of a large number of daughters, while a Roman-nosed\r\nmother has many sons. The more the parents’ noses resemble each other\r\nthe more equal will be the distribution of the sexes among the\r\noffspring. He connects this fact (!) also with the fact that the\r\npossessor of the aquiline nose is the ruler of the family. Men of great\r\nstrength of character procreate chiefly daughters; women, on the other\r\nhand, with a powerful character and a firm will bring into the world a\r\nnotable excess of boys. In the Southern States of the American union\r\n_Starkweather_ found confirmation of his theory, since he observed there\r\nthat among the offspring of white fathers and coloured mothers there was\r\nan excess of girls amounting to 12 to 15 per cent. Among the half-castes\r\nof Java, the so-called Lipplapps, in the third generation girls only are\r\nborn, and these are sterile. The excess of girls in these cases depends\r\nupon the superiority of the white father; this superiority is\r\ntransmitted to the few sons of the second generation, and these\r\ntherefore procreate girls only to constitute the third generation; the\r\nlatter are not powerful enough to bear children at all.\r\n\r\n_Roth_ has revived the old view that one ovary provides the germs for\r\nthe male offspring, the other those for the female offspring. He\r\nbelieves further that in the process of cohabitation the mechanical\r\nimpressions and stimuli received by one-half of the external genital\r\norgans, reinforced by contact with and pulling on the pubic hair, are\r\ntransmitted through the pudic nerve and the hypogastric plexus to the\r\ncorresponding half of the vagina and the uterus, to the Fallopian tube\r\nof that side and to the corresponding ovary. If, now, we can consider it\r\nas established (?), that in the human female one ovary discharges male\r\nova only and the other female ova only, it seems to him that it is the\r\ncorresponding half of the external genital organs, when specifically\r\nstimulated in sexual intercourse, and the consequently increased vital\r\nactivity in the pudic nerve and its connections with the hypogastric\r\nplexus, that must be regarded as the organ by means of which sex is\r\ndetermined. _Roth_ has also been informed by laymen that when for some\r\ntime they have procreated daughters only they subsequently procreated\r\nsons, “when, having been accustomed to sleep on one side of their wife,\r\nthey adopted the practice of sleeping on the other.”\r\n\r\n_Ricardi_ reports that in Modena the peasants say that a man whose wife\r\nhas hitherto had daughters only, must, if he wishes to have a son,\r\nassume some other posture than usual in the performance of coitus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _III. Experimental Investigations._\r\n\r\nA considerable number of years ago, _Thury_ attacked the problem of the\r\ndetermination of sex by the experimental method. In his series of\r\nexperiments he ascertained, using 29 cows, that in the case of 22 of\r\nthese, which were served early in their heat, the calves were without\r\nexception heifers, while in the case of the remaining 7, which were\r\nserved late in their heat, the calves were equally without exception\r\nbull-calves (_Thury_, “The Law of the Determination of the Sexes,”\r\nLeipzig, 1863); in the record of these experiments no mention is made of\r\nthe age of the cows. _Thury_ concluded that the sex was determined\r\naccording to the fertilization of the ovum soon or late after its\r\nliberation from the ovary; namely, that an ovum fertilized soon after\r\nits discharge produced a female, whilst an ovum which had become\r\ncomparatively old before it was fertilized became a male.\r\n\r\n_Thury’s_ sensational experiments gave rise to a succession of similar\r\nexperiments, made mostly by cattle-breeders, above all in agricultural\r\ncolleges and in stud-farms.\r\n\r\nSome of these experiments were made in the agricultural colleges at\r\nProskau and Eldera. The cows, which according to _Thury’s_ views should\r\nhave been delivered of heifers, were served as soon as their heat was\r\nobserved (the heat lasted as a rule from 24 to 30 hours); these were\r\ndelivered of 5 heifers and 5 bull-calves (in Proskau) and of 3 heifers\r\nand 5 bull-calves (in Eldera); the sexual ratio in these cases was\r\ntherefore normal. On the other hand, cows which were not served until\r\ntheir heat had lasted for 20 hours were delivered (in Proskau) of 1\r\nheifer and 4 bull-calves.\r\n\r\nFurther experiments (in Waldau) gave the result that cows served early\r\nwere delivered of 1 heifer and 1 bull-calf. In another series (in\r\nEldera) 9 cows served as soon as heat was observed (or, speaking\r\nstrictly, in from ½ to 1½ hours of this), gave birth to 7 heifers and 2\r\nbull-calves.\r\n\r\nExperiments made at the Royal Friedrich Wilhelm Stud-Farm gave the\r\nfollowing results: In the case of 20 mares, which if _Thury’s_ theory\r\nhad been correct should all have given birth to fillies, 11 only\r\nfulfilled this expectation; but 10, on the other hand, were colts.\r\n_Touchon_, in his experiments at Hohenhau, obtained 11 calves and 2\r\nfoals, exhibiting the sex expected in accordance with _Thury’s_ theory.\r\n\r\n_Düsing_ made a compilation of the figures given in all the experiments\r\nmade to test _Thury’s_ theory, with the following results: Cows\r\nfertilized early were delivered of 13 bull-calves and 29 heifers; mares\r\nfertilized early were delivered of 10 colts and 13 fillies; cows\r\nfertilized late were delivered of 5 bull-calves and 2 heifers.\r\n\r\n_Gerbe_ made experiments on rabbits, putting the buck to some\r\ndoe-rabbits soon after the beginning of their heat, but to others as\r\nlate as possible in their heat. On examining the young in the horns of\r\nthe uterus, from the ovary downward, the distribution of the sexes was\r\nfound to be approximately equal.\r\n\r\nWhilst _Coste’s_ experiments on a hen gave results contradictory to\r\n_Thury’s_ theory, _Albini’s_ experiments, made also on the common fowl,\r\ngave results in agreement with that theory. He found that the hens began\r\nagain to lay fertilized eggs 3 to 6 days after intercourse with the cock\r\n(from which they had previously been kept separate); on the average, the\r\ndistribution of the sexes in the chickens hatched from these eggs was\r\napproximately equal, with, however, a slight preponderance of cock\r\nbirds. On the ninth and tenth days after separation from the cock the\r\neggs laid were half fertilized and half unfertilized; on the twelfth day\r\nafter separation from the cock the unfertilized eggs were in a great\r\nmajority; but even as late as the eighteenth day after separation some\r\nof the eggs laid were still fertilized. The fertilized eggs laid from\r\nthe tenth to the fifteenth day after separation when incubated produced\r\na great preponderance of hen birds.\r\n\r\nWe have to thank breeders for a large number of experiments, such as\r\nthose made by the breeder _Fiquet_, at Houston in Texas, who found that\r\na bull upon whose sexual capacities excessive demands were made,\r\nprocreated bull-calves exclusively; whereas in herds containing numerous\r\nbulls there were found among the calves born a preponderance of heifers.\r\nIn thirty experiments on cattle _Fiquet_ always found that the larger\r\nthe number of cows a bull had to serve, and the longer they were kept in\r\nservice, the larger was the proportion of bull-calves among their\r\noffspring. On the other hand, if certain cows had their sexual desires\r\nfirst satisfied by a gelded animal and were then served by a vigorous\r\nand lusty bull, an excessive proportion of heifers was born to these\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n_Janke_ obtained similar results in the breeding of sheep. In a report\r\nmade to _Düsing_ he states that in the early part of the lambing season\r\nmore ewe-lambs are born than rams; in the latter part of the lambing\r\nseason, on the contrary, more rams than ewes. The explanation he gives\r\nis that at the commencement of the pairing the rams are fresh and lusty,\r\nwhilst later their potency is comparatively exhausted. In stud-farms,\r\naccording to the same observer, it is a familiar experience that the\r\nmost vigorous stallions serving a mare in the morning commonly procreate\r\na filly; but if later in the day they serve a second mare they almost\r\nalways procreate a colt. This, he thinks, finds its explanation in the\r\nfact that the stallion, when he serves the second mare, is in a\r\ncondition of comparative sexual exhaustion, the more so because he\r\nusually covers the first mare twice.\r\n\r\n_Maritegoute’s_ breeding experiments at the sheep-farm of Blanc\r\n(Haut-Garonne), on the other hand, gave divergent results. In the early\r\npart of the pairing season, as long as the ram’s sexual powers were\r\ncompletely unimpaired, he procreated more male than female lambs. But\r\nwhen a few days later a great number of the ewes were simultaneously on\r\nheat and the ram, owing to very frequent acts of intercourse, began to\r\nbe sexually exhausted, the procreation of female lambs was in excess.\r\nBut when, finally, this period of maximum demands upon the ram’s powers\r\nwas past, and the number of ewes on heat became once more small, the\r\nprocreation of male lambs in preference to female was again observed.\r\n\r\nThe data obtained by _Düsing_ from the Prussian stud-farms, in which,\r\nwhen greater sexual demands were made on the stallions, more males were\r\nprocreated, have been already mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Fiquet_ made interesting experiments on cows and believed that in this\r\nway he was able to demonstrate the influence of nutrition upon the\r\ndetermination of sex—to such a degree, indeed, that he believed it was\r\npossible to breed calves of either sex at will. The following method\r\ngave him positive results in more than thirty instances. He never had\r\nthe cow served by the bull at the first heat, but only at the second (if\r\na cow is left unserved when on heat, the heat recurs after an interval\r\nof three weeks). The interval of three weeks was utilized in the\r\npreparation of cow and bull for the copulatory act. If a bull-calf was\r\nwanted the cow was supplied with the most invigorating fodder and was\r\nkept on the richest pasture available. The bull, on the other hand, that\r\nwas to serve this cow was turned out to graze on the poorest pasture and\r\nwas given poor fodder. At the end of the three weeks, when the cow came\r\non heat for the second time, its sexual appetite was as intense as\r\npossible, whereas the bull showed but slight inclination to the sexual\r\nact. If the bull now served the cow a bull-calf was procreated. The\r\nopposite procedure led to the procreation of a heifer. For this purpose\r\n_Fiquet_ kept the cow on low diet during the interval between the first\r\nand second heats, and had her first served by a castrated animal. When\r\nin this way, and by the low diet, the sexual appetite of the cow had\r\nbeen sufficiently diminished, it was served by a lusty bull, which for a\r\nlong time had not been put to any cow, and the sexual potency of which\r\nhad been increased to the uttermost by feeding it for several weeks on\r\nthe most invigorating fodder.\r\n\r\nThe results of these experiments, according to which the nutrition of\r\nthe parent-animals before the copulatory act has an influence upon the\r\ndetermination of sex, is explained by _Düsing_ in this way, that\r\nnutrition influences also the quality of the reproductive products.\r\n“Poor nutrition gives rise to diminished functional capacity of the\r\ngenital apparatus. Thus, for example, the production of semen is\r\nlessened. It can, in fact, hardly be replaced as quickly as it is used\r\nup. This occurs when there is a lack of adequate means of subsistence,\r\nand also when there is a lack of comparatively young males. In both\r\ncases alike we trace the effects in the birth of an excess of males.\r\nConverse conditions give rise to an excess of female offspring.”\r\n\r\nPassing now to consider investigations made by physiologists, _Born_, at\r\nthe anatomical institute at Breslau, has endeavoured to solve the\r\nproblem of the determination of sex by means of experiment. He employed\r\nfor this purpose _rana fusca_, an animal with which positive results can\r\nbe obtained in a comparatively short period of time. He examined the sex\r\nboth of the frogs in the free state (165), and also of larvæ which he\r\nhad bred in specially arranged aquaria. Whereas among the frogs\r\ndeveloping in the open, the numbers of the sexes appeared to be\r\napproximately equal (there was an excess of females amounting to 2 or 3\r\nper cent.); among those bred in the aquaria there was an enormous\r\npreponderance of females (96 per cent.). This remarkable result is\r\nreferred by _Born_ to the inadequate supply of nutriment in the case of\r\nthe larvæ bred by him (he fed them on hydræ and on putrefying frog and\r\ntadpole meat); from an examination of the alimentary canal of tadpoles\r\ncaught in the open _Born_ ascertained that their normal food was the mud\r\nof the pools in which they were hatched, containing infusoria,\r\nradiolariæ, diatoms, algæ, etc. The accuracy of this explanation\r\nappeared to _Born_ to be more convincingly shown by the results in the\r\ncase of one of his twenty-one aquaria. In this one alone the percentage\r\nof males was as high as 28 per cent., and the tadpoles in this attained\r\nthe same size as those developed under natural conditions in the open,\r\nwhilst in all the other aquaria the tadpoles remained abnormally small.\r\nThis particular aquarium, owing to an oversight, had pond-mud on its\r\nfloor, whilst all the other aquaria were floored with clean sand.\r\n\r\n_A. von Griesheim_ disputes _Born’s_ results and believes that the\r\nlatter, determining the sex of the tadpoles by means of a hand lens,\r\nmust have mistaken a great many female tadpoles for males. He himself,\r\nby repeated enumerations of a large number of tadpoles (685), part\r\ncaught in the open and part taken from a large aquarium, found that the\r\nratio between the sexes in the case of _rana fusca_ was regularly 36.7\r\nmales to 63.3 per cent. females.\r\n\r\n_E. Pflüger_ refers the divergence between _Born’s_ results and his own\r\nand those of _von Griesheim_ not to any error made by _Born_ in the\r\ndiagnosis of the sex of the tadpoles, but to the fact that in the\r\nlatter’s aquaria the mortality of the male tadpoles was probably greater\r\nthan that of the females. _Pflüger_ endeavoured to ascertain whether the\r\nconcentration of the semen might have an influence in the determination\r\nof sex. A quantity of frog-spawn was fertilized with concentrated semen,\r\ntaken direct from the seminal vesicles, and another quantity of spawn\r\nwas fertilized with diluted semen, obtained by making an aqueous extract\r\nof the incised testicles. The ratio between the sexes in the case of the\r\ntwo lots of tadpoles, which were kept in separate aquaria, proved,\r\nhowever, to be mathematically identical. But another experiment showed\r\nthat the number of males was very different, according to the kind or\r\nrace from which the animals were derived. He therefore believes that for\r\nthe character of the development of the reproductive organs, the race of\r\nthe parent animals is determinative. There is very little likelihood of\r\nbeing able to modify this inherited sexual ratio by means of outward\r\ninfluences affecting the ova and the ripe semen prior to fertilization,\r\nand just as little by means of a number of abnormal influences (change\r\nof climate, of water, of nutriment, etc.) acting on the fertilized ova.\r\n\r\n_Düsing_,—who in his work on “The Regulation of the Sexual Ratio” (Jena,\r\n1884) most ingeniously advocates the thesis that all animals have the\r\npower, when there is a lack of individuals of one sex, of procreating an\r\nexcess of individuals of this deficient sex, or, to put it in another\r\nway, that an excess of one sex determines the procreation of an excess\r\nof the other sex,—instituted experimental investigations regarding the\r\ndetermination of sex in the following manner (in accordance with a\r\nsuggestion made by _Pflüger_): About ninety guinea-pigs were distributed\r\nin two pens in such a way that in one pen there was a great deficiency\r\nof males and a great excess of females, whilst in the other there was a\r\ndeficiency of females and an excess of males. Thus the sexual ratios in\r\nthe two stalls were opposed. In accordance with _Düsing’s_ theory,\r\ntherefore, more males should have been born in the first pen and more\r\nfemales in the second pen. Every week each pen was examined once or\r\ntwice, the sex of the new-born young was ascertained, and they were\r\ndistinguished by small incisions in the margin of the ear. A week later,\r\nwhen the young animals had developed a little further, they were\r\nre-examined to make sure that no mistake had been made.\r\n\r\nAt first, in the pen containing the original excess of females, there\r\noccurred a quite remarkable excess of male births. This, however, was\r\nmerely the result of chance, for soon the relationships of the sexes\r\namong the new born was reversed, and thenceforward many more females\r\nwere born than males. But if all the births occurring in this experiment\r\nare taken into consideration the number is still far too small to allow\r\ntrustworthy conclusions to be drawn.\r\n\r\n_Düsing_ emphasizes the fact that such an experiment as this, in order\r\nto furnish results worth consideration, must be continued until the\r\nsexual ratio has become constant, so that it is no longer subject to\r\nalteration by chance variations. If we assume that _Düsing’s_ theory is\r\nfalse, the results obtained would be the following: In both the pens, in\r\nthat in which there was originally an excess of females and in that in\r\nwhich there was originally an excess of males, the births, if observed\r\nthrough a sufficient period, would present a definite sexual ratio which\r\nwould be the same in both the pens. But if the theory is well founded\r\nthe sexual ratio of the new born would vary in the two pens: in the\r\nstall in which there had originally been a deficiency of males there\r\nwould be an excess of births of males over females; whereas in the pen\r\nin which there had originally been a deficiency of females there would\r\non the contrary be an excess of births of females over males. _Düsing_\r\nrecommends that for such experiments even more fruitful animals, such as\r\nrats and mice, should be utilized.\r\n\r\nInstitutes for pisciculture would also be extremely suitable for such\r\nexperiments in breeding for the determination of the matter under\r\ndiscussion because, owing to the fact that in these animals\r\nfertilization is effected outside of the body of the parents, a direct\r\nexamination of the ova and the semen used in the experiments can be\r\nundertaken, and the fertilization can be made to occur under conditions\r\nsubjected to various alterations; also we can employ the roe and the\r\nsperm of fishes whose age, life history, weight and size are accurately\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nMuch attention has recently been paid to the theory of _Schenk_, based,\r\nas he states, upon numerous experiments regarding the influences by\r\nwhich sex is determined. This observer also starts from the principle\r\nthat ovulation is not independent of the influences of nutrition and\r\nmetabolism. He believes that in the cases in which combustion in the\r\nbody is effected in such a manner that remnants of unconsumed\r\nsubstances, still capable of heat-production, make their appearance in\r\nthe urine, the ovum of the human female in process of formation is not\r\nso far advanced in its development as it is in cases in which the urine\r\nis entirely free from sugar, or at any rate is free from any\r\ndemonstrable traces of the presence of this body. In the former case we\r\nshall find that the ovum is not only less mature, but also that it is\r\npresumably less well nourished. In his view such an ovum is less\r\ncompletely endowed in respect of the indwelling qualities and forces of\r\nits protoplasm, and it appears for this reason to be adapted only for\r\nthe development of a female individual. But when, on the contrary, in\r\nthe maternal individual, all the substances formed in and assimilated by\r\nthe organism have undergone combustion so completely that there is no\r\nsugar in the urine, not even in the minutest discernible traces, the\r\nmaternal body is in a condition suitable for the development of an ovum\r\nadapted to become a male individual. From these inferences, weak though\r\nthe chain of argument is, _Schenk_ draws the conclusion, that by the\r\nregulation of the nutritive material supplied to the organism, and by\r\nthe suitable choice of that material, we are to a considerable extent\r\nenabled to support an ovum in its process of maturation in such a manner\r\nas to cause it to develop into a male individual.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive material selected for this purpose must be of such a\r\nnature that the elimination in the urine of even the minutest quantities\r\nof sugar may be prevented; the urine must appear free from sugar even\r\nwhen the phenyl-hydrazine test is employed. Thus in every case in which\r\nwe wish to influence a woman’s nutrition in such a way as to lead to the\r\nprocreation of a male individual we must above all ascertain whether, in\r\nthe woman in question, the normal quantity of sugar is present in the\r\nurine. If after the most careful examination no trace of sugar can be\r\nfound in the urine, and if reducing substances are present in this\r\nexcretion in abundance, no change need be made in the diet, and all we\r\nhave to do is to recommend that the requisite fertilization should be\r\neffected as soon as possible, since there is every probability that in\r\nthis condition the embryo will prove to be of the male sex. But when, on\r\nthe other hand the “normal” quantity of sugar is present in the urine,\r\nor when even traces only of that substance can be detected, it is\r\nnecessary by changes in the diet to cause the disappearance from the\r\nurine of every trace of sugar, and at the same time to bring about the\r\nappearance in that fluid of an abundance of reducing substances.\r\n_Schenk_ claims by the experiments he has made along these lines to have\r\nobtained results which show that it is possible in this way to influence\r\nthe determination of sex.\r\n\r\nHis method is to nourish the mother mainly on nitrogenous materials and\r\nfat, and to give in addition only so much carbohydrate as is necessary\r\nto prevent the absence of this from being seriously felt. This diet\r\nshould be continued for a considerable period, at best for two or three\r\nmonths before the fertilization is effected. After conception also, the\r\nsame diet should be continued. In such a manner we are able in certain\r\ncases to bring about the procreation of male offspring. On the other\r\nhand, the desire for the procreation of female offspring remains one\r\nwhich as yet we have no direct means of fulfilling.\r\n\r\nThese vague experiments and ill-grounded theories of _Schenk’s_ do not,\r\nas a matter of fact, constitute an important advance in the theory of\r\nthe voluntary determination of the sex of the human offspring. What in\r\nreality are the decisive influences in the determination of sex, and how\r\nthe final impulsion in one direction or the other is actually effected,\r\nremain altogether obscure. Prediction of the sex of the offspring, and\r\nthe voluntary procreation of male or female infants, remain problems for\r\nthe solution of which the most essential data are still lacking.\r\n\r\n_Ernest Hæckel_ writes regarding _Schenk’s_ theory: “This important\r\n‘discovery,’ which at the time of its first announcement attracted\r\nthroughout the world an attention rarely given to true scientific\r\nadvances, has now dwindled to the incomplete demonstration that the\r\nnutritive condition of the mother exercises a certain influence upon the\r\ndetermination of the sex of the child. But we knew this much a long time\r\nago. _Düsing_ and others, partly by physiological experiments and partly\r\nby statistical demonstrations, had shown that changes in the quantity\r\nand the quality of the nutriment supplied to either parent is capable of\r\ninfluencing the procreation of boys or girls. But if what _Professor\r\nSchenk_ maintains were really true peoples living chiefly upon meat (as,\r\nfor instance, in the pampas of South America) should have an\r\nexceptionally large proportion of male offspring; whereas those living\r\nmainly on a proteid-free diet (on meal, sugar, and other carbohydrates),\r\nshould have an exceptionally large proportion of female offspring (as,\r\nfor example, the rice-eating Indian and Mongolian nations). But this is\r\nby no means the case. And many other well-known facts are likewise\r\nopposed to the ‘epoch-making’ theory of _Schenk_. Whether the fertilized\r\novum develops into a boy or a girl, depends, I am convinced, upon far\r\nmore complex, and to a large extent still entirely unknown,\r\nphysiological causes. The final judgment upon the ‘Schenk theory’ must\r\nbe, ‘Much Ado About Nothing.’”\r\n\r\nOur exposition of the present standpoint of the doctrine of the\r\norigination of sex in the human species, has, in fact, shown that\r\nhitherto by statistical work, nor by anatomical investigations, nor,\r\nfinally, by the experimental method, have results been obtained which\r\nrender it possible to predict the sex of the unborn infant. And even in\r\nrespect of the study of those influences which exercise a determining\r\ninfluence upon the origination of sex, no positive, indisputable\r\nconclusions have been reached. We can only say it appears probable that\r\nthere exist _several_ causes of the determination of sex the\r\n_co-operative_ action of which proves effectual. Not in the ovum alone,\r\nnor in the spermatozoon alone, but in the reciprocal influence they\r\nexert one upon the other in the act of conception is sex determined. In\r\nthe latter connection the relative and absolute ages of the progenitors\r\nappear to have a certain influence in the determination of the sex of\r\nthe embryo; of importance also is the greater or less demand made upon\r\nthe sexual capacity of the begetter; of influence too is the time at\r\nwhich the ovum is fertilized after its discharge from the ovary. It\r\nappears to be fairly well established that when the husband is at least\r\nten years older than the wife, while the latter is at the age at which a\r\nwoman’s reproductive powers are at a maximum, more boys are conceived\r\nthan girls (_Kisch_); also that one of the progenitors upon whose sexual\r\ncapacities the greater demands are made, tends to procreate an excess of\r\nindividuals of his or her own sex (_Piquet_, _Düsing_); and, finally,\r\nthat intercourse a considerable time after the cessation of the\r\nmenstrual flow (in the second week of the intermenstrual interval or\r\nlater) is favourable to the procreation of a male infant (_Thury_,\r\n_Hensen_). The influence of nutritive conditions in the determination of\r\nsex is less clearly established.\r\n\r\nStatistical evidence has proved beyond dispute that given a sufficiently\r\nlarge number of instances in varying conditions the sexual ratio is 106,\r\nand this fact suggests that the determination of sex is dependent upon\r\nthe interaction of two influences operating in opposite directions\r\nwithin narrow limits, in such a manner that the chances of the birth of\r\na male infant preponderate over the chances of the birth of a female\r\ninfant in the proportion of 106 to 100. In elucidation of this fact\r\n_Hensen_ makes the following comparison: “Let us imagine a balance the\r\nbeam of which has two arms of equal length; from the two extremities of\r\nthis beam two balls of nearly equal weight begin to roll toward one\r\nanother; if one ball rolls more quickly than the other, if one is\r\nlighter than the other, or if one starts to roll before the other, the\r\nopposite end of the beam will sink. The three influences are variously\r\ndistributed; one influence may reinforce another, or may counteract\r\nanother; but a decisive sinking of one end of the beam will always\r\nultimately ensue. A minimal shortening or lightening of one arm of the\r\nbalance will make the chance that the other arm will descend\r\ncorrespondingly greater.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          STERILITY IN WOMEN.\r\n\r\nWhen we study the history of human civilization we find that sterility\r\nin women is regarded, not merely as a misfortune, but as a reproach.\r\nAmong savage races, and in the Orient, where the position of women is\r\none of strict subordination, she does not attain an honourable status\r\nuntil she becomes a mother. In Persia, a sterile woman is always\r\ndivorced by her husband. In India, also, when a sterile married woman\r\nhas in vain employed the various religious measures advocated for the\r\nrelief of her barren condition she is sent back to her parents. Both in\r\nChina and Japan, a barren woman is regarded as a most miserable\r\ncreature. Among the negro races, a woman who fails to bear children is\r\nthe object of scorn and contempt. Among the Dualla negroes, a man whose\r\nwife fails to bear children demands from her parents the return of the\r\nsum which he paid for her at the time of marriage. Many of the\r\nindigenous tribes of South America also make a practice of divorcing a\r\nsterile wife. Among the better-class Circassians, the women do not\r\nattain an assured position until they have borne a child. In Angola a\r\nbarren woman is the object of universal contempt, and she often feels\r\nthe ignominy of her position so keenly that she commits suicide. Alike\r\namong the Jews and among the Turks, barrenness in a wife is a recognized\r\nground for divorce, and the woman who has been divorced for this reason\r\nwill hardly ever succeed in obtaining another husband, for she is\r\nregarded as one whose body is not properly developed. According to old\r\nGerman law, barrenness in a wife and impotence in a husband were both\r\ngrounds for divorce. The code of the Emperor Justinian allowed of\r\ndivorce in cases in which for the space of two years a husband had been\r\nunable to fulfil his marital duties, and such a union was termed\r\n_innuptæ nuptæ_. Among the ancient Romans, although they regarded\r\nbarrenness as a mark of the divine disfavour, according to the laws of\r\nAugustus failure to bear children was a punishable offence, and such a\r\npunishment was incurred by any married woman who had attained the age of\r\n20 years without having become a mother. In ancient Greece also,\r\ndivorces due to the barrenness of the wife were by no means uncommon.\r\nAmong the Slavonic peoples sterility was so greatly despised that there\r\nis a Slavonic proverb which runs: “A woman is no woman until she has\r\nborne a child”: and in Istria a sterile woman is known by the nickname\r\n“Scirke,” which is equivalent to “hermaphrodite.” The Jewish view of the\r\nmatter is expressed in the Talmudic rabbinical saying: “A wife’s duties\r\nare beauty, gentleness, and the bearing of children”; and again, “the\r\npoor, the leprous, the blind, and the childless, are like the dead”;\r\nand, finally, “he who refrains from marriage with the deliberate\r\nintention of having no children, incurs the guilt of murder.” In the\r\nKoran we find the fatalistic expression, “God makes a woman barren in\r\naccordance with his will.”\r\n\r\nWe can therefore readily understand that in the most ancient medical\r\nwritings the question of sterility in women is a matter of earnest\r\nconsideration. In the works of the early physicians of Hindustan we find\r\nseveral apt remarks on the subject. _Susruta_ says: “Pregnancy most\r\nreadily results from intercourse during menstruation. At this time the\r\nos uteri is open, like the flower of the water lily in the sunshine.” In\r\nthe Old Testament, in which the newly-created human couples receive the\r\ncommand, “Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth,” we find\r\nfrequent references to barrenness as a state equally dishonourable and\r\nunfortunate, and the use of certain plants is recommended as a means of\r\ncure. The Talmud contains several essays dealing with the causes and\r\ntreatment of sterility.\r\n\r\nThe _Hippocratic_ collection of writings contains a number of passages\r\ndealing with the causes of sterility and with the means to be employed\r\nfor its relief. We shall have occasion later to refer to these\r\nrecommendations. _Celsus_, on the other hand, has little to say on this\r\nsubject. In the works of _Pliny_, and also in those of _Aristotle_,\r\nthere are references to the topic of sterility.\r\n\r\nAmong the writers of the first century of our era, _Soranus_ discusses\r\nexhaustively the capacity for conception and sterility. In his work we\r\nfind, among other passages, the unquestionably accurate remark: “Since\r\nthe majority of marriages are concluded, not from love, but in order to\r\nprocreate children, it is difficult to understand why, in the choice of\r\na wife, less regard is paid to her probable fertility than to the\r\nworldly wealth of her parents.”\r\n\r\nIn the middle ages, _Paulus Agineta_ more especially treats of the\r\ndiseases of women, and among these, of sterility in women. That in\r\nArabian medicine much attention was paid to this question, we can learn\r\nfrom the writings of Maimonides.\r\n\r\nBy sterility in women we understand the pathological state in which a\r\nwoman who is sexually mature fails to conceive, notwithstanding\r\nfrequently repeated, normal sexual intercourse throughout a considerable\r\nperiod of time.\r\n\r\nSterility is termed _congenital_ (or _absolute_) when, notwithstanding\r\nrepeated intercourse throughout a long period (not less than three\r\nyears), pregnancy has always failed to ensue; it is termed _acquired_\r\n(or _relative_), when women who have already been pregnant once or more\r\noften, cease to conceive, although they are still quite young enough to\r\ndo so, and have experienced regular sexual intercourse for a long period\r\n(not less than three years). In a wider sense of the term, we say that a\r\nwoman is sterile, when, notwithstanding prolonged and repeated sexual\r\nintercourse, in circumstances favourable to procreation, she has failed\r\nto give birth to a living and viable infant.\r\n\r\nEnglish authors also make a special distinction regarding that form of\r\nacquired sterility (which is no great rarity), in which a woman gives\r\nbirth to a single infant and subsequently remains sterile (“_only-child\r\nsterility_”).\r\n\r\nThe civilization of the present day, with its shady side, has made it\r\nnecessary for us to pay an increasing attention to _facultative\r\nsterility_, dependent upon the use during intercourse of means for the\r\nprevention of conception; and very recently the surgical tendency of\r\nmodern gynecology has brought into being a new variety of sterility in\r\nwomen, viz., operative sterility.\r\n\r\nThe period which must elapse after marriage, before the absence of\r\npregnancy must lead us to regard a woman as sterile, is fixed at three\r\nyears. This limitation is based upon the statistical data which (see\r\nTable on page 368) I gave regarding 556 fruitful marriages.\r\n\r\nThe ideal state of fertility, that in which conception is the immediate\r\nresult of the first act of intercourse between husband and wife, the\r\nconception being followed in due course by the birth of a child, is,\r\nlike most other ideals, one very rarely attained. In the human species,\r\nconception as the immediate result of the first act of sexual\r\nintercourse, is an extremely unusual occurrence. To invoke medical\r\nassistance for women who have failed to conceive during the first three\r\nmonths of married life, which my experience shows to be more frequently\r\ndone now than formerly, is devoid of all justification; and still worse\r\nis it, in this period of “early love” to subject women, as has often\r\nbeen done recently by overenergetic gynecologists, to local treatment,\r\neven to the extent of operative procedures.\r\n\r\nWe are not justified in speaking of the existence of actual sterility\r\nuntil three years of marital intercourse have failed to result in\r\nconception; still, when the commencement of the first pregnancy is\r\ndelayed for more than sixteen months after marriage, there is\r\nconsiderable probability that the woman is sterile; and this probability\r\nincreases month by month till the expiry of the second year, whilst as\r\nthe end of the third year approaches, it becomes tantamount to\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nSterility is one of the commonest of the functional disorders of women,\r\nand one of those which most often demand gynecological assistance.\r\n\r\nBy a statistical study of the marriages of the royal and princely\r\nfamilies of Europe and of the marriages of the highest families of the\r\naristocracy, I learned that of 626 marriages, 70 were barren; thus the\r\nratio of fruitless to fruitful marriages proved to be as 1 : 8.87. But\r\nin other circles of society, in so far as data relating to the matter\r\nwere obtainable in my practice, the statistics of infertility were by no\r\nmeans so unfavourable, the ratio working out at about 1 barren to 10\r\nfruitful unions. I must point out, however, that these statistics, like\r\nall statistics of fertility, are to a degree invalidated by the fact\r\nthat in a certain number of the instances included among the barren, an\r\nunnoticed abortion may have occurred.\r\n\r\n_Simpson_, in his investigation regarding the frequency of sterile\r\nunions, found a ratio of 1 : 8.5 (in 1252 instances). In the English\r\naristocracy, where the marriages are for the most part restricted among\r\nthe members of a comparatively small number of families, the ratio was\r\n1 : 6.11 (495 instances); on the other hand, among the population of\r\nGrangemouth and Bathgate, consisting chiefly of persons engaged in\r\nseafaring and agricultural occupations, the ratio of barren to fruitful\r\nunions was as 1 : 10.5.\r\n\r\n_Spencer Wells_ and _Marion Sims_, as a result of their investigations,\r\ngive a ratio of 1 : 8.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Seeligmann_, in Hamburg, among marriages of persons in all\r\nclasses of society, 11.5% are barren. _Prochownick_ found among 2500\r\nwomen, all of whom had been married for eighteen months or more, and\r\nnone of whom were more than 40 years of age, that 9% had failed to\r\nconceive.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Frank_ and _Burdach_, who do not publish the figures upon\r\nwhich their estimate is based, only 1 marriage in 50 proves barren.\r\n_Lever_, who also gives merely his percentage result, states that 5% of\r\nmarried women are completely infertile. _Hedin_, dealing with a Swedish\r\ncommunity of 800 persons, states that the percentage of sterile unions\r\nis barely 10.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Goehlert’s_ statistical investigations, in the dynasty of\r\nthe Capets, among 450 marriages, 19.7% were sterile: in the Wittelsbach\r\ndynasty (Bavaria), among 177 marriages, 23.7% were sterile; and among\r\nthe ruling families of Germany (more than 600 marriages), 20.5% were\r\nsterile. In this investigation, however, no attention is paid to the age\r\nof husband or wife; marriages and remarriages are classed together\r\nwithout discrimination; and those marriages only in which a living child\r\nwas born are counted as fruitful, so that the unions counted as sterile\r\nmust contain many in which abortion or stillbirth occurred. In three\r\nEsthonian communities in Livonia, _Oehren_ found that among 2799\r\nmarriages, 8.4% were barren, but in this instance also stillbirths were\r\nignored.\r\n\r\n_Ansell_ reports that of 1919 marriages of women belonging to the upper\r\nclasses, their mean age being 25 years, 152 proved barren, a proportion\r\nof 1 : 12, or about 8%.\r\n\r\n_Matthews Duncan_ communicates the following data. In the year 1855, in\r\nthe cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, 4447 marriages were contracted, and\r\nof these 725 proved barren, a proportion of 1 : 6.1; 75 of these may\r\nhowever be excluded from consideration, inasmuch as the wives were\r\nalready at the age of 45 or upwards. Among the remaining 4372 marriages,\r\n662 proved barren, a proportion of 1 : 6.6. In other words, 15% of all\r\nmarriages of women between the ages of 15 and 44 proved sterile.\r\n\r\nFrom France we obtain figures showing a much higher proportion of\r\nsterile unions. According to _Rochard_, in France in the year 1888, of\r\nten million families, two million had no child at all, and two million\r\nhad each an only child, so that two fifths of the families of France\r\nwere taking no practical part in the maintenance of the population.\r\nAccording to _Chevin_, the proportion in France of barren to fruitful\r\nmarriages is as 1 : 5. 20% are entirely barren, while 24% exhibit\r\nonly-child-sterility.\r\n\r\nFrom Massachusetts, _Morton_ reports that according to the last census\r\nreturns, one fifth of all married women are childless.\r\n\r\nIn England, numerous trustworthy statistics can be obtained regarding\r\nthe frequency of sterile marriages. The average proportion of barren to\r\nfruitful unions was:\r\n\r\n        Among the patients in St. Bartholomew’s Hospital  1 : 8\r\n        Among the inhabitants of Grangemouth             1 : 10\r\n        Among the inhabitants of Bathgate                1 : 10\r\n        Among the British peerage                         1 : 6\r\n        Among the upper classes                          1 : 12\r\n        Among the inhabitants of Edinburgh and Glasgow    1 : 7\r\n\r\n_Matthews Duncan_ compiled the following table relating to 504\r\nabsolutely sterile women met with in his practice:\r\n\r\n ═════════╤═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\r\n  AGE AT  │                   NUMBER OF YEARS MARRIED.\r\n MARRIAGE.│\r\n ─────────┼───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────\r\n     „    │ Less  │4 to 8.│ 9 to  │ 14 to │ 19 to │ 24 to │  29.  │Totals.\r\n          │than 3.│       │  13.  │  18.  │  23.  │  28.  │       │\r\n ─────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────\r\n 15 to 19 │     12│     19│     15│      4│      7│      2│      1│     60\r\n 20 to 24 │     70│     66│     37│     24│     13│      9│       │    219\r\n 25 to 29 │     47│     51│     20│      8│      8│       │       │    134\r\n 30 to 34 │     26│     20│      8│       │      1│       │       │     59\r\n 35 to 39 │      6│     13│      4│       │       │       │       │     23\r\n 40 to 45 │      6│      3│       │       │       │       │       │      9\r\n ─────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────\r\n Totals   │    167│    172│     84│     40│     29│     11│      1│    504\r\n ═════════╧═══════╧═══════╧═══════╧═══════╧═══════╧═══════╧═══════╧═══════\r\n\r\n_Ansell_ bases upon the observations made by him in the case of 152\r\nsterile women the conclusion that there is no longer any chance of the\r\noccurrence of pregnancy if a woman is:\r\n\r\n       More than 48 years old, and has had no child for  2 years\r\n       More than 47 years old, and has had no child for  3 years\r\n       More than 46 years old, and has had no child for  4 years\r\n       More than 45 years old, and has had no child for  6 years\r\n       More than 44 years old, and has had no child for  8 years\r\n       Less than 44 years old, and has had no child for 10 years\r\n\r\nIf we take into account also cases of acquired sterility, the proportion\r\nof barren to fruitful marriages becomes even more unfavourable, and the\r\nproportion increases enormously if, with _Grünewaldt_, we number among\r\nthe barren women those who fail to continue child-bearing up to the\r\nnormal climacteric period. _Grünewaldt_, dealing with about 1500 women\r\nsuffering from affections of the reproductive organs, excluded all those\r\nwho were either virgins or widows, and also all those who at the time of\r\nthe observed barrenness were over 35 years of age; this left more than\r\n900 women suffering from affections of the reproductive organs, all of\r\nwhom were sexually mature, and were living in marital intercourse; of\r\nthese, nearly 500 were barren, 300 being instances of acquired\r\nsterility, and 190 instances of congenital sterility. Thus, according to\r\nthis observer, disease of the reproductive organs in women led in more\r\nthan 50% of the cases to disturbance of the reproductive capacity; about\r\none in every three women, previously competent to bear children, became\r\nbarren when affected with disease of the reproductive organs; and among\r\nevery five gynecological patients of the condition already specified as\r\nregards age and sexual intercourse, one proves congenitally sterile.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be forgotten, that sooner or later after marriage\r\nartificial sterility tends to come into being, its early or late\r\nappearance depending upon the degree of civilization and upon the\r\nnational and economical conditions of the people and the individuals\r\nconcerned. This fact must not be left out of the account.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which, in the human species, fertilization is effected, is\r\nstill far from clear in all its details; hence it is easy to understand,\r\nthat the etiology of sterility remains in many respects obscure. It is\r\nimpossible in every case to find a definite cause. Whereas, on the one\r\nhand, notwithstanding the existence of apparently insuperable obstacles,\r\nimpregnation may nevertheless be effected; so, on the other hand,\r\nsterility may exist in cases in which all the circumstances appear\r\nfavourable to the occurrence of conception. Hence a classification of\r\nthe different varieties of sterility from the etiological standpoint, is\r\na very difficult task, and the conclusions thus obtained are often\r\nvitiated.\r\n\r\nAlthough it cannot be denied that mechanical causes are competent to\r\nlead to sterility in women, _Sims_, in his advocacy of the mechanical\r\ndoctrine of sterility, widely overshoots the mark. His authority,\r\nhowever, has led to a general acceptance of this doctrine, which is by\r\nno means justified by facts. The theory of mechanical obstruction,\r\naccording to which sterility in women depends upon mechanical obstacles\r\nto the passage of the spermatozoa towards the ovaries, is from time to\r\ntime strikingly illustrated by cases coming under our notice—cases the\r\nnature of which can hardly be overlooked; but it is quite wrong to\r\nsuppose that this causation accounts for the _majority_ of instances of\r\nsterility in women, and strict limitations should be placed upon the\r\nemployment of surgical measures based upon this mechanical theory of\r\nsterility.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical view has been counterposed by _Von Grünewaldt_ with a\r\ndoctrine in which especial stress is laid upon obstacles to\r\nutero-gestation, sterility being regarded as a functional disorder\r\nbrought about by affections of the female reproductive organs rendering\r\nthe uterus unfit for the incubation of the ovum. It cannot be denied\r\nthat the elucidation of this casual influence was a valuable\r\ncontribution to the theory of sterility, and it is unquestionable that\r\nmany morbid conditions of the uterus exist capable of giving rise to\r\nsterility in this manner; but we must avoid the error of regarding this\r\ndoctrine as a full explanation of the cause of sterility.\r\n\r\nIf, however, both of these theories of sterility are insufficient, we\r\ncannot regard a third theory, that of _Matthews Duncan_, as filling the\r\ngaps in our knowledge. It would be most unfortunate if this author were\r\nright in maintaining that all our knowledge of the causes of sterility\r\nis to be summed up in the phrase “deficient reproductive energy;” we\r\ncannot agree with _Duncan_ in his belief that “Sterility is an\r\nimperfection devoid of all perceptible, measurable characteristics;” nor\r\ncan we follow him when he maintains that local causes, whether they are\r\nsuch as hinder conception, or such as hinder utero-gestation, have a\r\nvery limited sphere of activity. _Matthews Duncan_ adopts an\r\nincomprehensible standpoint when he regards sterility as dependent upon\r\na law of nature, as a condition which may affect distinct classes or an\r\nentire population.\r\n\r\nAccording to the latest doctrine of sterility, only in quite exceptional\r\ninstances is the woman regarded as responsible for the occurrence of\r\nsterility; contrariwise, the male genital organs are commonly blamed for\r\nthe affection, which is in the overwhelming majority of cases supposed\r\nto be due to azoospermia, usually dependent upon gonorrhœal infection;\r\ncompare with this, affections of the female reproductive organs are said\r\nto play a quite subordinate role in the etiology of sterility. But for\r\nmy part, though I recognize the important share that gonorrhœa in the\r\nmale plays in the causation of sterility, I am of opinion that the\r\nextreme view just mentioned is by no means justified by the facts.\r\n\r\nSterility, a functional disturbance of an extremely complicated nature,\r\ncan, in my opinion, be most usefully elucidated from the etiological\r\nstandpoint by starting with the assumption that three conditions are\r\nabsolutely essential to procreation:\r\n\r\n1. that ovulation proceeds in a perfectly normal manner, the maturation\r\nof the discharged ova being complete;\r\n\r\n2. that normal spermatozoa have access to these normal ova (conjugation\r\nof male and female pronuclei);\r\n\r\n3. that the uterus is properly adapted for the gestation of the\r\nfertilized ovum.\r\n\r\nMy classification of the varieties of sterility corresponds to these\r\nconditions of procreation:\r\n\r\n1. sterility due to incapacity for ovulation;\r\n\r\n2. sterility due to some hindrance to the conjugation of ovum and\r\nspermatozoon (under this head come also those cases in which the male is\r\nat fault—azoospermia, and the like);\r\n\r\n3. sterility due to incapacity for gestation.\r\n\r\nIt must also be admitted that there are additional causes of sterility,\r\ncauses which lie beyond our control. Moreover, as I have already\r\nmentioned, in most cases of sterility, we have to do, not with a single\r\ncause, but with the resultant of two or more cooperating causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Incapacity for Ovulation._\r\n\r\nIncapacity for ovulation, the first and most decisive cause of sterility\r\nin women, may be absolute and irremediable, or relative and transient.\r\nWe have to do with the former in cases in which the ovaries are entirely\r\nwanting, or when they are affected with organic disease to such a degree\r\nthat they have become incapable of fulfilling their function of\r\novulation; incapacity for ovulation is, on the other hand, relative and\r\ntransient in certain pathological states of the ovary and neighbouring\r\norgans, when there is incomplete development or partial atrophy of the\r\novaries, when there are new-growths of the ovaries, in cases of\r\noophoritis and perioophoritis, in consequence of disturbances of\r\ninnervation, diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system,\r\nviolent emotional disturbance, constitutional disorders, such as\r\nsyphilis, chlorosis, anæmia, universal lipomatosis, scrofula,\r\nalcoholism, and morphinism, also in consequence of changes in the supply\r\nof nutriment and in the general mode of living, or of senile changes,\r\nand finally in consequence of hereditary influences.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of the etiological influence of suppressed or incomplete\r\novulation in the production of sterility in women is at times beset with\r\ngreat and even insuperable difficulties. The state of the menstrual\r\nfunction, suppression of the flow, or the regularity or irregularity of\r\nits occurrence, serve indeed to inform us as to the general activity or\r\ninactivity of the function of ovulation; but the variations in this\r\nfunction give no certain information as to whether a woman is fertile or\r\ninfertile. Knowing as we do that generally speaking an intimate\r\nconnexion subsists between menstruation and ovulation, we are indeed\r\nable to assert that regular menstruation and fertility in women run a\r\nparallel course, and further, that the greater the irregularity of the\r\nmenstrual function, the greater the tendency to sterility. Recently,\r\ngreat advances have been made in the technique of manual exploration of\r\nthe ovaries, and by means of vaginal and rectal bimanual examination, we\r\nare now able to obtain accurate information regarding abnormalities in\r\nthe size, shape, and position of these organs, and regarding any other\r\nintrapelvic disorders. In this way we have been enabled to recognize a\r\nnumber of pathological states of the ovaries which affect the functions\r\nof these organs. In some cases also there are general symptoms which\r\nfurnish us with the means of drawing conclusions, more or less\r\ntrustworthy, regarding the state of the ovarian functions; for instance,\r\nthe general development of a woman’s body, the condition of the external\r\ngenitals, the vulva, the mons veneris, the pubic hair, the clitoris, and\r\nthe mammae. Again, we can derive information from various troubles of\r\nwhich women complain; such as sacrache; a sense of weight and pressure\r\nin the pelvis; feelings of tension and shooting pains in the breasts;\r\nflushings of the face; haemorrhage from the nose, mouth, or rectum,\r\nrecurring at regular intervals and vicarious in nature. In many\r\ninstances, however, it will only be by obtaining data regarding the age,\r\nmode of life, and family history, of the person affected, that it will\r\nbe possible to draw conclusions as to the cause of the sterility.\r\n\r\nThe female reproductive glands, the ovaries, may, owing to developmental\r\ndisturbances during foetal life, either be entirely wanting, or they may\r\nmerely be deprived of certain structural constituents, especially their\r\nepithelial elements. In the former case, we have congenital complete\r\nunilateral or bilateral absence of the ovary, a condition most commonly\r\nassociated with the absence or with a rudimentary condition of other\r\nportions of the reproductive apparatus; in the latter case, we have the\r\ncondition somewhat inappropriately named congenital atrophy of the\r\novary.\r\n\r\nComplete absence of both ovaries necessarily leads to absolute\r\nsterility. Both congenital absence and congenital atrophy of the\r\novaries, will usually be found in association with other anomalies of\r\nthe sexual organs. Absence of one ovary, on the other hand, by no means\r\nentails sterility; on the contrary, when a single well-formed ovary\r\nexists, ovulation usually proceeds in a perfectly normal manner. When\r\nsuch women marry, pregnancy usually follows in the normal proportion of\r\ncases; and, in complete opposition to one of the theories of the\r\ndetermination of sex to which allusion has been made, such women bear\r\nchildren of both sexes.\r\n\r\n_Morgagni_ described a case of congenital absence of both ovaries in a\r\nwoman 66 years of age, in whom the external genital organs, the vagina,\r\nand the uterus, were imperfectly developed, but the Fallopian tubes were\r\nof normal size. Careful examination of the upper borders of the broad\r\nligaments of the uterus disclosed no trace of ovary on either side.\r\n\r\n_Quain_, in a virgin 33 years of age, found the vagina rudimentary, with\r\nits mucous membrane but slightly corrugated; at the upper end of this\r\npassage was a semilunar fold which probably represented the uterus. The\r\novaries were absent; a small gland-like body embedded in the left wall\r\nof the vagina was regarded by him as a rudimentary ovary. The\r\nconfiguration of the body was feminine, feminine also the disposition;\r\nmoreover, there was a monthly recurrent epistaxis.\r\n\r\nThe atrophy of the ovaries which normally takes place at the climacteric\r\nperiod, to be more minutely described in the section on the menopause,\r\nhas constitutional effects similar to those dependent upon absence or\r\ncongenital atrophy of the ovaries.\r\n\r\nA rudimentary condition of both ovaries, or bilateral atrophy of these\r\norgans, with or without associated atrophy of the entire reproductive\r\nsystem, commonly entails sterility. In such cases, in addition to\r\namenorrhœa, we usually find that the breasts are but slightly developed,\r\nthe pubic hair is scanty, the labia majora and labia minora are small,\r\nwhilst sexual appetite is deficient, and during coitus the woman is\r\nentirely passive. On the other hand, we must not make the mistake of\r\ninferring from the fact that the sexual appetite is keen and coitus\r\npleasurable, that therefore the capacity for ovulation is normal. Even\r\nafter operative removal of both ovaries, some women have assured me, not\r\nonly that the sexual impulse was as strong as formerly, but even that\r\nthey continued to experience the sexual orgasm in its full intensity.\r\nThis is analogous to the well known fact that men who have undergone\r\ncastration after arriving at sexual maturity may remain capable of\r\nperforming coitus. It is a matter of history that in the lupanars of\r\nancient Rome, castrated men were kept to enable women to enjoy the\r\npleasures of sexual intercourse without fear of consequences; and it is\r\nsaid that such men are to be found in Italian brothels to this day. In\r\nthe case of the lower mammals, it appears to be the rule that when the\r\nreproductive glands are removed in early youth, every trace of sexual\r\ndesire disappears.\r\n\r\nIncomplete development of the ovaries, with consequent defective\r\novulation, may result from marriage in girls who are still immature—a\r\nfact already known to _Aristotle_, who wrote, “premature marriage leads\r\nto a scanty progeny—that this is the case in man as well as the lower\r\nanimals is witnessed by the weakly inhabitants of regions in which\r\nchild-marriage is common.”\r\n\r\nIt is shown by statistical data that the age at which puberty occurs,\r\nthe age, that is, at which the menstrual flow begins, has a relation to\r\nsterility; and the same is true as regards the age at marriage. In the\r\nformer connexion, women in whom puberty is comparatively early, are less\r\noften sterile than those in whom puberty is comparatively late. _Emmet_,\r\nin an investigation embracing 2330 cases, showed that in our climate the\r\naverage age at which the first menstruation occurred was 14.23 years,\r\nand that in the case of women who subsequently proved fertile, the first\r\nflow took place on an average 26 days earlier than in the case of women\r\nwho subsequently proved barren. We also learn from _Emmet’s_ tables that\r\nthe mean duration of menstruation and the mean quantity of the flow are\r\nlarger in fertile than in barren women.\r\n\r\nAs regards the influence of the age at marriage upon fertility, in women\r\nwho marry between the ages of 20 and 24 years, sterility is most\r\ninfrequent; it is commoner in women who marry between the ages of 14 and\r\n20; after the age of 25, the proportion of sterile women increases with\r\neach year to which marriage is postponed.\r\n\r\nPremature atrophy of the ovaries, with consequent incapacity for\r\novulation, may occur in a great variety of conditions; it has been\r\nobserved in scrofula, diabetes, rickets, phthisis, and malarial\r\ncachexia; it also occurs in certain chronic intoxications, as from the\r\nlong-continued use of opium or morphine, and from the abuse of alcoholic\r\nbeverages. According to the observation of _Burkart_, _Levinstein_, and\r\n_Erlenmeyer_, morphinism is a condition which may be relied upon to\r\nbring about amenorrhœa and temporary sterility from cessation of\r\novulation. It has been asserted but by no means proved, that the\r\nlong-continued administration of quinine hinders ovulation. As a result\r\nof various acute and chronic disorders, a simple atrophy of the ovarian\r\nfollicles can be detected, dependent upon simple fatty degeneration;\r\nthis has been seen by _Grohe_ in children as a result of general\r\natrophy, and also following caseous and suppurative diseases of the\r\nrespiratory organs; by _Slavjansky_ in children after chronic pneumonia\r\nand chronic dysentery, and in adults as a sequel of typhoid, and in one\r\ninstance as a sequel of puerperal septicaemia.\r\n\r\nHyperplasia of the ovarian stroma, in slighter degrees of the affection,\r\nleads to menstrual disturbances, partly of nervous and partly of\r\ninflammatory nature, and in more severe degrees leads to sterility\r\ndependent upon the hindrances which the thickened tunica albuginea\r\noffers to the bursting of the mature follicles. _Klebs_ believes that\r\nthis anomaly is always due to a disposition acquired very early in life,\r\nand perhaps at the time when the ovaries are first developed.\r\n\r\nFollicular cysts of the ovary, which are formed mostly at the time of\r\npuberty, and originate under the influence of menstrual congestion, from\r\ngraafian follicles near to ripeness, are competent to cause sterility,\r\nowing to the pressure they exercise upon the superficially placed\r\nrudimentary follicles, leading to the atrophy of these latter. Other\r\nnew-growths of the ovaries have similar effects, such as adenomata,\r\ncarcinomata, dermoid cysts, cystomata, sarcomata, and fibromata. In many\r\ncases of these disorders, however, the ovarian follicles may for long\r\nperiods remain unaffected; and in these instances, ovulation,\r\nmenstruation, and even conception, may proceed undisturbed. Even in\r\ncases in which a neoplasm attains a great size, if it affects one ovary\r\nonly, ovulation may occur normally in the other, and conception may\r\nensue; and even in the diseased ovary, if small portions of its tissue\r\nremain unaffected, ovules may be discharged from these portions. The\r\nminutest portion of healthy ovarian tissue, though all the remainder has\r\nbeen destroyed by disease, may suffice to bring about conception.\r\n\r\nOvarian tumours appear with considerable frequency to be complicated\r\nwith sterility; but in such cases the question always remains open,\r\nwhether in the majority of instances the sterility is to be regarded as\r\nthe cause or as the consequence of the ovarian disease. _Boinet’s_\r\nfigures dealing with this problem are the most striking of all. He\r\nstates that of 500 women with ovarian tumours, 390 were childless. But\r\nthese results are challenged by other observers. _Veit’s_ estimates,\r\nbased upon a compilation of the figures of _Lee_, _Scanzoni_, and\r\n_West_, is that 34% of women with ovarian tumour are sterile. On the\r\nother hand, _Negroni’s_ collection of 400 cases of ovarian tumour,\r\nincluding both married and unmarried, contained 43 only who had never\r\nbeen pregnant. Other lists show: 13 sterile women among 45 suffering\r\nfrom ovarian tumour (_von Scanzoni_); 1 sterile among 21 (_Nussbaum_); 8\r\nsterile among 63 (_Olshausen_). _Winckel_, among 150 sterile married\r\nwomen, found 32 suffering from ovarian tumour, which in two of these\r\ncases only was bilateral. _Atlee_, in 15 cases of ovarian tumour,\r\nobserved premature cessation of menstruation at the ages of 30, 39, 40\r\nand 42, respectively.\r\n\r\nAlthough in many cases sterility develops coincidently with the growth\r\nof an ovarian cystoma, yet in many other women such tumours have no\r\ninfluence in diminishing fertility. _Martin_ in a case in which\r\nsterility existed in connexion with a unilateral ovarian cystoma, the\r\nother ovary being healthy, observed pregnancy as a sequel of the removal\r\nof the diseased ovary. In one of these cases, after removal of the\r\novarian cystoma, _Martin_ punctured in the other ovary a dropsical\r\nfollicle which had attained nearly the size of a walnut. Pregnancy in\r\nthis case also followed the resumption of marital intercourse. _Müller_\r\nreports that in his clinique within recent years pregnancy complicated\r\nwith ovarian tumour has been observed in 7 instances; in one of these\r\ncases the pregnancy occurred notwithstanding the fact that the\r\nnew-growth was so large as almost to fill the abdominal cavity. _Holst_\r\nreports the case of a multipara 43 years of age who died in the 18th to\r\nthe 20th week of pregnancy; at the post mortem examination the left\r\novary was found to be transformed into three cysts each the size of an\r\napple, whilst in place of the right ovary was a medullary carcinoma the\r\nsize of a man’s head; on neither side could a trace of normal ovarian\r\ntissue be detected. _Spiegelberg_, in a woman who died shortly after\r\ngiving birth to her second child, found that both ovaries were\r\ntransformed into myxo-sarcomatous tumours; in a woman aged 42, who died\r\nfour weeks after her eleventh confinement, both ovaries were found to be\r\ntransformed into nodular carcinomatous tumours each larger than a\r\nchild’s head; in none of these ovaries was any normal stroma to be\r\nfound. _Ruge_ reports the case of a woman 36 years of age, who\r\nmiscarried in the sixth month of pregnancy; she had myxo-sarcoma of both\r\novaries, one weighing 5620 grammes the other 480 grammes.\r\n\r\nAll these cases indicate that, notwithstanding the existence of\r\nextensive degeneration of both ovaries, some minute remaining fragment\r\nof healthy ovarian stroma is competent to produce normal mature ova—a\r\nfact which has often been proved also by microscopical examination. That\r\nunder the influence of pregnancy, existing ovarian tumours often take on\r\nextremely rapid growth, is also indicated by some of the above cases.\r\n\r\nCastration (oöphorectomy, spaying, _Battey’s_ operation), the removal of\r\nboth ovaries, naturally results in sterility. If in the literature of\r\nthe subject cases are to be found in which, after this operation, not\r\nmenstruation merely, but even pregnancy has occurred, this is to be\r\nexplained either by the fact that in the stump there was left a fragment\r\nof the ovary, still containing tissue capable of producing mature ova;\r\nor else by the existence of a supernumerary ovary. _Schatz_ reports the\r\ncase of a woman in whom pregnancy occurred after double oöphorectomy. In\r\nthe month of February, 1880, this operation was performed on a girl\r\ntwenty years of age; she married in April, 1884; and in May, 1885, she\r\nwas delivered of a mature female infant. The history of the case and the\r\ndetails of the operation showed clearly that the left ovary had been\r\ncompletely removed, with the outermost third of the left Fallopian tube;\r\nthe right ovary was cut away in such a manner that a strip of tissue of\r\nat most two millimetres (one twelfth of an inch) in width was left in\r\nthe body, whilst the right Fallopian tube was left intact. This case\r\nteaches us that the smallest remnant of the ovary is competent to render\r\nnormal pregnancy possible; and further, that a small size of the ovary\r\nno more constitutes a hindrance to the proper reception of the ovum in\r\nthe Fallopian tube, than does an abnormally large size of the ovary, or\r\nan unusual shape of this organ.\r\n\r\n_Miklucho-Mackay_ relates that among the indigens of Australia the\r\nremoval of the ovaries is often practised, in order to create a special\r\nkind of hetairæ incapable of becoming mothers. _McGillivray_ saw at Cape\r\nYork a native girl whose ovaries had been removed because she was a\r\ncongenital deaf-mute, with the object of preventing her giving birth to\r\ndeaf-mute infants. In the beginning of the last century there existed in\r\nSayn-Wittgenstein a small religious sect whose custom it was always to\r\nconclude their religious services by indiscriminate carnal union among\r\nthe members of the community; when women and girls were first admitted\r\nas members of this sect, an attempt was made to render them unfitted for\r\nconception “by means of a painful and dangerous compression of the\r\novaries.” (_Ploss_.)\r\n\r\nA transient, relative hindrance to ovulation may be brought about by\r\nvarious pathological states of the ovaries. Acute oophoritis usually\r\nsuspends the ovarian functions; chronic oophoritis has sometimes a\r\nsimilar effect, not only because the profound changes that take place in\r\nthe ovary hinder the formation of the ovules, but also because, as we\r\nshall later explain more fully, the expulsion of the ova and their\r\nreception by the Fallopian tubes are hindered. In severe oophoritis and\r\nperioophoritis, more especially in parenchymatous inflammation,\r\nsterility may be brought about by an absorption of the finely granular\r\ncontents of the follicles, which collapse, with adhesion of their walls;\r\nwhen all or most of the follicles are thus affected, the ovaries become\r\nsmall and hard.\r\n\r\nIn perioophoritis, the exudation leads to the formation of cord-shaped\r\nor ribbon-shaped adhesions between the ovaries and the broad ligaments,\r\nthe uterus, and the peritoneal folds of the neighbourhood. The ovary in\r\nsuch cases may also be displaced, or may undergo atrophy from pressure.\r\n\r\nIn the case of 200 sterile women, I found in 46 instances chronic\r\noophoritis and perioophoritis. _Olshausen_ reports that of 12 married\r\nwomen suffering from chronic oophoritis, five were barren, whilst of the\r\nremaining 7, three only had given birth to more than one child.\r\n_Matthews Duncan_, on the other hand, saw pregnancy in a case of\r\nbilateral ovarian inflammation, in which the organs were considerably\r\nenlarged.\r\n\r\nFurther, local or general peritonitis may lead to parenchymatous\r\ninflammation of the ovaries, and this, spreading from the periphery\r\ntowards the centre of the organ, attacks the follicles irrespective of\r\ntheir ripeness. Again, during the puerperium, the interstitial form of\r\noophoritis is by no means rare, and this may at times lead to permanent\r\nsterility in either of two ways: it may be in consequence of the onset\r\nof a secondary parenchymatous inflammation, which destroys all the\r\nfollicles; it may be because a thick and tough layer of sclerosed tissue\r\nforms around the periphery of the ovary, which mechanically prevents the\r\nmaturation and rupture of the follicles. According to _Slavjansky_,\r\npuerperal disease is the principal cause of this form of oophoritis.\r\n_Olshausen_ indicates as the most frequent cause of primary\r\nperioophoritis, an inflammation propagated from the Fallopian tubes,\r\nleading to the formation of masses of exudation, which envelop the\r\novary, and by the pressure they cause, and by interfering with the\r\nblood-supply, lead to atrophy of the gland.\r\n\r\nSometimes the chronic inflammatory induration by means of which the\r\nstroma of the ovary is rendered denser and firmer, is due to changes in\r\nthe vessels, and depends upon valvular defects of the heart—upon venous\r\ncongestion. In this way, heart disease may hinder ovulation and bring\r\nabout sterility. Both syphilis and gonorrhoea may give rise to chronic\r\ninflammatory changes in the ovary, usually leading to premature\r\ncontraction of the tissues and to the formation of numerous adhesions.\r\nAccording to _Olshausen_, amenorrhœa is not a common feature of ovarian\r\ndisease, except in cases of defective development of these organs, of\r\ncirrhosis of the ovaries, and of bilateral new-growths. Disease\r\naffecting only a single ovary, even tumour of considerable size, rarely\r\ncauses amenorrhœa until profound constitutional disturbance has ensued.\r\nAn exception to this rule is found in the case of carcinomatous tumours\r\nof the ovary; these, indeed, are commonly bilateral; but even when\r\nconfined to a single ovary, amenorrhœa is a comparatively early symptom.\r\nAccording to the same author, sterility is a common consequence of\r\nchronic oophoritis and its sequelae, and is usual also in cases of\r\nbilateral new-growths; on the other hand, tumours affecting a single\r\novary often fail to prevent conception even though they have attained a\r\ngreat size.\r\n\r\nSyphilis in women must be regarded as a frequent cause of sterility, by\r\ninterference with ovulation, but is in this regard by no means an\r\nabsolute bar to the occurrence of pregnancy. According to _Parent_ and\r\n_Duchatelet_, under whose observation during the space of 12 years there\r\ncame annually an average number of 2625 syphilitic prostitutes, the\r\naverage annual of births in these cases was 63 only. According to _Marc\r\nd’Espine_, 2000 prostitutes gave birth on an average to two or three\r\nchildren in all during a year. (That there are other causes besides\r\nsyphilis for the remarkable infertility of women of the town, will be\r\nexplained later). According to _Bednar, Mayr_, and others,\r\nconstitutional syphilis in women invariably leads to sterility; others,\r\nas for instance _Zeissl_, believe that women suffering from inveterate\r\nsyphilis are commonly, but not invariably, sterile; whilst according to\r\n_Rosen_, conception only takes place in syphilitic women in whom the\r\ndisease has passed into the tertiary form. Experience shows, however,\r\nthat neither early nor late forms of syphilis necessarily lead to\r\nsterility in women. It must also be pointed out, that syphilis in the\r\nmale _may_ be the cause of sterility, and _must_ be the cause thereof\r\nwhen the disease is localised in the testicles, and the consequent\r\ndegeneration of the glandular substance leads to the occurrence of\r\nazoospermia, more particularly when syphilitic or gummatous orchitis is\r\nbilateral. According to _Lewin_, we fail to find spermatozoa in 50% of\r\nmen, otherwise powerful, suffering from syphilitic dyscrasia. _Hanc_, on\r\nthe other hand, failed to find azoospermia in any one of ten men\r\nsuffering from lues. In animals also syphilis is said to cause\r\nsterility.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which certain anomalies of the blood (anæmia and\r\nchlorosis), general disturbances of the nervous system, febrile states,\r\nand such constitutional disorders as scrofula, have a temporary or\r\npermanent influence in checking ovulation, is far from being understood;\r\nbut the fact that ovulation is checked by such conditions, has been\r\nestablished beyond question by numerous observations. It is well known\r\nthat severe fevers, more especially typhoid, suspend the ovarian\r\nfunction; that in various chronic disorders of an enfeebling nature, and\r\nnotably in chlorosis, all signs of menstrual activity disappear; and\r\nthat in certain nutritive disturbances, as in extreme obesity,\r\namenorrhœa also occurs; finally, numerous cases are on record in which\r\nsome sudden affection of the nervous system has instantaneously\r\ninhibited ovarian activity.\r\n\r\nIn anæmia and chlorosis, it is probable that the degree of menstrual\r\ncongestion is insufficient to ensure the bursting of the graafian\r\nfollicle. The sterility often observed as a sequel of typhoid, malaria,\r\nthe acute exanthemata, cholera, and septicaemia, is probably due in most\r\ncases to the occurrence of parenchymatous oophoritis, with consequent\r\ndestruction of the ovarian follicles. The researches of _Slavjansky_\r\nhave shown that in acute disorders inflammatory changes often occur in\r\nthe graafian follicles. When infectious disorders ran an acute course,\r\nthis observer usually found that the parenchymatous inflammation of the\r\novary had occurred near the periphery, in the cortical layer, the\r\ndestruction being limited almost exclusively to the primitive follicles;\r\nwhen the course of the primary disorder was more chronic, the mature or\r\nnearly mature graafian follicles were the ones destroyed. When\r\ninflammation of a follicle has led to its destruction, it is replaced by\r\na linear scar. _Lebedinsky_ found similar changes in the ovary after\r\nscarlatina—destruction of a lesser or greater number of follicles, with\r\nformation of scars. Thus, parenchymatous oophoritis as a sequel of acute\r\ndiseases, may, if severe, lead to destruction of all the rudimentary\r\nfollicles, with consequent sterility. In the post mortem examination of\r\nsuch cases, the condition of the ovaries is similar to that which is\r\nelsewhere in this work described as characteristic of these organs after\r\nthe menopause: the ovary is diminished in size, its surface is furrowed,\r\nthe tissue is indurated in consequence of overgrowth of fibroid tissue;\r\noften not a single follicle is to be detected on section of the organ.\r\n\r\nImmoderate obesity is a disorder of nutrition favoring the occurrence of\r\nsterility.\r\n\r\nIn very obese women of an age which normally is the reproductive prime,\r\namenorrhœa or scanty menstruation is a very common accompaniment. In 215\r\nsuch cases which came under my own observation, amenorrhœa was present\r\nin 49, and menstruation was scanty in 116; thus in nearly three fourths\r\nof these obese women menstruation was either deficient or entirely\r\nwanting. Very remarkable also is the high percentage of sterile women\r\namong the obese. In the 215 cases already mentioned (all married women),\r\n48 were sterile—a percentage of 21. Whilst the ordinary ratio of barren\r\nto fruitful marriages is 1 : 10 or 1 : 9, in the cases in which the\r\nwives, or both wives and husbands, are extremely obese, the ratio is\r\naccording to my own observations, 1 : 5—or, if we include cases of\r\nonly-child-sterility, 1 : 4.\r\n\r\nWe cannot wonder at this great frequency of sterility in obese women\r\nwhen we remember that, apart from the menstrual deficiencies which so\r\ncommonly accompany this disorder of nutrition, obesity is apt to entail\r\nmany other disorders of the reproductive organs, as for instance a\r\nmorbid state of the uterine and vaginal secretions, chronic metritis,\r\nand displacements of the uterus; still, it cannot be denied, that in\r\nmany instances we are unable in such obese women to detect any disorder\r\nof the reproductive organs competent to account for the sterility, and\r\nwe must therefore assume that the excessive development of fat has some\r\ndirect influence in preventing ovulation, or at least that it in some\r\nway exercises an unfavourable influence upon the reproductive process.\r\n\r\nThat excessive obesity hinders fertility, is shown by experience both as\r\nregards the vegetable and the animal kingdom. All animal-breeders are\r\nfamiliar with the fact that undue production of fat limits fertility.\r\nThus, equally in the case of turkeys and in the case of the common fowl,\r\nif the hens are overfed and become fat, they cease to lay.\r\n\r\n_Hippocrates_ already indicated obesity as a cause of sterility. Writing\r\nof the wives of the Scythians, he pointed out as a proof that their\r\nexcessive obesity was the cause of the sterility from which they\r\ncommonly suffered, the fact that their female slaves, who were thin,\r\nwere readily impregnated by intercourse with the Scythian males. The oft\r\nrepeated dwindling and disappearance of ruling families in India and in\r\nEgypt, has doubtless in part depended upon the extreme obesity of the\r\nfemale consorts of such rulers.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, indeed, a great accumulation of fat on the front of\r\nthe abdomen and in the vulva, suffices to cause a simply mechanical\r\nhindrance to the proper performance of a fertilizing coitus. It is\r\npossible also that the phlegmatic temperament of very fat women is a\r\ncontributory cause to their sterility—if indeed it is in general true\r\nthat frigidity during sexual intercourse is unfavourable to conception,\r\nas is expressed by the old proverb, _quo salacior mulier, eo\r\nfoecundior_. It is unquestionable that in very obese women sexual\r\nsensibility is commonly greatly deficient, and that their husbands often\r\ncomplain of their coldness and lack of passion. In several cases that\r\nhave come under my observation, dyspareunia occurred in obese and\r\nsterile women.\r\n\r\nThe dependence of sterility upon obesity is often proved in the most\r\nstriking manner _ex juvantibus_. A “cure” for the reduction of fat often\r\nresults favourably in respect also of rendering the woman who undergoes\r\nit readily impregnable—a result by no means ardently desired.\r\n\r\nIt must also be pointed out that very obese women form a considerable\r\nsection of those suffering from only-child sterility, and this largely\r\nin consequence of their strong predisposition towards abortion. As the\r\nimpregnated uterus enlarges, the space for its accommodation is\r\ninsufficient, owing to the great development of the panniculus adiposus,\r\nand thus obesity, like intra-abdominal tumour, predisposes to abortion.\r\nThe excessive accumulation of fat within the abdomen, by exercising\r\npressure upon the inferior vena cava or on its principal tributaries,\r\nhinders the venous return, and gives rise to a chronic stasis in the\r\nuterine bloodvessels, those alike of the muscle and of the mucous\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that sterility is so common in very obese\r\nwomen, the fact remains that some such women are remarkably fertile, and\r\nhave very large families indeed.\r\n\r\n_Towers-Smith_, _Duke_, and _Rodriguez_, who have recently all been\r\nengaged in examining the relations between obesity and sterility, agree\r\nin asserting that sterility due to obesity may be cured by dietetic\r\ntreatment for the relief of the primary disorder of metabolism.\r\n\r\nThough menstruation is usually deficient or absent in obese sterile\r\nwomen, and though it is commonly supposed that amenorrhœa implies\r\nsterility, it is necessary to point out that whilst failure of\r\nmenstruation is a frequent and important sign of suppression of\r\novulation, it by no means invariably has this significance. It is an\r\nestablished fact, and one borne out by my personal experience, that\r\nwomen who have never menstruated have nevertheless become pregnant;\r\nothers, again, have become pregnant although they have ceased to\r\nmenstruate for several years, and this has even occurred in women at a\r\ncomparatively advanced age. Hence, from the fact that amenorrhœa exists,\r\nwe cannot with certainty infer that a woman is sterile. Moreover, we\r\nmust remember that physiologically amenorrhoeic women often enough\r\nconceive—during lactation. Although we hold the opinion that there is an\r\nintimate connexion between ovulation and menstruation, yet it is always\r\npossible in cases in which menstruation fails to occur, that ovulation\r\nhas taken place, but that the stimulus which that process has exercised\r\nupon the reproductive organs has been insufficient to give rise to the\r\ncustomary flow of blood.\r\n\r\nThe following remarkable case came under my own observation: Mrs. B., 26\r\nyears of age, had lived in sterile wedlock for six years, had never\r\nmenstruated, nor had she ever had any sanguineous discharge from the\r\ngenitals. The body was delicately formed, the breasts were fairly well\r\ndeveloped, the external genital organs showed no abnormality. For some\r\nweeks before consulting me, this woman, hitherto childless, and living\r\nin regular sexual intercourse with her husband, had noticed a remarkable\r\nenlargement of the abdomen. Another medical man whom she had consulted\r\nhad diagnosed ovarian tumor and had urged operation. A more careful\r\nexamination of the pelvis showed, however, that the woman was in the\r\nsixth month of pregnancy, a diagnosis which was duly confirmed by the\r\ndelivery of a full-time child. In another of my cases, a woman married\r\nat the age of 45 years, having ceased to menstruate two years\r\npreviously. She became pregnant and gave birth to a child in quite\r\nnormal fashion. The following instructive case also came under my own\r\nobservation: The wife of one of my colleagues, living in sterile wedlock\r\nfor 17 years, extremely obese, had since puberty menstruated but\r\nscantily and with great irregularity. The menstrual interval was several\r\nmonths, and when the discharge did appear, it was pale in colour and\r\nsmall in quantity; it lasted moreover but a day or two. Last winter, the\r\nflow as usual failed to appear for several months, and since the woman\r\nhad at the same time become fatter than ever, Turkish baths and\r\nenergetic muscular movements were prescribed. The result of this\r\ntreatment was a striking one—abortion. After 17 years of marital\r\nintercourse she had for the first time become pregnant.\r\n\r\nIn the case of sterile women who are amenorrhoeic, even when the\r\namenorrhœa has never been interrupted by a menstrual discharge, or when\r\nit appears entirely dependent upon obesity, it is nevertheless necessary\r\nto be extremely cautious in making a diagnosis, and above all in\r\nemploying an intra-uterine sound. In such cases I have known the most\r\neminent gynecologists unwittingly bring about abortion.\r\n\r\n_Cleveland_, _Godefroy_, _Haschek_, _Ritschie_, _Sommerus_, _Stark_,\r\n_Taylor_, and _Young_, have all reported cases in which pregnancy\r\noccurred in women suffering from amenorrhœa; but all such cases must be\r\nregarded as quite exceptional. _Szukits_ examined 8000 sexually mature\r\nwomen, and found among them fourteen only who had never menstruated. Of\r\nthese, four were multiparae.\r\n\r\n_Saint Moulin_ reports the case of a woman 24 years of age who had never\r\nmenstruated, but who none the less became pregnant and gave birth to a\r\nfine girl. One of the most striking cases of this nature is the one\r\nreported by _Rodzewitsch_, regarding a woman who first began to\r\nmenstruate at the age of 36 years. This woman had however been married\r\nwhen fifteen years of age, and in the subsequent twenty-one years she\r\ngave birth to 15 children, remaining the whole time amenorrhoeic.\r\n\r\n_Puech_ reports the case of a woman who ceased to menstruate at the age\r\nof 40 years, and remained amenorrhoeic for the subsequent six years.\r\nThen menstruation recurred for a year, and finally ceased definitively\r\nin consequence of the occurrence of pregnancy, which terminated in the\r\nnormal birth of a healthy boy. _Loewy_, in a woman 31 years of age, who\r\nhad previously been amenorrhoeic all her life, saw menstruation appear\r\nfor the first time shortly after the birth of her sixth child. _Ahlfeld_\r\nhad under observation the case of a woman who was the mother of eight\r\nchildren, and had never menstruated.\r\n\r\n_Krieger_ reports the case observed by _Mayer_, of the wife of an\r\nartizan, who between the ages of 17 and 28 years had given birth to five\r\nchildren, and had had one abortion. After the age of 22, she had no\r\ntrace of menstrual discharge, but notwithstanding this, she subsequently\r\ngave birth to three children. _Krieger_ himself saw a woman who had had\r\nher last child at the age of 33, and in whom now, at the age of 48,\r\nmenstruation had just ceased entirely. Two years later, irregular\r\nmenstrual discharges recommenced; when these ceased, it appeared that\r\nthe woman was once more pregnant, and she was normally delivered of a\r\nfull-time girl.\r\n\r\n_Renaudin_ relates the case of a lady 60 years of age who gave birth to\r\na child, menstruation having ceased 12 years earlier. _Deshhayes_ saw\r\nthe delivery of a woman 50 years of age, two years subsequent to the\r\noccurrence of a normal menopause. _Capwron_, quotes the ease of a woman\r\nwho became pregnant at the age of 65 years. In this case menstruation\r\nhad recurred, having ceased many years before in a normal menopause.\r\nThis woman aborted at three months, and the foetus was well-formed.\r\n\r\nIn such cases of late conception, which occur after the normal cessation\r\nof menstrual activity, we cannot be certain whether we have to do with a\r\nsimple persistence of ovarian activity, associated with temporary or\r\npermanent cessation of menstruation; or whether both functions,\r\novulation and menstruation, had ceased, and were aroused to renewed\r\nactivity by some determinate cause. It is possible that in coitus we\r\nhave such a stimulus, capable of reawakening the slumbering ovarian\r\nfunctions. That this may be the case, we are led to suppose by the fact\r\nthat pregnancy at an unusually advanced age most frequently occurs as a\r\nresult of marriage late in life. In Scandinavian countries, where the\r\ndifficulties of providing for a family are so great that a very large\r\nnumber of marriages are inevitably postponed till comparatively late in\r\nlife, the number of pregnancies occurring in elderly women is\r\ncorrespondingly large. However, pregnancy late in life occurs also in\r\nwomen who have married early, and the most probable assumption to\r\naccount for such cases is that ovulation has occurred in the absence of\r\nmenstruation.\r\n\r\nAlthough by these cases the proposition is established that amenorrhœa\r\nis by no means equivalent to incapacity for ovulation, still, the former\r\nmust indubitably be regarded as in general a most important indication\r\nof disturbed ovulation. When a woman attains the age of 20 years without\r\nhaving ever menstruated, or even having experienced menstrual molimina,\r\nwe may in the great majority of such cases infer with justice that there\r\nis complete or partial failure of development of the ovaries and the\r\nreproductive apparatus generally. In some of these cases, examination\r\ndiscloses the fact that the uterus is in an infantile condition. When we\r\nare able to bring about the regular establishment of menstruation, we\r\nmay hope also to remove the sterility dependent upon the defective\r\novarian functional capacity. General tonic treatment for the relief of\r\nchlorotic amenorrhœa quite as often, in the case of previously barren\r\nmarried women, results in the occurrence of pregnancy, as happens in\r\ncases of amenorrhœa and sterility due to obesity, when this latter\r\ncondition has been relieved and menstruation has been re-established by\r\nsuitable dietetic treatment. Much less often is it possible to relieve\r\nthe sterility of scrofulous (tuberculous) persons, for in the majority\r\nof such cases, in consequence of the scrofulous (tuberculous)\r\nconstitutional disorders, pathological changes have occurred in the\r\novaries already in early youth, and these it is difficult or more often\r\nimpossible to remove.\r\n\r\nScrofula (tuberculosis) is, according to my own experience, the\r\nconstitutional disorder which of all most frequently and most seriously\r\naffects ovulation; and it appears that the ovaries are subject to\r\nchanges produced by this disease similar to those which occur in other\r\nglandular organs. In cases in which no cause of the existing sterility\r\nis ascertainable, the presence of scars due to scrofulous (tuberculous)\r\nchanges in the lymphatic glands may serve as an indicator to show that\r\nthe capacity for ovulation has been annihilated or seriously diminished\r\nin early life by scrofulous (tuberculosis) disease.\r\n\r\nAmong the causes of sterility, these three conditions: anæmia,\r\nchlorosis, and scrofula (tuberculosis), play a leading part; indeed,\r\ntheir importance in this connexion has hitherto been underestimated,\r\nmore especially in regard to the comparative frequency with which they\r\ncause sterility. A large part of the favourable influence in the relief\r\nof sterility in women which is exercised by the “cures” at various\r\nwatering places, depends upon the amelioration which is thus effected in\r\nthe aforesaid constitutional disorders.\r\n\r\nIt has been assumed that diabetes, which renders men impotent, is\r\ncompetent also to cause sterility in women. _Hofmeier_ reports a case\r\nwhich appears decisive on this point. In a woman 20 years of age, who\r\nhad menstruated regularly since she was 14 until a year previously, when\r\nthe flow had ceased, he found the uterus extremely small, barely 5 cm.\r\n(2 in.) in length, extremely atrophied, the ovaries also atrophied and\r\nvery small; the urine contained large quantities of sugar. Here was\r\ndoubtless a case of atrophy of the reproductive organs secondary to\r\ndiabetes.\r\n\r\nIn England, where the excessive use of alcohol is observed very\r\nfrequently in women as well as in men, sterility has frequently been\r\nregarded as a result of chronic alcoholism. _Matthews Duncan_ reports\r\ncases which lead to the belief that alcohol has a specifically\r\ndeleterious effect upon fertility. Apart from the general or\r\nconstitutional disturbances dependent upon the abuse of alcohol, this\r\nagent has in many cases a well-recognized pathogenic influence upon the\r\nfemale reproductive organs, the morbid condition which is most\r\nfrequently and most readily assignable to this cause being chronic\r\noophoritis. The obesity which so frequently results from alcoholic\r\nexcess is a contributory cause of sterility.\r\n\r\nCertain drugs, more especially quinine and morphine, are reputed to\r\ncause sterility. _Davies_, reviving an old opinion, considers that of\r\nall drugs tannin is the most effective in leading to sterility, and he\r\nconsiders tea-drinking as responsible for this effect.\r\n\r\nThe influence of certain cerebral affections and psychical disorders in\r\nchecking ovulation has been established. Thus, _de Montyel_ has recently\r\nshown that in families subject to hereditary mental disorders, there is\r\nan unusually large proportion (1 : 7) of barren marriages.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are many influences which are known to prevent or to\r\ndiminish ovulation in the case of the lower animals, and which may\r\ntherefore be assumed with considerable probability to have a similar\r\neffect in women. More especially we are here concerned with external\r\ninfluences affecting unfavourably nutrition and innervation, and\r\ntherewith also ovulation; also near kinship between the parties to the\r\nact of intercourse; and finally hereditary predisposition. In animals,\r\ncaptivity, exposure to cold, over-exertion, insufficient or unsuitable\r\nfood, and inbreeding, have been proved to result in infertility.\r\n\r\n_Doubleday_ asserted that “a too abundant supply of nutriment hinders\r\nreproduction, whereas on the other hand insufficient or improper food\r\nfavours reproductive activity and increases the number of the\r\noffspring.” _Spencer_, however, rightly points out that the infertility\r\nnoticed in these circumstances is not the direct result of prosperity,\r\nbut depends upon the pathological obesity which is thus engendered by\r\noverfeeding.\r\n\r\nNo less interesting are the observations that have been made regarding\r\nsterility in animals in confinement. In such animals there are wide\r\ndifferences. Some refuse to cohabit, or have lost sexual desire; others,\r\nagain, show excessive sexual desire and cohabit too often, without any\r\nresult; or even if fertilization occurs, abortion often ensues. In yet\r\nother cases, though conception follows intercourse, and the animals go\r\non to full term before delivery, the young are still-born, or are weakly\r\nand misshapen. Caged birds often lay no eggs at all or very few; or if\r\nthey do lay, they neglect their eggs; or if incubated, the eggs fail to\r\nhatch out. In France, experiments regarding this matter were made with\r\ndomestic fowls. If the hens were given great freedom, 20 per cent only\r\nof the eggs remained unhatched; with less freedom, 40 per cent of the\r\neggs were failures; whilst if the fowls were kept in a coop, 60 per cent\r\nof the eggs were unhatched.\r\n\r\n“Convincing proofs,” writes _Darwin_, “have been obtained to the effect\r\nthat wild animals which have recently lost their freedom have their\r\nfertility diminished to a most remarkable extent. This infertility is\r\nnot dependent upon any degeneration of the reproductive organs. There\r\nare many animals of the most diverse species, which, whilst they\r\ncopulate freely in confinement, fail in these circumstances to conceive;\r\nothers again, even if they conceive and have living young, give birth to\r\nthese in numbers which are unquestionably much smaller than would be the\r\ncase were the parents in the free state.”\r\n\r\nInteresting observations have been made by pigeon breeders. They state\r\nthat when pigeons brought up in the same nest pair, the number of their\r\noffspring is usually very small.\r\n\r\nThe influence upon fertility of unfavourable conditions of temperature,\r\neither excessive heat or excessive cold, is very great. In the case of\r\npigeons, for instance, if the pigeon cot is adjacent to the heated wall\r\nof a dwelling house, the pigeons sometimes begin to lay as early as\r\nJanuary, and may have young as often as eight times in a single year.\r\nWhen the dovecot is cold, on the other hand, the number of broods is\r\nsmaller. In general, the procreative capacity is greater in summer than\r\nin winter.\r\n\r\nAs regards inbreeding, many facts are on record showing the influence of\r\nthis practice in leading to the birth of malformed offspring and to\r\nsterility. _Darwin_ writes, “if in a pure race, characterized by a\r\ncertain tendency to sterility, we allowed only brothers and sisters to\r\npair, in a few generations the stock would become extinct.” If animals\r\nclosely related by blood pair, the number of their offspring is always\r\nless than the average.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the human species, however, the influence of the marriage\r\nof near kin in diminishing fertility cannot be regarded as definitely\r\nproved.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the incapacity for ovulation and the sterility dependent\r\nthereupon are hereditary—paradoxical as this may appear. It is necessary\r\nto assume, that just as the sperm is at times unsuited for effective\r\nfertilization, so also the ova may be in a less or greater degree\r\ninsusceptible of fertilization. In the present state of our knowledge,\r\nindeed, we are not in a position to be precise as to the exact nature of\r\nsuch incapacity. It is possible that the enveloping membrane of the ovum\r\nvaries in its resistance to penetration, as _Schenk_ claims to have\r\nproved in respect of certain of the lower mammals. In his experiments on\r\nartificial fertilization outside the body of the mother, he ascertained\r\nthat the cells derived from the discus proligerus, surrounding the ovum\r\nin immediate contact with the zona pellucida, are in some instances\r\neasily separable one from another, so that the spermatozoa can readily\r\nobtain access to the zona pellucida; whereas in other instances, in\r\nwhich the ovum is of the same size and apparently in the same stage of\r\nmaturation as before, these cells remain closely attached each to the\r\nother, and thus prevent the passage of the spermatozoa. This condition\r\nof the ovum, so unfavourable to fertilization, may be hereditary in\r\ncertain families, and its transmission may render certain members of the\r\nstock infertile. Such instances as the following from my own practice\r\nare by no means rare. Of three sisters, whose family life was intimately\r\nknown to me, one had one child only, a girl, whilst the two others\r\nremained childless. The girl of the second generation married and\r\nremained childless. In England it is well established that when, in\r\ncases of only-child-sterility, the offspring is of the female sex, this\r\nchild will probably herself be barren. _Galton_ found that in the case\r\nof 14 heiresses (i. e. the only children of wealthy parents), all of\r\nwhom were married, 8 remained absolutely barren, whilst of the others, 2\r\nhad each an only child.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly believed that when a woman gave birth to twins of\r\nopposed sexes, the female infant would prove to be barren, this\r\nbarrenness being associated with defective development of her\r\nreproductive apparatus. _John Hunter_ (Animal Economy) ascertained that\r\nin the case of twin calves of opposed sex, the genital organs of the\r\nfemale twin were almost invariably imperfectly developed. But the\r\nsupposition that this is true also of the human species has not been\r\nconfirmed by experience. I know several married women who had twin\r\nbrothers, and these women have borne normal children; however, the\r\nnumber of their offspring is remarkably small. _Simpson_, in Edinburgh,\r\nrecorded the results of the marriage of 113 women who had been born with\r\ntwin brothers; of these, 103 had proved fruitful, and 10 (i. e., about\r\none eleventh of the whole) barren, although of these latter women, one\r\nhad been married upwards of 5 years, and the remaining 9 for periods\r\nranging from 10 to 40 years. _Simpson_ also gave the history of four\r\nwomen who were all the fruit of triple births, some of which had\r\nconsisted of two boys and one girl, others of two girls and one boy. All\r\nfour of these women were parous. Again, a woman who had been one of a\r\nquadruple birth (three boys and one girl), herself gave birth to\r\ntriplets. A collection of all the figures accessible to me relating to\r\nthis subject, indicates that about ten per cent of the women born in\r\nsuch circumstances prove barren—a ratio which corresponds closely with\r\nthe ratio of infertility in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Interference with Conjugation, Conditions Preventing Access of the\r\n                       Spermatozoa to the Ovum._\r\n\r\nA condition essential to fertilization is a material union between the\r\nsexual products of the male and the female respectively—the act of\r\nconjugation. Thus, all conditions which prevent the spermatozoa from\r\nobtaining access to the ova, bring about sterility.\r\n\r\nSpermatozoon and ovum being normal, a great variety of pathological\r\nconditions may prevent the one from gaining access to the other. It is\r\nnecessary for fertilization that the mature ovum should leave the ovary,\r\nenter the Fallopian tube, and there come into contact with the male\r\nsperm. Interference with any one of these essentials may lead to\r\nsterility.\r\n\r\nThus, the constitution of the ovum itself may be at fault; or the\r\nentrance of the ovum into the Fallopian tube may not be normally\r\neffected; defects in these earliest stages of the process of\r\nfertilization are precisely the commonest and the most important. The\r\nemergence of the ovum from the graafian follicle may be rendered\r\ndifficult or entirely prevented by pathological states of the ovary;\r\nagain, by inflammatory processes in the ovary, the tubes, or the\r\nligaments, by developmental defects in the tube, and by obstructions in\r\nits interior, the entrance of the ovum into the tube, and its free\r\npassage along the tube may be prevented. Numerous abnormalities and\r\ndiseases of the uterus may on the one hand prevent the entrance of the\r\novum into the uterine cavity, and on the other may prevent the upward\r\npassage of the spermatozoa to their goal. Amongst conditions competent\r\nto produce these effects we must enumerate: displacements of the uterus,\r\nstructural changes in this organ and its annexa, and other congenital\r\ndefects and acquired states; more particularly must be mentioned, uterus\r\ninfantilis, acquired atrophy of the uterus, flexions and versions of the\r\nuterus, new-growths and inflammatory states of that organ, abnormalities\r\nin the shape or size of the cervix uteri, and, finally, all conditions\r\nof the vagina or vulva which hinder the proper performance of the act of\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nIn diagnosing the cause of sterility, in determining whether in any\r\nparticular instance it is due to some hindrance to the indispensable\r\nconjugation between the male and female reproductive elements, we have\r\nin the first place to ascertain the presence or absence of any of the\r\nnumerous conditions which interfere with the proper passage of the ovum\r\nfrom the ovary through the Fallopian tube to the interior of the uterus.\r\nThe simpler mechanical hindrances to conception, such as displacements\r\nof the uterus, or tumours of that organ or its annexa, are easily\r\nrecognized; and the same is true of atresia of the cervix uteri, and of\r\ncongenital or acquired stenosis of the vagina. When obliteration or\r\nstricture of the genital tract exists, a very careful examination,\r\nvisual, digital, and instrumental, must be made, rectal examination not\r\nbeing forgotten. Not infrequently, amenorrhœa is attributed to ovarian\r\ndisease, and only subsequently on local examination is the cause\r\nascertained to be hymeneal atresia, with haematocolpos; many a woman has\r\nbelieved herself to be pregnant, until examination has disclosed the\r\nfact that the hymen is still intact, and that coitus has hitherto been\r\neffected through the urethra. The importance of these stenotic\r\nconditions as causes of sterility must not, however, be overestimated,\r\nfor, although they are common among the hindrances to conception, the\r\nobstacle is by no means always insuperable.\r\n\r\nMorbid changes in the secretions of the genital passages, whereby the\r\nvitality of the spermatozoa may be destroyed before they have time to\r\nreach the ovum and effect fertilization, are hard to diagnose, for the\r\nconditions upon which such changes depend have not as yet been\r\nadequately investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _Diseases of the Ovaries and the Fallopian Tubes._\r\n\r\nAmong the conditions which, although the maturation of the ovum proceeds\r\nnormally to a conclusion, may prevent conjugation between the male and\r\nfemale elements, we must in the first place consider an abnormal\r\ncondition of the tunica albuginea of the ovary, a thickening of this\r\nmembrane in consequence of inflammatory processes or of new formation of\r\nconnective tissue, whereby the dehiscence of the follicle is rendered\r\ndifficult or entirely prevented. Such thickenings of the ovarian\r\nenvelope are the residue of perioophoritic processes.\r\n\r\nSuch a hindrance to conception may be permanent or transient, and thus\r\nthe sterility dependent thereupon may be relative or absolute. Similar\r\nis the effect of inflammatory processes affecting the peritoneal\r\ninvestment of the uterus, the broad ligaments, and the peritoneum\r\nclothing the floor of the pelvis; these conditions, perimetritis,\r\nperisalpingitis, and pelvic peritonitis, resulting in the formation of\r\nthick and extensive pseudomembranous bands, or in less severe cases\r\nleaving merely slight adhesions and filaments, which drag the uterus and\r\nthe ovaries out of place, and thus render conception difficult or\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nPerimetritic adhesions are apt to lead to dislocation of the tubes\r\neither forwards or backwards, and most commonly into the pouch of\r\nDouglas, thus giving rise to sterility. _Rokitansky_ and _Virchow_\r\nalready insisted on the great importance of perimetritic processes in\r\ncausing sterility.\r\n\r\nThat congenital defects of the Fallopian tubes may lead to sterility, is\r\nindeed a possible, but certainly a rare occurrence. The defect may be\r\nunilateral or bilateral; or it may be that merely a portion of one tube\r\nmay be wanting. Bilateral absence of the Fallopian tubes is usually\r\nassociated with defective development of the uterus, while the ovaries\r\nmay be apparently normal. Such a case is described by _Foerster_ and\r\n_Kussmaul_. The vagina opened into the urethra, the uterus was not\r\ncalibrated, and diverged above into two solid horns, to which the round\r\nligaments and the ovaries were attached. A congenital cause of sterility\r\nis to be found also in atresia of the tubes, the abdominal extremities\r\nof which are closed; this condition is met with also in other mammals.\r\nIt is also assumed, with less accuracy, that a supernumerary ostium\r\ntubae may lead to sterility, in consequence of the ovum, which has found\r\nits way into the normal ostium, returning into the abdominal cavity\r\nthrough the supernumerary orifice. An unfavourable influence upon\r\nfertility is exercised also by a form of hyperplasia of the tubes which\r\nsometimes arises in consequence of erroneous development at the time of\r\npuberty; the tubes, increasing unduly in length, become serpentine in\r\nform instead of being nearly straight; this tends to lead to\r\naccumulation of the secretions, and renders the passage of the ovum\r\ndifficult. (_Freund_.) Yet another defect of development which, as\r\n_Klebs_ has pointed out, may lead to sterility, is absence of the\r\nfimbria which normally retains the abdominal orifice of the Fallopian\r\ntube in proximity with the ovary, in which case these structures may be\r\nseparated by a wide interval.\r\n\r\nThe entry of the ovum into the tube may thus be rendered difficult by\r\nabnormalities of the abdominal orifice of the tube or of the fimbriae;\r\nbut still more is this the case when the mucous membrane of the tube is\r\ndiseased. The fringed border of the tubal orifice has a distinct\r\ntendency to independent disease. As _Klebs’s_ anatomicopathological\r\nstudies have shown, inflammatory changes are common in this region,\r\nleading to contraction. The free margin of the tube then appears to be\r\nstrictured by overgrowth of fibrous tissue on the serous surface, the\r\nopening being thus narrowed or even entirely closed, whilst the fimbriae\r\nthemselves may be drawn within the aperture. In other cases, the ring of\r\nfimbriae is adherent to some neighbouring part, especially to the ovary\r\nitself, when this also is diseased. Further, on the fringed margin of\r\nthe tube we see papillary growths, telangiectases, or oedema with\r\nformation of cystic cavities.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the tubes also, pathological processes occur,\r\ncatarrhal inflammations, haemorrhagic or purulent exudations, sealing up\r\nthe passage completely. In some cases these exudations lead to great\r\ndistension and even to rupture of the tube. Thus, among the causes of\r\nsterility must be enumerated: simple catarrh of the tube, with swelling\r\nof the mucous membrane; purulent catarrh, leading to its distension with\r\npus—pyosalpinx; serous effusion into the tube, hydrosalpinx; and\r\nhaemorrhagic effusion, haematosalpinx; further, that peculiar form of\r\ntubal inflammation, described by _Chiari_ and _Schauta_ under the name\r\nof salpingitis isthmica nodosa, in which hyperplasia of the muscular\r\ncoat of the tube occurs at irregular intervals, so that it appears to be\r\nbeset with nodes. Special mention must also be made of gonorrhoeal\r\nsalpingitis, which will subsequently be described in detail.\r\n\r\nInflammatory states of the tube may hinder conception, either\r\nmechanically, by swelling of the mucous membrane, or by obstruction of\r\nthe lumen of the tube by exudations, by injury or destruction of the\r\nciliated epithelium, by lesion of the musculature of the tube, affecting\r\nits peristaltic movements—all these hindering or entirely preventing the\r\npassage of the ovum downwards or of the spermatozoa upwards; or, again,\r\nchemically, by the deleterious influence of many of the morbid\r\nsecretions that are formed in these conditions upon the vitality of ova\r\nor spermatozoa. These inflammatory states of the tubes may also lead to\r\nstricture or obliteration of their abdominal extremities, or to\r\ndisplacement of the ostia, and thus lead to sterility; in other cases\r\nthese same conditions, leading to distortion and displacement of the\r\ntube, may prevent the downward passage of the ovum while leaving\r\npossible the upward passage of the spermatozoa, and thus give rise to\r\ntubal gestation—a condition which we shall not now consider.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that tuberculosis of the genital canal attacks\r\nthe tubes with especial frequency; in these organs we may find miliary\r\ntubercles, and more commonly diffuse caseous masses, completely filling\r\nthe lumen of the canal. Finally we have to mention the diverse forms of\r\nsaccular dilatation of the tubes (Ger. “_Tubensäcke_”), all of which\r\npossess the common pathological characteristics of enlargement of the\r\ntubes and their conversion into saccular cavities; the contents of these\r\ndistended tubes may, however, be extremely various, and such conditions\r\nmay depend upon manifold mechanical disturbances and inflammatory\r\nprocesses of the uterus and its annexa.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider how common, during the sexual life of women, are\r\nperioophoritic inflammations, more or less intense, but often without\r\nsevere symptoms (and hence apt to be overlooked); when we remember that\r\nthe very process of ovulation and also the puerperal state furnish\r\nopportunities for slight or severe pelvic peritonitis to arise; and when\r\nwe further take into account the frequency and importance of gonorrhoeal\r\npelvic peritonitis—we cannot fail to admit that the results of these\r\nmorbid conditions, such as adhesions between the ovary and the ostium\r\ntubae, or closure of the tube with consequent hydro- or pyosalpinx, must\r\nbe reckoned among the principal causes of sterility. If the frequency\r\nand importance of these conditions is still underestimated, two reasons\r\ncan be adduced for this: first, that the slighter degrees of intrapelvic\r\ninflammation often, as previously mentioned, elude diagnosis; and,\r\nsecondly, that even when the treatment is expectant merely, the\r\nexudations are frequently absorbed, the adhesions give way, and the\r\ncapacity for conception is gradually fully restored.\r\n\r\nWhen considering the etiology of acquired sterility, especial attention\r\nmust be devoted to gonorrhoeal pyosalpinx, the most important and the\r\nmost dangerous of the morbid manifestations of gonorrhoeal infection in\r\nthe female. Gonorrhoeal salpingitis and perisalpingitis are very serious\r\naffections, in the first place because they are apt to give rise to\r\noophoritis and perioophoritis, as well as to pelvic peritonitis, and\r\nother local inflammatory states. The minuteness of the uterine orifice\r\nof the Fallopian tube, and the downward direction of the ciliary\r\nmovement in the interior of the tube, combine to safeguard against the\r\nentrance of gonococci, but none the less they too often find their way\r\nup the tube, and small quantities of gonorrhoeal pus enter the pelvic\r\ncavity and give rise to inflammations, in which the ovary partakes.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Saenger_, this gonorrhoeal disease of the uterine annexa\r\nis found with especial frequency in women either wholly sterile or\r\naffected with only-child-sterility, and is to be regarded as the cause\r\nof their infertility; “infertility is indeed the rule, fertility the\r\nexception, in all cases in which gonorrhoeal disease has passed upwards\r\nbeyond the os uteri externum.” The same author maintains that, putting\r\naside tuberculosis and actinomycosis, if, in a case of infective\r\ninflammation of the uterine annexa, septic infection can be excluded,\r\nand more especially when the disease affects both tubes, when it is\r\nreluctant to yield to treatment, and when relapses are frequent, we have\r\nno option but to believe that the affection is of gonorrhoeal origin.\r\n\r\nIn 155 cases of chronic inflammatory disease of the Fallopian tubes,\r\n_von Rosthorn_ was able in 37 instances to prove that the affection was\r\nthe direct result of gonorrhoeal infection.\r\n\r\nRecently, however, _Noble_ has published cases which lead us to believe\r\nthat even pyosalpinx does not necessarily prevent the occurrence of\r\npregnancy. In operating for the relief of a unilateral pyosalpinx, the\r\nuterus was opened, and a seven months’ foetus was removed. In another\r\ncase, the autopsy on a woman who had succumbed to severe peritonitis\r\narising immediately post partum, disclosed a large pyosalpinx.\r\n\r\nClosure of the ostium may also be brought about by chronic metritis and\r\nendometritis, by chronic catarrhal states of the uterine mucous\r\nmembrane, and in general by pathological changes in that membrane\r\nassociated with local hyperaemia or abnormal secretions. In some cases,\r\nsalpingitis with consequent sterility is the result of puerperal\r\ninfection; and such a sequence of events is especially common after an\r\nabortion followed by retroflexion of the uterus, leading to elongation\r\nand kinking of the tubes.\r\n\r\nAn important hindrance to the entry of the ovum into the uterus is\r\nsometimes offered by uterine polypi or myomata; growing from the fundus,\r\nthese may so fill the uterine cavity that the uterine orifices of the\r\ntubes appear to be completely occluded.\r\n\r\nAt times, also, quite small myomata, growing close to the tubes, may\r\npush these latter upwards, closing them, and thus giving rise to\r\nsterility; such myomata may also lead to saccular dilatation of the\r\ntubes, as occurred in the following case:\r\n\r\nMrs. S., aged 39 years, had one child when 20 years of age, but since\r\nthen had been barren. For several years she had suffered from profuse\r\nmenorrhagia. Owing to the enormous thickening of the abdominal wall,\r\nbimanual examination of the uterus was impossible; the vagina was\r\nrelaxed, enlarged, and contained an excess of mucous secretion. The\r\nuterus was high up in the pelvis, anteverted, enlarged, movable,\r\nsensitive to pressure; the portio vaginalis was enlarged, soft, and\r\nexcoriated; no tumour could be detected either in the uterus or in the\r\nuterine annexa. The menstrual flow recurred at intervals of from two to\r\nthree weeks, lasting from one to two weeks, and being extremely profuse;\r\nmenstruation was painful. Whilst the patient was under my observation an\r\nexcessive menstrual haemorrhage came on quite suddenly, with slight rise\r\nof evening temperature (38.2° C.—100.8° F.), but severe general\r\ndisturbance; there were paroxysms of intense abdominal pain, violent\r\nvomiting of greenish bilious masses, which after a time became\r\nhaemorrhagic, the abdomen was tense and sensitive to pressure, there was\r\ncardiac weakness with general failure of strength; treatment proved\r\nunavailing, and the patient died in collapse on the third day. The\r\nautopsy disclosed: fibroma uteri submucosum, parietale, et subserosum,\r\nhaematosalpinx dextra, pyosalpinx sinistra, peritonitis. The subserous\r\nmyoma, of about the size of a pea, was in the middle of the fundus\r\nuteri; the submucous myoma, of about the size of a chestnut, filling the\r\nuterine cavity, sprang from the posterior wall of the body of the\r\nuterus; the intramural myoma, of about the size of a bean, was in the\r\nright wall of the corpus uteri. Both tubes were greatly elongated,\r\nexhibiting serpentine windings. The right tube was much distended,\r\nfilled with sanguineous fluid; the left, partially collapsed, contained\r\ngreyish-green purulent material, having an extremely offensive odour;\r\nsome of this fluid had flowed through the ostium abdominale into the\r\nabdominal cavity. Death in this case ensued with great rapidity in\r\nconsequence of rupture of the pyosalpinx, and evacuation of its contents\r\ninto the abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\nCystic formations in the round ligament (hydrocele of the round\r\nligament) sometimes lead to sterility. In the form of elongated tumours\r\nof about the size of a hen’s egg they may fill the inguinal canal, and\r\neven pass forwards into the labia majora. When as large as this, they\r\ndemand operative interference. _Hennig_ records a case in which such\r\nhydrocele of the round ligament was the cause of sterility lasting 14\r\nyears, the woman becoming pregnant after the tumour had been removed by\r\noperation. Similarly, infertility may depend upon solid tumours of the\r\nround ligaments—myomata, fibromyomata, or sarcomata.\r\n\r\nRetro-uterine haematocele often gives rise to sterility. As a rule,\r\nprior to the formation of a blood-tumour in the pouch of Douglas,\r\nvarious menstrual disturbances occur, more especially menorrhagia; or it\r\nmay be preceded by some puerperal disease, especially perimetritis,\r\nwhich by itself, indeed, seriously limits the fertility of the woman\r\nthus affected; but when haematocele is superadded, her child-bearing\r\ncapacity is much more gravely impaired, owing to the permanent\r\ndisplacement of the uterus, to the perimetritic exudations, to the\r\nadhesions formed around the ovary, and to stricture or occlusion of the\r\ntubes. Still, sterility is by no means an inevitable consequence of\r\nhaematocele.\r\n\r\nBy many it is assumed that in cases in which the tubes are perfectly\r\nnormal, disturbances of innervation are competent to cause sterility (or\r\ntubal gestation). It is supposed that nervous influences affect the\r\nfunctions of the Fallopian tubes by leading to spastic contractures of\r\nthe circular muscular fibres of these structures, or in other cases to\r\nparalysis; in this way nervous disorder may lead to the retention within\r\nthe tube of the unfertilized (or already fertilized) ovum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Diseases of the Uterus._\r\n\r\nPathological changes in the uterus may in various ways lead to sterility\r\ndependent upon prevention of conjugation (physical contact of the male\r\nand female reproductive elements). Thus, the incapacity for\r\nfertilization may, on the one hand, depend on hindrances to the passage\r\nof the ovum from the tube to the interior of the uterus; or on the\r\nother, on some abnormal condition of the vaginal portion of the cervix,\r\nwhereby the passage of the spermatozoa from the vagina into the uterus\r\nis prevented; or, finally, upon displacements of the uterus or\r\npathological structural changes in that organ, whereby the implantation\r\nof the fertilized ovum in the uterine cavity and its development therein\r\nare impeded.\r\n\r\nThe uterus may be entirely absent, but this is an extremely rare\r\ncondition; much less infrequent is a rudimentary condition of that\r\norgan. In the latter case, it is either represented by a nodular\r\nrudiment, or else it is conical or bicorned; whatever its shape, it is a\r\nsolid mass of muscular and connective tissue. In association with\r\nabsence or a rudimentary condition of the uterus, the vagina also may be\r\nwanting, or may be represented merely by a small, blind pouch; the\r\nFallopian tubes may in such cases either be normally developed or\r\nrudimentary. The number of instances of this kind that have been\r\nobserved is very large (_Kussmaul_, _Klebs_, _Cusco_, _Klinkosch-Hill_,\r\n_Cruise_, _Freund_, _Fürst_, _Engel_, _Gusserow_, _Nega_, _Kiwisch_,\r\n_Rokitansky_, _Braid_, _Jackson_, _Lucas_, _Duplay_, _Dupuytren_,\r\n_Renaudin_, _Crédé_, _Saexinger_, and many others).\r\n\r\nThe uterus and the vagina may be absent in cases in which the vulva is\r\ndeveloped in a perfectly normal manner, with a mons veneris projecting\r\nas usual, and covered with a proper growth of hair. _Ormerod_ and\r\n_Quain_ have reported cases of this kind, in which the external sexual\r\ncharacters were those of a fully mature, perfectly developed woman, but\r\nin whom the uterus and ovaries were entirely wanting.\r\n\r\nThese defects of development necessarily entail complete sterility.\r\nSometimes during life the cause of the sterility is entirely overlooked,\r\nand only discovered by chance or in post mortem examination. Although\r\nthe vagina usually shares to a marked extent in the defects of the\r\nuterus, and at puberty undergoes a rudimentary development merely, the\r\nmarital intercourse of such individuals commonly appears to be perfectly\r\nnormal. As a result of frequently repeated and vigorous attempts at\r\nintercourse, the rudimentary vagina becomes accommodated to the needs of\r\nthe case; and even when the vagina is absent, the rudimentary depression\r\nby which it is represented becomes distended into a large blind sac\r\ncapable of accommodating the erect penis. In other such cases, the penis\r\nfinds for itself some abnormal channel, and the husband may continue to\r\nindulge in intercourse for a long period without discovering that there\r\nis anything unusual. Sometimes it is the urethra which becomes dilated\r\nand takes on in part the function of the vagina; in other cases\r\nintercourse is effected per anum.\r\n\r\nThe following most remarkable case came under my own observation. The\r\npatient’s husband was a physician, who nevertheless was in complete\r\nignorance of his wife’s abnormalities. The woman was 26 years of age, of\r\nmedium stature, somewhat obese, breasts moderately well developed, pubic\r\nhair well grown. She stated that before marriage she had menstruated\r\nregularly, and that it was only after she had married four years\r\npreviously that menstruation had ceased—statements which were\r\nunquestionably false. She consulted me on account of amenorrhœa and\r\nsterility, which her husband believed to depend upon her increasing\r\nobesity. Examination showed that the vagina admitted two fingers and was\r\n10 cm. (4″) in length; but it was completely blind, and the mucous\r\nmembrane was strikingly smooth. On bimanual examination, only a rudiment\r\nof the uterus could be detected, a mass no larger than a hazel-nut; the\r\novaries could not be felt.\r\n\r\nA similar case is recorded by _Heppner_. A Finnish peasant woman 31\r\nyears of age consulted him on account of amenorrhœa and sterility. She\r\nhad been married for 12 years, and neither before marriage nor since had\r\nmenstruated or had had any periodic vicarious bleeding. The pubes and\r\nthe labia majora were thinly covered with hair; the latter were very\r\nflaccid and but slightly prominent; the nymphæ hung down like an apron\r\nfor as much as an inch below the genital fissure, and were very thin;\r\nthe clitoris was but slightly developed. The urethral papilla was of\r\nnormal size, the lacunæ around it were extremely well marked; the\r\nurethral orifice had the form of a zigzag slit. Behind this latter was\r\nan aperture environed by radiating folds, and this was the entrance to a\r\nblind passage about two inches in length; this aperture could not,\r\nhowever, be identified as the introitus vaginae, for the reason that\r\nthere were no carunculæ myrtiformes, and moreover the callosity of the\r\nmucous membrane characteristic of the vaginal orifice was wanting.\r\nBehind the strongly projecting commissura labiorum, however, the fossa\r\nnavicularis appears as a separate depression. The blind passage was\r\nclothed with a soft, pale-red mucous membrane, and was entirely devoid\r\nof any trace of columnæ rugarum; at the extremity of this passage there\r\nwas neither scar nor induration. On rectal exploration, no trace of\r\nuterus, normal vagina, or ovaries could be felt, notwithstanding the\r\nfact that the abdominal walls were very flaccid and examination was\r\ntherefore easy. The general configuration was feminine, the breasts were\r\nflabby and dependent, the waist and hips were those of a woman.\r\n\r\n_Tauffer_ reports the case of a woman 25 years of age, married 2½ years,\r\nabsolutely amenorrhoeic; on examination she was found to have atresia\r\nvaginae with rudimentary development of the uterus. The breasts were\r\nsmall, the mons veneris was deficient in fat, but thickly covered with\r\nhair, the labiæ and the clitoris were normal.\r\n\r\n_R. Levi_ describes a case in which, in a patient 19 years of age, the\r\nuterus was wanting, though the general physical development was that of\r\na normal woman. The breasts were well formed, and so also were the\r\nexternal genital organs; a blind passage 4 cm. (1.6 in.) in length, and\r\nadmitting two fingers, represented the vagina. In the position normally\r\noccupied by the ovaries, were two bodies which were doubtless the\r\nrudiments of these organs. Menstrual molimina had never been\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\n_Von Hoffmann_, in making a post mortem examination on an elderly\r\nmarried woman, found that the vagina ended blindly at a depth of 6 cm.\r\n(2.4 in.), whilst the uterus was represented merely by a pyramidally\r\narranged bundle of fibres in the broad ligament. _Lissner_ reports a\r\ncase in which the physician was the first to draw the husband’s\r\nattention to the fact that his wife had no uterus.\r\n\r\n_Ziehl_, in a married woman 57 years of age, found that the uterus was\r\ncompletely wanting; the vagina ended blindly half an inch from the\r\nsurface; the tubes and ovaries were present. _Boyd_, in a married woman\r\n72 years of age, found a blind vagina half an inch in length, and the\r\nuterus represented by a nodular rudiment on the posterior wall of the\r\nbladder.\r\n\r\nRare cases are also recorded in the literature of the subject, in which,\r\nnotwithstanding the absence of the uterus, normal ovaries were present,\r\nand in these latter periodic ripening of the graafian follicles took\r\nplace. A case of this kind was described by _Burggraeve_.\r\n\r\nComplete sterility is entailed also by a persistence of the foetal\r\ncondition of the uterus. In these cases, the uterus retains the form it\r\npossessed at the beginning of the second half of intra-uterine life. The\r\nportio vaginalis projects but slightly into the vagina, and the os uteri\r\nexternum appears as a small rounded opening. The cervix is comparatively\r\nlong and wide, and the folds on the mucous membrane of the cervical\r\ncanal are fully formed. The body of the uterus is imperfectly developed,\r\ntriangular in shape, with thin walls; it is shorter than the cervix, and\r\nits interior is marked by folds of mucous membrane converging towards\r\nthe os. In these cases menstruation is absent or scanty; the other\r\nreproductive organs, including the breasts, are usually in a state of\r\narrested development. Women with foetal uterus are capable of sexual\r\nintercourse, and carry on most of the functions of their sexual life in\r\na manner apparently normal; they are, however, invariably sterile.\r\n\r\nAn analogous cause of sterility is presented by the condition known as\r\nuterus infantilis, in which at puberty the uterus fails to undergo the\r\nchanges proper to this period, and remains in the condition\r\ncharacteristic of infancy. The cervix is disproportionately large,\r\nwhilst the body of the uterus is cylindrical in form, and the mucous\r\nmembrane lining its cavity is always smooth. The muscular substance is\r\nunduly thin. The vagina may be normal, sometimes, however, it is narrow,\r\nand the mucous membrane is less rugose than normal. Associated with an\r\ninfantile condition of the uterus we find commonly, but by no means\r\ninvariably, imperfect development of the external genital organs, the\r\nlabia, the clitoris, and the vagina; the mons veneris is but thinly\r\ncovered with hair; the breasts are small. As a rule, menstruation is\r\nentirely wanting. Occasionally the ovaries are wanting. This infantile\r\ncondition of the uterus is by no means extremely rare. According to\r\n_Beigel’s_ figures, among 155 sterile women, in four the uterus was\r\ninfantile.\r\n\r\nAmong 200 cases of sterility in which it was possible for me to make a\r\nsearching enquiry for the cause, I found 16 instances of infantile\r\nuterus. Neither in the general physical configuration of these women,\r\nnor in the state of their menstrual functions, was there any striking\r\nabnormality; in the condition of the external genital organs, however,\r\nin cases of defective development of the uterus and ovaries, certain\r\nstriking peculiarities were, in my experience, almost invariable, and\r\ndeserving therefore of close attention. The mons veneris was extremely\r\nsmall, sometimes completely bald, or covered very thinly with hair; and\r\nthe hair when present, did not exhibit the curliness usually seen in the\r\npubic hair of married women. On examination, the uterus, small in all\r\nits diameters from arrest of development, could in every case be\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nHow exceptional it is in adult females with well developed internal\r\nreproductive organs for the pubic hair to be scanty or completely\r\nwanting, has been shown by the investigation recently made by _R. Bergh_\r\non this hitherto neglected subject. In 2200 individuals engaged in\r\nclandestine prostitution, he found the pubic hair extremely scanty in\r\n148, and the genital region nearly or completely bald in 6. He states\r\nthat early vigorous growth of the pubic hair is a trustworthy sign of\r\nearly sexual development; but he remarks that the opinion of _Aristotle_\r\nthat women in whom the pubic hair is slight or absent are always\r\nsterile, is erroneous.\r\n\r\n  Note.—The author’s statement regarding the extreme infrequency of\r\n  absence or deficiency of the pubic hair in women with properly\r\n  developed internal reproductive organs, while true of European\r\n  women, does not apply to all races. In Japanese women, for instance,\r\n  the pubic hair is as a rule much scantier than in European women;\r\n  and baldness, complete or nearly complete, of the mons veneris is by\r\n  no means uncommon. It is the exception, in Japanese prostitutes, to\r\n  find a thick and vigorous growth of genital hair.—_Transl._\r\n\r\nIn the Talmud, there is an interesting reference to this subject, to the\r\neffect that it may be assumed that a woman is sterile if by the 20th\r\nyear of her life the pubic region be not yet covered with hair, if the\r\nbreasts be not developed, if coitus be difficult, and if the tone of the\r\nvoice be masculine.\r\n\r\nMadame _Boivin_, _Dugès_, _Lumpe_, and _Pfau_, maintain that the\r\ndevelopment of the uterus from the infantile condition to that\r\ncharacteristic of the sexually mature virgin, often occurs very late and\r\nvery slowly; and that women in whom we find the uterus in an infantile\r\ncondition, may later begin to menstruate and may become pregnant. It has\r\nbeen suggested that in these cases there has been confusion with primary\r\nacquired atrophy of the uterus. Still, that it is necessary to be most\r\ncautious in cases of infantile uterus in asserting that a woman is\r\npermanently sterile, has recently been forcibly impressed on me by a\r\nremarkable instance. A married woman consulted me some years ago on\r\naccount of amenorrhœa and sterility; examination showed clearly that the\r\nuterus was in the infantile condition, and for this reason, not I alone,\r\nbut several leading gynecologists, assured her that there was no hope of\r\nher ever becoming a mother; recently, however, after ten years of\r\nsterile wedlock, she was safely delivered of a healthy child.\r\n\r\nA sub-variety is constituted by the uterus pubescens, a uterus which\r\nindeed at puberty has undergone a certain degree of development, but has\r\nfailed to attain the normal size; in such cases the menses are regular,\r\nbut sometimes painful. This form of arrest of development of the uterus\r\nmay occasion sterility, which, however, often proves curable when by\r\nfrequent sexual intercourse and the congestion dependent thereon, the\r\ngenital organs have been stimulated to the completion of the process of\r\ndevelopment; the muscular strength of the uterus then becomes adequate,\r\nand the dysmenorrhœic troubles disappear. In general it may be said that\r\nif the rudimentary or imperfectly developed uterus is at all competent\r\nto carry out the function of gestation, the necessary changes sometimes\r\noccur in the organ with remarkable rapidity, and result in normal\r\npregnancy and parturition.\r\n\r\nUterus unicornis, when occurring alone, and not associated with other\r\ndefects or errors in development, is not a cause of sterility. Women\r\nwith a uterus unicornis, with or without an accessory horn, menstruate,\r\nconceive, and pass through pregnancy and parturition, in a perfectly\r\nnormal manner; indeed, some women with this developmental defect have\r\ngiven birth to twins. The assumption that uterus unicornis predisposes\r\nto abortion does not always hold good. If, however, pregnancy occurs in\r\na rudimentary horn, rupture of the membranes is inevitable, and the ovum\r\nor embryo passes into the abdominal cavity, with the usual accompaniment\r\nof fatal haemorrhage. The rupture commonly occurs between the third and\r\nthe fourth month of foetal life (months of four weeks each).\r\n\r\nThe uterus bicornis, with which may or may not be associated duplication\r\nof the vagina, does not as a rule offer any hindrance to conception; and\r\nthe same statement is true also of the uterus bilocularis or septus.\r\nWomen with these defects of development may give birth to healthy\r\nchildren; and some such women have had twins, each foetus occupying a\r\nseparate half of the uterus. Still, births in cases of double uterus and\r\nvagina are rare occurrences. Such cases have been published by\r\n_Lasarewitsch_, _Litschkus_, and _Készmarsky_. In very rare cases of\r\nuterus bicornis associated with double vagina, an obstacle to conception\r\nis offered by the fact that one side only of the double vagina, the\r\nlarger, is utilized in sexual intercourse, and that this is a blind\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nIn cases of uterus bilocularis seu septus, the conditions as regards\r\npregnancy and parturition are similar to those that obtain in cases of\r\nuterus bicornis. The twin uterus, uterus didelphys, the condition in\r\nwhich the uterus is represented by two completely separated halves, each\r\nof which has developed into an independent organ, has been observed, as\r\n_P. Müller_ has shown, in adults as well as in infants; this condition\r\noffers no obstacle to conception, unless, indeed, as occurred in a case\r\nof _Tauffer’s_, the vagina is rudimentary, so that normal sexual\r\nintercourse is impossible. _Satschoma_ reports a case of uterus\r\ndidelphys in which pregnancy occurred simultaneously in both uterine\r\ncavities.\r\n\r\nA careful distinction must be made between the congenital condition\r\nknown as the infantile uterus (i. e., congenital atrophy) and acquired\r\natrophy of the uterus, affecting the whole organ, or either of its\r\nsegments, the body or the cervix; the latter condition may offer merely\r\na transient and curable obstacle to conception.\r\n\r\nAcquired primary atrophy of the uterus occurs in weakly girls who, just\r\nbefore the age at which the uterus normally undergoes its transformation\r\ninto the adult state, have suffered from constitutional disorders, from\r\nchlorosis or anæmia, or from some other exhausting affection. The uterus\r\nis then small, limp, and flaccid, it is usually anteflexed, with a\r\nsmall, often insignificant portio vaginalis; the anterior lip of this\r\nstructure failing to project from the vaginal fornix; the vagina is\r\nusually short and narrow. This form of atrophy of the uterus is\r\ndistinguished from the foetal and from the infantile uterus more\r\nespecially by the fact that no disproportion exists between body and\r\ncervix, that the muscular wall is better developed, and that the general\r\nconfiguration of the uterus is rather that characteristic of the normal\r\nuterus of the sexually mature woman. Persons with primary atrophy of the\r\nuterus, are, moreover, backwards in the general development of their\r\nsexual characters; the breasts are small, the pubic hair is scanty, the\r\nmenstrual flow is insufficient or entirely wanting, whilst severe\r\ndysmenorrhœal manifestations are usual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 70.—Congenital Atrophy of the Uterus (after Virchow), oi, Ostium\r\n    internum; oe, Ostium Externum.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 71.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn favourable circumstances, when the constitution becomes more\r\npowerful, in these cases of primary atrophy of the uterus, improvement\r\ntakes place; the uterus undergoes further development, menstruation\r\nbecomes more abundant, and the woman may become pregnant. Such a\r\nfavourable prognosis cannot, however, be entertained if a severe flexion\r\nof the uterus is associated with the atrophy of the organ; or if the\r\novaries are also atrophied.\r\n\r\nSterility results also from puerperal atrophy of the uterus. This\r\ncondition is a sequel of severe puerperal diseases, metritis,\r\nparametritis, and perimetritis; sometimes, even in the absence of such\r\ninflammatory processes, it is due to puerperal hyperinvolution,\r\noccurring especially in women previously weak in constitution, and\r\nmanifested by the fact that, notwithstanding the weaning of the child,\r\nthe menstrual flow remains for months in abeyance. The uterus loses its\r\nfirm consistency; it is sometimes shortened, sometimes of normal length,\r\nbut the walls are always greatly thinned, so that, as _Schroeder_ points\r\nout, the sound can be readily felt, through the abdominal wall.\r\nPuerperal atrophy is a curable condition, so that the sterility\r\ndependent upon this disease is not necessarily permanent. Thus, in a\r\ncase of _P. Müller’s_, a woman in whom a twin delivery had been followed\r\nby extreme atrophy of the uterus, with well-marked symptoms both\r\nobjective and subjective, became once more pregnant eighteen months\r\nafter the termination of the twin pregnancy.\r\n\r\nOther forms of atrophy of the uterus have a similar deleterious effect\r\nto that exercised by puerperal atrophy, as, for instance, atrophy from\r\nthe pressure of tumours of the uterus, or of solid ovarian tumours; or,\r\nagain, atrophy due to defective innervation of the pelvic organs,\r\noccurring in various forms of paralysis, and characterised by amenorrhœa\r\nand extreme smallness of the uterus. _Von Scanzoni_ has seen several\r\ncases in which young women, previously healthy and menstruating with\r\nregularity, have been attacked by paralysis of the lower extremities,\r\nand thenceforwards have suffered from amenorrhœa and great contraction\r\nof the uterus; in some of these cases a post mortem examination was\r\nmade, and disclosed the existence of true atrophy of the uterus.\r\n_Jaquet_ saw a similar case of atrophy of the uterus in a lady who had\r\nbeen frightened by witnessing the storming of a barricade in front of\r\nher dwelling; she was then in her 22nd year, and had given birth to her\r\nsecond child 1½ years previously; thenceforwards she was completely\r\namenorrhoeic, and her uterus measured only 3 cm. (1.2 in.) in length.\r\n\r\nDisplacements of the uterus (flexions and versions), and abnormalities\r\nin the cervix uteri, are among the conditions which lead to sterility by\r\ninterfering with conjugation—by preventing the necessary physical\r\ncontact between the male and the female reproductive elements. The\r\nfrequency with which these diseases give rise to sterility is, however,\r\nfar from being so great as is commonly asserted by those who maintain a\r\nmechanical theory of conception.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _Pathological Changes in the Cervix Uteri._\r\n\r\nIn very early times, the attention of physicians was directed to\r\nabnormalities in the shape of the cervix uteri, as offering hindrances\r\nto the entry of the semen into the uterus. Amongst the writers of\r\nantiquity who have alluded to this matter, the names of _Hippocrates_\r\nand _Soranus_ must especially be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe normal cervix uteri (Fig. 72) has the form of a flattened ellipsoid,\r\nperforated throughout its longitudinal axis. On making a longitudinal\r\nsection of the cervical canal, we see that it is dilated in the middle,\r\nand tapers towards either extremity, having thus the shape of a spindle;\r\nthe internal os is, however, somewhat smaller than the external. The\r\nlatter (os uteri externum, os tincæ, often referred to without\r\nqualification as “the os”), has normally the form of a transverse\r\nfissure, which, however, tends more towards the circular form, the\r\nsmaller it is, and the more widely its margins are separated. In\r\nchildhood, in consequence of the infolding of its margins, the external\r\nos has usually a radiated form, later it becomes rounded, and only with\r\nthe attainment of sexual maturity does it assume the form of a\r\ntransverse slit. This form is maintained throughout the epoch of active\r\nsexual life; but after the climacteric, owing to the separation of the\r\nmargins of the orifice, it becomes once more rounded.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the greatly varying size and shape of the portio\r\nvaginalis, it may be said that in general its anterior lip _appears_ the\r\nshorter of the two, owing to the lesser depth of the anterior vaginal\r\nfornix, but that in reality the anterior wall of the cervical canal is\r\nlonger than the posterior; the actual length of the anterior lip of the\r\nportio vaginalis, measured from the summit of the anterior fornix, is\r\nfrom ½ to 1 cm. (0.2 to 0.4 in.), whilst the posterior lip, from the\r\nsummit of the posterior fornix to the end of the lip measures 1½ cm.\r\n(0.6 in.) and upwards. The position of the cervix is such that, owing to\r\nthe oblique direction of the long axis of the uterus, superadded to the\r\nabsolutely greater length of the anterior lip of the cervix, the plane\r\nacross the extremities of the two lips faces almost straight backwards.\r\nThe axis of the portio vaginalis forms a right angle with the axis of\r\nthe vagina; the cervical canal, however, is not usually straight, but\r\nhas a slight S-shaped curvature. The mean length of the cervical canal\r\nin the virgin uterus is 3 cm. (1.2 in.). (_Lott_.)\r\n\r\nThe “ideal” form of the cervix uteri and of the os uteri externum is\r\ndescribed by _Sims_ in the following terms: “The vaginal portion should\r\nmeasure about one fifth, certainly not more than one fourth, of the\r\nentire length of the cervix uteri; that is, the anterior lip should have\r\na length of one-fourth to one-third of an inch, and the posterior lip\r\nshould be a fraction longer. The cervical canal should either be\r\nstraight, or have a forwardly directed curve; the cervical axis should\r\nform a right angle with the vaginal axis; the cervix should not be\r\nmarkedly anteverted or retroverted.” _Sims_ is of opinion that every\r\nwoman whose uterus is in this condition will conceive within three or\r\nfour months from the time when she first enters upon conjugal\r\nintercourse; he adds, however, the important proviso, “be it understood,\r\nthat all else is in order.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 72.—Normal Portio Vaginalis.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 73.—Conoidal Portio Vaginalis.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn conception, the cervix uteri subserves the important function of\r\nproviding for the free passage of the spermatozoa to the interior of the\r\nuterus; and when we consider the nature of the processes of sexual\r\nintercourse and fertilization, and more especially when we bear in mind\r\nthat normally the two lips of the cervix and the upper segment of the\r\nvagina form a chamber for the retention of a portion of the seminal\r\nfluid in contact with the os uteri externum, we are readily led to\r\nassume that any great abnormality, in size of the cervix (enlargement or\r\ndiminution), in its shape (malformation), or in its position\r\n(displacements—flexion, version, or prolapse), or, finally, stenosis of\r\nthe cervical canal,—may offer mechanical hindrances to conception. And\r\nexperience shows that this assumption is justified, at any rate as\r\nregards conical elongation of the portio vaginalis (Fig. 73), as regards\r\nan apron-shaped or beak-shaped hypertrophy of the anterior lip of the\r\ncervix (Figs. 74 and 75), as regards flexion upwards of the elongated\r\ncervix, and also as regards stenosis or obliteration of the external or\r\nthe internal os; although the reservation must be made that no matter\r\nhow unfavourable the shape of the portio vaginalis, no matter how\r\nextensive the changes in the cervix uteri, as long as a permeable upward\r\npassage for the spermatozoa exists, conception is still possible, and in\r\nexceptional cases may occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 74.—“Apron-shaped” Vaginal Portion. a. Greatly elongated anterior\r\n    lip; b. Shorter posterior lip of the cervix.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 75.—“Beak-shaped” Vaginal Portion. Posterior aspect.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the cervix is hypertrophic and greatly enlarged, and the vaginal\r\nfornix consequently much elongated, conception is rendered difficult,\r\nfor the reason that in such cases, either the semen rapidly flows out of\r\nthe vagina, or else a proper juxtaposition between the penis and the\r\nexternal os no longer occurs, and the semen is ejaculated at some\r\ndistance from the os. The change in the shape of the portio vaginalis,\r\nand also the elongation of the cervical canal, are additional obstacles\r\nto the entrance of the spermatozoa into the interior of the uterus; as\r\nregards the former condition, in nulliparae the portio vaginalis is\r\ncommonly conical, or pointed, whilst the external os is very small, thus\r\nrendering the passage of the spermatozoa a difficult matter; but in\r\nparous women, it is lobulated, owing to the presence of deep fissures,\r\nwhereby the penis is conducted into the vaginal fornix, and the\r\nejaculation of the semen in this locality is facilitated. Hence, such\r\nhypertrophy of the cervix and the portio vaginalis often coincides with\r\nthe occurrence of sterility. The hypertrophy is less apt to cause\r\nsterility when it is limited to one lip of the cervix, unless, indeed,\r\nthe affected lip (more commonly the anterior) is so greatly enlarged\r\nthat it bends over and occludes the external os, whilst conducting the\r\npenis into the fornix and away from the orifice. Cases have been known\r\nin which a single lip of the cervix was hypertrophied to such an extent\r\nas to protrude between the labia.\r\n\r\nThe commonest malformation of the cervix is the conical cervix, when the\r\ncervix is not merely elongated, but tapering; associated with this\r\ncondition is usually found a notable diminution in size of the os uteri\r\nexternum. According to _Sims_ we find “conical cervix in 85% of all\r\ncases of natural sterility.” According to the same author, even in the\r\nabsence of the conical form of cervix, “sterility is probable in cases\r\nin which the portio vaginalis projects fully half an inch into the\r\nvagina; if the cervix projects more than one inch, sterility almost\r\ninevitably results; whilst if elongation is even greater than this, so\r\nthat the vaginal portion measures from one and a half to two inches,\r\nsterility is absolutely certain.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, congenital smallness of the portio vaginalis, the\r\ncondition in which this organ appears merely as a slightly projecting\r\nnodule on the upper part of the anterior wall of the vagina, the\r\nanterior vaginal fornix being almost non-existent, and the posterior\r\nfornix very extensive—a wide cul-de-sac—is also unfavourable to\r\nconception. The probable reason is that, in consequence of this\r\ndeformity, the semen, after being ejaculated into the posterior fornix,\r\nflows away down the posterior wall of the vagina, without coming into\r\ncontact with the short portio vaginalis.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Beigel_, another frequent cause of sterility is to be\r\nfound in the existence of the so called “apron-shaped” portio vaginalis,\r\nthe condition in which, either from congenital deformity, or else from\r\nhypertrophy or some other disease, one lip of the vaginal portion is so\r\nformed as greatly to exceed the other in length.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of hypertrophy, the portio vaginalis may assume other,\r\nvery various forms; in some cases it may increase in size to such an\r\nextent that it projects into the vagina as a thick, hard ball, and thus\r\noffers a serious obstacle to the reception of the semen; or, again, in\r\nthe form of the elongated, slender cervix, it may become doubled upon\r\nitself, and in this way hinder the passage of the spermatozoa (Figs. 76\r\nand 77). Deformities of the cervix due to hypertrophy of the portio\r\nvaginalis, rarely cause congenital sterility, but more commonly the\r\nacquired form; for such hypertrophy is hardly ever congenital, occurs\r\nbut rarely in virgins, and is usually met with in married women who have\r\nhad difficult deliveries, and consequently have suffered from uterine\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nAnother deformity of the vaginal portion of the cervix which is\r\nimportant in its relations to sterility is the “snout-shaped cervix.”\r\nHere the cervix is thinnest immediately at its insertion into the\r\nvaginal fornix, and thickens gradually below, so that the organ\r\nresembles a swine’s snout in form. As a rule, this deformity is due to\r\ndiffuse hypertrophy of the connective tissue of the cervix, the result\r\nof chronic endometritis and cervicitis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 76.—Simple Hypertrophy of the Portio Vaginalis, which projected\r\n    from the Vulva.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 77.—Elongated Cervix, bent upwards.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Fritsch_, however, in two cases of characteristic _col tapiroid_, saw\r\npregnancy occur after the relief of the previously existing uterine\r\ncatarrh; in one of these cases the condition of the organs was virginal,\r\nso that it was hardly possible to believe that the patient was a\r\nmultipara; even after she had had three children, the os uteri externum\r\nwith difficulty admitted the passage of the uterine sound.\r\n\r\n_Pajot_ has devoted especial attention to the hindrances that are\r\noffered to the entrance of the spermatozoa by displacements of the\r\ncervix. In these cases, during coitus, the extremity of the glans penis\r\nis not in contact with the os uteri externum, but passes into a kind of\r\ncul-de-sac; in retroversion the posterior fornix; in anteversion, the\r\nanterior fornix; in lateral version, the lateral fornix of the side\r\nopposed to that towards which the lower extremity of the cervix points.\r\n\r\nComplete absence of the vaginal portion of the cervix puts difficulties,\r\nthough not very serious ones, in the way of conception, since the\r\nsegment of the uterus which combines with the upper segment of the\r\nvagina to form a receptaculum seminis, is wanting. How important in\r\npredisposing to fertilization is efficient contact of the external\r\norifice of the vaginal portion with the ejaculated semen during and\r\nimmediately after intercourse, seems to be established by my own\r\nobservation, that women of small stature married to men of average\r\nheight exhibit much higher proportional fertility than women of average\r\nstature. In the case of these small women, the favourable circumstance\r\nis obvious, inasmuch as intimate contact is facilitated between glans\r\npenis and portio vaginalis. I have frequently heard complaints, from the\r\nhusbands of such women, that a single coitus is sufficient to ensure\r\nconception; and again and again I have been informed by such women that\r\nthey have had 10, 12, or 16 children. In one such instance known to me,\r\nthe wife had been pregnant 23 times, and had given birth to 19 normal\r\nchildren. Contrariwise, women with a very long vagina, and with a high\r\nposition of the portio vaginalis, do not so easily become pregnant.\r\n\r\nOf special importance in the causation of sterility is stenosis of the\r\ncervical canal. This may be congenital, and then usually affects the\r\nwhole length of the canal; or it may be acquired, being dependent upon\r\ninflammation of the mucous membrane. In these latter cases, the swollen\r\nfollicles of the mucous membrane burst, and their granulating walls\r\nadhere. Other causes of acquired stenosis are trauma, severe operative\r\nprocedures during parturition, puerperal inflammations, syphilitic\r\nulceration, adhesion of the opposed granulating surfaces after operative\r\nmeasures (as, for instance, after severe cauterization, or after\r\namputation of the portio vaginalis), and, in short, from scar-formations\r\nhowever caused.\r\n\r\nGeneral swelling of the tissues leading to stenosis occurs at the\r\nexternal os in hyperplastic uteri of virgin configuration; the small\r\nround orifice characteristic of the virgin uterus becomes narrowed, or\r\neven completely occluded, by the swelling of the tissues of the vaginal\r\nportion. True adhesion of the walls does not occur in these cases, but\r\nthe minute aperture left by the swelling of the walls of the canal is\r\nplugged by the epithelium, so that a small blind depression in the\r\ncentre of the portio vaginalis is all that remains of the cervical\r\ncanal. Such a condition is seen with especial frequency in cases of\r\nprolapse of the vaginal portion, and is often erroneously regarded as an\r\nobliteration of the os uteri externum by epithelial adhesion (_Klebs_).\r\nFinally, stenosis of the cervical canal may be caused by tumours, and\r\nalso by the flexions and versions of the uterus presently to be\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nCongenital atresia of the uterus is generally associated with other\r\ndevelopmental anomalies of the reproductive organs. In some cases, all\r\nthat is at fault is that the mucous covering of the vaginal portion\r\npasses uninterruptedly from one lip to the other; but in others, the\r\ncervix is unperforated throughout, and the vaginal portion is but\r\nslightly developed.\r\n\r\nAcquired obliteration of the cervical canal may affect either the\r\nexternal or the internal os, with a shorter or longer portion of the\r\nrest of the canal. When very extensive necrosis of tissue has occurred,\r\nas a sequel of difficult delivery, the adhesion may include the\r\nadjoining segment of the vagina (utero-vaginal atresia).\r\n\r\nThe more marked the stenosis of the cervical canal, the smaller the\r\npassage by which the vagina communicates with the uterus, the more\r\ndifficult will it be for the passage of the spermatozoa to be effected,\r\nso that of the millions of spermatozoa deposited in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe os uteri, thousands will, as in normal cases, find their way to the\r\nuterine orifices of the Fallopian tubes. So much the more, then, is the\r\ncontact between spermatozoon and ovum rendered difficult, and so much\r\nthe more unlikely is it that conception will occur. Moreover, in\r\nconsequence of the stenosis, there is retention of the cervical mucus,\r\nwhich becomes thick and glutinous, and offers a further obstacle to the\r\npassage of the spermatozoa. The unfavourable influence upon the\r\npossibility of conception is, finally, increased if, as is often the\r\ncase, in association with the stenosis, the cervix becomes elongated and\r\nassumes a conical form (these secondary changes probably resulting from\r\nthe inflammatory states of the cervix common in cases of stenosis); and\r\nan additional obstacle is offered to conception by the association with\r\nthe stenosis of flexion or version of the uterus. It is in such\r\ncomplicated cases that we so often have the associated symptoms of\r\ndysmenorrhœa and sterility; the dysmenorrhœa being due to the fact that\r\nthe menstrual discharge, if abundant, is unable to flow away with\r\nsufficient rapidity through the greatly narrowed cervical canal; exuding\r\nfrom the vessels of the uterine mucous membrane more rapidly than it can\r\nbe discharged, it accumulates in the uterine cavity, and gives rise to\r\npainful contractions of the uterus.\r\n\r\nPrecisely what degree of narrowing of the cervical canal it is which\r\nconstitutes pathological stenosis, is in practice by no means easy to\r\ndefine; and only in regard to extreme cases of pathological constriction\r\ncan there be no possibility of dispute. In cases of congenital stenosis\r\nof the cervical canal, the diagnosis is very easy, for the os uteri\r\nexternum is then always extremely small; often the aperture is no larger\r\nthan a small pin’s head, a very fine probe can be passed through it with\r\nconsiderable difficulty and its passage is opposed all the way up to the\r\ninternal os. But in cases of acquired stenosis of moderate severity, the\r\ndiagnosis is often difficult. Owing to the small size of the orifice,\r\nand to the distensibility of the soft parts by which it is surrounded,\r\nexact measurements are impossible. When the os is with difficulty\r\ndetected by the skilled finger, when the sound is not readily introduced\r\nby the experienced hand, slipping past again and again, and inserted\r\nonly after repeated efforts—such an os is, as _Olshausen_ insists,\r\nalways pathological. The normal virgin os uteri permits the easy passage\r\nof a thick uterine sound with a diameter of 3 to 4 millimeters (⅛ to ⅙\r\nin.); but there are cases in which, though a sound of this normal size\r\ncan be passed, the os gives to the examining finger the sensation of\r\nbeing contracted. If, in such a case there is typical mechanical\r\ndysmenorrhœa with sterility, _Olshausen_ considers that we are justified\r\nin assuming the existence of pathological stenosis of the os uteri, and\r\nin treating the case accordingly.\r\n\r\nHowever, as _Kehrer_ insists, it may be one of the greatest difficulties\r\nin diagnosis—a difficulty not always to be resolved even when all the\r\nattendant circumstances have received the fullest and most painstaking\r\nconsideration—to determine whether in any individual case an anomaly of\r\nthe cervix, such as stenosis of the external os or of the whole cervical\r\ncanal, is or is not to be regarded as a cause of sterility. When\r\nstenosis is extreme, there need be no two opinions about the matter; the\r\ndifficulty is in cases lying somewhere between a moderate degree of\r\ncontraction and the lower physiological limit of smallness. Every\r\nexperienced gynecologist will have seen such cases as _Kehrer_\r\ndescribes, in which before marriage the os appeared extremely small, and\r\nyet soon after marriage the woman became pregnant. For this reason we\r\nare justified, with _O. Johannsen_, in reverting rather to the\r\nfunctional than to the anatomical conception of stenosis, and in\r\nmaintaining that so long as the cervical canal is sufficiently large to\r\npermit the uterine secretions to flow freely away, any stenosis that may\r\nexist is devoid of pathological significance. Only when the outlet for\r\nthe uterine secretions is insufficient, so that the uterine cavity\r\nbecomes distended (as manifested by an elongation of the canal in the\r\nsupravaginal portion of the uterus, and by various disorders, amongst\r\nothers chronic endometritis), is the stenosis with its consecutive\r\ndilatation of the uterus a serious obstacle to conception. “In such\r\ncases, the contractions of the uterus during coitus will not suffice to\r\nexpress the secretions it contains through the narrowed os, and the\r\ninevitable consequence of the incomplete evacuation of the uterus is\r\nthat the aspiratory phase of the orgasm fails to occur.”\r\n\r\nAccording to _Winckel_, stenosis of the external or of the internal os\r\nis a cause of sterility only in cases in which it arises from a\r\nfollicular inflammation of the cervical mucous membrane; in such cases,\r\nthe os, (internal or external, as the case may be), being greatly\r\nnarrowed by the numerous retention cysts, offers an obstruction to the\r\nevacuation of the glutinous secretion of the follicles yet remaining\r\nopen. This secretion may offer an insuperable hindrance to the passage\r\nof the spermatozoa; but in the absence of catarrh of this character, a\r\nmoderate degree of contraction of the cervical canal will not prevent\r\nthe outflow of the menstrual discharge, or the upward passage of the\r\nspermatozoa.\r\n\r\nThe experience of horse and cattle-breeders also shows the etiological\r\nimportance of stenosis of the cervix in the production of sterility: and\r\nin the case of mares and cows who are unfruitful from this cause,\r\nartificial dilatation of the cervix has often been performed, with\r\nresulting restoration of fertility.\r\n\r\nSwelling of the follicles of the mucous membrane of the cervical canal\r\nor of the cavity of the uterus, a condition which often results from\r\ncervical catarrh, will, equally with stenosis of the cervical canal,\r\nlead to sterility; pushing the mucous membrane before them, and becoming\r\npedunculated, these swollen follicles ultimately enlarge to form polypi\r\nof the cervical canal or the uterine cavity, and may at times completely\r\nocclude the uterine canal. In Fig. 78 is depicted a polypus of this\r\nkind, which I removed from the cervix of a barren woman 30 years of age.\r\nOn the apex of the polypus was a large ovulum Nabothi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 78.—Cervical Polypus, originating from an Ovulum Nabothi.\r\n]\r\n\r\nLong-standing cervical catarrh readily leads to stenosis of the cervical\r\ncanal, and consequently to sterility. The swelling and hypersecretion of\r\nthe cervical mucous membrane the more readily hinders the entrance of\r\nthe semen, inasmuch as the mucous folds on the anterior and posterior\r\nwalls of the cervical canal which combine to form the _plicae palmatae_\r\nare in the normal state already sufficiently prominent; but in cases of\r\ncatarrhal swelling they may project to such an extent as completely to\r\nocclude the canal. Stagnation of the thickened secretion offers in these\r\ncases a further hindrance to the passage of the spermatozoa, a\r\nstagnation which becomes aggravated if in course of time the os becomes\r\nstenosed by overgrowth of scar tissue. Ultimately, also, in cases of\r\nchronic catarrh, a flexion of the enlarged and flabby corpus uteri\r\nreadily occurs, and this imposes an additional difficulty in the way of\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that those women who in girlhood have suffered\r\nfrom prolonged cervical catarrh, so often remain childless. The sequence\r\nof events is that already described: follicular catarrh, stagnation of\r\nsecretions, stenosis of the cervical canal, enlargement and loss of tone\r\nof the uterus; the thin-walled, enlarged, and flaccid uterus ultimately\r\ngives way before the intra-abdominal pressure, bending back, usually,\r\ninto the pouch of Douglas. Thus, retroflexion of the uterus is a common\r\nsequel of cervical catarrh (_Hildebrand_). In some cases of sterility\r\ndependent upon cervical catarrh, this sequence of troubles has not\r\noccurred, and it is merely the mucus in the canal which prevents the\r\npassage of the spermatozoa. _B. Schultze_ reports the case of a woman\r\nwho had lived for 13 years in sterile wedlock, but became pregnant after\r\na single removal of the cervical mucus.\r\n\r\nThe significance of chronic cervical catarrh in the causation of\r\nsterility explains how it is that in many cases of barren marriage the\r\nblame ultimately rests upon the husband, who, when he married, was\r\nsuffering from “latent gonorrhoea,” the inconspicuous relic of an acute\r\nattack, undergone, it may be, months and even years previously, and\r\ninfected his wife with the disease. Such a gonorrhoeal catarrh is in\r\nwomen especially apt to assume a chronic form, and will then induce all\r\nthe secondary morbid conditions previously described, and thus lead to\r\nsterility.\r\n\r\nGonorrhoea in women frequently results in sterility. In addition to the\r\neffect of cervical stenosis and of a morbid condition of the cervical\r\nmucus in preventing the upward passage of the spermatozoa, this disease\r\nmay lead to many other changes inimical to fertility. Thus, gonorrhoeal\r\ninfection in women often leads to inflammatory manifestations in the\r\nperitoneum, the perimetrium, and the parametrium, and to catarrhal\r\nchanges in the Fallopian tubes (salpingitis, hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx);\r\nthese prevent the contact of spermatozoon and ovum, or cause\r\npathological distortions of the walls or calibre of the tubes, which\r\nconstitute permanent hindrances to the occurrence of conception. Young\r\nmarried women, whose husbands at the time of marriage were the subjects\r\nof incompletely cured gonorrhoea, and who shortly after marriage suffer\r\nfrom cervical catarrh, the discharge from the inflamed mucous membrane\r\nnot infrequently having a suspicious greenish colour analogous to that\r\nseen in recent gonorrhoea in the male, often remain sterile for long\r\nperiods, owing to this gonorrhoeal cervical catarrh, endometritis, and\r\ntubal catarrh. For the diagnosis in such cases, in addition to noticing\r\nthe virulent character of the inflammation of the vulva, urethra, and\r\nvagina, we must invoke the aid of the microscope; and it will often be\r\npossible to decide at once that the inflammation is gonorrhoeal by\r\nfinding Neisser’s diplococci enclosed within the pus cells of the\r\ncervical secretion.\r\n\r\nThe influence of “latent gonorrhoea” in diminishing the fertility of\r\nwomen has been especially asserted—and overestimated—by _Nöggerath_.\r\nFrom the fact that about 90% of sterile women are married to men who\r\nhave suffered from gonorrhoea either before or during their married\r\nlife, he infers that the sterility is due to latent gonorrhoea\r\ncommunicated from husband to wife. If this inference were justified,\r\nsterility would be far commoner than it actually is. _Nöggerath_ makes\r\nuse of the term “latent gonorrhoea” because the woman becomes infected\r\nwithout the obvious outbreak of any acute phase of the disorder. The\r\ndisease remains latent, and a radical cure is not to be expected until\r\nthe menopause. According to _Nöggerath_, there are four varieties of\r\nthis disease: acute, recurrent, and chronic perimetritis, and\r\noophoritis, always accompanied by catarrh of the mucous membrane of the\r\ngenital organs.\r\n\r\n_Saenger_, also, has asserted that 12% of all cases needing\r\ngynecological treatment are of gonorrhoeal origin; and he even considers\r\nthat the consequences of gonorrhoea are in women more dangerous and\r\ndestructive than those of syphilis. _E. Martin_ has also maintained that\r\nendocervicitis leading to stenosis of the os uteri externum and of the\r\ncervical canal is, in the majority of sterile young wives, due to\r\ngonorrhoeal infection derived from a chronic, unhealed, but\r\ninconspicuous, gonorrhoea in the husband. He further considers it\r\npossible that various kinds of mechanical stimulation, for example,\r\nintra-vaginal onanism, may, in certain conditions, give rise to\r\ninflammation eventuating in cervical stenosis.\r\n\r\nOf great interest are the mutual relations between dysmenorrhœa and\r\nsterility, a matter to which some allusion has already been made. A high\r\ndegree of stenosis of the cervical canal is competent to produce both\r\nthese symptoms; but dysmenorrhœa may arise from many other causes which\r\nhave no direct influence in preventing conception.\r\n\r\nToo much stress has, in fact, been laid upon the association of\r\ndysmenorrhœa with sterility, and I must therefore point out that I have\r\nseen numerous instances of dysmenorrhœa, including the so-called\r\nspasmodic form of the disease, in women who have given birth to many\r\nchildren; that objectively, in such cases, there was an absence of that\r\nrigidity of the cervix to which _Matthews Duncan_ attached so much\r\nimportance; and, finally, that even when the dysmenorrhœal pains had\r\nsubjectively all the character of labour pains, the introduction of the\r\nsound could be effected without using any great force, and without\r\ngiving rise to any severe pain.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, those authors, with _Sims_ at their head, go too far,\r\nwho regard dysmenorrhœa as a constant sign of stenosis of the cervical\r\ncanal, and hence infer that in all cases in which sterility is\r\nassociated with dysmenorrhœa, the sterility is due to such stenosis—an\r\nopinion contested by _Schultze_ on the ground of anatomical\r\ninvestigations. Dysmenorrhœa gives no indisputable sign that the cervix\r\nis stenosed to such a degree as to hinder the occurrence of conception;\r\nand _Sims’s_ view, that in the great majority of cases dysmenorrhœa is\r\ndue to mechanical obstruction, is not supported by experience. Women who\r\nsuffer from severe dysmenorrhœa, frequently become pregnant, though\r\nlater, it may be, than women in whom menstruation is normal and\r\npainless. Dysmenorrhœa is not due solely to contraction of the cervical\r\ncanal, but also to a variety of other pathological conditions. The\r\nanomalies of the genital organs which give rise to dysmenorrhœa do not,\r\nfor the most part, offer any obstacle to conception; and, on the other\r\nhand, stenosis of the cervical canal may exist in women who are entirely\r\nfree from dysmenorrhœa.\r\n\r\nIn order to test _Sims’s_ theory of the mutual interdependence of\r\ndysmenorrhœa and sterility, _Kehrer_ conducted an investigation into the\r\nstate of menstruation both before and after marriage in relation to the\r\nfertility or infertility of the marriage. He ascertained that in sterile\r\nwomen virginal dysmenorrhœa had only been a very little commoner than in\r\nfruitful women. Hence, the changes in the reproductive organs upon which\r\nthe occurrence of dysmenorrhœa depends, must not be regarded as\r\nnecessarily constituting hindrances also to conception.\r\n\r\nEnglish gynecologists differ from those of Germany in believing that\r\nthere is an intimate causal relation between dysmenorrhœa, and more\r\nespecially spasmodic dysmenorrhœa, and sterility. The assumption is,\r\nthat the contractions of the uterus, which by their violence during\r\nmenstruation give rise to pains like those of labour, occur also during\r\ncoitus; by these contractions, the entry of the semen into the uterus is\r\nprevented, or, if the semen does enter the uterus, it is speedily\r\nexpelled. This spasmodic dysmenorrhœa has also been called mechanical or\r\nobstructive dysmenorrhœa, in order to call attention to the theory that\r\nthe aim of the cramp-like contractions of the uterus is the expulsion of\r\nthe menstrual blood which has accumulated in the uterine cavity;\r\nalthough _Duncan_ himself is compelled to admit that neither the alleged\r\nmechanical obstruction, nor the accumulation of menstrual blood, nor yet\r\nthe dilatation of the uterine cavity, can actually be proved to occur.\r\n\r\n  NOTE.—The author is not quite correct in his contrast between\r\n  “English” and “German” opinion in this matter. Most English\r\n  gynecologists follow Matthews Duncan in calling attention to the\r\n  fact that, as Herman puts it, “spasmodic dysmenorrhœa is often\r\n  associated with sterility”; but almost all careful writers insist\r\n  that while the association is proved, the nature of the causal\r\n  connexion, if such exists, has not been elucidated. For instance,\r\n  writing on this very question of the association of dysmenorrhœa\r\n  with sterility, Hart and Barbour remark, “after a careful survey of\r\n  the literature, we come to the conclusion that any discussion of\r\n  sterility in which mechanical considerations have a prominent place,\r\n  must be inadequate, and will always be bootless.” It is true that\r\n  Matthews Duncan writes (_Diseases of Women_, Lecture on\r\n  _Sterility_), “The most generally recognized cause of sterility is\r\n  spasmodic dysmenorrhœa”; but a careful perusal of the whole lecture\r\n  will show that Duncan is saying more than he really means in using\r\n  the word “cause,” and that what he wishes to insist upon is the\r\n  frequent and indisputable association of the two conditions. In the\r\n  lecture on _Spasmodic Dysmenorrhœa_ he writes, “Latterly it has been\r\n  generally described as obstructive or mechanical dysmenorrhœa; these\r\n  words ‘obstructive’ and ‘mechanical’ implying a theory of the\r\n  disease which ... I am sure is quite erroneous.” Obviously, then,\r\n  Kisch does injustice to Matthews Duncan when he writes that the\r\n  latter is “compelled to admit” (_obgleich Duncan selbst zugeben\r\n  muss_), what he was as a fact one of the first to maintain, in the\r\n  face of considerable opposition!—_Transl._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 79.—Ectropium in a Case of Bilateral Laceration of the Cervix.\r\n    After A. Martin.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Duncan_ goes so far as to maintain that no actual or suspected local\r\ndisturbance has such significance in connexion with the doctrine of\r\nsterility as spasmodic dysmenorrhœa. It possesses this significance\r\nowing to the probable connexion between the dysmenorrhœic neurosis and\r\nthe outflow of the semen, the deficiency of the sexual impulse and of\r\nsexual pleasure, and other disturbances of sexual excitement during\r\ncoitus. With the relief of the dysmenorrhœa, we have, _Duncan_ holds,\r\nmade a long stride towards the cure of the sterility. Among 332 married\r\nwomen who were absolutely sterile, _Duncan_ found 159, nearly half of\r\nthe total number, who were affected with spasmodic dysmenorrhœa.\r\n\r\n_Burton_, in order to ascertain with certain beyond question whether\r\nstenosis of the external or internal os gives rise to dysmenorrhœic\r\ntroubles, examined six women during menstruation and at the time when\r\nthey were experiencing the greatest pain; he found in no one of them any\r\ntrace of narrowing of the canal. Owing to the congestion that occurs at\r\nthis time, the uterus becomes erect, and any moderate flexion that may\r\nexist is temporarily straightened. In all the cases, the sound could be\r\npassed with extreme ease.\r\n\r\nEctropium of the lips of the cervix (“granular erosion”) constitutes a\r\nhindrance to conception which is by no means rare; the condition is due\r\nto deep lateral lacerations of the cervix. The gaping of the cervical\r\ncanal arising from such old-standing, often overlooked, cervical\r\nlacerations and from the parametric scars associated therewith, causes\r\nvarious irritative manifestations: blenorrhoea, blennorrhagia, cystic\r\ndegeneration of the mucous membrane, and these secondary conditions may\r\nbe contributory causes of sterility; but lacerations of the cervix with\r\nectropium interfere in a manner purely mechanical with the proper\r\nconstitution of a receptaculum seminis and with the aspiration of the\r\nsemen into the cervical canal. (Fig. 79.) In an earlier section of this\r\nwork I laid stress on the fact that in the act of conception the\r\nmusculature of the cervix had in a sense an active part to play; and the\r\nproper performance of this role is prevented by cervical lacerations.\r\nThe cervical glands also suffer in cases of ectropium, and their\r\nfunction in facilitating the entrance of the spermatozoa into the\r\nuterine cavity is no longer properly performed. Finally, it is worthy of\r\nnote that sexual gratification, the sensation of voluptuous pleasure\r\nduring the sexual act, seems to be diminished in women with cervical\r\nlacerations, a fact noted especially by _Mundé_ and _Ill_. The\r\nlast-named found that in 34 women thus affected, sexual gratification\r\nwas no longer experienced in intercourse; whilst in 27 of these cases,\r\nrestoration of the integrity of the cervix by operation was followed by\r\nreturn of normal sexual feeling. In women who have given birth to one or\r\ntwo children, and then for a long time have remained barren, we not\r\ninfrequently find deep cervical lacerations. _Breisky_, _Spiegelberg_,\r\n_Schultze_, and _Goodell_ have operated in such cases, and shortly after\r\nthe operation pregnancy has recurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Displacements of the Uterus._\r\n\r\nWith less justice than in the case of the pathological changes in the\r\ncervix above described, it is maintained that displacements of the\r\nuterus form a very frequent cause of mechanical hindrances to\r\nconception, and thus give rise to sterility.\r\n\r\nIt certainly cannot be denied that displacements of the uterus are found\r\nvery commonly in sterile women; and, on the other hand, among women with\r\npathological flexion of the uterus, the percentage of the sterile is far\r\nhigher than among women with a uterus normal in position and shape—but\r\nfrom these facts it would be erroneous to infer the general conclusion\r\nthat displacements of the uterus offer a mechanical hindrance to\r\nconception. The casual connexion is less simple than this as a rule. In\r\nmost cases in which displacements of the uterus are associated with\r\nsterility, there are additional pathological states of the uterus and\r\nits environment, relics of previous inflammation in the uterus, the\r\nuterine annexa, or the parametrium, or displacements of the uterine\r\nannexa; these changes may be either the cause or the result of the\r\nexisting displacement of the uterus, and it is upon them, and not\r\nprimarily upon the displacement, that the sterility depends. The\r\naccuracy of this view is proved by the experience, by no means an\r\nuncommon one, that in such cases, when the actual cause of the sterility\r\nis removed, the woman will become pregnant, although the displacement of\r\nthe uterus persists.\r\n\r\nHow difficult it is, in a particular case, to determine whether the\r\npathological anteflexion is the true obstacle to conception, or the\r\nantecedent parametritis posterior and the concomitant metritis and\r\nendometritis! How can we decide whether a retroflexion is the simple\r\nmechanical cause of sterility, or whether the latter condition does not\r\nrather depend upon complicating perimetritis and oophoritis?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we must not fly to the other extreme, and absolutely\r\ndeny that a displacement of the uterus can be the mechanical cause of\r\nsterility. We meet with cases in which we are forced to assume that the\r\nflexion interferes both with the outflow of the menstrual blood and with\r\nthe ingress of the seminal fluid. And this is true, not merely of\r\nflexion to an acute angle, often associated with infantile dimensions of\r\nthe cervical canal or of the external or internal os, but also of those\r\nadvanced degrees of flexion in which, doubtless in part also from the\r\naccompanying catarrh, complete stenosis of the os uteri externum has\r\nresulted. The combination of displacement of the uterus with stenosis of\r\nthe cervix, is in these cases the essential hindrance to conception.\r\nWhen the os is reasonably large, a moderate flexion of the uterus\r\nforwards, backwards, or to one side or the other, will not often prevent\r\nconception, for the action of the muscular bands in the various\r\nligaments of the uterus will retain the os in a sufficiently favourable\r\nposition. But if a contracted os is associated with flexion, sterility\r\nis very likely; and almost inevitable, if fixation of the flexed uterus\r\nhas occurred from inflammatory exudation and fibrosis in one of the\r\nbroad ligaments.\r\n\r\nThat the belief that displacements of the uterus constitute an obstacle\r\nto conception is a widely diffused one, is shown by the fact that among\r\ncertain nations a means employed for the prevention of pregnancy is the\r\nartificial production of displacements of the uterus.\r\n\r\nOf the displacements of the uterus, the versions, anteversion,\r\nretroversion, and lateral version, have a more pronounced influence in\r\nhindering conception than the flexions; for, in the case of version of\r\nthe uterus, the uterus moves as a whole round a horizontal axis, so that\r\nwhen the fundus moves in one direction, the portio vaginalis moves in\r\nthe opposite. When the neck of the uterus is thus displaced, the tip of\r\nthe glans penis fails during coitus to come into contact with the os\r\nuteri externum, as it normally should do, and passes into a vaginal\r\ncul-de-sac, in retroversion, the posterior fornix, in anteversion, the\r\nanterior fornix, and in lateral version the lateral fornix of the side\r\nopposite to that towards which the cervix uteri is directed. In high\r\ndegrees of this malposition, the vaginal fornix covers up the os\r\nexternum as with a valve. (_Beigel._)\r\n\r\n_Von Scanzoni_ has especially insisted upon the frequency with which\r\nsterility results from chronic metritis complicated with anteversion. In\r\n59 sterile women affected with chronic metritis, he found in 34\r\ninstances more or less pronounced anteversion, and hence was led to\r\ninfer that this particular combination of disorders plays a great part\r\nin the production of sterility.\r\n\r\nEspecially frequent is sterility in cases of anteversion of the uterus,\r\nif in addition there is some contraction, even though moderate in\r\ndegree, of the os uteri externum; this combination of disorders is one\r\nextremely unfavourable to the entrance of the spermatozoa into the\r\nuterus.\r\n\r\nFlexion of the uterus offers less hindrance than version to the entrance\r\nof the spermatozoa, for the reason that in the former condition the\r\nrelations between the vaginal portion and the glans penis during coitus\r\nare not affected. But when the flexion is extreme in degree, the\r\ncervical or uterine canal may at some point become absolutely impassable\r\nfor the spermatozoa; and further, extreme flexion is apt to lead to the\r\noccurrence of parametritis and perimetritis. But, generally speaking,\r\nflexions of the uterus are far less often the cause of sterility, than\r\nwas formerly supposed. It used to be believed that flexion of the uterus\r\nwas followed by stenosis of the os uteri externum, by which the outflow\r\nof the menstrual blood and the ingress of the semen were equally\r\nprevented. It is true that infantile acute-angled flexion of the uterus\r\nis often associated with infantile stenosis of the cervical canal or of\r\nthe internal or external os; and it is also true that extreme degrees of\r\nflexion associated with uterine catarrh, favour the occurrence of\r\nstenosis and obliteration of the external os; but _B. Schultze_ rightly\r\ninsists that in most of the cases in which a diagnosis is made of\r\nstenosis of the uterine canal associated with a flexion of the sexually\r\nmature uterus, the supposed “stenosis” merely represents the difficulty\r\nwhich has been experienced in passing the customary rigid uterine sound\r\npast the angle in the uterine canal. Still, the fact remains, that among\r\nwomen with uterine flexion there is a larger percentage of sterile\r\nindividuals than among women whose uterus is normal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 80.—Anteflexio Uteri. After A. Martin.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs regards anteflexion of the uterus, either the congenital,\r\nuncomplicated anteflexion of the uterus, due to developmental anomaly,\r\nor the acquired form, due either to subinvolution of the uterus during\r\nthe puerperium, or to parametritic or perimetritic processes,—may offer\r\nmechanical obstacles to conception, and thus give rise to sterility;\r\nsterility with anteflexion occurs especially in cases in which the\r\nanteflexion is dependent upon parametritis posterior, associated with\r\nmetritis and endometritis, or when any other complication is present to\r\nmake the flexion a severe one. In some sterile women, we find\r\nanteflexion associated with supravaginal elongation of the portio, and\r\nin such cases both states would appear to result from catarrh of the\r\nuterine mucosa. How frequent is the combination of anteflexion of the\r\nuterus with sterility, is shown by the figures published by _Sims_, who\r\nin 250 cases of congenital sterility found 103 cases of anteversion, and\r\nin 255 cases of acquired sterility found 61 cases of anteversion.\r\n\r\n_Fritsch_ writes in the following terms regarding the difficulty with\r\nwhich impregnation is effected in women suffering from anteflexion of\r\nthe uterus: “In cases of anteflexion of the uterus, the vagina is\r\nremarkably long, the portio vaginalis often badly formed; the ejaculated\r\nsemen flows away rapidly from the contracted vagina, without, perhaps,\r\never coming into contact with the portio vaginalis.” He states it as a\r\nfact that women with anteversion conceive less readily than those with\r\nretroversion of the uterus (when this latter is moderate in degree); for\r\nin slighter degrees of retroversion, the axis of the uterus is a\r\ncontinuation of the axis of the vagina, so that the orifice of the male\r\nurethra and the os uteri externum will be in contact during\r\nintercourse—more especially because in such cases, owing to the portio\r\nvaginalis being low in the pelvis, the vagina is short; in cases of\r\nanteversion, on the other hand, the cervix is high up, and the vagina is\r\nlong and narrow. _Fritsch_ considers that generally speaking the fact\r\nthat the internal or the external os is small is of little importance;\r\nbut the serious factors, those leading to sterility in cases of\r\nanteversion—apart from all other considerations—are the unfavourable\r\nhigh position of the portio vaginalis, the occlusion of the os by the\r\nclose application of the posterior vaginal wall, and the presence of\r\nglutinous mucus in the cervical canal. Since in cases of anteflexion we\r\nvery commonly find hypersecretion of the uterine mucous membrane,\r\nwhilst, owing to the narrowing of the external os, the mucus is unable\r\nto flow freely away, but accumulates and becomes inspissated, we have\r\nthe uterine mucous membrane covered with a tenacious coating, which may\r\nperhaps render the implantation of the ovum a very difficult matter,\r\neven though the upward passage of the spermatozoa be still possible. The\r\nclinical association of pain produced by drawing forward the portio\r\nvaginalis, with marked anteflexion of the uterus, dysmenorrhœa, and\r\nsterility, is a strikingly common one.\r\n\r\n_Schröder_ points out that, although sterility is common in cases of\r\nanteflexion, cases are yet seen in which, notwithstanding the existence\r\nof extreme anteflexion, conception occurs very speedily after marriage.\r\nThe fact that in cases of anteflexion we have difficulty, not\r\nimpossibility, of conception, explains how it is that of two women\r\nsuffering from anteflexion of the same severity, one will readily become\r\npregnant, whilst the other remains permanently barren.\r\n\r\nRetroversion and retroflexion offer obstacles to conception chiefly in\r\ncases in which this displacement is a congenital anomaly, or when it has\r\ndeveloped immediately after puberty; or when complications exist,\r\nespecially when the retroflexed uterus is fixed by exudation. In\r\nnulliparae, these deviations backwards will not rarely be found to be\r\nthe cause of the sterility. Much less often does sterility ensue when\r\nretroversion or retroflexion occurs in women who have already given\r\nbirth to several children, i. e., when the displacement is a puerperal\r\ndisorder; the reason why such cases are not often sterile, is to be\r\nfound in the fact that the wide cervical canal favours the passage of\r\nthe spermatozoa, and the softness of the tissues prevents any serious\r\nobstacle to their upward progress being offered at the angle of flexion;\r\non the other hand, severe retroflexion in a woman who has not yet borne\r\na child offers a serious hindrance to conception, on account of the\r\nsmallness of the cervical canal, and the sharp flexion of the more rigid\r\nuterus.\r\n\r\nIn general, then, retroflexion can be regarded as offering but a slight\r\nhindrance to conception. In fact, many women with retroflexion become\r\npregnant again and again, and may abort several times in a single year.\r\nWhen in parous women suffering from retroflexion, sterility ultimately\r\noccurs, _B. Schultze_ considers that it is not the retroflexion which is\r\nprimarily to blame, but rather the secondary consequences so common in\r\nthis disorder: uterine catarrh; the general constitutional debility due\r\nto such catarrh, and to the accompanying menorrhagia; perimetritis, and\r\noophoritis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 81.—Retroflexio Uteri. After A. Martin.\r\n]\r\n\r\nRetroflexion and retroversion of the uterus occur chiefly in women who\r\nhave previously given birth to children; the bend is commonly obtuse or\r\nright-angled, and above the upper end of the cervical canal; sterility\r\nin such cases, usually acquired, has a favourable prospect of cure. As\r\n_Kehrer_ points out, sterility appears to be constant only in cases of\r\nretroflexion in which the uterus is fixed; the reason probably is that\r\nby the backward inflexion of the uterus the abdominal orifice of the\r\nFallopian tube is dragged away from the ovary, and thus the ovum, when\r\nit is discharged from the follicle, fails to find its way into the tube.\r\n\r\nAmong 57 cases of retroflexion of the gravid uterus, _E. Martin_ found\r\nthat in 6 the patient was pregnant for the first time, from which it may\r\nbe inferred that the anomaly existed prior to the occurrence of\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nThat in some cases of sterility it is the retroflexion of the uterus\r\nthat is to blame, is shown very clearly _ex juvantibus_, inasmuch as\r\nreposition of the uterus and maintenance of the organ in its proper\r\nposition relieves sterility perhaps of long standing, together with all\r\nthe other troubles secondary to the displacement of the uterus. As an\r\nexample, I quote one case from among several of the kind of which I have\r\nnotes. Mrs. N., 25 years of age, married 6 years, childless, suffers\r\nfrom severe dyspeptic troubles, leading to emaciation and profound\r\ndepression. She has been treated fruitlessly for gastric catarrh, but\r\nhas not previously been subjected to gynecological examination. I\r\ninsisted on making such an examination, and found the uterus somewhat\r\nenlarged and completely retroflexed. The successful replacement of the\r\norgan was followed by the cessation of the previously constant vomiting\r\nafter meals, and by the disappearance of the other dyspeptic troubles;\r\nshortly afterwards the lady became pregnant, and pregnancy ran a normal\r\ncourse. Since then, she has had three children; there has been no\r\nrecurrence of the dyspepsia.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Sims_, retroversion of the uterus is frequently associated\r\nwith sterility. Among 250 married women who had never been pregnant, we\r\nfound no less than 68 cases of retroversion; among 255 women who had had\r\none or more children, but had then ceased to be fruitful, he found 111\r\ncases of retroversion; and in some of these cases the retroversion was\r\nuncomplicated. _Grenser_ and _Vedeler_ also found retroflexion to be a\r\ncommon cause of sterility; the last-named, examining 7 nulliparous\r\nmarried women, found retroversion in 5; in these cases, however, there\r\nwas associated disease of the uterus or of its environment.\r\n\r\nInversion of the uterus, even in the minor degrees of the affection, in\r\nwhich coitus is still possible, almost invariably causes sterility,\r\nowing to the occlusion of the uterine orifices of the Fallopian tubes.\r\nMoreover, in inversion of the uterus, the position assumed by the os\r\nuteri externum is such as to render the entrance of the semen almost\r\nimpossible. Finally, when the uterus is inverted, the mucous membrane\r\nundergoes changes which render it unfit for the implantation of the\r\novum; the researches of _P. Ruge_ show that it is thinned and that the\r\nepithelium is cast off and replaced by granulation tissue. In cases in\r\nwhich the inverted uterus has long projected through the genital\r\nfissure, its surface becomes covered by a multilaminar pavement\r\nepithelium; at the same time, the glandular apparatus undergoes atrophy,\r\nonly the fundi of the glands being preserved, and the muscular substance\r\nis hypertrophied. None the less, in exceptional cases, which have been\r\nreported by _Emmet_, _Macdonald_, and _Tyler-Smith_, pregnancy has\r\noccurred after long-enduring inversion of the uterus. _Lauenstein_ had a\r\npatient in whom an inverted uterus was replaced after a year and a half;\r\nthe following week she became pregnant. _Stevens_ saw a case in which\r\nthe woman became pregnant six months after the reduction of an inversion\r\nof the uterus of nine months’ standing.\r\n\r\nProlapse of the uterus is seldom the cause of sterility, inasmuch as\r\nduring coitus replacement of the organ is effected. It may even be said\r\nthat in cases of prolapse, the low position of the uterus and the\r\nenlargement of the os uteri externum, favour the direct ejaculation of\r\nthe semen into the cervical canal (likewise enlarged), and that thus the\r\nconditions are advantageous for impregnation. In fact, conception more\r\ncommonly occurs in cases of prolapse than might have been anticipated in\r\nview of the various consecutive disorders apt to complicate this\r\naffection—chronic metritis and endometritis, erosion, hypertrophy of the\r\ncervix, displacement and laceration of the annexa, etc. The extent to\r\nwhich the capacity for conception is unfavourably affected in cases of\r\nprolapse of the uterus, is proportional to the amount of descent\r\nundergone by the uterus, for the nearer the os approximates to the\r\nvaginal orifice, the farther removed from the os will be the point at\r\nwhich the semen is ejaculated. In cases of complete prolapsus it has\r\nhappened that coitus has been effected directly through the everted os\r\nuteri, and has resulted in conception; a case of this kind is reported\r\nby Hervey.\r\n\r\nUnbiassed gynecological experience in no way supports the views of\r\n_Sims_ and _Hewitt_ regarding the frequency with which displacements of\r\nthe uterus constitute mechanical causes of sterility. _Sims_ supports\r\nhis views with the figures previously quoted, from which the following\r\ntable is compiled:\r\n\r\n                _No. of                                    _Total cases\r\n                cases._    _Anteversion._ _Retroversion._       of\r\n                                                          displacement._\r\n First class           250            103              68            171\r\n Second class          255             61             111            172\r\n                       ———            ———             ———            ———\r\n    Totals             505            164             179            343\r\n                       ===            ===             ===            ===\r\n\r\nFrom this it appears that in the 1st class, among 250 married women who\r\nhad never given birth to a child, there were 103 cases of anteversion,\r\nand 68 cases of retroversion; whilst in the 2nd class, among 255 women,\r\nwho had had children, but for one reason or another had become\r\nunfruitful earlier than the natural age for this occurrence, there were\r\n61 cases of anteversion, and 111 cases of retroversion.\r\n\r\nThe general result of these figures is to show that two-thirds of all\r\nsterile women, without regard to the especial cause of the displacement,\r\nsuffer from one form or the other of uterine displacement, and that the\r\nrelative frequency of anteversions and retroversions is reversed in the\r\ntwo classes, the nulliparous married women, and the married women\r\nprevious parous but latterly become sterile, respectively.\r\n\r\n_Hewitt_ similarly regards malpositions of the uterus as frequent causes\r\nof sterility. He analysed 296 cases of flexion and version of the uterus\r\ntreated by him at University College Hospital during the years 1865 to\r\n1869, partly in the wards, and partly in the out-patient department. Of\r\nthese 296 women, 235 were married; 100 were cases of retroflexion, and\r\n135 were cases of anteflexion. Of the 235, 81 had had no full-term\r\nchildren, 57 of the 81 having never been pregnant, and the remaining 24\r\nhaving had miscarriages only. Of the remaining 154, married and parous\r\nwomen, a large proportion were sterile at the time when they applied for\r\ntreatment; though in the years immediately after marriage they had given\r\nbirth to one or more children, they had subsequently ceased to be\r\nfruitful.\r\n\r\nAll that these figures prove to an unbiassed judgment is, however, that\r\ndisplacements of the uterus are apt to render conception difficult; or\r\nthat, in addition to other pathological states of the pelvic organs,\r\nthey are frequently met with in sterile women—but in and by themselves,\r\ndisplacements of the uterus do not offer any very serious or very\r\nfrequently occurring obstacle to conception.\r\n\r\nThat conception is possible in spite of the very notable mechanical\r\nhindrances which certain displacements of the uterus may offer to the\r\noccurrence of pregnancy, is shown by many striking examples in\r\ngynecological literature. _Winckel_, _Olshausen_, and _Holst_ have all\r\nseen pregnancy occur in women who at the time of conception were wearing\r\nintra-uterine pessaries; and _von Scanzoni_ has published cases in which\r\nfertilization took place, notwithstanding extreme anteversion which\r\nstenosis of the os uteri, and in another instance, notwithstanding the\r\npresence of a polypus filling the external os.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Myoma of the Uterus._\r\n\r\nAmong the mechanical obstacles to conception which act by preventing or\r\nrendering difficult the contact of spermatozoon and ovum, must be\r\nenumerated uterine myomata, and these must therefore be included among\r\nthe causes of sterility.\r\n\r\nAccording to their number, their size and their situation, uterine\r\nmyomata give rise to different and manifold mechanical disturbances.\r\nWhen there are numerous intramural myomata, even when these are of a\r\nmoderate size, the uterine cavity becomes bent and narrowed, and\r\nretention of the secretions may ensue, often lasting for a lengthy\r\nperiod. Submucous fibromyomata, when situated low down, near the\r\ninternal os, may occlude this orifice completely; when implanted higher\r\nup in the uterine cavity, they are apt to cause flexion of the uterus;\r\nlarge, pedunculated fibromyomata of the uterus may descend into the\r\nvagina and narrow this passage.\r\n\r\nMyomata interfere with conception in very various ways. Mechanically,\r\nthey may occlude the uterine orifices of the Fallopian tubes, or may\r\ngive rise to displacement of either tubes or ovaries, or, again, by\r\nblocking the uterine cavity, they may hinder the descent of the ovum and\r\nthe upward passage of the spermatozoa; their presence may cause\r\ncatarrhal disease of the uterine mucous membrane, or give rise to\r\nprofuse hemorrhage, and either of these secondary changes may interfere\r\nwith the implantation of the ovum; and there is yet another way in which\r\nmyomata may interfere with conception, and give rise to sterility—this\r\nis a subject to which especial attention has been given by _Winckel_,\r\nand to which we may here most conveniently allude. The continued growth\r\nof small submucous myomata often gives rise to a hyperæsthetic state of\r\nthe genital organs analogous to vaginismus, and this interferes with\r\ncoitus. Large myomata, on the other hand, give rise to catarrhal states\r\nof the uterine cavity and to hyperplasia of the mucous membrane,\r\nconstituting hindrances alike to conception, and to the implantation and\r\nfurther development of the embryo if fertilization should be effected;\r\nmoreover, the growth of large myomata often causes perimetritis,\r\nperisalpingitis, and perioophoritis, and these, partly by abnormal\r\nfixation of the uterus, and partly by closing up the tubes and so\r\nthickening the tunics of the ovary as to prevent the rupture of the\r\ngraafian follicles, give rise to sterility.\r\n\r\nThe existing statistics regarding the relation of the growth of myomata\r\nof the uterus to fertility, incomplete as they are and lacking in\r\nexactitude, suffice nevertheless to show that the fruitfulness of women\r\nsuffering from uterine myomata is notably diminished by the growth of\r\nthese tumours; more particularly, we learn that whilst the number of\r\nwomen with uterine myomata who have one child is sufficiently large, the\r\nnumber of multiparae thus affected falls greatly below the average of\r\nfertility. A characteristic feature of the influence of myomata in\r\nproducing sterility is clearly shown by the statistics, inasmuch as\r\npregnancy is comparatively common in the case of women with subserous\r\nmyomata, in whom the uterine cavity and mucous membrane are as a rule\r\nleast affected, whilst fertility is far more seriously impaired in the\r\ncase of women with submucous myomata.\r\n\r\n_West_, in the case of 43 married women with myomata of the uterus,\r\nfound 7 childless; the remaining 36 had in all given birth to only 61\r\nchildren, and 20 of these had only one child each. Of _Beigel’s_\r\npatients, 86 married women with uterine myomata, 21 were sterile; of\r\n_McClintock’s_ 21 patients similarly situated, 10 were sterile. _Von\r\nScanzoni’s_ investigation showed 38 sterile women among 60 married women\r\nsuffering from myoma uteri; _Michel_, 26 sterile among 127; _Winckel_,\r\n134 sterile among 415. From a table showing the number of children born\r\nto each of 108 women with myoma uteri of whom 46 were observed by\r\n_Winckel_, and 62 were in _Süsserott’s_ collection, it appears that on\r\nan average 2.7 children were born to each woman thus affected, whereas\r\nin Saxony the average number of children born to each married woman is\r\n4.5.\r\n\r\nMany other gynecologists have published statistics regarding this\r\nmatter, _Gusserow_, _Röhrig_, _Schröder_, _E. von Flamerdinghe_, and\r\nothers, some of them dealing with a very large number of cases, and all\r\nshow that 30% and upwards of married women with uterine myomata remain\r\nsterile.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, _Hofmeier_ maintains, in opposition to the prevailing\r\nview, that in the great majority of cases myomata are not to be regarded\r\nas giving rise to sterility. His investigation embraced 313 persons, of\r\nwhom 25% were unmarried, and 75% married, and of these latter, 25 to 30%\r\nwere sterile. (It must be pointed out that compared with the average\r\npercentage of sterile marriages—about 10%, this figure of 25 to 30% is a\r\nvery high one.) From a comparison of the age of the sterile married\r\nwoman with the duration of married life in each case, _Hofmeier_ is led\r\nto believe that it is not the myomata which have exercised an influence\r\nunfavourable to fertility, and that the occurrence of sterility in these\r\ncases is referable to other causes. The origination of myomata he\r\nregards as etiologically independent of the exercise or non-exercise of\r\nthe sexual act. The apparently overwhelming preponderance of the\r\noccurrence of myomata in unmarried and in sterile married women is, he\r\nthinks, to be explained by the fact that unmarried women and nulliparous\r\nmarried women seldom have occasion to consult a gynecologist, but that\r\nthe one condition that renders it necessary for them to do so is the\r\ngrowth of a uterine myoma. Generally speaking, pregnancy seldom occurs\r\nafter the age of 35 years, precisely the age at which the growth of\r\nuterine myomata begins to be common. If, however, at this comparatively\r\nlate age pregnancy does occur, it is so often found to be complicated by\r\nthe presence of a uterine myoma, that _Hofmeier_ is even led to infer\r\nthat the presence of such a tumour must have a certain favouring\r\ninfluence upon the occurrence of conception; the facilitation of\r\nconception in these cases he explains by the fact that the growth of the\r\ntumour renders the blood-supply of the whole reproductive apparatus more\r\nactive than is normally the case, and protracts the duration of ovarian\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Diseases of the Vagina and the Vulva._\r\n\r\nVarious pathological states of the vagina and vulva may cause incapacity\r\nfor fertilization by rendering copulation impossible. Such states may be\r\neither congenital or acquired.\r\n\r\nIn rare cases the hindrance consists in abnormal smallness of the vulva,\r\nbut this condition is usually associated with other defects in\r\ndevelopment of the reproductive organs, which combine to give rise to\r\nsterility. Congenital adhesion of the labia minora and majora is\r\nsometimes met with, with or without atresia of the urethral orifice, the\r\nconnexion between the labia may be superficial and epithelial merely, as\r\nin a case recorded by _Ziemssen_; or the labia may be firmly united\r\nthroughout their whole thickness. Much less common is acquired adhesion\r\nof the labia, causing atresia vulvae, and rendering coitus difficult or\r\nentirely impossible. Various other abnormalities of the reproductive\r\norgans which may give rise to sterility have already been described in\r\nthe section on the pathology of cohabitation, these are: abnormalities\r\nof the hymen; anomalous formation and hypertrophy of the labia;\r\nexcessive size of the clitoris; anomalies of the vagina, its absence,\r\nstenosis, atresia, duplication, and abnormal termination.\r\n\r\nMore detailed mention must, however, be made here of vesico-vaginal\r\nfistula as leading to sterility. Such a fistula is rightly regarded as\r\none of the conditions preventing conception, but it does not render the\r\noccurrence of pregnancy absolutely impossible. It will readily be\r\nunderstood that the unpleasant symptoms commonly met with in these\r\ncases, will be apt to deprive both husband and wife of inclination\r\ntoward sexual intercourse; again, apart from this psychical influence,\r\nthe functions of the female reproductive apparatus are commonly\r\ndisturbed to a very serious degree by the existence of a vesico-vaginal\r\nfistula; and, finally, the unfavourable influence of the urine on the\r\nsemen must also be taken into consideration, for, as an acid fluid, the\r\nurine will notably check the activity of the movements of the\r\nspermatozoa—still, notwithstanding all these unfavourable influences,\r\nconception will sometimes nevertheless occur in such cases. But of those\r\nwho acquire a vesico-vaginal fistula as the result of a difficult\r\nlabour, a very small proportion only will again become pregnant.\r\n\r\n_Freund_ draws attention to _Simon’s_ experiences, reminding us that the\r\nlatter, in his cases in which women with vesico-vaginal fistula become\r\npregnant, invariably saw the pregnancy terminate in abortion or\r\npremature labour; but still, _Freund_ quotes also a case of _Schmitt’s_,\r\nand mentions another of his own, showing that this premature termination\r\nof the pregnancy is not absolutely inevitable in such circumstances.\r\n_Schröder_, indeed, goes far in the opposite direction, and writes:\r\n“Such women not rarely become pregnant, and their pregnancy usually runs\r\na normal course.” _Kroner_ made a statistical investigation of the\r\nquestion, and found that of 60 women suffering from vesico-vaginal\r\nfistula, 6 became pregnant during the persistence of the fistula.\r\n_Winckel_ reports a remarkable case in which, after the ordinary means\r\nof curing the fistula had been vainly tried, transverse obliteration of\r\nthe vagina was undertaken; the operation was not completely successful,\r\nas a small passage remained patent; the patient returned home for a\r\ntime, and became pregnant, the spermatozoa having found their way\r\nthrough this passage. _Simon_ reports another noteworthy case, that of a\r\nwoman 57 years of age, with a vesico-vaginal fistula close to the\r\nexternal os; during the 26 years the fistula had lasted she had\r\ncomplained of cessatio mensium; when the fistula was closed by\r\noperation, she again began to menstruate.\r\n\r\nSometimes we meet with abnormalities of the vagina—not strictly speaking\r\nmorbid states—which, though they may not at first sight appear to be of\r\nmuch significance, yet suffice to render conception difficult, or even\r\nimpossible. One of these conditions is extreme shortness of the vagina,\r\nleading to the formation of a “poche copulatrice” (Courty), in which\r\nduring coitus the semen is ejaculated at a distance from the os uteri\r\nexternum; another is excessive length and width of the vagina; another,\r\nsome displacement of the vagina which diminishes the prospect that the\r\nsemen will enter the cervical canal. Such vaginal false passages,\r\n“fausses routes vaginales,” have been described more especially by\r\n_Pajot_ as causes of sterility.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of sterility is the rapid outflow of the semen after\r\ncoitus, either in consequence of dyspareunia, or on account of some\r\nabnormality in the configuration of the vagina, or, finally, owing to\r\ndeficient action of the constrictor cunni (or bulbocavernosus muscle)\r\nand the muscles of the pelvic diaphragm. In cases of profluvium seminis,\r\nthe woman herself will often call the physician’s attention to the\r\ndefect.\r\n\r\nMany cases of sterility depend upon a cause the recognition of which in\r\nthis connexion is comparatively recent, namely, the hermaphroditism of\r\nthe person concerned. Witness the following case described by _Dohrn_:\r\nThe individual had been baptised and brought up as a girl. At the age of\r\ntwenty years she began to suffer from a distressing sensation of\r\npressure, recurring at intervals of four weeks. A local examination was\r\nmade by a physician, who assured the mother that “there was no hindrance\r\nto menstruation, but that when she married an incision would become\r\nnecessary.” After a time she became engaged and was married; and shortly\r\nafterwards her husband demanded a renewed gynecological examination.\r\nThis was undertaken by _Dohrn_, who declared that the supposed girl was\r\nof the male sex. The external reproductive organs had the feminine form.\r\nThe labia majora were large and well-formed; in the anterior extremity\r\nof each labium was a rounded, sensitive, soft body, of the size of a\r\nlarge bean, which was capable of being drawn forwards towards the\r\nabdomen; the labia were beset with muscular fibres; the clitoris was 4\r\ncm. (1.6 in.) in length, resembling an imperforate infantile penis, it\r\nwas slightly erectile; in the vestibule there were two openings, the\r\nanterior of which was the urethra, the posterior led into a blind\r\npassage 2 cm. (0.8 in.) in length, representing the fused lower\r\nextremities of the ducts of _Müller_; per rectum no trace could be found\r\nof vagina, uterus, or ovaries, but also no trace of prostate. The\r\nmarriage, in which this individual declared himself to be happy, was\r\nannulled. _Leopold_ observed a similar case, in which the individual had\r\nlived as a wife for the space of 25 years. Another striking case is\r\nrecorded by _Steglehner_. As _Zweifel_ remarks, to decide the true sex\r\nof such individuals is often extremely difficult. “At the present day,\r\nindeed,” he continues, “it is no longer the fate of those who from no\r\nfault of their own have had imposed on them the name and upbringing of\r\nanother sex than that which is truly theirs, and who have thus been led\r\nto contract marriage with one who in reality is of their own sex, to be\r\ntreated with the horrible injustice which was meted out to them in the\r\nmiddle ages, when, as we learn from contemporary writers, they were\r\nhaled before the bar of “ecclesiastical justice,” charged with profaning\r\nthe sacrament of marriage, and threatened with death at the stake—but\r\neven now a mistake in the decision of an infant’s sex entails in later\r\nlife a thousand distresses and inconveniences.”\r\n\r\nRecently, _Neugebauer_ has made as complete a collection as possible of\r\nall the recorded cases of hermaphroditism.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Secretions of the Genital Organs._\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the secretion of the vaginal mucous membrane, or of\r\nthe secretion formed in the cervical canal, or both of these in\r\ncombination, may constitute hindrances to the normal contact of\r\nspermatozoon and ovum.\r\n\r\nThe secretions of the female genital organs are manifold. The outer\r\nsurface of the labia majora is covered with skin, containing sebaceous\r\nand sweat glands; but the inner surface of the labia majora and the rest\r\nof the external genital organs are covered with mucous membrane, the\r\nouter stratum of which consists of stratified pavement epithelium; this\r\nepithelium contains sebaceous glands and mucus glands. The intermixture\r\nof the secretions of these glands with the epithelial scales which are\r\nconstantly being cast off in large numbers, constitutes the whitish\r\nmaterial with which this region is smeared, known as “smegma.” A mucus\r\nsecretion of a fluid consistency is discharged from the vulvo-vaginal\r\nglands known by the name of Bartholin’s glands.\r\n\r\nThe mucous lining of the vagina is poor in glands; it contains very\r\nnumerous papillæ, which do not, however, project from the surface of the\r\nmembrane, since the depressions between the papillæ are filled in by the\r\nstratified epithelium with which the entire extent of the vaginal mucous\r\nmembrane is covered. The secretion of the vaginal mucous membrane is a\r\nfluid of thin consistency with an acid reaction; the admixture of\r\nnumerous morphological elements, in the form of epithelial cells cast\r\noff from the superficial layers of the stratified epithelium, often,\r\nhowever, makes the vaginal secretion thick and opaque. The epithelial\r\nlamellae are frequently covered with heaps of lepthothrix granules, and\r\namong the granules are seen vibriones and bacteria and also numerous\r\nlepthothrix threads of varying length.\r\n\r\nThe same stratified epithelium extends on to the neck of the uterus to a\r\ndistance which varies in different individuals; gradually, however, the\r\nnumber of layers diminishes, the flattened cells give place to thicker,\r\nprismatic cells, until we have a single-layered prismatic epithelium;\r\nfinally the cells become columnar and ciliated, and this columnar\r\nciliated epithelium covers the whole of the interior of the uterus. The\r\nmucous lining of the cervical canal contains numerous mucous glands,\r\nsome of which are simple tubular glands, whilst others are racemose;\r\nthey are lined with columnar ciliated epithelium, and secrete a dense,\r\ngelatinous, alkaline mucus, containing a few epithelial cells and\r\noccasional leucocytes. The mucous membrane of the uterine cavity is\r\nbeset with simple tubular glands, lined with a single layer of prismatic\r\nepithelium; these glands secrete a grayish alkaline fluid. The secretion\r\nformed in the uterine cavity is thinner in consistency than that formed\r\nin the cervical canal.\r\n\r\nNormally, the secretion of the vaginal mucous membrane is not more than\r\nis sufficient to keep the surface of the canal moist and slippery; it is\r\na thin fluid of an acid reaction, and almost as clear as water. Shortly\r\nbefore and after menstruation, the secretion of the vaginal mucous\r\nmembrane becomes more abundant; it is even thinner than at other times;\r\nthe reaction remains acid. The secretion of the cervical canal is\r\nnormally, in the absence of sexual intercourse, small in amount, so that\r\na free flow of secretion from the os uteri externum is by itself\r\nsufficient to indicate that the mucous membrane of the canal is in an\r\nabnormal condition. The vitreous, gelatinous, alkaline mucus secreted by\r\nthe glands of the cervical canal is normally retained within the canal,\r\nand is seen on examination with the speculum to fill the os uteri\r\nexternum. In consequence of the congestion of the uterus that occurs\r\nduring menstruation, and for the same reason during sexual excitement,\r\nthe secretion of the cervical canal is more abundant, it also becomes\r\nless tenacious, and flows out through the os into the vagina. But this\r\nevacuation of the cervical secretion through the os is a normal\r\noccurrence only during menstruation and as a result of sexual\r\nintercourse; in these circumstances it appears in the form of a clear or\r\nsomewhat yellowish drop of fluid exuding through the os uteri externum.\r\n\r\nIn catarrhal states, the secretions of the genital passage, like those\r\nof other mucous membranes, become abnormal. There is an increase in the\r\nnumber both of epithelial elements and of leucocytes; and in very acute\r\ncatarrhs, erythrocytes also mingle with the secretion. On microscopical\r\nexamination we find that the catarrhal secretion differs in its\r\ncharacters according to the part from which it is derived: the mucus\r\nfrom the cervical canal forms gelatinous accumulations; that from the\r\nvaginal mucous membrane forms thick opaque masses; and in the mixed\r\nsecretion which exudes from the vulva, we find also smegma from the\r\nexternal genital organs. In addition to cells from the laminated\r\nepithelium, we see often young cells, somewhat oval or polyhedral in\r\nform, with granular protoplasm, and a vesicular nucleus. In some\r\ninflammatory states, pus corpuscles will also make their appearance.\r\nVarious micro-organisms are in addition to be found in the catarrhal\r\nsecretions.\r\n\r\nThe reaction of the vaginal secretion is normally faintly acid; should\r\nit become strongly acid, the movements of the spermatozoa are\r\nimmediately suspended. The mucus of the cervical canal, the alkaline\r\nreaction of which is extremely favourable to the onward movement of the\r\nspermatozoa, may, owing to catarrhal processes, be so altered that it\r\nbecomes acid; it then destroys the spermatozoa, and gives rise to\r\nsterility. This fact can sometimes be proved by microscopical\r\nexamination. In several cases in which endometritis existed in sterile\r\nwomen I made a microscopical examination of the cervical mucus shortly\r\nafter the completion of sexual intercourse; and in a number of these, no\r\nliving spermatozoa were to be seen, but only dead, motionless\r\nspermatozoa (Fig. 82). I had, of course, in these cases, previously\r\nassured myself that the husband’s semen was normally active.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 82.\r\n\r\n  Mucus from the Cervical Canal, taken one hour after sexual\r\n    intercourse, from a woman suffering from chronic endometritis.\r\n\r\n  Among the epithelial cells, pus cells, and finely granular masses, we\r\n    see a few motionless, dead spermatozoa.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAccording to _Nöggerath_, in cases of uterine catarrh, we may find one\r\nof three different varieties of secretion. In some cases it is small in\r\namount, and very thin in consistency; in others, it is moderate in\r\namount, very thick, non-transparent, bright yellow, and gelatinous in\r\nconsistency; in the third class of cases, we have numerous degrees of\r\nvariation, starting from the normal, purely mucus, transparent\r\nsecretion, mixed with yellow flocculae, up to a secretion which has\r\nalmost the aspect of pure pus. The first described variety is, according\r\nto _Nöggerath_, met with chiefly in women whose uteri are small, with\r\nindurated tissues, and its discharge seems to depend upon commencing\r\natrophy of the mucous membrane. The second form is the most obstinate,\r\nthe catarrh being situated chiefly in the cervical and probably also the\r\nuterine glands; whereas the first variety of secretion is rather a\r\nserous transudation, and contains very few formed elements. The third\r\nform is characterized by extensive denudation of the superficial\r\nepithelium, and is mixed with a smaller or larger quantity of pus.\r\n\r\n_Levy_, who made microscopical examinations in sterile women (39 cases),\r\ngives it as a “constant fact” that when the cervical secretion contains\r\nepithelial and pus cells in large quantities, the spermatozoa never\r\nretain for long their power of movement. Whereas in examinations made\r\nrepeatedly on healthy women 25 hours after sexual intercourse, he found\r\nnumerous spermatozoa still in active movement, in women having a\r\ncatarrhal discharge with the characters just mentioned, five hours after\r\nintercourse the movements of the spermatozoa had almost entirely ceased.\r\n\r\nNot only may the secretions of the genital passage be injurious to the\r\nspermatozoa by their quality, but further a very abundant secretion may\r\ninterfere with fertilization. In the first place a very abundant\r\nsecretion is apt to be very dilute, and if the spermatozoa are immersed\r\nin a fluid of which the specific gravity is too low, they swell up from\r\nimbibition of water, and their movements are suspended. But excessive\r\nsecretion, such as is sometimes met with in cases of cervical catarrh,\r\nmay also have a purely mechanical deleterious action, by washing away\r\nthe semen out of the vagina. If, again, the quantity of the ejaculated\r\nsemen is unusually small, contact with the normally acid vaginal mucus\r\nmay suffice to render the spermatozoa speedily motionless. Finally, when\r\nthe cervical secretion is of a too tenacious consistency, so that it\r\nfills the os as with a plug, the upward passage of the spermatozoa may\r\nbe barred.\r\n\r\nSuch tenacious cervical mucus will give rise to sterility especially in\r\nwomen who have not previously born children; whereas in parous women,\r\nowing to the more patulous condition of the os, the entrance of the\r\nspermatozoa is not so effectually prevented. The same distinction\r\nbetween nulliparous and parous women must be made, as _von Scanzoni_ has\r\npointed out, also as regards the production of sterility by\r\nhypersecretion of uterine mucus. Women who become affected with uterine\r\nblenorrhoea only after having had one or more children, will readily\r\nbecome pregnant again; but when such blenorrhoea affects a woman who has\r\nnever been pregnant, sterility almost invariably results.\r\n\r\n_Von Grünewaldt_ has drawn attention to a somewhat rare form of chronic\r\nendometritis with tenacious secretion, leading to sterility. The shape,\r\nsize, and consistency of the uterus appear normal, the organ is often\r\nvirginal, but with the speculum we see exuding from the os a greyish\r\ngreen, extremely tenacious secretion, which is wiped away with\r\ndifficulty. He saw 24 women affected with this disease; 10 of these had\r\nlived in marital intercourse for many years without ever having become\r\npregnant; in 10 others there was acquired sterility, i. e., they had at\r\nfirst borne children after marriage, but had subsequently ceased to be\r\nfruitful; in the remaining 4 it was not possible to ascertain whether\r\nthey were fruitful or sterile, since two of them were living apart from\r\ntheir husbands, whilst in the case of the other two only two years had\r\nelapsed since the birth of the last child. In any case, not one of the\r\nwomen thus affected had ever become pregnant subsequent to the time at\r\nwhich she acquired this form of endometritis, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat in several of the cases the symptoms were alleviated by treatment.\r\n\r\nWe must here consider also the effect of gonorrhoeal infection in giving\r\nrise to sterility in women. Sterility may arise from gonorrhoea in women\r\nin various ways. Sometimes the abundance of the cervical secretion is\r\nalone sufficient to prevent the entrance of the spermatozoa into the\r\nuterus; in other cases the hindrance to fertility depends upon the\r\ninflammatory conditions in the pelvis that so frequently result from\r\ngonorrhoeal infection—perimetritis and parametritis; it may be catarrhal\r\nchanges in the tubes—salpingitis, hydrosalpinx, and pyosalpinx—by which\r\nthe contact between spermatozoon and ovum is prevented. Chronic\r\ngonorrhoeal endometritis may give rise to such changes in the uterine\r\nmucous membrane as to unfit it permanently for the implantation of the\r\novum, even should there be no obstacle to fertilization. Finally, double\r\ngonorrhoeal oophoritis may result in rendering the formation of mature\r\novum an entire impossibility—bringing about a condition analogous to\r\nazoospermia in the male, and causing absolute sterility. Although in\r\nmany cases the detection of the gonococcus affords indisputable evidence\r\nof the existence of gonorrhoeal infection, it must be remembered that it\r\nis often difficult, and sometimes entirely impossible, to make the\r\ndiagnosis with certainty; and for this reason it is possible that\r\ngonorrhoeal infection plays a much larger part in the causation of\r\nsterility than has until lately been believed.\r\n\r\nThe observant physician will in cases of sterile marriage frequently\r\nfind in husband or wife or both, evidence of previous or still existent\r\ngonorrhoea; but he will cautiously weigh all the circumstances before\r\ndeciding that such gonorrhoeal infection is the efficient cause of the\r\nsterility. In many cases, however, the etiological relation is too\r\nobvious to be overlooked, and we can trace all the distresses of the\r\nunfortunate wife to the injury she unwittingly received upon the\r\nmomentous wedding night.\r\n\r\nStill, we have to remember how extraordinarily common, more especially\r\nin the so-called upper classes of society, is gonorrhoeal infection,\r\nand what an enormous percentage of men entering upon married life have\r\npreviously experienced one or more attacks of the disease—so that were\r\nsterility a frequent sequel of such infection, fertility would be the\r\nexception rather than the rule. By inquiry among friends and patients\r\nas to whether when they married they had previously suffered from\r\ngonorrhoea, in conjunction with information regarding the fruitfulness\r\nof their marriages, I have been led to the conclusion, which appears\r\nto me to be one of considerable importance, that the proportion of\r\nsterile to fruitful women among the wives of men who have suffered\r\nfrom gonorrhoea before marriage, is about the same as the proportional\r\nfertility of all marriages considered independently of gonorrhoeal\r\ninfection, viz. 1 : 10. This depends, as it appears to me, not only\r\nupon the fact that very frequently in men gonorrhoea is completely\r\ncured, but also upon the fact that in women gonorrhoeal infection does\r\nnot necessarily cause sterility. It may indeed be regarded as\r\ndefinitely established that women actually suffering from gonorrhoea\r\nmay become pregnant, and that the pregnancy may proceed to its natural\r\ntermination. The recent investigations regarding the frequency with\r\nwhich gonococci may be detected in the genital secretions of pregnant\r\nand parturient women—and they are to be found in a surprisingly large\r\npercentage—suffice to prove that gonorrhoeal infection offers no\r\ninsuperable obstacle to conception. That the discovery of gonococci in\r\na man’s urethra does not justify us with apodictic certainty in\r\nforbidding the man thus affected to marry is in fact proved by the\r\nfollowing remarkable case, which came within my own experience. A\r\nyoung man who had had several attacks of acute gonorrhoea, wishing to\r\nmarry, had himself examined by two specialists in genito-urinary\r\ndisease. Both detected gonococci in his urethra, and both forbade him\r\nto marry. The patient, however, would not be advised, and married the\r\nlady of his choice; now, six years after marriage, he is the happy\r\nfather of four blooming children, and his wife is in perfect health.\r\n\r\n_Gosselin_, in an elaborate work published in 1853, was the first to\r\npoint out the serious consequences as regards a man’s future potentia\r\ngenerandi which are entailed by an attack of gonorrhoea followed by\r\nepididymitis. He insisted that the inflammation might lead to the\r\nobliteration at some point of the vas deferens, whereby the secretion of\r\nthe testicle was prevented from mixing with the secretions of the\r\nprostate, Cowper’s gland, and the seminal vesicle; and hence the\r\nejaculated sperm was lacking in its principal constituent. In such\r\ncases, either in the epididymis (usually in the globus minor of that\r\norgan), or else in the course of the vas deferens, somewhere between the\r\nepididymis and the vesicula seminalis, some relic of the former\r\ninflammation is usually to be detected, the globus gonorrhoeicus, and\r\nthis usually represents the seat of strangulation of the excretory duct\r\nof the testicle.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1872 _Nöggerath_ published his book, written with flaming\r\nfiery zeal, entitled “Latent Gonorrhoea in the Female Sex.” In the most\r\nstartling colours he depicted all the misery and distress which formed\r\nthe wedding gift of the gonorrhoea-infected husband to his wife; when\r\nsowing his wild oats, such a husband is preparing for the crop by which\r\nhis young wife’s happiness is destroyed, her health ruined, her life\r\nendangered, and her hopes of offspring annulled. While we may admit that\r\n_Nöggerath’s_ motives were of the noblest, we cannot but wonder that the\r\nwickedness of the male sex has not yet entailed the destruction of the\r\nwhole human race, overwhelmed as by a new fall of Sodom and Gomorrah.\r\n\r\n_Nöggerath_ maintained that 90% of men infected with gonorrhoea remained\r\nuncured; and that of the women married by men thus permanently infected\r\nwith gonorrhoea, barely 10% remained free from the disease. It is\r\ngonorrhoeal infection, of which this author gives so gloomy a picture,\r\nwhich is, in his opinion, the principle cause of sterility in women.\r\nAccording to his observations, of 81 women thus infected, 49 remained\r\nabsolutely sterile; only 31 became pregnant; 23 were delivered at full\r\nterm, 3 had miscarriages, and 5 premature delivery. Thus, not so many as\r\n1 in 3 of these women had a full-time child. Of the 23 who were\r\ndelivered at full term, 12 never had more than 1 child each; 7 had 2\r\nchildren each; 3 had 3 children each; 1 only had 4 children, the normal\r\naverage fruit of healthy marriages. In all, the 81 women had only 39\r\nchildren. If we take 4 to be the average number of the offspring of a\r\nhealthy married pair, there was but one normal woman among the whole 81.\r\nForty-nine were absolutely sterile; 11 of the remainder had 1 child, and\r\ndid not again conceive during periods ranging from 3 to 18 years after\r\nthe recorded delivery; thus there were 60 sterile women among 81.\r\n\r\n_Nöggerath’s_ doctrine regarding the relation between gonorrhoeal\r\ninfection and sterility obtained at first little credence—perhaps for\r\nthe reason that he drew such far-reaching conclusions from so limited a\r\nmaterial—_Schröder_ mentions _Nöggerath’s_ opinions only to dismiss them\r\nas extravagant; but the idea that the husband was mainly to blame for\r\nthe occurrence of sterility in marriage continued to form the topic of\r\nscientific discussion. The indignation which _Nöggerath’s_ assertions,\r\nunquestionably too sweeping, had aroused in gynecological circles,\r\ngradually subsided, as every gynecologist devoted his attention to\r\nsupporting or refuting _Nöggerath’s_ conclusions.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident, that gonorrhoea in the male had a deleterious\r\ninfluence upon the fertilizing quality of the semen, and this far more\r\nfrequently than had previously been supposed. _Fürbringer_, as a result\r\nof the examination of 124 cases, laid down the important proposition,\r\nthat when epididymitis or funiculitis gonorrhoeica duplex had been\r\nobserved to occur, the probability that the patient would be an\r\nazoospermist was expressed by the ratio of 9 : 1, and this in direct\r\nopposition to the views of _Zeissl_, who had maintained that in this\r\nrespect the consequences of gonorrhoea were trifling.\r\n\r\n_Seeligmann_ conducted a pathologico-anatomical investigation which led\r\nhim to conclude that in cases of gonorrhoeal epididymitis, in addition\r\nto the inflammation of the epididymis, phlebitis and periphlebitis of\r\nthe plexus pampiniformis occurs, and also lymphangitis of the extensive\r\nsystem of lymphatic vessels which pass through the spermatic cord from\r\nthe testicle; the changes left in the blood and lymphatic vessels by the\r\ninflammation, result in the testicle being for the future imperfectly\r\nnourished, and often therefore lead to impairment of the functions of\r\nthis organ; thus the oligospermia so frequently seen as a sequel of\r\ngonorrhoeal epididymitis (the ejaculated semen containing but few\r\nspermatozoa, and these with little or no vitality), is not always due to\r\na complete obliteration of the vasa deferentia by the inflammation, but\r\nin many cases to the functional derangements of the testicle brought\r\nabout in the manner above described. It is probable also that lues may\r\ngive rise to azoospermia as a result of endarteritic processes. The\r\nremarkable result of _Seeligmann’s_ investigations was that in as many\r\nas 75% of the sterile marriages that came under his observation, the\r\nhusband was the one to blame.\r\n\r\nLatterly, the view that gonorrhoeal infection plays a very considerable\r\npart in the etiology of sterility in women, has been widely accepted.\r\nAmong German gynecologists, _Olshausen_, a man of enormous experience,\r\nconsiders that _Nöggerath’s_ book, notwithstanding much exaggeration, is\r\nsubstantially accurate in its main conclusions. A similar view of\r\n_Nöggerath’s_ work is taken by _E. Schwartz_, _Bandl_, _A. Martin_, and\r\n_Hofmeier_.\r\n\r\nAccording to the exhaustive work of _E. Schwartz_, gonorrhoea is in\r\nwomen one of the commonest causes of sterility. Sterility due to this\r\ndisease may be either primary or secondary. In some cases no ovum can\r\nfind its way into the uterus, either because the ovaries are completely\r\nenveloped in masses of exudation and pseudo-membranes, or on account of\r\ndislocation of the ovaries and the Fallopian tubes, or because the tubes\r\nhave been rendered impermeable by inflammatory stenosis or flexion, or\r\nby loss of their ciliated epithelium; in other cases the ovum, indeed,\r\nenters the uterus, but fails to be implanted upon the diseased mucous\r\nmembrane; again, it is conceivable that even when ovum and spermatozoon\r\nare properly formed and encounter one another in the normal manner in\r\nthe tube or in the uterine cavity, and when the uterine mucous membrane\r\nis in a condition suitable for the implantation of the fertilized ovum,\r\ncontact with gonorrhoeal secretions may have impaired the vitality of\r\nthe ovum or of the spermatozoon, or of both, to such a degree, that\r\neither fertilization fails to occur, or the fertilized ovum is incapable\r\nof further development. In some instances, sterility dates from the\r\nfirst infection of the wife; but more commonly it does not develop until\r\nafter the completion of one or more pregnancies.\r\n\r\n_Hofmeier_ rightly points out that whilst gonorrhoeal infection in women\r\nmay cause sterility, such sterility is by no means an inevitable\r\nconsequence of the disease.\r\n\r\nOther gynecologists are even more reserved in admitting the importance\r\nof gonorrhoea as a cause of sterility in women. _Fritsch_ is of opinion\r\nthat in many cases a casual relation is believed to exist, when in\r\nreality there is nothing more than a coincidence. Sterility and slight\r\nperimetritis, he remarks, are common in women; gonorrhoea is common in\r\nmen. But it does not follow that the frequent gonorrhoea of the husbands\r\nis the sole cause of the frequent sterility and perimetritis of the\r\nwives. “For several years,” he continues, “I have examined all the men I\r\npossibly could for evidence of the existence of gonorrhoea, and have\r\nenquired for a history of previous attacks of the disease. To my\r\nastonishment I discovered that the fathers of many children, whose wives\r\nhad come to consult me for some quite disconnected condition, had quite\r\nas often suffered formerly from gonorrhoea as the husbands of sterile\r\nwives.”\r\n\r\n_M. Saenger_ is one who very vigorously upholds _Nöggerath’s_ views. He\r\ninsists that, excluding _puellae publicae_ from consideration, no less\r\nthan 12% of all gynecological disorders depend upon pathological\r\nprocesses referable to gonorrhoeal infection of the female genital\r\norgans. To establish this thesis, it is not necessary to prove that\r\n_Neisser’s_ gonococcus is or has been present; the diagnosis must be\r\nbased principally upon clinical considerations. Chronic vaginitis and\r\nurethritis, inflammation of the uterine mucous membrane, tubal\r\nsuppuration, oophoritis, and perimetritic adhesions (especially those\r\nwhich unite all the lateral pelvic organs into a shapeless knot)—these\r\nare conditions thoroughly characteristic of gonorrhoea.\r\n\r\nNo less unfavourable an influence of gonorrhoeal infection upon\r\nfertility is shown by the observations of _Glünder_. Women numbering 87\r\nwere in attendance at the gynecological department of the _Policlinik_\r\nof the University of Berlin, all of them seeking advice on account of\r\nsterility. In the case of 24 of these, the husband was also present; 19\r\nof these men admitted having previously suffered from gonorrhoea; the\r\nremaining 5 denied such infection, although the wives of all of these\r\nhad symptoms pointing unmistakably to gonorrhoeal infection; among the\r\nother 63 women, there were 8 only in whom the genital organs were found\r\nperfectly normal, whilst in 38 of them there were signs of previous\r\ngonorrhoeal infection. Thus we see that of these 87 sterile women, 62\r\n(71.3%) had had gonorrhoea; and _Glünder_, assuming that in these cases\r\nthe gonorrhoea was the efficient cause of the sterility, and regarding\r\nthe average percentage of sterile marriages as 12.34 in every 100\r\ncontracted, is led to the conclusion that of every eleven or twelve\r\nmarriages, one is rendered sterile in consequence of gonorrhoea.\r\n\r\nTo the same opinion, that gonorrhoea is the principal cause of\r\nsterility, _Lier_ and _Ascher_ were led by an investigation of numerous\r\nclinical histories. Moreover, they believe that in the large majority of\r\nsterile marriages, the husband is directly or indirectly responsible.\r\nDirectly, in so far as a very large percentage of men have their\r\nreproductive capacity annihilated by gonorrhoea; indirectly, because, of\r\nthose who retain their fertilizing powers, so large a number infect\r\ntheir wives with gonorrhoea, and thus render them incapable of\r\nconceiving, that chronic gonorrhoea—in the female harder to eradicate\r\neven than in the male—must be regarded as the arch-enemy of fertility.\r\nOf 80 men affected with azoospermia, all cases observed by _Prochownik_,\r\nin 75 the disease was the sequel of gonorrhoea; of the remaining 5\r\ncases, two were due to syphilitic disease of the testicles, one to\r\ntubercular disease of the same, whilst two were due to long continued\r\nmasturbation, with consecutive atrophy of the testis and epididymis.\r\n\r\nBut that the obstacle offered to conception by gonorrhoeal infection is\r\nby no means so powerful as _Nöggerath_ and his supporters believed, is\r\nshown by the investigations of _Oppenheimer_, who, in _Kehrer’s_\r\nclinique at Heidelberg, examined 108 pregnant women for the presence of\r\ngonococci, and found these organisms, pathognomonic of gonorrhoeal\r\ninfection, in no less than 30 of them, that is, in 27.7%. Thus, in this\r\nlarge number of cases, pregnancy had occurred notwithstanding the\r\npresence of gonorrhoea. _Lower_, again, in _Schröeder’s_ clinique,\r\nexamined 32 patients during the lying-in period, and detected the\r\npresence of gonococci in 26; an experience which also proves that\r\ngonorrhoeal infection is no bar to pregnancy. _Dunstone_ has recently\r\nrecorded 5 cases in which, notwithstanding the existence of gonorrhoea,\r\nthe women became pregnant once or several times.\r\n\r\nIn the “Medical Brief” the question was mooted, “Can a woman have\r\nchildren subsequently to being infected with gonorrhoea?” Numerous\r\naffirmative answers were received; and among them one mentioning the\r\ncase of a woman who was infected with gonorrhoea at the age of 18, and\r\nsubsequently gave birth to 8 children.\r\n\r\nThe question of sterility in prostitutes has also attracted attention,\r\nsince these women may be regarded as invariably infected with\r\ngonorrhoea. _Meissner_ and _Jeannel_ speak of the infertility of\r\nprostitutes as a well-known fact; and the latter states that, whereas,\r\naccording to _Montesquieu_, to every 100 women in France, on an average\r\n341 children are born, of which 200 grow up, to 100 prostitutes in\r\nBordeaux there were born 60 children only, and of these but 21 attained\r\nmaturity. _Marc d’Espine_ affirms that among 2,000 prostitutes not more\r\nthan two or three will have children in a year. _Parent-Duchatelet_, on\r\nthe other hand, regards the sterility of these women as a purely\r\ntemporary affair, and writes: “les prostituées conçoivent souvent, mais\r\nelles avortent fréquement;”[49] and this frequency of abortion he\r\nattributes to two causes, in the first place to deliberate induction of\r\nabortion, and in the second place, to their mode of life. He continues:\r\n“cette fécondité a lieu surtout lorsque, quittant leur mettier, elles se\r\nmarient ou s’attachent à un seul homme; dans ce cas les grossesses se\r\nsuccèdent, elles sont toujours heureuses et les infants qui en\r\nproviennent sont aussi vivaces que les autres;”[50] thus, in his opinion\r\nthe sterility of prostitutes lasts only as long as they pursue their\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nThe question as to what influence, if any, gonorrhoeal secretion has\r\n_per se_ upon the semen, has often been asked, but not yet\r\nsatisfactorily answered. We have no certain knowledge whether the\r\ngonococci, the pus cells, or one of the toxins of the secretion,\r\nexercises a deleterious influence upon the vitality of the spermatozoa;\r\nit is certainly possible that this may be the case, for the diplococci,\r\njust as much as streptococci and staphylococci, are found not only\r\nwithin the cells, but also in the intercellular fluid and in the\r\ndetritus, and so must be brought into intimate contact with the\r\nspermatozoa; but inasmuch as quite a number of persons who are at the\r\ntime actually suffering from gonorrhoea beget children, we are compelled\r\nto assume that for the harmful influence, if any such exists, to be\r\nexercised, a prolonged contact of the semen with the gonorrhoeal pus is\r\nnecessary. In cases of gonorrhoeal epididymitis and prostatitis, and\r\nalso in gonorrhoeal urethritis, no such prolonged contact occurs; but\r\nwhen the vas deferens or the vesicula seminalis is inflamed, the contact\r\nis more prolonged, and may suffice to destroy the vitality of the\r\nspermatozoa, which are extremely sensitive to chemical stimuli. In 8\r\ncases observed by _Kroner_, the fruitful coitus was unquestionably\r\neffected when the husband was suffering from still active gonorrhoea; in\r\nall the cases the children were born at full term, and all suffered from\r\nconjunctival blenorrhoea. That gonorrhoea often fails to induce\r\nsterility, is shown by the familiar fact that a woman frequently has one\r\nchild after another, all infected with this conjunctival form of\r\ngonorrhoea, showing that the mother remains fertile notwithstanding the\r\npersistency of the gonorrhoeal infection.\r\n\r\nUpon the investigation of 60 carefully written clinical histories,\r\ndealing with the relation between proved gonorrhoeal infection and a\r\nsterile marriage, _Grechen_ has drawn up the following table, showing\r\nthe various ways in which chronic gonorrhoea may give rise to sterility:\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _A. Absolute Sterility._\r\n\r\na. Owing to impossibility of fertilization, in consequence of defective\r\nformation of spermatozoon or ovum:\r\n\r\n I. In the male:\r\n   1. Aspermatism.\r\n   2. Azoospermia.\r\n II. In the female:\r\n   Oophoritis glandularis.\r\n\r\nb. Owing to impossibility of pregnancy, although semen and ovum may be\r\nnormal, and fertilization can be effected:\r\n\r\nGonorrhoeal endometritis of atrophic character.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _B. Relative Sterility._\r\n\r\na. Owing to mechanical interference with the conjugation of spermatozoon\r\nand ovum:\r\n\r\n I. In the male:\r\n   1. Epididymitis duplex.\r\n   2. Strictura impermeabilis urethrae.\r\n II. In the female:\r\n   I. Perioophoritis and perimetritis, and their results, viz.,\r\n      adhesions and displacements of the reproductive organs. 2. Tubal\r\n      catarrh, pyosalpinx, kinking and other forms of obstruction of the\r\n      tubes.\r\n\r\nb. Owing to extension of the gonorrhoeal process to the decidua, causing\r\nabortion in the early period of pregnancy:\r\n\r\nEndometritis gonorrhoeica chronica, and endometritis decidualis.\r\n\r\n_Benzler_ has endeavoured to elucidate the problem of the relations\r\nbetween gonorrhoea and sterility by a collective investigation in the\r\narmy. The investigation was concerned with 474 men who during their\r\nperiod of service with the colours had been treated for gonorrhoea, and\r\nwho subsequently had married. Dealing with all cases alike, without\r\nregard to complications which had been observed in some cases but not in\r\nothers, of the 474 wives, there were 64 who never became pregnant =\r\n13.5%; 78 who had one child only = 16.5%; total, 142 = 30%.\r\n\r\nLeaving out of consideration the cases in which epididymitis had been\r\nobserved, there remained 363 cases of uncomplicated urethritis; of the\r\n363 wives of these men, there were 38 who never became pregnant = 10.5%;\r\n63 who had one child only = 17.3%; total 101 = 27.8%.\r\n\r\nThus, in the cases in which the husbands had had uncomplicated\r\nurethritis, the percentage of absolute sterility was only 10.5; while in\r\nthe unselected cases of gonorrhoea, it was no more than 13.5. The\r\nfigures show clearly that the influence of uncomplicated gonorrhoea is\r\nbut trifling; indeed, it is obvious that this must be the case, for it\r\nis probable that not less than 80% of men experience at least one attack\r\nof gonorrhoea, and did this give rise to sterility, either directly by\r\nits influence on the men themselves, or indirectly by transmission to\r\ntheir wives, the human race would soon die out. Moreover, the frequent\r\noccurrence of ophthalmia neonatorum is a sufficient proof that\r\nnotwithstanding gonorrhoeal infection in all these cases, pregnancy and\r\ndelivery have taken place.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it is my opinion that in recent years the influence of\r\ngonorrhoeal infection in inducing sterility in women has been painted in\r\nfar too gloomy colours, and it is time that these extreme views should\r\nbe abandoned.\r\n\r\nThis is a convenient place to insist upon the fact that in cases which\r\nare by no means rare, in the absence of aspermatism and azoospermia, and\r\naltogether independently of gonorrhoeal infection, it is the husband who\r\nis responsible for the occurrence of sterility; in such cases the\r\nsterility is due to failure of conjugation between spermatozoon and\r\novum, dependent upon congenital or acquired defects of the penis. The\r\ngreat majority of cases of this kind are due to hypospadias.\r\n\r\nA case of sterile marriage is reported by _Lier_ and _Ascher_, in which\r\nthe husband had suffered from hypospadias and had been operated upon for\r\nthe relief of that condition. Although erection of the penis was normal,\r\nand coitus terminated in the usual orgasm, with sense of ejaculation,\r\nthe semen did not find its way into the vagina; it accumulated in the\r\nartificial cul-de-sac between the former abnormal urethral orifice and\r\nthe artificially constructed meatus, and after coitus the semen had to\r\nbe expelled from this region by digital pressure.\r\n\r\n_Miclucho-Mackay_ reports that among the Australian aborigines,\r\nhypospadias is artificially induced, in order to prevent fertilization.\r\nIn young boys, an incision is made through the lower wall of the urethra\r\nfrom the meatus as far up as the scrotum, and care is taken that the\r\nseveral surfaces do not reunite. During coitus, the semen flows away\r\nwithout entering the vagina. This mutilation is practised, not only in\r\nSouth and Central Australia, but also by the indigens of Port Darwin.\r\n\r\nThat hypospadias does not in all cases offer an insuperable obstacle to\r\nimpregnation, is, however, shown by a striking case which came under the\r\nnotice of _Labalbary_. He saw a hypospadiac who, in micturating, had to\r\ncrouch down in the feminine posture, because he was unable to project\r\nthe stream of urine forwards; in coitus, he deposited his semen only on\r\nhis wife’s vulva. But his wife gave birth to two sons, about whose\r\npaternity there could be no reasonable doubt, since both exhibited the\r\nsame malformation as their putative father.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, phimosis offers an obstacle to impregnation, and only\r\nafter relief of the condition by operation, is the wish for offspring\r\nfulfilled. A case of this nature is recorded by _Amussat_.\r\n\r\nIn cases of severe stricture of the urethra, sterility may result,\r\nalthough the constitution of the semen is perfectly normal. During\r\nerection of the penis, the stricture is completely closed, and the semen\r\naccumulates in the urethra above it; when the penis becomes flaccid, the\r\nsemen flows away, outside the vagina. In some such cases, the semen\r\nregurgitates into the bladder, and is not discharged until the patient\r\nmakes water. Although the supposition is not one in which strict proof\r\nis obtainable, it is probable that the man is at fault in cases in which\r\nthe wives of two or more brothers fail to conceive. I have seen several\r\ninstances of the kind. Three brothers, all quite healthy, and of virile\r\naspect, were married to women in whom on gynecological examination no\r\nsignificant abnormality could be detected; they had been married\r\nrespectively for 14, 9, and 8 years; all were childless. Three brothers,\r\ntwo of whom were practising physicians, had lived a number of years (20,\r\n4, and 14, respectively) in sterile wedlock; one of them (a physician)\r\ninformed me that he ejaculated always a very small quantity of semen,\r\nand thought it possible that this was the cause of the sterility. Of\r\nfour brothers, two had lived long in barren wedlock; the third had no\r\nchild for 14 years after marriage, when at last his wife became pregnant\r\nafter a visit to a spa; the fourth brother is a misogynist and a\r\nconfirmed bachelor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Sexual Sensibility in Women._\r\n\r\nIn our consideration of the various influences by which the contact of\r\novum and spermatozoon may be prevented, the degree of sexual excitement\r\nexperienced by the woman during the sexual act must not be overlooked,\r\nfor this plays a part not to be underestimated, even though it is a\r\nmatter on which it is difficult to obtain accurate information.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely probable that an active participation on the part of the\r\nwoman in coitus has an important influence upon the attainment of\r\nfertilization, i. e., that sexual excitement in the woman is a link in\r\nthe chain of conditions leading to conception. This excitement has a\r\nreflex influence, but the influence may be exercised in either (or both)\r\nof two ways: first, it may cause certain reflex changes in the cervical\r\nsecretion, whereby the passage of the spermatozoa is facilitated; or,\r\nsecondly, it may give rise to reflex changes in the vaginal portion of\r\nthe cervix, to a rounding of the os uteri externum and a hardening of\r\nthe consistency of the cervix (changes of an erectile nature) coupled\r\nwith a slight descent of the uterus—changes which likewise favour the\r\nentrance of the semen into the uterine cavity. _Theopold_ goes so far as\r\nto say that it is only women who experience erotic excitement who are\r\ncapable of being impregnated.\r\n\r\nMy own opinion is that considerable importance is to be attached to\r\nvoluptuous excitement of the woman during coitus, for the former of the\r\ntwo reasons mentioned above, namely, because such excitement leads to\r\nthe occurrence of reflex secretion of the cervical glands, the secretion\r\nthus produced maintaining or enhancing the activity of the spermatozoa;\r\nand contrariwise, in the absence of voluptuous excitement on the woman’s\r\npart there is a failure of the reflex secretion, and the passage of the\r\nspermatozoa into the uterine cavity is consequently less easily\r\neffected. That sexual excitement has great influence upon the production\r\nof the first appearance of menstruation, has frequently been shown; and\r\nan analogy between such an influence and the suggested effect of sexual\r\nexcitement in favouring the occurrence of conception, must not lightly\r\nbe rejected. It is well known that the first menstruation occurs at an\r\nearlier age in girls living in towns than in those living in the\r\ncountry; not solely (if at all) in consequence of the better nutriment\r\nand easier life of the former, but also, unquestionably, owing to\r\nnervous influences. It is, moreover, a familiar experience that factory\r\ngirls, who from early youth are exposed to sexual stimulation, attain\r\nsexual maturity at an extremely early age. Again, from early times it\r\nhas been the prevailing opinion of the common people that for the\r\nimpregnation of a woman it was necessary for her to experience\r\nvoluptuous excitement, or at least, that in the absence of such\r\nexcitement, conception was rendered difficult. _Riedel_ relates of the\r\nindigens of the Island of Buru, that they often have sexual intercourse\r\nwith foreigners, “but during such intercourse they remain quite passive,\r\nin order to avoid impregnation.” It is not an unusual experience in\r\ngynecological practice for a sterile woman, in the absence of any\r\nprompting, to complain that during coitus she has no “feeling” whatever,\r\nand to attribute to this lack of feeling her failure to conceive.\r\n\r\nA cultured lady, the mother of several children, assured me, not only\r\nthat she was always aware, whether an act of intercourse would or would\r\nnot lead to impregnation, but further, that it was within her power to\r\ndetermine whether the intercourse should or should not be fruitful. If\r\nshe was passive during intercourse, or if, to use her own expression,\r\nher attitude was one of “laisser faire, laisser aller,” conception would\r\nnot occur; but if, on the other hand, she took an active part in the\r\ncoitus, so that she experienced a powerful voluptuous sensation,\r\npregnancy would result from the intercourse.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the previously described condition of dyspareunia is the\r\ncause of the sterility. In fact, the combination of dyspareunia with\r\nsterility is so strikingly common, that my own observations have led me\r\nto infer that there is a casual connexion between the two states, at\r\nleast in a considerable proportion of cases.\r\n\r\nI append a short note of a few instances of this kind: Mrs. G., aged 27,\r\nmarried 6 years, sterile; an anæmic, delicate lady, who has never\r\nexperienced the sense of ejaculation. The semen flows away from the\r\nvagina immediately after the completion of coitus. No abnormality to be\r\ndetected on gynecological examination. Mrs. S., aged 24, married 5\r\nyears, sterile; during intercourse remains completely cold, and has\r\nexperienced the sense of ejaculation in dreams only. Gynecological\r\nexamination disclosed the existence of slight cervical catarrh, but no\r\nother abnormality. Mrs. E., aged 30, married 10 years, had a child 9\r\nyears previously, a difficult delivery followed by puerperal disease,\r\nsince then sterile; she states that since her delivery she has not\r\nexperienced the sense of ejaculation, with which she was formerly\r\nfamiliar; further, since that time she has suffered from profluvium\r\nseminis. On gynecological examination the uterus was found to be\r\nenlarged and retroflexed. Mrs. K., aged 28, married 6 years, sterile;\r\namenorrhoeic, has never experienced the sense of ejaculation, and finds\r\nsexual intercourse so unpleasant that, “in order to be left in peace,”\r\nshe has herself begged her husband to keep a mistress. Examination\r\nshowed the uterus to be in an infantile condition.\r\n\r\nWhilst I have notes of numerous cases similar to those just quoted, I\r\nmust also insist upon the fact that I have sometimes had complaints of\r\ndyspareunia from wives whose fertility has been proved by the birth of\r\nnumerous children. And, again, anyone whose position permits him\r\nfrequent glimpses of what passes behind the scenes of married life, will\r\nfrom time to time have noticed as signs of relative dyspareunia\r\ninstances in which the faithless wife is far more readily impregnated by\r\nher lover than by the husband to whom she is indifferent or whom she\r\nactually dislikes.\r\n\r\nTo relative dyspareunia dependent upon sexual disharmony we must refer\r\nalso those instances in which a man and a woman prove sterile while\r\nliving together for a considerable period as man and wife, but after\r\nseparation both prove fertile in fresh unions. Several such cases have\r\ncome within my own experience, and similar instances attracted the\r\nattention of the observers of antiquity—_Aristotle_, for example.\r\n_Haller_, for this reason, lays stress on the lack of mutual affection\r\nas a cause of sterility; and _Virey_, also, believes that sterility may\r\noften depend upon the absence of the “harmonie d’amour.”\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the custom, which in certain rural districts has\r\npersisted into quite recent times, of a temporary experimental\r\ncohabitation of candidates for matrimony, was based on an attempt to\r\ndiscover the existence of such a sexual harmony. _Ploss_, for instance,\r\nreports that in East Prussia, in 1864, he was informed that among the\r\nMazurs this custom of an experimental year of cohabitation was in force.\r\nIf during this year the woman became pregnant, the young couple were\r\nmarried; but if pregnancy failed to occur, they separated, considering\r\nthey were not formed for one another.\r\n\r\nA well-known historical example of relative sterility is furnished by\r\nthe two marriages of Napoleon I. His first marriage to Josephine\r\nremained sterile, though Josephine had children by Beauharnais; and\r\nNapoleon, remarried to Marie Louise, had a son by the latter.\r\n\r\n_Von Gutceit_, a physician of wide experience, points out that\r\n“sensitive women, who have a mental or physical antipathy to\r\ncohabitation, or who have a secret but ardent affection for some other\r\nman, often fail to conceive as a result of intercourse with their\r\nhusbands; but when, in illicit intercourse, they experience the\r\nvoluptuous sensations to which they have hitherto been strangers,\r\npregnancy often speedily ensues.” He maintains, further, “that such\r\nwomen, in consequence of the stimulation of the genital organs in the\r\nabsence of sexual gratification, become affected with all kinds of\r\nmenstrual irregularities, with fluor albus, prolapse of the uterus, and\r\nchronic metritis; they suffer from digestive disturbances and\r\nconstipation, leading to emaciation; and they are prone to hysterical\r\nmanifestations.”\r\n\r\nAnalogous phenomena have been noted, and with much greater distinctness,\r\nin the animal world. _Darwin_, writing on this subject, remarks: “It is\r\nby no means a rare occurrence, that certain males and females will not\r\nbe fruitful in intercourse together, whilst the same individuals prove\r\nperfectly fertile in intercourse with other members of their species—and\r\nthis in cases in which there is no evidence that the subsequent\r\nfertility is due to any change in the conditions of life. The cause is\r\nprobably to be found in an innate sexual disharmony between the\r\ninfertile pair. A very large number of instances of this kind have been\r\nreported to me by well-known breeders of horses, cattle, pigs, dogs, and\r\npigeons. Sometimes a breeder will fail to obtain offspring from a male\r\nand a female of known fertility whom he wishes to couple for some\r\nspecial reasons. The most celebrated living horse-breeder informed me\r\nthat frequently a mare, which in other seasons with other stallions has\r\nproved fertile, may be coupled with a stallion likewise of proved\r\nreproductive potency, and will fail to be impregnated; yet this same\r\nmare will shortly afterwards be impregnated by another stallion.”\r\n\r\n_Pflüger_ reports that he has often seen a thoroughbred stallion, which\r\nwas fully prepared, at a moment’s notice, to serve a thoroughbred mare,\r\nprove extremely unwilling to serve a common mare on heat, and only\r\ninduced to do so with the greatest difficulty, and indeed by a trick.\r\nThe stallion is placed in the central one of three stalls, on one side\r\nof him is the thoroughbred mare, whilst in the third stall is the common\r\nmare, covered with a cloth. The stallion’s head is turned to show him\r\nthe thoroughbred mare; immediately his appearance undergoes a change.\r\nEvery muscle of his body appears to quiver, and never does a fine animal\r\nappear more beautiful than at such a moment, full of pride, fire, and\r\nvitality.[51] As soon as the stallion makes ready to serve the mare, he\r\nis rapidly led to the other stall, and suitably assisted to the actual\r\ncommencement of intercourse with the substituted mare. But it sometimes\r\nhappens, as _Pflüger_ himself has seen, that the stallion becoming aware\r\nof the deception, refuses to complete the coitus, withdraws his penis,\r\nand immediately turns to the mare of his choice.\r\n\r\n_Matthews Duncan_, among 191 sterile women, found that 39 had no sexual\r\nappetite, and 62 had no voluptuous sensations during coitus. He regards\r\nabnormal sexual appetite as one of the principal causes of sterility.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these facts, it must not be forgotten that many cases\r\nare recorded in medical literature of women conceiving after intercourse\r\neffected against their wishes, as by rape, or when they were in a state\r\nof intoxication, or asleep, or in the entire absence of all voluptuous\r\nsensation. Moreover, the erection of the vaginal portion of the cervix,\r\nand the reflex movements and secretory changes in the uterus, may also\r\noccur independently of sexual desire and voluptuous sensation; but such\r\ncases are certainly exceptional, and their credibility is frequently\r\nopen to suspicion. In numerous instances in which conception is stated\r\nto have followed intercourse in a state of unconsciousness, judicial\r\nproceedings have elicited the fact that the intercourse was not entirely\r\ninvoluntary on the woman’s part, and that the alleged force was no more\r\nthan a _vis grata_. _Von Maschka_ reports a case in which a girl\r\nasserted that she had been violated whilst in a condition of epileptic\r\nunconsciousness, but she remembered every detail of the act with\r\nprecision. _Casper_, again, in a case in which it was asserted that\r\ndefloration had been forcibly effected whilst the girl was in a state of\r\nalcoholic coma, showed that there had been no more than moderate\r\nintoxication combined with great sexual excitement. Assertions that\r\npregnancy has resulted from intercourse effected during sleep, in a\r\nstate of unconsciousness, or in the “magnetic” or “hypnotic” state,\r\nshould always be accepted with reserve.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note in this connexion that the Chinese physicians\r\nenumerates among the causes of sterility the practice of “congfou” by\r\nthe man, this name being given to a manipulation analogous to hypnotism,\r\nwhereby the voluptuous sensation during intercourse is diminished or\r\nabolished by distracting the attention elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA proof of the importance of specific sexual sensation for the\r\nattainment of conception is afforded by the fact that in the majority of\r\nwomen voluptuous excitement is absent at the first act of intercourse,\r\nand only gradually develops thereafter; in correspondence with this, we\r\nfind that the first conception does not usually occur until some time\r\nafter marriage, and that the period of its occurrence frequently\r\ncoincides with the full development of voluptuous sensation during\r\nintercourse. Thus, even in the woman fully fitted for conception, the\r\nactual capacity for impregnation is only developed gradually, and after\r\na sufficient experience of intercourse.\r\n\r\nThis transient incapacity for conception may, indeed, also depend upon\r\nthe fact that at first coitus is apt to be incompletely effected, and\r\nfor this both husband and wife are to blame; but unquestionably in many\r\ncases the reason is the one first mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, certain psychical influences which affect the intensity\r\nof the voluptuous sensation, manifest its significance. Thus, in some\r\ninstances, the influence of stimulation of the clitoris in leading to\r\nconception has been clearly shown; in others, the performance of coitus\r\nin some unusual position, varying with the woman concerned, is alone\r\ncompetent to arouse sexual sensibility to its full extent, and to bring\r\nabout the orgasm. One occasionally receives confidential information\r\nfrom a husband that his wife experiences a voluptuous sensation only\r\nwhen coitus is performed in the lateral posture, or _more bestiarum_, or\r\nin the _situs inversus_, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nExcessive frequency of intercourse, prolonged and repeated sexual\r\nexcitement, on the other hand, induce sterility, as is well seen in\r\nprostitutes, who rarely become pregnant.\r\n\r\nFinally, perverse sexual impulse must be mentioned as a possible cause\r\nof sterility. This may be an acquired perversion, due to the fact that\r\nat the epoch of the menarche, the commencement of puberty, owing to the\r\nstrength of sexual desire whilst intercourse is an impossibility, or\r\nsimply from evil example, the girl has become a confirmed onanist, and\r\ncontinues the habit even after marriage. In other cases we have to do\r\nwith a psychopathic state, a form of mental degeneration due to very\r\nvarious causes, or in some cases inverted sexual sensibility exists in a\r\nperson whose mind is in other respects normal. In women with sexual\r\ninversion, ordinary copulation with the male is insufficient to arouse\r\nthe sexual orgasm, and for this reason, as well as because persons thus\r\naffected avoid coitus as much as possible, sterility commonly ensues.\r\n\r\nIn sterile homosexual women, and equally so in women addicted to\r\nmasturbation, gynecological examination may disclose no abnormality\r\nwhatever; but in other cases of the kind we may find a contributory\r\ncause of sterility in the fact that the internal genital organs are\r\nimperfectly developed, or even completely absent. In sterile women, if\r\non gynecological examination we find certain characteristic changes in\r\nthe reproductive organs, a strong suspicion will be aroused that the\r\nsterility is due to abnormal modes of sexual gratification. The changes\r\nin question are: hypertrophy of the clitoris, enlargement and a bluish\r\ncolouration of the labia minora, retroversion of the uterus, neuralgia\r\nand displacement of the ovaries, leucorrhoea, and menorrhagia.\r\n\r\nThe question has been mooted by _Cohnstein_, whether, as is commonly\r\nassumed, a woman is capable of becoming pregnant at any time during the\r\nyear, or whether, as in the lower animals, the reproductive capacity can\r\nbe exercised only at certain seasons, or again, whether there may not be\r\nindividual moments of predilection for the occurrence of conception. He\r\nfound that in the great majority of women there were such seasons of\r\npredilection, and only in a minority could conception be effected\r\nindifferently at any time of the year. As a proof of this assertion, he\r\nappends the following case: A married woman, 33 years of age, had\r\nseveral years before been delivered prematurely of a still-born child,\r\nand since then had not again been pregnant. Her reproductive organs were\r\nnormal. The husband’s semen was examined, and also found to be quite\r\nfree from abnormality. In the course of the three following years an\r\nattempt was made to cure the sterility by dilatation of the cervical\r\ncanal, suggestions for the proper regulation of sexual intercourse,\r\netc., but all without effect. _Cohnstein_ now calculated the date at\r\nwhich the full term of the previous pregnancy would have fallen, and\r\nfound that this was the middle of February; he therefore inferred that\r\nintercourse effected at the beginning of May would result in\r\nimpregnation. As a fact, the woman conceived at this time, and at full\r\nterm gave birth to a healthy girl. The assumption that such a time of\r\npredilection for the occurrence of conception exists is, however,\r\ncontradicted by the well known fact that in the case of large families\r\nthe children’s birthdays are irregularly distributed throughout the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n_Baker-Brown_ describes a special form of sterility due to “sympathetic\r\nor reflex action.” It depends upon diseases of the organs adjoining the\r\nuterus, such as vascular tumours of the urethra, bleeding piles,\r\nfistula, fissure, and prolapse of the anus, schirrus of the rectum,\r\nascarides. “These diseases produce sterility in consequence of the loss\r\nof blood, the menstrual disturbances, the morbid congestion of the\r\nuterine system, and the reflex neuroses, to which they give rise.”\r\n_Courty_ reports a case belonging to this category in which in a young\r\nmarried lady sterility was due to fissure of the anus, which had long\r\nexisted without recognition; after the fissure had healed, conception\r\noccurred. _Palmay_ recently reported a case in which “taenia solium was\r\nthe cause of sterility. In a woman 20 years of age, who had lived in\r\nsterile wedlock for three years, the presence in the intestine of a\r\ntapeworm, which she had harboured for many years, gave rise to\r\ndysmenorrhœal troubles. The complete expulsion of the worm relieved the\r\ndysmenorrhœa, the woman became pregnant, and gave birth to a child at\r\nfull term; since then menstruation has been painless.” The presence of\r\nthe tapeworm may have had an unfavourable influence upon the\r\nblood-supply and the innervation of the uterus. But cases of this nature\r\ndo not constitute a special form of sterility; they must be classed,\r\neither with cases due to interference with ovulation, or with those due\r\nto prevention of the contact of ovum and spermatozoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Incapacity for Incubation of the Ovum._\r\n\r\nThe fertilization of the ovum is, as previously described, probably\r\neffected in man, as in other mammals, in the upper third of the\r\nFallopian tube. The fertilized ovum is then swept down into the uterus\r\nby the action of the cilia which line the tube, assisted by the\r\nperistaltic movement of the muscular wall of the canal. The uterine\r\nmucous membrane at this time is thickened and thrown into folds, and in\r\nthese latter the fertilized ovum is entangled; by its presence the ovum\r\nnow exerts a reflex stimulus leading to a still greater proliferation of\r\nthe cells of the uterine mucous membrane, which grows up over the ovum\r\nand soon shuts it off completely from the uterine cavity. Thus the ovum\r\ncomes to be entirely imbedded in the substance of the mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nThus for the implantation of the ovum, it is first of all necessary that\r\nthe uterine mucous membrane should be in a normal condition;\r\npathological changes in this membrane, and indeed any morbid structural\r\nalteration in the uterine tissues, may prevent the implantation and\r\nincubation of the ovum, and may thus give rise to sterility.\r\n\r\nThe uterine cavity is normally lined with ciliated epithelium, the cells\r\nof which have an elongated elliptical form. The movement of the cilia is\r\ndirected downwards. The epithelium is perforated by the orifices of the\r\nuterine glands; these glands are simple tubular glands, passing through\r\nthe mucous membrane with an S-shaped or corkscrew curve; between the\r\nglands lies a rich germinal tissue, made up of rounded cells. The\r\nrounded connective tissue cells have processes which build up the\r\nscaffolding of the mucous membrane. Among the connective tissue cells of\r\nthe uterine mucous membrane, wandering leucocytes are almost always to\r\nbe seen. Menstruation is characterized by a swelling of the mucous\r\nmembrane, and by enlargement of the uterine glands. At the same time,\r\nblood extravasations appear between the more superficial layers of the\r\nmembrane, and on its free surface, and various portions of the surface\r\nof the membrane are cast off.\r\n\r\nVery numerous are the morbid states of the uterus and its annexa whereby\r\nthe implantation and incubation of the ovum are prevented; and\r\nincapacity of the uterus for the fulfilment of these functions is\r\ntherefore a common cause of sterility in women.\r\n\r\nThat developmental defects of the uterus, even when they are not such as\r\nrender conception impossible, may yet often give rise to sterility, has\r\nbeen already explained in writing of the conditions of the uterus which\r\nprevent the contact of ovum and spermatozoon; for defects of development\r\nwhich are not sufficiently severe to prevent this contact, may yet\r\nsuffice to render the uterus unfit for the implantation and incubation\r\nof the fertilized ovum. Inflammatory disorders, such as perimetritis and\r\nthe formation of exudations in the parametrium, may render the uterus\r\nunable to undergo the enlargement necessary to pregnancy. Tissue changes\r\nin the uterine musculature may likewise prevent the implantation of the\r\novum, or the proper development of the uterus during pregnancy.\r\nNew-growths of the uterus or its neighbourhood may bring the development\r\nof the fertilized ovum to an untimely conclusion. Above all, however, it\r\nis diseases of the uterine mucous membrane which unfit the organ for the\r\nimplantation of the ovum, and thus give rise to sterility. All those\r\ninflammatory states which lead either to softening or to induration of\r\nthe uterine parenchyma, or to swelling and thickening of the endometrium\r\nor parametrium, may offer a hindrance more or less serious to the normal\r\nincubation of the ovum.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis whether in an individual case we have to do with sterility\r\ndependent upon _impotentia gestandi_, is often difficult, because the\r\nconditions which cause it are frequently associated with those which\r\ncause sterility by preventing the contact of ovum and spermatozoon. In\r\nany case, a careful examination of the pelvic organs must be made, not\r\nonly to determine whether there is any displacement or enlargement of\r\nthe uterus, chronic metritis or perimetritis, parametric exudations, or\r\nnew growths of the uterus or of neighbouring organs, but also, if\r\nnecessary by dilating the cervical canal, to ascertain the condition of\r\nthe uterine mucous membrane, and whether there is hyperplasia or atrophy\r\nthereof. In this connexion, examination of the uterine secretion is of\r\nespecial importance: a purely mucous, transparent, vitreous, tenacious\r\nsecretion in the os and in the cervical canal, indicates the existence\r\nof catarrhal endometritis; a markedly haemorrhagic secretion signifies\r\nhyperplastic endometritis; profuse purulent secretion containing\r\ngonococci, indicates gonorrhoeal endometritis; the discharge of pieces\r\nof membrane shows that there is exfoliative endometritis; the discovery\r\nof fragments of carcinomatous tissue indicates the breaking down of a\r\nmalignant tumour of this nature; etc.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is necessary to obtain a careful history of the case, asking\r\nwhether there have been menstrual irregularities, or miscarriages, and\r\nthe characters of previous labours (in cases of acquired sterility); any\r\npathological conditions in other organs should be investigated; and the\r\ncondition of the blood and the state of general nutrition should receive\r\nattention. Chlorosis, anæmia, and scrofula often give rise to catarrhal\r\nendometritis; severe disease of the heart may lead to congestive\r\ntroubles of the genital organs; after abortion or difficult labour,\r\nchronic metritis or endometritis are common. Further, the differential\r\ndiagnosis between erosion and carcinoma of the portio vaginalis, must\r\noften depend upon consideration of the patient’s age and general health,\r\nand upon the nature and duration of the haemorrhage. Pain on\r\nmicturition, appearing soon after marriage, and lasting often a few days\r\nonly, will indicate the probability of gonorrhoeal infection, etc.\r\n\r\n_Von Grünewaldt_ has vigorously insisted upon the fact that the notion\r\nof sterility, i. e., _impotentia generandi_ in women, is not coincident\r\nwith the notion of _impotentia concipiendi_, and there is an important\r\ndistinction between cases in which it is impossible that fertilization\r\nshould be effected, and cases in which, though fertilization may take\r\nplace, the implantation and incubation of the ovum fail to ensue. In\r\nthis author’s opinion, the only absolute mechanical hindrance to the\r\nentrance of the semen is to be found in atresia of the genital passage,\r\nand the role of _impotentia concipiendi_ is of quite minor importance as\r\ncompared with incapacity on the part of the uterus for the implantation\r\nand incubation of the ovum, an opinion, which, notwithstanding the\r\nrecord of exceptional cases in which pregnancy has occurred in spite of\r\nthe existence of mechanical obstacles to conception, I must regard as\r\naltogether beyond the mark. On the other hand, it is indisputable that\r\nfor the occurrence of pregnancy it is necessary, not only that contact\r\nof ovum and spermatozoon should be possible, but further, that the\r\nuterus should be in a condition favourable for the implantation and\r\nfurther development of the ovum subsequent to fertilization. For this\r\nreason, diseases of the uterine tissues must play an important part in\r\nthe causation of sterility, though we cannot go so far as to admit with\r\n_von Grünewaldt_ that these diseases are the _principal_ cause of\r\nreproductive incapacity in women.\r\n\r\nVarious metritic processes, and also venous hyperaemia consequent upon\r\nheart disease, may lead to atrophy of the uterine mucous membrane, which\r\nthen appears thin and smooth, whilst the uterine glands are destroyed,\r\nor transformed into small cysts. The same condition may result from\r\nretention of secretions in the uterine cavity—hydrometra and\r\nhaematometra. In all these cases, the epithelium probably loses its\r\ncilia. The process has a serious influence antagonistic to the\r\nreproductive capacity inasmuch as the implantation of the chorionic\r\nvilli is rendered difficult (_Klebs_).\r\n\r\nHyperplasia of the uterine parenchyma, affecting either the whole organ\r\nor a large part, and characterized either by enlargement of the entire\r\norgan, or only by thickening and elongation of the cervix, may hinder\r\nthe incubation of the ovum. It may be due to endometritic catarrhal\r\nprocesses; to venous hyperaemia, especially in cases of valvular heart\r\ndisease; to subinvolution; and sometimes to excessive sexual\r\nstimulation, as in prostitutes. Both the change in the shape of the\r\ncervix, and the changes undergone by the uterine mucous membrane in\r\ncases of extensive uterine hyperplasia (it commonly becomes atrophic and\r\ndischarges a watery secretion), interfere with the reproductive\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of chronic metritis, the hyperaemia and hyperplasia of the\r\nuterus may give rise to haemorrhages; these sweep away the ovum, and\r\nthus lead to _impotentia gestandi_. And the nutritive changes in the\r\nmucous membrane that occur in chronic metritis also interfere with the\r\nimplantation and incubation of the ovum. Moreover, it is well known that\r\nin these cases, even if conception is effected, abortion is extremely\r\napt to occur, owing to the pathological state of the endometrium, which\r\ninterferes with the normal development of the decidua. Haemorrhages\r\noccur in the decidua, and are followed by abortion. And further, the\r\nreplacement of portions of the muscular tissue of the uterine wall by\r\nfibrous tissue, a change which is apt to occur in long continued\r\nmetritis, interferes with the proper expansion of the uterus during\r\npregnancy, and thus leads to abortion.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it cannot be denied that frequently enough patients\r\nwith well marked chronic metritis nevertheless conceive in a normal\r\nmanner, and give birth to a healthy child; and this not once only, but\r\nagain and again.\r\n\r\nAs sterility due to mesometritis, _von Grünewaldt_ classes the numerous\r\ncases in which sterility ensues upon a confinement in which the patient\r\nreports that inflammation followed delivery—or sometimes in which\r\nnothing abnormal was noticed. The results of local examination are\r\nnegative: there is no displacement, no exudation or swelling, and no\r\nrelevant affection of the endometrium. But the characteristic feature of\r\nthese cases is, according to _von Grünewaldt_, that after her last\r\nfull-time delivery, a woman has had a miscarriage or a premature\r\ndelivery, and subsequently has been completely sterile. The degenerative\r\nprocess is at first partial, so that it does not prevent conception, but\r\nrenders it impossible for the pregnancy to go on to full term;\r\nsubsequently it extends throughout the mesometrium, and conception is no\r\nlonger possible.\r\n\r\n_Cole_ of San Francisco regards as the most frequent cause of sterility\r\nensuing upon a single delivery, subinvolution of the uterus, most\r\ncommonly due to rising too early after delivery. He therefore considers\r\nit of especial importance after a first delivery that the physician\r\nshould satisfy himself that no serious injury has been effected by the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nChronic endometritis is a very frequent cause of sterility: in the first\r\nplace, the catarrhal swelling of the mucous membrane, which often\r\nextends from the os uteri externum to the ostium abdominale of the\r\nFallopian tubes, offers an obstacle alike to the downward passage of the\r\novum and the upward passage of the spermatozoa; and secondly, in long\r\nstanding cases, the large size of the uterine cavity and the smoothness\r\nof the surface of the atrophied mucous membrane, render the lodgment of\r\nthe ovum in the uterus very unlikely. A further powerful obstacle to\r\nimpregnation in cases of endometritis is offered by the profuse\r\nmuco-purulent secretion which usually, though not invariably,\r\naccompanies that disease. This secretion, in some cases flowing freely\r\nover the surface of the membrane, but in others adhering to it with\r\ntenacity, whitish-yellow in colour, rendered cloudy by admixture of pus,\r\nor tinted red by admixture of blood, sometimes of a gelatinous\r\nconsistency with a strongly alkaline reaction, contains globules of\r\nmucus, ciliated and cylindrical epithelial cells, pus corpuscles,\r\nbacteria and cocci,—and, if the endometritis is of gonorrhoeal origin,\r\nthe gonococcus of _Neisser_. This secretion, when profuse and thinly\r\nfluid, pours out through the os, and sweeps away the semen; when\r\ntenacious and gelatinous, it fills up the dilated cervical canal above\r\nthe constricted os uteri externum, and constitutes a powerful barrier to\r\nthe upward passage of the spermatozoa; when purulent, it is destructive\r\nto the vital activity of the spermatozoa. The changes in the mucous\r\nmembrane in cases of long standing endometritis whereby the uterus is\r\nrendered unfit for the implantation and incubation of the ovum, are the\r\nfollowing. The epithelial cells, as usual in cases of continued catarrh,\r\nchange in form, the ciliated cells disappear, and are replaced, first by\r\ncylindrical cells, later by polymorphic cells, approaching in type those\r\nof pavement epithelium. The mucous membrane is swelled, the vessels are\r\ndilated, there is hyperplasia of the glands, with a moderate amount of\r\nsmall-celled infiltration of the interglandular tissue (Fig. 83).\r\nUltimately the mucous membrane undergoes atrophy, its glands disappear,\r\nit comes to resemble a thin stratum of connective tissue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 83.—Uterine Mucous Membrane in Endometritis. (After A. Martin.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThus, in severe and long-continued endometritis, the changes that occur\r\nin the uterine mucous membrane render the implantation of the ovum and\r\nthe formation of normal decidua impossible; even if conception does\r\noccur, the fertilized ovum is speedily discharged. Frequently, in cases\r\nof endometritis, there is consecutive displacement of the uterus which\r\nacts as a contributory cause of sterility. When endometritis lasts a\r\nlong time, proliferation of connective tissue in the uterine parenchyma\r\nalso occurs, leading often to hypertrophy of the cervix, and to stenosis\r\nof the cervical canal. Since in so many different ways endometritis may\r\ngive rise to sterility, the importance that must be attached to this\r\ncondition is evident.\r\n\r\nThe great significance of gonorrhoeal infection in relation to sterility\r\nin women depends, not only on the changes this disease causes in the\r\nFallopian tubes, leading to interference with the necessary contact of\r\novum and spermatozoon, but further, upon the occurrence of gonorrhoeal\r\ncervical and corporal endometritis, of perimetritis, and secondary\r\nparenchymatous metritis. Still, under appropriate treatment, the\r\ninflammatory changes consequent on gonorrhoeal infection are in many\r\ncases curable, and, after absorption of the exudations and restoration\r\nof the normal nutritive conditions of the tissues, conception may take\r\nplace. _Fritsch_, who points out that in the woman infected with\r\ngonorrhoea, sterility ensues in a manner analogous to that in which it\r\noccurs in the male (for in the latter it is not the primary urethritis,\r\nthe disease of the passage, but the secondary inflammation of the\r\ntesticle that leads to sterility), states that he has observed cases in\r\nwhich beyond question conception has occurred, notwithstanding the\r\nexistence of gonorrhoeal endometritis.\r\n\r\nIn my own experience, whilst gonorrhoeal endometritis is, among\r\ninflammations of the endometrium, the most frequent cause of sterility,\r\nthe place of next importance in this connexion is occupied by\r\nexfoliative endometritis, or membranous dysmenorrhœa. This name is given\r\nto a pathological condition in which from time to time, usually during\r\nmenstruation, fragments of membrane, or even an entire sac-like cast of\r\nthe uterine cavity, are expelled from the uterus; since this condition\r\nis apt to hinder the incubation of the ovum, it is commonly associated\r\nwith sterility—a fact mentioned already by _Denman_ in 1790, and since\r\nthen confirmed by numerous observers. I have had under observation\r\nseveral cases of dysmenorrhœa membranacea; in two cases it existed from\r\nthe time of marriage—in one case 14 years, in the other 8 years—and in\r\nboth sterility was absolute. In the latter of the two cases, vigorous\r\ntreatment was undertaken, even curettage of the uterus, but quite\r\nwithout avail. In other cases, the sterility was acquired, the\r\nmembranous dysmenorrhœa having begun after the woman had already had one\r\nor more children; but as I have never seen a case in which a woman\r\nbecame pregnant after the development of this affection, I am compelled\r\nto regard it as one of the most severe hindrances to conception.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, exfoliative endometritis terminates only with the\r\nonset of the climacteric age; in very exceptional cases, however, a cure\r\nmay take place earlier. In cases in which this premature termination has\r\nbeen observed, pregnancy has been known to ensue, cases of this nature\r\nhaving been observed by _Solowieff_, _Fordyce Barker_, and _Thomas_. And\r\nrecently, cases have been reported, in which the disease has returned\r\nafter such a pregnancy. _Fritsch_, indeed, is of opinion that\r\nexfoliative endometritis does not cause sterility, and that in this\r\ndisease abortion is no commoner than in other diseases of the uterus.\r\n_Charpignon_, _Hennig_, and _Bordier_ have also observed conception\r\noccur in the course of this disease. In 42 cases of membranous\r\ndysmenorrhœa collected by _Kleinwächter_, pregnancy occurred in four\r\nduring the existence of the disease. _Löhlein_ also reports that, among\r\n27 patients affected with membranous dysmenorrhœa, six became pregnant,\r\nafter the symptoms had been clear and unmistakable for a shorter or\r\nlonger period. Two of these patients had been already pregnant before\r\nthe first appearance of the exfoliative endometritis; subsequently they\r\nbecame pregnant and were delivered at full term. The other four had\r\nsuffered for varying periods and with varying severity from the\r\naffection, before they first became pregnant. In three of these cases\r\ncurettage of the uterus was performed; but in one only, in which\r\npregnancy ensued very speedily on the operation, could a causal\r\nconnexion be inferred. In two of the cases the mothers of the patient\r\nhad also suffered from the affection.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted by _B. Schultze_ and others that curettage of the\r\nuterus renders it difficult or impossible for pregnancy subsequently to\r\noccur. There is, however, no evidence to justify such an opinion.\r\n\r\nEspecial attention should be given to inflammatory processes in the\r\nperimetrium and the parametrium as diseases giving rise to sterility in\r\nwomen. They are extremely common, and at times are so insidious, running\r\ntheir course without giving rise either to pain or to fever, that even\r\nwhen very extensive, and even when they have led to the formation of\r\nsecondary tumour-growths, they may yet be overlooked. Hence their\r\npathological significance in the causation of sterility in women is\r\nstill underestimated. Chronic pelvic peritonitis and parametritis may\r\nlead to the onset of sterility in various ways: changes may occur in the\r\ncervix, this organ becoming indurated, fixed, and retroposed, and\r\npainful when the uterus is moved; inflammatory changes may affect the\r\nbody of the uterus, the ligaments of the ovary, and various portions of\r\nthe pelvic peritoneum; displacement of the uterus may occur; one or both\r\novaries or tubes may be dislocated and fixed, either to the side of the\r\nuterus, or behind it, in the pouch of Douglas; all kinds of adhesions or\r\ninflammatory nodules may result from these processes. Further, in the\r\nscarred, contracted, sclerosed parametric tissue, the blood and\r\nlymphatic vessels of the parametrium are compressed, and in part\r\nobliterated, and the intimate connexion between the pelvic cellular\r\ntissue and the uterus readily leads to the onset of endometritis,\r\nwhereby the implantation of the ovum is interfered with. The occurrence\r\nof sterility in cases of pelvic peritonitis and parametritis, depends in\r\npart on the indirect effects of the inflammatory exudations, and in part\r\non the direct result of the extension of the inflammation to other\r\nregions. The perimetritis, parametritis, and pelvic peritonitis that\r\nresult from gonorrhoeal infection have thus an especially disastrous\r\ninfluence, for the reason that in these cases cervical metritis and\r\nendometritis with blenorrhoea are commonly superadded. This is the\r\nprincipal cause of the almost invariable sterility of prostitutes, in\r\nwhom, however, we must also take into consideration the influence of the\r\nabsence of voluptuous sensation in an act which to them has become a\r\nmere matter of business. The investigations of _Bandl_ in the post\r\nmortem room show that residues of perimetritic and parametritic\r\ninflammation are to be found in the bodies of 58.4% of parous women, and\r\n33.3% of the bodies of women (married or unmarried) who have had\r\nexperience of sexual intercourse but have never had a child. This, he\r\nthinks, is the explanation of the great frequency of childless marriages\r\nand of relative sterility in women. In the nulliparae mentioned above,\r\n_Bandl_ commonly found an indurated, functionless, in places cicatrized,\r\nnarrowed cervix, paraoophoritic and perisalpingitic residues, and morbid\r\nchanges in the tubes and the ovaries. In some cases also the husbands of\r\nsuch sterile women were found to be affected with azoospermia. The\r\nconnexion between azoospermia in men and the discovery of inflammatory\r\nresidues in their childless wives, is a very intimate one. The husband\r\nat the time of marriage was suffering from an imperfectly cured\r\ngonorrhoea, and infected his wife. In the other class of cases, in which\r\nthe women had had children, and subsequently become sterile, the\r\nlimitation of fertility depended chiefly upon inflammatory residues in\r\nand around the ovaries and the tubes. In the majority of such cases,\r\npregnancy is not rendered impossible, but merely difficult, for,\r\nnotwithstanding the presence of very extensive inflammatory residues,\r\nthe tubes are often pervious, and the ovaries fully or partially\r\nfunctional. Therefore, even in cases in which intrapelvic inflammation\r\nhas been very severe, we must be cautious in giving a prognosis that\r\npregnancy has been rendered impossible, for the cases in which both\r\novaries are imbedded completely in pseudo-membranes, or in which both\r\ntubes have been rendered impervious, are unquestionably rare.\r\n\r\nCarcinoma of the uterus rarely causes sterility. In its initial stages,\r\nin which there is merely papillary proliferation of the portio\r\nvaginalis, or carcinomatous infiltration of the deeper layers of the\r\nmucous membrane, no hindrance is offered to conception; but even in the\r\nlater stages of the disease, when ulceration has occurred, and when\r\nthere is extensive necrosis of the cancerous masses, there is not\r\nnecessarily any absolute impossibility of the occurrence of conception,\r\nso long as cohabitation remains possible, and no insuperable hindrance\r\nhas risen to the contact of ovum and spermatozoon. The cases are\r\nnumerous in which pregnancy has been observed, notwithstanding extensive\r\ncarcinomatous disease of the cervix, with necrosis of the tumour tissue;\r\nand _Cohnstein_ even asserts, though in this he goes too far, that\r\ncancer of the cervix actually favours impregnation. Among 127 cases of\r\nthis kind, there were 21 in which the disease had existed for a year or\r\nmore before the occurrence of conception.\r\n\r\n_Winckel_ summarizes in the three following propositions his experience\r\nregarding the relation between uterine carcinoma and sterility: 1.\r\nMarried women form the very large majority of those affected with\r\ncarcinoma of the uterus; 2. The marriage of such women has very rarely\r\nproved sterile; 3. On the contrary, the women affected with this disease\r\nhave generally been exceptionally fertile.\r\n\r\nOther tumours of the uterus cause sterility, not merely by giving rise\r\nto mechanical interference with the necessary contact of ovum and\r\nspermatozoon, but also by leading to catarrhal states and hyperplasia of\r\nthe mucous membrane, which interfere with the implantation of the ovum,\r\neven when fertilization has been effected. Uterine polypi give rise to\r\nmechanical obstruction of the os uteri externum or of the cervical\r\ncanal; but they predispose to sterility in an additional way, inasmuch\r\nas in a woman affected with such a new growth any vigorous bodily\r\nmovement is apt to cause profuse uterine haemorrhage.\r\n\r\nIn cases of myoma of the uterus, apart from the mechanical hindrances to\r\nconception imposed by these tumours, there is also interference with the\r\nimplantation of the ovum. When numerous myomata have formed in the\r\nuterine wall, the mucous membrane is usually smooth and atrophied, and\r\ndischarges a watery secretion, and for these reasons the imbedding of\r\nthe ovum in the uterine cavity is rendered extremely difficult. But that\r\nthere is often an additional cause of sterility in cases of myomata\r\nuteri, has been shown by the researches of _Schorler_, who examined 822\r\npatients affected with fibromyoma of the uterus. He found that in most\r\nof those in whom sterility was observed, the tumours were not submucous\r\nbut subserous, and that the sterility was to be explained in these cases\r\nby the frequent occurrence of partial peritonitis, with its evil results\r\nto the uterine annexa.\r\n\r\n_Schorler_ appends the following table:\r\n\r\n                                          _Sterile._ _Percentage._\r\n     Of  85 women with interstitial myoma         21          24.7\r\n     Of  92 women with subserous myoma            44          47.8\r\n     Of  18 women with submucous myoma             7          38.8\r\n     Of  44 women with polypous myoma              4           9.0\r\n     Of  14 women with cervical myoma              3          18.7\r\n        ———                                       ——          ————\r\n        253                                       79          31.2\r\n\r\nWhen there are polypous new formations in the uterine cavity, even if\r\nconception occurs, abortion follows, for the reason that the rupture of\r\nthe hypertrophied capillaries in the growths themselves and in the\r\nneighbouring tissues, prevents the normal development of the embryo.\r\n_Horwitz_ has, however, described a case in which pregnancy went on to\r\nfull term, notwithstanding the existence of growths of this nature.\r\n\r\nOwing to the frequency with which chronic metritis and endometritis\r\nensue upon parturition, it can readily be understood that delivery\r\nitself is often the primary cause of subsequent sterility. A temporary\r\nsterility often follows the first delivery. It is well known that the\r\nbirth of boys is in general more difficult than the birth of girls;\r\n_Pfannkuch_ collecting information regarding the first and second\r\ndeliveries of 300 married women, ascertained that after 166 of the first\r\ndeliveries, in which boys were born, the average lapse of time to the\r\nsecond delivery was 30.2 months, whereas after 134 of the first\r\ndeliveries in which girls were born, the average lapse of time to the\r\nsecond delivery was only 27.4 months.\r\n\r\nThe importance of previous delivery in leading to sterility, in\r\nconsequence of mesometritis and diffuse connective tissue hyperplasia of\r\nthe uterus, is shown by _von Grünewaldt_, who published the following\r\nfigures as a result of his investigations. Of 56 women affected with\r\nchronic metritis, 46.4% were sterile; in 19.2% of these the sterility\r\nwas congenital, in 80.7% it was acquired. Of 134 women suffering from\r\nmyometritis and its consequences, 71.6% were sterile; in 17.7 of these\r\nthe sterility was congenital, and in 82.2% it was acquired. On the other\r\nhand, of 321 women suffering from endometritis, 29.5% were sterile; in\r\n28.4% of these the sterility was congenital, and in 71.5% it was\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\n_Lier_ and _Ascher_ also insist upon the importance of puerperal\r\ndiseases in the causation of acquired sterility, basing their opinion\r\nupon _Prochownick’s_ clinical material. They draw, however, the\r\nfollowing distinction. If the puerperal infection takes place by way of\r\nthe external organs of reproduction, through the vagina to the cervix\r\nand thence to the connective tissue of the pelvis—the most common form,\r\nthat which occurs soonest after delivery, and the most severe in its\r\ncourse—the women thus affected are likely soon to become pregnant again;\r\nif, on the other hand, the disease is pelvic peritonitis, the exciting\r\ncause of the inflammation proceeding from the interior of the uterus\r\nthrough the Fallopian tubes to reach the peritoneum, in the majority of\r\ncases the women thus affected will prove sterile for a long time or in\r\nperpetuity. In almost all the cases in which sterility resulted, the\r\npelvic peritoneum had been severely affected by the puerperal\r\ninflammation. Regarding sterility in women, the two following general\r\npropositions are laid down by _Lier_ and _Ascher_: 1. Hardly any single\r\ncause of sterility in women is so severe as to be competent by itself to\r\nrender sterility inevitable throughout the period of sexual maturity,\r\nwith the exception of defects of development and premature cessation of\r\nsexual activity. 2. Most of the hindrances to conception in women depend\r\nupon affections of the internal superficies of the reproductive organs,\r\nfrom the vulval mucous membrane upwards to the pelvic peritoneum; of\r\nthese, the most important are affections of the endometrium.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must not be forgotten, that the general tendency\r\nof a previous delivery is to increase the capacity for impregnation.\r\n_Olshausen_ especially insists upon the well-known gynecological fact,\r\nthat as a result of the first delivery, there occurs an enlargement of\r\nthe os uteri, which facilitates conception throughout the remainder of\r\nthe period of sexual maturity. This is well shown by the not infrequent\r\ncases in which sterility persists for several years after marriage, and\r\nthen, with or without artificial aid, the first pregnancy occurs;\r\nthereafter one child after another appears in rapid succession.\r\n\r\n_Spiegelberg_ has pointed out that cervical lacerations may give rise to\r\nsterility by interference with the incubation of the ovum. _Olshausen_\r\nmaintains that this affection is liable to cause abortion, for the\r\nreason that by the gaping of the cervical canal the inferior pole of the\r\novum is from time to time exposed, and this gives rise to reflex\r\ncontractions of the uterus.\r\n\r\n_Von Grünewaldt_ publishes figures in support of his opinion that\r\ndisturbances of the integrity of the uterus, whereby the implantation\r\nand further development of the ovum are interfered with, play on a whole\r\na greater part in the causation of sterility than the various conditions\r\npreviously described which interfere with contact of ovum and\r\nspermatozoon. But in this, we think, he goes too far.\r\n\r\nFinally, in this connexion, must be mentioned among the hindrances to\r\nfertilization, sexual excesses, such as are so common during the first\r\nweeks of married life. Too frequent coitus gives rise to enduring\r\ncongestion of the uterus, and hence to an irritable state of the uterine\r\nmucous membrane, whereby the implantation of the ovum is rendered\r\ndifficult. In prostitutes chronic metritis, due to the excessive\r\nfrequency of intercourse, may be a contributory cause of the sterility\r\nwhich is almost invariable in these women; doubtless, however, the\r\nprincipal cause of their sterility is gonorrhoeal perimetritis.\r\n\r\nAs a variety of the third kind of sterility, sterility due to incapacity\r\nfor implantation or further development of the ovum, must be classed the\r\ncases in which, though conception and implantation of the ovum are known\r\nto occur, and the first stages of development of the embryo certainly\r\ntake place, the woman proves incapable of giving birth to a viable\r\ninfant. Some of these cases depend upon abnormal modes of development,\r\nmyxoma of the chorion and the like. In rare cases, women abort every\r\nmonth, discharging every four weeks a fully developed decidua vera, in\r\nwhich sometimes no trace of ovum can be detected. But this monthly\r\nabortion ceases as soon as marital relations are interrupted.\r\n\r\nIt would be passing beyond the scope of this work to discuss the\r\npathological processes which lead to premature interruption of the\r\npregnancy, after conception, implantation of the ovum, and the first\r\nstages of development, have occurred in a normal manner; to discuss, in\r\nshort, the causes of abortion. Moreover, these pathological processes\r\nare outside the concept of sterility. It is sufficient here to enumerate\r\nthe principal conditions in which abortion occurs. They are: various\r\ntissue disorders of the uterus, chronic hyperaemia of the mucosa,\r\ndisplacement of the uterus with fixation, parametric and perimetric\r\nexudations, laceration of the cervix with ectropium; further, various\r\nconstitutional disorders, such as the specific fevers, acute infective\r\nprocesses, chronic circulatory disturbances consequent upon cardiac,\r\npulmonary, renal and hepatic disease, syphilis, anæmia, chlorosis,\r\ndiabetes, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Only-Child-Sterility._\r\n\r\nUntil recently, only-child-sterility had received attention in England\r\nonly, for the reason that it is comparatively common in that country;\r\nbut this form of relative sterility is by no means rare with us (in\r\nGermany and Austria) also. I had a collection made in Austria of the\r\nnumber of children resulting from 2000 fruitful unions, and found that\r\namong these there were 105 marriages in which one child only had been\r\nborn; thus the ratio of these marriages to those which proved fully\r\nfruitful was about 1 : 19. But the figures are untrustworthy, since\r\nabortions and deaths in infancy were not taken into account. _Ansell_\r\nfound that in England, among 1767 fruitful marriages in which the mean\r\nage of the wives at marriage had been 25, there were 131 cases of\r\nonly-child-sterility, giving a ratio of the latter to the fully fruitful\r\nunions of 1 : 13.\r\n\r\nThis form of relative sterility, in which the wife gives birth to one\r\nchild, and thereafter remains barren, was referred by _Matthews Duncan_,\r\neither to a premature exhaustion of the reproductive capacity, the\r\ngeneral bodily powers remaining unaffected, or else to a simultaneous\r\nweakening of the sexual powers and of the constitutional force in\r\ngeneral. This explanation is a very inadequate one. The significant fact\r\nupon which an understanding of the nature of only-child-sterility must\r\nbe based, is that the first delivery is the one which entails the\r\ngreatest dangers to the mother, and that the subsequent sterility is\r\nattributable to the difficult delivery, and to the illnesses that follow\r\nin its train. In fact, only-child-sterility is observed chiefly after\r\ndifficult deliveries, followed by long enduring inflammatory processes\r\nof the uterus and the uterine annexa, which seriously affect the woman’s\r\nreproductive capacity. It occurs especially in delicately organized,\r\nanæmic, scrofulous women, whose powers of resistance have been\r\nundermined by a single pregnancy and parturition. Finally, it is met\r\nwith in women suffering from myoma uteri, a form of tumour which beyond\r\nothers renders the recurrence of pregnancy difficult and unlikely. This\r\nform of sterility has been seen also in cases in which comparatively\r\nsoon after the birth of her first child, the mother has suffered from\r\ntyphoid, scarlatina, or some other severe infective fever, which appears\r\nin some way to interfere for the future with the development of normal\r\nova. We must also take into consideration the fact that at the time of\r\nthe wife’s first confinement, when the love which brought about the\r\nunion has often already begun to diminish in intensity, the husband,\r\nfinding too irksome the continence enforced upon him by his wife’s\r\ncondition, is not unlikely to go elsewhere for temporary sexual\r\ngratification, and to acquire a venereal disease, which he subsequently\r\ntransmits to his wife, and which is responsible for the latter’s future\r\nsterility. And we must not forget to take into account the adoption of\r\nmeans for the prevention of pregnancy after the first child has been\r\nborn. Again, I saw three cases of only-child-sterility in which the\r\nhusbands were respectively 24, 26, and 29 years older than their wives,\r\nand in these instances no profound search was needful for the discovery\r\nof the cause of the wife’s unfruitfulness; it was obvious that in each\r\ncase the elderly husband’s reproductive powers had sufficed for the\r\nprocreation of a single child, but had then been completely exhausted.\r\nMy experience in the mysteries of sterility in women has informed me of\r\nyet another cause of only-child-sterility, met with in cases in which\r\nthe only child was born after several years of unsuccessful marital\r\nintercourse. In most of these cases, the wife has finally been impelled\r\nto seek a substitute for her husband, whose reproductive powers have\r\nproved insufficient; having succeeded in obtaining the child she\r\ndesires, the wife does not again wander in strange pastures, and\r\nconsequently remains sterile.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Kleinwächter_—who gives a somewhat wider significance to\r\nthe term “only-child-sterility,” including as he does cases of premature\r\ninterruption of the first and only pregnancy, since these even more\r\nfrequently entail permanent sterilization—only-child-sterility is by no\r\nmeans rare. Among 1081 gynecological cases, he observed it in 90, that\r\nis, in 8.32% of the cases. In these 90 cases, there were 69 instances in\r\nwhich the sterility ensued upon full term delivery, and 21 instances in\r\nwhich it followed abortion or premature delivery. _Kleinwächter_,\r\nmoreover, on the basis of his personal experience, supports my view of\r\nthe importance of the sterilizing influence of the first delivery; but\r\nhe has been unable to determine whether early marriage has any influence\r\nin the production of only-child-sterility.\r\n\r\n_Lier_ and _Ascher_ also class as instances of only-child-sterility\r\nthose cases in which a woman has had a single miscarriage, and\r\nsubsequently remained sterile, since by this miscarriage the capacity of\r\nthe woman for impregnation has been proved, and the question of capacity\r\nfor full-term delivery has nothing to do with that of capacity for\r\nconception. As causes of this form of sterility, they lay especial\r\nstress upon puerperal infection, gonorrhoeal infection, perimetritis,\r\ntubo-ovarian tumours, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Operative Sterility._\r\n\r\nFinally, in order to complete the etiologically classified series of\r\nforms of sterility, we must allude to yet another variety of sterility\r\nwhich is due to the surgical direction of modern gynecology, viz.,\r\noperative sterility. However much we may prize the gains we owe to\r\nmodern operative gynecology, it cannot be denied that the new\r\ndevelopments have brought many evils in their train. Not the least of\r\nthese is operative sterility, due to operative procedures involving the\r\nfemale reproductive organs, by which, whether intentionally or\r\nunintentionally the reproductive capacity is destroyed. Doubtless, in\r\ncertain severe organic diseases of the female reproductive apparatus, in\r\nwhich the use of the knife is indicated, the fact that by operating we\r\nare sterilizing the patient cannot even be taken into consideration; but\r\nmany sins have been committed in this kind, and with a ready hand, and,\r\nbe it openly admitted, with an easy conscience, many an eager operator\r\nhas undertaken the destruction of a woman’s potentialities for\r\nmotherhood, without having given the careful consideration that is\r\ndemanded by the irreparable character of his undertaking. Happily,\r\nhowever, the time has nearly passed away, in which it could be said of\r\nmany a gynecologist, that no ovaries and no Fallopian tubes were safe\r\nfrom his operative zeal, and from his desire to heap up a mountain of\r\nstatistics.\r\n\r\nThree operative measures very commonly undertaken at the present day are\r\nresponsible for the production of operative sterility: ovariotomy,\r\noophorectomy, and salpingotomy.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the ovaries, with the object of permitting to the women\r\nconcerned unbridled sexual indulgence without risk of consequences, was\r\nperformed, according to _Strabo_, by the ancient Egyptians and Lydians.\r\nThe same practice is described by modern writers as occurring in\r\nHindustan (_Roberts_), and in Australia (_Miklucho-Mackay_).\r\n\r\nWith a curative aim, the removal of the ovaries was first undertaken in\r\nthe early years of the nineteenth century, although the operation had\r\nalready been discussed as a possibility by leading physicians of the\r\neighteenth century. The first ovariotomy for the removal of an ovarian\r\ntumour was performed by _MacDowell_ in the year 1809. During the last\r\nthree or four decades, the operation has become an extremely common one,\r\nand is performed by the surgeons of all nations. Removal of a single\r\novary, as long as the other ovary is healthy, does not necessarily lead\r\nto any impairment of fertility; but when both ovaries are removed,\r\noperative sterility is the necessary result. In order to avoid this,\r\n_Schröder_ has recommended that a fragment, at least, of healthy ovarian\r\ntissue should be left behind, in order to preserve the reproductive\r\ncapacity. In discussing the subject of impaired ovulation, we have\r\nalready mentioned cases in which pregnancy has occurred after bilateral\r\nremoval of the ovaries, a circumstance explicable only on one of two\r\nassumptions, either that a fragment of ovarian tissue was left behind,\r\nor else that a supernumerary ovary existed.\r\n\r\nThe extirpation of healthy ovaries, or at any rate, of ovaries which are\r\nnot notably enlarged, is known as oophorectomy (spaying, _Battey’s_\r\noperation, in Germany, castration). It dates from the year 1869\r\n(_Koeberlé_); but in the strictly modern sense the operation was first\r\nperformed by _Hegar_ in the year 1872. [_Lawson Tait_ removed both\r\novaries for pain in October, 1871. _Battey’s_ first operation of this\r\nkind was _successfully_ performed on August 17th, 1872; this was three\r\nweeks subsequent to the first performance of the operation by _Hegar_ of\r\nFreiburg. But _Hegar’s_ patient died from the operation, and _Hegar_ did\r\nnot publish the case at the time—Transl.] The aim of ovariotomy is to\r\nremove an ovarian cystoma; if the other, apparently healthy, ovary is\r\nremoved, it is with the object of removing an ovarian tumour in the\r\ninitial stage. Oophorectomy has an altogether different purpose, namely,\r\nto relieve or cure pathological manifestations in other organs which are\r\nbelieved to depend on the periodical recurrence of ovulation, to cure\r\nthem by instituting a premature menopause. At one period, when\r\noverzealous operators performed oophorectomy for the supposed relief of\r\ncomparatively unimportant nervous affections, and the statistics of the\r\noperation began to assume gigantic proportions, operative sterility\r\nactually came to play no inconspicuous part on the stage of sterility in\r\ngeneral. But a reaction inevitably followed; severe diseases were alone\r\nconsidered as furnishing sufficient indications for the operation; of\r\nlate it has been performed chiefly in cases in which the primary\r\ndisorder has already rendered the occurrence of pregnancy impossible, or\r\nat any rate very unlikely, or, finally, if probable, yet to be avoided,\r\non account of the dangers it would entail. In short, the fertility of\r\nwomen is no longer seriously threatened by this operation.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, I was consulted by a beautiful married woman, 26 years\r\nof age, of a blooming and healthy aspect. When a young girl, she had\r\nsuffered every month at the time of the menstrual flow from violent\r\nvomiting, accompanied by various spasmodic troubles. Just at this time,\r\noophorectomy was the fashionable operation for the relief of nervous\r\ntroubles; this girl was subjected to the operation, and the vomiting at\r\nthe periods ceased, but the other nervous symptoms persisted without\r\nalleviation—indeed were at times worse than before. Since then, she had\r\nmarried a man belonging to the upper circles of society; and now, after\r\nliving for four years in sterile wedlock, she came to me to ask my\r\nadvice as to whether anything could be done to enable her to have a\r\nchild! Two other cases have come within my own knowledge, in which women\r\nwhose ovaries had been removed on account of nervous troubles, had\r\nsubsequently married, and felt most unhappy owing to their hopeless\r\nstate of sterility.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to make even an approximate estimate of the number of\r\nwomen who in recent years have had their ovaries removed during the\r\nperiod of sexual maturity, and who have thus been made the subjects of\r\noperative sterility; nor is it possible to ascertain in what proportion\r\nof cases the healthy ovaries, the normal female reproductive glands,\r\nhave been removed for the problematical relief of nervous troubles or of\r\nuterine haemorrhage, and in what proportion of cases there has existed a\r\ngenuine indication, owing to the presence of fibromyoma of the uterus,\r\nfor the induction of an artificial and premature menopause.\r\nUnquestionably, the number of women thus operated on during the menacme\r\nis by no means a small one. In a work by _Hermes_, “On the Results of\r\nOophorectomy in Cases of Myoma of the Uterus,” _Archiv für Gynecologie_,\r\n1894, we find that, among 55 women whose ovaries were removed on account\r\nof myoma of the uterus, there were 52 who were between the ages of 21\r\nand 45, i. e., in the period of sexual maturity. The assumption that all\r\nthese patients were already sterile before the operation, on account of\r\na degenerate condition of the uterine annexa, cannot be justified.\r\n\r\n_Keppler_, indeed, puts forward a very remarkable defence of the removal\r\nof the ovaries of women who are competent to become mothers, asserting\r\nthat such oophorectomy offers no obstacle to marriage, and that many\r\nwomen who have been operated on in this manner are extremely happy in\r\nconjugal life. Marriage with a wife whose ovaries have been removed is\r\nthe ideal Malthusian marriage, the one way in which Malthusianism can be\r\npractised without endangering the health and life-happiness of the\r\nparticipators!\r\n\r\nAnother danger soon appeared, one which threatened the fertility of\r\nwomen to an even greater extent, in the form of operations on the\r\nuterine annexa—the first salpingotomy was performed by _Hegar_ in 1877.\r\nAs knowledge advanced of the various diseases of the Fallopian tubes,\r\nsalpingitis, hydrosalpinx, and pyosalpinx, whilst at the same time the\r\ndevelopment of the antiseptic method rendered operative gynecology\r\ncontinually bolder and bolder in its undertakings, there was disclosed\r\nan extensive field for radical measures in removal of the tubes,\r\ngenerally combined with removal of the ovaries, since these latter\r\norgans commonly were found to have suffered from association in the\r\ndestructive inflammatory process. The operation of salpingo-oophorectomy\r\nsoon became a very common one; and since patients with diseased tubes\r\nare for the most part still comparatively young, in the period of sexual\r\nmaturity, there arose a new and frequent variety of operative sterility,\r\nand one which the zeal of American gynecologists made especially common\r\non the other side of the Atlantic. An American gynecologist, indeed, has\r\nsarcastically observed that “It is the dish-full of excised tubes that\r\nshows the master gynecologist”; and _Landau_ has been impelled to lament\r\nthat “salpingotomy has been performed on a very large number of women\r\nwho have complained of nothing more serious than uterine haemorrhages,\r\nor of insignificant pains, and even on some women who have come to the\r\ngynecologist with no other complaint than that—they are sterile”!\r\n_Fritsch_, also, writing of the too rapidly formed diagnosis “tumor of\r\nthe annexa,” and the consequent resort to operation, remarks: “I know\r\nmany a happy mother who at one time had worn every variety of pessary,\r\nhad been through every kind of ‘cure,’ and had visited every accessible\r\nspa; until, at last, she came to consult me, with the express wish to\r\nhave her ovaries removed. Latterly, she had been advised to this course\r\nby every physician she had consulted. I agreed, in such cases, to\r\nperform the operation, with the stipulation that first of all, for the\r\nspace of an entire year, the patient should not see a single doctor,\r\nshould visit no spa, should take no medicine, and, in short, should pay\r\nno attention whatever to her health. The success of this course of\r\n‘treatment’ was often extraordinary. As soon as the reproductive organs\r\nwere left in peace, recovery ensued.” The conservative tendencies of the\r\nsurgery of the last decade, have manifested themselves also in the\r\ndepartment of gynecology, for the happy protection of woman and her\r\nreproductive capacity. Operative measures are now commonly restricted to\r\nthe relief of certain severe forms of disease of the uterine annexa; in\r\ncases of chronic inflammation of the annexa, the surgeon often contents\r\nhimself with dividing or breaking down the adhesions, and leaves the\r\norgans in situ; even in cases of bilateral disease, one tube only may be\r\nremoved; whilst in the most recent method of all, after opening the\r\nabdomen, and separating the pelvic organs from their adhesions, an\r\naperture is made in the closed tube, and this artificial ostium is\r\nbrought into apposition with the ovary by the insertion of sutures. In a\r\nword, surgeons have come to realize that they have in the past been too\r\nready to sterilize their patients by the performance of double\r\nsalpingo-oophorectomy, and are much more reluctant than formerly to\r\nsacrifice the ovaries and the Fallopian tubes.\r\n\r\n_Porro’s_ operation is another cause of operative sterility, excision of\r\nthe ovaries being combined with the partial excision of the uterus,\r\nwhereas sterility was seldom the consequence of the older method of\r\nCaesarian section. Indeed, _Porro’s_ operation has been extolled\r\nprecisely on this account, that, indicated as it is for the relief of\r\nextremely difficult labour, it renders it impossible for the same\r\ndifficulty and danger ever to recur.\r\n\r\nThe classical operation of Caesarian section, if the patient makes a\r\nfavourable recovery, does not involve sterility, unless in very\r\nexceptional cases (as in one described by _Lecluyse_, in which, after\r\nthe Caesarian section, a communication persisted between the uterine\r\ncavity and the cavity of the abdomen, through which the semen passed\r\nduring coitus). Occasionally, also, in performing the older operation,\r\nthe operator has thought it right to prevent the future recurrence of\r\npregnancy by adding an oophorectomy to the primary operation.\r\n\r\nPregnancy and parturition are still possible after the healing of\r\nspontaneous or traumatic ruptures of the uterus; but it must be\r\nremembered that after such serious injuries, as after extensive\r\noperative procedures on the pelvic organs, widespread peritoneal\r\ninflammation is apt to occur, with perimetritic and parametritic\r\nexudations, leading commonly to sterility.\r\n\r\nAmputation of the vaginal portion of the cervix, an operation sometimes\r\nundertaken for the relief of sterility in cases of hypertrophy of the\r\ncervix, may on the other hand lead to sterility in cases in which a\r\ncicatricial stenosis of the cervical canal results from the operation.\r\n\r\nBy the too frequent application of caustics to the cervical canal, or by\r\nthe employment of these agents in too powerful a form, occlusion of the\r\nos externum may be caused, or even adhesion of the opposing walls of the\r\nvagina just below the cervix, thus giving rise to sterility. Rough use,\r\nalso, of the uterine sound, and maladroit and violent gynecological\r\nmassage, have often enough been responsible for the occurrence of\r\nsterility, by giving rise to perimetritic inflammation. _Landau_\r\nenumerates among the causes of intrapelvic abscesses, “whereby the\r\nspecific functions of womanhood are nullified in consequence of\r\ndegeneration of the tubes or the ovaries,” “certain therapeutic\r\nprocedures,” and more especially, intra-uterine therapy, (the use of the\r\nsound, curettage, injections, cauterization), and operations on the\r\ncervix or the vagina, on which intrapelvic inflammation and even\r\nsuppuration has ensued. How easily pelvic peritonitis and its\r\nconsequences lead to sterility in women, has been shown many times in\r\nthe course of our exposition of this subject.\r\n\r\nFinally, we must class with operative sterility the result of surgical\r\nprocedure undertaken by gynecologists to save women, whose lives have\r\nalready been seriously threatened by pregnancy or parturition, from a\r\nrepetition of this experience. In such cases, _Blundell_ recommends\r\ndivision of the Fallopian tubes, having found from experiments upon\r\nrabbits that this is a safe and certain means for the prevention of\r\nconception. _Frorieps_ and _Kocks_ have both frequently brought about an\r\nartificial sterility in women by closure of the tubes, the first-named\r\nby cauterization with nitrate of silver—the caustic being attached to\r\nthe end of a piece of whalebone and introduced through a canula into the\r\nuterine orifice of the Fallopian tube—whilst _Kocks_ has constructed for\r\nthe same purpose a galvano-caustic uterine sound, which is only rendered\r\nred-hot by passage of the current after it has been introduced into the\r\nuterine ostium of the tube. Both these methods are in the first place\r\ntoo uncertain to be relied upon for the attainment of the desired end,\r\nand in the second place their employment appears to be neither easy, nor\r\nfree from danger.\r\n\r\nAs the importance of conservative methods of procedure becomes once more\r\nfully recognized in modern gynecology, cases of operative sterility will\r\nbecome ever more and more rare.\r\n\r\n\r\n            TABLE SHOWING THE CAUSES OF STERILITY IN WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n             I.

SEXUAL EPOCH OF THE MENOPAUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE MENOPAUSE.\r\n\r\nThat time in a woman’s life at which her sexual activities come to their\r\nnatural termination, marked by the cessation of menstruation, is known\r\nas the menopause, climax, or climacteric period.\r\n\r\nThis “change of life,” from a condition of sexual maturity to a\r\ncondition of quiescence of sexual functions, is not a sudden one, the\r\nsymptoms of sexual retrogression making their appearance gradually,\r\nuntil the cessation of the monthly recurring menstrual flow indicates\r\nthat the termination of sexual activity has arrived, and that sexual\r\ndeath is taking place.\r\n\r\nThe influence of this period of life is not manifested by the sexual\r\norgans alone—in these latter indeed various changes may be detected\r\nalready before the cessation of menstruation, whilst after that\r\ncessation, the atrophic changes characteristic of old age proceed in\r\nthese organs with a slow but continuous advance,—but the disturbances\r\nevoked by the climacteric involve the entire organism and affect the\r\nfunctions of numerous organs, giving rise to a true storm of irritant\r\nphenomena, and to manifestations of decay of manifold nature.\r\n\r\nThe stormy manifestations, the occurrence of which led the ancients to\r\ndenote this period as the “critical age” of a woman’s life, are in the\r\nfirst place due to changes in the ovaries; the tissue changes in these\r\norgans give rise to a powerful ovarian stimulus, which, by irradiation\r\nand reflex action, leads to the occurrence of a number of nervous\r\ndisturbances, vasomotor manifestations, and circulatory disorders;\r\nwhilst owing to the cessation of the internal secretions of the ovaries,\r\nnumerous and intense pathological disorders of metabolism arise. These\r\nvarious symptoms become apparent at the very outset of the menopause,\r\nwhen the oncoming entire cessation of menstruation is already\r\nforeshadowed by irregularity in the periods, gradual diminution in the\r\nquantity of the flow, and variations in the number of days during which\r\nthe flow on each occasion persists.\r\n\r\nThe manifestations of the menopause are in fact so striking, that from\r\nancient times down to the present day a widespread belief has prevailed\r\nthat especial danger to a woman’s life is threatened by the climacteric\r\nage. The statistics available on this subject are, however, of dubious\r\nsignificance. Although it cannot be denied that the changes in the\r\nentire organism which attend the extinction of sexual activity, bring\r\nnumerous dangerous influences into play, yet I feel bound to maintain\r\nthat these dangers are by no means so great as those which are involved\r\nby the sexual life in its ripest period of development—the dangers of\r\npregnancy, parturition, and the puerperium.\r\n\r\nIt is often asserted that in this “critical period” of the menopause,\r\nthe mortality of the female sex is notably increased. The data available\r\nare somewhat conflicting, but a careful examination leads us to believe\r\nthat, if due allowance is made for the natural increase in mortality\r\nwith advancing years, no important increase in the mortality of women\r\ncan be traced as due to the troubles and disturbances of the climacteric\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe age at which a woman’s last sexual epoch begins is a very variable\r\none. The duration of the “change of life,” the length of time during\r\nwhich the occurrence of the “change” is manifested by local and general\r\ndisturbances, also varies greatly. Not less variable are the intensity\r\nand the general distribution of the symptoms which mark the climacteric.\r\n\r\nThe external configuration of woman at the climacteric age is usually\r\ncharacterized by signs of over-ripeness, and these changes appear to\r\nexercise upon certain men—more especially very young men—a peculiar kind\r\nof erotic stimulus. Many women remain long at this period quite fresh\r\nlooking, with a vivid, youthful colouring; others, however, early\r\nmanifest alterations in their finer feminine characteristics, hairs, for\r\ninstance sprouting on the chin, and the voice becoming deeper in tone.\r\n\r\nThe outward characters of senescence, with withering of the tissues, are\r\nnot commonly manifested at this time, but first make their appearance in\r\nlater years, after the completion of the menopause.\r\n\r\nA tendency to the excessive accumulation of fatty tissue is one of the\r\nmost distinctive characteristics of the menopause, varying, however,\r\ngreatly in degree according to race, family predisposition, and\r\nnutritive conditions. The dominant tone is thus given to the physical\r\nconfiguration by the deposit of fat. The face comes to have a rounded,\r\nspherical appearance, the eyes looking smaller in proportion, whilst the\r\nfurrows and folds which form the natural boundaries between the features\r\nbecome indistinct. The formation of the “double chin,” and the abundant\r\ndeposit of fatty tissue in the supraclavicular region, gives to these\r\nextremely obese women an appearance of such a shortening of the neck,\r\nthat head and thorax seem to be connected as it were by a great mass of\r\nfat, marked by furrows in the thyroid and sub-hyoid regions. The breasts\r\nsometimes attain an enormous size, hanging down to the gastric and even\r\nto the umbilical region. The abdomen is greatly enlarged, the fat in the\r\nanterior abdominal wall projecting more especially in the hypogastric\r\nregion, hanging down in two or three horizontal rolls over the tops of\r\nthe thighs, and pushing the mons veneris downwards, so that this latter\r\nitself projects over the genital fissure. The posterior projection of\r\nthe buttocks is also greatly increased, until they form a huge elastic\r\ncushion, of which the sensual orientals, who regard obesity in women as\r\na beauty, poetically write: “Her face is like the full moon, and her\r\nbuttocks are like two pillows.” Occasionally, so huge a mass of fat\r\nforms beneath the tuberosity of the ischium, that the configuration of\r\nthe nates reminds us of the well-known _steatopyga_ or fat-rump of the\r\nHottentot and Bosjesman women. In the genital organs, as already\r\nmentioned, the genital fissure is hidden by the projection of the mons\r\nveneris. The labia majora are also greatly enlarged by the deposit of\r\nfat, so that they look like two great cylinders lying side by side.\r\nAnother way in which the characteristic sexual beauty is often lost in\r\nextremely obese women, is by the falling out of the pubic hair.\r\n\r\n_Moreau_, in his work on _The Natural History of Woman_, describes the\r\nchanges occurring in a woman at the climacteric in similar terms, and\r\nconcludes: “The only elements of a woman’s beauty that may sometimes be\r\nsaved from the wreck, to persist for a shorter or longer time after the\r\nclimacteric, are, the abundance of her hair, the vivacity of her glance,\r\nand sometimes also the amiable expression of her countenance; gradually,\r\nhowever, even these last remnants of beauty disappear, and old age takes\r\npossession with its irresistible force.”\r\n\r\nNone the less, some women may preserve substantial elements of beauty\r\nfor a long time after the menopause. A classical example of this fact is\r\nfurnished by _Ninon de l’Enclos_. When she died, at the age of 90, she\r\nwas still beautiful. At the age of 65 she aroused the passionate love of\r\na young man, who, unfortunately, was her own son. When informed of this,\r\nhe committed suicide. A young abbé fell in love with her when she was 75\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nThe psychical life of woman is profoundly affected by the stormy\r\nphysical changes of the climacteric. Not merely does a woman entertain\r\nthe disturbing thought that the critical age has begun, bringing in its\r\ntrain certain dreaded dangers to her health and even her life, but she\r\nis further depressed by the consciousness that she is about to lose her\r\nfeminine attractions, and to decline in sexual esteem, and that her\r\nreproductive capacity is now to be extinguished. She realizes vividly\r\nthat the beautiful past, the loving and beloved womanhood, is now to be\r\nleft behind for ever, and by this an intelligent and sensitive woman\r\ncannot fail to be profoundly affected. Her feelings at this time were\r\nnever more characteristically expressed than by the Frenchwoman who said\r\n“Autrefois quand j’étais femme.” If, indeed, a woman has been so\r\nfortunate as to have made a happy marriage, to have borne healthy\r\nchildren, and to be living a satisfactory family life, she will be\r\nenabled to bear with comparative equanimity the disappearance of her\r\nsexual life; but it is different with the childless wife and with the\r\nunmarried woman, who, at the onset of the climacteric, must bury all\r\ntheir sexual aspirations, and who see the remainder of their lives\r\nstretch before them without hopes for the future. The psychical\r\npredisposition and the intellectual education of the woman concerned,\r\nwill now determine whether she will bear the onset of the menopause with\r\ncomposure and resignation, or whether she will become a prey to\r\nmelancholia. Women of the former kind will seek to find employment for\r\nthe powers set free by their sexual non-activity, in services of\r\nneighbourly affection, in works of benevolence, and in the performance\r\nof social duties; women less happily endowed will display their\r\nhostility to the world in ill-nature, scandal-mongering, and intrigue,\r\nthus giving vent to their inward bitterness; whilst those, finally, with\r\nhereditary predisposition to nervous degeneration, will become the prey\r\nof veritable psychoses.\r\n\r\nA by no means rare result of the excited fantasy and of the eager desire\r\nnot to grow old, is displayed at the climacteric in the form of\r\nself-deception. The women thus affected cannot understand, and cannot be\r\nmade to believe, that the cessation of menstruation is the natural sign\r\nof their sexual decadence, they trick themselves into believing that in\r\ntheir case it is a sign that they have become pregnant. We must not\r\nindeed forget that the enlargement of the abdomen, so common at the\r\ncommencement of the climacteric, in association with the unexpected\r\nfailure of the menstrual flow to appear, the frequent dyspeptic\r\ntroubles, and the enlargement of the breasts in consequence of the\r\ndeposit of fat in these organs, often enough lead to appearance which\r\nhave a deceptive resemblance to the clinical picture of early pregnancy.\r\nThe mistake is the more readily made because the breasts sometimes\r\nsecrete a serous fluid, whilst sacrache is not infrequent, and\r\nperistaltic movements of the intestines are mistaken for the movements\r\nof the foetus. Cases of this kind, in which all the objective signs of\r\npregnancy appear to be present, and in which it is impossible to\r\nconvince the woman that she has been deceiving herself, and that all the\r\nsigns and symptoms are due to the menopause, are mentioned already by\r\nvery early writers, and have been frequently reported by modern\r\ngynecologists. (An example of spurious pregnancy especially familiar to\r\nEnglish readers is that of Mary I, Queen of England. Transl.)\r\n\r\nSexual desire in woman by no means reaches its physiological term with\r\nthe climacteric and the cessation of menstruation. On the contrary, we\r\nhave observed it to be the rule that shortly before and at the\r\ncommencement of the climacteric, there is a considerable increase in the\r\nlibido sexualis, and at the same time an increase in sexual sensibility\r\nduring coitus. This sexual erethism makes its appearance in a manner\r\noften extremely surprising to the husband—and especially surprising in\r\nthe case of women who have previously been characterized by a certain\r\nfrigidity in sexual matters, and who have, perhaps, always needed strong\r\npersuasion before they would consent to perform their marital duties. It\r\nis by no means rare for the increased sexual impulse to manifest itself\r\nin some pathological form. Even some time after the menopause, when\r\nsenile changes in the genital organs are far advanced, the sexual\r\nimpulse may still be remarkably active. There is an interesting analogy\r\nin the fact that _Glaevecke_ observed that the sexual impulse was\r\npersistent in women in whom an artificial menopause had been induced by\r\noophorectomy; and that _Lawson Tait_ and _L. Smith_ have reported cases\r\nin which dyspareunia, which had existed prior to the operation, passed\r\naway after the removal of the ovaries, so that after the artificial\r\nmenopause, voluptas coeundi for the first time made its appearance.\r\nOther authors, _Goodell_, for instance, report that libido sexualis is\r\nretained only for a short time after oophorectomy, but subsequently\r\ndisappears, as in the course of the physiological menopause, and that at\r\nthe same time the voluptas coeundi is entirely extinguished.\r\n\r\nWhen the menopause is fully established, and the processes of involution\r\nin the reproductive organs have taken place in a normal manner, the\r\nwoman has had time to acquiesce in the inevitableness of the changes\r\nthat have occurred, and she often attains a state of emotional repose\r\nwhich was quite unknown to her in the earlier phases of her sexual life.\r\nMore particularly, those women who hitherto during menstruation, and for\r\nsome days before and after the flow, have been the prey of numerous\r\nnervous symptoms and troubles, rejoice, after the menopause, at their\r\nnew-won freedom from these pains and disquiets, at their delivery from\r\nthe excitements of the reproductive system, at their now uninterrupted\r\nstate of well-being.\r\n\r\nI once saw a group of statuary by _Pietro Balestra_, entitled “Time\r\ncarries off Beauty.” A beautiful woman was striving in vain to resist\r\nthe overwhelming might of Chronos, whilst Cupid, about to be abandoned,\r\nwas standing sorrowfully by. Here we have a symbolic representation of\r\nthe sexual epoch of the menopause.\r\n\r\nIn a recently published romance, “_Les Demi-Vieilles_,” _Yvette\r\nGuilbert_ has described in a manner most true to nature the feelings of\r\nthe “Half-Old,” the mental condition of women at the climacteric, “They\r\nendeavour to remain young, to hide their defects, they seek once again\r\nthe intoxication of love. But that which aforetime in hours of\r\ndepression they have foreseen, now becomes a dreadful reality. When the\r\nlemon has been squeezed dry, the skin is thrown away.”\r\n\r\nSooner or later after the completion of the menopause, the signs of\r\nsenile marasmus become apparent. The soft, feminine configuration of the\r\nface disappears, the features become coarser, approaching the masculine\r\ntype, hairs appear on the upper lip and on the chin. The voice becomes\r\ndeeper and harsher. As decrepitude begins, the breasts wither, a change\r\nthat occurs sooner in proportion to the degree in which their functions\r\nhave been in previous years exercised by suckling; but also sometimes\r\nafter a life of complete sexual inactivity. Even in cases in which the\r\nloss of substance of the breasts is apparently small, the glandular\r\ntissue of the organs has really disappeared, and has been replaced by\r\nfat. In advanced age, the breasts become quite small, wrinkled, flaccid,\r\nand dependent, and sometimes atrophied to become mere cutaneous folds.\r\nThe nipples project more prominently, they are darker in colour, and\r\ntheir surface is wrinkled. In the genital organs, the fat disappears\r\nfrom the mons veneris, which becomes flattened, whilst the pubic hair\r\nceases to be curly, and much or all of it is ultimately shed. The labia\r\nmajora become thin and flaccid, until they are mere empty folds of skin;\r\nthey are widely separated, so that the vaginal orifice is closed only by\r\nthe withered nymphæ, until these latter are themselves ultimately\r\nindicated by mere traces.\r\n\r\nWhere the menopause has been artificially induced, the signs of\r\nsenescence do not appear immediately after the removal of the ovaries;\r\ntheir development is a very gradual one. The sexually mature woman, from\r\nwhom these tokens of femininity have been removed, experiences at first\r\nlittle change in external configuration, beyond a somewhat exaggerated\r\ntendency to the deposit of fat; the other changes described do not\r\nusually set in until the physiological climacteric age is attained. A\r\nfew cases only have been observed in which after oophorectomy a rapid\r\nchange to the masculine configuration has been observed.\r\n\r\nSeldom if ever does it happen that menstruation suddenly ceases without\r\nany notable constitutional disturbance, so that in a moment, as it were,\r\nthe menopause is effected, without any period of transition. Rarely,\r\neven, do we meet with cases in which the peculiar manifestations\r\nforeshadowing or accompanying the cessation of menstruation last for no\r\nmore than a few weeks. Most commonly the irregularities of the menstrual\r\nfunction (of which the most noteworthy characteristic has hitherto been\r\nits extreme regularity), and the associated symptoms of the climacteric\r\nperiod, endure for months, and occasionally for years. According to my\r\nown observations, the mean duration of the climacteric manifestations is\r\nfrom two to three years, the limits of variation in individual cases\r\nbeing, however, exceedingly wide.\r\n\r\nThe manifestations which accompany the cessation of menstruation are as\r\na rule the following: The woman is for some months in an irritable\r\ncondition, complains of digestive disturbances, constipation, meteorism,\r\nepistaxis, haemorrhoidal flux, congestions of the head, increasing\r\nfugitive sensations of heat (Ger. _fliegende Hitze_), and a tendency to\r\nprofuse perspiration.\r\n\r\nThe length of the intermenstrual interval commonly increases, to as much\r\nas six or eight weeks; the flow itself becomes scantier. In other cases,\r\nhowever, the flow becomes much more abundant, and the intermenstrual\r\nintervals much shorter than normal. In some cases, the regularity of the\r\nflow is altogether lost, it appears now soon, now late, and is now\r\nscanty, now profuse. Sometimes the intervals are several months, it may\r\nbe 6, 8, and even 10 months, then again the flow will occur every two or\r\nthree weeks; in exceptional cases, a scanty flow persists right through\r\nwhat should be the interval, so that menstruation becomes continuous,\r\nwith periodic increases in the flow. Not infrequently, after a sudden\r\ncessation of the flow lasting for many months, menstruation recurs, and\r\ncontinues at regular intervals for a long time, until the final\r\ncessation of menstrual activity.\r\n\r\nThe mode of cessation which is most favourable to a woman’s general\r\nhealth, is for the duration of the intermenstrual interval gradually to\r\nincrease, whilst pari passu with this increase, the amount of the flow\r\nprogressively decreases, until it ceases altogether. In such cases, the\r\ngeneral constitutional disturbance is reduced to a minimum. On the other\r\nhand, the _sudden_ cessation of menstruation gives rise to profound\r\ndisturbance of the domestic economy of the feminine organism, and causes\r\nviolent changes therein. But even the gradual cessation of menstruation\r\ncauses notable disturbance of the woman’s mental and physical\r\nequilibrium, if the irregularities in the menstrual process are very\r\ngreat and spread over a very long period—more especially when the loss\r\nof blood is extensive.\r\n\r\nEven after the menopause, after the final termination of the flow, there\r\npersists a more or less regular recurrence of certain symptoms referable\r\nto the continuance of ovulation. Sacrache, a sense of abdominal tension,\r\na feeling of heat and fullness in the pelvis, dragging pain in the\r\nhypogastrium, and general irritability, occur at intervals, so that the\r\nwoman thus affected sometimes describes herself as suffering from the\r\ncontinuance of a “bloodless menstruation.”\r\n\r\n_Tilt_ made observations in 637 women, in order to ascertain the various\r\nmodes in which the menopause occurs, and obtained the following results.\r\nThe menopause occurred:\r\n\r\n By gradual diminution of the amount of\r\n   the flow                             in 171 women, or 26.84 per cent.\r\n By sudden interruption of the flow     in  94 women, or 14.76 per cent.\r\n By sudden interruption and a terminal\r\n   attack of metrorrhagia               in  43 women, or  6.75 per cent.\r\n By a terminal attack of metrorrhagia   in  82 women, or 12.87 per cent.\r\n By a series of attacks of metrorrhagia in  56 women, or  8.79 per cent.\r\n By alternations of very profuse and\r\n   very scanty menstruation             in  36 women, or  5.65 per cent.\r\n By irregular recurrence of\r\n   menstruation, at intervals exceeding\r\n   21 days                              in  99 women, or 15.54 per cent.\r\n By irregular recurrence of\r\n   menstruation, at intervals of less\r\n   than 21 days                         in  33 women, or  5.18 per cent.\r\n By irregular recurrence of\r\n   menstruation, the intervals being\r\n   sometimes longer and sometimes\r\n   shorter than 21 days                 in  23 women, or  3.61 per cent.\r\n                                           ———           —————\r\n                 Totals                    637           99.99\r\n\r\nThe two principal dangers of the climacteric period in women are, first,\r\nthe great tendency to profuse uterine haemorrhages, and, secondly, the\r\nliability to the occurrence of malignant tumours, more especially to\r\ncarcinomatous disease of the ovaries, the uterus, and the mammae.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the question whether, in any particular individual, the\r\ncourse of the menopause is likely to be favourable or unfavourable,\r\nthere are, in my experience, four considerations of principal prognostic\r\nsignificance: the condition of the woman during the menarche, the state\r\nof the general health at the time of commencement of the menopause, the\r\ndegree to which the sexual functions have been and are being exercised,\r\nand the manner in which the cessation of menstruation takes place.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the disturbances and pathological states of the climacteric\r\nperiod will be especially frequent and severe in women whose sexual\r\ndevelopment at the time of the menarche was accompanied by severe\r\ndisturbances of the general condition. In every individual, there\r\nappears to be a certain connexion between the manifestations attending\r\nthe menarche and those attending the menopause, of such a nature that\r\naccording as puberty has been passed through with little or with much\r\ndisturbance of the general condition, a similar favourable or\r\nunfavourable course of the menopause may be prognosticated. If, at the\r\ntime of the menarche, there were severe nervous manifestations, or heart\r\ntroubles of a serious kind, the passage of the menopause may be expected\r\nto give rise to neuropathic affections and to cardiac disturbances in a\r\nsimilar manner.\r\n\r\nThe woman’s state of general health is likewise of importance in\r\ndetermining whether the course of the menopause will be favourable or\r\nunfavourable. Perfectly healthy women, with a quiescent temperament, and\r\nin favourable circumstances of life, will pass most easily through the\r\nclimacteric period without disturbance of their general condition. Every\r\ndeparture from normal health has an unfavourable influence upon the\r\ncourse of the climacteric. In women of a plethoric habit of body, there\r\nis an especial tendency at this time to the occurrence of symptoms of\r\nstasis and hyperaemia. Chlorotic and anæmic women are more prone than\r\nothers to suffer at the time of the menopause from uterine haemorrhages.\r\nWomen of a sanguino-erethistic constitutional disposition often manifest\r\nat this epoch a tendency to neuroses and psychoses. Those women have the\r\nbest prospect of a smooth and undisturbed passage through the\r\nclimacteric age, who enter upon it in a state of perfect health. Less\r\nfavourable is the prognosis in the case of those women who already some\r\ntime before the climax, at the outset of the fourth decade of their\r\nlives, have begun to complain of severe haemorrhages and various other\r\npathological states.\r\n\r\nRegarding the influence which the sexual activity of a woman during the\r\nmenacme exercises upon the course of the climacteric, it may be said,\r\ngenerally speaking, that a previous free exercise of the sexual\r\nfunctions in normal conditions has a favourable influence upon the state\r\nof health during the menopause. Women who have been married for many\r\nyears, who have had many children, and who have suckled these children,\r\npass through the changes of the climacteric much more easily than old\r\nmaids, than women who have lived for many years in continent widowhood,\r\nor than women who have had very few children or none at all. The\r\npractice of prohibitive coitus, i. e., the use during intercourse of\r\nmethods of preventing the occurrence of conception, a form of sexual\r\nimmorality which has become extraordinarily common during the last few\r\ndecades, has an unfavourable influence upon the course of the\r\nclimacteric. Unfavourable, also, is the effect of great sexual activity\r\nduring the four or five years immediately preceding the menopause. Women\r\nwho marry shortly before the commencement of the climacteric, and those\r\nwho have given birth to a child shortly before this time, commonly\r\nexperience very severe disturbances during the menopause. Prostitutes\r\nwho continue the active pursuit of their profession until the\r\nclimacteric age, have at this time much to suffer. Women who have had\r\ndifficult deliveries, or several miscarriages, or severe puerperal\r\nillnesses—and indeed, speaking generally, those women who have been\r\nsubject to any kind of disease of the reproductive organs—are apt to\r\nsuffer from serious disturbances of the general health during the\r\nclimacteric period.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which the cessation of menstruation takes place, is also\r\ncausally connected with the easy or difficult course of the menopause.\r\nPremature cessation of menstruation, or very sudden interruption of this\r\nfunction, has a deleterious effect, manifesting itself both by local\r\ndisorders of the reproductive organs, and by general disturbances in the\r\nnervous system and in the circulatory organs. On the other hand, a late\r\nmenopause and a gradual cessation of menstruation, are both usually\r\naccompanied by a favourable course of the climacteric phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe influence of sexual activity upon the course of the climacteric is\r\ndescribed by _Busch_ in the following terms: “Women who have led an\r\nexhausting mode of life, who have had intercourse too frequently, those\r\nwho have been given to onanism or to some other sexual irregularity, and\r\nwho therefore enter upon the menopause with flaccid and deteriorated\r\nreproductive organs, are liable to haemorrhagic and mucous fluxes, to\r\nprolapse, carcinoma, dropsies, enlargements, and suppurative processes.\r\nWomen, on the other hand, who have lived a life of strict isolation, and\r\nwho have forcibly repressed all sexual inclinations, frequently suffer\r\nfrom ossifications, indurations, and atrophic conditions of the\r\nreproductive organs, and also from neoplasmata.”\r\n\r\nAfter an artificial menopause, induced by the operative removal of the\r\novaries, similar manifestations occur to those witnessed during the\r\nnatural menopause. Similar disturbances and troubles occur in both\r\ncases, but in the artificial menopause they are commonly more severe\r\nthan in the natural; they last also for a longer time, varying usually\r\nfrom three to six years; moreover, in the artificial menopause, as in\r\nthe natural, the disturbance of health is more severe and lasts longer\r\nin proportion to the youth of the individual. Further, in the artificial\r\nmenopause also, the intensity and the duration of the climacteric\r\nmanifestations are influenced by the constitutional state and by the\r\ncondition of the genital organs at the time when the operation is\r\nperformed. We note, moreover, that, just as in the physiological\r\nmenopause, the attendant troubles are most violent in the initial\r\nperiod, and then gradually subside, so also after the induction of an\r\nartificial menopause by the removal of the ovaries, the resultant\r\ndisturbances rapidly increase in severity, to attain their maximum in\r\nfrom three to six months, and then, after lasting for a year or so, they\r\ngradually become less severe, until they are ultimately extinguished.\r\n\r\nThe extensive process of transformation which goes on in a woman’s\r\nsystem during this period of the sexual life, from the very first\r\ndiminution in ovarian activity to the complete extinction of the\r\nreproductive functions, manifests itself throughout the organism by\r\nmeans of a series of changes which can for the most part be referred\r\neither to states of blood-stasis and their consequences—congestion of\r\nvarious organs, haemorrhages, and disorders of secretion—or else to\r\nperversions of nervous function.\r\n\r\nThe most manifold symptoms of disordered circulation may occur:\r\nhyperaemic states of the central nervous system, flushings of the face,\r\nthe so-called fugitive heats (Ger. _fliegende Hitze_), a tendency to\r\nepistaxis, to haemorrhoidal flux, and to profuse perspiration. The\r\nchanges which take place in the reproductive organs at the time of the\r\nmenopause give rise to venous engorgement and to collateral congestions.\r\nSuch a condition of venous hyperaemia may occur in the gastric and the\r\nintestinal mucous membrane, giving rise to various dyspeptic\r\nmanifestations, and at times, when severe, even to actual gastric and\r\nintestinal catarrh. Hyperaemia of the liver may also arise. In this\r\ncase, the pressure of the distended bloodvessels on the biliary ducts\r\nmay interfere with the outflow of the bile, and thus give rise to a\r\nslight icterus. Further, the intra-abdominal venous congestion leads to\r\noverfilling of the haemorrhoidal veins, and hence to bleeding piles.\r\n\r\nWhen the congestion is long-lasting, various further morbid changes may\r\narise, pulmonary hyperaemia may eventuate in bronchitis, hyperaemia of\r\nthe cerebral meninges may cause very severe headache, there may be\r\nsyncopal attacks, tinnitus aurium, choroidal congestion, impaired\r\nvision, etc.\r\n\r\nCongestion of a more active nature arises from an increased and usually\r\naccelerated flow of blood through the vessels of a part in which the\r\nresistance to the blood stream has been lowered proportionately to its\r\npropulsive force. In this way arises that characteristic symptom of the\r\nmenopause known as ardor fugax—fugitive heat—one link in the long chain\r\nof vasomotor manifestations occurring at this period of life. Fugitive\r\nheats are commonly most clearly marked in the face, head, and neck, in\r\nwhich region there suddenly occurs a reddening of the skin, with diffuse\r\nand increasing subjective sensation of heat. At the same time there is\r\noften a sense of tension, as if the part were about to burst. Actual\r\nslight swelling may be noticed, the eyes sparkle and are somewhat\r\nprominent, the head feels heavy, stupid, and dizzy. Sometimes these\r\nsymptoms last for a considerable time; at other times they terminate\r\nspeedily and suddenly with a local perspiration or with an attack of\r\nepistaxis. Not infrequently, after lasting a short time in one region,\r\nthey pass away as rapidly as they came, but are immediately succeeded by\r\na similar attack in some other part of the body, or by vasomotor\r\nphenomena of a slightly different kind. Thus, such a flushing and heat\r\nof the face may be replaced by a sudden sense of heat in the small of\r\nthe back or in the sacral region, by pruritus of the extremities, by\r\npalpitation of heart, or by an attack of pseud-angina.\r\n\r\nA further consequence of active hyperaemia is the onset of those\r\nconfused states, so common in the climacteric age, of mental and bodily\r\ndisquiet, which find expression, now in states of excitement, and now in\r\nstates of depression. So we often observe change of disposition,\r\nassociated with incapacity for regular work, whilst sleep is restless,\r\nand much disturbed by dreams; and again states of dizziness, a sense of\r\nmental uneasiness and confusion, and even actual delirium.\r\n\r\nIn the skin, in addition to the fugitive heats, we often have a peculiar\r\npricking, itching, or stabbing sensation, and various kinds of\r\nhyperaesthesia, frequently associated with disturbances of tactile\r\nsensation. We observe also muscular twitchings, and general weakness of\r\nthe organs of locomotion.\r\n\r\nIn association with the passive and active hyperaemias of the menopause,\r\nwe frequently see increase or some qualitative change in the various\r\nsecretions. Above all, these changes affect the various secretions of\r\nthe different reproductive organs, but we have also increased intestinal\r\nsecretion, leading to diarrhoea, increased excretion of urinary\r\ndeposits, and increased secretion by the skin. Symptoms which are common\r\nat the menarche, and frequently recurs at the menopause, are: headache,\r\nmigraine, a state of pseudo-narcotism, slight hysterical attacks,\r\nindications of moral insanity, lumbo-abdominal neuralgias, neuralgia of\r\nthe breasts, leucorrhoea, and various skin eruptions.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Tilt_, the changes occurring in the organism at the\r\nclimacteric period may be summarized under the following heads:\r\n\r\n  1. Increased elimination of carbonic acid by the lungs,\r\n\r\n  2. Increased elimination of uric acid in the urine,\r\n\r\n  3. Increased perspiration,\r\n\r\n  4. Increased mucous flux,\r\n\r\n  5. Haemorrhages from various organs.\r\n\r\nAs regards the first point, the extensive researches of _Andral_ and\r\n_Gavaret_ have shown that in the female sex the quantity of carbonic\r\nacid eliminated by the lungs diminishes when menstruation first appears\r\nat puberty, but increases again at the climacteric age, when\r\nmenstruation ceases—whereas in the male a gradual diminution in the\r\nelimination of carbonic acid begins already in the 36th year of life; in\r\nold age the quantity eliminated is greatly reduced in both sexes alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n      CHANGES IN THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS AT THE MENOPAUSE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 84.—Sagittal section through the ovary of a girl aged 16.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn considering the changes that take place in the female reproductive\r\norgans at this period of life, we must distinguish between the proper\r\nperiod of the _climacteric_, with its various manifestations antecedent\r\nto and associated with the irregularity and ultimate cessation of\r\nmenstruation, from the condition of _old age_ in which menstruation has\r\nactually and completely ceased, in which the menopause has been fully\r\naccomplished, and in which the changes of senescence have set in at once\r\nin the organs of the reproductive system and in the organism as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe most important and most significant changes of this sexual epoch are\r\nunquestionably the anatomical alterations in the ovaries. A good many\r\nyears ago I undertook an investigation whose purpose was to follow the\r\nnatural involution of the graafian follicles from the time of the climax\r\non into old age, and for this purpose I examined a very large number of\r\novaries of women at ages varying from 42 to 75 years (Archiv. für\r\nGynecologie, Bd, XII., Heft 3).\r\n\r\nThroughout these years a slow but continuously progressive atrophy\r\nproceeds in the ovaries; they become smaller and denser, diminishing\r\nespecially in height and width; their surface becomes extremely uneven;\r\nand in extreme old age they wither away until no more is left in the\r\nregion formerly occupied by the ovaries than a flattened fibro-vascular\r\nthickening (Figs. 84–88). The histological characteristic of the changes\r\nin the ovary which proceed gradually from the commencement of the\r\nmenopause to extreme old age, may be summed up as consisting in a\r\ncontinual increase and new formation of the connective tissue stroma at\r\nthe expense of the cellular layer, accompanied by retrogressive\r\nmetamorphosis of the graafian follicles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 85.—Sagittal section through the ovary of a woman aged 72 years.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe connective tissue ground substance of the ovary increases from the\r\nperiphery towards the centre, and progressively compresses the\r\nepithelial structures of the organ. In the outermost layer of the\r\novarian stroma, the so-called tunica albuginea, the strata of short,\r\ndense connective tissue fibres increase notably in number, so that\r\nwhereas at first three layers at most could be distinguished, the tunic\r\nultimately comes to consist of from six to eight layers; at the same\r\ntime also the interior ovarian stroma becomes exceedingly dense, so that\r\nnumerous well-defined interlacing bundles of fibres can be made out in\r\nits substance.\r\n\r\nThe first retrogressive metamorphosis which can be observed in the\r\ngraafian follicles is fatty degeneration, the formation of granule\r\nspheres. Whilst the membrana propria (the theca folliculi) of the\r\nfollicle remains quite unaltered, we observe in the membrana granulosa,\r\nin addition to the ovum, and the ordinary cells of this layer, spherical\r\naggregates of fat droplets, the granule spheres, which continually\r\nincrease in size, until ultimately of the cellular contents of the\r\nfollicle nothing whatever remains, and it now appears full of granule\r\nspheres and fluid. The theca folliculi has now lost its spherical shape,\r\nand assumes an ovid form (Fig. 89).\r\n\r\nIn a later stage of the degeneration of the graafian follicle, it\r\nappears as a vesicular body with a relaxed wall, thrown into numerous\r\nfolds, this folded wall being formed by the theca folliculi. The cavity\r\nof the follicle is reduced to a mere cleft, filled with a transparent\r\nsubstance, and the space between this cleft and the inner surface of the\r\ntheca folliculi is occupied by round cells and a fibrous intercellular\r\nsubstance, and is traversed by a vascular network. This second stage of\r\nthe retrogression of the follicle may therefore be designated the stage\r\nof vesicular degeneration (Fig. 90).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 86.—Diagrammatic representation of the Graafian Follicle.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 87.—Ovary of a girl aged 19 years. (Normal size.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 88.—Ovary of a woman 72 years of age. (Normal size.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the last stage of this retrogressive metamorphosis, we find the\r\nfollicle completely transformed to a fibrous mass. It appears as an\r\nelongated oval body, much lobulated, connected with the surrounding\r\nstroma by thick strands of fibres; a trace of the original cavity can\r\nstill be distinguished in the form of a narrow cleft, without\r\ndistinguishable contents. The tissue of this body consists of connective\r\ntissue fibres, with interspersed nuclei and nuclear fibres (Fig. 91).\r\n\r\nThe three stages I have observed in the retrogression of the follicle,\r\nof which I have given a summary account above, may, I think, be\r\nexplained in the following manner: When the woman’s reproductive\r\nactivity ceases, the graafian follicles become subject to a\r\nretrogressive metamorphosis, a fatty degeneration setting in in the\r\ncells of the membrana granulosa and in the ovum, until ultimately the\r\nwhole of the granular epithelium has undergone atrophy. The follicle now\r\nundergoes a vesicular transformation with shrinkage of its cavity, and\r\nwith the formation of a new tissue which appears to be young connective\r\ntissue. As time goes on, this new connective tissue is formed in\r\nincreasing quantities, until finally the entire follicle is transformed\r\ninto a firm fibrous mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 89.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThus we are led to infer that the gradual but extensive thickening of\r\nthe tunica albuginea (i. e., the outer, condensed layer of the ovarian\r\nstroma), which, as we have seen, always occurs at the climacteric\r\nperiod, offers a hindrance to the bursting of the follicles as they\r\nmature, and in this we find the explanation of the irregularity of\r\nmenstruation and of the various troubles which attend the performance of\r\nthat function at the time of the menopause. It is reasonable to assume\r\nthat the resistance of this thickened tunica albuginea is responsible\r\nfor the fact that the interval between the bursting of the successive\r\nfollicles is now greater than normal, as much as six or eight weeks—this\r\nretardation of menstruation being one of the commonest ways in which the\r\nonset of the menopause is first manifested. Another phenomenon connected\r\nwith the onset of the menopause also finds a plausible explanation in\r\nthe anatomical grounds just mentioned. As already pointed out, in parous\r\nwomen the menopause sets in later than in nulliparae. At every\r\npregnancy, the ovaries share in the more abundant nutrition of all the\r\nreproductive organs, due to the general dilatation of the intrapelvic\r\nvessels which accompanies this process; hence the ovaries become larger,\r\nricher in lymph, and therefore softer, the cellular elements increase in\r\nsize, and perhaps also in number, and it is readily conceivable that in\r\nsuch ovaries the cellular elements are able for a longer time to resist\r\nthe induration and the new formation of connective tissue which occur at\r\nthe climacteric.\r\n\r\nThe numerous nervous disturbances of the climacteric epoch would appear\r\nalso to depend upon the hyperplasia of the ovarian stroma which we have\r\nobserved to be the characteristic anatomical change in the ovaries at\r\nthis period of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 90.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAssociated with the fibrous transformation of the graafian follicles\r\nthere is, however, a failure of the so-called internal secretion of the\r\novaries, a matter to which much attention has recently been paid.\r\n_Brown-Séquard_ has especially maintained that the ovaries secrete a\r\nsubstance which enters the blood, a substance which, notwithstanding the\r\nfact that its presence cannot be proved either by chemical or any other\r\nmeans known to us, yet is of considerable importance for the maintenance\r\nof the equilibrium of mental and physical well-being. It is supposed\r\nthat the various profound disturbances of the general system occurring\r\nat the menopause[52] are dependent upon the cessation of this internal\r\nsecretion of the ovary—disturbances which rise to a maximum as the\r\natrophy of the ovary proceeds, and which only gradually pass away after\r\na considerable lapse of time.\r\n\r\nAfter the menopause is completely over, in the ovaries, as in other\r\nparts of the female reproductive organs, the signs of senile\r\ndegeneration make their appearance.\r\n\r\nIn old women, we find the ovaries either shrunken to the form of small\r\nfibrous cords, or else degenerated to form cysts of smaller or larger\r\nsize, the stroma surrounding these cysts being extremely hard, dense,\r\nand tough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 91.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 92.—Sagittal section through the Cervix of a woman 26 years of\r\n    age. Dendriform branched Glands.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 93.—Sagittal section through the Cervix of a woman 65 years of\r\n    age. Glands which have undergone Cystic Degeneration.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 94.—Cervix of a woman 70 years of age. The Cervical glands have\r\n    undergone Cystic Degeneration.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhereas at the commencement of the climacteric period, the uterus\r\ncommonly exhibits a slight increase in size, owing to the condition of\r\npassive hyperaemia already described, subsequently a gradual diminution\r\nin the size of the organ may be observed. This atrophy begins with the\r\nportio vaginalis and proceeds upwards. Whilst the body still appears\r\nundiminished in size, the vaginal portion will be found already shorter,\r\nmore slender, and more flaccid. Gradually, however, the entire organ is\r\ninvolved in the atrophic process. The uterus is then smaller than\r\nformerly, its walls are thinner, its cavity reduced in size. Its\r\nvascularity and its sensibility are alike diminished. The external os is\r\nsmaller, and the internal os is sometimes entirely obliterated. There is\r\na tendency at the climacteric period for the tubulo-racemose glands of\r\nthe cervical mucous membrane (Fig. 92) to undergo a cystic degeneration\r\n(Fig. 93), and hence arise the cysts which are so commonly met with on\r\nthe portio vaginalis of women at this time of life, cysts varying in\r\nsize from that of a millet seed to that of a pea. In advanced life, the\r\nformation of such cysts may be regarded as normal, and sometimes in the\r\nform of grape-like clusters they almost completely occupy the lumen of\r\nthe cervical canal. (Figs. 94, 95, 96, and 97).\r\n\r\nNot infrequently, these cysts lead to the formation of polypi, by\r\nenlarging until the mucous membrane projects so far that a stalk is\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nExamining the bodies of 47 women who died at ages varying from 42 to 80\r\nyears, I found in 28 ovula Nabothi in the cervical mucous membrane, for\r\nthe most part at the os uteri externum, but in some cases also extending\r\nup to the os internum, sometimes between the plicae palmatae, sometimes\r\nisolated, sometimes grouped.\r\n\r\nSometimes in old women no trace of a vaginal portion remains, and the\r\nuterus is found to be transformed to a small, thin-walled, shrunken\r\nbody, no more than one-fourth of its original size; in such cases the\r\nsaying of Graaf appears to be justified, that after the menopause the\r\nuterus returns to the size it has in the young girl. In the majority of\r\nsuch cases, the cavity of the uterus is also contracted (concentric\r\natrophy). It sometimes happens, however, that in old age the os externum\r\nand the os internum are the seat of atresia, whilst the intermediate\r\nportion of the cervical canal remains unaffected. In this way,\r\nespecially when the cervical canal and the cavity of the body of the\r\nuterus are distended with mucus or with fungous growths, is produced\r\nwhat is known as the _uterus bicameratus vetularum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 95.—Ovula Nabothi in the Portio Vaginalis.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn many cases, when the cervical canal has been obliterated, we find the\r\nuterine cavity distended with mucous secretion (excentric atrophy). The\r\nsubstance of the uterine wall is in old age commonly dense and tough,\r\nbut occasionally, in extreme old age, less firm than formerly, withered\r\nand friable, and traversed by degenerated arteries, and in this state it\r\nis predisposed to haemorrhages (apoplexia uteri). Such intramural\r\nhaemorrhages usually occur in the fundus; the friable uterine substance\r\nhas then a blackish-red appearance, infarcted with extravasated blood;\r\nsometimes the uterine cavity is also filled with blood. In general it\r\nmay be said that when the menopause is completely over, when uterine\r\nactivity has entirely ceased, the uterus returns to the state in which\r\nit was before the menarche—it is physiologically dead.\r\n\r\nThe tubes become flaccid, thinner, shorter, and are at times\r\nobliterated. In the mucous membrane of the tubes in old women we no\r\nlonger find any trace of the glands described by Hennig; the epithelial\r\ncells have also lost their cilia.\r\n\r\nDuring the climacteric period, the vagina is usually relaxed and roomy,\r\nthe mucous membrane is smooth, injected and secretes freely;\r\nsubsequently, in old age, it becomes firm, tough and dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 96.—Vesicle (Ovula Nabothi) from the Uterine Mucous Membrane.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Wendeler_ found that the initial change of the climacteric in the ovary\r\nis a chronic and progressive endarteritis obliterans; the result of this\r\nprocess is, in addition to the obliteration of the follicles, a\r\ncontinually increasing hyaline degeneration of the smallest arteries and\r\nthe arterioles, especially along the line of transition between the\r\ncortical and the medullary substance of the organ; this degeneration\r\nextends to the surrounding connective tissue, and thus leads to the\r\nformation of peculiar, vitreous, translucent foci of sclerotic\r\nconnective tissue, containing few cells or none; these are the so-called\r\n_corpora fibrosa_ or _corpora albicantia_. Only subsequently to the\r\nformation of these bodies does the characteristic wrinkling of the\r\nsurface of the ovary occur, with general shrinkage of the organ, these\r\nchanges being due to the contraction that sets in in the numerous\r\nscattered foci of connective tissue, which, as already mentioned, are\r\nsituated in close proximity to the cortex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 97.—Mucous glands undergoing Cystic Degeneration.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe gradual atrophy of the uterus after the extinction of its sexual\r\nactivity leads to a diminution in all the diameters of the organ, so\r\nthat in old women it becomes flattened as in childhood, all its curves\r\nhaving disappeared; the muscular substance is replaced by connective\r\ntissue; and the portio vaginalis dwindles and even entirely disappears.\r\n\r\nAs regards the bacterial flora of the genital organs of elderly women,\r\n_Menge_ and _Koenig_ find that the vagina for the most part contains\r\nbacteria which do not thrive when cultivated aërobically on alkaline\r\nagar plates. In exceptional cases, however, such bacteria are found, and\r\nmay even be sufficiently vigorous to produce pyogenic infection.\r\nAccording to _Strogamoff_, the vagina in all circumstances contains a\r\ngreat variety of micro-organisms—cocci, diplococci and rod-forms.\r\nRod-forms are the prevailing types found in normal conditions in elderly\r\nwomen, but they are much smaller than in women who are still in the\r\nperiod of reproductive activity. Organisms liquefying gelatine were\r\nfound in one instance only, a case of vaginal prolapse. In one half of\r\nthe cases examined, there was no development of culture media inoculated\r\nfrom the cervix uteri, whether on agar or gelatine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE TIME OF THE MENOPAUSE.\r\n\r\nThe age at which the menopause begins is one which varies owing to\r\nmanifold conditions, congenital and acquired, owing to the local\r\ninfluences which have been brought to bear on the reproductive organs\r\nduring the menacme, and to the general circumstances of life during this\r\nperiod. In Northern Europe it commonly begins some time between the ages\r\nof 40 and 50 years. According to the most trustworthy statistical data,\r\nthe commonest age for the onset of the menopause is between the ages of\r\n45 and 50 years. Next to these in frequency we find the menopause\r\ncommencing between the ages of 40 and 45 years. If, however, the\r\nmenopause does not begin during the fifth decennium, it is more apt to\r\noccur during the quinquennium after 50 than during the quinquennium\r\npreceding 40 years of age; that is to say, an abnormally late menopause\r\nis more often met with than an abnormally early menopause. In a very\r\nsmall proportion of women does the menopause begin either after the age\r\nof 55 or before the age of 35.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE AGE AT WHICH THE MENOPAUSE OCCURS.\r\n\r\nMy own observations show that the age at which the menopause begins is\r\naffected by the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n1. The race (nationality) of the woman.\r\n\r\n2. The age at which the menarche occurred.\r\n\r\n3. The sexual activity of the woman during the period of the menacme,\r\nthe number of her pregnancies, the exercise or neglect of the function\r\nof lactation.\r\n\r\n4. The social circumstances of the woman’s life.\r\n\r\n5. General constitutional and pathological conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _1. Race._\r\n\r\nFrom the statistical data regarding the age at which the menopause\r\noccurs among the women of the various nations of Northern Europe, it\r\nappears that the latest average age for the cessation of menstruation is\r\nmet with in Lapland, namely 49.4 years; next comes Norway, where the\r\naverage age is 48.9; next Germany, where the average age is 47; next\r\nEngland, 46.1; next Russia, 44; and finally Austria, 42.2. In the four\r\nprincipal capital cities, the average age is: in London, 45.5; in Paris,\r\n43.65; in Vienna, 43, and in Berlin, 47. Generally speaking, in southern\r\ncountries the cessation of menstruation occurs at an earlier age than in\r\nnorthern countries, as the following comparison shows: northern\r\ncountries: England (Tilt), 48 to 50; France (Courty), 50; North Germany\r\n(Mayer), 50; Austria (Szukits), 42; southern counties: Persia (Chardin),\r\n27; Java, 30; various Asiatic races, 30 to 40.\r\n\r\nIn the case of 500 women of various nationalities in whom I was able to\r\nascertain by personal observation the age at which menstruation ceased,\r\nI found that the menopause occurred:\r\n\r\n               In the quinquennium 35 to 40 in  48 women\r\n               In the quinquennium 40 to 45 in 141 women\r\n               In the quinquennium 45 to 50 in 177 women\r\n               In the quinquennium 50 to 55 in  89 women\r\n                                               ———\r\n                                               455\r\n\r\nThus we see that in about one tenth of my cases, menstruation ceased\r\nbetween the ages of 35 and 40; in more than one-fourth, between the ages\r\nof 40 and 45; in more than one-third between the ages of 45 and 50; and\r\nin about one-sixth between the ages of 50 and 55. In 267, that is, in\r\nmore than one-half of the 500, menstruation ceased between the ages of\r\n42 and 51. In 28 women, menstruation ceased before the age of 35; and in\r\n17, after the age of 55. In a very large majority of my 500 cases the\r\nwomen were of German or Austro-Hungarian nationality; next, in order of\r\nfrequency, came Poles, Russians, women of various southern countries,\r\nSwedish women. In women of Slavonic nationality, menstruation ceased\r\nremarkably late as compared with women of German nationality.\r\n\r\n_Brierre de Boismont_, _Tilt_, _Courty_, and various other observers,\r\nhave published statistical data regarding the age at which menstruation\r\nceases in women of different nationalities. _Krieger_, compiling from\r\nseveral authors, statistics relating to 2291 women (European) gives the\r\nfollowing average results: menstruation ceased\r\n\r\n      Between the ages of 35 and 40 in  272 women 11.87 per cent.\r\n      Between the ages of 40 and 45 in  595 women 25.97 per cent.\r\n      Between the ages of 45 and 50 in  940 women 41.03 per cent.\r\n      Between the ages of 50 and 55 in  334 women 14.58 per cent.\r\n      Before 35 and after 55 in         150 women  6.54 per cent.\r\n                                       ————       —————\r\n                                       2291       99.99\r\n\r\nWe append a statistical table showing the average age at which\r\nmenstruation ceases in women of different European nationalities:\r\n\r\n ══════════════╤════════╤════════════════╤════════╤═════════\r\n               │Germany.│Austria-Hungary.│ France │ England\r\n               │        │                │(Paris).│(London).\r\n ──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼────────┼─────────\r\n Number of     │     824│             256│     178│      500\r\n   cases       │        │                │        │\r\n Average age at│        │                │        │\r\n   the         │    47.0│            42.2│    44.0│     46.1\r\n   cessation of│        │                │        │\r\n   menstruation│        │                │        │\r\n               │        │                │Brierre │\r\n Observer      │ Magar  │    Szukits     │   de   │  Tilt\r\n               │        │                │Boismont│\r\n ══════════════╧════════╧════════════════╧════════╧═════════\r\n\r\n ══════════════╤═══════╤════════╤═══════╤════════\r\n               │Russia.│Denmark.│Norway.│Lapland.\r\n               │       │        │       │\r\n ──────────────┼───────┼────────┼───────┼────────\r\n Number of     │    100│     312│    391│      34\r\n   cases       │       │        │       │\r\n Average age at│       │        │       │\r\n   the         │   45.9│    44.8│   48.9│    49.4\r\n   cessation of│       │        │       │\r\n   menstruation│       │        │       │\r\n               │       │        │ Faye  │\r\n Observer      │Lieven │Hannover│  and  │  Vogt\r\n               │       │        │ Vogt  │\r\n ══════════════╧═══════╧════════╧═══════╧════════\r\n\r\n\r\n              _2. The Age at Which the Menarche Occurred._\r\n\r\nUntil recently, it was generally believed that the earlier the age at\r\nwhich menstruation first made its appearance, the earlier also would the\r\nmenopause occur; and that, on the other hand, the later the age at which\r\nthe flow began, the later also would it cease. _Virey_ summarized this\r\nopinion in the saying: prius pubescentes prius senescunt. This view of\r\nthe matter is, however, true only in respect of the influence of climate\r\nupon sexual development. In a cold climate, a woman begins to menstruate\r\nlate and ceases to menstruate late; in a hot climate the opposite\r\nconditions prevail. But if we make our comparison between women living\r\nin similar conditions as regards latitude and climate, we find that\r\n_Virey’s_ saying is far from accurately describing the facts.\r\n\r\nIn general, and climatic influences apart, it may be said that the\r\nearlier in any woman the age at which menstruation first occurs, the\r\nlater will be the age at which menstruation ceases.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the influence of the age at the menarche upon the\r\ndisappearance of menstrual activity, I placed in comparison first the\r\ncases of 50 women in whom menstruation had first appeared between the\r\nages of 12 and 16—i. e., cases of early menarche; and secondly the cases\r\nof 50 women in whom menstruation had begun between the ages of 16 and\r\n20—i. e., cases of late menarche. The result was the following:\r\n\r\nIn the 50 women in whom the menarche had been early, the menopause\r\noccurred\r\n\r\n                    At ages 35 to 40 in  5 instances\r\n                    At ages 40 to 45 in 12 instances\r\n                    At ages 45 to 50 in 25 instances\r\n                    At ages 50 to 55 in  8 instances\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the 50 women in whom the menarche had been late,\r\nthe menopause occurred\r\n\r\n                    At ages 35 to 40 in  9 instances\r\n                    At ages 40 to 45 in 28 instances\r\n                    At ages 45 to 50 in 10 instances\r\n                    At ages 50 to 55 in  3 instances\r\n\r\nThus whilst among the women in whom the menarche had been late, there\r\nwere thirteen only who continued to menstruate until they were at least\r\n45 years of age; among those in whom the menarche had been early, the\r\nnumber in whom menstruation thus continued up to the age of 45 or beyond\r\nwas 33, nearly three times as great.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in those cases in which the menarche occurred at an\r\n_abnormally_ early age, i. e., before the age of 12 years, the menopause\r\nwas also a remarkably early one. The menopause also came on very early\r\nin women in whom the menarche had been extremely retarded, until the age\r\nof 20 and upwards. An extremely early and an extremely late menarche\r\nalike tend to be followed by a premature menopause.\r\n\r\nTo this rule there are, however, exceptions, and we occasionally meet\r\nwith women whose reproductive energies are so powerful, that the\r\nmenarche occurs at an unusually early age, and the menopause is\r\npostponed to an age considerably beyond the average. Thus, among 100\r\nwomen in the _Salpetrière_, _Raciborski_ observed 29 in whom\r\nmenstruation had begun at the exceptionally early age of 12 years, and\r\nwho, notwithstanding this, all experienced a very late menopause. Three\r\nof them were still menstruating at the age of 57, 1 at 56, 2 at 52, 2 at\r\n50, 3 at 48, 3 at 45, and 13 at an age less than 45.\r\n\r\n_Brierre de Boismont_ reports the case of a woman who began to\r\nmenstruate in her 12th year; she married, had several children, and\r\ncontinued to menstruate regularly until she was 60 years of age.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by _W. Guy_, who examined a series of 250 cases,\r\nconfirm the proposition stated above, that the earlier menstruation\r\nbegins (the extremely early cases being excluded), the later it ceases.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Cohnstein_, who bases his conclusions upon the observation\r\nof 400 cases, in women who begin to menstruate early, the menopause\r\noccurs on an average three years later, than in women who begin to\r\nmenstruate late. _Puech_ also states that menstruation lasts longer in\r\nwomen who begin to menstruate early, than in those who begin to\r\nmenstruate late. According to _Scanzoni_, in women who begin to\r\nmenstruate in _very_ early youth, the climacteric age is commonly\r\nreached earlier, than in those in whom puberty occurs at the normal\r\nage—commonly between the ages of 40 and 42 years.\r\n\r\nThe homology between the pathological states which, in any particular\r\nindividual, occur at the respective periods of the menarche and the\r\nmenopause, is sometimes extremely remarkable; the very same symptoms by\r\nwhich the first appearance of menstruation was preceded, recur as\r\nantecedents of the menopause. This is seen in the case of certain\r\neczematous conditions of the skin, of dyspeptic manifestations,\r\nepistaxis, nervous disturbances, hysterical and epileptic seizures,\r\nvasomotor symptoms, congestions, cardiac troubles, albuminuria, etc.\r\n_Alibert_ pointed out that certain skin-diseases may appear twice only\r\nduring life, once shortly before the commencement of menstruation, and\r\nthe second time shortly before the cessation of menstrual activity.\r\n_Brierre de Boismont_ alludes to the occurrence of hysteria and epilepsy\r\nbefore both these important epochs in a woman’s life, whilst in the\r\nintervening period the patient had remained entirely free from such\r\ntroubles. _H. Marsh_ records the observation that women who just before\r\npuberty have suffered from repeated attacks of epistaxis, have suffered\r\nfrom the same trouble as a predominant symptom of the climacteric\r\nperiod. _Tilt_ has seen in several cases the outbreak of numerous\r\nfuruncles with subsequent diarrhoea, and still more frequently peculiar\r\nattacks of severe vertigo, occurring in women just before the two\r\ncritical epochs in her life, whilst in the intervening period there has\r\nbeen no trace of such troubles, either in connexion with menstruation,\r\nwith the puerperium, or with lactation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _3. The Woman’s Sexual Activity._\r\n\r\nAn important influence upon the early or late onset of the menopause is\r\nexerted by the degree to which a woman’s reproductive functions have\r\nbeen exercised during the menarche. My personal observations have shown\r\nme that in women who are in good health and of a powerful build, whose\r\nmenstrual flow has always been regular and sufficient in quantity, whose\r\nreproductive organs have been adequately and properly exercised, who\r\nhave had a physiological amount of sexual intercourse, have given birth\r\nto several children, and have suckled these children, the cessation of\r\nthe menstrual flow generally occurs much later than in women in whom the\r\nconditions of the sexual life have been the opposite of those just\r\nmentioned. The more regular menstruation has been, and the more normal\r\nthe deliveries, the later does the menopause ensue.\r\n\r\nEspecially striking is the influence of the number of deliveries upon\r\nthe time of occurrence of the menopause. In women who have given birth\r\nto a number of children, menstruation as a rule continues for several\r\nyears later than in sterile women, or in those who have had one or two\r\nchildren only. If a woman suckles her children, the date of the\r\nmenopause appears also to be postponed. Deliveries late in life seem\r\nlikewise to delay the onset of the menopause, whereas abortions\r\naccelerate its occurrence. If, however, pregnancy succeeds pregnancy at\r\nextremely short intervals, the menopause is likely to occur early; the\r\nsame result is brought about by sexual intercourse at too early an age.\r\nThe menopause occurs latest in women who have begun to menstruate early,\r\nwho have married, have given birth to more than three children, and have\r\nbeen delivered of their last child at full term when 38 to 42 years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nAs regards the 500 women previously mentioned, in whom I made personal\r\nobservation as to the age at which the menopause occurred and the\r\ncircumstances by which its onset was influenced, the effect of marriage\r\nand the number of children born is shown by the following details:\r\n\r\nOf the 48 women in whom the menopause occurred between the ages of 35\r\nand 40, 16 were unmarried, 6 married and childless, 18 married with one\r\nor two children, 8 married with more than two children.\r\n\r\nOf the 141 women in whom the menopause occurred between the ages of 40\r\nand 45, 3 were unmarried, 4 married and childless, 46 married with one\r\nor two children, 88 married with more than two children.\r\n\r\nOf the 177 women in whom the menopause occurred between the ages of 45\r\nand 50, 1 was unmarried, 2 were married and childless, 32 married with\r\none or two children, 142 married with more than two children.\r\n\r\nOf the 89 in whom the menopause occurred between the ages of 50 and 55,\r\nnone were unmarried, none were childless, 19 were married with one or\r\ntwo children, 70 were married with more than two children.\r\n\r\nOf the 17 women in whom the menopause occurred at an age above 55 years,\r\nthere were two only who had not had more than two children, whilst there\r\nwere 10 who had had six to eight children.\r\n\r\nThe influence of lactation is shown by the fact that in the case of 40\r\nwomen who had not suckled their children, the mean duration of menstrual\r\nactivity was four years less than the established mean duration of 27\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _4. The Social Circumstances of the Woman’s Life._\r\n\r\nThe conditions in which a woman passes her life are not without\r\ninfluence upon the time of onset of the menopause. In general it may be\r\nsaid that among the women of the labouring classes, whose livelihood is\r\nso often precarious, and who are apt to suffer from habitual physical\r\noverwork, menstruation ceases at an earlier age than among the women of\r\nthe well-to-do classes and those who lead an easier life. But though the\r\nclimacteric thus occurs earlier among the lower than among the upper\r\nclasses, the difference is not a considerable one.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Mayer’s_ calculation, the mean age at which menstruation\r\nceases is, in upper class women, 47.13 years, in lower class women,\r\n46.97 years. Small as this difference appears, amounting on the average\r\nto no more than two months, it must not be forgotten that among the\r\nupper classes, menstruation begins earlier than among the lower classes,\r\nby an amount which averages 1.31 years. Thus the total duration of\r\nsexual activity is almost one and a half years longer in the upper than\r\nin the lower classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _5. General Constitutional and Pathological Conditions._\r\n\r\nAn important influence upon the time of occurrence of the menopause is\r\nexerted by the individual and hereditary predisposition of the woman, by\r\nher constitutional state, and by certain illnesses from which she has\r\nsuffered. Women who by inheritance are constitutionally weakly and\r\ndelicate, in whom the menstrual flow has always been pale and scanty, in\r\nwhom the intermenstrual intervals have been excessive, and who have a\r\nslender habit of body, attain the climacteric age earlier than women\r\nwith vigorous bodily development and powerful muscles, with large\r\nbreasts, and in whom menstruation has always been regular and abundant.\r\nWomen with a great tendency to obesity cease to menstruate earlier than\r\nwomen of more normal proportions; blondes earlier than brunettes; women\r\nof phlegmatic temperament earlier than women of a sanguine and ardent\r\ntemperament.\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said, that all influences which have a weakening\r\neffect upon the feminine organism, tend also to accelerate the onset of\r\nthe menopause: such are, severe labour, great sorrow, wearisome\r\noccupations, severe menstrual losses, rapidly succeeding pregnancies,\r\nand abortions; also a number of pathological general states shortly to\r\nbe discussed, as well as local diseases of the reproductive organs.\r\n\r\n_Fritsch_ points out that menstruation continues to a later age in\r\nproportion as the woman’s state of general nutrition is a good one. He\r\nalso asserts that women with a very large uterus, who have always had an\r\nabundant menstrual flow, those with retroflexion, with hypertrophy of\r\nthe portio vaginalis, or chronic endocervicitis and endometritis, and\r\nthose with small myomata which have given rise to no marked symptoms,\r\noften continue to menstruate far beyond the usual age.\r\n\r\nThe mean duration of the climacteric phenomena, from the commencement of\r\nthese until the final cessation of menstruation, is about two years.\r\nThis mean is made up of extremely wide individual variations; in a small\r\nproportion of the cases the climacteric manifestations may last no more\r\nthan a month or two, whilst at the other end of the scale we meet with\r\ncases in which the duration extends to 4, 6, 8, and even 18 years.\r\n\r\nIn considerably more than half of all the cases, however, the duration\r\nof the climacteric manifestations varies between six months and three\r\nyears. Thus, in _Tilt’s_ series of cases, the duration of the “change of\r\nlife” was\r\n\r\n                     6 months in 12.07 of all cases\r\n                     1 year in   22.64 of all cases\r\n                     2 years in  18.62 of all cases\r\n                     3 years in   9.43 of all cases\r\n\r\n\r\n       _6. Premature, Delayed and Sudden Onset of the Menopause._\r\n\r\nIn exceptional cases, the menopause, instead of taking place between the\r\nfortieth and the fiftieth year of life, occurs at an abnormally early or\r\nan abnormally late age.\r\n\r\nPremature cessation of menstrual activity, in the third or the fourth\r\ndecennium of life—very rarely indeed before the third decade—depends in\r\npart upon disturbances of metabolism and of haematopoiesis, and in part\r\nupon diseases of the female reproductive organs; in some cases, however,\r\nit may be due to some hereditary constitutional peculiarity; or it may\r\noccur suddenly, in consequence of some violent shock to the nervous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nAmong the disorders of metabolism which may lead to a premature\r\nmenopause, excessive adiposity, lipomatosis universalis, occupies the\r\nfirst place. Next in order of importance come a chloro-anæmic condition\r\nof the blood, pernicious anæmia, splenic leukaemia, certain of the acute\r\ninfectious disorders—typhoid, cholera, scarlatina, acute articular\r\nrheumatism,—further pulmonary tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, Graves’\r\ndisease, Addison’s disease, and myxoedema. These various conditions may\r\ngive rise, in part by infective processes, and in part in consequence of\r\nthe general cachectic condition, to atrophy of the ovaries with\r\ndestruction of the graafian follicles, and to atrophic processes in the\r\nuterus, and these changes lead to the premature cessation of menstrual\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nExcessive obesity has a restrictive influence upon ovarian activity,\r\nmanifested in part, as already mentioned, by the occurrence of\r\nsterility, but in part also, in very obese women, by the onset of a\r\npremature menopause. Among 215 cases of extreme obesity in women, I\r\nfound 49 in which the menopause occurred at a remarkably early age. In\r\nthese cases the menopause occurred at the following age:\r\n\r\n                In  1 woman at the age of 17 years\r\n                In 14 women at the age of 20 to 25 years\r\n                In 11 women at the age of 25 to 30 years\r\n                In  9 women at the age of 30 to 35 years\r\n                In 14 women at the age of 35 to 40 years\r\n\r\nIn none of these cases did the local examination of the reproductive\r\norgans disclose the existence of any noteworthy disease.\r\n\r\nOf the diseases of the genital organs which are competent to give rise\r\nto a premature cessation of menstrual activity, the most important are\r\nthe puerperal infective processes and other inflammatory states of the\r\nreproductive organs, with their results—chronic metritis, perimetritic\r\nand parametritic exudations, chronic oophoritis, atrophy of the uterus\r\nand the ovaries.\r\n\r\nAfter infective puerperal processes, it sometimes happens that there is\r\nfar-reaching destruction of the uterine musculature, degeneration of the\r\nuterine mucosa, permanent and irreparable atrophy of the uterus, and\r\nsuppuration and atrophy of the ovaries—conditions which result in an\r\nextinction of menstrual activity. A similar result may ensue upon the\r\npersistent and long-continued pressure upon the uterus and the ovaries\r\nof a large intrapelvic exudation; such exudation being commonly\r\npost-puerperal, but occasionally arising in the absence of pregnancy.\r\nFurther, according to _Freund_, chronic atrophic parametritis may give\r\nrise to an incurable atrophy of the uterus, by interference with the\r\ncirculation of the blood through the broad ligaments, and consequent\r\nimpairment of the nutrition of the uterus. Gonorrhoeal inflammation may\r\nalso lead to the termination of menstrual activity, when it gives rise\r\nto intramural inflammatory deposits in the uterus, and to chronic\r\ninflammatory processes in the ovaries. Tumours of the uterus and the\r\nuterine annexa may likewise induce a premature menopause.\r\n\r\nWe also meet with cases in which after a pregnancy, to all appearance\r\nnormal in its course and termination, a premature menopause results. To\r\nthis category belong the cases, according to _Kleinwächter_ of no\r\nextreme rarity, in which perfectly healthy women are attacked by profuse\r\nuterine haemorrhage during the course of a normal, full-term labour, or\r\nduring miscarriage; subsequently, though the lying-in period is passed\r\nwithout further misadventure or abnormality, and in the absence of\r\nlactation, the patient becomes permanently amenorrhoeic. The normal\r\ninvolution of the uterus passes on into hyperinvolution, and ultimately\r\ncomplete atrophy of uterus and ovaries results. In some cases, moreover,\r\nsuch hyperinvolution with consecutive atrophy follows normal labour or\r\nabortion without the occurrence of any excessive haemorrhage.\r\n\r\nMuch more frequently do we find that rapidly successive pregnancies,\r\nwith long-continued exercise of the lacteal function, in badly\r\nnourished, anæmic women, give rise to a premature menopause, due to\r\npermanent atrophy of the uterus and ovaries, which are in such cases so\r\npoorly supplied with blood. This “lactationatrophy” is described by\r\n_Frommel_ and _Thorn_ as a concentric atrophy first of all affecting the\r\ncorpus uteri, and to this, if the disease advances, there succeeds a\r\ngeneral atrophy of the muscular, connective, and fatty tissues of the\r\nparametrium, the vagina, the pelvic floor, and ultimately of the\r\novaries, leading, when permanent, to a premature menopause.\r\n\r\nTrauma of the genital organs may also lead to uterine atrophy and to\r\npremature menopause.\r\n\r\nBy many authors it is believed that too-early marriage, sexual excesses,\r\nand prostitution, may be the cause of cessatio praecox. In some cases,\r\nthere is unquestionably a hereditary predisposition to a premature\r\nclimacteric, since the mothers of the women in whom it occurs have\r\nthemselves been similarly affected. In the remarkable case which came\r\nunder my own observation, of a woman from Smyrna, there was hereditary\r\npredisposition. This woman began to menstruate when 12 years of age;\r\nmenstruation was always scanty; she married when 15 years of age; and\r\nshe ceased to menstruate for ever at the age of 19. In other cases we\r\nfind there is a family tendency for menstruation to be delayed in its\r\nfirst appearance to a comparatively advanced age, and to cease at the\r\nusual time.\r\n\r\nIn cases of cessatio mensium praecox (unless the failure of menstruation\r\nhas been quite a sudden one), and after the premature menopause is fully\r\nestablished, we find in the uterus and the ovaries anatomical changes\r\nsimilar to those met with after the natural climacteric—diminution in\r\nthe size of the uterus with thinning of its walls, density and firmness\r\nof the tissues of the organ, smallness and a soft consistency of the\r\novaries; sometimes, also, the mammae are atrophic.\r\n\r\nIn cases of premature menopause, the troubles attending the change are\r\ncommonly more severe and more enduring than those that occur at the\r\nnatural menopause. Especially is this the case when the premature\r\nmenopause is quite a sudden occurrence, but this phenomenon is rare.\r\nMost commonly the premature menopause is gradual in onset; the flow\r\nbecomes more scanty month by month, until at last it fails altogether to\r\nappear. Irregularity in the menstrual rhythm is not often seen in such\r\ncases. Early senescence is exceptional in these women in whom a\r\npremature menopause occurs. Emaciation, greyness of the hair, wrinkling\r\nof the skin, the growth of hairs on the face, etc., are not usually\r\nassociated with the atrophy of the reproductive organs; the physiognomy\r\nand figure of women with cessatio praecox being usually similar to those\r\nseen in women of corresponding age in whom menstruation still continues.\r\n\r\n_Tilt_ enquired regarding the cause of cessatio praecox in 27 instances,\r\nwith the following results:\r\n\r\n     In 3 instances, parturition and lactation. In 1 instance, abortion.\r\n       In 2 instances, a fall on the sacrum during menstruation. In 2\r\n       instances, suppression of menstruation from chill. In 1 instance,\r\n       haemorrhage from the arm during menstruation. In 1 instance,\r\n       celebration of nuptials during menstruation. In 2 instances,\r\n       severe medicinal purgation. In 2 instances, cholera. In 2\r\n       instances, rheumatic fever. In 2 instances, febrile bronchitis.\r\n       In 9 instances, intermittent fever.\r\n\r\nIn 1 case _Tilt_ saw cessation of menstruation occur at the age of 29,\r\nin consequence of metritis. _Atlee_, in 15 cases of ovarian tumour, saw\r\nthe menopause occur at ages of 30, 39, 40 and 42. _Puech_ saw a\r\npremature menopause at the age of 30 in 3 cases, in each a sequel of\r\ncholera. _Blondel_ reports a case of cessatio praecox after prolonged\r\ngalactorrhoea, although the woman had not suckled her infant;\r\n_Gottschalk_ and _Rokitansky_, cases following injury to the cervix\r\nuteri; _Kiwisch_, _Simpson_, and _Kleinwächter_, cases following\r\nfull-time, normal deliveries, in which, however, severe losses of blood\r\nhad taken place.\r\n\r\n_Courty_ and _Brierre de Boismont_ report cases in which the menopause\r\noccurred as early as the age of 21; _Mayer_, 2 cases at the age of 22;\r\n_Krieger_, 1 case at 23; _Brierre de Boismont_, 1 case at 24; _Mayer_, 2\r\ncases at 25; _Brierre de Boismont_, 1 case at 26, and 1 case at 27;\r\n_Guy_ and _Tilt_, each 1 case at the age of 27; _Brierre de Boismont_,\r\n_Courty_, and _Guy_, each 1 case at the age of 28; _Brierre de\r\nBoismont_, _Courty_, and _Mayer_, each 1 case at the age of 29; _Guy_\r\nand _Tilt_, each 1 case at the age of 30; and _Mayer_, 5 cases at the\r\nage of 30.\r\n\r\nAn unusually late climacteric, the continuance of menstruation beyond\r\nthe age of 50 years, is not an extremely rare occurrence, but is less\r\noften seen than cessatio praecox. There is, however, in these cases a\r\ndifficulty which must not be underestimated, namely, to distinguish\r\nbetween a genuine menstrual bleeding and the other uterine haemorrhages\r\nwhich are common precisely at this age of life, due either to textural\r\nchanges in the uterus, or to neoplasmata—more especially because in\r\nthese non-menstrual haemorrhages also a certain periodicity may often be\r\ndetected. When on careful examination no abnormality can be discovered\r\nin the reproductive organs, when the bleeding in question recurs at the\r\nintervals and in association with the general symptoms to which the\r\nwoman thus affected has been accustomed during her previous\r\nmenstruations, and when the amount of blood discharged is not abnormal,\r\nit is permissible to conclude that we have to do with a persistence of\r\ntrue menstruation, even though the woman has some time since completed\r\nthe fifth decennium of her life. In some women, in fact, the\r\nreproductive system is so energetic, that ovulation continues to an age\r\nfar beyond the average, and such women are to be regarded as sexually\r\nlong-lived.\r\n\r\nAlthough the instances of protracted menstruation contained in the older\r\nliterature of the subject are open to suspicion, owing to the fact that\r\nat that time it was not possible to distinguish with certainty between\r\nmenstrual and pathological uterine haemorrhage, quite recently numerous\r\nincontestable cases of enduring sexual vitality have been put on record.\r\n\r\nI have myself seen no less than 106 cases in which the menopause did not\r\noccur until after the age of 50 years; among these there were 4 in which\r\nthe age at the menopause was 56; 5 in which it was 57; 2 in which it was\r\n58; 1 in which it was 59; and 1 in which it was 60. _Tilt_ records 128\r\ncases of menopause occurring after 50; among these there were 4 in which\r\nthe woman was 56 when menstruation ceased; 2 who were 57; 4 who were 58;\r\n1 who was 59; 1 who was 60; and 2 who were 61. _Courty_ reports a case\r\nin which menstruation persisted after the age of 65; _Mayer_, 3 cases of\r\nmenopause at 64; _Beigel_, 2 cases, 1 in which menstruation continued to\r\nthe age of 65, the other, to the age of 72. _Kleinwächter_ observed 33\r\ncases in which menstruation continued to an age varying from 50 to 57\r\nyears. _Emmet_, in the year 1886, published the case of a woman who was\r\nthen 70 years old, and who at this advanced age continued to menstruate\r\nregularly.\r\n\r\nThat not every case in which after the age of 50 years there is\r\nrecurrent, more or less periodic, haemorrhage from the genital organs,\r\nis to be regarded as an instance of delayed menopause, we are taught by\r\nthe records of post mortem examination in several cases of the kind.\r\n_Scanzoni_ reports the case of a woman who at the age of 60 was affected\r\nwith a fairly regular periodic discharge of blood from the vagina.\r\nDuring one of these haemorrhages, she died of pneumonia, and the autopsy\r\nshowed that the ovaries were completely atrophied and transformed into\r\ndense scar tissue, and contained no trace of corpus luteum or of fresh\r\nextravasation of blood, whilst in the upper part of the cervical canal\r\nthere were two mucous polypi each of about the size of a bean. In\r\nanother case, that of a woman 64 years of age, periodic losses of blood,\r\nat intervals of from three to four weeks, continued to the time of her\r\ndeath. This woman suffered from mitral valvular insufficiency, and it\r\nwas clear that the haemorrhages had been due to the venous engorgement\r\nconsequent upon imperfect compensation. The ovaries were completely\r\natrophied, and showed no trace of any recent maturation of ova; the\r\nuterus was enlarged, the mucous membrane hyperaemic, and the cavity\r\ncontained a recent clot.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently, the haemorrhages attributed to the persistence of\r\nmenstruation are really due to senile arteriosclerosis—to rigidity and\r\nbrittleness of the uterine arteries; in other cases they arise from\r\nvaricosity of the veins of the cervical canal. A common cause of such\r\nbleedings from the genital passage in comparatively advanced life, is to\r\nbe found in the growth of uterine myomata.\r\n\r\nTo myoma uteri we must attribute a part, though by no means all, of the\r\ncases in which menstruation seems to recur some years after the\r\nmenopause has, to all appearance, been fully established. In most of\r\nthese cases, indeed, we have to do with pathological haemorrhages, the\r\ncause of which is, however, but too often obscure. Still, cases\r\ncertainly occur in which, two or three years or even longer after the\r\nmenopause, some unknown stimulus leads to the regular recurrence of\r\nmenstruation. The possibility of such an occurrence is, in my opinion,\r\nfully proved by post mortem examinations of the bodies of elderly women\r\nin whom the menopause has been fully established and yet the ovaries are\r\nfound to contain follicles of various degrees of ripeness, and also\r\nfresh corpora lutea—signs that ovulation may persist for a considerable\r\ntime after the complete cessation of menstruation. Another proof of the\r\nlast fact is the well known experience that women who have some time ago\r\nceased to menstruate, may nevertheless become pregnant. _Waldeyer_,\r\nindeed, asserts that when four years have elapsed since the menopause,\r\nfollicles are never to be found in the ovaries, but this negative\r\nexperience is not decisive, especially as regards the cases in which\r\nregular menstruation is resumed some time after the occurrence of a\r\npremature menopause.\r\n\r\nI have myself seen several cases in which the menopause occurred at 35,\r\n38, 39, and 42 years, respectively; 3, 4, or 5 years later, as a result\r\nof hydropathic treatment, regular menstruation recurred. In one case, a\r\nwoman who had ceased to menstruate ten years before, gave birth to a\r\nchild at the age of 45.\r\n\r\nNumerous indisputable cases of this kind are reported in the recent\r\nliterature of the subject. _Krieger_ had under his personal observation\r\na woman of a robust habit of body, in whom menstruation ceased at the\r\nage of 48 years, her eighth child having been born fifteen years before.\r\nTwo years later irregular menstruation recurred, and on the cessation of\r\nthese haemorrhages, it appeared that the woman was once more gravid; she\r\nwas delivered at full term of a girl. _Mayer_ observed the following\r\ncase: A strong working-class woman 33 years of age had begun to\r\nmenstruate regularly when 13 years old; between the ages of 17 and 28\r\nshe gave birth to five children, and in addition had one miscarriage\r\nwhen 19 years old. Widowed at the age of 29, she fell ill, and on\r\nexamination the uterus was found to be small and relaxed, whilst the\r\nvaginal portion of the cervix was reduced to a mere rudiment. Since she\r\nhad been 22 years of age she had had persistent leucorrhoea, but no\r\ntrace of menstrual haemorrhage; yet since that age she had had three\r\nchildren. _Renaudin_ delivered a woman 61 years of age, who had ceased\r\nto menstruate 12 years earlier. _Meissner_ reports a case in which a\r\nwoman first began to menstruate at the age of 20, had her first child\r\nwhen 47 years old, and gave birth to the last of her eight children when\r\n60 years of age.\r\n\r\nThe sudden and permanent cessation of menstruation, whether at the\r\nnormal climacteric age, or earlier in life, is always a pathological\r\noccurrence. As compared with the normal, gradual disappearance of\r\nmenstruation, associated with the usual climacteric symptoms, such a\r\nsudden extinction of menstrual activity is, moreover, quite rare. When\r\nit does occur, the cause is to be found in one of various pathological\r\ngeneral states, such as one of the acute infectious disorders, or some\r\nother exhausting disease, or sometimes in some local disease of the\r\nreproductive organs; occasionally, however, it may occur in perfect\r\nhealth, in consequence of some powerful physical or mental stimulus,\r\nsuch as a severe blow or intense fright.\r\n\r\nThis sudden menopause has been observed after severe labour or abortion\r\nwith profuse haemorrhage, or after cholera or typhoid; we must assume\r\nthat in such cases the anæmia of the genital organs has disturbed the\r\nfunction of ovulation; whilst in cases due to mental shock, the\r\ninterference with ovulation must be through the intermediation of the\r\nnervous system. Frequently, of course, in these cases, the sudden\r\nmenopause is also a premature one.\r\n\r\n_Tilt_ reports a case in which a sudden menopause ensued upon phlebotomy\r\nduring menstruation; several cases also in which women at ages varying\r\nfrom 30 to 34, or 39 years, ceased to menstruate suddenly and\r\npermanently in consequence of grief at the unexpected death of the\r\nhusband; and another case of sudden menopause due to a fall down stairs.\r\n_Courty_ reports three cases of sudden menopause at the age of 30,\r\nconsequent upon an attack of cholera. _Dusourd_ has seen three cases in\r\nwhich, in women aged 40 to 43 years, severe haemorrhoidal bleeding was\r\nfollowed by sudden and permanent cessation of menstruation. _Mayer_\r\nreports the case of a delicate middle-class woman 34 years of age, who\r\nhad begun to menstruate at the age of 14, had married at the age of 20,\r\nand at the age of 21 after a normal delivery, ceased for ever to\r\nmenstruate; and another case of a working-class woman 34 years of age\r\nwho first menstruated at the age of 13 years, married at the age of 20,\r\nhad two children in rapid succession, and finally ceased to menstruate,\r\nin consequence of a fright, at the age of 30 years. _Krieger_ reports\r\nthe case of a very nervous woman who first menstruated at the age of\r\nthirteen, and in whom at the age of 23 a sudden menopause ensued upon a\r\nnervous attack; in another case reported by the same observer, a sudden\r\nmenopause occurred in a delicate woman 41 years of age owing to her\r\nhusband’s death—this woman had previously experienced six months\r\namenorrhœa in consequence of sorrow at the death of one of her children.\r\nThe following remarkable case is reported by _Brierre de Boismont_: A\r\nsempstress began to menstruate at the age of 13 years; she married very\r\nsoon after this, and gave birth to four children, the last when 21 years\r\nof age. In the course of the following year there was a fire in the\r\nhouse, and owing to this fright a sudden menopause occurred. Similar\r\ncases have been reported quite recently by _Bossi_ and _Walter_.\r\n\r\nThe harmful influence which the occurrence of a sudden menopause\r\nexercises upon the general condition of the woman who experiences it, is\r\nmanifested chiefly by violent circulatory disturbances, hyperaemia and\r\ncongestion of the brain, lungs, and abdominal organs, and by states of\r\nexcitement and depression of the nervous system. Of the vicarious\r\nhaemorrhages which are apt to ensue upon such a sudden menopause, we\r\nhave already spoken.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, women in middle life, in whom the whole organism is\r\naccustomed to the onset and decline of the menstrual hyperaemia, endure\r\nthe functional disturbances induced by a sudden and complete cessation\r\nof menstruation much more easily than women who have already entered\r\nupon the climacteric age, or have nearly attained that age. The\r\nclimacteric age is one in which women are already predisposed to\r\ncirculatory disturbances in the pelvic organs, and it will readily be\r\nunderstood that in them the sudden interruption of the menstrual\r\nhaemorrhages will have more serious consequences than in women in the\r\nprime of their sexual life, and therefore endowed with a greater power\r\nof resisting disturbances of the normal functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PATHOLOGY OF THE MENOPAUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Diseases of the Genital Organs._\r\n\r\nAmong the commonest of the symptoms of the sexual epoch of the menopause\r\nis menorrhagia. It occurs especially in plethoric women, in those who\r\nduring the prime of their sexual life have been accustomed to menstruate\r\nabundantly, and in those who have given birth to many children or had\r\nmany miscarriages; but it is seen also in weakly and delicate\r\nindividuals, in whom the tissues of the genital organs have become\r\nextremely flaccid and loose in texture. A luxurious mode of life, more\r\nespecially a free consumption of alcoholic beverages, and also frequent\r\nsexual intercourse during the climacteric period, appear to favour the\r\noccurrence of menorrhagia at this epoch.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently, menorrhagia is the first sign of the commencement of\r\nthe climacteric, menstruation having been hitherto regular, and not\r\nexcessive in amount. Generally, when this climacteric menorrhagia\r\nbegins, the intervals also become shorter, the menstrual period being\r\nreduced to three or even two weeks. At times, however, the more profuse\r\nmenstruation recurs at longer intervals, six weeks, two months, or even\r\nlonger. In any case, the occurrence at the climacteric age of a severe\r\nor atypical haemorrhage, renders it the imperative duty of the physician\r\nto undertake a local examination of the genital organs; for it is\r\nnecessary to ascertain without delay whether such a haemorrhage is a\r\ntrue climacteric phenomenon, or whether it is due to some actual disease\r\nof the reproductive organs—a neoplasm, or the like.\r\n\r\nIf the haemorrhage is due solely to the change of life, the vaginal\r\nportion of the cervix will usually be found soft and flaccid, bleeding\r\nreadily on slight injury, and sometimes eroded; there is generally\r\nassociated leucorrhoea. This relaxation and loss of firmness in the\r\nuterine tissues at the time of the menopause is the cause of the\r\npredisposition to excessive haemorrhage. An additional cause exists in\r\nthe circulatory disturbances in the pelvic organs. We presume that women\r\naffected with menorrhagia at this time of life suffer from some\r\npersistent disturbance in the region of the inferior vena cava, whereby\r\nthe outflow of blood from the veins of the pelvis is hindered, and a\r\nchronic condition of stasis in the uterus is conditioned. Hence arises\r\ndistension of the vessels of the uterine mucous membrane, and this\r\nrhexis is relieved by the excessive haemorrhages. In these\r\nconsiderations lies the explanation of the fact that women who have had\r\nmany children or many miscarriages, are especially prone to suffer from\r\nclimacteric menorrhagia; and also women who for any reason are\r\npredisposed to intra-abdominal stasis.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of climacteric menorrhagia is to be found in the frequent\r\noccurrence at this epoch of advanced arteriosclerotic changes in the\r\nuterine blood vessels, the disease being in some cases limited to the\r\nuterine arteries, and in others part of a general arterial degeneration.\r\nThe blood may be derived from ruptured sclerotic capillaries of the\r\nmucous membrane; but in other cases it exudes in consequence of passive\r\nhyperaemia, without actual rupture of the bloodvessels. To such\r\nhaemorrhages from atheromatous vessels we must refer many of the attacks\r\nof uterine haemorrhage that occur in elderly women, such as were\r\nformerly, before their true nature was understood, commonly regarded as\r\ninstances of a very late return of menstruation. By careful examination\r\nthe exact source of the blood can often be detected in such cases.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Theilhaber_, one cause of the haemorrhages occurring at\r\nthe climacteric is to be found in the atrophy of the uterine muscle\r\nwhich takes place at this period of life. Except during pregnancy and\r\nthe puerperium, the uterus is usually in a state of moderate\r\ncontraction; during the height of the menstrual flux, however, the\r\nuterus is relaxed. Then, as contraction of the muscle sets in, the\r\nmenstrual hyperaemia and consequent haemorrhage are gradually brought to\r\nan end. When this contraction is insufficient, the hyperaemia and\r\nswelling of the uterus are more enduring. In association with the\r\natrophy of the uterine muscle at the climacteric, there usually occurs a\r\nnotable diminution in the size of the uterine vessels, so that,\r\nnotwithstanding the diminished strength of the muscular contractions,\r\nany excessive loss of blood is prevented. But if this diminution in the\r\ncalibre of the vessels fails to take place, the atony of the uterine\r\nmuscle leads to hyperaemia, to haemorrhage, and often, in addition, to\r\noedema of the organ, with elongation and thickening of its\r\nwalls—hyperplasia uteri preclimacterica.\r\n\r\nAmong diseases of the uterus which during the climacteric may give rise\r\nto severe haemorrhage, and may lead to the mistaken opinion that\r\nmenstruation still continues, we must in the first place mention\r\ncarcinomatous disease of the cervix and of the body of the uterus; next\r\nin importance come myoma and fibrous polypi; less frequent causes of\r\nsuch haemorrhages are fungous endometritis, erosions, mucous polypi,\r\nprolapse of the uterus, and ovarian cystoma.\r\n\r\nThe climacteric age gives rise to a predisposition, not only to\r\nbleeding, but also to other pathological changes in the reproductive\r\norgans. We can by no means endorse the opinion of _Currier_—one long ago\r\nexpressed also by _Brierre de Boismont_—that women during the sexual\r\nepoch of the menopause are less disposed to diseases of all kinds, and\r\namong them to diseases of the genital organs, than younger women, for\r\nthe reason that their tissues are endowed with less vitality, and are,\r\ntherefore, more resistent to all the causes of disease. On the contrary,\r\nthe number of pathological disorders liable to affect the reproductive\r\norgans precisely at this period of life, is strikingly large. Among my\r\n500 cases of women at the climacteric age, there were 440 who complained\r\nof such symptoms, the diseases from which they suffered being, in order\r\nof frequency:\r\n\r\n              Profuse haemorrhages in           286 cases\r\n              Chronic metritis in                79 cases\r\n              Leucorrhoea in                    327 cases\r\n              Displacements of the uterus       117 cases\r\n                viz., prolapsus in               65 cases\r\n                anteflexion and retroflexion in  52 cases\r\n              Genital pruritus in                46 cases\r\n              Vaginismus in                      12 cases\r\n              Carcinoma uteri in                  3 cases\r\n              Myoma uteri in                      5 cases\r\n              Tumor mammae in                     8 cases\r\n\r\nI need hardly point out that in many individuals more than one of these\r\ndiseases were present at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious feature of these statistics is the extraordinary\r\nfrequency of uterine haemorrhage and of leucorrhoea in climacteric\r\nwomen. The former condition was present in more than half my cases; the\r\nlatter actually in three-fourths.\r\n\r\nThe same two pathological states were also those most frequently\r\nrecorded in _Tilt’s_ statistics. This author, in 446 women at the\r\nclimacteric, found the following diseases of the reproductive apparatus:\r\n\r\n       Haemorrhages in                                 138 cases\r\n       Leucorrhoea recurring at irregular intervals in 146 cases\r\n       Leucorrhoea recurring monthly in                 12 cases\r\n       Remittent menstruation in                        33 cases\r\n       Vaginitis in                                      4 cases\r\n       Follicular inflammation of the vulva in          10 cases\r\n       Inflammation of the labia in                      4 cases\r\n       Ulceration of the cervix uteri in                 9 cases\r\n       Prolapsus uteri in                                5 cases\r\n       Uterine polypi in                                 4 cases\r\n       Fibrous tumours of the uterus in                  4 cases\r\n       Cancer of the uterus in                           4 cases\r\n       Chronic ovarian tumours in                        3 cases\r\n       Irritation and swelling of the breasts in        14 cases\r\n       Lacteal or gelatinous secretion in breasts in     2 cases\r\n       Hard, non-malignant tumour of the breast in       2 cases\r\n       Chancre of the breast in                           1 case\r\n       Frequent sedimentation in the urine in           49 cases\r\n       Difficult and painful micturition in              9 cases\r\n       Incontinence of urine in                          4 cases\r\n       Haematuria in                                     2 cases\r\n       Perineal abscess in                               2 cases\r\n\r\nChronic metritis and endometritis come under observation with\r\nconsiderable frequency during the climacteric age, but as a rule these\r\ndiseases have originated during the period of sexual maturity, and in\r\nexceptional instances only does the cessation of the menses appear to be\r\nthe etiological starting point of these disorders. In fact, this occurs\r\nonly when the menopause is premature, or when it is quite sudden in\r\nonset, whether this be due to noxious influences or to constitutional\r\ndisorder. For the menstrual process quite normally gives rise to a\r\ncertain congestion of the genital organs; and should menstruation be\r\nsuddenly suppressed, the blood-stasis in the uterus becomes so extreme\r\nthat morbid tissue changes are very likely to ensue. And when chronic\r\nmetritis has occurred before, the congestion and stasis in the uterus at\r\nthe climacteric will usually suffice to light up the inflammatory\r\nprocess afresh. This is the explanation of the fact that symptoms of\r\nslight metritis make their appearance at the very beginning of the\r\nclimax, manifested by thickening of the corpus uteri and of the portio\r\nvaginalis of the cervix, by swelling and softening of the mucous\r\nmembrane, and by abundant secretion. In those who, either after\r\nfull-term delivery or after abortion, have suffered formerly from\r\nchronic metritis or endometritis, but who have been quite free from any\r\nsymptoms of these troubles for many years prior to the climacteric, it\r\noften happens that the change of life is ushered in by symptoms of\r\ncongestion of the uterus with associated leucorrhoea. With the\r\ncompletion of the menopause, however, the resulting involution of the\r\nuterus exerts a favourable influence upon all such chronic inflammatory\r\nprocesses in the genital organs; as the atrophy progresses, the periodic\r\nattacks of congestion cease to recur. Thus it happens that women who for\r\nyears have suffered from haemorrhages, from inflammatory disorders of\r\nthe genital organs, and from various other troubles of a similar nature,\r\nwill, once the menopause is fully over, feel quite well up to an\r\nadvanced period of life—they seem as it were to begin life afresh.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Bennet_, the characteristic signs of climacteric metritis\r\nare that the inflammatory symptoms are less pronounced, that the pains\r\nare less severe, that elongation of the cervix is less often seen, and\r\nthat fungous changes are less marked, than is the case in the chronic\r\nmetritis of younger women. On the contrary, the cervix appears smaller,\r\noften somewhat lobulated, it is harder, granulations are numerous,\r\nulceration is rare, the enlargement of the uterine cavity is but slight.\r\n_Bennet’s_ views are, however, opposed by _Scanzoni_, who maintains that\r\nthere is no notable difference between the chronic metritis of younger\r\nwomen and the disease as it occurs in women at the climacteric.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the chronic metritis and endometritis of women during the\r\nclimacteric age, differs in no important respect from these diseases as\r\nthey are seen in women during their sexual prime. We merely note that\r\nthe enlargement of the uterus is less marked; but the thickening and\r\nextreme hyperaemia of the mucous membrane are the same in both cases,\r\nthe secretion is increased in quantity, the vaginal portion of the\r\ncervix is elongated, and usually displays erosions, excoriations, or\r\nulcers. The subjective troubles appear less pronounced than in the case\r\nof the metritis of the menacme. The prognosis is as a rule a more\r\nfavourable one than in the earlier years of sexual life, for as soon as\r\nthe series of involuntary processes is completed, when the retrogressive\r\nchanges in the genital organs are at an end, when senile atrophy of the\r\nuterus and the uterine annexa has set in, a cure of the troubles\r\nformerly so obstinate and so enduring speedily takes place.\r\n\r\nQuite recently, much has been written upon the subject of a peculiar\r\nsenile endometritis (_Patru_, _Skene_, _Mundé_, _Rüder_, _Sheldon_,\r\n_Herman_, and others), and it has been described as “a peculiar form of\r\nsenile, haemorrhagic, leucocytal hyperplasia of the uterine mucous\r\nmembrane” (_Gottschalk_). According to _Maurange_ and _Lorain_ it occurs\r\nin as many as 7.2% of elderly women. It is seen especially in women who\r\nearlier in life have suffered from diseases of the genital organs, more\r\nespecially those who have previously suffered from endometritis; at\r\ntimes a senile vulvitis or vaginitis is the cause of the disease.\r\nDisplacements of the uterus with kinking of its canal, whereby retention\r\nof the secretion and its decomposition are induced, has been assigned as\r\nan additional cause of the disorder, also prolapse of the uterus, and,\r\nin isolated instances, necrotic fibromata. According to the degree to\r\nwhich the atrophy of the tissues has proceeded, and according as the\r\nmucous membrane is still partly retained or entirely destroyed, and\r\naccording to the extent to which the uterine vessels have been affected\r\nwith the sclerotic processes of old age, does the pathologico-anatomical\r\npicture of senile endometritis vary. It may affect the body only of the\r\nuterus, it may extend also to the cervix, the vagina, and even the\r\nvulva; upwards it may pass to the uterine annexa and to the peritoneum.\r\nThe first and most important symptom of this senile endometritis is the\r\noutflow, usually intermittent, rarely continuous, of a sero-purulent,\r\nand sometimes sanguineous discharge, with a powerful foetid smell; there\r\nare colicky pains, which pass off when the uterus has emptied itself;\r\noften, also, there are atypical bleedings, which are not profuse. The\r\nuterus is usually found to be larger than the atrophy general at the\r\npatient’s age would have led us to expect, it is often retroflexed, the\r\ncervix is thickened, the lips of the os uteri are usually everted and\r\nraw. When persistent, this senile endometritis causes profound\r\nconstitutional disturbance, and is often difficult to differentiate from\r\ncarcinoma of the uterus.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of senile irritation of the uterus, _Maxwell_ has\r\ndescribed a disease occurring at the climacteric, characterized by an\r\nenormously increased irritability of the uterus, with marked reflex\r\nmanifestations; in these cases also we may perhaps have to do with a\r\nsenile endometritis. The most pronounced symptom is a severe and\r\nconstant uterine pain, to which in the course of the disease are\r\nsuperadded pains in the gastric and cardiac regions, the rectum, and the\r\nspinal column; these pains lasted a long time, and their severity was\r\nsuch that it became necessary in some cases to remove the uterus.\r\n\r\nHydrometra is a disease which makes its appearance principally late in\r\nthe climacteric period, when menstruation has already completely ceased,\r\nand when the adhesions associated with the climacteric atrophy of the\r\nuterus have led to atresia of the cervical canal. Among 74 cases of\r\nhydrometra (from the material of the Pathologico-Anatomical Institute of\r\nPrague, in the years 1868 to 1871) not one of the women was less than 40\r\nyears of age; the age distribution of the cases was in fact the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n                     Quinquennium 40 to 45  3 cases\r\n                     Quinquennium 45 to 50  2 cases\r\n                     Quinquennium 50 to 55  2 cases\r\n                     Quinquennium 55 to 60  8 cases\r\n                     Quinquennium 60 to 65 18 cases\r\n                     Quinquennium 65 to 70 12 cases\r\n                     Quinquennium 70 to 75 11 cases\r\n                     Quinquennium 75 to 80  8 cases\r\n                     Quinquennium 80 to 85  4 cases\r\n                     Quinquennium 85 to 90  6 cases\r\n\r\nIn 40 of these cases, the occlusion was in the region of the os\r\ninternum, in 23 it was in the region of the os externum, in 9 cases the\r\nwhole length of the cervical canal was obliterated, and in 2 both the\r\ninternal and the external os were occluded, the intervening portion of\r\nthe cervical canal being still patent. In the two latter cases, there\r\nwas hydrometra bicamerata, with retroflexion of the uterus.\r\n\r\nLate in the climacteric period, haematometra also occurs, though less\r\noften than hydrometra. When, in cases in which the os uteri externum is\r\noccluded, in consequence of adhesion between the vaginal walls and the\r\nvaginal portion of the cervix, as a sequel of the vaginitis ulcerosa\r\nadhesiva of elderly women, there is haemorrhage from the atheromatous\r\nvessels of the uterus or the tubes, the blood necessarily distends the\r\nuterine cavity.\r\n\r\nDuring the climacteric period, leucorrhoea is so extraordinarily\r\nfrequent, as the figures previously given show, that the assumption is\r\njustified that with the diminution or cessation of the menstrual flow,\r\nthis hypersecretion from the genital mucous membranes forms as it were a\r\nkind of vicarious flux. Sometimes, as in 12 cases recorded by _Tilt_, we\r\nactually have a periodic “menstrual leucorrhoea”; in one of these cases\r\nthe discharge recurred at regular monthly intervals for 12 months, in\r\nanother for 18 months, in several for 2 years, and in one for as long as\r\n7 years. It is only by careful examination that the exact source of the\r\ndischarge can be determined, for during the climacteric also, as well as\r\nearlier in life, leucorrhoea may be due either to endometritis or to\r\ncolpitis. A muco-serous or sanguino-serous secretion may also be due to\r\nslight vulvitis.\r\n\r\nA peculiar form of inflammation occurring after the completion of the\r\nmenopause, and after the atrophic process in the vagina is considerably\r\nadvanced, is known as colpitis senilis. In this disease, ulceration\r\nreadily occurs, followed by cicatricial adhesion between the anterior\r\nand posterior walls of the vagina (vaginitis adhaesiva vetularum); in\r\nother cases herpetiform eruptions arise, with a tendency to pustule\r\nformation; occlusion of the vagina may lead to hydrometra and pyometra;\r\nsometimes the obliteration of the vagina is complete, so that there is\r\nneither outlet for blood from the uterus, nor inlet for the penis during\r\ncoitus. This vaginitis adhaesiva vetularum is by no means rare in the\r\nclimacteric period; as a rule it does not give rise to very serious\r\ntrouble, the most prominent symptom being usually somewhat persistent\r\nhaemorrhage, unaccompanied by any evil odour. On local examination, the\r\ncharacteristic strings of scar tissue are felt, passing from the portio\r\nvaginalis to the narrowed, senile vaginal fornix; from the cervical\r\ncanal there exudes a usually somewhat vitreous mucus, mixed with blood.\r\nThe cervix itself is thin and atrophied, the uterus also is greatly\r\ndiminished in size.\r\n\r\nThe frequency at the time of the menopause of such catarrhal\r\ninflammatory processes in the vagina and vulva is said by _Duprès_ to\r\ndepend on the weakness or paresis of the bladder which is so common in\r\nwomen at this time of life. Owing to the incomplete evacuation of the\r\nurine, cystitis very readily ensues; the urine is evacuated\r\ninvoluntarily during sleep, and some of this fluid passes through the\r\nvaginal orifice, giving rise all the more readily to colpitis, because\r\nthe secretion of the atrophic mucous membrane no longer possesses the\r\nnormal acid bactericidal properties. According to _Scott_, vulvitis may\r\nalso arise as a sequel of calculus-formation in the glands of Bartholin,\r\na frequent occurrence in elderly life, followed by inflammation and\r\nabscess-formation in these glands. Among the diseases of the genital\r\norgans at the climacteric period, _Fritsch_ also enumerates urethral\r\ncaruncle and carcinoma of the clitoris.\r\n\r\n_Displacements of the Uterus._—Among the commonest of the displacements\r\nof the uterus occurring during and after the menopause, is prolapse of\r\nthe organ. Previously existing descent of the uterus is apt to be\r\ngreatly aggravated at the climacteric, a partial prolapse, for instance,\r\nbecoming complete; or prolapse of the uterus may first set in at this\r\nperiod of life.\r\n\r\nThere are several contributory causes of the liability to prolapse at\r\nthis particular epoch, especially in women who have had a great many\r\nchildren, and in those with either enlargement of the uterus or with\r\nlacerated perineum; the most powerful of these causes being the\r\nweakening of the uterine supports in consequence of the general\r\nrelaxation of the pelvic tissues. At the menopause, the connective\r\ntissue by means of which the uterus is attached to surrounding\r\nstructures, withers; simultaneously the vagina atrophies, and this\r\nsource of support is weakened; the whole pelvic floor loses its firmness\r\nand power of support. For these reasons, a uterus which has hitherto\r\nbeen in correct position readily becomes retroverted and to some extent\r\nprolapsed; whilst one that was already thus far displaced prior to the\r\nmenopause, will now be apt to descend still further till it rests upon\r\nthe perineum. With the disappearance from the vulva and the perineum of\r\nthe adipose tissue on which their firmness so largely depends, complete\r\nprolapse of the uterus is now likely to ensue. Prolapse of the urethra\r\nmay also result from senile involution of the pelvic contents.\r\n\r\nAmong my 500 cases of women at the climacteric, there were 65 instances\r\nof more or less severe prolapse of the uterus. The frequency of prolapse\r\nin women at the climacteric and in those at a more advanced age, is\r\nshown by the following figures, which are compiled from the post mortem\r\nstatistics of the Pathologico-Anatomical Institute of Prague (years 1868\r\nto 1871). Prolapse of the uterus was found:\r\n\r\n                In the quinquennium 30 to 35 in 2 women\r\n                In the quinquennium 35 to 40 in 2 women\r\n                In the quinquennium 40 to 45 in 6 women\r\n                In the quinquennium 45 to 50 in 3 women\r\n                In the quinquennium 50 to 55 in 6 women\r\n                In the quinquennium 55 to 60 in 8 women\r\n                In the quinquennium 60 to 65 in 6 women\r\n                In the quinquennium 65 to 70 in 4 women\r\n                In the quinquennium 70 to 75 in 4 women\r\n                In the quinquennium 75 to 80 in 4 women\r\n                In the quinquennium 80 to 85 in 2 women\r\n\r\nFlexions and versions of the uterus, common as they are at the time of\r\nthe menopause, have no longer the same importance that they possessed\r\nduring the prime of the sexual life. For on the one part the size of the\r\nuterus is greatly diminished, in consequence of the lessened\r\nblood-supply and of senile involution of the organ; and on the other,\r\nafter the cessation of menstruation, the profuse haemorrhages and severe\r\ncolicky pains which for the most part occurred during menstruation in\r\nthese cases of kinking of the uterine canal, and which gave rise to such\r\nsevere general disturbance, now no longer occur. Herein lies the\r\nexplanation of the fact, well known to all experienced practitioners,\r\nthat women who have for many years suffered from retroflexion or\r\nretroversion of the uterus associated with severe and painful symptoms,\r\ncease to suffer after the menopause is established, and regain excellent\r\nhealth, although the local condition of the uterus remains unrelieved.\r\n\r\n_Neoplasmata of the Uterus and of the Uterine Annexa._—The most serious\r\ndanger to the life of a woman during the climacteric period is to be\r\nfound in the strong tendency to the occurrence of carcinomatous disease\r\nof the uterus—a predisposition so marked that not less than one-half of\r\nall illnesses affecting the reproductive organs of women at this age are\r\ncases of carcinoma of the uterus. The disease occurs especially at the\r\nbeginning of the climacteric, between the ages of 45 and 50 years, most\r\noften in the form of carcinoma of the portio vaginalis, whereas after\r\nthe completion of the menopause, carcinoma of the body of the uterus is\r\nthe preponderant form. The true reason for the frequency of the\r\noccurrence of carcinoma at this period of life will only become clear to\r\nus when we are more fully acquainted with the nature and origin of this\r\nform of malignant disease. Meanwhile, it would seem that the\r\npredisposition to cancer during and shortly after the menopause depends\r\nupon the anatomical changes in the reproductive organs at the time of\r\ninvolution, which render these organs a more suitable soil for the\r\nproliferation of malignant growths; and further it is probable that the\r\nloss of the acid, bactericidal quality of the vaginal secretion, opens\r\nthe door for the entrance of pathogenic micro-organisms. Noteworthy is\r\nthe observation of _Baer_ and _Leopold_, that very frequently a\r\npreclimacteric or climacteric fungous endometritis forms the stage of\r\ntransition to the development of carcinoma of the body of the uterus. At\r\nthe time of the menopause there is also an increased liability to the\r\noccurrence of cancer of the ovaries. Numerous statistical data have been\r\npublished regarding the frequency with which carcinoma of the uterus\r\noccurs at various periods in women’s lives, and, notwithstanding all\r\nvariations, one fact stands out clearly, namely, that this disease\r\noccurs most frequently in the fourth and fifth decennia, and above all\r\nduring the climacteric period.\r\n\r\nFrom _Gusserow’s_ collection of 526 cases, observed by _Lebert_,\r\n_Kiwisch_, _Chiari_, _Scanzoni_, and _Saexinger_, the following table\r\nhas been drawn up, and it shows very clearly the great preponderance of\r\nthe disease in the fifth decennium of a woman’s life:\r\n\r\n          At ages of from 20 to 30 there were         12 cases\r\n          At ages of from 30 to 40 there were        161 cases\r\n          At ages of from 40 to 50 there were       217 castes\r\n          At ages of from 50 to 60 there were        102 cases\r\n          At ages of from 60 to 70 there were         38 cases\r\n          At ages of from 70 and upwards there were    5 cases\r\n\r\nFrom the mortality statistics we obtain a similar result as regards the\r\nage incidence of carcinoma of the uterus. Thus, in England there died of\r\nthis disease in one year:\r\n\r\n                  Women at ages of from 15 to 25   44\r\n                  Women at ages of from 25 to 35  184\r\n                  Women at ages of from 35 to 45  717\r\n                  Women at ages of from 45 to 55 1110\r\n                  Women at ages of from 55 to 65 1116\r\n                  Women at ages of from 65 to 75  876\r\n\r\nComing now to the consideration of fibromyomata of the uterus, we cannot\r\nshare the opinion that at the climacteric age there is a special\r\npredisposition to the origination of such tumours, or that the climax\r\nfavours the growth of already existing fibromyomata. It appears to us\r\nthat in the preclimacteric epoch and the commencement of the\r\nclimacteric, the symptoms of existing fibromyomata become more\r\ntroublesome, the haemorrhages are more severe, the pains more violent;\r\nbut that as the menopause is established, these troublesome symptoms\r\ndecline progressively in intensity, and not only is there an arrest in\r\nthe growth of the tumours, but often an actual diminution in their size.\r\n\r\nI have myself repeatedly observed such cases, in which I had the\r\nopportunity of watching the growth of the myomata during a period of ten\r\nyears or more. Other cases, indeed, show that myomata may increase in\r\nsize after the menopause, at times with remarkable rapidity, and further\r\nthat at this period of life a malignant degeneration may occur in such\r\ntumours. Carcinomatous, sarcomatous, and myxomatous degeneration have\r\nbeen observed, and also the transformation of a myoma into a soft\r\nfibrocystic tumour.\r\n\r\nAtrophy of fibromyomatous tumours at the menopause, associated with the\r\natrophy of the uterus that then occurs, has been observed by _Playfair_\r\nand by _Doran_. The tumour shrinks, its muscle-cells become smaller, and\r\nundergo fatty degeneration, there is an increase in the interstitial\r\nconnective tissue, so that ultimately the fibromyoma is transformed into\r\na firm and dense fibroid swelling. Cases in the older literature and\r\nalso a recent observation of _Yamagiron_ have shown that calcification\r\nof uterine fibromyomata sometimes occurs, leading to the formation of\r\nthe so-called “uterine calculi.” In the case of pure myomata, the\r\ndiminution in size occurring at the climacteric is generally due to\r\nresorption and fatty degeneration, whereas in the case of fibromyoma it\r\ndepends on induration and atrophy. It remains uncertain whether the\r\ngrowth of purely fibrous tumours is also affected by the climacteric.\r\n\r\nWhilst the influence of the climacteric on the growth of fibromyomata is\r\nthus usually advantageous to the patient, exceptions occur, as is shown\r\nby cases recorded by _Lawson Tait_, _Schorler_, and _Boerner_; the\r\nlast-named author points out that at the climacteric there is a tendency\r\nfor the transformation of fibromyomata into sarcomata.\r\n\r\n_Kleinwächter_ had under observation 78 cases of fibromyomata of the\r\nuterus in women who were older than 45 years; in only 8 of these was a\r\ndiminution in the size of the tumour observed at the menopause; in 11\r\ncases at this time, the tumour increased in size more or less rapidly;\r\nin 3 cases, a carcinomatous change occurred in the tumour; in 3 cases,\r\nthe tumour was first observed at the time of the menopause; in 13 cases,\r\nthe haemorrhages appeared to undergo a complete arrest at the menopause,\r\nbut the size of the tumour was not affected; in the remaining 48 cases,\r\nno influence, either favourable or unfavourable, appeared to be\r\nexercised by the menopause on the fibromyoma of the uterus.\r\n\r\nCases reported by _Rogival_, _Simpson_, and _Gusserow_ indicate the\r\nexistence of a certain predisposition to the growth of sarcomata of the\r\nuterus at the climacteric period. _Gusserow_ more particularly insists\r\non the fact that we must bear in mind the likelihood of the origination\r\nof a fibrosarcoma or of the sarcomatous transformation of a fibromyoma,\r\nin all cases in which a fibrous tumour of the uterus first attracts\r\nattention at the climacteric period; or in which a tumour hitherto small\r\nand inconspicuous and giving little or no trouble, begins at this time\r\nto increase in size or to give rise to troublesome symptoms.\r\n\r\n_Neuroses of the Reproductive Organs._—One of the commonest neuroses of\r\nthe reproductive organs at the climacteric period is pruritus vaginae et\r\nvulvae, and it is one of the most distressing symptoms of which women of\r\nthis age complain. The disorder depends upon a hyperaesthesia of the\r\nsensory nerves of the vagina and the external organs of generation. It\r\nis characterized by enduring sensations of itching and burning, which\r\nmay be either periodic (and then usually nocturnal) or continuous; at\r\ntimes it becomes so severe that the women thus affected have an\r\nunceasing desire to scratch, avoid all society, and ultimately find life\r\nquite unbearable. In the slighter degrees of pruritus, no objective\r\nchanges are to be observed in the genital organs, or at most some slight\r\nhyperaemia of the vaginal orifice. In the more severe forms, however,\r\nthere are local nutritive changes: the labia are swollen, their surface\r\nhas an erythematous blush, a number of the hair-follicles are enlarged\r\nand prominent; the vaginal orifice is abnormally sensitive, it is\r\nscarlet or livid-red in colour and here and there denuded of epithelium,\r\nand there are scattered mucous follicles distended with a serous or\r\npurulent fluid; these small vessels are to be seen chiefly on the inner\r\nsurfaces of the labia minora and around the clitoris. At the same time,\r\nthe vulva secretes an acid, burning fluid, which greatly increases the\r\npatent’s sufferings, and at times impels her irresistibly to the\r\npractice of masturbation. In cases of long standing, we find\r\nhypertrophy, elongation, and deformity of the nymphæ, and pigmentation\r\nof these organs, with the formation of varices.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Fritsch_, in exceptional cases pollutions are the\r\noriginating cause of the pruritus, and this may be the case in women who\r\nare not sexually passionate. It occurs, indeed, especially in matrons\r\nwho have not had sexual intercourse for years, and who have quite ceased\r\nto think about sexual matters; during the night, such a woman will begin\r\nto have voluptuous dreams, associated with a degree of sexual\r\nstimulation which is described as being actually painful. The woman\r\noften suffers greatly from these lascivious sensations. She complains\r\nthat she cannot understand how it is that she has become affected with\r\nsuch utterly undesired feelings. She becomes profoundly depressed.\r\nCoitus often gives no relief whatever; but many women thus affected\r\ndeclare, as _Fritsch_ points out, that by powerful, almost involuntary\r\nscratching, the stimulus is speedily subdued, and that for this reason\r\nthey are absolutely compelled to scratch. It will readily be understood,\r\nthat in this way persistent pruritus will arise, with local effects of\r\nscratching, and vulval eczema. According to the same author, in some\r\ninstances pruritus is due to great insufficiency of secretion, such as\r\noccurs in the endometritis atrophicans which he was the first to\r\ndescribe. This scanty secretion, as it passes over the external genital\r\norgans, gives rise to irritation and itching. Haemorrhoids also play a\r\npart in the etiology of pruritus.\r\n\r\n_Diseases of the Mammae._—The sympathy which in the earlier phases of\r\nthe sexual life—during the menarche, during pregnancy, and during the\r\npuerperium—so obviously exists between the breasts and the uterus, is\r\nseen also during the climacteric period. It now finds expression chiefly\r\nin the marked tendency to new growths in the mammae, a matter to which\r\nattention was already drawn by _Galen_. The commonest of these\r\nneoplasmata is carcinoma mammae, a disease which occurs chiefly during\r\nthe climacteric epoch. In the great majority of cases, cancer of the\r\nbreast is a primary disorder; in exceptional cases, however, the\r\ncarcinoma of the breast arises by metastasis from a cancer of the uterus\r\nor the ovary. Sometimes the breast tumour is preceded by Paget’s disease\r\nof the nipple. For several years the patient suffers from what appears\r\nto be a chronic dermatitis of the nipple, the areola mammae, and the\r\nsurrounding skin; but ultimately, and hardly ever before the\r\ncommencement of the menopause, carcinoma of the breast ensues.\r\n\r\nThe older statistical enquiries of _Birkett_, _Lebert_, _Scanzoni_, and\r\n_Velpeau_, showed that carcinoma mammae most commonly occurred between\r\nthe ages of 40 and 50 years, and next to that in frequency between the\r\nages of 50 and 60 years.\r\n\r\nA general hypertrophy of the mammary gland, affecting not only the\r\nenveloping and intra-lobular adipose and connective tissue, but also the\r\nproper glandular substance, is very rarely observed during the\r\nclimacteric period; but in the preclimacteric epoch and in the early\r\npart of the climacteric, we not uncommonly see a hyperplasia of the\r\nadipose tissue of the breast, either as a local manifestation of a\r\ndeveloping general obesity, lipomatosis universalis, or as a purely\r\nlocal excessive deposit of fat. In such circumstances, the mammae may at\r\ntimes be transformed into monstrous tumours.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Diseases of the Organs of Circulation._\r\n\r\nAmong the cardiac disorders of the menopause, the earliest and the\r\ncommonest is, in my own experience, the following. At the time of the\r\nmenopause, exceptionally not till after the complete cessation of\r\nmenstruation, but usually at the commencement of this period of life,\r\nsome time, that is to say, between the age of 40 and 50, either when\r\nmenstruation has become irregular, the intermenstrual interval having\r\nbecome longer or shorter than has hitherto been the case, or when the\r\ndischarge has become abnormal in character, a woman who has not before\r\nsuffered from any kind of cardiac disorder, will begin to complain of\r\nparoxysms of palpitation.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the attacks of palpitation occur in the absence of any\r\ndiscoverable exciting cause; in others, some trifling stimulus gives\r\nrise to them. They may arise when the patient is in any position,\r\nwalking, standing, sitting, or recumbent; sometimes even during sleep.\r\nThe subjective sensation aroused by the increased force and frequency of\r\nthe cardiac action is described as extremely distressing; it is\r\nassociated with a feeling of anxiety (Angst), with a sense of pressure\r\nin the chest, with forcible pulsation of the carotids and of the\r\nabdominal aorta; frequently also with a feeling of a rush of blood to\r\nthe head, with fugitive heats, and severe headache; sometimes towards\r\nthe end of the attack there is a sense of flickering before the eyes (as\r\nof muscae volitantes), tinnitus aurium, dizziness, and in rare cases\r\nactual syncope.\r\n\r\nObjectively, during the paroxysm, a notable increase in the frequency of\r\nthe heart’s action can be detected, the pulse-rate rising to 120 or even\r\n150 per minute. In most of my cases, the pulse throughout the attack\r\nremained strong, well-filled, and regular. Sphygmographic tracings taken\r\nduring the seizures showed a remarkably high pulse-wave, the ascending\r\nlimb of the curve rose rapidly and suddenly, the descending limb fell\r\nwith corresponding steepness and rapidity, and it reached an unusually\r\nlow level before the commencement of the dicrotic elevation, which\r\nlatter was exceptionally large; the predicrotic elevations, on the other\r\nhand, were but slightly developed. On auscultation, the tones of the\r\nheart were pure, but were louder than normal.\r\n\r\nSometimes during a paroxysm a sudden reddening of the face was\r\nnoticeable, extending often to the neck and the thorax. In the areas\r\nmentioned, vivid red patches would suddenly make their appearance,\r\ndisappearing more gradually after lasting a few minutes—this appearance\r\nwas associated with a burning sensation of the affected areas. In some\r\ncases during the paroxysm there was an outbreak of perspiration on the\r\nhead and the back.\r\n\r\nAssociated with these cardiac troubles of women at the climacteric we\r\nusually find a state of physical and mental disquiet; less common\r\nassociations are, an incapacity for regular work, sleep uneasy and much\r\ndisturbed by dreams, great general nervous irritability, or signs of\r\npassive congestion in various organs; occasionally there is oedema of\r\nthe lower extremities; the urine remains free from albumen.\r\n\r\nIn most of the cases of this nature which came under my own observation,\r\na certain plethora was noticeable; among women at the menopause, it was\r\nespecially the well-nourished, powerful, sanguine individuals, that were\r\nliable to palpitation of the heart. Direct examination of the blood\r\nsometimes showed a very high haemoglobin richness—110, 115, or even 120,\r\nas compared with a haemoglobin-richness of 93 in normal woman. Several\r\nof my patients presented the clinical picture of the plethoric form of\r\nlipomatosis universalis.\r\n\r\nIn all, during ten years, I observed 67 cases of paroxysmal tachycardia\r\nin climacteric women. The age distribution was the following:\r\n\r\n                     36 years of age        1 woman\r\n                     38 years of age        1 woman\r\n                     39 years of age        2 women\r\n                     40 to 45 years of age 37 women\r\n                     45 to 50 years of age 28 women\r\n                     Over 50 years of age   8 women\r\n\r\nFive of the patients were unmarried, three were married but childless,\r\nthe remaining 59 were parous women.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, women live in great dread of all manifestations of\r\nbodily disorder during the menopause; those who become affected with\r\nparoxysmal tachycardia are exceptionally anxious, and regard themselves\r\nas threatened by a “stroke.” This pessimistic view is however, by no\r\nmeans justified. These cardiac disorders may make their appearance some\r\ntime before the menopause, they may persist throughout the period during\r\nwhich menstruation is irregular, they may even endure for some time\r\nafter the total cessation of the flow—but serious consequences of this\r\nclimacteric tachycardia have never come under my observation. As regards\r\ntreatment of the disorder, I have seen very favourable results from the\r\nfollowing measures: The systematic employment of mild purgatives,\r\ncombined with suitable dietetic and hygienic regulations (bland diet,\r\nregular and strenuous exercise, cold ablutions, and wet compresses\r\nsurrounding the abdomen).\r\n\r\nWhen we enquire regarding the cause of the tachycardiac paroxysms\r\noccurring at the menopause, we must first of all bear in mind that in\r\nthe cases which have come under my own observation, the cardiac impulse\r\nwas powerful, the pulse strong and well-filled, that signs of general\r\nvasomotor disturbance (ardor fugax, etc.) accompanied the tachycardiac\r\nseizures,—hence we are led to infer that we have to do with a\r\nstimulation of the excito-motor nerve fibres, which would appear to be\r\ndue to the climacteric changes previously described as occurring in the\r\nfemale reproductive organs. This view receives support from the fact\r\nthat after oöphorectomy, when, as in the normal climacteric, atrophic\r\nprocesses occur in the internal reproductive organs, paroxysms of\r\nnervous palpitation are frequently observed. The same explanation\r\napplies to the fact that in women at the climacteric affected with these\r\ntachycardiac troubles, we frequently see in association therewith the\r\nsymptoms of uterine dyspepsia.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to these local anatomical changes in the reproductive\r\norgans, to which an etiological role must be assigned in the production\r\nof climacteric tachycardia, the irritable state of the accelerator\r\nnerves must also depend in part upon that general nervous\r\nhyperexcitability which is so often a characteristic feature of the\r\nclimacteric period in women, manifesting itself in manifold\r\nhyperaesthesias, hyperkinesias, neuralgias, and, in extreme cases,\r\nmental aberration. The sensory nerves are more irritable than in their\r\nnormal state, so that every stimulus acting upon them evokes a greater\r\ncentral effect than heretofore, and upon this ensues an exaggeration of\r\nvarious reflex manifestations, which appear altogether disproportionate\r\nto the strength of the exciting cause; among these disproportionate\r\nreflex effects, is to be numbered the tachycardia just described.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to the causes of climacteric tachycardia already\r\nenumerated, we have to take into consideration the results of recent\r\ninvestigations concerning the organo-therapeutic employment of the\r\nchemical constituents of the ovarian tissue; it would seem that when at\r\nthe menopause the ovaries undergo atrophy, so that their internal\r\nsecretion is no longer poured into the blood, the resulting alteration\r\nin the chemical constitution of that fluid gives rise to a disturbance\r\nof the vasomotor centre in the medulla oblongata.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the tachycardiac paroxysms appear to be connected with\r\nthe erotic excitement to which women are sometimes subject at the\r\nclimacteric, voluptuous crises and ejaculation occurring; it is possible\r\nthat in some of these cases masturbation plays a part.\r\n\r\nA second group of cardiac troubles occurring in climacteric women\r\nconsists of cases which are very common, but not often very severe. The\r\ncases in question depend upon the liability to an increased deposit of\r\nadipose tissue in the body at the time of the menopause, and in this\r\nconnexion the plethoric form of lipomatosis universalis almost\r\ninvariably predominates. It is a well-known fact that between the ages\r\nof 40 and 50 years women have an excessive tendency to obesity, and that\r\neven those women who have hitherto been extremely lean are apt to become\r\nquite plump at the climacteric period. Chiefly in consequence of this\r\nincreasing obesity, there occurs in climacteric women a series of\r\ncardiac troubles of very variable intensity. If the deposit of fat is\r\neffected very gradually, and if the obesity does not become extreme, it\r\nis only after vigorous bodily exercise, such as fast walking or going\r\nupstairs, and after meals, that the patient is troubled with a little\r\nshortness of breath and moderate palpitation; appetite, digestion, and\r\nsleep remain usually unaffected in cases of this degree of severity.\r\nDefinite attacks of cardiac asthma, and well-marked signs of cardiac\r\ninsufficiency affecting the entire circulatory system, will very rarely\r\noccur in such persons.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact, that the troubles which arise from fatty\r\ndeposits around the heart are in general far less severe in climacteric\r\nwomen than they are in obese men of corresponding age. This may be due\r\nto the circumstance discovered by _W. Müller_, in the course of his\r\ninvestigations on the proportions of the human heart, that in the\r\ndevelopment of general obesity, the pericardial fat increases\r\nproportionately to a greater extent in the male than in female. But in\r\nmy opinion the true explanation is to be found in the fact that\r\nvariations in the amount of fat in the body are normally far more\r\nextensive in women than in men; at puberty, during pregnancy, and during\r\nlactation, extensive though gradually effected changes in the amount of\r\nadipose tissue in various parts of the body occur, so that experience\r\nhas rendered the organism ready to adapt itself to the further changes\r\nthat take place at the climacteric—above all, the heart has become\r\ncompetent to meet very various demands upon its powers.\r\n\r\nOnly in women who from youth onwards have exhibited a marked tendency to\r\nobesity, and in whom at the climacteric age such obesity has become\r\nextreme, do the cardiac troubles attendant on the menopause become very\r\nsevere. In such persons, palpitation and shortness of breath occur on\r\nslight exertion, and attacks of cardiac asthma are frequent. In\r\nconsequence of the diminished propulsive power of the heart, circulatory\r\ndifficulties make their appearance in the most widely divergent venous\r\nareas; the forms most commonly met with are, varices in the veins of the\r\nlower extremities, permanent dilatation of certain of the small\r\nsuperficial veins of the skin, phlebectases of the rectal veins (i. e.\r\n“piles”), and ultimately we see the well-known series of symptoms of\r\nvenous engorgement—oedema of the feet, passive congestion of the lungs,\r\nalbumen in the urine, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen such cardiac troubles are present, the objective examination of the\r\nheart shows in the early stage no gross abnormality; at most the\r\nheart-tones seem somewhat weakened, with a moderate enlargement of the\r\narea of percussion-dulness, whilst the impulse is displaced a little\r\noutwards, and is weaker than normal. In some cases, however, a marked\r\ndulness on percussion over the sternum indicates an extensive deposit of\r\nfat in the mediastinal tissues. In the second stage of the fatty heart,\r\nwhen the symptoms have become more severe, we find a considerable\r\nenlargement of the area of cardiac dulness both in the vertical and the\r\nhorizontal extent; the cardiac impulse is diffused as well as feeble.\r\nThe sounds of the heart are usually pure but faint—in some cases they\r\nremain loud and clear. Exceptionally, a short blowing murmur is heard\r\nwith the first sound; and sometimes this sound is reduplicated.\r\n\r\nWhilst in the first stage the pulse is hardly abnormal, in the second\r\nstage, very various changes occur; often it is subdicrotic or dicrotic\r\nin character.\r\n\r\nIn the great majority of instances, in these cases of cardiac disorder\r\nat the menopause, provided a suitable dietetic regimen is early adopted\r\nand perseveringly carried out, we may give a hopeful prognosis.\r\n\r\nA third, less common but far more serious form of cardiac disorder\r\noccurring at the menopause, displays the well-known symptoms of cardiac\r\nfailure. Those thus affected are usually slightly built, delicate women,\r\nwho during the years of development suffered from chlorosis, who in\r\nadult life were troubled with anæmic symptoms, and in whom the menopause\r\nwas ushered in by very severe losses of blood; sometimes, again, they\r\nare women who throughout their sexual prime have been accustomed to\r\nmenstruate very abundantly, who have had numerous and severe deliveries,\r\nor who have had frequent miscarriages—it is in those who have thus been\r\nweakened by frequent and profuse haemorrhages, that the symptoms of\r\ncardiac failure ensue at the climacteric period. The women thus affected\r\nalso frequently suffer from palpitation of the heart; the pulse is\r\nabnormally frequent, small, low, and easily compressible, and sometimes\r\nintermittent or arrhythmical. The heart’s action is weak and devoid of\r\nenergy. The heart-sounds are usually obscure, and sometimes a systolic\r\nmurmur is audible. The patients are short of breath and are subject to\r\nattacks of cardiac asthma, not infrequently associated with angina\r\npectoris. In conjunction with these symptoms, we see signs of venous\r\ncongestion: sudden attacks of coldness in the hands and feet, often also\r\noedema of the feet; the urine at times contains albumen. The\r\nhaemoglobin-richness of the blood is always notably diminished. I need\r\nnot discuss in further detail the well-known symptoms of cardiac\r\ninsufficiency, and I need only insist that when these symptoms are met\r\nwith in women at the climacteric, it is of the greatest importance,\r\nalike from the prognostic and from the therapeutic standpoint, to make a\r\ncareful examination of the reproductive organs, so as to determine the\r\nexact source of the recurrent bleedings which usually constitute the\r\nprimary cause of the patient’s sufferings.\r\n\r\nIn several cases of this kind, I found that the haemorrhages were due to\r\na relaxation of the uterine tissues, and that this relaxation was itself\r\nreferable to intrapelvic circulatory disturbances, dependent upon\r\nobstruction in the vena cava inferior, whereby the venous return from\r\nthe pelvis was rendered difficult, and an engorgement of the uterine\r\nvessels was brought about.\r\n\r\nIn some instances of cardiac failure at the menopause, chronic\r\ninflammation within the pelvis is to blame for the menorrhagia upon\r\nwhich the cardiac failure depends. Often, again, the haemorrhages are\r\nreferable to vasomotor influences, such as are liable during the\r\nmenopause to affect various vascular areas. In other cases, the\r\nrecurrent bleeding is due to retroflexion of the uterus, to prolapse of\r\nthat organ, or to tumour, it may be myoma, polypus, or carcinoma.\r\n\r\nFinally, during the menopause, more especially in women in whom\r\nmenstruation has continued up to or beyond the fiftieth year, or in\r\nthose who have given birth to a large number of children or have lived\r\nlives of severe bodily exertion, cardiac troubles may arise dependent\r\nupon arteriosclerosis of the great vessels. The signs of such changes in\r\nthe walls of the bloodvessels are clearly marked: the cardiac impulse is\r\nheaving, the second sound of the heart is accentuated; the pulse is full\r\nand large, usually giving a very powerful blow to the examining finger,\r\nwhilst its sphygmographic tracing exhibits characteristic signs in the\r\nexceptional height and great distinctness of the first predicrotic\r\nelevation. The subjective troubles are in these cases very severe;\r\ndyspnoea and attacks of asthma or of vertigo are common, and sometimes\r\nalbumen may be found in the urine.\r\n\r\nWe may thus summarize the cardiac disorders met with at the menopause,\r\nand more or less directly dependent upon the changes undergone by the\r\nfeminine organism at that period of life:\r\n\r\n1. Paroxysmal tachycardia, a reflex neurosis due to the climacteric\r\nchanges in the ovaries.\r\n\r\n2. Nervous palpitation in women who were similarly affected at the time\r\nof the menarche, and in whom the trouble is merely the expression of a\r\nvery unstable nervous system, and one influenced with especial readiness\r\nby impressions proceeding from the reproductive organs.\r\n\r\n3. Cardiac disorder due to the obesity so commonly occurring as a part\r\nof the general metabolic changes of the menopause, but more particularly\r\ndependent upon a deposit of fat in the neighbourhood of the heart\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n4. Symptoms of cardiac failure, due to excessive losses of blood at the\r\nmenopause, either as an exaggeration at this time of menstrual\r\nprocesses, or as a result of some actual disease within the pelvis.\r\n\r\n5. Cardiac disorder in women in whom the menopause occurs at an\r\nunusually advanced age, and dependent upon arteriosclerosis.\r\n\r\nParticular consideration must be given to a symptom not infrequently\r\noccurring in association with the cardiac troubles of climacteric women,\r\nand referable to the circulatory disturbances characteristic of this\r\nperiod of life, namely, vertigo. The attack in some cases comes on\r\nwithout apparent cause, in others it occurs on the performance of some\r\nunusual movement or the adoption of some peculiar posture (stooping, or\r\nthe like); the patient is suddenly seized with a sense of rotation,\r\neither of his own body, or else of his visible and palpable environment;\r\nwith this is associated a sensation of disturbance of equilibrium,\r\nflickering before the eyes (muscae volitantes), tinnitus aurium,\r\npalpitation of the heart, increased frequency of the pulse, which may be\r\neither full or small, redness or pallor of the face, coldness of the\r\nhands and feet, muscular twitchings, a sense of great anxiety, and the\r\noutbreak of a cold perspiration. The vertigo occurs in paroxysms,\r\nusually of short duration—a few minutes to a quarter of an hour. It is\r\nespecially plethoric and obese women who are liable at the climacteric\r\nto suffer from this disorder.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar condition is described by _Tilt_ under the name of\r\n“pseudo-narcotism,” as frequently occurring in climacteric women. _Tilt_\r\nindeed states that in 500 such women, he noted its presence in no less\r\nthan 277.\r\n\r\nMany hypotheses have been promulgated to account for the vertigo that so\r\nfrequently occurs at the menopause. Both anæmia and hyperaemia of the\r\nbrain have been assumed as causes, alike dependent upon the irregularity\r\nof menstruation, which is supposed to have a reflex influence upon the\r\ncerebral circulation. Others regard the vertigo as a climacteric\r\nneurosis, since it occasionally occurs before the menstrual\r\nirregularities begin, and in such cases a reflex disturbance of the\r\ncerebral circulation cannot be supposed to have arisen. According to\r\n_Matusch_, climacteric vertigo is a manifestation of epilepsy—an\r\nexplanation which has been often extended to include all the menstrual\r\npsychoses. _Windscheid_ believes that in many of the cases the vertigo\r\nis to be explained by the existence of arteriosclerotic changes in the\r\nblood vessels, such as are already by no means rare at the age at which\r\nthe menopause usually occurs; whilst in other cases, he believes, the\r\nvertigo is to be regarded as one of the symptoms of a nervous disorder.\r\nThat in any case the vertigo is dependent in some way upon the changes\r\nthat occur in the reproductive organs at the climacteric period, is\r\nshown by the fact that after the final cessation of menstrual activity\r\nthe patient as a rule ceases to suffer from this symptom.\r\n\r\nTo the circulatory disturbances consequent upon the menopause we must\r\nalso refer ardor fugax, fugitive heat, the sudden rushes of blood to\r\nwhich women are prone at this period of life.\r\n\r\nThe cardiac troubles of the menopause are seen especially in women in\r\nwhom the cessation of menstruation occurs quite suddenly, and in those\r\nin whom menstrual activity ceases at an exceptionally early age. It\r\nwould seem that in such cases, owing to the continuance of periodic\r\nmaturation of the graafian follicles associated with congestion of the\r\nintrapelvic organs, in the absence of the periodic relief to that\r\ncongestion afforded by the menstrual flux, there results a summation of\r\nstimuli, whereby the accelerator nerves of the heart are very powerfully\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nThus, I had under my care a lady from Smyrna 36 years of age. She had\r\nbegun to menstruate when 12 years of age and menstruation was always\r\nscanty; she married when 15 years old, and finally ceased to menstruate\r\nwhen 19 years of age; she was sterile, and no abnormality could be\r\ndetected on physical examination of her reproductive organs. Every month\r\nshe suffered from severe paroxysmal tachycardia, with dyspnoea, rush of\r\nblood to the head, perspiration of the face, etc.\r\n\r\nIn another case, that of a woman 45 years of age, menstruation, hitherto\r\nregular, was suddenly suppressed, during the flow, in consequence of a\r\nsevere fright. The next month the flow failed to appear at the usual\r\ntime, but instead the patient was affected with severe cardiac distress,\r\naccompanied by sudden sensations of heat in the face, palpitation of the\r\nheart, and vertigo; these symptoms lasted for several days, and since\r\nthen have recurred at intervals of three or four weeks.\r\n\r\nThe cardiac troubles of the menopause are seen with especial frequency\r\nin women who were affected with similar disturbances at the time of the\r\nmenarche. Experience clearly shows that a certain connexion exists\r\nbetween the manifestations that accompany the commencement of sexual\r\nactivity, and those that accompany the decline and extinction of that\r\nactivity; and a physician will rarely be mistaken if he bases on the\r\nfact that the general health was or was not seriously affected at the\r\nage of puberty, a prognosis that the course of the climacteric will be\r\nan unfavourable or a favourable one, respectively. In other words, in\r\nwomen whose nervous system is an unstable one, and in those with\r\nhereditary predisposition to the occurrence of cardiac disorder, the\r\nchanges that take place in the reproductive organs both during the\r\nmenarche and during the menopause, are likely during these vital phases\r\nto arouse reflex disturbances of the cardiac functions. The facts thus\r\nnoted are analogous to those observed by _Potain_, who distinguishes a\r\npeculiar form of chlorosis, occurring in delicate individuals at the age\r\nof puberty, and, though apparently cured during the menacme, recurring\r\nin its primitive severity at the time of the menopause.\r\n\r\nAgain, women with a sanguine and erethistic temperament are more\r\ninclined to suffer from cardiac troubles at the menopause than women of\r\na tranquil temperament and those endowed with an unimpressionable\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\nFinally, elderly virgins, women who have for many years lived in chaste\r\nwidowhood, sterile women, women who have married shortly before the\r\nmenopause, or who at this time have recently been delivered, are all\r\nmore inclined to the cardiac troubles of the climacteric period than\r\nwomen whose sexual life has been of a less abnormal character.\r\n\r\nIn the literature of the subject, we find numerous references to the\r\nfact that among the disorders of the climacteric, circulatory\r\ndisturbances play a part. But a full and accurate account of these\r\ndisorders is lacking alike in the literature of gynecology and in that\r\nrelating to diseases of the heart—and this is true even of the most\r\nrecent publications.\r\n\r\nAmong striking individual cases, one recorded by _Moon_ may be mentioned\r\nhere, a case of tachycardia consequent upon a sudden menopause: “In a\r\nwoman 35 years of age the menses were suppressed owing to chill; the\r\npulse-frequency increased from 80 to 200, without any apparent change in\r\nthe heart or its valves; the symptom lasted for several days, when\r\nmenstruation became once more established, and the pulse-frequency fell\r\nagain to the normal.”\r\n\r\n_Tilt_ expresses the opinion that the heart is but little involved in\r\nthe disturbances of the climacteric, his experience coinciding with that\r\nof _Quain_. _Boerner_ and _Glaevecke_, on the contrary, describe the\r\nheart troubles of the climacteric in terms very similar to those\r\nemployed by myself.\r\n\r\n_A. Clément_ describes a peculiar form of disturbance of the functions\r\nof the heart at the climacteric period, to which he gives the name of\r\nCardiopathie de la Ménopause, and of which he has seen four cases. The\r\nage of his patients varied from 46 to 50 years. They were all vigorous\r\nwomen, free from hysterical symptoms, and they had never suffered from\r\nrheumatism or from any functional disturbance of the heart. In all these\r\ncases the cardiac disorder occurred at a time of life when menstruation\r\nstill continued, but had already become somewhat irregular. Usually the\r\ntrouble in question makes its first appearance during the flow, or, if\r\noccurring independently of menstruation, becomes more severe at that\r\ntime. Prior to the development of the actual heart symptoms, we observe\r\nfor a time, two or three months it may be, signs of general exhaustion\r\nand weakness. Then occurs an attack of palpitation of the heart, rapidly\r\nsucceeded by faintness, sense of precordial anxiety, and dyspnoea.\r\nDuring repose the patient does not usually suffer from any difficulty in\r\nbreathing, but sleep is apt to be disturbed by paroxysms of palpitation\r\nand severe precordial anxiety. As the disease advances, dyspnoea is\r\nobserved on the slightest exertion. Ultimately, the symptoms mentioned,\r\npalpitation, precordial anxiety and dyspnoea, become permanent, but are\r\nless severe when the patient is at rest. Constant now is also the\r\nfeeling of weakness and faintness, which from time to time increases to\r\nactual syncope with complete loss of consciousness, and coldness of the\r\nentire surface of the body. Examination of the heart gives negative\r\nresults. The cardiac impulse is a little stronger than normal; the\r\ncardiac rhythm may be either regular or irregular, but actual\r\nintermission of the beats does not occur. The heart-sounds are pure,\r\nthere is no murmur; the first sound, if altered at all, will be\r\nstronger, not weaker than normal. Neither swelling of the jugular veins\r\nnor venous pulsation is to be observed. The most striking symptom of\r\nheart affection, indeed the only positive physical sign, is the great\r\nincrease in the frequency of the heart’s action, the pulse rate often\r\nbeing as much as 150 or 160 per minute, and in addition weak and\r\nsomewhat variable in strength. At the outset of the disease, no oedema\r\nof the lower extremities is to be observed, and it only appears after\r\nthree or four attacks. In all the patients the extreme pallor of the\r\nface is a striking feature. An increased quantity of urine is\r\neliminated. The course of the disease is characterized by a series of\r\nsuccessive paroxysms, separated by periods of almost complete remission.\r\nAt first, these remissions last for a month or two, but they gradually\r\nbecome shorter and shorter, whereas the duration of the attacks\r\ncontinually increases, until it is as much as seven or eight days. At\r\nthis stage, disturbance of digestion ensues, the appetite is lost, and\r\nthe general vigour declines. Recovery ultimately occurs, but very\r\ngradually. _Clément_ refers the disease to a profound disturbance of the\r\ncardiac innervation through the sympathetic nerves, but believes that\r\nanæmia constitutes a contributory cause of the cardiac disorder.\r\n\r\n_Kostkewitsch_ has made observations regarding the influence of the\r\nclimacteric upon previously existing heart-disease, and has thereby been\r\nled to conclude that the influence is unfavourable. The functional\r\ndisturbances of the cardio-vascular apparatus which commonly accompany\r\nthe menopause, readily lead, should organic heart-disease exist, to the\r\nonset of severe cardiac weakness, which may have a rapidly fatal\r\ntermination. In 55.5% of the women who enter the climacteric period with\r\norganic disease of the heart, the menopause gives rise to a failure of\r\ncompensation. Such failure of compensation is especially likely to occur\r\nin women suffering from valvular insufficiency; it is least probable in\r\ncases of arteriosclerosis without valvular defect. The symptoms of\r\ndefective compensation—dilatation of the heart, increased frequency of\r\nthe pulse, arrhythmia cordis, etc.—are manifested especially during the\r\nmenstrual flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Diseases of the Digestive Organs._\r\n\r\nThe congestions which, as we have already pointed out, constitute the\r\npathological basis of the majority of the disorders of the climacteric,\r\nmanifest themselves in the abdominal organs in the well-known form of\r\nplethora abdominalis, chronic venous congestion of the gastric and\r\nintestinal mucous membrane, hyperaemia of the liver, hyperaemia of the\r\nmucous membrane of the bladder, catarrh of the bladder, distension of\r\nthe haemorrhoidal veins, and the various symptoms dependent upon these\r\nseveral forms of congestion.\r\n\r\nBleeding from the haemorrhoidal veins and chronic diarrhoea are two of\r\nthe troubles proceeding from the above mentioned congestion of the\r\nintra-abdominal vessels, which occur so frequently during the\r\nclimacteric period that since the days of antiquity they have been\r\nregarded as critical manifestations of the menopause, the object of\r\nwhich is to afford a vicarious outlet for the menstrual flux, now become\r\nirregular and intermittent. It can, indeed, be readily understood that a\r\ndischarge of blood and an increased secretion from the mucous membrane\r\nof the lower part of the intestine may, if not too violent, exercise a\r\nfavourable influence upon the congestive states of the climacteric, by\r\nrelieving the distension of the abdominal vessels—by a local\r\nblood-letting which regulates the disordered circulation. In this way,\r\neven though we have ceased to regard it as a “critical” manifestation,\r\nhaemorrhoidal bleeding, accompanied by an increased secretion from the\r\nintestinal mucous membrane, may at the climacteric period have a\r\ndistinctly favourable influence upon a woman’s general condition.\r\n\r\n_Hippocrates_ already in his aphorisms pointed out the salutary effect\r\nof epistaxis and of diarrhoea in women suffering from suppression of the\r\nmenses. Other authors have assigned a critical significance to\r\ndiarrhoeas occurring at the climacteric, and have warned against their\r\nsuppression. According to _Tilt_, diarrhoea occurred in 12% of all women\r\nof this age coming under his observation; in 4% of the climacteric\r\nwomen, this diarrhoea recurred at regular monthly intervals, whilst in\r\n8%, the recurrence was irregular. In 500 women during the climacteric\r\nage, _Tilt_ observed the following abdominal disorders:\r\n\r\n       Swollen haemorrhoids in                          62 cases\r\n       Diarrhoea in                                     60 cases\r\n       Enduring disturbance of the biliary secretion in 56 cases\r\n       Bleeding haemorrhoids in                         24 cases\r\n       Intestinal haemorrhages in                       20 cases\r\n       Icterus in                                        6 cases\r\n       Hæmatemesis in                                    4 cases\r\n       Monthly intestinal haemorrhages in                2 cases\r\n       Monthly bleeding from haemorrhoids in              1 case\r\n\r\nIn my own observation, constipation is more frequent in climacteric\r\nwomen than diarrhoea, the constipation being also a symptom of abdominal\r\ncongestion. Sometimes, when diarrhoea occurs, it is really secondary to\r\nconstipation. The accumulation of the faecal masses stimulates the\r\nintestinal mucous membrane, and gives rise to a profuse aqueo-mucous\r\nsecretion; the firm faecal masses are then liquefied, the intestinal\r\nwall is lubricated, and the constipation gives place to diarrhoea\r\nlasting perhaps for several days. This is the explanation of many cases\r\nin which there is a periodic recurrence of diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nDyspeptic disturbances are rarely absent during the climacteric period.\r\nMost often we see disordered appetite, sluggish digestion, pyrosis,\r\neructation, at times nausea and retching, and actual vomiting of a\r\nwatery or bilious fluid. Occasionally, an abnormal sensation of hunger\r\nfollows each meal, associated, however, with a feeling of distension of\r\nthe stomach. A very distressing symptom is an excessive formation of gas\r\nwithin the intestine. At times such meteorism is extreme, and it then\r\ngives rise to very severe abdominal pain. The gas is evacuated slowly\r\nand with difficulty, the patient is compelled to loosen all her\r\nclothing; more especially after a meal she is compelled to take off her\r\nstays and undo all the bands of her petticoats and skirt. At the same\r\ntime we see difficulty in breathing and tachycardia. Such an\r\naccumulation of gas within the abdomen may give rise to serious errors\r\nin diagnosis, the swelling being attributed to pregnancy or to abdominal\r\ntumour.\r\n\r\nNoteworthy also at the time of the menopause is the occurrence of\r\nvomiting, either as an isolated symptom, or in association with some\r\nother well-known climacteric disorder. When this vomiting is associated\r\nwith some unmistakable form of excessive secretory activity\r\n(hyperhydrosis, etc.), we may readily suppose that the vomiting is due\r\nto undue secretory activity on the part of the gastric mucous membrane.\r\nAn excessive production of gastric juice, perhaps altered in quality as\r\nwell as quantity, combined with some other disorder of gastric\r\ninnervation (hyperaesthesia, or hyperkinesia) will sufficiently explain\r\nthe occurrence of the sometimes excessive vomiting, even though in many\r\nof the cases there may be no reason to suppose that there exists any\r\nprimary stimulation of the vomiting centre. In other cases, however, it\r\nis probable that the trouble is really due to a primary disorder of that\r\ncentre; and a careful study of the clinical features of the case will be\r\nneeded to show how far there may be associated with this other disorders\r\nof gastric innervation (_Boerner_).\r\n\r\nDisturbances of the biliary secretion, icterus of greater or less\r\nseverity, are by no means rare manifestations of the abdominal\r\ncongestion of climacteric women, and such disorders have also been\r\nregarded as vicarious processes originated by the cessation of the\r\nmenstrual flux (_Aran_, _Bennet_, _Henoch_, and others.) _Frerichs_ also\r\nhas pointed out that with the cessation of menstruation at the\r\nclimacteric we not infrequently observe swelling of the liver, which\r\ndisappears when, after a considerable period, the menstrual flow\r\nrecurs—a sequence of symptoms which may be repeated again and again for\r\na considerable time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Diseases of the Skin._\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic symptom of disorder of the skin met with at the\r\nclimacteric period—one which, indeed, may be said to be never absent—is\r\nardor fugax, fugitive heat; and scarcely less common is hyperhydrosis,\r\nan excessive secretion of sweat. Almost invariably, at the commencement\r\nof the menopause, women complain of a feeling of burning heat, rising up\r\nfrom the breast to the face; and if they are kept under observation we\r\nsee from time to time a sudden redness of the face, and sometimes also\r\nof the neck and chest, associated with the outbreak of a thin\r\nperspiration. Moreover, in nearly all climacteric women, we notice an\r\nincreased secretion of sweat over the whole surface of the body, and at\r\ntimes this secretion is extremely profuse.\r\n\r\nIn association with these symptoms we often see the hyperaemic processes\r\nin the skin known by the names of erythema and roseola, taking the form\r\nof larger or smaller bright red patches, which are most frequently seen\r\non the sides of the neck, the front of the chest, and the face.\r\n\r\nIn many women, at the menstrual periods, when the flow has become scanty\r\nor has already entirely ceased, we observe the occurrence of eczematous\r\neruptions, which have for this reason received the distinctive name of\r\nclimacteric eczema. In the majority of these cases, the eczema does not\r\nmake its appearance until the regular menstrual flux has completely\r\nceased to occur; and in the less common cases in which the flow persists\r\nafter the climacteric eczema has begun, menstruation is rarely regular,\r\nbut has begun to exhibit the variability and disorder characteristic of\r\nthe time of the menopause. If the eczema comes on after the menopause is\r\ncompletely established, it usually appears in from six to twelve months\r\nafter the cessation of the flow; but in some cases, the eruption appears\r\nvery soon after the menopause, whilst in others, its onset may be\r\ndelayed for as long as four or five years. Climacteric eczema is\r\nobstinate, and shows no tendency to spontaneous cure. With regard to the\r\nlocalization of the eruption, _Bohn_ found that in three-fourths of the\r\ncases it affected the hairy scalp and the ears; _Rayer_ and _Hebra_ also\r\nstate that the eczema of the menopause is most frequently seen in these\r\ntwo situations, whilst the next commonest site for the eruption is the\r\nface. As regards other parts of the skin, it is only that of the\r\nextremities that is ever affected by this disease, especially the hands\r\nand the fingers, less often the forearms or the backs of the feet; it\r\nnever appears on the trunk. With regard to the types of eczema occurring\r\nin connexion with the menopause, we see almost exclusively the squamous\r\nand the weeping forms of the disease.\r\n\r\nIn general, at the climacteric period, the skin is extremely sensitive,\r\nand devoid of powers of resistance to outward noxious influences.\r\nAlternations of dampness and dryness or of heat and cold readily give\r\nrise to redness, infiltration, and the formation of scales and fissures\r\nof the skin; sometimes this occurs merely after cold ablutions. These\r\nacute stages of swelling, redness, and vesiculation of the skin, readily\r\npass on into chronic and obstinate dermatitis.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently, during the climacteric, as during the menarche,\r\ninflammation of the sebaceous glands occurs, acne, at times accompanied\r\nby seborrhœic manifestations. In other cases, we see disfigurations of\r\nthe face in consequence of vascular dilatations, especially on the nose\r\nand on the adjoining portions of the cheeks, rosacea, in which disease\r\nalso there is associated inflammation of the sebaceous glands. Another\r\ndisorder of the skin of the face which is greatly dreaded by women at\r\nthis time of life, owing to the unsightly appearance it produces, is the\r\ndevelopment of sinuous dilatations of some of the superficial vessels,\r\nat times associated with connective tissue proliferation in the form of\r\nred or violet-coloured painless nodules.\r\n\r\nAn extremely distressing affection, and one which is especially apt to\r\nattack women during the change of life, is the previously mentioned\r\npruritus genitalium. The itching is in some cases confined to the\r\nexternal genital organs, whilst in others it extends into the interior\r\nof the vagina; also it may pass backwards over the perineum, and on into\r\nthe gluteal folds. In some cases, some local pathological condition will\r\nbe found to account for the disorder: catarrh of the vagina or of the\r\ncervix uteri; displacements, inflammations, or new-growths of the\r\nuterus; anomalies of the ovary, the bladder, or the urethra. _Cohnstein_\r\ndraws attention to a circular hyperplasia of the vaginal portion of the\r\ncervix, occurring during the menopause, and, “owing to the vascular\r\ndilation by which it is characterized, possessing close analogies with\r\nhaemorrhoids;” the worst symptom of this affection is pruritus. That in\r\nthese cases the pruritus is actually dependent upon the “haemorrhoidal\r\nhyperplasia” of the portio vaginalis, _Cohnstein_ considers to be proved\r\nby the fact that, whilst local applications give no more than momentary\r\nrelief to the itching, this symptom is completely relieved by the\r\nabstraction of blood from the cervix. But in addition to such cases as\r\nthese, we have from time to time to deal with patients suffering from\r\nviolent genital pruritus during the climacteric period, in whom we shall\r\nvainly seek for any local pathological changes, to the cure of which our\r\ntherapeutic zeal may be directed. Analogy with some other disorders of\r\nthe climacteric leads us to conclude that in these cases also we have to\r\ndo with an idiopathic neurosis (_Boerner_).\r\n\r\nThe frequent recurrence of pruritus vulvae leads ultimately to the\r\nformation of nodules and papular eruptions.\r\n\r\nMany authors state that they have observed the frequent occurrence of\r\nerysipelas during the climacteric period; others assert that\r\nfurunculosis, prurigo, urticaria, and herpes zoster, are seen with\r\nespecial frequency at this period of life.\r\n\r\n_Tilt_, in his 500 cases of women at the climacteric age, made the\r\nfollowing observations:\r\n\r\n201, or 40.2%, suffered from heats and tendency to perspiration.\r\n\r\n2, or 0.4%, suffered from monthly recurrence of periods of perspiration.\r\n\r\n 84, or 16.8%, suffered from profuse perspirations.\r\n 13, or 2.6%, suffered from cold sweats.\r\n 14, or 2.8%, suffered from dry heats (dry flushes).\r\n 186, or 37.2%, remained free from such attacks of heat or perspiration.\r\n\r\n_Krieger_ gives as an example of the “occurrence of new troubles” at the\r\nchange of life, furunculosis; so also does _Boerner_. “The\r\ndiscolouration of the face, occurring usually in connexion with\r\npregnancy or with diseases of the reproductive organs, and known as\r\nchloasma uterinum,” has been seen by _Cohnstein_, during the climacteric\r\nperiod, “chiefly in cases in which, owing to some degree of failure of\r\ngeneral nutrition, the skin has been thrown into folds.” _Wilson_\r\nregarded prurigo and eczema as the commonest skin-diseases of the\r\nclimacteric period; whilst _Boerner_ draws attention to a connexion\r\nbetween climacteric conditions and the outbreak of herpes zoster.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Disorders of Metabolism._\r\n\r\nAmong the disorders of metabolism to which women are especially prone at\r\nthe climacteric period, we must in the first place allude to obesity\r\n(lipomatosis universalis), and to gout (arthritis urica).\r\n\r\nNumerous observations have shown us that the time of the change of life,\r\nthe period between the ages of 40 and 50 years, is the one especially\r\nfavourable in women to the extensive deposit of fat in the tissues.\r\n\r\nIn 200 cases of great obesity (lipomatosis universalis) in women, in\r\nwhich I instituted enquiries regarding the age at which an excessive\r\ndeposit of fat in the tissues had first been noticed, I obtained the\r\nfollowing results:\r\n\r\n             In early childhood in                 19 cases\r\n             At the age between 15 and 20 years in 30 cases\r\n             At the age between 20 and 30 years in 45 cases\r\n             At the age between 30 and 40 years in 52 cases\r\n             At the age between 40 and 50 years in 54 cases\r\n             At ages over 50 years                  0 cases\r\n\r\nWe learn from these figures that it is between the ages of 40 and 50\r\nyears that there is the greatest tendency in women for the accumulation\r\nof fat; but that as early as between the ages of 30 and 40 years this\r\naccumulation may in many instances begin. Speaking generally, there is\r\nin women an obvious connexion between the development of obesity and the\r\nstate of the reproductive functions, inasmuch as at puberty, during the\r\npuerperium, and above all at the climacteric, there is a special\r\ntendency to the accumulation of fat in the subcutaneous tissues. At the\r\ncommencement of the menopause, it is more especially in the abdominal\r\nwall, the breasts, and the buttocks, that we witness the deposit of fat.\r\nIn the abdomen, owing to the thickening of the subcutaneous tissues and\r\nof the great peritoneal folds—especially of the great omentum—a marked\r\nprotrusion occurs, whilst the umbilicus becomes more deeply hollowed,\r\nand ultimately funnel-shaped. In some instances, the deposit of fat\r\naround the navel favours the occurrence of umbilical hernia. After an\r\nartificial menopause, induced by oöphorectomy, it has also been noticed\r\nin from 42 to 52% of the cases that a marked general deposit of fat has\r\noccurred, affecting especially the breasts and the buttocks.\r\n\r\nThis obesity in climacteric women, not only impairs to a serious extent\r\ntheir good looks, but brings in its train a number of troubles, and\r\ngives rise to manifold morbid manifestations, and among these, changes\r\nin the heart, which may readily threaten the patient’s life. In\r\nconsequence of extensive fatty deposits in the myocardium, associated\r\nwith actual fatty degeneration of the muscular fibres, cardiac\r\ninsufficiency ensues, with all its distressing and disastrous\r\nconsequences. It is further necessary to insist upon the fact that\r\nobesity during the climacteric very definitely favours the occurrence of\r\nmenorrhagia.\r\n\r\nOn examining 282 women, 5 years after the complete cessation of the\r\nmenstrual flow, _Tilt_ found that\r\n\r\n              121 had become stouter than before,\r\n               71 were unchanged in this respect, and that\r\n               90 were thinner than formerly.\r\n\r\nAlike in the third class and in the first were a very large proportion\r\nof women in whom the change of life had entailed much illness and\r\nsuffering; but in the first class, the women who had been thus affected\r\nhad at that time lost weight, and only in the latter half of the\r\nclimacteric period, when their troubles had become less severe, had the\r\ncondition of embonpoint made its appearance.\r\n\r\nPassing now to the consideration of arthritis urica in women at the\r\nclimacteric, it is worthy of mention that _Hippocrates_ was so much\r\nstruck by the association that he went so far as to deny that gout\r\noccurred at all in women before the menopause. The fact of the matter is\r\nthat whilst women are in general less disposed than men to the\r\noccurrence of gout, the tendency of women to this disease during the\r\nclimacteric period is so marked, that at this epoch of life the disease\r\nis far more common in women than it is in men of corresponding age.\r\n\r\nIt is in obese women, with a soft, white, and lax integument, with a\r\npallid, somewhat bloated countenance, a poorly developed muscular\r\nsystem, extensive varicosities of the veins of the legs, marked\r\ndyspeptic troubles, and habitual constipation, that during the\r\npreclimacteric and climacteric periods, gout is especially apt to make\r\nits appearance. It is then characterized by the following symptoms. From\r\ntime to time the woman suffers from tearing or shooting pains in the\r\njoints, lasting at first a short time only, and returning after longer\r\nor shorter intervals. With the frequent return of the pains, the\r\naffected joints become swollen; and finally the patient suffers from the\r\ncharacteristic attacks of acute gouty arthritis, with the well-known\r\nconsecutive symptoms of this affection.\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations of _Geist_, during the climacteric period,\r\n28 women suffer from gout as compared with 4 men of corresponding age.\r\n_Tilt_ publishes the following figures showing the mortality of women\r\nfrom gout in England:\r\n\r\n                 At ages from 20 to 30 years  56 women\r\n                 At ages from 30 to 40 years 121 women\r\n                 At ages from 40 to 50 years 291 women\r\n\r\n                 At ages from 50 to 60 years 152 women\r\n                 At ages from 60 to 70 years 104 women\r\n\r\nRegarding diabetes mellitus during the menopause, _Lawson Tait_, who\r\nmaintained there was a distinct form of climacteric diabetes, asserted\r\nthat this disorder of metabolism was less severe, and runs a longer\r\ncourse during the climacteric period than at other times of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Diseases of the Nervous System._\r\n\r\nThe disturbances of the nervous system that occur during the climacteric\r\nperiod, manifest themselves chiefly in the form of hyperaesthesia and\r\nhyperkinesia. The sensory nerves appear to me for the most part to be\r\nmore irritable than normal, inasmuch as every stimulus by which they are\r\naffected arouses a comparatively greater sensation, and gives rise to an\r\nexcessive reaction in the sphere of consciousness. The cutaneous\r\nhyperaesthesia of climacteric women is shown in very various ways, the\r\ncommonest being the anomaly of sensation which gives rise to the symptom\r\nknown as pruritus, characterized by paroxysms of itching in more or less\r\nextensive areas of skin, with consecutive nutritive changes in the\r\naffected portions of the integument. The commonest and the most\r\ndistressing form of this disorder during the menopause is pruritus\r\nvulvae.\r\n\r\nIn addition to such manifestations of cutaneous hyperaesthesia,\r\nvasomotor disturbances of the skin are of frequent occurrence,\r\ncharacterized by redness, rise of temperature, and sometimes the\r\nformation of nodules in the affected areas. Almost without exception, at\r\nthe outset of the climacteric period, and sometimes also in the\r\npreclimacteric epoch, women complain of a very distressing feeling of\r\nfugitive heat in various portions of the surface of the body, manifested\r\nobjectively by the rapid appearance and no less rapid subsidence of a\r\nred colouration of the skin of the face, the neck, and the chest. Such\r\nfugitive heats are due to disturbances of vasomotor innervation giving\r\nrise to sudden variations in the amount of blood passing through the\r\nvessels of the affected areas of skin.\r\n\r\nHardly less frequent during the climacteric are the sensations of\r\nimaginary movement which give rise to the subjective symptom known as\r\nvertigo. Often in women at this time of life it occurs quite without\r\napparent cause, but in other cases on the performance of some unusual\r\nmovement or the adoption of some unusual posture; there is a sudden\r\nperception of rotatory movement, either of the patient’s own body or\r\nelse of her visible and palpable environment. With this feeling of\r\ndisturbed equilibrium, there is often associated optical and auditory\r\nhyperaesthesia, flickering before the eyes (muscae volitantes), tinnitus\r\naurium, painful sensations in the head and more especially in the\r\noccipital region, nausea, vomiting, sense of anxiety, cold sweats,\r\nmuscular twitchings, alternating redness and pallor of the face, and\r\ncoldness of the feet. The vertigo occurs in paroxysms, usually of short\r\nduration, varying from one to fifteen minutes. It is especially in\r\nplethoric and obese women that climacteric vertigo occurs.\r\n\r\nA peculiar form of this climacteric vertigo is that described by _Tilt_\r\nunder the name of “Pseudo-Narcotism” of climacteric women, characterized\r\nby a sense of swimming movements, uncertainty in the gait, vacancy of\r\nexpression, a confused look in the eyes like those of a drunken person,\r\nand a kind of mental stupor which the patient cannot shake off without\r\nconsiderable effort. The women thus affected state that they feel as if\r\nthey had had too much to drink, as if something had gone to their heads;\r\nindeed their great fear is that they will be supposed to be intoxicated\r\nby those who see them walking in the streets; they feel even that they\r\nmust refuse to receive the visits of their acquaintances if they wish to\r\npreserve their reputation for sobriety. They suffer also from great\r\ndrowsiness, from a disagreeable sense of weight or pressure in the head,\r\nfrom a feeling “as if the brain was clouded, or needed to have some\r\ncobwebs swept away.” They feel a disinclination to both mental and\r\nphysical exertion, and their memory and all other intellectual powers\r\nare impaired.\r\n\r\n_Boerner_ maintains that the attacks of vertigo so frequently occurring\r\nat the menopause are in a minority of cases only dependent upon\r\nhyperaemic states (arising from the cessation of the menstrual flow); on\r\nthe contrary, he believes that the cause more often lies in hysteria, in\r\nchronic disorder of the digestive tract, or, finally, in anæmia. In his\r\nopinion, vertiginous attacks dependent upon cerebral anæmia are very\r\ncommon indeed during the climacteric period, and even for a long time\r\nafterwards; and he believes that their nature is often completely\r\nmisinterpreted.\r\n\r\nAnother very unpleasant indication of disordered nervous function during\r\nthe climacteric period is the sleeplessness that is so common at this\r\ntime of life. Women who during the day time feel comparatively well,\r\nsuffer at night, sometimes periodically at exactly the same hour night\r\nafter night, from a state of general restlessness, and for this reason\r\nare unable to obtain the sleep for which they long. They throw\r\nthemselves uneasily from side to side of the bed, or wander restlessly\r\nabout the room, and before long, owing to this want of sufficient\r\nrepose, become greatly depressed.\r\n\r\nAmong the neuroses of the sensory apparatus, the various kinds of\r\ncutaneous neuralgia are less common than during the menarche and the\r\nmenacme; but on the other hand, in my personal experience at any rate,\r\nthe visceral neuralgias are commoner, more especially cardialgia and\r\nhypogastric neuralgia. Of the superficial neuralgias, hemicrania and\r\nintercostal neuralgia are those which occur most often during the\r\nclimacteric period.\r\n\r\nDuring the change of life, hemicrania most commonly occurs in typical\r\nassociation with menstruation; or, if the flow has already ceased, the\r\nattacks of hemicrania recur at what should be the menstrual periods.\r\nThis affection is characterized by the paroxysmal occurrence of a severe\r\nboring pain in the side of the head, more often the left side than the\r\nright, affecting the temporal, the parietal, or the occipital region, or\r\nthe entire side of the calvaria at once, usually accompanied with\r\nredness and local rise of temperature of the painful part; the duration\r\nof the paroxysms varies in different cases from one or two to many\r\nhours; with the pain are associated chilliness, nausea, exhaustion, and\r\na severe feeling of general malaise.\r\n\r\nOf the intercostal neuralgias, one form deserves especial mention in\r\nthis connexion: I refer to mastodynia, which is both physically and\r\nmentally one of the most distressing affections to which women are\r\nsubject during the climacteric period. For a middle-aged woman suffering\r\nfrom mastodynia—the “irritable breast” of _Cooper_—almost invariably\r\nfeels assured that these pains localized in the breast and its immediate\r\nvicinity are indications of a commencing cancer of the breast; and it is\r\nan exceedingly difficult matter, in most cases, to convince her that her\r\nfears are without foundation. In this manner, partly in consequence of\r\nthe directly depressing effect of the pains, which are commonly\r\nintensely severe, and partly owing to the disturbance of mind produced\r\nby the belief that an incurably fatal disorder has begun, I have in\r\nseveral instances seen cases of profound melancholia originate.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Windscheid_, among the enduring painful sensations of the\r\nclimacteric period, pains in the lower extremities are of somewhat\r\nfrequent occurrence. Day after day the patient suffers from distressing\r\ntearing or lancinating sensations in the legs; the trouble is\r\ninsusceptible of more exact description, but is none the less a very\r\nsevere one. In addition to the lower extremities, the back, the spinal\r\ncolumn, and more particularly the lumbo-sacral region, are often the\r\nseats of incessant pain. In the thoracic region of the back, the pain is\r\nusually diffuse; when confined to the spinal column, however, it is\r\ncommonly limited to individual vertebrae, the spinous processes of those\r\naffected being also sensitive to pressure. The sacral pains may in some\r\ncases predominate to such an extent, that it is on this ground alone\r\nthat the patient comes to seek medical advice. The sacrache is equally\r\nsevere when the patient is standing, sitting, or recumbent; it often\r\nradiates into the lower extremities. _Boerner_ draws attention to the\r\nfact that in many cases the pains in the sacrum or higher up in the back\r\nmay be due to excessive tension of the abdominal parietes in consequence\r\nof the great accumulation of fat. Among motor manifestations,\r\n_Windscheid_ draws especial attention to a certain degree of weakening\r\nof the muscles of the lower extremities. Although on examination no\r\nabnormality can be detected, fatigue and functional incapacity, more\r\nespecially in the lower extremities, ensue in a manner altogether\r\ndisproportionate to the exertion, so that the patient is most unwilling\r\nto take even a short walk, to go upstairs, etc. In pronounced cases, the\r\npatient will never go out walking without carrying a campstool, so that\r\nshe can sit down to rest directly she begins to feel fatigued. In\r\nassociation with these disorders of motility we most commonly see the\r\nabove-mentioned painful sensations in the legs, and by these latter the\r\nfunctional incapacity of the lower limbs is of course increased.\r\nWeakness of the arms is far less frequently observed; but occasionally\r\nwe hear complaints that on the performance of domestic duties,\r\nneedlework, etc., which previously could be carried out quite easily,\r\nthe arms and hands are now speedily fatigued, and rendered functionally\r\nincapable.\r\n\r\nOf the visceral neuralgias, cardialgia is by no means rare during the\r\nclimacteric period; the pain is concentrated in the epigastric region,\r\nbut not infrequently radiates to the back and to the chest. Hypogastric\r\nneuralgia is also not uncommon, pain in the lower part of the abdomen,\r\nassociated with a sense of pressure in the bladder, the uterus, and the\r\nrectum, and sometimes radiating to the thighs and to the region of the\r\nhaemorrhoidal nerves.\r\n\r\nThe opinion expressed by several authorities, that the menopause favours\r\nthe occurrence of cerebral apoplexy, must, according to _Windscheid_, be\r\nreceived with caution; we have to remember that with advancing years\r\natheromatous changes are apt to occur in the cerebral arteries, and it\r\nis to these changes, altogether independently of the climacteric, that\r\ncerebral haemorrhage is due. It appears, however, to be a fact that the\r\nmenopause favours the onset of progressive paralysis. According to\r\n_Jung_, 60%, and according to _von Krafft-Ebing_, 27%, of women affected\r\nwith paralysis were first affected in this way during the climacteric\r\nperiod. _Von Krafft-Ebing_ explains this occurrence by the fact that\r\nduring the menopause fluxions of vasomotor origin are common, and these\r\nserve as the starting point of transudative processes.\r\n\r\nAmong the neuropathic manifestations of the climacteric period we must\r\nreckon the at times excessive increase of the sexual impulse. We have\r\nalready insisted upon the fact that the sexual impulse is not normally\r\nextinguished in women at the time of the cessation of menstruation; on\r\nthe contrary, sexual desire commonly persists long after the menopause,\r\nand on this fact is largely dependent the frequency with which elderly\r\nwomen espouse quite young men. But in some cases, the sexual impulse is\r\nenormously enhanced during the climacteric period, and the patient\r\nexperiences paroxysms of intense voluptuous sensation, associated with\r\nmanifestations of abnormal reflex and psychical reaction, with increased\r\nfrequency of the pulse and the respiration, emotional excitement, it may\r\nbe loss of consciousness, and even general convulsions. Some of these\r\ncases of disordered sexuality occur in those previously affected with\r\npruritus vulvae et vaginae.\r\n\r\nMore particularly _Guenceau de Mussy_ and _Boerner_ have described cases\r\nof such excessive libido sexualis during the climacteric period,\r\nvoluptuous crises with pollutions, occurring independently of any\r\nexternal cause; the women thus affected have a continued succession of\r\nerotic ideas, they experience an itching and burning sensation in the\r\ngenital organs, and from time to time this culminates in a paroxysm of\r\nsexual feeling, with orgasm, and increased secretion from the glands of\r\nthe vulva.\r\n\r\n_Boerner_ has observed that characteristic variations in the libido\r\nsexualis commonly occur at the climacteric period. Not infrequently at\r\nthis time the sexual desire becomes greatly diminished in intensity, or\r\neven entirely disappears; more often, however, the desire persists\r\nthroughout this epoch; finally, in many instances, the desire undergoes\r\nan increase, at times to a degree amounting to positive torment. The\r\nfirst of these changes, the decline in the intensity of the sexual\r\ndesire, harmonising as it does with the general extinction of the sexual\r\nfunctions at the change of life, might have been expected to be the\r\nnormal occurrence. And it is a fact that in many cases characterized by\r\nan increase of libido sexualis at the climacteric epoch, _Boerner_ found\r\nthat there existed anatomical abnormalities in the reproductive organs\r\n(fibromata, flexions, etc.). Be this as it may, an increase in the\r\nintensity of sexual desire, as long as that increase is not altogether\r\nexcessive, may be regarded as one manifestation of the visceral\r\nhyperaesthesias so general at this time of life. In the excessive\r\ndegrees of this affection, however, those in which at times the sexual\r\ncrisis is associated with general convulsions, we must, with _Romberg_,\r\nrecognize the existence of a direct neuralgic state of the spermatic\r\nplexus. It is especially before the commencement of an actual menstrual\r\nperiod, or before a due period which fails to occur, that during the\r\ncritical years complaint is made of this state of excessive sexual\r\ndesire and sensibility; and in many instances the trouble begins at the\r\nvery first appearance of the menstrual irregularities which foreshadow\r\nthe menopause.\r\n\r\n_Windscheid_ draws attention to the fact that occasionally the nervous\r\nmanifestations may make their appearance prior to the occurrence of any\r\nmenstrual irregularity, so that it is by the nervous disturbance that\r\nthe woman or her physician is warned of the approach of the menopause.\r\n“When the menstrual anomalies begin,” continues _Windscheid_, “that is\r\nto say, at the commencement of the climacteric, the nervous troubles may\r\nhave already attained their maximum and have begun to decline in\r\nintensity. As a general rule, however, the appearance of the nervous\r\ndisturbances coincides with the commencement of the menstrual\r\nirregularities. It may happen that these disturbances are intensified\r\nwith each recurring period, but this is not the rule. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, we may observe that when menstruation occurs with excessive\r\nfrequency—a by no means rare phenomenon at the outset of the\r\nclimacteric—the nervous disturbances become more severe; and especially\r\nis this the case when the unduly frequent flow is also abnormally\r\nprofuse, as indeed often happens.” The manifestations of climacteric\r\nneurosis occur, as _Windscheid_ rightly insists, most frequently in the\r\nsphere of the psyche. “We observe a change in the disposition, which\r\nusually becomes more excitable. A woman previously calm and composed\r\nbecomes irritable, inclined to emotional disturbance and to fits of\r\ntemper, and unable to bear with equanimity the pinpricks so frequent in\r\ndaily life, and especially in the daily life of a housewife. In other\r\ncases, however, the disturbance of the psyche is rather in the direction\r\nof depression: we observe a kind of spiritual inhibition, a deficiency\r\nof vital energy, an indifference to things which formerly gave pleasure.\r\nAlmost always, also, complaints of loss of memory are among the\r\nindications of such depression. To these intellectual anomalies are\r\nsuperadded disturbances of sensibility. There is excessive sensitiveness\r\nto bright lights, loud noises, and strong odours. Frequently, also, in\r\nsuch cases, we see great intolerance to alcohol, quite small doses\r\ngiving rise to extremely disagreeable sensations in the head.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Climacteric Psychoses._\r\n\r\nThe powerful influence which the changes occurring at the climacteric\r\nperiod has in the origination of psychoses, has long been recognized,\r\nthe menopause, in fact, being a favourable soil for the cultivation of\r\nmental disease. The fact is embodied in medical terminology, since many\r\nauthors speak of “climacteric insanity,” assuming that the psychoses of\r\nthis period of life present a definite and characteristic clinical\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier part of this work it was shown that the process of\r\nmenstruation has generally a marked effect upon the psyche, and that\r\ndisturbances of menstrual activity are competent to exercise a\r\npathogenic influence upon the mental condition of the woman who suffers\r\nfrom them; still greater and more intense is the influence of the\r\ncessation of menstrual activity, with its powerful and widespread\r\ndisturbance of the entire organism, with its destructive oscillations of\r\nequilibrium in the spheres of sensation, perception, ideation, and\r\nvolition. It is easy to understand how the rarer recurrence of\r\nmenstruation, the occasional profuse losses of blood, the complete\r\nsuppression of menstruation, the conditions peculiar to the climacteric\r\nperiod of stasis and congestive hyperaemia of the brain, are competent,\r\nmore especially in hereditarily predisposed persons, to give rise to the\r\ndevelopment of psychoses; whilst in those already suffering from mental\r\ndisorder, the menopause will be likely to bring about an aggravation in\r\ntheir symptoms. At this time of life, also, we have to take into account\r\nthe effect of certain ideational influences to which allusion has\r\nalready been made, the thought that womanhood and its joys are passing\r\naway for ever, and the fear of the dangers attendant upon this critical\r\nperiod of the change of life. A French proverb alludes to “le diable de\r\nquarante ans, si habille à tourmenter les femmes.”\r\n\r\nMental disorder will be more likely to ensue at the climacteric period\r\nin those women whose nervous systems have always been unduly irritable,\r\nand in those affected with hereditary predisposition to insanity.\r\nFurther, it is more likely to occur in those in whom the menopause takes\r\nplace quite suddenly, in a catastrophic manner, than in those in whom\r\nthe climacteric proceeds gradually, and unaccompanied by any stormy\r\nmanifestations in the organism at large.\r\n\r\nIt is not in my opinion possible to recognize any specific form of\r\nmental disorder peculiar to the climacteric period, but nevertheless the\r\npsychoses occurring at this time of life do exhibit certain striking and\r\ncharacteristic features, more especially in this respect, that states of\r\nmental depression with melancholia predominate, whilst erotic influences\r\nare manifest in their etiology. In the slighter forms, volition and\r\nideation are unaffected, and the trouble manifests itself in the form of\r\nhypochondriacal moods, associated with bodily troubles. In more severe\r\ncases we see emotional depression, states of anxiety, limitation of the\r\npowers of conception and judgment, indecisiveness, low-spiritedness, and\r\napathy; or on the other hand, restlessness, an inclination to continued\r\nmoving about, the eager pursuit of continually varying occupations,\r\nloquacity, etc.; finally, if the mental disorder becomes still more\r\nsevere, hallucinations, delirium, paroxysms of intense excitement, and\r\nin exceptional instances, fully developed mania.\r\n\r\nAs with regard to the other disorders attending the climacteric, so also\r\nin respect of the climacteric psychoses, women who have been or are\r\nmarried, who have had a reasonable number of children, and have been\r\naccustomed to a sufficiency of sexual activity, are more favourably\r\nsituated, are far more immune, than women whose sexual circumstances\r\nhave been the opposite of those mentioned, who have had one or two\r\nchildren only, who have indulged in intercourse only when protected from\r\npregnancy by the use of preventive measures, or have remained sexually\r\nunsatisfied, and, finally, women who have never married, and those who\r\nfor many years prior to the commencement of the menopause have lived in\r\nchaste widowhood. In “old maids,” to the somatic effects of sexual\r\nabstinence (or in some cases of abnormal sexual gratification), are\r\nsuperadded the effects of the intellectual and emotional recognition of\r\na wasted life. Again, it by no means rarely comes under our observation\r\nthat women who in youth, at the time of the menarche, suffered from\r\npsychical disturbances, are apt once again to be affected with\r\ntransitory mental disorder at the change of life. Once, however, the\r\nmenopause is completely at an end, a condition of mental quiescence is\r\nas a rule established, and then it may happen that previously existent\r\nmental disorders undergo amelioration; but on the other hand we have in\r\nall cases to reckon with the possibility that they may take an\r\nunfavourable turn in the direction of the development of senile\r\npsychoses.\r\n\r\nOf considerable interest is the fact, first pointed out by _Glaevecke_,\r\nand subsequently confirmed by other observers, that in cases of\r\nartificial menopause, melancholic mental disturbances not infrequently\r\nfollow the operation, in some instances so severe as to lead to\r\nweariness of life and actual suicide; and in general, after the\r\nartificial induction of the menopause, psychical disturbances are by no\r\nmeans rare, and are sometimes very severe. Such disturbance of the\r\nmental balance is seen after oöphorectomy especially in women who are\r\nstill comparatively young, and whose sexual powers are still in a ripe\r\nstate; whereas when the operation is performed in women of a more\r\nadvanced age, whose ovaries were already nearly or completely\r\nfunctionless, no psychopathic changes are likely to ensue. In women\r\nbelonging to the former category, the same etiological influences come\r\ninto operation as in the physiological menopause, the patient, that is,\r\nis affected by the psychical influences of the removal of the\r\novaries—not only by the cessation of menstruation and the disappearance\r\nof the internal secretion of the reproductive glands, leading to a\r\ndisturbance of the physical equilibrium, but also by the intellectual\r\nrecognition of the loss of sexual potency, and a consequent disturbance\r\nof the mental balance.\r\n\r\nIn _Schlager’s_ opinion the climacteric has a potent influence in\r\npromoting the development of psychical disturbances in women, even when\r\nthe involution occurs at the normal age. The course of these\r\ndisturbances is as follows: soon after the commencement of the process\r\nof involution, when for a few months already the menstrual periodicity\r\nhas been irregular, or the flow has been unduly profuse, a change of\r\ndisposition makes its appearance, at first hardly noticeable, but after\r\na little time manifesting itself clearly in the form of an increase in\r\nirritability. The woman finds fault with everything and everybody,\r\nbecomes mistrustful, suspicious, full of complaints, imagines that the\r\nmost insignificant annoyances are due to intentional slights; at the\r\nsame time she complains of continued sleeplessness, palpitation, various\r\nindescribable sensations, and of headache. Occasionally, congestions of\r\nthe head occur, with alarming dreams, and the moodiness may increase\r\ngreatly; in this condition three such patients of _Schlager’s_ were\r\nimpelled to attempts at suicide. _Schlager_ further draws attention to\r\nthe fact that in 22 cases known to him in which suicide was performed or\r\nunsuccessfully attempted by women, in eleven of these the patient was at\r\nthe climacteric age. He believes that the most important etiological\r\ninfluence in the production of climacteric mental disorder in such cases\r\nis the sudden suppression of menstruation. In the majority of these\r\ninstances, the mental disorder takes the form of mania; exceptionally,\r\nhowever, the form of chorea or of catalepsy.\r\n\r\nBy _Tilt_ the following forms of “climacteric insanity” are\r\ndistinguished: delirium, mania, hypochondriasis, melancholia, impulsive\r\ninsanity, and perversion of the moral instincts. The same author\r\npublishes the following table showing the age incidence in 1,320 cases\r\nof mental disorder in women, from which it appears that during the age\r\nof the menopause, a very considerable number of the cases originate, but\r\nthat after the change of life comparatively few cases occur.\r\n\r\nIn these 1,320 cases the women were:\r\n\r\n              Under 15 years of age in        9 instances\r\n              Over 15 and under 20 years in  61 instances\r\n              Over 20 and under 25 years in 216 instances\r\n              Over 25 and under 30 years in 223 instances\r\n              Over 30 and under 35 years in 217 instances\r\n              Over 35 and under 40 years in 218 instances\r\n              Over 40 and under 45 years in 162 instances\r\n              Over 45 and under 50 years in 153 instances\r\n              Over 50 and under 55 years in 122 instances\r\n              Over 55 and under 60 years in  57 instances\r\n              Over 60 and under 65 years in  55 instances\r\n              Over 65 and under 70 years in  27 instances\r\n\r\n_Fuchs_ tabulated the ages of 26.300 insane persons. Reducing his\r\nresults to the ratios per 10,000, he obtained the following results:\r\n\r\n                                            Women.

Among 235 women suffering from\r\ndementia, a moiety had first come under treatment during the climacteric\r\nage. The same author published the following data regarding the\r\nage-incidence of insanity in the case of 6.713 female patients:\r\n\r\n               At ages under 20 years          348 cases\r\n               Between the ages of 20 and 25   563 cases\r\n               Between the ages of 25 and 30   727 cases\r\n               Between the ages of 30 and 40 1,607 cases\r\n               Between the ages of 40 and 50 1,479 cases\r\n               Between the ages of 50 and 60   954 cases\r\n               At ages above 60 years        1,035 cases\r\n\r\n_Matusch_ found that among 551 women suffering from mental disorder,\r\nthere were:\r\n\r\n                    At ages  0 to 10 years   9 cases\r\n                    At ages 10 to 20 years  73 cases\r\n                    At ages 20 to 30 years 140 cases\r\n                    At ages 30 to 40 years 114 cases\r\n                    At ages 40 to 50 years 107 cases\r\n                    At ages over 50 years   38 cases\r\n\r\nAccording to _von Krafft-Ebing_, among 858 insane women, there were\r\nabout 60 in whom the disorder of the mind appeared to depend upon the\r\ninfluence of the climacteric, and in 25 of these there was hereditary\r\npredisposition to mental disease.\r\n\r\nFrom _Kowalewski’s_ interesting work on the psychoses of the\r\nclimacteric, we quote the following:\r\n\r\n“In women, the climacteric has a distinct influence upon the mental\r\nlife, and that influence is strongly manifested more especially in cases\r\nin which during the age of puberty mental disturbance had previously\r\nbeen noticed. The mental condition in which women approach the change of\r\nlife is a very variable one, and it is one largely dependent upon the\r\ncircumstances in which the active years of the sexual life have been\r\npassed. In some cases, a woman has been so fortunate as to marry early\r\nand from affection, and her whole married life has been passed without\r\ndisturbance; her labours have not been exhausting, and her children have\r\nenjoyed good health; all have passed through the years of childhood\r\nwithout untoward incident, and their development has been a happy and\r\nsuccessful one; in a word—everything has gone well with her and hers.\r\nSuch a woman will give thanks to God for the rare felicity she has\r\nenjoyed; and quietly, patiently, and with understanding will endure the\r\ninevitable end of her sexual life. For such a woman, more especially if\r\nshe comes of a healthy stock, the changes which occur in her\r\nreproductive organs at the epoch of the climacteric, need not entail any\r\nserious shock to her nervous system, nor need they form the culture\r\nground for morbid manifestations in her nervous system or in her mind.\r\nEven if any anomalies in nervous working should occur, it will be such\r\nonly as are aroused by the disturbance of the normal menstrual rhythm;\r\nin such cases, they will rarely prove of a serious or enduring\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n“But look, on the other hand, upon this picture. A woman has married\r\nwithout affection and from pure necessity. Her husband has been a\r\ndrunkard, and rough and unfaithful. She has had a great many children,\r\nher labours have been tedious and difficult and accompanied with severe\r\nlosses of blood. Some of the children fell sick and died; those that\r\nsurvived proved idle, good-fornothing, and a burthen. The family life is\r\ndominated by quarrelsomeness, disorder, and insufficiency of means. The\r\nmother is affected with some chronic disorder of the reproductive\r\norgans, and is hardly ever out of the doctor’s hands. After 25 or 30\r\nyears of a life of this kind, the woman enters upon the change of life.\r\nPhysically exhausted, weary of life, never having known happiness, after\r\nan existence full of trouble and wretchedness, with nothing joyful\r\neither in her memories of the past or in her prospect of the future—the\r\nchief hope of such a woman is that her troubles may soon end with her\r\nlife. Where the soil is thus physically and mentally exhausted, the\r\ndevelopment of a neurosis or a psychosis is only too probable on the\r\nmost trifling exciting cause. Her life seems of so little worth, that\r\nthoughts of suicide are likely to be very near at hand. Thus, when the\r\nclimacteric alterations in the reproductive organs are superadded,\r\nmelancholia is very likely to supervene. When, however, the case is\r\ncomplicated by hereditary predisposition to insanity, and by the\r\noccurrence of actual degenerative changes in the central nervous system,\r\ninstead of the passive depression of melancholia, we shall rather see\r\nthe ideas of persecution of paranoia. As an actual fact, these two\r\npsychoses, melancholia and paranoia, are the commonest forms of mental\r\ndisorder at this period of a woman’s life.\r\n\r\n“These are the two extremes in woman’s mental state at the time when the\r\nphysical changes of the climacteric period begin in her reproductive\r\norgans. It will, of course, be readily understood that between these two\r\nextremes lies a series of combinations any one of which may in\r\nindividual cases occur.\r\n\r\n“The conditions of life during earlier years have thus a strong\r\ndeterminative influence in the production of mental disorder; and not\r\ninfrequently in these conditions alone shall we find the efficient cause\r\nof the mental degeneration. At times, the memories of her own life have\r\nin a woman at the climacteric age so serious an effect, that these\r\nmemories alone constitute the causal agent of the development of a\r\npsychosis, or at least so influence the soil as to make it a suitable\r\nculture-ground for the development of mental disorder, the actual\r\nexciting cause of the pathological state being a disturbance of the\r\nordinary menstrual rhythm.\r\n\r\n“In considering the mental condition of women at the outset of the\r\nclimacteric period, we must not forget those who are called ‘old maids.’\r\nIn their youth these maidens also have had their ideals, their hopes,\r\ntheir plans, and their sorrows. They also had a natural impulse to love\r\nand to be loved in return; they hoped to become wives and mothers. But\r\nlife has failed to fulfil their hopes and their wishes, and their\r\nlongings have remained unsatisfied. Some of them have taken up their\r\ncross without murmuring, and have devoted their talents, their\r\nintelligence, and their love to the service of those nearest to them.\r\nBut others make an active protest against fate in the form of vindictive\r\nfeelings towards their environment, of quarrelsomeness,\r\nscandal-mongering, etc. Here we see contrasted the two principal types\r\nof such women. On the one hand are those who devote their intellectual\r\nand spiritual powers to the service of society; these are unselfish\r\nsisters-of-mercy, untiring medical women, invaluable school-teachers and\r\ngovernesses, fanatical political agents, etc. Such as these have ceased\r\nto live for themselves. In the fullest sense of the words, they mortify\r\nthe flesh, and guide their conduct by lofty moral principles. They have\r\nkilled their sexual life, and they remain for ever virgins—both morally\r\nand physically. If, owing to a pathological inheritance, faulty\r\nconditions of life, exhausting illnesses, etc., a psychosis develops,\r\nthe hallucinations and delusions from which they suffer very rarely\r\nassume a sexual character, nor are they of a degrading type. The sexual\r\nside of life seems, in fact, be they sane or insane, to have undergone\r\ncomplete atrophy. They suffer from simple melancholia with stupor, or\r\ntheir insanity takes a religious turn, but very rarely indeed has it an\r\nerotic character.\r\n\r\n“Very different is it with old maids of the second type. They are\r\ndissatisfied with life, irritable, quarrelsome, envious, and malicious.\r\nThey are spiteful and revengeful, gossips and scandalmongers, boast of\r\ntheir own chaste and innocent lives, and never forgive any real or\r\nimaginary attempt upon their spotless virtue. At the same time they\r\nnever lose hope for the future, and are full of imaginary love-affairs,\r\nin which they pass through scenes by no means chaste or innocent; they\r\ndo not shrink from self-abuse and the abnormal gratification of the\r\nsexual needs, in which the lacking partner in the sexual act is supplied\r\nby the imagination. Under the influence of such abnormal conditions of\r\nlife, these women frequently become affected by nervous disorders;\r\nmigraine, neuralgia, cephalalgia, nervous depression, rachialgia,\r\ndebility, anæmia, diseases of the reproductive organs, etc. Thus, when\r\nthey enter the climacteric age, the soil is fully prepared for the\r\ndevelopment of mental disorder, which in such individuals is often\r\ncharacterized by hallucinations of sexual sensation and perception,\r\nerotic visual and auditory hallucinations, delusions of similar\r\ncharacter, increased sexual irritability, a search for abnormal means of\r\nsexual gratification, a propensity to obscene speech and conduct, etc.\r\n\r\n“Mental disorder is so common during the climacteric period, that the\r\nterm ‘climacteric insanity’ has now become established in the literature\r\nof mental alienation. In almost all the textbooks of the subject we find\r\nan allusion to this form of mental disease, but there is no real ground\r\nfor _Maudsley’s_ assumption that there is a climacteric insanity sui\r\ngeneris. At the climacteric, very various forms of mental disorder may\r\noccur—paranoia, melancholia, and mania; the only common feature in the\r\nattacks, owing to which they are classed as ‘climacteric insanity’ being\r\nthe fact that the final determining cause in each case is the onset of\r\nthe change of life. In fact, this period is not without influence upon\r\nthe manifestation of the disease—its stamp is imprinted upon the\r\nclinical picture, it endues the disease with certain characteristic\r\nfeatures—but still, the peculiarities common to the cases of mental\r\ndisorder occurring at this time of life in women are not so great as to\r\njustify us in describing them as a separate variety of psychosis.”\r\n\r\nAccording to _Kowalewski_, this so-called climacteric insanity is met\r\nwith in two principal forms: in many cases the mental disorder recurs in\r\nperiodic paroxysms, associated either with the commencement of the\r\nmenstrual flow, or having the periodicity of menstruation after the flow\r\nhas already ceased to appear; in the other class of cases the psychosis\r\nhas no direct connexion with menstruation, and is dependent upon the\r\njoint influence of all the manifestations of the climacteric period.\r\nCases belonging to the former class have been distinguished by _Bartel_\r\nas “climacteric pseudomenstrual insanity.”\r\n\r\nThe psychoses dependent upon the climacteric influences may, according\r\nto _Kowalewski_, appear in almost all the known forms of mental\r\ndisorder: precordial anxiety, melancholia, mania, amentia, paranoia,\r\netc.; and although they exhibit no features which are absolutely\r\ncharacteristic, or which, as already said, enable us to distinguish a\r\nspecific “climacteric insanity,” yet they all bear a common imprint by\r\nmeans of which we are enabled to detect in their causation the influence\r\nof this critical period of life. Thus, precordial anxiety occurs in\r\nparoxysms having a more or less regular periodicity, corresponding with\r\nthat of the expected menstruation. The same feature is observable in the\r\nperiodic exacerbations of hysterical and epileptic paroxysms. Often,\r\nalso, there occur at this time sudden changes in the emotional\r\ndisposition and in the character, in one direction or the other, without\r\nthe development of actual melancholia or mania. The melancholia of the\r\nclimacteric period occurs chiefly in married women, more especially in\r\nthose whose circumstances are unhappy; and it is often manifested by\r\nattempts at suicide.\r\n\r\nMania is comparatively rare at the climacteric period; when it does\r\noccur, it commonly assumes a sexual form—sexual impulses,\r\nhallucinations, and delusions, and obscene conduct. Such manifestations\r\nare seen most often in widows, in “old maids” whose morals are not above\r\nreproach, and, speaking generally, in those whose sexual needs have\r\nremained partially or completely ungratified, and in those who have\r\ngreatly erred in the conduct of this side of life. Amentia also occurs\r\nat this time of life; rarely in maniacal form, more frequently in\r\nassociation with menstruation as a periodic psychosis, or as a\r\ncontinuous disorder of mind with exacerbations corresponding to the\r\nmenstrual periods; it is often characterized by pronounced eroticism.\r\n\r\nMuch more frequent during the climacteric period is the occurrence of\r\nparanoia, as _Kowalewski_ rightly insists. It is most often met with in\r\n“old maids” with psychopathic predisposition. The imagination of such\r\nindividuals is always concentrated upon men; they imagine that men in\r\ngeneral, but more particularly certain individuals of the opposite sex,\r\nare continually regarding them, making eyes at them, making signs to\r\nthem, in some way or other striving to attract their attention. The most\r\nordinary and invariable forms of polite intercourse are regarded by\r\nthese women, whose powers of observation are morbidly stimulated, as\r\nbeing indications of a special “attention” paid to themselves. They\r\npersecute these men with their own attentions, and imagine that it is\r\nthe men who are persecuting them. Often this morbid mental state is\r\nassociated with sexual malpractices, masturbation, etc. Not rarely, such\r\ndegenerates are affected with lascivious dreams. Often they experience\r\nhallucinations of sexual perception in the form of supposed assaults on\r\ntheir virginity. All these states are apt speedily to develop into a\r\ncondition of general suspiciousness and ideas of persecution. The ideas\r\nof persecution assume a peculiar form, one especially characteristic of\r\nthe climacteric period. The patients believe that a man, often\r\npersonally unknown to them, and perhaps living in another town, enters\r\ninto spiritual and bodily intercourse with them. These relations are\r\nsupposed to be effected in most cases by means of spiritualism,\r\nhypnotism, or electricity. The patient importunes the man in question\r\nwith letters, supposes herself to be legally united with him, and not\r\ninfrequently wishes to give him the pleasure of paying her bills and\r\nproviding her with money. It is a very common occurrence for a Catholic\r\npriest to be worried by such a woman, her delusion being grounded upon\r\nthe fact that the priest is supposed to assume an exceptionally intimate\r\nspiritual relationship with members of his flock. The patient with ideas\r\nof persecution often herself becomes an actual persecutor, not only\r\npestering her victim with innumerable letters, but in her jealousy\r\nmaking “scenes” whenever she can encounter him, and sometimes giving\r\nrise to serious scandal. With such a mental state we often see\r\nassociated sexual hallucinations and delusions; the patient believes\r\nherself to be pregnant, imagines herself to have been violated, or to be\r\nliving in carnal intercourse with a man—some one, it may be, with whom\r\nshe is not even acquainted. Medical men are especially apt to suffer\r\nfrom the accusations of such women, whom they may have examined in\r\nprivate in entire ignorance of the patient’s mental condition.\r\nFrequently, such ideas of sexual persecution are associated with\r\nparoxysms of violent nymphomania, and in this way also the unwary\r\nphysician may find himself placed in an extremely unpleasant position.\r\nIt occasionally happens in such patients that abnormalities of the\r\nsexual instinct arise, and they begin to feel desire towards individuals\r\nof their own sex.\r\n\r\nSuch delusions of persecution by means of hypnotism, spiritualism, the\r\ntelephone, etc., in association with sexual delusions and nymphomania,\r\nare so frequent during the climacteric period, that they may be regarded\r\nas pre-eminently constituting climacteric insanity. Frequently some old\r\nhysterical state underlies this form of mental disorder.\r\n\r\nThus these peculiar manifestations of eroticism must be regarded as the\r\ndistinctive characteristics of climacteric insanity and more\r\nparticularly of climacteric paranoia. A second characteristic of\r\nclimacteric insanity is, according to _Garat_, the marked development of\r\njealous emotions and delusions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these fully developed psychoses, there occur in\r\ndegenerates at the climacteric age paroxysms of impulsive insanity in\r\nthe form of dipsomania, kleptomania, pyromania; exhibitionism;\r\nirresistible impulse to suicide, homicide, infanticide, etc. Such\r\nparoxysmal impulsive manifestations are, according to _Kowalewski_,\r\ncommonly associated with menstrual disturbances; they occur most\r\nfrequently at the due dates of menstruation when the flow fails to\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and sixty-nine cases of climacteric psychosis were\r\nclassified by _Matusch_ as follows:\r\n\r\n Melancholia                                                    36 cases\r\n Mania                                                           2 cases\r\n Melancholia passing on into paranoia                           28 cases\r\n Melancholia passing on into secondary dementia                 17 cases\r\n Paranoia                                                       43 cases\r\n Neurasthenia during the climacteric period followed by mental\r\n   disorder                                                     19 cases\r\n Neurasthenia prior to the climacteric period, followed by\r\n   mental disorder during the climacteric period                10 cases\r\n Apoplexy, cerebral abscess, dementia                            6 cases\r\n Epilepsy                                                        2 cases\r\n Alternating insanity                                            3 cases\r\n Paralytic dementia                                              5 cases\r\n\r\n_Von Krafft-Ebing_ classified 60 cases of climacteric psychosis as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                Melancholia                      4 cases\r\n                Alternating insanity              1 case\r\n                Acute delirium                    1 case\r\n                Primary insanity:\r\n                  _a._ With primordial delirium 36 cases\r\n                  _b._ Paralytic dementia       12 cases\r\n\r\nThe prognosis in cases of climacteric psychosis is regarded by\r\n_Kowalewski_ as unfavourable; unfavourable vital conditions are\r\nassociated with retrogressive metamorphosis of the tissues, hence mental\r\ndisorder arising at this time of life is hardly less serious than that\r\ndue to actual degeneration of cerebral tissues. Indeed, according to\r\n_Schüle_ there is during the climacteric period an especial danger of\r\nthe development of atrophic cerebral processes (Encephalitis\r\natheromatosa) with apoplectic and epileptic seizures. _Schlager_ also\r\nregards the prognosis of climacteric insanity as unfavourable; but\r\n_Merson_, on the other hand, observed among women suffering from\r\nclimacteric psychoses a recovery rate of over 50%. On previously\r\nexistent psychoses in women, the onset of the climacteric exercises in\r\nmost cases an unfavourable influence, and very exceptionally only at\r\nthis time do we observe the cure or remission of a chronic mental\r\ndisorder to occur. _Kowalewski_ has seen cases of chronic mania in which\r\na cure was obtained at the climacteric period; a somewhat excessive\r\nexcitability and inclination to violence remained, however, as vestiges\r\nof the former insanity. _Matusch_, keeping under observation 60 women\r\naffected with chronic mental disorder as they attained the climacteric\r\nperiod, noticed that in 14 instances the mental condition changed for\r\nthe worse at this period, whilst in 13 the character of the mental\r\ndisease underwent a change, excitement giving place to apathy and\r\ndementia. _Griesinger_ had earlier pointed out that at the time of the\r\ncessation of menstruation there would occasionally occur amelioration,\r\nand even cure, of a previously existing chronic mental disorder; more\r\noften, however, the influence of the menopause was an unfavourable one,\r\na hitherto changeable and irritative form of mental disease becoming\r\ntransformed into chronic insanity with inalterable delusions, or into\r\ndementia. The course of mental disorder, such as melancholia, first\r\nmaking its appearance at the climacteric epoch, was also regarded by\r\n_Griesinger_ as likely to be unfavourable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     HYGIENE DURING THE MENOPAUSE.\r\n\r\nDuring the critical years of a woman’s life it is the aim of hygiene to\r\nemploy all the means available to counteract the changes in the\r\ncirculation of the blood, the disturbances in the working of the nervous\r\nsystem, and the nutritive disorders, which are in various ways dependent\r\nupon the changes occurring in the reproductive organs during the\r\nclimacteric period; its endeavour should be so to regulate the conduct\r\nof life in this epoch that the important episode of the gradual decline\r\nand ultimate extinction of sexual productivity shall be effected with as\r\nfew local troubles as possible, and as slight variations in the general\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nBy means of baths of various temperature, duration, mode of application,\r\nand composition, and by other selected hydrotherapeutic procedures, we\r\nare enabled during the disturbances of the menopause to exert upon the\r\nskin a powerful derivative influence, and in this way to diminish the\r\npassive hyperaemia of the uterus and the uterine annexa; by the same\r\nmeans we can exercise a sedative influence on the peripheral nerves and\r\nthus further upon the entire nervous system, whenever such measures are\r\ncalled for by the manifold indications of increased irritability;\r\nfurther, by the use of baths we can influence the circulation of the\r\nblood, we can increase the sudatory activity of the skin, and in various\r\nadditional ways we can affect heat production and metabolism, thus\r\nmodifying the processes occurring in the reproductive organs, making the\r\nconditions favourable for the absorption of exudations, and promoting a\r\nhealthy tissue-change in the mucous membrane of the genital passages.\r\n\r\nIn climacteric women, the most usual indications are for the employment\r\nof water-baths at an indifferent temperature. 35 to 37° C. (95 to 98°\r\nF.), of moderate duration, 15 to 20 minutes, the bath being one of\r\nsimple immersion, not of douche or affusion, and the temperature being\r\nkept constant by continuous inflow of a sufficient quantity of hot\r\nwater. Such baths as these promote in a mild but continuously efficient\r\nmanner the functions of the skin—so important during the climacteric\r\nepoch; and they lessen the almost constant tendency to perspirations and\r\nto the development of diseases of the skin (the commonest of which is\r\nclimacteric eczema). The moderate degree of thermic stimulus exercised\r\nby baths at such an indifferent temperature leads them to have an\r\nequable sedative effect upon the nervous system, which is probably\r\ndependent upon an influence exerted through the intermediation of the\r\nsensory nerve-terminals in the skin; and this is most beneficial in\r\nlessening the increased general irritability, both spontaneous and\r\nreflex, so commonly manifested by the nervous system at the climacteric\r\nperiod. In women at this time of life, such baths are most useful in\r\nallaying the common cutaneous hyperaesthesias and neuralgias, and have a\r\nreflex influence also upon the visceral neuralgias and psychical\r\nhyperaesthesias.\r\n\r\nIn climacteric women suffering from abnormal sensitiveness to sensory\r\nimpressions, to strong light and loud noises, or from painful sensations\r\nin the most diverse nerve areas; in those subject to palpitation of the\r\nheart after some trivial exciting cause; in those affected with\r\ncramp-like seizures in the pharynx, the œsophagus, the stomach, and the\r\nintestinal tract; in women with distressing sensations of itching and\r\nburning in the reproductive organs, or in those in whom there is a great\r\nincrease in the intensity of the sexual impulse—in all these common\r\ndisturbances of the menopause, by the daily use of such immersion baths\r\nof water at an indifferent temperature, best taken immediately before\r\nretiring to rest, we shall often succeed in inducing both local and\r\ngeneral repose, in diminishing the spontaneous and reflex irritability\r\nof the nervous system, and in inducing quiet and restorative sleep.\r\n\r\nIn other cases of disturbances of health during the climacteric period,\r\nhowever, more benefit may be derived from hot immersion baths, taken at\r\na temperature well above blood heat, (37° C.—98.4° F.) and lasting\r\nlonger than the warm baths just described. These are indicated when we\r\nwish to increase the activity of the circulation through the skin, to\r\ngive rise to hyperaemia of the superficial structures of the body, to\r\nstimulate powerfully the cutaneous nerves, to promote cutaneous\r\nperspiration—in short, to exercise a powerful derivative effect, to\r\npromote resorption, and to accelerate the general processes of\r\ntissue-change. This method of treatment is suitable for cases in which\r\nat the commencement of the menopause there are already pathological\r\nconditions of the reproductive organs, the morbid states being now\r\naggravated by the processes of the climacteric—such conditions are\r\nmetritis and endometritis, chronic inflammations of the intrapelvic\r\nconnective tissue and of the pelvic peritoneum; and one of the first\r\naims of treatment must be to promote the softening and subsequent\r\nabsorption of these inflammatory products. Again, in cases in which the\r\nclimacteric troubles, dependent in part on increased general arterial\r\nblood-pressure, manifest themselves chiefly in the form of active\r\ncongestions, fugitive heats, vertigo, etc., the employment of hot baths\r\nis likely to be most useful by leading to a notable enlargement of the\r\ncutaneous capillary bloodvessels and consequent lowering of arterial\r\nblood-pressure. Further, in cases of compensatory fluxes, periodic\r\ndiarrhoeas, periodic leucorrhoea, following the suppression of the\r\nmenstrual flow, in cases of vicarious haemorrhage (especially periodic\r\nepistaxis and periodical haemorrhoidal bleedings), the use of hot baths\r\nis often competent to restore the functional activity of the ovaries\r\nwhen this has undergone _premature_ cessation. In addition, their use\r\nassists us in our endeavours to counteract excessive obesity and gouty\r\ndisorders, diseases which tend especially to make their appearance in\r\nwomen at the epoch of the menopause, disorders of metabolism intimately\r\nassociated with the disturbances of the uterine and ovarian functions\r\ncharacteristic of the change of life.\r\n\r\nIn all the conditions just enumerated, if we desire a still more\r\npowerful influence than that exerted by ordinary hot baths, it is in our\r\npower to employ hot mineral water baths, by means of which a chemical,\r\nand perhaps also an electrical, stimulation of the cutaneous nerves is\r\nsuperadded to the simple thermic stimulus conveyed by the hot water. The\r\ndifferent effects of the various mineral baths depends upon both the\r\nsaline and the gaseous constituents of the different springs, and upon\r\nthe peculiar physical properties of the mineral waters.\r\n\r\nSudorific baths are of various kinds. Some, Russian baths, consist of\r\nhot air saturated with moisture; others, Roman-Irish baths, consist of\r\ndry hot air; the most recent of all are the electric light baths, in\r\nwhich the radiant heat of electric lamps is utilized. But owing to the\r\ngreat increase in the body temperature which they cause, with consequent\r\nincreased frequency of pulse and breathing, and still more on account of\r\nthe rapid and extensive increase in blood-pressure to which they give\r\nrise, these powerful sudorific baths are rarely suitable for climacteric\r\nwomen, and if used at all in such cases the greatest caution must be\r\nemployed. Their use is indicated only in women in whom at the time of\r\nthe menopause the rapid onset of obesity has given rise to serious\r\ntroubles, but in whom the heart is perfectly sound and in whom the blood\r\nvessels show no trace of sclerosis.\r\n\r\nFar less often than warm or hot baths, or mineral water baths, are cold\r\nbaths employed during the climacteric period, for baths at a temperature\r\nconsiderably below the indifferent point, and other hydrotherapeutic\r\nprocedures in which cold water is used, stimulate the nervous system so\r\npowerfully and give rise to so great an increase in blood-pressure, that\r\ntheir use is generally to be avoided in climacteric women, since indeed\r\nit is apt to entail serious dangers both physical and mental. Immersion\r\nbaths, plunge baths, or sponge baths, in which the water employed is at\r\na temperature of 18° C. (64° F.) or less, are contra-indicated, for they\r\nact too energetically, abstract heat too powerfully, to be safely\r\nemployed at this epoch of life. If we seek by means of hydrotherapeutic\r\nmeasures to counteract states of congestion at the time of the\r\nmenopause, and at the same time to bring about a general invigoration of\r\nthe patient’s nervous system, immersion baths the water of which is not\r\nbelow 20° C. (68° F.), and lasting from five to fifteen minutes, would\r\nappear to be indicated. In the majority of such cases, however, a\r\nsomewhat higher temperature is preferable, from 26 to 28° C. (79 to 82°\r\nF.), the patient lying at full length in the bath, immersed to above the\r\nshoulders, and the water not being agitated except by a moderate rubbing\r\nof the surface of the body whilst the patient is in the bath. When,\r\nhowever, the patient sits in the bath, the water covering only the lower\r\nhalf of the body as high as the navel, a somewhat lower temperature is\r\npermissible, 20 to 25° C. (68 to 77° F.); but the duration should not\r\nexceed five minutes, moderate mechanical manipulations being carried out\r\nmeanwhile; such baths appear to reduce nervous irritability and to have\r\na sedative effect in the manifold nervous disturbances of the\r\nclimacteric period. Sitz-baths, again, of a longer duration, twenty to\r\nsixty minutes, the water reaching only to the navel, and being at a\r\ntemperature varying from 16 to 25° C. (60 to 77° F.), are useful in\r\nrelieving chronic inflammatory states of the reproductive organs and the\r\nassociated erotic states and abdominal pain and irritability. Colder\r\nsitz-baths, even of brief duration, should, on the other hand, be\r\navoided. Similarly, a shower-bath of water at a temperature of 18 to 24°\r\nC. (64 to 75° F.), lasting one to two minutes, and the water falling\r\nonly from a very slight elevation above the head, have a valuable\r\nsedative action; but, on the other hand, a colder shower-bath, of water\r\nfalling from a greater height, has an exciting action, and is to be\r\navoided at this time of life. When there are severe congestive symptoms,\r\nfriction of the hands and feet for a short time with water at a\r\ntemperature from 12 to 17° C. (54 to 63° F.), followed by a quarter of\r\nan hour’s rest in bed, may be recommended; also immersion of the feet\r\nfor a minute in water at a temperature of 10° C. (50° F.), the feet\r\nbeing vigorously rubbed the while, followed by a walk in the open for\r\nfive or ten minutes. In cases of sleeplessness at the menopause due to\r\ncongestion, a useful method is to dip the feet for twenty or thirty\r\nseconds in water at a temperature of 8 to 10° C. (46 to 50° F.), the\r\nfeet being briskly rubbed whilst in the water, or moved rapidly up and\r\ndown with treading movements; after withdrawal, they are quickly dried,\r\nand the patient immediately goes to bed. Another useful mild soporific\r\nmeasure is to apply before going to bed bandages wrung out of cold\r\nwater; these reach from the foot to the knee, and are left on for the\r\nwhole night. In cases of climacteric menorrhagia, my vaginal\r\nrefrigerator should be used for the direct application of cold to the\r\nreproductive organs; this is a cylindrical apparatus introduced into the\r\nvagina, cold water flows through the interior of the apparatus without\r\nwetting the vaginal mucous membrane. This cooling apparatus is useful\r\nalso in troublesome cases of genital pruritus; cold douches to the vulva\r\nfor one or two minutes at a time are likewise valuable in the relief of\r\nthis affection.\r\n\r\nFor climacteric women, cold sea-bathing is as little to be recommended\r\nas other cold hydrotherapeutic measures, owing to its powerful\r\nrefrigerative effect, and the great mechanical influence of the moving\r\nwater in the waves. But in certain cases, in which sea-air is likely to\r\nbe beneficial, lukewarm sea-baths may also be recommended; their effect\r\nis similar to that of weak brine-baths at a similar temperature.\r\n\r\nDuring the climacteric period, especial attention must be paid to the\r\ncare of the skin. Owing to the extreme sensitiveness of the skin at this\r\ntime of life to outward noxious influences, it is necessary to exercise\r\ngreat care to dry the skin very thoroughly after ordinary ablutions of\r\nthe face and hands; irritating soaps should be avoided, and a bland\r\npowder should be applied after drying. During the earlier part of the\r\nclimacteric period, when menstruation has already ceased, and senile\r\nchanges in the skin with atrophy of the subcutaneous tissues have\r\ncommenced, the extreme dryness of the skin may be relieved by lukewarm\r\nbaths with wet packs to follow; after the bath, the woman is enveloped\r\nin moist linen cloths and then covered over all with a blanket. When the\r\nskin chaps readily, inunction of lanolin ointment will be found useful.\r\n\r\nCleanliness of the genital organs, at all times of importance, is doubly\r\nso during the climacteric period, for the reason that neglect in this\r\nrespect is apt to lead to the onset of genital pruritus. Not only after\r\ndefæcation, but after each act of urination as well, the external\r\ngenital organs and the anus should be carefully washed over with a pad\r\nof clean absorbent wool moistened with lukewarm water. After the\r\nwashing, either powder or ointment should be applied, the former in\r\ncases in which the skin of the parts is usually damp from a natural\r\ntendency to excessive secretion, the latter in cases in which the skin\r\nis dry and tends to crack.\r\n\r\nBodily exercise, carefully selected and regulated to suit the\r\nindividuality of each patient, is a powerful means of relieving the\r\ndisturbances of the menopause. Regular and methodical bodily exercise—to\r\nwhich it must be remembered, women at the climacteric period commonly\r\nfeel considerable aversion—manifests its good effects in the form of\r\nimprovement in the nutritive conditions and functional activity of all\r\nthe organs, and increased activity of all metabolic changes, which are\r\ncommonly sluggish in women at the change of life. Moreover, muscular\r\nexercise, by increasing the volume of blood passing through the muscles,\r\nhas a beneficial derivative influence in diminishing the congestion of\r\nthe brain and the other troublesome congestive symptoms which are liable\r\nto occur in women during the menopause. Again, in cases of excessive\r\nobesity such as so commonly occur in women at the change of life, the\r\nincreased combustion of fat promoted by regular muscular exercise,\r\ncannot fail to have a beneficial effect. Finally, suitably selected\r\nmuscular exercise has a favourable influence also upon the nervous\r\nsystem, the functional activity of which it facilitates, while at the\r\nsame time it strengthens the powers of the will.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore of importance that at the time of the menopause women\r\nshould continue to undertake appropriate active exercise, regular daily\r\nwalks, which should include walking up a moderate incline. As a\r\npreparation for such exercise (in persons hitherto unaccustomed to walk\r\nmuch), or in bad weather, or, again, when there are special reasons\r\nagainst open air exercise, and finally as a supplementary exercise to\r\nwalking, gymnastics and massage may be employed. Such gymnastic\r\nprocedures are to be chosen as will serve to deplete the vessels of the\r\nhead, will have a favourable influence upon the portal circulation, and\r\nwill withdraw the blood-stream from the pelvic organs; such are, in\r\naddition to general gymnastic exercises, methodical deep breathing,\r\nmethodical exercise of the abdominal muscles, exercises involving the\r\nextensors of the back and the abductors and external rotators of the\r\nthigh, and exercises of the extremities. Various gymnastic apparatus may\r\nbe employed with advantage, and more especially those in which the\r\nvarious muscular movements are effected against a resistance. But in all\r\ncases extreme care must be taken to avoid over-fatigue and\r\nover-exertion. A graduated form of bodily exercise combined with passive\r\ngymnastics, suitable for climacteric women, is massage, in which by\r\nmechanical stimulation, by pressure and friction of the whole body or of\r\ncertain parts, the nutrition of the muscles is favourably influenced,\r\nand the activity of the general circulation is increased. In the use of\r\nmassage also, in climacteric women, all undue excitation of the nervous\r\nsystem is to be carefully avoided, a mild form of this powerful agent\r\nmust alone be employed; gentle stretching and rubbing of the skin of the\r\nlower extremities, the back, and the abdomen, followed by gentle\r\nkneading of the muscles. Massage of the internal reproductive organs\r\n(the method of Thure Brandt), in view of the common tendency to sexual\r\nexcitability in women at the climacteric, is mentioned only to be\r\nprohibited. For the same reason, and also on account of the frequency\r\nwith which at the time of the menopause women suffer from tachycardia\r\nand from other disorders of the heart, bicycling is in most cases an\r\nunsuitable exercise at this time of life.\r\n\r\nA matter of great importance is the regulation of the diet of women\r\nduring this phase of life, the aim of such regulation being one which\r\nthe older physicians sought to fulfil by means of venesection and wet\r\ncupping, namely, to overcome the abnormality in the constitution of the\r\nblood which arises from the cessation of the internal secretion of the\r\novaries, and further to relieve the symptom-complex of abdominal\r\nplethora and the various passive hyperaemias and collateral congestions;\r\nand in addition to subdue the great general nervous irritability, the\r\nsensibility to external stimuli, the inclination to excessive reflex\r\nmanifestations, characteristic in women during the climacteric period.\r\n\r\nThe diet must be regulated in respect both of quality and quantity, and\r\nit is obvious that the regulation must be thoughtfully adapted to the\r\nneeds of each individual case.\r\n\r\nAs regards quantity, the main general principle of dietetics for\r\nclimacteric women is that over-nutrition is to be avoided, that the\r\nquantity of nutriment must be reduced to the absolute minimum necessary\r\nto supply the needs of the tissues. In view of the fact that we are\r\nconcerned with women at a comparatively advanced period of life, whose\r\nphysical labours are not as a rule exhausting, that quantity of food\r\nwill usually be sufficient which is competent to furnish 35 to 40\r\ncalories per body-kilogram per diem. If we assume that the mean\r\nbody-weight of a woman as the climacteric age is 60 kilograms, the\r\nheat-equivalent of the food required daily by such a woman may be\r\nestimated at 2,100 to 2,400 calories. This will be approximately\r\nsupplied by a diet consisting of 100 grams albumen, 60 grams fat, and\r\n350 grams carbohydrate. The customary preference for a large amount of\r\nnitrogenous food is, however, not dependent upon physiological\r\nrequirements, and provided that the needful minimum of albumen is\r\nsupplied (about 1.5 gram per body-kilogram per diem), the requisite\r\nnumber of calories may be furnished by very various combinations of the\r\ndifferent nutritive elements.\r\n\r\nThe general principles of the qualitative regulation of the diet of\r\nclimacteric women are: first that after the necessary minimum of albumen\r\nhas been supplied, there shall be added an amount of carbohydrate and of\r\nfat varying in relative proportions and quantities according to the\r\nphysiological requirements of the individual, but taken together\r\nsufficient to supply the necessary heat-equivalent; secondly, that there\r\nshould be an abundant consumption of water; thirdly, that stimulating\r\ndietetic adjuvants should as far as possible be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogenous equilibrium of the body may be maintained either by\r\nanimal or by vegetable proteids; in the case of the former (animal\r\nalbumens), the climacteric woman should avoid those containing\r\nconsiderable quantities of nucleo-albumen or of deleterious products of\r\ntissue-change; in the case of the latter (vegetable albumens), she\r\nshould avoid those likely to cause undue stimulation of the intestinal\r\ntract. Of flesh foods (mammals, birds, and fishes), those kinds are to\r\nbe preferred which contain small quantities only of extractives\r\n(kreatin, xanthin, etc.) since these substances are supposed to have a\r\nstimulating influence upon the nerves and the heart. Hence, boiled meat\r\nis better than roasted, and the flesh of young animals (veal, for\r\ninstance) and fish are to be preferred to game, and the last-mentioned\r\nis to be avoided especially for this reason, that the flavours for which\r\nit is valued by the gourmet are products of partial decomposition\r\narising from prolonged hanging; for similar reasons, meat extracts,\r\nanimal soups, sausages, smoked flesh and fish, and preserved (potted)\r\nmeats, should all be avoided. From the intimate connexion between the\r\ningestion of nuclein and the formation of uric acid, albumens rich in\r\nnuclein are to be forbidden; such are the various foods consisting\r\nchiefly of gland-cells—sweetbread, liver, brain, kidneys, etc. As well\r\nas from the appropriate flesh-foods, the requisite albumen may most\r\nsuitably be obtained from eggs and milk (including buttermilk); on the\r\nother hand, caviare is unsuitable owing to its stimulant action on the\r\ngenital organs, cheese because it contains large quantities of the\r\nproducts of decomposition of casein and milk-fat; the fermented milks,\r\nkoumiss and kefir, are likewise unsuitable. Suitable vegetable foods for\r\nthe supply of albumen (in addition to carbohydrates) are porridge,\r\nbread, and the leguminosae; nuts, on the other hand, cause too much\r\nirritation of the stomach and intestines.\r\n\r\nFor women during the climacteric period we recommend a mixed diet\r\nmoderate in quantity; the amount of flesh and fat in the diet should not\r\nbe large, whilst cereals, green vegetables, and fruit may be taken in\r\ngreater abundance; irritant vegetable foods must be avoided, and\r\nespecially those which tend to stimulate unduly intestinal muscular\r\nactivity and intestinal secretion. It is important that an abundance of\r\nwater should be taken, not less than two or three pints daily, and a\r\npure, fresh, spring water is preferable to the aerated waters, natural\r\nor artificial. Alcoholic beverages are to be avoided, and more\r\nespecially those which are rich in extractives as well as in alcohol.\r\nFor this latter reason, beer and champagne are harmful, whilst spirits\r\nand liqueurs are to be condemned on account of the high percentage of\r\nalcohol they contain. The stimulating alkaloidal drinks, tea and coffee,\r\nare also to be avoided, or if taken at all, only in a very dilute form.\r\nWith regard to the preparation of the food, the cardinal principle is\r\nthat it should be as little irritant as possible; neither mechanically\r\nirritating the alimentary tract by an excess of indigestible or\r\nundigested residue, nor irritating it chemically by an excessive\r\nadmixture of sugar, salt, vinegar, pepper and other spices; nor,\r\nfinally, giving rise to thermal irritation by being excessively hot or\r\nextremely cold.\r\n\r\nThe individual meals are preferably small ones and they must therefore\r\nbe taken at comparatively short intervals, five times daily, the\r\nprincipal meal being taken at one or two o’clock in the afternoon, and\r\nthe supper (which should be small) comparatively early, at seven or\r\neight o’clock.\r\n\r\n  NOTE.—In his discussion of the _details_ of diet for women during\r\n  the climacteric period, hours of meals, actual dishes, etc., the\r\n  author refers exclusively to Austrian and German customs in these\r\n  matters. The translator has not attempted to adapt the following\r\n  pages to the needs of English readers, as he feels that the general\r\n  principles already given will enable the English medical man to\r\n  construct without serious difficulty suitable diet-tables for the\r\n  cases with which he has to deal.\r\n\r\nSuitable articles of food are the following:\r\n\r\nSoups, Broths, and other Liquid Foods: Soups and broths made from the\r\nflesh or bones of beef, mutton, veal, chicken, or pigeon, _without_ the\r\naddition of meat extract, or of meat juices, peptones, somatose or\r\nnutrose, but _with_ _t_he addition of barley, oatmeal, rice, wheatmeal,\r\nryemeal, peas, beans, lentils, vermicelli, or macaroni; also broths or\r\nporridge made from any kind of ground cereal, or from potatoes, or from\r\npeas, beans, or lentils.\r\n\r\nFlesh Foods: Lean beef, veal, mutton, roast or boiled, pigeon, chicken;\r\ncertain fresh fish—pike, haddock, sole, perch, and trout. _Unsuitable_\r\nare: pork, goose, eels, salmon, herrings, oysters, caviare, lobster,\r\ncrab, smoked meat, hare, venison, wild-duck, brain, liver, kidneys.\r\n\r\nVegetables, Sweets, and Savouries: Green peas, spinach, cauliflower,\r\ncarrots, turnips, buttered eggs, omelette, boiled and baked puddings,\r\nrice boiled in milk, apples and rice, whipped cream, salads, wheaten\r\nbread, French rolls, biscuits, and rusks.\r\n\r\nFruits: Almost all fruits may be taken, raw, cooked, or preserved; also\r\nin the form of currant and other fruit cakes, and as fruit-ices.\r\n\r\nBeverages: Milk, buttermilk, water, the same acidulated with various\r\nfruit-juices and essences (as lemonade, etc.), weak tea with plenty of\r\nmilk, cocoa, chocolate. To be _forbidden_ are: beer, strong and sweet\r\nwines, distilled spirits.\r\n\r\nAn example is subjoined of a simple diet-table compiled on the above\r\nprinciples:\r\n\r\n                      _Quantity  _Albumen._   _Fat._   _Carbohydrate._\r\n                      in grams._\r\n AFTERNOON:\r\n     A cup of milk           150        5.4        5.4             7.5\r\n     Roll and butter          70        4.9        0.4            39.2\r\n MIDDLE OF MORNING:\r\n     Soup                    100        1.1        1.5             5.7\r\n     Roll                     70        4.9        0.4            39.2\r\n MID-DAY MEAL:\r\n     Soup                    100        1.1        1.5             5.7\r\n     Roast meat              100       38.2        1.7\r\n     Green vegetables        100        1.6        0.4             8.4\r\n     Pudding                 200       17.4       30.0            57.8\r\n     Fruit                   100        3.0                       15.0\r\n     Bread                    35        2.4        0.2            19.0\r\n BREAKFAST:\r\n     A cup of milk           150        5.4        5.4             7.5\r\n     Roll                     70        4.9        0.4            39.2\r\n SUPPER:\r\n     Soup                    100        1.1        1.5             5.7\r\n     Two soft eggs            90       11.2       10.8             0.4\r\n     Bread                    70        4.9        0.4            39.2\r\n     Fruit                   100        3.0                       15.0\r\n                           —————      —————       ————           —————\r\n        Total              1,617      110.5       69.9           304.5\r\n                           =====      =====       ====           =====\r\n\r\n In addition, water, _ad libitum_, and perhaps a little light wine.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, however, a mainly vegetarian diet may be more suitable,\r\nand more particularly a mainly fruit diet, in order to diminish\r\npersistent congestive symptoms. In such cases the following diet-table\r\nmay be recommended for _short_ periods:\r\n\r\nFirst breakfast: An apple and an orange.\r\n\r\nSecond breakfast: 25 grams of white bread with butter and three baked\r\napples.\r\n\r\nDinner (mid-day): 100 grams fish or meat, potatoes, green vegetables, 3\r\nboiled or baked apples.\r\n\r\nAfternoon: An orange, or an apple, or a pear, or some grapes.\r\n\r\nSupper: Milk, apples and rice, oranges, grapes, figs.\r\n\r\nBeverages: Water, with or without fruit juices or essences.\r\n\r\nChanges in the above diet-table could very readily be effected, whereby\r\nthe quantity of carbohydrate could be increased and the quantity of\r\nalbumen lessened.\r\n\r\nIn women of sanguine temperament and full habit of body, who at the time\r\nof the menopause very rapidly become obese, important changes in the\r\ndiet become necessary. The main principles of a fat-reducing diet are\r\nthe following: Avoidance of all overfeeding, reduction of the quantity\r\nof food taken below the former average amount, with retention, however,\r\nof a sufficiency of nutrient material to maintain the metabolic\r\nequilibrium of the essential tissues; the maintenance of this metabolic\r\nequilibrium demands a sufficiency of nitrogenous foods, but the fats in\r\nthe diet may be reduced to a minimum, and the carbohydrates may also be\r\nvery greatly diminished. At the same time, there must be systematic\r\nbodily exercise, and the hours of sleep must not exceed a nightly\r\naverage of seven.\r\n\r\nFor obese women at the climacteric period, a suitable average diet would\r\ncontain 160 grams albumen, 12 grams fat, and 120 grams carbohydrate,\r\nyielding a daily heat-equivalent of 1,250 to 1,300 calories.\r\n\r\nA sample diet-table constructed on these principles is appended:\r\n\r\n                      _Quantity  _Albumen._   _Fat._   _Carbohydrate._\r\n                      in grams._\r\n BREAKFAST:\r\n     A cup of weak           150       0.45                        0.9\r\n     tea\r\n       With milk, but         30       1.29        0.9             1.2\r\n     no sugar\r\n     White bread              50        4.8        0.4            30.0\r\n     Lean cold meat           50       19.1        0.9\r\n DINNER (Mid-Day):\r\n     Small cup of            100        1.1        1.5             5.7\r\n     clear soup\r\n     Lean beef               200       76.4        3.4\r\n     Green                   100        1.6        0.4             8.4\r\n     vegetables,\r\n     salad, etc.\r\n     Fruit                   100        3.0                       15.0\r\n     Roll                     35        2.4        0.2            19.6\r\n AFTERNOON:\r\n     A cup of weak           150       0.45                        0.9\r\n     tea\r\n       With milk, but         30       1.29        0.9             1.2\r\n     no sugar\r\n SUPPER:\r\n     Soup                    100        1.1        1.5             5.7\r\n     Lean roast meat         100       38.2        1.7\r\n     Roll                     50        4.8        0.4            30.0\r\n                           —————      —————       ————           —————\r\n        Total              1,245      155.9       13.2           118.6\r\n                           =====      =====       ====           =====\r\n\r\nIn the selection of individual articles of diet, it is important to bear\r\nin mind the fact that in all climacteric women it must be our aim to\r\nstimulate intestinal muscular activity (peristalsis) and intestinal\r\nsecretion to a moderate extent, for by more active intestinal secretion\r\nabdominal congestion is to some extent relieved, and by intestinal\r\ntransudation and by diminution of the lateral pressure the circulation\r\nthrough the abdominal vessels is facilitated. By thus lowering the\r\nintra-abdominal blood-pressure, we shall assist in relieving a number of\r\nchronic hyperaemic states of the pelvic and various other organs, from\r\nwhich women are prone to suffer at the menopause. Hence all articles of\r\ndiet must be forbidden which have a tendency to give rise to\r\nconstipation. But we must also forbid all substances which leave\r\nextensive undigested residues, such as the rinds of fruits, large\r\nquantities of porridge, etc., hard meats, nuts, and the like. Most\r\nsuitable are those articles of diet which contain large percentages of\r\nfluid constituents, such as milk, thin soups, weak tea (infused only a\r\nshort time, so as to contain little tannic acid, which is very\r\nconstipating), white meat—veal, breast of chicken, etc. Of vegetables,\r\nthose are best which contain plenty of water and an abundance of the\r\norganic acids, young, fresh garden produce, lettuce, cauliflower, young\r\ngreen peas, young carrots, turnips, etc. Juicy fruits are good, apples,\r\npears, cherries, and plums. Butter and honey are also excellent. In many\r\npersons suffering from constipation, all that is necessary for their\r\nrelief is to give a tumblerful of cold water the first thing in the\r\nmorning; with others, the use in addition of whole-meal bread with\r\nplenty of butter and honey and uncooked fruit, is required.\r\n\r\nIn women suffering from the various disturbances of the climacteric\r\nperiod in an aggravated form, either because the menopause occurs at an\r\nunusually early age, or because the suppression of menstruation has\r\ntaken place suddenly instead of gradually—especially in cases of\r\nheart-trouble, severe vertigo, pronounced vasomotor disturbances, or\r\nmental excitement (also erotic excitement), I have sometimes found a\r\nmethodical milk-cure carried on for several weeks most beneficial. By\r\nthis I do not mean an exclusive diet of milk, but a diet consisting\r\nchiefly of milk and milk-foods; owing to the absence of all irritation\r\nof the nervous and vascular systems, this diet has a very definite\r\nsedative influence in such cases. The milk should be skimmed, and should\r\nbe given four times daily in gradually increasing quantities, the total\r\namount rising from ten ounces to fifty ounces daily. The only other meal\r\nshould be a substantial mid-day dinner, consisting of soup, roasted\r\nwhite meat, young green vegetables, and a little fruit. In some\r\ninstances, to prevent constipation, it is necessary to add ten grams of\r\nmilk sugar to each glass of milk; in other cases it is necessary to\r\ndilute the milk with water. It is obvious that the quantity of milk\r\ngiven is not alone sufficient to maintain the metabolic equilibrium of\r\nthe body; but the defect in this respect is made up by the substantial\r\nmeal given at mid-day.\r\n\r\nAmong the stimulating influences which during the sexual epoch of the\r\nmenopause are as far as possible to be avoided we must unhesitatingly\r\ninclude the practice of coitus, inasmuch as at this time of life there\r\nalready exists a strong tendency towards the occurrence of hyperaemia of\r\nthe reproductive organs; and sexual intercourse, increasing as it\r\ninevitably must this tendency to hyperaemia, should be indulged in as\r\nlittle as possible. And yet precisely in women of the climacteric age,\r\nin “la femme demi-vieille” there often exists a strong desire to drain\r\nthe cup of sexual pleasure to its dregs. Not infrequently, therefore,\r\nthe physician is asked to advise regarding the proposed marriage of a\r\nwoman in whom the menopause is drawing near, the desired husband being\r\nyoung, or at least still fully virile. If the advice is given in all\r\nsincerity with a sole eye to the woman’s health, the medical man will\r\ndefinitely forbid the marriage.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the changes of the menopause are fully completed, when\r\nthe woman’s reproductive organs have undergone complete senile atrophy,\r\nthere is no medical reason why a couple who wish to give a tenderer name\r\nto an intimate friendship between man and woman, should refrain from\r\nmarriage—provided that both have attained a like stage of sexual\r\ndecline. “But,” writes _Tilt_, “a union between frosty January and\r\nblooming May is likely to be as dangerous to the health as it is to the\r\nhappiness of both.”\r\n\r\nWhilst attending to the regulation of the physical diet of his\r\nclimacteric patient, the physician should not overlook her psychical\r\nregimen. A woman’s mind is very powerfully affected by the processes of\r\nthe menopause. On the one hand, her fears are stimulated by the thought\r\nthat she is entering upon the “critical age,” of whose dangers she has\r\noften been warned; and, on the other hand, she is mentally depressed by\r\nthe knowledge that she is about to lose the charms of womanhood, and to\r\ndecline in sexual esteem. It is well, therefore, for women during the\r\nyears of change, to have some kind of employment, which fills their\r\nhours, occupies their thoughts, and—leaves a certain scope for the\r\nexercise of feminine vanity. Works of benevolence or of general utility,\r\nand literary occupations, are thus of great advantage to climacteric\r\nwomen. _Plato_, indeed, pointed out that women at this time of their\r\nlives should occupy themselves with literature and intellectual culture.\r\n\r\nJust as it is the duty of the physician, more especially of the family\r\nphysician, to enlighten the maiden on the threshold of her sexual\r\ndevelopment regarding the processes of the awakening sexual life, and to\r\ngive her the necessary instruction concerning the hygienic measures\r\nwhich it is proper for her to adopt—so also is it his duty to convey\r\nmedical information to the woman who stands on the threshold of sexual\r\ndecadence. A woman’s ignorance is often equally profound at both these\r\nepochs of the sexual life. A woman in the early forties often does not\r\nsuspect, or at least refuses to acknowledge, that she is gradually\r\ndrawing near to the end of her sexual life; and she is still farther\r\nfrom the knowledge that definite rules of general and sexual hygiene\r\nmust be observed by her if she wishes to minimize the dangers of the\r\ncritical period.\r\n\r\nThe medical friend, in an earnest though far from gloomy manner, will\r\nexpound to her the nature of the physiological processes of the\r\nmenopause, and will instruct her regarding the corresponding preventive\r\nmeasures—diet, exercise, clothing, care of the skin, and the regulation\r\nof sexual intercourse. Moreover, the physician, by means of skilfully\r\ndirected enquiries regarding certain symptoms, will be enabled to gain\r\nearly information about the occurrence of abnormal processes at this\r\nperiod of life, and will in this way detect the first beginnings of many\r\ndiseases which are amenable to treatment only at the very outset of\r\ntheir course. For example, _Brierre do Boismont_, an early and accurate\r\nobserver of this sexual epoch in the life of woman, points out that in\r\ncases in which, during the change of life, a woman experiences an\r\nincreased inclination for sexual intercourse, nineteen times out of\r\ntwenty, a local examination will disclose the existence of some disease\r\nof the reproductive apparatus. Similarly, every gynecologist is now\r\nfamiliar with the fact that unusually free, atypical haemorrhages during\r\nthe climacteric period, are commonly indications of the existence of a\r\nuterine neoplasm.\r\n\r\nMuch evil may be avoided, and much suffering can be diminished if the\r\nphysician, in accordance with the advice of Hippocrates, does not limit\r\nhis activities strictly to the exercise of the healing art, but stands\r\nby a woman’s side as her mentor and confidant during the troublesome\r\nyears of her sexual decline. And he will best fulfil these functions, if\r\nhe succeeds in convincing the climacteric woman of the profound truth\r\nembodied in the saying of the great French philosopher:\r\n\r\n                    Qui n’a pas l’esprit de son âge,\r\n                    De son âge a tout le malheur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n                       [References are to

the diseases from which women suffer.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  “Love is an episode merely in the life of man; of woman, it is the\r\n  entire history.” But this epigram of Madame de Staël’s will, to\r\n  English readers, be more familiar in the form in which it was cast by\r\n  Byron (_Don Juan_, canto i, stanza 194):\r\n\r\n               “Man’s love is of man’s life a thing apart;\r\n                   ’Tis woman’s whole existence.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  On Love.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  “This century will be known as the century of the diseases of the\r\n  uterus.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  Half-virgin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  Beauty of the devil.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  “The cry of the suffering organ comes not from the uterus but from the\r\n  entire organism.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  “One for Many. Leaves from the Diary of a Maiden of Vera.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  It is by a certain abuse of terminology that the name _follicle_ is\r\n  given to these structures even before the appearance of fluid in their\r\n  interior, the word _folliculus_ meaning properly a _little bag_ or\r\n  _sack_. The author’s limitation of the term _graafian follicle_ to the\r\n  later, full-grown stage of these structures, though historically\r\n  accurate, is not usual in England.—TR.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  “A uterus served by organs.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  _Menorrhage des Jeunes Filles et Hypertrophie du Col Utérin._\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  The German word used is _Herzkrampf_; in the first line of the\r\n  paragraph it is used in the plural, and in inverted commas. Angina\r\n  pectoris proper, the severe and often fatal disease met with chiefly\r\n  in elderly men, is sometimes known in Germany as _Herzkrampf_, but the\r\n  established and distinctive German name for the affection is\r\n  _Stenokardia_. It is evident, however, that Krieger’s cases are not\r\n  cases of true angina, and it is probable that they would be classed by\r\n  English physicians under the heading of _pseudo-angina pectoris_.—TR.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  _Hebephrenie._—There is no current English equivalent of this word,\r\n  used by Kahlbaum to denote a form of melancholia occurring at puberty,\r\n  and terminating in dementia.—TR.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  Katatonia (_Katatonie_) is a term used in Germany to denote insanity\r\n  associated with muscular rigidity.—TR.\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  A term introduced by Charcot. See page 97.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  The author’s classification is adhered to. It is not usual, I believe,\r\n  in Germany, to class the thyroid body among the organs of respiration.\r\n  But the only disease mentioned under the above heading is goitre.—TR.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  In Germany the term _Lanugo_, or _Wollhaar_, is used to denote the\r\n  rudimentary hairy covering of the body throughout life, as\r\n  distinguished from the specialized and fully developed hairs of the\r\n  head, beard, axillæ, etc. In England the use of the term _lanugo_ is\r\n  usually restricted to denote the downy crop of hair with which an\r\n  infant is covered at birth, which is shed in a few months thereafter.\r\n  See the English edition of Toldt’s Atlas of Human Anatomy, Part VI.,\r\n  Appendix, note 503.—TR.\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  It will be noticed that the author uses the term _seborrhœa_ as a\r\n  general term for diseases of the sebaceous glands, including acne. In\r\n  England acne, and its preliminary stage, the formation of comedones,\r\n  are separately considered, the signification of the term seborrhœa\r\n  being limited to denote cases in which the secretion of the glands\r\n  forms an oily, waxy, or scaly accumulation on the surface. _Seborrhœa\r\n  oleosa_ is defined by Crocker as that form of the affection in which\r\n  the olein is in excess.—TR.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  It must be remembered that these dietetic directions are for German\r\n  and Austrian middle-class people, the arrangement of whose meals\r\n  differs from ours considerably. The usual meals and hours are: Early\r\n  breakfast, coffee and rolls, at 8 or earlier; second breakfast, a more\r\n  substantial meal, at 10; mid-day dinner, the principal meal, at 1 or 2\r\n  P. M.; afternoon coffee, at 4; supper at 8 P. M.—TR.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  Regarding the significance attached by the author to the words\r\n  _seborrhœa_ and _seborrhœis_, see note to page 107.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  _Eine Mutterpflicht._\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  See note 26 to p. 107.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n                          My peace is lost,\r\n                          My heart is heavy,\r\n                          I find it never\r\n                          And nevermore.\r\n                          My bosom presses\r\n                          Towards him,\r\n                          Ah, could I seize him\r\n                          And embrace him,\r\n                          And kiss him,\r\n                          As I long to do,\r\n                          In his kisses\r\n                          I should pass away.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  It seems expedient to point out that whilst in this work the German\r\n  word _Geschlechtstrieb_ has in the great majority of cases been\r\n  rendered in English by the term _sexual impulse_, on two or three\r\n  occasions, as here, the author speaks of the _Geschlechtstrieb_ as\r\n  composed of _sensation_, _perception_, and _impulse_ (_Drang_), when\r\n  for obvious reasons the rendering _sexual instinct_ becomes necessary.\r\n  Though the term _sexual impulse_ is, I think, in more general use than\r\n  the term _sexual instinct_, it must not be forgotten that the\r\n  inclination towards sexual congress is composite in nature, and that\r\n  an _impulse_ in the strict sense of the term is only one element in\r\n  its composition.—TR.\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  This word _urning_, used to denote individuals exhibiting this\r\n  particular type of homosexuality, belongs to the terminology now\r\n  generally adopted by writers on sexual pathology, and has been used by\r\n  English writers on the subject—Havelock Ellis, for instance.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  The German word _Angst_, here translated anxiety, is used in various\r\n  senses, ranging from _anxiety_ to _anguish_, according as the mental\r\n  element or the element of pure feeling predominates in the conception.\r\n  In the case of the _angst-neurosis_, however, a condition of _mental_\r\n  uneasiness would appear to be connoted, and therefore _anxiety_ is the\r\n  best rendering.—TR.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  German, _Lendenmarksymptome_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  German, _saures Aufstossen und Sodbrennen_; for the latter noun\r\n  _heartburn_ would appear to be the most precise English equivalent,\r\n  since the term _pyrosis_ is sometimes employed to denote the _acid\r\n  eructation_ (or _water-brash_) and sometimes the accompanying\r\n  sensation at the pit of the stomach—_heartburn_ or _cardialgia_.\r\n  Etymologically, of course, the latter sense of _pyrosis_ is correct\r\n  (Greek, πῦρ, fire).—TR.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  By consideration of the results of treatment.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  Ger. _in den Parametrien_. The reasons for preferring the phrase\r\n  _parametric connective tissue_ to the noun _parametrium_ will be found\r\n  in the English edition of Toldt’s _Atlas of Human Anatomy_, Part IV,\r\n  App. note 84.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  It is usual of the Continent of Europe to divide the course of\r\n  pregnancy into ten “months” of four weeks each. This fact must never\r\n  be forgotten when comparisons are made between English and Continental\r\n  tables, respectively, of the events of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  Ger. _Lufthunger_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  See note 36 on p. 225.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  The statement is so often made that conception occurring when one or\r\n  both parents are intoxicated is likely to be harmful to the offspring,\r\n  that it seems expedient to point out that neither the author of this\r\n  work, nor any other author known to me, has ever brought forward any\r\n  rigorous scientific evidence in proof of the alleged fact. It is one\r\n  of those crude generalizations whose superficial verisimilitude leads\r\n  to their continued though unsupported reassertion. The fact that the\r\n  notion of procreation by inebriated progenitors is repugnant to our\r\n  æsthetic sensibilities has, of course, nothing whatever to do with the\r\n  logical proof of the assertion that such an act is harmful to the\r\n  fruit of conception.—TR.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n                  Respect kisses the hand,\r\n                  Affection kisses the cheek,\r\n                  Spiritual love kisses the mouth.\r\n                  Desire the neck;\r\n                  Amatory frenzy kisses the whole body.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  The author omits special reference to the metastatic orchitis that so\r\n  frequently complicates epidemic parotitis (mumps) when that disease\r\n  occurs after puberty. Though usually benign in character, the\r\n  inflammation very often results in atrophy of the testicle.\r\n  Fortunately, bilateral atrophy from this cause is very rare; and even\r\n  when it does occur, both testicles being extremely small, _potentia\r\n  coeundi_ and _potentia gestandi_ may nevertheless remain. But when\r\n  double atrophy from this cause takes place _before_ puberty (happily\r\n  an occurrence of the utmost rarity), sexual development is usually\r\n  arrested, the sufferer being in effect a eunuch.—TR.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  It is recorded of John Hunter that in a case of hypospadias, he\r\n  advised the patient to draw his semen into a syringe and inject it\r\n  into his wife’s vagina, with fruitful result.—TR.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  _Constrictor Cunni Muscle._—In women the _bulbocavernosus muscles_,\r\n  right and left, form, as it were, a sphincter to the vaginal outlet.\r\n  Hence the alternative names of _sphincter vaginæ_ and _constrictor\r\n  cunni muscle_. The latter name is in common use in Germany, but,\r\n  though appropriate, is rarely employed in England.—TRANSL.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  “Prostitutes conceive often, but abort frequently.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  “Prostitutes become fecund when, abandoning their profession, they\r\n  marry, or pass under the protection of a single man; in such cases\r\n  they become pregnant, they are always happy, and their children are as\r\n  healthy as those of other women.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  Compare stanzas 46 and 47 of “Venus and Adonis”:\r\n\r\n           His ears up-prick’d; his braided hanging mane\r\n           Upon his compass’d crest now stands on end;\r\n           His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,\r\n           As from a furnace, vapours does he send:\r\n                 His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,\r\n                 Shows his hot courage and his high desire.\r\n\r\n           Sometimes he trots, as if he told the steps,\r\n           With gentle majesty and modest pride;\r\n           Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,\r\n           As who should say, “Lo! thus my strength is tried;\r\n                 And this I do to captivate the eye\r\n                 Of the fair breeder that is standing by.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  NOTE.—In Germany, the term _Ausfallserscheinungen_ is used as a\r\n  general name for the various disorders of the climacteric period. The\r\n  word _Ausfall_ means literally _a falling out_, or _shedding_, as of\r\n  the hair. No precise English equivalent of the term is known to me,\r\n  nor is one really needed, the phrase _disorders of the climacteric_\r\n  being sufficiently distinctive.—TRANSL.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges made to medical terms, proper names, or foreign words.
